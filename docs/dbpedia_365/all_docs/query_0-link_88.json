It stars Femi Jacobs, Rita Dominic, Linda Ejiofor, Kehinde Bankole and Jide Kosoko with Special Appearances from Nse Ikpe Etim, Kate Henshaw and Chinedu Ikedieze. It received 6 nominations at the 9th Africa Movie Academy Awards and won the award for the category Achievement In Make-Up. Plot The film opens at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, with a phone conversation between Mr. Makinde Esho (Femi Jacobs) and his Managing director (Jide Kosoko). Makinde is reminded by his MD about how important it is for him to get an authorization from the Ministry of Land, and return to Lagos with a positive feedback. Just as Makinde is about to board a Taxi, he is interrupted by Ejura (Linda Ejiofor), a female Corp member who pleads for a Lift, as she is short on cash and there is a long queue at the ATM. Makinde refuses at first, but after much persuasion from Ejura, he reluctantly agrees. Even though Ejura had promised earlier to keep mute during the ride, her inquisitive nature gives Makinde facial expressions that prompt answers and eventually start a conversation. Mr Makinde arrives at the Ministry of land and is met by a scenario involving Mr. Ugor (Chinedu Ikedieze), being forced out of the building by security operatives. Makinde is in awe but manages to help find his way to the reception desk to meet the minister's discourteous secretary, Clara Ikemba (Rita Dominic). He is unapologetically informed by Clara that his meeting, which was originally scheduled for 9:30 am, has been moved to 4:30 pm. Makinde retires his stance and joins the other appointees who are all seated to see the minister. While waiting, Clara informs the appointees that she sells recharge cards and cold drinks to cater for their needs as they wait to see the minister, Ejura also calls Mr Makinde to thank him for the ride he gave to her earlier while he was having his lunch at a nearby eatery . Several hours has gone past and Makinde is yet to get a word from the secretary about his rescheduled meeting. He decides to inquire about it from her but to his surprise, she informs him rudely that the minister has already left the office. Makinde argues that she could have told him and others waiting, instead of making people waste their precious time. Clara replies him \"OYO (meaning On Your Own) is their case\", a slang which means everyman is responsible to himself and she has no business telling them to wait or go home. The meeting is eventually rescheduled for the following day. Makinde checks into a hotel. While trying to fight boredom, Ejura calls and eventually joins Makinde in the hotel in a bid to keep him company. Makinde is set to give his presentation to the minister on Tuesday morning, but just as the secretary is about to inform the minister of his presence, a group of Igbo kinsmen\n\n1\n\nAhaa Re\n\nAhaa Re (2019) is a critically acclaimed Indian drama film directed by noted Bengali filmmaker Ranjan Ghosh.

One commentator noted that Barnes, R. L. Burnside, Big Jack Johnson, Paul \"Wine\" Jones and James \"Super Chikan\" Johnson were \"present-day exponents of an edgier, electrified version of the raw, uncut Delta blues sound.\" Career Born in Longwood, Washington County, Mississippi, United States, Barnes got his start in 1960 as a member of the Swinging Gold Coasters, a local Mississippi blues outfit. He relocated to Chicago in 1964, where he played in bars and clubs, but returned to Mississippi in 1971 and continued to perform locally into the early 1980s. In 1984, Barnes hooked up with Lil' Dave Thompson when the latter was aged 15, and the duo played on Mississippi's juke joint circuit. Barnes opened a nightclub, the Playboy Club, in 1985, and played there with a backing group called the Playboys; they became regional blues favorites, and eventually signed to Rooster Blues, who released Barnes's debut effort in 1990. The album was hailed by Allmusic as \"an instant modern classic\", and Guitar Player called Barnes \"a wonderfully idiosyncratic guitar player and an extraordinary vocalist by any standard\". Barnes toured the U.S. and Europe following the album's release. Barnes's career was interrupted in the middle of the decade when he was diagnosed with lung cancer, and he died of the disease in April 1996 in Chicago, aged 59.

Like the other Strike.TV offerings which were sanctioned by the Writers' sister union, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), UNKNOWN SENDER was able to attract major talent to its cast, all of whom agreed to donate profits to the Hollywood charity, Actors' Fund. Among the actors in the series are Timothy Dalton, Joanne Whalley, Mindy Sterling (Austin Powers' \"Frau Farbissina\"), comedian Jay Davis (Dane Cook's Tourgasm), and Stan Freberg. Behind the camera, noteworthy figures include Academy Award nominee Marilyn Vance and pioneer web filmmaker Kevin Rubio (Troops) among the producers; as well as Lost Director of Photography Edward J. Pei, film composer Adam Cohen (The Incredibles); and Special Effects Supervisor Shant Jordan (Hellboy II). Series Premise The five- to ten-minute-long UNKNOWN SENDER episodes consist of suspense or sci-fi stories which share the conceit that they are actual events, captured by closed circuit television (CCTV), surveillance monitors, amateur videographers, and the like, all collected and posted on the web by a mysterious, unseen \"Unknown Sender\". Influences The creator of the show, Die Hard screenwriter Steven E. de Souza, described the series as \"a cross between The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents\". De Souza, a writer and director on HBO's similarly themed Tales From the Crypt, said another influence was the legendary 1947–1949 Mutual (and later, ABC) network radio horror series, Quiet, Please. Considered by many to be the best example of Golden Age Radio, and a direct precursor of The Twilight Zone, Quiet, Please often dramatized its episodes as if the members of the listening audience were themselves participants or inadvertent observers, eavesdropping on the story’s action. The first episode of UNKNOWN SENDER (1.1 If You’re Seeing this tape…) acknowledges the Quiet, Please connection via its opening music, Symphony in D minor by César Franck, the same piece used as the theme for every episode of Quiet, Please. Critical Reaction Unknown Sender has been well received by the public and the press alike, having garnered positive reviews from such outlets as TV Guide, The McClatchy Company, and tilzy.tv.

He played for Arbroath and Raith Rovers in Scotland before settling in the West Midlands in England playing for Aston Villa and Walsall. Arbroath McEwan started his career with East Craigie in the Scottish Junior Football Association set up in his birth town of Dundee. From there he joined the senior ranks signing for Arbroath in the second tier of the Scottish Football League. At Arbroath he hit what the club's history suggests is the fastest ever goal at their Gayfield stadium, scoring after 10 seconds against Dumbarton on 6 January 1951. He was managed by Arch Anderson and then Alec Cheyne. Raith Rovers In 1951 he moved up a division to join Raith Rovers in the Scottish top flight, a division they stayed in for all of that decade. McEwan and Raith ended their first season together with a fifth-place finish in the league. Raith reached the 1955-56 Scottish Cup semi final. They were eliminated in a replay by Heart of Midlothian who with Dave Mackay went on to beat Celtic in the final. In December of the same year Raith had their decade's most eye-catching single result when they beat Rangers 5–1 in Kirkcaldy. Raith appeared genuine title contenders for part of that season before finishing fourth, their best in McEwan's eight season at the club and their best since 1922. Their league form of that season was matched by a run to the 1956–57 Scottish Cup semi final. Again they were eliminated in a replay by the team who won the trophy, in this case the Falkirk team of Alex Parker. He was top scorer at Raith for three seasons from 1956-59. At different times McEwan played alongside Raith Hall of Famers Willie McNaught, Willie Penman, Willie Polland, Johnny Urquhart and Andy Young. When at Raith, he was selected to play for a Scottish Football League XI against a Scotland XI at Ibrox on 16 March 1959 in a trial match prior to Scotland playing against England at Wembley in the 1958–59 British Home Championship. The league side won 6–5, with McEwan providing a cross for the first of three goals by John White. McEwan was never selected for the full international side, or for the SFL team in an inter-league fixture. He left Raith at the end of that season. Aston Villa Aston Villa bought him in 1959. McEwan helped Villa win the Football League Division Two championship in his first season for promotion to England's top flight. Les Smith's achilles injury ultimately led to his retirement in 1960 opening a place on the team sheet at right wing. Given his chance, McEwan was an important player in attack at Villa teaming up well with Vic Crowe and Bobby Thomson. In one game Villa beat Charlton Athletic 11-1 at Villa Park in November 1959 with all five Villa forwards scoring including five by Gerry Hitchens. That same season Villa reached the 1959-60 FA Cup semi-final. In an all-West\n\n21\n\nMattenbach\n\nMattenbach is a district in the Swiss city of Winterthur. It is district number 7.

A complete, versatile and hard-working winger, known for his pace, stamina, offensive capabilities, distribution and technical skills, Donadoni was capable of playing on either flank, or even in the centre. Donadoni began his career with Atalanta, and he later became a pillar of the powerhouse Milan team of the late 1980s and early '90s, achieving notable domestic and international success during his time with the club. In his later career, he was also one of the pioneers of Major League Soccer, where he played two seasons for the NY/NJ MetroStars, ending his career with Saudi Premier League side Ittihad in 2000. At international level, Donadoni was also an important member of the Italy national team throughout the late 1980s and early '90s. He represented his country at the 1988 and 1996 European Championships, and at the 1990 and 1994 FIFA World Cups. With Italy, he reached the semi-finals of Euro 1988, and won bronze and silver medals at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups respectively. Following his playing career, Donadoni began a career as a manager in 2001, which included spells with Italian clubs Lecco, Livorno and Genoa. He was later appointed head coach of the Italy national team, succeeding Marcello Lippi, who resigned after having won the 2006 World Cup. At Euro 2008, with Donadoni as coach, Italy reached the quarter-finals of the tournament, losing to eventual champions Spain on penalties. On 26 June 2008, Donadoni was dismissed despite having signed a contract extension prior to the beginning of Euro 2008, using a clause in the contract which allowed termination if Italy did not reach the semi-final. He was replaced by Lippi, who returned as national team manager. Following his position as Italy head coach, Donadoni managed Napoli, Cagliari and Parma, until the latter club's bankruptcy in 2015. He then joined Bologna the following season. Club career Atalanta and Milan Donadoni started his career with Atalanta in 1982, winning the Serie C1 title, and the Serie B title in 1984. He joined Milan in 1986 and he became a mainstay in the legendary team that dominated Italy and Europe in the late 1980s and early-to-mid-1990s. Usually playing a right-sided wide midfield role, Donadoni was a vital part of Milan's squad under both Arrigo Sacchi and Fabio Capello, winning six Serie A titles, three European Cups, four Supercoppa Italiana, three European Super Cups, and two Intercontinental Cups during his time at Milan. Although Donadoni failed to win the Coppa Italia with Milan, he reached the final twice, during the 1989–90 and 1997–98 seasons. Donadoni came close to being one of a handful of players to ever die on-field, during the 1989–90 European Cup campaign in a match against Red Star Belgrade. He had his life saved only through the quick-thinking of Red Star's physiotherapist, who broke his jaw to make a passage for oxygen to reach his lungs after he had suffered a bad foul and\n\n25\n\nForever Breathes the Lonely Word\n\nForever Breathes the Lonely Word is the sixth album by English alternative rock band Felt, released in September 1986.

Dick. It was written sometime around 1975, but not published until 1987 when it was included in volume 5 (subtitled \"The Little Black Box\") of The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick, and has been reprinted since in other editions of this book such as the U.S. edition The Eye of the Sibyl and Other Stories . This is said to have been Dick's first piece of fiction for publication after his \"2-3-74\" experience that was the basis for his Exegesis, and later the novels VALIS, the posthumously published precursor to VALIS, Radio Free Albemuth, and The Divine Invasion. Eventually rejected by the venue for which it was written, the major points of Dick's 1975 worldview are set forth, in a style reminiscent of his earlier work, and very similar to his treatment of this material in his later books.

They are an example of a nondimensionalised design from which the desired filter can be scaled or transformed. They are most often seen in regard to electronic filters and especially linear analogue passive filters. However, in principle, the method can be applied to any kind of linear filter or signal processing, including mechanical, acoustic and optical filters. Filters are required to operate at many different frequencies, impedances and bandwidths. The utility of a prototype filter comes from the property that all these other filters can be derived from it by applying a scaling factor to the components of the prototype. The filter design need thus only be carried out once in full, with other filters being obtained by simply applying a scaling factor. Especially useful is the ability to transform from one bandform to another. In this case, the transform is more than a simple scale factor. Bandform here is meant to indicate the category of passband that the filter possesses. The usual bandforms are lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop, but others are possible. In particular, it is possible for a filter to have multiple passbands. In fact, in some treatments, the bandstop filter is considered to be a type of multiple passband filter having two passbands. Most commonly, the prototype filter is expressed as a lowpass filter, but other techniques are possible. __TOC__ Low-pass prototype The prototype is most often a low-pass filter with a 3 dB corner frequency of angular frequency ωc' = 1 rad/s. Occasionally, frequency f' ' = 1 Hz is used instead of ωc' = 1. Likewise, the nominal or characteristic impedance of the filter is set to R ' = 1 Ω. In principle, any non-zero frequency point on the filter response could be used as a reference for the prototype design. For example, for filters with ripple in the passband, the corner frequency is usually defined as the highest frequency at maximum ripple rather than 3 dB. Another case is in image parameter filters (an older design method than the more modern network synthesis filters) which use the cut-off frequency rather than the 3 dB point since cut-off is a well-defined point in this type of filter. The prototype filter can only be used to produce other filters of the same class and order. For instance, a fifth-order Bessel filter prototype can be converted into any other fifth-order Bessel filter, but it cannot be transformed into a third-order Bessel filter or a fifth-order Chebyshev filter. Frequency scaling The prototype filter is scaled to the frequency required with the following transformation: where ωc' is the value of the frequency parameter (e.g. cut-off frequency) for the prototype and ωc is the desired value. So if ωc' = 1 then the transfer function of the filter is transformed as: It can readily be seen that to achieve this, the non-resistive components of the filter must be transformed by: and, Impedance scaling Impedance scaling is invariably a\n\n31\n\nA.

Early life Hartley was born in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, the daughter of a Yorkshire solicitor and businessman who settled in the Fen country and successfully invested into bricks. She had an elder sister and a brother, the novelist L. P. Hartley. The family moved in 1908 to Peterborough. Norah studied at Cheltenham and Oxford University, graduating in literature with honours at the latter. Career As an adult Norah became fond of dogs.

Mandorlini joined Ascoli Allievi U17 team directly in 2006–07 season. Mandorlini spent 2008 to 2011 in the reserve league for Ascoli, which the last season was on loan from Vicenza. Ascoli–Vicenza swap On 29 June 2010, one day before the closure of 2009–10 financial year (on 30 June 2010), Ascoli and Vicenza made a swap deal, which saw Ivan Reali moved to Ascoli Piceno and Mandorlini moved to Vicenza. Both players were \"valued\" €800,000 and both clubs bought back 50% registration rights for half of the price (€400,000). Mandorlini signed a 4-year contract, costing Vicenza €200,000 a year as amortization (the way to book the transfer fee in capital accounts). The deal made both club had an immediately financial boost and speculative investment Mandorlini was immediately returned to Ascoli reserve in temporary deal. In June 2011 Mandorlini was sold to Vicenza outright, in exchange with Reali for the same price (€400,000).

It extends into the South Shore and Hyde Park nearby neighborhoods, bordering onto Lake Michigan and several other South Side neighborhoods. Named for Seventh President Andrew Jackson, it is one of two Chicago Park District parks with the name \"Jackson\", the other being Mahalia Jackson Park for the gospel music singer in the Auburn Gresham community on the far southwest side of Chicago. The parkland was first developed as the host site of the World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago World's Fair) in 1893, memorialized today by the Statue of The Republic. The Museum of Science and Industry resides in the remaining \"palace\" in the park from the Fair era, and a Japanese garden traces its history to the Fair. The park includes woodland trails, playing fields, a beach, a golf course, and a boat harbor. It is the potential future site of the Barack Obama Presidential Center and library. History Site of a World's Fair After the state legislature created the South Park Commission in 1869, the designers of New York's Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, were hired to lay out the park (which included the Midway Plaisance and Washington Park). Lois Willie explained in her book Forever Open, Clear, and Free, \"Olmstead said Jackson Park should be water oriented, with a yacht harbor, winding walkways around the lagoons, small bridges, bathing pavilions, and plenty of space for boating.\" However, their designs were not put into place at that time, and Jackson Park remained untouched until Chicago was chosen to host the World's Fair several years later. One of the landmarks that recalls the 1893 Columbian Exposition is the Statue of The Republic, only it is now a replica one-third the size of the original The Republic statue. The designers used the Statue of Liberty as inspiration when they were creating the original. Today the 1/3 size statue of The Republic stands at the site of the 1893 Expositions Administration Building. Known originally as \"South Park\", the landscape had eastern and western divisions connected by a grand boulevard named the Midway Plaisance. The eastern division became known as \"Lake Park\"; however, in 1880 the commission asked the public to suggest official names for both the eastern and western divisions. The names \"Jackson\" and \"Washington\" were proposed. In the following year, Lake Park was renamed \"Jackson Park\" to honor Andrew Jackson (1767–1845), the seventh president of the United States. In 1890, Chicago won the honor of hosting the World's Columbian Exposition. In 1891, Jackson Park was selected as its site. Olmsted and Chicago's architect and planner, Daniel H. Burnham, with his partner John Wellborn Root, laid out the fairgrounds. A team of architects and sculptors created the \"White City\" of plaster buildings and artworks in Beaux-Arts style. The historic World's Fair opened to visitors on May 1, 1893. It was Root's last project, as he caught pneumonia and died in January 1891, two years before\n\n40\n\nPower (Tower of Power album)\n\nPower is a studio album by Tower of Power released in 1987 on the A&M Records-distributed Cypress Records label.

It was released on August 19, 2008 through Inpop Records in the United States. The album's lead single \"A Breath or Two\" was released prior to the album, and reached No. 11 on Christian contemporary hit radio. Musical style Similar to his last album, Speak, Jimmy Needham has frequently been compared to Jason Mraz in musical style, as well as John Mayer and Marc Broussard. Not Without Love'''s main genre is alternative CCM, although Needham takes influence from other styles such as rock and blues with a \"jazzy pop\" sound. Lyrics The lyrical songwriting in Not Without Love has often been noted as having \"clever wordplay\" similar to pop/jazz musician Jason Mraz. Needham was newly married when writing the album, and two songs were written about his wife Kelly Needham. \"Firefly\" is a lighthearted, \"ragtime style\" song about marriage, while \"Unfailing Love (Kelly's Song)\" is a ballad that Needham sang at his wedding, originally written as a proposal to Kelly. Promotion and release In promotion of the album, Not Without Love's first single, \"A Breath or Two\", was released to radios in mid-2008. The album was subsequently released on August 19, 2008 in the U.S. under the Inpop label. It debuted at number 8 on both the Christian AC Soundscan and Overall Christian Digital charts. Later in the year, Needham guested on Christian rock band BarlowGirl's Million Voices Tour along with Brooke Barrettsmith; the tour began on September 12 in Houston, Texas, and ran until mid-November 2008. \"A Breath or Two\" also garnered success, reaching #13 on R&R's Christian CHR radio chart by the week of September 4, and reached a peak of at least #11 through early 2009. The album's second single, \"Forgiven and Loved\", was released early in the year near the same time. Reception Not Without Love'' received generally positive reviews from critics. AllMusic reviewer Jared Johnson noted that Jimmy Needham \"stepped up his game\" with his second release, having better production quality than his debut album; Johnson claimed that \"Christian music lovers need a lot more like this\".

Born in Stoke-on-Trent, Hewitt entered the pottery industry and joined the National Society of Pottery Workers (NSPW) when he was 15. He later moved to work in Scotland, remaining with the NSPW, where he became branch secretary, then district secretary and eventually full-time district organiser and a member of the executive council. In 1947, Hewitt was elected as the general secretary of the NSPW, relocating back to Stoke. He also served as a Labour Party member of Stoke-on-Trent City Council, as a magistrate, on the Midland Regional Board for Industry and the board of the North Staffordshire University College. The NSPW offered lower membership rates to women, but also paid lower benefits to them. Hewitt justified this, claiming that women in the industry did \"not have the same responsibilities\" as men. Hewitt was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress in 1952, and that year was also made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. He retired in 1964, and died four years later.

She was first transferred to Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden before being moved permanently to the Hong Kong Wetland Park on 15 August 2006. Fame and capture The saltwater crocodile has become a local celebrity since being spotted at Shan Pui River, Yuen Long on 2 November 2003. After several weeks of unsuccessful attempts by Australian crocodile hunter John Lever, and months of effort on the part of mainland Chinese experts to capture it, the reptile was trapped by Hong Kong's AFCD staff on 10 June 2004. The crocodile saga aroused wide public interest in wetland and wildlife conservation in Hong Kong. Name After a territory-wide naming contest with 1,600 entries, the crocodile was named \"Pui Pui\" – \"the precious one\", which is also a reference to Shan Pui River where it was found. In captivity She spent two years at Kadoorie Farm while her permanent home at the Hong Kong Wetland Park was being constructed. She moved to her home on 15 August 2006. After two weeks' observation in the indoor portion of her home, she was moved to the external pool where she could be visited by the public. Speaking after the arrival of the Pui Pui in the Wetland Park, the Hong Kong AFCD Assistant Director Mr Lay Chik-chuen said there was no need for people to rush to the Park to see her, as she was here to stay. \"As a celebrity croc, we believe Pui Pui's exhibition in the Wetland Park will promote public awareness of wetland conservation,\" he said. Hong Kong Wetland Park also sells stuffed crocodiles called \"Pui Pui\" as part of their merchandise. Pui Pui's Home On 29 August 2006 she was moved into her landscaped enclosure and can be easily viewed by the public. Pui Pui's Home was designed to provide the reptile with a healthy and comfortable living environment. The outdoor enclosure is about , of which 70% is pool area. With a maximum depth of one metre, the pool is landscaped with plants to provide sheltered areas, hiding places and basking areas for the reptile. Outdoor facilities include infra-red heaters, a heat pad and a weighing scale. Water in the pool is continuously circulated through a filtration system. Age and size Pui Pui was estimated to be about 4 years-old when she was captured in 2004, therefore suggesting that she was born in 2000. Measuring and weighing when she moved to her permanent home in August 2006, Pui Pui will grow to three metres when fully matured. The 72-square-meter outdoor enclosure in the Hong Kong Wetland Park is designed to accommodate her as she grows larger. Popular culture In October 2004 a bilingual children's book \"The Crocodile who wanted to be famous\" which is based on the life of Pui Pui was published by Sixth Finger Press and attracted widespread interest in both the Chinese and English media.

The sculpture was one of many commissions to decorate the villa of Bernini's patron Cardinal Scipione Borghese – where it still resides today, as part of the Galleria Borghese. It was completed in the course of seven months from 1623 to 1624. The subject of the work is the biblical David, about to throw the stone that will bring down Goliath, which will allow David to behead him. Compared to earlier works on the same theme (notably the David of Michelangelo), the sculpture broke new ground in its implied movement and its psychological intensity. Background Between 1618 and 1625 Bernini was commissioned to undertake various sculptural work for the villa of one of his patrons, Cardinal Scipione Borghese. In 1623 – only yet 24 years old – he was working on the sculpture of Apollo and Daphne, when, for unknown reasons, he abandoned this project to start work on the David. According to records of payment, Bernini had started on the sculpture by mid–1623, and his contemporary biographer, Filippo Baldinucci, states that he finished it in seven months. David was Scipione Borghese's last commission for Bernini. Even before it was finished, Bernini's friend and protector Maffeo Barberini was elected pope, as Pope Urban VIII. Subject matter The sculpture shows a scene from the Old Testament First Book of Samuel. The Israelites are at war with the Philistines whose champion, Goliath, has challenged the Israelite army to settle the conflict by single combat. The young shepherd David has just taken up the challenge, and is about to slay Goliath with a stone from his sling: David's clothing is typical of shepherd's attire. At his feet lies the armour of Israel's King, Saul, given to David for battle. The armor was shed, as David was unaccustomed to it and he can fight better without. At his feet is his harp, often included as an iconographic device of David in reference to David the Psalmist and being a talented harpist. Influences The biblical David was a popular subject among Renaissance artists and had been treated by sculptors such as Donatello (1440s), Verrocchio (1473-1475) and Michelangelo (1501-1504). Bernini's David, though engaging with these works, differed from them in some significant ways. For one thing, the sculpture is no longer self-contained, but interacts with the space around it. Not since the sculptures of the Hellenistic period, such as the Winged Victory of Samothrace, had sculptures been involved in their surroundings like those of Bernini. A likely source for Bernini's figure was the Hellenistic Borghese Gladiator. The motion of the gladiator preparing to attack is similar to how David is swinging his sling. Another difference lies in the moment that Bernini has chosen to depict. Michelangelo's David differs from those of Donatello and Verrocchio in that it shows David preparing for the battle, rather than victorious afterwards. Bernini, on the other hand, chose to portray David in the act of throwing the stone. This represented a novelty; throwing figures were extremely rare in post-Antiquity sculptures.

The village has about 5,000 inhabitants. Besides the village center, there are also three smaller hamlets on the territory, , Bikschote and Saint-Julien/Sint-Juliaan. Written as Langemarck on French, British and German maps, the village is known in military history as the scene (see trench map) of the first gas attacks by the German army in the western front, which marked the beginning of the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915. Before and during the First Battle of Ypres, the German reserve corps suffered enormous losses: over 10,000 young soldiers (some only 15 years old), led by young officers without practical experience, died without achieving any objective. On 10 November 1914, about 2,000 soldiers died during an attempted breakthrough. One day later, the German Command (Oberste Heeresleitung) published the following communiqué: Westlich Langemarck brachen junge Regimenter unter dem Gesange‚ Deutschland, Deutschland über alles‘ gegen die erste Linie der feindlichen Stellungen vor und nahmen sie. Etwa 2.000 Mann französischer Linieninfanterie wurden gefangengenommen und sechs Maschinengewehre erbeutet. In west Langemarck, youth regiments singing Germany, Germany Above All advanced on front line enemy positions, broke and took them. Approximately 2,000 French line infantry and six machine guns were captured. A popular and enduring myth of heroic self-sacrifice for the nation known as the \"Mythos von Langemarck\" arose from the propagandistic story. For this reason, the Flemish division of the Waffen-SS was named 27th SS Volunteer Division Langemarck. The village was completely destroyed during World War I. There is now a major German war cemetery, the Langemark German war cemetery, (Soldatenfriedhof) in this location, which has about 40,000 burials. Madonna's Pig Madonna is a hamlet of Langemark with about 1000 inhabitants. The movie Madonna's Pig is set in this hamlet, although in reality the movie was shot in Houtem.

The club was dissolved in 2018. The team is a former part of Saba Battery Club, owned by Saba Battery Co., and was moved to Qom in 2007, although they were formerly registered as a team from Tehran playing at Shahid Derakhshan Stadium of Robat Karim. Saba won the 2005 edition of the Hazfi Cup and the 2005 edition of the Iranian Super Cup. History Mohemmat sazi Football Club () was Iranian football club based in Tehran, Iran. They play in the 2nd Division. Establishment In 1974 a football called Mohemat Sazi was established in Tehran. The team never had any major success and only played in the lower leagues of the Iranian football league system. They came close to making it to Tehran's top football league in the 1980s. In the early 1990s the club was sponsored by a company named Maham. During the later stages of the club's history they were sponsored by Sanam, an electronics company. Takeover In 2002 the club's shares were sold to Saba Battery Company (also known as Niru Company) which is under the control of Iran's Ministry of Defense. Due to the club's greatly improved financial status the team was able to purchase talented players and were promoted to the Iran Pro League in 2004. Domestic Titles 2004–2005 In the first year of participation in Iran Pro League, Saba Battery managed to participate in the AFC Champions League for the first time ever, After becoming champions of the Hazfi Cup under Milan Živadinović. In the 2005 season Saba Battery also won the Iranian Super Cup, defeating Foolad the Iran Pro League champion 4–0. And until 2016 they remained the only team to have the title. 2006–2007 Although Saba Battery did not have a successful year in Iran Pro League, they were competitive in the Hazfi Cup. Saba Battery became Runners-up after losing to Sepahan 4–2 in aggregate, with Mohammad Hossein Ziaei. Since Sepahan became 5th in the Iran Pro League, that meant that Saba Battery won't be going to AFC Champions League. Iran Pro League The team debuted in the Iran Pro League in the 2004–05 season and made the headlines when they signed Iranian legend and FIFA all-time greatest international goalscorer Ali Daei from Persepolis. With the help of Daei the team was able to secure a berth for the Asian Champions League after winning the 2005 Hazfi Cup, however failing to make it out of their group. In the same year Saba won the Iranian Super Cup defeating league champions Foolad 4–0. After the departure of Ali Daei in 2006, Saba signed former Bosnia and Herzegovina international Alen Avdić as his replacement. In 2007 Saba once again made the final of the Hazfi Cup, this time losing 4–0 to Sepahan on aggregate. Move to Qom In 2008 Saba relocated to Qom because the city of Tehran had many football teams with low attendance figures. The team was renamed Saba Qom after the move.

Two stones are visible, known as 'Adam' and 'Eve' although the latter is more likely to have been a stone that formed part of the Beckhampton Avenue that connected with Avebury. The avenue probably terminated here although it may have extended further to the south west beyond the stones. William Stukeley recorded the site in the eighteenth century when it was only partially destroyed and suggested it extended further although modern excavation and archaeological geophysics have not confirmed this. Adam is the larger of the two stones, weighing an estimated 62 tons, and along with three others formed a four-sided cove. Excavations carried out jointly by the Universities of Leicester, Newport and Southampton University of Southampton in 2000 revealed the socket holes for the other stones which were tightly placed close to Adam. The cove had been open on its south eastern side which faced towards the nearby South Street barrow 130m away. The other stones were destroyed in the post-medieval period by a local landowner. Adam fell over in 1911 and was re-erected (incorrectly) by Maud Cunnington in 1912. Cunnington also found a Beaker inhumation of a middle-aged man buried close by the stone which is considered to postdate the megalith. In 1933 the stones were scheduled as an ancient monument.

Rebecca Zadig version \"Temptation\" was first recorded by Rebecca Zadig with additional lyrics and rendition vocals featuring Alex, the mononym of Alex Arash Labaf who started his career performing under his mononym Alex. The first version, had English as main vocals by Zadig featuring Alex that interpreted some additional Persian language lyrics. The song was launched with a separate music video that was directed and shot by Alec Cartio Arash version \"Temptation\" was rereleased as a song mainly in Persian language and this time credited Arash as the main vocalist and Rebecca Zadig was reduced to a featuring role with some refrain she sang in English. This release became the definitive version and was Arash's third successful consecutive single after \"Boro Boro\" (that had reached number 1 in Sweden) and \"Tike Tike Kardi\" (that had peaked at number 2 in Sweden). The song credited to Arash made it to number 2 on Sverigetopplistan, the official Swedish Singles Chart, also charting in Germany, Switzerland and Finland. A music video was released with Arash as lead singer.

It stars Robin Williams, Jerry Stiller and Joseph Wiseman, and is based on the novel of the same name by Saul Bellow, It was broadcast on the PBS \"Great Performances\" series in May 1987. Plot summary The story is set in 1956. After losing his job as a traveling salesman of children's furniture, Tommy Wilhelm leaves Massachusetts for New York City. He is under financial strain because of the financial demands of his wife, from whom he is separated. He moves into the same hotel housing his physician father, Dr. Adler, with who he has a strained relationship. Flashbacks show Tommy's past, how he moved to Los Angeles, changed his name, and tried to become an actor, which failed. His marriage failed because he left his wife, and he is estranged from their two sons. In New York, Tommy becomes involved with Dr. Tamkin, an acquaintance of his father who speculates in the commodities market. He agrees to open an account managed by Tamkin on a 50-50 basis, but Tamkin persuades Tommy to put up most of the money. When prices decline and Tommy wants to cash in the account, Tamkin urges Tommy to remain calm and \"seize the day.\" The commodities venture collapses, and he has lost his life savings and cannot even pay his hotel bill. His estranged wife is unsympathetic and his father refuses to help him or even provide emotional support. Tommy tries to find Tamkin, who has vanished. He winds up at a stranger's funeral, where he cries and is mistaken for a mourner. Cast Robin Williams as Tommy Wilhelm Jerry Stiller as Dr. Tamkin Joseph Wiseman as Dr. Adler Richard B. Shull as Rojax David Bickford as Son-in-Law Glenne Headly as Olive Stephen Strimpell as Stockbroker Katherine Borowitz as Margaret John Fiedler as Carl Jo Van Fleet as Mrs. Einhorn Allen Swift as Maurice Venice Production Williams' casting in the role was billed as a sharp departure from his previous comic roles, such as the TV series Mork and Mindy, though he had previously appeared in dramatic roles, including The World According to Garp. Williams described it as \"kind of like a Jewish Greek drama.\" The movie was filmed over a thirty-day period in New York City, longer than most television movies on commercial networks at the time but far shorter than the shooting schedule of a feature film. The film was blocked from theatrical release by Williams' management company. The San Francisco Examiner reported that the decision was made because the film was not like the comedies for which Williams was known. Reception Philadelphia Inquirer critic Ken Tucker praised the performances but wrote that the film was \"a little boring in its relentless depression.\" The director, he wrote, was \"all too willing to let a scene dawdle, the better to emphasize Tommy's torture.\" A San Francisco Examiner critic called the film a \"powerful drama\" and \"remarkably faithful reproduction\" of the Bellow novel, and praised the performances, calling Williams \"first rate.\" New York Times\n\n64\n\nProfessor Jay\n\nJoseph Haule (born December 29th 1975), popularly known by his stage name Professor Jay, is a Tanzanian politician, rapper, songwriter and member of the Tanzanian parliament for Mikumi constituency. He is one of the prominent representatives of the \"Bongo Flava\" Tanzanian hip hop subgenre, which mixes elements from both Western hip hop and the Tanzanian tradition (including swahili lyrics as well as an activist attitude towards Tanzanian social issues such as HIV/AIDS, wealth, inequality, and political corruption). Biography He started rapping in 1989 as a member of the group Hard Blasters, best known for their hit \"Chemsha Bongo\" (then he used stage name Nigga J) from their first album, \"Funga Kazi\". Only one year later, they won the title of best hip-hop group in Tanzania. During his solo career which started in 2001, he has released number of hits, including \"Nikusaidiaje\" and \"Zali la Mentali (feat Juma Nature)\". Other songs released by Professor Jay include \"Piga Makofi\" and \"Yataka Moyo\". Just like Mr. II, he is a pioneering Tanzanian MC, who have remained some of the most popular hip hop musicians in Tanzania, despite influx of many new bidders. Also similar to Mr. II and Deepac Braxx from (Kisii County) but who resides in Nairobi Kenya his lyrics often have political messages. In one of his songs he imitates an elder politician and ridicules the fake promises they all mindlessly spew as they are trying to get elected. The song continues with a chorus saying the words \"Ndio Mzee\" which means \"Yes Sir\". This represents the brainwashing of the public as politicians make these false promises over and over. However, after the song was released, the president of Tanzania referenced the lyrics in one of his speeches, which acknowledged the presence of Bongo Flava and the success of Professor Jay's political lyrics. His first album, \"Machozi, Jasho na Damu,\" gained instant recognition for which Professor Jay won several awards. He attained other awards such as the best hip-hop album in Tanzania with his second album, \"Mapinduzi halisi\". Professor Jay's songs include Nikusaidiaje (featuring Ferooz), Nimeamini (featuring Lady Jaydee), Inatosha (featuring Sugu), Vuta raha (featuring Ferooz), Border kwa border (featuring Nazizi), Heka heka za star, Interlude, J.O.S.E.P.H., Nisamehe (featuring Banana), Wapi nimakosea, Una, Hakuna Noma, Jina Langu, Bongo Dar es Salaam, Piga Makofi, Msinitenge, Kikao cha Dharura, Zali la Mentali, Nidivyo Sivyo, Mtazamo (featuring Afande Sele and Solo Thang), Hapo Sawa. Professor Jay is featured by Deepac Braxx (Heavyweight Mc) and Nonini's song \"Kumekucha\" His former group Hard Blasters is set for a comeback in 2009. The new lineup will consist of Professor Jay, Big Willy and Fanani. They will release a new album Politics At the 2015 Tanzanian general elections, Professor Jay successfully vied for Mikumi constituency parliamentary seat for CHADEMA Solo albums Machozi Jasho na Damu 2001 Mapinduzi Halisi 2003 J.O.S.E.P.H 2006 Aluta Continua 2007 Izack mangesho 2014 Kazi Kazi 2016 Awards Won 2004 Tanzania Music Awards (Kilimanjaro Music Awards)- Best Hip Hop Album (\"Mapinduzi Halisi\") 2006 Tanzania Music Awards - Best Song (Nikusaidiaje) 2006 Kisima Music Awards - Best Tanzanian\n\n65\n\nBirgit Pörner\n\nBirgit Pörner (born 20 March 1955) is a German volleyball player.
