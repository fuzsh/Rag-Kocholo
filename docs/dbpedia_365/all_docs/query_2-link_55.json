        "text": "SUMMARY OF TRUST RULE CHANGE:\n\nAs of April 1, 2024, the maximum insurance coverage for a trust owner with five or more beneficiaries is $1,250,000 per owner for all trust accounts (including POD/ITF, revocable, and irrevocable trusts) held at the same bank.\n\nDepositors can name as many beneficiaries as they wish, however the coverage limit will not exceed $1,250,000 as of April 1, 2024.\n\nThis coverage change applies to both existing and new trust accounts, for all deposit products, including CDs regardless of purchase or maturity date.\n\nYou can learn more about the new changes by reviewing this fact sheet.\n\nQuestions?\n\nYou can submit your inquiry using the FDIC Information and Support Center.\n\nYou can also call the FDIC at 1-877-275-3342 or 1-877-ASK-FDIC.\n\nYour Insured Deposits\n\nYour Insured Deposits is a comprehensive description of FDIC deposit insurance coverage for the most common account ownership categories.\n\nView brochure as a PDF\n\nOther Languages\n\nView brochure as a PDF - (Español)\n\nImportant information about this brochure\n\nYour Insured Deposits describes Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit insurance coverage for the most common accounts offered to consumers. Additional information about deposit insurance is available on the FDIC public website, www.fdic.gov, including Deposit Insurance at a Glance. If you have questions about your coverage, you can call the FDIC toll-free at 1-877-ASK-FDIC (1-877-275-3342). In addition, the FDIC Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (EDIE) is a simple tool that can help you calculate your deposit insurance coverage. It is available at https://edie.fdic.gov.\n\nDepositors should know that federal law expressly limits the amount of insurance the FDIC can pay to depositors when an insured bank fails, and no representation made by any person or organization can either increase or modify that amount.\n\nPlease Note: This brochure is not intended as a legal interpretation of the FDIC laws and regulations, nor is it intended to provide estate planning advice. Depositors seeking such assistance should contact a financial or legal advisor.\n\nThe information in this brochure is based on the FDIC laws and regulations in effect at publication. These rules can be amended. The online version of this brochure will be updated immediately if rule changes affecting FDIC insurance coverage are made.\n\nFor simplicity, this brochure uses the term âinsured bankâ to mean any bank or savings association that is insured by the FDIC. To check whether the FDIC insures a specific bank or savings association:\n\nCall the FDIC toll-free: 1-877-ASK-FDIC (1-877-275-3342)\n\nUse FDIC âBank Findâ at: https://banks.data.fdic.gov/bankfind-suite/bankfind\n\nLook for the FDIC official sign where deposits are received\n\nBeginning January 1, 2025, look for the FDIC official digital sign on bank websites, bank applications, and, where applicable, certain bank ATMs.\n\nWhat is the FDIC?\n\nThe FDICâshort for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationâis an independent agency of the United States government. The FDIC protects depositors of insured banks located in the United States against the loss of their deposits, if an insured bank fails.\n\nAny person or entity can have FDIC insurance coverage in an insured bank. A person does not have to be a U.S. citizen or resident to have his or her deposits insured by the FDIC.\n\nFDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Since the FDIC began operations in 1934, no depositor has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits.\n\nFDIC Insurance Coverage Basics\n\nFDIC insurance covers depositor accounts at each insured bank, dollar-for-dollar, including principal and any accrued interest through the date of the insured bankâs closing, up to the insurance limit.\n\nFDIC insurance covers deposits received at an insured bank, but does not cover investments, even if they were purchased at an insured bank.\n\nThe FDIC Insures:\n\nChecking Accounts\n\nNegotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) Accounts\n\nSavings Accounts\n\nMoney Market Deposit Accounts (MMDAs)\n\nTime Deposits, such as certificates of deposit (CDs)\n\nCashier's Checks, Money Orders, and other official items issued by a bank\n\nThe FDIC Does Not Insure:\n\nStock Investments\n\nBond Investments\n\nMutual Funds\n\nCrypto Assets\n\nLife Insurance Policies\n\nAnnuities\n\nMunicipal Securities\n\nSafe Deposit Boxes or their contents\n\nU.S. Treasury Bills, Bonds, or Notes*\n\n*These investments are not insured by the FDIC, but they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\nThe standard maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.\n\nThe FDIC insures deposits that a person holds in one insured bank separately from any deposits that the person owns in another separately chartered insured bank. For example, if a person has a certificate of deposit at Bank A and has a certificate of deposit at Bank B, the accounts would each be insured separately up to $250,000. Funds deposited in separate branches of the same insured bank are not separately insured.\n\nThe FDIC provides separate insurance coverage for funds depositors may have in different categories of legal ownership. The FDIC refers to these different categories as âownership categories.â This means that a bank customer who has multiple accounts may qualify for more than $250,000 in insurance coverage, if the customerâs funds are deposited in different ownership categories and the requirements for each ownership category are met.\n\nOwnership Categories\n\nThis section describes the following FDIC ownership categories and the requirements a depositor must meet to qualify for insurance coverage above $250,000 at one insured bank.\n\nSingle Accounts\n\nCertain Retirement Accounts\n\nJoint Accounts\n\nTrust Accounts\n\nEmployee Benefit Plan Accounts\n\nCorporation/Partnership/Unincorporated Association Accounts\n\nGovernment Accounts\n\nSingle Accounts\n\nA Single Account is a deposit owned by one person with no beneficiaries. This ownership category includes:\n\nAn account held in one personâs name only, with no beneficiaries\n\nAn account established for one person by an agent, nominee, guardian, custodian, or conservator, including Uniform Transfers to Minors Act Accounts, Escrow Accounts, and Brokered Deposit Accounts (See section on Pass-through Accounts for more information).\n\nAn account held in the name of a business that is a sole proprietorship (e.g., a âDoing Business Asâ [or DBA] account)\n\nAn account established for or representing a deceased personâs funds–commonly known as a Decedentâs Estate Account\n\nAn account that fails to qualify for separate coverage under another ownership category\n\nIf an account title identifies only one owner, but another person has the right to withdraw funds from the account (e.g., as Power of Attorney or custodian), the FDIC will insure the account as a Single Account.\n\nThe FDIC adds together the balances in all Single Accounts owned by the same person at the same bank and insures the total up to $250,000.\n\nNote on Beneficiaries: If the owner of a Single Account has designated one or more beneficiaries who will receive the deposit when the account owner dies, the account would be insured as a Trust Account.\n\nExample 1: Single Account\n\nAccount Title Deposit Type Account Balance Marci Jones MMDA $15,000 Marci Jones Savings $20,000 Marci Jones CD $200,000 Marci's Memories (A Sole Proprietorship) Checking $25,000 Total $260,000 Amount Insured $250,000 Amount Uninsured $10,000\n\nExplanation\n\nMarci Jones has four Single Accounts at the same insured bank, including one account in the name of her sole proprietorship. The FDIC insures deposits owned by a sole proprietorship as a Single Account of the business owner. The FDIC combines the four accounts, which equal $260,000, and insures the total balance up to $250,000, leaving $10,000 uninsured.\n\nCertain Retirement Accounts\n\nDeposits in a retirement account are insured under the Certain Retirement Accounts ownership category only if the account qualifies as one of the following:\n\nIndividual Retirement Account (IRA):\n\nTraditional IRA\n\nRoth IRA\n\nSimplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA\n\nSavings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA\n\nSelf-directed defined contribution plan account:\n\nSelf-directed 401(k) plan\n\nSelf-directed SIMPLE IRA held in the form of a 401(k) plan\n\nSelf-directed defined contribution profit-sharing plan\n\nSelf-directed Keogh plan account (or H.R.10 plan account) designed for self-employed individuals\n\nSection 457 deferred compensation plan account, such as an eligible deferred compensation plan provided by state and local governments, regardless of whether the plan is self-directed\n\nThe FDIC adds together all deposits in retirement accounts listed above owned by the same person at the same insured bank and insures the total amount up to a maximum of $250,000. Beneficiaries can be named on these accounts, but that does not increase the amount of the deposit insurance coverage.\n\nâSelf-directedâ means that plan participants have the right to direct how the money is invested, including the ability to direct that deposits be placed at an FDIC-insured bank.\n\nThe FDIC considers an account to be self-directed, if a retirement plan participant has the right to choose a particular bankâs deposit accounts as an option. For example:\n\nIf a plan has deposit accounts at a particular insured bank as its default option, then the FDIC would deem the plan to be self-directed for insurance coverage purposes because, by inaction, the participant has directed the placement of such deposits.\n\nIf a plan consists only of a single employer/employee, and the employer establishes the plan with a single option of deposit accounts at a particular insured bank, then the plan would be considered self-directed for insurance coverage purposes.\n\nThe following types of deposits do not qualify as Certain Retirement Accounts:\n\nA plan for which the only investment vehicle is the deposit accounts of a particular bank, so that participants have no choice of investments.\n\nDeposit accounts established under Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (annuity contracts for certain employees of public schools, tax-exempt organizations and ministers), which are insured as Employee Benefit Plan accounts.\n\nDefined benefit plan deposits (plans for which the benefits are determined by an employeeâs compensation, years of service, and age), which are insured as Employee Benefit Plan accounts.\n\nDefined contribution plans that are not self-directed, which are insured as Employee Benefit Plan Accounts.\n\nExample 2: Certain Retirement Accounts\n\nAccount Title Account Balance Bob Johnson's Roth IRA $180,000 Bob Johnson's Traditional IRA $75,000 Total $255,000 Amount Insured $250,000 Amount Uninsured $5,000\n\nExplanation\n\nBob Johnson has two different types of retirement accounts that qualify as Certain Retirement Accounts at the same insured bank. The FDIC adds together the deposits in both accounts, which equal $255,000. The FDIC insures the total balance of Bobâs deposits in these certain retirement accounts up to $250,000, which leaves $5,000 of his deposits uninsured.\n\nJoint Accounts\n\nA Joint Account is a deposit owned by two or more people with no beneficiaries. FDIC insurance covers joint accounts owned in any manner conforming to applicable state law, such as joint tenants with right of survivorship, tenants by the entirety, and tenants in common.\n\nTo qualify for insurance coverage under this ownership category, all of the following requirements must be met:\n\nAll co-owners must be living people. Legal entities such as corporations, trusts, estates, or partnerships are not eligible for joint account coverage.\n\nAll co-owners must have equal rights to withdraw deposits from the account. For example, if one co-owner can withdraw deposits on his or her signature alone, but the other co-owner can withdraw deposits only with the signature of both co-owners, the co-owners would not have equal withdrawal rights.\n\nAll co-owners have personally signed, which may include signing electronically, a deposit account signature card, or alternatively, the insured bank has information in its deposit account records establishing co-ownership of the account. This requirement does not apply to CDs or accounts established by an agent, nominee, guardian, custodian, executor, or conservator.\n\nIf all of these requirements are met, each co-ownerâs shares of every joint account that he or she owns at the same insured bank are added together and the total is insured up to $250,000.\n\nThe FDIC assumes that all co-ownersâ shares are equal unless the deposit account records state otherwise.\n\nThe balance of a Joint Account can exceed $250,000 and still be fully insured. For example, if the same two co-owners jointly own both a $350,000 CD and a $150,000 savings account at the same insured bank, the two accounts would be added together and insured up to $500,000, providing up to $250,000 in insurance coverage for each co-owner. This example assumes that the two co-owners have no other joint accounts at the bank (either together or with any other individuals).\n\nInsurance coverage of joint accounts is not increased by rearranging the ownersâ names or Social Security numbers, or changing the styling of their names.\n\nAlternating the use of âor,â âandâ or âand/orâ to separate the names of co-owners in a joint account title, also does not affect the amount of insurance coverage provided.\n\nNote on Beneficiaries: If the co-owners of a jointly held account have designated one or more beneficiaries who will receive the deposit when the co-owners die, the account would be insured as a Trust Account.\n\nExample 3: Joint Accounts\n\nAccount Title Deposit Type Account Balance Share Per Owner Mary and John Smith MMDA $230,000 $115,000 Mary or John Smith Savings $250,000 $125,000 Mary or John or Robert Smith CD $270,000 $90,000 Total $750,000\n\nInsurance Coverage for Each Owner is Calculated as Follows:\n\nOwners Total of All Ownership Shares Amount Insured Amount Uninsured Mary $330,000 $250,000 $80,000 John $330,000 $250,000 $80,000 Robert $90,000 $90,000 0 Total $750,000 $590,000 $160,000\n\nExplanation\n\nThe total amount in each joint account is divided by the number of co-owners.\n\nMary's ownership share in all joint accounts equals ½ of the MMDA account ($115,000), ½ of the savings account ($125,000), and &frac13; of the CD ($90,000), for a total of $330,000. Since her coverage in the joint account ownership category is limited to $250,000, $80,000 is uninsured.\n\nJohn's ownership share in all joint accounts is the same as Mary's, so $80,000 of John's deposits is uninsured.\n\nRobert's ownership share in all joint accounts equals &frac13; of the CD, or $90,000, so his share is fully insured.\n\nTrust Accounts\n\nTrust Accounts are deposits held by one or more owners under either an informal revocable trust (e.g., Payable on Death (POD) and In Trust For (ITF) accounts), a formal revocable trust, or an irrevocable trust. Other non-testamentary trust arrangements (e.g., Interest on Lawyersâ Trust Accounts [IOLTAs]) are addressed in the Pass-through Insurance section of this brochure.\n\nIMPORTANT: As of April 1, 2024, the maximum insurance coverage for a trust owner with five or more beneficiaries is $1,250,000 per owner. This coverage change applies to both existing and new trust accounts, including CDs (regardless of maturity date). Depositors can name as many beneficiaries as they wish, however the coverage limit will not exceed $1,250,000 as of April 1, 2024, regardless of the maturity date or the date the CD was purchased.\n\nFor Trust Accounts, the term âownerâ also means the grantor, settlor, or trustor of the trust. If a trust has more than one owner, each ownerâs insurance coverage is calculated separately.\n\nTrust Accounts include:\n\nInformal Revocable Trusts â often called payable on death, Totten trust, in trust for, or as trustee for accountsâ are created when the account owner signs a deposit account agreement, directing the bank to transfer the funds in the account to one or more named beneficiaries upon the ownerâs death.\n\nFormal Revocable Trusts - known as living or family trusts â are written trusts created for estate planning purposes. The owner controls the deposits and other assets in the trust during his or her lifetime. The agreement establishes that the deposits are to be paid to one or more identified beneficiaries upon the ownerâs death. These trusts typically become irrevocable upon the ownerâs death.\n\nIrrevocable Trusts are deposit accounts held in connection with a trust established by statute or a written trust agreement in which the owner contributes deposits or other property to the trust and gives up all power to cancel or change the trust. An Irrevocable Trust also may come into existence upon the death of an owner of a formal revocable trust. (Deposit insurance coverage for irrevocable trust deposits is calculated in the same manner as revocable trust deposits. The rules no longer consider contingencies or the grantorâs retained interest.)\n\nCoverage and Requirements for Trust Accounts\n\nIn general, each owner of a Trust Account(s) is insured up to $250,000 per unique (different) eligible beneficiary, up to a maximum of $1,250,000 for five or more beneficiaries. A trust (either revocable or irrevocable) must meet all of the following requirements to be insured under the trust accounts category.\n\nTitle Indicates Trust Relationship (for formal trusts only). For formal trust accounts, including revocable and irrevocable trusts, the account title at the bank must indicate that the account is held pursuant to a trust relationship. This requirement can be met by using the terms such as living trust, family trust, irrevocable trust, or any similar language, including simply having the word âtrustâ in the account title. The account title includes information contained in the bankâs electronic deposit account records.\n\nFor informal revocable trusts (e.g., POD accounts), the account title may include POD/ITF or similar language, but it is no longer required.\n\nBeneficiaries Identified. For informal revocable trusts, the beneficiaries must be named in the deposit account records of the bank. For formal trust accounts, both revocable and irrevocable, beneficiaries must be identified in the formal trust document. For a formal trust agreement, it is acceptable for the trust to use language such as âmy issueâ or other commonly used legal terms to describe the designated beneficiaries, provided the specific names and number of eligible beneficiaries can be determined. The FDIC does not limit the number of beneficiaries a depositor may identify on a trust at a depository institution for trust accounts even if there are more than five beneficiaries. However, coverage is limited to $250,000 per beneficiary up to a maximum of $1,250,000 as described below.\n\nBeneficiaries Eligibility. To qualify as an eligible beneficiary, for purposes of deposit insurance coverage, a beneficiary must be a living person, a charity, or a non-profit organization. If a charity or non-profit organization is named as a beneficiary, it must qualify as such under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations. Please note if a single owner names the same beneficiary on multiple trust accounts at the same bank, that beneficiary only counts once when determining coverage.\n\nTrust Deposit Insurance Coverage\n\nA trust ownerâs trust deposits are insured for $250,000 for each eligible beneficiary, up to a maximum of $1,250,000 if five or more eligible beneficiaries are named. This limit applies to the combined interests of all beneficiaries the owner has named in revocable and irrevocable trust accounts at the same bank.\n\nIf a trust has more than one owner, each ownerâs insurance coverage is calculated separately. Deposit insurance coverage for each trust owner is determined by multiplying $250,000 times the number of eligible beneficiaries, regardless of the dollar amount or percentage allotted to each beneficiary, with an overall maximum insurance amount of $1,250,000 for five or more beneficiaries.\n\nA trust owner can identify as many beneficiaries as they like; however, for deposit insurance purposes, a trust account owner that identifies five or more eligible beneficiaries will not be insured beyond $1,250,000 per bank. In calculating coverage, a beneficiary only counts once per owner, even if the same beneficiary is included multiple times on trust accounts at the same bank.\n\nMaximum Insurance Coverage per Trust Owner:\n\nNumber of Unique Beneficiaries Maximum Deposit Insurance Coverage 1 Beneficiary $250,000 2 Beneficiaries $500,000 3 Beneficiaries $750,000 4 Beneficiaries $1,000,000 5 or More Beneficiaries $1,250,000\n\nWhen calculating coverage for Trust Accounts, the FDIC uses the formula:\n\n# of Owners x # of Beneficiaries x $250,000 = Amount Insured\n\n(not to exceed $1,250,000 per owner for all trust accounts)\n\nExample 4: Multiple Trust Accounts, five or more beneficiaries\n\nAccount Title Owner Beneficiaries Deposit Type Account Balance John Jones (living trust) John Jack, Janet, Ron, Sue, Bob MMDA $10,000 John Jones POD John Jack, Janet Savings $20,000 John Jones (irrevocable charitable trust) John IRS-recognized charity CD $1,250,000 Total $1,280,000 Amount Insured $1,250,000 Amount Uninsured $30,000\n\nExplanation\n\nJohn Jones has three trust accounts â one formal revocable trust, one informal revocable trust, and one irrevocable trust at the same insured bank. Between these three trust accounts, John has named six eligible beneficiaries (five different people and a charity). Even though six beneficiaries are named, the maximum insurance coverage is calculated as follows: 1 owner x 5 beneficiaries x $250,000 = $1,250,000. John Jones has $30,000 uninsured because his total balance is $1,280,000, which exceeds the insurance limit by $30,000.\n\nFDIC regulations do not limit the number of beneficiaries that a trust owner identifies for their estate planning purposes. (In this example, John Jones identified six.) However, when calculating insurance coverage, a trust ownerâs per-bank insurance limit for trust accounts is maximized when they identify five eligible beneficiaries.\n\nExample 5: Multiple Trust Accounts\n\nAccount Number Account Owner(s) Account Beneficiaries Account Balance 1 Paul & Lisa Li (Living Trust) John & Sharon Li $700,000 2 Lisa Li (POD) Sharon & Bill Li $450,000\n\nOwners Beneficiaries Share Insured Uninsured Paul John, Sharon $350,000 $350,000 $0 Lisa John, Sharon, Bill $800,000 $750,000 $50,000 Total $1,150,000 $1,100,000 $50,000\n\nExplanation\n\nEach ownerâs share of each trust account is added together and each owner receives up to $250,000 of insurance coverage per eligible beneficiary.\n\nPaulâs share: $350,000 (50% of Account 1)\n\nLisaâs share: $800,000 (50% of Account 1 and 100% of Account 2)\n\nBecause Paul named two eligible beneficiaries, his maximum insurance coverage is $500,000 ($250,000 x 2 beneficiaries). Since his share of Account 1 ($350,000) is less than $500,000, he is fully insured.\n\nBecause Lisa has named three eligible beneficiaries between Accounts 1 and 2, her maximum insurance coverage is $750,000 ($250,000 x 3 beneficiaries). Since her share of both accounts ($800,000) exceeds $750,000, she is uninsured for $50,000.\n\nIf you have a more complex trust structure, please contact the FDIC at 1-877-275-3342.\n\nLife Estate Beneficiaries\n\nAn owner who identifies a beneficiary as having a life estate interest in a formal revocable trust is entitled to insurance coverage up to $250,000 for that beneficiary. A life estate beneficiary is a beneficiary who has the right to receive income from the trust or to use trust deposits during the beneficiaryâs lifetime, where other beneficiaries receive the remaining trust deposits after the life estate beneficiary dies.\n\nFor example, a husband is the sole owner of a living trust that gives his wife a life estate interest in the trust deposits, with the remainder going to their two children upon his wifeâs death.\n\nMaximum insurance coverage for this account is calculated as follows: 1 owner x $250,000 x 3 different beneficiaries = $750,000.\n\nEmployee Benefit Plan Accounts\n\nAn Employee Benefit Plan account is a deposit of a pension plan, defined benefit plan, or other employee benefit plan that is not self-directed. An account insured under this category must meet the definition of an employee benefit plan in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, with the exception of plans that qualify under the Certain Retirement Account ownership category. The FDIC does not insure the plan itself, but insures the deposit accounts owned by the plan.\n\nAdditional requirements for coverage:\n\nThe investment and management decisions relating to the account must be controlled by a plan administrator (not self-directed by the participant).\n\nThe plan administrator must maintain documentation supporting the plan and the beneficial interest of the participants.\n\nThe account must be properly titled as an employee benefit account with the bank.\n\nWhen all of these requirements are met, the FDIC will insure each participantâs interest in the plan up to $250,000, separately from any accounts the employer or employee may have in the same FDIC-insured institution. The FDIC often refers to this coverage as âpass-through coverage,â because the insurance coverage passes through the employer (agent) that established the account to the employee who is considered the owner of the funds.\n\nEven when plans qualify for pass-through coverage, insurance coverage cannot be determined simply by multiplying the number of participants by $250,000 because plan participants frequently have different interests in the plan.\n\nTo determine the maximum amount a plan can have on deposit in a single bank and remain fully insured, the plan administrator must first identify the participant who has the largest share of the plan assets, and calculate the participantâs share as a percentage of overall plan assets. Then, the plan administrator must divide $250,000 by that percentage to arrive at the maximum fully insured amount that a plan can have on deposit at one bank.\n\nExample 6: Employee Benefit Plan that Qualifies for Pass-Through Coverage\n\nThe Happy Pet Vet Clinic has a profit-sharing plan for its employees\n\nAccount Balance Happy Pet Vet Clinic Benefit Plan $700,000\n\nPlan Participants Plan Share Share of Deposit Amount Insured Amount Uninsured Dr. Todd 35% $245,000 $245,000 $0 Dr. Jones 30% $210,000 $210,000 $0 Tech Evans 20% $140,000 $140,000 $0 Tech Barnes 15% $105,000 $105,000 $0 Plan Total 100% $700,000 $700,000 $0\n\nExplanation\n\nThis employee benefit plan's $700,000 deposit is fully insured. Because Dr. Todd's share of the $700,000 deposit (35% of $700,000 = $245,000) is less than $250,000. All of the other participants' shares of the deposit also are less than $250,000. Therefore, the entire deposit is insured.\n\nTo determine the maximum amount this employee benefit plan can deposit at one bank and ensure all of the funds are fully covered, divide $250,000 by the percentage share of the plan participant with the largest interest in the plan. In this example, the maximum fully insured balance for this plan is $714,285. This amount is calculated as follows: $250,000 divided by 35% or 0.35 = $714,285.\n\nPlan participants who want to know more about how an employee benefit plan's deposits are insured should consult with the plan administrator.\n\nHealth and Welfare Plans\n\nEmployee benefit plan deposits that do not qualify for pass-through coverage, such as health and welfare plans, are insured up to $250,000 per bank. Health and welfare plans usually do not qualify for pass-through coverage because the interests of the participants are not ascertainable. A participant will receive payments from the plan based on claims he or she files independent of any specific ownership interest in the plan.\n\nCorporation/Partnership/Unincorporated Association Accounts\n\nDeposits owned by corporations, partnerships, and unincorporated associations, including for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, as well as âSubchapter S,â âLimited Liability (LLC),â and \"Professional (PC)\" Corporations are insured under the same ownership category. Such deposits are insured separately from the personal deposits of the organization's owners, stockholders, partners or members.\n\nUnincorporated associations typically insured under this category include churches and other religious organizations, community and civic organizations and social clubs.\n\nTo qualify for insurance coverage under this ownership category, a corporation, partnership or unincorporated association must be engaged in an \"independent activity,\" meaning that the entity is operated primarily for some purpose other than to increase deposit insurance coverage.\n\nAll deposits owned by a corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association at the same bank are combined and insured up to $250,000.\n\nAccounts owned by the same corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association but designated for different purposes are not separately insured.\n\nFor example, if a corporation has both an operating account and a reserve account at the same bank, the FDIC would add both accounts together and insure the deposits up to $250,000. Similarly, if a corporation has divisions or units that are not separately incorporated, the FDIC would combine the deposit accounts of those divisions or units with any other deposit accounts of the corporation at the bank and the total would be insured up to $250,000.\n\nThe number of partners, members, stockholders or account signatories established by a corporation, partnership or unincorporated association does not affect insurance coverage.\n\nFor example, the FDIC insures deposits owned by a homeowners' association at one insured bank up to $250,000 in total, not $250,000 for each member of the association.\n\nSole Proprietorship\n\nAccounts held in the name of a sole proprietorship are not insured under this ownership category. Rather, they are insured as the Single Account deposits of the owner, added to the owner's other Single Accounts, if any, at the same bank and the total insured up to $250,000.\n\nGovernment Accounts\n\nThe category known as Government Accounts (also called Public Unit accounts) includes deposit accounts owned by:\n\nThe United States, including federal agencies\n\nAny state, county, municipality (or a political subdivision of any state, county or municipality), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and other government possessions and territories\n\nA Native American tribe\n\nInsurance coverage of a Government Account is unique in that the insurance coverage extends to the official custodian of the deposits belonging to the government or public unit, rather than to the government unit itself.\n\nAccounts held by an official custodian of a government unit will be insured as follows:\n\nIn-state accounts:\n\nUp to $250,000 for the combined amount of all time and savings accounts (including NOW accounts)\n\nUp to $250,000 for the combined amount of all interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts (since July 21, 2011, banks have been allowed to pay interest on demand deposit accounts)\n\nOut-of-state accounts:\n\nUp to $250,000 for the combined amount of all deposit accounts\n\nNegotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) Account\n\nA Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) account is a savings depositânot a demand deposit account.\n\nTo learn more about deposit insurance coverage for Government Accounts, see the FDICâs Fact SheetâDeposit Insurance for Accounts Held by Government Depositors at: www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/accounts-government-depositors/index.html\n\nPutting It All Together: Using Multiple Ownership Categories\n\nThe FDIC provides separate insurance coverage for a depositorâs funds at the same insured bank, if the deposits are held in different ownership categories. To qualify for this expanded coverage, the requirements for insurance coverage in each ownership category must be met.\n\nThe example below illustrates how a husband and wife with three children could qualify for up to $3,500,000 in FDIC coverage at one insured bank. This example assumes that the funds are held in qualified deposit products at an insured bank and these are the only accounts that the family has at the bank.\n\nNote: This example is intended solely to describe the use of different account ownership categories and not to provide estate planning advice.\n\nExample 7: Insurance Coverage for a Husband and Wife with Deposit Accounts in Multiple Ownership Categories\n\nTitle Account Ownership Category Owner(s) Beneficiaries Maximum Insurable Amount Husband Single Account Husband $250,000 Wife Single Account Wife $250,000 Husband & Wife Joint Account Husband & Wife $500,000 Husband POD Trust Account Husband Wife $250,000 Wife POD Trust Account Wife Husband $250,000 Husband & Wife Formal Revocable Trust Trust Account Husband & Wife Child 1,\n\nChild 2,\n\nChild 3 $1,500,000 Husband IRA Certain Retirement Account Husband $250,000 Wife IRA Certain Retirement Account Wife $250,000 Total $3,500,000\n\nExplanation\n\nSingle Account Ownership Category\n\nThe FDIC combines all single accounts owned by the same person at the same bank and insures the total up to $250,000. The Husbandâs single account deposits do not exceed $250,000 so his funds are fully insured. The same facts apply to the Wifeâs single account deposits. Both accounts are fully insured.\n\nJoint Account Ownership Category\n\nHusband and Wife have one joint account at the bank. The FDIC combines each co-ownerâs shares of all joint accounts at the bank and insures each co-ownerâs total up to $250,000. The Husbandâs ownership share in all joint accounts at the bank equals Â½ of the joint account (or $250,000), so his share is fully insured. The Wifeâs ownership share in all joint accounts at the bank equals Â½ of the joint account (or $250,000), so her share is fully insured.\n\nTrust Accounts Ownership Category\n\nTo determine insurance coverage for trust accounts, the FDIC first determines the amount of the trustâs deposits belonging to each owner. In this example:\n\nHusbandâs share = $1,000,000 (100% of the Husbandâs POD account naming Wife as beneficiary and 50% of the Husband and Wife Living Trust account identifying Child 1, Child 2, and Child 3 as beneficiaries)\n\nWifeâs share = $1,000,000 (100% of the Wifeâs POD account naming Husband as beneficiary and 50% of the Husband and Wife Living Trust account identifying Child 1, Child 2, and Child 3 as beneficiaries)\n\nSecond, the FDIC determines the number of beneficiaries for each owner. In this example, each owner has four unique beneficiaries (Spouse, Child 1, Child 2, and Child 3). When a trust owner names five or fewer unique beneficiaries, the owner is insured up to $250,000 for each unique beneficiary. The Husbandâs share of the revocable trust deposits is insured up to $1,000,000 ($250,000 x 4 beneficiaries = $1,000,000). The Wifeâs share of the revocable trust deposits is insured up to $1,000,000 ($250,000 x 4 beneficiaries = $1,000,000).\n\nAll three trust accounts are fully insured.\n\nCertain Retirement Accounts Ownership Category\n\nThe FDIC adds together all certain retirement accounts owned by the same person at the same bank and insures the total up to $250,000. The Husband and Wife each have an IRA deposit at the bank with a balance of $250,000. Because each account is within the insurance limit, the funds are fully insured.\n\nUnique Ownership Scenarios\n\nPass-Through Deposit Insurance Coverage\n\nâPass-throughâ deposit insurance is a method of insuring depositors whose funds are placed and held at an FDIC-insured bank through a third party. Third parties in pass-through arrangements may include, but are not limited to:\n\nParent acting as guardian for a minor child\n\nLawyer or law firm holding client funds (IOLTA)\n\nExecutors, estate administrators, or other similar roles\n\nAgents, custodians, nominees, trustees (other than trustees of revocable or irrevocable trusts), or fiduciaries\n\nCompanies that offer financial products or services through partnerships or arrangements with FDIC-insured banks\n\nBrokers who offer brokered CDs\n\nCompanies that place their customersâ funds into different banks to help customers maximize their deposit insurance coverage\n\nIf the following requirements are satisfied, the deposited funds would be insured to the same extent as if deposited at the bank in the name of the underlying owner(s):\n\nA relationship providing a basis for pass-through coverage is expressly disclosed in the bankâs deposit account records. This is often accomplished through account titling indicating that a deposit account is held, for example, as agent or for the benefit of others.\n\nThe identity and ownership interest of each owner is ascertainable from the bankâs deposit account records or records maintained by the third party (or another person or entity that has agreed to maintain records on its behalf).\n\nThe underlying owners, rather than the third party that maintains the account at the insured bank, actually own the funds.\n\nThe FDIC determines whether these requirements are satisfied at the time of an insured bankâs failure.\n\nDeposits insured on a pass-through basis are added to any other deposits that the owner holds in the same deposit insurance category at the same bank for purposes of the deposit insurance limit. For example, if a broker purchases a CD for a single owner at an insured bank, and that person maintains a separate checking account in the Single Account category at the same bank, the two balances would be added together and insured for up to $250,000 in the Single Account category.\n\nHealth Savings Accounts\n\nWhat is a Health Savings Account?\n\nA Health Savings Account (HSA) is an IRS qualified tax-exempt trust or custodial deposit that is established with a qualified HSA trustee, such as an FDIC-insured bank, to pay or reimburse a depositor for certain medical expenses.\n\nHow does the FDIC insure an HSA?\n\nAn HSA, like any other deposit, is insured based on who owns the funds and whether beneficiaries have been named. If a depositor opens an HSA and names beneficiaries either in the HSA agreement or in the bankâs records, the FDIC would insure the deposit under the Trust Account category. If a depositor opens an HSA and does not name any beneficiaries, the FDIC would insure the deposit under the Single Account category. For an HSA established by an employer for employees, the FDIC would insure the HSA as an Employee Benefit Plan Account.\n\nHow should an HSA be titled?\n\nThe identification of a deposit as an HSA, such as âJohn Smithâs HSA,â is sufficient for titling the deposit to be eligible for Single Account or Trust Account coverage, depending on whether eligible beneficiaries are named.\n\nMortgage Servicing Accounts\n\nWhat is a Mortgage Servicing Account?\n\nMortgage Servicing Accounts are accounts maintained by a mortgage servicer, in a custodial or other fiduciary capacity, which are composed of payments by mortgagors (borrowers) of principal and interest (P&I).\n\nHow does the FDIC insure Mortgage Servicing Accounts?\n\nThe account is insured to the mortgage investors for the cumulative balance paid into the account by borrowers, or in order to satisfy borrowersâ principal or interest obligations to the lender, up to $250,000 per mortgagor. The calculation of coverage for each P&I account is separate if the mortgage servicer or mortgage investor has established multiple P&I accounts in the same bank.\n\nFor example, a mortgage servicer collects from 1,000 different borrowers their monthly mortgage payments of $2,000 (P&I) and places the funds into a mortgage servicing account. The $2,000,000 aggregate balance in the mortgage servicing account is fully insured to the lender because each borrowerâs payment of $2,000 (P&I) is insured separately for up to $250,000.\n\nAlthough mortgage servicers often collect tax and insurance (T&I), these accounts are separately maintained and not considered mortgage servicing accounts for deposit insurance purposes. T&I deposits belong to the borrowerâs pending payment of their real estate taxes and/or property insurance premium to the taxing authority or insurance company. The T&I deposits are insured on a âpass-throughâ basis to the borrowers.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nBank Changes\n\nWhat happens to my deposits if my bank fails?\n\nIn the unlikely event of a bank failure, the FDIC acts quickly to protect insured deposits by arranging a sale to a healthy bank, or by paying depositors directly for their deposit accounts to the insured limit.\n\nIf the FDIC finds a bank to acquire the failed bank, it will try to arrange a Purchase and Assumption Transaction, under which a healthy bank acquires the insured deposits of the failed bank. Insured depositors of the failed bank immediately become depositors of the acquiring bank and have access to their insured funds. The acquiring bank may also purchase loans and other assets of the failed bank.\n\nIt is important for account owners to note that their deposit contract was with the failed bank and is considered void upon the failure of the bank. The acquiring institution has no obligation to maintain either the failed bank rates or terms of the account agreement. Depositors of a failed bank, however, do have the option of either setting up a new account with the acquiring institution or withdrawing some or all of their funds without penalty.\n\nIf the FDIC cannot find a bank to acquire the failed bankâs deposits, the FDIC will pay the depositors directly by check up to the insured balance in each account. Such payments usually begin within a few days after the bank's closing.\n\nWhat happens to my insurance coverage if I have deposits at two insured banks that merge?\n\nWhen two or more insured banks merge, deposits from the assumed bank are separately insured from deposits at the assuming bank for at least six months after the merger. This grace period gives a depositor the opportunity to restructure his or her accounts, if necessary.\n\nCDs from the assumed bank are separately insured until the earliest maturity date after the end of the six-month grace period. CDs that mature during the six-month period and are renewed for the same term and in the same dollar amount (either with or without accrued interest) continue to be separately insured until the first maturity date after the six-month period. If a CD matures during the six-month grace period and is renewed on any other basis, it would be separately insured only until the end of the six-month grace period.\n\nNote that in situations of a bank failure where a depositor already has deposits at the acquiring bank, the six-month grace period described would also apply to their deposits.\n\nDeath of Account Owners and Beneficiaries\n\nWhat happens to insurance coverage after an account owner dies?\n\nThe FDIC insures a deceased personâs accounts as if the person were still alive for six months after the death of the account holder. During this grace period, the insurance coverage of the ownerâs accounts will not change unless the accounts are restructured by those authorized to do so. Also, the FDIC will not apply this grace period, if it would result in less coverage.\n\nHow does the death of a beneficiary of an informal revocable trust (e.g., POD account) affect insurance coverage?\n\nThere is no grace period if the beneficiary of a POD account dies. In most cases, insurance coverage for the deposits would be reduced immediately.\n\nFor example, a mother deposits $500,000 in a POD account at an insured bank with her two children named as the beneficiaries in the account records of the bank. While the owner and both beneficiaries are alive, the account is insured up to $500,000 ($250,000 x 2 beneficiaries = $500,000). If one beneficiary dies, insurance coverage for the motherâs POD account is immediately reduced to $250,000 ($250,000 x 1 beneficiary = $250,000).\n\nHow does the death of a beneficiary of a formal revocable trust affect the insurance coverage?\n\nLike informal revocable trusts, the six-month grace period does not apply to the death of a beneficiary named in a formal revocable trust account. However, the terms of the formal revocable trust may provide for a successor beneficiary or some other redistribution of the trust deposits. Depending on these terms, the insurance coverage may or may not change."
