        "text": "Most of the products, services, and technologies that fall within the scope of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are not specifically controlled for export, and are given the classification of EAR99. They fall under U.S. Department of Commerce jurisdiction and are not listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL). EAR99 items generally consist of low-technology consumer goods and do not require a license in most situations.\n\nEAR99 items can generally be exported without a license but exporters of EAR99 items still need to perform careful due diligence to ensure the item is not going to an embargoed or sanctioned country, a prohibited end-user, or used in a prohibited end-use. If your proposed export of an EAR99 item is to an embargoed country, to an end-user of concern, or in support of a prohibited end-use, you may be required to obtain a license.\n\nAn ECCN (short for Export Control Classification Number), is a designation that an item, which can be a tangible or intangible (i.e., software or technology), is controlled because of its specific performance characteristics, qualities, or designed-end use. Unlike an EAR99 designation, which is a broad basket category, an ECCN is much more narrowly defined and are focused on product categories. An ECCN is a five-digit alphanumeric designations that categorize items based on the nature of the product, i.e. type of commodity, software, or technology and its respective technical parameters. An example of an ECCN is 0A979, which corresponds to police helmets and shields.\n\nAn ECCN is enumerated on the CCL, and each one lists important information that includes a general description of the controlled item(s), the reason(s) for control, available license exceptions, and, when necessary, additional details on related controls, and more specific item definitions. Learn more by viewing the link on how to determine your ECCN.\n\nFor additional information on EAR99 and ECCN designations, visit the Bureau of Industry and Securityâ€™s website at www.bis.doc.gov"
