        "text": "Getting Started\n\nCOMcheck-Web™ is accessible directly from the website without having to download and install.\n\nCommercial Compliance Using COMcheck™\n\nThe COMcheck software product group makes it easy for architects, builders, designers, and contractors to determine whether new commercial or high-rise residential buildings, additions, and alterations meet the requirements of the IECC and ASHRAE Standard 90.1, as well as several state-specific codes. COMcheck also simplifies compliance for building officials, plan checkers, and inspectors by allowing them to quickly determine if a building project meets the code.\n\nCOMcheck Support\n\nHave a compliance question or need assistance with the software? BECP's team of building energy codes experts is available to answer specific questions submitted through our web-based help desk.\n\nTechnical Support Document for Version 3.9.1 of the COMcheck Software\n\nUpdates to REScheck and COMcheck Building Energy Code Compliance Software\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is directed to provide technical assistance to states to support the implementation of model residential and commercial building energy codes (42 USC 6833). As part of this assistance, the DOE Building Energy Codes Program provides ongoing support for REScheck and COMcheck compliance software, which are updated based on new editions of the model codes. DOE has published guidance surrounding its support for the software, including technical assistance requests for modified versions.\n\nLegacy COMcheck Desktop Version\n\nNotice: Support for the 2021 IECC Commercial Code was added to COMcheck-Web on June 16, 2022. Note that it will not be added to COMcheck Desktop -- all new Codes moving forward will only be added to COMcheck-Web as eventually the Desktop version will become unsupported.\n\nCOMcheck™ Desktop for Windows® may be downloaded and installed directly to your desktop.\n\nDownload via the link at the bottom of the right sidebar.\n\nSee if your state or county can use COMcheck to show compliance.\n\nView a list of supported software versions for code compliance tools."
