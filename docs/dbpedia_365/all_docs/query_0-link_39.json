        "text": "This is a list of notable theatrical feature films produced by Walt Disney Productions and its successor label, Walt Disney Pictures. The Disney features produced before The Living Desert (1953) were originally distributed by United Artists and RKO Radio Pictures, and have since been distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (originally known at the time as Buena Vista Film Distribution and then Buena Vista Pictures Distribution). The list also includes films produced by other studios including Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Regency Enterprises (beginning in 2019) which - despite neither being co-produced with nor co-branded with \"Disney\" - also distributed under the Walt Disney Pictures banner (without the Disney logo or being credited) through Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures since 2012. Additionally, it also includes Searchlight Pictures films that is only distributed under the Walt Disney Pictures banner through its Buena Vista International label, due to the autonomous distribution unit held by Searchlight in the United States only. The list also includes the UK theatrical re-releases of some of the Disney animated classics between August and October 2023, likely as part of Disney's 100th anniversary celebration. It also includes independent films produced by international co-partners, including Pathé (until 2020).\n\nFilms not on this list[]\n\nIf Walt Disney Productions did not produce the film and only distributed a film, it is not included on this list. This list also does not include films labelled, produced, or distributed by other Disney imprints or subsidiaries, including Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures, and Miramax Films (unless they are credited as co-production partners) and does not include any direct-to-video releases nor theatrical re-releases in the US (except for those from 20th Century Studios [including international re-releases] and Lucasfilm).\n\nKey[]\n\nKey to the colors used below Type of film A Animated feature films (List) H Hybrid films with live action and animation L Live-action films N True-Life Adventures / Disneynature documentary films D Other documentary films\n\n1930s - 40s[]\n\nTitle US Release Notes A Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons May 19, 1937 A Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs December 21, 1937 First film to be distributed by RKO Radio Pictures.

However, while Searchlight Pictures retained its autonomous distribution unit in the US, Walt Disney Pictures only distribute Searchlight films overseas (such as the UK) through the Buena Vista International label - with the exception of The Personal History of David Copperfield, which was distributed in the UK by Lionsgate Films; while not owned by Disney; in partnership with Channel 4 before Disney later holds non-UK rights during 2020 following its release in Britain.\n\nStarting in 2023, Lucasfilm began co-producing the films with Walt Disney Pictures (e.g. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny) and it may be likely to co-produce the films each other for the foreseeable future. However, it is currently unknown whenever Marvel Studios and 20th Century Studios would follow suit at this stage.\n\nSome films were removed from Disney+ on May 26, 2023 as part of the cost-cutting measures set out by Disney that day.\n\nReferences[]\n\nReflist\n\nSee also[]"
