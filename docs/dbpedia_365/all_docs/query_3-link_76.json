        "text": "Although the study of early cinema continues to evolve, over the past several decades some core and enduring methods and concerns have emerged that help to define the contours of a relatively distinct field of research. Broadly, “early” cinema includes the period of international film history spanning from around 1890 through 1915, that is, from the emergence of motion pictures as a “new” medium to the large-scale institutionalization of narrative feature filmmaking practices. The periodization has strong roots in the 1978 International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF) conference, which brought together scholars and archivists who were interested in significantly reimagining the relevance of the cinema’s early years to film studies as a discipline. The conference hosted some seminal conversations that would eventually develop into several unifying discourses that are central to the field and that concern the following in a variety of ways:\n\nOrigins: There is a general investment in rethinking teleological histories that bracket off the early years of film as a “primitive” period relative to the feature filmmaking industry that developed in the teens. Included in this is an understanding that the cinema has multiple so-called origins, some of which place “film” in genealogies of media and what André Gaudreault has called “cultural series” that span centuries.\n\nThe Archive: There is a strong commitment to collaborations between film scholars and archivists, and to archival-based research—using film prints and other primary source materials—especially research at the margins of canonical film histories, that seeks to understand, for example, early cinema’s diverse economic, industrial, aesthetic, exhibition, and reception contexts on their own terms.\n\nIntermediality: There is a strong interest in studying early cinema as part of a broader constellation or network of media, practices, and institutions with which fin-de-siècle motion pictures shared affinities, including vaudeville, amusement parks, world’s fairs, the magic theatre, popular science shows, and department stores, to name a few.\n\nEducation: Much scholarly work on early cinema has helped to bring the once-marginalized field seriously within the purview of cinema and media studies. There is thus a related effort to promote not only scholarly research on this period but also rigorous and innovative approaches to teaching it.\n\nWith its interest in the longue durée and in placing the cinema in a broader intermedial context, the field of early cinema studies has strong affinities with the study of early popular visual culture, media archaeology, and histories of “pre-” or “proto-” cinematic media from chronophotography to the magic lantern and shadow plays. Among the many questions that research in this area engages are, How did fin-de-siècle audiences receive the new medium in light of existing media? Where did the cinema make its home before the stabilization of the film industry? What impact did motion pictures have on other media, institutions, and modern life? And, equally important, In what ways is early cinema relevant to our contemporary moment? Exploring answers to these and countless other questions remains an ongoing and fruitful endeavor.\n\nBibliography\n\n(This is meant to be neither exhaustive nor canonical but rather a place to begin.)\n\nRichard Abel, The Ciné goes to town (University of California Press, 1994).\n\nRichard Abel, The Red Rooster Scare: Making Cinema American (University of California Press, 1999).\n\nRichard Abel, Americanizing the Movies and “Movie-Mad” Audiences, 1910-1914 (University of California Press, 2006).\n\nRichard Abel (ed.), Encyclopedia of Early Cinema (Routledge, 2013).\n\nRichard Abel, Menus for Movieland: Newspapers and the Emergence of American Film Culture, 1913-1916 (University of California Press, 2015).\n\nRichard Abel & Rick Altman (eds), Global Experiments in Early Synchronous Sound (Film History 11.4, 1999) —DOMITOR 1998.\n\nRichard Abel & Rick Altman (eds), The Sounds of Early Cinema (Indiana University Press/ John Libbey Publishing, 2001) —DOMITOR 1998.\n\nRichard Abel, Giorgio Bertellini & Rob King (eds), Early Cinema and the “National” (Indiana University Press/ John Libbey Publishing, 2008) —DOMITOR 2006.\n\nRick Altman, Silent Film Sound (Columbia University Press, 2004).\n\nKristen Anderson Wagner, Comic Venus: Women and Comedy in American Silent Film (Wayne State University Press, 2018).\n\nKaveh Askari, Scott Curtis, Frank Gray, Louis Pelletier, Tami Williams & Joshua Yumibe (eds), Performing New Media, 1890-1915 (Indiana University Press/ John Libbey Publishing, 2014) —DOMITOR 2012.\n\nJohn Barnes, The Beginnings of the Cinema in England, 1894-1901 (University of Exeter Press, 1996, 5 vols).\n\nBernard Bastide, Aux sources du cinéma en Camargue: Joë Hamman et Folco de Baroncelli (Palais du Roure, 2018).\n\nAdam Begley, The Great Nadar : The Man Behind the Camera (New York: Tim Duggan Books, 2017).\n\nEileen Bowser, The Transformation of Cinema 1907-1915 (University of California Press, 1990).\n\nMarta Braun, Picturing Time: The Work of Etienne-Jules Marey (University of Chicago Press, 1992).\n\nMarta Braun, Charlie Keil, Rob King, Paul Moore & Louis Pelletier (eds.), Institutions, Networks, and Publics of Early Cinema (Indiana University Press/ John Libbey Publishing, 2012) —DOMITOR 2010.\n\nFrançois de la Bretèque (ed.), Les cinémas périphériques dans la période des premiers temps / Peripheral Early Cinema (Presses universitaires de Perpignan, 2010) —DOMITOR 2008.\n\nNoël Burch, Life to Those Shadows (University of California Press, 1990).\n\nFrancesco Casetti, Eye of the Century: Film, Experience, Modernity (Columbia University Press, 2005).\n\nLisa Cartwright, Screening the Body: Tracing Medicine’s Visual Culture (University of Minnesota Press, 1995).\n\nC.W.
