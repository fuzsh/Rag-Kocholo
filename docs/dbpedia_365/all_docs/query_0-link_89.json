        "text": "Related Topics:\n\nSales, Use & Excise Tax\n\nThis is intended as a general guide, and is not an all-inclusive discussion of Iowa sales and use tax law.\n\nIowa law imposes both a sales tax and a use tax. The rate for both is 6%, though an additional 1% applies to most sales subject to sales tax, as many jurisdictions impose a local option sales tax. There is no local option use tax.\n\nBoth sales tax and use tax are applied to the sales price from sales of tangible personal property, specified digital products, and taxable services. The difference between the two taxes is the circumstances under which the taxes are imposed.\n\nSales Tax\n\nSales tax is imposed on the sales price of the sale of tangible personal property, specified digital products, or taxable services at the time the sale takes place. The seller of the goods or services is responsible for collecting, reporting, and remitting the sales tax. The tax is imposed when the first use of a service occurs, or potentially could occur, in Iowa, or when the tangible personal property or specified digital product is delivered in Iowa.\n\nUse Tax\n\nUse tax on taxable purchases\n\nUse tax is most often imposed after the sale takes place and only on goods and services on which sales tax was not collected. In many cases, these are purchases made from an out-of-state supplier not collecting Iowa sales tax on goods or services that are for use in Iowa. Ordinarily, the retailer is responsible for collection of the tax, but if the retailer is not required by law to collect the tax or the retailer fails to do so, the purchaser is then responsible for remitting use tax. The purchaser becomes responsible for remitting use tax when the purchaser takes ownership or control of the good or service. A retailer is not required by law to collect Iowa sales tax if the retailer does not have physical or economic nexus with Iowa, meaning the retailer has no physical presence in Iowa and has not generated $100,000 or more in gross revenue from sales into Iowa in the current or prior calendar year.\n\nAnyone – individuals and businesses – who makes these types of purchases is required to pay use tax. Persons owing $1,200 or more in use tax per year on taxable goods or services must register with the Department for a sales and use tax permit and report the tax as “taxable purchases” in the use tax section of the sales and use tax return. Persons who do not have a sales and use tax permit and who do not regularly make purchases subject to use tax or who owe less than $1,200 in use tax per year may report their tax on the Iowa Non-Permit Use Tax Return. Businesses should review all purchases to determine if the vendor collected the proper tax. Businesses that fail to do so may find themselves with a use tax liability, plus penalty and interest, for not reporting the use tax in a timely manner.\n\nSales subject to use tax\n\nRetailers that do not have physical or economic nexus in Iowa, but make sales into Iowa, may collect and remit the use tax that would be due on behalf of their customers. Retailers who do this should report the tax as “sales subject to use tax” in the use tax section of the sales and use tax return.\n\nExamples of Purchases Subject to Use Tax\n\nAn Iowa business purchases furniture and office supplies from an out-of-state vendor in another state who is not registered and does not collect Iowa sales or use tax. The business uses the items. The business owes Iowa use tax.\n\nAn Iowa resident purchases clothing, stereo equipment, or jewelry through a mail order catalog and is not charged Iowa sales tax by the mail order company. The resident owes use tax to Iowa.\n\nAn Iowa resident who sends jewelry or watches out of Iowa for repair will owe use tax on the repair costs – both materials and labor – if the out-of-state vendor is not registered to collect Iowa tax and if no tax is paid to the other state. (Jewelry and watch repair are taxable services.)\n\nAn Iowa business has a vehicle repaired out of state. If the out-of-state vendor did not collect tax on the transaction, then Iowa use tax is due upon the vehicle's return to Iowa. (Vehicle repair is a taxable service.)\n\nAn Iowa resident sends tangible personal property out of state to be repaired. The repair service is not taxable in Iowa. The resident owes use tax on only the materials furnished and used in the repair if the materials are separately itemized on the bill. If the materials and nontaxable services are not separately itemized, then tax is due on the entire invoiced amount. Separately itemized delivery charges are not taxable.\n\nView Iowa Sales and Use Permits\n\nPermit Requirements\n\nRetailers that sell taxable tangible personal property, services, and products in or into Iowa must obtain a sales and use tax permit. Learn more about permit requirements and whether you need to collect sales or use tax. Businesses that make taxable purchases without paying sales tax may also need to obtain a sales and use tax permit to remit use tax on those taxable purchases.\n\nIf a person makes retail sales from more than one location, each location from which taxable sales of tangible personal property, specified digital products, or services will occur shall be required to hold a permit.\n\nTo obtain a permit, apply through the Department's Business Registration System.\n\nSeason Filers, Temporary Businesses, and Event Sponsors\n\nThe Department does not issue temporary tax permits. A permanent tax permit allows you to conduct taxable sales or perform taxable services in Iowa at any time during the year. You may request to be a seasonal return filer if you only make sales in Iowa for 4 or less months each year.\n\nSponsors of flea markets, craft shows, antique shows, and other temporary events may be liable for the sales tax, penalty, and interest of the retailers selling at the event. When you attend a temporary event, such as a craft show, you may only need to provide the event sponsor with your name and address, along with your permanent tax permit number if the event sponsor is responsible for collecting and remitting tax for sales made at the event. If the event sponsor does not collect and remit tax, you may be liable. Read more about special events and check with your event sponsor before the event to determine if you need a permit.\n\nDirect Pay Permit\n\nSome qualified purchasers, users, and consumers of tangible personal property or taxable services may remit the tax directly to the Department rather than to their suppliers. Learn more about Direct Pay Permits.\n\nNot sure whether you need a permit? Contact the Department.\n\nIowa is a member of the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board (Streamlined), a multi-state effort to encourage businesses in all states to collect and remit sales tax in every state in which they make taxable sales. Streamlined operates a free registration system for businesses looking to register in any or all of the 24 Streamlined member states.\n\nIf a corporation, association, or partnership fails to pay sales and use taxes, the officers or partners are personally liable for the tax, interest, and penalty due.\n\nA person selling a business must file final tax returns and pay all taxes due. However, the new owner should withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase price to pay any unpaid tax, interest, and penalty in case the seller fails to pay the final tax due. If the new owner intentionally fails to do this, the new owner is personally liable for the tax.\n\nIf possession of tangible personal property or a specified digital product is taken in another state and sales tax has already been paid to the other state, no additional tax is due if the tax paid is the same or more than Iowa's state rate. If the tax is less, the purchaser owes Iowa the difference. It is the purchaser’s responsibility to show where delivery took place and that the appropriate sales tax has been paid.\n\nState Sales and Use Tax\n\nThe state sales tax and use tax rates are the same. The rate is 6%.\n\nView the Sales Tax Rate Chart (79-106)\n\nLocal Option Sales Tax\n\nIn addition to the state sales tax, most local jurisdictions impose a local option sales tax. The rate is 1%.\n\nWithin a county, some cities may have the local option tax and some may not. Also, the unincorporated rural area of a county may or may not have the tax. A jurisdiction may enact the tax on January 1 or July 1.\n\nFor more information, including lists of jurisdictions with a local option sales tax, see Iowa Local Option Tax Information.\n\nIn transactions where the retailer should have collected state sales tax and local option sales tax but did not, the retailer is still liable for the uncollected local option sales tax, even if the purchaser remits use tax.\n\nHotel and Motel Tax\n\nCertain cities and counties in Iowa have adopted a local option hotel and motel tax on the renting of sleeping rooms in any hotel, motel, inn, public lodging house, rooming house, tourist court, mobile home, bed and breakfast, or in any place where sleeping accommodations are furnished to transient guests for rent. This is in addition to the 5% state excise tax on lodging.\n\nThe rate of local hotel and motel tax can range from 1 to 7%. Jurisdictions and rates are updated January 1 and July 1 of each year.\n\nThe 5% state excise tax and local hotel and motel tax are reported and remitted on the monthly sales and use tax return. No permit other than an Iowa sales and use tax permit is required to collect and report these taxes.\n\nSee Iowa Hotel and Motel Tax Common Questions\n\nMotor Vehicle Fee for New Registration\n\nPurchases\n\nSales of vehicles subject to registration are exempt from sales tax, but are subject to a 5% fee for new registration.\n\nSee Iowa Vehicle Purchase and Lease Information and Forms\n\nLeases\n\nA leased vehicle is subject to the fee for new registration if:\n\nIt has a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 16,000 pounds and\n\nIt is to be leased for a period of 12 months or more\n\nThe 5% fee is computed on each lease transaction based on the lease price. The lease price includes the number of months of the lease multiplied by the monthly lease payments, plus certain adjustments.\n\nSee Iowa Vehicle Purchase and Lease Information and Forms\n\nAutomobile Rental Tax\n\nThe rental of automobiles for a period of 60 days or less is subject to an automobile rental tax of 5%. This is in addition to the state sales tax and any applicable local option tax.\n\nThe tax applies to vehicles designed to carry nine or fewer passengers. It does not apply to motorcycles, motorized bicycles, or delivery trucks designed to carry cargo.\n\nThe automobile rental tax is reported and remitted on the monthly sales and use tax return. No permit other than an Iowa sales and use tax permit is required to collect and report this tax.\n\nSee Vehicle Rental - Sales, Use, and Automobile Rental Tax\n\nConstruction Equipment Tax\n\nA 5% tax is imposed on the sales price of all equipment, as defined by Iowa Code section 423D.1, sold or used in Iowa. This tax is reported and remitted on the monthly sales and use tax return. No permit other than an Iowa sales and use tax permit is required to collect and report this tax.\n\nThe basis for Iowa sales tax is the sales price of tangible personal property or taxable services.\n\n“Sale price” means the total amount of consideration for which personal property or services are sold, leased, or rented. \"Purchase price\" means the same as sales price.\n\n\"Consideration\" includes cash, credit, property, and services.\n\nSales price also includes any charges by a seller for any services necessary to complete a sale.\n\nThis includes credit card processing or transaction fees on taxable sales.\n\nA credit card processing fee does not fall under any of the exceptions to the definition of sales price. A credit card processing fee is included in the total amount of consideration paid for goods or services. Additionally, Iowa Administrative Code rule 701-203.2 states: \"[w]hen interest and other types of additional charges are added as a condition of a sale in order to obtain title rather than as a charge to obtain credit where title to goods has previously passed, such charges will be subject to tax even though they may be separately stated.\" The credit card fee is an additional charge to customers in order to receive the goods or services.\n\nA credit card processing or transaction fee on a nontaxable sale is not itself subject to tax.\n\nExcluded from a transaction’s sales price are certain charges:\n\nDiscounts\n\nInterest, finance, or carrying charges\n\nOther taxes\n\nCharges for items that are separately contracted for, itemized on a receipt, and are not representative of a taxable sale, such as delivery or installation service charges\n\nSales of tangible personal property in Iowa are subject to sales tax unless exempted by state law.\n\nSales of services are exempt from Iowa sales tax unless taxed by state law.\n\nThe retailer must add the tax to the price and collect the tax from the purchaser. The retailer cannot indicate that the sales tax is being “absorbed.”\n\nA retailer may include the tax in the price, but must post a notice or make a statement on the invoice that the purchase price includes the sales tax. This is typically done when selling alcoholic beverages or admissions to movie theaters or sporting events.\n\nSales tax is applied and due when the first use of taxable services occurs, or potentially could occur, or when taxable goods are delivered, and not when payment is received from the customer.\n\nIt is important to file the sales and use tax return and pay the tax by the due date to avoid penalty and interest. A return must be filed with zeros if a business does not have sales or taxable purchases to report.\n\nFile and Pay Online\n\nIowa sales and use tax returns are filed electronically through GovConnectIowa. Learn more.\n\nDue Dates\n\nIf the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday as defined in Iowa code 421.9A, then the due date is the following day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. If filing on paper, the postmark date is accepted as the filing date.\n\nFiling Frequencies and Return Due Dates.\n\nNon-Permit Use Tax Returns:\n\nPersons without a sales and use tax permit who owe less than $1,200 in tax per year on purchases subject to use tax should pay their tax in one of the following ways:\n\nElectronically\n\nComplete the Iowa Non-Permit Use Tax Return (32-007) and send to:\n\nIowa Department of Revenue\n\nPO Box 10412\n\nDes Moines, IA 50306-0412\n\nMake check payable to: “Iowa Department of Revenue”\n\nA sales and use tax permit holder is required to file a return on either a monthly or annual basis. When applying for a permit, a retailer estimates the amount of sales or use tax to be collected. Local option tax collections are not included in the amount. The filing frequency is based on the estimated tax to be collected.\n\nSee Filing Frequencies and Return Due Dates.\n\nChanging the filing frequency\n\nThe filing frequency may need to be changed if tax collections increase or decrease substantially over multiple filing periods. Retailers can request a filing frequency change by logging into their GovConnectIowa account and submitting a Filing Frequency Change request or by submitting an Iowa Business Tax Change (92-033). In addition to this, the Department may change the filing frequency.\n\nReturns must be filed as usual until the filing frequency is changed. The change is usually effective at the beginning of the next tax period.\n\nGoods Consumed\n\n“Goods consumed” are items originally purchased tax free for resale or to be incorporated into a product for resale, but they were used in the course of business or for personal use instead. Sales tax is due on these purchases.\n\nExample\n\nA hair salon purchases bottles of shampoo to be sold out of a display case. The salon did not pay sales tax to its supplier since it intended to resell the shampoo. However, several bottles were used by the salon in the performance of their service. The shampoo that was used is goods consumed. The salon must report the price it paid to its supplier on the goods consumed line of the return and pay tax on it.\n\nExample\n\nA clothing store purchases suits tax free for resale. The owner of the store needs a new suit. The suit removed from inventory is goods consumed. The price the owner paid to the supplier must be reported, and the tax must be paid.\n\nExample (not goods consumed)\n\nA person who makes craft items to be sold at craft shows does not pay sales tax to suppliers for materials. These materials are incorporated into the craft items to be sold. They are not goods consumed and should not be reported as such.\n\nExemptions\n\n\"Exemptions\" are sales made by you on which tax was not required to be charged. Exemptions are not the same as deductions on income tax returns. Business expenses are not included as exemptions on the sales and use tax return.\n\nThe following should be reported as gross sales and then included in exemptions on the return.\n\nInterstate Commerce:\n\nSales made where delivery occurred outside Iowa.\n\nNew Construction:\n\nSales of taxable services performed on or in connection with new construction, reconstruction, alteration, expansion, or remodeling of a building or structure. (This does not include sales to contractors who have a special “exempt entity” exemption certificate. These sales are shown in the “Other” category.)\n\nIndustrial Machinery and Equipment:\n\nSales of exempt industrial machinery and equipment. This includes qualifying items used directly and primarily in processing by a manufacturer.\n\nResale:\n\nSales of items that will be resold in their present form by the purchaser.\n\nProcessing:\n\nSales of items that will be incorporated into another item for resale by the purchaser.\n\nResidential Utility:\n\nSales of metered gas, electricity, and fuel used as energy in residential dwellings. (You do not need exemption certificates to support this exemption.) Note: These sales are subject to local option tax.\n\nSales Tax Holiday:\n\nSales of qualifying clothing and footwear during the annual sales tax holiday. (You do not need exemption certificates to support this exemption.) The annual tax holiday is the first Friday and Saturday in August.\n\nOther:\n\nAny exempt sales made during the period that do not fall into any of the previous categories. Keep a record of this category, including a brief description of the item.\n\nLocal Option Sales Tax (LOST)\n\nFilers complete a separate section of the return to report local option sales tax. Everyone with a taxable amount other than zero must complete the Local Option Sales Tax Schedule, even if no local option tax is due.\n\nTax Included in the Price\n\nIf sales tax is included in the selling price of the item or service, the tax needs to be backed out to arrive at the true gross receipts.\n\nIf only the state sales or use tax of 6% applies, divide the gross receipts by 1.06 as shown in the example below. If a 1% local option tax applies, divide by 1.07.\n\nFor example: A retailer includes the 6% sales tax in the price of all goods and services. In this example, assume local option sales tax does not apply. The taxable gross receipts are $17,250. Divide $17,250 by 1.06. The result - $16,273.58 - is the amount to be entered as gross sales on the return.\n\nFailure to file a return on time or pay the tax due may result in penalty and interest owed. Interest accrues from the due date until paid. The interest accrues every calendar month or a fraction of the month. Interest rates change yearly. Read more about penalties.\n\nFailure to post a bond when required may result in the revocation of an existing permit or denial of a permit application.\n\nApplicants\n\nThe Department may require a bond of an applicant if:\n\nThe applicant or an active officer of the corporation has held a previous permit and has an unfavorable filing and remittance record for prior tax obligations, or\n\nThe applicant or an active officer of the corporation has held a previous permit and has experienced prior collection problems, or\n\nThe Department has knowledge that the applicant may be financially unable to remit the tax by the date due.\n\nExisting Permit Holders\n\nExisting permit holders may be required to post a bond under the following conditions:\n\nQuarterly Filers - two or more delinquencies in a 24-month period\n\nMonthly Filers - four or more delinquencies in a 24-month period\n\nSemimonthly Filers - eight or more delinquencies during a 24-month period\n\nIf the retailer has made recurring tax payments with returned checks\n\nBond Amount\n\nWhen the Department requires a bond, the minimum amount is determined as follows:\n\nQuarterly Filers: The bond equals the sales tax liability typically filed in three filing quarters.\n\nMonthly Filers: The bond equals five months of sales tax liability.\n\nSemimonthly Filers: The bond equals three months of sales tax liability.\n\nAnnual Filers: The bond equals one year of tax liability but no less than $100.\n\nThe Department may require a larger amount if necessary. No bond is less than $100. The Department accepts cash, cashier’s checks, certificates of deposit, and surety bonds; personal checks are not accepted.\n\nRequired records include the normal books of account ordinarily maintained by a person engaged in business activity. This includes all bills, receipts, invoices, cash register tapes, or other documentation. These may be maintained in an electronic format.\n\nRecords are required to be maintained for at least three years. In the event of an audit, the Department may request records for a longer period of time if returns have never been filed.\n\nThe Department may audit a return anytime within three years. However, the period for audit is unlimited if a return was filed falsely or fraudulently with the intent to evade tax, or if no return was filed.\n\nPermit holders have the right to contest an assessment, denial of a refund claim, or any other Department action, except licensing. Appeals must be filed with the Department’s hearing officer within 60 days of the assessment notice date or denial of the refund claim. If a proper appeal is not filed, the Department may either require a proper appeal or dismiss the appeal for failure to comply. If an appeal is not filed timely, the Department assumes that the permit holder does not oppose the assessment.\n\nSee The Appeals Process.\n\nA refund can be made only to the person who actually paid the tax, which in most cases is the customer.\n\nThe customer may request a refund of sales tax paid in error on IA 843 Claim for Refund (22-009). Claims for refund should be filed with the Department within three years of the date the tax payment was due.\n\nA taxpayer cannot use the IA 843 Refund Return to claim a refund of use tax. A taxpayer must file an amended return to claim a refund of use tax.\n\nRacks, Shelving, and Conveyor Equipment\n\nRacks, shelving, and conveyor equipment purchased by certain warehouses and distribution centers may be eligible for a refund of the sales tax paid on their purchase price. Businesses approved under the New Jobs and Income Program (NJIP), the Enterprise Zone Program (EZ) and New Capital Investment Program (NCIP) may qualify for a sales tax refund. Contact the Iowa Economic Development Authority to determine if your warehouse or distribution center qualifies for a sales tax refund through one of these programs.\n\nA seller must obtain a properly completed Iowa Sales Tax Exemption Certificate from any purchaser claiming exemption from sales and use tax.\n\nIowa Sales Tax Exemption Certificate (31-014)\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the tax rate for all taxable items shown below is:\n\n6% state sales tax, plus\n\n1% local option sales tax, if applicable\n\n911 Surcharge\n\nExempt:\n\nThe surcharge for “enhanced” 911 emergency telephone service\n\nThe surcharge can be no more than $1 per month per telephone access line.\n\nAdvertising\n\nExempt:\n\nEnvelopes used primarily for advertising\n\nAdvertising and promotional materials, such as:\n\nSeed catalogs\n\nBrochures\n\nLeaflets\n\nReturn envelopes, and\n\nOther similar materials which are stored in Iowa before being sent for use out-of-state\n\nAgriculture\n\nSee Farmers Guide to Iowa Taxes\n\nAircraft\n\nTaxable:\n\nTax collected by the Iowa Department of Transportation at the time of registration in Iowa\n\nThe purchase of an aircraft does not qualify for exemption as a “casual sale.”\n\nTax Rate\n\n6% state use tax\n\nNO local option sales tax\n\nExempt:\n\nIf registered out-of-state\n\nExempt only to aircraft used in Interstate Federal Aviation Administration certified air carrier operations:\n\nSale or rental of aircraft (scheduled operation only)\n\nExempt for all aircraft:\n\nSale or rental of any tangible personal property permanently affixed to any aircraft that is a component part of an aircraft\n\nRendering, furnishing, or performing of services in connection with repair, remodeling, or maintenance of aircraft\n\nFor purposes of these exemptions, “aircraft” means the same as defined in Iowa Code section 328.1, which defines it as “any contrivance now known or later invented which is designed and used for navigation and flight in the air, and made to transport people or property.”\n\nAll-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs)\n\nTaxable:\n\nATVs, including off-road vehicles and off-road motorcycles, if delivery is taken in Iowa or if purchased out-of-state for use in Iowa.

For further discussion, see the “sales price” section above.\n\nCoupons, Discounts, Rebates, Coupon Books and Gift Certificates/Cards\n\nTaxable:\n\nTax is due at the time the coupon or certificate is redeemed by the customer\n\nExempt:\n\nCoupon books and gift certificates are exempt from tax at the time they are purchased\n\nDiscount means \"to buy at a reduction.\" Iowa sales tax applies to the reduced price paid by the customer. Certain retailers bill their customers on a gross and net basis, with the difference considered to be a discount for payment purposes. When a customer does not resolve the bill within the net payment period, tax applies on the gross charge shown on the billing.\n\nA rebate is a return of part of an amount paid for a product. Manufacturers’ rebates are not discounts and cannot be used to reduce the gross receipts received from a sale or reduce the purchase price of a product. This rule applies even though the rebate is used by the seller to reduce the selling price or is used by the purchaser as a down payment. The rebate is considered a transaction between the manufacturer and the purchaser.\n\nIowa sales tax applies to the amount paid by the purchaser to the seller. That amount cannot be reduced by the amount of the rebate before sales tax is applied. In most situations, sales tax will be charged on the full price of the item purchased.\n\nFinance Charges\n\nTaxable:\n\nFinance charges included in the selling price as a condition of sale\n\nExempt:\n\nInterest or other types of charges that result from selling on credit or under installment contracts if separately stated and reasonable in amount\n\nFlorists\n\nTaxable:\n\nOrders taken by an Iowa florist and communicated to a second florist in Iowa\n\nThe “sending florist” is responsible for collecting the tax.\n\nExempt:\n\nOrders taken by an Iowa florist and communicated to a second florist located outside Iowa for delivery to a point outside Iowa\n\nFood\n\nSee Iowa Sales Tax on Food\n\nFreight, Shipping, and Handling Charges\n\nTaxable:\n\nInbound freight or freight-in charges do not fall within the definition of delivery charges, and are taxable when added to the price of a taxable retail sale. An example of when “freight-in” charges might appear is a situation where a purchaser wishes to buy a product from a retailer, but that retailer doesn't have the item in stock and must order the product. If the retailer prices the product at a certain amount, plus the shipping costs associated with obtaining the product by ordering from their supplier, those associated costs (freight-in) are not exempt delivery charges even if separately stated. These charges reflect the costs a seller may incur to secure possession of the product from their supplier. Exempt delivery charges constitute the costs necessary to transfer the product from the seller to the purchaser.\n\nExempt:\n\nIf separately invoiced or separately stated on the bill\n\nFuel\n\nTaxable:\n\nDyed diesel, unless used for agricultural production or other exempt purpose\n\nLPG (propane), unless used for manufacturing or other exempt purpose or to power a registered vehicle\n\nExempt:\n\nClear diesel and other motor fuel and special fuel if:\n\nThe fuel is consumed for highway use, in watercraft, or in aircraft,\n\nThe Iowa fuel tax has been imposed and paid, and\n\nNo refund or credit of fuel tax has been made or will be allowed\n\nGambling\n\nA state gambling license may be required.

However, if the rental company does not separately itemize the waste removal service and the portable toilet rental in a contract to provide such products and services, the entire sales price is taxable as a bundled transaction under Iowa Code section 423.2(8).\n\nPrinters and Publishers\n\nExempt:\n\nSales and rentals to printers and publishers of numerous supplies used to complete a finished printed product for retail sale.\n\nPrizes\n\nExempt if purchased by the sponsor:\n\nTangible personal property to be given as a prize to a player in games of skill, chance, bingo, or raffle\n\nProcessing\n\nExempt:\n\nElectricity or steam or any taxable service purchased and used in the actual processing of tangible personal property intended to be ultimately sold at retail\n\nTangible personal property sold for processing when it:\n\nBy means of fabrication, compounding, manufacturing, or germination becomes an integral part of other tangible personal property intended to be ultimately sold at retail.\n\nIs a chemical, solvent, sorbent, or reagent, which is directly used and consumed, dissipated, or depleted in processing tangible personal property intended to be sold ultimately at retail, even if it does not become a component or integral part of the finished product.

These envelopes are used to send out monthly reports to the investment counselor’s clients regarding their accounts. Tax is due at the time the investment counselor purchases the envelopes if the clients are not billed for these items. Each envelope is transferred to a client in a form or quantity which is capable of a fixed or definite price value. However, there must also be an actual sale to the client (customer) of an item of personal property in order that there be a “resale” of the item.\n\nA jeweler purchases materials such as main springs and crystals to be used in the performance of a service. These items are purchased by the jeweler for resale where they are transferred to the customer in a form or quantity capable of a fixed or definite price value and each item is actually sold to the customer as evidenced by a separate charge.\n\nAn accounting firm purchases plastic binders used to cover reports issued to its customers.

It does not include a battery or other storage point, equipment used for safety or security of the equipment such as fencing, or equipment not used to collect, convert, or transmit solar energy. It also does not include materials used to manufacture, install, or construct solar energy equipment, such as racking to install or mount solar energy equipment or pads or foundations to support a solar energy equipment installation.\n\nWhile not defined in this exemption, the Department typically interprets “primary use” as requiring equipment be used in the prescribed manner for more than half of its use. This will likely not be an issue for this exemption since once the equipment is installed, it is likely not used for any other purpose.\n\nThere are no limitations or qualifications for the type of purchaser claiming an exemption for the purchase of solar energy equipment.\n\nTangible Personal Property\n\nTaxable:\n\nUnless a specific exemption has been written into the law\n\nTrade-Ins\n\nTrade-ins may reduce the taxable price of a transaction when:\n\nTangible personal property is traded toward the purchase price of other tangible personal property and\n\nThe trade-in is the type of item that is sold in the retailer’s regular course of business and\n\nThe item traded-in is to be ultimately sold at retail.\n\nTransportation Services\n\nTaxable:\n\nArmored car services\n\nPersonal transportation services, including:\n\nTaxis\n\nDriver services\n\nRide sharing services\n\nRides for hire\n\nLimousine services\n\nBus services\n\nShuttle services\n\nCertain car and airplane rentals\n\nTax Rate\n\n6% state tax, plus\n\nLocal option tax, if any, plus\n\nAutomobile rental tax, when applicable\n\nExempt:\n\nAirline\n\nRailroad\n\nFor more information about personal transportation service, see additional guidance.\n\nUtilities\n\nGenerally, the sales, furnishing, or service of gas, electricity, water, heat, pay television and communication services, including the sale of these items by municipal corporations, are taxable.\n\nResidential Energy\n\nExempt from state sales tax\n\nLocal option tax, if any, applies\n\nSewage / Solid Waste and Disposal Services\n\nTaxable when billed to nonresidential commercial operations.\n\nVending Machines and Other Coin-Operated Devices\n\nTaxable:\n\nCandy, candy-coated items, candy products, and\n\nCertain beverages\n\nAn operator who places vending or other coin-operated machines in different locations needs only one permit.
