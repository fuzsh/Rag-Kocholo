        "text": "Classification, Nomenclature, and Identification of Insects and their Relatives\n\nClassification: Classifying involves grouping things into categories based on similar characteristics. Insects, like all living organisms, can be classified according to their phylogenetic relationships. The classification system used by scientists involves a hierarchy beginning with a broad category and ending with a very specific category. In science, we classify organisms according to kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.\n\nNomenclature: Nomenclature refers to the naming of organisms. Each organism is given a name consisting of two words referred to as the scientific name. The first word represents the genus and the second the species. Scientific names are Latin and are either printed in italics or underlined if handwritten. The scientific name for the honey bee is Apis mellifera.\n\nIdentification of Insects and their Relatives: Insects are part of the phylum of animals called Arthropoda. All arthropods posses an exoskeleton, bi-lateral symmetry, jointed appendages, segmented bodies, and specialized appendages. The major arthropod classes can be separated by comparing their number of body regions, legs, and antennae.\n\nARACHNIDA\n\nClass Arachnida (uh-rak-nid-uh), spiders, ticks, mites, scorpions and others. This is a diverse class which belongs to a subphylum of the Arthropoda known as the Chelicerata. Chelicerata are characterized as having two distinct body regions, a cephlothorax and an abdomen. Chelicerates have six pairs of appendages, the first two pairs being mouthparts and the following four pairs being legs. They do not have antennae.\n\nThe first pair of mouthparts are the chelicerae (sing., chelicera). They are three-segmented and pincher-like. In spiders, the terminal third segment is often called a fang. The second pair of mouthparts are the six-segmented pedipalps. They may appear leg-like (spiders) or claw-like (scorpions). The legs of most Chelicerata have seven segments. Compared to insects, whose legs have six segments, there is an extra segment, called the patella, between the third segment (the femur) and the fourth segment (the tibia). Common orders of Arachnida include:\n\nOrder Araneae (a-ran-e-uh), the spiders.Two tagmata (cephlothorax and abdomen)\n\nNo antennae\n\nAbdomen joined to cephlothorax by slender pedicel\n\nFour pairs of legs\n\nMouthparts: One pair chelicerae and one pair of pedipalps\n\nEyes simple ocelli. Usually eight, sometimes fewer\n\nPoison apparatus opens on the fangs of the chelicerae\n\nSilk apparatus always present at end of abdomen, below anus\n\nThis is a large order, having about 2500 species in North America. Although nearly all spiders have venom glands, spiders seldom bite man. Only a few U.S. species are considered dangerous. In Nebraska, the black widow and the brown recluse are the only seriously venomous spiders\n\nOrder Acari (ak-a-ri), the mites and ticks.\n\nTwo tagmata (cephlothorax and abdomen)\n\nNo antennae.\n\nAbdomen broadly joined to cephlothorax (no pedicel).\n\nFour pairs of legs in adults; only three pairs at hatching\n\nTicks and mites occur just about anywhere animal life is found. They may be terrestrial or aquatic, free-living or parasitic.They may feed on organic debris (beneficial scavengers) or on living plants or animals. Some of the plant feeders are serious pests of crops. Some of the parasitic forms are pests of animals and man. Some are vectors of diseases. A few of the predatory and parasitic mites are considered beneficial because they feed on insects or other pests. Over 30,000 species of ticks and mites have been described.\n\nOrder Scorpiones (scor-pi-on-es), the scorpions.\n\nTwo tagmata (cephlothorax and abdomen)\n\nNo antennae\n\nNo pedicel between cephlothorax and abdomen\n\nFour pairs of legs on cephlothorax\n\nOne pair of chelicerae and one pair of long, pincher-like pedipalpsAbdomen with seven broad segments anteriorly, followed by five narrower segments which end with a large stinger.\n\nScorpions feed mostly on insects and spiders which they catch with their pedipalps. They may or may not sting their prey. Scorpions do not ordinarily attack man, but they will sting if disturbed or cornered. Of the forty-some species that occur in the U.S., the sting of most is painful, but not dangerous. One Arizona species, however, is very venomous, and its sting can be fatal.\n\nCHILOPODA\n\nClass Chilopoda (chi-lo-po-da), the centipedes.\n\nTwo tagmata (head and trunk) One pair of antennae with 14 or more segments\n\nOne pair of legs per trunk segment.\n\nMouthparts: one pair of mandibles and two pairs of maxillae\n\nAppendages on the first trunk segment are clawlike poison jaws or fangs with which centipedes paralyze their prey.\n\nThe class name refers to the lip- like appearance of the fused bases of these appendages.\n\nEyes may be present or absent.\n\nCentipedes are elongate and flattened. They are usually found in somewhat protected places, such as in leaf litter, in the soil, under bark, or in rotten logs. One species is commonly found in houses and other buildings. Centipedes are predatory and feed on insects, spiders, and other small animals.The larger centipedes can bite humans, but the bite is not serious and is no more painful that the sting of a bee or wasp. The common small centipedes of Nebraska are harmless to man. Overall, centipedes are beneficial natural enemies of insects.\n\nDIPLOPODA\n\nClass Diplopoda (dip-low-po-da), the millipedes.\n\nTwo tagmata (head and trunk)\n\nOne pair of antennae, usually having seven segments\n\nTwo pairs of legs on most trunk segments (30 or more pairs total)\n\nMouthparts: one pair of mandibles, and one pair of maxillae\n\nEyes are usually present\n\nMillipedes are usually cylindrical (sometimes slightly flattened). Except for the first three trunk segments, each segment has two pairs of short legs. Millipedes are found in damp places such as the soil, leaf litter, or under logs and stones. Most millipedes are beneficial scavengers of decaying plant material. A few attack living plants and are sometimes pests. Even fewer are predacious. Millipedes do not bite man, but many give off a foul-smelling fluid containing hydrogen cyanide which can be strong enough to kill insects placed in a jar with a millipede.\n\nINSECTA\n\nClass Insecta (in- sec-ta), the insects.\n\nThree tagmata (head, thorax and abdomen)\n\nOne pair of antennae\n\nThree pairs of legs\n\nMay have wings, either one or two pairs\n\nInsects are the most abundant life form now known to science. Around 1,000,000 species have been described and named. That is more than all the other known animals put together."
