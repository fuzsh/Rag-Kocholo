You can only use one authentication app at a time.\n\nIf you don’t want to enter a verification code every time you sign in to the Square app or Dashboard, select Remember this device for 90 days. Every 90 days, you’ll need to sign in with a verification code. You can choose this option again once the 90 days are up.\n\nIf you can’t access your phone to receive the verification code needed to sign in to your account, contact Square Support via phone for help.\n\nSet up two-step verification\n\nYou can set up two-step verification in your Square Dashboard.\n\nSet up SMS verification\n\nSign in to your Square Dashboard and select Account & Settings > Personal Information > Sign in and security.\n\nUnder Two-step verification, select Enable.
