        "text": "The Department of Defense transitioned from its legacy paper-based Uniformed Services Identification (USID) card to a more secure, next generation USID card. The Next Generation USID card incorporates an updated design and security features to deter counterfeiting and fraud, and is printed on a plastic cardstock. Initial issuance of the Next Generation USID card began on July 31, 2020 at select DoD ID card facilities, with phased implementation at all DoD ID card facilities, and completed in December 2020. USID cards are issued to retired and reserve members, dependent family members of uniformed Service members, and other eligible individuals in accordance with DoD policy to facilitate access to benefits, privileges, and DoD bases. The Next Generation USID card does not change the populations who are eligible to receive the current card.\n\nLegacy USID cards remain valid through their expiration date, however, individuals with an indefinite (INDEF) expiration date on their legacy USID card may replace those ID cards with a Next Generation USID card.\n\nUSID cards may now be renewed online. Please see our online USID card renewal page for more information.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"
