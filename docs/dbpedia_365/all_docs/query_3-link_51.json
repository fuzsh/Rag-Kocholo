Introduction to the 1990 Edition 2.1 Now and for many years past, all the dimensions of cinema film, and the positions of everything that goes on it, has been standardised to within as close tolerances as it is universally and commercially practicable to achieve. In the first 20 years of cinema, this was not so. The industry was founded on the gauge of film used by Edison in his Kinetoscope, but various people, in a number of countries, made films only more-or-less the same as those. And it is the variations between different makers’ products that makes possible the recognition of the products of some of the producers (persons and companies) of that period. 2.2 It is normal now for film processing and printing work to be carried out by specialist laboratories, who have a number of film-producing organisations among their customers; and those customers may sometimes employ one laboratory, and sometimes another. 2.3 During about the first 20 years of cinema history, however, it was at least almost universally the case, that the film-makers processed their own negatives, and made and processed their own prints. This led to each having consistent peculiarities which make the films of many of the producers of the period recognisable, quite apart from whether or not their name appeared on the film. Some of the peculiarities of the different film-makers are of no more than curiosity interest. Others are capable of enabling us to recognise which company made the film, and with some greater or lesser precision, when it was made; when this is not so easily discoverable by other means. That is: some of these characteristics, peculiar to certain early film-makers of this period, are useful aids to identification. I emphasise the word “aids”. You cannot fully identify a mysterious film by use of physical characteristics alone. Reference to written sources of information is vital for this purpose. What the physical characteristics can do is to materially narrow down the area within which it is necessary to search the literature. See a list of some relevant publications at the end of this section. 2.4 Note that some events occurred at a precisely determined date (e.g., the introduction of “positive” perforations in 1924). Other changes were spread over a period of time which cannot be precisely stated. 2.5 The various features dealt with in this publication are noted on the Contents page. Information relating to each producer is generally arranged under the headings of the several sections. Other odd items about a particular producer are given in a little “Essay” on that producer. Some of the essays include a Film List. 2.6 This publication deals primarily with features which are observed on the film itself, as opposed to what may be seen at a screening of the film. However, it deals with some features which, although they are actually visible on the screen, are so inconspicuous or of such short duration, that they cannot be studied or compared at a normal screening. 2.7. Some relevant publications2 : • The Bioscope: A British film trade paper which commenced publication in 1908. • Variety: A theatrical paper which embraced films. • Kinematograph and Lantern Monthly: devoted to still and moving projected pictures around the turn of the 20th century. • Library of Congress, Catalog of Copyright Entries. • American Film-Index by Einar Lauritzen and Gunnar Lundquist. • The early film catalogues of Georges Méliès, Gaumont, Cecil Hepworth, Warwick Trading Co., Pathé Frères, and probably others. 2 Other references will be suggested. 42 Physical Characteristics of Early Films as Aids to Identification • The “Film Index” of the British Film Institute. • The “Producer Lists” of the National Film Archive, London. Notes on the illustrations Almost all the illustrations are reproduced the actual size of the original film. Some of the relevant features are very small and may need to be viewed through a magnifying glass (e.g., the trademarks in scenes). In some of the illustrations the quality of the picture itself is very poor. This is because, in these cases, I have processed the illustration in a way to enhance the relevant feature (e.g., perforation images) and have sacrificed picture quality in order to achieve this. Some illustrations include the perforations, while some do not. When perforations appear, they are the perforations of original contemporary positives or (rarely) negatives. When an illustration has been taken from a duplicate..."
