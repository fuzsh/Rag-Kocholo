        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Film Foundation created the first-ever National Film Study Standards (NFSS) to guide teachers and administrators in helping students develop literacy in moving images. The NFSS provide criteria that educators can use to plan film study lessons. They are designed to meet the needs of both students and teachers, and to ensure the quality and consistency of instruction. They also provide a scope and sequence for that instruction, emphasizing depth of knowledge rather than simply exposure to classic films.\n\nThe core academic-content standards have five thematic strands:\n\n1.0 Film Language. Students learn to read and interpret visual text by developing a film vocabulary, identifying editing techniques, and analyzing film elements within selected scenes.\n\n2.0 Historical and Cultural Contexts. Students understand that a film is both a historical/social document and a cultural artifact. Students analyze social issues presented in film and form conclusions about the ways in which film influences and is influenced by the society in which it is produced.\n\n3.0 Production and Creative Expression. Students understand that film is an expression of a director’s personal vision produced through a collaborative process. Students understand and distinguish the various filmmaking roles that contribute to the final work of art.\n\n4.0 Viewers’ Response and Aesthetic Valuing. Students understand that a film is a work of art. Students describe, interpret, and analyze a film’s visual design. They respond to and make informed judgments about film, deriving personal meaning from the work. They express their viewpoints through oral and/or written presentations.\n\nContent Standard\n\nOutcomes by Level(I = Basic II = Intermediate III = Advanced)\n\n4.1—Understanding our film heritage\n\nI: Students explain what film preservation is; understand the purpose of the National Film Registry.\n\nII: Students distinguish between film preservation and film restoration; identify qualities that make a film eligible for the National Film Registry.\n\nIII: Students evaluate and nominate films to the National Film Registry.\n\n4.2—Deriving personal meaning from film\n\nI: Students express an opinion about the film, using film language and supportive details and references to specific scenes or elements.\n\nII: Students understand that each person interprets and reacts emotionally and intellectually to a film in a different way.\n\nIII: Students analyze how the film did or did not have personal relevance, citing specific examples from the film.\n\n4.3—Assessing the merits of film as a work of art\n\nI: Students explain characteristics that make a film a work of art.\n\nII: Students identify and explain qualities of the film that make it a success or a failure, given the filmmaker’s intended theme and audience; create a step-by-step process for others to follow in critiquing a film.\n\nIII: Students analyze how the film did or did not have personal relevance, citing specific examples from the film; understand the purpose and process of writing a film critique; write and present a film critique.\n\n5.0 Cross-Curricular Connections. Students first tap their knowledge of other disciplines to study a film. They then apply what they have learned about film to other disciplines, making connections between film and literature/language arts, film and history/social studies, film and other arts, and film and sciences.\n\nContent Standard\n\nOutcomes by Level (I = Basic II = Intermediate III = Advanced)\n\n5.1—Understanding relationships between film and the other arts and disciplines outside the arts\n\nI: Students identify common terms in film study with other subject areas (e.g., characterization, symbolism, composition, depiction, etc.); use visuals to communicate ideas in other subject areas.\n\nII: Students apply knowledge of film content and narrative structure to writing personal narratives; apply knowledge of film depictions to analyzing political cartoons in social studies; use visual symbols and elements of composition to depict the history and cultures of other civilizations.\n\nIII: Students communicate ideas for written and oral presentations using moving images or elements of film composition; work collaboratively with others in problem-solving projects; study a social issue and research archival film to create a multimedia presentation that reflects that time and culture.\n\n5.2—Identifying professional filmmaking skills and roles\n\nI: Students identify filmmaking roles.\n\nII: Students identify the skills needed for various filmmaking roles, such as director, screenwriter, production designer, costume designer, cinematographer, actor, film editor, and composer.\n\nIII: Students research two or more works of specific filmmakers and analyze how their training and experiences influenced their work."
