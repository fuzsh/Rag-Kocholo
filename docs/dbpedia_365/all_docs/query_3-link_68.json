Some of these qualities come naturally, while others can be developed with practice over time. Having these five qualities could make a difference in a filmmaker’s level of success and personal satisfaction in the profession.\n\n1. Communication Skills\n\nFilmmakers have to communicate orally and in writing with a large number of people. They have to communicate with the actors, production and technical crews. They must be able to communicate with vendors and others who service the film. The filmmaker should also be able to update the investors or firm they work for about the status of the project.\n\n2. Artistic Talent and Creativity\n\nA filmmaker takes a script and turns it into a riveting story. They should have the right type of artistic talent and vision to do this. Each film may require a slightly different artistic take. For example, a biopic about a rock ‘n’ roll star would have a different artistic take than a sci-fi film. The filmmaker should also have a strong sense of creativity and an ability to bring their vision into reality.\n\n3. Strong Leadership\n\nEveryone else working on a film looks to the filmmaker as the leader. The filmmaker should be comfortable with delegation and directing people on what to do. They should have enough confidence in the people they hire to not need to micro-manage a project. The filmmaker should be able to instruct and coach the actors so that they can portray their characters as realistically as possible. Filmmakers should also be adept at supervising and directing the behind-the-scenes production staff.\n\n4. Excellent Time Management\n\nA filmmaker must be able to manage their time wisely. They need to know when to delegate and to whom to delegate certain tasks. They must be able to choose the best production staff and actors for the film as explained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A filmmaker may have specific deadlines and budgets to follow. They may have deadlines related to both the filming aspects and the editing of the project. The filmmaker has to make sure that everyone else is doing their jobs as efficiently as possible.\n\n5. Organizational Skills\n\nA filmmaker has to keep a huge project organized. They will need to deal with production staff schedules, facility schedules, actor availability and the technical crew’s schedules. They also have to keep equipment and supplies organized. Filmmakers may be responsible for allocating certain aspects of the budget for the film. They may have to make decisions about ancillary staff and services, such as makeup, costumes, hairstyling, stunts, janitorial, construction, food service and first aid. They need to keep their investors or supervisors updated about the status of every aspect of the project.\n\nRelated Resource: 15 Best Affordable Film Studies Degree Programs\n\nThese five characteristics of a filmmaker are part of what makes a person successful in this occupation.
