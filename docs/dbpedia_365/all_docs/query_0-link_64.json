        "text": "Works cannot be entered as a group collaboration. Only oneâ¯studentâ¯will be officially attached to a specific entry; however,Â you may add collaborator information, such as names, to the Work Sources fields during the work upload process. This includes works in the Film & Animation category. Please use your best judgment when determining which teen involved in a project enters the work. The teen that enters the work will receive credit if the piece is awarded. A work cannot be entered multiple times by different teens.\n\nIf you have updates to your profile, including name or address changes, please make those as soon as possible. Changes made to your profile after the entry deadline may not be reflected in awards you may win this year, but the sooner you make the changes, the more likely it is that we will be able to include them.\n\nYou will be automaticallyÂ assigned to a regionalÂ program when you create your account at artandwriting.org/loginÂ based on your schoolâs zip code. You may have a differentÂ regional program for art entries than for writing entries.Â\n\nTo find your region, visit the My Region page.\n\nFor more guidance on creating your account, finding your region, and entering works, view our walkthrough video series for Teens and Educators.\n\nEntry fees are $10.00 per individual entry and $30.00 per portfolio entry.\n\nThe Awards are presented by the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and its Affiliate Partners. Entry fees support both your local Affiliate and the Alliance to cover the cost of processing, customer service, scholarships, ceremonies, exhibitions, publications, and other general operating costs.\n\nIf the fee is a barrier to any teenâs participation, we will waive the fee. Fee waivers are made possible, in part, by BLICK Art Materials.\n\nFor more guidance on how to complete entry fees, view our TeenÂ and Educator walkthrough videos on submitting payment.\n\nYou do not need to list an educator when entering your work. However, we highly encourage you to list an educator so that they receive recognition for their guidance.Â Â\n\nFor more guidance on selecting your educators, view our walkthrough videos on Uploading Art Work and Uploading Writing Work.\n\nIf you experience any difficulties while setting up your account or entering your work, please try again in a few days. The Scholastic Awards team is actively working to resolve any issues and will keep you informed if any updates are needed. You can be confident that we are committed to ensuring a smooth and successful experience for all participants. Check out our Troubleshooting blog post for the most up-to-date information on the portalâs status.\n\nTeen accounts are assigned to a regional program based on their school zip code. Teens who are homeschooled or attend a virtual school are assigned to a regional program based on their home zip code. Teens are never assigned to a regional program based on the zip code of their Other Educational Program.\n\nEducator accounts are assigned to a regional program based on the zip code of the organization where they teach (either the school or the Other Educational Program listed in their account). Homeschool and virtual school teachers will be assigned to a regional program based on their home zip code.\n\nWhen you create an account, you are assigned to one art and one writing region based on your school or other educational programâs zip code. After you create your account, you can change your school or other educational program, but you cannot move to a new region. If you move to a school or other educational program located in a different region during the entry season, please create a new account to connect to your new region. You can find out if your old and new school/organization are located in the same region by searching their zip codes on the region lookup webpage.\n\nThe process for applying for direct scholarships is the same as for regular entries. In the participantâs account, there is a step in the work entry process titled Cash Awards. Here, the participant can click a checkbox indicating which scholarship they want their work to be considered for and add a personal statement on why they are applying (50 words minimum). The entry deadline for scholarships is the same as the deadline in your region.\n\nFor more guidance on applying for direct scholarships, view our walkthrough videos on Uploading Art Work and Uploading Writing Work.\n\nTeens enrolled in online, virtual schools, or other distance learning programs should add the school to their profile just as they would add any other school. If your primary school is a distance learning program, you will be assigned a region based on your home zip code instead of your school zip code. We want you to be recognized first in your local community.\n\nFor more information on selecting your school, view our walkthrough video on Creating a Teen Account.\n\nWhen a student is enrolled at a school but is not required to be physically present to complete their education, we refer to that school as a Distance Learning Program. Examples of Distance Learning Programs include virtual or online schools and home school networks.\n\nParticipation in the Awards begins at the regional level with recognition in your local community. Students are automatically assigned to a region based on the location of their primary school. If your school is a Distance Learning Program, then you will be assigned to a region based on your home address in your profile. For more information on selecting your school, view our walkthrough video on Creating a Teen Account.\n\nOther Educational Programs (OEP) and residence programs like boarding schools are not marked as Distance Learning Programs.\n\nIf you believe that you have been assigned to the wrong region, please contact us.\n\nTeens are required to create an account linking their day school and will be able to add one or more out-of-school programs as an Other Educational Program (OEP) when entering works. The Awards are not in a position to determine what constitutes an OEP because many of the educational spaces in which teens are creating work outside of school are not easily defined.\n\nIn our exhibitions, publications, and notifications, we focus on highlighting teensâ demographic information (grade, city, and state) along with their school. OEP names will not be listed, but educators from the OEP can be listed if that is what the teen has requested.\n\nFor more guidance on selecting your OEP and educators, view our walkthrough videos on Uploading Art Work and Uploading Writing Work.\n\nOnly teens residing in the United States, U.S. territories or military bases, or Canada may enter the Awards.\n\nBoarding Schools: Teens attending a boarding school located in the United States, U.S. territories or military bases, or Canada will be automatically assigned to a regional program based on the location of their school.\n\nVirtual Schools: Teens must reside in the United States, U.S. territories or military bases, or Canada to enter the Awards when enrolled in a virtual school. Teens will need a home address in order to apply to a regional program.\n\nOther Educational Programs: Teens residing outside of the United States, U.S. territories or military bases, or Canada, are not eligible for the 2024 Scholastic Awards, even if they attend an Other Educational Program in the United States. Other Educational Programs include summer programs, after-school clubs or lessons, private tutoring, pre-college programs, and portfolio review courses.\n\nPlease contact us to request to have your school added to our system. Our team will review your request, which will take around 3-5 business days to complete. During peak times, it may take longer to process your school request. You will receive an email when your request has been accepted.Â\n\nWe strongly encourage all educators to create a Scholastic Art & Writing Awards account, though they are not required to do so. Educators with accounts have the ability to edit, view, and monitor the progress of their participants online.\n\nWe also use educator accounts to distribute materials, such as medals, to the educators of National Medalists. You may add a personal address to your educator account, and we will mail your medal to this address. If you do not include a personal address, we will send any materials to the school address that is linked to your account.\n\nEducators of National Medalists will not be able to reserve National Ceremony tickets or receive their educator award if they do not have an account.\n\nFor guidance on creating and navigating an educator account, view our walkthrough video series.\n\nTo participate in the Awards, you must be a teen in grades 7â12, age 13 and up, and residing in the United States, U.S. territories or military bases, or Canada.\n\nTeens may enter work that was created this past spring or over the summer. Teens should enter their current grade level, even if they are entering work that was created while they were in a different grade.\n\nPortfolio entries consist of six works that can come from one category or any combination of multiple categories. Art portfolios may only contain works from art categories, and writing portfolios are limited to writing categories. Teens may enter two art portfolios and two writing portfolios, but all works must be unique. The same work cannot be entered in both portfolios.\n\nExpanded Project works cannot be included in portfolio entries.\n\nGenerally, there is no limit to the number of works you may enter, with the exception of Photography and Portfolio. Each participant is allowed to enter 16 works in the Photography category, and two art and two writing portfolios. Please be aware that photos added to portfolios will count toward the 16âwork limit. The Portfolio category is open toÂ teens in grade 12Â only.Â\n\nTeens may enter different works into multiple categories but are not allowed to enter the same work into more than one category.\n\nEntry guidelines may vary for art and writing in each region. Please visit the My Region page to find your regional webpage with specific guidelines and deadlines.\n\nNo. Since their founding in 1923, the mission of the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards has been to identify teens with exceptional artistic and literary talent and present their remarkable work to the world. The core judging criteria from a century ago to guide juror decisions are the same ones used today: originality, skill, personal vision, and voice. Over the decades, as artistic practices and technology have advanced, entry categories have changed and also were expanded to embrace the innovative tools being used to create in new and bold ways. The Scholastic Awards recognize that the recent, rapidly expanding availability and capabilities of generative AI tools yield both opportunities and challenges. We are actively monitoring the ever-evolving landscape of technological sophistication and conversations about copyright and consent and may, in future years, adapt our guidance about the use of generative AI in the creation of works submitted for Awards consideration. Currently, AI-generated work is not invited to be entered into the 2024 Scholastic Awards, and if entered, will be subject to disqualification.\n\nThe Alliance is proud to promote the exceptional work of young artists to a wide audience of educators, students, program partners, and the general public through exhibitions, special events, print and online publications, and social media. This includes the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards National Exhibition, displays at the U.S. Department of Education and the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences in Washington, D.C., and the Traveling Exhibition.\n\nTo do these things, we need permission from you. The non-exclusive license allows us to use, copy, change, publish, publicly perform, distribute, exhibit, or add to your work without further permission or approval from you as part of our mission to promote creative self-expression among young people. You will always be notified if your work is shown in these special exhibitions and all displays or publications will attribute you to your work. This non-exclusive license also means that you can enter the same work you entered into the Awards to other scholarship programs or contests, keep the work in your portfolio, and license it to others for non-exclusive publication.\n\nYou donât have to submit a separate consent form. However, you, not the Awards, are responsible for getting any necessary consents or releases from people or for any places or property depicted in your work. By entering work to the Awards, you certify that the work is yours and does not infringe on anyone elseâs intellectual property rights.\n\nAll work entered into the Awards must be original, meaning you create the work based on your own ideas. By entering work to the Awards, you agree that you created it and did not copy it from any other person, business, school, or organization. Any work that infringes anyoneâs intellectual property rights will be disqualified.\n\nFor more information about the Scholastic Art & Writing Awardsâ Copyright & Plagiarism policy, review the links below.\n\nParticipation Terms\n\nCopyright & Plagiarism Guide\n\nHow to Be Original\n\nIf your work has been previously published, exhibited, or recognized by another program, confirm that they do not hold exclusive rights to your work before entering it to the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards. In the case that your work receives an Award, it must be free to use in our publications or exhibitions under the non-exclusive license described in our participation terms.\n\nYou may enter the same work you entered to us to other scholarship programs or contests or license it to others for non-exclusive publication. If you plan to enter work to another awards program or publication, review their rules first to confirm that they will not hold exclusive rights to your work. In the case that your work receives a Scholastic Art & Writing Award, it must be free to use in our publications or exhibitions under the non-exclusive license described in our participation terms.\n\nScholastic Awards Summer (SAS) scholarships are need- and merit-based tuition scholarships for 7â11 grade teens who received a Gold or Silver Key.\n\nTeens do not apply for specific summer programs; instead, they apply for a SAS Scholarship and we work with our partners to place students into a program that will work best based on their availability, location, and interests.\n\nNot all teens who apply will receive a SAS Scholarship, so we encourage participants to also apply to other programs and opportunities when making their summer plans.\n\nGo to our Summer Scholarships page for more information.\n\nAll 2024 regional award recipients will have been announced by March 29, 2024. Some regions announce their winners earlier, so please check with your local regional partners. To find your local regional partner, visit My Region page. All regional award winners are welcome to tune in to our virtual regional celebration in May 2024; we will inform winners once the date has been finalized.\n\nThe Alliance is dedicated to showcasing student work and raising awareness of the incredible talent, originality, and voice of teens through traveling exhibitions and special events. One way we accomplish this is through an extensive calendar of events, which includes the National Exhibition and the Traveling Exhibition. lengths of time take into account the timing of these events and the delivery and receipt of the work, as well as its photographing and/or framing.\n\nA selection of works by National Medalists will be included in the National Exhibition in New York City. The exhibition includes works that received American Voices & Visions, Gold Medal Portfolio, Silver Medal Portfolio, Gold Medal, and direct scholarships. We canât exhibit works that are oversized or that are shipped from an international address. Due to space limitations, we are not able to exhibit the works of all Medalists.\n\nA selection of National Medalist works will be included in the Awardsâ publications of teen art and teen writing. Participants are notified when their work is published and will receive a copy of the publication in which their work appears.\n\nIf your work receives a National Medal and you do not want it to be displayed in our gallery or in publications, please contact us and mention the title and category of your work.\n\nPortfolios are judged without knowledge of the participantâs gender, age, or hometown by artists and industry professionals. The top portfolios are then presented to a scholarship committee, which awards sixteen $12,500 Gold Medal Portfolio scholarships (eight writing and eight art). Additional $2,000 scholarships are given to students earning Silver Medal Portfolios. The committee consists of Alliance staff, board members, and national partners. The committee will review the personal statements that were submitted in addition to the six works. They consider a number of factors that combine the recognition of talent and the representation of diverse mediums, viewpoints, and backgrounds of Award recipients when selecting scholarship recipients.\n\nFor advice from a jurorâs perspective, view our Art Portfolio Panel and Writing Portfolio Panel.\n\nYes, 16 graduating seniors are chosen to receive the Gold Medal Portfolio Award, which is accompanied by a $12,500 scholarship. Scholarships of $2,000 are also given to Silver Medal Portfolio Award recipients as determined by the national portfolio panel. Additional direct scholarships for individual works are also provided annually.\n\nPlease note that not all National Medalists will receive a scholarship.\n\nEntry fees are $10.00 per individual entry and $30.00 per portfolio entry.\n\nThe Awards are presented by the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and its Affiliate Partners. Entry fees support both your regional program and the Alliance to cover the cost of processing, customer service, scholarships, ceremonies, exhibitions, publications, and other general operating costs.\n\nIf the fee is a barrier to any teenâs participation, we will waive the fee. Fee waivers are made possible, in part, by BLICK Art Materials.\n\nFor more guidance on how to complete entry fees, view our TeenÂ and Educator walkthrough videos on submitting payment.\n\nThe Alliance for Young Artists & Writers and its Affiliates will waive the entry fee if it presents a significant barrier to participation and if the student submits a Fee Waiver Form.
