MotorStorm: Pacific Rift is an extreme off-road racing game in which players choose various vehicles (monster trucks, ATVs and motorcycles) to compete across harsh landscapes and rocky terrain against other racers. Players can collide and crash into other players, sometimes causing vehicles to explode into pieces. During the gameplay, riders can taunt each other using various hand gestures (e.g., raising a middle finger or vigorous strokes of the air with a hand). Some female characters wear leather skin suits with large bustlines and cleavage, while others shake their posterior during certain menu selection screens. Some song lyrics also contain profanity (e.g., "b*tch," "damn," and "sh*t") as well as references to violent acts, including suicide.
