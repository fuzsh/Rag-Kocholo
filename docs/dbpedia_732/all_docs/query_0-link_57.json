        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nm1m1snake\n\n90%PlayStation 3\n\n35h Played\n\nA very good racing game, although not many people would be willing to spend 30 hours to win a racing game, and not even every race\n\nShareCompleted\n\nifte_a7\n\n70%PlayStation 3\n\nMotorstorm Pacific rift has 16 tracks and around 8 or 9 vehicle classes to race on & with. It's one of the most visually rich games on the PS3. The racing is frenetic, challenging and the campaign lengthy. Its fun, but ultimately quite frustrating for the likes of me. I rated this game down to 70% because it becomes painfully obvious that the game designers deliberately wanted to confuse and frustrate players. They've made a beautiful game with huge detail - which is always a bad thing in a racing game if you do not separate the track from the rest of the scene.\n\nMPR has multiple paths and thus the strategy of best vehicle to use & mastery of those paths. If you spend time learning the tracks and playing on all different vehicle classes, it will be a great game for you.\n\nI rated it down to 70% because I simply don't have that kind of time to play - so should I be punished for working full time? Should I be punished for not having as much focus or sharpness of my vision that I did as a teen (I'm 32). Its no big deal, I just don't wanna spend 20 hours mastering a racing game when in real life I've picked up so many crucial things to achieve. This real life focus has ruined a few games for me of late. That's sad for me, but I have to ask the question with every game - \"Why would I spend a month mastering this game when it will take away valuable time from family, finance and learning?\""
