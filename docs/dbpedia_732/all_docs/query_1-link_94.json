        "text": "Looks nice. Don't know how much fun it will be in the long run though.\n\nI just know that this game online is going to be AWESOME.\n\nYeah dispite the missing modes, I think online is going to give this game extreme value. Pretty much the only reason why I didnt pick up the JP version. It was so tempting but I think I'll have a better experience in feb/march with the NA version.\n\nAnyways, the video looked nice. Lots of cool crashes.\n\nThe MotorStorm demo is fun and immersive. I think if they introduce more game types as rumored (1 truck vs many bikes, 1 bike vs many trucks, ...), it should hold its own against the best, especially online.\n\nAs a bonus, there are also talks about adding more character/player animation. The only thing to watch (for me) is they don't screw up the physics and the quickness in the online game. Losing details is fine by me.\n\nIs it just me or do the ragdoll physics look better or more precise than in other games ? I usually notice little physics bugs in games where ragdoll models (re)act in a weird way or start twitching , stuff like that."
