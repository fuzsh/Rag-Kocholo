How the hell was this (almost) a goddamn launch game?\n\nSure, it's sparse on content, I can no longer play online etc., but the level design and distinct advantages/disadvantages of every vehichle type is just so goddamn good and balanced, even to this day!\n\nHeck, even the DualShock 3 works fine with it, didn't even have to switch to modern controllers.\n\nIt drives me nuts just thinking about what Evolution could've achieved on PS5, but... That'll sadly never happen.\n\nI can't help but wonder how close we would've gotten to the original vision in that initial CG-trailer. It's also sad that we'll never see any remastered 4K/60 version of the original game either... This goes for Driveclub as well (which still looks amazing, BTW).\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#2\n\nMotorstorm and Pacific Rift were incredible.\n\nIts a series I miss every day, I would be content with just a remaster of both games.\n\naerts1js\n\nMay 11, 2019\n\n1,495\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#4\n\nThey are great fun- the psp version underrated as well.\n\nIssen\n\nNov 12, 2017\n\n7,005\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#5\n\nMotorstorm is a fucking treasure, first game, pacifict rift and arctic edge especially. I miss the series very often and I liked DiRT 5 a lot because it gave me a glimpse of what Motorstorm used to be.\n\nTemascos\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n12,882\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#6\n\nIt's a series I miss dearly. I really wanted to see Evolution do another one in time for PS4's launch rather than DriveClub, but oh well. The different vehicles and routes approach was so much fun and not many games use that sadly.\n\nTransistor\n\nThe Walnut King\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n38,028\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#7\n\nI would kill for a PS5 Motorstorm\n\nDeleted member 9241\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n10,416\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#8\n\nThey are good but janky. It never felt like a AAA series to me. Honestly, I would love to see a modern-day, AAA Motorstorm game. I would buy it Day 1.\n\nThe 3D in Motorstorm Apocalypse was pretty good, but resolution took a massive hit.\n\nLinus815\n\nOct 29, 2017\n\n20,470\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#9\n\nill never understand why there was never remasters of them, they are not even using real cars, so it shouldve been fairly cheap too.\n\nNewDust\n\nVisited by Knack\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n6,819\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#10\n\nCall me crazy, but I did like Motorstorm more than Pacific Rift or Apocalypse, felt like the stakes were higher. That returned with Driveclub, which was an even better game.

First one was a stand out IMO and I'd love for a spiritual or real follow up, but at this point that feels like trying to capture lightning in a bottle.\n\nAssume Sony had already made the decision to shutter Evo before the mess with the launch - yes it was a mess but I don't know if you can lay that solely at the dev\n\nHuey\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n13,865\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#14\n\nIt drives me nuts just thinking about what Evolution could've achieved on PS5\n\nthe team was largely intact for DiRT 5 (as Codemaster Cheshire), but... that game seems to have ended that series as well :(\n\nTruly a cursed team, much as I love them\n\nKingDrool\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n1,542\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#15\n\nThese games were the most FUN I had on the PS3.

I loved that tracks were so uneven to drive on. You had to master the bumps and dips and it was punishing as hell sometimes. I feel like apocalypse tracks lacked that nuance but I didn't play more than 5 hours or so because the cars felt stuck to the road.\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#18\n\nLoved Motorstorm games; cared nothing for Driveclub.\n\nSidewinder\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n7,674\n\nSmokey\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n4,181\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#20\n\nPacific Rift was the best in the series.

Period.\n\nnewdivide\n\nOct 7, 2019\n\n99\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#22\n\nI played the PSP one a lot, very nice game. I would definitely pay for a new entry on PS5\n\nHuey\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n13,865\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#23\n\nAs fun as Dirt 5 was/is, it's still a very different type of racing game... I might go back to that as well, though.\n\nBut I agree, it's really tragic for the team. I was happy when I read that they got employed.\n\nOh, and we also need a way better spiritual successor than Onrush.\n\nYeah I was just saying that we effectively have seen what they'd achieve on PS5. I enjoyed it... but the early hype about it being an MS spiritual successor was a bit overblown, it didn't have that vibe. Without multiple track routes and over the top crashes, it's lacking some pretty core elements. The game wasn't even up to the standard of DiRT 1-3.\n\nAnd I agree about OnRush - I love this team to pieces but some of their choices and execution over the years was pretty shaky. I'm happy some people loved OnRush but clearly a majority of folks didn't, game absolutely bombed.\n\nKingK\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n4,984\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#24\n\nPacific Rift is still my favorite racing game ever.\n\nI'd kill for 4K/60fps remasters with Dualsense support. There's just hardly ever these track based arcade racers anymore.\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#25\n\nThe Motorstorm franchise had a rocky start and sadly, a rocky end as well. Pacific Rift is literally one of the all-time greatest arcade racers ever made. I'd argue Apocalypse is equally wonderful but for different reasons. It's actually a throwback to racers from prior generations, much more along the lines of something like Speed Devils with the environmental flair, but taken to an highly entertaining extreme.\n\nI didn't like Driveclub. It was pretty, but it felt a bit soulless to me. Wish they were still around, but I'm also not surprised things kind of fizzled out from there.\n\ngoonergaz\n\nNov 18, 2017\n\n1,711\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#26\n\nNot enough love for RC IMHO\n\nTendo\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n10,712\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#27\n\nI would kill for a 60fps 1080p version of these.\n\nArukado\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n3,494\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#29\n\nAmazing games, 1 and 2.

I think this was the first PS3 game I played. And once I figured out how to output it to 1080i I was shocked at the visuals for a few minutes until I got into the game.\n\nArn\n\nProphet of Truth\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n5,962\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#32\n\nPS3 launch night with Motorstorm on a big HD TV was absolutely incredible. We don't see that level of fidelity jump nowadays, it's a shame. They were definitely closed too soon.\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#33\n\nI've never felt so vulnerable in a videogame as I did riding a motorcycle in a Motorstorm game. I was hoping On Rush would've recaptured some of the fun but the game types just didn't do it for me.\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#34\n\nI would kill for a PS5 Motorstorm\n\nSame.\n\nLots of us would.\n\nPretty sure this is how we reach the end of humanity.

Now its about expanding and acquisitions. Funny world.

Pacific Rift was really good too, but I didn't grab it day 1 like I did the original and I kind of regret that. Though by that point my interest in arcade racers had kind of diminished.\n\n^And yeah, John's retrospective on this series was well done.\n\nNever bothered with Apocalypse. It just looked too different from what I most loved about the first two games, namely the lack of mud slinging and exotic locales. Didn't really care for the IMO novelty focus on the environmental storms tearing up the tracks though I'm sure it's still a solid enough game.\n\nRavelle\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n18,533\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#44\n\nBrb imagining a PS5 exclusive Motorstorm.\n\nThat's the dream\n\nTigerGD\n\nOct 29, 2017\n\n214\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#45\n\nDirt 5 is my most-played game of this generation, and the podcasts in the game hinted that the next one would include bikes. Now it's looking like we may never get a Dirt 6 and my heart is broken.\n\nIztok\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n6,426\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#46\n\nMotorstorm is a classic, but Driveclub should've gotten a PS4 Pro patch.\n\nDirt 5 is easily the worst in that series and outright killed my FAVORITE racing series and OnRush was straight garbage, sorry. Barely a game. I'm sorry I know people like that game but for the life of me I can''t figure out why and I give no quarter to terrible racing games, as it's my favorite genre.\n\nRegardless, I choose to remember them for MotorStorm and will love them forever for it. They did straight up murder my Dirt, still. They did.\n\nIwao\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n12,159\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#47\n\nMotorStorm has so much current-gen potential, especially with PSVR2 on the horizon. :cries:\n\nIztok\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n6,426\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#48\n\nI wish the studio was still around, all of their games were good to great despite Driveclub's issues.\n\nDirt 5 I found boring and a poor follow up to Dirt 1/2/3, not sure what happened there.\n\nRight, I'm still trying to get thru it as it's not *terrible*, but it's so far off the greatness of Dirt up to 3.\n\nI mean, it's a different developer, so it makes sense, but they should've stuck to the original formula more.\n\nWere probably given direction to move it away from Dirt Rally even more, I'm guessing.\n\nHOSKINGJ\n\nJan 5, 2018\n\n119\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\n#49\n\nTo anyone who's feeling extra nostalgic, I'd recommend watching Dark1x's video, he really puts into words what made the series special.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/Hmzt7D1C19Q\n\nI saw this, it's utterly brilliant. Thanks John!"
