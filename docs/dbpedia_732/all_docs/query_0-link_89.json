And finally (without counting PSP’s Artic Edge and RC game), MotorStorm: Apocalypse, a good game, with many changes but it hadn’t the success it deserved.\n\nNow, Evolution is ready to show their new project, during the PlayStation Meeting 2013 next wednesday. It’s going to be another arcade racer, but not a MotorStorm. I was going to prepare a Feature with all the tracks starting in March, will see I’ve enough time xD (until then, you’ve the official page of the game with lots of content http://www.motorstorm.com/). Today, we remember the intro videos of these three MotorStorm games:\n\nEdit 2016/10/24: finally added MotorStorm: Arctic Edge Intro.\n\nMotorStorm (PS3, 2006-2007)\n\nMotorStorm: Pacific Rift (2008)\n\nMotorStorm: Arctic Edge (2009)"
