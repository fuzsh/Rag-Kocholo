        "text": "MotorStorm RC\n\nRacing 22 February 2012\n\nContinuation of the well-known series of racing games. Unlike the previous titles in the cycle, the main heroes of the game are remote-controlled car models, which will be racing on one of the 16 available tracks.\n\nPS3PSV\n\nMotorstorm Apocalypse\n\nRacing 16 March 2011\n\nThe third installment of a series of spectacular racing games in which the player takes control of several types of vehicles. The action takes place in a powerful metropolis destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake. The authors took care of the possibility of a wide modification of the appearance of the vehicles (among which there are both cars and motorcycles) - from decorative patterns, additional visible parts, to a complete change of shape.\n\nPS3\n\nMotorStorm 3D Rift\n\nRacing 24 August 2010\n\nTruncated version of MotorStorm: Pacific Rift racing game, enriched with support for 3D technology. This is a stand-alone title and does not require a tile with a full version of the Pacific Rift. The authors offered 10 tropical routes on which we use vehicles such as motorcycles, buggies, trucks and monster trucks.\n\nPS3\n\nMotorStorm: Arctic Edge\n\nRacing 18 September 2009\n\nThe next installment of the series of races known from PlayStation 3. This time we can race in the icy Alaskan terrain, sitting behind the wheel of vehicles such as snowmobile and snowmobile.\n\nPS2PSP\n\nMotorStorm: Pacific Rift\n\nRacing 28 October 2008\n\nContinuation of the popular racing game. The competition takes place in difficult terrain, and drivers use, among others, motorcycles, quads, off-road vehicles or trucks. The game is distinguished by detailed graphics.\n\nPS3\n\nMotorStorm\n\nRacing 06 March 2007\n\nMotorStorm is a production prepared by Evolution Studios (a bastion of World Rally Championship series creators), which deals with off-road races. This is the first production of this team dedicated to PlayStation 3. However, this title breaks with traditional rallying in favour of a fierce and competitive fight between different types of vehicles.\n\nPS3"
