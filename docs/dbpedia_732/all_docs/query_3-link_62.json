        "text": "So I just beat Split/Second and I'm in the mood for some more arcade racers. I've also moved my PS3 into the bedroom so I'm looking around at if there are any PS3 games I've missed I could pick up now\n\nI've never really paid much attention to the MotorStorm games, so I wanted to know how these are, and if they're worth a punt in 2021?\n\nI assume these all run at 30fps, is that right?\n\nWhat do you think, Era?\n\nThey are must played as the arcade racer genre and especially the off road niche not doing good.\n\nI'd play for curiosity a bit of the original, but its not amazing. Experience the tracks, the mud play, the carnage. But the loading are unbearables.\n\nPacific Rift is a masterpiece of level, track and environement design.\n\nApocalypse is good fun and a technical marvel but its not as good. Too messy imho compared to PR but its damn fun\n\nPacific Rift is still one of my favourite racers, it's hard as balls though. A simple 4k60 remaster would be fantastic.\n\nIt seems like it would be pretty easy to do a 4k 60fps collection but I'm not sure how many people still care about the IP\n\nI'm in favour of all racing games being remastered to 60fps anyway\n\nPacific Rift is the best followed by Arctic Edge on PSP. Apocalypse is fine but it plays and feels quite different to the other games in that it's not as \"rugged\" control wise, so it loses a bit of what makes the series feel unique (Kinda like Killzone 2 vs 3). RC is actually not bad either if you're a fan of top down racers, but it's really nothing like Motorstorm lol. Like mentioned though, they tend to have pretty bad rubber banding, which is where most of the difficulty comes from.\n\nRift is the best but I have a nostalgia for the original.\n\nAlso, Ridge Racer 7! (if you haven't played it)\n\nI decided to get that as well since I just watched the DF Retro on it today, but yeah I'm noticing there are fewer and fewer PS3 games in second hand stores now so I'm making an effort to pick up anything I don't yet have on PS3\n\nI've also got a Series S so I can get some of these games on that digitally, though obviously not stuff like RR7 or MotorStorm\n\nThe first one has the best physics. They even approach with a more sim expert guys.\n\nThe subsequent went for a more arcade style (big jumps and less bumpy races, more fast paced).\n\nAll of them are insanely good but the AI is totally unfair (+100 levels of rubberbanding).\n\nHad crazy fun with all of them, and by the way still have them here with me and my PS3.\n\nThe first one has the best physics. They even approach with a more sim expert guys.\n\nI seem to remember it was pretty blighted by early gen issues like load times and stuff. But, from memory, it was the only one that had the fully deforming courses. Very vaguely had its chance at being an established franchise, got the two spin off games. Really should have had a showing on the PS4.\n\nAbandoning all racing games for Gran Turismo was a bit of a move, especially as the pendulum seems to be swinging away from sim racing.\n\nThey are all individually different and fun in their own way.\n\nPart one is more Sim like, imo... realistic graphics. Still love it for the physics and collisions. Worth it to experience.\n\nPart 2 is obviously stylistic tropical locations...exotic and crazy locations. Added new mechanics to the racing. More arcadish. Beautiful game! 4 player splitscreen! Wish Sony would have someone port this for the Switch! Would make money imo. 🤷🏾‍♂️\n\nPart 3 is just straight Arcadish, movie like experience. Just fun to experience. But does not hold up playing over and over, without Online Multiplayer. IMO. BUT Crazy legit 3D experience.\n\nAlso why add \"None of them are worth playing\"? to the options when you know most who click that, have probably never played all three games.\n\nThey are all individually different and fun in their own way.\n\nAlso why add \"None of them are worth playing\"? to the options when you know most who click that, have probably never played all three games.\n\nIt may be someones view, and if it is, at least they don't then also make that post in the thread\n\nPacific Rift is incredible. It's probably my favorite arcade racer from that gen.\n\nNow Apocalypse...I have to say this is one of the most exciting racers I've ever played. It just came out at a really bad time. There's a gif floating around of like a tornado blowing a building that is on fire and breaking apart at the same time in front of the player...that is what the game is like at all times. It's just a constant thrill ride.\n\n30 fps kind of kills it for me. Wouldn't mind a remaster though.\n\nIt's still fun imo. But if need 60fps...and you have a PS5, the PS4 game Gravel reminded me of Motorstorm Pacific Rift.\n\nIf you turn off HDR in the PS5 settings, it runs that at 60fps.\n\nWas hoping for a Next Gen Sequel, but Milestone might have, unfortunately, permanently moved to Hotwheels going forward.\n\nThis is one of the few games that had something found in DriveClub, other car's head lights.. lighting up the interior of your car.\n\nAlso OP, if you get part 1... make sure you download the patch if possible. The original car selection section tried to render each car and that slowed down the whole process.....and it's quite annoying. But an update changed it, and is much quicker."
