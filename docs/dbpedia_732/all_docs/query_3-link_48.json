        "text": "How long did it take people to realize car races are more fun when stuff blows up? Did our great-grandparents go to races 100 years ago hoping to see an Underslung burst into flames?\n\nI ask because that’s basically all “Motorstorm Apocalypse” is — a series of increasingly grandiose explosions. Sure, racing is what you’ll be doing, with myriad vehicles at your disposal, from muscle cars to monster trucks to four-wheelers. The focus is on all the crazy destruction happening around you, though. You’re not speeding your motorcycle or supercar down a track but through the ruins of a massive city that is literally crumbling around you as you race. It’d be Michael Bay’s dream video game if it had more ethnic stereotypes.\n\nOh, wait, it does have those, in the miserable collection of barely animated cut scenes passed off as a story. Thankfully, you can skip past every single one of them. You might want to watch them for the unintentional comedy, though. They are hilariously shameless in their attempt to appeal to the nebulous “extreme” lifestyle that exists primarily in commercials. With their minimal animation and embarrassing X Games attitude, these vignettes are what “Clutch Cargo” would look like if Poochie from “The Simpsons” was the main character.\n\nThat’s not the only problem in “Motorstorm.” The exploding environment recalls last year’s racer “Split/Second,” but with a crucial difference. In “Split/Second,” racers could blow up buildings or collapse bridges at the push of a button after building up a meter during the race. Bringing a city down upon your opponents was as vital a piece of strategy as tossing a turtle shell in “Mario Kart.”\n\nYou never have any control over the destruction in “Motorstorm.” It’s merely something you react to, and often without enough time to avoid hazards. You will crash repeatedly on a track until you memorize it, and often for reasons that aren’t immediately apparent. The destruction in “Split/Second” is tactical; in “Motorstorm” it’s just frustrating.\n\nI waited until the PlayStation Network was back up to review “Motorstorm” because online multiplayer is a big part of any competitive head-to-head game these days. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get in a game. I made multiple attempts to leave the lobby, but I couldn’t find 16 players. Maybe explosions aren’t as big a draw for race fans as I thought."
