        "text": "*******update*******SEE MY REPLY LATER IN THIS THREAD WHICH NOW STATES THAT SOME WHEELS ARE NOW OFFICALLY SUPPORTED........(AND THE NEW EDIT MODE TOO)............********.\n\nSo after the 2 previous Motorstorm games didn't have wheel support, at last, and after patch 1.02 my G25 now works with the game!!\n\nI'm a big wheel user (especially on GT5), and now struggle to go back to using a game pad on car games, but I had the 2 previous MS games so decided to get this one. I was amazed after 1.02 that I discovered (by accident as I forgot to unplug my G25 after a GT5 session), that the wheel worked.\n\nIt seems this is just the start, as some of the developers have reported that a future patch will provide 'full' wheel support within the options screen.\n\nThe feedback currently, for an arcade racer, isn't too bad. The feedback is there, all be it a little bit light, although that also depends on which vehicle you are using, and bikes do feel weird, but you get use to it. I also find it a bit too sensitive, but again, you do get use to it. Mind you, I do find I have to use the bonnet view to get a real driving feel with the wheel, using outside chase cam just doesn't do it for me.\n\nSo what would I like to see in this 'full' wheel support in a future planned patch:-\n\n1) The ability to increase force feedback strength to more than what it currently is.\n\n2) The ability to map buttons for the wheel. Currently the wheel paddles are used for handbrake and boost. I'd prefer buttons on the wheel maybe?\n\n3) The ability to choose the sensitivity of the wheel.\n\n4) The ability to choose how much steering lock....maybe 180 to 900 degrees?\n\nThis would then make this arcade racer amazing, especially with all the other DLC that we've heard planned, i.e new Alcatraz track, mode editor, new cars etc.\n\nNot sure if everyone is aware, but Motorstorm Apocalypse does now OFFICALLY support some wheels. This went live back in August, but I've been too busy playing other great games.\n\nMy G25 is now supported, and you can change sensitivity (I use 30%), and force feedback (I use 100%) within controller options from the pause menu in game. Buttons cannot be mapped but the default is very good, takes bit of getting use to using the clutch as a handbrake, for example, but it's great fun.\n\nI find that some of the vehicles are still very light in their feedback, but if you use, say a supercar, or trucks, to me, the game has been transformed, although I find I have to use bonnet view as using a wheel in chase cam is sort of strange.\n\nAlso, the EDIT MODE, is now in the game, which allows users to create their own types of games, with different variables on things such as boost (I like non boost for example), shockwave range, tyre grip, anti roll bars, constant accelaration, reverse controllers........... the list is huge.\n\nIf you don't have this game, but have a wheel, now's the time to go and buy it at a budget price. I think its' the best arcade racer that supports wheels."
