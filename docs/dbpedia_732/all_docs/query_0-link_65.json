These cars are split into 8 types (Monster Truck, Racing Truck, Buggy, etc.) and there are few models for each types and each models offer you different paint jobs and colors.\n\nI can tell different types have different performance, for example, some types offer better grip and others offer better acceleration, however there's no indication what are the strengths (or stats) of each model. I was wondering if there's a reason, other than aesthetic, to pick a specific model for each type."
