        "text": "Arcade Driving Physics\n\nAn Arcade-style racer is a game which shoots for a fun and fast-paced experience over trying to simulate real life physics and racing protocol.\n\nBoost\n\nBoost takes a game to a new level giving players a greater level of speed. This speed opens up new doors to sports games, driving games, and any game that can benefit from the reward of speed.\n\nBurnout\n\nForced Wheel spin where the brake is applied and the gas pedal is floored, therefore spinning the tires, then releasing the brake for a small boost. Not meant to be done, but a popular showboating technique.\n\nCinematic Jump\n\nA concept used in many racing and action games in which your vehicle or character is airborne and shot at an awesome angle, often in slow-mo.\n\nDownloadable Content\n\nDownloadable Content adds new features and content to already-distributed video games via the Internet. Examples include new maps for FPS games, new songs for rhythm games, and new cars for racing games.\n\nGreatest Hits\n\nGreatest hits is a general term for re-releases of games which have sold a certain number of copies, as part of a program managed by the console manufacturer.\n\nHavok Physics\n\nHavok Physics (Havok) is a physics API developed by Irish company Havok and released in 2000. It is used in video games as a physics engine, allowing for realistic interactions between in-game entities.\n\nLens Flare\n\nLens Flare is a dynamic graphical effect that emulates visual artifacts that can appear on an image captured by a camera with a lens. This effect is not limited only to sunlight.\n\nLoading Screen Advice\n\nSome games will give the player hints and tips on how to play while the game loads.\n\nMirror Mode\n\nA popular mode in racing games in which players drive the various courses mirrored (example, a turn that used to be to the left is now to the right, etc...)\n\nMotion Control\n\nUsing gestures with the controller to control on-screen actions. Alternatively, these gestures can also be detected by motion-sensing cameras.\n\nPack-In Game\n\nGame bundled with gaming hardware (usually a console) in order to boost sales. Most often these games are first party titles, meaning that the hardware and software are products of the same company.\n\nPlatform Exclusive\n\nThird-party developers and publishers occasionally engage in the practice of releasing a title or piece of DLC on only one platform for any number of reasons. Sometimes these are permanent while others are only platform exclusive for a certain window of time.\n\nReversible Cover Art\n\nGames that have art on the inside of the game case, to double the decoration.\n\nScreen Splatter\n\nOften found in either very violent games, or games taking place in or around water, Screen Splatter is a visual representation of blood, water, strawberry jam, or other liquids temporarily obscuring the player's field of vision.\n\nShaky Cam\n\nShakey Cam is the use of shaking the camera in a game in order to give the feeling of chaos, disorientation or realism. It is usually used in action games when moving at fast speeds or when a large impact or explosion occurs."
