One of the games that caught our eye (and, according to reports, only hit the show floor on the second day) was MotorStorm. This PS3 title is a racing game that mixes dirt bikes, big ol' rigs, and various dune buggies to race against each other in a demolition derby-style mud track.

While this is nothing we haven't seen before, the physics were solid, and the game controlled well. There was a great sense of attitude to the game: during one of the slow motion crashes the driver of a truck leaned out and gave me the bird as he drove past. The different type of vehicles looks like they'll add some variety to the racing. The title will include seven classes of vehicles at launch; only the buggy was playable in demo form.

The graphics were solid, but unspectacular. There was some good use of motion blur, and while the frame rate tended to be on the low side it was very playable. While this may seem like bad news, a game that looks and plays this solidly while only 50% done is probably headed for great things. The racing was very intense, with the big rigs bullying the littler cars and buggies, and the bikers using their speed and maneuverability to their advantage.

After talking to the man giving us the demo he assured us they were shooting for 1080p as the final resolution for the game, although the demo we were playing now was only running in 720p. This wouldn't be a big deal, but the televisions showing the demo had 1080 HD stickers on the lower right hand corner. This came across as a little bit of a lie, and Sony once again trying to make a point with their resolutions.

This is going to be one to watch, and as long as they continue along the path they've started while getting the frame rate and resolution bumped up they're going to have a hit on their hands. This is a launch title I'm going to keep my eye on.
