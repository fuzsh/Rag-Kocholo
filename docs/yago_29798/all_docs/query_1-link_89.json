        "text": "It wouldn't be a great power by any practical means, the population just isn't there (9,784,400 in 1900). However it could have a disproportionately large impact on German policy, as it would be large enough to not be reduced to the status of de-facto German protectorate, meaning German planners will have to always consider Scandinavian Revanchism as a threat just as real as French Revanchism. Perhaps, flanked on three sides, Germany's policies are a bit more centred on the home front with less wasted on colonialism map painting ventures. Alternatively the necessity to be capable of seizing the Danish Straits, could lead to a more aggressive naval expansion, which would put Britain in the French camp quicker.\n\nIt would also likely retain the Danish West Indies at least until decolonization, barring any sort of war where they are likely to be seized.\n\nThe German government in and of itself spent piddily squat (relative to its contemporaries) on the colonization game: most of its Empire it acquired either at bargin basement prices because nobody else was interested in it or, in the case of their one moderately developed/major colony (German East Africa), because the private Society for German Colonization essentially presented Berlin with an ultimatum. Certainly, though, the security of Kiel would come into question if relations between the new Scandinavia and the German polity are sour rather than friendly (Remember, the POD is 1865; the German Empire isen't a thing yet). Personally, I think the two would feel a sense of kinship and Prussia would actually try to ally or at least work out a co-operative relationship with the new country due to economic interests and allow for free use of the Straits, negating the need to build a Kiel Canal.\n\nA bigger impact is likely to be seen on Russia and Britain, as Scandinavia now has sufficient economic and military power potential to make trying to sway her to their side in their ongoing rivalry worth it in terms of which such an alliance/friendship could bring to regional issues and the broader balance of naval power. A British-aligned Scandinavia locks down Russia as a naval threat just as much as a Russian-aligned Scandinavia dramatically expands her power projection potential during the prime decades of Russian ascendancy\n\nThe German government in and of itself spent piddily squat (relative to its contemporaries) on the colonization game: most of its Empire it acquired either at bargin basement prices because nobody else was interested in it or, in the case of their one moderately developed/major colony (German East Africa), because the private Society for German Colonization essentially presented Berlin with an ultimatum.\n\nThe German government didn't spend much on the colonies themselves, but they did have to spend quite a bit on maintaining large a military presence in their colonies.\n\nCertainly, though, the security of Kiel would come into question if relations between the new Scandinavia and the German polity are sour rather than friendly (Remember, the POD is 1865; the German Empire isen't a thing yet).\n\nAfter 1865 a united German polity is inevitable, all that matters are some details regarding the whos and whens. Whatever the outcome, it's going to be a polity that occupies majority Danish territory. If the Scandinavians feel enough kinship to unify they feel enough kinship to openly bear a grudge.\n\nPersonally, I think the two would feel a sense of kinship\n\nYeah they both have Danish majority areas within their borders, that's something in common. Unless the Germans cede South Jutland the two probably won't get along.\n\nand Prussia would actually try to ally or at least work out a co-operative relationship with the new country due to economic interests and allow for free use of the Straits, negating the need to build a Kiel Canal.\n\nAs I mentioned in my post, OTL's Denmark was already a de-facto protectorate of Germany. They built the canal anyways.\n\nA bigger impact is likely to be seen on Russia and Britain, as Scandinavia now has sufficient economic and military power potential to make trying to sway her to their side in their ongoing rivalry worth it in terms of which such an alliance/friendship could bring to regional issues and the broader balance of naval power. A British-aligned Scandinavia locks down Russia as a naval threat just as much as a Russian-aligned Scandinavia dramatically expands her power projection potential during the prime decades of Russian ascendancy\n\nThat's an interesting aspect. Could a Russia aligned Scandinavia drive Britain to the German party? (assuming the Dreikaiserbund still breaks down as per OTL)"
