        "text": "by Scott Mehl © Unofficial Royalty 2015\n\nQueen Lovisa of Sweden was the wife of King Carl XV of Sweden (also King Karl IV of Norway). She was born Princess Wilhelmina Frederika Alexandrine Anna Louise of the Netherlands on August 5, 1828, in The Hague, the Netherlands. Her father, Prince Frederik of the Netherlands, was a son of King Willem I of the Netherlands, and her mother, Princess Luise of Prussia, was a daughter of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia. She had three younger siblings:\n\nPrince Frederik (1833 – 1834) – died at 16 months old\n\nPrince Willem (1836 – 1846) – died at 9 years old\n\nPrincess Marie (1845 – 1910) – married Wilhelm, Prince of Wied, had issue\n\nPrincess Louise was educated by a governess, studying French, German, English, Russian, and piano. Following her confirmation in 1845, a hunt began to find a suitable husband for the young princess. In 1849, she met Prince Carl of Sweden, the son and heir of King Oscar I, and negotiations were soon underway to arrange a marriage between the two. While Louise was enamored of her future husband from their first meeting, he found her unattractive. However, King Oscar wanted to create familial ties between the relatively new Bernadotte dynasty and the other long-established European dynasties. With Louise’s Dutch and Prussian families and the promise of a large dowry, she was an ideal candidate. Prince Carl eventually conceded to his father’s wishes and the couple’s engagement was announced in February 1850. Louise quickly learned to speak Swedish, although she never studied Norwegian.\n\nLouise and Carl were married on June 19, 1850, at the Storkyrkan in Stockholm, Sweden and the couple had two children:\n\nPrincess Louise (1851-1926) – married King Frederik VIII of Denmark, had issue\n\nPrince Carl Oscar (1852-1854) – died in childhood\n\nThe marriage was an unhappy one. Lovisa (as she was now known) was desperately in love with her husband, but he was consistently unfaithful to her. Having had complications in her second pregnancy, Louise was unable to bear any more children. Following their son’s death in 1854, leaving no male heir to inherit the throne, Lovisa offered her husband a divorce, which he declined.\n\nUpon her father-in-law’s death on July 8, 1859, her husband ascended the thrones of Sweden and Norway and Lovisa became Queen. She was crowned with her husband in Sweden on May 3, 1860, and in Norway on August 5, 1860. She was the first Queen in the union of Sweden and Norway to be crowned in both countries, as the two previous consorts had been Catholic and could not be crowned in Norway.\n\nUnlike her predecessors, Lovisa took little interest in politics. Instead, she put her efforts into philanthropic work, founding and supporting numerous charities in both Sweden and Norway. She preferred these activities to those of the formal court functions she was required to attend as Queen and often feigned illness to avoid attending. However, she did suffer from ill health, often experiencing fainting spells, and at least once having what may have been an epileptic seizure. The cause of these maladies was typically attributed to her husband’s affairs.\n\nLovisa traveled to the Netherlands to be at her mother’s deathbed in late 1870. Upon returning, her husband fell ill and she nursed him back to health. Physically drained, Lovisa contracted pneumonia and died on March 30, 1871, at the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden. She was buried at the Riddarholm Churchen in Stockholm, Sweden. Despite their strained relationship, King Carl XV was reportedly distraught at Lovisa’s death and died a year and a half later.\n\nKingdom of Sweden Resources at Unofficial Royalty\n\nKingdom of Sweden Index\n\nSwedish Orders and Honours\n\nSwedish Royal Dates\n\nSwedish Royal Burial Sites\n\nSwedish Royal Christenings\n\nSwedish Royal FAQs\n\nSwedish Royal Residences\n\nSwedish Royal Weddings\n\nLine of Succession to the Throne of Sweden\n\nProfiles of the Swedish Royal Family"
