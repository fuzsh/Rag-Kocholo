His coronation took place in Gamla Uppsala in 1210. The Mediaeval Swedish kings were usually elected by acclamation at the Mora Stone near Uppsala, and although there is no trustworthy records of any pre-1210 coronations, it is impossible to prove that the tradition of anointing and crowning kings was not practiced by 1210. There is not much we know about the Mediaeval Swedish regalia, apart from the fact that they had existed. A letter written in 1311 mentions that King Birger Magnusson entrusted his regalia to the cathedral chapter in Uppsala. Another two sources, the Annals of Vadstena and the Sture Chronicles, recorded the redemption of two crowns belonging to King Eric XIII of Pomerania by King Charles VIII Knutsson (15th c.). The crowns were used during Eric XIII’s coronation at Kalmar (1397). The crowns were made of gold and adorned with gemstones. They disappeared for good in the times of King Christian I (reigned 1457-1464).\n\nThe accession of the Vasa Dynasty marked the introduction of the new Swedish regalia which has been preserved down to our own times. Unlike the Mediaeval Swedish kings, who had been crowned in many various churches across Sweden (LinkÃ¶ping, SÃ¶derkÃ¶ping, Stockholm, StrÃ¤ngnÃ¤s, Uppsala) the Vasa kings followed the tradition of being crowned in Uppsala and from 17th c. also in Stockholm. Two swords of state of King Gustavus I Vasa from 16th c. are the oldest pieces of Swedish regalia. His son Eric XIV made minutious preparations for his own coronation in 1561. He had instructed his envoy in London to study the English coronation ceremonies in order to employ them at Swedish coronations. The king ordered a new set of regalia for his coronation. The crown, the orb and the sceptre of Eric XIV had been made in 1561 and were used during subsequent Swedish coronations until the last one of Oscar II in 1873.\n\nThe crown of Eric XIV was made in Stockholm in 1561 by the Flemish goldsmith Cornelis ver Weiden. The crown, which is the corona clausa, is made of gold rim and four gold arches and eight palmettes. It is surmounted by a gold globe with a cross. The crown is set with numerous pearls and gemstones (diamonds, emeralds, rubies). It is adorned with enamel. Inside the crown there is a cap made of red velvet embroidered with gold and pearls. The ornament has been subjected to a number of alterations over the years and damaged on several occasions. The Chancellor Nils Gyllenstjerna had dropped it in 1568 at Eric XIV’s wedding banquet, and it fell off King Charles XII’s head following his coronation ceremony in 1697 when the king was mounting his horse. Dimensions: height - 23.7 cm, diameter of the rim - 18x24.4 cm, weight - 1.715 kg.\n\nThe sceptre of Eric XIV was made in Stockholm in 1561 by Hans Heidenrik. It is made of gold decorated with enamel, set with pearls and gems (diamonds, rubies and sapphires). Dimensions: length - 80.9 cm, weight - 1.417 kg.\n\nThe orb of Eric XIV was made in Stockholm in 1561 by Cornelis ver Weiden and in Antwerp by Frantz Beijer in 1568. It is made of gold and set with pearls. The Swedish orb is quite unique as it contains engraved map of the world executed by Frantz Beijer. The orb is toped with a small orb covered in blue enamel and with a cross on its top. The orb was damaged during the coronation of Charles XI in 1675 when the Chancellor of the Realm, Magnus de la Gardie, who carried it in the regalia procession, was thrown off by his horse. Dimensions: height - 16.5 cm, width - 11.8 cm, weight - 676 g.\n\nThe Crown of Maria Eleanora (1620)\n\nGunilla Bjelke’s orb was made in 1585 in Stockholm by Frantz Beijer. It was made of gold and set with 27 pearls. Dimensions: height - 17.9 cm, diameter - 13.1 cm, weight - 491.5 g.\n\nGunilla Bjelke’s sceptre was made in 1585 in Stockholm. It was made of gold and set with 8 pearls and 12 diamonds. Dimensions: length - 68 cm, weight - 847.5 g.\n\nMaria Eleanora’s crown was made in Stockholm in 1620 by Ruprecht Miller. It had been ordered for the wedding and coronation of the new queen because the Queen-Dowager, Christina, was still alive and used the Swedish Queen’s regalia. Maria Eleanora’s crown, which is the corona clausa, is made of gold and black and blue enamel. Richly set with diamonds and rubies. It consists of a rim and eight arches surmounted by a blue enamel globe adorned with small crowns with a cross set with diamonds on its top. In 1650 four new arches were added to the crown for the coronation of Queen Christina. In 1751 the crown underwent further alterations for the coronation of Adolphus Frederick. The crown is fitted with cap of purple atlas, gold embroidered and adorned with numerous diamonds. Dimensions: height - 18.4 cm, diameter of the rim - 17.8x21.4 cm, weight - 2.506 kg.\n\nMaria Eleanora’s sceptre was made in Stockholm in 1620 by Ruprecht Miller. It is made of gold and it has silver gilt foot. Adorned with blue and yellow enamel and set with diamonds and rubies. Dimensions: height - 15.3 cm, weight - 410 g.\n\nLouise Ulrica’s crown was made in 1751 in Stockholm by Andreas Almgren. The crown was commissioned for the queen’s coronation because the king was to wear Maria Eleanora’s crown. It had been designed by Jean Eric Rehn who modeled the crown on the one made in 1725 for the French Queen Maria Leszczynska of Poland. It is made of gilt silver. The crown, which is the corona clausa, consists of rim and eight arches surmounted by a blue enamel globe adorned with small crowns with a cross on its top. Originally the crown was set with 695 diamonds. Later these were replaced with polished rock crystals. The cap is made of red material embroidered with sequins. Dimensions: height - 12.6 cm, diameter of the rim - 13.1 cm, weight - 527.5 g.\n\nSince the last Swedish coronation (1873) Swedish regalia have been displayed on a number of royal occasions such as accessions of new monarchs, royal weddings etc. In 1907 the regalia had been transferred to the vaults of the Bank of Sweden where they were kept until 1969. Since 1969 they have been on permanent exhibition in the vaults of the Treasury in the Royal Palace in Stockholm.\n\nThe Crown of Louisa Ulrica (1751)\n\nSWEDISH ROYAL STANDARDS\n\n01.
