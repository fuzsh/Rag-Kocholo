        "text": "Uncomfortable with ceremonial and pomp, Queen Juliana abolished the curtsey and other formalities which she considered to be outdated; and she spent as much time as she could with her four daughters, claiming that her maternal duties were as important to her as they were to any other woman.\n\nThe richest reigning monarch in Europe, Queen Juliana was also profoundly religious and ever concerned for the less fortunate and for the afflicted. In 1953, when devastating floods in Zeeland and South Holland claimed the lives of 1,600 people, the Queen visited the disaster area at once.\n\nClad in an old coat, boots and a head scarf, she travelled by boat, helicopter and aircraft to the worst-stricken spots, and for several days helped personally with the rescue work. In the aftermath, she was closely involved in the Delta Project, for a new rampart to withstand the North Sea.\n\nSuch actions inspired the esteem the Dutch people; and the Queen's personal popularity would prove a crucial factor in helping the Dutch monarchy weather the political storm created by her husband Prince Bernhard's involvement in the Lockheed scandal of the 1970s.\n\nJuliana Louise Emma Marie Wilhelmina, Princess of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau and Duchess of Mecklenburg, was born in The Hague on April 30 1909, the only child of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Henry of the Netherlands. Prince Henry was the youngest son of Friedrich Franz II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nQueen Wilhelmina had ascended the throne aged 10, on the death of her father King William III in 1890; her mother, the Queen Dowager Emma (a first-cousin of the dreamy Carmen Sylva, Queen Elisabeth of Romania), served as a most effective Regent until 1898. Soon after her accession, Queen Wilhelmina paid a visit to England to stay with Queen Victoria - who is reputed to have said to her young guest, \"As we're two Queens together, we can say what we like.\"\n\nIn 1920 her further education was placed in the hands of a tutor, Dr J H Gunning Willemszoon, while her mother instructed her in religious matters. Aged 18, in 1927, Princess Juliana, now Crown Princess, became simultaneously a member of the Council of State and a full member of the Dutch Reformed Church.\n\nThat year she also enrolled as an undergraduate at Leyden University, founded in 1574 by William the Silent (after whose mother, Juliana, the Princess had been named). There she followed a broad course comprising pre-Napoleonic Dutch law, international law, Dutch and French literature, religious history and hydraulics. She acquired a knowledge of seven languages, and won a prize for writing (anonymously) a student song.\n\nDuring the Depression of the 1930s, Princess Juliana formed the National Crisis Committee and served as its honorary chairman for five years, acquiring an intimate experience of economic distress across the nation. After her father's death in 1934, she took on the presidency of the Netherlands Red Cross. In November 1934, she was a bridesmaid at the Duke of Kent's wedding to Princess Marina at Westminster Abbey.\n\nIn January 1937 Princess Juliana married His Serene Highness Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, elder son of Prince Bernhard of Lippe and a grandson Prince Ernst, Regent of the German Principality of Lippe from 1897 to 1904. The young couple had met the year before, and during their engagement the Dutch inquired closely into Prince Bernhard's political sympathies, because of the menace of Nazism.\n\nOnce the Prince had convinced Queen Wilhelmina and her government that he was strongly opposed to Hitler, the betrothal received official blessing. Prince Bernhard was naturalised in the Netherlands in 1936, and the marriage took place in the Great Church of St James in The Hague on January 7 1937. A few months after their wedding, for which Prince Bernhard was created a Prince of the Netherlands, the couple came to London to attend the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.\n\nIn Holland, they settled at Soestdijk Palace, at Baarn, in the province of Utrecht. Their first two daughters, the Princesses Beatrix and Irene, were born in 1938 and 1939. But two days after the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940, the Dutch Royal Family were evacuated to England in the British warship Codrington, and within 24 hours, a Government-in-Exile was proclaimed in London by Queen Wilhelmina.\n\nPrincess Juliana and her children initially stayed in London as the guests of Lord Bledisloe, but in June 1940 accepted an invitation from Queen Wilhelmina's first-cousin Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone - whose husband the Earl of Athlone was then Governor-General of Canada - to live in Ottawa, at Rockcliffe Park.\n\nPrincess Juliana and her children crossed the Atlantic in the Dutch cruiser Sumatra, and on arrival in Canada the Princess expressed her thanks in a wireless broadcast. \"Do not give me your pity,\" she said. \"Pity is for the weak and our terrible fate has made us stronger than ever before.\"\n\n\"Juliana,\" Princess Alice recalled, \"was really magnificent. She never once complained or expressed unhappiness, but threw herself into everything that was being done for the war. She was one of the first blood-donors when the campaign started and waited upon patients regularly.\"\n\nFor a time, the Princess was separated from her husband, who had been appointed by Queen Wilhelmina as Chief Liaison Officer between the Dutch and British forces. He eventually joined Princess Juliana in Canada in 1941, and in 1943 their third daughter, Princess Margriet, was born in Ottawa.\n\nLater that year, Princess Juliana became the first member of the House of Orange to visit the colony of Dutch Guiana, and in 1944 she visited The Netherlands Antilles. Towards the end of the war, she was able to join Queen Wilhelmina at Breda, to await the liberation of their country.\n\nWith Germany's final defeat, the Dutch Royal Family returned to a shattered nation, in which nearly all the Jewish population - about 112,000 people - had been exterminated. Princess Juliana became chairman of the Council for the Rehabilitation of the People of the Netherlands, and plunged into work to ease the plight of the hordes of displaced people.\n\nIn 1946 she and her husband made a good-will tour of Norway, Denmark and Sweden, to thank those countries' peoples for their assistance during the war. The following year a fourth daughter, Princess Maria Christina, was born. Princess Juliana had two short spells as Regent, after which, in 1948, Queen Wilhelmina abdicated, having celebrated her Golden Jubilee. The new Queen's inauguration took place in the New Church in Amsterdam on September 6.\n\nThe next year Queen Juliana presided at a ceremony to transfer sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies to the United States of Indonesia, an occasion which marked the beginning of the end of The Netherlands as an imperial power. Dutch Guiana (Surinam) and The Netherlands Antilles, in the West Indies, gained independence in 1954.\n\nCloser to home, Queen Juliana found herself at the centre of a minor domestic crisis: in 1956 it was revealed that for the previous eight years she had been relying on the services of a faith healer named Greet Hofmans - who, it was rumoured, had come to wield an undue influence over the Queen.\n\nMiss Hofmans had been introduced into the Royal family by Prince Bernhard, in the hope that she might cure the near-blindness of the youngest Princess, Maria Christina, who had been born with a congenital cataract. It was then said that she had begun to obtain posts at the palace for her friends, and that she tried to interfere in government affairs. Certainly, her influence was such that she persuaded Queen Juliana to move from her private rooms \"because the earth waves were not right\".\n\nConsequently, two years after her arrival, Miss Hofmans was moved out of the palace. However, she went to live in a caravan in a nearby park and continued to see the Queen and Princess Maria Christina. The Dutch press remained silent on these goings-on until June 14 1956, when newspaper editors commented on the affair for the first time. Amidst wild rumours that the Queen was contemplating abdication, the story made international headlines for two months.\n\nA committee of three elder statesmen was appointed to discuss the matter with Queen Juliana, and subsequently, on their advice, she broke off all relations with the faith-healer. With Prince Bernhard, the Queen signed a statement declaring that they had fully accepted the committee's advice. The royal couple flew to Corfu for a holiday, and Miss Hofmans vanished from their lives.\n\nThere was another upheaval in 1959, after Queen Juliana had invited George Adamski, a self-styled American \"professor\" and former hamburger vendor, to visit her privately to tell her about what he described as his flight around the moon in a space-ship from Venus. After the meeting, however, it was announced that the Queen and Prince Bernhard regarded Adamski's views as \"fantastic\" and that they had not been impressed.\n\nA potentially more serious crisis erupted in 1976, when Prince Bernhard was accused of soliciting money from the Lockheed Corporation of America. An official inquiry failed to find any evidence that Prince Bernhard had either directly or indirectly received some £500,000 in pay-offs, but it did declare that he was open to \"dishonourable requests and offers\".\n\nQueen Juliana, who stood firmly by her husband, was persuaded not to abdicate. Prince Bernhard expressed his regret, saying that he hoped \"to retain the opportunity of serving the country and in this way, as in others, to restore confidence in me\". He resigned all his business and military posts, including that of Inspector-General of the Armed Forces, and stepped down as International President of the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nWhen Queen Juliana did eventually abdicate in 1980, it was a free and considered decision to hand over the throne to her eldest daughter, Crown Princess Beatrix. Thereafter, as Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, the former Queen lived quietly with Prince Bernhard at Soesdijk, and largely retired from public view.\n\nAs Queen, she made State Visits to Britain in 1950 and 1973. She received the Royal Victorian Chain in 1950, and became a Lady of the Garter in 1958. She was Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Sussex Regiment from 1953."
