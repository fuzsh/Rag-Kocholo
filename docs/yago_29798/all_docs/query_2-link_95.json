        "text": "King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden’s Golden Jubilee guest list has been confirmed – and it’s a glittering line-up of European royals. The Swedish monarch will be joined by representatives from the monarchies of Denmark and Norway, and the former royal house of Greece, when he celebrates 50 years on the throne next week.\n\nRead More\n\nWho is Queen Anne-Marie of Greece? The powerful matriarch who is at the centre of Europe’s web of royal family ties\n\nWife of the late Constantine II, Queen Anne-Marie will no doubt have mixed emotions as she turns 77 without him by her side\n\nOn the 14 and 15 September, King Carl XVI Gustaf’s milestone will be commemorated with a number of events, including a Te Deum, a procession through the streets of Stockholm and a gala performance at the 17th-century Drottningholm Palace. There will also be a spectacular banquet at the Royal Palace of Stockholm, where royal watchers will be hoping for a white tie dress code – and a parade of priceless tiaras.\n\nSo, who will be there? King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia will be joined by his first cousins Queen Anne-Marie of Greece and Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. (Their mother Queen Ingrid of Denmark was the sister of Carl Gustaf’s father Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten.) Anne-Marie and Margrethe’s sister, Princess Benedikte, will remain in Denmark and serve as head of state in her sister’s absence.\n\nRead More\n\nQueen Margrethe II of Denmark, the world’s longest-reigning living female monarch, breaks another record\n\nAffectionately known as ‘Aunt Daisy’ in European royal circles, Queen Margrethe is a Cambridge graduate who has worked extensively within the arts\n\nAlso attending are Margrethe’s son and daughter-in-law, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark. The always elegant couple will no doubt put on one of the most sensational showcases of regal fashion.\n\nThe biggest visiting delegation will be from Norway: King Harald V and Queen Sonja will be accompanied by Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit. Harald and Carl Gustaf are also distantly related through the complex web of family ties that connects Europe's monarchies.\n\nThere will also be numerous representatives from King Carl XVI Gustaf’s own family including their three children and their respective spouses: Crown Princess Victoria and husband Prince Daniel (who recently dismissed rumours of marital strife); Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia; and Princess Madeleine and Chris O’Neill, who are said to be planning a return to Sweden. The king’s sisters, nieces and nephews, as well as possibly grandchildren, could also make an appearance over the two days of festivities."
