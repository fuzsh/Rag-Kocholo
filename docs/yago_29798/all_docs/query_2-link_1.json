        "text": "Charles XV (born May 3, 1826, Stockholm—died Sept. 18, 1872, Malmö, Swed.) was the king of Sweden and Norway from 1859 to 1872 (called Karl IV in Norway). Succeeding his father, Oscar I, Charles was an intelligent and artistically inclined ruler much liked in both kingdoms. The royal power, however, was considerably reduced during his reign as the Riksdag (parliament) and executive assumed increasing power. Among important new liberal measures that enjoyed his support was the introduction of a bicameral legislature. A champion of Pan-Scandinavianism and political solidarity among the three northern kingdoms, Charles unwisely gave a half promise of help—which his ministers were unable to back—to Denmark during the Schleswig-Holstein crisis of 1864. He strived to strengthen the bond between Sweden and Norway as well, but his efforts were undermined by the Norwegian parliament.\n\nCharles left one child, Louisa Josephina Eugenia, by his marriage to Louisa, daughter of Prince Frederick of the Netherlands, and was succeeded by his brother, Oscar II."
