        "text": "I'll go first\n\nEngland-France\n\nMary Queen of Scots has a son with her first husband Francis II of France. The boy becomes a Protestant, and therefore acceptable as successor to Elizabeth. He hangs on to his French crown with English aid.\n\nIt would not happen as a result of William III being King and Stadtholder and having a son; Stadtholder was an elective office, and no one in either country wanted the next English monarch to be Stadtholder. In fact the office was left vacant for almost 50 years.\n\nHowever, William's cousin twice removed, William IV, regained the office for the House of Orange and even became hereditary Stadtholder. He married Anne, eldest daughter of George II of Great Britain. If all of her brothers and their children die off, their son William V is heir to both titles.\n\nHere's another possibility:\n\nEngland/Scotland-the Palatinate\n\nIf Elizabeth Stuart has a male-line descendant who hasn't turned Catholic, that man is heir to all three realms when the descendants of Charles I all fizzle out.\n\nwould not happen as a result of William III being King and Stadtholder and having a son; Stadtholder was an elective office, and no one in either country wanted the next English monarch to be Stadtholder. In fact the office was left vacant for almost 50 years.\n\nYes but it was de facto hereditary. His father, grandfather, great-uncle, and Great-Grandfather were all Stadtholders and none had been elected from outside the family.\n\nIf William had a son with Mary, then that son would most likely be elected Stadtholder upon his father's death. And knowing the politically tact William, he would likely find some way to compromise with the States General so they wouldn't feel like they were being lorded over by an English King.\n\nIt would not happen as a result of William III being King and Stadtholder and having a son; Stadtholder was an elective office, and no one in either country wanted the next English monarch to be Stadtholder. In fact the office was left vacant for almost 50 years.\n\nThat is not entirely true. Your point is correct that the stadholder was not hereditary. It was not truely elective though. You are also correct that at least some people in charge in the Netherlands would not want the personal union (that is not truely a personal union) to continue, especialy the regents in Holland and Amsterdam. That said, it is not realy their decission (as I said, it was not an elected office). If it happened when William III was still alive and powerful/influential in the Netherlands I could easily see him setting up his oldest son as the next stadholder and those regents would not be able to do anything about it*. If though William III dies while his son is still an underaged kid, probably something like OTL would happen, a stadholderless period, or Holland would appoint the northern stadholder as stadholder. But I could see some more orange minded provinces, like Gelderland, to accept William's son as stadholder.\n\n*That said, I don't think it would continue indefinetly. After a while the English kings would stop caring about the Netherlands (and probably pretty quickly), at that point the personal union would be broken, at least for Holland and other more independent minded provinces."
