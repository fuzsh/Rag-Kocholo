Creator: Unknown\n\nVisit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Sweden: the ball given by the Dowager of Sweden...at Drottningholm, near Stockholm, 1864. The future King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in Scandinavia. The ball-room is distinguished by the series of valuable portraits to which it owes its title of the \"Salle des Contemporains du Roi I Oscar\"...The Prince of Wales is in the centre, leading the Queen Dowager; the King of Sweden to our right, having on his arm the Princess of Wales; next, Prince Hans of Glucksburg, with the Queen of Sweden; around them, Prince Oscar, with a grand array of notables...The Queen Dowager wore a rich silk dress of deep mauve colour, trimmed with white lace, and a tiara of cameos and diamonds; the Queen, a sea-green dress, also having white lace over, and a wreath in which white roses were upheld by sprays of diamonds. The dress of the Princess of Wales attracted general admiration; it consisted of a rich flame-coloured silk, trimmed with the corresponding shade, and having falls of white lace added. The necklace and head-dress of diamonds worn by her Royal Highness were drawn from the rich store accumulated on the occasion of her marriage'.
