        "text": "Norway will soon have its first royal wedding in 22 years but it appears royalty from across Europe will be avoiding the occasion.\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise will marry fiancé Shaman Durek Verrett on August 31 after announcing their engagement in 2022.\n\nWhile there is growing excitement amongst some royal watchers and locals, the wedding has been compared to that of a \"circus\" by others including a leading historian and royal expert.\n\nREAD MORE: Rift between Sussexes and royal family 'remains as great as ever'\n\nAnd it seems many senior royals from neighbouring countries won't be in attendance.\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise is the daughter of Norway's King Harald V and Queen Sonja and is seen as one of Europe's most divisive royals.\n\nMärtha Louise is fourth in line to the Norwegian throne - her brother, Crown Prince Haakon, will take the throne after their ageing father - but lost her royal highness title in 2002.\n\nIn November 2022, Märtha Louise confirmed she would no longer represent her father or the royal household following anger over the use of her 'princess' title among her commercial endeavours.\n\nShe said the decision was made in consultation with her parents \"to create peace around the royal household\" and allow her to pursue other interests.\n\nSince then, there have been growing calls for Märtha Louise to lose her 'princess' title altogether after breaking the agreement with the King and the royal household multiple times.\n\nREAD MORE: Are Prince William and Kate about to make a surprise visit to Paris?\n\nNorwegian media has accused Märtha Louise and Verrett of using her royal title for commercial gain along with promoting alternative health care methods.\n\nVerrett describes himself as a shaman and a healer on his website.\n\nShe and Verrett will marry on August 31 at the Hotell Union in Geiranger.\n\nAccording to a report from Norwegian news outlet VG, police are yet to receive any requests for assistance for the protection of VIP guests.\n\nThe local police are responsible for the safety of visiting royalty.\n\nNorwegian historian and author Trond Norén Isaksen told VG that was an indication no senior royals would be in attendance.\n\nREAD MORE: 'At 43, is Meghan finally on the path to post-working royal success?'\n\n\"Had there been any important guests, the police would have been notified as soon as they had agreed to come,\" Isaksen told the publication.\n\nOther minor royals are likely to be there, including Princess Alexia of Denmark and Greece.\n\nIsaksen says Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands and her husband Prince Constantijn are expected as is Princess Irene of the Netherlands.\n\nWriting further about the wedding on his Instagram page, Isaksen pointed out that the King and Queen of Sweden have a scheduled engagement on the wedding day.\n\n\"Norway is not exactly gripped by wedding fever,\" Isaksen, who has written seven books on the monarchy, said.\n\nKing Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia were also not at Princess Märtha's first wedding to Ari Behn in 2002.\n\nAccording to an earlier report by VG, the royal households in both Sweden and Denmark – who have for centuries had close ties with Norway – have refused to comment on the wedding.\n\nResponding to a comment from a follower about Princess Märtha acting \"more like a celebrity than a royal\", Isaksen said on Instagram: \"It is indeed my impression that the foreign royal houses are not too keen on being part of this circus, as it has become commonly known\".\n\nIsaksen has been critical of Märtha Louise's continued use of her princess title which he says has damaged the King's reputation.\n\nIn the lead up to the wedding, a specially-made gin produced by Oslo Handcraft Distillery for the nuptials referred to Märtha Louise as \"princess\" both on its website and label.\n\nThe tiaras worn by the women of the Norwegian royal family\n\nThe word \"princess\" was later removed from the website and called a \"mistake\" , with the next batch of bottles not featuring the royal title.\n\nIsaksen said it was the seventh breach of the agreement between the King and his daughter.\n\n\"When the agreement is not respected, it is time to strike Märtha Louise's princess title before King Harald's life's work takes further damage,\" Isaksen wrote on Aftenposten.\n\nHe points to a decline in support for the Norwegian monarchy as being connected to Märtha Louise's actions.\n\nIn 2017, support for the monarchy was at 81 per cent and in 2022 it was sitting at 78 per cent.\n\nIn 2024, support fell to 73 per cent, Isaksen points out.\n\nBefore Princess Märtha Louise stepped back from royal duties, a poll conducted by research firm Norstat for Norwegian Broadcasting found a majority of Norwegians no longer thought she should represent the royal family in official duties.\n\nJust 13 per cent thought she should.\n\nThe main reason given was her engagement to 'spiritual advisor' Verrett.\n\nThe couple's wedding has been reported as being a three-day celebration beginning on August 29.\n\nThere has been speculation some of the guests could include Hollywood royalty, with both Princess Märtha Louise and Verrett having a close relationship with actress Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nVerrett calls Paltrow a good friend and says he showed her Märtha Louise's emerald ring ring before proposing.\n\nAccording to VG, roads will be closed around the hotel and a nearby church on the days around the wedding.\n\nThe airspace above Geiranger will also be shut from August 30 until September 2.\n\nKjetil Sørensen and his son Haakon Theim Sørensen, who have a souvenir shop in the town and 100 metres from the hotel, told the publication the wedding weekend will be \"complete chaos\"."
