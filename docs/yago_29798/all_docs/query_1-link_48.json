Princess Lovisa was the first princess of the Swedish royal family to marry into the Danish royal family since the Middle Ages!\n\nShe herself was the daughter of King Charles XV of Sweden and Queen Louise, who was born a Princess of the Netherlands. Lovisa was a great-grandaughter of King William I of the Netherlands. Her descendants live today; for example, the current reigning monarchs of Denmark, Norway and Belgium, as well as the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\n\nKing William I of the Netherlands > Prince Frederick of the Netherlands > Princess Louise of the Netherlands > Princess Lovisa of Sweden > Christian X of Denmark > Frederick IX of Denmark > Margrethe II of Denmark\n\nPrincess Lovisa of Sweden > King Haakon VII of Norway > King Olav V of Norway > King Harald V of Norway\n\nPrincess Lovisa of Sweden > Princess Ingeborg of Denmark > Princess Martha of Sweden > King Harald V of Norway\n\nPrincess Lovisa of Sweden > Princess Ingeborg of Denmark > Princess Astrid of Sweden > King Albert II of the Belgians > Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant"
