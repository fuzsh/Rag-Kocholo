        "text": "Princess Louise was the daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of England.\n\nIn her mother's eye, Louise's first duty was to marry.\n\nInstead of a foreign prince, Queen Victoria looked to aristocratic circles.\n\nLouise married John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, Marquess of Lorne and future Duke of Argyll.\n\nSuppose Princess Louise does not marry the Marquess of Lorne. Which aristocrat does she marry?\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any evidence that Victoria selected the Marquess of Lorne or that she tried to force an aristocrat on Louise.\n\nLouise chose him.\n\nLouise was not one of Victoria's favourite children, she was artistic and bohemian by Victorian standards, qualities that scared her mother. She was also less tolerant of her mother's melodrama, which meant that Victoria did not like to have her around as much.\n\nCrown Prince Frederick of Denmark was one serious suitor, as were the sons of William III of the Netherlands but Louise showed little interest in a foreign match.\n\nThis was not a case where Victoria was trying to keep Louise close by, as was the motives behind Princess Helena's marriage and her agreement to Princess Beatrice's spouse.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any evidence that Victoria selected the Marquess of Lorne or that she tried to force an aristocrat on Louise.\n\nLouise chose him.\n\nLouise was not one of Victoria's favourite children, she was artistic and bohemian by Victorian standards, qualities that scared her mother.

So why not let them marry? Victoria's other children and cousins were opposed to a member of the family marrying into the peerage, but Victoria saw no harm in it."
