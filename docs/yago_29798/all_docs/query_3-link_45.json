Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nBefore the couple married in 2002, Máxima was photographed wearing simple and casual outfits at the few public engagements she attended. After she became a princess, Máxima turned to formal wear and her wardrobe consisted of ballgowns, tiaras, and fascinators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer regal style was even more apparent after she became Queen of the Netherlands in 2013. More recently, the queen has experimented with more daring ensembles, such as dresses with sheer and illusion necklines, and bold cutouts.\n\nHere's a wider look at the royal's style evolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a 2001 photo call for her engagement to Willem-Alexander, Máxima dressed in a simple red dress and accessorized with a floral brooch and earrings.\n\nGreeting the public later that year, Máxima wore an all-red ensemble, which consisted of a leather jacket, a pencil skirt, and a matching clutch bag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMáxima became a princess upon her wedding to Crown Prince Willem-Alexander in 2002. She paired an ivory gown with a five-meter train by Valentino with the Dutch Pearl Button tiara.\n\nSource: Royal Central\n\nQueen Máxima dressed in a more regal manner after becoming a princess. She wore an off-the-shoulder dress in the Netherlands' national color, orange, and rewore her wedding tiara to a different wedding later that year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat same year, she wore a black coatdress embroidered with florals and styled her hair in a sleek updo for a family christening.\n\nDuring a state visit to Brazil the following year, the princess wore a one-shoulder blouse with flared details and a floor-length, ruffled skirt with beaded red earrings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMáxima and her mother-in-law, Queen Beatrix, coordinated in pink ensembles at a joint engagement in 2008. The princess wore a bright-pink two-piece and matching hat, while the queen wore a tweed dress, blazer, and hat in a lighter shade of pink.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a wedding in Greece in 2010, Máxima changed up her usual formal look with a green-and-pink strapless dress and a gold, sequinned belt.\n\nAfter Beatrix abdicated in 2013, Willem-Alexander and Máxima were declared king and queen. Máxima wore a custom Jan Taminiau gown with a matching cape and a sapphire tiara gifted by Beatrix to the inauguration.\n\nSource: Hello Magazine\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttending a wedding in 2015, Queen Máxima wore a lace mermaid gown with an illusion neckline by Jan Taminiau. She also wore a diamond and ruby tiara, a matching choker necklace, and ruby drop earrings.\n\nSource: The Court Jeweller\n\nMáxima stood out in a one-shoulder lilac dress embroidered with purple flowers and gold detailing in 2017. She completed the look with a purple shawl and wore her hair down in relaxed waves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile visiting the British royals in 2019, Queen Máxima opted for a floor-length gown with a sheer neckline and sheer sleeves. She styled her hair in an updo and wore the Stuart Diamond Tiara.\n\nSource: The Court Jeweller\n\nAt the 2020 state opening of Parliament, the queen wore a Claes Iversen dress with ruffled detailing. She rounded off the look with a gold headband by Maison Fabienne Delvigne, gold gloves, and a royal sash.\n\nSource: Hola\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWearing a bolder look, Máxima wore a Jan Taminiau dress with floral cutouts and paired it with an asymmetrical fascinator at King Charles' coronation in 2022.\n\nSource: Town and Country\n\nMore recently, Máxima wore another daring look at a royal engagement in November 2023, opting for an Iris van Herpen gown with a semi-sheer neckline and a built-in cape.\n\nSource: People\n\nRead next\n\nStyle Royals Fashion\n\nAdvertisement"
