        "text": "Two years after we parted, my husband decided he loved Austin, UT and me more than he loved Harvard, and applied for a professorship in the physics department here. President Peter Flawn interceded and found donors who could match the salary my husband had at Harvard. They created a chair for him with research funding. It was sufficient to create the Theory Group he directed, which rapidly became a primary mover in the world of physics and cosmology. Steven brought physicists into the world of astronomy, astronomers into the world of quantum physics, and put UT at the center of such ferment. Without the support of the community, none of this magic could have happened.\n\nWe went everywhere together. He would accompany me on my travels to the American Law Institute in Philadelphia, or to Washington, D.C. or New York or San Francisco. He was constantly traveling around the world, leading the whole profession of quantum theorists in a massive effort to unify all of the laws of nature. And his effort succeeded. Today all the forces of nature are described by one mathematics, with the single exception of gravity.\n\nI’m now retired, and Steven is gone. When I miss my husband too much, I go to YouTube, type in his name, and one of his distinguished lectures pops up. It is a great comfort to me. It is also a great pleasure to me to have helped establish lectureships of that kind right here at UT, in his name and in mine.\n\nWhile it is prudent that I maintain my financial security in my lifetime, the gift officers at UT have helped me to see I can leave some of my assets in my will to establish honorary lectureships and illustrious chairs. The deans of the physics department and the law school thought it a wonderful idea to have an honorary lectureship and prizes to bestow. Each contributed matching funds, allowing UT to get started on my idea right away. The physics department has offered its first honorary Steven Weinberg Lecturer to the very physicist my husband would have chosen. You can imagine how proud I feel.\n\nThese days UT is more important than ever, with engineering and business schools ranked at the very top in this country, prestigious law and physics departments, and the continued affection and backing of Austin’s wonderful community. Austin draws the country’s best and brightest, with down-home friendliness and the whole community’s support for our great university at the core of that magnetism."
