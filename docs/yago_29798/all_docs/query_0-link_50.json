        "text": "© Unofficial Royalty 2024\n\nMarch 30, 1796 – Death of Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt, Duchess of Zweibrücken, first wife of Maximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria, in Rohrbach, the French Republic now in Germany; buried at the Stadtkirche Darmstadt in Darmstadt, Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, now in Hesse, Germany.\n\nPrincess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt was the first wife of the future Maximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria. 31-year-old Augusta Wilhelmine weakened from five pregnancies and the travails of war, died from pulmonary tuberculosis. Although she died before her husband became King of Bavaria, she was the mother of his successor King Ludwig I of Bavaria\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt, Duchess of Zweibrücken\n\nMarch 30, 1830 – Death of Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden, in Karlsruhe, Grand Duchy of Baden now in Baden-Württemberg, Germany; first buried in the Karlsruhe Stadtkirche, after World War II, his remains were moved to the Grand Ducal Chapel in the Pheasant Garden in Karlsruhe\n\nAs the third son, there was little expectation that Ludwig would succeed to the throne. He pursued a military career, serving in the Prussian army. He succeeded his nephew Karl Ludwig Friedrich as Grand Duke of Baden in 1818. Ludwig promoted the development of the country, as well as strengthening the military forces. He also established several universities and churches. Ludwig never married, but he did have several illegitimate children. He had a long relationship with Katharina Werner and this relationship resulted in three children. When Ludwig died in 1830 after suffering a stroke, he was succeeded by his half-brother, Leopold.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden\n\nMarch 30, 1855 – Death of Charlotte of Prussia, Hereditary Princess of Saxe-Meiningen, first wife of the future Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, in Meiningen, Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen now in Thuringia, Germany, from childbirth complications; buried in the Park Cemetery in Meiningen\n\nCharlotte’s marriage in 1850 to the future Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen was truly a love match, although it was encouraged by Charlotte’s uncle King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia. Charlotte and Georg shared many of the same interests and unlike many marriages of the time, both were very happy to spend as much time together as possible. The couple had four children but sadly, Charlotte, aged 23, died in childbirth along with her fourth child.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Charlotte of Prussia, Hereditary Princess of Saxe-Meiningen\n\nMarch 30, 1871 – Death of Queen Lovisa of Sweden and Norway, born Louise of the Netherlands, wife of King Charles XV of Sweden and Norway, at the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden; buried at Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm, Sweden\n\nIn 1849, Louise met Prince Carl of Sweden, the son and heir of King Oscar I, and negotiations were soon underway to arrange a marriage between the two. While Louise was enamored of her future husband from their first meeting, he found her unattractive. However, King Oscar wanted to create familial ties between the relatively new Bernadotte dynasty in Sweden and some of the other long-established European dynasties. With Louise’s Dutch and Prussian families, as well as the promise of a large dowry, she was an ideal candidate. Prince Carl eventually conceded to his father’s wishes and Louise and Carl were married in 1850. The marriage was an unhappy one. Louise was desperately in love with her husband, but he was consistently unfaithful to her. Having had complications in her second pregnancy, Louise was unable to bear any more children. Following their son’s death in 1854, leaving no male heir to inherit the throne, Louise offered her husband a divorce, which he declined. Lovisa traveled to the Netherlands to be at her mother’s deathbed in late 1870. Upon returning, her husband fell ill and she nursed him back to health. Physically drained, Lovisa contracted pneumonia and died at the age of 42.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Louise of the Netherlands, Queen of Sweden and Norway\n\nMarch 30, 2002 – Death of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, wife of King George VI, mother of Queen Elizabeth II, at Royal Lodge in Windsor, England; buried at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle in Windsor, England\n\nLess than a month after the death of her younger daughter Princess Margaret, The Queen Mother passed away. Her daughter Queen Elizabeth II and two of her grandchildren, the children of Princess Margaret, David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon and his sister Lady Sarah Chatto, were with her. At the time, she was the longest-lived member of the British Royal Family at age 101. For The Queen Mother’s lying-in-state at Westminster Hall, her four grandsons, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of York, the Earl of Wessex, and Viscount Linley (now 2nd Earl of Snowdon) stood guard, repeating what the four sons of King George V did at his lying-in-state in 1936.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Death of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother\n\nUnofficial Royalty: In Memorial – Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother (1900-2002)"
