        "text": "Annemarie & Marc’s Oude Slot, Heemstede Wedding\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nWhen I first met up with Annmarie and Marc to peruse my portfolio and talk over ideas we drank a “little” too much wine. I had just returned from France with cases in tow and as we were getting on so well, it seemed fitting to crack open a bottle or two. Needless to say, they made it home safe on their bicycles and lived to see the wedding!\n\nBeing of Dutch descent, the couple wanted a traditional wedding, surrounded by close friends and family. The Dutch ceremonies are always very personal and weave together a story of how the couple met, the most important people in their lives, followed by an intimate dinner gathering.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, Annemarie, casually surrounded by her closest relatives and friends, primped for the ceremony in the couples apartment. They had decided to do a first look in a pretty park called Elswout in Haarlem. The expression on Marc’s face was of the purest love as he first glanced Annmarie. We took a few portraits during a stroll along gorgeous gardens and woodlands. And as romantic as romantic can be, a horse drawn carriage arrived to take them to the ceremony at Oude Slot Hemstede.\n\nGuests beamed and greeted the couple for their outside traditional Dutch ceremony. Although it was difficult for me to understand (as I have not mastered the language), the love was palpable. Following the ceremony, an intimate drink and dinner reception followed with close friends and family. Speeches commenced and the party began, with the return of all the guests from the day. Despite crazy wet weather in the evening, Annemarie and Marc were so lucky to have gorgeous rays of sunshine for their most important moments of the day."
