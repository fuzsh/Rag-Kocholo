        "text": "Born Luisa Leschinger on 29 September 1928 in Sarajevo, Bosnia (then Yugoslavia), as a young woman she was thrust directly into the turmoil of World War II. She and her family spent the war years being shuffled around to refugee camps in Poland and Austria. She met James L. “Jim” Sherburne in one of those refugee camps in Austria, and the rest is history.\n\nThey married, and after a short stay in Austria they came to the United States. Jim was career Army and she was an Army wife, moving from duty station to duty station – Des Moines, Iowa, Chicago, Illinois, to Heidelberg, Germany and finally here to California. Some of her happiest times were when the Army assigned them to Germany and the family got to travel all around Europe to the Netherlands, Italy, Austria, France, Switzerland and Belgium.\n\nAfter his retirement, her husband became seriously ill. Louise spent years as his primary care giver, with little thought for herself. When he passed on, she was more than a bit at sea. She was suddenly without the man who had been her primary focus in life.\n\nShe’s gone to be with Jim now, but we will all miss her. She is survived by her son, James R. Sherburne,\n\n…Who the noble prize achieveth,\n\nGood friend of a friend to be;\n\nWho a lovely wife attaineth,\n\nJoin us in his jubilee!\n\nExcerpt from Ode to Joy - Friedrich Schiller."
