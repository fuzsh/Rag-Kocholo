Princess Louise of Sweden (future Queen of Denmark), with her sister-in-law, Princess Thyra of Denmark, 1870s

Princess Louise (1851-1926), was Queen of Denmark as the spouse of King Frederick VIII. She was the only surviving child of King Charles XV of Sweden and Louise of the Netherlands.

As she was the only surviving child of her parents, her father King Charles XV made repeated attempts to change the constitution to make her accepted as an heir to the throne of Sweden and Norway. However, when her father's brother had his first son in 1858, followed by several more in the following years, her father was not given any support for his attempts because the matter was considered to be moot since male heirs were now already provided.

Louise married Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark (1843–1912) in Stockholm on 28 July 1869. She was the first Swedish princess to be married into the Danish royal house since Ingeborg Magnusdotter of Sweden in the Middle Ages.

Louise was described as a "strict, but caring parent." As Crown Princess, she founded several charity organisation, among them the home «Bethania» and the «Kronprinsesse L.s Asyl» (Asylum of Crown Princess Louise), and formed a lifelong interest in the Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark.

Louise eventually became Queen of Denmark in 1906. She was widowed in 1912, and was the last widow of a Danish monarch to use the title of Queen Dowager.
