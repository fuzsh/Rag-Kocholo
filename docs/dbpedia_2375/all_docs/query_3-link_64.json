        "text": "Easter Sunrise Service at the Deeds Carillon\n\nSince 1942, the Easter Sunrise Service has been a powerful display of faith, unbroken—a ceaseless tradition in an ever-changing city.\n\n“As dawn broke on Sunday morning, April 5, the first Easter Service was held at the Deeds Carillon. An estimated crowd of 10,000 made the pilgrimage by automobile, bus and on foot” read page 14 of the April 1942 edition of the NCR Factory News.\n\nDayton History invites the entire community to attend this free celebration. Attendees may wish to bring chairs or blankets for seating. This engaging and powerful event continues this annual tradition and was the very first event at Carillon Historical Park.\n\nThe largest carillon in Ohio was built at the request of Edith Walton Deeds. Completed in 1942, the 151-foot tower houses 57 bells. Upon its completion, the first concert was played by Mrs. Deeds during the first Sunrise Service on Easter Sunday of that same year. The Easter Sunrise Service has since continued, unbroken—a ceaseless tradition in an ever-changing city. In fair weather and foul, during triumphant and trying times, people from all walks of life have gathered at Deeds Carillon, in Dayton’s early morning Easter light, for this powerful display of faith."
