        "text": "Background\n\nThe 2003 Committee, comprised of community leaders and activists, played a leadership role in the Celebration of Dayton '96 Program in preparing for the community's bicentennial celebration throughout 1996. The committee is also involved in the Century of Flight Program that is preparing the celebration of the Centennial of Flight in 2003. As godparent to the park, the committee diligently nurtured and guided the effort to make the park a reality. Having generated the grassroots support and the idea for a national park in Dayton, The 2003 Committee helped prepare the enabling legislation and gained the bipartisan support of political leaders that led to establishment of the park.\n\nEstablishment of a National Historical Park\n\nCongress established Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park on October 16, 1992 (PL 102-419). The legislation describes the following four noncontiguous sites in the park:\n\na core unit in Dayton consisting of The Wright Cycle Company building, Hoover Block, and lands between Huffman Prairie Flying Field at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base\n\nThe 1905 Wright Flyer III and Wright Hall in Carillon Historical Park\n\nThe Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial\n\nThe authorizing legislation also directs the Park Service to conduct a feasibility study of selected resources within the Wright-Dunbar neighborhood and The Wright Company factory to determine if they should be included in the park (see appendix A).\n\nPark Partners\n\nMandated Partners\n\nThe legislation charges the Park Service with promoting public-private partnerships in all aspects of park development and management. The National Park Service, Ohio Historical Society, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and Carillon Historical Park each own and administer one of the above park sites. These four entities comprise the park's management partners.\n\nDayton Aviation Heritage Commission\n\nFollowing completion of the 1991 NPS management alternatives study of aviation and the legacy of Paul Laurence Dunbar in Dayton, community leaders and the Ohio congressional delegation drafted legislation to make their dream of a national park system unit in Dayton a reality. Those leaders envisioned a major national park system unit encompassing various sites scattered throughout the greater Miami Valley along with a revitalized West Dayton. Designation of the park and National Park Service involvement hopefully will result in the park becoming a reality.\n\nThe final legislative process, however, took a different approach. Rather than adopting legislation that assigned responsibility entirely to the National Park Service, Congress chose another option. Congress determined that the National Park Service will play an important but limited role in making the \"Dayton Dream\" a reality. To accomplish another critical part of the dream, Congress chose instead to create the Dayton Aviation Heritage Commission. The commission was given the primary responsibility for the preservation and interpretive activities outside the boundaries of a very small national park system unit.\n\nThe park's authorizing legislation provides for establishment of the Dayton Aviation Heritage Commission to \"assist federal, state, and local authorities and the private sector in preserving and managing the historic resources in the Miami Valley, Ohio, associated with the Wright brothers, aviation, or Paul Laurence Dunbar.\" Under this legislative mandate, the appointed commission is charged with producing a preservation and development plan for the Miami Valley.\n\nIn addition to other considerations, contents of the preservation and development plan will include the following: goals for preservation, protection, enhancement, and utilization of the resources; identification of properties that may be preserved, restored, developed, maintained, or acquired; recommendation of methods for establishing partnerships to foster development and preservation of resources; a proposal for transportation links such as pedestrian facilities and bicycle trails between sites; and a discourse on the use of private vehicles, traffic patterns, parking, and public transportation. Further, Congress believed that the state of Ohio should also have a major role in this overall effort, specifically as it relates to the Wright-Dunbar neighborhood. Subsequently, the state of Ohio created the Wright-Dunbar State Heritage Commission and assigned it certain responsibilities, including: the preparation of a management plan for properties \"that should be preserved, restored, developed, maintained, or acquired,\" emphasizing redevelopment and revitalization of the Wright-Dunbar area of West Dayton. The commission's plan will be prepared in cooperation with the city of Dayton, which has proposed a redevelopment plan for the area. (Although the Ohio legislature authorized the creation of this commission, it remains inoperative as of fall 1997.)\n\nThe result has been the establishment of a tripartite arrangement that assigns specific roles to the National Park Service, the federal level Dayton Aviation Heritage Commission, and the state-level Wright- Dunbar State Heritage Commission. All entities will work together cooperatively to make the \"Dayton Dream\" a reality.\n\nThe commission requested assistance from The 2003 Committee to prepare a \"Preliminary Feasibility Study of Transportation Modes for the Dayton Aviation Heritage Nadonal Historical Park.\" This brief study offers suggestions for the park's partners to consider regarding implementation of a visitor transportation system to connect the park's four units. These include private vehicles; horse-drawn carriages; busses, including small transit, double-decker, motor coach, and antique-replica trolley; and a light-rail system.\n\nIn addition, the commission has recently contracted with the National Trust for Historic Preservation for a Main Street assessment of the West Third Street commercial district. That assessment, entitled, Report on the Assessment of the Wright/Dunbar Commercial District Dayton, Ohio, November 6-8, 1996, makes a number of recommendations that include establishing a Main Street program; developing financial incentives as catalysts to private-investment, public educational programs; creating increased neighborhood housing; and establishing a commercial district historic ordinance. The study also includes recommendations regarding heritage tourism initiatives for the area. Following through with the study's recommendations could help the commission fulfill the mandate of title n in the legislation that calls for the \"Dayton Historic Resources Preservation and Development Plan.\"\n\nTherefore, this General Management Plan alludes to the larger picture, especially through the proposed partnership and interpretive programs. For the most part, this plan only speaks to the responsibilities that Congress assigned to the National Park Service in title I of the park's establishing legislation. As a result, it is limited in its scope and in no way speaks to the full realization of the \"Dayton Dream.\" It represents only a third of the effort.\n\nThe other two-thirds will have to be fulfilled by the Dayton Aviation Heritage Commission (the greater Miami Valley) and the Wright-Dunbar State Heritage Commission (revitalization of West Dayton). The federal commission has full authority to act and is beginning to initiate the steps necessary to fulfill its mandate. As noted above, the state commission continues to remain inoperative. Only after those distinctively different bodies begin to undertake the mandates given to them by Congress and the Ohio state legislature, respectively, will the comprehensive \"Dayton Dream\" become a reality.\n\nThrough this General Management Plan, the National Park Service is demonstrating its commitment to fulfill its congressionally mandated responsibilities as outlined in this document. Further, the National Park Service also is committed to provide whatever assistance is necessary to either of the commissions to complete their respective missions.\n\nPartnership Activities\n\nBecause of their initial involvement and continuing interest and strong support, both Aviation Trail Inc., and The 2003 Committee are considered to be full and active partners in the management and operation of this unit of the national park system. A number of city and county agencies, including Montgomery and Greene Counties and the Innerwest Priority Board, play an important role in the heritage of Dunbar and aviation and are actively involved in planning and developing the park and related features.\n\nback to top\n\nHistorical Summary\n\nDayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park commemorates the legacy of three exceptional men — Paul Laurence Dunbar and Wilbur and Orville Wright — and their work in the Miami Valley of Ohio. The park's interpretive focus will cover the period between 1869, when the Wright family moved to Dayton, and 1918, when Orville completed his last flight as a pilot. This period also covers the span of Paul Laurence Dunbar's life (1872-1906). The park will interpret the latter years of Orville Wright as a celebrated public figure in the community until his death in 1948.\n\nWright Brothers\n\nOrville and Wilbur Wright conducted experiments and produced inventions at a fairly young age. In 1889 as young men, they started a printing and newspaper publishing business, building their printing press from odds and ends of junk and scraps. In 1890 the Wrights printed the Dayton Tattler, a newspaper that Paul Laurence Dunbar published for Dayton's African American community. The Wrights also published and edited their own papers.\n\nThe Wrights operated a printing business for 10 years in four locations in West Dayton before selling in 1899. Designing and constructing their own printing presses boosted their mechanical skills. The technical experience the Wrights gained in their bicycle shop was helpful later in developing their airplane.\n\nThe brothers opened their first bicycle shop in 1892. Within four years, they were manufacturing their own line of bicycles using a lathe, drill press, and tube cutting equipment that they purchased. In 1896 they designed and built their first engine to power the machinery to construct bicycles. The Wrights operated their bicycle business from 1892 to 1907, occupying at least five locations in Dayton.\n\nThe Wrights applied the mechanical aptitude they had inherited from their mother to their early printing and bicycle manufacturing businesses and later to their aviation endeavors. From their father they had learned how to think critically, to sharpen their powers of observation, and to keep detailed and accurate records. Their father also taught them to put their faith in family before all others. For this tightly knit clan, the family structure provided safety in a sometimes hostile world. The Wrights needed that support in the turbulent years that followed their first flights.\n\nAs engineers, the Wrights employed a painstaking scientific methodology to solve the problem of powered flight. As master mechanics, the brothers built the machines they flew and Charlie Taylor built the light internal combustion engines that powered them.\n\nThe Wrights thoroughly tested each of their innovations in flight technology and diligently recorded the successes and failures of each stage of development. Careful documentation of procedures helped them to streamline their efforts to achieve free, controlled, and sustained flight in a powerdriven, heavier-than-air machine and proved invaluable in the bitter patent fights that followed their widely publicized flights of 1908.\n\nThrough the invention of powered flight, the Wrights made a significant contribution to human history. These two men, self-trained in the science and art of aviation, designed and built a power-driven, heavier-than-air flying machine. On December 17, 1903, it became the first machine ever to make free, controlled, and sustained flights.\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar, an African-American writer, achieved national and international acclaim in a literary world that was almost exclusively reserved for whites. From 1896 to 1906 this gifted and prolific writer produced a body of work that included 11 books of poetry, four novels, four books of short stories, three plays, the lyrics for 12 songs, one opera, and countless newspaper articles, essays, and orations. Dunbar's use of African-American dialect helped popularize a literary form, championed by contemporary author William Dean Howells, that reflected much of the black experience in America. His vivid use of social and historical settings articulated a keen awareness of the inequities of American society. Dunbar's work contributed to a growing social consciousness and cultural identity for blacks in the United States. He associated with early civil rights figures, including W.E.B. Du Bois, Frederick Douglass, and Booker T. Washington.\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar was bom in 1872 and educated in Dayton's public schools where his intermediate and high school classmates included Orville Wright. He was the only African-American in his high school class. He was president of the literary society and Background editor of the monthly student newspaper. He composed the class song for his 1891 graduating class. His first book of poetry was published in 1892.\n\nDunbar's bitter firsthand experiences equipped him to write passionately of the pervasive racial oppression and intolerance in a nation that claimed dedication to equal rights. Although he was a scholar and had been president of the literary society at Central High School, the only employment open to Dunbar after graduation was first as a janitor, then an elevator operator. Dunbar profitably used his time in these jobs to read voraciously and sell his first published works to passengers on his elevator.\n\nDunbar achieved national and international fame before the Wright brothers. Orville had been his boyhood friend, and the Wrights had printed the Dayton Tattler, the newspaper Dunbar edited while still in high school. Personal misfortune offset Dunbar's literary triumphs, and failing health led him to return to Dayton in 1903, where he wrote feverishly in a race against the death he knew was imminent. Dunbar died on February 9, 1906, at the age of 33. Once a towering figure in American literature during the Age of Realism, he is still revered today. Monuments and institutions across the United States bring honor to his life and legacy by perpetuating his name.\n\nback to top\n\nResources of the Park\n\nThe authorizing legislation directs the National Park Service to acquire two buildings. The Wright Cycle Company building and the Hoover Block. These two structures, in addition to the lands in between, comprise the core unit of the park.\n\nThe Wright Cycle Company building at 22 South Williams Street is where Wilbur and Orville Wright operated their printing and bicycle sales/ repair/manufacturing businesses from 1895 to 1897.The building, a national historic landmark, is the last remaining site in Dayton related to the brothers' cycle business in its original form.\n\nThe NPS-owned structure is the headquarters for the Park Service. The building open to visitors full time from Memorial Day to Labor Day when visitation is at its highest, on weekends, and by appointment for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe Hoover Block, a three-story commercial building erected in 1890, was designed to accommodate three shops on the first floor, office suites and or apartments on the second floor, and a large open meeting space on the third floor.\n\nThe Park Service recently acquired title to the Hoover Block and will restore/ rehabilitate it for visitor services. The building is listed in the 1989 national register nomination as a contributing structure in the West Third Street Historic District, referred to locally as the Wright-Dunbar Historic District.\n\nThe Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial is operated by the Ohio Historical Society. In 1903 Dunbar returned to Dayton to live with his mother in the house at 219 North Summit Street (now Paul Laurence Dunbar Street). On June 3, 1904, Dunbar bought the house for his mother. Dunbar, in rapidly failing health, completed his last work in this house, where he died in February 1906.\n\nAlthough Dunbar lived in the house for only two years, the site is significant as a symbol of how this son of former slaves rose to being proclaimed the \"poet laureate of the Negro race\" by Booker T. Washington. The house, a national historic landmark, contains many original furnishings and artifacts, including a bicycle that was given to Dunbar by the Wright brothers. Visitors today come to see the house to appreciate the times in which Dunbar lived and where he worked.\n\nTwo historic districts encompass the core unit and Dunbar House. The Wright Cycle Company building and the Hoover Block are in the Wright-Dunbar Historic District between Broadway and Shannon Streets, approximately Vi block on either side of Third Street. The Dunbar House is in the Paul Laurence Dunbar Historic District established in 1983, which runs along Paul Laurence Dunbar Street for three blocks, north from West Third Street.\n\nThe 1905 Wright Flyer III and Wright Hall are in Carillon Historical Park and are owned and managed by the Carillon Historical Park, Inc. Carillon Historical Park, a private museum complex, has hundreds of exhibits and displays concerning Dayton and southwestern Ohio history with particular emphasis on transportation.\n\nThe 1905 Wright Flyer III (the Flyer), a national historic landmark, is the world's first truly practical airplane, the first craft capable of fully controlled flight. With the Flyer, the Wrights learned the fundamentals of piloting a powered aircraft. Parts of the 1905 plane were used to build an upgraded model in 1908, designed to meet army specifications. However, the 1908 model was never used and remained in Kitty Hawk. The plane was restored in the 1940s under the supervision of Orville Wright and is displayed in Wright Hall, which was constructed for the sole purpose of providing a home for the early aircraft.\n\nThe Huffman Prairie Flying Field, a national historic landmark, is adjacent to Huffman Prairie, the largest prairie remnant in Ohio. In 1986 all of Huffman Prairie, including a small portion that overlaps the flying field, was designated an Ohio natural landmark. The flying field is managed by Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which continues to work cooperatively with other partners in planning for increasing public visitation.\n\nback to top\n\nMuseum Collections\n\nDayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park\n\nThe park does not plan to acquire or manage significant collections of museum objects, documents, or photographs related to park themes. Significant collections of such materials are within the community or in archival locations. The primary role of the park will be to serve as a single source of information to guide interested parties to appropriate sources.\n\nThe Wright Cycle Company Building\n\nThe Park Service currently owns no museum collections. Exhibits of the Wright brothers era at The Wrights Cycle Company building are owned by Aviation Trail, Inc. The exhibits and materials are managed according to ATI standards and policies.\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial\n\nThe Ohio Historical Society has furnished this house museum with family possessions as well as period pieces. The house contains a number of books. A larger book collection and all manuscripts are in the Society library in Columbus, Ohio, and will continue to be owned by the historical society. These resources are managed according to the historical society's standards and policies. A Dunbar library and research center adjacent to the Dunbar House is underway.\n\nCarillon Historical Park\n\nWright Hall contains the Wright Flyer III as well as museum collections items on display. These include several Wright brothers displays featuring photographic equipment, tools, and machine tools used to construct the first airplane. All materials within Wright Hall will be owned by Carillon Historical Park.\n\nWright-Patterson Air Force Base\n\nThe base does not maintain collections related to the park unit. Archeological objects recovered from the flying field are being processed and will become the first such collection. They will be owned and managed by the base according to their standards. A comprehensive but derivative photographic collection is maintained at the base history office. The U.S. Air Force Museum maintains its aircraft collections independent of base operations.\n\nback to top\n\nInterpretive Plan\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt the very beginning of this plan, it is most appropriate to\n\nnote that this Interpretive Plan is directly guided by the General Management Plan\n\nreemphasize one of the cardinal assumptions that guides the park's General Management Plan —that each of the four legislated component sites of the park will maintain its individual identity and its operational and managerial integrity\n\nnote that this Interpretive Plan was prepared using a \"goal-oriented\" development process\n\nThis plan is a product of the synergy of a cooperative network of working partnerships. During the process of development of the plan, we became acutely aware of the critical bonding factor that developed and, in the future, of the continuance of that partnership network that will be absolutely necessary to provide visitors with a meaningful, cohesive park experience.\n\nExisting Conditions\n\nThis section briefly describes the park resources, the existing visitor use facilities and services, the recent levels of public use, and initial activities of the staff of this embryo park including current study and preservation efforts. Please see the General Management Plan for additional base data and information about the park and its resources.\n\nPrimary Partner Sites: Resources, Facilities, Prograins, and Visitor Use\n\nWright Cycle Company Building and the Hoover Block. The Wright Cycle Company building (a national historic landmark located at 22 South Williams Street), the Hoover Block (at 1060 West Third Street), and the vacant lot between those two buildings (which was the location of several buildings of assorted sizes at the time the Wright brothers occupied the Hoover Block and The Wright Cycle Company buildings) constitute the park's core unit. Initially, Aviation Trail, tie, recognized and preserved The Wright Cycle Company building and the Hoover Block for their outstanding level of significance related to the Wright brothers and the birth of powered flight. The Wright Cycle Company building, originally occupied by Wilbur and Orville Wright from 1895 to 1897, has been open for public use and interpretation (first floor only) since 1988. The Hoover Block, whose second floor housed the Wright and Wright Job Printing business from 1890 to 1895, has not yet been open to public use. On October 20, 1 894, the Wright brothers also began printing their weekly magazine. Snap Shots, in this second-floor printing suite. They also printed Paul Laurence Dunbar' s weekly newspaper, the Dayton Tattler, in this print shop.\n\nFrom 1895 to 1897, the Wright brothers consolidated both of their businesses —job printing and bicycle sales/repair— for the first time into a single location at 22 South Williams Street. In doing so, they moved their bicycle sales and repair from a shop at 1034 West Third Street and their print shop from the second floor of the Hoover Block.\n\nIt was while they occupied this location that the prime focus of their business energies shifted from printing to the bicycle business. While in business at 22 South Williams Street, the Wright brothers printed the last issue of their weekly Snap Shots magazine, began manufacturing their own brand name line of bicycles, and initiated efforts that eventually led to the invention of their airplane.\n\nThe Wright Cycle Company building is currently open to the public on Saturdays and Sundays year-round, daily from Memorial Day to Labor Day, and by appointment at other times of the year. The National Park Service operates the structure as a staffed public use facility, interpreting the refurnished shop and selling theme-related publications and related materials on behalf of Aviation Trail, Inc. [ATI]. The refumishings and exhibits within this historic shop will remain on loan from ATI to the National Park Service until adequate documentation and funds are available to plan and install more accurate refumishings and exhibits. The site has limited public use amenities.\n\nSite bulletins will be prepared and produced for The Wright Cycle Company building and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field, in that order, as funding becomes available.\n\nCurrently, the second floor of the historic Wright Cycle Company building serves as park headquarters, although it is not accessible to all staff and visitors. As the park's administrative space requirements increase, park management expects to seek alternative space in neighboring buildings.\n\nTo properly plan for public use and interpretation of the Hoover Block, the National Park Service has completed a historic structure report for the building. Quinn Evans Architects, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, prepared the report under a professional services contract.\n\nThe vacant land between The Wright Cycle Company building and the Hoover Block is being used by contractors during Aviation Trail, Inc's, \"reconstruction\" of a new building fronted by the surviving streetside facade of the historic Setzer building. This new structure is located next door to the historic Hoover Block along West Third Street. The new structure, formerly known as the Setzer building, is now known as the Aviation Trail building. The shell of the Aviation Trail building contains a landscaped interpretive plaza with three lowprofile wayside exhibits. These waysides, to be produced by the National Park Service's Harpers Ferry Center, will interpret\n\nDayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park and the birth of powered flight in general\n\nthe historic West Dayton neighborhood of the Wright brothers and Paul Laurence Dunbar\n\nthe historic 1895 Wright Cycle Company building\n\nThe National Park Service assumed responsibility for daily operation of The Wright Cycle Company building during the summer of 1994 and took title to that historic structure, the Hoover Block, and the vacant land between in January 1996. Together these properties constitute the core unit of the park, and the only portion of the park directly owned and managed by the National Park Service. When fully developed, this complex will be operated and interpreted as a single, coordinated facility.\n\nIn addition the uniformed National Park Service staff provides offsite interpretive programs/services upon request (as staff permits) for a great variety of groups — such as schools, elderhostels, and civic clubs. The park also sponsors, co-sponsors, and/or coordinates several annual events, which have — in the past — included\n\ncommemoration of the December 17 anniversary of the first powered flight via a Memorial Kite Flying Contest\n\ncelebration of the annual National Historic Preservation Week in May, with another kite flying activity, this time at historic Huffman Prairie Flying Field\n\nactive participation in the week-long activities to observe Paul Laurence Dunbar' s June 27 birth anniversary\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar House. The Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial, a national historic landmark located at 219 North Paul Laurence Dunbar Street in West Dayton, preserves and interprets the last home of the first African-American writer to gain acceptance among national and international literary critics. The Dunbar House has been included in Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park because of his literary accomplishments and his association with the Wright brothers.\n\nThe designation of the Dunbar House as an Ohio state memorial in 1936 was the first significant effort to honor and memorialize an African-American in the United States. Dunbar had achieved national and international fame as a prolific author of poetry, fiction, journals, essays, lyrics, and drama prior to returning to Dayton. During the relatively brief period of 13 years, Dunbar authored a sizable body of literary work. He returned to Dayton in 1903 to live out his final three years with his mother, Matilda, in this two-story residence. Dunbar did his final writing during his residence in this home and died here of tuberculosis in 1906.\n\nThis historic house museum, although authorized as a state memorial in 1936, opened to the public in 1938 with most of the Dunbar family furnishings still in place. Although some of the original furnishings have been replaced over the past 50 years, three key rooms of the house — Paul Laurence's study, his bedroom, and the family living room or front parlor— still contain almost entirely original furnishings.\n\nThe home's furnishings and other permanent exhibits span many stages of the writer's life and accomplishments, from the shy, wideeyed poet of his youth to the prominent national author and spokesman of his adulthood. These exhibits include the bicycle given to Dunbar by the Wright brothers (the gift bicycle was one taken in trade by the Wright brothers).\n\nAlthough a designated Ohio state memorial, the site is operated by the private nonprofit Ohio Historical Society for the state. The memorial consists of five buildings and their surrounding 2 acres of grounds. Four of the five buildings are historic — the Paul Laurence Dunbar House, its historic bam, and two neighboring houses contemporary with the Dunbar House. The fifth structure is the modem visitor center at the rear of the site, which is physically connected to the historic houses.\n\nThe memorial is open to the general public Wednesday through Sunday from Memorial Day to Labor Day, and on weekends only during September and October. During the remainder of the year, the Dunbar House is open by appointment for scheduled tours for organized groups. The memorial is a fee collection area. During that offseason period the memorial staff also presents offsite, outreach programs on an \"as requested\" basis to groups, such as schools, elderhostels, churches, and civic groups.\n\nThe normal visitor experience at the Dunbar House begins in the visitor center, a modem stmcture on the rear of the property. The visitor center is the \"nerve center\" of the site operation and contains interpretive exhibits, including a theme-setting exhibit: Paul Laurence Dunbar: The Man, His Time, and His Legacy and a small sales area featuring theme-related publications and related educational materials. Some parts of the visitor center are available for community use (such as meetings and social gatherings) upon request.\n\nVisitors experience the Dunbar House via either a conducted tour or a self-guiding tour, depending on the volume of visitor use and availability of staff. Tours are focused on the theme-setting exhibit (Paul Laurence Dunbar: The Man, His Times and His Legacy). Some of the tours are conducted by staff dressed in period clothing.\n\nThe memorial is on the threshold of major rehabilitation and restoration of its historic structures and grounds. Funds are appropriated, and a contract award is anticipated soon for\n\nrehabilitation/restoration of the two neighboring houses\n\nreplica replacement of all the shutters on the Dunbar House\n\nconstruction of a ramp for access to the Dunbar House grounds\n\nrehabilitation/restoration of the Dunbar House's barn\n\nUpon completion of this rehabilitation/ restoration work, the three historic structures will be adaptively used for both public and staff use. The first floors of the two neighboring houses will contain a new public use space — a Paul Laurence Dunbar Library — and office and breakroom space for the memorial's cadre of volunteers. The second floors of these two houses will be nonpublic space for memorial offices and staff use areas. The ground level of the historic Dunbar House's bam will contain a multipurpose space to be used to enhance the site's children's interpretation activities, such as storytelling and related activities. The upstairs of the historic bam will be used for staff work space and related nonpublic uses.\n\nThe Wright Flyer III and Wright Hall at Carillon Historical Park. The 1905 Wright Flyer III and Wright Hall are among the principal features of the nonprofit historical park, which is owned and operated by Carillon Historical Park, Inc. The 1905 Wright Flyer III, the world's first practical airplane and the aircraft in which man actually learned to fly, is a national historic landmark (originally designated on June 21, 1990).\n\nCol. Edward A. Deeds, the founder of the nonprofit history museum called Carillon Historical Park, built Wright Hall and opened the 1905 Wright Flyer III exhibit to the public in 1950 as a memorial to Wilbur and Orville Wright.\n\nThe project grew out of Colonel Deeds' efforts to get permission from his close friend, Orville Wright, to build and display a replica of the Wright brothers' 1903 \"Kitty Hawk\" Flyer. Orville suggested instead that they feature the 1905 Wright Flyer III because it was the world's first airplane to be flown under full control and with full maneuverability. Further, Orville was instmmental in planning and developing the exhibit; he assisted in several important facets of the project, including\n\nlocating and retrieving the pieces of the plane from storage\n\ndirecting the reassembling and restoration of the plane\n\nguiding the design of the recessed exhibit area to display the 1905 Wright Flyer EQ in a way that will allow visitors to view the aircraft from above and to better understand the dynamics of controllable flight\n\nCurrently, Wright Hall maintains the same season of operation as the remainder of Carillon Historical Park. The park is open daily from May 1 to October 3 1 , except Mondays (unless Monday is a holiday). Like the Paul Dunbar House, Carillon Historical Park is a fee collection area.\n\nIn 1993 acting out of concem for improved security and environmental controls for the 1905 Wright Flyer III and improved accessibility and interpretation in Wright Hall, the staff and officers of Carillon Historical Park consulted with the National Park Service. They explored needs and options with park, regional office, and Harpers Ferry Center Staff to sensitively expand Wright Hall to improve resource protection and security, and to provide for the expansion of interpretation and visitor services. As a result of these cooperative planning efforts, the current building expansion project includes a wing and two corridors connecting Wright Hall with its next door neighbor — a replica of the last Wright brothers cycle shop.\n\nThe interpretive emphasis for the 1905 Wright Flyer III and Wright Hall is the development of a practical, fully controllable airplane and the comparative differences between the 1903 \"Kitty Hawk\" Flyer— flown at Kitty Hawk, NC — and the 1905 Wright Flyer III — flown at the Huffman Prairie Flying Field. To help interpret these important aspects of pioneer aviation development, the park presents the interpretive video entitled \"The Wright Flyer III\" in the replica Deeds' Bam, which, among other things, includes a demonstration of the \"wing warping\" flight control technique by Wilkinson (\"Wick\") Wright, a grandnephew of Wilbur and Orville Wright.\n\nThe interpretive emphasis at the replica of the last Wright Cycle Company building (original was used 1897 to 1916 by the Wright brothers located at 1127 West Third Street in West Dayton) is the three careers of Wilbur and Orville Wright — printing; bicycle repair, sales, and manufacture; and airplane invention and development. Additionally, they interpret the history of bicycle manufacturing in the Miami Valley from the approximate beginning of the Wright brothers' bicycle manufacturing business. To aid in interpreting these stories, the shop features numerous printing, bicycle, and airplane artifacts associated with the Wright brothers and their creative endeavors.\n\nCarillon Historical Park relies on a fairly balanced combination of paid staff and volunteers to provide onsite interpretation and visitor use services.\n\nAt present, restroom facilities and water fountains are located in a different area of Carillon Historical Park. Picnic tables are available in a grassy area near the entrance of the overall facility.\n\nThe first phase of the Wright Hall wing was completed in summer of 1997. Although new interpretive media for Wright Hall will not immediately follow the completion of the addition, the park's existing interactive educational program about Wilbur and Orville Wright will be moved from the Activity Bam Center to the expanded Wright Hall. This expansion of Wright Hall, along with the constmction of a new restroom building on the east side of the replica cycle shop, will provide adequate interpretation and visitor use facilities to allow park management the opportunity to extend the visitor season for the Wright brothers' complex. Phase two will get underway in 1998.\n\nIn addition to Carillon Historical Park's onsite interpretive/visitor use services, the park provides a limited outreach program throughout the year. Educational programs, presented solely by a cadre of trained volunteers, and speaking engagements, usually handled by permanent staff, are scheduled and presented on an \"as requested basis.\" One of the most popularly requested educational programs is a \"quiz format\" program about Wilbur and Orville Wright and their family environment, entitled \"Were There Two Wright Brothers?\"\n\nCarillon Historical Park also hosts a group of professional and avocational scholars with particular interest in the many facets of the lives, activities, and accomplishments of Wilbur and Orville Wright. This group, known as the Wright Research Committee, meets at the park on a regular basis. It currently is compiling a reference work or \"source book\" which they have titled Wilbur and Orville Wright Handbook of Facts.\n\nThey are seeking a grant to publish the work and make it available to scholars and researchers.\n\nHuffman Prairie Flying Field and the Wright Memorial. Both the Huffman Prairie Flying Field and the Wright Brothers Memorial are sites located within Wright- Patterson Air Force Base and are therefore under the jurisdiction of the United States Air Force.\n\nThe Huffman Prairie Flying Field, a national historic landmark (dedicated in October 1990), was designated as one of the four legislated units of the park because it was the \"airfield\" at which the Wright brothers perfected practical, maneuverable flight while flying and testing both the Wright Flyer II and the Wright Flyer III from 1904 through 1915. In 1910, they established the Wright Company School of Aviation at the Huffman Prairie Flying Field, initiating the world's first permanent flying school and training many future civilian pilots and military aviators — including General Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold.\n\nThe physical appearance and ambiance of the landscape of the flying field remains much the same as it looked during its years of active use by Wilbur and Orville Wright — 1904-1916. The treelines on two of the sides of the field vividly delineate those boundaries while flags mark each of the seven comers of this irregularly shaped open field.\n\nThe site is accessible by automobile using local air base roads — Hebble Creek Road to Pylon Road, or to Marl Road as an alternative. Plans are \"in the mill\" for the development of a dedicated bicycle path along the Marl Road alignment as supplemental access to the site.\n\nAs part of the cultural landscape, the flying field contains three visually prominent structures — a replica of Wright brothers' 1905 hangar and a representation of their catapult launch tower and rail and the commemorative pylon painted white, initially for maximum visibility from the overlook on Wright Memorial Hill. The memorial pylon was erected in 1941 at the approximate location of the beginning of the Wright brothers' first flight at Huffman Prairie in 1904. The replica 1905 hangar was built in October of 1990 by the U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (in time for the December 19,1990, dedication of the Huffman Prairie Flying Field National Historic Landmark). The replica catapult tower and rail was built during 1993-1994 as an Eagle Scout Service Project.\n\nField archeological reconnaissance and excavations have helped define the size and location of the Wright brothers' 1910 hangar.\n\nThe discovery trail, with its self-guiding trail booklet established in 1991 as an Eagle Scout project, provides visitors with onsite interpretation of this key aviation heritage site. The site, which has been publicly accessible since May 1991 (from 1986 to 1991 the prairie was open for special tours by advanced arrangement only), is open daily during daylight hours at those times when the base is open to the public. Unfortunately, the logistics of qualifying for the visit are sometimes frustrating and often time-consuming for many park visitors. However, in recent years, the historic Huffman Prairie Flying Field and its adjacent Huffman Prairie natural prairie habitat have been closed to the public for a week in May during a National Security Police Week shooting meet on the adjacent small arms firing range. Aside from the selfguiding interpretive trail, the site has no visitor amenities.\n\nThe 109-acre Huffman Prairie natural habitat is Ohio's largest surviving prairie remnant, and was designated as an Ohio Natural Landmark in 1986 by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. To allow visitors some access to the typical vegetation of this natural prairie while still minimizing adverse impacts on this important surviving prairie remnant, a small, crescent-shaped prairie garden has been established on the Huffman Prairie Flying Field between the replica 1905 hangar and Pylon Road.\n\nThe Wright Brothers Memorial, located on a hill overlooking the Huffman Prairie Flying Field, was dedicated on August 19, 1940 — on Orville Wright's 69th birthday with Orville present for the dedication. Although this site is not one of the park's designated units, the park's enabling legislation authorize the National Park Service to interpret the Huffman Prairie Flying Field and related topics at the memorial. The Olmsted brothers, the sons of Frederick Law Olmsted, designed the formal landscape of the memorial grounds, while the design of the central monument, with its commemorative inscriptions. Onsite information/interpretation consists of\n\nbronze plaques designed as an integral part of the low stone walls surrounding the perimeter of the formal memorial\n\na high profile exhibit shelter with photographs and text, located at an overlook of the Huffman Prairie Flying Field, interpreting: the memorial, its construction, its 1940 dedication, and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field\n\nThe site contains only limited visitor amenities — a few picnic tables and rest benches.\n\nBased on the presence of prehistoric Indian mounds discovered during ground preparation for the memorial, the Wright Brothers Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\nTo provide documented information for wise management of the Wright Brothers Memorial Hill, the Denver Service Center of the National Park Service is in the process of completing a cultural landscape report for this formally designed landscape. The report will be completed in late 1997.\n\nParkwide Visitor Use. To promote and facilitate parkwide visitor use of the four primary' park units of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, the park staff has developed both a \"rack\" or \"image\" card and an interim park folder.\n\nThe \"rack\" card is being distributed to local visitor and convention bureaus, chambers of commerce, the Dayton International Airport visitor information counter, and similar entities as a parkwide promotional tool.\n\nThe interim park folder — originally prepared in cooperation with Denver Service Center staff— provides visitors with a succinct unified source of information and interpretation about Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park and its four primary units. Each of the cooperating partners have brochures that continue to provide visitors with additional site-visit information.\n\nThe recommended travel route to all four key units of the park is from The Wright Cycle Company building to the Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial, then on to Wright Hall and Carillon Park, and finally on over to the Huffman Prairie Flying Field and the Wright Memorial Hill (please see the map in the \"Recommendations\" section for a general graphic delineation of this auto tour route for primary park units). The final segment of the tour generally routes visitors along the historic route that the Wright brothers travelled along the Dayton, Springfield & Urbanna Interurban Railroad between their West Dayton home and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field. Visiting all four units of the park will require driving about 20 miles and spending a minimum of about four hours to do so.\n\nVisitor use data for the entire park is very limited, because of its newly authorized status. Total visitor use for the park for 1995 — the only year for which a full calendar year's data is available — was 40,288. Of that total, 85% of the visitation was recorded at Wright Hall in Carillon Historical Park. Visitation by site for 1995 is as follows:\n\nWright Hall/ Carillon Historical Park 34,370\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar House 2,364\n\nThe Wright Cycle Company Building 1,990\n\nHuffman Prairie Flying Field 1,564\n\nTotal- 1995 40,288\n\nThe public use of the other three units may increase substantially as the park develops and becomes more well-known.\n\nSupportive Heritage Sites and Museums\n\nIn addition to the park's four primary units or sites, a considerable number of secondary heritage sites exist in the Dayton-Miami Valley area, which help enhance the Dayton Aviation Heritage story. Those associated with the origin and development of aviation are listed and described in A Field Guide to Flight on the Aviation Trail in Dayton, Ohio, written by Mary Ann Johnson and published by Landfall Press.\n\nSeveral of the key secondary heritage sites are identified and briefly described in this section.\n\nWoodland Cemetery. The burial sites of Wilbur (1867-1912) and Orville (1871- 1948) Wright and Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906) are located within eyesight of each other near the crest of one of the many hills within Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum. Woodland Cemetery is located adjacent to the University of Dayton, just south of downtown Dayton.\n\nThe Wright brothers are buried in the Wright Family plot next to their parents. Bishop Milton Wright and Susan Koemer Wright, and their sister, Katharine Wright Haskell. Paul Laurence Dunbar's grave along with the grave of his mother, Matilda, is located a short distance to the northeast of the Wright family plot, just off one of the Woodland's interior access roads. Dunbar's grave is marked by a natural boulder under a weeping willow tree, and bears a plaque with the first verse of Dunbar's poem, A Death Song, which includes reference to a weeping willow tree.\n\nThe cemetery is also the final resting place for Lorin Wright and his wife (brother of Wilbur and Orville Wright), Catharine Van Cleve Thompson (Wilbur and Orville's great great-grandmother who was one of Dayton's original settlers), and several other Dayton aviation heritage notables such as Charles F. Kettering, Edward A. Deeds, George W. Hartzel, and Lt. Frank S. Patterson.\n\nThe Wright Company. The Wright Company, located just off West Third Street at 2701 Home Avenue, was the world's first permanent aircraft factory.\n\nDuring the seven years it operated (1910 - 1917), The Wright Company produced 13 different models of airplanes in this factory. These 13 models included military scout airplanes, civilian aircraft, seaplanes, models with fuselages as well as the earlier \"open wind\" models, and aircraft with frontmounted tractor propellers as well as the earlier \"pusher\" type propellers. All new models of aircraft produced here were flight-tested either at the Huffman Prairie Flying Field or the Seaplane Base on a large bend of the Great Miami River.\n\nThe buildings occupied by the Wright Company factory are now incorporated as part of a larger General Motors production facility still in operation. The exteriors of the Wright Company Factory are quite distinct, however, because of years of internal remodeling changes, the factory interior is rather indistinguishable.\n\nThe aircraft factory has been studied twice by the National Park Service. It was first studied for possible designation as a national historic landmark, and later its significance and feasibility were considered for inclusion within the park. Neither study resulted in such designations, yet the site remains a significant and contributing element to the interpretation of the development of aviation.\n\nOther Wright Brothers and Closely Related Sites in the West Dayton Neighborhood\n\nSeveral sites and structures in the immediate West Dayton neighborhood, in the vicinity of the Hoover Block and the Wright Cycle Shop, possess interpretive potential to help tell the story of the Wright brothers neighborhood environment. The site locations of the nonsurviving structures [except where otherwise noted] include\n\nthe Wright family home at 7 Hawthorne Street — empty lot at the site, the original was moved to Greenfield Village at Dearborn, Michigan, by the Edison Institute in 1936 for public exhibit\n\nthe first Wright brothers' print shop (outside the printing operation within the Wright family home at 1210 West Third Street)\n\nfour Wright brothers' bicycle shops [located at 1005 West Third Street, 1015 West Third Street, 1034 West Third Street, and the last at 1127 West Third Street] [Please note: the third bicycle shop is the surviving structure at 22 South Williams Street; the fourth and last shop, within which the Wright brothers invented the first Wright Flyer airplane, was physically moved, along with the Wright Family home from 7 Hawthorne Street, to the Detroit area for exhibition at the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in 1936; additionally, a replica of the last shop is exhibited at Carillon Historical Park, adjacent to Wright Hall and its Wright Flyer HI; it's also appropriate to note that Wilbur and Or\\'ille operated a bicycle sales shop at 23 West Second Street in downtown Dayton for about a year (1895-96)]\n\nThe Wright Laboratory at 15 North Broadway and used by Orville for over three decades from 1916 to 1948\n\nthe home of one of Wilbur and Orville's older brothers — Lorin Wright; a surviving, occupied residence located about three blocks east of the Wright family home at 117 South Horace Street\n\nthe Ed Sines' home (Orville's closest boyhood friend and printing shop partner), a surviving, occupied residence just down the block from the Wright family home on Hawthorne Street\n\nWright Seaplane Base Site. From 1911 to 1913, the Wright Company used a section of the Great Miami River near the Sellars Road Bridge in the Dayton suburb of Moraine to flight test their seaplane models. They chose the slack water of a large sweeping bend in the river that afforded them calm water for takeoff and landing under a variety of prevailing wind conditions.\n\nHawthorn Hill. After achieving international recognition and financial success, Wilbur and Orville Wright designed a spacious new home to be built in the City of Oakwood. Unfortunately, Wilbur died prior to its construction. Following Wilbur's death, Orville with his father — Bishop Milton Wright and his sister Katharine Wright — occupied the new mansion. Although neither open to the public nor easily accessible as a visitor experience, the mansion (which has been designated a national historic landmark) represents the expression of successful achievements by the Wright brothers and will be interpreted as part'of their story.\n\nU.S. Air Force Museum. The U. S. Air Force Museum contains several artifacts directly related to the Wright brothers and many artifacts/exhibits relating to Dayton's aviation heritage. Located within Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (at Gate 28-B) just off Springfield Pike, this museum is the world's oldest and largest military aviation museum, the Dayton metro area's most heavily visited attraction, and the number one noncommercial visitor attraction in the state of Ohio.\n\nOther Theme Related Museums. Several other area museums with Wright brothers aviation heritage or Paul Laurence Dunbar-related themes and exhibits are worth visitors' time. These museums are\n\nKettering-Moraine Museum — has Wright family exhibits, including original furniture from Orville's Hawthorn Hill mansion\n\nMontgomery County Historical Society — holds significant collections of Wright brothers, Wright family, and Dayton aviation heritage materials which are usually exhibited on a rotating basis\n\nDavid Gold Parachute Museum — the David Gold parachute artifacts collection will be exhibited in the Aviation Trail building\n\nNational Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center branch to be located in the former Zion Baptist Church in West Dayton — when developed, this will be a satellite exhibit facility to the parent cultural center located at Central State University in nearby Wilburforce and will directly relate to the Dunbar heritage story\n\nWright State University Collections. The Paul Laurence Dunbar Library, which houses Wright State University's Archives and Special Collections, is a major resource for aviation scholars and researchers. This collection contains a number of Wright brothers' memorabilia on public exhibit, in addition to the Wright brothers' collection of documents and other manuscript materials. These artifact materials on display include national and international trophies and gold medals presented to Wilbur and Orville Wright. The entire Dunbar Library, including its archives and special collections, is open to the general public.\n\nWright \"B\" Flyer. A group of Dayton pioneer aviation enthusiasts has built and flies a look-alike representation of the world's first mass-produced airplane — the Wright \"B\" Flyer. It is available for public viewing several days a week at its home hangar at the Dayton Wright Brothers Airport south of Dayton.\n\nback to top\n\nperhaps a visitor-accessible Internet terminal networked with other Wright brothers/Dayton aviation/Dunbar sites and \"home pages\" designed for optimum use by the greatest number of visitors at any given time; suggested locations for inclusion in the network might include: Wright Brothers National Memorial at Kitty Hawk; Greenfield Village, at Dearborn, MI; Dayton Annual Air Show at Dayton International Airport; the Wright family and Dunbar grave sites at Woodland Cemetery\n\nIn addition to the above considerations, exhibits and facilities unique to the west interpretive center will be those treating the following:\n\norienting visitors to and introducing the Hoover Block and The Wright Cycle Company building as primary historic sites where the Wright brothers produced products — printing and bicycles, conducting business, and exercising creativity leading to the invention of the first practical, maneuverable airplane\n\ninterpreting the friendship and business associations between the Wright brothers and Paul Laurence Dunbar, as much as the limited historic documentation will allow, perhaps through the use of historic photographs and original or high quality replica publications printed by Wilbur and Orville Wright for Dunbar; part of this exhibit will feature a further invitation to visit the Dunbar House, right here in the West Dayton neighborhood\n\ninterpreting the family environments, nurturing and support, as well as the personal persistence and discipline that enabled Wilbur and Orville Wright and Paul Laurence Dunbar to succeed where less persistent, less visionary had failed\n\na short audiovisual piece may work best to interpret this subject in this location: interpreting Orville Wright's Hawthorn Hill Mansion in the neighboring city of Oakwood, in lieu of its inaccessibility to the public\n\nintroducing, interpreting, and inviting visitors to visit other selected Wright brothers/Wright family and Dunbar sites in the West Dayton neighborhood and the nearby area; presentation of these sites will provide the best opportunity to interpret the significant role of the Wright family and of the Dunbar family in providing the support for Wilbur and Orville' s scientific and technical triumphs, and Dunbar's literary contributions and triumphs; these Wright brothers/Dunbar heritage/ neighborhood sites will include\n\nthe Wright Company aircraft factory\n\nthe Wright family and Dunbar grave sites in Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum\n\nthe sites of key nonsurviving and relocated structures — the Wright family home at 7 Hawthorne Street (now at Greenfield Village, Michigan), the last cycle shop at 1127 West Third Street (now at Greenfield Village, Michigan), other Wright Cycle Company locations, and Orville Wright's laboratory at 15 North Broadway\n\nthe historic West Dayton neighborhood cultural landscape\n\nproviding adequately controlled environment for the park's small, but growing artifact collection and a small, selective park reference library that still needs to be developed; providing some or all of the park headquarters offices and support space — staff restroom, storage, and similar functional needs\n\nExhibits and facilities unique to the east interpretive center treating the following:\n\norientation/introduction of visitors to the Huffman Prairie Flying Field as a primary historic site where the Wright brothers perfected practical flight, tested new aircraft, and conducted their Wright Company flying school\n\nthe heritage of Ohio's largest surviving natural prairie will also be introduced\n\norientation/introduction of visitors to the Wright Memorial as a key historic site where the Wright brothers are fittingly honored for their pioneer accomplishments as inventors of practical powered flight; the memorial dedication, attended by Orville Wright, may also be interpreted\n\ninterpretation of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as a very visible symbol of the legacy of Dayton's rich aviation heritage; and within such a context interpret the Wright brothers and their salient influence on military aviation\n\nprovision for a small space or gallery for rotating exhibits concerning special emphases, events, and activities\n\nParkwide Orientation Panels\n\nTo complement the two interpretive centers, comprehensive parkwide orientation panels will be located at Wright Hall in Carillon Historical Park, at the Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial, and outside each of the two interpretive centers. The panels will incorporate information included on the large orientation graphics in the east and west interpretive centers.\n\nThese panels will also alert visitors to those sites where entrance fees are charged. These panels may have either interior or exterior locations, depending on what serves both the visitor and the site best. However, exterior orientation panels at the two interpretive centers will provide \"after hours\" visitors with essential park information. Cultural landscape features and site design elements will be primary determining factors concerning exterior locations of these panels. If exterior locations are indicated, they will be included in the parkwide wayside exhibit plan. As indicated elsewhere in this plan, the parkwide wayside plan needs to address such factors as design elements that promote continuity throughout the heritage park and coordination with the color palette developed for national park signs by National Park Committee of The 2003 Committee and the City of Dayton Planning Department.\n\nSimilar orientation panels will be appropriate at the Dayton International Airport Terminal, at the various Dayton/Montgomery County Visitors Bureau offices, highway \"welcome\"/tourism centers, and near the U.S. Air Force Museum at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base. Smaller information/ orientation panels may also be appropriate at several of the first-level supportive heritage sites.\n\nExperiencing the Primary park Resources\n\nGeneral Planning Considerations\n\nTo provide optimum opportunities to understand and appreciate the integral interrelationships of each of the component Dayton aviation heritage sites, park visitors will be encouraged to visit all four of the legislatively designated units of the park, which are\n\nHoover Block (plus Aviation Trail building) and Wright Cycle Company building in West Dayton\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial in West Dayton\n\n1905 Wright Flyer III / Wright Hall at Carillon Historical Park\n\nHuffman Prairie Flying Field (and the Wright Memorial) within Wright-Patterson Air Force Base\n\nEach of these sites offers the public either the place where an important segment of the Dayton Aviation Heritage story occurred or where significant artifacts are exhibited to the public.\n\nThe interpretive stories at each of these four sites will complement and reenforce the interpretive media and services at the other three. No attempt will be made to interpret the entire park story at each area. Interpretation of this internationally significant story has been planned using the concept that \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\" An active network of interpretive and educational staff personnel of the partners is vital to effectively use the park's resources and facilities.\n\nTwo or three important \"take along\" tools providing a balanced mix of information, orientation, and interpretation will help park visitors experience all four primary park sites in a comprehensive, visitor-friendly manner. The main visitor travel route among these four main partner sites will remain much the same as is now in use.\n\nThe primary \"take along\" tool will be the official National Park Service unigrid folder, which will interpret both the overall nature and importance of the park and the description and importance of each of the four primary park units.\n\nThe secondary \"take along\" tools will include a variety of audio and video formats. These audiovisual tools will be designed and produced to provide enhanced interpretation for each of the various possible modes of travel throughout the park, as well as to supportive heritage sites. These modes of travel might include, but not be limited to: private vehicles; commercial tour coaches [buses] equipped with on-board video monitors; and some form of public transportation linkage among the four park units — such as the rubber-tired Wright Flyer trolley. Considering the park's limited staffing, the use of nonpersonal interpretive media aboard tour buses and public transportation systems will be much more cost effective than personal services interpretive staffing. All such interpretive media will be developed to complement the text and map in the park's unigrid folder. Please see the \"Publications and Related Portable Media Plan\" section for additional description and discussion for these audiovisual proposals.\n\nAt present two of the sites have admission fees — the Dunbar House and Carillon Historical Park. In order to promote a park experience that is as visitor-friendly and seamless as is possible, some form of cooperative admission fees structure will be explored. Likewise, the cooperative scheduling of organized group visits to partner sites will be investigated.\n\nHoover Block and The Wright Cycle Company Building\n\nThe Hoover Block, The Wright Cycle Company building, and the vacant lot between those two buildings together constitute the only unit of the park owned and managed by the National Park Service. This \"core unit\" of the park will be operated and interpreted as a single facility. The vacant land between these two important surviving historic structures may be used to focus on the interpretation of the historic urban landscape of the Wright brothers' West Dayton neighborhood. A cultural landscape report for this area will guide the best use and interpretation of this parcel. The report may be expanded to the larger West Third Street (Wright-Dunbar) and Dunbar Historic Districts, to assure that National Park Service restoration efforts toward establishing appropriate streetscapes within the core unit will not be in stark contrast to the appearance of the remaining portions of the historic districts.\n\nThe Hoover Block. Wilbur and Orville Wright occupied the comer suite on the second floor of the Hoover Block for their printing business for almost five years (fall of 1890 to the spring of 1895). During that period, they honed their business skills through their job printing business, published and distributed their weekly magazine, Snap Shots, and printed Paul Laurence Dunbar's weekly newspaper, the Dayton Tattler, for his distribution to Dayton's African-American community. Thus in addition to permanently housing the west interpretive center, the building offers prime interpretive opportunities.\n\nAlthough the visitor entrance to the adjacent Aviation Trail building opens to Sanford Court (a short, narrow street behind the Hoover Block), the historical entrance to the building from West Third Street will become the visitor entrance. To make use of the Third Street entrance practical and inviting, a visitor parking lot somewhere along or just off West Third Street is needed, and pedestrian-friendly facilities will be developed to encourage foot traffic along West Third Street.\n\nAviation Trail, Inc., is constructing the interior floor levels of their new building in such a way as to provide full access to all floors between their building and the adjacent historic Hoover Block.\n\nThe ground floor will house the permanent visitor orientation facility, and at least a portion of the second floor will be used to interpret the Wright brothers and their job printing occupation. The remainder of the Hoover Block interior will be used for National Park Service headquarters offices and support facilities.\n\nThe interpretation of the Wright brothers' printing story on the second floor will focus on two aspects:\n\nthe role that Wilbur and Orville' s printing business played in honing their business basics and skills and developing their unusually efficient work style of synergistic cooperation\n\nthe friendship and business associations between Paul Laurence Dunbar and the Wright brothers, which in turn offers additional opportunities to legitimately strengthen the direct relationship between these two important heritage stories and encourage park patrons to visit the Dunbar House and experience its important message; the Dunbar House State Memorial staff will be involved during the planning and development of this aspect of the Wright brothers print shop interpretation on a consultation and review basis.\n\nIf sufficient historical data and architectural evidence can be found to define the size, shape, and appearance of the Wright brothers' job printing suite, it will be appropriate to refurnish part or perhaps all of their print shop in this location. A combination of the historic furnishings and perhaps selected audio messages will dramatically interpret the Wright brothers-Dunbar connection.\n\nThe existing third floor ballroom may lend itself to audiovisual presentations as well as to multipurpose uses.\n\nThe Wright Cycle Company Building. If enough documentary evidence exists, the ground floor will be accurately refurnished to the period when Wilbur and Orville Wright were beginning to manufacture bicycles but were still doing some job printing. The interpretive story at this location will be a combination of:\n\nthe significant role of the bicycle business — sales, repair, and manufacturing — in the life and careers of the Wright brothers, particularly including the stability of the business that provided them with both the time and the money to pursue their aeronautics experiments\n\na shifting emphasis of careers from printing and the bicycle business to aviation; the synergy of effort between them that created a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts\n\npractical illustration of their persistence, effort, and discipline in applying the scientific method to identify and solve the technical problems of free, controlled, sustained flight and those needed to successfully pursue their manufacturing ventures\n\nTo avoid negatively impacting the integrity of the refurnished scene, audio messages set against the background of ambient print shop and machine shop sounds will most appropriately interpret these important messages.\n\nFor the interim, the existing exhibits are on loan from Aviation Trail, Inc., and are displayed in the way they were originally planned and installed by Aviation Trail, Inc., with a minimum of changes.\n\nIf enough documentary evidence of the nature and arrangement of the Wright brothers' second floor printing shop exists, historic refumishings of that floor as a print shop will be seriously considered. If that floor is refurnished, some type of interpretive programmatic access will need to be developed because of the lack of accessibility to all visitors and staff. If the second floor is not refurnished as a print shop, that floor likely will be relegated to such functions as storage and additional conference room/meeting space.\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial\n\nAll interpretive planning and treatments concerning this site will solidly convey its role and status as an integral part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, interpreting Paul Laurence Dunbar's worldrenowned literary accomplishments and his important associations with the Wright brothers.\n\nAs stated previously, a parkwide orientation panel will be installed in an appropriate location to help visitors understand this site's role and involvement in the larger Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. The memorial staff will be consulted and be considered integral in the development of parkwide publications and other similar interpretive materials, such as audio, video, and publications materials.\n\nIn addition to continuing an interpretive focus upon Paul Laurence Dunbar: The Man, His Times, and His Legacy, the Dunbar House staff may consider new exhibits for the house and its auxiliary public use spaces [the two neighboring residences and the historic Dunbar barn] that support this plan. All such new media will particularly focus on interpreting the Paul Laurence Dunbar interpretive theme and its subthemes (please see the \"Interpretive Themes\" section). National Park Service technical support and consultations, training and orientation, and additional staffing assistance will be provided on an \"as requested\" basis.\n\nThe Wright Flyer III and Wright Hall at Carillon Historical Park\n\nAs at the Dunbar House State Memorial, a parkwide orientation panel will be installed in an appropriate location in Wright Hall to help visitors understand this site's integral role and involvement in the larger Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. Their education and visitor services staff will be consulted, and this site will be integrally included in the development of parkwide publications and other similar interpretive materials such as videos and audio tape tours.\n\nIn addition to the Wright Flyer III, the Carillon Historical Park collection contains significant, exhibitable artifacts (some of 64 Recommendations which are already on display) that help interpret Wilbur and Orville Wright's successful invention and perfection of practical powered flight, including the following:\n\nthe Wright brothers' bicycle with the aerodynamics testing device mounted on the handlebar post\n\nthe sewing machine they used to sew the canvas wing, stabilizer and rudder covering\n\nan airplane engine designed, developed, and built by Wilbur and Orville Wright\n\nthe Wright brothers specially modified, improved drafting table\n\nthe camera and tripod they used to photograph their first successful flight at Kitty Hawk, a replica of the original wind tunnel developed by the Wright brothers\n\noriginal pieces of the 1905 Wright Flyer III not used in the restoration\n\nthe canoe used by Wilbur Wright as a \"floatation device\" for the 1910 Hudson Fulton celebration flight\n\nOrville Wright's personal tool chest and tools; a Wright \"B\" Flyer nameplate; commemorative Wright brothers medals, stamps, and memorabilia\n\nIn the process of continuing to interpret the Wright brothers' development of practical, fully controllable flight and the comparative differences between the 1903 Kitty Hawk Flyer and the 1905 Wright Flyer III, the Carillon Historical Park staff will continue to plan and develop future exhibits and interpretive materials for Wright Hall and the replica 1897-1908 Wright Cycle Company building. The direct relationship between the 1905 Wright Flyer III and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field needs to be interpreted — i.e., that this aircraft was successfully flown at Huffman Prairie and that it was the culmination of their efforts to develop the practical airplane. Interpretive media will incorporate these and other Wright brothers' flight-related artifacts to communicate the important theme or concepts that\n\nWilbur and Orville Wright's willingness to question accepted scientific data and their confidence to act upon their own data enabled them to succeed\n\nThe brothers' synergy created a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts\n\nWright Hall with its significant contents, taken in context with all of Carillon Historical Park's invention and transportation artifacts and resources, will be used to interpret the concepts that\n\nthe Wright brothers' invention of powered flight \"facilitated trade and communication, and lead to the creation of new industries\"\n\naviation continued the development sequence of major new transportation replacing previous \"state of the art\" forms of transportation\n\nContinuing National Park Service technical support and consultations, staff training and orientation, and additional staffing assistance will be provided on an \"as requested\" basis.\n\nHuffman Prairie Flying Field and the Wright Memorial\n\nThe Huffman Prairie Flying Field will be interpreted as one of the keystones giving legitimacy to the claim that Dayton is indeed the true birthplace of aviation. All interpretive media planned and installed on this site will seek to minimize intrusions on the integrity of this important cultural landscape.\n\nThe Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is planning a new bicycle/pedestrian trail access to this historic flying field. When that occurs, the existing self-guiding booklet for the flying prairie discovery trail will need revision to reflect the new entrance to the trail. The revised self-guiding trail brochure will be used until replaced by a new series of wayside exhibits.\n\nThis new wayside exhibit system will include an introductory trailhead wayside exhibit and several low-profile interpretive waysides installed along the trail and the perimeter of the flying field. The planning and installation of any such exhibitry, most likely using many of the historic, documentary Wright brothers' photographs taken at Huffman Prairie Flying Field, will be guided by the findings of the cultural landscape report. Possible subjects of these wayside exhibits could include, but not be limited to\n\nthe development of sustained, practical, controllable flight\n\nthe 1904 and 1905 hangars; the catapult tower launching device\n\nSimms Station site\n\nthe 1910 hangar site\n\nthe Wright Company School of Aviation\n\nthe 109-acre natural prairie habitat — the largest surviving natural prairie remnant in Ohio and Orville Wright's initial association with the prairie for natural history studies\n\nLow-profile wayside exhibits will also interpret the Wright Brothers Memorial Hill. High priority will be given to replacing the existing outdoor exhibit shelter with its glass case enclosed panels with a limited number of waysides interpreting such topics as\n\nthe memorial and grounds design and construction\n\nthe dedication with the personal presence of Orville Wright; sensitive, selective interpretation of the prehistoric Indian mounds\n\nthe legacy of powered flight, which is so visible from this promontory\n\nAt these sites also. National Park Service technical support and consultations, staff training and orientation, and staffing assistance will be provided on both an \"as authorized\" and an \"as requested\" basis.\n\nExperiencing the Supportive Heritage Resources\n\nGeneral Planning Considerations\n\nThe four units of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park with national significance are further enhanced and supported by a large number of other supportive aviation, Wright brothers/family, and Paul Laurence Dunbar heritage sites and museums of regional and local significance.\n\nOpportunity to visit and experience these related sites will be provided for those visitors with both additional interest and time.\n\nThese sites and points of interest will be considered in two different categories or levels.\n\nThe first level includes a select group of sites and museums which are particularly supportive of the park's four primary sites. If an audio tape tour or similar media is developed for visitors touring the park in private vehicles, all of these sites will in some way be included. These sites also will be included in the official unigrid folder, if inclusion can be made without confusing or substantially overwhelming the visitor. Since the historical park's enabling legislation allows for National Park Service interpretation of other related heritage sites, one or more interpretive waysides may also be considered for many of these sites.\n\nThe second level will consist of all other sites listed and described in the soon to be released revised edition [1996] of Mary Ann Johnson's A Field Guide to Flight on the Aviation Trail in Dayton, Ohio, published by Landfall Press; plus possibly an additional group of Dunbar heritage sites within the Dayton/Miami Valley area, whose particular identity is yet to be determined.\n\nFirst Level Heritage Sites and Museums\n\nWoodland Cemetery. The cemetery management and education officials will be consulted concerning the appropriateness and feasibility of interpreting the Wright brothers and Paul Laurence Dunbar grave sites, and perhaps the grave sites of other Wright family members and Dayton aviation heritage personalities, with interpretive wayside panel(s).\n\nWright Company Factory. Park staff will work with General Motors factory management to determine the appropriateness and feasibility of a low-profile wayside panel to interpret this important Wright brothers/ aviation heritage site. A location on the outside edge of the front parking lot might be considered.\n\nOther Wright Brothers and Closely Related Sites in the West Dayton Neighborhood\n\nIn addition to the Hoover Block and The Wright Cycle Company building, there are about six Wright brothers and closely related sites and structures in the immediate West Dayton neighborhood which will be marked and interpreted, in some way, via walking tour. These sites include (please see \"Supportive Heritage Sites and Museums\" section for greater details about these sites)\n\nthe Wright family home at 7 Hawthorne Street\n\nthe first Wright brothers print shop\n\nfour other Wright brothers bicycle shops, including the last one in which they invented the first Wright Flyer airplane\n\nOrville Wright's laboratory\n\nLorin Wright's home at 117 South Horace Street (a surviving, occupied residence)\n\nEd Sines' home within the same block on Hawthorne Street as the Wright family home (a surviving, occupied residence)\n\nPark staff will work cooperatively with city officials and neighborhood leaders to lay out and develop a walking tour using a combination of marker posts, a self-guiding pamphlet, and perhaps a few low-profile interpretive waysides. The historical integrity of the historic Wright-Dunbar neighborhood needs to be considered in determining the nature of the interpretive media devices to be used.\n\nWright Seaplane Base Site. If an appropriate overlook with adequate access and parking can be developed working cooperatively with local officials and neighborhood leaders, a low-profile interpretive wayside will be used to interpret the Wright Seaplane Base site, one aspect of the range and variety of Wilbur and Orville's creative genius.\n\nHawthorn Hill. Because Hawthorn Hill is neither open to the public nor easily accessible as a visitor experience, alternate programmatic access to Orville Wright's Hawthorn Hill mansion at the west interpretive .center will be quite appropriate, perhaps using a video program that will interpret the story of the Wright brothers' fame and achievement while not encouraging inappropriate site visits. Interpretive literature might also relate all or parts of the story.\n\nU.S. Air Force Museum. A Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park orientation panel will be developed cooperatively with U.S. Air Force Museum management officials for this location. A possible location will be near the Dayton/Montgomery County Visitors Bureau office within the Memorial Park next to the Air Force Museum parking lot.\n\nOther Theme-Related Museums, Repositories, and Exhibits. Several other sites with Wright brothers, aviation heritage or Paul Laurence Dunbar related themes and exhibits are worthy of visitors' time and effort to see them. Some type of informational/ interpretive media will be planned to help visitors experience and understand additional aspects of these stories at the following museums\n\nKettering-Moraine Museum, with its Wright family exhibits, including original furniture from Orville's Hawthorn Hill mansion\n\nDavid Gold Parachute Museum in the Aviation Trail building\n\nNational Afro-American Museum branch to be located in the former Zion Baptist Church in West Dayton, which will directly relate to the Paul Laurence Dunbar heritage story\n\nMontgomery County Historical Society, whose rotating exhibits frequently include artifacts relating to the Wright brothers, the Wright family, and Dayton's aviation heritage\n\nthe Paul Laurence Dunbar Library at Wright State University, especially archives and special collections with its Wright brothers' memorabilia artifacts on public exhibit\n\nthe flyable reproduction Wright \"B\" Flyer, on public view several days per week at Dayton Wright Brothers Airport\n\nSecond Level Heritage Sites and Museums\n\nFor visitors with greater interest in Dayton's aviation heritage and a comparable amount of time to satisfy that interest, over 20 other Dayton Aviation Heritage sites are available for their exploring pleasure. These sites are listed and described in Aviation Trail, Inc.'s A Field Guide to Plight on the Aviation Trail in Dayton, Ohio, written by Mary Ann Johnson.\n\nInterpretive / Visitor Service Research Elements Supporting the Visitor Experience\n\nInterpretive Media Action Plans\n\nInterpretive media action plans will be needed for the following media: waysides, publications, historic furnishings, interior exhibits, and audiovisual programs.\n\nParkwide Wayside Exhibit and Identification Sign Plan. Section 105(d) of the park's enabling legislation specifically authorize the National Park Service to identify, mark, and interpret \"other significant sites related to the Wright brothers, the history of aviation, or Paul Laurence Dunbar in the Miami Valley which are related to the park.\"\n\nBased upon that authorization, a comprehensive parkwide wayside exhibit and identification sign plan is needed to plan and implement an appropriate wayside exhibit/identification sign system.\n\nThis wayside exhibits/sign plan should include, but may not be limited to, parkwide orientation panels, including \"after hours\" orientation waysides, site identification signs, and interpretive wayside exhibits. The design and placement of each of these waysides must sensitively consider the nature and integrity of the site in which it will be located. Although these waysides may be planned as a cohesive system, they may need to be produced in two and possibly three phases.\n\nThe parkwide orientation panels may be located at Wright Hall at Carillon Historical Park, at the Dunbar House, and near the U.S. Air Force Museum, as well as an \"after hours\" orientation panel for each of the two interpretive centers.\n\nThe series of site identification signs will be developed and installed to identify supportive properties and interpretively place them in context with the larger Dayton aviation heritage. Each of these identification signs will consist of an identifying title, the Dayton Aviation Heritage logo, and a limited label text not to exceed two or three short sentences. Examples of sites or properties identified for these type signs may be the Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum and/or the Kettering-Moraine Museum, hi essence, this will be the logical continuation of a project already begun by Aviation Trail, Inc., [ATI] as a key element in the development of their Aviation Trail. Thus, the continued development of the site identification sign system cam build upon the original efforts of ATI and be carried out in full cooperation with them, as well as with the concurrence of site owners.\n\nThe series of low-profile interpretive waysides will combine succinct text with appropriate supportive graphics to interpret a visible resource or feature. The series can include, but not necessarily be limited to, panels for the site of the Wright family home at 7 Hawthorne Street in West Dayton; the Wright Memorial; the Huffman Prairie Flying Field; the Wright Company Airplane Factory; the Wright Seaplane Base; a West Dayton neighborhood walking tour; and perhaps some Dunbar-related sites.\n\nPublications and Related Portable Media Plan. Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park needs a comprehensive, parkwide plan to identify publications and related portable media that will best satisfy park needs — both parkwide titles and sitespecific titles for all units and/or sites within the park.\n\nAs previously stated, the park needs both a single-sheet \"racked\" or \"image\" card and an official unigrid folder. These two items will constitute the park's primary tools for visitor information and orientation.\n\nThe site-promotional \"rack\" or \"image\" card will continue to provide potential park visitors with basic site visit information in an economical format that provides a much needed alternative to the distribution of the more expensive park folder via area/regional card or folder racks.\n\nThe unigrid folder will contain\n\nan overall statement of park significance\n\na well-designed tour map\n\nclear, concise written directions (in addition to tour route indications on the map)\n\nsuccinct site descriptions and significance statements for the four primary park units\n\nIf possible to do so without confusing and/or overwhelming park visitors, consideration will be given to at least listing and locating the \"first level sites\" listed in the \"Experiencing the Supportive Heritage Resources \" section described above.\n\nAs the park develops, a series of site-specific bulletins will be developed. These site bulletins will be produced using a consistency of plan and design resulting in a coordinated \"family look\" for all bulletins in the series. Many of these site bulletins can be prepared and produced almost immediately and be available for visitor use while other publications and media are awaiting funding, development, and production.\n\nTopics and sites to be considered for this series may include, but certainly not be limited to\n\nThe Wright Cycle Company building the Hoover Block\n\nHuffman Prairie Flying Field\n\nHuffman Prairie Natural Area\n\nWright Memorial Hill\n\n1905 Wright Flyer III and Wright Hall\n\nDunbar House State Memorial\n\nWright brothers/Dunbar grave sites at Woodland Cemetery\n\nWright Aircraft Factory\n\nWright Seaplane Base\n\nHawthorn Hill\n\nthe succession of Wright brothers'\n\nprinting shops in West Dayton\n\nthe succession of Wright brothers' bicycle shops in West Dayton\n\nthe evolution/refinement of the various aircraft invented and/or manufactured by the Wright brothers\n\nthe working relationships — business, social, and intellectual — between the Wright brothers and Paul Laurence Dunbar\n\nsome type of a \"sampler\" of Dunbar' s writings — including examples from his poetry, fiction, essays, lyrics, and drama\n\na walking tour of the Wright brothers' West Dayton neighborhood\n\nThese bulletins either can be produced individually or in logical groupings. It will be well to give serious consideration to the production of these bulletins by the U.S. Government Printing Office service office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\n\nA moderately priced, general Dayton Aviation Heritage sales publication needs to be developed and produced. Such a publication might be developed as an official National Park Service handbook or a major interpretive publication of the park's yet to be designated cooperating association. This publication may present both the overall park significance — nationally and internationally, as well as include all legislated park units and key supportive partner sites. It, thus, will be intended for sale at multiple sales outlets throughout the park.\n\nA moderately priced parkwide children's publication may also be produced as a sales item for multiple sales outlets throughout the park. This publication may take on any one of several different kinds of formats: a nonfiction adventure story; a biography of the Wright brothers that specifically includes the business and social friendship between Paul Laurence Dunbar and the brothers; or perhaps a creatively written and designed activity book. However, a simple coloring book format will be emphatically avoided.\n\nShould any type of commercial transportation linkage between the various partner sites be developed by community interests (such as the rubber-tired Wright Flyer trolley), the National Park Service needs to plan, produce, and install an audio enhancement program keyed to the transportation system's stops. The tape, which will include both information/ orientation and interpretation narratives and may incorporate appropriate ambient sounds, can be augmented with interpretive publications and/or signs. Nonpersonal media, such as those described above, will be much more practical and cost effective than the assignment of any of the park's limited interpretive staff to these commercial vehicles. Any and all such interpretive media will be developed in ways that will be complementary to the text and map in the park's unigrid folder.\n\nWith increasing frequency, commercial tour buses are equipped with \"on-board\" video tape systems with multiple monitors located throughout the bus. A video interpretive piece can be developed for use on board those commercial tour coaches and other similar applications.\n\nAlso as related above, an audio guide or tour designed for use in private vehicles needs to be planned and produced as a sales item. This tour will be planned to coordinate with the tour route laid out in the park unigrid folder. This tape tour format will consider inclusion of information/orientation to direct visitors from site to site and/or site-specific interpretation for a number of the heritage sites along the Dayton aviation and Dunbar heritage trails. Audio enhancement may be particularly appropriate for site-specific interpretation of the Huffman Prairie Flying Field and the Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum.\n\nMany different types of delivery audio systems for this tape tour will be considered and evaluated for this audio program, including (but not necessarily limited to) audio tape; compact disk [it is appropriate to note that the transition from cassette audio tape decks to compact disk decks for private automobiles is well under way]; \"zoo key;\" audio wand; and Travelers Information System [TIS]. The selected delivery system must also include adaptations as necessary for visitors with impairments (such as a written script for the hearing impaired) and needs (such as translations for international visitors, especially in the Japanese and German languages and perhaps in Russian, Chinese, French, and/or Spanish). In an appropriate, nonconfusing manner, this audio tour should also include those sites listed within the first level of supportive heritage sites. As in the proposal for the audio tape narration for the \"on-board\" audio tape program for the public transportation linkage system, this interpretive tape program can benefit from the incorporation of pertinent ambient sounds as well as the narration.\n\nShould an audio tape and/or a compact disk tour format be the selected format, it will be well to consider alternatives to loaning cassette tapes and/or compact disks [CDS]. Since most private and commercial rental vehicles have tape or CD sound systems these days and renting and/or loaning tapes will be a logistical nightmare, the text for a \"private vehicle\" tape tour will be developed to make it available to visitors as a sales item. This tape will be produced by either a commercial organization or a cooperating association of some sort. Consideration may also be given to exploring the possibilities of developing a system of cooperative partnership agreements with Dayton rental car company outlets to offer the Dayton Aviation Heritage tour tape as a rental option.\n\nAn interpretive video of the park and its key sites will be developed as a sales item. Inclusion of all or part of the \"Dayton Heritage of Flight\" interpretive audiovisual program produced for primary use at the park's two interpretive centers will be considered. Because Wright-Patterson Air Force Base attracts significant numbers of foreign visitors from numerous countries and the international relevance of this important story, consideration will be given to translating and producing this video in several major foreign languages — particularly German, Japanese, Russian, and Chinese — and perhaps in Spanish and French. The multimedia center staff and facilities at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be considered as a possible resource for help in developing this sales video.\n\nSerious consideration will be given to editing and publishing a general interpretive version of the Wright Research Committee's forthcoming source book — Wilbur and Orville Wright Handbook of Facts. This \"mother lode\" of Wright brothers' information presented in a general interest format may prove to be a popular sales item.\n\nA written guide to selected national and international Wright brothers and aviation heritage sites should be researched, compiled and published—probably as an inexpensive sales publication. The following sites and museums are examples of the types of places that will be considered in such a guide book (note: this should not be considered to be an exhaustive list):\n\nWright Brothers National Memorial, Kitty Hawk, North Carolina\n\nWilbur Wright Birthplace State Historic Site, near Millville, Indiana\n\nGreenfield Village, Dearborn, Michigan\n\nSmithsonian Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC\n\nInternational Women's Air and Space Museum, Centerville, Ohio\n\nNeil Armstrong Air and Space Museum, Wapakoneta, Ohio\n\nKennedy Space Flight Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida\n\nGlenn L. Martin Aviation Museum, Middle River, Maryland\n\nMuseum of Flight, Seattle, Washington Glenn H. Curtis Museum of Local History, Hammondsport, New York\n\nAir Power Park and Museum, Hampton. Virginia\n\nNational Warplane Museum, Geneseo, New York\n\nPima Air Museum, Tucson, Arizona\n\nSouthern Museum of Flight, Birmingham, Alabama\n\nTexas Air Museum, Rio Hondo, Texas the aviation portions of the Alexander Graham Bell National Historical Park, Baddeck, Nova Scotia\n\nthe Canadian Armed Forces' Shearwater Aviation Museum, Shearwater, Nova Scotia\n\nA written guide to selected national and international Paul Laurence Dunbar heritage sites will be prepared and published, if results of research (such as the park's HRS) so warrant. Consideration will be given to organizing the guide into two parts — all other sites directly associated with Paul Laurence Dunbar within one part, and the general surrounding Dunbar neighborhood within the other part.\n\nHistoric Furnishings Reports. Historic furnishings reports will be absolutely necessary for any refurnished spaces within the park. The completion of such reports will minimize speculative refurnishing. Specifically, historic furnishings reports will be needed for\n\nThe Wright Cycle Company building — both floors (proper documentation may come to light that support the tradition of a Wright brothers printing operation on the second floor)\n\nthe Paul Laurence Dunbar House [Note: although the need for this report has been identified, the \"who,\" \"what,\" and \"when\" is yet unidentified]\n\nperhaps the Wright brothers printing shop suite in the Hoover Block, if the parkwide historic resources study provides reasonable indications that sufficient documentation about the size and nature of the shop\n\nExhibit Plans. Detailed plans for the interior exhibits of the west and east interpretive centers will need to be developed through the cooperative team work of exhibit planners and exhibit designers.\n\nThe National Park Service will provide planning and design assistance for the exhibit areas for Wright Hall at Carillon Historical Park and the exhibit galleries at the Paul Laurence Dunbar House, when requested and if resources are available.\n\nAudiovisual Treatment Plans. Detailed audiovisual program treatment plans will be needed for the \"Dayton Heritage of Flight\" audiovisual program for use as a major media presentation in both the west and east interpretive centers.\n\nSimilar audiovisual treatment plans will be required for several AV \"loops\" which will be integral segments of key exhibits for both the west and the east interpretive centers.\n\nInterpretive / Visitor Services Staffing\n\nIn support of the General Management Plan, it is relevant to include a general specification of interpretation/visitor services staff use within this Interpretive Plan. If adequate park funding is available, all four legislated units of the park will be provided NPS interpretive services staffing, as well as appropriate NPS technical assistance staffing and services. Relevant technical assistance will include, but will not necessarily be limited to, the following: interpretive planner; historic architect; education outreach specialist/ coordinator; management assistant; \"Volunteers-in- Parks\" coordinator/training officer; public information specialist; and cultural arts specialist.\n\nThe General Management Plan identifies the estimated amount of both funding and staff needed to meet the objectives of the plan. Following is a detailed outline of additional technical assistance, interpretation, and visitor services staff required to meet the objectives of the plan:\n\nPriority 1\n\nYear-round staffing of\n\nbicycle shop 0.5 FTE\n\nInterpreter 0.5\n\nPriority 2\n\nTechnical Support (TS) 4.0 FTE\n\nInterpretive Planner 1.0\n\nEducation Specialist 1.0\n\nHistoric Architect 1.0\n\nManagement Assistant 1.0\n\nPriority 3\n\nWest Interpretive Center 5.5 FTE\n\nPark Ranger Interpretation 3.5\n\nCultural Arts Coordinator 1.0\n\nPublic Affairs Specialist 1.0\n\nPriority 4\n\nEast Interpretive Center 5.0 FTE\n\nPark Ranger Interpretation 4.0\n\nVolunteer/Training Coordinator 1.0\n\nPriority 5\n\nCarillon Historical Park 3.0 FTE\n\nInterpreters 3.0\n\nPriority 6\n\nPaul L. Dunbar House 3.0 FTE\n\nInterpreters 3.0\n\nTotal FTE 20.0 FTE\n\nResearch/Studies"
