        "text": "Join us for a tour of the Patterson Homestead\n\nPatterson Homestead Public Tours\n\nOriginally the home of Revolutionary War soldier Colonel Robert Patterson, the founder of Lexington, Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio, this Federal-style historic house museum tells the story of Dayton’s influential Patterson family. Colonel Patterson first settled here in 1804, and upon his death in 1827, Rubicon Farm (the name of his land) covered 2,038 acres. Constructed in three major components between 1816 and 1850, this legendary home raised three generations of Pattersons, including John H. Patterson, the founder of National Cash Register Company. He established the headquarters of NCR roughly a half-mile northwest of the Homestead on the original family land.\n\nIn 1953, John H. Patterson’s nephew Jefferson Patterson donated the Patterson Homestead to the City of Dayton—its six period rooms showcase 18th and 19th century antiques and Patterson family artifacts. Over time, more family-related artifacts have been added to the collection, and an exhibit gallery was included to tell NCR’s groundbreaking story.\n\nTours run every half hour and are 45-minutes in length. Advanced reservations are required for the tour.\n\nPlease contact Carillon Historical Park with questions or concerns at 937-293-2841.\n\nRefunds are not valid for tickets, only exchanges to another date"
