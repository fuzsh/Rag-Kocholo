        "text": "Owner: Ohio History Connection / Dayton History\n\nArchitect: Amy Kaspar\n\nDayton, OH\n\nPantry Renovation\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, we reconstructed Matilda Dunbar’s pantry, which had been removed years ago to make way for a basement stair.\n\nIn this restoration, the stairs were removed and a trap door and ladder reinstalled for access to the basement. The door to the pantry was custom built to match the adjacent doors and the pantry was then rebuilt, based on the historical record and evidence found on the walls indicating where the shelves had been.\n\nThe style of the cabinet was copied from other details in the house. Care was taken to finish the wood with shellac to match the original adjacent finishes in both color and sheen.\n\nLibrary Restoration\n\nThe Mundy Library is part of the Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial complex. The project here was to add library shelving on both sides of the original fireplace to match the original woodwork of the fireplace.\n\nUsing new quarter-sawn white oak, we carefully matched the profiles of the fireplace moldings, hand carving the large curved molding at the top. Once the cabinetry was made, we were challenged by the task of matching the depth of the original 100-year-old finish color.\n\nThe final match was achieved by a combination of chemically aging the wood with potassium dichromate, a sealer coat of shellac, two coats of filler, and then several coats of a mixture of three natural colors of shellac, which we mixed up from flakes or buttons, as would have been done when the building was new.\n\nOwner: Dayton History / Dayton Aviation National Historical Park\n\nDayton, OH\n\nWe have had the honor, over the past couple of years, of helping Dayton History to maintain the Wright Brothers’ historic mansion, Hawthorn Hill.\n\nIn the first phase, we repaired some damage on the cornice from a leaky gutter and some bird damage. In the second, more involved phase, we completely rebuilt the balustrade above both of the house's grand side porches. Lastly, we restored several windows by scraping, glazing, and painting.\n\nAlthough the railings had been rebuilt within the last 20 years, the materials and construction did not hold up well to the weather. Our replacement design included rot-resistant components like durable cypress wood, pressure-treated plywood, and galvanized steel, but the overall appearance of the balustrade remained faithful to the original.\n\nThe railings and posts were fabricated in our Franklin workshops and later hauled to Oakwood to be installed on-site. Special care was taken to ensure that the balustrade could be completely disassembled and reassembled in the near future, as the underlying roof will need to be replaced in the coming years.\n\nFollowing our restoration of the second-story balustrades in 2013, we were called upon to refurbish the balustrades on the ground level in 2014. We also made cosmetic repairs to the second-story windows and the garage, and we repaired the south cornice molding where carpenter bees continue to cause damage to the historic woodwork.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, we had the opportunity to restore the finish on the second floor of Hawthorn Hill.\n\nAfter Orville Wright's death in 1948, Hawthorn Hill was operated as a guest house for NCR for many years. During this time the building was remodeled to suit its new purpose. Carpeting was installed and the original oak floor was extensively damaged. We were asked to restore the floor after the carpet was removed.\n\nWe hand scraped the paint off the floor and used Andy's special wood restoration solution to clean the floors and blend the existing finish with areas where the finish was damaged. We then applied a wax finish. In the photos, you can see patches where the floor was taken up to add plumbing for additional restrooms. We matched the floor color with a stain to blend with the original floor color.\n\nAs always, we enjoyed the opportunity to play a part in the unique history of this building.\n\nOwner: Dayton History\n\nDayton, OH\n\nThe Patterson Homestead, built in three stages between 1816 and 1850, is a Dayton landmark under the care of Dayton History. It was the home of Col. Robert Patterson, a Revolutionary War soldier and one of the founders of both Lexington, KY and Cincinnati, OH.\n\nThree generations of Patterson's were raised in the house, including Col. Patterson's grandson, John H. Patterson, the legendary industrialist and founder of the National Cash Register Co.\n\nOur most recent project on this property concerned the two-story porch on the 1850s section of the house. The porch's box gutter had been leaking off and on for years, causing severe deterioration to the porch below.\n\nIn deconstructing the gutters, we discovered that the center of the gutters was the lowest point, which had been a consistent source of the difficulty. We jacked up sections of the porch to correct the slope and improve drainage.\n\nWe altered the cross-section of the gutter to increase capacity and to encourage draining in the correct direction. We took out four layers of previous gutter liners and lined the rebuilt gutters with new copper. We filled the gutters to capacity and observed the flow of water to confirm that water was draining properly before completing the project.\n\nThe deteriorated wood resulting from the leaking gutters extended all the way to the floor joists. Damaged wood was replaced with custom-made matching woodwork.\n\nCarillon Historical Park\n\nOwner: Dayton History\n\nDayton, Ohio\n\nThese Olmsted Brothers-designed shelters were a feature of NCR’s Old River Park in Dayton for many years. Long after the park closed and all but the roofs of the shelters had decayed beyond repair, the roofs and what was left of the Pennsylvania Bluestone floors were given to Carillon Park. We constructed new replica brackets that were copied from historical photos and new cypress posts with one significant design change: the posts now sit on stone plinths which will help keep the wood from rotting. We carefully lifted the roofs into place. The original hewn oak structures were in remarkably good condition.\n\nThe cedar shakes were replaced and a new finial was turned. We used steam to bend the cedar shakes for the unique flare detail near the eave of each roof. We used a combination of reclaimed original and new bluestone to construct the floor of each shelter."
