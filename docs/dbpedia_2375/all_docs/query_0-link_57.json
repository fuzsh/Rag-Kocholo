        "text": "As a child, I first encountered stories about people of the past in museums and historic sites, and these institutions are still my favorite places to share my passion for history. I am experienced in the areas of museum interpretation and education (including first- and third-person), visitor service, research and program development, exhibit planning and design, publicity, and administration. Most recently, I collaborated to develop a tour of the National Museum of the United States Air Force that highlights technological contributions made by the Air Force Research Laboratory and its predecessors.\n\nI also recently worked with Stow Historical Society (Stow, Ohio) on the interpretation of a late nineteenth-century one-room schoolhouse. I wrote and received an Ohio Humanities grant to fund the production of interpretive panels for the schoolhouse, which I developed and arranged to have produced. On my blog, I wrote about the experience of engaging visitors to the schoolhouse with the story of education in an early Ohio town. Images of the panels have been posted on the Stow Historical Society website."
