Through interactive demonstrations, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the techniques used by our ancestors to create everyday items.\n\nAlong with historical demonstrations, attendees can explore the many exhibits at the Park, including the Wright Brothers National Museum, showcasing the 1905 Wright Flyer III and the world's most expansive collection of Wright family artifacts. Gem City Letterpress, the nation's only fully operational 1930s letterpress job shop in a museum, will be up and running. Visitors will also be able to ride the Carillon Park Rail & Steam Society-operated miniature trains, as well as the new full-size Carillon Park Railroad.\n\nAfter a full day of historical demonstrations, family fun, and general merriment, the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra will fill the air with beautiful patriotic music. Join Carillon Historical Park to enjoy this festive way to ring in summer."
