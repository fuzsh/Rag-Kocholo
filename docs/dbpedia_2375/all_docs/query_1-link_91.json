It's a hidden gem rich in history, culture and recreation.\n\nA mid-sized city in southwestern Ohio, Dayton teems with imagination, innovation and world-class arts and culture. As the \"Birthplace of Aviation,\" Dayton’s brightest and bravest have always pushed society forward, inventing the airplane, the cash register, the electric car starter, modern refrigeration and the bar code scanner — to name just a few.\n\nRegardless of your interests, there's always something fun to do on and around campus."
