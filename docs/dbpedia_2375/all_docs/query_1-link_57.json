        "text": "(PREBLE COUNTY, Ohio) - Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, First Lady Fran DeWine, Ohio Department of Transportation Director Jack Marchbanks, and Ohio Department of Development Director Lydia Mihalik today unveiled the re-imagined Welcome Center on I-70 eastbound in Preble County and announced the plan to replace 33 rest area buildings over the next four years.\n\nThe Preble County Welcome Center, just inside Ohio’s western border, is part of the Governor’s vision to greatly improve the traveler experience for the thousands of visitors who stop at Ohio rest areas every day.\n\nI-70 Preble County Welcome Center\n\nWhile the new building at the Preble County Welcome Center opened in 2019, the site has recently been re-imagined with upgrades, which include native Ohio plants and landscaping, dog trails, Ohio music, rocking chairs, and a Storybook Trail outside.\n\n“The Storybook Trail allows kids and their families to read an Imagination Library book while burning off some energy at the rest area,” said First Lady DeWine. “And I hope this Storybook Trail will motivate people to explore nearly two dozen other Storybook Trails in Ohio parks and enroll Ohio children under age 5 for Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library of Ohio to get free books!”\n\nInside, visitors can learn about Ohio’s history as the “Birthplace of Aviation” and see places of interest to help plan their next adventure to the area. The enhancements were a collaboration between the Ohio Department of Transportation and the Ohio Department of Development.\n\n“No matter where you find yourself in Ohio, you can be in a bustling city, a charming small town, or a beautiful outdoor destination with just a quick drive,” said Director Mihalik. “Ohio’s rest areas offer an opportunity to welcome visitors and showcase all our state has to offer.”\n\nThe pictures and tourism information on the walls inside the Welcome Center highlight aviation and space work, history, research, and exploration. The display focuses on the Wright Brothers’ journey to flight, Wright Brothers National Museum, Carillon Historical Park, National Museum of the United States Air Force, Armstrong Air and Space Museum, Ohio NASA astronauts, NASA Glenn Research Center, and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\n\nFor video of the Preble County Welcome Center, click here.\n\nGuests can scan QR codes on the walls for more information about other nearby attractions, such as the historic Paul Laurence Dunbar House, local and state parks, Ohio public universities, and other historical sites. A 10-foot map of Ohio highlights popular attractions.\n\nI-90 Ashtabula County Welcome Center"
