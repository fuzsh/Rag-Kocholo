Their great-grandfather, Dan Wright, brought his family to Ohio in 1814 and bought a piece of land adjacent to the new National Road in what is now Miami County, just north of Dayton, OH. Dan's son, Dan Jr. moved to Rush County, Indiana where his son Milton  the father of the Wright brothers  was born. Milton became a preacher in the United Brethren Church, then was promoted to edit the Religious Telescope, published by the United Brethren in Dayton. Milton would have other church assignments that took him and his family elsewhere, but they always came back to Dayton. In 1884, the Wright family  including Orville and Wilbur Wright  moved to Dayton permanently. Both Orville and Wilbur were life-long residents from that moment.\n\nBecause of their long history with Dayton, there are many places in Dayton that can claim some involvement with the Wright brothers. We've listed a few here that will be of most interest to aviators, historians, and scholars.\n\nCarillon Park\n\nDayton Engineers Club\n\nDayton Metro Library\n\nDeeds Point\n\nHawthorn Hill\n\nHuffman Prairie\n\nNational Museum of the United States Air Force\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar Library\n\nWoodlawn Cemetery and Arboretum\n\nWright Bicycle Shop No. 4\n\nWright Hill Memorial\n\nWright Company Factory\n\nWright Laboratory Memorial\n\nUp for a virtual expedition?
