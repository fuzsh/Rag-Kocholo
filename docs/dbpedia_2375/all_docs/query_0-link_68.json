        "text": "Are you headed to Dayton’s Aviation Heritage Trail and want to see the highlights over the weekend?\n\nAs a member of the National Park Association, I receive a fantastic magazine with excellent articles and ads about places to visit.\n\nA stuffed animal bear called “Wilbear Wright,” an aviation teddy bear, was in an ad about visiting Dayton’s Aviation History.\n\nThe bear was nearly a look-alike to a bear my sister had growing up – we just had to get the bear! Wilbear Wright is a big deal – he’s even got his own Wilbear Facebook page!\n\nSo, if you're planning a weekend getaway and eager to explore the unique aviation heritage in the Dayton area, you're in for a treat.\n\nIn this blog post, we'll guide you through an action-packed two-day adventure, uncovering the captivating stories and landmarks that shaped the world of flight.\n\nFrom aviation-related sites to unique attractions, we've got your itinerary covered. Our mission was to visit eight of the seventeen stops along the Dayton Aviation Trail.\n\nWe were able to visit the required number of stops within 28 hours with careful planning. Some optional places to visit are only open a few days a week or for limited hours.\n\nSo fasten your seatbelts and get ready to take flight into the past and present of aviation history in Dayton!\n\nDayton Aviation Heritage – Day 1 Itinerary\n\n10:15 AM Wright-Dunbar Interpretive Center & Aviation Trail Visitor Center\n\nThe Interpretive Center was our starting point and is also one of the four required stops. We picked up the flyer we were to take around and got our passport stamped at the appropriate location.\n\nThe flier can also be found online and printed if you want to start your tour elsewhere. Also, make sure to get your National Park Unit Stamp!\n\nWe received some information from the park ranger and were off on our adventure. Due to limited hours at two locations, we headed out and would return to this site later.\n\nThis site is one of the six units of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park.\n\nAddress: 16 South Williams Street, Dayton, OH 45402\n\nHours: Daily, 9 AM to 4 PM\n\nCost: Free\n\n10:30 AM-11:00 AM Woodland Cemetery & Arboretum\n\nThe Woodland Cemetery, welcome center staff, stamped our flyer and provided a highlighted map showing key sites to visit within the Cemetery. These sites included the Wright Brothers, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and the Huffman Family Vault.\n\nWoodland Cemetery & Arboretum stands out as a distinctive destination due to its rich history and multifaceted attributes.\n\nEstablished as one of the nation's oldest rural garden cemeteries, it holds a unique position as a cultural, botanical, and educational resource.\n\nThe Arboretum at Woodland Cemetery is accredited as a Level II Arboretum by The ArbNet Arboretum Accreditation Program.\n\nIt also holds a place in the esteemed Morton Register of Arboreta. This renowned database encompasses arboreta and gardens worldwide, specifically dedicated to the cultivation and celebration of woody plants.\n\nThe combination of Woodland Cemetery's historical significance, its diverse range of botanical treasures, and its recognition within esteemed arboretum publications make it a truly remarkable and unparalleled destination.\n\nThe “Look Out” was also recommended, and it provided a spectacular panoramic view of downtown Dayton.\n\nAddress: 118 Woodland Avenue, Dayton, OH 45409\n\nHours: Monday – Friday 8 AM – 5 PM, unfortunately, this site is currently closed on the weekends\n\nCost: Free\n\n11:10 AM-1:30 PM Carillon Historical Park\n\nCarillon Historical Park offers a multitude of experiences that allow visitors to immerse themselves in Dayton's rich heritage of creativity and invention.\n\nSituated on a picturesque 65-acre campus nestled between the Great Miami River and a glacial moraine, the park presents a unique opportunity to explore the region's aviation history and discover its profound impact on the world.\n\nWhile the stamp is available in the gift shop, I encourage you to immerse yourself fully. Delve into the exhibits and displays that echo with the spirit of innovation. The park is reminiscent of the Henry Ford Museum in Metro Detroit.\n\nWithin the park, you can delve into a series of captivating historic exhibits that vividly showcase the remarkable achievements of the Wright brothers and other notable pioneers.\n\nThese exhibits highlight the region's iconic aviation history and provide detailed insights into the inventive spirit that thrived in Dayton.\n\nAs you enter the grounds, you will greeted by the captivating story of flight's early days. The centerpiece is the 1905 Wright Flyer, the first practical airplane, a tangible marvel of the Wright Brothers' ingenuity, displayed in the Wright Hall.\n\nThis Flyer was meticulously restored under Orville Wright's watchful guidance.\n\nBut that's not all. Within the wings of the Wright Hall, you'll find more than history; you'll find inspiration.\n\nA replica of the bike shop where the Wright Brothers crafted the 1903 airplane stands, reminding us of their dedication and audacity. The story connects seamlessly to the John W. Berry, Sr. Wright Brothers National Museum, a tribute to an influential chapter in aviation history.\n\nAn unmissable attraction at Carillon Historical Park is Hawthorn Hill, the imposing mansion that served as the residence of Orville Wright.\n\nThis historic site offers visitors the chance to step back in time and immerse themselves in the luxurious surroundings that Orville Wright called home.\n\nTo visit Hawthorn Hill, advance pre-paid admission is required, ensuring an exclusive and informative tour of this significant piece of history.\n\nAddress: 1000 Carillon Blvd., Dayton, OH 45409\n\nHours: 9:30 AM – 5:00 PM Monday through Saturday, 12:00 PM – 5:00 PM on Sunday\n\nCost: $14 adult (ages 18-59), $12 senior (age 60+), $10 child (3 –17), Children age 2 and under and Dayton History members are FREE\n\n2 PM-2:20 PM Wright “B” Flyer\n\nWright “B” Flyer is an optional stop we decided to visit. This site is only open a few days a week and has shorter visiting hours. After entering the small area just inside the door, a staff member greeted us and told us about what they do at the facility.\n\nWe loved this site! It was one of the highlights of our trip.\n\nIf you want a lifetime experience, consider riding in the Wright B Flyer! (There is a fee associated with taking a flight.)\n\nAddress: 10550 Springboro Pike (Rt. 741), Miamisburg, OH 45342\n\nHours: Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM.\n\nCost: Free\n\n2:20 PM-2:50 PM Paul Laurence Dunbar House Historic Site\n\nThe Paul Laurence Dunbar House State Memorial is an optional stop. Besides just the house to visit, there is a visitor center. The National Park Service staff will take you on a home tour if you would like.\n\nHaving been on the home tour before, we did a quick revisit, where we checked out the rooms but didn’t have the guide explain everything. If it is your first time visiting, expect the hour to be about 30 minutes.\n\nThe Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial offers visitors the opportunity to explore the historic house that was purchased by Paul Laurence Dunbar for his mother, Matilda, in 1904.\n\nAfter Matilda's passing in 1936, this house was designated by the state of Ohio as the first house museum dedicated to honoring an African American.\n\nWhen visiting the memorial, you can witness the actual residence that once belonged to Dunbar's family and gain insights into their lives during the early 20th century.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Paul Laurence Dunbar, he is a celebrated African-American prolific writer who left an indelible mark on literature with verses that captured the struggles and aspirations of his time.\n\nDunbar's eloquent words illuminated the African-American experience, bridging cultures and generations with his unique voice.\n\nThe home was once in an upper to middle-class neighborhood. The surrounding homes have been slipping into disrepair. On-street parking is available. We were comfortable visiting the site during the day, but it might not be the safest at night.\n\nAddress: 219 North Paul Laurence Dunbar St., Dayton, OH 45402\n\nHours: Friday – Sunday 10 AM to 4 PM​\n\nCost: Free\n\n3 PM-4 PM Wright-Dunbar Interpretive Center & Aviation Trail Visitor Center\n\nWe made it back in time for the 3 PM Wright Cycle Shop tour. The tour meets at the front desk of the visitor center. Once inside the bicycle shop, the park ranger tells a little about the history and lets you wander around the bicycle business and ask questions.\n\nThe Wright Cycle Company holds tremendous significance in the history of bicycles and the pioneering achievements of the Wright brothers.\n\nThis particular bicycle shop, which is identified as the fourth location established by the Wrights, stands as a testament to their noteworthy venture in the bicycle business.\n\nIts historical value is recognized by its designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1990.\n\nThe establishment of the Wright Cycle Company played a pivotal role in the brothers' journey towards manned flight.\n\nBefore venturing into aviation, Wilbur and Orville Wright delved into the bicycle industry, where they gained invaluable knowledge and experience in mechanics, engineering, and problem-solving.\n\nWithin this shop's walls, the Wright brothers honed their skills and fostered their innovative thinking.\n\nThe significance of the Wright Cycle Company stems from its association with the Wright brothers' relentless pursuit of their passion.\n\nThe bicycle shop served as a place of business and a hub for experimentation and invention.\n\nIt was within these walls that the Wrights developed their unique understanding of balance, control, and aerodynamics, concepts that would later prove crucial in their aeronautical endeavors.\n\nBack in the visitor center, we explored the two floors of exhibits, including the Aviation Trail Parachute Museum, which is another stamp for the flyer! The Parachute Museum tells the story of the development of the free-fall parachute.\n\nThe accessibility of the location also adds to its significance.\n\nCycling enthusiasts can take advantage of their own bicycles or rent ones from the city's bike share program, allowing you to personally engage with the historical site and sense the spirit of adventure that drove the Wright brothers' visionary pursuits.\n\nAddress: 16 South Williams Street, Dayton, OH 45402\n\nHours: Daily, 9 AM to 4 PM\n\nCost: Free\n\nAccommodations: Comfort Inn & Suites Dayton\n\nWe found the Comfort Inn & Suites in Dayton to be an affordable option. The room was clean. The bedding was comfortable; however, the quality of the sheets was relatively poor during our visit.\n\nThe towels were soft. This hotel features an indoor pool. Breakfast was comparable to other chain hotels.\n\n➡️Book your stay at Comfort Inn & Suites Dayton here! ⬅️\n\nAddress: 9305 N. Main Street, Dayton, OH 45415\n\nFood: Company 7 BBQ\n\nThis fire station-themed BBQ joint featured a wide array of smoked meats and sauces. There is also a large selection of draft brews. We enjoyed the food – the cornbread was some of the best we’ve had – and the portion was large – no one-inch square here.\n\nTip: On Saturdays after 6 PM, there is a special where the chef tries out a new menu option – it was Rueben Sliders on the day we visited.\n\nAddress: 1001 S. Main, Englewood, Ohio 45322\n\nHours: Mon-Sat: 11 AM – 10 PM, Sun: Noon – 8 PM\n\nDayton Aviation Heritage – Day 2 Itinerary\n\n9 AM-1:15 PM National Museum of the United States Air Force\n\nThis place is enormous – the world's largest military aviation museum!\n\nIt was a required Wilbear Wright stop – the stamp is at the information desk.\n\nThere is also a Wilbear stamp at the National Aviation Hall of Fame inside the Museum. Note that the Hall of Fame has different hours than the rest of the Museum. The museum is located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\n\nCurrently, there are four hangers of displays to work your way through. (Apparently, the current goal is to construct two more!) The first hanger covers the Early Years and World War II and has the most information to read. We covered hanger one very thoroughly in roughly 2 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nSince we wanted to make it home at a decent hour and had other stops to visit, we did the remaining hangers in less detail. Hanger 2 covers the Korean War and the Southeast Asia War (Vietnam).\n\nYou will find Cold War information in Hanger 3 and Presidential, Global Reach, Space, and Research & Development in Hanger 4. Hanger 4 has the most planes that you can walk through. If you don’t like confined space, you will probably want to skip the walk-throughs.\n\nThere is also a Missile Gallery between buildings 3 and 4 and a Holocaust Exhibit in a hallway between buildings 1 and 2.\n\nLike many museums, there is a store, theatre, café, and lockers.\n\nTip: Don’t try to visit this place in one day – there is too much to see. Maybe break up your trip by spending a few hours and then return for a few more the next day.\n\nAddress: 1100 Spaatz St., Dayton, OH 45433\n\nHours: Daily, 9 AM to 5 PM\n\nCost: Free\n\n1:20 PM-1:40 PM Wright Brothers Memorial / Huffman Prairie Flying Field Interpretive Center\n\nOur last stop on the Wilbear Wright mission was the Huffman Prairie Interpretive Center! You can turn in your stamp flyer at this location and receive your Wilbear!\n\nThe Huffman Prairie Flying Field & Interpretive Center is the birthplace of the world's first practical airplane, developed and tested by Orville and Wilbur Wright.\n\nThis iconic site not only commemorates the lives and accomplishments of these renowned aviators but also serves as a memorial dedicated to their extraordinary contributions to the field of aviation.\n\nBy visiting the flying field, you have the unique opportunity to witness the exact location where the Wright brothers made monumental history, allowing them to truly comprehend the magnitude of their groundbreaking work in the realm of flight.\n\nThe interpretive center provides an educational and immersive experience, offering in-depth insights into the innovative processes and techniques that Orville and Wilbur Wright employed during their time at Huffman Prairie.\n\nThrough informative exhibits and displays, you can delve into the intricacies of the Wright brothers' aeronautical experiments, gaining an understanding of the obstacles they faced and the remarkable solutions they devised.\n\nUltimately, the Huffman Prairie Flying Field & Interpretive Center remains an invaluable site for all aviation enthusiasts and history buffs, serving as a tangible testament to the incredible legacy Orville and Wilbur Wright left behind.\n\nThe memorial lists the names of the pilots who trained at Huffman Prairie. It’s a great place to get a photo taken with your Wilbear!\n\nAddress: 2380 Memorial Road, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433\n\nHours: Wednesday – Sunday, 9 AM to 4 PM\n\nCost: Free\n\nCollecting the eight stamps is doable in two days, but if you are feeling adventurous, check out the remaining nine sites to learn more about the home of aviation!\n\nOther aviation sites listed on the Wilbear flyer include the following:\n\nWright State University\n\nThe university is named for Wilbur and Orville Wright.\n\nThe Wright Brothers Collection at the Wright State University Wright Archives is considered to be “one of the most complete collections of Wright material in the world.”\n\nThe University Wright Archives has many photos, awards, and other materials on display, in addition to the Wright Brothers Collection.\n\nThere is a full-scale replica of the 1903 Flyer that the Wrights developed on display in the library atrium at Wright State University.\n\nWright State University also holds a large collection of Dunbar material and historical information about the Miami Valley region in which it is located, in addition to the Wright Brothers Collection.\n\nAddress: 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway, Dayton, OH 45435\n\nHours: vary; please refer to WSU website for current hours.\n\nCost: Free\n\nHawthorn Hill\n\nHawthorn Hill stands proudly as Orville Wright's magnificent mansion, symbolizing his remarkable achievements in aviation.
