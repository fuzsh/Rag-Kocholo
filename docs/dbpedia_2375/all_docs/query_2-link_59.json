        "text": "We will be leaving Bucyrus Wal-Mart at 8:00am. Arriving at the Carillon Park at 10:30. First we will tour the Heritage Center of Dayton Manufacturing & Entrepreneurship with the Amazing Cash Registers. The focus of the Heritage Center rests on five main individuals: John H. Patterson, Orville & Wilbur Wright, Charles F. Kettering, and Colonel Edward A. Deeds.\n\nThen we will tour the Carillon Brewery Company. Carillon Brewing Co. offers visitors a glimpse into 1850s-era Dayton through the authentically prepared food and drink of the times. It is the nation’s only production brewery in a museum, and the only U.S. brewery replicating the historic brewing process.\n\nWe will be treated to Lunch by the Carillon Brewery Company Staff.\n\nAfter Lunch, we will do the outside portion of the park.\n\nPlan to Leave the park at 4:30 and arrive home at\n\nThe Early Settlement area consisting of Newcom Tavern (Dayton’s oldest standing building, ca. 1796), the William Morris House (ca. 1815), the Hetzel Summer Kitchen (1817), Newcom House (ca. 1841), the Watervliet Shaker Building (ca. 1819), and Locust Grove School No. 12 (1896), Carillon Historical Park’s Early Settlement Area recalls the early days of Dayton—a city that would grow and evolve to eventually change the world.\n\nThe John W. Berry, Sr. Wright Brothers National Museum has more Wright artifacts on display than any other place in the world, including the 1905 Wright Flyer III: the only airplane designated a National Historic Landmark, the first practical flying machine, and what the Wright brothers considered their most important aircraft.\n\nReferred to as “the first pilot’s last project,” preserving the 1905 Wright Flyer III for Carillon Historical Park was Orville Wright’s last major project before he died on January 30, 1948. And while Orville died before Carillon Park was opened in 1950, he had a hand in designing Wright Hall—the building that houses the 1905 Wright Flyer III.\n\nAdjacent to Wright Hall is—a replica of Wilbur and Orville’s fifth and final store at 1127 W. Third St. in West Dayton. In 1936, with Orville’s endorsement, Henry Ford purchased the original building, and in 1938, it was moved from 1127 W. Third Street and dedicated at Greenfield Village at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. Carillon Park’s cycle shop resembles how the Wright brothers’ store would have appeared between mid-October to mid-December 1901.\n\nThe Carillon Historical Park Print Shop is the nation’s only fully operational 1930s letterpress job shop in a museum. With authentic 1930s printing equipment and furnishings, the Print Shop harkens to a time when Dayton had 77 printing companies, ranging from one-person operations to McCall’s, which produced 4 million magazines daily, including Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report, Reader’s Digest, Redbook, and Popular Science.\n\nBy 1937, printing was the second largest industry in the United States. Due to the abundant water supply available, Dayton was heavily involved in the printing industry. In fact, as it was more cost-effective to print near the location of the paper mills, 25 of Ohio’s 36 paper mills were located right here in the Miami Valley.\n\nThe James F. Dicke Family Transportation Center houses the 1835 B&O #1, John Quincy Adams (the oldest existing American-built locomotive), a breathtaking Barney & Smith parlor railcar, an authentic Conestoga wagon, and many other exceptional transportation-themed artifacts.\n\nMany chapters of transportation history are celebrated at Carillon Historical Park’s James F. Dicke Family Transportation Center—from our nation’s rail history to Ohio’s pioneer history to Dayton’s unique spot in claiming the oldest, continuously-operating, electrically-propelled public transit system. Designed to resemble both a train station and a roundhouse, the Transportation Center houses many of Carillon Historical Park’s original artifacts, and guests are welcome to walk through many of the artifacts on display.\n\nThe Great 1913 Flood Exhibit speaks to disaster, perseverance, and heroism. By bringing together numerous Flood-related artifacts, it tells the story of a grief-stricken city banding together to rise above adversity.\n\nThe History on the Hill Interpretive Center tells the story of the land on which Carillon Historical Park sits—its geological history, its settlement by the prehistoric Hopewell people, and its use as a segment of the Miami and Erie Canal. Featuring a number of exhilarating tunnel slides and the Archeology Adventure Zone, History on the Hill has become a popular spot for guests of all ages.\n\nComplete with picturesque walking trails, wild flowers, idyllic shelters, historical artifacts, geological remnants, and a breathtaking bird’s eye view of Carillon Historical Park and the city of Dayton, the Moraine Trails are the Park’s best-kept-secret."
