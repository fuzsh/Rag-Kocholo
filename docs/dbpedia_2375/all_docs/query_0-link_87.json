        "text": "The Dayton area has a long history its residents can be proud of. It is home to a large number of museums and unique historical venues. Below are just a few examples of where residents can go to learn about our past.\n\nNational Museum of the United States Air Force\n\nThe National Museum of the United States Air Force is home to the oldest and largest military aviation museum in the world. Its collection displays the Air Force's history and traditions, and is located at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\n\nWoodland Cemetery and Arboretum\n\nWoodland Cemetery is one of the country's oldest garden cemeteries. It was founded in 1841 and contains over 3,000 trees - many over a century old. Tours around the cemetery allow visitors to see the famous grave sites of Orville and Wilbur Wright, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Charles Kettering, and many others.\n\nCarillon Historical Park\n\nCarillon Historical Park is a 65-acre park and museum which contains exhibits and historic buildings on its premises. Its theaters, trains, and living historical experiences help to bring Dayton's history to life.\n\nVictoria Theatre\n\nThe Victoria Theatre is a 150 year-old, historic theater that has been continually operated since its founding in 1866 - despite floods and fires. Plays, movies, and musicals are all still regularly shown at the Victoria today."
