Carillon Historical Park is a hidden gem just 5 minutes from downtown Dayton.\n\nThings To Do In Dayton: Carillon Historical Park\n\nCarillon Historical Park is located on 65 acres and offers a unique glimpse into Dayton’s contributions to modern-day life. Our visit on a quiet but hot Saturday in July was a lovely surprise, perfect for families, nature lovers, and history enthusiasts alike.\n\nCarillon Historical Park: Fun\n\nOne of the highlights for our group was the beautiful carousel, made from various icons in Dayton history; you can jump on and ride a bag of Mikesell’s chips, Esther Price Chocolates, or a more traditional horse. The kids couldn’t get enough, riding it an impressive 7 times in a row and 14 times throughout the day. The ride band was definitely worth the money, providing endless dizzying entertainment.\n\nThe park features a working steam train that takes you on a journey around the grounds while providing audio commentary. It’s a ride that both kids and adults enjoyed; although we only rode it once, we could have chosen to ride it multiple times with the ride band.\n\nCarillon Historical Park: Education\n\nNature lovers will appreciate the park’s wildlife. During our visit, we were fortunate to view a young eagle perched in a tree, with a parent soaring gracefully above.\n\nThe transportation exhibits at Carillon Historical Park are impressive, and even after viewing the website prior to our trip, I had no idea just how expansive the exhibits were. We explored an original lock of the Miami and Erie Canal and saw the oldest US-built locomotive in existence – the John Quincy Adams steam locomotive, which dates back to 1835. The collection includes a variety of vehicles, from wagons to trolley buses to train carriages that once served Dayton’s transit system. One of Dayton’s biggest claims to history is, of course, being the home to the Wright brothers; you can view the Wright Flyer III plane at this historical park in Dayton.\n\nCarrillon Historical Park has large inside sections that cover inventions and industry. Highlights include revolutionary inventions like the Liberty aircraft engine and the early Frigidaire refrigerator.\n\nWe recommend Carillon Park\n\nIf you’re searching for things to do in Dayton that combine education with enjoyment, Carillon Historical Park should be at the top of your list. Whether you’re a visitor or a local looking to rediscover your city’s heritage, this park offers a great experience celebrating Dayton’s past and present. Our group, which included kids aged 11 to 13 and adults, thoroughly enjoyed everything Carillon Historical Park had to offer."
