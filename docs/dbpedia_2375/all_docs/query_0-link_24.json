As a privately funded non-profit museum, we rely on the generosity of our members, donors, and attendance to help us achieve our mission to inspire generations by connecting them with the unique people, places, and events that changed Dayton and the world. By verifying each membership with a photo ID, Dayton History can protect our members from fraudulent uses if cards have been lost or stolen. We are taking this precaution so we can continue to provide affordable memberships to our guests and bring new exhibits and experiences to life. We hope to see you at the park soon!\n\n• Certified Service Animals and Animals in Training for Certification will be permitted to assist visitors with disabilities.
