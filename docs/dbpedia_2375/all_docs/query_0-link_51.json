(Links and contact information are shown in these descriptions).\n\nThe Aviation Trail Parachute Museum is located on the second floor of the Aviation Trail Visitor Center. The Museum tells the story of the development of the free fall parachute from its invention at Dayton’s McCook Field after World War I, up to the vital role it plays in safely landing today’s spacecraft.\n\n​\n\nThe time line around the soffit of the exhibit space highlights significant events in the history of the parachute. The Museum also includes interactive exhibits, artifacts, historic photographs and text. The museum maintains what is considered one of the most comprehensive private parachute collections in the world, with research materials permanently housed at Wright State University Libraries Special Collections and Archives.\n\nThe memorial is located at the top of Wright Brothers Hill, overlooking the Huffman Prairie Flying Field where Wilbur and Orville conducted tests of their early flying machines in 1904 and 1905 and where the Wright School of Aviation operated a flying school from 1910 to 1916. A plaque on the stone wall surrounding the plaza around the Memorial lists the names of the 119 pilots trained at Huffman Prairie.\n\nAmong the attractions at this unique, 65-acre outdoor museum is the original 1905 Wright Flyer III, the world's first practical airplane. The Flyer III, housed in Wright Hall, was restored under the personal direction of Orville Wright. Wright Hall is flanked by the Wilbur and Orville Wright Wings and is connected to a replica of the bicycle shop in which the Wright brothers built their 1903 airplane. These buildings comprise the John W. Berry, Sr. Wright Brothers National Museum at Carillon Historical Park, a privately owned and operated unit of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park.\n\nThe world's largest military aviation museum features more than 360 aerospace vehicles and missiles from the beginnings of military flight to today's stealth technology. Thousands of personal artifacts, photographs and documents further highlight the people and events that comprise the Air Force storyline. Tour the 19 acres of indoor exhibit space and see noteworthy aircraft such as the only permanent public exhibit of a B-2 stealth bomber, and the B-17F Memphis Belle™, one of the most recognizable symbols of World War II, and board the space shuttle exhibit and four of nine presidential aircraft. While at the museum you can ride a flight simulator, enjoy a 3D movie, eat in one of the two cafés, and shop in the museum store. Open 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. daily. Free admission and free parking.\n\nThe Hall of Fame is co-mingled with the National Museum of the United States Air Force (Site 5). The National Aviation Hall of Fame has been adding up to five inductees each year since 1962. The exhibits in the Learning and Research Center tell the story of the history of American aviation with the emphasis on the aviation pioneers who made major contributions to its development. The Harry B. Combs Research Center includes a wall with the portraits of each of the enshrinees, as well as interactive access to information about each of the individuals. Other attractions include interactive exhibits and displays organized around the theme of notable eras in the history of aviation in the United States.\n\nWilbur and Orville Wright, their parents Milton and Susan, and their sister Katharine are buried in the Wright family lot in Section 101. Their friend, poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, and his mother Matilda, are buried nearby in the same section. Lorin Wright, brother to Wilbur and Orville, and his family are also located at Woodland in Section 122 in a lot near the pond. The Lookout, the highest natural point in the city, provides a panoramic view of downtown Dayton. Download our mobile app for self-guided tours and maps showing the locations of the graves of prominent Daytonians.\n\nWright State University, named for Wilbur and Orville Wright, is home to the world's largest Wright brothers' manuscript collection. Housed in Special Collections and Archives, it includes the Wrights' own technical and personal library, family papers, letters, diaries, financial records, genealogical files, awards, certificates, medals, albums, recordings, and technical drawings, as well as over 4,000 photographs documenting the invention of the airplane and the lives of the Wright Family. The Archives also holds over 400 additional aviation history collections. A full scale replica of the Wrights' 1903 Flyer hangs in the library atrium and selected items from the collections are on exhibit in the Archives' Reading Room.\n\nThe WACO airfield is a working airfield reminiscent of the grass airfields of the 1930s and 1940s, the approximate era (mid-1920s to World War II) during which the airplanes built at the WACO factory in Troy dominated the civilian airplane market. The WACO Airplane Museum includes aircraft, artifacts, historic photographs and other exhibits related to the WACO Aircraft Company and the aircraft it produced. In addition to the museum, the airfield buildings also house a Learning Center, vintage aircraft restoration area, reference library and gift shop. Also, one section of the airfield is available for radio-controlled model airplane flying throughout the year.\n\nOpened on July 20, 1972, the Armstrong Air & Space Museum chronicles Ohio's contributions to the history of aeronautics and spaceflight. Located in the historic hometown of Neil Armstrong, the first person to step foot on the Moon, the museum is also home to a number of world-class artifacts including the original Gemini VIII spacecraft, two of Armstrong's NASA spacesuits, and an Apollo 11 Moon rock. Not a static museum, but features numerous interactive exhibits and other audio/visual elements. Be sure to check out the Astro-Theater, where visitors can watch a 25-minute documentary on the Apollo 11 Moon landing.\n\nWith a reputation as a center of excellence for the restoration and maintenance of World War II era aircraft, CAM honors our Veterans and their families while educating the public about the experiences of past generations that flew in combat. CAM offers visitors a rare, hands-on opportunity to learn about aviation history and to engage with Museum volunteers as they restore the B-17 Champaign Lady Flying Fortress. Additional aircraft at CAM include an operational B-25 Champaign Gal, F-24 Fairchild, Stinson 10A, and C-1A Mudflap Girl, and on static display a C-47 Skytrain, A-26 Invader, and Beechcraft Model 18.\n\nLocated at Grimes Field in Urbana, the \"lab\" is a Beech 18 that served the U.S. Air Forces as a C-45 and was modified to a C-45H as a test bed for aircraft nighttime lighting systems. The aircraft was a valuable tool for engineers who worked for Warren G. Grimes - the father of aircraft lighting - before and during World War II to advance developments for safer flight at night. Grimes produced his first airplane lights in his garage in 1933 and by World War II his company had grown to produce lighting for military aviation. Besides memorabilia from Grimes' life and Grimes Manufacturing Co., historical and modern aircraft lighting products are displayed.\n\nA historic aviation museum dedicated to remembering those who fought for our freedom, and honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nThe Tri-State Warbird Museum was formed in 2003 and opened to the public in 2004 with a commitment to preserve the aircraft of World War II, educate visitors on America’s role in WWII, and to honor the veterans who fought and whose who made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nSince Museum’s 24,000 sq. foot. hangar and 5,000 sq. foot. museum display space at the Clermont County Airport has opened over 1.5 million people have toured the facility and/or seen the restored aircraft gracing the skies at airshows around the country.\n\nContinuing to grow, the Tri-State Warbird Museum aircraft collection now consists of nine significant WWII aircraft with additional acquisitions planned for the future. The Museum seeks to play a significant role in educating local youth about American history.\n\nButler County Warbirds Inc., a not-for-profit corporation, was formed for the purpose of educating and entertaining individuals of all ages on the historical importance of aviation while America was at war, and to celebrate our heroes through the preservation of their aircraft and memorabilia as we share their stories.\n\nWe're located at the Middletown Regional Airport.
