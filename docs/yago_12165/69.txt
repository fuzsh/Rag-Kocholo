Essentially known for having created the Kirikou character and directed the three films whose intrepid little African is the star, Michel Ocelot has many more strings to his bow. In the 1970s, he began the production of several animated series, as well as short films cut out or shadows that augur his Princes and Princesses and other Tales of the night, and who participate greatly in the affirmation of a distinct style. As a goldsmith, he orchestrates his films with extreme precision and care given to the details of the sets and the symbolism of his stories - often borrowed from stories and legends from around the world - and his staging, which go against many facilities. In 2018, twelve years after Azur and Asmar, the release of his new feature, Dilili in Paris, is an event, and a great opportunity to take stock of a career exceptional, a vector of considerable growth in French animation cinema.
