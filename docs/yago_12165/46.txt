Michel Ocelot made Princes et Princesses in 1999, after the success of his first feature film Kirikou and the Sorceress (1998).

An ode to cinema and to love, Princes et Princesses will conquer everybody’s hearts. Be seduced by the visual and auditory charm of these tales brimming with magic and humanity, brought to life using paper cut-outs and the Chinese shadow theatre technique.

In Michel Ocelot’s film we are whisked away to see both the world and an imaginary land.

Six shadow theatre tales... Two creative and curious children find themselves in an abandoned cinema. With the help of an old technician, they invent and live out stories where they are the heroes.
