        "text": "As a child in grade school, I remember a Danish fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen called \"The Princess on the Pea\" about a prince’s seemingly unsuccessful search for a princess. One stormy night, a woman who claims to be a princess requests shelter from the elements. In an experiment, the prince’s mother decides to test the unexpected guest: she places a single pea in the bed, covered by huge mattresses and 20 featherbeds. The next morning, the young woman states that she endured a sleepless night for she was kept awake by something hard in the bed. Only a real princess would have the sensitivity to feel a pea through such a quantity of bedding! The prince rejoices because the woman has passed the test, proving that she is in fact a princess. The two are married and everybody lives happily ever after.\n\nI am currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Missouri, pursuing a PhD in music education. Prior to enrolling at Mizzou, I taught music in the public school system: three years teaching general music for grades K-8, and three years teaching choir for grades 9-12. My decision to pursue a terminal degree was largely based on the injustices and inequities I witnessed during those years like racial discrimination, student antagonization, or harsh punishments as opposed to restorative consequences.\n\nThis treatment is not only prevalent by adults towards children; as an adult Black male, I experience microagressions in my daily life. For example, often I am told my eloquence is a surprise, or there is visible shock when folks realize that I am knowledgeable about musical styles outside of hip-hop or gospel genres. When I reflect on the best approach to address quotidian incidents like this, or the larger-scale systemic problems of racism, I find that a straightforward, yet subtle approach is most efficacious, similar to “The Princess and the Pea.”\n\nThis childhood story has stayed on my mind for years. As I am older and with a little more life experience, I offer this tale as a metaphor for approaches to progress for how we might go about affecting change. I would like to alter the story a bit with a more current lens. The pea represents the work that we have to do; the princess represents the system or the people that operate the system.\n\nIn the fairytale, the small pea did not allow the princess to have a good night's sleep; she was so uncomfortable on account of the tiny object buried deep in the bedding. Like any true millennial, the princess gets off her many layers, which should have brought comfort, to search for the cause of her discomfort and remove it. To me, this is what diversity, equity, inclusion and race relations work is now. We want to make changes — incremental and massive — in such a way that the mainstream society has to get off their comfortable beds and discover what it is that is making them uneasy. I believe this could bring about the sustainable change we want.\n\nHowever, many of us choose to flip the princess off of her many mattresses. The result is the princess is discombobulated and offended, and probably too upset to listen to why she was tossed out of her sleep. Indeed, in the eager quest for change or to make a difference, we use this approach all too often. The outcome is confusion and misunderstanding, followed by no changes being made; and we are back where we started.\n\nI am by no means “tone policing,” suggesting that change efforts should be watered down, or trying to assimilate into respectability politics. I am saying that the movement must be strategic: it’s a game of chess, not checkers. I believe change happens and is maintained when the folks from the dominant group act of their own volition. In most institutional contexts, the people who make important decisions are often unaffected by them. However, when it involves them the outcomes are very different. And that is my job: making people uncomfortable — not enough to be offensive, but enough to make them change their position; enough so that they want to explore their discomfort. It is a delicate balance to toe such a line. It is a skill to which we all must become accustomed.\n\nThe world in which we live is in dire need of change: systemic racism runs rampant, many leaders are in denial. How did we get here? And more importantly, how do we get out? As Malcolm X so expressively implored in his speech at the founding rally of the Organization of Afro-American Unity on June 28, 1964, “&mldr;by any means necessary.” This statement is often used in defense of more “active” ways of enacting change. But what if being present yet tempered is a way to achieve what we want: is that not within the realm of “any means?” In the words of the swan song of Coalhouse in \"Ragtime: The Musical\" — “Make them hear you!”\n\nTo obtain a sustainable objective, we must give the princess cause to jump down from her comfortable platform and find the source of her discomfort — and then, of course, ultimately work to remove it.\n\nG.
