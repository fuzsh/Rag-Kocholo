        "text": "New York, NY (December 10, 2010)\n\nOn Saturday January 9, children and their families are invited to spend a fun-filled day of art making at the Museum of Arts and Design. MAD opens its doors with activities designed especially for youngsters and their adult companions, including hands-on workshops using paper cutting, shredding, and tearing techniques.\n\n• A special highlight of the day includes the screenings of four cut-paper animation films including: Michel Ocelot’s silhouette story Princes and Princesses; Rob Carter’s\n\nMetropolis, and Tomoko Oguchi’s FolkLore Restaurant and The Magic Stamp.\n\n• Children and their families will spend a day making art, meeting artists in the Open Studios and explore what can be done with paper while observing the Museum’s exhibition Slash: Paper Under The Knife, which features over 50 artworks created from cut, burned, torn, perforated, or shredded paper.\n\n“Education is at the center of the Museum’s mission”, states Holly Hotchner, the Museum’s Nanette L. Laitman Director. “Simultaneously an artist studio, art room, and creative playground, MAD offers countless opportunities for kids to play, learn and explore. By presenting a special Family Day at the Museum where kids and their families make art together, explore the galleries and watch fun cut-paper animation films, we wish to bring art closer to young people securing an understanding and appreciation for the arts and the creative process.”\n\nThe Museum’s dynamic new facility offers numerous programs for families including its Open Studios where artists demonstrate how to work with jewelry, textiles, wood,\n\nceramics, and other materials. Every Sunday afternoon, the Museum presents its popular Studio Sundays, hands-on workshops for children and their families that focus on the physicality of “making” and the sensual and tactile qualities of materials. The workshops include introductions to various mixed media—clay, metal, fiber, wood, glass, paper, rubber, etc.—and related studio activities transforming ideas into art objects. Designed especially for younger visitors, MAD’s early childhood education programs promote creativity, self-expression, and exploration while teaching pre-literacy skills and fine motor control.\n\nFor more information on MAD’s Family Day, see schedule below.\n\nMAD FAMILY DAY SCHEDULE:\n\nSaturday, January 9, 11:00AM-2:00pm\n\nAll ages 5 and up welcome.
