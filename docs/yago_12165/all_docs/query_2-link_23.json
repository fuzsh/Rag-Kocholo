        "text": "This unique book examines the career of Michel Ocelot, from his earliest works to his latest research and productions, including an interview regarding his latest film Le Pharaon, le Sauvage et la Princesse (2022). The book highlights the director’s role in the panorama of contemporary animated cinema and his relationship with the tradition, both artistic and cinematographic.\n\nThe book carefully analyses the ethical and social nature of Ocelot’s work to underscore the duality of the director’s oeuvre, both artistic and social, using an interdisciplinary approach that blends film and aesthetic criticism with gender studies and decolonial thought. Particular attention will be given to the themes of multiculturalism, discrimination, and treatment of women, which are at the centre of many current cultural debates.\n\nThe book will be of interest to an audience of experts, animation enthusiasts, and film scholars, as well as to a wider readership interested in learning about the poetics of Kirikou’s father.\n\nBiography\n\nLaura Buono holds a Master’s degree in Visual Arts from Alma Mater Studiorum – Università di Bologna and completed a postgraduate course in Critical Theory of Society at the University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy.
