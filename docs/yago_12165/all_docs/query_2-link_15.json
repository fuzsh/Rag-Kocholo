        "text": "The winner of the British Film Academy Award and the prestigious French Cesar, and Animafest's two times best animated film winner, for The Three Inventors (Les Trois Inventeurs) in 1980 and Azur & Asmar (Azur et Asmar) in 2007, is the winner of this year's Lifetime Achievement Award, which will be handed to him at Animafest's opening ceremony (9 June) .\n\nThe Animafest Zagreb Council, which reached the decision on the award, described Michel Ocelot as a 'poet of animation and an explorer of the medium' who masterfully combines the artistic, folklore and mythological tradition of Europe and other continents with the imagery and art of the newer period, creating an idiosyncratic blend recognised across the animation world.\n\nMichel Ocelot (1943) is a French writer, caricaturist, animator and animation director, who re-invented silhouette animation. He is a former president of the International Animated Film Association and a winner of the British Film Academy Award and César.\n\nHis most famous work also includes feature films Kirikou and the Sorceress (Kirikou et la sorcière), Princes and Princesses (Princes et princesses), Kirikou and the Wild Beast (Kirikou et les bêtes sauvages), while his notable short works include Four Wishes of a Villain and His Wife (Les quatrevoeux du villain et de sa femme) and The Legend of the Poor Hunchback (La légende du pauvrebossu).\n\nTales of the Night, 2012\n\nAt this year's festival edition, the audience will get a chance to see his more recent titles."
