        "text": "Ocelot is of course widely known for his debut feature Kirikou and the Sorceress, but his second one is equally wonderful. In this episodic animated fantasy, two creative and curious children meet every evening in an abandoned shadow theatre. With the help of an old technician, they dress up, imagine and live the tales in which they play the leading roles. The film was created using a special style of cut-out animation, with black silhouetted characters performing the action against backlit backdrops in striking colours."
