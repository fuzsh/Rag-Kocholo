        "text": "In a land far far away there was a glorious kingdom. In the kingdom stood a great castle. And inside the castle lived a handsome Prince.\n\nThe Prince was sad.\n\nHe longed for a true Princess to share his castle and kingdom, but he couldn't find one.\n\nThis was not because there was a lack of Princesses. In fact, the kingdom was full of fair maidens all claiming to be Princesses.\n\nThe Prince scoured the kingdom, meeting every one of these so-called Princesses. But he returned sad and empty handed.\n\n“It is impossible to tell whether these are true Princesses!” he said to his Father, the King.\n\n“You must be patient my son. You will know when you know” said the King, with a knowing smile.\n\nThe Prince smiled back, then went to his chamber.\n\nThat evening a huge storm came.\n\nThunder clapped. Lightning flashed. And the rain clattered down on the castle roof like the sound of a thousand horses charging into battle.\n\nSuddenly, came a loud knock at the castle door. The King put on his robe and opened the door to find a cold, soggy young lady standing in front of him.\n\n“I am a true Princess,” she said, “Please can I have some dry clothes and a bed for the night?”\n\nThe King let her in.\n\n“She says she is a true Princess,” said the King to the old Queen-mother.\n\nThe Queen-mother didn’t say a word.\n\nInstead, she thought to herself, “We’ll soon see about that”. She then handed the Princess a nightgown and said, “put this on while I prepare your chamber.”\n\nThe Queen-mother began preparing the chamber—but in a very peculiar way.\n\nFirst, she took the covers, sheets and mattress off the bed.\n\nThen she placed a single garden pea on the bedstead.\n\nAnd then she laid twenty mattresses on top of the pea taking care to separate each layer with a soft eiderdown quilt.\n\nAfter this she replaced the bedclothes on the top mattress and said to the Princess, “Your chamber is ready!”\n\nThe bed was now so high off the ground that the Princess needed to climb a ladder to get into the bed. So the Princess climbed up the ladder, got under the covers and blew out her candle.\n\nAt breakfast the next morning the Queen-mother turned to the Princess and asked, “My dear Princess, how did you sleep?”\n\n“Oh, not at all well,” said the Princess. “I mean to say, I am extremely grateful for your kindness in putting me up for the night, but there seemed to be something ever so hard and uncomfortable under my mattress. I didn’t sleep a wink.”\n\n“My my!” replied the Queen-mother, “is that so?”\n\nThe Queen-mother turned to the Prince and said, “I believe we have found your true Princess, for none but a true Princess possesses such a delicate sense to feel a single pea through twenty mattresses and twenty of my finest quilts. You must wed immediately!”\n\nThe Prince was overjoyed.\n\nHe turned to the Princess and said, “Dear Princess, would you do me the great honour of becoming my wife?”\n\nShe blushed, then taking a moment to finish a mouthful of cereal, said, “On one condition.”\n\n“Anything!” replied the Prince.\n\nShe looked at the Prince with a cheeky grin and said, “That you promise, dear Prince, that from this day forward any pea that should enter this castle is simply for eating. And not for sleeping upon.”\n\nThe Prince looked back at her, chuckled and said, “I promise!”\n\nThe End"
