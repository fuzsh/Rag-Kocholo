        "text": "It is said that somewhere, there is a field where sparkling diamonds can be found amidst the grass, and in a gazebo lies an enchanted princess, frozen like a statue and guarded by a dragon. If one desires to free the princess from this curse, they would have to find all one-hundred and eleven of the diamonds of her broken necklace. Many princes have attempted this impossible task, but all have disappeared without a trace…\n\nAn original story by Michel Ocelot. There once lived a young Egyptian man whose sole possession was a fig tree — in summer it bore him fruit; in winter it was his home. But one morning, he is astounded to find the tree bearing fruit in the middle of winter! Humbled by this miracle, he presents the ripest of these figs to the queen of Egypt, who rewards his generosity with her own — an exchange which drives the palace intendant mad with jealousy. But though he easily deceives both the queen and the honest young man, sometimes even undiscovered deception can have its own punishment…\n\nBased on an ancient Egyptian tale. In the year 3000 there lives a powerful and pitiless queen who so detests the men that seek to posses her that subjects these suitors to an unwinnable trial — to remain undetected by the the powers of her mega-radar for a day or else be disintegrated. That is, until the trainer of a strange whistling creature takes up the challenge of evading the radar. Could it be that queen is not really cruel, and that her anger only stems from her loneliness?\n\nAn original story by Michel Ocelot. There was once a medieval king, whose kingdom was threatened by the presence of a powerful sorceress. Failing to rid the people of this fear himself, he issues forth a challenge: that whosoever can infiltrate the sorceress' fortress shall win the hand of his daughter in marriage. The princess, renowned for her beauty, attracts the attention of many a nobleman. But no matter how ingenious their attack, however much firepower they use, the impregnable castle lives up to its name. So how can a simple, unarmed boy succeed where whole armies have failed?\n\nAn original story by Michel Ocelot. In an elegant garden, a handsome young prince cajoles his newly engaged fiancé, a beautiful young princess, into proclaiming their love for each other with a kiss. Now, we all know the story of what happened when a frog was kissed by a princess — so what what would happen if a princess were to kiss someone who is already a prince?\n\nAn original story by Michel Ocelot."
