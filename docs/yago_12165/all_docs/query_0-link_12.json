        "text": "A sophisticated and evocative animation fairytale inspired by the technique of shadow puppetry. Costumes, drawings, magic spells from far-away countries, and two kids with loads of imagination. In six different stories they will travel through time and space – from Ancient Egypt to the Middle Ages, referencing Japanese art as well as the most traditional of fairytales – the princess kissing the toad – here turned upside-down in a comically absurd situation. Author of the much-loved Kirikù, della fiaba di Azur e Asmar,Dililì in Paris andLe Pharaon, le Sauvage et la Princesse, withPrinces and Princesses Ocelot Ocelot has created a timeless work: the reference to the fairy tale and its archetypal characters declined in different cultural meanings, the choice of the silhouette that, like a shadow, conceals the physiognomic details of the protagonists and at the same time recalls an art, that of the shadow theatre, whose origins are lost in tales and documents thousands of years old, all contribute to confer universality to the film.\n\nSceneggiatura, scenografia / Screenplay, Art Director: Michel Ocelot\n\nMontaggio / Editing: Dominique Lefever, Michèle Peju, Anita Vilfrid\n\nMusica / Music: Christian Maire\n\nAnimazione / Animation: Michel Ocelot, Bénédicte Galup, Lionel Kerjean, Inni Karine Melbye, Richard Mithouard\n\nProduzione / Produced by: Les Armateurs, La Fabrique, Studio O, Gébéka Films\n\nCon la partecipazione di / With the participation of: Canal+, Centre National de la Cinématographie, La Fondation de France\n\nDistribuzione per l’Italia / Distributed in Italy by Cineteca di Bologna\n\nMichel Ocelot\n\nBorn on the French Riviera in 1943, Michel Ocelot spent his childhood in Guinea, grew up in the Loire valley and then settled in Paris. He has dedicated his entire career to film animation. In 1998, he became known to the general public thanks to the success of his first feature film Kirikou and the Sorceress. Since the beginning, all his works have been based on his own scripts and graphics. In 2009 he was made a Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur. In 2015 he got the Lifetime Achievement Award at the World Festival of Animated Film – Animafest Zagreb."
