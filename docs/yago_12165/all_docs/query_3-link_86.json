We can confirm that there is a before and after Jennifer Lee in the way that women creators are perceived in our industry. Therefore, Annecy would like to highlight her remarkable contribution.”\n\nWriter/director Ocelot whose credits range from Kirikou to Dilili in Paris, will receive the Honorary Cristal during the screening of his latest film Le Pharaon, le Sauvage et la Princesse on June 14.\n\nSaid Jean, “By creating the character Kirikou in 1998, Michel Ocelot gave the impetus needed to launch the animation feature film industry in France. Today it’s an entire community of animation filmmakers, producers and artists who are indebted to him. By honoring him today, the Festival acknowledges the role he played in the actual development of Annecy.”\n\nBest of The Hollywood Reporter\n\nLena Dunham on Her First Film in a Decade, Youthful Blind Spots and Hope to Reboot 'Girls'\n\nWhat Ridley Scott Has Learned: \"We Don’t Know S***\"\n\nLady Gaga on Mining Personal Pain for 'House of Gucci'"
