Oslo: It&#39;s difficult to reach what I envisioned just by playing with the numbers, so in that case I decided to go back to the beginning and make it hand-painted.

        "text": "French anime film director\n\nMichel Ocelot 's latest work ' Dilili in Paris Time Trip ' will be released on Saturday, August 24, 2019. Director Oslo is a person who has sent out works such as 'Kirikou and the Witch' and 'Tales of the Night', which are the number one French movies in the box office history, and this work is set in France, the hometown for the first time. I made it.\n\nThis time, I had the opportunity to ask Oslo about the work in detail, so I asked him various questions about the production and the background he was particular about.\n\nMovie 'Dilili and Paris Time Trip' Official Site\n\nhttps://child-film.com/dilili/\n\nGIGAZINE (G):\n\nIn producing 'Dilili and Paris Time Trip', the director said, 'It's finally time to make a movie set in Paris.' Have you always thought about making a work set in Paris?\n\nDirector Michel Ocelot (hereinafter Oslo):\n\nI didn't think about it at all. Earlier, when Director Isao Takahata told me that I could only make Japanese movies in Japan, I realized that I could only make French movies in France. Of course, when I start thinking about a story, I don't really care about country or nationality. I think of myself as a world citizen and am of interest to me anywhere in the world. I'm like a child who loves sweets, so I feel like I can eat anything, so I pick up whatever I'm interested in and eat it.\n\nG:\n\nI see (laughs)\n\nOslo:\n\nThat's why I'm making works in various places around the world, such as Tibet, Japan, South Africa, Persia, and Lebanon, regardless of the country and place where the work is set. But France is also a very interesting country, isn't it? Besides, it was often said by everyone. 'After all, you have to shoot a movie in Paris.' That's why I finally decided to set the stage in Paris this time.\n\nG:\n\nYou said that the idea of the movie started with sets and costumes, but did you mean that it was assembled from the visual rather than the story?\n\nOslo:\n\nFirst of all, the issue I'm interested in right now is the global issue, which is about women or men who oppress girls. In fact, the number of women and girls dying for reasons other than war is much higher than the number of deaths in war. But just because I wanted to draw it in a movie didn't necessarily mean that I wanted to set it in Paris.\n\nG:\n\nThat led to the 'time trip between Diriri and Paris'.\n\nOslo:\n\nAs you said, I started with sets and costumes. I always do research before entering a movie, but as I researched the era called ' Belle Epoque ,' I realized that it was a great era. There were men who abused women and girls in this era, but I thought that civilization would be a contrasting countermeasure against the dark problem. What's interesting about Paris is that it's not just the people who live in Paris and the genuine Parisians, but also the talented people and geniuses from all over the world.\n\nG:\n\nJust by looking at the trailer, many celebrities such as Gustave Eiffel and Pablo Picasso have appeared.\n\nDillili and Paris Time Trip-YouTube\n\nOslo:\n\nso. Not limited to one field, excellent people of various genres, such as artists, scientists, and literary figures, gathered in Paris. Another interesting aspect of the Belle Epoque is that it was a time when women were finally beginning to claim their 'rights.' You have come to insist on 'living your own life.' At that time, there was no law to promote it.\n\nG:\n\nThat's right…….\n\nOslo:\n\nWith this trend, female university students were born for the first time in this era. It was also during this period that female taxi drivers, university professors, female doctors and female attorneys were born. The great female scientist Marie Curie was also born during this period. As a creator, I don't want to hurt people or make them uncomfortable. Just pushing the dark story forward will destroy the audience, so instead, in the form of counterpoint, it is an era when wonderfully talented women have begun to play an active role. I made it clear in 'Time Travel'. I'm glad I was able to draw such a story.\n\nG:\n\nSo that's it.\n\nOslo:\n\nFrance is not a closed country, but a very open country that accepts foreigners from all over the world. Foreigners naturally gather in Paris. Of course, Japanese people came, but there weren't many famous Japanese people in the Belle Epoque era. Tsuguharu Foujita, who later became a popular painter, was also a Japanese in the days of Bell Epoch, but when he was young, he dressed like a Frenchman and didn't feel the 'Japanese identity' (laughs). However, even if there were not many famous Japanese people, 'Japonisme' was extremely prosperous. In fact, this work also incorporates the famous Ukiyo-e as 'Japonisme'.\n\nG:\n\nI missed it ... where is it?\n\nOslo:\n\nOne is Hiroshige Utagawa's ' Hundred Views of Edo, Daihashi Atake no Yudachi ', and the other is Katsushika Hokusai. It's secretly put in, so please find it (laughs)\n\nG:\n\nYou can't take your eyes off the background. I would like to ask you about the background, but the background of this work is used by processing the photo. The director said, 'I can't think of reproducing it on a graphic palette because Paris is wonderful.' How did you decide to process the photo and use it as a background?\n\nOslo:\n\nFor example, a poor poet wrote a poem in Paris. It's not good if the poem gives Paris a worse image than it really is. I don't want to be such a bad poet. Of course, I myself try to talk about reality through my work, and some of them are abominable reality that abuses women and girls. However, the intention is not only to draw such a dark side, but also to draw a good side and a civilized side that fits the reality so that you will feel better when you look at it. As for Paris, 'I have a wonderful reality in front of me, so let's use it as a photograph without processing it.'\n\nG:\n\nI see, i see. Because reality is more beautiful than anything else.\n\nOslo:\n\nThat's it. There is a beautiful reality, so I take a picture of it and put it in a movie realistically. If you draw it as a graphic, the accuracy will be lower than in reality. The celebrities appearing in this work are all real people, and there are still pictures, so I was inspired by that and made them into characters. In the history of movies in the world, there aren't many movies with so many celebrities (laughs).\n\nG:\n\n(Laughs) In terms of the 'bright side,' the main character, Diriri, had a cute little gesture, which also contributed to the brightness of the work.\n\nOslo:\n\nThank you\n\nG:\n\nEarlier, the director said in an interview, 'I have nothing to be careful about when drawing children.' In this work, the message 'All the production staff of this movie thought of their daughters' was displayed on the end roll, but was there anything that you took in from familiar girls?\n\nOslo:\n\nI draw the original picture, but it is the animator's job to draw the gesture as a video, so if there is something that leads to the cuteness of the girls, it is thanks to the animator. There are great animators in the French anime industry, and there are also specialized schools. Especially since there are female animators, there may be some gestures that can be made because of the animations made by those women. The animators I worked with this time did more than I asked for, even if I didn't say 'Please do this', so this kind of work was completed. For example, the adorable gesture that Diriri shows in a scene where a picture of a ship and a picture of a ship are 'I cherish this' is a movement created by a female animator. The idea of a female animator is to 'take care' by tilting your head a little and tending to look down. What's more, I was surprised to be able to do it with the keyboard and PC screen instead of hand-drawing.\n\nG:\n\nRegarding Diriri, it is said that a cute movement was created by digital drawing. The director has a very long career, working from paper-cutting animation to hand-painting, and thus working on digital drawing works, but isn't it difficult to get used to it?\n\nOslo:\n\nNo, it wasn't difficult at all. I can't operate a PC like an animator myself, but I share the same language with the animators. However, although there are good points in terms of technology, there are also drawbacks, and those drawbacks are disappointing ...\n\nG:\n\nAre the drawbacks obvious to the audience?\n\nOslo:\n\nNo, it's a flaw on the part of human beings who handle technology, so it's something that the audience doesn't notice. And it's not the fault of others, but the fault of myself. For example, when shooting a paper cutout with a camera, if something goes wrong, you have to start from 0. It means that human beings who cannot be perfect from the beginning lack the skills to operate the equipment. Paper-cutting can be expressed very simply, but there is also an advanced technique of rotating the paper-cutting 360 degrees by making it a little more complicated. A 3D movie gives a three-dimensional effect, and you can freely create it with 3D software. But in terms of fun, the former was more fun.\n\nG:\n\n(Lol)\n\nOslo:\n\nWhether it's paper-cutting or drawing, I think it's an artist's work in the sense of 'doing it with your own hands.' However, when working on a PC, it looks like a bureaucrat rather than an artist (laughs), and 3D itself is expensive, isn't it? In my next work, I will go back to paper-cutting again. However, I'm thinking of paper-cutting that incorporates digital rather than completely manual work.\n\nG:\n\nYou are already thinking about the next one. Is it expensive for 3D animation because there are many work processes?\n\nOslo:\n\nIt's simply because it costs labor.
