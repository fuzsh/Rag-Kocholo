        "text": "Marvelous first short film from Michel Ocelot\n\nFollowing his work on the television series Gédéon, Michel Ocelot embarked on a new animation project. A twelve-minute short film entitled The Three Inventors.\n\nAn impressive story by this animator who reveals his pleasure in animating stories. All with white paper cutouts under colored backgrounds. An original story written by Ocelot and involving music from the composer Christian Maire.\n\nA story set in the seventeenth or eighteenth century, in a distant land, where a family of inventors (great inventor, great inventor and little inventor) live in a giant mansion that they have built themselves. In this area, the three members build inventions that they hope to present to the world. To help people in their daily life. And of these flying or terrestrial machines, the works are magnificent. Revolutionaries. A little too much.\n\nBecause unfortunately, the population reacts badly to this family and its constructions which they find bizarre, disturbing or blasphemous. Causing an upheaval of the population which the inventors did not expect. Leading to a dramatic situation.\n\nWith this short motion picture, Michel Ocelot wowed audiences with his thoroughness and the technical details of his animation while working alone, inside the home of Jean-François Laguionie, one of his favorite animators. Moreover, that the director was able to accomplish a movie on his own with limited means, without the help of assistants, or computers, is incredible. Considering that today, computers would have enabled him to do his work quick and to edit his images and animation effects more easily, Les 3 Inventeurs is a great lesson to the younger generations on the art of produce a short film without the technologies they take for granted today.\n\nAt the same time, Michel Ocelot tells in his movie what he would be about to do with his Cinesi series, Dragons and Princesses, and his films Princes and Princesses and Tales of The Night. Original stories or free adaptations of fairy tales with paper cutouts. As for the interest in making a cutout short movie, this was in response to critics who saw his show Gédéon and criticized him for animating it with paper cutouts, technique they found amateurish and mediocre. To their remarks, Michel Ocelot replied by making all this production with paper cutouts. And showing it in all shots. Nice way to prove how there is nothing to be ashamed of with this artistic medium and that with very simple objects you can produce something wonderful. Moreover, for certain sequences, the manual animation work is impressive since for certain moments, the inventors are in their machines and the cogs they use are detailed and complicated and should not be omitted in their movements. and photographs. Otherwise, the animation would be wasted and the plans disastrous.\n\nWithin the production team, Christian Maire worked on the music. Using a celesta, an instrument that is also called piano-bell, he immerses us in an atmosphere of 17th-18th century history. And from the first notes, the composer amazes us with his score. A grandiose music, which demonstrates the magic of the director’s stories, as well as their poetry. A feat that will still be present in all the productions in which he will participate, albeit with more resources than in The Three Inventors, which, despite everything, remains on a tight budget.\n\nMoreover, this is the beauty of this classic of French cinema. A call to creativity through simplicity, with ordinary objects (paper cut outs and paper towels) which together allow a presentation of the life lived by protagonists and antagonists in their parallel universe. Here, in a short twelve-minute film that amazes and moves us.\n\nBecause through this story, The Three Inventors is a call to open-mindedness and to denounce the ignorance employed by a society under the guise of policies, religions, and laws. A theme that will be present in his second short motion picture: The Legend of the Poor Hunchback. Still involving Christian Maire in the music. A magnificent film I will review shortly."
