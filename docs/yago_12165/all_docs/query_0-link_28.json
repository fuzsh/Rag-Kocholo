        "text": "“What if you were this?” “What if you were that?” – The two protagonists of the film\n\nImportant Note: This DVD is in Region 2, which means that North-American DVD players (Region 1) can not read it. Unless you have a multi-zone DVD or Blu-Ray player\n\nor, if you are installing on your computer or laptop, you can use free and legal software like the VLC program, which can play DVDs from all over the world. I have been using it for years and have found it very convenient since then.\n\nLong before Kirikou, Michel Ocelot had designed a TV series called Cinési. A series of animated episodes in silhouettes (paper cut, colored backgrounds, unusual objects) where every night, two children living in a city located in an anonymous country (France, Germany, United Kingdom, Canada, United States, etc.). ) gather in an old cinema where an inventor has installed a suite of machines, robots, and virtual reality. Worthy of those in “Jem and the Holograms”, these machines allow the three protagonists to create their own theatre shows for their own pleasure and that of a little duke perched in the room.\n\nOriginally, the series should have had more episodes. But in front of the poor TV audience ratings, the show lived on only through the episodes produced by Ocelot and his team of animators such as Bénédicte Galup; and stories like “Dancing Shepherdess”, “The Prince of the Jewels”, and “The Beautiful Girl and the Sorcerer” produced in 1993. Nevertheless, with the success of Kirikou, Michel Ocelot had the chance to give a new life to his episodes. In the form of a film called “Princes and Princesses” gathering six episodes, this work has achieved the same success as Kirikou, especially in Chicago where during a film festival, the adult and children’ juries gave their grand prizes to this film that I loved so much that I would have liked to see it take place over two hours.\n\nIn the end, these tales are an animated show that proves how silhouettes and cut paper can contain as much emotion as an animation drawn on acetates or made on the computer. And with the mini-sequences presenting the preparation of stories, we also discover how artists tell their stories. By consulting books, designing sets, costumes, etc., and making them.\n\nRegarding the stories, I loved all the tales. But I must say that I have a particular weakness for that of “The Cruel Queen and the Fabulo Breeder”. Freely inspired by Brothers Grimm’s “The Sea Hare”, this tale is little known because, according to Ocelot, it is very bad. From the original story, I can not say what is good or not. But in a deleted sequence offered in the DVD, the boy considered the final and the strategy of Grimm wobbly and unreliable; opinion implicitly expressing that of Michel. Nevertheless, the tool used in this tale will be a major influence on the fetish of Karaba as much as the wickedness of the Queen of Grimm will influence the antagonist of The Cruel Queen and the one in Kirikou. And in the end, this episode concludes in a final that has upset all the spectators. And probably, one of the best stories of Michel Ocelot.\n\nOn the other hand, more than the animation of Ocelot, it is essential to applaud the music of Christian Maire. Indeed, whether in “The Princess of Diamonds”, “The Boy of Figs” or “The Witch”, Maire’s musical instruments bewitch us, especially the Cello in the Sorceress’s castle. Which is beautiful and sad because I think that this composer is one of the greatest I have heard in a film where television and should have a greater presence before the eternal. Worthy of Angelo Badalementi, John Williams, Danny Elfman, and Georges Auric, his music should have been offered on CD or MP3 on ITunes.\n\nNevertheless, it is the success of this story that will motivate Ocelot to do his series “The Tales of the Night”, making there stories that he had originally planned for Cinési. Stories that confirm the art of its director to move us with a film that is a pure love letter for theatre plays. Writing quotes that viewers can memorize and repeat with as much ease as a professional actor would do himself.\n\nA theatre that we would like to see us too night after night. In front of our screen or on a stage."
