        "text": "The theme park Bonbon Land has a ride called Beaver Rafting that has a strong American wilderness/national parks theme with stuff like the Mount Rushmore heads replaced with the parks oldest mascots\n\nAnd the Niagara Falls\n\nBut at the entrance where you get on they have this statue of their owl mascot\n\nAnd it was during my last visit with my family I realized it’s a reference to this fucking thing\n\nThe Bohemian Grove owl that American politicians love and conspiracy nuts hate.\n\nThey might as well have made an All Seeing Eye reference but this is so much more obscure and feels like an easter egg just for people like me because most Danes aren’t going to know what the hell that is.\n\nMy favourite aspect of fandom by far is it’s ability to just take one look at any new piece of material and go “thanks, but no thanks”, and utterly ignore the brand new canon information.\n\nDon’t like a character? Easy, they never existed!\n\nNew movie/episode is trash? Don’t worry, it was a character’s fever dream the whole time!\n\nYour fav died? That was just a hallucination of their loved ones while they’re in the hospital, they’ll be fine!\n\nThe ability of fandom to completely rewrite material is utterly amazing. The collective willpower and spite we wield at all times.\n\nAnd on the flipside there is this mass effect of people choosing to rewrite material just because they don’t like it or want to do it “their way”, which, from a creator’s point of view, is absolutely terrifying.\n\nI keep seeing everybody talk about the “good” examples there of people dealing with crappy endings or bad episodes or characters “out of character”. But I rarely see people talk of the “bad” examples - the negative interpretations, the harmful rewrites, the offensive takes, people literaly telling creators “You have absolutely no influence and no decision-making over this character or world or story you created. They’re not yours. They’re ours. And we don’t care if you meant to say something, we will see what we want to see.”\n\n(The most recent example I can think of being the “Discworld books are anti-trans” take, but that’s a tiny water-drop compared to even more dangerous or repulsive stuff).\n\nSorry for hijacking the post, but it is something that haunts me and that I will always need to tell. And it is the reason why I hate fandoms. They literaly take what is not theirs and what they had no input into creating, and claim they are the makers of things and their word has more value.\n\nI am all for interpretation, reinterpretation, twists, and AUs and whatnot. But I do believe that some people lack the media awareness and artistic culture needed to just approach simple concepts such as “We are an audience criticizing a work. They are the creators of the work. We are not on the same level.”\n\nOnce I would have agreed that this sounds pedantic and arrogant. But I see how fandoms behave and act on the Internet, and how immature and baffling it all becomes (doesn’t help most of them are literal kids, the age of Internet users dropped terrifyingly), and I realize that, sadly, yes, a lot of the pedantic people had something right.\n\nSPECIFIC MOVIE RECOMMENDATIONS #1\n\n🌙✨ Gothic Fairy-Tale Films with Strong Female Leads ✨🌙\n\n🍒❤️‍🔥Hey lovelies,\n\nIf you're like me find endless inspiration in the aesthetics of gothic fairy-tales, then you're in for a treat!

They’re absurdly easy to catch and people in the stories tend to take them home and keep them for a while because mermen could predict the weather. The merman eventually dies or tricks his captors into taking him back to the sea. So opposite mermaids who lured and drowned people mermen were considered pretty harmless and even useful if caught."
