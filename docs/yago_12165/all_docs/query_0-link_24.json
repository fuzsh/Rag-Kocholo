        "text": "After training at the Conservatoire National d'Art Dramatique, in 1993 Claire Lasne decided to opt for a career as a director. She began with the texts of Mohamed Rouabhi, but also those of Chekov, in order to present a “silent revolt” which she has continued to explore. In order to take back theatre to places where it no longer existed, notably in rural areas, Claire Lasne reinvents rigourous folk art under a travelling tent, as part of the work of the Centre Dramatique Poitou-Charentes which she co-directs with Laurent Darcueil. In 2002, the company performed Dom Juan and The Wood Demon at the Avignon Festival. She is back this year with her tent, for a whole month at Rasteau, a village at the foot of the Dentelles de Montmirail.\n\nPrinces and Princesses\n\nIn an old disused cinema, a young boy and girl along with an old projectionst make up their own films and stories. The stories are about princes and princesses of their own imaginations and which they transpose into the time of the Pharaohs or of cathedrals. Stories with a challenge where the victor is never the strongest, stories where good fortune rewards sincerity every time. In one story, a young helmeted prince from the Belle Époque tries to free a princess who has been turned into a statue. (The Diamond Princess). In another, a poor fellah who lives in a fig tree obtains by magic and faithfulness the graces of a great Egyptian queen (The Fig Boy and the Queen of Egypt). In yet another, a boy from the Middle Ages who is supposed to fight with a clever witch decides to stay with her instead. (The Witch and the Impregnable Castle). Written and sketched into picture form by Michel Ocelot, the famous author of the animation film, Kirikou the Witch, these enchanting stories taken from faraway legends are told on stage by two actors who are aurally-impaired and two actors who can hear. The fairy of these tales comes back to life through sign language. Gestures and words go back and forth, silence and spoken words beckon children to continue to make-believe, so that everyone can join in this voyage to the land of fairy tales."
