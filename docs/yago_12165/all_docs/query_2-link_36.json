        "text": "Every year Anim'est brings a series of special guests, animators and some famous animation producers. This year, the festival is pleased to introduce you to Michel Ocelot. The famous French director, animator and graphic designer will be present in Bucharest from October 10 to 13, during which all six of his films and a selection of 8 short films will be projected.\n\nBorn in 1943, Michel Ocelot has been studying at institutions such as the School of Fine Arts in Angers, Superior National School of Decorative Arts in Paris and the Art Institute in Los Angeles. Although using different animation styles and techniques, Ocelot never gives up on fantasy world. Medieval princesses, fairies, witches, Ocelot 's films send viewers on journeys into magical realms, offering imaginative stories.\n\nThe director was first known for Kirikou et la Sorcièr / Kirikou and the witch, the first feature film of his career, awarded the prize for Best Animation at Annecy in 1999 and Best Animated Feature Film at the 2002 British Awards. It was followed next by Princes et Princesses / Princes and Princesses, a selection of ancient stories rendered by silhouettes and Kirikou et les Bêtes Sauvages / Kirikou and the wild animals. He finished his 4th feature film in 2006, Azur et Asmar, presented at the Cannes Film Festival, Quinzaine des Réalisateurs section, and in 2011, Les Contes de la nuit/ Tales of the Night was selected in the competition of the 61st International Film Festival in Berlin. The latest feature film is Kirikou et les hommes et les femmes/ Kirikou and the Men and Women, nominated for the 2013 Cesar Awards.\n\nOne of the most famous studios in the world comes to the 2013 Anim’est. What do the Chicken Run, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Flushed Away, Shaun the Sheep have in common? They enjoyed huge success with the audience and are all created by Aardman studio. Besides films, the studio produces around 75 commercials each year, using a variety of animation techniques.\n\nWith 10 nominations and four awards at the Oscars, Aardman was created in 1972 by Peter Lord and David Sproxton, as a low-budget project, from the two animators’ desire to produce an animated film. They began a successful collaboration with Nick Park, back when he was working on his school film A Grand Day Out, film having Wallace and Gromit as main characters, two names that would get to be famous. The Wrong Trousers (dir. Nick Park), the studio’s first 30 minutes animation has won over 30 awards, including an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film. In 1995, Aardman produces another Oscar-winning title, A Close Shave (dir. Nick Park), which was to confirm the reputation of the studio.\n\nThe audience will enjoy a very special day dedicated to the studio, Thursday, October 6 at Cinema Patria, between 12.30-00.00. Short films from the early years of the studio can be viewed, but also from when Aardman became a name to conjure with in the world of animation. The review cannot do without the famous Wallace and Gromit and their adventures in A grand day out, The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave, A Matter of Loaf and Death and The Curse of the Were Rabbit. Chicken Run (dir. Peter Lord, Nick Park), the studio's first feature film and box office success, and The Pirates! Bands of Misfits complete the film selection dedicated to the Aardman Studio.\n\nThe guest festival of this year's edition is from Holland - KLIK! Amsterdam Animation Festival. Founded in 2007, the festival is organized by the KLIK! Foundation, dedicated to the recognition of animated films as an art form in its own rights and to its development in the Netherlands. A series of short films, selected by the festival’s co-directories, Yvonne van Ulden and Lesley van der Woude, will be screened at 2013 Anim'est."
