        "text": "Story\n\nKirikou is born in a West African village. From his first day on earth he can speak and walk, so he is a pretty special child. He learns that an evil sorceress who has a taste for human flesh. He starts off on his adventure and meets many strange and interesting beasts along the way.\n\nWhy we chose it\n\nAn awarding winning animation inspired by a West African folk tale about a struggle between good and evil. The animation is vibrant and colourful and the setting and style and soundtrack evoke Africa and its art. A story about a child hero who wants not just to defeat evil but to understand where it came from.\n\nWhere it came from\n\nThe story is based around elements of traditional West African folk stories. Writer and director Michel Ocelot spent time as a child in Guinea and took inspiration from the folk tales of Senegal. The animation style and setting are African and are vibrantly colourful with the plants and trees stylised versions of real plants inspired by Egyptian drawing and the animals are all found in Africa.\n\nThe soundtrack is by Senegalese musician Youssou Nâ€™Dour and uses only traditional African instruments.\n\nWhere it went next\n\nThis film was well received and won many film awards. In 2002 it was the joint winner (with Chicken Run) of the British Animation Award for best European animated feature. It was so successful that the film studio created two sequels, Kirikou and the Wild Beasts and Kirikou and the Men and Women. The story was also adapted into a stage musical called Kirikou and Karaba and was first performed in 2007."
