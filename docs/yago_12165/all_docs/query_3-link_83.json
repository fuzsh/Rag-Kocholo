He has worked as a writer, a director, and a cinematographer. He is affiliated with Agence Kamaji.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBertrand Veyne was trained at FEMIS. He began his career as an assistant operator and photography director for commercials, short films, documentaries, and film. He began working as a screenwriter on animated series in 1996. He has also signed several literary bibles, though he did not influence Code Lyoko's literary or graphic bibles. Under the name Philippe Andrieu, he has written more than 15 books since 1999.\n\nIn 2002, Bertrand co-wrote two books of Kirikou with Michel Ocelot (Kirikou et le Buffle aux cornes d’or / Kirikou et la Hyène Noire). These were adapted to film in 2006 under the title \"Kirikou et les Bêtes Sauvages\".\n\nCode Lyoko Work[]\n\nWriting[]\n\n\"I'd Rather Not Talk About It\"\n\n\"Kadic Bombshell\"\n\n\"Wrong Exposure\"\n\nNoteworthy Non-Code Lyoko Work[]\n\nWriting[]\n\nJason and the Heroes of Mount Olympus\n\nMalo Korrigan and the Space Tracers\n\nWalter Melon\n\nDirecting[]\n\nLes hommes et la rivière\n\nCinematography[]\n\nL'Autre Femme\n\nFils de personne\n\nFurther Reading[]"
