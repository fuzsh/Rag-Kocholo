        "text": "Director Trademark: [Michel Ocelot] [silhouettes] In one scene Kirikou's mother is seen as a solid black silhouette backlit by fire; later in the film, Kirikou himself, for the entirety of the underground tunnel scenes, is rendered as a black silhouette with only the whites of his eyes and teeth showing.\n\n[Michel Ocelot] had first envisioned Kiriku und die Zauberin (1998) as a silhouette animation (the medium he had been working in since 1988's Cin√© si (1989)) and wrote the initial version of the screenplay with this manner of presentation in mind. Karaba's \"breast jewelry\" emerged during this phase as a device to prevent her having the appearance of having only one breast when her torso was turned to a three-quarter view but was retained despite the changeover to full color."
