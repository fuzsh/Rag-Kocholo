It has been decided that the prince who will make her show emotion will win her hand in marriage. Multiple princes attempt the feat of entertaining the princess, combining elaborate acts of artistry, prowess and more. However, at the end of each episode, the princess remains unfazed, appearing confused, to the dismay of the princes. At last, when all seems lost, a schoolboy prince presents himself in the palace theater with a large heart, surprising the princess. The schoolboy had correctly predicted that the princess was short-sighted. He suits her with a pair of glasses, allowing her to witness the acts and theatricals she had previously been unable to distinguish, and is now entertained. The schoolboy prince wins the princess over and everyone celebrates.[6]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nLe Prince dompteur (The Tamer Prince)\n\nLe Prince jardinier (The Gardener Prince)\n\nLe Prince à transformations (The Transforming Prince)\n\nLe Prince météorologue (The Meteorologist Prince)\n\nLe Prince sourcier (The Dowser Prince)\n\nLe Prince volant (The Flying Prince)\n\nLe Prince sous-marin (The Submarine Prince)\n\nLe Prince peintre (The Painter Prince)\n\nLe Prince décorateur (The Decorator Prince)\n\nLe Prince magicien (The Magician Prince)\n\nLe Prince qui fait semblant (The Pretending Prince)\n\nLe Prince artificier (The Pyrotechnist Prince)\n\nLe Prince écolier[3] (The Schoolboy Prince)\n\nInternational broadcasts\n\n[edit]\n\nCountry Title Network Argentina La Princesa insensible Mexico La Princesa insensible Once TV Israel הנסיכה האדישה Israeli Educational Television Portugal A Princesa insensível[6] Canal 1\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
