        "text": "Hardback in Fine condition, in French, unpaginated, pp40. Story with cut-out silhouette animation. Princes et Princesses (Princes and Princesses) is a 2000 compilation film by French animator Michel Ocelot. The film consists of six episodes of the 1989 French silhouette animation television series Cin si. This tale begins with a prologue where two children, creative and curious, find themselves in an abandoned cinema and, with the help of a technician, document, discuss, invent, draw and disguise themselves. The story is taken from one of the cut-out paper cartoons by Michel Ocelot, the creator of Kirikou and the Witch. Michel Ocelot is a French writer, designer, storyboard artist and director of animated films and television programs and a former president of the International Animated Film Association."
