        "text": "In February I was given the seed of an idea by Jennifer Kennard of Letterology.\n\nOne crafternoon at her house I made a paper doll with articulated appendages. Over the next month or so I made a lot of them at home.\n\nIt was fun to make them move.\n\nI wanted to make a movie but I had no idea how to do it. Once again Jennifer planted a seed. She suggested contacting Seattle Central College and seeing if a student there could help me. Enter Sam To!\n\nSam is a design student at Seattle College. (He graduates this week). He knows how to do stop motion animation, 3-d animation and many other kinds of design. He is comfortable with technology. He is efficient and responsible and flexible. We met, and I explained that I wanted to make a stop animation movie where my characters danced around. He suggested that we make a story – not just a dance. So I made up a story about a character named Zuleika. I cut some new dolls. Sam came to my studio.\n\nLights! Camera! Rearrange lights! Rearrange camera! Try again!\n\nThe table had to be dismantled and the camera tucked into the rafters. Then Sam took many many pictures while I rearranged the dolls. A few weeks later he made the images into a movie called Zuleika and the Strange Bean. The seed of an idea had sprouted.\n\nClick on the title here to watch our movie Zuleika and the Strange Bean . (The music starts a few seconds after the visuals…)"
