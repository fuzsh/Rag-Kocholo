A boy, a girl, and an old projectionist meet nightly in a run-down cinema to share exotic fables, which then come to life in Ocelotâ€™s gorgeous, visually imaginative fashion. In French with English subtitles. (57 mins., DCP)\n\nParking note: please allow extra time for parking due to multiple events scheduled in the campus area.
