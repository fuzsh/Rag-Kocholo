The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the author and are not to be viewed as factual documentation.\n\nWelcome back to the First Thoughts Anniversaries series, where we are now deep into the renaissance era in the year 1998. By this point, the world of animation had been revolutionised and there was a wave of goodies in theatres that year, with some coming from bright new studios to stand proudly alongside the offerings of the mainstays like Disney. The “Mouse” had been riding high throughout the decade and despite the rather weak Hercules coming out the year before, they more than made up for it with the release of Mulan, which quickly became a firm favourite among fans. As well as that, critics also had their eye on the second film from the trailblazing Pixar studio, which had rocked the animated world a few years earlier with Toy Story and now released the less ambitious A Bug’s Life to generally warm reviews. Joining the heavyweights in the ring was the newly-founded DreamWorks studio (which we’ll be coming back to next week), who made their double-debut in 1998 with the autumn release of Antz (causing drama due to its similarities to Pixar’s film) and then the masterful Biblical epic The Prince of Egypt in December, both of which did well. Finally, Paramount and Nickelodeon began the trend for turning popular animated shows into films with the release of The Rugrats Movie, which became the first non-Disney animated feature to gross over $100 million in the US.\n\nAll of these are wonderful in different ways and 1998 is one of my favourite years in animation, but as with last week’s article, I was faced with a problem for this one. At six years old by the end of the year, 1998 was right in the middle of my childhood, so naturally I had already seen most of its biggest films. What to pick for a First Thoughts review? First, I considered the notorious flop Quest for Camelot from Warner Bros., whose failure caused the studio to lose faith in animation and thus scuppered The Iron Giant’s marketing the following year. Ugh. I didn’t fancy that. Then, there was the more successful Pokémon: The First Movie, but since I’ve never been a fan of the games or shows, I didn’t think I knew enough about the franchise to go for that one. I was left with an intriguing little film from Europe called Kirikou and the Sorceress, which I first discovered a few years ago while reading The World History of Animation and knew next to nothing about. I’m always excited to see something which celebrates another culture, so I thought, why not?\n\nWritten and directed by Michel Ocelot (awesome name) and drawing upon West African folktales, Kirikou was a co-production between many different companies from France (Exposure, France 3 Cinema, Les Armateurs, Monipoly and Odec Kid Cartoons), Belgium (Radio-Télévision belge) and Luxembourg (Studio O, Trans Europe Film). The animation was done at Rija Films in Latvia and Studio Exist in Hungary, with the finished film being distributed by the French company Gébéka Films in December of 1998. This conglomerate of international producers feels very similar to the “Akira Committee” which funded the creation of last week’s film; see how much good can come from working together?\n\nI couldn’t find much information on the production of Kirikou, but I did learn that the backgrounds were painted at both Les Armateurs and at Paul Thiltges’ animation studio Tiramisu in Luxembourg, with digital ink and paint and compositing done by Les Armateurs and Odec Kid Cartoons in Belgium and the voice and music recording done in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. The score composer, Youssou N’Dour, used only traditional instruments in his work and it feels very authentic to the setting as a result; I especially like the little songs the children and villagers improvise for Kirikou after he saves them. “Kirikou is tiny – but he is mighty!”\n\nOcelot’s career had begun back in the 1970s in the world of short films, where he usually worked with paper cut-outs. For this feature, however, he had to abandon that style in favour of computer graphics, using the “Tic Tac Toon” program. Although Ocelot considered the software rather slow, it had the advantage of allowing him to copy, paste and superimpose “layers” as many times as he liked, a technique which suited the two-dimensional art style (loosely based on African folk painting) very nicely. It was left up to the viewer to “reconstruct depth mentally,” at least according to Phillipe Moins of the Animation World Network. The animation is better in some places than others and can look a little rote in the crowd scenes, but the animals are all handled with great skill and the final scenes benefit from better lighting than the rest of the film.\n\nFor the story, Ocelot drew upon his own childhood growing up in Africa, while for the art style he took inspiration from the works of Lotte Reiniger, Aubrey Beardsley, Heath Robinson and particularly primitivist artist Henri Rousseau (a favourite of mine; I was thrilled to recognise his style in the jungles of this film), along with the art of Ancient Egypt and Greece. The film’s distinctively “flat” aesthetic is drastically different from most other films of the time which were pushing for greater three-dimensional realism, but personally I found that refreshing – especially given the onslaught of CGI features we’re still stuck in at the moment.\n\nThe original French cast featured Doudou Gueye Thiaw as Child Kirikou, Awa Sene Sarr as Karaba, Maimouna N’Diaye as Kirikou’s mother, Robert Liensol as Kirikou’s grandfather, William Nadylam, Sébastien Hébrant and Rémi Bichet sharing the role of Adult Kirikou (I’m surprised; it didn’t sound like three different people), Thilombo Lubambu as Kirikou’s uncle, Marie Augustine Diatta as the force woman and Moustafa Diopas as the fetish lookout on the roof. Many of the actors were Senegalese or African actors who were living in France, adding to the film’s authenticity without turning into exoticism. (It’ll be interesting to compare this cast to that of next week’s film, set in China but made by Hollywood).\n\nFor the English cast, meanwhile, the lead role of Kirikou went to Theodore Sibusiso Sibeko, with Antoinette Kellermann (recently seen in Mad Max: Fury Road) as Karaba, Fezile Mpela as Uncle, Kombisile Sangweni as Kirikou’s mother and Mabutho “Kid” Sithole (from Hotel Rwanda) as the Old Man. This version was also directed by Michel Ocelot, in South Africa. There was a Japanese version, too, directed by none other than Hayao Miyazaki for Studio Ghibli in 2003, which starred Ryūnosuke Kamiki (veteran of several Ghibli films, as well as Summer Wars and Your Name) as Kirikou, Atsuko Asano as Karaba and Kaori Yamagata as Kirikou’s mother. In 2009, the film was then given a Swahili version, made in Tanzania with the help of the Danish Film Institute and John Riber of Media for Development in Dar es Salaam, which starred Samson Komeka as Kirikou.\n\nAs a film, Kirikou and the Sorceress is charming, simple and rather weird at times, but I would highly recommend it for children (nonsexual nudity aside). Our titular hero, who spends most of the story as a tiny infant, is a wonder – he is so precocious that he literally gives birth to himself, walking out of his mother’s womb as confident as a lion and with a voice to match. Charming, intelligent and curious, Kirikou spends much of his time asking questions, never afraid to keep digging for information even when the adults around him are reluctant to help. Upon hearing of the neighbouring sorceress Karaba’s evil exploits, he sets out to find his uncle, determined to help him conquer her once and for all. His bravery only grows from there, and after successfully outsmarting her henchmen (known rather strangely as “fetishes”), he proceeds to thwart her every attempt to trap the local children, leaving her seething from afar while the kids celebrate their little saviour.\n\nHowever, the kids have short memories, and no sooner has everything settled down than they go back to ostracising poor Kirikou for his size – the lad must deal with a lot of prejudice and naysayers, yet for the most part he keeps his little head held high and conducts himself with admirable dignity and selflessness. He does have one moment of despair at the Cursed Spring, showing us he’s only human, but even here he does not give up, devoting all his concentration towards solving the problem in front of him and nearly losing his life in his quest to help his village. Bright, adaptable and unfailingly positive in his outlook, Kirikou is a smashing role model for young kids to look up to, teaching them the value of perseverance, generosity and the good that comes from helping others.\n\nAt one point, there’s a conversation between Kirikou and his mother which seems to neatly parallel racism; as Kirikou wonders why Karaba is being so rotten to the villagers for seemingly no reason, his mother patiently explains, “Some will do you harm, when you have done them no harm”. While there is truth to this, Kirikou cannot accept that evil is inherent and refuses to stop searching for the underlying reason behind it. Later on, while having a similar discussion with his grandfather, he learns that there is a reason behind Karaba’s behaviour – she’s suffering from the aftereffects of a long-ago attack by men from the village. This is all brilliantly handled, teaching kids not to take everything at face value and showing them that nothing is black and white; sometimes, people do bad things because bad things have already been done to them. Along his journey, Kirikou also learns to value what he has after becoming frustrated about his small stature, finding ways to use this “handicap” to his advantage – another good lesson for the kids.\n\nI loved to see that Karaba was given some level of depth and isn’t just the generic greedy monster so typical of Hollywood’s animated films. The hammy insanity of classic Disney villains is certainly fun to watch, but what made the best of them so memorable was more than just their personalities – it was their motivations. Karaba’s “evil” turns out to have an explanation, and in her story arc there is yet another lesson about the importance of forgiveness, showing us the damage that can be caused by holding onto the past.\n\nThere’s a subtle sort of commentary on patriarchy in this plot point, as Karaba’s pain was caused by men implanting a poisoned thorn into her back, which could be taken as a family-friendly metaphor for assault. Once made a victim by men, she has now dedicated herself to victimising the men of the village – and only the men, you’ll notice, who she’s rumoured to have “eaten” – by transforming them into her helpless servants, thereby reversing the power dynamic. I don’t know anything about the folktales this story is based on, but surely it can’t be a coincidence that these statues are given the sexualised name of “fetishes”. In the end, Kirikou essentially redeems his gender by removing Karaba’s thorn for her; this act of kindness earns her love, and in the same moment brings Kirikou to rapid maturity.\n\nI have to admit that while I did like the film, that moment towards the end threw me a little. It’s rather startling when, after removing Karaba’s thorn, the miniscule Kirikou suddenly requests her hand in marriage. Naturally, she’s taken aback and refuses, telling him to find somebody his own age, but after humouring him enough to give him a kiss he suddenly transforms into a strapping young stud! It’s so out-of-the-blue, and the villagers are just as freaked out about it as the audience – it feels uncomfortable, as though he’s being “rewarded” for everything he’s done with a woman, a cliché I’ve always detested. Could it just be a sort of visual metaphor intended to represent his new maturity? Who knows. Thankfully, he’s a likeable enough fella that I was able to overlook any unfortunate implications his sudden relationship with Karaba might have raised.\n\nGenerally speaking, this is quite a gentle and colourful film, with only the occasional shocking moment such as the burning of a villager’s house and the painful-looking removal of Karaba’s thorn – but nothing being shown is too much for young kids to handle. We do get the odd moment of “mood whiplash,” such as after the unblocking of the Cursed Spring, where everybody switches abruptly from joy to despair at Kirikou’s apparent demise, but overall the pacing is comfortable, and everything is wrapped up nicely at the end. One final thing I noticed was the warthog that Kirikou commandeers to get him to his grandfather’s place; it reminded me of Bernard doing much the same thing in The Rescuers Down Under, eight years earlier. The scene is just as awkward here as it was there, making our hero look almost arrogant, but then I suppose the hog would have attacked him had he not shown it who’s “boss”. Still, I did feel a bit sorry for it.\n\nIn Europe, the film was so successful that it ended up getting two sequels – Kirikou et les Bêtes Sauvages (Kirikou and the Wild Beasts) in 2005, and Kirikou et les Hommes et les Femmes (Kirikou and the Men and Women) in 2012. In addition, it also got a stage musical adaptation called Kirikou et Karaba in 2007, which I’d love to see. Of course, there is a reason why many of my American and British readers won’t have heard of this franchise – the nudity. Set in a remote West African village sometime in the distant past, Ocelot made the logical decision to depict the characters as they would have truly appeared, in minimal clothing. This means that all the women in this film are bare-chested throughout (and we also get more minor glimpses of male nudity, too), although the context makes it clear that it is entirely nonsexual. Unfortunately, Ocelot’s refusal to censor his work (while an admirable choice) was enough to delay the film’s US release until 2002, with similar delays in the UK; when it did come out, it was only on very limited release and so few people in either country got to see it. Still, the film did go on to win the 1999 Grand Prix Award for Best Animation Film at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival, along with numerous other accolades from similar events around the world, so Ocelot’s work did not go entirely uncelebrated.\n\nAs for me, I would recommend it; it’s tasteful, striking and quite different from the works of modern Hollywood with some valuable lessons to teach children, should you be looking for a more enriching alternative to the pop-culture-heavy films usually put out by Illumination, Sony or DreamWorks. Watching this with your family will no doubt provoke plenty of conversation, and children will hopefully come away from it with a greater faith in their own abilities, inspired by the confident Kirikou.\n\nNow, speaking of DreamWorks, we have come to the seventh and final film in my Anniversaries series, Kung Fu Panda. This is the only truly mainstream piece on the list and I’ve been hearing a lot of encouraging things about it, but we’ll have to see if it’s as good as people claim, ten years on from its release. Shortly after that, we’ll have the Wreck-It Ralph sequel to look forward to, but until then, I thank you for reading and hope you have a good night. Stay animated!"
