        "text": "Magnificent series concept with a subtle mystery and an amazing finale.\n\nFollowing the success of his TV series Gédéon and his short films The Three Inventors and The Legend of The Poor Hunchback, Michel Ocelot was fortunate enough in obtaining a professional order for a thirteen episodes series from French television producer Jacqueline Joubert. For those who do not know her, she is a woman who was crucial for the production and broadcasting of youth programs on the Antenne 2 channel. Thanks to her, Japanese animation exploded in France in the 1980s with series like UFO Robot Grendizer, Candy; as well as in the co-production of important series such as The Mysterious Cities of Gold. These programs were broadcast in the programmation of Récré A2, hosted by Dorothée and her team, the latest which appeared on TF1 with the legendary program of Club Dorothée. In the end, it was thanks to Jacqueline that Japan obtained a great cultural gateway for the French public; and it is this same person who gave Michel Ocelot the opportunity to produce an original series.\n\nEntitled The Insensitive Princess, Michel Ocelot’s story spans thirteen episodes and concerns an incredible fable. That of an eighteenth-century princess who is cold to everything she sees and what surrounds her. To solve this problem, the king her father built a theater for her where every day she discovers new shows and new artists. Attempt doomed to fail. Eventually, the father offers a deal. That of offering his daughter’s hand to any prince who manages to wow this woman with his show.\n\nIn total, thirteen princes will participate in this event. A prince for each episode. Tamer, gardener, transformation, meteorologist, dowser, and others with magnificent gifts. Everyone different, all amazing. Which one will manage to conquer the princess’s heart? It’s up to you to see in this magnificent series.\n\nSeries where Michel Ocelot succeeded in wowing the audience with impressive animation effects. With cut-out paper, puppets, cell animations, original color devices, and other techniques that will delight audiences today and those who discovered the series at the time. During a period when 3D animation and the computer was not an asset that now makes work easier.\n\nTechnically, the episodes are less than five minutes long and are designed in 16mm, and although they are not redefined to HD, the picture is still very good. The same goes for the sound quality. And given that there is very little dialogue, except for the narrator and the theatre host, the narrative remains highly visual and focused on the prowesses of the princes.\n\nAlso, if you go to YouTube, AAA Productions offers the entire series for free. And it’s in a compilation of thirteen videos that people can experience this classic that lasts about an hour in total.\n\nAnd through these episodes, it is a new musical score by Christian Maire, longtime accomplice of Michel Ocelot, that accompanies this story. Nice thing, because like Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, or Alfred Hitchcock and Bernard Hermann, it is a partnership where the stories are enriched and show their true natures. Those of ancient universes where magical and human forces are camouflaged; yet coexist among themselves and co-help each other. And where love between certain people produces incredible miracles that transform and enrich lives.\n\nSo if you’re a fan of these kinds of stories, The Insensitive Princess is for you. And if you take time to watch the episodes carefully, you may discover details explaining this woman’s behavior. Subtle details, but obvious when you look at the story and what happens."
