        "text": "GRIOTTE: “I start!” – VILLAGE: “We are listening!” – Griotte: “Once Upon A Time!” – VILLAGE: “It Was Thus In Time!”\n\nNew inquel located during the story of Kirikou and the Sorceress, between the moment the water spring is released and where Kirikou and his mother discuss for the first time about the sage of the Mountain, Kirikou and the Men and Women addresses the as Kirikou and the Wild Beasts, the daily trials of Kirikou’s life. But this time, on the side of the villagers.\n\nIndeed, in stories involving all the characters, we discover the resolution of certain intrigues launched in the first film as well as new adventures. In the first case, we learn how the Strong Woman manages to repair her burned hut following the anger of Karaba, plot that in the first film had not been resolved since in the end the box remained in ashes. But following the success of the first film, the story and the world of Kirikou got rectified and enriched. Allowing new psychological depths to quite antagonistic characters in the first film, be it the old Grumpy Man in the second episode, the village’s children with a story involving a stranger named Anigouran, but also a new intruder. The Griotte, one of my favourite characters, who goes from village to village to tell stories, especially in the village of Kirikou, which attracts the curiosity of Karaba.\n\nMoreover, in this story, Karaba, reveals, as in the last adventure, facets that make her even more human and touching. Facets that make me wish that Michel Ocelot would produce, whether in book or animated film, new chapters that would reveal more clearly what many visual elements and words that Karaba mentions subtly. Her story and the misfortunes that led her to become an all-powerful witch.\n\nIn its animation, the work, instead of being drawn as for the first two films, is done this time in 3D, with flat colors (cell-shading) that allows to treat the result as drawings, but without the problems of constancy in volume that traditional drawing can bring. I also love how some characters, during camera movements, are arranged by computer under different levels such as a multiplane camera. And as the camera approaches or recedes, the depth levels move, reinforcing the illusion that the work is still on paper. As for the characters, their gestures are fluid, credible and very expressive. About the textures, the colours are warm, as magical as the sets of which Ocelot has the speciality. But above all, this use of 3D and its puppet characters is reminiscent of the direct animation that Michel Ocelot applied in his short films and TV series like Cinesi.\n\nWith the actors, new voices are used for Kirikou and the other children of the village, which is very understandable since the original actors are adults now. Voices that join the old, including Awa Sene Sarr, actress for Karaba, who remained on the three films. Which is beautiful because her voice and her presence gives this character all the charisma and the power it deserves. And among the new recruits, we also have Angélique Kidjo who joins in the last story in a moment that will surprise the spectators as well as the villagers.\n\nFinally, the bonuses for the French DVD (Region 2) present a trailer, a Karaoke, a scene of Kirikou in twelve languages, but also a “behind the scenes” of 32 minutes. What appetite enthusiasts on the design of the film. Although I remember seeing a more detailed “backstage” on YouTube about the film where Ocelot is working hard with his team and, in particular, with the actors performing together. A video that brought more about the production of the film than we have on the disc.\n\nBut in short, this third film is a new chapter that all fans of Kirikou and also animation fans can appreciate, although they may feel lost in the plot that takes for granted that the audience knows about the first film."
