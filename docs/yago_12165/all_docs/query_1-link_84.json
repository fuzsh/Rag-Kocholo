        "text": "So someone who follows me on IG shown me this new featured story Overnight Princess by Nicole Writes. Judging by the fact the author’s profile is linked, it’s not really a beta I think, but it’s not widely published yet.\n\nAnyways, it’s a story about a girl and her friends who had a wild night in Las Vegas, eventually having a drunken marriage with Prince Mateo of Estelita and MC. Her friends also hooked up with the prince’s cousin/advisor and friend. Pretty much royal shenanigans ensue afterwards.\n\nOne interesting bit is that Estelita is a Spanish (at least Spanish-speaking) kingdom, so the guys from Episode one are bilingual in Spanish and English. To me though, some of their lines are a bit forced or hamfisted but I can’t say myself on whether they are ‘proper’ as I’m not a Spanish speaker.\n\nHowever, I can comment on how the main cast looks, especially compared to the original Ink version - especially since the LI’s cousin and friend swapped races.\n\nFeatured LL version Original Ink Version\n\nFor context of the last two pics in each tab, Giovanni is LI’s strait-laced cousin on the left and Javier is the dumb, party-hardy friend on the right. Honestly I am a bit more confused why the cousin is named Giovanni, but then again I am just in the middle of chapter 3 of the gem version.\n\nIf anyone has read this gem story and/or the original, comment what you think about the story/stories.\n\nI also don’t really understand why Mateo or any of them will speak Spanish to the MC and then say something in English. It seems kind of random. And like…if they were speaking Spanish only to each other or like when Mateo is on the phone or something, okay. But most people won’t talk at you in a language you don’t understand when they know you don’t understand unless they are trying to find an equivalent in the language you speak. I guess it would make more sense after the MC tries to learn Spanish but the whole thing just seems off.\n\nI’m wondering if some of the dialogue has been changed between the INk & featured versions or…something? Or maybe some things are just different. The author is Puerto Rican but the story is set in Europe so I have no idea what’s going on lol\n\nMy other major gripe is like…honestly Mateo isn’t a huge douche especially compared to a lot of other featured story LIs but I think it’s because none of the characters have any real personality lol, so that for once isn’t one of my major complaints. However, I am very sick of the “Evil Queen hates the Prince’s ~commoner~ wife and does everything to make her life miserable” trope and its consequences. Like, she is just horrible and straight up abusive and you have to lie there like a doormat unless you want to spend gems. I really hate the message Episode sends where knowing your worth and sticking up for yourself & what’s right is something you can do only if you pay for it.\n\nI didn’t even realise that this was a fully released story and not a beta so I spent some of my gems in the first two chapters and I’m annoyed at myself for that. Not that I need the gems. I just don’t like spending them on things I don’t like or stories that don’t send good messages.\n\nThe pacing is ridiculous too. And I don’t even understand how they went from “ooooo let’s get it annulled” to “one day later - you must come live with me in my palace.” Granted i may not have been paying full attention lol. The only thing that surprised me is that you didn’t have to pay gems to let your friends come live with you in the palace lmao"
