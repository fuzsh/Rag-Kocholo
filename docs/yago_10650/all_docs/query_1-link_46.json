        "text": "For those who don’t know what Hyakka Seiran is, it’s this CD series where Japanese voice actors sing snippets of famous anime songs. …So, I just decided to do comparisons/reviews of the best performances of certain songs, along with some voice actors’ best songs (just my personal opinions, don’t kill me~)\n\nWarning: this is LONG as all hell. Took me three days to write to boot. …So, yeah… if you want to read this, prepare for snacks and bathroom breaks~\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nHana no Ko Lun-Lun: Katsuyuki Konishi vs. Ryoka Yuzuki\n\nI had to go with Yuzuki as her voice fits the song better. XD\n\nHayate Xabungle: Katsuyuki Konishi vs. Kousuke Toriumi\n\nI kinda like Konishi better this time.\n\nSora Kara Koboreta Story: Katsuyuki Konishi vs. Kana Ueda\n\nWent with Konishi as he sounded soothing, while Ueda was a little too moe. To grating levels.\n\nStardust Boys: Katsuyuki Konishi vs. Hiroshi Okamoto\n\nHard to decide as the song is pretty bad (it ends with basically screaming both times), but Okamoto’s was a little more energetic.\n\nCandy Candy: Katsuyuki Konishi vs. Mitsuaki Madono vs. Fumiko Orikasa vs. Megumi Toyoguchi\n\nI love Toyoguchi’s version - she manages to capture the age of the song, and sounds a little old school. …Though Madono is a close second. He sounds completely legit and adorable at first, and then his “CANDY” nearly makes me pee my pants. XD GODDAMMIT MADONO (Yuuki Jegnan would be mortified to hear that song.)\n\nKyou mo Dokoka de Devilman: Katsuyuki Konishi vs. Kouki Miyata vs. Mitsuaki Madono vs. Sho Hayami vs. Keiji Fujiwara\n\nI went with Hayami since his voice has an edge over the other guys. XD Not to mention he actually DID sing that song the best - seriously, why do people keep saying he sings off-tune? Are they tone-deaf?\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTatakae! Kamen Rider V3: Masakazu Morita vs. Nozomu Sasaki\n\nGoing with Sasaki since he sang properly, while Morita screwed around (it was awful). XD Funny thing with Sasaki - he used to sound and sing very cute back in the day; then he started smoking to change his voice, and his singing talent went poof as a result. And he sounds scary now. No more Shin Mouri…\n\nMakka na Scarf: Masakazu Morita vs. Mitsuaki Madono vs. Ryotaro Okiayu vs. Keiji Fujiwara\n\nMy favorite is Morita’s, though the best - singing-wise - is Madono or Okiayu. …It was kind of hilarious how Morita seemed to mimic Isao Sasaki. XD\n\nDororon Enma-kun: Masakazu Morita vs. Kouki Miyata vs. Yuuko Satou\n\nDefinitely Satou~ She manages to sound creepy, in a good way.\n\nIjigen Story: Masakazu Morita vs. Masaya Matsukaze\n\n…They both kinda suck, but I like Morita’s version better. XD\n\nYoroshiku Chuuningu: Masakazu Morita vs. Kenyuu Horiuchi\n\nI don’t like either that much, but I’m going with Horiuchi. XD He sounds a little more professional (Morita was karaoke quality).\n\nKimi wa Nanika ga Dekiru: Masakazu Morita vs. Kentarou Itou\n\n…They’re both cute in their own way. XD Morita goes “Isao Sasaki voice” route, while Itou sounds like a happy nice guy.\n\nYuusha Raideen: Masakazu Morita vs. Mitsuki Saiga vs. Daisuke Hirakawa\n\nI think I’m going with Saiga this time. She sounds more professional, plus I LOVE how she always sounds so boyish. XD\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nZudadan! Kinnikuman: Wataru Hatano vs. Nobutoshi Canna\n\nThey’re both VERY good, but nobody holds a candle to Canna. SERIOUSLY. This is the guy who nearly became a musician before the voice-acting got him - and he learned to play the guitar by simply READING A BOOK. …Proof of his musician past? He’s had the same skill level of singing since his voice-acting debut. Back in 1992 (two years after his debut), he sang three songs for Kikou Keisatsu Metal Jack. …He was 24 at the time and already singing the way he does now.\n\nGET WILD: Wataru Hatano vs. Takuma Terashima vs. Tomoaki Maeno vs. KENN vs. Noriaki Sugiyama\n\nMy favorite is Hatano’s version, though I also like Maenu and KENN’s - Maeno’s voice is beautiful here, while KENN sounds badass~\n\nYume wo Shinjite: Wataru Hatano vs. Chihiro Suzuki vs. Daisuke Namikawa vs. Kentarou Itou vs. Nobutoshi Canna\n\nEasily Canna, though I also like Suzuki’s a lot. …I didn’t use to like Suzuki’s singing that much, and then I heard his Hyakka Seiran track. Welp. Dat “SHINING SOUL”. Shet.\n\nSTEP: Wataru Hatano vs. Tomoe Oumi vs. Tomoaki Maeno\n\nMAENU. Why’s he using his cute voice again? XD I wish he used his deep one at least once…\n\nKimi ga Suki Dato Sakebitai: Wataru Hatano vs. Mamoru Miyano vs. Takeshi Kusao vs. Marina Inoue vs. Nobutoshi Canna vs. Atsushi Kousaka vs. Aya Uchida\n\nCan’t decide between Canna and Kousaka! XD …Kusao gets a honorary mention because he’s my favorite voice actor, and actually played SLAM DUNK’s main character~ (…Btw, Mamo was terrible. He intentionally screwed it up…)\n\nKaze no Mirai e: Wataru Hatano vs. Nobutoshi Canna\n\n…UGH. CANNA. dljhfsdk He just blew the entire song out of the water, outdoing the original. “We can fly! This star is our precious ship! Say Da-Garn! Stand up, to the light of the endless future!”\n\nBokutachi wa Tenshi Datta: Wataru Hatano vs. Tomoaki Maeno\n\nWish I knew why Maenu keeps sounding better than Waccha. His voice just suits this song so well. o_O\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nSorairo Days: Tetsuya Kakihara vs. Marina Inoue vs. Miyu Irino\n\nInoue. She sings the best, plus her voice is SO powerful~\n\n1/3 no Junjou na Kanjou: Tetsuya Kakihara vs. Mikuni Shimokawa vs. Takahiro Mizushima\n\nHOLY SHET. Shimokawa sounds like Nana Mizuki in this! …Though Mizushima isn’t bad, either. In fact, he’s great. (Funny how everybody outdoes Kakihara. XD)\n\nHitori no Yoru: Tetsuya Kakihara vs. Noriaki Sugiyama\n\nEasily Sugiyama. He outdoes Kakki by a mile, not to mention he can ALSO write lyrics. Ever heard the creepy campfire song from Hetalia? Yep. His lyrics.\n\nREADY STEADY GO: Tetsuya Kakihara vs. Romi Paku\n\nRomi~ So good. <3\n\nCAT’S EYE: Tetsuya Kakihara vs. Ayumi Fujimura vs. Hisayoshi Suganuma vs. Ayano Niina vs. Shoutaro Morikubo vs. Hisako Kanemoto vs. Megumi Toyoguchi\n\n…That’s a LOT. I like Niina and Toyoguchi the most, while Suganuma and Morikubo are close behind.\n\nRomansu: Tetsuya Kakihara vs. Atsushi Kousaka vs. Aya Uchida\n\nKousaka this time~ People tend to know him best as Prussia from Hetalia (with his terrible metal character songs), but they’d be surprised to hear how well he actually sings. XD\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nHajimete no Chuu: Kouki Miyata vs. Keiji Fujiwara vs. Chihiro Suzuki vs. Shoutaro Morikubo\n\nThis is a tie between Miyata, Fujiwara and Morikubo. …Miyata’s version gives me vibes of his Haruka characters. While I SWEAR Fujiwara’s singing voice would make his villains facepalm. Since it’s so damn CUTE. And Morikubo just sounds like the hot guy at your high school who everybody wants… dang.\n\nGinga Tetsudou 999: Kouki Miyata vs. Yui Kano vs. Daisuke Hirakawa vs. Romi Paku\n\n…Romi’s version is my favorite~ It’s always lovely when she’s using her more feminine voice.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTatakae! Casshern: Mitsuaki Madono vs. Nozomu Sasaki\n\nNeither are that good, but I like Sasaki’s more. XD Madono’s screwing around with his voice… (Looks like Madono, Morita and Miyano are a Baka Trio in this CD series…)\n\nCutey Honey: Mitsuaki Madono vs. Sho Hayami vs. Romi Paku vs. Megumi Toyoguchi\n\n…I kind of have a soft spot for Paku’s version. XD She sounds like she should be going “ÜNF~” after every line.\n\nUchuu Senkan Yamato: Mitsuaki Madono vs. Mitsuki Saiga vs. Daisuke Namikawa vs. Kenyuu Horiuchi vs. Yoshimasa Hosoya\n\nMy favorite is Horiuchi’s. …And Madono is mimicking Isao Sasaki again - he doesn’t quite have the voice for it, but he’s still great. I swear Saiga sounds so much like a boy… I really want to make a mecha pilot boy based on her voice now! SHET.\n\nUmi no Triton: Mitsuaki Madono vs. Nozomu Sasaki vs. Sho Hayami\n\n…I’m having a hard time deciding between Madono and Hayami. XD\n\nMazinger Z: Mitsuaki Madono vs. Nozomu Sasaki vs. Sho Hayami vs. Yoshimasa Hosoya\n\nMadono and Sasaki are both great. …This time Hayami was screwing around since he whispered some of the lines. XD\n\nOmoide ga Ippai: Mitsuaki Madono vs. Nozomu Sasaki vs. Mitsuki Saiga vs. Keiji Fujiwara vs. Hisayoshi Suganuma vs. Daisuke Hirawaka vs. Kentarou Itou vs. Shoutaro Morikubo\n\n…And this just outdid CAT’S EYE. That said… HOLY SHET SAIGA. She’s by far the best. @__@ Fujiwara sounds cute again, and Hirakawa is just BEAUTIFUL. He sounds just like that kind, reliable big brother figure he’s in real life~\n\nLum no Love Song: Mitsuaki Madono vs. Shoutaro Morikubo vs. Megumi Toyoguchi\n\nI love all three so much. XD Madono and Morikubo are changing their voices with each “Suki yo”, while Toyoguchi is just cuuuute~\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nKaze yo Hikari yo: Nozomu Sasaki vs. Kousuke Toriumi\n\nChoosing Tori here.\n\nMoete Hero: Nozomu Sasaki vs. Hisayoshi Suganuma vs. Takuma Terashima vs. Daisuke Namikawa vs. Masaya Matsukaze vs. Shoutaro Morikubo\n\nFor some reason Matsukaze was my favorite. He wasn’t the best singer (Morikubo is the best in this bunch), but he had the most spirit. …Close second would be Sasaki.\n\nSora e: Nozomu Sasaki vs. Yuuko Satou vs. Rie Tanaka\n\nRie is good - the other two kind of sucked (Sasaki’s was too mellow, Satou didn’t get the high notes at all). …My favorite version of this will always be Ai Orikasa’s. She played the main character in the anime, and covered the song… and it was so… skjfgdsk She’s so goddarn incredible, she’s even my favorite female voice actor. …Also, listen to this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGwesKBVxAU&t=0m25s That’s from a live musical without lipsyncing. …You try finding a female voice actor who sings better than that!\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTAKE ME HIGHER: Mitsuki Saiga vs. Minoru Shiraishi\n\nI kinda like Saiga more, but Shiraishi is growing on me… SO CONFUSED.\n\nGinga Tetsudou 999 (different song): Mitsuki Saiga vs. Mayumi Yamaguchi vs. Kenyuu Horiuchi vs. KENN\n\nGood god, KENN. No wonder he ended up in Tenimyu, with that skill.\n\nKimi wo Nosete: Mitsuki Saiga vs. Ayumi Fujimura vs. Daisuke Hirakawa vs. Chihiro Suzuki vs. Rie Tanaka vs. Yoshimasa Hosoya vs. Satomi Satou\n\nMy favorite versions are Tanaka and Suzuki (…Suzuki’s using such a high-pitched and cute voice he sounds girly). XD …I also love Hirarin and Hosoya’s versions since they both sound so soothing. Though this time, instead of a brother, Hirarin has a fatherly thing going on. XD\n\nYasashisa ni Tsutsumareta nara: Mitsuki Saiga vs. Ayumi Fujimura vs. Keiji Fujiwara vs. Yuichi Iguchi\n\nNn… I’m going with Saiga, though this is kind of a boring snippet…\n\nDareyori mo Tooku e: Mitsuki Saiga vs. Fumiko Orikasa vs. Junko Minagawa\n\nJunko sounds so cute here~ Plus she IS the only one in this bunch who acted in a live musical and sang on live stage. XD She’s great live, btw. Just sayin’. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzTwt6aE12U\n\nUchuu Keiji Gyaban: Mitsuki Saiga vs. Hisayoshi Suganuma vs. Atsushi Kousaka\n\nI… kinda like Suganuma’s version the best. Though Saiga is probably better.\n\nTaiyou Sentai Sanbarukan: Mitsuki Saiga vs. Masaya Matsukaze\n\nSaiga’s the better of the two, but I like both~\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nGeki! Teikoku Kagekidan: Ayumi Fujimura vs. Yui Kano vs. Hisayoshi Suganuma\n\nGoing with Fujimura here (though none of them were really that spectacular). My favorite versions will always be Akio Suyama and Mayumi Tanaka’s solos~ …Though Mayumi’s version is an ondo… XD\n\nTouch: Ayumi Fujimura vs. Daisuke Namikawa vs. Megumi Toyoguchi\n\nFujimura again~ She sounds so good here. …It kind of reminds me of Yuji Mitsuya’s version (though Mitsuya sounds even girlier than Fujimura does XD).\n\nMoonlight Densetsu: Ayumi Fujimura vs. Hisayo Mochizuki vs. Ryohei Kimura vs. Hisako Kanemoto\n\n…Kimura sounds so HOT. XD I’m laughing and turning into goo at the same time! HALP.\n\nMiracle Girl: Ayumi Fujimura vs. Yui Kano vs. Daisuke Kirii\n\nI think I like Kirii the most.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nSanpo: Hisayo Mochizuki vs. Kentarou Itou\n\n…Going with Mochizuki since she actually sounds cute… Itou’s screwing around and sounds like a chainsmoking hamster. XD\n\nETERNAL WIND: Hisayo Mochizuki vs. Kumi Sakuma vs. Ryoka Yuzuki\n\nSakuma sounds absolutely PERFECT. ._. …Wait? HOLY SHET, she played Garnet Sunday in Super Robot Wars OG?! Now I’m giddy~\n\nSekai ga Owaru Made wa: Hisayo Mochizuki vs. Daisuke Kirii\n\nGoing with Kirii, though neither is that good. XD\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nYuzurenai Negai: Yui Kano vs. Marina Inoue\n\nI love Inoue here, though Kano isn’t bad.\n\nJajauma ni Sasenaide: Yui Kano vs. Kana Asumi\n\nThey’re both cute, but I’m going with Asumi.\n\nDelicate ni Sukishite: Yui Kano vs. Sayaka Ohara vs. Yuichi Iguchi\n\nKDSJFGKDS Iguchi sounds exactly like a girl! XD He’s amazing…\n\nKanashimi yo Konnichiwa: Yui Kano vs. Yuuko Satou vs. Fumiko Orikasa vs. Sayaka Ohara\n\nI think I liked Orikasa the most.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nAi yo Kienaide: Yuuko Satou vs. Satoshi Hino\n\nEasily Hinocchi~ Satou basically yelled hers, but Hinocchi is very smooth and still sings like a boss.\n\nYoake no Michi: Yuuko Satou vs. Fumiko Orikasa\n\nThey’re both amazing, but Orikasa sounds a little cuter~ <3\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nZankoku na Tenshi no Te-ze: Mamoru Miyano vs. Chihiro Suzuki vs. Yui Makino vs. Mikuni Shimokawa vs. Yuichi Iguchi\n\n…I like Suzuki’s version the most for whatever reason.\n\nTaiyou ga Mata Kagayaku Toki: Mamoru Miyano vs. Chihiro Suzuki\n\nSuzuki pulled it off again~ …Kisumi beating Rin at karaoke, anyone? XD\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTate! Toushou Daimos: Ryotaro Okiayu vs. Shoutaro Morikubo\n\nThey’re both good, but Okki’s voice fits the song better.\n\nYatsura no Ashioto no Ballad: Ryotaro Okiayu vs. Keiji Fujiwara vs. Daisuke Hirakawa\n\nI kinda like all three.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nAttack No. 1 no Theme: Sho Hayami vs. Chie Nakamura\n\nBoth are great in their own way - Nakamura’s voice fits best since this is a girl’s song, but Hayami is HILARIOUS using a feminine voice. Who knew he could even sound like that when his voice is naturally so deep? xD\n\nDevilman no Uta: Sho Hayami vs. Yoshimasa Hosoya vs. Masaya Matsukaze\n\nThey’re all good, but I like Matsukaze the best~\n\nAshita no Joe: Sho Hayami vs. Toru Ohkawa vs. Daisuke Namikawa vs. Kenyuu Horiuchi vs. Shoutaro Morikubo\n\nMorikubo is the best, though I also liked Namikawa (#2) and Ohkawa (#3).\n\nTiger Mask: Sho Hayami vs. Toru Ohkawa\n\nPicked Ohkawa… Hayami was kind of screwing around… XD\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nMakafushigi Adventure: Hisayoshi Suganuma vs. Daisuke Hirakawa vs. Aya Uchida\n\nHirarin was my favorite… now, Aya was ANNOYING. I can’t stand moe, never could. The only exceptions are Yui Horie and Mamiko Noto.\n\nMezase Pokémon Master: Hisayoshi Suganuma vs. Yuuki Kaji\n\nKaji sounds so, so good~ If Satoshi ever grew up, they’d better get Kaji to voice him. XD …LEL HE EVEN DID PIKACHU\n\nHohoemi no Bakudan: Hisayoshi Suganuma vs. Marina Inoue vs. Daisuke Kirii vs. Yuichi Iguchi vs. Aya Uchida\n\nInoue is my favorite, with Suganuma as close second.\n\nPegasus Fantasy: Hisayoshi Suganuma vs. Daisuke Hirakawa vs. Rie Tanaka vs. Daisuke Kirii vs. Yoshimasa Hosoya vs. Masaya Matsukaze\n\nHosoya’s version is by far my favorite of this bunch. He has the right amount of energy, intensity and singing skill. …This song is a really tough one to get right - either the singer overdoes the passion and ends up a large ham, misses it altogether and ends up flat, screams the lines or is off-tune the entire time. Toru Furuya is one of the few people who can sing it properly. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukvmv_KAvu4 <— See this. …He may sound a little hammy, but that intensity is normal for him. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_qSXvmy73k This is one of Furuya’s newest songs, btw. …It’s a lot better than his Pegasus Fantasy - granted, the former is from 1987 or so while Spirit of Saint is from 2013 (he was 60 in ‘13 and sure doesn’t sound like it. XD His fans joke that he’s a vampire since his face and voice haven’t changed in 30 years.)\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nMidnight Submarine: Kenji Nojima vs. Takashi Kondo\n\n…This one’s a given. Kondo.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nLupin the 3rd no Theme: Hiroshi Okamoto vs. Noriaki Sugiyama\n\nBoth are good, but Okamoto easily wins this one. He’s mimicking the original singer and utterly nailing it. …Btw, this is HIROSHI Okamoto. Not Nobuhiko Okamoto.\n\nAi Senshi: Hiroshi Okamoto vs. Romi Paku\n\nMan, Okamoto’s growing on me~ <3 He’s mimicking the original again, down to the singing style and manly voice! XD He nailed the entire thing and sounds nearly exactly like Daisuke Inoue.\n\nShounen ki: Hiroshi Okamoto vs. Kentarou Itou\n\nOkamoto again. XD Though my favorite version is from Takashi Kondo (he covered it on an album he released years ago).\n\nAnbaransu na Kiss wo Shite: Hiroshi Okamoto vs. Chihiro Suzuki vs. Tsubasa Yonaga vs. Tomoaki Maeno vs. Noriaki Sugiyama\n\nI can’t decide since they’re ALL great. …Though I like Maenu and Sugiyama a little more (Suzuki’s close behind).\n\nSTILL LOVE HER: Hiroshi Okamoto vs. Atsushi Kousaka vs. Yoshimasa Hosoya vs. Noriaki Sugiyama\n\nThey’re all really lovely~ Okamoto is really gentle and “nice guy next door\"ish, Kousaka is a little manlier (like that childhood friend who grew up into a hot jock), Hosoya is another nice guy next door, and Sugiyama sounds like a shoujo manga’s love interest.\n\nCHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA: Hiroshi Okamoto vs. Masaya Matsukaze vs. KENN\n\nTie between Matsukaze and KENN. …Matsukaze sounds badass and manly (fits the feel of the song), while KENN sings the best~\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nSTILL TIME: Takeshi Kusao vs. Tsubasa Yonaga\n\nKusao, definitely. :3 He’s more energetic and gets the feeling right, plus he’s always been the better singer of the two. (I have over 80 solo songs from him now, though I’m kinda biased since he’s my favorite voice actor.)\n\nMajokko Megu-chan: Takeshi Kusao vs. Fumiko Orikasa vs. Megumi Toyoguchi\n\nGoing with Orikasa.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nSobakasu: Marina Inoue vs. Ryohei Kimura\n\nI kinda liked Inoue.\n\nToki ni wa Mukashi no Hanashi wo: Marina Inoue vs. Romi Paku\n\nThey’re both so ADORABLE, and it’s really rare to hear Romi singing in her girlier voice.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nDunbine Tobu: Romi Paku vs. KENN\n\nWelp, KENN. He makes old themes even better.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nYumeiro no Spoon: Mayumi Yamaguchi vs. Sayaka Ohara\n\nOhara’s the better of the two.\n\nAi no Hikari to Kage: Mayumi Yamaguchi vs. Junko Minagawa\n\nMinagawa’s using a very feminine voice here - she sounds a lot like Yoshiko Sakakibara and Youko Matsuoka like this. …Speaking of Matsuoka, why hasn’t she sung since Cyber Formula? Randoll’s songs are so amazing.\n\nHana no Sasayaki: Mayumi Yamaguchi vs. Tomoe Oumi\n\nBoth are good - Oumi’s sounds extremely good, but Yamaguchi plays Andre at the end of her snippet and it’s just… FFFFFFF-\n\nBlue Water: Mayumi Yamaguchi vs. Makoto Ishii vs. Kenyuu Horiuchi vs. Noriaki Sugiyama\n\nIshii blows everyone else out of the water, though Sugiyama’s also great~\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nBara wa Utsukushiku Chiru: Chie Nakamura vs. Megumi Toyoguchi\n\nThey’re both simply divine. <3\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTOUGH BOY: Takashi Kondo vs. Kumi Sakuma\n\nKondo’s really good here.\n\nSARA: Takashi Kondo vs. Daisuke Kirii vs. Tomoaki Maeno\n\n…Kondo’s really sounding incredible. How the hell does he do that voice? ._. …Maenu’s a good second, though his version isn’t even nearly as unique as Kondo’s.\n\nYume Kounen: Takashi Kondo vs. Sayaka Ohara\n\nI’ve adored Ohara for years and she doesn’t disappoint. <3 Such a powerful voice~ …Kondo was incredible, too. And now I want them to duet this song. XD\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nKesenai Tsumi: Toru Ohkawa vs. Mikuni Shimokawa\n\nI like them both~ …Whoever thinks Ohkawa can’t sing needs to listen to this (or \"Mach Go Go Go” from the same Hyakka track).\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nWILL: Yuuki Kaji vs. Hisako Kanemoto vs. Aya Uchida\n\nChoosing Kaji - he sounds really good, while Aya is too moe and Kanemoto’s a little lackluster.\n\nOhayou: Yuuki Kaji vs. Junko Takeuchi\n\nKaji’s pretty good. …Takeuchi’s using a kiddy voice which is somewhat grating.\n\nBrave Heart: Yuuki Kaji vs. Junko Takeuchi\n\nYES. Junko’s using her Takuya voice! <3 This is so great~\n\nGarnet: Yuuki Kaji vs. Sayaka Ohara vs. Yui Makino\n\nOhara kicks butt in this song as always~ <3 I love her voice - it’s beautiful, powerful and she sings like an angel.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nSEVENTH MOON: Chihiro Suzuki vs. Nobutoshi Canna\n\nDang it, Canna. Isn’t there ANYTHING you can’t sing? XD\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nVoltes V no Uta: Kousuke Toriumi vs. Junko Minagawa\n\nTori did it better. …I had to rewind several times before I found Minagawa’s, it was hard to spot.\n\nJigoku no Zubat: Kousuke Toriumi vs. Yuichi Iguchi\n\nThey’re both good, though I liked Iguchi a little better.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nDoraemon no Uta: Daisuke Namikawa vs. Ryohei Kimura\n\nI love Namikawa’s version~ XD He’s using a deep voice and it sounds so fun! WHO GOT TAKUMA EGAWA DRUNK?! Kimura’s version is also incredibly adorable (Kise doing this at karaoke would get girls squealing).\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nRock River e: Fumiko Orikasa vs. Junko Minagawa\n\nMinagawa sounds like she’s more into it - I like her version a lot.\n\nO-ryouri Koushinkyoku: Fumiko Orikasa vs. Yui Makino\n\nI like Makino’s version a little better - it was easier to recognize than Orikasa’s.\n\nTamashii no Rufuran: Fumiko Orikasa vs. KENN vs. Takahiro Mizushima\n\nThey’re all amazing. I can’t pick at all. XD\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTuxedo Mirage: Kana Asumi vs. Aya Uchida\n\nAsumi’s better - Uchida sounds too moe AGAIN.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nYOU GET TO BURNING: Rie Tanaka vs. Ayano Niina vs. Yuichi Iguchi\n\nNiina sang this really well, and her voice is awesome~ She sounds kind of deep and resonant. …Too bad she doesn’t have many roles yet.\n\nRinbu -Revolution-: Rie Tanaka vs. Kana Ueda\n\nI really like both versions, though neither of them really match the original. XD Masami Okui’s tough to emulate - she really deserves her place in JAM Project.\n\nKaze no Tani no Nausicaa: Rie Tanaka vs. Kana Ueda\n\nI like both, though Ueda sounds a little better.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nItooshii Hito no Tame ni: Junko Minagawa vs. Aya Uchida\n\nNow, this time even Aya manages to sound amazing - she isn’t moe anymore, and Minagawa is just lovely~ I can’t decide.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nFIND THE WAY: Sayaka Ohara vs. Ayano Niina\n\n…I want a full version of Ohara singing this. SDJKGHSJDK It sounds just like Erza singing to Jellal, I swear~ Niina’s version is also good, though not as beautiful as Ohara’s.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nSaraba Aoki Omokage: Kenyuu Horiuchi vs. Daisuke Kirii\n\nKirii somehow manages to sound better than Horiuchi. XD (Though the moment you hear “Tabidachi no Jokyoku” on Horiuchi’s Hyakka track, it’s painfully obvious how superior he is to Kirii. “Won’t you try talking, with stars that were just born? Within the timid sparkling, you should be able to feel warm thoughts~”\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nSuper Girl: Daisuke Kirii vs. Masaya Matsukaze\n\nI love both, and Kirii’s “Don’t you, don’t you know” starts out so BADASS~\n\nWE GOTTA POWER: Daisuke Kirii vs. Yoshimasa Hosoya\n\nHosoya is a little better.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nPrecure 5 Full Throttle GO GO!: Miyu Irino vs. Junko Takeuchi\n\nThey’re both perfect and adorable~\n\nButter-Fly: Miyu Irino vs. Atsushi Kousaka vs. Tomoaki Maeno vs. Aya Uchida\n\nI love all four, but Maenu’s is my favorite. (Irino was cute, but it was karaoke quality which made me think of Suga-san for some reason… and I can’t stop laughing… that said, I’m turning into goo at his “Byakuya -True Light-”.)\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nAkuma-kun: Minoru Shiraishi vs. Yoshimasa Hosoya\n\nThey’re both cute. XD Also, each time I hear that “baranga” part, I keep thinking “Who turned Arado Balanga into a demon?”\n\nAngel Night: Minoru Shiraishi vs. Takahiro Mizushima\n\nGoing with Shiraishi here~\n\nWinners: Minoru Shiraishi vs. Takahiro Mizushima\n\nHOLY SHET MY FAVORITE ANIME. (Along with Saint Seiya, that is.) I love both versions, and I love how the original version performed by WOMEN is still better. XD G-Grip ftw! …Shiraishi seems to have quite a scratchy voice, and THEN he sings “Skies of Love” from Legend of the Galactic Heroes and sounds so smooth. …AND HIS ENGLISH IS ACCENTLESS. (He needs to get more anime roles, I swear. I want to fangirl him.)\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nHotaru no Hikari: Satoshi Hino vs. Junko Takeuchi\n\nI prefer Hino, though Junko is also good. …Hinocchi’s ENTIRE track is amazing, especially his versions of JOINT, I SAY YES, Seichou Osomatsu Takashi (…that “HAAA-AAAA~” XD), Ikari no Juujin (so goddarn cool… cap'n Sawamura doing this at karaoke?), Samurai Heart (…I wish they made new Samurai Troopers series) and Blue Dream -Yume Tabibito-.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nDramatic: Tsubasa Yonaga vs. Ryohei Kimura\n\nI like them both, but Kimura is a little better.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nUshiroyubi Sasaregumi: Kumi Sakuma vs. Shoutaro Morikubo\n\nMorikubo’s version sounds sooooo good~\n\nLOVE Sarigenaku: Kumi Sakuma vs. Tomoe Oumi\n\nGoing with Oumi here.\n\nMishiranu Kuni no Tripper: Kumi Sakuma vs. Megumi Toyoguchi\n\nI like them both, though Toyoguchi’s a little cuter.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTruth: Tomoe Oumi vs. Mikuni Shimokawa\n\nShimokawa sounds better here. …Why does she sound so much like Nana Mizuki? ._.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nEgao ni Aitai: Yui Makino vs. Hisako Kanemoto\n\nGoing with Kanemoto since Makino sounds a little too moe.\n\nWind Climbing: Yui Makino vs. Ryohei Kimura\n\nI like Makino more - she sings the song better. …Though Kimura’s good with the chorus part.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nDAN DAN Kokoro Hikareteku: Mikuni Shimokawa vs. KENN\n\nI like them both, but KENN just a little more.\n\nPlatina: Mikuni Shimokawa vs. Satomi Satou\n\nThey’re both good, but Shimokawa is obviously better (as she’s a singer). XD\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nHashire Shoujikimono: Atsushi Kousaka vs. Hisako Kanemoto\n\nI have to go with Kousaka… since Kanemoto’s doing another annoying moe voice. XD\n\nLove TOROPICAANA: Atsushi Kousaka vs. Hisako Kanemoto vs. Aya Uchida\n\nThey’re all good, though I love Kousaka’s the most. XD “SHUBIDUBA”\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nHimitsu no Akko-chan: Shoutaro Morikubo vs. Satomi Satou vs. Megumi Toyoguchi\n\nThey’re all so cuuuuuute. <3 Especially Satou. Toyoguchi sounds pretty (and old school), and Morikubo is using a cuter voice and now I’m thinking of Ginji Amano. X’“’D\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////"
