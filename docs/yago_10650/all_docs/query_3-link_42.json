        "text": "That's interesting as I prefer using a baritone voice when reading Brainstorm, combined with his bizarre speech patterns. (\"One drop is all it takes to turn a hand gun into a banned gun.\") One way to think of it is Adam and Jamie of Mythbusters mashed together, and British.\n\nNice. I wonder if it's more often that we stunt-cast according to a specific, striking role instead of by the actor's / VA's overall ability.\n\nAndy Samberg is a great call for Rodimus. I can't explain why but I've always heard him talk like the original VA for Goku, so I'm glad I'm not alone in assuming he has a \"high pitched excitable weirdo\" voice.\n\nI just finished the new book and while I can't name a lot just yet, I'm hearing the Corey Burton Animated Megatron for Megs (since Megatron has been English to me for a very long time but I want this one to be more openly sinister than IDW) and either David Kaye, Gary Chalk, or Neil Kaplan for Orion/Optimus. Someone who speaks with authority but isn't quite as obviously grizzled as Cullen's depictions always were, even back in G1 when he still had a little twang to his voice. Chalk in particular would probably be good at delivering speeches like a senator would have to be."
