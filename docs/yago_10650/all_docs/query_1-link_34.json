        "text": "It would be unfair to call the video game franchise Ace Attorney a “titan” of Japanese mystery pop-culture, but a persistent and noteworthy influence, it certainly is. Often paired with the manga (comic book) series Detective Conan and fellow mystery video game Danganronpa, it isn’t uncommon to find leaders of Japanese detective writing who are fans of at least one of these series, or to name them influences on their career. Not the least that there are multiple examples of mystery novels that clearly aim to emulate Ace Attorney‘s plotting style, along with no small number of inspired Ace Attorney-esque video games as well, but also that many youths find their first exposure to classical fairplay detection through these thrilling courtroom adventure video games.\n\nI also happen to be one such youth.\n\nIt’s been an open secret on this blog that Ace Attorney is the series that propelled me into the world of Golden Age mystery fiction and continues to be, to this day, my favorite mystery series of all time in any medium. I first covered the franchise on an under-performing review of the first game of the series, lamented about the lack of attention it gets in my post about animated mysteries in Japan, mentioned the series yet again in my review of Masahiro Imamura’s Death Among the Undead, and then one case got represented on my list of my 15 favorite impossible crimes and 6 cases on my list of 30 more favorite mysteries of all time, before finally my, as friend and fellow blogger Nick Fuller of The Grandest Game in the World lightly put it, enthusiasm for Ace Attorney culminated in The Comprehensive Guide to Ace Attorney for Video Game-Averse Mystery-Reading Persons (+ other mystery games to try!), a post in which I try to make the series as accessible as possible for people who enjoy mysteries but are wary of video games, as well as breaking down the creator’s inspiration from famous classical mystery writers, everyone from Perry Mason to Ellery Queen.\n\nWith that, I thought I’d be able to wash my hands of Ace Attorney as far as this blog is concerned. Writing what is literally the comprehensive overview and retrospective on the series seemed to be a fitting cap on my insistence for this random mystery video game. I’ve talked about every case of every game, broken down what the series is, why you should play it, how you can play it, and basically done everything short of buying every reader of this blog a copy of the game. As far as mystery fans care, I’ve touched upon every meaningful part of the official Ace Attorney franchise.\n\n…Or so I had believed…\n\nRecently I’ve begun to hear from certain trustworthy sources, knowledgeable fans of both Golden Age mysteries and Ace Attorney, that quite a bit of untapped, genuine mystery media exists in the franchise of which I was somehow terribly unaware. And not only does it exist, it’s also apparently… quite good!\n\nAs the resident Ace Attorney superfan, I felt embarrassed at how negligent I was in covering all of the bases of this series I claim to love so much. Not only were there two novels called Turnabout Airline and Turnabout Idol, translations of which I didn’t even know existed, but there were also two promotional manga series, simply titled Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney and Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth (after their respective game entries), released and officially localized into English. The novels are themselves one full case each, and then the Phoenix Wright manga contains seven, while the Miles Edgeworth manga contains eight. In other words, there are 17 further official cases of Ace Attorney mystery writing which I simply totally missed while writing my “comprehensive” guide — that’s almost as good as missing four of the games themselves! Knowing that most of them are supposed to be quite good, too, I decided I had to rectify this oversight immediately, starting with the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney manga series…\n\nWhen Ace Attorney was first created, the series started as a trilogy of games for the Nintendo GameBoy Advance, and released exclusively in Japan! The series was thought to be finished at that point, but with the announcement of a fourth game — Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney — and the remakes of the original three games for the Nintendo DS, all of which would be released in English for American audiences as well, Capcom decided to do a spontaneous promotional campaign in order to drum up excitement for Ace Attorney both in Japan and overseas. Kuroda Kenji was commissioned to write the scenarios for 7 all-new, totally original mysteries for Ace Attorney, which would be compiled into a short 5-book run of comics, in order to give a new audience a taste of Ace Attorney’s mystery plotting prior to its proper release in the interest of enticing fans to buy the four upcoming games.\n\nAlthough the comics are based on the characters and premise of the video games, the serialized stories would require absolutely zero foreknowledge of the original material to understand, making them suitable both for newcomers and veterans alike. Nothing needs to be known about Ace Attorney besides the context that it stars Phoenix Wright, a somewhat hapless rookie defense attorney who uses on-the-spot bluffing to point out logical flaws in witness testimony that falsely implicates his (innocent) client of a murder! By unraveling the seemingly airtight case presented by the prosecutor through Ellery Queen-esque chains of deductions, Phoenix Wright not only proves his clients innocent of wrongdoing, but always manages to find the true perpetrator in the process.\n\nThe manga series features characters from the first three games of the series, but otherwise stoutly avoids revealing any information that would meaningfully spoil the gameplay or mystery-solving experience of the games. In fact, the comics exist in something of a floating timeline, meaning that their location in the canon of Ace Attorney is particularly ambiguous.\n\nIn other words, you readers who never played Ace Attorney, have no fear! You are free to jump into this series as you please! Furthermore, this manga, like most of the mystery genre, is majorly episodic. You could dip in and out into any of the self-contained mysteries as you please and miss out on very little and run the risk of being spoiled on nothing.\n\nEach case is an attempt to compress into short story form the Ace Attorney formula of having a single person be accused of a crime in which the circumstances make it so only they could be guilty, finding contradictions in the testimony of witnesses hell-bent on seeing your client go to jail, and through Ellery Queen-esque chains of deductions finally proving their innocence and discovering the true killer, all while arguing against a prosecutor who believes with all their heart that your client is guilty.\n\nHow successful the comics are at adapting the formula is variable between stories, however. A few of the cases really struggle with a plot that doesn’t quite suit the format being pigeon-holed into a structure they don’t really fit. Case 2, titled “Turnabout Gallows”, epitomizes this entirely, with a trial segment that barely involves physical evidence and instead involves arguing about dubious psychology (something the games never do). Add to this a murder involving a “Man-Spider” who crawls on ceilings and plays Saw-like games with his victim, and you get a plot befitting Detective Conan or The Kindaichi Case Files much before Ace Attorney.\n\nBut then some cases truly do feel like what an Ace Attorney short story would and should feel like. Capturing not only the essence of the games’ style, but also perfectly mimicking very small, but nonetheless important, nuances of their approach to plotting and cluing. Clues recontextualizing themselves as they’re brought back to mean different things two, three, four times, killers being caught on very natural slips of the tongue, and even Phoenix being cocky, bluffing with a seemingly airtight piece of evidence that appears to prove the client’s innocence, only for the prosecutor to point out that there’s a very natural explanation that Phoenix merely overlooked which destroys his entire argument in one fell swoop. This strength of cluing, in which one minor piece of information never means exactly what it appears, and in fact represents three totally different facts altogether, clues and evidence are twisted and turned on their head, and every hint is doing double-time at all times is in the best of these stories very impressively carried over from the games to the manga, not the least impressive because the manga was written by a different person and, even more so, the cases are probably about 1/10 the length of an average case from the game.\n\nBut where consistency is lacking in the manga’s success at adapting the Ace Attorney formula, it more than makes up for it with the consistency of the mystery plots. Of the five cases I’ll be discussing today, there is only one which is not all of clever, entirely unique, and entirely fairly clued. These stories are, in fact, so well-clued and plotted, that one might find them on the whole a little easy to figure out — scrupulously fairplay to a fault, in fact. But for that fault, they’re not obvious for a lack of creativity or cleverness, because those are qualities these mysteries have in spades. Amusing and unique settings — a murder in a Mansion of Spiders, or a girl possessed by a Death God to commit murder in a locked-room, or “the world’s smallest locked-room mystery” — lend themselves to equally amusing and unique explanations. The quality of mystery writing here really shows off the strength of short-form mystery plotting, and rivals in places even some of the best of the more eminent Detective Conan, Kindaichi Case Files, and Detective School Q manga series.\n\nI really do feel comfortable calling Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney something of a hidden masterpiece of shin-honkaku mysteries and mystery manga, managing to not only imitate the strengths of Takumi Shuu’s plotting style and twisty evidence-placement, but also to infuse into it Kuroda Kenji’s own highly imaginative settings and solutions. Add to all this being perhaps the most truly scrupulously fairplay mystery I’ve seen in the manga-sphere, and, in short, any mystery fan should be pleased to read this exceptional little piece of Japanese mysteries.\n\nA break-down of the individual cases would be essential, but it’s worth noting that as of the time of writing this, I only have access to five of the seven stories available in the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney manga. Therefore, this review will only be part 1 of 2, and the remaining two stories will be reviewed once they’re available to me…\n\nCase 1 – Turnabout of the Wind sees Phoenix’s hapless childhood friend Larry Butz be accused of murdering Bright Bonds, the ex-boyfriend of Belle Windsor, his new girlfriend. The two had been dating for a long time, but Belle soon found out Bright was married and dumped him on the spot. Since then, Bright had continued to harass Belle, begging her to come back to him. Angered by this, Larry leaves Bright a threatening voice mail… a fact which, when combined with his fingerprints being found on the murder weapon, makes him a prime suspect for the prosecution. Just as he’s done a few times before, Phoenix defends Larry of these false accusations!\n\nEvery game in the series has a bit of a formula with how they handle their first cases. Each first case takes place over only a single day, doesn’t feature an investigation, and usually features only one witness who is, usually, the true killer. The manga stays true to this formula, and so is a bit simplistic compared to the rest of the series, but none the worse for it! It isn’t hard to figure out the killer, or how they committed the crime, but as always Ace Attorney is as much about the “how does Phoenix figure it out?” as anything else, and this aspect of the case is wonderful. Just like Ace Attorney proper, there’s this aspect of clues and hints coming back over and over again, being used in different contexts and taking on different meanings. Quite a few of the clues and reasoning here are brilliant, besides! Ace Attorney trial segments are essentially protracted denouement scenes, so the mystery writing is very engaging, as you’re asked to walk through the reasoning with Phoenix as he does it in court, step-by-step — there’s even a challenge to the reader!\n\nThat all being said, the way the formula is changed for the manga is a bit hard to get used to, since it doesn’t involve finding contradictions in testimony so much as the testimony is just a source of information as Phoenix and the prosecutor argue with each other directly. The main issue with this case is that the two begin arguing before the case is even fully established so it’s not even fully clear why the prosecutor thinks Larry is guilty until the case is more than half over, and then by that point Phoenix is already confronting the real killer, making it a bit of an awkwardly paced case. That’s a minor gripe, though, because this is still a wonderful little mystery story that recalls, like the best of Ace Attorney, “Ellery Queen but in court”, and it’s a promising sampler of the future cases!\n\nCase 2 – Turnabout Gallows sees Phoenix Wright summoned by Robin Wolfe, the CEO of a prominent tech company. An employee of Wolfe’s, Eddie Johnson, has recently taken his own life by leaping from the top of a wall, but Wolfe is irrationally paranoid that he’ll be accused of somehow murdering Johnson. In anticipation of that, the CEO decided to enlist the aid of defense attorney Phoenix Wright to clear him of any suspicion of wrongdoing.\n\nUnfortunately for Wolfe, though, Phoenix and his assistant Maya Fey discover that Robin Wolfe has a mentally disturbed younger brother named Bobby, towards whom he is deeply abusive. Bobby is a reclusive spider fanatic who is condemned to a windowless building on the Wolfe property called “The Spider Manor”. When Phoenix then finds that the building is not only filled to the roof with books on spiders and cages containing the very same arachnids, but also equipped with a remote controlled torture-chair that holds a captive person’s entire body, he begins to believe their prospective client really did murder his employee. The arachnophobic Eddie Johnson could be bound and held captive in the Spider Manor, until he’s so emotionally disturbed he accidentally kills himself trying to escape…\n\nBut before Phoenix and Maya can reject Robin Wolfe’s requests for defense, the man suddenly vanishes… Before long, the man’s entire family is summoned together in front of an intercom to talk to him. He says that he’s being held captive in the Spider Manor, and that he’s being harassed by a Man-Spider who can walk on the ceilings! Just as everyone decides to go save Robin, however, the Spider Manor bursts into flames…\n\nAnd in the charred rubble of the building, Robin Wolfe is found, murdered, having been beat over the head! And when the murder occurred, everyone was together and in clear sight of each other… Everyone, that is, except for Bobby Wolfe, Robin’s abused younger brother. Can Phoenix solve this bizarre case of a man walking on the ceiling and airtight alibis in order to prove Robin Wolfe’s innocence of the murder!?\n\nThis case is by far and large the least faithful adaptation of the Ace Attorney style in the manga. Psychological torture chambers, mental disability, apparent spider-demons who challenges his victim a Saw-like game for survival… The overall darker tone and supernatural overtones (besides the Ghost-summoning that exists in Ace Attorney) recall Detective Conan and Kindaichi Case Files long before it even begins to recall Ace Attorney. Add to that the fact that the first half of the trial is concerned with debates on psychology and motive (something Ace Attorney rarely focuses so much on, with a preference for rigorous physical cluing), and you’ve got yourself a mystery story that really does not recall the source material even in the slightest.\n\n…But it’s none the worse off for it, because “Turnabout Gallows” really is spectacular! The trick behind the alibi is perhaps a little easy to piece together, because the story audaciously shows you a little too much of the murder occurring in real time, but it’s still very original, ambitious, and massive-in-scale, not unlike something that might be dreamt up by the mind of Soji Shimada.\n\nAnd where the story misses the Ace Attorney stylization, it more than makes up for it with the standard of cluing and the tendency to wrap clues and off-handed remarks back around multiple times to take on different meanings. As you can tell from the titles, “Turnabout” is a theme of Ace Attorney; the defense turning around a seemingly hopeless case, evidence being turned around and taking on new meanings… and the trick of “Turnabout Gallows” applies the theme of “turnabout” in a very, very literal way, the first of three cases that take the concept of “turnabout” and apply it, entirely literally and entirely at face value, to their mystery plots. There’s one particular clue that is emblematic of “turnabout” in this way, too, that really is brilliant; it turns on entirely specialistic knowledge, but Kuroda’s crafty plotting allows the reader to see its significance without ever once directly providing the reader with the specialistic knowledge in one of the most utterly ingenious and daring visual clues of the mystery genre!\n\n“Turnabout Gallows” falters in being a little too ambitious in showing the commission of the murder to the audience in such a way that almost entirely spoils the trick, and not being a very faithful take on Ace Attorney as a mystery series. But to its benefit it has a daring and original alibi trick that makes great use of its congruous elements brilliantly, some phenomenal cluing, and one of the series’ best takes on the theme of “turnabout”. A smidge weaker than stories to come, but nonetheless great little mystery, this!\n\nIn Case 3 – Turnabout Showtime, Phoenix treats Maya to a day out at SparkleLand so they can watch the amusement park’s mascot-themed stage show! However, during the show, an actor stumbles onto stage and collapses, blood flowing from within his costume!\n\nPhoenix, Maya, the fellow actors, and the announcer — a young girl named Julie Henson — drag the actor, still in his costume, back stage, and undress him… only to find him stabbed through the chest! However, due to the circumstances in which he was stabbed, his death is soon revealed to be “the world’s smallest locked-room mystery”…\n\nWhen he was stabbed, the victim, Flip Chambers, was inside of a full-body costume. The costume wasn’t damaged, meaning Flip had to be removed from the costume before being stabbed and returned to the costume! The only way to remove someone from the costume is through a zipper on the back, which can only be reached by a second person; the costumes cannot be removed by the person wearing them! However, the only person at the crime scene who is capable of removing costumes was Julie Henson, the only member of the cast who wasn’t also wearing a costume that severely restricted her dexterity!\n\nIn order to prove Julie innocent of this murder, Phoenix Wright must contend with the world’s smallest locked-room mystery… a “locked-costume mystery”!\n\nThe best case in the manga, and it isn’t even close! Not only is “Turnabout Showtime” just a great, original, little locked-room mystery (the smallest in the world!), it’s also pure, vintage Ace Attorney. Ace Attorney cases are on average four to six hours long, whereas this story is a single less-than-100-page manga chapter, and yet despite that this case manages to represent everything that makes Ace Attorney what it is. It is, plain and simple, everything an Ace Attorney short story would and should be.\n\nMany of the defining elements of Ace Attorney‘s plotting and cluing are on full-display in this fantastic story. Just like in the games, the logical rigidity of the courtrooms is weaponized against Phoenix as he finds evidence he believes effortlessly proves Julie’s innocence, only for the prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth, to point out a simple, entirely reasonable oversight that totally flips Phoenix’s argument on its head. Evidence seems to be one thing and is later flipped around to mean something else entirely, at one moment seeming to prove someone’s guilt and at the next proving them innocent, at one moment being critical to Phoenix’s case and at the next being disastrous to it! Off-handed remarks that appear to mean nothing in reality mean everything. The battle of wits between two equal forces trying to prove diametrically opposite cases and the way this causes evidence to be twisted, manipulated, misshaped, rearranged, and recontextualized. It’s all here, crammed tightly but elegantly into this short but crafty mystery tale.\n\nAdd to all that a very clever and original locked-room mystery set-up with an equally clever and original explanation — the second impossibility in which the theme of “turnabout” is taken entirely at face value — and you have a charming mystery short story you can take little fault with.\n\n“Turnabout Showtime” is the only case in the manga I failed to figure out before the ending, and the surprise was more than earned by this well-plotted little gem of Japanese murder mysteries. The whole manga itself is an overlooked masterpiece of Japanese mystery plotting, but this is the story that really elevates it to that level, as it stands as one of my favorite short-form mysteries of all time.\n\nIf you read only one case from this manga, I recommend this one! It is emblematic of everything Ace Attorney (albeit in abridged form), and manages to stand on its own two feet as a great and unique impossible crime at that!\n\nCase 4 – “Turnabout Prophecy” takes Phoenix and Maya to a fortune-teller’s court — a group of fortune tellers set up in the top floor of a department store — where a young girl named Russi Clover is told she’ll be possessed by a demon God from Venus and commit murder. So, when a murder happens in the locked-and-sealed audience chamber of Oracle Hecate, and Russi is the only one in the room with the victim, she immediately breaks down and confesses to the crime, saying she was taken over by the Venutian God to commit murder!\n\nPhoenix, however, doesn’t believe that Russi could commit this crime; and if you rule out demonic possession, that means she can only be innocent! But, as always, Phoenix is forced to compete with a situation in which his client is the only possible culprit in order to prove their innocence…\n\nLike “Turnabout Storyteller”, “Turnabout Prophecy” is a perfect exemplar of what an Ace Attorney short story really should be — perhaps an even more perfect one than the previous case! Everything is there, including Phoenix being overly-cocky over an ace up his sleeve only to find out a perfectly reasonable explanation exists to destroy his argument, the solution being built up from a long-series of small contradictions in Ellery Queen Chain of Deduction fashion, brilliantly re-purposed clues, and a great back-and-forth logical tug-o-war between the prosecution and defense — all of it. Add to that a more elegant explanation for why the defendant is the suspect, and you’re given the most perfectly executed abridging of the Ace Attorney formula the manga has to offer.\n\nHowever, where this case fails is in its pretty trivially easy locked-room mystery. The seasoned armchair sleuth should be able to figure out the solution to the locked-room mystery very easily. However, for how easy the story is to figure out, it isn’t a result of the story being uninspired; no, the story really is quite clever and original, only it suffers for over-tipping its hand much like the earlier “Turnabout Gallows”, thanks to the Christianna Brand-ian touch of the solution being based on a half-correct explanation that’s written off over the course of the story.\n\nHowever, just like the first case, “Turnabout of the Wind”, it’s worth keeping in mind that Ace Attorney is just as much about the process of how the culprit is discovered in a courtroom battle as it is about who- and howdunit. The trial segment is brilliantly plotted, with many great contradictions, surprising reversals, and spectacular clues; even if you’ve seen the solution coming from a mile away, no other case in the manga makes the process of arriving at the truth as engaging as this case anyways.\n\nAnd, yet again, “turnabout”, in the literal sense, is utilized wonderfully here…\n\nIt loses points for being easy to figure out, but the courtroom battle on display here is the best of the manga so far. This is another perfect adaptation of Ace Attorney with all of the same logical rigidity and transient clues-of-a-million-shapes you’ve come to expect! Fantastic, fun, and clever!\n\nCase 5 – Turnabout from Heaven involves a young woman with contradictory memories about the ghost of her mother appearing to her and promising to kill her abusive father. Naturally, the girl is brought to court and accused of the crime, and although the court flatly rejects the possibility of her mother’s ghost being the culprit, the young woman has proof! When she was a child, her mom promised to give her her necklace on her eighteenth birthday, and the day after the murder… the promised necklace was left on her pillow!\n\nPhoenix doesn’t believe the gentle young girl would commit the murder, and so, as always, he gets to work proving her innocence in impossible circumstances.\n\nWhile all the other cases in the manga are whodunits and impossible crimes, this minimalist case is interesting in that the culprit confesses nearly immediately, but argues that the crime was an accident, turning this into a whydunit in which the goal is to prove motive. It’s not hard to spot the answer, since it’s very typical kidnapping mystery fare, but there’s a contradiction and line of reasoning in this case that’s super brilliant and the Ace Attorney format is actually used really well here despite the story being very different from anything you’d see in the games, with Edgeworth constantly trying to prove that the killer’s confession is false in order to secure a guilty verdict for the defendant. The clues and reasoning here are quite good! However, you can fault the story for being a little simplistic, and the happy ending being very forcibly engineered (even if still quite clever from a mystery-plotting perspective…)\n\nA more pressing criticism to levy against this case, though, is the fact the court flatly rejects the existence of ghosts, even though all of these characters have seen actual, honest-to-God ghosts in the courtroom on multiple occasions. This is an inconsistency the series refuses to acknowledge, but ghosts empirically exist in the Ace Attorney universe and have appeared in court through spirit mediums’ bodies on more than one instance. In the sixth game in the series, you discover a country exists where the memories of the murder are manifested through the victim’s spirit as a basis for its entire judicial system; it is very silly that the games still insist on making skeptics of people who have seen undeniable supernatural phenomena with their own two eyes.\n\n….You’re saying that that’s not THAT pressing an issue, are you? Well, it’s annoying to me….\n\nAce Attorney is already my favorite mystery series of all time, but I’ll admit I came into this spin-off series with more than just slightly low expectations. I expected to be greeted with lazy, half-baked regurgitations of series tropes, lame and uninspired mystery plots, and generally be annoyed with misunderstandings and mistakes here, there, and everywhere.\n\nInstead, I was met with a surprising gem, not only of Ace Attorney-onia but also of mystery plotting in general. Nearly all of the cases perfectly capture the essence, style, plotting, cluing, and structure of Ace Attorney — the turnabout of evidence at multiple critical junctures of the trial to mean different things at different points, the contradictions and chains of deductions, the logically rigorous battles of wits — while also just producing consistently clever, and entirely original mystery plots. While many of the stories can be faulted for being easy to solve, their originality and creativity aren’t hindered by this; not the least because the process of discovering the truth is always littered with brilliant clues, reasoning, and reversals through the series’s chronically engaging courtroom battles.\n\nAce Attorney the manga is an undeservedly overlooked gem of the series and mystery plotting at large. Fans of mysteries who are unacquainted with Ace Attorney will still find plenty to love in this fabulous little collection of mystery shorts. In short, wow!\n\nThe last two cases of the manga are currently unavailable to me but if this is the standard one can expect, I eagerly look forward to finishing the series and reviewing them for your pleasure!\n\nTo wrap things up, a ranking of the cases….\n\nCase 3 – Turnabout Showtime\n\nCase 4 – Turnabout Prophesy\n\nCase 2 – Turnabout Gallows\n\nCase 1 – Turnabout of the Wind\n\nCase 5 – Turnabout from Heaven\n\nMysteries and thrillers have had such a wedge driven between them that for the two to overlap is often a spectacle worth noting as rare exceptions, such as the spectacular “puzzle boxes” of film director Christopher Nolan (Inception, Interstellar). While the western incarnations of these exceptions are often highly well-documented in our little blogging niche of the internet, those crossovers between purified detective stories and thriller from Japan are significantly less publicized than their straightforward honkaku (“authentic”) detective story counterparts.\n\nAnd so, cribbing the title of this post from Jim Noy’s “FIVE TO TRY” posts over at his spectacular blog, The Invisible Event, I intend to offer to western fans of Golden Age mysteries and detection five Japanese thrillers which appeal even to our specific sensibilities! These aren’t just any old “mystery-thrillers” or “thriller-mysteries” or whatever other permutation of genre names you want to think of; these are thrillers which contain a style and nature of plotting which I believe should specifically appeal to fans of the Golden Age standard and method of mystery plotting!\n\nSo, below are my five picks for Japanese thrillers which I believe even those in our little nook of the internet can enjoy!\n\nDeath Note\n\nThe quintessential Japanese mystery-thriller, Death Note is predominantly a manga series about Light Yagami, a high-school student who discovers a supernatural notebook called “The Death Note”, writing in which allows Light Yagami to kill any person as long as he knows both the real name and face of that person. Now going by the alias of “Kira” (Killer) ascribed to him by the media, Light Yagami is tracked down by a master detective who goes by the enigmatic name of “L”.\n\nDeath Note is the very first entry that came to my mind when I decided to compile a list of thrillers which I believe even English-speaking authentic mystery fans could read and enjoy. The series is possibly the most well-known “cat-and-mouse” thriller from Japan to English-speakers, with the story following both the perspectives of the criminal Light and the detective L in equal measure.\n\nDespite its supernatural premise, the eponymous Death Note is guided by a set of strict, unbendable rules which dictate how it can and cannot be used, making it a verifiable example of the hybrid mystery. Furthermore, while L can sometimes resort to “moon logic” (wildly convoluted or counterintuitive reasoning), typically his reasoning is based on information the audience is also privy too. And since Light/Kira’s responses are equally guided by reasoning based on information known to the audience, it can be said that despite being labeled a “supernatural thriller”, Death Note is as much a fairplay detective story as any other inverted mystery, in which we’re equally capable of reasoning along with both sides of the crime: commission and detection.\n\nI recommend this most to people who: like inverted mysteries and capers; don’t mind supernatural elements in their mysteries; enjoy following the psychology of the villain.\n\nLIAR GAME\n\nBilled by Wikipedia as a “psychological thriller”, LIAR GAME is a multi-media franchise which began with a manga (Japanese comic book) about Nao Kanzaki, a naive college student who is suddenly sent 100 million yen (roughly $760,000 USD) and instructed that is now a competitor in the Liar Game Tournament, a multi-stage competition in which participants are encouraged to cheat, betray each other, and lie in order to get their hands on each other’s money!\n\n…A problem, indeed, for the “foolishly honest” Nao Kanzaki.\n\nIn this tournament, the competition is split into various stages in which contestants play games of wits to overcome their opponents and win their money. For instance, the very first game is a game called “Minority Rule”, in which contestants are asked to answer yes/no questions. If your answer is the minority, you move on to the next round of the game, but if your answer is the majority you are immediately disqualified… Of course, however, as players are permitted to lie, there are three questions you must ask yourself every round: (1.) how many of my competitors does this question apply to, (2.) how many of my competitors know the answer to question 1, and therefore (3.) how likely are the competitors to lie, and is it beneficial to me to answer correctly or lie?\n\nAs Nao Kanzaki moves through the various stages of this tournament, instead of keeping the money for herself, she begins to use the earnings to buy her contestants out of their debt and, hopefully, slowly dismantle the Liar Game Tournament Organization from within the game itself…\n\nLIAR GAME is almost certainly the closest thing you’re going to get to “fairplay mystery plotting” in something which is, frankly, not even a “mystery” at all. Rather than dealing with murders or thefts, in LIAR GAME the puzzle is always “how can Nao mathematically maximize or even guarantee her chances at winning each game?” Information is never hidden from the audience, and with a close enough understanding of the rules, the player is constantly in possession of all the details they need to see Nao’s path to likely or certain victory! In every game, outcomes can be forced, rules can be cleverly exploited, and nothing is ever left entirely up to chance or victory. A stage for many complex math puzzles and logic problems, LIAR GAME is almost like a mystery story in which you follow a protagonist who has to solve, not crimes, but purified riddles! Something like The Hunger Games, but with competitive puzzle solving.\n\nThis genre of story is not uncommon in manga, often called “gambling” or “game” stories, but very few few manage to be as good as LIAR GAME, which is as complex, satisfying, and fair as any crime story!\n\nI recommend this most to people who: like riddles, logic problems, and math puzzles; are interested in game philosophy, game theory, and logic theory, especially as it applies to gambling; enjoy heavily rule-dictated conflicts.\n\nRaging Loop\n\n“Werewolf” is a social deduction board game in which players are randomly assigned roles like “Townsperson” or “Werewolf”. Every round of the game is separated into two stages: nighttime, in which the players assigned the role “Werewolf” secretly select one person to kill (remove from the game), and daytime, during which players debate about who they believe the Werewolves are, vote them out, and then kill them.\n\nHowever, imagine if instead of a board game, these rules dictated the real murders and deaths of real people in a cursed mountain village out in rural Japan. Then, you’d have Raging Loop.\n\nIn the “visual novel” (a video game with lots of text that mostly only exists to tell a story) Raging Loop, Haruaki Fusaishi bikes into the mountains with no idea of a destination. However, during his trip he gets stranded in a remote mountain village which, he discovers, has been the battlegrounds for a war between the God of the Mountain and the demons of Yomi (Hell)…\n\nIn order to keep the battle fair, rules have been established: at the start of the “war”, a random number of villagers are killed and replaced with Werewolves who take on all of the traits of the person they’re replacing! Every night these Werewolves are allowed to kill one person of their choosing, and every day the survivors debate amongst themselves who they believe are the Werewolves. And, if they believe they’ve found an impostor, they vote, and the accused person is hung by the cliffside… If all the Werewolves are exorcised, the Mountain wins, but if the Werewolves ever outnumber the surviving humans, the survivors are murdered and the mountain is overcome by the Yomibito…\n\nWhile competing in this bizarre murder game, Haruaki is murdered and discovers he has the ability to go back in time and make difference decisions by dying. Using this ability, Haruaki tries to stop the deaths. But, as he continues to change things in the village, the “game” begins to take on different, progressively complicated permutations, putting Haruaki more and more at risk of being unable to overcome this bizarre curse…\n\nRaging Loop‘s first three chapters are very interesting exercises in mystery-writing in which you, the player, read about the characters participating in a murder game following specific rules. While early on the characters are comically awful at Werewolf, which might be frustrating to real-life veterans of the game, it helps ease newcomers into understanding the concept, and as the games progress and more and more characters compete in the game, the games begin to get more creative and more deceptive!\n\nBecause the murders are based on the real rules of a real-life “mystery game” which are easy and intuitive to understand and we have access to all the same information as the characters, despite being easy to sum the game up as a psychological horror game, it also means we have the ability to reason along with the players as they play the game. It’s easy to intuit what the characters will do (to the same degree as it’s possible to do it in the real-life party game), and it’s possible to reason about who is and isn’t the Werewolf on the same level as the characters within the narrative. Using a heavily rules-dictated conflict makes this a fantastic thriller game for fans of mystery fiction, as it hits a lot of the same notes, focusing on tight strategizing and clever logic required for the characters to survive!\n\nWhile the chapters following the multiple “games” aren’t nearly as interesting, the first 20 or so hours of the game are fantastically fun mystery-thriller fare! Check out my friend “Bad Player”‘s review here.\n\nI recommend this to people who: like social deduction party games; are interested in psychological horror; enjoy conflicts in which the players are forced to apply creative strategic thinking in order to survive/come out on top.\n\nParanormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo\n\nParanormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is a game best experienced knowing as little as possible, but what I can say is that it’s a supernatural horror-mystery puzzle game in which the player is tasked with investigating the truth behind seven curses befalling seven groups of people…\n\nThe game’s narrative is incredibly dense and complex, and while it’s the furthest thing from a traditional detective story on this list, it is still a satisfyingly complicated mystery tale involving the interplay between a giant collection of brain-teasing plot threads and puzzles which mystery fans should enjoy if they’re comfortable with a more heavily video game-ish experience.\n\nI recommend this most to people who: like J-horror; enjoy ghost stories; are comfortable playing video games\n\nThe Empty Box and the Zeroth Maria\n\nKazuki Hoshino is an average student at an average high-school trying to live an average high-school student life without anything getting in the way of his very peaceful, un-compromised existence. Hoshino’s ardent commitment to maintaining as unspectacular an existence as humanly possible has attracted the amusement of a being named “O”, who wishes to give Hoshino a “Box” — a wish-granting implement that will give him anything he asks for. When Hoshino rejects the wish, insisting he doesn’t want anything he doesn’t already have, “O” decides to make it his mission to subject Hoshino to as gruesome conditions as he can until the high-schooler relents and accepts the “Box” to wish for his everyday life back…. in an experiment to test the furthest possible limits of human homeostasis.\n\nDuring this experiment to push Kazuki into accepting a wish, more and more of the people in his life are given “Boxes”, and these “Boxes” take the wisher’s deepest desires and externalizes them into supernatural phenomena… all entirely centralized around disrupting Kazuki Hoshino’s average, everyday life!\n\nIn order to restore balance to his existence without wishing the “Boxes” away, Kazuki Hoshino, along with Maria Otonashi, must continue to (1.) discover what the nature of the supernatural phenomenon targeting them is, (2.) figure out what manner of which produced the phenomenon, and (3.) figure out who would make such a wish and convince them to unhand their “Box”…\n\nThe Empty Box and the Zeroth Maria is, strictly speaking, a “supernatural psychological thriller” novel series told in the form of semi-episodic mystery stories. There are seven volumes in the series, each one focusing on a different incident with a different wish produced by a different “Box”, and in each case the protagonists are required to deduce details about the wish and wisher, making this another honest-to-God example of the hybrid mystery plotting style. While it isn’t strictly-speaking always fairplay, and the first book is more of a straight-forward supernatural drama, some of the books like Volume 2 really get close to purified detective fiction, including genuinely fair clues, clever logic, and format-breaking storytelling that make this a super interesting and enthralling supernatural detective series.\n\nI recommend this most to people who: are comfortable with high-school drama; are interested in supernatural mysteries; want a series that gets progressively more surreal over time; are interested in psychological drama.\n\nWhile their shin-honkaku brethren are more publicized in our nook of the internet, these five and more represent how varied and intelligent the world of Japanese thrillers can be, and just how amenable they can be to the sensibilities of lovers of puzzle plots and Golden Age mysteries. Oftentimes they can be found not far from the hallowed grounds of authentic mystery we love so much, so if you choose to pursue any of these stories, happy sleuthing, and good reading!\n\n(*Note, although this is the sixteenth in this series of reviews, I only encourage you to read my review of the first volume to get a summary of the series and my preamble about the reviews. It is not necessary to read any other entry in the series besides the first)\n\nYou may or may not have noticed that I haven’t updated my Detective Conan reviews in a while. The last update was a review of volume 15, nearly a third of a year ago… This is NOT because I haven’t been reading it, but quite the opposite: I’ve been reading it between classes, while bed-ridden with sciatica, at the hospital waiting to be diagnosed with sciatica, during mental health burnouts, over lunch… It’s such a breezy and easy to read series that it’s become a go-to comfort read for me when I feel like I haven’t touched enough mysteries lately.\n\nI’m actually at book 30 in Detective Conan now, and reviewing these somewhat weekly means I’ll never catch up and never have room to discuss any other non-literature mysteries! So I kept putting off writing new Detective Conan reviews, but then continued reading the series until one day I realized… oh no… I’ve only reviewed half of what I’ve read!\n\nSuffice it to say, this was unideal. Anxiety set in (as it always does when I’m facing the most insignificant problems a person has ever faced) and I had no idea how I was ever going to catch up with myself reviewing them one measly book at a time!\n\n…So why review them one book at a time? Why not write one massive catch-up review post, covering all 14 volumes I’ve read since I last updated the series, and continue from there? Does this seem inefficient and inelegant? Probably.\n\nBut I’m still doing it. It makes me feel better.\n\nDetective Conan is one of if not simply the largest “classical-styled” mystery series in the entire world, boasting exactly 700 disparate mystery stories across 1109 chapters of 104 books, and 1067 episodes of 31 seasons of television (only counting the stories original to the television adaptation), and that’s before taking into account video games, novels, movies, audio plays, and other random, obscure micro-entries… and the franchise isn’t even done yet, as it’s slated to continue in full force later this year! Suffice it to say that when I set out to consume nearly 2200 micro-units of media for review on this blog, I was making a huge commitment of time, energy, and effort, not to mention sacrificing my integrity in the eyes of more conservative mystery readership…\n\nNaturally the project sometimes gets away from me, as I’ve read 15 whole books in the series since I last reviewed it. If it were one or two books I was behind, that’d be one thing, but 15…!? That’s not reasonable at all. I was simply not on top of the project. In order to get myself back on track, I’ve decided to carry out the worst plan in the history of plans and cram 14 reviews into one by going through a lightning round review of all 41(!) stories I’ve read but have yet to cover on the blog…\n\nHurray?\n\nI don’t want to waste too much time on this preamble for a rushed and slapdash review, so without much further ado, let’s start with…\n\nVolume 16 (1997)\n\nVolume 16 only fully starts on Chapter 4 with Casebook 043 – Elementary School Mystery Case (Chapters 4-5), a Junior Detective League case borrowing from Japanese schoolkid mythology of every school having “seven mysteries”. The Junior Detective League investigates running skeletons and moving statues, but the solution is intentionally silly and not entirely interesting, even if the “motive” is really cute.\n\nCasebook 044 – KAITO KID and the Black Star Case is a landmark case for the series, as it is the first crossover between Detective Conan and Gosho Aoyama’s other series Magic Kaito. Magic Kaito is a heist series about a magician-turned-supercriminal who seeks to steal every gem in the world until he can find the magical jewel that is responsible for his father’s death..! The protagonist, KAITO KID, often crosses over with Conan in heists told from the detective’s perspective, and this blend of heist fiction and classical detection results in an exceptionally fun and outstandingly unique story in this franchise. A+!\n\nCasebook 045 – Famous Potter Murder Case (Chapters 10-2) involves a famous potter and his proteges excitedly showing the famous Detective Richard Moore their work when the potter’s daughter-in-law accidentally breaks his magnum opus… She’s naturally torn-up with grief, so when she dies by hanging in the shed the very next day, when everyone was together in the living room of the house with an alibi, it’s determined that her death must’ve been a suicide…\n\nMy biggest gripe with Conan alibi tricks is that the cases tend to get lazy by giving everyone a perfect alibi, highlighting the very existence of an alibi trick and making the tricks less functional and more obvious as a consequence. What’s here is a decent idea for a trick, but the cracks on the foundation become more apparent when your set-up shouts “hey, everybody look! Alibi here! There’s an alibi trick here!”. Some later Conan stories handle this better. Middle of the line story.\n\nVolume 16 is fairly unremarkable if not for the exceptional KAITO KID case. It’s hard to recommend the volume on the weight of one story alone, but it is a landmark, so I’d suggest checking out the anime adaptation of this story to get context for future KAITO KID crossovers (of which there will be many)\n\nVolume 17 (1997)\n\nVolume 17 opens with Casebook 046 – Scuba Divers Attempted Murder Case (Chapters 3-5), in which a bride-to-be almost drowns after being bitten by a rare, poisonous sea-snake! But a chance observation by Conan, as well as Richard’s ex-wife Eri, leads to the realization that this seeming “accident” way well be murder.\n\nThe motive for this one requires a little tolerance for what is and isn’t taboo in other cultures, but it’s actually a really good plot with a smart visual clue. It recalls the last Attempted Murder case in Casebook 21 – Poisoned Bride Attempted Murder Case (Volume 8, Chapters 8-10) in that it involves a tragic misunderstanding that is resolved by the end of the case. I think the resolution works better in this case than that one, but this isn’t as good a mystery. Still, a really solid one!\n\nCasebook 047 – Hospitalized Robber Case (Chapter 6) isn’t very interesting. It’s Die Hard but condensed into a single chapter of Detective Conan. My least favorite story in the series. Next.\n\nCasebook 048 – Mysterious Clocks Mystery Case (Chapters 7-9) is a Junior Detective League code-cracker, only instead of the Junior Detective League it’s Conan and the Moores… Even if the JDL are absent, the case about a mysterious house where all of the clocks go off at once isn’t interesting or fair, giving it the same standard of plotting as those JDL stories… Also underwhelming.\n\nCasebook 049 – Historical Actor Case (Chapters 10-2) sees Richard Moore summoned by an actor well-known for period pieces to act as reference for an upcoming detective film, but when they all witness the murder of his wife in the next-door apartment, Conan has to find a wrinkle in the open-and-shut case against the tenant… The case isn’t entirely original, as it recalls a particular Ellery Queen story, but it’s still a decently fun case that I enjoy well enough, with a pretty solid spatial trick.\n\nVolume 17 seems split evenly between the good and the bad, but the bad stories are actually quite short. If you’re willing to pick up Volume 18 to finish Historical Actor Case, Volume 17 is a worthwhile addition for signed-on fans of the franchise!\n\nVolume 18 (1997)\n\nAfter finishing Historical Actor Murder Case, Volume 18 opens with Case 050 – Jimmy’s First Love Attempted Murder Case (Chapters 3-5), in which a fire starts from the inside of a house with a young woman inside, even though all of her friends were out at the time, singing karaoke miles away and in full view of each other…\n\nAnother “all of the suspects have an alibi” one, but the trick here is actually a really unique method of lighting a fire with an alibi, so it stands out from other, similarly-structured cases! A pretty cute and novel short form case, and one of the better stories from the series!\n\nCase 051 – Lady in Black Kidnapping Case (Chapters 7-8) is another “thriller with logic” case involving the Junior Detective League involving the kidnapping of one of their classmates’ brother… It introduces Anita, an important character, but the case is otherwise not interesting at all and teases plot developments that don’t pan out.\n\nCase 052 – University Professor Murder Case (Chapters 9-1) is a locked-room mystery in which Anita and Conan visit a university professor to retrieve Black Organization contraband, only to find the professor murdered in his locked-and-sealed office…\n\nThis is a unique take on the locked-room mystery because the case all but tells you from the get-go that the solution is a specific kind of string trick, and what the string trick was. However, the solution leaves another problem: how did the string escape from the room? I didn’t like the case at first because the string trick is rather silly, but once I realized the point was more the mystery of the disappearing string I lightened on it a lot. It’s actually a pretty novel locked-room mystery that I enjoy! Easy recommendation.\n\nVolume 18 is a pretty solid entry into the series that’s worth checking out if you’re a signed-on fan. Not only does it contribute important plot development (something I don’t care about because it’s the most glacial narrative in the history of writing, but…), but it also has two pretty good cases bookending it. It isn’t one of the all-time great volumes, but a pretty good one worth checking out.\n\nVolume 19 (1997)\n\nAfter giving us the conclusion chapter to University Professor Murder Case, Volume 19 starts with Casebook 053 – Mystery Writer Kidnapping Case (Chapters 2-4), in which a mystery author appears to be leaving clues to his kidnapping in his serialized manuscript. Another boring code-cracker, which involves knowledge of three(!) languages to solve, and is just as tenuous and unbelievable as always.\n\nCasebook 054 – Stabbed Wallets Murder Case (Chapters 5-8) has Conan visit Harley’s home of Osaka, where a serial killer with a bizarre M.O. is on the loose: first, he strangles his victims, and then he stabs their wallets…\n\nNot a very interesting case for the first proper “serial killer” story, involving a tenuous “missing link” that makes no sense and reveals a pretty nonsensical motive for the killers. There’s one solid trick in the mix, but it’s a pretty unremarkable story, silly and unambitious.\n\nCasebook 055 – Stadium Indiscriminate Threatening Case (Chapters 9-1) is a Junior Detective League story, but is more of a “thriller with logic” case as a man holds a stadium of over 26,000 soccer fans hostage with a bomb threat in exchange for millions of yen! Despite being a “thriller with logic” case, which are rarely fair, this one is pretty solid for being surprisingly fairplay with its solution and having some neat, clever developments. Not my kind of story personally, but pretty solid for what it is.\n\nVolume 19 is one of the weaker volumes of the series so far, and it’s not even close. Despite the fairly decent Stadium Indiscriminate Threatening Case, nothing here stands out as worth going out of your way to read, nor is it important to read for context into the overarching narrative. Wholly skippable.\n\nVolume 20 (1998)\n\nCasebook 056 – KAITO KID and the Magic Lovers Murder Case (Chapters 2-6) is a fan-favorite of many Detective Conan fans, including TomCat of Beneath the Stains of Time, but I wasn’t as enamored with it. This no-footprints-in-the-snow mystery involving a murder at a meeting of an online magician fangroup has an overly technical, machine-based solution that doesn’t really do it for me. The solution represents a type of trick most people immediately think of when thinking about murders committed in snow without leaving footprints, too…\n\nAlso, KAITO KID hardly figures into the story. Don’t get excited, all 1 of you Magic Kaito fans…\n\nCase 057 – Sealed Bathroom Murder Case (Chapters 7-9) has Richard Moore and Conan on the scene when a woman breaks into her taped-shut bathroom to find that her sister has committed suicide within….!\n\nThe solution and set-up are lifted entirely from Clayton Rawson’s landmark locked-room mystery story “From Another World”. There’s a neat touch with how Conan identifies the killer, a brilliant fatal visual clue that’d function well in an inverted mystery, but the locked-room mystery’s shameless pilfering knocks this story down a lot.\n\nCase 058 – Blue Castle Murder Case (Chapters 10-3) is a four-chapter long JDL code-cracking case with a lot of padding and failed attempts at horror and suspense. The code is fair for English-speakers for once, but it still makes for an unremarkable story. We’ve been getting too many of these code-crackers…\n\nVolume 20 is another pretty underwhelming and not very good volume in the series that isn’t worth seeking out to read in my opinion. Unremarkable all the way down.\n\nVolume 21 (1998)\n\nCasebook 059 – Jimmy’s First Murder Case (Chapters 4-7) has Rachel falling asleep on an airplane, reminiscing on the first murder case Jimmy (Conan) ever solved, also on an airplane… a case in which an unsavory tabloid photographer is murdered in a bathroom after boasting about the compromising photos he’s gotten of a prominent American politician!\n\nThe case offers some cute lore for Conan as a character, and is all-around a pretty well-written, well-plotted detective story with a fun alibi trick at its heart. The disappearing weapon element isn’t very interesting, and recalls an earlier story in the series, but the rest of the case is pure, good, un-gimmicky mystery plotting. Good stuff!\n\nCasebook 060 – Treadmill Murder Case (Chapters 8-10) is the first in a series of stories called “Police Love Story” about the will-they-won’t-they romance between police detectives Wataru Takagi and Miwako Sato.\n\nA semi-inverted mystery about Conan suspecting a man of murdering his wife, even though the man was at the police station when the crime occurred, the technical trick here isn’t very interesting, and a variation of a classification of trick the series is obsessed with… It’s a somewhat okay-ish variation on the concept, since it relies on environmental elements of which you are aware, but it’s not a favorite.\n\nCasebook 061 – Wedding Day Murder Case (Chapters 11-3) is a pretty underwhelming and bogstandard locked-room mystery about a butler being murdered in a locked-room. There’s a decent double-bluff at the end with a string trick being proffered as a false solution, but the true solution is still an old dodge. However, I enjoyed the way the killer misdirected away from the trick, making this an unremarkable locked-room mystery but a decently smartly-done whodunit.\n\nVolume 21 is better than the previous two volumes, with a higher average of quality, but is still not quite good enough to unambiguously recommend. If you’re a signed-on fan, I can say this is a decent volume worth your time, but people only looking for the highlights should just look for the anime adaptation of Jimmy’s First Murder Case.\n\nVolume 22 (1998)\n\nCasebook 062 – North Star Murder Case (Chapters 4-7) focuses on a professional robber who, after bungling a jewelry store robbery, murders the owner of the store on a train before impossible vanishing from a guarded compartment… All of which reminds Conan of an unpublished mystery manuscript written by his father!\n\nThe solution to this impossible disappearance isn’t very interesting, as it’s obvious and the clues are rather crude. I appreciate the framing device of excerpts from the father’s manuscript highlighting pivotal moments in the case, but the manuscript’s connection to the case is boring and hand-waved away. Not a very good one at all.\n\nCase 063 – Serena Attempted Murder Case (Chapters 8-10) sees Serena, Rachel’s long-time best friend, the target of a serial killer who murders young blondes! If you can’t see the conclusion to this cheap dime-store thriller-esque narrative coming from a mile away, I don’t know what to tell you. Corny and not interesting.\n\nVolume 22 contains no full stories worth reading, and doesn’t finish a very good story either. Not worth reading at all, and one of the worst volumes we’ve seen in a long time.\n\nVolume 23 (1998)\n\nCasebook 064 – Movie Theater Murder Case (Chapters 1-3) sees rotten real estate agent murdered inside of a failing movie theater after boasting about shutting the place down! His dead body is hung in front of the projection’s booth in the middle of the movie theater’s swansong marathon of every Gomera movie, in the attendance of which was none other than Conan and the Junior Detective League…\n\nThis is my second favorite Detective Conan case of all time so far, as it’s brilliant from top-to-bottom. The movie theater setting is exploited to produce a truly brilliant and unique alibi-trick, with some of the series’ best visual clues to top it all off. The Junior Detective League are restrained and quite helpful in this case too, allowing the story to side-step a lot of the typical pitfalls of JDL-centric plots.\n\nFantastic little setting-oriented mystery story, unambiguous recommendation!\n\nCasebook 065 – Cruise Ship Murder Case (Chapters 4-9) is the first proper long-form case we’ve seen in a while, focusing on a cruise ship where the vengeful, once-thought-dead former head of a crime group is thought to soon resurface… And, naturally, in his wake he leaves many corpses!\n\nThis isn’t my favorite long-form Conan, as the trick at the heart of this one is a crude artifice I’ve seen and gotten bored of elsewhere, but despite the unambitious trick this is still a smartly-plotted, well-written detective story with tight reasoning that is plenty worth reading! Really good stuff!\n\nCasebook 066 – Innocent Suspect Case (Chapters 10-2) is another entry into the Police Love Story series, in which Miwako Sato is handcuffed to the escaped suspect in a murder case in a bathroom! Despite the fact the man was alone in his locked-and-sealed apartment with the victim, he insists he’s innocent, and the two police officers decide to do a little more inquiring into the case with the Junior Detective League…\n\nSurprisingly, another pretty good Junior Detective League murder case. The core trick at the heart of this Judas Window-esque locked-room mystery is silly in a very natural and believable way, and I actually kind of found myself being amused at not seeing the solution ahead of time. I wonder if I’d like this one as much returning to it, but as it stands I thought this was an amusing and comical take on the problem even if the melodrama of Sato being handcuffed to a toilet in a building that’s soon to be demolished unnecessary.\n\nVolume 23 is one of the best volumes in the series so far! This is the first volume containing three stories in which I think all three stories are truly good and worth reading, and it contains my second favorite story in the whole franchise! Absolutely check this one out, it’s good stuffs, this!\n\nVolume 24 (1998)\n\nCasebook 067 – Blackout Murder Case (Chapters 3-6) is an unfortunately unremarkable story on the heels of Volume 23. As Richard is consulting a client, a man winds up electrocuted to death in a bathtub after a blackout! But who could’ve committed the murder, and how!\n\nThe murder method is one I’ve seen repeated in a few other stories, and the alibi “trick” shows Conan‘s age, as the tool required to make it work is much more well-known to us in the modern world and something we’d think of immediately. Not great.\n\nCasebook 068 – Hotel Party Case (Chapters 7-11) sees Anita and Conan tailing a member of the Black Organization to a hotel party, whereupon they’re chased down by grunts from the group following a seemingly-impossible murder committed in the dark!\n\nThis is a plot relevant case, so naturally is of interest to those who care about that sort of thing, but as an independent murder murder is quite thin and unmemorable. Not worth reading unless you’re invested in the overarching story of Detective Conan.\n\nSadly another short and unpleasant volume not worth going out of your way to read unless you’re a signed-on fan of the overarching narrative of the series. Supposedly, Gosho Aoyama starts to shift his focus away from disconnected murder plots to more connected stories, so I wonder if that’ll cause my interest in the individual cases to dwindle going forward…\n\nVolume 25 (1999)\n\nCasebook 069 – Skating Rink Murder Case (Chapters 1-3) sees a woman shot to death in the bathroom of a skating rink during a fireworks show. Sure enough, she has a dying message in her hands implicating a friend of hers, but when the friend is revealed to be entirely innocent Conan is forced to figure out who would want to commit this murder and frame the friend…\n\nThe dying message repurposes a trick used earlier in the series, but the dodge here is equally effective as there is really smart psychological trick played here to give the killer a false alibi! As I’ve never used the tool used to produce the alibi, I think it’s probably a little unconvincing, but the forced association trick at the heart of this one is really neat in concept. Love it a lot, fantastic little case!\n\nCase 070 – Tottori Spider Mansion Murder Case (Chapters 4-8) sees Harley and Conan investigating a series of suicides instigated by the Spider Mistress’s Curse, which have just recently been bookended by the impossible murder of a doll-maker in his locked-and-sealed shed, with his entire body strung up in a spiderweb-like arrangement of string…\n\nThe core murder method recalls a Father Brown tale, and it’s a murder method repurposed in a certain famous Kindaichi Case Files story… but an extra twist is put on the knot with a really smart piece of misdirection involving the state of the body and the spider imagery that disguises a pretty brilliant piece of alibi trickery which elevates the story beyond the fact it (obviously, from the set-up) turns on a variation of string trickery. Throw into the mix a haunting aesthetic and tragic motive, and you’ve got yourself a pretty great Detective Conan locked-room mystery!\n\nCase 071 – Cave Murder Case (9-1) is another Junior Detective League code-cracking in which the kids need to solve a riddle to escape from a cave before they’re murdered by a group of thugs whose murder they’ve just witnessed. Putting Conan out of commission to force the JDL to reason for themselves was a smart idea, but they end up guessing instead of reasoning, making the set-up feel wasted and their victory unearned. Not very interesting or good.\n\nAnother fantastic volume with two all-time great cases! Although Cave Murder Case is disappointing, Skating Rink and Tottori Spider Mansion are two fantastic mystery plots that both begin and end within this volume. Unambiguous recommendation for this volume for those two exceptional stories!\n\nVolume 26 (1999)\n\nCasebook 072 – School Play Murder Case has an attendee of the high school play be poisoned by his drink… This is a really well-clued and well-written detective story, a fact sorely undercut by the fact the solution turns on a trick that has passed from cliche on to riddle on to punchline since its conception. It’s a shame, too, because some smart reasoning shows up in the denouement of this one…\n\nCasebook 073 – Restaurant Elevator Murder Case is another inverted mystery from Detective Conan, in which a man murders his soon-to-be father-in-law in an elevator while using his wife as an alibi.\n\nThis is actually a really solid inverted mystery, with the killer being caught on a brilliant Furuhata Ninzaburou-styled slip of the tongue trap, but the fact the case has to share room with Conan (Jimmy) and Rachel’s romance plot does mean the investigation is a little thinner than I prefer, making the killer come off as a bit of a trivial pushover. Still, really good one, even if it falls behind the franchise’s better inverted mysteries.\n\nCasebook 074 – Music Box Mystery Case (Chapters 8-10) sees a young woman attempting to figure out the secrets behind an apparently valuable music box her dead pen pal left her, despite the fact the antique shop says it’s worthless…\n\nThe story that follows ends up just being Scooby-Doo but played 100% seriously and with none of the humor of whimsy. Unremarkable.\n\nVolume 26 does mark a sudden shift to more plot-relevant cases, as the first two cases each try to move along Jimmy and Rachel’s romance, and in both cases it does seem to come at the expense of the story. While the first two cases are decent and solid respectively, I can’t recommend wholeheartedly you go out of your way to read this volume unless you’re a dedicated fan of the series as-is. If you are a Detective Conan fan, though, this isn’t a terrible volume that could be worth picking up to fill some holes in your reading.\n\nVolume 27 (1999)\n\nCasebook 075 – Suspect Richard Moore Murder Case (Chapters 1-3) has Richard Moore become the prime suspect in a murder after the woman he drunkenly hooked up with was murdered in her locked and sealed hotel room! His separated wife and lawyer, Eri, sees to the investigation to prove him innocent…\n\nThe trick at the heart of this one is a pretty unremarkable variation of the kind of gimmick we’ve seen a few times within and without this series, so it wasn’t a very interesting case. The way the killer was caught is fun, but didn’t elevate the case any at all.\n\nCasebook 076 – Sato’s Father Murder Case (Chapters 4-6) is another Police Love Story case, as well as a Junior Detective League case focusing on arson! Unfortunately, the code-cracking is, as always, unfair, tenuous, and unfun. The “parallel plots” reveal at the end is kind of amusing, but minor.\n\nCasebook 077 – Arcade Murder Case (Chapters 7-9) sees a brutish bully murdered at an arcade in the middle of a career-defining match in a virtual reality fighting game! Only, of course, with everyone’s eyes on the game, there are no witnesses as to who may or may not have murdered the gamer…\n\nThis is actually another exceptionally good case. Although it might be somewhat easy to see through the core deception, the trick at the heart of this is novel, unique, and informed brilliantly by the video game setting. It is a much more clever utilization of video games than the disappointing Mantendo Bombing Case from Volume 12. Despite the ease with which some people will see through the alibi trick, Arcade Murder Case is easily my new third favorite case, with a unique plot informed by a unique setting.\n\nCasebook 078 – Bear Hunter Murder Case (Chapters 10-2) is a Junior Detective League case in which Mitch and Anita flee from a murderer whose crime they’ve witnessed! Unable to come out into the open without being shot, Anita is forced to come up with a message to communicate with Conan so he can save their lives…\n\nThe misunderstanding behind the motive makes this a surprisingly sweet story, but the clues and plot are otherwise rather unremarkable. Decent motive misdirection, but not impressive in any other way.\n\nVolume 27, sadly, wasn’t a great volume. Arcade Murder Case is an exceptionally novel murder mystery, but the other three stories don’t make the volume worth recommending for one case alone. I recommend everyone go check out the anime version of Arcade Murder Case as soon as possible, as it’s truly a wonderful case!\n\nVolume 28 (1999-2000)\n\nCasebook 079 – Old Photograph Murder Case (Chapters 3-5) has Richard commissioned by an old lady who seems to lie about insignificant things to find an old friend of hers to recover a photograph he accidentally took from her. When the friend is located, however, he is found murdered inside of his apartment after having eaten breakfast…\n\nThe alibi trick at the heart of this one recalls my favorite episode of Alibi-Cracking, At Your Service, and can be seen as a forebear to that exceptional episode. While it’s still a very clever idea in Detective Conan, I found this variation of the trick less impressive or convincing. Not that it’s a bad case by any means, I think it’s a pretty fun short-form murder mystery. It’s just somewhat inferior to another, similar story.\n\nCasebook 080 – Mermaid’s Curse Murder Case (Chapters 6-10) has Harley and Conan investigating a letter from a woman who claims to be cursed to die by mermaids after she lost a talisman purported to grant eternal life… In investigating the woman’s disappearance, they explore an island with bizarre mermaid-worshipping religious practices and an annual celebration that results in three more murders…\n\nThere really isn’t much of a meaningful misdirection to speak of outside of a fairly clever double-bluff about the identity of one of the victims. This case revolves around a trick that I’ve always found to be somewhat corny and uninteresting, and it’s a rather unambitious variation of it too. It’s also a somewhat inferior long-form case as regards the plotting and cluing. Sadly not much better than decent despite its good reputation.\n\nCasebook 081 – Girl Clubbing Murder Case (Chapters 11-2) is a serial killing case about a man killing ganguro (dark make-up) girls in a department store. The motivation is absurd, and the only noteworthy part of the story is one piece of misdirection about the killer’s body type and the attempt to give Inspector Meguire some development. A fairly mediocre case.\n\nAnother middle of the line Volume with a couple of decent moments but nothing unambiguously worth going out of your way to read. I don’t recommend this to any but the most dedicated of hardcore Conan fans looking to fill in some gaps in their reading.\n\nVolume 29 (2000)\n\nCasebook 082 – Bus Hijacking Case (Chapters 3-5) is a somewhat interesting “which-of-the-three” case in which Conan realizes that one of three people sitting in the back seat of a bus are communicating to a group of bus hijackers, but it’s impossible to tell how they’re communicating.\n\nUnfortunately, what follows is more of a “thriller with logic” case, with pretty thin investigation/cluing into the culprit’s identity and not very memorable in resolution. Mediocre.\n\nCasebook 083 – Dog Lover Kidnapping Case (Chapters 6-8) has a rare purebred dog kidnapped from a house of dog-lovers, and Conan on the case to discover who the culprit is.\n\nThere’s one somewhat neat clue surrounding the whereabouts of the dog, but the motive and method leave this story feeling plain and uninspired.\n\nCasebook 048 – 3 K’s of Osaka Murder Case (Chapters 9-11) sees three western celebrities visiting Osaka for an event, when a murder is committed inside of a hotel in which the three men were alone! However, all three men have alibis proven by the fact they were turning lights on and off in front of hundreds of witnesses, making this crime impossible…!\n\nThe set-up is a really neat lead-in to an impossible alibi situation, but the resolution is underwhelming and flat-out unbelievable. This is a fan favorite case for the way it develops Conan’s character, but as a mystery it’s mediocre and middle of the line.\n\nWe finish off this long 14-part review with one final unremarkable volume, with not a good story worth going out of your way to read or watch in any form…\n\nOverall, this batch of 14 is far from being the most consistent in the series. A lot of mediocre and underwhelming stories interspersed with a fair bit of good and truly fantastic cases leave this section of cases feeling balanced (or, perhaps, mixed…).\n\nSpecial notice to Volume 23, which is truly exceptional and contains my second favorite case in the series, and Volume 25 which contains two great stories well-worth reading, including a terrific impossible crime! Add to the mix my third favorite case in Arcade Murder Case, and we still see plenty of truly good cases coming out of this series well worth seeking out for fans of classical detection!\n\nTo wrap up this long post, my ranking of all 84 stories we’ve read so far… My 5-point system has been expanded to a 10-point system in order to better account for more nuance between similarly-enjoyed stories.\n\n*Newly reviewed cases are italicized and bookended with asterisks*\n\n{10/10 — Favorites}\n\n1.)

Amy Kidnapping Case (Case 022, V. 9, Ch. 1-3)\n\n*84.) Hospitalized Robber Case (Case 047, V. 17, Ch. 6)*\n\nHaving solved the mysterious murders of The Kirisaki Island Tragedy in the previous volume, and officially passing the Dan Detective School Entrance Exam, the examinees return to mainland Japan. Here, Japan’s most famous living sleuth Dan Morihiko announces the formation of the “Qualifying Class”, or “Q Class”, a specially-designed curriculum for only the most prospective students from which Dan plans to pick his most suitable successor!\n\nThe very first assignment for the Q Class involves a recent disappearance from the Kamikakushi village. Based on his footprints, university student on a school research trip seemed to mysterious step out of his window of the inn at which he stayed, walk 30 meters into the center of a muddy, unplanted rice field, and then vanish into mid-air! Proving their case-cracking bonafides by easily solving this impossible crime, Q Class soon learns that this is only the latest in a long series of similar vanishings in the village and its neighboring village of Hyoutan and Kamikakushi, two lonely villages nestled in a mountain range, and they’re expected to get to the bottom of the case!\n\nHyoutan Village and Kamikakushi Village are in fact quite isolated civilizations, as to get to Hyoutan requires a 30 minute walk through a tunnel from a bus-stop, and the only way into Kamikakushi is another 30 minute walk through another, spiraled tunnel that only attaches to Hyoutan. Worse yet, the village of Kamikakushi is ruled by a cult who worships a God of Disease, represented by masks representing smallpox, so when a crew of reporters hunting for a treasure fabled to exist in one of the two villages has one of their members murdered and buried in a graveyard, it’s immediately assumed to be the work of the very same God of Disease.\n\nThe village of Kamikakushi requires everyone wear masks to walk around the village, so with only two masks to spare the students of Q Class are forced to split up. The aloof prodigy Ryuu teams up with Megumi, the girl with identic memory, to bring the investigation to Kamikakushi, while hyper-active protagonist Kyuu, athlete Kinta, and computer wizz-cum-game developer Kazuma stay in Hyoutan, with the two groups only able to communicate through the phones in the inns in each village. As more mysterious murders pile up, like the impossible flying of a reporter before being dropped to his death, Class Q is on a race against the clock with the constant threat of their own potential murders hanging over them in Case 3 – Class Begins Detective School” (Chapters 14-16) and Case 4 – “The Kamikakushi Village Murder Case” (Chapters 17-29) of Detective School Q.\n\nThis is the case of Detective School Q. Fans of the series point to this one as being quintessentially emblematic of the franchise in every way, as well as being the creme de la creme of all of its many cases. Sure, there are many great cases in this manga, but “The Kamikakushi Village Murder Case” is the Great Case of all of Detective School Q if you ask many of its enjoyers. Is this necessarily true, though…?\n\nThe transitionary case between “The Tragedy of Kirisaki Island” and “The Kamikakushi Village Murder Case”, “Class Begins at Detective School” is a simple three-chapter case dealing simultaneously with the aftermath of the former while setting up the latter. This sort of “mini-case” between two large cases is quite common in Detective School Q, as it is a series with a consistent inter-connected narrative rather than every murder occurring within a continuity bubble, so of course there needs to be seamless transitions between the cases. That being said, as “Class Begins at Detective School” concerns itself with the serial killing of “The Kamikakushi Village Murder Case”, the two can be considered as one story.\n\nThe impossible disappearance of a student from the middle of a field at the end of a track of footprints is a decently creative but ultimately minor technical trick which I’ve seen performed in a more audacious form in another manga series. Like the more Ellery Queenian crime in “The Detective School Entrance Exam“, it’s still impressive that such a crime could be fit into such a small page count, but it isn’t particularly noteworthy otherwise. It instead merely serves as a stepping stone into the principle murders of the case proper.\n\nAs for the actual “Kamikakushu Village Murder Case”, it seems as if its immense reputation is one not unlike Shimada Soji’s landmark The Tokyo Zodiac Murders: a technically weakly-constructed story, elevated by the cussed audacity of its central trick. The story has a somewhat similar issue to the one I complained about in my review of “The Legend of Lake Hiren“ from The Kindaichi Case Files, another impossible crime manga Amagi Seimaru worked on. That is to say, the story ultimately feels very loose, due to over-loading the puzzle and cluing into one of the murders while the multiple other murders merely exist in respect to that one. This often leads to a somewhat awkward feeling mystery tale in which one particular crime is dense, but long stretches of time are spent with trivial crimes with few to none important clues.\n\nWithin “The Kamikakushi Village Murder Case”, there are three murders. The first isn’t even passingly mentioned in the denouement, with its only contribution to the narrative being to provide a clue. The second murder is an impossible murder with the very interesting impression of a victim flying into the air based on his video recording, but the trick is explained nearly immediately and isn’t incredibly impressive, being a variation on the exact kind of trick you’d expect for this kind of impossible crime. This naturally means the third crime, in which a man accused of the murder challenges the detectives to explain how he could commit a murder soon-to-occur while provided with an impossible alibi, is clearly designated as the “important crime”, and naturally almost all of the clues pertaining to the killer’s identity and the grand central trick of the story are primarily explored through the investigation into this murder.\n\nUntil this murder is committed, there is very little in the way of cluing to speak of. The story is especially light on visual clues, disappointingly underutilizing Megumi and her identic memory which often contributes to smart visual clues in the rest of the series. At most, there is a code that gives a little (very important) history on the true nature of the two villages. It’s a trend that often leads to the mysteries feeling “thinner” than their length, and “The Kamikakushi Village Murder Case” would certainly benefit from trimming out the second impossible murder and cutting four or so chapters off of its runtime.\n\nBut don’t get the wrong idea! “The Kamikakushi Village Murder Case” swings for the fences in a very major way, and like The Tokyo Zodiac Murders, is a worthy classic because of how well it works when it does work. Although Megumi is poorly utilized, this story still does a great job depicting the many ways the varied skill sets of the Q Class work towards establishing the solution. Kinta’s raw intuitive perception, Kazuma’s access to the immense well of information the internet provides, Kyuu’s pure creativity, and Ryuu’s simple brilliance all contribute their own unique pieces to the puzzle.\n\nBetter yet is the central mystery. There is a very important clue involving a piece of paper with the infinity symbol written on it (or maybe it’s a side-ways letter 8? Or a gourd?). This audacious visual clue goes a long way in revealing the central mystery behind the murders in the Kamikakushi villages. A central mystery which is utterly brilliant, by the way, revealing one of the ambitious alibi tricks of the entire genre. It’s an alibi trick so large in scale that it’s baffling, fitting the many comparisons drawn to Shimada Soji’s work. It’s a trick that not only provides the killer with a damnable alibi, but it’s one which offers a compelling, unique, and mystifying motive for the mysteries and offering a compelling conclusion to the cult of the God of Disease. The weight of the denouement is immense, highlighting all of the strengths of the case, while compensating for many of its structural weaknesses.\n\nIn the end “The Kamikakushi Village Murder Case” ended up a very similar beast to The Tokyo Zodiac Murders. Boasting flawed and awkward construction, the story nonetheless elevates itself with nothing less than the raw ingenuity of its final trick, one which borders on reality manipulation pure and simple. Trimming down the case would’ve done it wonders, but that doesn’t stop “The Kamikakushi Village Murder Case” from rising above the sum of its parts. While I highly doubt that I’ll walk away considering this the best of the best of the best of Detective School Q, I can safely see that it might very well have the best idea for a central trick in the series, and I can’t deny walking away happy with reading the story!\n\nHey, two-for-two! Detective School Q‘s reputation for consistent is clearly well-earned, as both of its full and proper cases have been at least very good. I do hate being negative about this case like I had been, because really it does justify itself in what it becomes, but with the awkward trend that Amagi had maintained from working on The Kindaichi Case Files it really did end up losing a bit of the greatness it could’ve had. I especially feel bad because I know many people consider this the absolute height of the series, and I don’t like being a party-pooper with stories people really like. The core trick really is something great, so I feel its place in my ranking is justified, but consider it tentative and reluctant and it might be re-evaluated as I read on in the series.\n\nThe Kamikakushi Village Murder Case (Chapters 17-29)\n\nThe Tragedy of Kirisaki Island (Chapters 4-13)\n\nClass Begins at Detective School (Chapters 14-16)\n\nDetective School Entrance Exam (Chapters 1-3)\n\nKyuu isn’t very good at schoolwork. It isn’t that he’s dumb, or that he struggles to learn in an academic setting. Quite the opposite in fact, he simply doesn’t try! Kyuu is a genius trained by an unnamed famous detective whose chosen career path has nothing to do with the classes at his normal high-school: he wants to become the world’s next Great Detective, following in the footsteps of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot. To that end, Kyuu decides to forego life as an everyday high-schooler looking to become an everyday salaryman, and instead enroll in the highly exclusive and wildly competitive Dan Detective School, founded by Japan’s most famous living sleuth Morihiko Dan!\n\nWhen Kyuu arrives at the Entrance Exam, he discovers that the task of the prospective students is to solve an old real-world murder, based on nothing but two photographs — one taken by the victim and the other the police — and six suspects (played by staff from the school). The victim is a master of Judo who was stabbed in his rental cottage in a snowy January, and six suspects were located, all having motives, no alibis, and were staying at a hotel across the lake from the victim. With the help of the identic memory of his new ally Megumi, Kyuu is able to immediately spot who he believes is the culprit and the two, together with other exam-takers, are then tasked with trailing their pick in Case 1 – “Detective School Entrance Exam” (Chapters 1-3), the beginning of shin-honkaku manga series Detective Academy Q by Amagi Seimaru.\n\nEagle-eyed readers of the blog might recognize Amagi Seimaru’s name by its frequent mention in the comments sections of my blog posts on reviews of the impossible crime manga (comic books) The Kindaichi Case Files. That franchise is itself split into many sub-series, the first of which is predominantly credited to the writing of Yōzaburō Kanari. However, starting with the second series, the writing credit is given exclusively to Amagi Seimaru, who was originally a co-writer and editor under Kanari. Very many The Kindaichi Case Files fans consider Amagi the superior writer between the two, finding the many series written under him to be on average better and more consistent in quality than the original Kanari run, an opinion shared by TomCat of Beneath the Stains of Time and more hesitantly by Ho-Ling of Ho-Ling no Jikenbo. More popular than the opinion that the Amagi-run Kindaichi Case Files series are better than the Kanari-run ones, though, is the opinion that Amagi Seimaru’s original mystery manga series also focusing on impossible crimes and locked-room mysteries, Detective School Q, is even better than those, and more consistent at that! Well, that sounds promising, giving my spurt of underwhelming Kindaichi Case File reads recently…\n\nThis is another case where I anticipate I’ll never be able to get the old-guard involved in reading the series (but what do I know? I’ve successfully converted some readers of Detective Conan, after all…). Admittedly, the premise is very kiddish and the tone follows suit. Lots of unfunny prat-falls and lame jokes typical in shounen (young boy) manga, almost cringe-inducing energy and endless melodrama over trivial things, and the incredibly juvenile concept of a detective-creating academy definitely reek of bad kid fiction.\n\nOn that note, though, something I’ve proselytized about a lot on this blog is that in Japan “kid fiction” is usually an indictment on the complexity of language and a few storytelling trends, and very little else. So-called “young boy” fiction tend to involve fantastical and melodramatic stories involving inordinately skilled school-age children, but besides that you can’t count on anything being quite how you expect. These “young boy” stories are capable of telling stories as complex or mature as “adult” stories, and frequently do! The demographic is mostly about accessibility, and is rarely used as an excuse to make something sub-par because it’s “for kids”. Hell, even subject matter is rarely policed as much as it is in the English-speaking world (when “kid stories” from Japan get translated into English, it isn’t uncommon for them to get as high as TV-Mature, or 18+, ratings, for instance).\n\nI bring this up because, yeah, the first arc of Detective School Q, “The Detective School Exam“, would have turned me away from the manga immediately if I didn’t both have assurance the series was good or have foreknowledge of the potential of so-called “kid fiction” from Japan.\n\nOf course, in retrospect, “The Detective School Exam” is important as it establishes a few elements that will become the core of this series. Firstly, it introduces us to the central group of detectives, who each specialize in different areas that make up for the weaknesses of their classmates. Kintarō “Kinta” Tōyama has no common sense and isn’t very intelligent, but he has superb 20/10 vision and preternatural intuitive skills. Kyuu has neither discipline nor book smarts, but his deductive reasoning and creativity recalls history’s best detectives, and usually allow for him to be the one to piece everything together in the end. In fact, the specialty of Megumi Minami is central to the way Detective School Q takes advantage of its medium. Her borderline supernaturally acute “photographic” (identic) memory is essentially a giant signpost telegraphing to the audience that visual clues, clues not called attention to by the text but instead planted in the drawings of the comic book, will be part of the series. This is an aspect of Detective Conan or The Kindaichi Case Files that equally well takes advantage of its visual medium, but Megumi’s inclusion also permits for visual clues that don’t need to be addressed immediately, as it’ll be possible for other characters to “revisit” scenes later through her memory. It allows for visual clues that are more subtle and specific, and yet still fairplay while also not as bluntly telegraphed.\n\nOutside of this, however? The core murder mystery is set-up in less than five pages, explored very little past that, quickly resolved, and explained in a few pages in the next chapter. Don’t get me wrong, the Ellery Queenian chain of detective is impressive, being a surprisingly dense and smart piece of ratiocination based on a single clue (or absence-of-clue, another trope of Queen’s) for a murder given less than five full pages of focus, and it perfectly sets up the series’ approach to visual clues. But then it being resolved so quickly and compactly also means you spend quite a bite of time in the “trailing the suspect” portion of the story, a semi-Holmsian tale in which the “suspect” constantly tries to elude the protagonists through a variety of tricks, along with other traps laid by the exam coordinators from Dan Detective School. It isn’t incredibly interesting, and a fairly unflattering introduction to the franchise for people who might be worried there’s a little too much anime in their mystery with its many parallels to “Exam Chapters” in other shounen series.\n\n…Which, of course, is the reason why I decided to review these two arcs in one blog post. The running trend has been that the manga series I review start off incredibly underwhelming and take comically long amounts of time before finally picking up and becoming the great pieces of mystery fiction as which they are now known. To start this series off with an underwhelming review of a three-chapter introductory case would not be doing Detective School Q any justice as, like I’d already mentioned, the average quality and consistency in this series is quite high. So, what of Case 2 – “The Tragedy of Kirisaki Island” (4-13)?\n\n“The Tragedy of Kirisaki Island” shifts gears as Kyuu, Kinta, and Megumi clear the first half of the exam. The final part of the entrance test involves journeying to an infamous island well-known for a gruesome series of impossible killings that occurred there many years in the past, committed by a man claiming to be a second-coming of Jack the Ripper himself. The examinees are instructed to solve these historical crimes, but before the test can even begin a member of their examination group is found murdered, inside of a room locked-and-sealed from within… and, just like the original Jack the Ripper killings, he’d been cut in half. And when more murders begin to crop up, each one involving a corpse cut into pieces, the remaining examinees are on the hunt for a vicious killer before they wind up on the chopping block next!\n\nThis is the series’ first proper murder mystery, and unlike both Detective Conan and The Kindaichi Case Files, Detective School Q‘s opener is great. Not only is it great, I’m actually shocked to find that I consider it one of the best mysteries I’ve ever read, and I’m even more shocked to discover that many people don’t even consider this a notable high-point in the series! If “one of the best mysteries I’ve read” is a medium-point in the quality of this franchise, that alone is a te"
