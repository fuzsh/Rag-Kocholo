        "text": "Characters & Voice Actors\n\nStaff\n\nEdit\n\nOpening Theme\n\nNo opening themes have been added to this title. Help improve our database by adding an opening theme here.\n\nReviews\n\nI had watched so many anime make the mistake of rushing plot, character development and chemistry, I was starting believe no one in the anime industry knows how to write human. Although the chemistry and dialogues between The Princess and The Pilot aren't exactly realistic or excellent, it is still a breath of fresh air amongst the gigantic amount of massacred scriptwriting from the anime industry, even more so after a decade.\n\nFor a movie, TP&TP has an extremely well done pacing. Its plot is very short and its main setting is the sea, which is vast and empty. So you may be bored if you're ... looking for some exciting plot with turns and twists. TP&TP is straight as an arrow, and focuses all around developing the two main characters while they're travelling together alone across the vast and empty sea, where not another soul can intervene. All that political drama and dogfights are just side dishes to keep you awake through a slow, organic and self-controlled love story.\n\nThe movie does have a large amount of unrealistic physics and plane designs. Some Disneyland size metal airship can float in the air with just 4 propellers. The princess was swung around in a plane for the first time yet doesn't even puke or pass out. But if we can forgive mecha anime, I think we can chill with this.\n\nAbout cliche, there are some cliche side characters here and there, flashbacks and coincidences that are just like fairy tales, which I think are unnecessary or lazy. But if I ignore those cliche, the essence of the movie, which is the chemistry between the princess and the pilot, is still refreshing enough to separate itself from other anime.\n\nI'm not sure why this movies catches so much flak. I think there are a lot of worse anime movies out there including Ghibli ones, failing to write even half as believable or organic characters, and doesn't even deliver as much emotional conflict. I guess it's due to the moderate amount of excitement, and the \"unentertaining\" ending.\n\nThe Princess and the Pilot has a normal, mature, slow and organic chemistry that can only appreciated by certain audience. It is best you avoid this movie if you're looking for excitement.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI haven't written a review before since there was no reason to because of the abundance of them already but this show just takes the cake for me so I decided to write one. As you can see by the rating I have given this show, I find myself extremely disappointed. I was honestly disappointed with the character development that seemed to be going somewhere only for it to just disappear as if it never happened. The first thing I want to warn is that it is no traditional romance so if that is what you like, don't watch the Movie. The name and the ... 'romance' tag are clickbait but may be subjective to some so read it as you please.\n\nStory-wise, it has a clear and straight-forward plot that is very well explained in the synopsis. The reason I gave the story a 6/10 was because of the abundance of plot armor in the story that somewhat ticked me off but I gave it the benefit of the doubt just because I am interested in what is going to happen next. Secondly was because of the ending. Although this may differ depending on preference, the ending left an extremely sour taste in my mouth. The amount of times I ranted in my mind regarding the ending is innumerable. But I could only blame myself because of that stupid romance tag.\n\nThe art for the movie is one I find extremely beautiful and breath-taking. For a movie that came out in 2011 and watching in 2019, I find the art much more developed for its time (Or maybe that is just me). Hence, it is a no brainer I gave it a 9. Regarding the music and sound in the show, I found it extremely well done and fits really well with the movie.\n\nAnd now for the 5/10. My enjoyment and the character development. My enjoyment is pretty self explanatory for what I have written so far. I would be lying if I said that I enjoyed the movie even by little bit since I didn't. I am literally fuming right now so if there are any grammatical mistakes I apologize. Truthfully, I would have given this a much lower rating instead of a 5/10 if it weren't for the fact that my mental resilience to these kinds of unsatisfied situations that I have built from reading such terrible or bittersweet endings, It would have been 1. But since the art and sound was so good, I gave it a +4.\n\nNow for the character development. All I can say is what the hell. I really wanted the replace the word 'hell' there but i am not sure if it is against the community guidelines to do so because that is just what I thought of the character development by the end of the story. Unfortunately, since I couldn't write about any spoilers, I can't really back my reasoning for the character section because if I can, that is where the rant is going to start and oh boy will it be an additional 1000 words. But all I can say is for a movie with the tag of romance in it, I can't seem to find it. Not even my pet rat can seem to find it. Maybe in the middle of the movie but god damn where is it. Don't get me started with the prince and the other soldiers, but god damn are there a lot of plot armor on them. With the amount of plot armor that the soldiers are carrying, world domination is childs play. Heck, how are their backs not hurting yet from all that carrying.\n\nThus a 5 is a natural result overall. The writer should thank and gift the sound and art department because they really outperformed themselves. If it weren't for their hard work, I would be using the pages from his light novel as tissue paper. If it weren't for a short clip of this movie that I found on youtube with the romance in it then I would have never even known about this crappy movie. But seriously though, the ending is extremely subjective and it seems in a good way hence the 7.72 rating. But ratings isn't what defines a movie, preference does. Sadly, I am not in the upper 99.9% so I don't see the movie that way. All I can say is if you're in it for the romance and the romance you are probably thinking about, exit the page. If you want it for the story then go ahead. This is merely a one in a million other review anyways but I merely just wanted to say my piece. Also, damn if you read every single word of this I applaud. Most people only look at numbers and choose whether to watch it or not.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI want every showrunner of something built around a man and a woman alone together to ask one simple question of it.\n\n\"Whose journey is this?\"\n\nIf it's the man's journey, go nuts.\n\nIf it's the woman's journey and the important parts default to the man's POV, that's ALWAYS boring.\n\nIn this, literally, the woman (a previously sheltered princess) is stranded on an island with the man unconscious because of his battle injuries... Cut to... The man waking up to looking at her breasts because she's wearing a crop top now. AND SHE CUT HER LONG HAIR SHORT OFF-SCREEN.\n\n... WHAT.\n\nI swear to God, if you deny me the opportunity to watch the sheltered girl cut her long hair to symbolize how far she's come on her adventure, that's an instant 4. You can do no better. Go home.\n\nI had no hopes for this movie after a few aborted attempts to watch it where the beginning bored me to tears, but I was in a place where I could stick it out this time. It wasn't worth it.\n\nAfter the BETRAYAL of skipping the hair-cutting scene, there's one scene with promise. The princess has a moment where she chooses to reject her heritage and gets drunk in order to spite it. It was dropped immediately and nothing else even attempted to match that. And it was tepidly based around a supposed attraction between the two that wasn't earned at all.\n\nJust a narrow-minded, poorly-plotted snooze-fest.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for October\n\nHere are the North American anime, manga, and light novel releases for October.
