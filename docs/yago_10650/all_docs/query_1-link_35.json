        "text": "Following the success of the manga series, TMS Entertainment and Toho produced a 12-minute Lupin III anime film adaptation featuring Lupin wearing a red jacket outfit. Masaaki Ōsumi directed the movie, which was made in two different versions: a CinemaScope version intended for theatrical release and a 4:3 television version. The animation for the two versions was mainly the same, but the voice cast was different, with only Kiyoshi Kobayashi and Eiko Masuyama, voicing Daisuke Jigen and Fujiko Mine respectively, in both versions. By the time the pilot was completed in 1969, because of budget concerns and a disagreement between Toho and TMS, the film was never released. Masaaki Ōsumi then moved on to direct several episodes of the first Lupin III television series. The two versions of this pilot film were later released in 1989 as a part of the Lupin III Secret Files collection.\n\nOn October 24, 1971, ytv began airing the first Lupin III television series. The series, was broadcast for 23 episodes, with the last one airing on March 26, 1972. The first seven episodes of the series, along with episodes nine and twelve, were directed by Masaaki Ōsumi, while the remaining episodes were directed jointly by Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. Key animation direction was provided by Yasuo Ōtsuka. The music was composed by Takeo Yamashita with many songs performed by Charlie Kosei. The series received a record amount of orders from the broadcast industry and had a 9% viewing share during its original broadcast. Discotek Media licensed and released the first series on DVD in North America on June 26, 2012\n\nThe second Lupin III television series began airing on NTV on October 3, 1977. This series, was broadcast for 155 episodes, with the last one airing on October 6, 1980. Episodes 145 and 155 were written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki under the pseudonym Terekomu, and they marked his final involvement with the Lupin franchise. The music for the series was composed by Yuji Ohno. On September 3, 1979, Episode 99 was the first ever anime television episode to be broadcast in stereo. Streamline released episodes 145 and 155 of the second television series to VHS as \"Lupin III's Greatest Capers\". Geneon Entertainment, which was at the time was called Pioneer Entertainment, began distributing the second television series in North America in 2003. Geneon hired Phuuz Entertainment Inc. to adapt and translate the series. The first 79 episodes were released on 15 DVDs and the first 26 episodes aired numerous times on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.\n\nDuring the broadcast run of the second television series, an animated feature film was also produced titled simply Lupin III (later known as Lupin III: Lupin vs. the Clone), which was released in Japanese theaters on December 16, 1978. The movie received four different English language dubs. The first dub, created in 1978, received experimental screenings in the United States by TMS, while the next two dubs were created for home releases and were retitled The Mystery of Mamo and Secret of Mamo. The fourth was released on DVD by Geneon in North America on July 29, 2003, under the title The Secret of Mamo. Manga Entertainment released the movie in the United Kingdom on August 4, 2008. Discotek Media released the film on DVD on February 26, 2013 and includes all four English dubs.\n\nThe first Lupin III original video animation (OVA) was The Plot of the Fuma Clan, was shown in theatres in Japan on December 26, 1987 before being released to video on April 5, 1998. Because of budget problems, TMS decided not to employ the regular voice cast from the television series and theatrical movies; instead, they hired a different cast to save money. Yasuo Yamada, the voice actor for Lupin, had always taken pride in his role as the title character and after the voice cast replacement, he mistakenly thought that Monkey Punch had lobbied the producers for a new voice actor.\n\nLupin III along with his gang want to steal the lost treasure of the Romanov Royal family, this treasure is an immense quantity of gold hide underground in the United States behind the placement of a corrupt bank. But to have the gold, Lupin and his friends will have to fight for it with the mysterious and powerful monk Rasputin. Also Lupin again will have to elude the inspector Zenigata who will follow Lupin's trail and try to put him in jail.\n\nChinese Kingpin Chin Chin Chu is after a dragon figurine that's a key to creating an alloy said to be greater than Goemon's Zantatsu Sword. The dragon figurine is located in the depths of the Titanic. Lupin, Jigen, and Fujiko were offered by Chin to steal it for him, but Lupin refuses the offer, and gets it himself, as his grandfather, Arsene Lupin the 1st tried to steal it before the Titanic sunk. Goemon accompanied by his childhood friend Kikyo, team up to maintain the Iga Clan honor that the dragon won't fall into the use of evil.\n\nThe fifth anime feature film, Dead or Alive, was directed by the creator of the series, Monkey Punch, and released in Japanese theaters on April 20, 1996. Although he was credited as chief director for the production, Monkey Punch said that he left most of the work to his assistant directors and only directed the opening and ending sequences while acting as consultant for everything else. Following the production of the movie, he stated that the process was so exhausting he would not like to direct another anime again."
