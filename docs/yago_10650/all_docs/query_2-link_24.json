        "text": "Here are a few pics from my visit to the Tama factory in Nagoya, Japan. Truly a trip of a lifetime and Japanese hospitality is like no other. I spent a whole day at the factory under guidance from Tama director Mike Shimada. To say the receptions we received were wonderful is an understatement. The next two days Mr. Shimada also took me for some breathtaking sight seeing trips around historical places and of course introduced me to some great Japanese food!\n\nIn the Japan factory The Star series are manufactured along with Starclassics for the Japanese market and special orders. I know the drums well but what surprised me is the amazing attention to detail, respect for the instrument, the player and their ambition to make a world class instrument with great humility. Spending almost three hours test driving the Star series with the Star series designer, Taka Hoshino at my side was a wonderful experience. He asked me more questions than I asked him!\n\nAnd for the record: the name \"Tama\" is the maiden name of Tama Hoshino, wife of company founder; Matsujiro Hoshino.\n\nHoshino means \"Starfield\". Hoshi = Star, No = Field. Hence all the Star names in their series.\n\nSpray booth:\n\nNew kit for Lars Ulrich in the making:\n\nStar Walnut:\n\nInlays:\n\nFirst of all, thank you for sharing your experience and taking the time to post all these pictures. Really enjoy your posts, Halldor, and these are no exception... A class act sharing a class act!\n\nGoing all the way back to my teens in the late 70s early 80s, the only kit I ever really wanted was a Tama kit. I could never afford one, so I held on to the Rogers kit my father bought me in 1978. When my mother passed away in 1999, at the age of 33, I walked into a music store to buy a new Tama Rockstar kit. The owner of the shop came over and showed me a brand new \"Starclassic Performer\" kit in Transparent Black. After explaining to him that I couldn't afford the $1500 price tag, he said how does $1150 sound? Classic no brainer...I put $500 cash down and told him I would return with the balance the next day...\n\nStill have that kit and have remained a Tama fan for life. Seeing and hearing about your experience solidifies my feeling about them as a company and I still see no reason to look elsewhere for my needs!\n\nThanks again..."
