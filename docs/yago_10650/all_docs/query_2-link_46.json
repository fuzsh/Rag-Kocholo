        "meta_description": "Sebastian von Müsel was the father of Reinhard von Lohengramm and Annerose von Grünewald, and a member of the lesser nobility.     Biography  Biography   Family life  Very little is known about the life of Sebastian von Müsel, except that he held the title of Reichsritter. He was married to Caribelle von Müsel, who who died in a car accident shortly after the birth of Reinhard von Müsel. He demanded an apology but did not get one. After that, he fell into depression and eventually alcoholism.     At one point, Sebastian's poverty forced him to move to an old home in a middle-class neighbourhood, where both of his children became acquainted with the next-door Kircheis family. The only son of that family, Siegfried Kircheis, became a life-long friend of Reinhard.     Selling his daughter  One day in 786 UC, a high nobleman happened to see Annerose von Müsel on a public street, and took notice of her. Rumours of Annerose's beauty soon reached the Imperial Court, and it was decided that she would be brought to the Neue Sanssouci, the Imperial Palace, to serve as consort to the emperor — Kaiser Friedrich IV. Sebastian von Müsel was given a large sum of money in return for selling his daughter into a life of sexual servitude. When confronted about these actions by his son, Sebastian said: \"I can't refuse, so at least I got some money.\"    This event outraged Reinhard, and he became deeply estranged from his father. Sebastian, meanwhile, consumed with guilt for his actions drowned himself in alcohol.      Estrangement and death  When Reinhard was old enough, he left his home for the Odin Imperial Officer Academy, and it is implied that he never spoke to his father again after leaving home. It is unknown whether or not Sebastian had much, if any, contact with his daughter after she went to Neue Sanssouci.    On 28 April 793 UC, Sebastian passed away as a result of acute liver cirrhosis caused by his alcoholism. He was promptly buried next to his wife's grave as per Annerose's request. His funeral was attended by Annerose, Reinhard and Kircheis, although Reinhard only turned up for the sake of his sister.     Three years later on his son's 20th birthday, Reinhard was given special permission by Kaiser Friedrich IV to assume the long-defunct noble name of \"Lohengramm\". On that day, Reinhard became Reinhard von Lohengramm and severed all ties he had with his father.       Voice actors: Kōji Yada, Mitsuaki Hoshino",
