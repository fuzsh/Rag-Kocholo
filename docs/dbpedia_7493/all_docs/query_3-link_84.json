        "text": "Synopsis\n\nNorma Fox Mazer's remarkable story of two sisters fighting to survive against a world without caring, reissued in a 10th anniversary paperback edition, to coincide with Mazer's new novel in hardcover.\n\nIn the sad, shabby trailer where Em Thurkill lived her first fourteen years, suffering her father's alcoholic rages and her mother's deathly silence, and in the three she lived trapped with her violent, unstable sister, there seems more than enough to end even the dream of hope.\n\nYet Em Thurkill's story is a story of how hope outlives brutality. It is a story of one girl's sweetness, and almost unbearable pain. Heartbreaking, mesmerizing, and ultimately transcendent, this novel is a tribute to the astonishing resilience of the human soul.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nNorma Fox Mazer grew up in Glens Falls, New York, in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains. Currently, she and her husband reside in Pompey Hills, NY. Her husband is author Harry Mazer, and the couple has four children. Norma is praised for her portrayal of characters with realistic problems and relationships that pull them out of struggles. Norma finds literature to be a way to make sense out of a chaotic world. Her books have received many awards, including a finalist for the National Book Award, a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award, the Christopher Medal, a Newbery Honor, and The Edgar."
