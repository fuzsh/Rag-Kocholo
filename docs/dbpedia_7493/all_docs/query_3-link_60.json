        "text": "Title: The Missing Girl\n\nAuthor: Norma Fox Mazer\n\nGenre(s): YA, Mystery, Realistic Fiction, Thriller, Abuse, Family\n\nPublisher: HarperTeen\n\nPublication Date: February 5 2008\n\nHardcover: 284 pages\n\nBack of the Book:\n\nHe could be any man, any respectable, ordinary man.\n\nBut he’s not.\n\nThis man watches the five Herbert girls–Beauty, Mim, Stevie, Fancy, and Autumn–with disturbing fascination.\n\nUnaware of his scrutiny and his increasingly agitated and forbidden thoughts about them, the sisters go on with their ordinary everyday lives–planning, arguing, laughing, and crying–as if nothing bad could ever breach the safety of their family.\n\nMy Rating:\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nI’ve wanted to read this book for so long but it’s the type of book I’ve wanted to read and don’t want to read. It sounds interesting and amazing while also dark and disturbing. Finally I read The Missing Girl and it is everything I thought it would be but more so!\n\nThe cover: It’s simple, it’s intriguing, it’s mysterious. I love it! It doesn’t give away which Herbert sister is the one who is going to be taken while also highlights the sister’s hair blowing in the wind, what the man who watches them originally notices about the Herbert girls.\n\nThe Missing Girl is a haunting story that in ways reminded me of The Virgin Suicides, a book also about five sisters who capture the neighbour boys attention (though not in such a disturbing way as in this book) causing the boys to want to know more about the mysterious girls across the street.\n\nHowever in The Missing Girls the narrator gets to know the Herbert girls, unlike the mystery of the Lisbon girls in The Virgin Suicides. While I would have enjoyed a narration by each of the sisters the book only allows a voice from Beauty, the oldest sister, Fancy, the second youngest who is mentally challenged, and Amber, the youngest sister. I felt that a narration with all five sisters (Mim and Stevie) would have allowed a better bond to be established by the sister’s and understood by the reader, I felt this was unfortunately lost.\n\nI did enjoy Beauty, Fancy, and Autumn’s narration. Beauty’s narration caused great sympathy, the oldest sister who has to look out for the younger ones and who feels she is inappropriately named. Never having a boyfriend she jumps imagines having crushes with many guys and dreams of a time when she will leave the small town of Mallory and move to Chicago so she can finally be herself.\n\nFancy’s narrations are few but interesting. She often doesn’t understand the full extent of what is happening and as a result tends to laugh it off and go on long drawn out monologues.\n\nAmber is the youngest and while her sister’s say she can get away with anything since she’s the favourite she doesn’t feel like the favourite. She often feels used and unappreciated by her sister’s whom she loves and hates at times.\n\nEach of the narrations is different. Beauty is in third person, Fancy in first, and Amber in (I think it’s called) second person where you are Amber. Each narration style fits with each sister and allows the reader a closer look into their character.\n\nThe Missing Girl is also narrated by the man who watches the girls. His narration is disturbing as he watches the girls, his birds, and narrows it down one by one until he decides which one is his favourite. His narration is innocent and that’s what makes it disturbing. He appears to be a kind, normal everyday man who tells himself he’s doing nothing wrong by watching the Herbert girls and is doing nothing wrong with kidnapping one. His narrative is disturbing but intriguing, I found myself eagerly awaiting and dreading his chapters.\n\nWhile I enjoyed this book it’s only getting three stars do to sloppy editing. Near the end of the book the narration starts calling the Herbert girls the Huddle girls (their father is named Huddle Herbert). It annoyed me and I couldn’t believe the editor missed such an obvious mistake that repeats itself endlessly throughout the novel!"
