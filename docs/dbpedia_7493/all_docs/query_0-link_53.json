In playing this role, “Queen Bees” gain a sense of power over the other girls within the clique. They enjoy the fact that the others feel as though they must pay homage to them. However, “Queen Bees” lose a real sense of self, and become cynical of their position. Often, they wonder if people only speak to them as a result of their popularity or looks. The simple fact that they feel as though they must routinely exert their power over the others, proves that their actions are spurred from a place of loneliness.When they are able to control others, it proves to them that they are still better than everyone else. This pattern repeats, as they are constantly in need of reassurance, and surround themselves with people who will do so. Often the recipient of the bullying, are the “Targets”. Commonly meek and insecure, they provide the weakness that the “Queen Bees” need to prey upon. For instance, should a “Target” come to school wearing a new pair of shoes that a “Queen Bee” envies, the “Queen Bees” will incessantly call the “Targets” names and make fun of their shoes. This will eventually cause “Targets” to leave or feel so terribly that they will take the shoes off in hopes of the nonsense coming to a stop. This causes “Targets” to feel worthless and unvalued. As one can see, bullying is a terrible form of peer pressure in which both the administrator and recipient suffer negatively\n\nPriscilla And The Wimp Analysis\n\n606 Words | 2 Pages\n\nBoth students had the same problem with bullying.

Dove, an African American woman born in 1952, has not only viewed the racism of the United States society, but she has also seen how gender can or cannot play a role in the advancement of a person’s life (Rita Dove: The Poetry Foundation). The poem “Daystar” not only takes an outside perspective on the everyday life of a woman, but it closely relates to Dove’s family history. Dove uses the experiences of her life as a woman, and the knowledge gained from living in countries other than the United States, to depict the pressure and desire felt by mothers and/or wives on a daily basis.\n\nBullying in Lord Of The Flies\n\n1387 Words | 3 Pages\n\nBullying is when a person or group frequently harms someone who is weaker or more vulnerable then themselves.
