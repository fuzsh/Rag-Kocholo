        "text": "Coming out of Her Shell\n\n“It wasn’t my mother, she was asleep in the bed across the room, so it was robbers, thieves and murderers, creeping slowly...slowly...slowly toward my bed.” This is June, a kind-hearted girl, with a great sense of consideration, but she’s pushed around easily and letting things happen to her. June is one of the main characters in the short story “Tuesday of the Other June,” by Norma Fox Mazer. June has a line of family members who have been named by the names of the months. June’s mother is very protective of June, “But you are my June, my only June, the only June.” But all joy ends there as soon as June meets another girl in her swimming class also named June. The Other June calls June names which soon catches on with other students--as they also tease her and call her names. June is troubled as she is a caring girl who loves and respects her mom, though desperatly wants to stand up to the “Other June”. …show more content…\n\nWhen she’s about to do something, June almost always thinks of how it affects her mother first. As June says that she is safe with her mom, she still sometimes has nightmares--but doesn’t want to wake her up. “I stuffed my hand into my mouth. If I screamed and woke her, she’d be tired for work tomorrow.” Even though frightening thoughts keep June up at night, she hopes her mom can have enough sleep. But June also thinks her mom is hard-working; and she wants to deliver it back to her. “I wanted to be rich and take care of her. She worked too hard; her pretty hair had gray in it that she joked"
