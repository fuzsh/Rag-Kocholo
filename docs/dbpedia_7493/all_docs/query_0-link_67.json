        "text": "I noticed that in the book, The Girl I Used To Be, the main character, Ariel, didn’t get close to basically anyone until she moved back to her birth home. This is probably because she was still needing to know who murdered her parents and when she went back to her birth home people were willing to help her. When she was in the foster system, all people wanted to do was give her a new life and that was not what she wanted.\n\nI wonder if anyone besides Nora and Duncan realized that Ariel was Terry and Naomi’s daughter and they just didn’t say anything in the fear of being wrong.

I most likely would have gone back to my birth home, asked around a little bit, maybe go look for something with another person of course, and then not do things that might get me killed. The big difference between me and her is that she figured out who killed her parents but if I were her I wouldn’t have. I would not have been brave enough to take all the risks she"
