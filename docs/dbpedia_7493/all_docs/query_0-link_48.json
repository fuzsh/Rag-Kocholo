Life is short, life is long. Life is sad, life is sweet. O my daughter, O my darling, O my dear.)\n\nAvie Loves Ric Forever\n\nDear Stephan,\n\nAlthough you don’t know it, this is the 25th letter I’ve written you. Yes! 25 letters which you’ve never received. I can see your eyes turning dark with greed for those 25 letters. And long ones, too! I find it a real pain to write an English theme, but when I sit here at my desk in the little cubbyhole in my room and write you a letter, it’s entirely different. I go on for page after page. And each time I feel better for it, too—for a little while, anyway, until the sadness comes back.\n\nThe sadness of knowing I’m writing to you, dear Stephan, but that you’ll never read my letter. And, oh, how I wish you could. Selfishly, I wish it, for me, because then you would know my deepest feelings. But there’s even another reason, and that’s that you’re always so pleased, almost triumphant, when you get mail. Aha! A letter! You hold it up, waving it like a flag. I’ve seen you do it a hundred times. As for me, I’d a thousand times rather have a real face-to-face conversation. Or, second best, a good long talk on the phone.\n\nAre you wondering, if that’s the case—and considering that I not only see you every day, but could pick up the phone anytime and call you—why it is I’ve written you 24 letters and am writing you a twenty-fifth? And none of which you’ll ever receive? A mystery, Stephan!\n\nOnce you said to me, Richie, how can you read all those junky mysteries? I was more than a little bit annoyed, if you remember, and told you I didn’t see how you could read all that junky science-fiction stuff.\n\nAt least there’s some semblance of thought in them, you said in your snottiest professor voice. To make peace we finally agreed to forever disagree about our reading. As if that were the only thing we disagreed on! I could make up a list of 50 things on which we have utterly opposite viewpoints. Beginning with you being a sun worshiper and going down the line through food, movies, clothes, people, politics, and if the Student Council has any real influence. (I vote yes, you, no.)\n\nAnd another thing we disagree on—you like to get straight to the point. In fact, it’s one of your favorite sayings: Get to the point, Richie! Whereas I like nothing so much as to ramble, to get in all the little interesting details. And don’t deny, my dear best friend, that there have been plenty of times when you’ve listened to my rambling stories and enjoyed yourself like anything.\n\nYou even said it last year when we did our camping weekend. What would these couple of days be like, Richie, without your endless stories?\n\nI wasn’t too pleased about that endless but you insisted you meant it as a compliment and told me about Scheherazade, who saved her life, night after night, by telling the king a story that never ended. Each evening when he might have—and indeed planned to—order her execution, instead he let her live to go on with her story the following night.\n\nFor the rest of that weekend you were Kingy and I was Zady. Stev—Stephan, do you remember? I remember nearly everything from all the good times we’ve had together. I know you remember everything you ever read and everything that has to do with school and studies. (I, as little as possible. How is it that school doesn’t bore you?)\n\nBy the way, I hope you notice how carefully I’m calling you by your given name, rather than the old familiar, careless Stevie? It’s an effort for me not to call you Stevie, but as you’ve made your wishes very clear …\n\nI’m 17, damn it! you said on Saturday, and Stevie sounds like seven. Of course, I argued with you. \"No, not at all, it’s your name. It’s a diminutive, Richie, you said. It means little Steven. Who needs it?\"\n\nWith that I shut up, since I’m aware you’re more than a bit sensitive about your height. Not that you’re short. Good grief, Stephan, five six is hardly short. But, yes, I know, when your father is nearly six feet and your brother as well, and then, to make matters worse—me, being six feet and even a bit more—Yes, I can understand your point of view.\n\nDo you realize, Stephan, that hardly ever a week passes, for me, without some cheerful idiot asking me how the air is up here? Or if, since my ear is so close to God’s mouth, I would be so good as to give a weather forecast? And since I’m on the subject of my being so tall, let me congratulate you on being the one person in the entire world who has never felt called upon to comment. And this includes my darling mother, who is always making bracing remarks to me—Tall girls are so splendid is her favorite, along with a jab in my lower back to make sure I’m standing straight.\n\nTonight, though, she got started once again about how I must, must, must keep up my marks if I want to go to college.\n\nI do believe if I hear the word underachievement one more time, I’ll scream. Or else blow the damn thing up. What, you’ve never heard of Achievement Bridge? A great pet of the governor’s—he spent millions on it. The mystery is why everyone thinks I’m under it.\n\nWhy can’t they all understand that I do enough to satisfy me? I have my dreams, too—which you know—about being a marine biologist. But I don’t tell them, because what a shout that would bring. You, Richie, with your so-so grades and your lazy attitude towards schoolwork!\n\nLook, I should tell them, I learn what I need to, and the rest of it can go to the devil! If they’d care to check a bit more carefully, they’d see that my marks in science, etc. are perfectly okay. It’s only in subjects I don’t give a hoot for that I let down. And why not? Where is it written that everyone must learn everything? But you’re capable of so much more, my mother says. And Mr. Pickering, our dear guidance man, coughs and says, A-hem, discipline … A-hem, good study habits … A-hem, anything worth doing …\n\nAll right! I did my studying tonight, and now, instead of history, I prefer to think about how next month you and I will be off again on our annual great camping weekend. Despite the fact that we’ve been doing it now for six years (and survived), I predict that everyone will, as usual, tell us we’re mad to go camping at the end of May when there’s still apt to be snow on the ground in the woods.\n\nThe very first year we made up our camping plan, we wanted to go in March. Naturally, our parents objected. We’d freeze our tender little bums! We’d catch cold! We’d be shivering mummies when they came to fetch us! Our three parents were united, and against us! A gang-up, we called it, but since we were only 11, we caved in. We didn’t go camping until May, and ever since, each year on Memorial Day weekend—\n\nAll right! I can almost hear you clearing your throat, which also says, as clearly as words, Richie, get to the point.\n\nThe point being—why have I written you 24, and now a 25th letter?\n\nTo begin with, I’ve told you all this before in at least a dozen of those undelivered letters, but I’ll do it once again. And, furthermore, after explaining myself, I’m determined to think seriously about sending you this letter, rather than locking it away in my desk with all the others.\n\nDoes that, too, sound rather strange? Send the letter? Go to all the trouble of going down the block and dropping it in the corner mailbox, thereby running the risk of its being lost by the Pony Express and never being delivered? All that, when I could simply cut across our lawn, leap that anemic hedge my mother planted, and slip the letter safely into the metal slot in your front door?\n\nNo, Stevie, if I do get up the nerve to deliver this letter to you, it will be done properly through the United States Mail, simply because that way I might be on hand when you pick up the envelope. I might be right there the moment you whistle through your teeth with pleasure at having received a letter. Who can it be from? you’ll say, turning it over and over. You won’t want to open it at once (the way I would); instead you’ll hold it up to the light (will you recognize my big, sloppy handwriting?), scrutinize the postmark—in a word, take your time with it (as you do with nearly everything), while I’ll be trembling in every limb with impatience.\n\nIt’s maddening how you make everything last as long as possible! Whether it’s an ice cream, a book, or a letter, you just don’t let yourself gobble. You’re very disciplined that way, whereas I’m lazy about such things. Once, seeing me devour my ice cream in two bites, you said, Richie, slow down and savor things a bit!\n\nYes, I want to! But I haven’t yet succeeded in finding out how to do it. I’m excessive in every way. We’re different, Stephan, down the line, but there’s a hope in me that in one way—That’s what this letter is about, that one way, but I can’t yet bring myself to say it, flat out. Can you guess, Stevie? Please try! Here, I’ll give you a hint.\n\nIt’s true our personalities, our minds, our characters, are utterly different, yet we’re so close that, while we each have an aura, we also have something that I call a Third Aura. You’ve said to me that people stare at us at times because, like Mutt and Jeff, one of us is tall and one is short, but the tallness and shortness aren’t distributed the way people expect. I have a different idea, however. I think it’s our Third Aura. That’s what people notice because it’s really a rare thing.\n\nOh, go ahead, laugh. I know you don’t believe in such things, but I do—in other lives, reincarnation, and auras. To me, it’s all part of God and love and—\n\nDear Stephan,\n\nI never did get a chance to finish the last letter and I’ve made it a rule (maybe a silly one, but as it’s my silly rule, I try to go with it)—I’ve made it a rule to either finish my letter to you the same day I start it, or else begin another the next time I’m in a writing-to-Stevie mood.\n\nAnd the reason for that is that what I felt yesterday I often don’t feel today. Oh, no, not the important big feelings, but little feelings—moods, worries, angers, and so on. You’d be surprised how many letters I’ve written you out of anger. As you so rarely get angry at anyone yourself, it always takes you by surprise when I fly out.\n\nAnyway, last night my mother came in about midnight, very surprised. Richie, what are you sitting up so late for? I covered the letter with my arm and mumbled something about an English paper. Of course, this was exactly the right answer. But, tonight, I’ve stuffed a towel under my door so the light won’t show through. Good night, my mother called, going past to her bedroom. Good night, Mom, I said, sounding sleepy. But, in fact, I wasn’t, and am not, at all sleepy. I’ve found out that, some nights, to be properly ready for the sandman, I first have to write you. Sometimes, just a short note, as follows:\n\nDear Stevie, I love you.\n\nAnd there’s the point of the letter I never finished last night, Stevie. I’ll write it again, since I can’t ever say it out loud, can’t ever say it straight out to your face, no matter how much I dream of it.\n\nDear, dear Stevie, dearest Stephan, I love you.\n\nAnd now that I’ve written that, now that I’ve—in your phrase—come to the point, I don’t want to write anything else. Good night, Stevie.\n\nStevie!\n\nReally, I have had it up to here with your Karens and Kims and Kathis. What is it with you and girls with names beginning with K? Do you realize that every year for the past two or three years you have developed at least one, sometimes two or even three, great romantic attachments? And lucky me!—I get to hear all the details. How you first noticed Kay, what it was about Kitty that electrified you, and do you think, Richie, I ought to call Karen up, or maybe it would be better to wait till we run into each other in some natural way, but on the other hand, and so on and so on …\n\nI’ve been through all this with you enough times, Stevie, to know the whole route by heart. And I admit, until recently, I’ve enjoyed being your ally and confidante. Why not? I knew it would all come to nothing, most likely. And we would go on, just as we always had.\n\nBut now we have the latest—Katherine, if you please!—and I’m no longer so tolerant and friendly about your love life, Stevie. If you only knew how much I wanted to tell you to shut up, please shut up, as you went on and on about Katherine Ritter today on the way to school.\n\nKatherine, with the thick braids. Katherine, whom you suddenly adore (at a distance, of course!). And did I know Katherine (yes), the fair Katherine, the lovely Katherine? And would I, by any chance, have any classes with her? And, of course, you didn’t even have to say what came next! Would I have a chance to talk to her, and, well … I barely listened. I knew exactly what you would ask. You never want so very much, after all—a modest request. And I’ve never minded helping you—just the opposite, in fact. All you ever want is a little report about your Katherine or Kim or Kay. Is she aware of you? Do you have a chance, et cetera? No more did you want today.\n\nAnd as you made your damned request you had on your sweetest expression, which made me love you even more, and thus resent you beyond belief. Why should you look at me that way, when it’s about another girl that you’re speaking?\n\nThe hell with it, Stevie! The hell with it! I resign as your Ann Landers-in-waiting, as your loyal lieutenant, as your faithful, dumb mutt who does her duty and comes back for her reward—a pat on the head and a doggy biscuit. Go speak to your Katherine yourself!\n\nP.S. Your timing stinks! For somebody so smart,"
