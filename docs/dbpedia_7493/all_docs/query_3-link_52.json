        "text": "“Tuesday of the other June” by Norma Fox Mazer is a story realistic about a girl named june who gets bullied by the other June she meets in swim class. And she thinks she can get rid of her at the end of swim class. In the beginning, June was enrolled into swim class at the community pool June was so excited to meet her new friends until she meets the other June the biggest bully june knew, and other june choose to pick on her. Soon,June thinks she can get away from the bully but when her mother says they're moving but she was wrong she moved closer to her, June lived on her street and went to her school it was a nightmare to June. In the end June gets tired of getting picked on and bullied by the other june, so finally she stood up to her …show more content…\n\nIn many different ways the bully found ways to hurt June.In paragraph 31 the author says “the other june grabbed my fingers and twisted, where'd she find your bathing suit. This example shows that the bully liked picking on June and that's why other June kept being mean to June and that maybe mean june thought she was the only june until she finds out she's not.This shows that she does not like June so she bullies June and tries to knock her off her feet and make her mad to where she might fight back but she doesn't at all. An example is in paragraph 90 “ but I had turned the other cheek and it was slapped. I had smiled and the world hadnt smiled back. I couldn't run home fast as my feet would take me. I had to stay in school---and in school there was other june. Every morning, there would be the other june, and every afternoon, and every day,all day ,there would be other …show more content…\n\nMean june would bully June to where she wanted to cry and June wanted to fight back but she didn't. For example in paragraph 77 the author says “ I was back in the tuesday swimming class, only now it was worse, because every day would be awful day. The pinching had already started. Soon, I knew, on the playground and in the halls, kids would pass me , grinning. This means that mean june was trying to hurt her where it really hurt and the bully did it on purpose just to make her weak.This action is important because it is one of the many ways June was bullied. June was bullied in many different ways.What I talked about in paragraph one is that the bully called June mean names like fish eyes and buffalo brains and finally turkey nose and all of the children thought it was funny. What I said in paragraph 2 is that other June would hit her and twist her fingers so it would hurt her and after the bully would hurt June she would pick on her and would pick on her bathing suit and what she wore. In paragraph 3 I explained that when june thinks of next tuesday the imagines how the bully will pick on her so she would cry because it scared June to much. In the end mean June was put in her place, June said one little word with no meaning no and so the bully looked confused and upset and mad June fought back so i'm saying don't let anyone ever bully you fight back or tell someone that you're being"
