        "text": "When I heard about this New York Times article I was trying to think up a good name for my piece about it. Then I saw that reporter Mary Jo Murphy beat me to the punch with her Nancy Drew and the Secret of the 3 Black Robes. Touche. Essentially what the piece comes down to is that after discovering that Supreme Court hopeful Sonia Sotomayor read Nancy Drew as a child, Ms. Murphy scouted around a bit and discovered that Judges Ginsberg and O’Connor shared this predilection as kids. So Colleen over at Chasing Ray has interviewed a swath of authors, finding out their own thoughts on kicking girl protagonists. Personally, I was a huge Three Investigators fan as a kid. And it wasn’t just because of their junkyard headquarters. When are those books coming back in print, by the way? I know they’re handicapped by the strange and ancient technique of having the boys report back to (I am not making this up) Alfred Hitchcock, but who cares? They still beat the boring Hardy Boys any day of the week. Oh yeah! I said it! You wanna piece of this?\n\nThere is a site out there going by the name of Entertainment Legends Revealed. According to my husband its original purpose was to record urban legends as they related to comic books (insofar as that goes). Eventually that expanded. Now the site has started its own little Picture Book Legends Revealed series. Technically, Collecting Children’s Books already has that area of expertise covered, but it’s always fun to see people talking up picture book topics anyway. Funny that he mentions the Madeleine orphanage misunderstanding and not the other Madeleine mystery, though.\n\nWhat makes a person becomes an editor of children’s books? Where’d they get the drive? T.S. Ferguson, a junior editor at Little, Brown & Co. has started a new series on his blog called the Junior Editor Spotlight. First up: Molly O’Neill. Those of you who know Molly, love her. Those of you who don’t, she has a blog called 10 Block Walk that I enjoy reading.\n\nA very big and much humbled thank you to Ms. Houghton’s Class for awarding me a One Lovely Blog Award. I apologize to her for wanting to write \"Mifflin Harcourt\" after her name. Now I know that school librarians read me sometimes, but I’ve not heard from many teachers before. Thank you kindly, m’dear. Plus the list of other blogs nominated makes for a fabulous mix. Good reading, particularly if any of them are unfamiliar to you. Cheers!\n\nOy! I just learned from PW Children’s Bookshelf that \" Patricia Lee Gauch, v-p and editor at large at Philomel Books, will be leaving the company on September 30, to return to writing and lecturing fulltime.\" Durn! I swear, soon as I learn someone’s name they’re gone again. And Patti’s such a superior kind of editor, I will be sad to see her go."
