        "text": "PART ONE\n\nWHO THEY ARE AND HOW IT HAPPENS\n\nA FLOCK OF BIRDS\n\nIF THE MAN IS LUCKY, in the morning on his way to work, he sees the girls. A flock of them, like birds. March is a dismal month, and the man’s spirits often fall during this month of wet clouds and short gray days. He is hard put to remember that soon spring will return, but the sight of a cardinal or a chickadee—or the girls—reminds him of this. He is not one of those strange people who watch birds through binoculars, but the twittering and calls of even the jays, who are abominably noisy, is refreshing to him. As is the twittering and chatter of the girls.\n\nOne, two, three, four, five. Five of them. Five. A gratifying outcome of changing his route to work. Without being unduly self-congratulatory, because he is a modest man, he can take credit for this, as a result of his intelligence and careful planning. When his job description changed, he knew immediately that this meant he should no longer walk the same streets from his house to the bus stop to the store office. And though the route he had used for the past year was decidedly efficient, he changed it, proving once again that he was—he is—highly adaptable. It is the adaptable who survive in this beastly world.\n\nIt takes him seven minutes longer to walk the new way, but if one thing changes, then something else must change as well. This is a rule, the only way to maintain balance and order. The proof of the fundamental rightness of this rule is clear: changing the streets he walks to the bus stop each morning brought the girls into his life. An unexpected gift.\n\nA reward, because he has been good for so long.\n\nHe has always liked schoolgirls, their open faces, their laughter, their innocence. Despite the fact that he has now seen these particular girls, his flock of birds, nearly a dozen times, not one of them has noticed him. Not one of them has flicked him so much as a glance. This is good. It’s the way he wants it. He doesn’t want to be noticed. It is safer to be, as he knows he is, unremarkable.\n\nSlight of build, stoop shouldered, wearing a gray coat, a gray scarf around his neck against the cold, his wire-rimmed glasses set firmly on his nose, minding his own business, he could be any man, any respectable, ordinary man.\n\nLE PLAN\n\nBEAUTY HERBERT, HURRYING down the hill from Mallory Central School, sliding a little on the slushy sidewalk, considered her age. Today, the snowy fifth of March, she was exactly seventeen and one-half years. The time for Le Plan was coming ever closer. Maybe she’d tell Patrick it was her half-year birthday, and he’d insist that they have a latte from the coffee shop across the street to celebrate.\n\nPatrick Jimenez owned Patrick the Florist, the shop on Costello Street where Beauty worked ten hours a week and where she was headed now. Seventeen and a half! enthusiastic Patrick would say. Great! The latte, and then work. Patrick had been in the flower business for twenty-five years, and his customers adored him. Beauty did, too, as though he were not only her boss, but almost an older brother, the brother she’d always wished for to share the responsibility that came with being the oldest of five sisters.\n\nThe idea of leaving her little sisters, in fact, was the only thing about Le Plan that bothered Beauty. She wasn’t too worried about Mim, who, at sixteen, seemed to be okay, but the newly fourteen-year-old sister who had just informed the family that she was changing her name from Faithful to Stevie, of all things, was something of a mess, drenching everyone in her out-there, high-speed, top-volume emotions and orders (from now on, my name is Stevie and no one in this family better forget that). As for Fancy and Autumn, well, they were both still kids, and that was the trouble. Who would look after them when she left? Fancy was twelve, had her period and little breasts, and should be growing up, but of course she wasn’t. And eleven-year-old Autumn? Half the time the child was dreaming about something or other, and the other half crying over nothing. It didn’t look as if she would ever make a plan for her life, as Beauty had done, but at least when she was here, Beauty could keep an eye on her.\n\nLast September, when she had turned seventeen and also entered her senior year in high school, Beauty had rejoiced, as she was rejoicing today. Like mile markers on a highway, each month brought her that much closer to her eighteenth birthday, to the moment when Le Plan could become reality, when she was a legal adult, legally responsible for herself, legally able to do whatever she wanted—no, needed—to do.\n\nAnyway, seventeen was, really, so much better than sixteen, which had been so much better than fifteen, which had been so much better than fourteen, which had been mostly a relief from the pain of thirteen. If there were a pill she could pop, like an aspirin, that would blot out thirteen and cruel seventh-grade humor, she would take it in a heartbeat. Although, she amended, crossing French Street against the light (sorry, Mom), she wouldn’t want to forget Mr. Giametti. So, okay, the magic little pill could scrub her memory clean of a certain drawing, a certain poem, and leave in the good stuff.\n\nPassing Lawler’s department store on River Street downtown, she caught a glimpse of herself in the window and quickly looked away. She’d hatched Le Plan when she was thirteen, and she’d been carrying it around all these years. By next March on this date, she’d be long gone. She’d have a place of her own, a new life, a new job, and a new name (although not a ridiculous one like Stevie). Le Plan! Like the two words, the plan was neat and simple. It was just this: as soon as she turned eighteen, she was getting out of Dodge.\n\nDodge, in this case, was Mallory, this town of 5,329 people in northern New York State, where Beauty had lived her whole life. When she left Mallory, it would be for Chicago, which she had first heard about from Mr. Giametti, her seventh-grade language arts teacher, who grew up there. She was going to a place where no one knew her, a place where she could become whoever it was she was meant to be, whoever it was that she could never be in Mallory, where everyone had a tag, a label, a stifling little box into which they were shoved and where they were expected to stay forever.\n\nThe label on her little box? That ugly Herbert girl, poor thing, with the so-wrong name.\n\nBELLYACHING\n\nWHAT DO YOU DO when you don’t want to go to school? If you’re Autumn and you’re eleven, only eleven, as you think of it, and the baby of the family, you shuffle into the kitchen, train your eyes on your oldest sister, and say, with just a little whine in your voice, Beauty. Beauty. I have a bellyache. You hope you look sick. You sniffle up the night junk in your nose and let your mouth fall open a little.\n\nYou try to ignore Fancy, who says in her loud, eager voice that she’ll save the funnies for you. I’m reading them all by myself this morning, she says. You try not to watch as she takes too big a gulp of milk, burps, and sets the glass down with a thud to announce, Uh-oh! Your feet are bare. Uh-oh! Autumn alarm! Autumn alarm!\n\nYou pay attention to Beauty, who’s looking at you now and pointing out the obvious, that you’re still in your pajamas, that you’re not dressed for school. Get a move on, she says. You watch as she pours coffee into Mommy’s cup, the one that says, I MY MOM, and slides it over next to Mommy’s ashtray.\n\nYou clutch your belly. I have a stomachache, you repeat plaintively. And you add, It hurts, it hurts, and as you say this, your belly really does hurt.\n\nYou look gratefully at your sister Mim, who says, How bad is it, honey?\n\nBad, you say pitifully, and you think how much you love Mim, love how everything about her is less, unlike the rest of them. You love how small she is, how neatly made, and you love how her voice is so quiet. And you think, not for the first time, how you wish you were like Mim and everybody listened when you talked.\n\nThen Beauty is asking if you’re starting your period, maybe, and you shake your head. You know about periods and pads and blood and all that stuff that Mommy calls the womanhood department. And you don’t want to get sidetracked, so you bend over, clutching yourself, and you say the truth. I don’t want to go to school, okay?\n\nBut Beauty shakes her head and says you have to ask Mommy, which is really annoying, since Beauty is the one who always writes the excuses. Then you watch as she sits down, picks up her own coffee cup, and reaches for a piece of the newspaper.\n\nYou stand there, clutching your belly, but now none of your sisters is paying any attention to you. They’re all busy reading different parts of the newspaper, and you know what they’re doing—searching for good stories to tell Mommy later on. Because Mommy always says, Personally, I do not get this newspaper thing. Shit, I’m not going to read all the bad news. Don’t do me any good. I got enough bad news of my own.\n\nYou think how you love stories, love making them up and hearing them and reading them, and Mommy does, too. She loves true stories, like she can get on TV, and she loves to listen to anyone telling her a good juicy story they’ve read in the newspaper, like that man who chopped up his wife and kept all her parts in a trunk in the attic for years? Well, actually, you don’t like stories like that. They scare you.\n\nAfter a while you shuffle out of the kitchen and up the stairs, thinking how nothing is fair in this family, how Fancy is spoiled, how Beauty gets to boss them all around, how Faithful—oops, Stevie—scares everyone with her temper, and Mim is so quiet she can do whatever she wants and nobody notices. You’re the only one who has nothing special about you.\n\nIt hurts, it hurts, you moan. You bump your head against the door of your parents’ bedroom, and you say, Mommy, I have to tell you something. Then you go in, and Mommy is standing in front of the mirror in her underwear, combing her hair, getting ready for work. She’s a lunch lady at that home for old people downtown that used to be a church. You tell her about your stomach, and she puts her hand against your forehead, then presses on either side of your neck.\n\nIt’s my stomach, you remind her.\n\nShe says, No fever. No swollen glands. What’s happening in school today? And she taps you a little bit hard on top of your head, which makes you want to cry.\n\nYou say, Oral report. We have to tell a story about our family.\n\nYou can always make up stories for yourself and for Fancy, but the oral report story has to be true. What are you supposed to say—that Mommy is fat and smokes too much and worries too much? That Poppy fell off a roof and hurt his back and can’t do his regular work and is so grumpy? That Mommy and Poppy are mad at each other because of no work and no money?\n\nIt’s part of our social studies unit, you tell her.\n\nAnd right away you’re sorry you said it, because Mommy frowns and says in a mad voice, Our family is part of your social studies unit? That’s what we pay taxes for? So people can snoop on our family?\n\nYou tell her it’s an activity in the unit on The Family in America, and everyone has to do it. And in case she forgot, you add, in your most pitiful voice, My stomach hurts.\n\nMommy bends, looking into your face, and says, You don’t have a stomachache.\n\nI do, you say, I really do. You try not to smell Mommy’s stale cigarette breath. You say, When are you going to stop smoking? and you take a step back. You remind her that you learned in your civics unit that smoking isn’t healthy, and she should stop."
