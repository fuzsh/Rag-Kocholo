        "text": "With the lights out, it’s less dangerous / Here we are now, entertain us / I feel stupid and contagious\n\n— Nirvana, “Smells Like Teen Spirit”\n\nThere are so many teen movies these days that you could organize a film-fest around just one year in American girl-becoming-woman-hood. Take 17, an age that feels on the edge of something, or not edgy enough. For Winona Ryder’s dweebette-by-association Veronica Sawyer, 17’s when she fell in with bullies, cliques, and much, much worse in Heathers (1988). For Reese Witherspoon’s super-keen Tracy Flick, 17’s when she ran for the highest office in her suburban Omaha school-land in Election (1999). For Emma Stone’s Olive Penderghast, 17’s when she embraced her falsely-rumoured skankiness, stitching a scarlet letter to her clothes in Easy A (2010). For Hailee Steinfeld’s Nadine Franklin, in The Edge of Seventeen (2016), loneliness is her not-so-silent foe. And for Saiorse Ronan’s Christine McPherson in Lady Bird (2017), an East Coast university is her distant hope, come her senior year of Catholic high school, for escaping Sacramento.\n\nThat second decade, many a teenangster-film likes to recall, is when, supposedly, growing up’s hardest to do. The hornymoans, the prison of home-life, the girls who like boys and boys who like girls, the prison of school-life, the pubescent mood-swings . . . But some of the best recent teen films have shown, beneath the raging anxieties, sarcastic quips, and boiling frustrations, how adolescence isn’t an isolated coming-of-age but an early, painful, often more honest grappling with the same issues haunting us as adults. And as more arthouse films tackle teen-sexuality, it’s harder to tell if society, out there, or one’s changing body, right here, is the stranger, more monstrous force.\n\nWhen adolescence popped up in Hollywood as nostalgia in the ’70s, with American Graffiti and Grease—under the California sun, leather jackets and sweater tops kissed in the backs of Impalas and Thunderbirds before greasers burst into song—teenagehood was an epoch for baby boomers to look back on fondly, a rosily re-imagined time of small-town, white American values. The ’80s saw the triumphant teen on screen. 17-year-old Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) went back to the ’50s in a DeLorean and time-jumped through two sequels. 17-year-old Scott Howard (Fox again) turned werewolf. 17-year-old Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) skipped school with pals, joyriding ’round Chicago in a ’61 Ferrari. Rebels without a cause, these near-adults suddenly had the power, with scant school authority to oppose. What to be teenangsty about?\n\nIn 1998, Lukas Moodysson’s debut Show Me Love (Fucking Åmal) slyly reworked the genre. Its formulaic elements—parties, teasing, peer-pressure, frustrated young love, parents who just don’t get it—were tweaked; its dilemma was a tad different: in a town that feels so small, bookish Agnes (Rebecka Liljeberg) falls for Elin (Alexandra Dahlström), who won’t admit she’s not straight. Gender and sexuality are the hurdles (the barrier motif springs up in a Romeo-and-Juliet balcony-scene and in a bonding-moment on a bridge at the edge of town, capped by Foreigner’s “I Want To Know What Love Is”). At an age of faltering confidence, when peers pressure and parents can’t help and a dull post-teen world looms, where to go and what to do? Love—that bridge between two kindred spirits—seems the only way out. And the struggle to get there is what makes this new couple’s true coming-out (of a school washroom, together) and the closing scene—one of those lovely mundane moments together that a relationship’s based on—so touching. These two teens, not always likeable, grapple with concerns that\n\nstill plague our supposedly mature societies: the macho-ness of masculinity, the expectation to act straight, sticking to social norms, feeling “weird”, and one’s purpose: “It’s all so fucking meaningless.” Teens feel more torn between meaning and meaninglessness, Moodysson implies, desperately needing to escape and to feel as a future of adult conformity looms.\n\nThat yearning to escape, the pressure to make it or “do it”, those bursts of popular music to express inner turmoil, the tottering bridge from childhood to adulthood . . . it’s all heightened in Moodysson’s Lilya 4-Ever (2002), a small odyssey writ wrenchingly epic, and one beginning not in media res but at la fin. A girl’s weakly running down a sidewalk, industrial band Rammstein’s “My Heart Burns” is pounding, and then we see her face, bruised and heavy with a fatigue that should be well beyond her youth. A bird circles above smokestacks. She stops at a bridge, looks down, closes her eyes. The film cuts to black and its title before flashing back, showing us how Lilya (Oksana Akinshina) got here, lost. (Lilya’s based on Dangoulė Rasalaitė, a Lithuanian girl lured to Sweden in 1999.) Lilya’s end begins when she thinks she’s leaving with her mom for a better life in America—anywhere, really, but here. Here is the middle of what feels like nowhere, a run-down vestige of the former Soviet Union (the film was shot in Estonia). Its military base is derelict; Volodya (Artyom Bogucharsky) plays basketball with a smashed-up pop can; teens sniff glue. Adults show only a me-first ruthlessness or an army-style iron fist. Lilya flashes the casual, irritating arrogance of a teenager, boastful of her escape with mom and her boyfriend. (There, already, sex isn’t so much a way of connecting as of colliding and escaping—and, foremost, making money.) Then, over dinner, her mom mentions to Lilya that they’ll go on ahead and she can come later. Mother and daughter’s final moments together sink into that mire of callousness, abandonment, and escape-at-all-costs which swamped Russia and its former republics with the USSR’s break-up. And, afterwards, Lilya’s still stuck. (Akinshina, then 14, is formidable, her performance all about the slow thaw of a teen’s icicle-spiky self-resolve.) Lilya’s left in what’s still a man’s world. She’s cat-called and insulted by boys; her only friend’s the more innocent Volodya. Kicked out of her apartment but still pretending to\n\nherself that she’ll follow her mom while keeping up a hard front to others, she warily turns to the first man who seems even remotely kind. He says he can get her to Sweden.\n\nThe snatches of relief from this infernal odyssey come in Lilya and Volodya’s sweet camaraderie and her dreams and fantasies. In that smoky sky, the bird of her imagination circles, seeking escape. Influenced by the (Russian Orthodox?) oleograph on her wall, depicting an angel leading a child along by the hand, she imagines a heaven with her and Volodya as\n\nangel-winged cherubs. It’s a scrappy, surreal sight, this place of carefree play, Lilya’s safe return to youth. Left behind by her mom, she only knows now how to go back, trying to retreat into a more innocent time of connection. That wish, flashing through Lilya in brief moments of respite, makes this anti-fairy tale so achingly poignant, even as her life’s growing bleakness exerts its awesome, awful, too-truthful power. And there’s the title itself—a phrase scratched into a bench, the small, timeless mark that Lilya wants to make in the world for herself.\n\nAnd then there’s the pointed pointlessness of Warwick Thornton’s debut Samson and Delilah (2009), etched out in a backwater down under. In its opening stretch, there’s almost no dialogue; when it comes, what little there is is for others in their native tongue (Warlpiri, subtitled for us “whitefellas”). It’s Northern Australia, where lank-haired young teen Samson (Rowan McNamara) rises each day in his brother’s shack, sniffs petrol, walks outside in the dust and heat as his brother’s buddies wail out tunes on electric guitar and drums, and . . . that’s pretty much it. Soon, though, he grows interested in Delilah (Marissa Gibson), making dot paintings with her grandmother. Over three days, the repetitive, feet-dragging drudgery of Samson’s existence shuffles into a Chaplinesque dance of romance—a back-and-forth between Samson’s lunging, leaping like for Delilah and her scowling shrug-off of him. Once we’re engaged by this odd couple—living in a place white civilization ignores as the dying-out\n\nboonies; marginalized in their colonized land (only 3000 people still speak Warlpiri)—the film’s “pointlessness”, as Germaine Greer puts it, becomes entrancing. Greer notes that it “gets very close” to “embody[ing]” pointlessness, but it’s the visceral and dreamy sense of the physical—stripping down teen-romance to young bodies not quite knowing how to get close while feeling so alienated and numbed by mainstream “whitefella” culture—that animates Samson and Delilah. After they run off to Alice Springs, where they’re confronted by indifference, two scenes of (non-explicit) violence to Delilah’s body bond us even more to the couple. The first is shot in a haze, woozily mirroring Samson’s state and our shock. The second’s a horrible jar, a jerking rupture of reality just as we’re still getting our breath back.\n\nThis heightened sense of bodily harm, or of physical strangeness, in the teen-years also got its growth-spurt in the ’80s, when teens didn’t just get their freak on more, but turned increasingly freakish. That Fox-turned-werewolf movie? Teen Wolf (1985) may not have singlepawedly heralded the Teen Hormophosis Genre but, as wiser writers stopped talking down to or for teens as poor infection-able creatures, teens, feeling so much like freaks in their schools, in their homes, down deep in their bones, saw their bodies change on film . . . into vampires and werewolves. Blood-soaked changes, heavy petting, and necking get literal; compared to becoming hirsute lycanthropes or fanged nightstalkers, worries melt away but are also Franken-magnified.\n\nMetamorphosis masks but can also make room for gender and sexuality twists. Neil Jordan’s The Company of Wolves (1984), adapting Angela Carter’s revision of Red Riding Hood, jumped out a year before Teen Wolf. That female-centred film—along with ’70s predecessors The Exorcist, with possessed 12-year-old Regan, and Carrie, its anti-heroine panicked by her first period or bullied into unleashing her teen-born telekinesis—set the stage for prom queens becoming the beasts of the ball. Girls didn’t have to be vampires to get new life from the undead—Joss Whedon’s hit TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003) rose up from the film, where the cheerleader’s slaying abilities only cast her out from her pompom-waving peers. The concept vamped up grrrl power and hyper-charged larger-than-life teen-concerns about connecting with your parents, forbidden love, sex, depression, and trying to “find yourself”. Wanna-be women went wolfish in Ginger Snaps (2000), which turned two Goth girls’ death-fixation into a loaded, lycanthropic look at puberty. And in another Swedish film, Let the Right One In (2008)—Tomas Alfredson’s adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist’s novel—the vampirism-metaphor whets that thirsty need for friendship in our teenangster years. 12-year-old Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) even cuts his hand to mark a blood-bond with his gender-ambiguous beloved, Eli (Lina Leandersson). In this post-Columbine film, bullies—bloodily sadistic without any need to be, unlike vampires—are the enemies, getting their fatal comeuppance in a pool when Eli massacres them. Adolescent loneliness, isolation, and need-for-companionship are all accentuated by Eli’s solitariness, desperate bloodletting, and confinement in a box in the eerily sweet final scene as the pair escape their restrictive little town, together, at last.\n\nTransformed-Teen Terror Tales seem silver bullet- and wooden stake-proof, a cinematic creature lurching on. The genre reflects teen angst so it’s supernaturally important but also entertainingly, even soothingly, worse than reality. Vampire lore, from Stoker’s Dracula on, has reflected concerns about female sexuality but also sexual diseases (syphilis back then, HIV more recently). In Charles Burns’ comic Black Hole, about a STD mutating 1970s Seattle suburban teens and further alienating them from the world, one changed character suggests the horizon for the Teen Hormophosis Genre is so night-fright moon-bright because our high-school horror-show is what we all fear is a rehearsal for what’s coming: “It was like a déjà vu trip or something . . . a premonition. I felt like I was looking into the future . . . and the future looked really messed up.”\n\nThat messed-up future is very much, very horribly, here already in David Robert Mitchell’s It Follows (2014), where the innuendo of “coming of age” darkens quickly as sex meets the awful unknown in post-industrial Detroit’s leafy suburbs. Jay (Maika Monroe) learns she’s slept with a carrier and now\n\n“this thing—it’s gonna follow you. Someone gave it to me and I passed it to you.” If Jay sleeps with someone else, she passes it on, but if Jay’s killed, then it, impersonating anyone, will slowly but surely pursue the person who gave it to her. This daisy-chain-reaction premise intertwines, like creeper vines, the outward and the inner, the social and the physical, peer-pressure and sexual-shame. (The title also coldly voices an implacable cause-and-effect logic.) If doing it, like the it it unleashes, can be senses-filled or senseless—giving a teen a sense of purpose or a purposeless, temporary escape from real problems—then sex can be both mature and immature. Yet many pubescent-creature-features still mask a pat moralizing—a Bible-chastity-belt warning—about that Pandora’s Box of dangers which losing your virginity supposedly unleashes. (Indeed, the “it” here can take on the guise of authority-figures: as a half-naked mother, it kills one victim; as Jay’s dad, it nearly kills her in the fluid-filled climax, in an indoor pool.) But Mitchell’s film weaves together sex-as-punishment and casual-sleeping-around—now that she’s infected, Jay should seduce and trick others into sex for her own self-preservation. It Follows pushes those frightful notions of puberty-as-monstrosity in The Exorcist and Carrie, twisting the sensationalized consequences of teen-sex into a senseless scourge, a stalking killer both supernatural and sub-human—as much a\n\ncultural-conservative threat made macabrely manifest as a sexually-spread virus turned bestial, Hyde-like force. The camera’s a meta-horror force to be reckoned with, too—slowly panning or gradually zooming-in or steadily tracking, it leads us to follow the next possible victim that it follows. And the film’s about what fades, with these teens on the verge of slipping into—or maybe they won’t live to see—adulthood. This is a fading American landscape, dotted with 20th-century relics: ’70s cars, Polaroids on Jay’s wood-framed vanity; an old cinema (with an in-house organist); the score’s burbling synthesizer-interludes. It all seems on the edge of the end of summer, and these late teens feel a great aimlessness. Jay recalls, in the back of an old car in the weed-choked parking-lot of a vast, derelict building, her early-teen visions of driving around with a date: “It’s never about going anywhere, really. . . . Now that we’re old enough, where the hell do we go?” What’s scariest of all, it seems, is what’s next—what follows young-adulthood.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBurns, Charles. Black Hole.
