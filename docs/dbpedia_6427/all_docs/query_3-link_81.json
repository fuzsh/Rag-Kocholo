        "text": "Movie sequels can get a bad rep. Sometimes, it feels like Hollywood only makes sequels and reboots, which can lead to audiences wanting something original. However, many sequels are great films; the best ones can be better than the original. While sequels are most common in genres like sci-fi, action and horror, the best can come from any genre. Many sequels come from mega franchises like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars or even Pirates of the Caribbean; however, others are simple part twos or stand-alone sequel films. But what makes a top sequel? The greatest movie sequels feel deserved, fresh and often even necessary, just like all the films on this list.\n\nTop Movie Sequels\n\nWhile the films on this list can be horror, romance, comedy or even family movies, they all need to be a recognizable follow-up to another film. This list omits films that are connected mainly by themes, such as Wang Kar-wai’s In The Mood for Love as a sequel to Days of Being Wild. It also omits films that were not originally intended to be thought of as a franchise, such as Sergio Leone’s Dollars Trilogy.\n\nSometimes, the line between reboot and sequel is thin. However, in a ranking of sequels, there should be no question as to whether the filmmakers intended the film to be an obvious follow-up. This list considers both the sequel's quality within its franchise and its overall quality as a film equally.\n\n30. The Conjuring 2 (2016)\n\nMany horror sequels aren’t great. However, The Conjuring 2 is surprisingly good and arguably the best film in the franchise. It was directed by James Wan and stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson.\n\nWhile the film starts with paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren’s most famous case at the Amityville house, it quickly focuses on a lesser-known case as Ed and Lorraine investigate the haunting of a family in London in the 1970s. The film has two of the best horror sequences in the franchise (a scene at the Amityville house and a second with a hide-and-clap game.) The Conjuring 2 is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n29. Jackass: 3D (2010)\n\nIf you aren’t a fan of the Jackass movies, skip this entry. These films are not for everyone and aren’t exactly high-brow. However, in the Jackass franchise, 3D is the best film. The film stars Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, \"Danger Ehren\" McGhehey, Dave England, Preston Lacy, Wee Man and Chris Pontius as they perform dangerous and hilarious stunts.\n\nThe film has a certain reverence and nostalgia for the earlier movies and TV show while still pushing the crew to go bigger and better with their stunts. However, there is an undercurrent of melancholy in the film as well. The cast isn’t young anymore, and their bodies won’t be able to do this forever. These themes are compounded by the death of Dunn, who died in a car crash the year after the film’s release. While most of the crew came back for 2022’s Jackass Forever, 3D still feels like an end of an era. The film ends with the song \"Memories” by Weezer, which pushes the viewer to feel for the stunt performers and the lives they have chosen to lead. It is currently streaming on Paramount+.\n\n28. 22 Jump Street (2014)\n\n22 Jump Street is not a perfect film, and as with many comedies, it doesn’t age perfectly either; however, it is a surprisingly good sequel to a surprisingly good remake (2012’s 21 Jump Street, based on the TV show of the same name). The film follows two officers who have to go undercover to infiltrate a college to stop a drug supplier.\n\nThe film was directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who have made multiple great sequels, including Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. The film stars Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Peter Stormare and Ice Cube. Inkoo Kang wrote of the film for a review in The Wrap, “If 22 isn’t as trim and tight as its predecessor, it’s certainly smarter and more heartfelt. Whether this sequel is better than the original is up for debate, but the franchise has definitely grown up.” 22 Jump Street is available to rent on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n27. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)\n\nThere have been a lot of Star Trek films of varying quality, and while many might prefer later films, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is arguably the most iconic. The film is a sequel not only to the first film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, but also to the television episode \"Space Seed\" from 1967. The film follows Captain Kirk and his crew as his old nemesis, Khan, escapes from imprisonment and returns to seek revenge.\n\nThe film is part of a three-film arc that also includes 1984’s Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and 1986’s Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. However, of the three, The Wrath of Khan is the best. Directed by Nicholas Meyer, it stars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koenig, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols and Ricardo Montalbán. The film is notably the first feature film with a sequence created entirely with computer graphics. It is currently streaming on Paramount+.\n\n26. Addams Family Values (1993)\n\n“But Debbie... Pastels?” The sequel to 1991’s The Addams Family, Addams Family Values is a bit of a cult classic film. The film follows the Addams family as a new baby and an interloper turned fiancé disrupt family life. Meanwhile, the kids go to summer camp.\n\nWhile the film isn’t perfect, it is zany fun that acts as a solid follow-up, featuring some impressive set pieces and performances. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, the film stars Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Cusack, Christina Ricci, Carol Kane and David Krumholtz. The film was Julia’s last film released during his lifetime (he also appeared in 1994’s Street Fighter, which was released posthumously). The film is possibly most famous for its Thanksgiving play scene, which has been reassessed over the years. It is currently streaming for free on Pluto TV.\n\n25. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)\n\nTechnically, the sixth film in the Shrek franchise, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, is a sequel to the 2011 spin-off film Puss in Boots. The film follows Puss in Boots and several other fairytale characters as they race to a wishing star, which Puss hopes will restore his nine lives.\n\nThe film is a breath of fresh air in a franchise that has been falling in quality since 2004’s Shrek 2. It is dynamically animated and features a surprisingly scary villain. The film stars Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Harvey Guillén, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, John Mulaney and Wagner Moura. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, but it lost to Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio. Interestingly, Del Toro was an executive producer on the original Puss in Boots film and even made a voice cameo. The Last Wish is currently streaming on Peacock.\n\n24. The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)\n\nThe third Jason Bourne film, The Bourne Ultimatum, is the best of the five-film franchise. The film follows the psychogenic amnesiac/former CIA agent Jason Bourne as he crosses paths with a reporter and a series of elite killers.\n\nDirected by Paul Greengrass, the film stars Matt Damon and Julia Stiles. The Bourne Ultimatum won three Oscars for its editing and sound and appeared on several top movies of 2007 lists. It currently holds a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n23. Top Gun: Maverick (2022)\n\nThere is no reason for the sequel to 1986’s Top Gun, Top Gun: Maverick, to be as good as it is. The film follows Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell as he returns to teach at Top Gun Academy; among his students is his deceased best friend and co-pilot’s son, Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw.\n\nThe film stars Top Gun alums Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer as well as Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Monica Barbaro, Lewis Pullman and Ed Harris. While the film's premiere was pushed back due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was a commercial and critical success upon its release in 2022. It was nominated for six Oscars, winning Best Sound. In a review for the Wrap, Alonso Duralde wrote, “Top Gun: Maverick counts as a worthy sequel in that it succeeds and fails in many of the same ways as the original.\" It is currently streaming on Amazon Prime and Paramount+.\n\n22. Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008)\n\nIt is easy to get burnt out on endless superhero film sequels in the Marvel movie era. However, some great comic book movie sequels exist, including Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Deadpool 2, Thor: Ragnarok and Blade 2. While Hellboy II: The Golden Army might not be the first superhero sequel that comes to mind, it is a bit of an underrated gem and better than 2004’s Hellboy.\n\nDirected and written by Guillermo del Toro, the film follows Hellboy and his team as they take on a prince of the underworld and his ancient army of killing machines. The film stars Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Doug Jones, Jeffrey Tambor and Luke Goss. Roger Ebert said of the film, “In every way the equal of del Toro's original Hellboy, although perhaps a little noisier, it's another celebration of his love for bizarre fantasy and diabolical machines.\" It is currently available to stream on Max.\n\n21. Drunken Master II (1994)\n\nJackie Chan has been in several good sequels, including Police Story 2, Police Story 3: Supercop, Project A 2 and even Rush Hour 2. However, Drunken Master II is probably the only sequel in Chan’s canon that eclipses the original film. Drunken Master II, sometimes called The Legend of Drunken Master, is technically a sequel to 1978’s Drunken Master. The second one is better partially due to its higher budget and remarkable fight choreography.\n\nDirected by Lau Kar-leung, Drunken Master II seamlessly blends comedy and martial arts action. The film is a comedic biopic that tells the story of a Chinese martial artist, physician and folk hero, Wong Fei-hung. It is currently available to rent on Amazon, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n20. Evil Dead II (1987)\n\nWhile there is no definitive ranking of “which Evil Dead movie is the best,” many will tell you, “the second one.” The cult classic film follows a couple’s vacation to a cabin in the woods, which is interrupted when they play a tape of ancient recitations which leads to a demonic possession.\n\nEvil Dead II is both a remake and sequel to the 1981’s Evil Dead. The film contains some of the plot points from the first film but also deviates in both story and tone. Evil Dead II is far more comedic than the original film; however, it feels right and perfectly fits into the film's campy, gory and beautifully low-budget vibe. Directed by Sam Raimi, Evil Dead II stars Bruce Campbell, Dan Hicks, Sarah Berry and Kassie Wesley. It is currently streaming for free on Plex.\n\n19. Creed (2015)\n\nMaybe Creed shouldn’t count. While it is obviously part of the Rocky canon, it might be arguably more of a spin-off than a sequel. However, since it features main characters from Rocky and happens on the same timeline, it could arguably be called a sequel. In addition, it is so good.\n\nCreed follows Adonis, the son of Apollo Creed, as he is trained by Rocky Balboa, a friend of his late father. Directed by Ryan Coogler, the film stars Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson and Phylicia Rashad. A.V. Wire's Herman Dhaliwal wrote, \"I will say the film was everything I could have ever wanted and then some. It's a film that could have gone so wrong in so many ways so easily, but the results show something that is genuine and inspired.” Creed has spawned two sequels of its own, and Creed 3 is also a phenomenal watch that could have made this list. Creed is currently streaming on Amazon Prime.\n\n18. The Raid 2 (2014)\n\nThe sequel to the Indonesian martial arts film The Raid: Redemption, The Raid 2 packs a punch. The film follows a young Mobile Brigade Corps officer who is sent undercover to expose corrupt police and their involvement with Jakarta’s powerful crime families.\n\nThe film was directed by Gareth Evans and stars Iko Uwais, Arifin Putra, Oka Antara, Tio Pakusadewo, Alex Abbad, Julie Estelle and Kazuki Kitamura. The Raid 2 is somehow even more bloody than the original film, and it was even banned in Malaysia for being too violent. However, the film was also especially praised for its pencak silat fight scenes. In an Entertainment Weekly review, Chris Nashawaty wrote, \"The Raid 2 will make you feel like Christmas came nine months early. Some action sequels don't know when to say when. But here's one where too much is just the right amount.\" It is currently streaming for free on Pluto TV or with a subscription on Paramount+.\n\n17. Desperado (1995)\n\nWhile the lead character in Robert Rodriguez’s Mexico Trilogy was recast between the first and second films, Desperado was still made to be its sequel to 1992’s El Mariachi and picks up where the first film left off. The film follows the mariachi as he becomes embroiled in a drug war on the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nDesperado stars Antonio Banderas, Joaquim de Almeida, Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin and Quentin Tarantino, and was a breakout role for Salma Hayek. While Desperado may not be better than El Mariachi, it had a far higher budget, which allowed for more impressive action making Desperado a wildly entertaining blood bath. It is available to rent on Google Play, Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n16. The Dark Knight (2008)\n\nWhile there are several good sequels in the Batman canon (Batman Returns especially comes to mind), the best Batman sequel and arguably the best Batman movie is The Dark Knight. The film is a sequel to 2005’s Batman Begins. It follows Batman as he takes on the Joker, who tries to unmask him.\n\nThe film is especially notable for Heath Ledger’s portrayal of the Joker, who unfortunately died before its release. It also stars Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Morgan Freeman, and was directed by Christopher Nolan. The film was nominated for eight Oscars and won two, including Best Supporting Actor for Ledger. The film redefined what a “superhero” movie could be. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n15. Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022)\n\nGlass Onion is the second Benoit Blanc-led Knives Out film. While it is a stand-alone sequel (which is common in the detective genre), it adds a lot to the Knives Out Universe and depth to Benoit’s character, which helps establish the franchise. Glass Onion follows Benoit as he is called to billionaire Miles Bron’s island for a lavish murder mystery party. However, Benoit quickly learns everyone at the party has a reason to want Miles dead, especially his former business partner.\n\nDirected by Rian Johnson, he film plays with the mystery genre and features some great twists and turns. It was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the Academy Awards. Upon release, many wondered if the film’s Miles Bron was inspired by real-life billionaire Elon Musk. However, Johnson has refuted this. It is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n14. Before Sunset (2004)\n\nBefore Sunset is director Richard Linklater's second movie in the Before Trilogy. It takes place nine years after Before Sunrise and follows Jesse and Céline reconnecting on an afternoon in Paris. The film feels like a conversation and has a quiet and sweet intimacy.\n\nLike all three Before films, Sunset stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who both also co-wrote the screenplay with Linklater. The film was a critical success and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Roger Ebert wrote of the film, \"Before Sunrise was a remarkable celebration of the fascination of good dialogue. But Before Sunset is better, perhaps because the characters are older and wiser, perhaps because they have more to lose (or win), and perhaps because Hawke and Delpy wrote the dialogue themselves.” It is available on rent on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n13. John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)\n\nThe sequel to 2019’s John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum, John Wick: Chapter 4 is the latest installment of the John Wick Franchise and, oddly, the best of the four. The film follows the titular hitman as he seeks revenge on the High Table, a global crime syndicate and the best of the international underworld.\n\nThe film stars Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Laurence Fishburne, Bill Skarsgård Lance Reddick, Scott Adkins, Rina Sawayama and Ian McShane. It has some of the best action scenes of the franchise (in a franchise known for action scenes) and the most iconic villain. While the film is completely over the top, that is part of the fun and what makes it a true “John Wick” film. It is currently streaming on Starz.\n\n12. Toy Story 2 (1999)\n\nThe first three Toy Story films are all great. While Toy Story 3 is a favorite of many, 2 is arguably better. Directed by John Lasseter, Toy Story 2 was originally going to be a direct-to-video sequel; however, the quality of the story reels convinced Disney to give it a theatrical release. The film follows Woody after he is stolen by a rare toy collector. He meets the rest of his toy set while his friends hope to steal him back.\n\nThe film stars Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammer. It was a critical and commercial success. Toy Story 2 won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture—Musical or Comedy and currently holds a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film is available to stream on Disney+.\n\n11. Dawn of the Dead (1978)\n\nGeorge A. Romero’s follow-up to 1968’s Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, is a zombie film classic. Dawn of the Dead stars David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger and Gaylen Ross. The film has several cuts, and while you cannot go wrong with the extended cut, many prefer the Euro cut for non-English-speaking countries.\n\nThe film follows a radio station worker, his girlfriend and two SWAT team members as they hide from hordes of zombies in a shopping mall. The film is gory, violent and packed with social commentary. It is currently available to rent on Amazon Prime.\n\n10. Bride of Frankenstein (1935)\n\nThe earliest film on this list, Bride of Frankenstein proves that sequels have been part of Hollywood’s DNA for decades. Bride of Frankenstein is a sequel to 1931’s Frankenstein. The film follows Dr. Frankenstein as his former mentor pressures him to resume his experiments to create another Frankenstein’s monster while his original monster remains on the run.\n\nDirected by James Whale, the film stars Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Valerie Hobson, Ernest Thesiger and Elsa Lanchester. The film features several scenes and motifs that were incredibly racy by 1930s standards. It was censored both in the states and abroad (including being banned in Trinidad, Palestine and Hungary, and Sweden wanted to cut so many scenes that Universal refused to screen it there.) While it may seem campy to a modern audience, that is part of its charm, and much of it holds up incredibly well for its age. It is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n9. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)\n\nThe second movie of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, continues the three interconnected plots introduced in the previous movie, Fellowship of the Ring. The film follows two hobbits on a quest to destroy an enchanted ring while other members of their fellowship journey to a besieged kingdom whose king is under a spell.\n\nDirected by Peter Jackson, the film has a large ensemble cast featuring Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving and Andy Serkis. The film was a huge financial and critical success. It was nominated for six Oscars, winning two. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a rare franchise in which all the films are equally high quality. While The Two Towers made this list, the third film in the franchise, Return of the King, could have also easily taken this spot. Really, all three films are must-watches especially for fans of high fantasy. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is currently streaming on Max.\n\n8. Election 2 (2006)\n\nWhile many sequels are great, few surpass the original film. Election 2 is better than 2000’s Election. Sometimes also called Triad Election, Election 2 follows a crime boss who decides to run for an unheard-of second term as the leader of his syndicate.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Johnnie To, the director of Election 2, is synonymous with great crime films, and Election 2 is arguably his best. It stars Louis Koo, Simon Yam, Nick Cheung, Cheung Siu-fai, Lam Suet and Gordon Lam. The film was first shown at the Hong Kong International Film Festival and out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival. It currently holds 96% on Rotten Tomatoes (the first Election has an 86%). Election 2 is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n7. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\nMaybe Mad Max: Fury Road shouldn’t count as a sequel. While it almost seems like a reboot, director George Miller had the idea for the film since the late 1980s. However, several setbacks, recasting and delays separated it from the original Mad Max trilogy. The film follows Max as he helps Imperator Furiosa smuggle women away from the Warlord Immortan Joe.\n\nThe film is not the first great sequel from Miller, who also directed Mad Max 2, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and Babe: Pig in the City. Mad Max: Fury Road stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult and Hugh Keays-Byrne. It was nominated for ten Oscars, winning six. The film’s effects, sound and design are especially notable. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n6. Aliens (1986)\n\nDirected by James Cameron, Aliens is a sequel to Ridley Scott’s 1979 horror/sci-fi classic, Alien. Cameron already proved he could helm a great sequel after 1984’s Terminator 2 and 1985’s Rambo: First Blood Part II. Aliens takes place 57 years after the events of Alien. In it, Lt. Ripley is found in a stasis state. She is retrieved by a deep space team and asked to use her experience to take out hundreds of Aliens who have overrun a colony while protecting its lone human survivor.\n\nThe film stars Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen and Carrie Henn. While Alien is firmly a Sci-Fi/horror film, Aliens feels more Sci-Fi/action. This shift makes Aliens a lot more accessible and easier to watch, especially for viewers who aren’t looking for the claustrophobic experience of Alien. Aliens was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Weaver. The film is also hugely influential on the action genre. It is available to stream on Max, Hulu and Disney+.\n\n5. The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nWhile also sometimes called Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back, The Empire Strikes Back is both a direct sequel to 1977’s Star Wars and the fifth movie in the Star Wars Franchise (after the addition of three prequel films in the 1990s). The film follows Luke Skywalker on his quest to train as a Jedi while his friends, Han Solo and Princess Leia, rebel against the Galactic Empire and its leader, Darth Vader.\n\nThe film stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Billy Dee Williams. Directed by Irvin Kershner, it originally received mixed reviews. However, the film still won two Academy Awards. It has since been reevaluated and considered one of the best films in the Star Wars Franchise. The film’s cliffhanger ending, visual effects, and quotable dialogue have left a huge cultural impact, from “I know” to “I am your father.” It is currently streaming on Disney+.\n\n4. From Russia with Love (1963)\n\nWhile many James Bond films are technically great sequels, it just feels right to highlight the original “James Bond 2,” From Russia with Love. The sequel to the first James Bond film, 1962’s Dr. No, From Russia with Love actually ranks higher than the original on Rotten Tomatoes (97% vs. 95%.)\n\nIn From Russia with Love, James Bond returns to take on a secret crime organization known as SPECTRE and the mounting Cold War. Terence Young returned to direct, and the film stars Sean Connery, Pedro Armendáriz, Lotte Lenya Robert Shaw, Bernard Lee and Daniela Bianchi. The film is a perfect sequel. It keeps a lot about what made the first film great but delivers more action, gadgets and even a better chase scene (with help from a much higher budget)... so, very James Bond. It is available to rent on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n3. Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)\n\nAnother iconic sequel by director James Cameron, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, is not only a perfect follow-up to 1984’s The Terminator but also a near-perfect film overall. Terminator 2 follows John Connor, who in the future will be the key to humans defeating the robot uprising. While a new and improved Terminator, the T-1000, is sent to the past to kill John, the T-800 bonds with John as the two go on the run with John’s mother Sarah Connor.\n\nThe film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick. While the Terminator franchise now has six films and several series, Terminator 2 is often ranked as the best. It won four Oscars, including Best Visual Effects. It is available to stream for free on Pluto TV or with subscription on Paramount+.\n\n2. Paddington 2 (2017)\n\nWhile Paddington (2014) is a delightful family film, Paddington 2 surpassed it in every way to become one of the best family films of all time. Paddington 2 follows the titular bear as he tries to buy a gift for his Aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, only to be falsely convicted of a crime he didn’t commit.\n\nThe film is heartwarming, funny, tear-inducing and beautifully made. Directed by Paul King, Paddington 2 stars Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Brendan Gleeson, Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent, Peter Capaldi, Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw. For several years, the film scored 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and ranked even higher than Citizen Kane on the site. However, in 2021, one negative review brought its ranking down to a 99%. The film explores themes of immigration, found family, anti-Brexit sentiments and inequalities in the justice system while still being about a clumsy bear who loves marmalade. In the 2022 film The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, the main characters bond over watching the film, leading Pedro Pascal to deliver the line, “I cried through the entire thing. It made me want to be a better man.” It is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n1. The Godfather Part II (1974)\n\nThe Godfather Part I is a classic. However, The Godfather Part II is somehow even better. It is the film most think of when they think of “sequels better than the original” for a reason. The film follows the Corleones, a powerful 1950s mob family and tells the story of the new Don of the Corleone family, Michael Corleone, and his father, Vito Corleone.\n\nWhile the film was initially met with mixed reviews, it was quickly reevaluated. The Godfather Part II was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, winning six. It was also the first sequel to win Best Picture. The film stars Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Lee Strasberg and was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. In 2014, Peter Bradshaw said of the film, \"Francis Coppola's breathtakingly ambitious prequel-sequel to his first Godfather movie is as gripping as ever. It is even better than the first film and has the greatest single final scene in Hollywood history, a real coup de cinéma.\" It is currently streaming on Paramount+.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSometimes, it isn’t bad to go back for another look. Some sequels are better than the original, and others are just great follow-ups. However, all of the sequels on this list are excellent films in their own right."
