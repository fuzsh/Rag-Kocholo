        "text": "Swedish director Lukas Moodysson's film Lilya 4-Ever has won five major awards at his country's equivalent of the Oscars.\n\nThe film tells the harrowing story of teenager Lilya whose attempts to escape her life of hardship in the former Soviet Union see her being forced into prostitution and trafficked into Sweden.\n\nScreen Daily reports that Russian actress Oksana Akinshina, who plays Lilya, won the best actress prize at the Guldbagge awards, Moodysson was voted best director, and the film received the best film award. It also received the awards for best script and best photography.\n\nMoodysson, who has a reputation as an outspoken artist, previously upset a Guldbagge awards ceremony when he gave the audience the finger in 1999 after his first film Fucking Amal (released in this country as Show Me Love) won four awards.\n\nThis year's speech was less controversial in that he only asked that people fight injustice. Lilya 4-Ever is released in the UK later this year."
