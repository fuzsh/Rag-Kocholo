However, her mother leaves her and went to The United States with her boyfriend. The mother never responded or replied to her daughter. In a rage, Lilya burned her mother's photography. Lilya befriends a boy Volodya, who got in love with Lilya. however, Lilya refused to date Volodya, due to him being younger than her.\n\nAs the mother went to the United States, Lilya lived with her relative, who moved Lilya into another apartment, due to not having enough money. Lilya befriends a girl Natasha, who does prostitutes. Natasha and Lilya went into a bar, and Natasha did \"her job\". However, Natasha's father found out, and Natasha blamed Lilya that the money she earned was Lilya's, so Natasha and her father give Lilya her money.\n\nIn school, Lilya asks Natasha what happened, and she tells her the truth. Lilya gets upset, and Natasha's friends begin picking on Lilya. Since Lilya did not have enough money, Lilya began prostitution herself. She had sex with two adult men, and one night a young man known as Andrei seduces Lilya. Andrei told Lilya that they will move to Sweden, and that they will live a normal life together, and that he will get her a job.\n\nVolodya tried to tell Lilya that that was a lie and that she should ditch him. However, Lilya refused to listen and went with Andrei to Sweden. This made Volodya take his own life since he has no one left anymore. Lilya ends up meeting her boss Witek. Witek raped Lilya and became her pimp. We see that Lilya began being constantly raped by adult men all the time.\n\nLilya began having visions of her best friend Volodya as an angel. Lilya couldn't deal with her life anymore, so she jumped off a bridge. The medical team arrived and tried to help Lilya. Lilya ends up opening her eyes, but it's unknown if she survived or not."
