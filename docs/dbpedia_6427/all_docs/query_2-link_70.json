        "text": "Director: Lukas Moodysson\n\nStars: Oksana Akinshina, Artyom Bogucharskiy, Pavel Ponomaryov\n\nUn-4-gettable\n\nThose who know me well will know that depressing cinema is my kind of thing. Any film that can take you on a powerful and draining experience is a film well worth seeing in my book, so when I heard about how gruelling Lukas Moodysson’s third feature, Lilya 4-Ever, was I just had to seek it out. Whilst I can understand why most people would find it completely bemusing as to why someone would want to watch a film where the protagonist is put through hell, this is the kind of film I really admire when done right. Lilya 4-Ever is done right, and whilst it’s by no means an easy watch, it’s an important one which everyone should make time to see.\n\nThe film opens to Rammstein, a heavy metal German rock band used more recently in Lars von Trier’s latest near-masterpiece, Nymphomaniac. They play over a horrendous and ominous image of our hero, Lilya, running from something and covered in bruises. The entire film is a flashback which leads up to this emotive image, and it’s an image which assured me that this was going to be a film to remember.\n\nLilya 4-Ever opens with a sense of hope and optimism with Lilya looking forward to going to start a new life in America and leaving her Russian slum. However, this is quickly crushed within the first 10 minutes. Her mother abandons her and leaves her at the mercy of her hard-hearted Aunt who offers as little support as possible. Things go from bad to worse and eventually end up at the worst. Lukas does a wonderful job at immersing the audience in the world of Lilya. The raw handheld directing is reminiscent of our own cuddly pessimist, Lars Von Trier.\n\nIn fact, Lilya 4-Ever would’ve made a welcome replacement for The Idiots in Lars’ golden hearts trilogy. The film is very much like Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves in that it takes a likable and generally kind-hearted female and then the world mercilessly rips her apart. It’s about as far away from Hollywood as you can get, but unfortunately this is the world we’re living in. Someone, somewhere in the world is having a life like Lilya and Moodysson does a damn convincing job at portraying this.\n\nThe authenticity of the film isn’t least helped by 15 year-old Oksana Akinshina’s stellar performance. I believed her in every frame and sometimes she just broke my heart. It was so nice to see her in those rare moments where she’s smiling and laughing, and trying to make the most out of her dreadful situation. The moments when she’s at her lowest are the most sould-crushing, and Oksana often conveys more emotion in just one heart-breaking expression than most actors manage to do in a career.\n\nLilya 4-Ever is an experience that is hard to forget. It didn’t quite make me cry, but I’m not ashamed to admit that I welled up in more than one place. What makes the film even more crushing to watch is that you know that it’s completely true and that this stuff has happened and is happening to people across the world. It’s not a film you instantly forget the next day, and to me that’s the mark of a truly great film. The ending is beautifully done and is powerful enough to move mountains. As I said before, Lilya isn’t an easy film to watch, but very much like the equally distressing 12 Years a Slave, it has such an important message that it needs to be seen by everyone.\n\nDirector: David Lynch\n\nStars: Jack Nance, Charlotte Stewart, Allen Joseph\n\nOff your head!\n\nNote: This review was written before I saw Blue Velvet\n\nEraserhead finished at 12 ‘O clock last night for me. It was my first time experiencing the film and being a huge fan of David Lynch (my new favourite director) you can only imagine how excited I was. It’s now half past eleven in the morning and Eraserhead is still whirling around in my very own head. The film is extraordinary. I’ve seen my fair share of weird films, from Jan Svankmajer’s Conspirators of Pleasure to Lynch’s very own Inland Empire, but somehow Eraserhead manages to surpass them both in the weirdness department. Indeed, Eraserhead is probably the weirdest film I have ever seen. It’s pure Lynch and pure art. It’s a film which you could not put into words; it’s something you have to experience for yourself.\n\nWhen the film was over, my sister and I sat there in silence as the credits rolled up. My heart was thumping quickly and loudly. I felt utterly horrified by what I had just watched. I was drained and could hardly walk in a straight line afterwards. I don’t get scared very often at all, but Eraserhead actually did frighten me. Its atmosphere is choking, unsettling and disturbing. The images are stuff you wouldn’t even be able to find in nightmares.\n\nYour enjoyment of Eraserhead is partly down to how you view it. If you watch it in broad daylight with kids running around and not paying too much attention to it, then you’re not going to like it. You’re going to think it’s the biggest pile of shitake you’ve ever seen and I wouldn’t blame you for saying that! To fully experience Eraserhead (and with every other David Lynch film) you must immerse yourself in it. Watch it alone, in the dark, with the sound turned up and an open mind then you will experience something truly unique.\n\nThe film is virtually plot-less. Or at least it seems that way when you first see it, but I’m convinced that if you dig underneath all the bizarre symbolism then you will find something quite rich and astonishing. It resembles a feature length version of one of David’s shorts, especially The Grandmother and it’s all the more better for it. I didn’t feel like I was watching a film at all, rather I felt like I was having a nightmare. It didn’t even feel like I was watching a nightmare. It felt like I was literally having a nightmare! Eraserhead is scene after scene of bizarre and incredibly frightening imagery. It’s enough to make a person go insane.\n\nDavid Lynch’s directing here is as amazing as it has ever been. He creates a chilling atmosphere with the use of a droning industrial soundtrack which is excruciating to listen to at times. He also makes incredible use of a slow pace and startling black and white photography which has an eerie beauty about it. It’s a seriously depressing atmosphere and it’s one which will stay with you for a long time after seeing it. The dream-like quality of the film is astonishing. When the lady in the radiator started singing I felt disturbed, bewildered and transfixed all at the same time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for the duration of the film.\n\nIt also feels like it’s on for an eternity when you’re watching it and I don’t mean that in a bad way. It enhances the nightmarish quality as when you have a dream it feels like you’re there forever, but when you wake up you can only remember bits. Eraserhead is exactly like this. It’s a nightmare captured on film and confirms David Lynch as a master of cinema. His films are unlike any other and they manage to affect me in such a deep manner. I was shaken when Eraserhead had finished and it brought back memories of when I saw Inland Empire for the first time.\n\nHaving said all this, Eraserhead is not a film for a mainstream audience. Not everyone will ‘get it’ and I wouldn’t blame you if you hated it. Strange doesn’t even begin to describe Eraserhead. All I know is that it’s a masterpiece. It’s a piece of timeless art that was way ahead of its time and still very much is. You’ll see the world in a different way when you’ve finished watching it and every other film will seem dull and conventional. Eraserhead will stay with me for an extremely long time and is an experience I will never ever forget. Roll on Blue Velvet!\n\nDirector: Chul-Soo Jang\n\nStars: Yeong-hie Seo, Seong-won Jie, Min-ho Hwang\n\nHits you like a bucket full of bean paste!\n\nKorea is such a stand-out country for delivering consistently sensational horror films, often in the revenge department. Oldboy is nothing short of a masterpiece and I Saw the Devil is one favourite films ever. The Koreans aren’t afraid to push the barrier and also never fail to deliver a few large helpings of emotional wallops. They put a lot of effort into writing their characters, in order for the audience to invest in the film. Bedevilled is no different.\n\nBedevilled is yet another example of Korean superiority. Thank goodness the loopy Kim Jong-Un has left South Korea alone because otherwise we wouldn’t be getting these incredible pieces of art (or Psy!) which are important to our society. Bedevilled is a slow burner, but it’s anything but boring. It takes it time in setting up its two female characters so the audience can care about them (even if one of them is a little more than unlikable) and thus not care about the slow pace of the film. However, I would say that if you’re only into some slashing and dashings with thrills and spills, then stay clear, because Bedevilled delivers something much more than that.\n\nI think that Bedevilled is more complex than just a ‘revenge movie’ and I think too many people dismiss it as just that. To me Bedevilled was about a lonely woman who had been subjected to years of abuse from her husband and lack of support from the few islanders, yet always pushed it aside and treated it as nothing, until she cracks. I found Bedevilled very psychological and it brilliantly portrays the tragic mental breakdown of an isolated woman who just can’t take any more abuse.\n\nThe build up in Bedevilled is nothing short of brilliant. I loved the way it slowly switched main characters about a quarter of a way through. We initially follow a hard-nosed woman working in mainland Seoul who then goes over to a small island where her grandfather used to live to see her friend. Initially we don’t really think much of her friend, because we’ve been following Hae-Wan who is also very self-centred. However, the film slowly allows Kim Bok-Nam (the friend) to surface and we begin to feel an unbelievable amount of sympathy for her as she’s so badly treated by her husband.\n\nAs I said before the build up is slow but extremely effective. I didn’t find it boring in the slightest because it allowed the characters to develop, which in turn made the film more and more gripping as it went along. Eventually Bedevilled does explode after some truly shocking and devastating moments, but should we really be rooting for Kim Bok-Nam all the way? Bedevilled ends up being incredibly thought-provoking as well as exciting and visceral. The final moments pack quite an emotional punch and will have you glued to the screen. I especially liked the match cut which compared Hae-Wan to the island, suggesting a deep inner conflict with herself.\n\nBedevilled is yet another masterful Korean film which manages to tick all the boxes. The actresses also end up being quite exceptional in their respective roles. The film also looks gorgeous in blu-ray, I’d highly recommend it. The cinematography is often breath-taking which adds an usual quality later on as the beautiful back-drop is also used for the scenery of such vile and hideous acts. Bedevilled is well worth your time and money. It reminds you just how amazing foreign films are.\n\nDirector: Scott Derrickson\n\nStars: Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Dalton Thompson\n\nIt takes a lot to scare me… This did!\n\nEver since the very first trailer came out I thought, “now this looks good!” However, some quite poor reviews came in so my dreams were shattered slightly. But then suddenly some rave reviews came out, even from my favourite critic, Chris Tookey who gave it 5 stars! My faith was suddenly re-installed and I was incredibly excited to see it. It didn’t disappoint!\n\nWith “The Cabin in the Woods” and now “Sinister”, 2012 is restoring my faith in modern horror. It’s a truly outstanding film that had me gripped for its entire 115 minutes. The film doesn’t dawdle about too much either, it opens with a highly unsettling clip of found footage and then we get a beautiful swooping shot of a man and his family moving in to a new house. It’s a standard set-up that we’ve even seen a few months ago in the surprisingly fun horror, “The Possession” but it’s a clever one because we’re mostly focused on our hero and in a sense that is what the film is about. His obsession with himself and trying to be re-ignite his fame after writing a highly successful debut true crime novel, followed by several duds.\n\nI was quite surprised as to how much exposition was given to the main character and it only makes the film even more compelling than it is. He’s also played brilliantly by Ethan Hawke, who makes up for the lack of acting skills his wife possesses. It reminded me a little of “The Shining” with the egotistical novelist stumbling upon a certain ghostly history, and it certainly contains the same amount of creepy moments. Ethan stumbles upon the super 8 films quite quickly which I was surprised and pleased about, as all too often there’s a belated exposition before anything remotely frightening happens.\n\nThese super 8 films are masterpieces in themselves. It’s a sort of car crash effect, as you don’t really want to see them, but you can’t stop watching. They’re all incredibly creepy, unsettling and sinister (like what I did there?) They are also set-up perfectly with the horrible grainy picture, silence as well as highly unsettling music that all adds to the creepiness. All of them are engaging and compelling to watch. They’re also very chilling and are sure to engrave themselves into your mind for a long time after the film has finished.\n\nFrom then on it’s an intriguing and creepy mystery as more and more disturbing information is uncovered. It’s also clever how it’s unclear if some of what Ethan’s seeing is actually real or not. Is he really hearing noises or is it just the whisky talking? I liked the whole family element as well, showing the protagonist as not just some perfect hero, but also as a flawed character. The whole strained relationship with his wife is a fantastic element on top of the central ghost story. Although the woman who plays her is incredibly wooden!\n\nThere’s a strong, unsettling atmosphere that underlies through the whole film. The demon man is also quite frightening and not too much is explained about him which certainly adds to scare factor. I’ve heard people call this a boring film and a bad film, but it’s none of these things. It’s a genuinely horrifying horror film with fantastic writing and directing. It’s the type of film that gets under your skin and leaves its print in your mind for a long time after the credits have rolled. The ending is one of the most disturbing things I’ve ever seen in a horror film and I’ve seen many!\n\n“Sinister” is a ghost story of Japanese proportions. By the end, I was actually terrified and had chills all down my back, which is something that doesn’t happen too often. I never get scared watching films, but after this and seeing “Noroi: The Curse” which also frightened me, I was starting to think that I was becoming soft! But then I thought no. These are just brilliantly scary films that are high on atmosphere and don’t solely rely on jump scares like too many American ghost films. “Sinister” is one of the best horror films this year. It has a relentless sense of dread throughout and is also incredibly effective and compelling. I can’t wait to see it again, and also can’t urge you enough to go and see it for yourself! Although, I’d recommend a night light for when you sleep.\n\nDirector: Gaspar Noe\n\nStars: Vincent Cassel, Monica Bellucci, Albert Dupontel\n\nHits you like a ton of fire extinguishers\n\nfirst heard about Irreversible all those years ago when I was really getting into the new wave of extreme French horror. However, I was only about 15 at this time and when I was hearing about how disturbing Irreversible was with its intense 10 minute long rape scene, I decided that I’d hang on a bit. I finally decided to buy it a few months ago and only watched it last night. I was beyond excited for Irreversible. All the rave reviews made it sound like something I’d love and guess what. I did.\n\nThis isn’t my first taste of Gaspar Noe as I have seen I Stand Alone, which I liked a great deal. The directing was incredibly stylish and the violence brutally shocking, however I felt like it lacked potential. I thought it could’ve been something really great if it had a stronger plot, as it was basically just a depraved butcher walking around and giving vile monologues on how much he hates life. I still liked it though, and I especially saw the potential in Gaspar Noe as a film maker. It’s Irreversible where Noe shines like a penny.\n\nThe film instantly grabbed me with its seriously unusual opening. The credits roll back up and sort of spin around to show the title card, “Irreversible” with some unsettling music playing in the background. The camera then spins in an incredibly disorientating manner to show a creepy shot of the butcher from I Stand Alone. The actors’ names then all flash up on the screen in a super stylish manner which utterly gripped me. It’s one of the best title sequences I’ve seen, but enough about titles. There’s much more to Irreversible than that.\n\nIrreversible begins in the depths of hell and ends in some sort of stroboscopic utopia. It’s a startling contrast and a brilliant one. The opening is incredibly intense as Marcus and Pierre enter a frightening gay club called, “The Rectum”. Marcus is full of rage and we have no idea why. He marches through the club asking anyone and everyone where “The Tape Worm” is. The directing here is nothing short of masterful. The camerawork is like Darren Aronofsky on acid and his very own slimming pills. It’s all done in one shot, making it incredibly intense as the camera hypnotically floats around in a chaotic and disorientating close-up. Not only that but there’s a startling siren soundtrack which only serves to heighten the intense atmosphere.\n\nI was shocked to see that the much talked about fire extinguisher scene was in this early on. It very much feels like the climax of the film as it’s full of such anger, rage and raw intensity. It’s easy to see why the extinguisher scene is so talked about as it’s unflinchingly graphic and extraordinarily brutal, however to say it’s gratuitous is ridiculous as it doesn’t feel like glamorised movie violence at all. It feels frighteningly real and is extremely relevant to the film’s characters and themes.\n\nJust like Christopher Nolan’s masterpiece, Memento the film is told in reverse. At first I wasn’t sure if it worked entirely as all the horror and the madness was placed near the beginning which means the film becomes more and more soft, however then I realised that it was the perfect way to tell the story. Not only does it show that violent actions cannot be reversed, but it also allows us to feel sympathy for the characters and forces us to place ourselves in their shoes as we play detective.\n\nEach scene plays out largely in one take which adds to the film’s hyper-realistic atmosphere. The first half is concerned with Marcus finding the perpetrator so the directing is erratic which creates an atmosphere of chaos and rage, whereas the second half is concerned with showing the relationship between Marcus and Alex, so the directing is slower and more controlled. It showcases how much camerawork can contribute to a film.\n\nNow, you can’t talk about Irreversible without talking about the infamous rape scene which occurs half-way through the film and is the most important scene in the film. It feels far too real as the camera shakily follows Alex down the underground tunnel and encounters a deranged sadist who brutally rapes her. This scene feels all the more harrowing as up until now the camera has been insanely mobile and hypnotically dreamlike. Here Noe keeps the camera deathly still like Haneke, as we’re forced to endure Alex’s ordeal. It almost feels like the audience is being raped too. It’s shocking and shockingly realistic. The only time the camera moves during the 10 minutes is when the stranger picks up Alex’s head and slams it on the floor. The camera moves in order for the audience to witness this brutality in unflinching detail.\n\nSome have called this scene gratuitous and even accused it of titillating the audience which I find ridiculous. Rape is something that happens all the time, yet most films are too scared to tackle it. Noe tackles the issue head on and shows us all what rape is really like. It isn’t pretty and it isn’t supposed to be either. Only a sadist would find the scene a turn on.\n\nThe rest of the film is mainly concerned with showing us the relationship between Alex and Marcus. It’s all the more tragic to watch as we know how the night is going to turn out, whilst the characters are utterly oblivious. The directing is still absolutely stunning. I loved the party sequence which follows Marcus, Alex and Pierre around all in one shot with deafening music. It feels like you’re actually there! We’re also treated to some detailed conversations about sex on a subway and a heart-breaking romantic scene between Alex and Marcus. These scenes have a layered and tragic quality about them as we know exactly what is going to happen next.\n\nThe acting is extraordinary. Vincent Cassel is the best I’ve ever seen him be and the relationship between the characters is utterly believable. Although it does help that Vincent and Monica were actually in a relationship during the time of filming (I don’t know if they still are). Monica is also sensational, especially during the gruelling rape scene where I could’ve almost cried out for her. The end scene is unlike anything I’ve ever seen and will stay with me for a long time.\n\nIrreversible is a harrowing masterpiece. The scenes of violence and sexual violence are the most shocking I’ve ever seen. It isn’t a gratuitous film; it’s simply a film which wants to show you the dark side of life. Time destroys everything as we do not know what the future has in store for us. It’s a tragic and powerful piece of filmmaking with extraordinary directing and acting. Small-minded critics may mistake the film as a gratuitous piece of work, but it really isn’t. Irreversible feels real and is an intense and powerful experience which I’d recommend with caution.\n\nDirector: Fabrice Du Welz\n\nStars: Laurent Lucas, Jackie Berroyer, Philippe Nahon\n\nCalvaire often gets accused of ripping off films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deliverance… I think it’s even better than them both!\n\nThe French always shock me in the quality of horror films they produce. France really know what horror is about and produce some of the most disturbing and grisly films I have ever seen. “High Tension”, “Frontiers”, “Martyrs”, “Inside”, “Seven Days”. All of these films are different in their style and story lines, but they all share two things in common, they’re French and they are some of the best horror films to ever grace our screens. And now we can add “The Ordeal”. I don’t know why it took me so long to actually get hold of “The Ordeal” but this Christmas I thought that I’d finally get my hands on it just to see if it is as good as the rest I’ve listed. And I can safely say that this is one of the best horror films I have ever seen.\n\n“The Ordeal” should be a horror classic. It’s one of the scariest, disturbing and unique horror films I have ever witnessed. It is so intriguing and expertly executed and also very well acted. I also think it’s important to watch it without knowing much about it, don’t read any reviews or watch any clips or trailers, all you need to know is it’s about a singer’s car who breaks down and he goes on quite a terrifying ordeal which is complete demented brilliance. I’ll try not to spoil things too much, but if I were you I wouldn’t read this review either.\n\nI loved “The Ordeal” and would put it up there in my top 10 horror films, just for it being genuinely really scary. What makes everything so terrifying is that Marc Stevens is the only sane person we meet throughout the entire film, he’s someone who we can relate to, but he can’t relate to anyone else. As soon as his car breaks down their is this fantastic feeling of dread that carries on and increases throughout the film, as things begin to get even more insane.\n\n“The Ordeal” also doesn’t pull stops. It’s not afraid to go the extra mile to shock, yet it can still shock without showing any violent imagery. There are some sequences in “The Ordeal” that will always stick with me, I know it will be a film i will never forget and will definitely be revisiting more than once! It feels like their are so many iconic moments, and it should be a 5 star horror classic! It is also amazingly shot, it feels very realistic despite its often outlandish behaviour, thanks to the use of long drawn out shots, as well as a genius use of camera work during the dinner which takes dizzying intensity to a whole new level. You can also feel a lot of sympathy for the main character who just seems like a regular nice man who really does not deserve any of the extreme abuse he receives. Everyone is crazy except Marc Stevens, combining this with long shots of the outside country, you get a really terrifying feel of isolation.\n\nIt can often feel quite funny, and I can imagine a lot of people laughing at what is going on, but for me I found the unnatural actions so absurd and disturbing that I couldn’t do anything but feel petrified like the character! The writing is spectacular and combines a whole mix of new and vibrant ideas that are incredibly original. Sometimes it throws in moments that are never explained or mentioned which makes for very disturbing viewing, like the random people who stand in the background in red hooded coats, or the really disturbing villagers dance in the pub.\n\nI do feel that I need to talk about the ending. “The Ordeal” comes to a rather inconclusive and abrupt ending and I didn’t know how to take that. At first I thought that it brought the whole film down and it deserved a proper closed narrative, but then I thought that it ended perfectly on a rather disturbing note. I was expecting a big twist or explanation for why the villagers behaved like they did but their wasn’t one, which only adds another big stroke to why “The Ordeal” is really so scary and disturbing.\n\nI know I’ve gone on quite a bit here, but right now I am really in love with this film. It is beautifully shot with some perfect cinematography and offers an extremely twisted, disturbing narrative that is sure to haunt your mind and nightmares. Basically to me it’s a horror classic and is basically horror perfection. It is completely gripping, highly original and quite simply unforgettable. I can’t wait to watch “The Ordeal” again.\n\nDirector: Lars von Trier\n\nStars: Kirsten Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Kiefer Sutherland, John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling\n\nThe end is night, but hopefully not for Lars’ film-making career!\n\nLars Von Trier is a man I admire very much as a director, but not as a person. He may come across as the cuddly and vulnerable Dane in his interviews but this is a self-confessed pervert who makes sick jokes about sympathising with Hitler and a misogynist who had an affair with his very own babysitter. Lars is not a pleasant man. However, his films are often remarkable. They can range from the boringly pretentious (The Idiots) to the emotionally sublime (Dancer in the Dark) but they always provoke a strong reaction and he isn’t afraid to push the envelope. I’m please to say that Melancholia is another near-masterpiece from Lars.\n\nI reacted to Melancholia in an extremely similar way to the first film in his depression trilogy, Antichrist. When I first saw Antichrist I didn’t know what to think really. I found a lot of it boring, yet I was continuously fascinated with it. After it finished, I couldn’t get it out of my head and I knew that I wanted to see it again. I know consider it a remarkable horror film and don’t find it boring at all on subsequent viewings. Similarly, once Melancholia finished I didn’t know if I liked it or not, but I couldn’t get it out of my head and I knew that I wanted to see it again.\n\nAfter reading some fascinating analysis’ and allowing the film to sink in a bit, I now consider it a thoroughly interesting work of brilliance. I wasn’t sure what to expect from Melancholia, but I didn’t expect what I got. I knew the film was going to be something pretty amazing from the gorgeous opening. It’s reminiscent of the extraordinary prologue to Antichrist as it depicts perfect, artistic shots in slow motion with classical music being played. Many would find it pretentious, and perhaps it is, but I loved it. I was transfixed in a way that is very similar to when I’d watch a David Lynch film. I felt mesmerised by its dream-like quality.\n\nThe first half of the film focuses on Kirsten Dunst’s character, Justine as she trudges through an awkward and stodgy wedding party. It’s slow, but I didn’t find it boring. I found it fascinating to see how the characters interact. At first glance there’s not a lot going on, but if you dig a little deeper there’s a lot of important stuff happening to Justine. She’s hiding her depression and there’s a lot of hints as to what’s causing it: Her thoroughly pessimistic mother perhaps? (wonderfully played by Charlotte Rampling) or her father who seems uninterested in her life? The closing scenes to this segment are also quite bizarre and suggest that bigger things are happening here.\n\nThe second part focuses more on Claire. Charlotte Gainsbourg is again quite brilliant in her role as a woman shaken about the idea of the world ending, but it’s Kirsten Dunst who really shines in this part as a crippled depressive who can barely walk. It’s a shattering performance and one which I didn’t think Kirsten was capable of. It’s beautifully shot by Lars and directed with his signature documentary style which makes the catastrophe feel frighteningly real and thought provoking. The film looks truly stunning in blu-ray and I’d recommend paying the extra pounds for it!\n\nMelancholia is a slow film, but an interesting one. The second part is especially atmospheric and gorgeously captured. The film’s final scenes literally had my heart beating because the sense of panic really leaps off of the screen. The end shot is especially haunting and very symbolic. Essentially the film is saying death is inevitable and there is nothing. It’s depressing, yet incredibly interesting. Perhaps the film isn’t about the end of the world at all, but instead one huge metaphor for depression. Whatever it’s about, I found it fascinating and extremely deep. The acting is superb and the directing and cinematography are even better. It’s one which I look forward to revisiting as I think you’ll be able to get a lot out of it on second viewing.\n\nDirector: Bela Tarr\n\nStars: Erika Bok, Janos Derzsi\n\nYou’ll get more enjoyment from staring at a horse for two and a half hours\n\nBela Tarr was a filmmaker I had never heard of until I read a wonderful article in a blog called www.magnoliaforever.blogspot.com. I noticed that the person who wrote this blog had a very similar interest in films to me, and so when I heard him rave about The Turin Horse and how Bela Tarr was one of his favourite ever directors, I just had to seek it out! Now, I had heard some peculiar things about this film that did put me off slightly. I heard that it was two and a half hours in length and only had 30 shots. Don’t get me wrong, I love a long take as much as the next fat person, but 30 in 150 minutes sounded excessive and potentially tedious. I also heard that the film had no plot at all and just followed an old man and his daughter going about their day-to-day business, which put me off. However, The Turin Horse had such rave reviews from everyone who had seen it. The imagery did look beautiful, and I was really looking forward to experiencing something unique and new. Unfortunately my fears were pretty much met.\n\nI’ve seen some crushingly boring films in my time. The highlights of boredom (or lowlights) for me would have to be the Austrian snooze-fest, Import/Export which I watched because it appeared on Film 4’s extreme season, where they showed pretty hardcore stuff. I had never heard of it and decided to give it a go and was met with the dullest thing I had ever seen. This was the most boring film I had seen, until I set my bleeding eyes on the Hungarian art-house drama, Uzak. A film which basically followed two of the most boring characters on the planet watching TV and wondering around the house and street aimlessly. It was the first film I had actually hit fast-forward on.\n\nWhilst, The Turin Horse isn’t quite as inexplicably boring as these two films, it is still probably one of the most boring films I’ve seen. Like Uzak, it’s Hungarian, and if I’ve learnt anything from Hungarian films it’s that Hungary must be the most lifeless place on Earth. The Turin Horse actually manages to outdo Uzak in terms of boring characters, and gives us THE two most boring characters on the planet. A grunting father and daughter who live in the middle of nowhere and only speak when they have something to grumble about. If these two met up for coffee with the two brothers from Uzak, I could only imagine the stimulating, jovial conversation that would flow between them!\n\nThe Turin Horse is hardcore arthouse. I’m into arthouse films when they offer some sort of story of experience. I just can’t get my head around films where literally nothing happens. Some people find art in watching the mundane activities of life, but I’m afraid that it just does not interest me. For me, The Turin Horse was basically the same short film being repeated six times, as it takes place over six very long days. It goes like this: They get up, the daughter dresses her father because he’s far too boring to dress himself, she goes out to the well and fills up some buckets, brings them in. Then they have a muck about with the most tragically lifeless horse you’ve ever seen (I think boredom catches), and then they eat a potato and go to bed. Repeat. I didn’t find anything “mesmerising” or “gripping” in these activities, as many reviewers have stated.\n\nWhatever you do, don’t believe the DVD’s blurb! The blurb actually makes it sound like a really interesting apocalyptic thriller. It says that the film has left audiences “gasping for breath” which was obviously just mistaken for audiences being rudely woken up when the film had finally finished. Apparently there are “a bizarre series of disturbing events” unless this counts the arrival of some gypsies who get shooed away by the father, because they obviously brought far too much life to the film. The “terrifying, all-consuming finale” may be all-consuming but it’s not that terrifying. A better blurb would say, “Imagine a film which captures the boring, daily routine of your own life and amplify it by ten thousand.”\n\nHowever, The Turin Horse isn’t all bad. Yes it has nothing going for it in terms of plot or characters (something I consider as the most important aspect of a film, especially one at 150 minutes long), but there’s no denying how outstandingly beautiful the film looks. It looked so promising when it opened and I was hoping that all my fears would be dashed! It opens with a five minute take of the Turin horse pulling a wagon with the father on, but thanks to the beautifully fluid camerawork it’s anything but boring! The way the camera floated around the fog reminded me a bit of Gaspar Noe’s visual spectacle, Enter the Void, a film I consider to be the absolute best on a visual level. On top of that there was a wonderful haunting score featuring very melancholic violins and an organ, a score that would drop in and out of the film regularly, and a score which I liked greatly.\n\nThe imagery and music are the only redeeming features. Sometimes the film looked like a moody painting, painted in ink. There’s no denying how atmospheric the whole thing looked, and the fact that all the scenes were done in one uninterrupted take is highly impressive. Even if there are no interesting actions being filmed, I did like the way the camera would move from one perfectly framed shot to another so effortlessly. I especially loved the haunting shot of the daughter sitting out looking out the window like a desperately lonely ghost. I also did like the dread-filled ending where the father carries on his boring life regardless of a total apocalyptic blackout.\n\nFor some people this is enough. For some, masterful direction, atmosphere, a beautifully melancholic score and gorgeous visuals and cinematography is enough to warrant labelling a film a masterpiece. However, for me I require more. You can have the most beautiful visuals in the world, but if you don’t give a fig about who’s in them or what’s going on in them, then they don’t really mean much. The Turin Horse is totally and utterly plot-less, pointless and outrageously laborious. It’s one of the most boring things I’ve seen, but it is also beautifully made. There’s no denying Bela Tarr’s talent as a director, and if he had a real plot then he would be extremely powerful, but this has no plot. So if your into watching drips eating potatoes through the lens of a masterful director, then you might just be in luck!\n\nDirector: Pascal Laugier\n\nStars: Mylene Jampanoi, Morjana Alaoui, Catherine Begin\n\nOne of the greatest films of all time. Profound, moving and utterly devastating\n\nMartyrs is another French film that is one of the most effective and incredible films I have ever seen. It’s a rare thing now to get a horror film that truly shocks you, but Martyrs is one of these rarities. A film that you can’t un-see, and possibly one you wouldn’t want to either. Now, it would be easy to dismiss Martyrs as ‘torture-porn’ like Hostel, but Martyrs is so much deeper than that. The explicit and hugely upsetting torture sequences serve a very fine purpose to the mind-boggling narrative, and carefully constructed characters. You could also dismiss Martyrs as being exploitative, using gore for gore’s sake. However, Martyrs uses some of the most cringe-inducing gore I’ve ever seen, which dares you not to look away. Never has violence looked more nasty or pointless. You could even say that it’s a comment on how films glamorise violence. Martyrs shows violence for what it really is.\n\nWhat makes Martyrs so extraordinary is its unpredictability and the way it plays on your expectations, in a similar way to The Cabin in the Woods, only not humorous in the slightest. The film changes direction at least four times, and two of these occasions are in the opening 10 minutes! The first time I saw Martyrs, I was in shock at the first plot twist, as it delivers the nasty surprise thick and fast like a Michael Haneke film. It defies all conventions, without ever feeling schizophrenic in tone. Even though Martyrs has so many plot twists, it never feels messy and it’s always focused on true narrative it’s trying to express. I’ve seen the film about six times now and it still manages to hit me hard with its visceral shocks.\n\nAnother great thing about Martyrs is its characters. The main protagonists feature on the front cover, both of them have a touching relationship as we see them through childhood. One of them, Lucie, is terribly haunted and a really tragic character who I felt immeasurably sympathetic towards. Her friend, is also almost like her carer who looks after Lucie, and also probably has feelings for her too. They’re both very deep characters who we can care for. Martyrs also features a memorable villain, who’s not in for long but offers a lasting and chilling presence, almost like Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. However, I don’t want to spoil too much, because that would be such a shame.\n\nThe turning point for people will be just over half-way when Martyrs takes a seriously surprising and gut-punching turn that no one could see coming. There’s a really heart-wrenching scene when Anna makes a discovery which should be strictly kept under wraps. This scene is one of the hardest scenes to watch in the film, and is outrageously disturbing. I always say that films become masterpieces when they turn into more of an experience, such as Black Swan, but Martyrs transcends from being an experience to being a challenge. It’s a real challenge to make it through the final half hour of Martyrs, as things only become more disturbing.\n\nThe final half hour will be the decider about whether you liked Martyrs or not. You can say what you like about the last half hour but whatever you say, it will be the thing that you remember the most about it. I shall not spoil it, but it’s one of the saddest moments, actually no, it is the saddest moment I’ve seen on film. Every time I see it I almost cry which is something I don’t do on many occasions. It packs such a huge emotional punch, and also has this chills-inducing music that escalates your feelings. Every time I see it I just want to collapse into a ball and weep an ocean of tears. But I’m yet to try that. It really is what takes Martyrs from being already one of the best horror films ever to being legendary. If you feel no emotion in this final third then you’re either a robot or a psychopath.\n\nI can understand why people hate these final moments, because I remember when I saw it a second time, I thought that it would be much better to have a Frontiers-type finale. However, then I realised that this is what Pascal Laugier would want us to have, and is probably what other film-makers would give us. It’s these final moments that are the biggest shock of the film and also are very relevant to the narrative as it allows us to go deeper into the characters. Suddenly the mystery is revealed and it’s a chilling one. Martyrs turns unbelievably deep and philosophical which will make you provoke more thought than you could imagine. The ending will make your jaw drop, as it’s a lot to take in. You could even say that the film takes another surprising turn. The final two shots are just the final nails in the coffin of your psyche. They’re the last visceral shocks, and the last shot is sure to haunt your dreams.\n\nSo it’s easy to call Martyrs ‘torture-porn’ but it seriously is anything but. Since when has ‘torture-porn’ made you think or feel as much emotion as Martyrs does. It’s hugely depressing, and leaves such an emotional impact. The directing alone makes Martyrs more than just an exploitation film! He’s created a moving masterpiece. It’s not easy to watch but the pay-off is immense. Martyrs is possibly the boldest and most powerful films I’ve ever seen. It’s truly unforgettable, and I could write a list of superlatives like I did with The Dark Knight, but not one of them would justify just how mesmerising this film is. It’s a true horror masterpiece. Martyrs is a difficult film to recommend, because it’s the opposite end of entertainment, but the pay-off is truly unlike any other. Witness it for yourself. It’s one of the best horror films ever made. Maybe even the best.\n\n>\n\n‘Marmite’ is one word to describe The Cabin in the Woods. You simply either love it or hate it. Many people hate it, however, because they don’t understand it. I think some filmophiles (who have never seen a slasher film in their life) see a critically acclaimed film and decide to watch it, without understanding all the strange in-jokes and postmodernism. The first step to understanding The Cabin in the Woods is to understand that the film has been made for horror fanatics. If you’re not a horror fan and if you’ve never seen a slasher film, then you won’t understand The Cabin in the Woods and will find yourself baffled at the peculiar carnage that graces your screen. Conversely, if you hate horror films then you may find yourself liking The Cabin in the Woods, as it is also a criticism of the genre. Basically you need to have seen a few slasher films before to understand the brilliance!\n\nI should probably warn you here that this post is going to contain quite a few humongous spoilers, as I’ll be talking explicitly about the ending, which is something you most definitely do not want spoiling! So for those of you, who haven’t seen it, toddle off now and watch it (preferably in blu-ray, but I won’t hold it against you if you don’t) and immediately come back here and read this wonderful piece of Pulitzer prize winning literature.\n\nThe rest of you are welcome to stay… I don’t blame you if you hate The Cabin in the Woods, because a lot of it went over my head when I first saw it. It wasn’t what I was expecting at all, and I wasn’t sure if I liked it or not. However, after I let it sink in for a few hours I came to the conclusion that it was a masterpiece and here’s why…\n\nIt’s unpredictable\n\nYou could never predict what was going to happen before the film started. If you could, you were either Drew Goddard or Joss Whedon or… God! This is an unusual thing for the horror genre, which often seems to follow the same blueprint and conventions. The slasher film, Reeker for example is a perfect illustration of a clichéd slasher, and one which The Cabin in the Woods perfectly criticises. The Cabin in the Woods plays with the clichés, right down to its uninspiring title. The film even begins on a familiar note with opening credits on a black background awash with images of sacrifices and such. Horror nerds should already be yawning at this point until the film jarringly cuts to a couple of amusing office workers having a banal conversation about door knobs or something. It’s almost as if the reel accidently changed, but no. It’s Whedon and Goddard perfectly playing with our expectations on the genre.\n\nThis unpredictability only increases as the film goes on which ends with the apocalypse, which I’m sure no one ever saw coming. Of course we’re introduced to a familiar slasher-movie setting and characters, but we also get strange inter-cuts of people in a control room who are manipulating every situation. These people represent the script writers, which leads on to my next point…\n\nThe characters are more symbolic than you realise\n\nSigourney Weaver beautifully sums up the slasher archetypes at the end: The whore, the athlete, the scholar, the fool and the virgin. However, did you notice that their characters changed as the film went on? Before the friends go to the cabin you’ll notice the virgin talking about how she had sex with a teacher, the fool talking about conspiracy theories that are actually true to the film, the athlete talking about sociology books, the scholar without his glasses and the whore mentioning dyeing her hair blonde. However, the people in the control room use mood enhancing drugs on the group in order to transform them into stereotypical slasher drones. The whore snogs a wolf, the athlete acts like a prat and the scholar starts wearing glasses. The only two who seem to be unaffected by the chemicals are the virgin and fool. Subsequently they’re the last to go.\n\nAs this diagram perfectly illustrates, the people in the control room are the writers, trying to create a generic slasher film, because it’s the formula that works the best. It’s almost like a ritual, eh? Sigourney is of course the director, the Gods watching are us, the audience. We demand the blood of these characters because it’s in our nature to.\n\nQuirks\n\nThere are also little quirks throughout the film that give a nod to how clichéd horror films can be. One of my favourites is perhaps the subtlest. When Dana stabs a zombified Buckner with a knife, the control room people press a button which lets off a small electric shock, causing Dana to drop the knife. This is of course a fantastic way of illustrating how characters in horror films always annoyingly drop a weapon after killing a villain, which of course they’ll be needing later!\n\nIt breaks convention\n\nThe Cabin in the Woods becomes seriously unconventional once the fool comes back to save Dana. Dana is being brutally bashed by a vicious zombie which resembles the finale of a typical horror film, whilst the control room people all have a party because they’ve completed their task of creating a conventional slasher flick. Matyr, however turns out to be alive which breaks the formula and angers the Gods. What follows is one of the craziest scenes of creative carnage I’ve ever seen, as all the hideous creatures break loose.\n\nWhen ‘the fool’ doesn’t die at the end, the audience isn’t happy which is symbolised by a large hand breaking through the cabin. The Director even mentions at the end that ‘The Fool’ has 5 minutes to die before sunrise (or before the theatre lights come on) otherwise the God’s will wreak havoc and destroy the world. However, ‘The Fool’ decides to live and even says that “It’s time to give someone else a chance” possibly referring to the fact that it’s time horror films became more original. The world ending symbolises the audience verbally bashing the film because it doesn’t follow the horror conventions they’re used to.\n\nPerhaps this is why some people hate The Cabin in the Woods. It’s simply too different for them. I think The Cabin in the Woods is simply one of the greatest slasher films ever! Why? Because it’s basically every slasher film ever made and much more. I’d encourage everyone to give it another chance and read more into it. Embrace it and you’ll love it!"
