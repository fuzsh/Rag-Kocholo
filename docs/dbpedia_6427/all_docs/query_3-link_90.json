About this list: Making a list like this is practically impossible, but if I concider it to be a temporary time-capsule of how I feel right now rather than something set in stone, it feels more easy. Sweden can surely get a lot of criticism for many things when it comes to our movie-industry, but something that I'm never going to understand is the discussion about Sweden not having any good movies - because there's plenty, and this list just contains a small amount of them.",
