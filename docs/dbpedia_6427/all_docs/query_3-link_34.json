        "text": "2019\n\nCity Locations\n\nBudapest, Budakeszi, Etyek, (Hungary), New York, Utah (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nHouse, Film Studio, Unique\n\nLocation Styles\n\nCabin, Craftsman, Dated, Rustic\n\nAbout Midsommar\n\nIn 2019, Ari Aster directed Midsommar, a folk horror movie, featuring Florence Pugh, Jack Reynor, Will Poulter, and William Jackson Harper. The story revolves around a couple who are on the verge of separation and they accompany their friend and his acquaintances to a remote Swedish village where a rare festival occurs. While participating in the festivities, the group unearths disturbing information about the seemingly perfect community.\n\nAster created the film's story while listening to The Haxan Cloak's 2013 album Excavation. Later, Aster asked The Haxan Cloak, whose real name is Bobby Krlic, to compose the film's score. Krlic got inspiration from Nordic folk music, worked with Aster closely, and started composing before filming began. The film incorporates diegetic music to blend events on screen with the score.\n\nThe plot of Midsommar follows Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor), who have been struggling in their relationship. After experiencing personal tragedy, Dani joins Christian and his friends Mark (Will Poulter) and Josh (William Jackson Harper) on a trip to a Swedish village that holds the rare occasion, celebrating a once-in-a-blue-moon festival.\n\nAt the celebration, it becomes apparent that the seemingly peaceful community harbors some frightening secrets. As Dani explores further, she discovers horrors she could never have imagined while finding strength within herself.\n\nSince its release in 2019, Midsommar has received numerous awards and nominations, including Best Horror Film at the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films. The movie also won a Santa Barbara International Film Festival, under the Virtuoso Award category (Florence Pugh).\n\nMidsommar Locations\n\nMidsommar went into production on July 30, 2018, and filming wrapped in October of that year. The movie was shot in various locations, taking advantage of the stunning landscapes worldwide.\n\nMost of the scenes were filmed in and around Budapest, Hungary, which provided a picturesque and almost ethereal backdrop for the movie. Some of the earlier scenes of Midsommar were shot in Utah and New York City. The filming locations in Hungary showcased Midsommar as a both strikingly beautiful and eerie place, creating the perfect setting to heighten the horror experienced throughout the film.\n\nA trip to Hungary isnât as sinister as what is depicted in the film, instead, it allows visitors to take in its majestic natural beauty while exploring some of the lesser-known locales featured in Midsommar. From rolling hills and lush forests to valleys filled with castles and ruins, there's something for everyone to experience during their visit.\n\nSet designers built the farmhouse-like structures where Dani, Christian, and the group stayed in an empty field. To make the set in Hungary look authentically Swedish, director Aster collaborated with Stockholm-based production designer Henrik Svensson.\n\nTo gather information for the movie's setting, the production team went to HÃ¤lsingland, the actual location of the fictional commune depicted in the film. The appearance of the farms in the area greatly influenced the movie's appearance and layout. Hungary's advantages as a primary filming location, conducive to creating a stunning and frighteningly surreal atmosphere, are why director Ari Aster chose to film there.\n\nFor fans of Midsommar or anyone looking for a unique travel destination, a trip to Hungary would be worth considering; visitors can experience some breathtaking sights while also getting a taste of what it was like making one of 2019's most beloved films.\n\nIn the opening scene, we see Dani (Florence Pugh) in her apartment, overwhelmed with grief upon learning about her parent's death. It's a poignant and intense moment highlighting the depth of her emotions and strong bonds with her loved ones. The scene portrays Dani in shock and deep sorrow as she reaches out to Christian (Jack Reynor) for comfort.\n\nLater, we witness the authorities entering the house of Dani's parents, where Terri (Klaudia CsÃ¡nyi) had initiated a carbon monoxide flood, leading to the death of her parents. Terri herself also put the tube in her mouth and held it there with tape. Meanwhile, Christian visits Dani's apartment to offer her comfort.\n\nThe cramped apartment in Dani's home during the sequence was filmed in a rented apartment in Brooklyn, capturing the mood perfectly with some moving shots. Fortunately, the production team didn't have to construct a new set, allowing them to film the scenes within a few days and stay overnight.\n\nCompared to other filming locations in the production, this location was chosen because of its convenience. Brooklyn is a densely populated borough of New York City and you can appreciate the exquisite waterfront views by visiting Brooklyn Bridge Park. Just keep in mind that the building situated in the park is privately owned.\n\nThe heart-wrenching scene was filmed at 66 Ainslie St. in Brooklyn. To reach this location, take the L train to Bedford Avenue station and walk for five minutes down Ainslie Street until you arrive at the address. Alternatively, buses M55 or M15 and the L train can get you to the exact location.\n\nThe village scenes, set in the fictional commune of HÃ¥rga, are filmed in Budakeszi, Hungary. Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) invites Dani (Florence Pugh), Christian (Jack Reynor), and his friends Mark (Will Poulter) and Josh (William Jackson Harper) to attend a unique midsummer festival. Upon arrival, they are introduced to the Harga community. They start earning about the surrounding culture, and we also see the scene of the final ceremony.\n\nThe ceremony begins with Pelle and Ingemar (Hampus Hallberg) luring four outsiders as the first victims. At the same time, Dani, the May Queen, must choose either Christian or a commune member as the final sacrifice. The whole sequence is shot with carefully composed symmetrical camera shots and a mix of colors that build up an atmosphere of dread.\n\nBudakeszi is a remote forested village that gives viewers an uncanny vibe and serves as the perfect backdrop to depict the solemnity of its subject matter. Although there is a town called HÃ¥rga in central Sweden, the village shown in the film is fictional.\n\nHÃ¤lsingland is a region with a rich history, featuring museums that display violent depictions of ancient rituals from centuries ago. The film creatively incorporates these paintings into the story, leading to its shocking conclusion.\n\nThis location is just outside of Budapest and can easily be reached by public transport from MikÃ³ utca to SzÃ©ll KÃ¡lmÃ¡n tÃ©r M and then by bus 222 to Budakeszi temetÅ. After a 7-minute walk, you will be at the site where the Harga village scenes were shot. The area surrounding Budakeszi features lush green hills, old churches, and small villages that have remained unchanged for centuries, making it an ideal filming location for rural community scenes.\n\nThe village is decorated with various symbols, such as a mistletoe tree, ivy, and large poles topped with different-colored streamers. On the edge of the clearing stands an altar covered in flowers and other offerings.\n\nMaja (Isabelle Grill) stands at the center of this altar, wearing a wreath of wildflowers around her head. Older women surround her, all standing silently around her and gazing upon Christian (Jack Reynor) with admiration. Christian is handed a drink from one of the elderly women that induce a hallucinogenic trip, and he starts to feel woozy.\n\nMaja then invites him to the altar, where they share an intimate ritual while the other women stand eerily still around them, mimicking Maja's moaning. After Dani (Florence Pugh) is crowned May Queen, she peeks through the door opening to witness Christian and Maja's kiss, resulting in a breakdown for Dani.\n\nThe scene was shot at Korda Studios in Etyek, Hungary. This versatile studio provides filming, post-production services, and other facilities that made it perfect for creating the authentic Swedish setting for the ritual scene in Midsommar. Korda Studios, also known as Etyekwood, is a complex situated on the site of a former barracks in the village of Etyek. It was founded in 2007.\n\nKorda Studios is 30 kilometers away from Budapest. You can take a bus or taxi from Budapest, or rent a car if you're adventurous. Once you arrive, you can explore the studio's grounds and see their impressive work, including Midsommar.\n\nThe film is visually impressive and has a long runtime, but the screenplay keeps the audience engaged. As horror-movie fans, we are easily frightened, and even minor effects like a creaking door or an unexpected edit can make us scream and grab onto our seat arms or each other. In 2018, Ari Aster, the director of Hereditary whose feature debut gained quite some popularity, proved that he had a good grasp of the genre's basics. Midsommar, a story that warns about bad relationships and dreadful vacations, instills a sense of creepiness from the beginning.\n\nThe performances from the cast are impressive, with Florence Pugh having a solid show as Dani Ardor, who is grieving her recent family tragedy. All the actors deliver powerful performances that bring emotional depth to their characters. The script is well written, creating tension and terror while exploring some themes of grief and loss.\n\nThe idea of Midsommar being set within a small Swedish cult aroused interest, providing an exciting setting for horrific events to unfold. The movie has undoubtedly contributed to the film industry by pushing boundaries regarding what can be done in horror films. Using creative visuals and sound design, it builds suspense through beautiful yet creepy imagery, increasing tension before the climax.\n\nThose looking for an experience like no other should watch Midsommar at least once! It offers something unique compared to other films in this genre, with its mix of horror, comedy, and drama. While it may not be for everyone due to its slow pace and dark themes, Midsommar has something for all movie lovers if you want to try it!"
