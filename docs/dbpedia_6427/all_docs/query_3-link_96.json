        "text": "NewFilmmakers Los Angeles (NFMLA)’s August line-up celebrates emerging filmmakers both near and far, featuring InFocus: International Animation, a program of exciting animated work from all around the world, a selection of California-made short films, including work from the Youth Cinema Project, and a collection of work made in the city of Los Angeles.\n\nThe day begins with shorts program Made In California, a selection of films shot throughout the versatile state of California, from the wilderness to the city to the suburbs to the desert. The Californian stories gathered here are full of laughs, pain, perseverance and reverence. The block opens with a sampling of films made through the Youth Cinema Project (YCP). YCP works in the classrooms of public schools, integrating filmmaking with 21st century learning skills. YCP uses a hands-on approach that integrates social emotional learning and English Language Arts to provide an equitable and accessible learning experience for students. Across one full academic year, two filmmaking professionals implement a rigorous standards-based filmmaking curriculum within 4th -12th grade classrooms. The students complete short films from concept to screen in a 100% student-led environment.\n\nThe afternoon’s programming continues with Made in Los Angeles, a closer look at the city of Los Angeles through a selection of short form storytelling that encapsulates everything from sheer joy to murder. It includes stories about finding one’s own voice, fighting for loved ones, and discovering new and mysterious places, all shot right here in LA.\n\nThe night concludes with InFocus: International Animation, a slate of animated films and stories from Croatia, France, Germany, Iran, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Sweden, capturing a variety of animation styles and genres and including dynamic and soulful films whose festival runs have included Sundance, Slamdance, SXSW, Clermont Ferrand, Palm Springs Shortfest and the Venice Biennale.\n\nNFMLA showcases films by filmmakers of all backgrounds throughout the year, across both our general and InFocus programming. All filmmakers are welcome and encouraged to submit their projects for consideration for upcoming NFMLA Festivals, regardless of the schedule for InFocus programming, which celebrates diversity, inclusion and region by spotlighting communities of filmmakers within our filmmaking community as part of our monthly program. This project is supported in part by the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nThe South Park Center is an ADA compliant venue and is wheelchair accessible. We request captioned films from all filmmakers participating at our Festival. For any accessibility needs, please send a request to info@nfmla.org at least 72 hours prior to the event."
