        "text": "Paul Byrnes on a harrowing but beautiful tale of an abandoned teenager sold into slavery.\n\nLilya 4-Ever\n\nWritten and Directed by Lukas Moodysson\n\nRated MA\n\nChauvel, Paddington\n\n'And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said unto them, suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not: for such is the kingdom of God.\" - Mark, 10:13-14.\n\nThe children suffer in Lukas Moodysson's three films so far, usually at the hands of adults. In Fucking Amal and Together, the films that established his international reputation, the adults didn't intend harm to their kids; they were just too self-obsessed to see what was happening.\n\nTogether, set in a commune in Sweden in 1975, was savagely funny about the way a spirit of radicalism was lost, while a generation of children had to fend for themselves. At least that's what I thought at the time, although Moodysson says now that he wanted to celebrate the people who investigated alternative lifestyles, as well as criticise them.\n\nHis sympathy for their ideas was apparent to Swedish audiences after Fucking Amal, the story of two teenage girls falling in love, was honoured at the Swedish film awards. Moodysson made a long speech that caused an uproar. He told Swedes not to eat meat, not to drive so fast, to be nice to their children. He even talked about taxes. When the audience began to boo he made \"bad gestures\" at his detractors.\n\n\"I think the TV audience at home thought I was making gestures at them,\" he said in an on-stage interview at the London Film Festival last November. \"This developed into a big misunderstanding ...\n\nI think I did the right thing, even if I did not talk about the most important things. I think you have to talk about important things, not just thank your mother.\"\n\nIndeed, not thanking your mother is something Moodysson does a lot in his films. His mothers are imperfect creatures. So are the fathers, but they're often absent, so the mothers cop his wrath, as primary lack-of-care givers.\n\nThis \"bad madonna\" theme reaches a new level in Lilya 4-Ever, which is perhaps his best film yet, if his bleakest.\n\nMoodysson says he set out to make a film about God's kindness. It was going to be a story about Jesus walking at the side of a young girl, but he found himself unable to write the part of Jesus.\n\nInstead it became a story of a 15-year-old girl from the former Soviet Union who ends up sold into sexual slavery in Sweden.\n\nIt's like a Ken Loach film, with all the sadness that implies, but also a touch of mysticism. One of the characters appears in the young girl's dreams as an angel, complete with wings. This doesn't seem that strange in the context; she desperately needs an angel.\n\nLilya (Oksana Akinshina) lives in a rundown housing block somewhere in the former USSR. She is pretty and cheeky but still not much more than a child. She can still laugh and have fun, amid the squalor.\n\nOne of the first things we notice is that she cherishes an old picture of an angel guarding a curly-headed child, one of those romantic 19th-century depictions. She packs it carefully for her coming escape. Her mother (Lyubov Agapova) is taking her to America, thanks to the mother's tough-looking boyfriend. Instead they leave her behind, in a scene that breaks your heart.\n\nHer mother promises to send for her but Lilya doesn't believe her. She is distraught, alone in the apartment, but this is just the beginning. Her Aunt Anna (Liliya Shinkaryova), a big, ugly cliche of the sullen Slav, moves her to a filthy hole in an even worse building and takes the better apartment for herself. \"Do what your mother did,\" says the old hag. \"Go into town and spread your legs.\"\n\nLilya resorts to glue-sniffing with her friends, Natasha (Elina Benensen) and Volodya (Artiom Bogucharski). Natasha soon betrays her, too. Volodya, two years younger and virtually homeless, begins to sleep at her place.\n\nThey become like brother and sister. He tries to protect her from men; she buys him the only gift he has ever had, a basketball. When she meets a nice guy who promises to get her a job in Sweden, Volodya sees his own abandonment coming.\n\nThis is hard to watch, but what else should it be? It's not as if it's not happening in lots of places, including here. Moodysson was partly inspired by the story of a young Estonian girl who jumped from a bridge in his hometown of Malmo. I kept thinking of the young Thai prostitute and heroin addict who died at Villawood in September 2001 after vomiting for two days. Her name was Puangthong Simaplee.\n\nThe film's most confronting scenes are in Sweden, where Lilya is beaten, repeatedly raped and kept under lock and key. Moodysson rarely shows this happening to her; instead, he makes you feel like it's happening to you, by putting the camera in her position. After the tenth face of some nameless man looms over you, pounding away with no visible emotion, the sense of what her life has become is hard to bear."
