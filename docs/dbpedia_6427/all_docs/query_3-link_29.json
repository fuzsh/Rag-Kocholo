        "text": "Ender Wiggin, Bilbo Baggins, Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter – they're all genre heroes. They're also all dudes. And under a new rating being introduced in some Swedish cinemas, their films would all be failures.\n\nThe new rating system, which was created by a handful of theaters in Sweden, states that in order for a film to get an \"A\" rating, it must pass what's known as the \"Bechdel Test.\" It's a metric created by comics artist Alison Bechdel in the 1980s and is often used to evaluate the representation of women in media. The test stipulates a movie only passes if it has two women in it – with actual names – who talk about something other than a man. On the surface, it doesn't seem like too high of a bar, but in actuality, very few mainstream sci-fi and superhero flicks would clear it.\n\n\"The entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, all the Star Wars movies, The Social Network, Pulp Fiction and all but one of the Harry Potter movies fail this test,\" Ellen Tejle, the director of Stockholm movie house Bio Rio told the Associated Press.\n\nPointing out the gender bias in modern cinema, Tejle told the AP, has \"been an eye opener\" for patrons of Bio Rio, which is one of four Swedish theaters that launched the rating last month. Using the test isn't meant to say anything about the quality of a film, but rather to point out a blind spot about how movies typically don't represent women in the same ways that they do men. (Seriously, nearly every film has more than two named men it who talk about something besides women.)\n\nThe release of the new cinematic litmus test in Sweden comes as more than a few movies on either side of this spectrum are hitting theaters. Ender's Game, for example, has three named female characters – Petra (Hailee Steinfeld), Valentine (Abigail Breslin), and Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis, whose character was gender-swapped from her book's counterpart) – but they never interact with one another.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which hoists up Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) as its sole heroine and is poised to further crack the cinematic glass ceiling its predecessor did when it proved last year that a movie with a female protagonist could break box office records.\n\nThen somewhere in the middle is Thor: The Dark World, which like its previous incarnation -- and this year's Iron Man 3 -- does pass the test because Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) do discuss physics a bit but is still largely a sausage fest. (It also leaves a huge question mark in the air as to whether Monster director Patty Jenkins, who was originally attached to direct the film and would've been the first woman to helm a superhero tentpole, would've made a more female-focused movie.)\n\nAnecdotal evidence aside, raw numbers also point to the dearth of women on the big screen. A study by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film found that only 33 percent of characters in the top 100 highest-grossing films of 2011 were women and only 11 percent were protagonists. A report from USC's Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism found similar results for movies released from 2007 to 2009 and noted fewer than 17 percent of the movies were \"'gender balanced' or feature girls or women in 45 to 54.9 percent of all speaking roles.\"\n\nHowever, the Bechdel Test does have its blind spots. Take, for example, director Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity, which features a tough female astronaut in Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) who doesn't talk to another woman in the film, but also doesn't talk to pretty much anyone but herself for the final two thirds of the film. Although it's an unusual case, Gravity likely wouldn't get an \"A\" under the new Swedish system, and that doesn't mean it doesn't represent women well.\n\nIt's actually more likely that a film like Gravity would get a good grade on what's called the Mako Mori Test -- a measure meant to accompany Bechdel named after Rinko Kikuchi's character in Pacific Rim, which asks that a movie have \"a) at least one female character; b) who gets her own narrative arc; c) that is not about supporting a man’s story.\"\n\nSame goes for movies like, say, The Avengers, which has pretty strong female characters in Black Widow and Maria Hill, but still doesn't meet the requirements. Admittedly, whenever an art form gets reduced to relatively simple metric, there's little accounting for nuance and context, and it's worth noting some sci-fi and genre films have been ahead of the curve in regards to strong females like Alien's Ripley. (A punch-line in Bechdel's Dykes to Watch Out For comic that launched the test is that the woman who follows it notes that the \"last movie I was able to see was Alien\").\n\nStill, Sweden's new angle on film is an interesting start. Even if the new system is only happening in a few theaters, the level of awareness it could draw to how many films fall short in their gender balance could be incredible. The Bechdel Test, for anyone concerned about the representations of women in the media, has long been one of those things that's very hard to \"unsee\" – once you know about it, you'll see it -- or rather, the lack of media that passes it -- everywhere. It can also be depressing. But if there are more people looking out for it, maybe one day it will be harder to spot."
