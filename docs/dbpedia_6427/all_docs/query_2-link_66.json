        "text": "Together 99 tells the story of a group of very different individuals who in 1975 lived in a commune called “Together”. Now it is 1999, 24 years later, and the collective has turned into the world's smallest. The commune consists of only two people - Göran and Klasse. Feeling a bit lonely, the idea occurs of a reunion with their old friends…\n\nWhen the shooting now starts, many of the actors from the previous film are reunited. Gustaf Hammarsten (Thunder in My Heart, Brüno, Together) returns as Göran and Shanti Roney (Applause, Nymphomaniac: Vol 2, Vägen ut) plays his friend Klasse. The cast also includes Anja Lundqvist, Jessica Liedberg, Olle Sarri, Lisa Lindgren, Jonas Karlsson, Sten Ljunggren, Henrik Lundström, Cecilia Frode, Lars Frode, Clara Christansson Drake, David Dencik and Julia Heveus.\n\nThe film is written and directed by award-winning director Lukas Moodysson, who has made iconic films as Show Me Love (1998), Together (2000), Lilya 4-ever (2002), the international film Mammoth (2009) and We Are the Best! (2013). Recently Moodysson has directed the series Gösta (2019) for HBO.\n\nThe film is produced by Memfis Film, with producers Lars Jönsson (Show Me Love, Lilya 4-ever, Together, Gösta) and Anna Carlsten (Day by Day, The Dark Heart, Anxious People), that has produced many successful and award-winning films. The previous film Together was praised by audiences and critics both in Sweden and internationally and has sold approximately 2,500,000 cinema tickets worldwide.\n\nTogether 99 is a co-production between Memfis Film, SF Studios, Film i Väst and Zentropa Entertainments, with support from the Swedish Film Institute and Nordisk Film & TV Fond.\n\nSF Studios also distributes the film in the Nordics and REinvent handles international sales.\n\nThe film is expected to premiere in Swedish cinemas in September 2023, followed by an international release.\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nYaba Holst, Head of Nordic Acquistion, SF Studios, yaba.holst@sfstudios.se, +46 73 411 95 35\n\nMalin Strihagen, Vice President Brand & Communications, SF Studios, malin.strihagen@sfstudios.se, +46 70 780 39 35\n\nHelene Aurø, Sales & Marketing Director, Reinvent International Sales, helene.auro@reinvent.dk, +45 23 42 00 07\n\nAbout SF Studios\n\nSF Studios, established in 1919, is one of the world’s oldest film companies.
