        "text": "Mariah Larsson\n\nRepresenting Sexual Transactions: A National Perspective on A Changing Region in Three Swedish Films\n\nAdvertisement\n\naround the turn of the millennium, three Swedish films were released, all dealing with sexual transactions between Swedish men and women from the former Soviet Union. Produced some ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and Soviet Communism, Torsk på Tallinn (Tomas Alfredson, 1999), Buy Bye Beauty (Pål Hollender, 2001) and Lilja 4-ever (Lilya 4-ever, Lukas Moodysson, 2002) all seemed to relate to certain post-Cold War anxieties, pitting the welfare state of Sweden against what is perceived as the misery of the post-Soviet region.\n\nThe point of the present paper is to examine these three films and discuss how sexuality becomes the focal point for a national anxiety regarding a changing region and a changing world. I will do so by reading them as a discourse on sexual transactions across national borders, a discourse marked by a national postcolonial anxiety. The argument made here is based on three factors: first, the relation between Sweden and the former Soviet Union, especially the Baltic states, as a postcolonial relation; second, the fact that the releases of the films are framed by two changes in Swedish law regarding sexual transactions; and third, the national gendering of these sexual transactions.\n\nAlthough the three films in different ways tell stories about, or in one case lets the audience glimpse images of, other countries, I will argue that their main point is to say something about Sweden. The Other, in these films, is used as a mirror for self-reflection. Moreover, two of them explic-\n\n21\n\nitly take place in the Baltic states – Estonia and Latvia, respectively – and the third, albeit located “somewhere in the former Soviet Union”, is largely shot in Estonia. Nevertheless, they are, as well, financed and produced by Swedish or Nordic companies and funding agencies. By looking at the production context for Lilya 4-ever, which lacks Russian production interests, film scholar and Slavonist Lars Kristensen has claimed that, in spite of its language, the intention of the film “is to portray cultural concerns that largely address the Nordic context” (Kristensen, 2007: 4). This, I would claim, is true of the other two films as well. In that sense, the discourse of the films can be regarded as a postcolonial discourse from a Western point-of-view. Postcolonial scholar David Chioni Moore argues that the entire former Eastern European and former Soviet area except Russia – “the giant crescent from Estonia to Kazakhstan” – is postcolonial, “subject to often brutal Russian domination (styled as Soviet from the 1920s on) for anywhere from forty to two hundred years” (Moore, 2006: 17). Quite apparently, the history of the Baltic states is fraught with colonial and national issues. Furthermore, although Moore points out Russia as the great colonizer in the post-Soviet area, regarding the Baltic states, the Swedes are no innocents either.\n\nAdditionally, the films were framed by two changes in Swedish law that had to do with sexuality: In 1999, a new law against the buying of sexual services, “sexköpslagen” (the “sex-buying law” or the “sex purchase law”), came into effect, and in 2002, another new law was passed against human trafficking for sexual purposes.\n\nThis essay separates the phenomenon of prostitution from the discourse of prostitution, or more specifically in this case, the discourse of sexual transactions across national borders. Thus, the issue is not real sex workers or real trafficked persons, their experiences, and how they relate to the films or to the laws. Neither will I examine whether or not these films tell actual “true” stories – they all relate to reality in different and interesting ways. One is a pseudo documentary, one a documentary, and the third is based on a true story. Yet the objective of the essay is not to compare the accounts of the films with actual facts and figures regarding wife-import, sex-tourism, and human trafficking for sexual purposes. Rather, the aim is to demonstrate how the sexual relations are staged and portrayed in these films as a way to respond to a national anxiety interspersed with a vague sense of guilt on behalf of Sweden. The laws on sexual transactions are not used to determine whether they have been successful or whether they were the correct response to an actual situation, but rather to indicate the presence and urgency of these issues in the public discourse at the time.\n\n22 — mariah larsson\n\nAlthough written from very different perspectives, two essays about Lilya 4-ever, one by film scholar Olof Hedling and the other by literary scholar Sven Hansell, both still point to certain factors that, in the film, seem to explain the destiny of Lilya: the expanding international role of the US, bad or non-existing social welfare institutions that can counter the forces of capitalism, gaps in economic income, and a lenient attitude towards the sex trade and globalization (Hedling, 2004: 331, Hansell, 2004: 101). As I have argued elsewhere, Hedling’s essay regards the film’s analysis of social and economic structures as being in line with a hegemonic Swedish Social Democracy, whereas Hansell’s piece interprets the same logic of the film as subversive from a gender perspective (Larsson, 2006: 247). Nevertheless, the fact that two different scholars, independent of each other and from different positions, extrapolate the same logic from one film underscores the quite univocal and unambiguous character of Lilya 4-ever: There is not much room for other interpretations. For the purposes of this article, I would like to use the conclusions of the two essays by Hedling and Hansell as a starting point. This is in order to claim that there was at the time a domestic anxiety concerning the development of what was sometimes called “galloping capitalism” within the former Soviet Union and the dissolving national boundaries that were a consequence of Sweden’s entry into the European Union in 1995.\n\nThis claim is further reinforced by some conclusions drawn by sociologist Annelie Siring in a report on prostitution. Having worked with how the sex-buying law is understood, discussed, and implemented by police and social workers, Siring infers that the law is often regarded as a means to thwart human trafficking for sexual purposes and as a way to start unravelling other types of crimes (Siring, 2008: 327–356). In the reports that preceded the law, it was predicted, on the basis of developments in other countries, that Sweden’s entry into the European Union, as well as the fall of Communism and the Soviet states, might lead to an increase in prostitution as well as the trafficking of (in this scenario) women for sexual services (Siring, 2008: 335). Accordingly, in this respect, the law can be regarded as an attempt to regulate what social anthropologist Laura María Agustín has labelled “informal migrancy” and especially sex trade migration across the national border, to impose domestic control in a world perceived as increasingly global (Agustín, 2007: 10–53). Working from the perspective of the migrants themselves, Agustín points out that it is extremely difficult for migrants without the necessary background (i.e., citizenship in a relatively wealthy nation) to enter into the US or the EU. Additionally, British social scientist Arthur\n\nrepresenting sexual transactions — 23\n\nGould claims, on the basis of official reports, newspaper articles, and interviews with women from Swedish political parties, that two main objectives of the Swedish sex-buying law were gender equality and the threat of migrant prostitution (Gould, 2002).\n\nFinally, the ambivalence of the feelings of anxiety and guilt in these films is inscribed not only onto sexual relations, but also and more specifically, onto the body of the woman. More or less apparently, the (young) female body forms the locus for the Swedish sense of responsibility as well as the sense of how the “weaker (sex)” falls victim to large historical and global economic movements. The sites of exploitation in these films are, firstly, the places where the sex is negotiated and carried out, and secondly, the female body on which – it is understood – the sexual activity is performed. Here, one can add that the cinema or living room in which these events are screened can be regarded as a third site of exploitation, where the filmmakers may or may not be exploiting the sensationalism of their subjects. Nevertheless, the post-Soviet body is gendered female and as such, exploitable by male, capitalist, and global forces.\n\nThree Films about Sexual Transactions across Borders\n\nAt first glance, the three films I have chosen to focus on appear to be very different. Torsk på Tallinn is a pseudo documentary made by the popular comedy group “Killinggänget”. It was shown on Swedish public service television (SVT) in 1999, and was one of “Fyra små filmer”/”Four small films”, a series of one-hour films produced by the group. Like the other films, it was characterized by a dark, ironic, and challenging humour, as well as a clever story construction, and the fact that the same actors played more than one character. In a style influenced by mockumentary characteristics, Torsk på Tallinn tells the story of a number of men who embark on an arranged bus trip to Estonia, with the explicit purpose of matchmaking with Estonian women. The film introduces the men, shows some of their everyday lives and has them talk into the camera, telling the audience about their hopes for the trip. Most are looking for some companionship; one, however, is very explicit about his single aim to “dip it”. Then, it follows them to the “picturesque suburb” of Paldiski, outside of Tallinn.\n\nThrough speed dating, the men are expected to each hook up with a woman, after which there is a loud and drunken party. The next day they leave to return to Sweden. Only one of the men has succeeded in picking up a potential fiancée who follows him to Sweden, although the “dipper”,\n\n24 — mariah larsson\n\nMicke, has quite unexpectedly fallen in love with Svetlana, the wife of Lembit, the Estonian partner of the bus trip manager, and stays in Estonia with her. The film has a subtitle stating that it is “en liten film om ensamhet”/“a short film about loneliness”. This references Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski’s “Dekalog” (1988–1990), in which some films were titled “Krótki film o…”/”A short film about…”. The other three films in Killinggänget’s series of four also begin their subtitles with the same phrase. Moreover, the word loneliness quite adequately describes the theme of this film. As one of the users on Internet Movie Database plainly advices: “Never, ever see this movie alone, single, dumped or depressed” (Internet Movie Database: Torsk på Tallinn). The film straddles a fine line between comedy and tragedy and is really more about Swedish loneliness, or rather lonely Swedish men, than about Estonian women or the practice of wife-import.\n\nIn 2001, Buy Bye Beauty was shown at the Gothenburg Film Festival. It is perhaps the weirdest of the three films discussed here. This documentary by reality TV celebrity and artist Pål Hollender describes the situation in Latvia, where Hollender boldly states that Latvians are doubly exploited by the Swedish industry – as cheap labourers and as prostitutes. The wages paid to those working for Swedish (and other Western) companies are so low that Latvian women have no choice but to sell sexual services, which in turn is taken advantage of by Swedish (and other Western) business men on location. The statements made in the documentary are scathing enough, actually causing diplomatic trouble between Latvia and Sweden (Raubiško, 2001). However, Hollender takes his own agenda one step further: He pays some of the women participating in the film to have sex with him, on camera. The scenes were allegedly filmed by Hollender’s wife (Ölmqvist, 2001). Thus, the documentary ends with the self-righteous and indignant documentarist committing the same crime that he has accused Swedish business men of committing, which of course is his (albeit blatant) point. Buy Bye Beauty caused an inflamed controversy in Sweden and was consequently shown on TV3, at the time the most low-brow of Swedish television channels and not part of public service SVT.\n\nFinally, the most well-known of the three films discussed here, Lilya 4-ever by maverick auteur Lukas Moodysson, is “based on a true story” and presents the narrative of a 16-year-old girl, Lilya, somewhere in the former Soviet Union, who is abandoned by her mother. Desperately trying to cope on her own, she sells sexual services at a night club and is later lured by what to her seems like a nice young man to go to Sweden and\n\nrepresenting sexual transactions — 25\n\nwork picking vegetables. Not surprisingly, he is just a front for a trafficking organization, and as soon as Lilya arrives in Sweden her fake passport is taken away from her, she is locked into an apartment, raped, and forced into prostitution. The film ends with her suicide.\n\nAlthough different in quality, in ideology, in mode of production and in genre, all three films have some stylistic similarities (for instance, hand-held camera and a documentarist “look”) and, in one way or the other, deal with sexual transactions between Swedish men and women of the former Soviet Union. In Torsk på Tallinn, it is the matchmaking of Swedish men and Estonian women that may or may not lead to wife-import. The subject of the film is lonely men, and they are through and through depicted as lonely, socially handicapped, quite pitiful, and not exactly classical boyfriend material. The galloping capitalism in the film is not necessarily pinned on Estonia and Estonians, but rather on Percy Nilegård, a cynical small-time entrepreneur who is a recurrent character in Killinggänget’s comedy acts, and who in this film is the manager of the bus trip. The country to which they travel could actually be any country with a lower GDP than Sweden. However, there is a subtext in which the audience can glimpse the “other side” of the story, glimpses that are filled in by our expectations or stereotypes of the situation and motivations for these women, by the site of the match-making arrangement, and the travel agent’s Estonian companion.\n\nIn Buy Bye Beauty, the focus is on sexual tourism, Swedes who go abroad to enjoy the freedom of travel and the luxury of being rich in a country where the Swedish currency has more purchasing power than at home. This issue has recently, due to the passing of a law in Norway that makes it possible to prosecute Norwegians who have bought sex abroad, been discussed in Sweden, with some voices suggesting that such a law could be valuable in Sweden, too (Olsson, 2008). In the TV debate following the screening of the film on Swedish television, Hollender was accused of breaking Swedish law by paying for sex. Hollender defended himself by stating that making pornographic films is not illegal in Sweden and that he had paid the women to have sex with him on camera.\n\nLilya 4-ever deals with the inflammatory topic of the sex slave trade – which in Sweden was long commonly known as trafficking, although trafficking according to the UN is a much wider concept (United Nations: What is human trafficking?). Although the sex-buying law was introduced with the argument that it would enhance gender equality and curb violence against women (cf. Månsson, 2001, Svanström, 2006), one of the effects of the law has been that it functions as a means to thwart traf-\n\n26 — mariah larsson\n\nficking. As Siring concludes in her report, many police regard the law as an instrument to keep trafficking at bay. As argued by Hedling in his essay on the film, Lilya 4-ever neatly fit into a kind of hegemonical Swedish Social Democracy and was used both abroad, by politicians to campaign against the sex slave trade, and domestically, shown to young people in high schools and to young men doing their military service (Hedling, 2004: 327–328). Internationally, the intent was to raise the alarm about trafficking, and domestically, it was to “inoculate” young men against becoming sex buyers (Hedling, 2004: 327).\n\nSex, Prostitution and the Other\n\nThe sex-buying law was part of a number of legislative measures aiming to counteract violence against women. Two public investigations preceded the legislation, one specifically on prostitution, the other on violence against women.1 The investigation on prostitution in fact suggested that the selling as well as the buying of sexual services should be made illegal. However, as a result of the responses to the investigation, the government criminalized the buyers of sexual services, that is, the “tricks” of the sex workers. The new law followed a certain logic: on the one hand, sex work was not regarded as a trade fit for a welfare society, but on the other, there was a hesitation to incriminate the sex workers themselves because it would further victimize them (“Kvinnofrid”, 1997/1998: 55: 104). By making it a crime to pay for sex, the intention was to change the focus from the sellers of sex to the buyers of sex, and consequently, the law became known as the sex-buying law. It had already been a crime to procure sexual services and to provide a place for prostitution, but from January 1, 1999, the only person still legally involved in prostitution was the sex worker.\n\nThe law has been quite aggressively debated. Although its intent was to thwart violence against women and to sustain a project of gender equality in Swedish society (Månsson, 2001: 135–136), objections from different perspectives have been voiced. One general objection has been that the law is not efficient: it does not stop prostitution but forces it underground, which makes the sex workers more susceptible to the hazards of the trade, such as rape, abuse, and even murder. Another objection, voiced by for instance social anthropologist and queer scholar Don Kulick, has been that the law reinforces a normative sexuality and reproduces the notion of Swedish sexuality as natural and progressive (Kulick, 2005). Although problematic in some respects, Kulick’s essay on the sex-buying law nonetheless makes an important point, namely the national con-\n\nrepresenting sexual transactions — 27\n\nstruction of a “good” sexuality. A third objection, raised by among others social anthropologist Petra Östergren and recently also notoriously by historian of ideas Susanne Dodillet, has been that the opinions of the sex workers themselves have never been taken into account, a point that has been disputed in an inflamed controversy after Dodillet’s dissertation Är sex arbete? (Is sex work?) was published (Östergren, 2006, Dodillet, 2009).2\n\nAlthough the sex-buying law, as Siring notes, functions to counteract trafficking (Siring, 2008: 335), it was not regarded as sufficient by the Swedish government, which in 2002 introduced a new law specifically against human trafficking for sexual purposes. The investigation preceding that decision declared that there were many different laws – besides the sex-buying law, for instance the laws against abduction and against the procuring of sexual services – that could be used as instruments against trafficking. However, the investigation maintained the need to strengthen the legal means to combat the international sex slave trade (SOU, 2001:14: 459). In the case of human trafficking for sexual purposes, an image of the Other in the shape of the former Soviet Union and its satellite states takes shape during the reading of the report. It describes the huge political changes these nations have undergone and explains that unemployment is abundant, that social welfare institutions have been forced to close and that there is a demand for sexual services in the richer part of the world (SOU, 2001:14: 421–422). Actually, in the paragraph in question, the report concurs, almost word for word, with the readings performed by Hedling and Hansell of the narrative logic in Lilya 4-ever. Furthermore, it fits neatly in with the documentarist’s analysis in Buy Bye Beauty. And, although not as explicitly, it coincides with the underlying implication of Torsk på Tallinn.\n\nThe Exploited Other\n\nIn Torsk på Tallinn, actually both the men partaking in the bus tour as well as the Estonian women can be said to take the role of exploited Other. The men because they in some sense fall outside of a heteronormative sexuality by being alone instead of married in a society where coupling – heterosexual or homosexual, although most often heterosexual – is the norm. Social anthropologist Lissa Nordin has studied single men living in the far north of Sweden and analyses, in an essay, their situation from a queer perspective (Nordin, 2005). She states that their situation is problematic because any way they turn, they are regarded with suspicion,\n\n28 — mariah larsson\n\nand perhaps especially so if they tried to find a partner abroad. Recounting the experiences of one man who, after frequent trips to Russia, married a Russian woman, she states that the respective motivations for both spouses were assumed to be other than love. The villagers held it to be true that the Russian woman, a school teacher, had duped him into marrying her, some were even positive that she had been a prostitute (Nordin, 2005: 41–44). This suspicion is essentially an underlying assumption in Torsk på Tallinn as well.\n\nIn a study of Russian women in Scandinavian media, Alexandra N. Leontieva and Karin Sarsenov present Torsk på Tallinn as an “illustrative example” of how men who look for companionship with women from the former Eastern Europe and Soviet Union are made into “a laughing stock” (Leontieva and Sarsenov, 2005: 141–142). All the men on the bus trip – perhaps with the exception of Micke, the “dipper” – are regarded somewhat from a distance. Although we, the spectators, laugh in recognition of the characters, they are still in some sense removed from us. This is in part an effect of the ethnographic quality of the supposed documentary, but also of the use of cleverly constructed character stereotypes. As a large part of the audience knows from having seen Killinggänget’s earlier productions, Percy Nilegård, the manager of the bus trip, is a cynical small-time entrepreneur, and in this film he exploits the lonely Swedish men as well as the Estonian women. This is evident as soon as the film starts, and as it progresses, this becomes more and more apparent, even for those who are not familiar with the Nilegård character. In a bizarre scene, he and the bus driver lock the travellers into the bus on the car deck of the ferry to Estonia. The scene underlines the cynicism of Nilegård, especially as, at the time of the film’s release, the memory of the foundering of the ferry Estonia in 1994, when almost one thousand people died, was still relatively fresh in the minds of the audience. While the bus windows become misty with condensation, Roland, who seems like the most romantic of the men, draws hearts on his window pane. Arriving in Estonia, the bus passes through the beautiful streets of Tallinn; however, the hotel is located in what is described by Nilegård as the “picturesque suburb of Paldiski”.\n\nPaldiski is also the location on which a large part of Lilya 4-ever was shot. It used to be a nuclear submarine base during the Soviet era and was abandoned in the mid-nineties. Now, only approximately 4000 people live there. Like Chernobyl, there are websites devoted to pictures from Paldiski, as in some kind of abject fascination for the drab archaeology of the former Soviet Union.3\n\nrepresenting sexual transactions — 2\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Paldiski – barbed wire ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLarge, desolate buildings in various stages of ruin, derelict homes, and apartment houses, seemingly in desperate need of renovation, provide ample opportunity for anyone with the intent to depict the former Soviet states as a present-day hell on earth. In both Torsk på Tallinn and Lilya 4ever, the images from Paldiski seem to reek of misery and the stale smell of decades of Communism – piles of trash, cheap materials, mildew, transpiring people in synthetic suits, and environmental pollution. It is as though the people living there have been abandoned just like the buildings. As Kristensen notes in his essay on the film: “The post-Socialist decay portrayed in Lilya 4-ever – the grey housing blocks, the courtyard’s muddy look, the derelict marine base – all register as despair on the faces of the characters, which in turn rouses the viewers’ empathy and desire to rescue the film’s victims” (Kristensen, 2007: 5).\n\nBecause Torsk på Tallinn focuses on the men, the film only offers hints of what the lives of the women might be like. There are three women in particular who stand out: Lule, the woman who follows one of the men back to Sweden; Svetlana, the wife of Lembit, Nilegård’s Estonian partner; and\n\n30 — mariah larsson\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Paldiski – house with wooden balconies ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEda, the love interest of the main character, Roland. At the beginning of the film, the men have expressed some of their hopes and expectations for the trip to the camera, so the audience understands, in some sense, what their motivations are. Like Nordin states in her essay about single men, they have a feeling that it is better not to be alone (Nordin, 2005: 35–36). When told, on the bus to Estonia, that the ratio is 3:1 in their favour (that is, three times as many women as men), they cheer. Regarding the motivation of the women, the spectator has to guess. Of course, Paldiski would be reason enough to want to leave, and although the film provides a quick look at Tallinn, Paldiski becomes like a synecdoche for the former Soviet Union – and even more so in Lilya 4-ever, which states in the beginning that it takes place “somewhere in the former Soviet Union”. This “somewhere” is a universalizing cue – it is not one particular and especially dull place because it could be anywhere in the former Soviet Union. That Lilya grabs her chance to leave when she gets it is unsurprising, even though she is warned by her younger friend Volodya, who later in the film himself “leaves” by committing suicide.\n\nrepresenting sexual transactions — 31\n\nIn Torsk på Tallinn, the Estonian women seem to have dressed up in their best clothes, which (even in 1999) are out-of-date and also look a bit like what a woman of a slightly older age would wear. The exception is Svetlana, whose clothes look like another stereotype of the former Soviet woman’s dress: she wears stilettos in patent-leather, white panty hose, a leather (or patent-leather) mini-skirt, and a white jacket with shoulder pads. Svetlana also provides a clue to the motivations of the other women – her husband bullies her and at one point in the film, he slaps her. Again, the film offers stereotypes, this time of a backward and poor nation where getting out might seem like the better alternative for young women. As Leontieva and Sarsenov note, dating agencies that specialize in match-making women from the former Eastern Europe and Soviet Union with Western men reinforce such stereotypes by presenting the women as more traditional and eager to please than their Western sisters are (Leontieva and Sarsenov, 2005: 141). Lule, who is the only one who actually leaves, can also – from the few scenes we see her in – be interpreted as very determined to leave and accepting the best possible offer of the men.\n\nNevertheless, one important motivation for the women who do, in reality, leave for an uncertain future in an EU nation is the fact that they have extremely few chances in their hometown or home country. All the uncertainties and dangers of living as an illegal immigrant in one of the EU countries may be preferable to living at home (Agustín, 2007: 45–46). This is definitely the case as it is depicted for Lilya in Lilya 4-ever, although Agustín claims that women migrants are usually aware of what kind of jobs may be open to them in an informal or illegal system (Agustín, 2007: 30–36). In the sex crime investigation that preceded the law on trafficking, it is frequently underlined that even though some women may know that they will work in prostitution, the conditions under which they will be working are unclear (SOU, 2001:14: 422–423). In the film, Lilya is depicted as an extreme victim, since she has no idea. Even though Volodya warns her about the intentions of the young man who has offered to take her to Sweden, Lilya seems youthfully unaware about what might be in store for her.\n\nExploited Sites/Sites of Exploitation\n\nThe shooting location for two of the three films, Paldiski, not only has a history from the Soviet era, but Paldiski is one of Estonia’s cities that had a Swedish name during a certain period of history. It was called Rågervik.\n\n32 — mariah larsson\n\nLocated on the coast of Estonia, it borders on an area inhabited by Estonian-Swedes who immigrated from Sweden to Estonia during the middle ages and later during the years 1561–1710 when Sweden controlled Estonia. Thus, Paldiski functions on two levels – one, as a site of the Other and, in the case of Lilya 4-ever, as the synecdoche of the entire former Soviet Union, and two, as a direct link between Sweden and the Baltic states. It is most likely that the second level did not occur to the filmmakers when they chose the location, or to the larger part of the audience. Consequently, it is not probable that there was a conscious point to be made by choosing that location, other than that it was conveniently nearby and looked its part. Nonetheless, Sweden’s relation to the Baltic states as well as to the former Soviet Union is complex and problematic. Historically, a large portion of the Swedish colonial expansion project stretched to the east, and during the Cold War, Sweden as a neutral “middle way” nation was not only geographically but also ideologically located in between NATO and the Warsaw pact.\n\nExcept for the emphasis on the “former Soviet Union” in Lilya 4-ever, no historical events are explicitly highlighted in the films. Nonetheless, in all three films, the choice of region and in two of them, the choice of location, form an abstract subtext to the very tangible action. The films may very well evoke a general and indistinct Swedish sense of unease, complicated relations, something problematic and, perhaps, a vaguely felt guilt regarding the Baltic region. Furthermore, this abstract subtext has its counterpart in the sense of homelessness that accompanies the exploitation of the Other. All three films underline the more or less homeless character of the sites of sexual transactions.\n\nIn Torsk på Tallinn, neither the men nor the women are at home, they meet on neutral ground. This neutral ground is the forlorn hotel in Paldiski, where the hard surfaces make all sounds echo and the attempts at decorating the room are quite futile. Its hotel rooms, additionally, are not only anonymous but have a bunker-like quality. The toilets are located behind shower curtains within the rooms. In cruel contrast with the romantic dreams conjured up by Percy Nilegård, this setting enhances the loneliness and the pointlessness of the sexual transactions taking place.\n\nIn Buy Bye Beauty, the final sexual transactions between the Latvian women and Pål Hollender also take place in anonymous, albeit more comfortable, hotel rooms. A point is made that the cost per night of the hotel room equals three Latvian monthly incomes. Lilya 4-ever, on the other hand, uses several settings for the sexual transactions – the night club in Lilya’s home country, the hotel room in which she has her first\n\nrepresenting sexual transactions — 33\n\ncustomer, the apartment, stripped bare of everything except the most necessary furniture, the car in which she is driven around. Most importantly, Lilya herself is orphaned and homeless, abandoned by her mother, driven from her home by her selfish aunt, placed in a run-down apartment and finally kept by her pimp in a foreign land. The montage that shows her encounters with the Swedish tricks presents various locations, some of which are homes – she sees the first man in his apartment and there is an upper-class male in his own house – but some of which are, for instance, what seems like a bachelor party in a swimming hall. However, the fragmented approach – apart from transferring Lilya’s disoriented experience to the spectator – seems to be making the point that these things can happen anywhere and that any man may be a trick.\n\nAll three films underline the language barrier between Swedish men and Estonian, Latvian or Russian-speaking women. In Torsk på Tallinn, there are interpreters to assist during the speed-dating, but having to communicate through a translator in only a few minutes obviously leaves something to be desired. In Buy Bye Beauty, the language is sometimes English, sometimes English with a translator. The voice-over narration, spoken by Hollender, is also in English and the film is subtitled in Swedish. And in Lilya 4-ever, Russian is the language through most of the film, subtitled in Swedish. Spoken Swedish is almost only heard spoken by the tricks and by the ambulance personnel in the last moments of the film. For a Swedish audience, the strategy of Lilya 4-ever might entail a distancing effect in relation to their own language when a person with whom they are supposed to empathize speaks a foreign language and the “bad guys” speak Swedish.\n\nFurthermore, in the scene showing Lilya at the house of the upperclass man, he is clearly trying to stage a paedophile scenario in which she is a little girl doing her home-work. Here, he speaks to her, instructing her, in Swedish, and she responds in Russian, the inability of either part to understand one another protecting Lilya as well as illustrating her ultimate homelessness.\n\nThe Female Body and Loss of Identity\n\nAs I stated at the beginning of the article, the ambivalent sentiment of fear and guilt concerning the post-cold war scenario can be regarded as projected onto sexual relations and more specifically the (young) female body. In a sense, the women in all three films in one way or another fall victim to large historical and global processes. Sex is the way of portray-\n\n34 — mariah larsson\n\ning this victimhood. Torsk på Tallinn complicates this analysis, as one could say that, in this film, all participants in the bus tour and the matchmaking – with a few exceptions – are victims of the ruthless business men who take advantage of their loneliness and desperation. However, in all three films, sexual intercourse forms important cross-over points, in which sex becomes a pivotal event. This cross-over point happens in Torsk på Tallinn, too. The events unfolding during the film’s climax, the loud and drunken party, end with Roland finding his love interest Eda in bed, not with any of the Swedish men, but with the presumed Serb or Yugoslav Slobodan (ironically, the name means “freedom” but to a Swedish audience at that time it was most probably associated with Slobodan Milosevic, then president of Yugoslavia).\n\nThe film provides clues as to how Eda ends up with Slobodan and also, considering Roland’s character, it seems that the course of events is inevitable. Roland tries to intervene in a problematic situation and gets stuck in the basement with the bus driver for some time, during which either Eda gives him up and settles for Slobodan instead or Slobodan moves in and proves a more proficient seducer than Roland. Nevertheless, whichever way one wants to interpret the sequence, the act is in a sense a betrayal, but by whom and of what is unclear. When Roland is walking around in the hotel corridor calling for Eda, extremely loud sounds of sexual activity are coming from Micke’s and Slobodan’s room. Interrupted by Percy Nilegård, Micke and Slobodan open the door and reveal that Svetlana and Eda are in the room. Surprise as well as affection is reflected in Roland’s and Eda’s faces and in their voices. However, Eda is brusquely pushed back into the room by Nilegård who shouts at Micke for “banging Lembit’s wife”.\n\nAgain, in Buy Bye Beauty, the act of sexual intercourse seems to be like a cross-over point. The discourse on exploitation, sexual tourism and prostitution, although quite agitated, is removed at some distance from the viewer. However, Hollender’s sex scenes with the women throw the economic reality of the situation blatantly in the viewer’s face. Preceding one of the sex scenes is an interview situation with a woman and her boyfriend. They discuss relationships, and they seem to be in agreement that a man should be able to look after his woman. The boyfriend strongly expresses his desire to protect his girlfriend. There is an abrupt cut to the sex scene between her and Hollender, with the boyfriend present in the room. Insidious as this juxtaposition of dialogue and image is, one could contend that he is, in fact, protecting her by controlling that she is not harmed during the intercourse. However, most people looking at that\n\nrepresenting sexual transactions — 35\n\njuxtaposition will probably conclude that it illustrates the ultimate failure and futility of the young man’s idealism. In all the sex scenes, the camera briefly shows the faces of the women, the expressions of which quite clearly underline the tragedy and emptiness of the whole situation. They do not look sad, angry, or disgusted, instead they look like their minds have been transported somewhere else. Although the version that most people in Sweden saw was censored through a blurring of the genital areas,4 and although – or perhaps because – the scenes were very short, they still conveyed a palpable abject feeling through the use of sound and the close-ups of faces.\n\nLilya 4-ever contains more scenes of sexual transactions than the other films. Elsewhere, I have argued that the use of POV camera in the montage sequence, which shows Lilya with a number of different tricks, functions in three different ways. Through the subjective camera, the tricks’ features become slightly contorted, which makes them look a bit grotesque, emphasizing the nightmarish quality of the montage. Furthermore, because Lilya is not shown in the montage, one could say that she is not objectified or eroticized by the camera’s and the audience’s gaze. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it illustrates the loss of identity and subjectivity Lilya experiences in Sweden (Larsson, 2006: 256). We cannot see her, so in a sense, she is not “there”. Her passport has been taken away from her, she does not speak the language, and her agency has been taken away from her too. Bit by bit, her personal identity is eliminated.\n\nAlbeit in different ways, all three films turn sexual intercourse into a highly emphasized event, saturated with significance outside the purely physical bodily action. It is the point – or in Lilya, several points – in all films in which the Otherness, the outside status of the women (and the men in Torsk på Tallinn), and the exploitation are at their fullest. That Lilya throws up, after her first experience at prostitution in her home country, is not only shown in order to express her own disgust and nausea at what happened, but also to demonstrate the film’s ideological point that sexual transactions harm the actual bodily self of the woman performing them. Very likely, the diversity of the tricks Lilya encounters in the montage sequence is intended to show a (stereo)typology of Swedish males – the lonely, older man, young men at a bachelor party, and the upper-class pervert. Just as the Swedish poster campaign from 2002 displaying a group of men and stating “One out of eight men has bought sex at some time” implicitly asked the viewer whether he or she can make out which of the men could be a presumptive sex buyer, Lilya 4-ever seems to state that anyone – or rather, any male – can be a sex buyer, a trick.5\n\n36 — mariah larsson\n\nEarly in Buy Bye Beauty, Hollender as the voice-over narrator explains to the viewers that in Riga “nothing is what it seems to be”. The cute old ladies selling vegetables in the market square are all controlled by one business man, the police force is corrupt, the taxi drivers make more money from mediating encounters with prostitutes, etc. Scenes from night clubs, restaurants, the streets and interviews are recurringly intercut with a shot of Riga’s rooftops, with a setting or rising sun in the cloudy background, as if the film is trying to remind us that, although it looks quite nice (perhaps even “picturesque”), nothing is what it seems.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, I would contend that it is no coincidence that the sex-buying law and the law against human trafficking for sexual purposes were implemented during the same few years as these films were released. Both the laws and the films indicate the same national anxiety, but whereas the films express that anxiety, the laws attempt to contain it. The anxiety deals with some kind of fear of a national contamination: that the problems over there (galloping capitalism, non-existing welfare systems, etc.) will contaminate and affect us here, for instance obstruct progress in issues of gender equality. Leontieva and Sarsenov quote an observation by Norwegian folklore scholar Stein Mathisen, who maintains that the former military threat has become a hygienic problem and the soldiers are not Russian men anymore, but Russian women (Leontieva and Sarsenov, 2005: 139). The threat is embodied by prostitutes or imported wives from the former Soviet states – female sexuality becomes something that is both feared and viewed as being in need of protection. Furthermore, what is apparent in these films is that the depicted sex is bad. In Buy Bye Beauty and Lilya 4-ever, it is physically bad sex for the women, and at least morally bad sex for the men. In Torsk på Tallinn, the sex is morally bad. This ties in with Don Kulick’s argument about the national construction of a “good” sexuality. Since 1955, when the practice of mandatory sex education started in schools, sexuality has been a small but important part of the Swedish welfare project (Lennerhed, 1994, cf. Kulick, 2005). Looking at how the Swedish Institute reacted to and used the concept of “Swedish sin” that began to circulate in the world in the 1950s, historians Nikolas Glover and Carl Marklund detect a tendency in the Institute’s publications to construct the issue of sex in Sweden as a matter of rationality, realism, democracy, and equality between the sexes (Glover & Marklund, 2009). According to this self-reflection, it is not “sin” at all,\n\nrepresenting sexual transactions — 37\n\nit is rather the opposite. Swedish sexuality is morally sound. This provides a historical background as to why the national anxiety surrounding world political and economic developments focuses on the sexual aspects of globalization, especially concerning itself with the fate of women and children.\n\nHowever, and in addition to this, the phenomenon of connecting a national anxiety concerning globalization to the fate of women and children is not new or incidental: Historian Ann Hallner has compared the discourse surrounding the white slave trade in the early twentieth century with the discourse of trafficking almost a hundred years later (Hallner, 2009). In his essay on Lilya 4-ever, Hedling explains that the film can be regarded in the light of a melodramatic film genre from the silent era, the “white slave-trade films” like Traffic in Souls (George Loane Tucker, 1913) and Den hvide Slavehandel (Alfred Lind, 1910) (Hedling, 2004: 324–325). Although Hallner does not mention the films of the 1910s, it seems as though the discourse of white slave trade as well as the discourse of trafficking contains a handful of films as well as articles, speeches, and laws. That these national or social anxieties are expressed in films is thus not a coincidence either.\n\nAgain, I want to underline that this essay concerns the discourse of sexual transactions across national borders, not the actual phenomenon. As a discourse, these three films tapped into a general apprehension concerning the global movement of female migrants, dissolving national boundaries, and sexual behaviours. Additionally, they specified the Other as a post-Soviet woman by locating the sexual transactions in the former Soviet Union, and in two cases particularly and explicitly in two of the Baltic states, consequently evoking a particular Swedish (perhaps Nordic) ambiguous fear and paternalism. What Kristensen notes about Lilya 4ever is actually applicable to the other two films as well. The Nordic countries, according to Kristensen, “foster a Russian Other against which their own national identities are projected” (Kristensen, 2007: 8). In the case of these three films, though, I would identify the nationality of the Other as more ambiguously post-Soviet, in some cases explicitly Baltic.\n\n38 — mariah larsson\n\nThe significance placed on the act of sexual intercourse also locates the sexual transactions on the female body. Thus, in the Swedish imagination, as materialized in these three films, a kind of distorted colonial perspective can be discerned. Through this perspective, the former Soviet Union is connected with the (young) female body and a female sexuality that is exploited by the larger forces of capitalism and globalization.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------references\n\nAgustín, Laura María (2007), Sex at the Margins: Migration, Labour Markets and the\n\nRescue Industry (London & New York: Zed Books).
