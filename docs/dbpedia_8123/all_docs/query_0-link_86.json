        "text": "Hi, first of all, I want to thank you for answering my question on Heraclitus on the McCabe podcast. The new interpretation on b.125 really changes the sense of the fragment and even its philosophical value. In another subject (appealing to Pico’s interpretation of Heraclitus considering that philosophy comes from conflict and discussion) I’d like to comment a thing or two on Parmenides, particularly on the subject of the roads of truth and opinion. I think that we have some good evidence that lead us to think that the cosmology on the road of opinion is a way to recover our basic intuitions on how tings appear to us in the day to day world. The fact that we have more than 100 testimonies that refer to Parmenides cosmology and natural philosophy suggests that this road is not to be taken as a sort of exoteric philosophy, opposed to the esoteric doctrine of the road of thud.\n\nI think this is important because, under this interpretation, both roads on Parmenides poem can be taken as part of a complementary doctrine. To ways of dealing with reality: by pure reason and with the intervention of senses. Under this interpretation Parmenides is not to be taken as someone who ignores or denigrates senses, but as someone who integrates senses and reason on one doctrine. I think that there is one more thing that motivates this interpretation and it’s the interpretation of Sextus Empiricus in the first part of Parmenides Poem (S. E. Adversus Mathematicos VII, 111-114). In this passage, he interprets the first part of the poem as a metaphor of senses (eyes and ears particularly) guided by reason. I must admit that this testimony can carry a lot of free interpretation on its back but it can be taken as least as a provocative road for Parmenides interpretation.\n\nI’ll be glad to know your opinion on this subject. Keep on with the good work. Me and some colleges hear in Mexico are following your podcasts and supporting your effort.\n\nPeter,\n\nI've been working on a project for school (NSNVA) concerning Plato's theory of Forms. I encountered Parmenides through reading the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry on \"Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology\" and utilized this podcast as I tried to comprehend the material. A basic understanding of Parmenides is essential to understanding where Plato's theories may have come from (as far as the relevance of his work to my research is of concern). I've posed all of my notes for this project at http://cogitoetnoesis.blogspot.com/ for my content advisor to reference and monitor. I may have gotten a few things wrong or not specifically cited a concept or explanation particular to you. It's a rough draft at best and not close to the final research paper which is one of the end goals. I was a bit confused towards the end of this podcast, once you began exploring the question \"what does Is refer to\" or something like that. Anyways, I was wondering if you could *very* quickly glance over the few paragraphs I have written as notes on this podcast, to make sure I'm not sufficiently crediting your work and maybe if by reading my understanding of the material--you can explain the bits I need to know but don't understand?? I know this is a lot to ask, and really your podcasts as a whole have been extraordinarily comprehensive and useful for me. Needless to say, you're in no way obligated to respond to this comment, etc. And yes, I am aware that you additionally have an episode on Plato Parmenides, and the theory of forms--also quite useful.\n\nThank you,\n\nMelody\n\nLieber Herr Prof. Dr. Peter Adamson!\n\nWhy have you excluded aesthetics and logic from philosophy, since you do not list them in what you claim to be a comprehensive itemisation of its branches?\n\nThe exclusion of logic I would understand since it may reasonably be argued that at some time between 1879 and 1913, or strictly speaking in fact 1927, logic was annexed by mathematics, though as regards the period of philosophy preceding this, this point of view can only be maintained by insisting on limiting the extent to which one attempts to adopt the point of view of the past in a way strongly constrained by our present knowledge of what logic can be and presently is in its latest incarnation.\n\nAs for aesthetics, in which part of my own work takes place, I was not aware it was not pert of philosophy, nor presumably then are parts of philosophy: Plato's views on tragedy and poetry, Aristotle's Poetics, Kant's Kritik der Urteilskraft, Hegel's Vorlesungen über die Ästhetik, and so on. Of course I'm open to any point of view for which I find the arguments overwhelming or better than the arguments for any other point of view where it seems sufficiently paramount to have one, however I am not familiar with the arguments in favour of this thesis that conform to these characteristics.\n\nMay I know please either i) where your or the relevant writings showing aesthetics is not part of philosophy are, or ii) why you take the view that easthetics is not part of philosophy, or iii) why you asserted, together with logic, that they were not part of philosophy? Thankyou.\n\nThis is all very intriguing and as fas as I know revolutionary, though perhaps a few logical positivists would have agreed to exclude logic and aesthetics from philosophy, and indeed argued for this. In any case it is revolutionary to hold such views in 2014, including the views that from the modern standpoint, Kant's Logik and Hegel's Wisseschaft der Logik do not belong to philosophy. I will be continuing to listen to the whole series you are in part responsible for, but am very perplexed by these views of yours I confess, though simultaneously tantalised since the arguments in favour of such unorthodox assertions must be staggering.\n\nYrs. v. sincerely, gratefully and truthfully,\n\nAubrey Richard Wanliss-Orlebar\n\nI applaud your goal of time-lining Philosophy with no gaps.\n\nIt would be more appropriate to call it Western Philosophy with no gaps.\n\nParmenides, the father of Metaphysics, was almost entirely influenced by the most cogent and beautiful philosophies/metaphysics ever written:\n\nADVAITA VEDANTA\n\nYup. Socrates and Plato were deeply influenced, carrying it on, and Aristotle most ceratinly reacted to it, unable to turn inward, beyond the limits of language. hence, all the focus on logos and gategorization. All works built on the shoulders of Indian giants (or in reaction to...).\n\nDo a google search for 'advaita vedanta eleatic monism' to find reference. I can't paste any urls here.\n\nConsider yourself an Indiana Jones when you step into that cave, because most people think philosophy started with the Greeks-- you will be discovering an unknown culture that understood well the limits of language, and that predeceded our deluded materialist worldview (that we have Aristotle and Descartes to blame for).\n\nElliot Deutsch from U. of Hawaii wrote a brilliant book called Advaita Vedanta, and the article out of New Zealand, that you'll find performing the google search above, is very straightforward.\n\nI have only just stumbled upon this blog. Congratulations, Peter, on such a wonderful project.\n\nI too have long puzzled over the Eleatic problem. How could Parmenides and his followers deny the reality of the world in which they lived, breathed and philosophised?\n\nYour podcast and the subsequent discussions led me to take another look at the Parmenides poem, and I might have found a couple of insights into the Eleatic mindset.\n\nFirst the isolated fragment 3: \"For Thinking and Being are the same.\"\n\nSecondly, towards the end of the extensive fragment 8 revealing the nature of the One:\n\nlines 34-37: \"Thinking, and that for the sake of which there is thought, are the same.\n\nFor you will not find Thinking without the Being, in which it is expressed*;\n\nFor nothing else was, is or will be, except Being.\"\n\n(*is this the best translation of 'pephatismenon'?)\n\nIf I understand this correctly, Parmenides takes it as axiomatic that there is no distinction between what we might call the Subjective and the Objective, between thoughts in the mind and events in the external world. So when you think of the One, as you are supposed to do, that thought is part of the One, and since the One has no parts or internal divisions, your mind is in a sort of communion with the One.\n\nAnd presumably the same axiom applies to the Way of Opinions: thoughts and things are part of the same nexus, your process of thinking about a giraffe and the alleged life and times of the giraffe are ontologically identical - and, in addition, equally false.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nFirst of all, congratulations with these great series, I'm fairly new to the subject and it's a great way to discover philosophy. I really enjoyed the first 6 episodes, but Parmenides is a bit harder to wrap my head around. Concerning the giraffe: if the giraffe dies, in my \"way of opinion\" it ceases to be a giraffe. It still has features of a giraffe, the body is still there, but it won't eat leaves anymore, won't move, walk, mate etc, so logically you can't talk about a giraffe anymore, since essential parts of the giraffe are no more. If Parmenides would have to explain this, would he argue that in the \"way of truth\" the giraffe remains a giraffe (since nothing stops from being) and how would he do so? I searched around a bit but didn't find a lot about Parmenides and how he explained death. He could argue, I guess, that body and consciousness (soul) are mere human believes/opinions and that in the way of truth, all these things are \"one\", which I can understand, but how can he deny the change the giraffe has undergone? If I ask my 6 year old daughter \"what is a giraffe?\", she will probably answer: \"an animal with a long neck that eats leaves from trees.\" If it no longer eats leaves from trees, it's no longer a giraffe, so it has changed, stopped being a giraffe and went on being something else, no? What would Parmenides tell my daughter? :-)\n\nParmenides would have been non-plussed then at the Christian idea of creation ex nihilo. Not only do Christians traditionally believe that Being comes from Non-Being but the reverse as well, that Being can cease to be. This is based, I think, on a different understanding of the nature of existence. Only God has existence in Himself. For all other things, existence is a borrowed property. Things exist because God wills them to exist, and if He ceases to will their existence, then they cease to exist. It is interesting to me how some simple idea like existence can entail certain logical imperatives for one person and not for another. What is self-evident for one may not be at all self-evident for another, particularly when such basic concepts as existence are involved. In mathematical jargon, Parmenides and Christians start with different sets of axioms.\n\nFirstly I must say I love this podcast, thank you for all the effort you have put in. I had 2 questions:\n\n1)When Parmenides says if I can think of something it must exist, does he include thoughts in the realm of existence? For example a unicorn exist in my thoughts but not in the material world, but Parmenides would not classify a unicorn as non being since I can think about it.\n\n2)When Parmenides says I cant say « It is not » is it for all negative prepositions ex. « My cat is not blue » what would be problematic in that sentence according to Parmenides. Or is it just problematic when we talk about existence of things « my cat is not »\n\nDear Peter,\n\nthank you so much for creating this wonderful podcast. On one hand it’s a shame I only discovered it now but on the other hand I am looking forward to having nearly 400 episodes still ahead of me!\n\nSo far, Parmenides got me thinking a lot and I would love to be able to read (the fragments) of his poem and let my thoughts ‘chew on it’. Obviously, I stumbled into the problem of not mastering the Ancient Greek and thus I am looking for a good translation. Do you have any recommendations for which you consider the best English translation?\n\nThank you very much in advance!"
