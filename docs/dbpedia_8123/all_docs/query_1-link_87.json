        "text": "15. The Parmenidean Cosmology of Parmenides*\n\nThe doxa of the unintelligible\n\nIn 1901, Diels made a note regarding fragment 12, at the beginning of his critical edition: nondum prorsus explicatum (“not yet precisely explained”). In his positivist faith, he believed that time would do the rest.\n\nThe lack of coherence of the account in Aetius (A37) does not have the same function for all the authors who have cited it. Either the testimony is rejected altogether as unintelligible, as it is by Guthrie (1965), for whom it justifies agnosticism, or else the verdict of incoherence has to allow for a free reconstruction. Scholars feel authorized to accommodate all the arrangements that the restoration “according to Parmenides” calls for. The analysis of the options will necessarily oscillate between an element of scientific discussion, on the {182|183} basis of the premises (and prejudices) that the author is trying to advance, and another more personal element that sets science aside and rules out discussion.\n\nThe impasse of composite constructions\n\nThe succession of the spheres (in a free, unjustified order), for which Couloubaritsis juxtaposes (without studying their relationship) A 37 and B 12, even though the texts bear on exactly the same object, is localized in an upper part of the world, exempt from becoming, which would begin in a center, amid the mixed crowns (in this case, one would have to acknowledge with Couloubaritsis that the blend preexisted, in a non-dynamic form, below the periphery). The milieu of all the crowns, in the upper part of the world, and the seat of the goddess, at the center of the mixed crowns (according to A 37 and B 12), were for him two distinct places. All of astronomy (even the fixed bodies of the vault) thus had to be situated below the center of the mixed elements. If one were to extract the elements of the reading (they are there) from this free and “synchronic” construction, one would have a way to reread the texts and to decipher the reference on that basis. The construction belongs to the author alone, apart from any possible debate. Immobility does not coexist with movement in one part of the world; the blend is not partially immobile, and so forth.\n\nThe problem of the igneous zone surrounding the earth\n\nNon-mixing (frag. 9)\n\nThe principle of non-sharing is formulated in fragment 9, based on the rigorous autonomy of Day and Night.\n\nThe unblended purity of the principles is maintained in the surprising geometry of their initial cosmic distribution. To interpret the fragments of the cosmology in the broad sense (10–15), we must not give up on Theophrastus’ interpretation, which is preserved in Aetius’s manual. Placed at the beginning of the chapter titled περὶ τάξεως κόσμου (On the Order of the Cosmos) (2.7.1), this text served as a referential framework for doxographic reflection on the spatial representation of systems. Theophrastus’ text can be divided into three parts. A first part summarizes a pre-cosmic or pre-cosmogonic structure; a second refers to the movements that give rise to the elementary differentiation and to the interaction of the principles; a third, finally, describes the arrangements of the parts of the world that has come into being, according to the title of Aetius’ chapter, “On the Organization of the Universe.” One stage follows from the other and leads to this end. To avoid the confusion that characterizes modern readings and compromises the rare attempts to rediscover the coherence of the whole, we must distinguish three developments in the text that correspond to different moments in the cosmographic construction. The first includes a purely geometric structure that is closely tied to the mutual exclusion of fragment 9.\n\nAetius (A 37) I: before the cosmogonic movement\n\nPreceding the concrete localization of the parts, at the center, at the periphery, and in the middle, the abstract schema presents in the first place the mode of distribution of the principles prior to any interpenetration:\n\na. The Initial distribution (A 37 1 a)\n\nThe first part of Aetius A 37 preserves a symmetrical description that, as such, was not usable for a cosmography. This was the source of the difficulties. The symmetry appeared puerile and inadequate. No one, or almost no one, agreed to consider the schematic structure, and even those who did so retained its consequences only partially at best.\n\nTheophrastus’ use of the word “mix” is not accidental, even if mixing as the rhythm of the partition is analyzed at the heart of the structure itself. It expresses the paradoxical truth of an organization that leads to blending through intensification of the antithesis. {192|193}\n\nIf Theophrastus’ interpretation is correct by virtue of a deeper coherence than the mere possibility of solving the problems posed by the text, line 2 of fragment 12 does not describe a zone of blending, as it is commonly understood, but rather a closer and closer succession, which can be confirmed, on the one hand, with the help of the opposition with “pure” (ἀκρήτοιο, line 1)—there were layers of pure night before there were the layers of pure fire at the extremities—and, on the other hand, by the arrival at the median line, the place from which the goddess acts (line 3).\n\nOne cannot go back, before cosmology, to find the arrangement of the original duality, without also going back before the cosmogony. As a consequence, the pre-cosmogonic structure has to be—this is a postulate—closely related to the conditions and the beginning of the cosmogonic movements.\n\nFragment 12, lines 1–2\n\nThe very reduced difference (which is acknowledged) inside a pair of contraries would not call into question the principle of equipollence, if the lesser surface occupied by fire, as compared to night, is compensated by the higher degree of intensity of one mass that is less inert than the other. The mobility and the relation between fine and dense matter would thus also be prefigured, at the heart of the initial division; difference in equality is its leading principle.\n\nThe text of the fragment does not indicate that the doubling of the pairs is pursued in the direction of the median line where the divinity of the blend resides, but the superlative in Theophrastus’ summary, the most median of the mixed elements, allows us to suppose that the initial structure is reproduced an indefinite number of times (see also the indeterminate expression μικτὰς δ’ ἄλλας) [“others mixed”]). Moreover, it is consistent with the logic of the system that in a first stage the two opposing forces occupy the whole without blending together. The term mixed, used by Theophrastus to designate the internal non-blended rings, is well explained by the hypothesis that posits a decreasing arrangement in which the interior pair, even while preserving the initial proportion of thicknesses, would consistently occupy the breadth of a single one (presumably the first) of the rings that form the preceding pair. The gradual shrinking of the intact rings prefigures and anticipates the interpenetration of the blending.\n\nb / The extreme limits set by darkness (A 37 1 b)\n\nc / The middle (A 37 I c; frag. 12, 3-6)\n\nThe duality is canceled out at this breaking point in the system, where unification is sure to come about in the world between two contrary identities:\n\nThe place where the goddess is found is clearly defined. The localization is unproblematic provided that one understands the succession of rings as a complete symmetrical system traversing the universe without a break (since the genitive τούτων applies to the rings, ἐν μέσῳ necessarily refers to the median point). The structure of the pre-cosmogonic exclusion of circles situated closer and closer together produces blending, by pushing the division to the ultimate explosion, at the point where the circles meet.\n\nInterpreted, the diagram would make it clear that union, in blending, results from division, thanks to the finer and finer demarcation of distinct entities. There would be a “blend” without blending, in the terms of the doxographic {198|199} text, at the heart of the opposition. The two principles thus enter into the effective blend of the genesis of the world, while keeping their own identities; these identities are transferred and preserved beyond the dividing line. The relation between the initial abstract order and the dynamic phase of the constitution of the cosmic order becomes clear in light of this passage, which ensures the preservation of the inalienable features of each of the opposing principles, which are at once refractory and at the same time by that very token the authors of the blend. The goddess represents this law of duality constrained in the One; she presides over it and is produced by it.\n\nReinhardt’s position, contradictory only in its impure application, was clearly anticipated by Karsten and others (Reinhardt was situating himself vis-à-vis the scientific authority of his immediate predecessors and did not look further back): habitare hanc Deam … paribus intervallis a mundi centro et circuitu distantem, unde ipsa … moderator (“The goddess lives … at equal distances from the center of the universe and at a distance from the circuit … of which she is herself the ruler”) (Reinhardt 1916:252). The research could have been linked to that of Karsten and the others, as was the case nearly a century later, in Nestle’s conclusions at the end of his discussion (Zeller-Nestle 1920:718).\n\nAetius (A 37) II: The cosmogony, the dynamism of fire\n\nLike the succession of alternating spheres, the cosmogonic movements start both from the center and from the periphery. But a dissymmetry appears at once. The centrifugal movement that starts from the “earth,” from the central core, occupied by night, is triggered by the whirlwinds of fire. The centripetal movement develops, starting from the fire that has collected under the solid vault. The reason for this dissymmetry is that, in a first phase of the blending, fire had risen up from everywhere, crossing the barrier set up by the dark rings; concomitantly, night established itself below. The intensification of the blending, indicated by the comparative more violent compression (βιαιοτέραν … πίλησιν), reverses the movements. Under the influence of the rotations of the fire, night rises, in the form of air; the fire spreads and descends to form the sun and the Milky Way. The moon is born following the meeting of the two convergent emanations of air and astral fire.\n\nIf the moon is made of air and if fire (according to A 37) is formed from one of the blends (the cold) from the median zone (A 43), the air in question might not be the air that was separated from the earth (τῆς μὲν γῆς ἀπόκρισιν), but rather the more primitive representative of night, captured in the center, in the Milky Way. Two different blends oppose one another in the sun and the moon (according to A 43).\n\nThe program of fragment 11\n\nThe traditional interpretation understands as “common” the circular envelopment of the world by the diffuse ether. Untersteiner applies the idea to the duality of day and night; at the outer edges of the sky (namely, the firmament), the ether embraces the (internal) temporality and the atemporality of Being (1958:CXCIIIn98). The communication that is established by the ether in fact connects, intra muros, the separate parts of the world. The division is achieved, and is thus surmounted, in the ether.\n\nThe fixed astral bodies are distinguished as an entity of the vault, Olympus. Heat is not exclusive to the sun that heats the earth. The other astral bodies, originating from the same principle, have the same property, which escapes us. It is not transmitted to us. Whereas the sun and the moon, originating from the median blend, attest by their difference to the opposition of thin-hot and dense-cold, the astral bodies of the vault, originating at the outer limits of pure fire, are hot (hence their distinctive epithet, “burning force” (θερμὸν μένος), in relation to the localization at the extremities: “outermost” (ἔσχατος). {206|207}\n\nAetius (A 37) III: Beyond cosmogony, the division of the world\n\nAll that men see of the sky, taken as the reunion of the astral signs, is perceived in relation to the assembly of the milky trail in the center, and, as it were, through that trail. Thus Parmenides distinguished the igneous zone “which we have called [κεκλήκαμεν] the Heavens,” from the reference points that are above the planets in the ether and the fixed bodies in the firmament (called “Olympus”).\n\nFragment 10. —The lines of fragment 10 sketch in the cosmology, the current state of the world; they expose the internal tripartition that is reproduced by Theophrastus:\n\nIt suffices to give ἀμφις ἔχειν the (epic) meaning of to separate on both sides in order to be constrained once again to give up identifying the sky with the external limit of the world (περιέχον). Interposed between the ethereal region and the vaporous region, the Milky Way is the place where the divinity who governs acts. It is she who, under the name of Necessity (see A 37), leads the expansion of the blend, on both sides of the median line, and stops the course of the astral bodies, preventing the sun from penetrating into the atmosphere and the moon from rising into the ether.\n\nThe system of astral bodies is governed and regulated from the center of the world. The difference in viewpoints is fully apparent in the translation of the ἀμφὶς ἔχοντα of fragment 10, which, in the logic of the general distribution determining the median separation of the celestial zone, must be understood as “setting aside” toward the upper and lower regions, whereas the common representation leads to the repeated reuse of a translation “encircling all around,” which is in contradiction with the structure of opposition.\n\nParmenides’ cosmology has incited far fewer studies than the ontology on which it is based. For a long time, it was not attributed to him. What makes the interpretation of the physical system so arduous is not that there are gaps in our information, however real these may be, but the force of abstraction in the representation of the world, which is just as strong as the force of speculation in {210|211} the definition of what is. Rigor makes the reconstruction easier, allowing us to rely on the implacable logic of the whole.\n\nOriginating in the contrary tensions that traverse the figure of visualized Being, the opposition between the elementary powers is reaffirmed at the various stages of the perceptible revelation. The initial, geometric diagram of concentric circles makes comprehensible the description of the cosmogonic process leading to the rise of fire and the descent of the dense element. The blend resulting from the median encounter produces new separations. The cosmology makes visible the primordial antagonism in the regions of the universe, the ether lodged under the nocturnal vault, the atmosphere surrounding the terrestrial globe, and in the middle the divine region, called the sky or the Heavens, of the differentiated blends and of separation. The gentle (ἤπιον) light of perceptible knowledge, where Aristotle saw an equivalence of Being, is spread over the ordered totality of phenomena, over fire and what is not fire, and ends up harmonizing with knowledge because it is regulated according to the figuration of Being. {211|}\n\nWorks Cited\n\nFootnotes"
