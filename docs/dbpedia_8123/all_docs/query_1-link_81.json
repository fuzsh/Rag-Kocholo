Pythagoras and Parmenides were two of the most influential thinkers of the Pre-Socratic period in ancient Greek philosophy. Parmenides, born in c.440, Elea, S. Italy was one of the great thinkers of this time, and was highly regarded by the later philosopher Plato. Plato even named one of his later texts “Parmenides” after the great philosopher. Pythagoras was equally as influential, living from 570 to ca. 490 BCE. Little is known of this man as he had no writings that are known of. However, he is acknowledged as a great man of mathematics and science. He is thought to have;\n\nProved the incommensurability between the side and the diagonal of the square and the equivalence between the square of the hypotenuse and the sum of the squares of the sides in a right-angled triangle.\n\nParmenides critical thinking of pre-Socratic philosophical mysteries paved the way for many future philosophers. What these …show more content…\n\nThe Pythagoreans were known as skilled mathematicians, and they believed the principles of mathematics were the principles of all things. According to Pythagoras, the elements in numbers are the elements found in all things. These elements as they were called were divided up into an ultimate dualism Limited and Unlimited, or Odd and Even. All things were linked together in a table of either Limited or Unlimited, odd or even, male or female, good or evil… McInery noted in his article on early Greek Philosophy of how:\n\nAristotle recognized that number is matter and form for the Pythagoreans. What we must understand, if we are to grasp the identification of physics and mathematics, is the notion of oddness and evenness as the ‘elements of number,’ the relation between these and the number one and the numbers proper which follow from"
