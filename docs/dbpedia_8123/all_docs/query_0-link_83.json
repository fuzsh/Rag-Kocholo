        "text": "Τhe title of this paper, \"Parmenides the Pythagorean\", has not been invented by the author, it has been \"discovered\" in ancient sources and constitutes a quotation. In his description of Elea Strabo calls Parmenides and Zeno ἄνδρες Πυθαγόρειοι. In 1892 John Burnet has replaced this ancient perception of Parmenides with a new one, \"the father of materialism\". The physicalist interpretation of Parmenides' concept of being (which derives from the late 19th century positivist reaction to Hegelianism and German idealism in the historiography of Greek philosophy) involves unsurmountable difficulties. What might be the purpose of a «theory» that the real world is a changeless mass of dead matter? Why was it presented as a divine revelation? Why would Dike, the personified Justice and concomitant of Zeus (a religious notion for any Greek in archaic times), hold this strange object in the \"bonds of limit\" and what would happen if she released it? Why did the real materialists of the ancient world, the Epicureans like Colotes, ridicule Parmenides as immaterialist? How could Plato (who scorned materialists) find in it extraordinary βάθος and proclaim its author μέγας? How could all ancient philosophers (who had in their hands the complete text of Parmenides) from Plato to Plotinus be mistaken about the nature of Parmenides' being? The followers of Burnet's physicalist interpretation avoid even to pose, let alone to answer these question. In our view there is only one possibility to make philosophical sense of Parmenides ' poem: to take seriously the ancient tradition of his Pythagorean background and to interpret his metaphysics as idealistic monism or immaterialism. The sphere of Being described in the Aletheia is not a lump of dead matter, but the divine Sphairos of the Western Greek philosophical theology (cf. Xenophanes and Empedocles), conceived as pure Nous (Mind) which is the only true reality. The identity of Being and Mind is explicitly stated by Parmenides in fr. B 3, Zeller's and Burnet's interpretation is grammatically impossible and never occurred to any ancient reader. \"What-is\", conceived as a sphere of divine light endowed with consciousness, is also the invisible \"Sun of Justice\" (the Sun that «never sets»), an archaic idea known to Heraclitus and imitated by Plato in the allegory of the Sun in the Republic. Night (the symbol of body and corporeal matter) does not exist, it is an empty name resulting from a linguistic mistake of mortals who misnamed the absence of light as a separate substance. The Kouros of the Proem is not Parmenides himself, but an Apollonian image of his venerated teacher Pythagoras whose soul ascended to the celestial temple (oracle) of gods in a winged chariot and received there an oracular revelation from Aletheia herself, a great gift to humanity that liberated men from the veil of ignorance and fear of death. The first part of Parmenides' poem was not just an exercise in speculative metaphysics concerned with problems of motion and plurality, but a handbook of philosophical theology and practical psychology with ethical and political implications: the attributes of the divine absolute are paradigmatic for the personality of an ideal citizen abiding to law (Dike) and a warrior who has no fear of death and pain, since he knows that his soul is immortal and his body is just a «shadow of smoke” (σκιὰ καπνοῦ). The immobility of the divine Sphere is not a physical theory, but a psychological paradigm of the ataraxia and tranquillity (hesychia) of the wise who has eradicated all passions: in Greek psychology pathos is commonly conceived as kinesis of the soul. Strabo's remark that the laws established by ἀνήρ Πυθαγόρειος Parmenides ensured the military victories of poor Elea over her enemies is not phantastic at all: the Pythagorean/Eleatic warriors had no fear of death, like Zeno of Elea who was tortured by the tyrant and died as a hero or like the Samian admiral Melissus who fought against the Athenian empire. Incidentally, what kind of inspiration could these heroic characters (as well as the lawmaker Parmenides) receive from the strange theory that the real world is a mass of lifeless matter? Melissus (a professional military man) explicitly states that the Eleatic being is incorporeal and feels no pain. The opposition of the “two roads”, as well as the third road of the \"two-headed\" thinkers, is not just theoretical or methodological: it is a history of Greek philosophy as perceived by a Pythagorean in the early fifth century BC. The “road of being and Truth” is the divine philosophy of Pythagoras, the “road of non-being” and falsehood is the naturalistic monism of the Ionians (rejected by Pythagoras), and the “two-headed” guys are the Heracliteans who try in their pantheism to combine the Pythagorean theory of the divine cosmic mind with the Ionian naturalism and who admit the identity of being (mind, light) and non-being (body, night), as well as the \"reverse road\" of the interchange between cosmic opposites (παλίντροπος quoted verbatim from Heraclitus). Heraclitus attacked Pythagoras for his metaphysical dualism and accused him of stealing alien wisdom, Parmenides defends his teacher, ridicules Heraclitus and follows the orthodox Pythagorean view according to which Pythagoras received his doctrine of the immortal soul directly from the gods, and not from the barbarians. This article, inter alia, proposes three new readings of Parmenides' Proem and identifies as a neglected verbatim quotation from Parmenides in Proclus the poetic words \"The Maiden of the High Gates\" (Νύμφη Ὑψιπύλη) which refer to the philosophical Pythia of Parmenides, the goddess Aletheia and probably come from the last verses of the poem. The \"High Gates\" are the \"Gates of Day and Night\", the destination of Kouros' flight. This quotation alone refutes all \"katabasis\" interpretations of the proem. The gates are located \"high in the sky\" (αἰθέριαι), not in the netherworld. It is methodologically incorrect to interpret Greek philosophers on the basis of presumed \"parallels\" from Greek poetry (Hesiod in this case) since the general world-view of the philosophers is \"toto caelo\" distant from that of the poets, as a result of which the same words and phrases often have different referential meaning."
