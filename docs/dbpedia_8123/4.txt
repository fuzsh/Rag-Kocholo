All things were linked together in a table of either Limited or Unlimited, odd or even, male or female, good or evil… McInery noted in his article on early Greek Philosophy of how:

Aristotle recognized that number is matter and form for the Pythagoreans. What we must understand, if we are to grasp the identification of physics and mathematics, is the notion of oddness and evenness as the ‘elements of number,’ the relation between these and the number one and the numbers proper which follow from
