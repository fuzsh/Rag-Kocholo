Her biography has been translated into 52 different languages on wikipedia.\n\nTarja Soile Susanna Turunen-Cabuli (born 17 August 1977), known professionally as Tarja Turunen or simply Tarja, is a Finnish heavy metal singer, best known as the former lead vocalist of Nightwish. Turunen studied lyrical singing at Sibelius Academy and Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe. She is a professional classical lied singer with a three-octave vocal range, and founded symphonic metal band Nightwish with Tuomas Holopainen and Emppu Vuorinen in 1996. Their combination of hard and fast guitar riffs with Turunen's dramatic, \"operatic\" lead vocals quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity. Their symphonic metal style, soon dubbed \"opera metal\", inspired many other metal bands and performers. Turunen was fired from the band on 21 October 2005 (just after the performance of the band's End of an Era concert) for personal reasons accompanied by an open letter from the band. She started her solo career in 2006 with the release of a Christmas album called Henkäys ikuisuudesta. In 2007, Turunen released My Winter Storm, an album featuring various styles including symphonic metal, and started the Storm World Tour. She performed several concerts in Europe, playing in metal festivals including the Graspop Metal Meeting and the Wacken Open Air, before releasing her third album, What Lies Beneath, supported by a tour, which lasted until April 2012. Her first live DVD Act I was filmed during this tour on 30 and 31 March 2012 in Argentina. Act I was released in August 2012. Turunen started the Colours in the Dark World Tour in October 2013 to promote her new album Colours in the Dark. Her second live DVD was filmed during the events of Beauty and the Beat with Mike Terrana and was released in May. In September 2015, Tarja Turunen released her first classical studio album, Ave Maria – En Plein Air. In August 2016 she released her sixth studio album The Shadow Self, with a prequel EP The Brightest Void released on 3 June. On 17 November 2017, she released her second Christmas album, From Spirits and Ghosts, putting a dark orchestral twist on various classic holiday songs.

Matti Salminen (b. 1945 )\n\nWith an HPI of 49.64 , Matti Salminen is the 6th most famous Finnish Singer . His biography has been translated into 16 different languages.\n\nMatti Kalervo Salminen (born 7 July 1945) is a Finnish operatic bass, now retired, who has sung at the most important opera houses of the world, including the Metropolitan and Bayreuth Festival. He is distinguished by an imposing figure and height (6' 5\"), a cavernous, heavy, dark voice with an expansive upper register, and an expressive face. According to one reviewer, in his prime Salminen was \"... simply the largest bass voice in captivity. It is not just its roar in powering over Wagner's maximum orchestra, but the way he carves the sonority and forms the color.\" Salminen has a special gift for playing menacing, threatening characters. He performed as Fafner and Hagen in the PBS video broadcast Ring Cycle from the Metropolitan Opera, for the largest viewing-audience of the Ring in history.\n\n8 . Lasse Mårtenson ( 1934 - 2016 )\n\nWith an HPI of 48.39 , Lasse Mårtenson is the 8th most famous Finnish Singer .
