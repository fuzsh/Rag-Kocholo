        "text": "At the change of the year is quite often a time to plan the future little bit and maybe set some goals for the new year. It is also time to look back and create a full picture of all the things you have done last year.\n\nIn 2021 my blog posts have been little bit different. At one point I thought I don’t have any more ideas for this blog but somehow I got back on the track of monthly postings. But that is the whole idea for me to right this blog: I like writing and I want to share my thoughts about all music related stuff. If I don’t have any ideas, I might just as well end this blog.\n\n2021 I played only one concert for a live audience. I’m already getting used to having less performance but realizing this was interesting. It was our concert in Loimaa with Brahms and the project took longer than expected because of the COVID. Although it is sometimes good to give time for a big piece to simmer, I felt like I needed something new to play as well when I was preparing for the concert.\n\nI decided to start practicing one quite big piece that I have been playing little bit but never had that much time and energy to really start practicing it properly. Already in last autumn I made plan. The piece has ten pages. What if I have one year time and I practice one page every month?\n\nOne year is my goal since my study leave period is going to end in September and I am going back to work in the Navy Band. Before that I don’t have any plans for concerts. I need to relax a bit before planning to organize any concerts by myself and I believe during these uncertain times no one will even ask me to play to any concerts.\n\nI have struggled to find motivation for practicing alone without a goal. Now I have a clear plan, not too overwhelming but still interesting enough. I am not sure if I ever will get a chance to perform this piece I am now practicing but I don’t mind. Perhaps when the chance comes, there wouldn’t be time to start practicing it from the start.\n\nAnd what is that piece? Well, I won’t tell you now. You will hear about it later. So now it is time for me to turn the next page for this month.\n\nHave an excellent year 2022!\n\nIn English below.\n\nKaikilla on kiire. Lava on vielä sekaisin. Vien telineen ja nuotit, mutta unohdin korvatulpat. Juoksen hakemaan niitä. Lava on niin kirkkaasti valaistu, että valojen takana on vain mustaa. Kapellimestarin hahmo on hämäränä edessä. Nyt pitäisi olla jo valmista. Ensimmäinen kappale alkaa. Kuulostaa kamalalta. Soitetaan kahdessa eri sävellajissa. Meillä on väärä versio. Seuraava kappale pitäisi alkaa, ei tiedetä mikä se on. Tajuan, että ollaan asetuttu väärinpäin lavalle. Kappale alkaa ja yritän tunnistaa sen ja etsiä oikeita nuotteja. Meneekö tämä koko ajan livenä telkkariin?\n\nHerään. On vasta 21.5. ja harjoituksiakaan ei vielä ole ollut. Ihmekös tuo, että uni muuttui painajaiseksi. Taidan hieman jännittää 4.6. tulevaa televisioitavaa konserttiamme.\n\nMaaliskuun puolivälissä tuli tieto, joka pysäytti tavanomaisen työskentelymme Laivaston soittokunnassa kuin seinään. Tämä kevät jää varmasti kaikille mieleen hyvin erilaisena aikana. Kaikki esiintymiset peruttiin, mutta muutos sai liikkeelle uudet ajatukset. Käytimme ajan hyödyksi muun muassa soittokunnan nuotiston siivoamiseen ja järjestelemiseen. Se oli urakka, jota ei muiden töiden ohessa olisi ehtinyt tekemään näin nopeasti ja intensiivisellä tahdilla. Toteutimme myös videoprojektin ja pienyhtyeet ovat esiintyneet pienimuotoisissa tilaisuuksissa.\n\nKun tuli tieto, että 1.6. kokoontumisrajoituksia muutetaan, saimme varmistuksen sille, että voimme toteuttaa ensimmäisen koko soittokunnan esiintymisen. Tosin vielä ilman yleisöä, joten miksi ei sitten suoraan livenä TV:ssä ja radiossa sekä Yle Areenassa koko kansan nähtäväksi.\n\nMitä tämä pari kuukautta sitten on tuonut mukanaan? Suurin osa on päässyt kokemaan etätyöskentelyä kotona. Harjoittelu ei ehkä ole ollut joka päivä niin tehokasta, ja minulla ainakin vaikuttaa hyvin paljon se, että mitä varten harjoittelee. Silloin kun on paljon ohjelmistoa harjoiteltavana, saattaa haaveilla ajasta, jolloin voisi soittaa ihan mitä vain haluaa. Nyt tähän tarjoutui tilaisuus, mutta kun kappaleelle ei ole esiintymishetkeä, ei siihen panostakaan aivan täysillä. Opiskellessa harjoitteli soittotunneille ja nykyään motivaatio löytyy esiintymisten kautta. Heti kun sain tämän konsertin nuotit käsiini, aloin harjoitella paljon tehokkaammin. Kai sitä muusikko sitten kuitenkin soittaa esiintyäkseen muille, eikä vain omaksi ilokseen.\n\nToinen asia, minkä olen huomannut on, että päässäni soi aivan omituisia lauluja ja useita viikkoja. Ensimmäisenä ilmestyi Loreen ja Euphoria, jopa niin intensiivisesti, että päätin soittaa sitä klarinetilla, jos se olisi lähtenyt pois. Ei auttanut. Toinen kappale, joka oli päässäni useita päiviä oli Mirandan Vamos ala playa, joka sattui tulemaan auton radiosta. Piti jopa tarkistaa kertosäkeen sanat espanjaksi, jotta voin laulaa päässäni soivaa kappaletta. Minun teoria tähän liittyen on se, että yleensä päässäni soivat ja aivojeni kapasiteettia kuluttavat ohjelmistossa olevat kappaleet. Hyräilen hyvin usein jotain mitä olen juuri harjoitellut paljon. Aivoni siis käsittelevät ja harjoittelevat kappaleita, vaikka en niitä juuri soitakaan. Kutsun tätä korvamato-vaiheeksi harjoittelussa. Silloin musiikki alkaa olla sen verran tuttua ja sitä on toistanut sen verran paljon, että pystyy hyvin toistamaan sitä, vaikka tekisi jotain aivan muuta. Siitä en tiedä, tapahtuuko tätä kaikilla ihmisillä tai muilla muusikoilla kuinka yleisesti. Nyt kuitenkin huomaan, että olen päässyt eroon noista kahdesta mieleni vallanneesta kappaleesta ja tällä hetkellä tilan täyttää tulevan konsertin ohjelmisto. Ilmeisesti vähentynyt keskittynyt harjoittelu aiheutti aivoissa tyhjää tilaa, jonka nämä pari hittiä täyttivät.\n\n27.5. päästiin harjoittelemaan ensimmäistä kertaa puupuhaltajien kanssa yhdessä tämän parin kuukauden jälkeen. Täytyy myöntää, että hieman jännittikin soittaa taas muiden kuullen, mutta oli myös virkistävää kuulla muutakin kuin omaa yksinäistä soittamista. Eilen koko orkesteri kokoontui yhteen samaan tilaan soittamaan. Tavallaan tuntuu myös siltä, kun tulisi takaisin paikkaan, jossa ei ole pitkään aikaan käynyt, mutta silti mikään ei tunnu muuttuneen.\n\nOn ollut ihanaa huomata, että samalla, kun joutuu pohtimaan uudelleen mitä kaikkea on voinut tehdä ja mitä ei, niin kevät on edennyt vakaasti kohti kesää. Olemme saaneet nauttia upeista aurinkoisista päivistä ja muutoinkin tilanne näyttää jo lupaavammalta. Laivaston soittokunnan kesä jatkuu tästä mahdollisuuksien mukaan ja ainakin Merivoimien vuosipäivään 9.7. osallistutaan jollain tavoin.\n\nMinä pääsen myös vihdoin ensi viikonloppuna Helsinkiin harjoittelemaan Neue Quartetin kanssa kevään osalta peruuntunutta Brahmsin klarinettikvintettoa. Syksylle suunnitellut konserttipäivät ovat Helsingissä 25.10. ja Raisiossa 1.11.\n\nTässä vielä linkki 4.6. konserttiin Yle Areenassa.\n\nNautitaan kesästä!\n\nEveryone is busy running back and forth. The stage is a mess. I bring my note stand and notes on the stage but I realize that I forgot my ear plugs. I run off stage to pick them up. There is so bright light that everything else looks black except the stage. I can see the figure of a conductor. Everything should be ready by now. The first peace is starting. It sounds terrible. We play in two different keys. Some of us have a wrong version. The next peace should start but I don’t know what it is. I also notice that we are standing on the wrong position in the stage. The playing begins and I try to listen and recognize it and find the right notes. Is this really going live on TV all the time?\n\nI wake up. It is only the 21st of May and we still have plenty of time before the live TV concert on the 4th of June. We did’t even have had any rehearsals yet. I might be little nervous and excited about our coming concert since my dreams turn into nightmares about work.\n\nIn mid March we got the information that changed everything. Our concerts in the Navy Band were cancelled until the end of May and pretty much all the normal work was cancelled as well. I believe everyone will remember this spring as a very different times. But we didn’t stay standing still but had to figure out new things we could do at work. One of my dreams came true when we finally had time to organize the whole music library. We had planned it for couple of years already but among the normal working days there was just not enough time to make it happen. We also made a video project and smaller groups have performed in some small events.\n\nAfter we got the information that starting from the 1st of June it is allowed to gather together with 50 people groups our band got busy with planning a concert. Of course it is still too early to bring the audience with us and for the 4th of June we already had a parade planned that was going to be on TV. So we decided to keep the time but change everything else and we created plan of a live concert with great Finnish singers. And since it is on TV and in the online service, the whole world can watch it live or later.\n\nSo what has happened during these two and half months? Most of us has got the experience of working remotely at home. My practicing hasn’t been that efficient every day but I think it is because I need a certain goal for my playing. Sometimes we have so much to practice that I have dreamed about time to practice whatever I want and with no hurry. Now I got this wonderful opportunity but I have to admit that when there is no pressure for performing the peace I also don’t focus that much on what I am playing. When I was studying I always had lessons where I would have to play for the teacher and nowadays the motivation comes from performing. As soon as I got the material for this coming concert my practicing got so much more efficient and enthusiastic. Perhaps as a musician I just play to perform for other people and not just for my own fun.\n\nThe other thing I noticed is that my head is full of unusual songs for many weeks. The first one was Loreen and Euphoria from Eurovision song contest. It was so intensive that I decided to play it with the clarinet and hoped that it would get out of my mind this way. Well, it didn’t but now I can play it. The second song was Miranda and Vamos ala playa that I happened to hear in the car radio. After humming to song for quite long time I even checked the right lyrics in Spanish for the chorus so I can sing it properly. My theory for this is that when I practice some program for work these songs begin to play inside my head. I hum quite a lot things I have just practiced so it means my brain is still working with the music even I am not playing or thinking about it. I call it ”ear-worming”. It is a phase where the peace that you are practicing is getting familiar enough that your brain is automatically playing it. I don’t know if other people face the same thing or how usual it is among the musicians. I just believe that since I didn’t have so many things to practice with good concentration my brain filled with just anything I heard. Now that I began to practice this coming concert songs I have been freed from Loreen and Miranda and I’ve been humming again my clarinet parts.\n\nOn 27th of May we practiced together with wood winds for the first time after two months. I was little nervous to play while other people were hearing me play again. But it was also refreshing to hear other people play together with me. Yesterday the whole band was together in a rehearsal. It feels like when you have been away for some time and then come back and it first seems like nothing has changed.\n\nAt the same time we have to think how we can protect ourselves and people around us it has been lovely to follow the spring turn into summer. There have been beautiful sunny days and summer gives at least little bit of hope of things changing towards more active social life. The summer with the Navy Band will form within the possibilities but for sure we will have something on 9th of June when it is the Finnish Navy Anniversary.\n\nNext weekend I will also finally travel to Helsinki to practice with Neue Quartet for our coming Bridge & Brahsm concerts. We had to cancel both concerts from this spring but we have booked new days for coming autumn. We will perform in Helsinki on 25th of October and in Raisio on 1st of November.\n\nAnd here is the link to see our 4th of June Navy Band concert in Yle Areena!\n\nLet’s enjoy the summer!\n\nIn April we got a task for making a video of our playing. The plan was to make a video collage of one peace, where every player plays their part. You can see the final video here. Our job was to film and record our playing at home and send it for editing.\n\nI was thrilled about this assigment as I like to work with this kind of things like making short videos and edit them and record music. So I decided to have fun and also make a blog post documentary for you about the making of my part for this video.\n\nThe biggest challenge for me was to make one clean shot. I knew it already before I started. For some reason it is really difficult for me to play without any mistakes from the beginning until the end. As soon as I push the record button my brains goes really wild and thinks about a lot of other things than just playing. It happens also when I play music by heart. It makes me nervous but I have been practicing it for years. Luckily this time I had to focus only about 3 minutes.\n\nI can only try to make myself calm and force my thoughts on the notes that I am playing at that moment. Trying to shut down anything else from my mind. I haven’t done very often professional recordings but I imagine that they usually record many takes and then edit the best bits together. Also for example in movies I think you need to get one line correct at the time and they can edit it all together. So compared to that this was a bit more demanding.\n\nIn a theatre play or live concerts there is no change to repeat as it happens in the moment. So if something goes wrong there is nothing you can do but just move on. And somehow I think people maybe don’t even remember or hear all the mistakes. But in a recording you can go back and you have a chance to fix it again.\n\nMy task was to play the second clarinet and the alto clarinet parts. I took about 5 takes of them both until I thought it was as good as I can do. The best part of this project was turning my home office room into a ”studio”. I decided to play with all the equipments I have and also test their quality.\n\nThe idea was that we got a playback audio track that was taken from the scorewriter program. From that audio we got the tempo and the tuning for our playing but we had to have headphones for that. I used my JBL Reflect Mini Bluetooth Sport in-ear Headphones. I played the track from my laptop since I could also film with the web camera and listen the track at the same time. My headphones has a play button so I could remotely press play when I was already seated in my place. I also could adjust the volume with other two buttons.\n\nFor recording the sound in WAV format I used my Roland R-05 which is pretty old but I think it is still working quite well. It is by the way the only device using old fashioned AA batteries. I have been thinking I should buy a power supply to make it more reliable during recording longer concerts or rehearsals but for this project I could check the battery level between the takes and shut the power off when I was checking how my playing was on the laptop.\n\nI tested my Asus Notebooks web camera for the first time for recording things since this laptop is quite new. I think the quality was not as good as I expected but it was a good back up and it was the fastest way to check my recording afterwards.\n\nThe best video quality was in my digital camera Canon PowerShot SX200 IS. I set it on a mini-tripod on my table. I mainly have taken pictures with this camera but even the sound quality wasn’t too bad. The problem with this camera was that I have such a small memory card and I could film only one take at the time and then I had to move it to my computer before taking another shot. I also felt I had to be careful with light or otherwise the film would burn white in some parts.\n\nI made the third video with my phone Nokia 6. I attached the phone on a Samsung vehicle dock and on a mirror so I got a video angle from above me as well. I used this dock earlier for filming a time lapse of my drawing. For some reason the dock fell of couple of times if I let it stay there for a long time. So I had a pillow underneath just in case but luckily it didn’t fall when I was filming.\n\nAlso a note to myself: when filming or recording, turn your phone on the airplane mode. I forgot to do it but I was again lucky that no one tried to reach me during filming. On my lunch break I realized to put a silent mode on but after filming I found out that Whatsapp calls come through anyway!\n\nI also used my wake up light alarm clock for the back-lighting. It has a very bright but not direct light. But at the end I had very sunny filming days so I don’t know if it helped at all.\n\nSo anything can happen while you are filming. As I was nervous about getting my playing right I wanted to be sure that I for sure got at least one recording of it saved every time. Imagine if you for once played perfectly and later find out that the only camera you had is turned off with low battery or full memory. Or the files can get corrupted. I don’t know if I had that much experience that I checked everything before but this time I didn’t have huge technical problems.\n\nThe first day of filming began in the morning with a make up and fixing my hair since I am a woman and I want to look nice in front of the camera. It is about being presentable and if it gets my mood up I think it is perfectly fine. Also I try to create kind of neutral make up so it doesn’t look like full glam make up or a theatrical mask.\n\nThen I let the cat outside on our terrace so she wouldn’t get too much bothered and had a little warm up and practicing session. Then time for the uniform and I was ready. For the first day I decided to record the second clarinet part. After the first take I used quite a lot time to check that everything was working. I made second take and then had lunch.\n\nAfter lunch I changed the set up a bit and felt that the white background was working better. I had time to do few more takes. After a while it gets more difficult to focus and I was also listening and comparing the takes. Finally I decided to stop working for that day.\n\nThe second day began with little bit of editing the files I was going to send. I basically just trimmed the the beginning and the end where I move around in the room. I used Audacity for trimming the audio file and OpenShot Video Editor the video. I ended up liking the second take of the second clarinet part the best but I found out that the video set up was better in the last one. So I thought maybe I could combine them since it is played with the same track. It worked quite well when I added the audio file on the video project. I just had to sync them. For that purpose there has been added hand claps on the score in the beginning. Everyone claps their hands or make other click for four beats and that is the way they can edit them all together. The hand claps will be cut away from the final video. After I got my video and audio in sync I turned off the volume of the video and it looks quite realistic to my eye.\n\nWhile exporting the video files I got time to put some make up on and fix my hair again. Then I practiced for a while with the alto clarinet that is a very strange instrument for me. I think I made couple of takes before having lunch but this time I didn’t check them in between. I wanted to be little bit faster with filming so I only moved the file from my Canon to my laptop before continuing. After lunch I checked if the videos were fine but I had to take couple of more takes before I felt it was good enough. This time I only trimmed the begging and the end of the files and I was ready to share them. After my part was done I just waited for the final product.\n\nFor many people this strange period of time has changed their way of working. I liked this kind of challenge and a new experience with my job. I think before we wouldn’t have time or need to create something like this.\n\nI hope you all stay well and safe and maybe discover also something new in your lives!\n\nThese times reminds me of a TV series called The Tribe I watched when I was a teenager. In that science fiction drama series the world faced a terrible virus and all adults died and only young people survived. And they had to figure out how to live in the world. It feels like that. Like this is fiction and not happening for real.\n\nIn my lifetime I have never experienced anything like this before. I bet not many of us have. In one day the news changed everything that was planned. It feels even today hard to believe that this is true. I think that hey, maybe let’s wait a bit and see how it goes. Two months is a long time. But I guess I am all wrong. And we have to do as it is told us to do and trust the wise orders of the authorities.\n\nAll our concerts and public performances of the Finnish Navy Band are cancelled until the end of May. Also Brahms concerts I wrote about in my last blog post are cancelled for this spring. I have mixed feelings. Brahms was something I had spent so much time for organizing and practicing. I was so happy that I was going to do it finally. But I guess I just have to wait a bit more. But at the same time I am luckily not the one to make these decisions. I feel it is not my fault everything is cancelled as it would be if only I was just unable to play.\n\nI feel very sad for freelance workers. I could be one. Everything they planned is gone and how are they going to survive this spring if they don’t get paid. Also the time they have used for preparing things. Like athletes too. They have been preparing for competitions and now they don’t know what will be next. I really hope something new comes out of this all. Let the creativity show.\n\nFor me this means that I am still working although I don’t know what will be next. It is advised to stay at home for work but should I practice this program we were going to have or something else? I’m confused. I feel lack of motivation to take my instrument and work with it. Just few days ago I was frustrated that I won’t have enough time to learn everything for the next concert. Now I would have time but why I feel so much apathy. Maybe there is a little bit of relief too. I get a tiny break from this stress I have been experiencing at work. We did many big concerts in such a short period that I felt nothing was ready. On the other hand, now that I have been at home for couple of days I feel a very strong need to work and be useful somehow. For a short term it might be nice to have a bit slower times but I do like to get up in the mornings and go to work.\n\nI guess because of the stress I had there was one event just before everything was cancelled. I think I know now how Arthur Dent felt in Douglas Adams’s book called The Hitch-Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy when he first had to witness how his own house was demolished to make room for a bypass and just after this loss he experiences the whole world being destroyed in front of his eyes to make room for an intergalactic superhighway. What is a house compared to a planet?\n\nIt happened when I first I lost my temper after finding out that suddenly there was a gig at work planned over the Brahms concert in Loimaa. I thought it is so annoying to change everything and I will in a way betray the string quartet, the people I had asked to work with me. But soon came the bigger news and cancellation of all events in Finland. This time I didn’t react that much. I felt numb. And my reaction just a day before felt very ridiculous. It felt like actually it doesn’t matter at all. If I have a concert or not, what does it change? Despite all of this the world is still here.\n\nMusic is in a way important to people but actually it is not necessary for living. It is weird when you begin to think about how many unimportant things people do in their lives and for what they use their time, energy and money. At the same time there have always been some bigger problems. Why we don’t try to fix them? It is for sure true that we have to do something to earn our living but what is enough? And what do we really need and what we don’t need? Maybe this time is also for thinking about what is truly important and if we could be happier with less.\n\nLet’s help each other and enjoy of all we already have.\n\nWho wouldn’t like to live in a perfect balance with their body and mind? But I guess it is not very easy to find that place. Many people are seeking for it as it also shows in countless advertisements about making your life so much better with this or that.\n\nSo in a way I guess pain and being unbalanced is part of everyone’s life at some point and with different amounts. For me this year has been quite good at the end but I also had to deal with quite a lot of things.\n\nAs someone might know I have been having some problems with my right wrist in the past years. There was one really cold and windy day in March. I was outside and just a short moment without my mittens made my hands all stiff from the coldness. I also had to clean that day and then make some food from frozen fish. All these combined together made my hand react and the next day it was a bit swollen.\n\nIt started just like that also earlier so I got an appointment for a doctor in a week and then visited blood tests and x-ray later. There was nothing. After this I visited a hand specialist in April. She wrote me a covering for MRI. I had to wait the time until the end of the May.\n\nThis time I felt that they wanted to check everything what they didn’t do couple of years ago. That time I had to stay out of work for 2 or 3 weeks because the pain was so bad and I couldn’t do anything with my right hand. This year the situation wasn’t so bad but I guess this history had an effect. At the same time I felt frustrated that every time I met some one to see how my wrist is, then on that day it wasn’t actually hurting. I had to describe how it had been. I already know, the time is the best healer in this case. If there is no straining for the hand, it will slowly recover. But on the other hand, it will also easily get worse if it doesn’t get enough time to recover.\n\nI also had a meeting with Musapoli in April that is a group of medical professionals who are interested in helping musicians with their problems. They saw that the way I have to hold my instrument is not very good at all. They suggested me to try to find some other supports for my hand. And one of them actually found one thumb rest for a clarinet or an oboe (Ton Kooiman). I haven’t seen that one before and got very interested. Of course they didn’t have it here in the music shop and they promised to order it. It was going to take couple of days but after two weeks of waiting I called back and they had forgot about it. So the summer was coming when I finally got the rest. But I had to wait until after the holidays because our instruments in the band got a maintenance and repair during our holidays. So they also attached the thumb rest for my work instrument.\n\nOf course summer meant a lot of gigs outside. I was also playing the bass clarinet and during one rehearsal I got pain in my wrist again. I called again for an appointment for a doctor. This time I got a covering for physiotherapist. Earlier I had heard about one who knows about hand problems and booked a time. We saw the results of the MRI together in the database. For that I had an appointment coming in August. The physiotherapist saw that I had used my hand in an unbalanced way and gave me few exercises. I visited her another time as well and later one other physiotherapist.\n\nIn August I visited a doctor about the MRI and the result was kind of OK. Nothing is broken which is good news but it doesn’t really explain why my hand gets so irritated some times. They could see very tiny ganglion but it made me understand the pain more. I think when I strain my wrist or it gets too much cold it will get some fluids that make it swollen too. They pack together forming this ganglion which will be bigger when there is more fluids. That also prevents my wrist from moving in normal range. I actually just heard that someone had these also inside ankles and they were removed with surgeon. He had problems with running and other exercise. So hopefully this helped him. I guess I don’t need to go under the knife.\n\nI also got a wrist brace to wear during the night time. People tend to roll their wrists during the night while sleeping and especially when there is some issues with the hands. So the brace will help the hand be in right and relaxed position. I think this also helped and I have used it for couple of months. Now I actually have forgot to use it for some time so I think it is also a good sign that my hand doesn’t feel like it needs it.\n\nAfter the summer holiday I got back to work and got to try the new thumb rest. It felt very good right from the beginning. Before that I was using a strap around my neck. I have two different kinds of them. The first is flexible and the other one not. I liked the not flexible one while we are playing outside and marching and the flexible one with indoor concerts while sitting down. With this new thumb rest I can’t use any strap in the right way. So I have to hold the all weight on my hand but after a while it didn’t feel so bad after a while. And just when I thought this new thumb rest is very good I noticed that it doesn’t stay on it’s place and I had to send it back to get better attached on the clarinet.\n\nWhen the autumn came I wanted to start practicing for our muscle power tests. Otherwise I didn’t have problems but we have to do push ups as well. With the normal way of doing it the wrists are in about 90 degrees angle and have a lot of weight on. This is too much for my right wrist and I can’t really practice it without making my hand hurt more. For this I got a solution with push up handles. Using them I can keep my wrist in the straight position and it doesn’t hurt at all.\n\nI have been going to gym for about one year quite regularly. Even I feel that I am not that much more powerful than when I began I feel that it makes a difference. Somehow this work out makes my body feel more relaxed and it helps with mood too. The effect is very dramatic on lazy and dark days. Now that winter is here again and it makes me so tired, some activity in the gym will energize me completely. I also believe that giving this impulse for my body that it has to work and use the muscles will keep it in good shape and I can handle more playing the clarinet that is quite passive activity for the body.\n\nI have also been running this year. I did the Cooper test in the spring and didn’t practice for it almost at all. Anyway I made a better result than last year so I was very happy. There is some improvements going on. We also did 38 km trail running competition in August. It was a pretty rough running for me. We didn’t know about the time limit of 6 hours before closer the competition. So I really had to push and the pace was just too much for me. But we made it until the crease even little bit over time.\n\nAfter this I didn’t feel like running for couple of weeks. Instead I played some Finnish Base Ball with a lady group. It was quite fun change. But I wasn’t very good and actually didn’t even have interest to get better at this sports. Now I’ve been getting back to running routine but it was not easy after a while. For some reason my knee started hurting when I was running but not when walking and the pain went away quite soon after runs. I’ve tried to give massage for my legs and all over my body and stretching is also very important.\n\nI also got a new bed recently so my body is reacting to that very strongly. I have had good nights and bad nights where I had to change to sleep on the couch because my back was hurting so much. I guess the reason why I write this is to notice this all. The human body is very complicated combination and all our activities have an effect on how it feels. There will be injuries and accidents or sometimes we strain our body with what we do. For me the sports have become very important part of preventing and giving relief for my aches. It also give me energy and positive vibes so I don’t worry too much and feel that powerless.\n\nAnd finally, I kind of believe that pains and aches are part of being alive. We just have to deal with them and be happy for those days we are not hurting.\n\nI’m actually happy to announce that I have two cool projects going on at the moment that I will present to you next year. Both of them I have wished for quite long time and now they both are finally happening. So have a nice and hopefully pain free rest of the year and I will be back in 2020!"
