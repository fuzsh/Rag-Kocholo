        "text": "The ninth edition of the Eurovision Song Contest took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, after the duo Grethe & JÃ¸rgen Ingmann won with the song Dansevise the previous year. This was the first time the contest took place in Denmark, and the first time a Nordic country had hosted the contest. The contest was held at Tivolis Koncertsal on Saturday the 21st of March. There was a solo presenter for the contest, and that was Lotte WÃ¦ver.\n\nA total of sixteen nations participated, including Portugal who made their debut at the contest. No nations returned to the contest, however Sweden withdrew. The voting consisted of ten-member juries who each assigned points to their top three songs. The points were totalled, and the top three placed songs within that nationâ€™s jury were then assigned the top three points, which were 5, 3 and 1 point.\n\nUnfortunately, no complete video recording of the contest survived. There is a complete audio recording of the contest in the form of the DR radio broadcast. Some clips still exist, including part of the opening ceremony and opening remarks. Majority of the winnerâ€™s reprise also still exists. Allegedly, the tapes were destroyed in a fire in the 1970â€™s, but more recent interviews with the host broadcaster DR reveal that the broadcast was not recorded in the first place, due to the lack of tape machines at the venue.\n\nHere is the full list of participating countries:\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nDenmark\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nItaly\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMonaco\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPortugal\n\nSpain\n\nSwitzerland\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nYugoslavia\n\nThere was just one returning artist, and that was Anita Traversi who previously represented Switzerland back in 1960.\n\nHere are the competitors:\n\nHugues Aufray â€“ DÃ¨s que le printemps revient (Luxembourg) ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡º\n\nAnneke GrÃ¶nloh â€“ Jij bent mijn leven (Netherlands) ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±\n\nArne Bendiksen â€“ Spiral (Norway) ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´\n\nBjÃ¸rn Tidmand â€“ Sangen om dig (Denmark) ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°\n\nLasse MÃ¥rtenson â€“ Laiskotellen (Finland) ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®\n\nUdo JÃ¼rgens â€“ Warum nur, warum? (Austria) ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹\n\nRachel â€“ Le Chant de Mallory (France) ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·\n\nMatt Monro â€“ I Love The Little Things (United Kingdom) ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§\n\nNora Nova â€“ Man gewÃ¶hnt sich so schnell an das SchÃ¶ne (Germany) ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª\n\nRomuald â€“ OÃ¹ song-elles passes (Monaco) ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¨\n\nAntÃ³nio CalvÃ¡rio â€“ OraÃ§Ã£o (Portugal) ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹\n\nGigliola Cinquetti â€“ Non ho lâ€™etÃ  (Italy) ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹\n\nSabahudin Kurt â€“ Å½ivot je sklopio krug (Yugoslavia)\n\nAnita Traversi â€“ I Miei Pensieri (Switzerland) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­\n\nRobert Cogoi â€“ PrÃ¨s de ma riviÃ¨re (Belgium) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª\n\nLos TNT â€“ Caracola (Spain) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸\n\nThe winner of the contest was Italy, with Gigliola Cinquetti and her song, Non ho lâ€™etÃ . Italy won the contest with a very convincing margin, with 49 points in total. In second place was the United Kingdom, who received just 17 points. In third was Monaco who received 15 points.\n\nA total of four nations received nul points, including Portugal on their debut at the contest. Switzerland, Yugoslavia and Germany also joined Portugal with nul points.\n\nWatch the winning performance below:"
