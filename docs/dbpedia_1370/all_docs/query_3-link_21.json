        "text": "Popular Music and Political Liberalization in the Eastern Bloc\n\nDean Vuletic\n\nAbstract: During the Cold War, Eastern Bloc broadcasting organizations held the Intervision Song Contest (ISC) as an alternative to Western Europe’s Eurovision Song Contest (ESC). Staged in Czechoslovakia and Poland between 1964 and 1980, the ISC has usually been depicted in the popular media as merely a belated, fleeting copy of the ESC, with the ISC’s failure being a metaphor for the decline of the economic and political systems of communist party‐led Eastern Europe. However, unlike with the ESC, there has been little academic research on the ISC. This chapter is based on archival sources from national and international broadcasting organizations, and focuses on the first series of the ISC in Czechoslovakia. It argues that the ISC was conceived by its organizers as a pan-European event that would promote cooperation between the Eastern and Western Blocs, especially in the context of Khrushchev’s Thaw and the cultural and political liberalization in Czechoslovakia that culminated in the Prague Spring. The ISC’s organizers accordingly introduced innovations that made their contest more internationally open and commercial than the ESC. Furthermore, the staging of the ISC in Czechoslovakia underlined the limits of the Soviet Union’s cultural and political influence over Eastern Europe and the role that geopolitics played in the power relations between states within the Eastern Bloc. The ISC was, then, not simply an imitation of the ESC, but rather a product of international political relations that tells us much about the aspirations that some Eastern European artists, politicians, and officials from record companies and television stations had for the democratization of their states.\n\nThe traditional controversies that accompany the voting results in every edition of the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC), one of the world’s longest running and most‐watched television programs, are widely infamous. As I demonstrate in my book Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest, the first‐ever academic monograph on the history of the ESC, such controversies have marked the contest ever since its first edition in 1956. In that year, the Swiss jury allegedly cast the deciding vote that brought Switzerland’s entry “Refrain” (sung by Lys Assia) victory in that contest, which was staged in the Swiss city of Lugano. The Swiss jury did so after it voted in place of the Luxembourgish jury, whose members were not able to travel to Lugano to participate in the voting. Since then, voting blocs based on commercial, cultural, geographical, linguistic, and even political connections have been a perennial feature of the ESC.1 These blocs have been especially controversial since the 1990s, following the entry of states from the former Eastern Bloc and the incorporation of public voting into the contest. In 2009, in response to accusations made mostly by officials from West European national broadcasting organizations that Central and East European public audiences were exacerbating the problem of bloc voting, the public voting component in the final voting results was reduced to fifty percent, with the other half being determined by national expert juries made up of professionals from the music industry. The participation of East European states in the ESC has also been controversial in the post-Cold War era for the involvement of authoritarian governments, such as those of Azerbaijan and Russia. There, the participation of government‐controlled national broadcasting organizations in the contest and their hosting of the event, such as in Moscow in 2009 and Baku in 2012, has been used to whitewash the international images of these governments.2\n\nCriticisms of Central and East European participants in the ESC by West European commentators have also reflected suspicion over the impact that the integration of states from this region could have on pan-European organizations—not only on the ESC and its organizer, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), but also, more significantly, on the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).3 Yet, these criticisms have highlighted a longer history of West European cultural prejudices against Central and East Europe, prejudices that have considered the latter region to have been, throughout history, inherently more illiberal, poor, and unmodern than its Western counterpart.4 Such engrained prejudices have also appeared in popular documentaries and literature that have discussed the popular music industry in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. This has been the case with regard to the Intervision Song Contest (ISC), the Eastern Bloc alternative to the ESC that was staged in Czechoslovakia from 1965 to 1968 and in Poland from 1977 to 1980. As the ISC has received little scholarly attention,5 it has been clichédly presented in popular media as a fake, feeble, and fleeting, a censored, communist, and controlled, imitation of the ESC.6 This approach has ignored the connections and similarities between the popular music industries in Eastern Europe and Western Europe in the Cold War era; it has also blinded an understanding of the ISC that is counterintuitive to stereotypical interpretations of the Eastern Bloc as being backward, closed, and homogenous. Indeed, in my archival research on the ISC that I conducted in the archives of the national broadcasting organizations of the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Russia, and Slovakia, I discovered that the contest rather promoted cultural and commercial cooperation between the Eastern and Western Blocs in the 1960s and the 1970s, in light of diplomatic transformations such as the Thaw and the Helsinki Accords. The ISC was the product of liberalization processes in the Eastern Bloc, namely the cultural, economic, and political reforms in the 1960s that accompanied de-Stalinization in Czechoslovakia and culminated in the Prague Spring, or those in Poland in the 1970s that were enacted by the government of Edward Gierek. The ISC’s fate in both states was also determined by the ending of these periods of liberalization. Focusing on the first series of the ISC in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s, this chapter will examine what the history of the ISC tells us about the aspirations of Eastern European artists, politicians, and the representatives of record companies and television stations, for the political liberalization of the communist party‐led systems in their states, and about the cultural and economic ramifications of liberalizing reforms."
