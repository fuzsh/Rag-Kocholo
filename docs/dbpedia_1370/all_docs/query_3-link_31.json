        "text": "For some reason 1958 was another non-entry but the U.K. have competed every year since. Lys Assia from Switzerland won the first contest with 'Refrain', beating Belgium's 'The Drowned Men Of The River Seine'. The following year the contest was held in Frankfurt-Am-Maine and the UK entered for the first time with Patricia Bredin singing 'All', a composition which lasted less than two minutes and came 7th. The winning song, by Corry Brokken of The Netherlands, lasted 4 minutes 30 seconds!\n\nIn 1962 a three-minute time limit was set on entries. There is no restriction imposed on the nationality of the performers or songwriters performing for each country and current rules state that a maximum of six performers are permitted on the stage.\n\nThe UK did not compete in 1958 when the third-placed Italian song was released in a re-titled English version as 'Volare' and became the first Eurovision song to make the British pop charts. The 1958 winner was Andre Claveau of France, with 'Sleep, My Love'. The UK bounced back in 1959, with the legendary Pearl Carr and Teddy Johnson performing 'Sing Little Birdie' which was narrowly beaten by The Netherlands' Een Beetje. France's entry, 'Oui Oui Oui Oui', was only a single point further back in third place.\n\nFud Leclerc, a Belgian singer who represented his country no less than four times, was the first person to score 'nil points' in the competition, achieving this notorious feat in 1962 with a song called 'Ton Nom' ('Your Name'), an entry with a tune that bore little relation to the orchestral accompaniment. He had first represented Belgium in the inaugural Eurovision Song Contest of 1956 with 'Messieurs les noyés de la Seine' ('The drowned men of the Seine') and returned to the Eurovision stage in 1958 with the somewhat more happily titled 'Ma Petite Chatte' ('My Little Sweetie') which came fifth out of the 10 entries  his best result. In 1960 his offering was 'Mon Amour pour Toi' ('My love for you'), which came sixth out of 13 entries.
