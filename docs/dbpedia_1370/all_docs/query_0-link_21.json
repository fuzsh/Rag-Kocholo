        "text": "LoÃ¯c Nottet is one of the youngest and unexperinced artists this year. This 18-year-old came second in the The Voice Belgique last year and then in the fall was approached by RTBF if he would be interested in Eurovision. He didn't say yes immediately as he confesses he didn't quite know what Eurovision is! He documented himself and said yes, as it is an opportunity to make a huge show for the whole of Europe. Even if he is well aware his entry Rhythm inside isn't a typical Eurovision song he hasn't listened the other songs to avoid comparing himself to others and get stress for it. And how will his staging in Vienna be...?\n\nHis Eurovision performance will be minimalistic he says. Pure, clean and with robotic movements. There will be no dancers but backing singers as the song has rather complicated vocal arrangement and all must be performed live. His backing team will be from London. Here's a live performance.\n\nLoÃ¯c says his song is different, powerful, very clean in musical sounds with a message \"we are all the same\" inside, with blood and heart. Everyone is human, rich or poor, beautiful of ugly. The same, just different. He describes himself as a perfectionist, ambitious, loving challenges but not competitions. He just wants to sing. He dances, writes novels and poetry. Despite he likes writing he doesn't like reading. Staying a singer with career only in Belgium would be a defeat for him, he dreams of making it in France and maybe England, too.\n\nRhythm inside was born when he was alone late at night in his room and started playing with some chords on piano and the melody came to him. Later he contacted Beverly Jo Scott that he knew from the Voice and asked her to write the lyrics for it on the theme he had in mind, equality. He says the song fits his style and he didn't want to bring to Eurovision something that didn't match with him. And yes, rapapabab means the heart beating....\n\nThis blogger has been on the edge with this song from the beginning. I do like it everytime I hear it; it's exciting, fresh, different, but have some concern how it will be live, but if he nails it this can go very far. I hope for a top-12 finish, but let's see. This is a bit like Rendez Vous, another Belgian treat in the Eurovision, that was way too different to do well back then. Times have changed, maybe televoters are more welcoming to this sound than juries were to Pas De Deux ages ago...?\n\nBe you enemy or lover\n\nWe are put here to discover\n\nThe heart that beats within each other\n\nWe gonna rapppabab tonight\n\nAnd here's a special message from LoÃ¯c, enjoy!\n\nLabels\n\nMaÅgorzata JamroÅ¼y aka Margaret has also been tipped for Eurovision and apparently she did turn it down but she'd be perfect. She's got a look and persona you can't unnotice nor forget, she's got hit songs, she has been voted or nominated for everything from Trendy artist to the Hope of the Year, Fashion Icon and Glamour Woman of the year besides the usual best video, song, album, debut..... Oh she's also a fashion designer! She's very clever with social medias and would surely use it to her advantage if selected for Stockholm 2016. Her debut album is titled Add the blonde , do we need to say more? Except it includes mostly Swedish written pop tunes like Tell me how are ya , Wasted , Start a fire and Heartbeat . And of course her debut single and internationally noticed Thank you very much that you can enjoy below with all its anti-textil feel. I think she's Eurovision perfection, she's cheeky and fun, can we have her?\n\nKrista Siegfrids is delivering nice pop tunes one after another and this one is particularly catchy and soon you will be singing along..... Hopefully her Melodifestivalen entry will be equally good!\n\nRegina Lund's new video Jag Ã¤r osynlig was censored by Youtube only minutes after it had been uploaded. In the video she was playing a female Jesus who gets crusified in the end. \"I was shocked!\" she says. \"There's nothing more naked in it as in every church! It's ok to have naked man hanging on the wall but my nakedness is too much on internet? \". Oh well, no comment. She's prepairing a new album Dare Regina Lund and we of course remember her from her Melodifestivalen 2007 adventure with Rainbow star .\n\nTim Schou has a pretty good solo career going since he left his friends in London. He's travelling the world and relesing songs and videos. The latest one is a great track and comes with a steamy video that kinda takes away from the song really. But who's complaining. If you got it, flaunt it. Enjoy the video below. This post coming after the other Dane, Rasmus Seebach as wishlist for Eurovision. To think about it, Tim would do nicely, too. Maybe he should give it another go?\n\nToday's funniest Eurovision related story comes from Belarus. Some sources claim Ivan wants to perform on stage naked and with live wolf or wolves. It surely would be a first on Eurovision stage! We have seen some forgotten underwear over the years, and some cardbox animals though..... Is it time to take things a bit further? No, according the rules live animals are not allowed, and Eurovision being a family show nudity won't do either. (It seems to be ok to be half naked if you are a dancer though..... )\n\nUpdate! Another thing got Swedes talking last night: Carola's boobs when she was giving away an award. This is not the first time her boombs cause headlines; her misfortunate adventures in the 80's in Japan wer explained with her boobs being too big for Japanese market. Ok.... Or was it the song ? Anyways, Carola apologies and says she thinks the dress is stylish and elegant (even her friends said so) and she's a mature woman in her 40s, not a 16-year-old girl and looks like one. The Swedish Oscars, Guldbagge awards were given out last night. Carola was there as a guest star to sing Barbra Streisand's The way we were when honoring the movie stars who passed away during 2012. However, the cameras were too much on Carola, not on the stars showed in photos in the background and that upset many viewers as that part of the show was to celebrate them, not Carola. Oh well... The producer of the show tells in Aftonbladet the part of the show was made the sam\n\nEurovision song contest 2005 winner Helena Paparizou has been enjoying Top-5 hits every year since 2003 with the exception of 2010 and 2014, this latest one being already her 27th! And Haide is charting also in Bulgaria and Finland, of all places. The catchiness of her hits has changed less over the years than her face.... Here's the English version , below the Greek version.\n\nNo more leave me alones as Eurovision 2007 veteran Hanna Pakarinen has published in her Youtube channel a video unboxing the Finnish state's maternity box aka layette set thus announcing she's due to have a baby later this spring. Congratulations!\n\nMy flying reporter Robert sat down with Rona Nishliu from Albania who has the most amazing vocals ever to grace the Eurovision stage. He talks with her about her song writing process, Kosovo, the other entries and her way of preparing for performances. And how did she train her voice? Fascinating lady indeed! What were your thoughts when you first heard your song Suus ? The writing process of Suus was a bit special one. It wasn't the usual way that you go to a studio and composer plays it to you. It was of my request only a few piano chords that I could then do my vocal line and everything was built on that. Basicly it was interaction, it was a lot of talking involved in the process because I wanted to show and share my feelings of that moment. After that I was able to write my lyrics. All in all it took more than a month. You have a very powerful voice that can blow a listener away. What have you done it with so far? Singing for me is more than just going on stage a"
