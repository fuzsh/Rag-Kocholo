        "text": "History\n\nBefore the 2006 victory, Finland was considered by many as the ultimate under-achiever of Eurovision. Prior to its triumph, it had placed last a total of eight times, once with \"nul points\" after the introduction of the current scoring method. Finland's entry in 1982, \"Nuku pommiin\" by Kojo, was one of only fifteen songs since the modern scoring system was instituted in 1975 to earn no points. (Norway had placed last eleven times and scored zero points four times, but had also won twice before 2006). Due to low results, Finland was excluded from the contest in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003. In 2015, Finland finished last in the first semi-final with the shortest-ever Eurovision song, the one minute and 27 seconds \"Aina mun pitÃ¤Ã¤\" performed by Pertti Kurikan NimipÃ¤ivÃ¤t. Finland reached the final for the first time in four years in 2018, with Saara Aalto placing 25th.\n\nIn 2006, Finland won with the band Lordi and its song Hard Rock Hallelujah, an entry different from the mainstream Europop that dominated the competition. The song broke records scoring the highest number of points in the history of the Eurovision Song Contest, with 292. The record was eventually broken by Norway in 2009, with 387."
