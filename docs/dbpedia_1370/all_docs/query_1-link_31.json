        "text": "Introduction\n\nRicky: The other one which we can’t really watch… this one is possibly known for having the video lost by the host broadcaster in the 70s, thus, it’s impossible to find videos for much more than the opening and winner’s reprise. Again, we have another new country winning.\n\nAjit: Ah yes, 1964. These songs were the first Eurovision songs I’ve listened to, and even though I got into Eurovision a few years ago, I remember it quite well. It’s a shame most of the original video no longer exists, but the copy of the contest I’m watching has included any existing recordings into the video (but still very limited).\n\nHugues Aufray – Dès que le printemps revient (Luxembourg)\n\nRicky: This song is all right, however it is very repetitive and after a while it easily sounds like the same part of a song has been repeated, and by the end you just wish that it would be over. It’s not really a good part of a song that’s repeated either. It’s very ballady too, something which can be annoying when not done right. The instrumentation sounds very good, it’s almost studio quality too.\n\nAjit: After Luxembourg ended the last contest, they begin this one. Did this song use backing vocals too? Evidently yes, but we’ll probably never know how the singers were arranged on stage. I don’t really like the song tho, and on a separate note it sounds more Spanish than French/Luxembourgish.\n\nAnneke Grönloh – Jij bent mijn leven (The Netherlands)\n\nRicky: This song is very odd. I like the introduction very much, but to me it starts getting very jumpy, and it doesn’t truly understand what it wants to be, possibly not in a good way. Of course, it does have that upbeat part that may sound like background music that I’d love to have on.\n\nAjit: This is the song that introduced me to Eurovision! Anneke is the first Eurovision singer come from a country that can’t join the EBU - she is of Dutch-Indonesian descent (understandably you know why it was this song that pulled me into the whole thing). Her usual genre, however, is keroncong (traditional Indonesian music inspired by Portuguese fado) and sounds nothing like this - reportedly she disagreed over the conductor Dolf Van Der Linden’s orchestration, she wanted it to match the completely different-sounding studio version (I’m glad they didn’t do that!). Anyway, the song would’ve had to be interesting enough to make me the Europal I am today, so I certainly like this song, and I especially like how it was orchestrated.\n\nArne Bendiksen – Spiral (Norway)\n\nRicky: To me, I find this song very much of its time. It’s very orchestral, and well set out. I find myself enjoying this song much more than the other two. I really like how it’s set out and divided around the instruments. It sounds like something I’m going to like to listen to again.\n\nAjit: This guy would go on to compose and conduct one of my all-time Norwegian faves (1971). This song itself is also nice, and parts of the orchestration would remind you of Norway 1962’s live version (if you remember what I said about the song). The lyrics, however, do not really make sense, and curiously he pronounces the ‘r’ like a Dane, making it sound like Danish (especially since I already have difficulty telling them apart in written form), perhaps it had something to do with the fact that it was being hosted in Denmark?\n\nBjørn Tidmand – Sangen om dig (Denmark)\n\nRicky: The Danish songs can be a little bit hit or miss, and this year seems to be another miss for me. It sounds like another song from the Eurovisions of past, but I can’t remember which song it reminds me specifically of, but it’s definitely an earlier contest’s song.\n\nAjit: Speak of the devil. In my opinion it’s the weakest of this year’s Scandinavian entries (perhaps I would’ve said differently if Sweden didn’t withdraw), but the nice, cheerful atmosphere of the song is still appreciated. It sounds more French than Danish, and I like how they had that rather dark-sounding part towards the end, just before the instrumental break. But overall I consider it weak.\n\nLasse Mårtenson – Laiskotellen (Finland)\n\nRicky: The Finnish entry to this Eurovision is very bare, almost to the point of not having much orchestration, while the music still happened, for a while. The instrumentations are very interestingly done during some parts of the song, which is when they are there. I think the song is interesting, but maybe not the best so far.\n\nAjit: If they grouped 3 Scandinavian countries together at the end of the scoreboard the previous year, they grouped them together in the running order this year. It’s a nice song and it goes a different direction than any of the songs we’ve heard so far from tonight, both musically and lyrically, so I would support it. The chorus is particularly catchy.\n\nUdo Jürgens – Warum nur warum? (Austria)\n\nRicky: This is his first of three in a row, and he would end up winning his last entrance into the competition. This song starts off soft, and from what I remember of his winning entry, this starts very similarly in chord progression. This song is very interesting, and well done for a song. Its use of the piano seems to be very similar to the use of guitar in Dansevise, but other than that I can’t see much influence on it.\n\nAjit: The first of Udo’s 3 consecutive appearances at Eurovision isn’t a social network song, but rather a gloomy piece asking why nothing is forever. It has a well-done buildup towards the end, and is my second favourite of his 3 attempts. What made this so great was definitely the emotion that he invested in the performance - we can’t see it today but we can certainly hear it and feel the song. I think 6th place is not enough for this, but imo there are more underrated songs this edition.\n\nRachel – Le chant de Mallory (France)\n\nRicky: It’s very dainty, and also much better than at least a few of the French entries that I’ve heard over the course of this reviewing period. I could, like a couple of other songs from this year, listen to this song for a while on repeat. I may not pay attention, but this song does have that calming feeling that makes a song feel good to me.\n\nAjit: This song is also beautiful (tho I won’t compare to Austria), and I like the intro, tho otherwise it isn’t worth talking about. The piano in the live version gives a decent beat to the song, compared to its studio which lacks any beat. The song is apparently based on a real person - a guy named Mallory (I previously thought it was a girls’ name).\n\nMatt Monro – I Love the Little Things (United Kingdom)\n\nRicky: This song is much more upbeat live, and I feel that I like this live version more than the studio, however that may be the artist’s voice seeming a little less harsh in this version than the other version. This song is possibly a worthy second place.\n\nAjit: In my opinion this song has some kind of Christmasy vibe as well, and I particularly enjoy the tune - if this were in another language it probably would still do well. Slightly unrelated, but this guy overheard the Austrian entry and decided to make a cover of his own (Walk Away), now more famous than the original.\n\nNora Nova – Man gewöhnt sich so schnell an das Schöne (Germany)\n\nRicky: This song seems to start off almost like a horror movie’s soundtrack would, but then quickly fades into another German ballad song, but then when it changes, it changes into an upbeat but also very weird song that I really like to bop around to. It’s very different and quirkily orchestrated, and that’s what may have led to the nul point status of this song. As well as the fact that it changes genres very oddly, but enjoyably.\n\nAjit: Now we move on to my favourite of the night. The first Eastern European at the contest is Bulgarian, and this entry holds the record for longest song title. The studio and live versions are distinct (studio sounds more clean and 'jazzy’), but I prefer the live, definitely. Unfortunately the juries didn’t like the repetition (most of the song is only the chorus repeated 4 times), but I overlook things like that when I enjoy the overall sound. I don’t know about you, but this is my 12 points - juries gave it 0, so I definitely think this is very underrated.\n\nRomuald – Où sont-elles passes (Monaco)\n\nRicky: Subtly orchestrated, and it’s very quiet. I can see how this entry managed to gain third place, definitely. To me, this is what a power ballad could sound like if the orchestral element of the competition had stayed in, however it’s mostly in respect to when the song builds, which doesn’t seem to be too often within the song.\n\nAjit: I won’t talk about his future comebacks, but the song sounds very 'summer’ to me. I used to be able to understand why this song did well, but looking back, now I don’t. It’s overrated.\n\nAntónio Calvário –Oração (Portugal)\n\nRicky: Ah yes, the entry of the new country which accumulated a whole nul points within its debut year. Although, this song does sound very similar to many of the other entries of the time, however that doesn’t mean the songs are interesting, just that they fit with the time.\n\nAjit: The first debutant in 3 years is also the first ever to gain nul points on their debut. Finishing last was common for debuting entries, but the only other nul pointer debut is Lithuania - neither have won to this day. I can see why this song did badly, but additionally the lyrics were quite religious (we’ll learn soon that juries don’t like that). Or maybe they did bad just because they performed before the eventual landslide victor…\n\nGigliola Cinquetti – Non ho l'età (Italy)\n\nRicky: Ah yes, the winner. This song does sound similar enough to the song on studio, which is good. For me, this song sounds enough like the other ballads to appeal to the Francophone juries whose countries were sending sounds similar (except France who gave the entry no points), and also sounds enough like a new song, with influences of other songs from the Italian entries (it does have a bit of resemblance to Volare) to cement its belonging to the country.\n\nAjit: On my copy, there’s a short recorded part where it is the actual performance (rather than the reprise). It was certainly beautiful, and the audience and juries were in agreement with this. I don’t mind it winning.\n\nSabahudin Kurt – Život je sklopio krug (Yugoslavia)\n\nRicky: This song sounds very familiar, and I mean in the way that I’m sure that the introduction is the introduction to something from the musical Grease, or something else possibly nearer to the time, but I don’t really like it, but it’s also a nul.\n\nAjit: It’s such a melancholic melody, and I believe that was enough to make it stand out. Or maybe they got nul because they performed after the eventual landslide victor? Either way, I think this song should have at least picked up a few votes, because it’s beautiful in a way that wasn’t mainstream.\n\nAnita Traversi – I miei pensieri (Switzerland)\n\nRicky: This is an Italian Swiss entry, but also the fourth and final nul point entry of the night. I feel very weird around this song. I kind of want to like it, but the thing is I can’t make myself say that I like it either. It’s definitely an okay song, but I don’t think it’s an amazing song, even by the ‘nul point’ song standards. I kinda wished it would just end to the honest… for what felt like twenty minutes.\n\nAjit: This is also one of my favourites. I can see why they didn’t do well, but I also think they should’ve at least picked up a few points. I do like this song as much as her 1960 entry tho. The difference is that her previous attempt had power, while this one was left hanging around like a cloud (pun intended). I still think it was underrated.\n\nAfter this entry was performed, a man went on to the stage carrying a sign that said “Boycott Franco and Salazar” (the then-leaders of Spain and Portugal). While his timing was incorrect, he was promptly removed and did not disturb any performances (contrary to Jimmy Jump). The viewers at home saw a shot of the scoreboard instead, and after the man was removed, the rest of the show went as planned (a whistle can be heard when the incident happened, in case you were curious).\n\nRobert Cogoi – Près de ma riviere (Belgium)\n\nRicky: STAGE INVASION!!! WOOOoOOOOOO but we can’t see it because the tape was lost.\n\nOh yeah there’s a song to listen to and talk about. French Belgium have not sent Fud. I believe they made the right decision with this choice, especially seeing as though they’ve escaped nul points (barely) this time around. This is an all right song, however it reminds me of the 1966 winner (more on that very soon), especially with the piano line driving the song. I don’t mind the song, however eventually I began to feel bored with it.\n\nAjit: After the brilliant entries we’ve seen this one is disappointing. It doesn’t particularly drag, but isn’t interesting at all.\n\nTim, Nelly & Tony (Los TNT) – Caracola (Spain)\n\nRicky: A very odd song, it almost immediately reminds me of the Wizard of Oz soundtrack, especially around when the house gets lifted up in a tornado. I personally feel that this song was lucky to escape nul-point-dom as it feels very barely done. I’m trying to find something in it, but there’s nothing… until it breaks into the same sort of instrumentation that most of the other songs of the era had… until it then goes into this strong chorus, which I would’ve loved to have heard a full length song on.\n\nAjit: The final entry of the night was introduced beautifully, even if it didn’t suit the rest of the song (this does not exist in the studio version). It doesn’t particularly sound Spanish, but does sound distinct and would’ve stood out… perhaps it was just a matter of taste, since they were 1 point away from nul. At least it went out with a bang.\n\nConclusion\n\nRicky: The Italian song has made it to the top spot with the largest margin that has ever won the song contest, however not the most amount of points scored that could’ve possibly been scored. United Kingdom got their second second, and there’s another four countries that got awarded with nul point. This is also the last contest that has lost all of the tape, however the version of 1970 I found has the first six or so minutes in monochrome, meaning that the colour tape was lost, however some of the other tapes that are around with the colours kind of show the age. I hope that somebody can find the 1956 and 1964 tapes, but I feel the audio was adequate enough.\n\nAjit: Seeing the lot of nice songs in this contest, you might understand why I stayed and become the Eurovision fan you know me as today - I certainly do not regret it. I still await for the day where they find a (almost-)complete recording of the contest tho."
