        "text": "Hello again! I am back again with a new concept that I hope that people will like and that will at least tear down some of the PED from the fellow members of this forum, now when the 2024 contest is over. I have picked out a total of 256 songs, from the contests long history. The time frames that I picked out songs from were eight in total; 1956-1965, 1966-1973, 1974-1983, 1984-1992, 1993-2000, 2001-2008, 2009-2016 and 2017-2024. From each I have selected the best ranked song from each time-frame from all countries that at least participated once.\n\nThese 256 songs has now been put in groups of 16, randomly decided by the time-frame mentioned earlier so they are divided apart. Your job is to work as the Eurovision Jury does, to RANK all the 16 songs in every heat, where no. 1 is your favorite and no. 16 your least favorite song. The 8 best ranked songs qualify to the 2nd round. In the end, we will have the final 16 songs, all battling for the trophy of being THE BEST OF THE BEST!\n\nHere are the 16 songs that compete in this heat!\n\nHEAT #7\n\n1. MALTA 2005 - \"Angel\" Chiara\n\n2. ISRAEL 1998 - \"Diva\" Dana International\n\n3. SWEDEN 1974 - \"Waterloo\" ABBA\n\n4. CYPRUS 2018 - \"Fuego\" Eleni Foureira\n\n5. ITALY 1990 - \"Insieme: 1992\" Toto Cutugno\n\n6. ESTONIA 2009 - \"Rändajad\" Urban Symphony\n\n7. SPAIN 1968 - \"La, La, La\" Massiel\n\n8. BELGIUM 2015 - \"Rhythm Inside\" Loïc Nottet\n\n9. CYPRUS 2004 - \"Stronger Every Minute\" Lisa Andreas\n\n10. ISRAEL 1973 - \"Ey Sham\" Ilanit\n\n11. ROMANIA 2010 - \"Playing With Fire\" Paula Seling & Ovi\n\n12. ICELAND 2003 - \"Open Your Heart\" Birgitta\n\n13. ITALY 2011 - \"Madness Of Love\" Raphael Gualazzi\n\n14. SWITZERLAND 2005 - \"Cool Vibes\" Vanilla Ninja\n\n15. SPAIN 1995 - \"Vuelve Conmigo\" Anabel Conde\n\n16. BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA 2006 - \"Lejla\" Hari Mata Hari\n\nA full youtube playlist of all the songs in HEAT #7! (click on \"HEAT #7\")\n\nThis contest is going to be rather long, so the deadlines will be quite short and always be put on Mondays or Thursdays.\n\nYou vote by ranking all 16 songs from 1 being the best, to 16 the one you like the least.\n\nYou send this ranking to me via private messages!\n\nThe deadline for this heat ends on Thursday the 29th of August at 21 CEST!\n\nSo let us pick the Best of the Best!"
