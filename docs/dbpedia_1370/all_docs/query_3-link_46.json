Each country performed two songs. Each country cast two jury votes. Countries were allowed to vote for themselves. The ballot was secret, and the votes were never publicly released. The Luxembourg jurors weren't able to attend so Switzerland voted on their behalf (which makes Switzerland's win seem suspicious). There was no 3-minute rule. There's no surviving footage of this contest. And there was zero English songs in 1956 as the UK didn't participate until 1957. Thankfully, things become more familiar in 1957.\n\nStylistically, the 14 songs are what you'd expect to hear in 1956. SO MANY slow boring big band orchestral crooner/vocal ballads. I just listened to a quick recap of the 14 songs and they all sound the same lol. This is definitely not my era.\n\nDespite possible corrupt voting, I think the jury picked the right winner. \"Refrain\" sounds BIG. It begins and ends with a huge blast of brass from the orchestra. It's Eurovision asserting its mark from the beginning. Meanwhile Lys Assia is a competent singer and the French language always sounds beautiful. (I believe French was the most widely spoken language on the European continent at the time, which would explain why so many of the early winners are in French). The orchestra and backing vocals chime in at the right times to elevate the song. Lyrically, \"Refrain\" is melancholic and reflective. About being nostalgic for a young romance. Wishing to recapture it, but she seems to accept that life moves on. I'd say it's a well written song, assuming the translation is accurate.\n\nVerdict: YASSSSS tier. \"Refrain\" grew on me as I writing this review. It set a precedent for Eurovision winners and the contest is still going 64 years later.\n\nMy points go to....\n\n01. Switzerland: Lys Assia - Refrain\n\n02. Italy: Franca Raimondi - Aprite le finestre\n\n03. Luxembourg: Michèle Arnaud - Ne crois pas\n\n04. Netherlands: Jetty Paerl - De vogels van Holland\n\n05.

Juries were no longer allowed to vote for their own country. The votes were made public, and a clearly defined voting system was established - each country was given 10 points to distribute however they wish... the current 12-point system wasn't adopted until the 1970's. And three new countries debuted (the UK, Denmark and Austria).\n\nThe 1957 contest was 1 hr 8 min, which I think is the shortest in ESC history. It featured more slow boring orchestral ballads. That won't change for a while. Germany had possibly the first joke entry in ESC history with \"Telefon, Telefon\"; where the performer Margot Hielscher literally sings and talks into a telephone prop. The Italian entry was over 5 minutes long, which lead to the implementation of the 3-minute rule in future contests. The UK's first entry was an operatic ballad, and boy does Patricia Bredin belt it. While the first Danish entry sees a wife say goodbye to her military husband. They even share an onstage kiss.\n\n1957 is a fairly \"meh\" contest. While there's a few interesting performances, none of them feel all that memorable. They don't elevate themselves above the pack in the way \"Refrain\" did.\n\nThe winner, Corry Brokken's \"Net als toen\", is a snoozefest. I can hum the melody of almost every Eurovision winner. This one I cannot. Where's the hook? It lacks the orchestral bombast of \"Refrain\". And it blends in with every other performance of the time. Yes I'm quite harsh with 1950's music but most of it bores me. On the positive side... the song is fine lyrically. Corry misses the romantic fairytale phase of her marriage. It's relatable. And the \"Ja, je wordt dik en je haar wordt al grijs\" part has a pleasing poetic bounciness to it.\n\nVerdict: Meh tier. This just doesn't feel like a winner to me. The song isn't terrible, but I rank it pretty low compared to the other 66 champions.\n\nMy points go to....\n\n01. France: Paule Desjardins - La Belle amour\n\n02. Germany: Margot Hielscher - Telefon, Telefon\n\n03. Luxembourg: Danièle Dupré - Amours mortes (tant de peine)\n\n04. Switzerland: Lys Assia - L'Enfant que j'étais\n\n05. Netherlands: Corry Brokken - Net als toen\n\n06. Denmark: Birthe Wilke & Gustav Winckler - Skibet skal sejle i nat\n\n07. Belgium: Bobbejaan Schoepen - Straatdeuntje\n\n08. Austria: Bob Martin - Wohin, kleines Pony?\n\n09. United Kingdom: Patricia Bredin - All\n\n10. Italy: Nunzio Gallo - Corde della mia chitarra\n\nLeo ✔ Ｓｏｕｎｄｃｌ🕤ｃｋ\n\nPost by ry4n on\n\nHilversum 1958\n\nHost: Netherlands\n\nParticipants: 10\n\nVoting method: Ten-member juries distributed 10 points among their favourite songs\n\nWinner: André Claveau - Dors, mon amour\n\nCountry: France\n\nPoints: 27 (30.0% of highest score possible)\n\nLanguage: French\n\nYouTube | Spotify | Lyrics\n\nThe 1958 contest saw the first interval act. Corry Brokken and Lys Assia represented the Netherlands and Switzerland (respectively) for the third consecutive year. A future dominant country in ESC, Sweden, debuted. The UK departed after losing its bid to host the contest. Which means, for the second and last time, there's no entries in English. The Netherlands hosted the contest instead, setting the tradition of the winning country hosting the next contest.\n\nThe most well-known entry of 1958 is not the winner. It's the Italian entry - Domenico Modugno's \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\" or \"Volare\". The song was a huge international hit and it even topped the Billboard Hot 100 and won two Grammy awards. Arguably the most successful song in ESC history.\n\nThe Italian and Swiss entries are better than anything from 1956 and 1957, aside from \"Refrain\". However the 1958 is another fairly dull set of entries. More slow orchestral ballads. Even the Swedish entry is dull! Margot Hielscher represents West Germany again; this time in a pageant dress holding vinyl records.\n\nThe third Eurovision winner, \"Dors, mon amour\", performed by André Claveau, is a typical 1950's crooner ballad. I could see Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin singing this. It's a diary of André's thoughts while he watches his significant other sleep. It's sugary sweet and well sung. Aptly, this song is a sleepy lullaby. It's another winner where I can't hum the melody from memory. Which is never a good thing.\n\nVerdict: Meh. Another dull one. Italy is the real winner.\n\nMy points go to....\n\n01. Italy: Domenico Modugno - Nel blu, dipinto di blu\n\n02. Germany: Margot Hielscher - Für zwei Groschen Musik\n\n03. Switzerland: Lys Assia - Giorgio\n\n04. Sweden: Alice Babs - Lilla stjärna\n\n05. Belgium: Fud Leclerc - Ma petite chatte\n\n06. Netherlands: Corry Brokken - Heel de wereld\n\n07. Austria: Liane Augustin - Die ganze Welt braucht Liebe\n\n08. Denmark: Raquel Rastenni - Jeg rev et blad ud af min dagbog\n\n09. France: André Claveau - Dors, mon amour\n\n10. Luxembourg: Solange Berry - Un grand amour\n\nLeo ✔ Ｓｏｕｎｄｃｌ🕤ｃｋ\n\nPost by ry4n on\n\nCannes 1959\n\nHost: France\n\nParticipants: 11\n\nVoting method: Ten-member juries distributed 10 points among their favourite songs\n\nWinner: Teddy Scholten - Een beetje\n\nCountry: Netherlands\n\nPoints: 21 (21.0% of highest score possible)\n\nLanguage: Dutch\n\nYouTube | Spotify | Lyrics\n\nThe fourth Eurovision Song Contest featured a livelier set of entries, thankfully. The uptempos outnumber the ballads! Denmark, the winning Netherlands, Germany and Sweden provide some playful/perky/buoyant numbers. The UK returned with a new formula that they'd repeat several times - the jaunty silly song (\"Sing Little Birdie\"), which includes whistles and a finger puppet. Too childish for me. It got them second place and they haven't missed a contest since. France also went the silly route with \"Oui, oui, oui, oui\". 1958 also saw Monaco debut (while Luxembourg missed this one). Domenico Modugno represented Italy again, but finished worse this time.\n\nThe hosts France tried a new gimmick with the stage - the performers entered via a revolving door that had a painted backdrop. And the host used a giant pointing stick for the scoreboard. I find that amusing for some reason.\n\nSo the Netherlands became the first repeat winner. \"Een beetje\" is definitely catchier than \"Net als toen\". The chorus has a bouncy sing-songy melody accentuated by Teddy's enunciation. I like it when Eurovision songs play to the poetic strengths of the respective languages. Because, generally, Dutch doesn't sound pretty. In between the perky choruses, the verses offer a more stripped back reflective side.\n\n1950's love songs can be so serious. \"Een beetje\" (\"A Bit\" in English) is definitely not. Teddy is happy to be in a casual relationship. And that sentiment matches her chipper delivery. Teddy deduces that if they opened their hearts, it would lead to promises of being faithful, and inevitably one of them would cheat. She's happy to avoid that mess by not getting emotionally involved (ie. closing the door to her heart).\n\nVerdict: YASSS tier for its uniqueness. Seems the first few \"black-and-white era\" winners are either quite good or quite meh.\n\nMy points go to....\n\n01. Sweden: Brita Borg - Augustin\n\n02. Netherlands: Teddy Scholten - Een beetje\n\n03. Switzerland: Christa Williams - Irgendwoher\n\n04. Germany: Alice and Ellen Kessler - Heute Abend wollen wir tanzen geh'n\n\n05.

With Nikita Khrushchev taking power, the Warsaw Pact, the Hungarian revolt, the Soviet Union assuming control over eastern Europe, the Berlin Wall construction in 1961, and ultimately the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. The Cold War was at its hottest peak. An iron curtain divided Europe into east and west. And the destruction of World War II was still fresh in people's memories. So the west united for one day a year in a song contest to focus on something more positive. This context is worth mentioning.\n\nAnyway onto the 1960 contest itself. It features another set of livelier songs, and a few more boring crooner ballads. The Netherlands declined to host again, so the UK stepped up. Meaning this is the first contest with an English speaking host (Katie Boyle - who would host three more times). The UK sent another silly jaunty entry (\"looking high high high, looking low, low, low\") and once again placed 2nd. Norway debuted and Luxembourg returned. Otherwise, pretty standard affair compared to the first four contests.\n\nSo the Netherlands and France play hot potato with the past 4 winners. \"Tom Pillibi\" is another perky bouncy number, in the same vein as \"Een beetje\". The instrumentation reminds me of classic Disney movies. And I like the sing-songy nursery rhyme enunciation of the verses. It sets the mood of a fantastical fairytale. Jacqueline's boyfriend is flexing big time. He's a king, he owns two castles, ships, some gold. Extreme exaggerations, I'm sure. But there's a twist towards the end of the song - it's all a lie! However, Jacqueline is still happy in this relationship for one reason. She is the one real thing that her boyfriend brags about. She gets to be the queen in this fairytale.\n\nIt's a neat song, although it's reductive of the previous winner. Right down to the twist ending (\"But actually, I'm happy that my heart has no door either\" in \"Een beetje\" / \"but he's such a liar\" in \"Tom Pillibi\".)\n\nVerdict: I'm fine with it.\n\nMy points go to....\n\n01.

This brought the number of entrants to 16, making the 6th contest feel more full than the first 5. France, unlike the Netherlands, went through with hosting again. Unfortunately, the 1961 contest is heavy on the slow, sleep-inducing ballads. While Spain and Germany's performances are just painful. The UK placed 2nd for the third consecutive year. This time with harmonizing duo The Allisons, who remind me of the Everly Brothers. It's the most modern-sounding song of the night. Sweden provides a bouncy whistling number. France goes the silly hook route (\"bing-a-bong\"). And Italy finishes the night with a belter.\n\nOne of the strangest Eurovision facts is Luxembourg winning FIVE times. Though I don't think any of their winners are native to Luxembourg. Another interesting fact: Luxembourg placed last in 1960 and first in 1961.\n\nOn initial assessment, the winner “Nous les amoureux” (translated: “We, The Lovers”) sounds like any other male crooner ballad from the “black-and-white era”. However, I think there's more depth to the song than that. The vocal tone and instrumentation create a downbeat, romantic, soothing atmosphere. I'm sure the French language has something to do with that. The lyrics are a reassurance and defiance against other people's opinions of Jean-Claude's relationship. All that matters is that they're happy together. “We, the lovers, we're going to live without you” is certainly a statement of conviction.\n\nI like the way Jean-Claude sings the title phrase. It's the main hook of the song. But it's really the only hook. Not sure how I'd make the melody more memorable, though.\n\nVerdict: Yeah, I like it\n\nMy points go to....\n\n01.

A new voting a system was adopted. Similar to the current 12-point system, but only the top 3 received points. 1962 is another contest heavy on the orchestral ballads. I'm ready to move on from this era. You'd never know rock-and-roll or doo-wop existed. It's also the year of performers singing the hell out of their songs. Particularly the last 3 of the night - Luxembourg, Italy and Monaco. All huge belters, each outdoing the previous one. While Austria's entry is straight-up opera.\n\nFinland (\"tipi-tii tipi-tipi-tipi tii\") and the UK (\"Ring-A-Ding Girl\") fill the quota on silly hooks. Fud Leclerc represents Belgium for the 4th and final time. Luxembourg's Camillo Felgen, who placed last in 1960, redeems himself by finishing 3rd. The Netherlands send a vocal harmonizing duo akin to The Allisons (the UK's 1961 entry). While Sweden's entry is quite upbeat, despite the weird vocal ticks in the bridge.\n\nSo France wins for the 3rd time in 5 years. The country and its language dominated the early years of Eurovision. Despite the gluttony of big vocal performances in 1962, the winner actually aims for a downbeat performance; mostly. Indeed Isabelle's vocal tone is soft, soothing, and seductive. The part where she touches her face adds charm to the performance.\n\n“Un premier amour” just feels magical. It's Isabelle's seductive voice. It's how she repeats certain phrases throughout, particularly the title phrase. And it's the restrained instrumentation. Meanwhile, the downbeat sections are balanced with vocal soars in the middle and end. “Un premier amour” is the perfect soundtrack to a romantic moonlit scene in a movie.\n\nVerdict: YASSS tier. I was not expecting to rank the early winners so highly. But “Un premier amour” is pure CLASS.\n\nMy points go to....\n\n01. France: Isabelle Aubret - Un premier amour\n\n02.

So the UK stepped up again, with the classy Katie Boyle presenting. The hosting Brits redesigned the stage and switched to a hidden boom microphone. This allowed for more props and movement compared to the first 7 contests, where the performers mostly stood in one spot. So the 1963 contest was the first push towards a more visual medium (Eurovision began as an audio-focused program). Indeed, a few countries took advantage. The UK performer sat on a platform, Netherlands had a music box, Germany had some dancing, Italy had 7-foot portraits of women, and France had a spinning girl fading in and out of frame.\n\nFor the third year in a row, there was no change in the 16 competing countries. The voting system did change slightly - the juries now voted for five songs instead of three. Also of note; Nana Mouskouri, who has sold over 300 million records worldwide, represented Luxembourg.. even though she's Greek.\n\nThe 8th Eurovision Song Contest still contains plenty of orchestral ballads, but my top 3 is super strong. Switzerland's entry is excellent – I'm a sucker for these soft, melodic French language numbers. While Monaco's entry gives me the feels.\n\nThe 1963 jury result was controversial. Norway's jury votes were announced incorrectly, so they were pushed to the end of the queue. But after the other 15 countries revealed, Norway delivered a different result from earlier and it switched the winner from Switzerland to Denmark. This seemed suspicious.\n\nBut there's been enough Francophone winners. It's good when different styles win this contest - it's why I ranked “Een Beetje” and “Tom Pillibi” highly for breaking the ballad sludge. “Dansevise” is a fresh and unique Eurovision entry. The magic comes from the minimalist guitar plucking. It's pushed to the forefront, while the orchestra mostly quiets until the chorus, when the string section soars. This instrumentation creates such a melancholic mood. Grethe's performance complements it. Her delivery is downbeat in the verses and compelling in the chorus. “Dansevise” is a song of contrast. Even in the middle – the guitar/vocals are buoyant on “I'm dancing and dancing”, then switch to gloomy on “Come back, come back” three lines later. Similarly, the lyrics switch between listing physical sensations to getting lost in a dance to pleading for this guy to return. The repetition of certain phrases works well too. Yes it adds hooks, but it's also Grethe repeating thoughts in her mind. “Dansevise” is a rush of constantly changing emotions.\n\nVerdict: G.O.A.T. tier. No question.\n\nMy points go to....\n\n01.

Only a few clips and photos. The film was reportedly destroyed in a fire in Denmark. And no other copy has been uploaded online yet. Which is a shame because the stage looks elegant with the spiral stair case. This means I can't comment on the visual aspect of this contest.\n\nApparently the organizers could not decide on a voting system during this era. It was changed again – now the juries give points to three songs (5 pts, 3 pts, 1 pt). The 1964 contest saw Portugal debut (and receive 0 points) while Sweden missed out due to a boycott. The style of songs remained largely the same from previous contests. While the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Spain are the stand-outs in terms of fresh sound. The Dutch entry being a personal highlight of mine - excellent instrumental and bitterness, despite the lyrics suggesting a doormat situation. Meanwhile, Austria sent Udo Jürgens, who pours his heart out. More on that in 2 years.\n\nThis year's controversy came from a political protest invading the stage after Switzerland's performance.\n\nSo Italy won by a landslide – 49 points vs 17 for second place. The country deserved a win by this point. The Italian entries (thus far) aren't always to my taste, but they put forth the effort. “Non ho l'età” is structurally well-crafted. It contrasts minimalism and bombast, reaching the extremes on both ends. Indeed, “Non ho l'età” opens with a huge orchestral bang, then dives into the most delicate vocals. The song basically escalates in tension across three verses. Then repeats. The first involves Gigliola timidly whispering “I'm not old enough” while the orchestra restrains itself to a few “bom-bom”'s. The second verse teases with 4 dramatic piano notes. Finally, in the third section, Gigliola and the orchestra release all the built up tension. Asking nicely for this guy to wait isn't working, so she asserts her stance. While Gigliola's voice switches from meek to commanding.\n\nGigliola was 16 at the time, and her voice is just beautiful on this song. I love the message of a young girl standing up for herself. And the balance between shyness and the bursting works well.\n\nVerdict: YASSS tier. This is a such strong run of winners.\n\nMy points go to....\n\n01.

The 1965 contest still features many snoozer ballads – looking at you Ireland, Denmark, Finland and Yugoslavia. The Beatles were supposed to kill off this type of music! That said, the top 2 – Luxembourg and the UK – sound contemporary. Also the Dutch and Norwegian entries have livelier, more intricate/remarkable instrumentation. So some countries are pushing Eurovision forward. And I generally give my top points to the ones that do.\n\nElsewhere, Germany's performer sounds bored. Udo Jürgens represents Austria again with another tear-jerking ballad. Sweden goes straight-up opera (ABBA can't come soon enough). The UK places 2nd for the fifth time. Finland's performer looks like a young Abe Lincoln. And the '64 and '65 contests used a weird bar graph scoreboard instead of actual numbers.\n\nIreland finally debuts (so now we get two English songs per contest!) and Sweden returns, bringing the participating countries to 18. Which will be around the average until the late 80's.\n\nThe 1965 stage is tiny and basic, with a generic back drop. Once again, the performers stand still in front of a microphone. Love you Italy, but you dropped the ball there.\n\nThe early Eurovision contests focused on quality of song composition, rather than spectacle or pop appeal like later years. That's probably why I agree with most of the winners so far. The Francophone countries especially delivered on quality. Indeed, Luxembourg won for a second time in 1965, bringing the Francophone win ratio to 6/10. I think I've figured out Luxembourg's success – they're able to teleport top songs and artists from other countries. Gall was already successful in her native France. Even moreso after the 1965 contest, while “Poupée de cire, poupée de son” became a top 10 hit all over Europe. A sign that Eurovision is about to enter its next era – though I'd say '67 is the turning point.\n\n“Poupée de cire, poupée de son” is my favourite pre-“Waterloo” winner. It is the most energetic Eurovision entry of the first 10 contests. It injects so much life into the contest. Frenetic, never stopping, thrusting forward. So much credit goes to the orchestra/instrumentation. The opening scampers, the string section holding things steady, the percussion stamping the syllables of the title phrase, the brief pause after the title phrase. It's so intricate and provides so much energy. But that's not to discredit France Gall – she spears that chorus right at you.\n\nLyrically, “Poupée” is a cynical self reflection of being a pop singer. It's a pop song criticizing pop songs.. so it's self deprecating and meta. Gall feels like a “rag doll, wax doll”, as per the translated title. Her music describes experiences of love that aren't real. Gall was 17 at the time - never experienced love. Yet the public listens to the fake stories anyway. The song ends with Gall hoping she'll find real love someday. “Poupée” addresses an interesting point about artists lacking creative control, and the public not caring about authenticity.. but that's a whole other discussion.\n\nVerdict: G.O.A.T. tier.\n\nMy points go to....\n\n01.

Three songs in particular are stand-outs to me. First, the Norwegian entry is rather unique for Eurovision – it's a brooding, folksy number featuring an acoustic guitar. The Belgian entry is cute and Tonia has fun with it. And the Swedish entry is amusing. It involves a married couple lightheartedly playing lines off of each other. The song finished 2nd, becoming Sweden's first ESC smash.\n\nThe Danish entry lets loose too. It's a boisterous 1950's number where a couple randomly dances on stage in the middle of the song. Luxembourg (whose instrumental sounds like “She's Not Unusual”), Yogoslavia, Switzerland and France have melodic entries as well.\n\nConversely; Austria, Spain and Italy go for dramatic, gut-wrenching emotion. Austria's Udo Jürgens did the exact same thing for the third year in a row, and won. Spain went for super intense anguish. And Domenico Modugno represented Italy for the third time... and received 0 points. What a tumble from “Volare”.\n\nThe 1966 card is frontloaded though, and ends on 3 letdowns. First the Netherlands. They seem to be the most willing to try new things in the 60's. But their 1966 entry is a doozy. Milly Scott is the first black performer in Eurovision, which is awesome. But the performance involves two guitarists dressed in stereotypical Mexican attire (sombreros and all). And the lyrics are nonsense. Then Ireland is a little similar to \"Unchained Melody\". And finally, the UK has an incredibly dated entry – with Kenneth McKellar dressed in full traditional Scottish attire.\n\nThe 1966 contest featured the same 18 participants as 1965. They kept the weird 5-3-1 voting system. And a German language song finally won. You could argue that Austria and Germany had the biggest disadvantage in early Eurovision. They're not part of the Francophone bloc, nor the Nordic bloc. They lack the widespread recognition of English. And German doesn't sound “pleasant” like Spanish or Italian. Also, perhaps World War II was still fresh in people's memories.\n\nBut persistence pays off for Udo Jürgens. For three consecutive years, he gave the exact same performance of crying his heart out in front of a piano. I appreciated his earnest emoting at first, but after the THIRD consecutive time I'm just over it. It's like the juries gave him the win so he'd finally stop. I cannot review “Merci, Chérie” in a vacuum.\n\nIn 1964, Jürgens plead “why, why, why” a bunch of times. In 1965, he asked to keep his pain and desperation a secret. And in 1966, he thanks his ex for her love. There is a progression of maturation across these three performances. But structurally and melodically, each song is so similar, and weaker than the previous one.\n\nThat said, I do like how Jürgens trembles while repeating certain words. It creates a hook. And it gives the impression that he's sobbing and struggling to get the words out while he says goodbye on a dark rainy night. That's the mental image I get anyway.\n\nVerdict: It's ok. Reductive. Jürgens pours everything into “Merci, Chérie”. But my reaction is just “whatever”.\n\nMy points go to....\n\n01. Norway: Åse Kleveland - Intet er nytt under solen\n\n02.

As the first non-serious winner, “Puppet” ended the “black-and-white” era, and it kicked off whatever the next era is – the stretch from here to “Waterloo”. I'll give it a name later. It's the era when Eurovision entered its peak period of relevance and chart impact. Indeed, “Puppet” was a huge hit across the continent. The early years produced plenty of classics too; but fewer countries participated, television wasn't as widely accessible, and most of those entries sound old as f**k.\n\nThe voting method returned to the original one from 1957. Denmark withdrew for the next decade. The hosting Austria built a unique stage atheistic – it had revolving mirrors behind the performers. Presenter Erica Vaal introduced the audience in several languages. The jury voting was a mess though – the university students kept entering incorrect numbers. And Vaal almost announced the winner before calling the final country (Ireland). It's a funny moment though.\n\nThis year's orchestra is superb. They used a variety of instruments and focused more on percussion. Even including a tambourine. So Eurovision finally sounds vaguely 60's. Chart music was changing quickly at the time with all the experimental songs ready to burst. But this contest always existed in its own bubble before 2000.\n\nThe 1967 entries are a mix of lighthearted catchy numbers and the usual plethora of ballads. SO MANY BALLADS.\n\nThe Entries\n\nNetherlands: Thérèse Steinmetz - Ring-dinge-ding\n\nThe Netherlands employs a silly “ring ding ding a ding” hook, but Thérèse has fun with it.\n\nLuxembourg: Vicky Leandros - L'amour est bleu\n\nMy favourite of 1967. Strong melody, beautiful voice, and intricate instrumentation (percussion and strings especially). Simply magical. It goes for the “wall of sound” feel. So it sounds pretty 60's to me. A cover even topped the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAustria: Peter Horton - Warum es hunderttausend Sterne gibt\n\nDull.\n\nFrance: Noëlle Cordier - Il doit faire beau là-bas\n\nGentle, melancholic verses with a typical vocal chorus.\n\nPortugal: Eduardo Nascimento - O vento mudou\n\nPortugal submits a black performer to score political points. The baritone sounds fresh.\n\nSwitzerland: Géraldine - Quel cœur vas-tu briser?\n\nAn honest female ballad, but it feels flat.\n\nSweden: Östen Warnerbring - Som en dröm\n\nA cinematic ballad.\n\nFinland: Fredi - Varjoon – suojaan\n\nFredi has a unique raspy voice, while the chorus employs a commanding, marching beat.\n\nWest Germany: Inge Brück - Anouschka\n\nHopeful and sufficiently melodic.\n\nBelgium: Louis Neefs - Ik heb zorgen\n\nA catchy, memorable, bellowing chorus. There's also an unexpected fake finish.\n\nUK: Sandie Shaw - Puppet on a String\n\nWINNER (see below)\n\nSpain: Raphael - Hablemos del amor\n\nRaphael represents Spain for the second year in a row with a passionate, intense belter.\n\nNorway: Kirsti Sparboe - Dukkemann\n\nBreezy, uplifting and melodic.\n\nMonaco: Minouche Barelli - Boum-Badaboum\n\nThe performance contains a bunch of “boom boom”'s and backwards counting. Minouche sounds off-key though.\n\nYugoslavia: Lado Leskovar - Vse rože sveta\n\nA standard male ballad, aside from the monologue and trumpet solo.\n\nItaly: Claudio Villa - Non andare più lontano\n\nItaly goes opera, overdramatic vocals and all – I don't care about opera.\n\nIreland: Sean Dunphy - If I Could Choose\n\nIreland submits another bland thing, which somehow finishes in 2nd place.\n\nThe Winner\n\nSo the UK finally earned their first win after 5 second-place finishes. Britain had now cemented its place at the forefront of Eurovision; where it would remain until the 21st century. “Puppet” is a fitting example of the UK's cynical contempt towards the contest. The country has a vibrant music scene known for pushing boundaries, especially in the mid 60's. Eurovision is the opposite of that, so the UK looks down on it. Often they submit utter trash thinking that's what Europe wants. Indeed, Sandie hated “Puppet” when she first heard it. Still, Sandie's success inspired the UK to send established artists for the next decade. (Sandie having earned two UK #1's before “Puppet”).\n\n“Puppet on a String” is a conflicting song to rate. Like it's either TRASH or SMASH. The lyrics are problematic. Sandie is proud to be a doormat for this guy. And the circus-y farting horn instrumentation is too cutesy. That said, “Puppet” is one catchy bop isn't it? The way Sandie jumps out – IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII wonder if one day THAT you'll say THAT you care. She drills that hook into your head. The marching circus beat sticks with you. The pre-chorus elevation is melodically strong. And “Puppet” is the most bright and colourful Eurovision entry thus far.\n\nVerdict: Weighing the good and the bad, I'll settle on “I like it”\n\nMy points go to....\n\n01.
