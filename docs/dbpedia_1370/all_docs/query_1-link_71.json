        "text": "Format\n\nEach country had 10 jury members who distributed three points among their one, two, or three favourite songs. The points were totaled and the first, second, and third placed songs were awarded 5, 3, and 1 votes in order. If only one song got every point within the jury it would get all 9 points. If only two songs were chosen, the songs would get 6 and 3 points in order.[4]\n\nA political protest occurred after the Swiss entry: a man trespassed onto the stage holding a banner that read \"Boycott Franco & Salazar\". Whilst this was going on, television viewers were shown a shot of the scoreboard; once the man was removed the contest went on.[5]\n\nThe immediate response of the Koncertsal audience to the Italian entry was markedly enthusiastic and prolonged and, most unusually for a contest performance, after leaving the stage Gigliola Cinquetti was allowed to return to take a second bow. Her performance was given an unscheduled repeat on British television the following afternoon. In the event, she won the most crushing victory in the history of the contest, with a score almost three times that of her nearest rival, a feat extremely unlikely ever to be beaten under the post-1974 scoring system.\n\nLost recordings\n\nAs with the 1956 contest, no complete video recording of the actual contest performance was known to survive; however, unlike the 1956 contest (where the interval act is mostly missing), a complete audio recording does exist in the form of the DR radio broadcast. Some clips of the contest survive, including part of the opening ceremonies, including some of presenter Lotte WÃ¦vers welcoming remarks, as well as the majority of the repeat perfomance of \"Non ho l'etÃ \" from the end of the broadcast. A copy of the entire contest is claimed to exist in the French television archives, although this is currently unconfirmed. [6] A persistant myth, even repeated on the official Eurovision site, is that the tape was destroyed in a fire in the 1970s. More recent interviews with DR, however, state that the broadcast was never recorded in the first place, allegedly due to no tape machines being available at the studio.[7]. The audio of the entire show, however, is still available online, and fan reconstructions using available clips, press-photos and other sources have been made.[8] In 2013, fan channel ESCplus released the full reprise of the winning song in Germany, edited together using recently recovered footage from Germany.[9]"
