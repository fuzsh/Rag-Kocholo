At the local Church of St. Francis, he became a pupil of the famed musician, Friar Giovanni Battista Martini, O.F.M. Conv., a member of the Franciscan community attached to the church. He also followed Martini's example and entered the Conventual Franciscans. Following his period of novitiate, he was named his mentor's assistant and substitute conductor of the famed ..... choir at the church and succeeded him in that position upon his death in 1784.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mattei continued as choir director at the Church of St. Francis until 1809. He then moved briefly to Padua, where he served in that function for the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua, operated by his religious Order. This situation was temporary, however as he soon returned to Bologna, where he became the music director at the Church of St. Petronius.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]During the occupation of Italy by the French Revolutionary Army, the friary was suppressed and the community of friars scattered. Mattei then went to live with his mother, supporting himself by giving private instruction.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mattei's music bears a close resemblance to the style of composition of Martini, his mentor.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mattei himself composed over 300 works of sacred music, a body of work which remains largely unpublished. He also composed some secular vocal pieces and symphonies. In 1804 he was appointed as a professor at the Liceo Musicale di Bologna (now the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini), where he had among his pupils Gaetano Donizetti, Yevstigney Fomin, Angelo Mariani, Francesco Morlacchi, Luigi Felice Rossi, Gioachino Rossini, Giovanni Tadolini, and Christian Theodor Weinlig.

Later in the 1780s, he became organist at the Carmelite church in Leopoldstadt. He collaborated with Emanuel Schikaneder on a number of Singspiele in the 1790s, working in the Theater auf der Wieden. He died in Fünfkirchen (Hungarian: Pécs), southern Royal Hungary, Imperial Austria.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He wrote operas, one wind quintet, three string quartets, and served as a Kapellmeister at several churches.

Though his father expected him to continue in the print-selling business, he also allowed his son to learn how to play several musical instruments. His first teacher was the Tirolean composer, Josef Alois Ladurner. At the age of 20 Auber was sent to London for business training, but he was obliged to leave England in 1804 when the Treaty of Amiens was breached.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Auber had already attempted musical composition, and at this period produced several concertos pour basse, modelled after the violoncellist Lamare, in whose name they were published. The praise given to his concerto for the violin, which was played at the Paris Conservatoire by Mazas, encouraged him to undertake a resetting of an old comic opera, Julie (1811). He also began to study with the renowned Luigi Cherubini.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1813 the unfavourable reception of his one-act debut opera Le Séjour militaire put an end for some years to his attempts as composer. But his failure in business, and the death of his father in 1819, compelled him once more to turn to music. He produced another opera, Le Testament et les billets-doux (1819), which was no better received than the former. But he persevered, and the next year was rewarded by the complete success of La Bergère châtelaine, an opera in three acts.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]This was the first in a long series of brilliant successes. In 1822 began his long association with librettist Eugène Scribe. Their first opera, Leicester, shows evidence of the influence of Gioachino Rossini in its musical style. Auber soon developed his own voice, however: light, vivacious, graceful, and melodious—characteristically French. Le maçon (1825) was his first major triumph, staying in the repertory until the 20th century, with 525 performances at the Opéra-Comique alone. An ensemble from the latter found its way into Herold's ballet La Somnambule (source of Bellini's La sonnambula) as an air parlante (a way of explicating the plot through the words of a relevant operatic aria or salon piece).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Auber achieved another triumph in La muette de Portici, also known as Masaniello after its hero. Produced in Paris in 1828, it rapidly became a European favourite, and the foundation work of a new genre, grand opera, that was consolidated by Rossini's Guillaume Tell the following year. Its characteristic features are a private drama staged in the context of a significant historical event in which the chorus is dramatically engaged as a representative of the people, varied and piquant musical textures, grandiloquent marches, spectacular scenic effects and a statutory ballet. The duet from La Muette, Amour sacré de la patrie (meaning \"Sacred Love of the Homeland\"), was welcomed as a new Marseillaise; its performance at Brussels on 25 August 1830, in which the great tenor Adolphe Nourrit sang the leading tenor role, engendered a riot that became the signal for the Belgian Revolution that drove out the Dutch. La Muette broke ground also in its use of a ballerina in a leading role (the eponymous mute), and includes long passages of mime music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Official and other dignities testified to the public appreciation of Auber's works. In 1829 he was elected a member of the Institut de France. Fra Diavolo,which premiered on 28 January 1830, was his most successful opera. That same year, 1830, he was named director of the court concerts. Next year, on 20 June 1831, he had another big success, with Le Philtre, starring Adolphe Nourrit. The libretto was translated into Italian and set by Donizetti as L'elisir d'amore, one of the most successful comic operas of all time.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Two years later, on 27 February 1833, Gustave III, his second grand opera, also triumphed and stayed in the repertory for years. The libretto was to be used twice more, first by Saverio Mercadante for Il reggente, with the action transferred to Scotland, and, next by Giuseppe Verdi, as Un ballo in maschera. He enjoyed several more successes, all at the Opéra-Comique. [/FONT][FONT=&quot]These were Le cheval de bronze (1835), L'Ambassadrice (1836), Le domino noir (1837), Les diamants de la couronne (1841) and La part du diable (1843).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the meantime, in 1842, at the wish of King Louis Philippe, he succeeded Cherubini as director of the Conservatoire. Auber was also a member of the Legion of Honour from 1825, and attained the rank of commander in 1847. That year also saw the premiere of Haydée, another opéra comique, even though it was on a serious subject. The tenor lead in Haydée was sung by the same Gustave-Hippolyte Roger who, two years later, created the title role in Giacomo Meyerbeer's Le prophète at the Opéra. Napoleon III made Auber his Imperial Maître de Chapelle in 1857.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In his later years, Auber's output slowed down considerably. The 1850s were marked by Manon Lescaut, an opéra comique with a tragic end (1856), and revisions of Le cheval de bronze and Fra Diavolo (both 1857). He had one major success in the 1860s: Le premier jour de bonheur (Opéra comique, 1868). Despite his slowdown in composing, he remained a well-loved figure, known for witty sayings and personal generosity. He survived the German siege of Paris in 1870–71, but died during the upheaval of the Paris Commune on 12 or 13 May 1871.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Today, the rue Auber leads up to the Paris Opera House and the nearest RER station is called Auber.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1884 - Bedrich Friedrich Smetana, Czech composer (2 Widows), dies at 60.\n\nSmetana was a Czech composer who pioneered the development of a musical style which became closely identified with his country's aspirations to independent statehood. He is thus widely regarded in his homeland as the father of Czech music. Internationally he is best known for his opera The Bartered Bride, for the symphonic cycle Má vlast (\"My Fatherland\") which portrays the history, legends and landscape of the composer's native land, and for his First String Quartet From My Life.\n\nSmetana was naturally gifted as a pianist, and gave his first public performance at the age of six. After his conventional schooling, he studied music under Josef Proksch in Prague. His first nationalistic music was written during the 1848 Prague uprising, in which he briefly participated. After failing to establish his career in Prague, he left for Sweden, where he set up as a teacher and choirmaster in Gothenburg, and began to write large-scale orchestral works. During this period of his life Smetana was twice married; of six daughters, three died in infancy.\n\nIn the early 1860s, a more liberal political climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague. He threw himself into the musical life of the city, primarily as a champion of the new genre of Czech opera. In 1866 his first two operas, The Brandenburgers in Bohemia and The Bartered Bride, were premiered at Prague's new Provisional Theatre, the latter achieving great popularity. In that same year, Smetana became the theatre's principal conductor, but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. Factions within the city's musical establishment considered his identification with the progressive ideas of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner inimical to the development of a distinctively Czech opera style. This opposition interfered with his creative work, and may have hastened the health breakdown which precipitated his resignation from the theatre in 1874.\n\nBy the end of 1874, Smetana had become completely deaf but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, he began a period of sustained composition that continued for almost the rest of his life. His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum, and his subsequent death. Smetana's reputation as the founding father of Czech music has endured in his native country, where advocates have raised his status above that of his contemporaries and successors. However, relatively few of Smetana's works are in the international repertory, and most foreign commentators tend to regard Antonín Dvořák as a more significant Czech composer.\n\nBedřich Smetana was born as Friedrich Smetana on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl, east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech, but for business and social reasons rarely used it, and his children were ignorant of it until much later in their lives.\n\nFrantišek had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.\n\nThe elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and was a competent violinist who played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia – the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \"Little Galop\"), survives in sketch form.\n\nIn 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia. There being no suitable local school, Smetana was sent to the gymnasium at Jihlava, where he was homesick and unable to study. He then transferred to the Premonstratensian school at Německý Brod, where he was happier and made good progress. Among the friends he made here was the future Czech revolutionary poet Karel Havlíček, whose departure for Prague in 1838 may have influenced Smetana's own desire to experience life in the capital. The following year, with František's approval, he enrolled at Prague's Academic Grammar School under Josef Jungmann, a distinguished poet and linguist who was a leading figure in the movement for Czech national revival.\n\nSmetana arrived in Prague in the autumn of 1839. Finding Jungmann's school uncongenial (he was mocked by his classmates for his country manners), Smetana soon began missing classes. He attended concerts, visited the opera, listened to military bands and joined an amateur string quartet for whom he composed simple pieces. After Liszt gave a series of piano recitals in the city, Smetana became convinced that he would find satisfaction only in a musical career. He confided to his journal that he wanted \"to become a Mozart in composition and a Liszt in technique\". However, the Prague idyll ended when František discovered his son's truancy, and removed him from the city. František at this time saw music as a diverting pastime, not as a career choice. Smetana was placed temporarily with his uncle in Nové Město, where he enjoyed a brief romance with his cousin Louisa. He commemorated their passion in Louisa's Polka, Smetana's earliest complete composition that has survived.\n\nBy the time Smetana completed his schooling, his father's fortunes had declined. Although František now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support. In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty gulden, and no immediate prospects. Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kateřina Kolářová's mother to Josef Proksch, head of the Prague Music Institute – where Kateřina was now studying. Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on Beethoven, Chopin, Berlioz and the Leipzig circle of Liszt. In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.\n\nFor the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, bagatelles, impromptus and the G minor Piano Sonata. In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French master at a reception arranged by Proksch. At the home of Count Thun he met Robert and Clara Schumann, and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work – they detected too much of Berlioz in it. Meanwhile his friendship with Kateřina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then set out on a tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist.\n\nSmetana's concert tour to Western Bohemia was poorly supported, so he abandoned it and returned to Prague, where he made a living from private pupils and occasional appearances as an accompanist in chamber concerts. He also began work on his first major orchestral work, the Overture in D major.\n\nA depiction of the barricades on the Charles Bridge, Prague, 1848. Smetana was briefly a participant in the uprising.\n\nFor a brief period in 1848, Smetana was a revolutionary. In the climate of political change and upheaval that swept through Europe in that year, a pro-democracy movement in Prague led by Smetana's old friend Karel Havlíček was urging an end to Habsburg absolutist rule and for more political autonomy. A Citizens' Army (\"Svornost\") was formed to defend the city against possible attack. Smetana wrote a series of patriotic works, including two marches dedicated respectively to the Czech National Guard and the Students' Legion of the University of Prague, and The Song of Freedom to words by Ján Kollár. In June 1848, as the Habsburg armies moved to suppress rebellious tendencies, Prague came under attack from the Austrian forces led by the Prince of Windisch-Grätz. As a member of Svornost, Smetana helped to man the barricades on the Charles Bridge. The nascent uprising was quickly crushed, but Smetana avoided the imprisonment or exile received by leaders such as Havlíček. During his brief spell with Svornost, he met the writer and leading radical, Karel Sabina, who would later provide libretti for Smetana's first two operas.\n\nPiano Institute\n\nEarly in 1848, Smetana wrote to Franz Liszt, whom he had not yet met, asking him to accept the dedication of a new piano work, Six Characteristic Pieces, and recommend it to a publisher. He also requested a loan of 400 gulden, to enable him to open a music school. Liszt replied cordially, accepting the dedication and promising to help find a publisher, but he offered no financial assistance. This encouragement was the beginning of a friendship that was of great value to Smetana in his subsequent career. Despite Liszt's lack of financial support, Smetana was able to start a Piano Institute in late August 1848, with twelve students. After a period of struggle the Institute began to flourish and became briefly fashionable, particularly among supporters of Czech nationalism in whose eyes Smetana was developing a reputation. Proksch wrote of Smetana's support for his people's cause, and said that he \"could well become the transformer of my ideas in the Czech language.\" In 1849 the Institute was relocated to the home of Kateřina's parents, and began to attract distinguished visitors; Liszt came regularly, and the former emperor Ferdinand, who had settled in Prague, attended the school's matinée concerts. Smetana's performances in these concerts became a recognised feature of Prague's musical life. In this time of relative financial stability Smetana married Kateřina, on 27 August 1849. Four daughters were born to the couple between 1851 and 1855.\n\nBudding composer\n\nIn 1850, notwithstanding his revolutionary sentiments, Smetana accepted the post of Court Pianist in Ferdinand's establishment in Prague Castle. He continued teaching in the Piano Institute, and devoted himself increasingly to composition. His works, mainly for the piano, included the three-part Wedding Scenes, some of the music of which was later used in The Bartered Bride. He also wrote numerous short experimental pieces collected under the name Album Leaves, and a series of polkas. During 1853–54 he worked on a major orchestral piece, the Triumphal Symphony, composed to commemorate the wedding of Emperor Franz Joseph. The symphony was rejected by the Imperial Court, possibly on the grounds that the brief musical references to the Austrian national anthem were not sufficiently prominent. Undeterred, Smetana hired an orchestra at his own expense to perform the symphony at the Konvikt Hall in Prague on 26 February 1855. The work was coolly received, and the concert was a financial failure.\n\nIn the years between 1854 and 1856 Smetana suffered a series of personal blows. In July 1854 his second daughter, Gabriela, died of tuberculosis. A year later his eldest daughter Bedřiška, who at the age of four was showing signs of musical precocity, died of scarlet fever. Smetana wrote his Piano Trio in G minor as a tribute to her memory; it was performed in Prague on 3 December 1855 and, according to the composer, was received \"harshly\" by the critics, although Liszt praised it. Smetana's sorrows continued; just after Bedřiška's death a fourth daughter, Kateřina, had been born but she, too, died in June 1856. By this time Smetana's wife Kateřina had also been diagnosed with tuberculosis.\n\nIn July 1856, Smetana received news of the death in exile of his revolutionary friend Karel Havlíček. The political climate in Prague was a further source of gloom; hopes of a more enlightened government and social reform following Franz Joseph's accession in 1848 had faded as Austrian absolutism reasserted itself under Baron Alexander von Bach. Despite the good name of the Piano Institute, Smetana's status as a concert pianist was generally considered to be below that of contemporaries such as Alexander Dreyschock. Critics acknowledged Smetana's \"delicate, crystalline touch\", closer in style to Chopin than Liszt, but believed that his physical frailty was a serious drawback to his concert-playing ambitions. His main performance success during this period was his playing of Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto at a concert celebrating the centenary of Mozart's birth, in January 1856. His disenchantment with Prague was growing and, perhaps influenced by Dreyschock's accounts of opportunities to be found in Sweden, Smetana decided to seek success there. On 11 October 1856, after writing to his parents that \"Prague did not wish to acknowledge me, so I left it\", he departed for Gothenburg.\n\nSmetana initially went to Gothenburg without Kateřina. Writing to Liszt, he said that the people there were musically unsophisticated, but he saw this as an opportunity \"for an impact I could never have achieved in Prague.\" Within a few weeks of his arrival he had given his first recital, opened a music school which was rapidly overwhelmed by applications, and become conductor of the Gothenburg Society for Classical Choral Music. In a few months Smetana had achieved both professional and social recognition in the city, although he found little time for composition; two intended orchestral works, provisionally entitled Frithjof and The Viking's Voyage, were sketched but abandoned.\n\nGothenburg, Sweden, Smetana's base between 1856 and 1861\n\nIn summer 1857, Smetana came home to Prague and found Kateřina in failing health. In June, Smetana's father František died. That autumn Smetana returned to Gothenburg, with Kateřina and their surviving daughter Žofie, but before doing so he visited Liszt in Weimar. The occasion was the Karl August Goethe-Schiller Jubilee celebrations; Smetana attended performances of Liszt's Faust Symphony and the symphonic poem Die Ideale, which invigorated and inspired him. Liszt was Smetana's principal teacher throughout the latter's creative life, and at this time was crucially able to revive his spirits and rescue him from the relative artistic isolation of Gothenburg.\n\nBack in Sweden, Smetana found among his new pupils a young housewife, Fröjda Benecke, who briefly became his muse and his mistress. In her honour Smetana transcribed two songs from Schubert's Die schöne Müllerin cycle, and transformed one of his own early piano pieces into a polka entitled Vision at the Ball. He also began composing on a more expansive scale. In 1858 he completed the symphonic poem Richard III, his first major orchestral composition since the Triumphal Symphony. He followed this with Wallenstein's Camp, inspired by Friedrich Schiller's Wallenstein drama trilogy, and began a third symphonic poem Hakon Jarl, based on the tragic drama by Danish poet Adam Oehlenschläger. Smetana also wrote two large-scale piano works: Macbeth and the Witches, and an Étude in C in the style of Liszt.\n\nKateřina's health gradually worsened and in the spring of 1859 failed completely. Homeward bound, she died at Dresden on 19 April 1859. Smetana wrote that she had died \"gently, without our knowing anything until the quiet drew my attention to her.\" After placing Žofie with Kateřina's mother, Smetana spent time with Liszt in Weimar, where he was introduced to the music of the comic opera Der Barbier von Bagdad, by Liszt's pupil Peter Cornelius. This work would influence Smetana's own later career as an opera composer. Later that year he stayed with his younger brother Karel, and fell in love with Karel's sister-in-law Barbora (Bettina) Ferdinandiová, sixteen years his junior. He proposed marriage, and having secured her promise returned to Gothenburg for the 1859–60 winter. The marriage took place the following year, on 10 July 1860, after which Smetana and his new wife returned to Sweden for a final season. This culminated in April 1861 with a piano performance in Stockholm, attended by the Swedish royal family. The couple's first daughter, Zdeňka, was born in September 1861.\n\nMeanwhile, the defeat of Franz Joseph's army at Solferino in 1859 had weakened the Habsburg Empire, and led to the fall from power of von Bach. This had gradually brought a more enlightened atmosphere to Prague, and by 1861 Smetana was seeing prospects of a better future for Czech nationalism and culture. Before deciding his own future, in September Smetana set out on a concert tour of Holland and Germany. He was still hoping to secure a reputation as a pianist, but once again he experienced failure. Back in Prague, he conducted performances of Richard III and Wallenstein's Camp in the Žofín Island concert hall in January 1862, to a muted reception. Critics accused him of adhering too closely to the \"New German\" school represented primarily by Liszt; Smetana responded that \"a prophet is without honour in his own land.\" In March 1862 he made a last brief visit to Gothenburg, but the city no longer held his interest; it appeared to him a provincial backwater and, whatever the difficulties, he now determined to seek his musical future in Prague: \"My home has rooted itself into my heart so much that only there do I find real contentment. It is to this that I will sacrifice myself.\"\n\nIn 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \"dangerous modernist\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist,[55] and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nAt this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863.[58] In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper Národní listy. Meanwhile, Bettina had given birth to another daughter, Božena.\n\nOn 23 April 1864, Smetana conducted Berlioz's choral symphony Roméo et Juliette at a concert celebrating the Shakespeare tercentenary, adding to the programme his own March for the Shakespearean Festival. That year, Smetana's bid to become Director of the Prague Conservatory failed. He had set high hopes on this appointment: \"My friends are trying to persuade me that this post might have been especially created for me,\" he wrote to a Swedish friend. His hopes were again dashed by his affiliation with the perceived radical Liszt, the appointing committee choosing the conservative patriot Josef Krejčí for the post.\n\nAlmost three years passed before Smetana was declared the winner of Harrach's opera competition. Before then, on 5 January 1866, The Brandenburgers had been performed to an enthusiastic reception at the Provisional Theatre—over strong opposition from Maýr, who had refused to rehearse or conduct the piece. The idiom was too advanced for Maýr's liking, and the opera was eventually staged under the composer's own direction. \"I was called on stage nine times,\" Smetana wrote, recording that the house was sold out and that the critics were full of praise. Music historian Rosa Newmarch believes that, although The Brandenburgers has not stood the test of time, it contains all the germs of Smetana's operatic art.\n\nIn July 1863, Sabina had delivered the libretto for a second opera, a light comedy entitled The Bartered Bride, which Smetana composed during the next three years. Because of the success of The Brandenburgers, the management of the Provisional Theatre readily agreed to stage the new opera, which was premiered on 30 May 1866 in its original two-act version with spoken dialogue. The opera was to go through several revisions and restructures before reaching the definitive three-act form that in due course established Smetana's international reputation. The opera's first performance was a failure; it was held on one of the hottest evenings of the year, on the eve of the Austro-Prussian War with Bohemia under imminent threat of invasion by Prussian troops. Unsurprisingly the occasion was poorly attended, and receipts failed to cover costs. When presented at the Provisional Theatre in its final form, in September 1870, it was a tremendous public success.\n\nBack in 1866, as the composer of The Brandenburgers with its overtones of German military aggression, Smetana thought he might be targeted by the invading Prussians, so he absented himself from Prague until hostilities ceased. He returned in September, and almost immediately achieved a long-standing ambition – appointment as principal conductor of the Provisional Theatre, at an annual salary of 1,200 gulden. In the absence of a body of suitable Czech opera, Smetana in his first season presented standard works by Weber, Mozart, Donizetti, Rossini and Glinka, with a revival of his own Bartered Bride. The quality of Smetana's production of Glinka's A Life for the Tsar angered Glinka's champion Mily Balakirev, who expressed himself forcefully. This caused prolonged hostility between the two men. On 16 May 1868 Smetana, representing Czech musicians, helped to lay the foundation stone for the future National Theatre; he had written a Festive Overture for the occasion. That same evening Smetana's third opera, Dalibor, was premièred at Prague's New Town Theatre. Although its initial reception was warm its reviews were poor, and Smetana resigned himself to its failure. This opera soon became the basis of a series of attacks on Smetana, followed by a concerted effort to drive him from his position as Provisional Theatre conductor.\n\nOpposition\n\nEarly in his conductorship Smetana had made a powerful enemy in František Pivoda, the Director of the Prague School of Singing. Formerly a supporter of Smetana's, Pivoda was aggrieved when the conductor recruited singing talent from abroad rather than from Pivoda's school. In an increasingly bitter public correspondence, Pivoda claimed that Smetana was using his position to further his own career, at the expense of other composers.\n\nPivoda then took issue with Dalibor, calling it an example of extreme \"Wagnerism\" and thus, unsuited as a model for Czech national opera. \"Wagnerism\" meant the adoption of Wagner's theories of a continuous role for the orchestra and the building of an integrated musical drama, rather than a stringing together of lyrical numbers. The Provisional Theatre's chairman, František Rieger, had first accused Smetana of Wagnerist tendencies after the first performance of The Brandenburgers, and the issue eventually divided Prague's musical society. Music critic Otakar Hostinský believed that Wagner's theories should be the basis of the national opera, and argued that Dalibor was the beginning of the \"correct\" direction. The opposite camp, led by Pivoda, supported the principles of Italian opera, in which the voice rather than the orchestra was the predominant dramatic device.\n\nEven within the theatre itself there was division. Rieger led a campaign to eject Smetana from the conductorship and reappoint Maýr, and in December 1872 a petition signed by 86 subscribers to the theatre called for Smetana's resignation. Strong support from vice-chairman Antonín Čísek, and an ultimatum from prominent musicians among whom was Antonín Dvořák, ensured Smetana's survival. In January 1873 he was reappointed, with a bigger salary and increased responsibility as Artistic Director.\n\nSmetana gradually brought more operas by emergent Czech composers to the theatre, but little of his own work. By 1872 he had completed his monumental fourth opera, Libuše, his most ambitious work to date, but was withholding its premiere for the future opening of the National Theatre. The machinations of Pivoda and his supporters distracted Smetana from composition, and he had further vexation when The Bartered Bride was produced in Saint Petersburg, in January 1871. Although the audience was enthusiastic, press reports were hostile, one describing the work as \"no better than that of a gifted fourteen-year-old boy.\" Smetana was deeply offended, and blamed his old adversary, Balakirev, for inciting negative feelings against the opera.\n\nIn the respite following his reappointment, Smetana concentrated on his fifth opera, The Two Widows, composed between June 1873 and January 1874. After its first performance at the Provisional Theatre on 27 March 1874, Smetana's supporters presented him with a decorative baton. But his opponents continued to attack him, comparing his conductorship unfavourably with the Maýr regime and claiming that under Smetana \"Czech opera sickens to death at least once annually.\" By the summer Smetana was ill; a throat infection was followed by a rash and an apparent blockage to the ears. By mid-August, unable to work, he transferred his duties to his deputy, Adolf Čech. A press announcement stated that Smetana had \"become ill as a result of nervous strain caused by certain people recently.\"\n\nIn September, Smetana told the theatre he would resign his appointment unless his health improved. He had become totally deaf in his right ear, and in October lost all hearing in his left ear also. After his subsequent resignation the theatre offered him an annual pension of 1,200 gulden for the continued right to perform his operas, an arrangement which Smetana reluctantly accepted. Money raised in Prague by former students, and by former lover Fröjda Benecke in Gothenburg, amounted to 1,244 gulden. This allowed Smetana to seek medical treatment abroad, but to no avail. In January 1875 Smetana wrote in his journal: \"If my disease is incurable, then I should prefer to be liberated from this life.\" His spirits were further lowered at this time by a deterioration in his relationship with Bettina, mainly over money matters. \"I cannot live under the same roof as a person who hates and persecutes me\", Smetana informed her. Although divorce was considered, the couple stayed unhappily together.\n\nIn worsening health, Smetana continued to compose. In June 1876 he, Bettina and their two daughters left Prague for Jabkenice, the home of his eldest daughter Žofie where, in tranquil surroundings, Smetana was able to work undisturbed. Before leaving Prague he had begun a cycle of six symphonic poems, called Má vlast (\"My Fatherland\"), and had completed the first two, Vyšehrad and Vltava, which had both been performed in Prague during 1875.[90] In Jabkenice Smetana composed four more movements, the complete cycle being first performed on 5 November 1882 under the baton of Adolf Čech.[ Other major works composed in these years were the E minor String Quartet, From My Life, a series of Czech dances for piano, several choral pieces and three more operas: The Kiss, The Secret and The Devil's Wall, all of which received their first performances between 1876 and 1882.\n\nThe long-delayed premiere of Smetana's opera Libuše finally arrived when the National Theatre opened on 11 June 1881. He had not initially been given tickets, but at the last minute was asked into the theatre director's box. The audience received the work enthusiastically, and Smetana was called to the stage repeatedly. Shortly after this event the new theatre was destroyed by fire; despite his infirmities, Smetana helped to raise funds for the rebuilding. The restored theatre reopened on 18 November 1883, again with Libuše.\n\nThese years saw Smetana's growing recognition as the principal exponent of Czech national music. This status was celebrated by several events during Smetana's final years. On 4 January 1880, a special concert in Prague marked the 50th anniversary of his first public performance; Smetana attended, and played his Piano Trio in G minor from 1855. In May 1882 The Bartered Bride was given its 100th performance, an unprecedented event in the history of Czech opera, and so popular that a repeat \"100th performance\" was staged. A gala concert and banquet was arranged to honour Smetana's 60th birthday in March 1884, but he was too ill to attend.\n\nIn 1879, Smetana had written to a friend, the Czech poet Jan Neruda, revealing fears of the onset of madness. By the winter of 1882–83 he was experiencing depression, insomnia, and hallucinations, together with giddiness, cramp and a temporary loss of speech. In 1883 he began writing a new symphonic suite, Prague Carnival, but could get no further than an Introduction and a Polonaise. He started a new opera, Viola, based on the character in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, but wrote only fragments as his mental state gradually deteriorated. In October 1883 his behaviour at a private reception in Prague disturbed his friends; by the middle of February 1884 he had ceased to be coherent, and was periodically violent. On 23 April his family, unable to nurse him any longer, removed him to the Kateřinky Lunatic Asylum in Prague, where he died on 12 May 1884.\n\nThe hospital registered the cause of death as senile dementia. However, Smetana's family believed that his physical and mental decline was due to syphilis. An analysis of the autopsy report, published by the German neurologist Dr Ernst Levin in 1972, came to the same conclusion. Tests carried out by Prof. Emanuel Vlček in the late 20th century on samples of muscular tissue from Smetana's exhumed body provided further evidence of the disease. However, this research has been challenged by Czech physician Dr Jiří Ramba, who has argued that Vlček's tests do not provide a basis for a reliable conclusion, citing the age and state of the tissues and highlighting reported symptoms of Smetana's that were incompatible with syphilis.\n\nSmetana's funeral took place on 15 May, at the Týn Church in Prague's Old Town. The subsequent procession to the Vyšehrad Cemetery was led by members of the Hlahol, bearing torches, and was followed by a large crowd. The grave later became a place of pilgrimage for musical visitors to Prague.[101] On the funeral evening, a scheduled performance of The Bartered Bride at the National Theatre was allowed to proceed, the stage draped with black cloth as a mark of respect.\n\nSmetana was survived by Bettina, their daughters Zdeňka and Božena, and by Žofie. None of them played any significant role in Smetana's musical life. Bettina lived until 1908; Žofie, who had married Josef Schwarz in 1874, predeceased her stepmother, dying in 1902. The younger daughters eventually married, living out their lives away from the public eye. A permanent memorial to Smetana's life and work is the Smetana Museum in Prague, originally founded in 1926 within the Charles University's Institute for Musicology. In 1936 the museum moved to the former Waterworks building on the banks of the Vltava, and since 1976 has been part of the Czech Museum of Music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]12 May[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 1 of 3[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]12 May[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 2 of 3\n\nin 1886 - Hermann Grabner, composer is born.\n\nin 1887 - Nandor Zsolt, composer is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1896 - Juan Morel Campos, composer, dies at 38.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Sometimes erroneously spelled Juan Morell Campos, he was a Puerto Rican composer, considered by many to be responsible for taking the genre of danza to its highest level.

Núñez (1850 - 1915), whose students also included the internationally-known musicians and composers Manuel Gregorio Tavárez and Arístides Chavier Arévalo. Morel Campos learned to play practically every brass instrument and eventually became one of the founders and directors of the \"Ponce Firemen's Band\" (La Banda de Bomberos del Parque de Bombas de Ponce). The legendary Band was later renamed the Ponce Municipal Band.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Later, Morel Campos became a student of the composer Manuel Gregorio Tavárez, \"The Father of the Danza\".

Thereafter he toured all over Europe and America, sometimes playing duets with Henri Vieuxtemps or Henryk Wieniawski. At age 15, he performed in New York and critic Richard Storrs Willis attended \"out of curiosity to see the sort of child that tickles Europe\".

As violinist Arnold Steinhardt recounts, a legend was passed down through the Ysaÿe family about the first violin brought to the lineage:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] It was told of a boy whom some woodcutters found in the forest and brought to the village. The boy grew up to be a blacksmith. Once, at a village festival, he astonished everyone by playing the viol beautifully. From then on the villagers took pleasure in dancing and singing to the strains of his viol. One day an illustrious stranger stopped in front of the smithy to have his horse shod. The count's servant saw the viol inside and told the young smith that he had heard a new Italian instrument played by some minstrels at the count's court. That instrument, called the violin, was much better than the viol – its tone was like the human voice and could express every feeling and passion. From that moment the young man no longer took pleasure in his viol. Day and night he was thinking of that wonderful new instrument that could express joy and sorrow and whose tones went straight to the human heart. Then he had a dream: he saw before him a young woman of indescribable beauty, not unlike his own love, Bienthline. She came to him and kissed his brow. The young man awoke and looked at the wall his broken and neglected viol used to hang on and could barely believe his eyes: there, instead of the viol, was a new instrument of beautiful proportions. He put it against his shoulder and drew the bow over the strings, producing sounds that were truly divine. The violin sang in a heartwarming tone: it rejoiced and wept for happiness – and so did the musician. Thus, goes the legend, came the first violin to the Ardennes and to the Ysaÿe family.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Born in Liège, Ysaÿe began violin lessons at age five with his father. He would later recognize his father's teaching as the foundation of everything he knew on his instrument, even though he went on to study with highly reputed masters. At seven he entered the Conservatoire at Liège studying with Désiré Heynberg 1865-1869, though soon afterwards he was asked to leave the conservatory because of lack of progress. This was because, in order to support his family, young Eugène had to play full-time in two local orchestras, one conducted by his father. Eugène went on playing in these ensembles, though he studied by himself and learned the repertoire of the violin. By the time he was twelve, he was playing so well that one day he was practicing in a cellar when the legendary Henri Vieuxtemps, passing in the street, was so impressed with the sound of his violin that he took an interest in the boy. He arranged for Ysaÿe to be re-admitted to the conservatory studying with Vieuxtemps's assistant, the noted Henryk Wieniawski. Ysaÿe would later also study with Vieuxtemps, and both \"master and disciple\", as Ysaÿe would call the roles of teacher and pupil, were very fond of each other. In his last years, Vieuxtemps asked Ysaÿe to come to the countryside just to play for him.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Studying with these teachers meant that he was part of the so-called Franco-Belgian school of violin playing, which dates back to the development of the modern violin bow by François Tourte. Qualities of this \"École\" included elegance, a full tone with a sense of drawing a \"long\" bow with no jerks, precise left hand techniques, and bowing using the whole forearm while keeping both the wrist and upper arm quiet (as opposed to Joseph Joachim's German school of wrist bowing and Leopold Auer's Russian concept of using the whole arm.)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After his graduation from the Royal Conservatory of Liège, Ysaÿe was the principal violin of the Benjamin Bilse beer-hall orchestra, which later developed into the Berlin Philharmonic. Many musicians of note and influence came regularly to hear this orchestra and Ysaÿe in particular, among whom figured Joseph Joachim, Franz Liszt, Clara Schumann, and Anton Rubinstein, who asked that Ysaÿe be released from his contract to accompany him on tour.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]When Ysaÿe was twenty-seven years old, he was recommended as a soloist for one of the Concerts Colonne in Paris, which was the start of his great success as a concert artist. The next year, Ysaÿe received a professorship at the Brussels Conservatoire in his native Belgium. This began his career as a teacher, which was to remain one of his main occupations after leaving the Conservatoire in 1898 and into his last years. Among his more respected pupils are Josef Gingold, the viola virtuoso William Primrose, the violin virtuoso Nathan Milstein (who primarily studied with Pyotr Stolyarsky), Louis Persinger, Alberto Bachmann, Mathieu Crickboom, Jonny Heykens, Charles Houdret, Jascha Brodsky, Oscar Shumsky and Aldo Ferraresi.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]During his tenure as professor at the Conservatoire, Ysaÿe continued to tour an ever-broadening section of the world, including all of Europe, Russia, and the United States. Despite health concerns, particularly regarding the condition of his hands, Ysaÿe was at his best when performing, and many prominent composers dedicated major works to him, including Claude Debussy, Camille Saint-Saëns, César Franck, and Ernest Chausson. He arranged for violin and orchestra Saint-Saëns's Étude en forme de valse, which had originally been written for solo piano.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mention should be made of Franck's Violin Sonata in A, written as a wedding present for Ysaÿe and his wife in 1886, which Ysaÿe played wherever he went for the rest of his life; and of Chausson's Poème, which was his response to a request for a concerto. Joseph Szigeti considered those two dedications particularly stand out in demonstrating the enormous respect in which Ysaÿe was held.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1886 he established the Ysaÿe Quartet, which premiered Debussy's String Quartet.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]As his physical ailments grew more prohibitive, Ysaÿe turned more to teaching, conducting and an early love, composition. Among his most famous works are the six Sonatas for Solo Violin op. 27, the unaccompanied Sonata for Cello, op. 28, one Sonata for Two Violins, eight Poèmes for various instruments (one or two violins, violin and cello, string quartet) and orchestra (Poème élégiaque, Poème de l'Extase, Chant d'hiver, Poème nocturne, among others), pieces for string orchestra without basses (including Poème de l'Exil), two string trios, a quintet, and an opera, Peter the Miner, written near the end of his life in the Walloon language.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ysaÿe had been offered the post of music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1898, but declined it due to his busy solo performance schedule. In 1918, he accepted the music director's position with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, where he remained until 1922 and with which he made several recordings.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Finally, in 1931, suffering from the extreme ravages of diabetes that had necessitated the amputation of his left foot, Eugène Ysaÿe died in his house in Brussels and was interred in the Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]As a performer, Ysaÿe was compelling and highly original. Pablo Casals claimed never to have heard a violinist play in tune before Ysaÿe, and Carl Flesch called him \"the most outstanding and individual violinist I have ever heard in my life.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ysaÿe possessed a large and flexible tone, influenced by a considerable variety of vibrato — from no vibrato at all to very intense. He said, \"Don't always vibrate, but always be vibrating\". His modus operandi was, in his own words: \"Nothing which wouldn't have for goal emotion, poetry, heart.\" The conductor Sir Henry Wood said, \"The quality of tone was ravishingly beautiful.... He seemed to get more colour out of a violin than any of his contemporaries.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Possibly the most distinctive feature of Ysaÿe's interpretations was his masterful rubato. Sir Henry Wood said, \"Whenever he stole time from one note, he faithfully paid it back within four bars\", allowing his accompanist to maintain strict tempo under his free cantilena. Incidentally, this kind of rubato fits the description of Frédéric Chopin's rubato.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Although Ysaÿe was a great interpreter of late Romantic and early modern composers — Max Bruch, Camille Saint-Saëns, and César Franck, who said he was their greatest interpreter — he was admired for his Bach and Beethoven interpretations. His technique was brilliant and finely honed, and in this respect he is the first modern violinist, whose technique was without the shortcomings of some earlier artists.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]An international violin competition in Brussels was created in his memory: in 1951, this became the violin section of the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Eugène Ysaÿe Collection, housed in the Music Division of the Royal Library of Belgium, combines four decades of purchases with a donation made by the Ysaÿe family in 2007. An essential source for the study of musician's life and works, it includes some 700 letters and autograph scores, over 1,000 printed scores and books, abundant collection of photographs, four films, and about fifty 78 RPM and 33 RPM recordings. A second collection of beautiful handwritten and printed scores is conserved in New York at the Juilliard School.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1940 - Norman Jesse Whitfield (American songwriter and producer; Motown/Whitfield) is born.\n\nin 1941 - Little Jayotis Washington, US RandB singer (Persuasions) is born.\n\nin 1941 - Ruud de Wolff, singer/guitarist (Blue Diamonds) is born.\n\nin 1942 - Billy Swan (US singer-songwriter, bass, keyboards; solo/sessionist) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1942 - Michel Fugain (French singer, songwriter) is born.\n\nin 1942 - Ian Dury (singer, songwriter, poet, actor: The Blockheads) is born.\n\nin 1943 - Billy Swan, Cape Giradeau La, rocker (I Can Help) is born.\n\nin 1943 - David Walker (keyboard, guitar, vocals; Gary Lewis & the Playboys) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1943 - Albert Stoessel, American composer, violinist and conductor, dies at 48.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1894. He studied music at the Berlin Hochschule as a pupil of Emanuel Wirth and Willy Hess. At 19 he began his professional playing career with the Hess String Quartet, and toured as a violin soloist in Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Germany. He returned to the United States in 1915 for a concert tour, appeared with the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and lived in Boston until 1917 while pursuing his career as a violinist and composer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Stoessel enlisted in the United States Army in 1917, becoming a lieutenant in the 301st Infantry American Expeditionary Forces and leader of the regimental band at Camp Devens. Stoessel went to France in 1918 with the 76th Division as bandmaster of the 301st. He became Director of the AEF Bandmaster's School of Chaumont, France, organized by Walter Damrosch.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After his discharge in 1919, Stoessel performed as a soloist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and toured with Enrico Caruso's last tour. In 1921 he became the assistant conductor of the Oratorio Society of New York under Walter Damrosch. For seven years, beginning in 1923, he was the head of the New York University Music Department, from which he was awarded a master's degree in 1924. He left to become director of the departments of opera and orchestra at the Juilliard Graduate School of Music in 1931. He became conductor of the Worcester Festival of the Worcester (Massachusetts) County Musical Association in 1925, and conducted the Westchester Festival in White Plains, New York, from 1927 to 1933. Stoessel first began work with the Chautauqua Institution in 1921 as a conductor, and in 1929 he was appointed Musical Director.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Albert Stoessel composed the opera Garrick in 1936, wrote a treatise in 1919 entitled The Technique of the Baton, and composed a number of violin, piano, choral, and orchestra pieces.

He was a child prodigy, showing a musical aptitude at any early age. His older brother, Joseph Achron, placed him in the St. Petersburg Conservatory. He first studied piano with Nikolay Dubasov; Anna Essipoff; Anatol Liadov in composition; and Maximilian Steinberg in orchestration. He received his \"artist diploma\" in 1915.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He married Lea Karina on June 14, 1935. She was born in Helsinki in 1914. She was a mezzo-soprano who made her singing debut with the Helsingfors Symphony Orchestra in 1931 under the baton of Jean Sibelius.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]As her husband, she was an accomplished pianist. She collaborated with him in composing. She was a singer who could perform vocal repertoire in nine different languages. In 1941 she made her New York debut at Town Hall with her husband accompanying her. She went on to have a successful career in radio and television. She served as audio director for the popular television show \"Your Hit Parade\". Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco and Nicolas Slonimsky were two composers who dedicated songs to her.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After three years of service in the Russian army, Achron graduated from the conservatory in 1918 and went on a concert tour of Russia and Germany. He appeared as soloist with a large symphony orchestra in Pavlovsk, near St. Petersburg. In Berlin he gave four concerts in the course of a single season.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Achron first accompanied Jascha Heifetz as a child prodigy in St. Petersburg in 1909, and subsequently toured and recorded with Jascha Heifetz for over ten years. He accompanied Heifetz on twenty-nine (29) of Heifetz' violin solos for Victor Records.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Achron emigrated to the United States in 1922 and became a citizen of that country in 1928. On March 21, 1923 he received a telegram from Jascha Heifetz offering him a position as accompanist for tour beginning May 1, 1923 terminating May 1, 1924 including tour of the orient. On New Year's Eve 1923 he played in Carnegie Hall as an accompaniment for Jascha Heifetz annual solo violin performance.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]For the next ten years, he served as Heifetz's principal accompanist, recording an extensive discography and performing chamber and solo recitals in major music centers all over the world.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1933 he ended his association with Jascha Heifetz and on November 10, 1933 he appeared at Carnegie Hall as solo pianist. His program encompassed three Bach transcriptions: that of the chaconne by Busoni, the prelude and fugue in A minor by Liszt and the overture from Cantata No. 28 by Saint-Saëns, Haydn's andante with variations, a Chopin group and a concluding section by Borodin, Scriabin and Liszt.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1936 he appeared in recital at the Town Hall, New York. His program included Bach-Liszt's Prelude and Fugue in A minor, two preludes and fugues from Bach's \"Well-Tempered Clavichord\" Beethoven's Sonata, Op. 2, No. 1; a nocturne, two mazurkas and a ballade by Chopin, and a concluding group by Shostakovich, Debussy, Ravel and Liszt. He performed his original works with the New York Philharmonic at Town Hall in December 1937, with Sir John Barbirolli (1899-1979) conducting. On January 17, 1938 he gave a solo performance at Town Hall, and in July 1939 his piano concerto was performed at the City Amateur Symphony Orchestra by Edwin Lunt (then 15 years old). Achron conducted the orchestra.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On January 20, 1940 he and his wife performed at Carnegie Hall for the 4th annual music festival for the Trade Union Division of Jewish Workers and Pioneers in Palestine. On January 16, 1943 he appeared at Town Hall in a joint recital with his wife, mezzo-soprano, Lea Karina. Paul Ulanowsky played accompaniment for Ms. Karina. Again on November 17, 1944 he appeared in a joint recitial with his wife at Town Hall. On November 20, 1946 he performed solo at Carengie Hall. Playing his Sonnet #3 for the first time publicly. It was his last performance in New York.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Amidst all these performances, Achron remained active as a composer, writing the song \"Do You Know that The Moon Can Talk\" under a pseudonym, John Dorr. It was published in 1937 by Chappell & Co., Ltd. In 1941 he composed two compositions for violin: Sonet #2, introduced by Jascha Heifetz and \"Valse Dramatique\" performed by Mischa Elman.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Isidor Achron died in his home from complications of a heart attack that he had suffered two weeks prior.

Gibbs also devoted much of his career to the amateur choral and festival movements in Britain. He attained a high level of popularity, for instance the work 'Dusk' was requested by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen of England) on her eighteenth birthday.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Gibbs was born in Great Baddow, a country village near Chelmsford in Essex, England on 10 August 1889. His maternal grandfather, a Unitarian minister who wrote a number of songs in spite of being musically untrained, was his closest musical relation. His father, David Cecil Gibbs, was the head of the well-known soap company D & W Gibbs, founded by C. A. Gibbs's grandfather. Gibbs's mother, Ida, died when Gibbs was only two, having given birth to a still-born son. While Gibbs had many privileges in his childhood owing to his father's wealth, he was deprived of any permanent mother figure, having been raised by a nurse and five maiden aunts in three month rotations. Gibbs's childhood was further troubled by his father's method of child-rearing; he sought to \"toughen up\" his son by making him sleep in the attic, forcing him to ride and jump a pony at the age of six, and throwing him into deep water in order to learn to swim. This manifested itself later in Gibbs's adulthood as agoraphobia and other nervous troubles.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Gibbs's musical talent appeared early in life: an aunt discovered that he had perfect pitch at age three. He was also improvising melodies at the piano before he could speak fluently and he wrote his first song at the age of five. While family members insisted that Gibbs should attend some kind of music school abroad, Gibbs's father was insistent that Gibbs have a proper British education to prepare him for running the family business. Therefore, Gibbs attended the Wick School, a preparatory school in Brighton beginning in 1899. Gibbs's facility as a student, specifically his talents in Latin, won him a scholarship to Winchester College in 1902 where he specialized in history. However, while at Winchester, Gibbs began music studies in earnest, taking lessons in harmony and counterpoint with Dr. E. T. Sweeting. From 1908-1911 he attended Trinity College, Cambridge on a scholarship as a history student. He continued his studies at Cambridge in music through 1913 studying composition with Edward Dent, Cyril Rootham and Charles Wood. It was at Cambridge that he also studied organ and piano; however, his tendency to \"drift off into improvising was too strong,\" and it became apparent that his future did not lie in musical performance.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After earning his Mus. B from Cambridge in 1913, Gibbs became a preparatory school teacher. He taught at the Copthorne School in Sussex for a year, then at the Wick School (his alma mater) beginning in 1915. During World War I, he continued to teach at the Wick since he was considered unfit for military service. At the Wick, Gibbs taught English, history and the classics, and also led a choir which became \"very keen and competent.\" In 1918, he married Miss Honor Mary Mitchell and had his first child, a son, in the following year.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Early in his adulthood, Gibbs found little time to compose because of teaching duties, and publishers had rejected the few songs he had found time to write. Gibbs was considering becoming a partner with the Wick School. However, Gibbs was awarded a commission in 1919 to write a musical for the school on the occasion of the Headmaster's retirement. Two significant incidents that altered his career came from this project. The first was the formation of his friendship with poet Walter de la Mare, who accepted Gibbs's offer to write the text for the play. The second was that the conductor of this production was none other than Adrian Boult who convinced Gibbs to take a leave of absence from teaching and study music at the Royal College of Music for one year. At the Royal College, Gibbs studied with Ralph Vaughan Williams, Charles Wood, and Boult himself. With the help of the Director, Sir Hugh Allen, he managed to have some of his songs published thus initiating his musical career.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the early 1920s, Gibbs and his family returned to Danbury, Essex, just a few miles from where Gibbs spent his childhood. Here, Vaughan Williams was their neighbor for a short time. Later, Gibbs had a house built in Danbury, named Crossings, where he lived until World War II.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Also in the early 1920s, Gibbs received two significant commissions for stage music, won the Arthur Sullivan Prize for composition, and was regularly getting his music published and performed. In 1921, he was invited to join the staff of the Royal College of Music where he taught theory and composition until 1939. In 1921, Gibbs also founded the Danbury Choral Society, an amateur choir that he conducted until just before his death. In 1923, Gibbs was asked to adjudicate at a competitive musical festival in Bath and quickly found that he had a penchant for this type of work. Within a few years he became one of the best-known judges in England. From 1937 to 1952, he was the Vice-chairman of the British Federation of Musical Festivals, a job that he regarded as one of his most important. In 1931, Gibbs was awarded the Doctorate in Music at Cambridge for composition.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]During World War II, Crossings, his home, was commandeered for use as a military hospital, so Gibbs and Honor moved to Windermere in the Lake District. Although the competitive festivals came to a temporary halt during the war, he continued to be highly involved in musical performance; Gibbs formed a thirty-two voice male choir and co-led a county music committee that focused on producing evening concerts. His son was killed on active service in November 1943 in Italy during World War II. After the war, Gibbs and Honor returned to Essex to a small cottage near Crossings called \"The Cottage in the Bush.\" The competitive festivals resumed. After his retirement from his position as Vice-chairman in 1952, Gibbs continued to write music with more focus on large-scale works including a cantata and a choral mime. While these late compositions were still receiving praise from audiences and participants, they were not nearly as successful as his smaller works. Honor died in 1958, and Gibbs died of pneumonia in Chelmsford on 12 May 1960.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]While Gibbs exhibited musical talent early in his life, he came to composition as a relative latecomer, not officially starting a career until his thirties. Gibbs is best known for his output of songs; he also wrote a considerable amount of music for the amateur choirs that he conducted. Unfortunately, because of Gibbs's association with the amateur musicians, some have dismissed Gibbs's work as being \"lightweight and even trivial.\" Others have looked upon this quality positively; in the words of Rosemary Hancock-Child, \"as a miniaturist, he excelled.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Gibbs was writing in an era in which European masters such as Mahler, Elgar and Puccini were still writing in a traditional style, but younger composers were searching for a new idiom that lay outside tonality. Gibbs himself had little regard for the aural effect of serialism and atonality although he made an effort to hear new works. Curiously, he also cautioned that \"the dissonances of one generation become the consonances of the next.\" Gibbs's personal sound was far more influenced by \"lighter forms of entertainment, popular song, and British folk song\" than it ever was by the avant-garde. He admired Debussy; he repelled Wagner and Schoenberg. Gibbs accepted tradition and did not seek to break new ground.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Gibbs's melodic style often features 1) phrases begun mid-bar rather than on a strong beat, 2) flattened 7ths and other modal inflections, 3) arched phrases, 4) syllabic text setting, and 5) lengthening of words to make them more prominent. Sometimes he would also alter the time signature briefly to accommodate the phrasing of the words. These features are present in his song \"The Sleeping Beauty,\" excerpted below. The two phrases begin on weak beats rather than down beats; the first begins on the second beat in the first measure and the \"and\" of the second beat in the third measure, respectively. Both phrases are also arched in form. While it is clear by the end of the passage that the tonic key is F major, the chromatic alterations made in the first five measures may suggest C minor or F mixolydian. Also, with the exception of the words \"winter\" and \"haunted,\" the text setting is mostly syllabic; a 3/2 bar is also used to accommodate the words in the first phrase.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Gibbs's melodies \"lie comfortably on the voice,\" though the melodies are not always easy to pitch against the accompaniment. However, voice and piano are interdependent in his songs; the vocal line usually relies on the accompaniment's harmonies for context. Because of his amateur keyboard ability, the accompaniments to his songs are usually approachable.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Gibbs's reputation as a songwriter largely lies in his natural gift for text setting. He insisted on giving priority to the words over the music and had very clear musical ideas on what a song should be: short, possessing a dominant theme, and \"[creating] an aura as music is able to heighten.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Gibbs set poems by over fifty different poets, but his best works feature poems by Walter de la Mare, a lifelong friend whom he first worked with in person on his commission from Wick School in 1919. In fact, thirty-eight of his one hundred fifty songs (approximately) are texts by de la Mare. Fellow composer and friend, Herbert Howells, commented in a letter to Gibbs in 1951 that, \"You've never yet failed in any setting you've done of beloved Jack de la Mare's poems.\" De la Mare's poem, \"Silver,\" was set twenty-three times by various composers; however, according to Stephen Banfield, Gibbs's setting of this text may be regarded as the \"definitive\" version. The only other poet that brought out the best in Gibbs's musical craft was Mordaunt Currie (1894-1978), a baronet who lived at Bishop Witham in Essex, not far from Gibbs's residence. Gibbs set seventeen texts by Currie. In choosing subject matter, Gibbs avoided the lofty ideas of unrequited love and death and focused more on nature, magic and the world seen from a child's point of view.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Gibbs wrote his best songs early in his career between 1917-1933.[28] Later in his career, his inspiration came intermittently though his zest for composing continued even to the end of his life. Not all of Gibbs's songs were successful. Some contain no significant music, others come off as pedantic, sentimental, or too predictable.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Gibbs also wrote stage music, three symphonies, sacred works, and chamber music. The second symphony is the hour-long choral symphony, \"Odysseus\", which is perhaps his greatest work. In addition, Gibbs wrote quite a number of settings for choir, mostly for schools and the amateur ensembles he worked with though they were not strong enough works to earn a place in the repertoire.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Gibbs was also a fluent writer for strings, in particular the string quartet, writing more than a dozen; many of his early songs have string accompaniments, and his slow waltz \"Dusk\" for orchestra and piano became extremely popular and earned him more royalties than any of his other works combined.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1960 - Mark Colwill (UK bass guitarist; Tindersticks) is born.\n\nin 1960 - Elvis is featured in Welcome Home Elvis , a Frank Sinatra–hosted TV special.\n\nin 1961 - Billy Duffy (UK guitarist; The Cult/Theatre Of Hate) is born.\n\nin 1961 - The Beatles, in Hamburg, West Germany, signed a recording contract with producer Bert Kaempfert.

After demobilization, he worked from 1921-1939 as a music teacher and choral conductor in Poznań. From 1926-1927 he continued his musical studies at Schola Cantorum in Paris. From 1920-1926 and from 1930-1939, he was a professor at the Conservatory in Poznań. After 1945, Wiechowicz held the Composition Chair at the State Higher School of Music (now the Academy of Music) in Kraków.

It's about control and about the future... To me the core issue is about people's perception of what their rights are as an Internet user and how it relates to intellectual property.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Napster began as an independent peer-to-peer file sharing service, quickly rising to dominate its competitors thanks to a user-friendly interface and a specialization of MP3s. Since its founding in 1999, it has serviced an active community that now sits at well over 10 million members. Its unapologetic distribution of copyrighted materials has challenged traditional conceptions of intellectual copyright.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Lars argues that with accelerated internet speeds and an ever-growing user base, services such as Napster's will continue to aggressively undermine the intellectual copyright and revenue streams of not just musicians but also movies, video games, and other arts and entertainment industries.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"[In] maybe five years, there will be software that can download movies. This goes everywhere, this goes literature, poetry, the whole nine yards. It really is about this perception about if it's intellectual do I have a right to it for free because technology allowed me to get it?... Part of what we are trying to do here is make people understand what they are doing is illegal.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Not all representatives of the music industry view Napster and MP3 downloading with suspicion and trepidation. Chuck D of Public Enemy is among those who see Napster as eroding the monopolistic and cartel-like grip that the major record labels have held upon the industry for decades, devaluing musicianship and artistry in favor of narrow economic interests.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"This is like the power goes back to the people. 'Cause the industry over the past 50 to 60 years has been accountant and lawyer driven and it hasn't been about the artistry.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]For Chuck, the Napster debate has elicited an all-too-familiar panic over the future of music sales.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"In 1967 when FM radio came about ... the quality of the sound would take away from the artists' sales points, when cassette recorders came in it was, 'They're gonna rob and take away from the sales,' and this has proven to be the contrary to what has happened. As a matter of fact, it's a booster to the industry.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Chuck argues that downloading undermines the music industry's ability to act as a gatekeeper of taste, preventing fans from being able to access music produced outside of the major player's studios, and that control over the technology driving the music industry has simply passed from within the industry to the hands of music fans.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\" look at this as a situation where the industry had control of the technology and therefore the people were subservient to that technology at whatever price range the people have to pay for it. Clearly you can't beat technology each and every time. This is industry versus the people and the people got technology on their side and we [the industry] gotta adapt.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The diametrically opposing views presented by Chuck and Lars illustrate the diversity of opinion surrounding Napster and file-sharing both within the music industry and amongst artists. The only point of agreement was Chuck's remark that \"The whole paradigm of the music industry is changing,\" a notion which very few people in the music industry would refute.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 2001 - Travis played a gig at singer's Fran Healy's local primary school at Weston Park, Crouch End, London.

Four years later, the same year Sha Na Na's Vinnie Taylor died of an accidental heroin overdose, Solly escaped from prison and tried out several identities before settling on the late guitarist. At the time of his arrest nearly three decades later, Sha Na Na was already aware of his shenanigans. Solly, who was going by the stage name Danny C, told the doo-... group that he was indeed their old friend Taylor and had just faked his death all those years ago. After Solly's capture, Sha Na Na veteran Jon \"Bowzer\" Bauman responds to the bizarre story: \"As much as one is tempted to find humor in this, when it turns out that the person in question is a murderer, and not only that, the murderer of a child. The humor really ends.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 2001 - Pierino Ronaldo \"Perry\" Como dies at age 88.

He was the first artist to have ten records sell more than one million copies and won the 1958 Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance - male, for \"Catch a Falling Star.\" His final Top 40 hit was a cover of Don McLean's \"And I Love You So\", in 1973. He recorded many albums of songs for the RCA Victor label between 1952 and 1987, and is credited with numerous gold records. Como had so many recordings achieve gold-record status that he refused to have many of them certified.received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002 and was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2007 (Perry died quietly in his sleep)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2002 - Ronan Keating scored his third UK No.1 single with a song written by American country artist Garth Brooks 'If Tomorrow Never Comes'.\n\nin 2002 - Big Tymers were at No.1 on the US album chart with 'Hood Rich.'\n\nin 2004 - Barry and Robin Gibb were both presented with honorary degrees from Manchester University.
