I am grateful to Philipp Ther for his mentorship during this project and to Anita Biricz for her support in managing it. Through this project I also organized public events in which I brought together academics, artists, diplomats and journalists to discuss the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) and its significance for international relations; for their participation in these and the insights that they gave me into the ESC I thank William Lee Adams, Marie-Luise Bohrer, Eldad Beck, Claudette Buttigieg, Ismeta Dervoz, Karen Fricker, Dave Goodman, Paul Jordan, Cathrin Kahlweit, René Kmet, Åse Kleveland, David Lewis, Thomas Row, Maya Sar, Marco Schreuder, Vanessa Spanbauer, Phillip Ther, Sami Ukelli, Klaus Unterberger, Georg Vogt and Florian Wagner, as well as the Diplomatic Academy, the embassies of Australia and Slovenia and the representations of the European Commission and the European Parliament in Vienna for their contributions to these events. I am also grateful to Konrad Mitschka from the Public Value centre of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) and to Herbert Hayduck, the head of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation’s archives, for their support. This book has also benefitted from the International Federation of Television Archives’ Studies Grant, with which I was able to conduct research on the Intervision Song Contest from 2015 to 2016. My research for this book took me all over Europe – including to Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Liechtenstein, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK – to discuss the ESC with its artists, fans, journalists and organizers, present my research at academic conferences and visit archives and libraries. I thank all of those who enthusiastically shared their experiences of the ESC with me, especially Rambo Amadeus,\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb viii\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:38 PM\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nix\n\nSietse Bakker, Radek Banga, Nadine Beiler, Edgar Böhm, Timna Brauer, Alessandro Capicchioni, Kim Cooper, Deen, Tini Kainrath, András KállaySaunders, Klitos Klitou, Jakov Leon, Mario Lackner, Ira Losco, Valentina Monetta, Beatrix Neundlinger, Kobi Oshrat, Robert Pfannhauser, Tereza Radváková, Motti Regev and Jon Ola Sand.

I was fortunate enough to be undertaking my project in Vienna when Austria won the ESC in 2014 and went in to host it in 2015, and I thank all of the journalists who interviewed me and promoted the results of my project during this time – and for giving me the nickname ‘Professor Song Contest’. My academic interest in the ESC began while I was an undergraduate student of European Studies at the Australian National University, where I wrote my first ever essay on the contest. I thank my lecturer at the time, Karis Müller, for her enthusiastic response which motivated me to pursue this research interest further. She also encouraged me to spend part of my honours year at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It was in Israel that I was able to watch my first live ESC, in 1999, and since then I have attended more of the contests live and closely watched recordings of every edition of the ESC from 1956 to 2016. I also thank my colleague at the Australian National University, Tamsin Sanderson, for organizing with me the first ESC parties at the university and for her feedback on this book. I was further able to develop my research on the ESC in the Department of History at Columbia University through my doctoral dissertation Yugoslav Communism and the Power of Popular Music. I thank Mark Mazower for the advice that he gave while mentoring me for this. I began developing the idea for this book as a Max Weber Post-Doctoral Fellow at the European University Institute, and I am grateful to Stephen Smith for his mentorship during my time there and for giving me the opportunity to test some of the ideas that I had for this book in the seminars that we co-lectured.

During my time in Florence I designed the world’s first ever university course on the ESC, which I began teaching at New York University’s campus in Florence and later continued at the University of Vienna. I thank Bruce Edelstein for encouraging me to first teach the course at New York University. In both Florence and Vienna I have had wonderful groups of students in my courses, and I am grateful to them for giving me so many different perspectives on the ESC. Grazie also to the members of the Italian ESC fan club, OGAE Italy, and especially its president, Cristina Giuntini, for welcoming me into their group and giving me an experience of ESC fandom. My thanks also go to Helena Rosandić and Joško Jureškin from the Vienna team of the Bruketa&Žinić OM advertising agency for the design of the book’s cover and map; I am honoured to have on my book the mark of a creative team whose work I have long admired. It has also been a pleasure to work with the staff of Bloomsbury Publishing, and I thank all of the reviewers whose feedback helped to shape this book.

platform from which the aspirations of dictators and drag queens have been projected, and upon which battles between capitalists and communists, Europeanists and Eurosceptics, reactionaries and revolutionaries have been played out. Since its inception in 1956, the annual Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) has always reflected political changes in postwar Europe alongside cultural, economic, social and technological developments, with almost all European states having been represented in the contest at some point in its sixty-year history. While it is globally one of the longest-running and most popular television shows, having traditionally reached hundreds of millions of viewers through television and even more now through the internet, the ESC has always been quintessentially European and has forged common cultural references among Europeans. The contest has involved national broadcasting organizations sending artists with original songs to represent their states, with the winning state traditionally hosting the contest the next year under the auspices of its national broadcasting organization. Apart from earning the right for a state to host the contest, no material award, except for the bouquets, medals and trophies that have been presented to the composers, lyricists and singers of the victorious entry, has ever been attached to winning the contest. There has always been the hope that the winner could achieve commercial success, and of the 1,438 songs that were performed in the ESC from 1956 to 2016, some went on to become international hits that are still heard all over Europe. That the ESC has had a huge impact on European popular culture is also heard in the contest’s characteristic phrases, such as ‘good evening, Europe’, ‘twelve points go to …’ or ‘zero points’ (as well as their variations in French, the other official language of the contest), infiltrated everyday speech across Europe, the latter two respectively expressing acclamation or disapproval.\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 1\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\n2\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nThe ESC has itself been commonly derided for promoting déclassé popular music, having excessive costs and pandering to national stereotypes. The scoffing criticisms that have been made about the cultural kitschiness of the ESC are generally unfair considering that it has launched some popular music stars, showcased a variety of popular music genres and had songs that have been politically and socially critical. Such judgements have also belittled the ESC’s success as a technological feat achieved through international cooperation. The contest was conceived by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) in the mid-1950s as a venture in developing Western Europe’s emerging television services through the programme exchange and technical cooperation that was being fostered by the organization’s Eurovision Network, from which the ESC got its name. The ESC is one of the leading examples of a television show that has connected Europeans via a simultaneous, transnational broadcast, especially as the EBU and other European organizations have made other, often fleeting, attempts to achieve the same. Yet, that impact has itself often been exaggerated by the contest’s advocates, who have liked to emphasize how the contest brings together Europeans, yet who also often underestimate how much this unification is based on an international competition that arguably does more to underline national divisions than forge a European whole. Like the European Union (EU), as much as the ESC might – or, as this book argues, might not – have aspired to contribute to the creation of a European identity, its national basis has continued to demonstrate that postwar European integration is not a teleological process. The history of the ESC and its organizer, the EBU, is also about national broadcasting organizations hoping to enter, opting into or out of or threatening to leave them, much like states have behaved towards the EU. The EBU, however, had a temporal head start in facilitating European cooperation. Set up in 1950, it emerged just after the Council of Europe (CoE) had been created in 1949, but it preceded the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951 and the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community, or Euratom, in 1957, all three of which merged to form the European Community (EC) in 1967. It also predated the alternative organization for economic integration in Western Europe, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which was established in 1960. The EBU was independent of all of these organizations, and, together\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 2\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\nIntroduction: Europe’s Greatest Television Show\n\n3\n\nwith the CoE, it was at the forefront of the promotion of European cultural cooperation well before the EC began to develop its own cultural policy. The EBU did, however, cooperate with EC institutions from the 1970s on the media coverage of their activities, as well as clash with them as the EC sought to regulate television broadcasting from the 1980s. The Eurovision Network’s early success in forging a common market for radio and television programmes was arguably due to the EBU distancing itself from the politics of other Western European organizations, especially those with supranational aims. The relationship between the EBU and the EU has historically been fraught with tensions that are usually obscured by Europeanist portrayals of the ESC as an enduring symbol of a teleological history of postwar European integration. The ESC has often been viewed by journalists and politicians as a harbinger of developments in international relations, a waiting room for aspiring candidates for other, grander European political organizations, especially the EU. Due to the geographical spread of the EBU’s members and the organization’s apolitical membership criteria, the ESC has offered the broadest number of people in the most states in Europe the opportunity to vote in a common event since the introduction of public televoting in the late 1990s. The results of Europe’s biggest election allow us to analyse interactions and sympathies in a broader context of diasporic, post-colonial, regional, religious and sexual identities. Still, the ESC has always been presented as an ‘apolitical’ event by the EBU, which has insisted that all of the national broadcasting organizations participating in the contest must broadcast all of the competing entries, including those from states with which the state of the national broadcasting organization might not have diplomatic relations or be involved in a military conflict. Political statements in entries have, however, only been explicitly banned in the contest’s rules since 2000, a stipulation which has nonetheless been inconsistently applied. The EBU otherwise has no political standards for its members that are national, public service radio and television broadcasters. The criteria for EBU membership stipulate that a national broadcasting organization need only come from state that is a member of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations (UN) agency, and located within the European Broadcasting Area (EBA), a technical region defined by the ITU that includes states\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 3\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\n4\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nfrom Europe and the Mediterranean rim. However, exactly by wearing the emperor’s new clothes, the political aims, attitudes and opinions of activists, governments and parties have been more liberally expressed in the contest than they could have been in other international organizations that are more constrained by diplomatic norms. As the journalist Jean Coucrand put it in the Belgian newspaper Le Soir (The Evening) in 1979: ‘If the Eurovision Song Contest does not deal with politics, politics deals with it.’1 That there is no other international song contest in the world matching the longevity or popularity of the ESC demonstrates, however, that there is something peculiarly European about the ESC that transcends national identifications. The intrinsic Europeanness of the ESC is also underlined by the common etymology of ‘Europe’ and ‘Eurovision’, which can be read as the Greek and Latin versions of the same concept. One explanation of the etymology of ‘Europe’ is that it is derived from the Greek eurys, meaning ‘broad’, and óps, meaning ‘eye’.2 ‘Vision’ is also derived from the Latin word for ‘seeing’. Both ‘Europe’ and ‘Eurovision’ are therefore about viewing things broadly, even diversely. The myth of ‘Europa’, who in Greek mythology was seduced by Zeus and taken to the island of Crete, also embodies staple themes of ESC entries: love, the sea and travel. However, postwar European integration projects, especially that of the EU, have hijacked the terms ‘Europe’ and ‘Euro’ to the extent that it is a symptom of contemporary conditioning to conflate anything bearing these appellations as being immediately associated with the EU and its political aims. These days, ‘euro’ is also most commonly associated with the EU’s currency, giving this term an economic dimension that was not attached to it previously. The EU has come to overshadow the diversity of Europeanism, which has been promoted by various international organizations with different goals. Even though they are both ‘unions’, the EBU’s international aims should thus not be conflated with the EU’s supranational ones. Indeed, as the members of the EBU themselves typify, television in Europe still remains a very national affair, as does popular music. Even though the ESC has unified Europeans by creating shared cultural references, it has arguably been more successful in forging national icons and refashioning national identities rather than transnational ones. The patriotism expressed in the barracking for national entries at the ESC reflects the resilience of national identities despite – or because of – processes of European integration.\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 4\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\nIntroduction: Europe’s Greatest Television Show\n\n5\n\nYet, the ESC also demonstrates that those national identities have not been ‘pure’ or ‘unique’ phenomena, but have rather been refashioned through cultural transfers. One of the striking features of ESC entries is, in fact, that they have always expressed social diversity through the biographies of their artists, which usually have an element of international migration based on whatever combination of economic, educational, intimate, political or professional reasons. The national label that these artists have appeared under at the ESC has often been deceiving, especially as, in some cases, the artists themselves have not even been citizens of the states that they have represented. However, even a win by a non-national has been greeted with patriotic fervour, as the example of Canada’s Celine Dion, who won the 1988 ESC for Switzerland, demonstrated. So, while the extent to which the ESC has shaped a European identity is arguable, it is more obvious that it has refashioned national identities and made them appear more attractive and modern through new media, technologies and, of course, fashions. I prefer the term ‘nation fashioning’ over ‘nation building’ or ‘nation branding’ as ‘fashion’ invokes the interdependent recognition of the aesthetic and the temporal as well as the appropriation of successful models, considerations which are also crucial for the production of ESC entries. As it has never adopted political criteria for its membership, the EBU’s remit has always been greater than that of other postwar European organizations. During the Cold War, the perception that the ESC developed harmoniously parallel to postwar Western European integration was magnified by the contest’s exclusion of Eastern European national broadcasting organizations. These had their own equivalent of the EBU, the International Radio and Television Organization (OIRT), whose Intervision Network organized the fleeting Intervision Song Contest (ISC). However, the participation of national broadcasting organizations in the ESC also did not strictly mirror their states’ involvement in other Western European organizations. The EBU has included as active members – which have voting rights in the organization and can participate fully in the Eurovision Network – national broadcasting organizations from authoritarian and liberal democratic states, as well as from states that are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or neutral. Neutrality made Switzerland, for example, willing to host international organizations yet suspicious to join them: although it joined the CoE in 1963 and the UN in 2002, Switzerland has never\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 5\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\n6\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nentered the EU. Yet, Switzerland was a founding member of the EBU and is the site of its headquarters, and the state hosted the first ESC in 1956, which it also won with Lys Assia singing ‘Refrain’. The EBU has also admitted as associate members, which are not part of the Eurovision Network, national broadcasting organizations from states outside of the EBA with various political systems, including Australia, China and Iran.3 The ESC has from its very beginning been appropriated in the cultural diplomacies of states with varying foreign policies and political systems as cultural propaganda, nation-branding or soft power. For the active members of the EBU, as well as an Australian one, which have participated in the ESC, the potential innocuousness of the popular music typically performed there has made the ESC appropriable for the cultural diplomacies of governments of various political shades. As the writer Milan Kundera puts it, ‘Kitsch is the aesthetic ideal of all politicians and all political parties and movements.’4 Sometimes just participating in the contest has been a reflection of a state’s aspirations for European integration, from the case of Spain in the 1960s and 1970s when it was ruled by the rightist dictatorship of Francisco Franco, to the examples of Central and East European states that joined the ESC after the Cold War. For authoritarian states that have been represented in the ESC, such as Greece, Portugal and Spain in the 1960s and 1970s and Azerbaijan, Belarus and Russia after the Cold War, participation in the contest has been used by their governments to whitewash their suppression of media freedom and political opponents and to make their international images more palatable to a West European audience. In authoritarian states in which governments have exercised direct control over the national broadcasting organizations, the connection between foreign policies and the appropriation of the ESC in cultural diplomacies has been clearer than in liberal democracies in which the national broadcasting organizations are ideally meant to be free of government interference. However, even in liberal democracies the ESC has had a political symbolism in the context of domestic conflicts between political parties, and the accountability and transparency of the national broadcasting organizations has been questioned when their officials have decided not to choose entries through a national selection based on a public vote. Artists, music industry representatives and national broadcasting organization officials in liberal democracies have also used the contest as a vehicle not\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 6\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\nIntroduction: Europe’s Greatest Television Show\n\n7\n\nonly to achieve commercial aims but also to make political statements – and despite not always having a democratic mandate to do so. Domestic political battles have also been waged through the ESC as national broadcasting organizations have entered artists who have been politically symbolic because of their ethnicity, gender, nationality, race, religion or sexuality. The ESC has thus been a highly flexible tool of cultural diplomacy that has had different meanings for different states at different times, which could also be read from the affiliation and ranking of the politicians who attended the contest when it was held in their state. The contest has varyingly been used to express Europeanism, Euroscepticism or neither. In the United Kingdom (UK), for example, which has had postwar Europe’s biggest popular music industry, the ESC was during the Cold War approached principally as a commercial endeavour, much as the policies of British governments favoured Western European integration more for its economic benefits than as a cultural or political project. And some of the most Eurosceptic states have in fact had some of the most fervent national audiences for the ESC: an Iceland that has withdrawn its application for EU membership; a Norway that won the contest just after it rejected EU membership; and a Sweden that has one of the biggest national audiences for – and whose popular music industry has profitted immensely from-the ESC but which nonetheless has not adopted the euro. Voting in the ESC has infamously reflected regional blocs – Balkan, Nordic, former Soviet and Western – yet the contest’s organization has been dominated by the commercial ambitions and technological superiority of Europe’s north. In states that have variously been on a geopolitical or linguistic periphery at a certain historical point, journalists and politicians have interpreted poor scores in the contest to explain their states’ cultural, economic and political marginalization in European affairs. In all states, public reactions to national results in the contest have generally viewed failure at the ESC in terms of a cultural and political distancing from ‘Europe’, while success has been presented as acceptance by it. Still, while the enthusiasm of national audiences for the contest ebbs and rises in accordance with the success of their national entries, the ESC remains Europe’s greatest television show. That this was neither the expectation nor the intention of its founders reflects how national sentiments and public desires have often been misjudged or undervalued by the technocratic establishments that have been at the vanguard of European integration.\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 7\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\n8\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nThis book examines the relationship between postwar European politics and the ESC, from the soft-power use of the ESC in cultural diplomacy to refashion the images of states to how the contest has been a subject in political battles within states. Although the ESC has been such a massive cultural phenomenon lasting six decades so far, there has not yet been a systematic scholarly attempt to research the history of the ESC. The articles, books and websites on the history of the ESC that have been produced by the EBU, fans and journalists have tended to focus on the content of the contest itself – such as the entries, hosting and voting – rather than address the ESC in the broader context of cultural, economic and political international relations. They have sometimes also perpetuated clichés, exaggerations or unsubstantiated facts about the history of the ESC – or just expressed their fantasies of a unified Europe that they imagine through the contest.5 As a result, a hagiographic, popular history of the ESC has emerged which over emphasizes its positive function for European integration without considering the complex relations between the EBU and European organizations and national governments that are explained through archival sources, especially those from the CoE, EBU, ITU and OIRT that this book pioneeringly draws on. The popular historiography of the ESC has also underplayed the role that the contest has had in the less positive aspects of postwar European history, such as in the cultural diplomacy of authoritarian states or how it has been used as a symbolic battlefield for actual wars that have taken place in Europe. Regarding academic literature, there has been an increased scholarly interest in the ESC in the past decade, underlined by the publication of hundreds of articles as well as several collected volumes. Most of this research has been produced by scholars from cultural, media, music and theatre studies who have focused overwhelmingly on the post-1989 period. The Cold War era has consequently received little attention: there is hardly any literature, for example, on the ISC, the Eastern European attempt to create a global and communist alterative to the ESC. Building on the extant scholarship, this book connects the Cold War era with the ESC’s history since 1990. It argues that the cultural, economic, political and social issues that have been highlighted at the ESC from 1990, such as cultural diplomacy, economic disparity, European integration, military conflict and social diversity have, in fact, historically been constant features of the contest. The financial cost\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 8\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\nIntroduction: Europe’s Greatest Television Show\n\n9\n\nof the contest has always been criticized, the voting system has always been debated and reformed, and national societies have always argued about the merits of the songs that have represented their states. With an emphasis on the diplomatic history of the ESC, the first part of this book, ‘The Cold War, 1945–1989’, focuses on the role that the ESC played in relations between states in both Eastern and Western Europe during that period. The first chapter, ‘The Western European Arrangement’, begins with the section ‘Organizations’, which discusses the international organizations whose policies and regulations have defined the remit of the ESC. Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the first international telecommunications organizations were established in the nineteenth century. The International Broadcasting Union (IBU), the direct predecessor of the EBU, was formed in 1925. The EBU was thus not an entirely new phenomenon in terms of promoting cooperation among national broadcasting organizations, and the ESC also had its roots in earlier transnational radio programmes. During the interwar era and in the first postwar decade, new political arrangements and telecommunications technologies required new forms of international cooperation, and this mantra also defined the development of separate international broadcasting organizations for Eastern and Western Europe. The second section, ‘Integration’, looks at the relationship between the ESC and Western European organizations, namely the CoE and the EC. While the CoE was important for facilitating the cultural cooperation that the ESC epitomized, the EC only began to develop a cultural policy from the 1970s and it briefly appropriated the ESC in this in the late 1980s. Considering that the ESC had by then already established itself as Europe’s most popular television show, the EBU was during the Cold War more at the forefront of the production of shared cultural references among Western Europeans than the EC was. The third section, ‘Anglo-Americanization’, argues that the ESC needs to be considered in a global context as well, and not just as a European phenomenon as its name suggests. From its very beginning, the ESC reflected American cultural influences which arguably united Western Europeans more than any other cultural trends. Although the contest was not broadcast in the United States, it did help to launch the careers of artists who would become successful in North America. Yet, the ESC’s global influence was not limited by Anglo-Americanization: for example, Portuguese and Spanish artists had,\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 9\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\n10\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nfor linguistic reasons, markets in Latin America. The ESC was even broadcast to South American states which, together with Australia – which was also connected to Europe through immigrant and imperial ties – were the main non-European areas to experience the ESC during the Cold War. The second chapter, ‘The Show of Nations’, looks at the role that the ESC had in national politics during the Cold War. It begins with the section, ‘Fashioning’, which examines how the ESC refashioned national identities in postwar Europe through the media of popular music and television. As ESC entries were usually more successful nationally than internationally, this section argues that the contest has been more effective in fashioning national identities rather than shaping a European one. The next section, ‘Mapping’, considers how national audiences viewed other European states through the ESC. This section demonstrates that cultural affiliations have defined the phenomenon of bloc voting throughout the contest’s history, although not in all geographical or linguistic regions; it also shows that political ties have not played such a decisive role in the voting, with the major exceptions being those between Greece, Cyprus and Turkey. The section ‘Revolutions’ examines how national political conflicts were played out in the ESC. In many states there was an identification with the contest as something that belonged more to the left or right wings of national politics. Leftist protests in Sweden, for example, opposed the Anglicization and commercialization of the ESC in the late 1970s. The rightist dictatorships of Portugal and Spain, meanwhile, appropriated the contest in their cultural diplomacies in the 1960s and 1970s to whitewash their international images, although there were also attempts by political dissidents in these states to use the ESC as a platform to criticize these authoritarian governments. The rise of new social movements in Western Europe from the mid-1960s also saw more political and social issues being articulated at the ESC, although gender and sexuality issues were apparent in the contest in the late 1950s even before the greater sexual liberalization in Western European societies in the 1960s. The third chapter, ‘A Contest for Communism’, looks at the experience of Eastern European states with the ESC. It begins with the section ‘Appropriation’, which examines how communist governments in Eastern Europe went from a policy of censoring Western popular music to appropriating it in their cultural policies, including through the staging of international song contests.\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 10\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\nIntroduction: Europe’s Greatest Television Show\n\n11\n\nAlready in the late 1950s, as the section ‘Intervision’ highlights, the OIRT was interested in its members participating in the ESC as the organization began cooperating with the EBU in the context of Détente. The EBU rebuffed the OIRT’s proposal for a joint international song contest but allowed Eastern European national broadcasting organizations to broadcast the ESC from 1965. The OIRT twice set up an equivalent contest, the ISC, from 1965 to 1968 in Czechoslovakia and from 1977 to 1980 in Poland, and both of these also sought to include Western European national broadcasting organizations and record companies. However, both of these editions of the ISC were suppressed because of political upheavals in Czechoslovakia and Poland. Due to the political oppression by communist governments, some Eastern European artists emigrated to Western Europe and went on to perform in the ESC, and their cases are examined in the section ‘Dissent’. Although Yugoslavia represented an exceptional case in the ESC as the only communist state to participate in the contest during the Cold War, reflecting its nonalignment and openness to Western cultural influences, censorship was also a phenomenon there until 1989, the same year that Yugoslavia won the ESC as the first communist European state to do so. This was a harbinger for the entry of Central and East European states into the ESC after the end of communism in 1989, although when the ESC was staged in May of that year, the extent of the geopolitical changes that would befall Europe before the 1990 ESC could not have been anticipated. The second part of the book, ‘European Unification, 1990–2016’, focuses on the relationship between the ESC and European politics since the end of the Cold War. The fourth chapter, ‘A Concert of Europe’, describes how the 1990 ESC in Zagreb reflected hopes for European unification in the wake of the Cold War but these were soon quickly tested by the wars in the former Yugoslavia. As the section ‘Wars’ explains, the wars in the former Yugoslavia, together with those between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Israel and its Arab neighbours, and Russia with Georgia and Ukraine, would be a constant backdrop for the ESC. The impact of these wars demonstrated how the contest has not just been a forum for cultural cooperation but also one through which military conflicts have been symbolically waged. Some Central and East European states, as the section ‘Europeanism’ shows, considered joining the ESC to be important for their cultural diplomacies as an expression of their\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 11\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\n12\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\naims for integration into other European organizations, especially the CoE and the EU. Yet, while the contest can be viewed as a stage for the articulation of Europeanist aspirations, it has also reflected the Euroscepticism in states across Europe, as is discussed in the section ‘Euroscepticism’. In West European states, for example, media, political and public reactions to the successes of Central and East European states in the contest have been tied to anxieties over the enlargement of the EU. However, for one Central and East European state, the Czech Republic, not participating in the contest has also reflected Eurosceptic sentiments in its national politics. In Iceland and Norway, though, their rejection of EU membership has not correlated with a public disinterest in the ESC, with Iceland proportionately having the largest national televiewing audience for it. The final chapter, ‘The Values of Eurovision’, considers how the ESC has shaped values that have been perceived as integral to a European identity. The first is that of ‘Diversity’, and this section examines how the contest has reflected ethnic, religious and sexual diversity in Europe. Ethnic and religious minorities have a history of being represented in the contest since its early years. Sexual minorities, however, were only visibly represented in the ESC from the late 1990s, and their appearance in the contest has become a point of tension between West and Central and East European states. It has also influenced Turkey’s withdrawal from the ESC, which was additionally prompted by changes to the contest’s voting system. One such change has allowed the ‘Big Five’ – France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK – direct entry into the final without having to participate in the semi-finals that were introduced to accommodate more participants. The Big Five are privileged because of their financial contributions to the contest and their population sizes, which also demonstrates the power of commercial considerations in the ESC, an issue that is addressed in the section ‘Commercialism’. In light of the economic crisis that the EU has experienced since 2009, the financial cost of just participating in the ESC has become daunting for some national broadcasting organizations, while others, particularly non-EU member states like Azerbaijan and Russia, have invested record amounts into hosting the contest. Although the ESC has always been controversial for its cost, the current situation highlights more than ever the economic disparities that exist in Europe roughly following a north–south divide. The establishment of the\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 12\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\nIntroduction: Europe’s Greatest Television Show\n\n13\n\nEurovision Network and the EU’s original institutions were initially motivated by economic reasoning, but sixty years after their formation economic divergences undermine their unity. However, both the ESC and the EU continue to grapple with issues of democratic legitimacy, which is the subject of the section ‘Democracy’. Although the ESC adopted public televoting in 1997, the fact that it in 2009 reintroduced an element of expert jury voting alongside the public televote reflects a distrust of direct democracy that is also evident in the technocratic approaches of the EU. The conclusion, ‘Bridges, Diamonds and Fires’, reflects on the issues addressed in the previous chapters through the diamond, sixtieth edition of the contest that was held in Vienna in 2015 and the 2016 ESC in Stockholm that marked sixty years since the staging of the first ESC. The 2015 ESC was staged in the year that major historical anniversaries of the Congress of Vienna, the First World War and the Second World War were being marked. Social diversity was again highlighted as a constant theme in the ESC after the victory of Austria’s bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst in the previous year’s contest had provoked both joyous and hostile reactions across Europe because of her queer identity. That many Central and East European states which have close ties with Austria through culture, economics and immigration did not participate in the 2015 ESC for financial reasons demonstrated how economic disparities have continued to impact on the ESC. The 2016 ESC was held in the wake of the migrant crisis of 2015, during which over a million migrants and refugees entered Europe, many of them fleeing from wars taking place in the southeastern extremity of the EBA. Yet, the 2016 ESC would be most marked by another crisis – the conflict between Russia and Ukraine over the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbass. As issues of diversity, economics, immigration and war were once again being controversially addressed in the ESC, it showed that the contest still had a meaning in Europe’s international relations. Yet, has the ESC only been a metaphor or also a catalyst for change?\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 13\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\nFigure 2 The EBA\n\nStates in the EBA, 2016 Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 14\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\nFigure 3 Freddy Quinn, 1956\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 16\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:39 PM\n\n1\n\nThe Western European Arrangement\n\nFreddy Quinn and Walter Andreas Schwarz were the faces of German innocence. In the first ESC that was staged in Lugano on 24 May 1956, each of the seven participating national broadcasting organizations – which all happened to come from the six founding member states of the ECSC, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany, plus Switzerland – entered two artists who each performed a song. Twentyfour-year-old Quinn and 42-year-old Schwarz were internally selected within that state’s national broadcasting organization, the Consortium of the Public Service Broadcasting Corporations of the Federal Republic of Germany (ARD), to represent West Germany in the ESC. Quinn and Schwarz represented West Germany not only with their songs but also through their biographies that embodied experiences which were definitive for a West German national identity. Schwarz had been born in the town of Aschersleben which, in the postwar European arrangement, would find itself in East Germany. He had studied musicology in Vienna before being interned, because of his Jewish background, in a concentration camp in Germany in 1938. After the Second World War, Schwarz resumed his career as a singer and writer; an Anglophile, he was known for his English-German translations and worked as an announcer for the British national broadcasting organization, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).1 Schwarz’s ballad in the 1956 ESC, ‘Das Lied vom großen Glück’ (The Song of Great Happiness), advised that people should live for the present rather than get stuck in the past and risk the joys of life passing them by. Appearing after Schwarz in the ESC, Quinn represented a different generation and sang about both the burdens and freedoms of the present. In the style of the rock and roll that was hitting Western Europe from the United States, his song ‘So geht das jede Nacht’ (That’s How It Is Every Night) was\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 17\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:41 PM\n\n18\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nabout a girlfriend who was going out with other men who, like Freddy himself, had English-language nicknames such as Ben, Billy, Jack, Jimmy, Johnny and Tommy. Quinn hailed from Austria, and in the history of Austrian–German relations in the ESC his performance for West Germany would prove to be an unusual example of the cultural ties between the two states – especially considering that their national juries hardly exchanged points in the 1950s and 1960s, which could be interpreted as an effort to avoid any suggestion of their states’ mutual association in the Nazi era. Quinn himself had been a child during the Second World War and liked to emphasize his cosmopolitan background in media interviews: his mother was Austrian and his father was American, and he had spent time living with his father in the United States before returning to Austria in 1938, the year in which it was annexed by Nazi Germany.2 Quinn and Schwarz were the cosmopolitan representatives of a West Germany that was distancing itself from its Nazi past and embracing an Americanized present. They challenged the stereotype of Germans as aggressive, militaristic and unemotional types who speak an accordingly uneuphonious language, a cliché that lingered in the minds of other Europeans – and fuelled jokes for British sitcoms – long well after the Second World War. Quinn and Schwarz portrayed a pacified West Germany that had learned its lessons from the Second World War and was firmly in the proAmerican, Western alliance as the state found itself at the centre of the Cold War. It was, after all, around a divided Germany that postwar Europe was arranged. West Germany’s economic wealth, geographical location, military history, population size and technological prowess made it central to peace and prosperity in postwar Western Europe, and the state’s participation was essential in the organizations that were established in the late 1940s and early 1950s for the new Western European arrangement, from the EBU to the CoE, EC and NATO. While Western European economic, military and political organizations developed concurrently with the EBU, they – and their member states individually – often had different visions for the breadth, intensity and style of integration among their members, as well as for the role that culture should play in this. The EBU produced common cultural references for Western Europeans decades before the EC even began to develop a cultural policy, and\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 18\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:41 PM\n\nThe Western European Arrangement\n\n19\n\nnot just through ESC artists like Quinn who would become international stars. The ESC also pioneered the use of the circle of twelve stars – a version of which the EC would in 1985 adopt as its flag – as a European symbol by utilizing it from 1954 as the logo for the Eurovision Network. As a distinctively Western European event, the ESC gave cultural expression to the economic and political integration among Western European states, but the EC only started to become directly involved with the contest in the late 1980s after Brussels realized that it needed to develop a cultural policy that would promote a European identity. The ESC was not, however, just a cultural symbol for Western European integration in the face of Cold War division. It also expressed how Western Europeans collectively related to other parts of the world in the postwar international arrangement, especially through migration and postimperialism. Middle Eastern and northern African states, for example, had been drawn into the EBA in the interwar era; however, they mostly did not enter the ESC in protest against the only Middle Eastern state, Israel, that regularly did from 1973, and whose participation symbolically reminded Western Europeans of the Holocaust that Schwarz had suffered in. Then there was the American superpower that led the Western bloc and had a hegemonic influence on Western European popular culture during the Cold War, as was reflected by the Anglo-American style of Quinn’s song. Some ESC songs expressed Western Europe’s ambivalent response to Americanization as they criticized the exacerbation of Cold War tensions, espoused the virtues of chansons over rock and roll or glorified a European way of life. However, there were other politically charged songs that echoed the American folk music that was the soundtrack of protest movements in the United States. As the sounds of Americanization and Europeanization harmonized and clashed in the ESC during the Cold War, they reflected not only integration in Western Europe but also tensions within the transatlantic alliance.\n\nOrganizations The ESC was a product not just of international relations in postwar Europe but also of a history of international cooperation in telecommunications that had begun in the nineteenth century. The origins of the international organizations\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 19\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:41 PM\n\n20\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nthat shaped the ESC can be traced back to 1815 in Vienna, the city that Quinn grew up in. At the Congress of Vienna that took place from September 1814 to June 1815, European statesmen redrew the map of their continent in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars and set up a system of international relations known as the ‘Concert of Europe’ for the maintenance of the new order. The ESC is indelibly connected to 1815 as the final defeat of France’s Emperor Napoleon I at the Battle of Waterloo in that year inspired ABBA’s ‘Waterloo’, which was declared the most popular ESC entry ever by a public televote in the Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest show that was staged in Copenhagen in 2005 for the ESC’s fiftieth anniversary. ‘Waterloo’ won the 1974 ESC with its conductor Sven-Olof Walldoff dressed up as the emperor. Just as the ESC would be appropriated in the cultural and public diplomacy of international organizations and states in postwar Europe as a metaphorical ‘Concert of Europe’, dancing and music accompanied the negotiations at the Congress of Vienna. So much so that Prince Charles-Joseph de Ligne described it as ‘the Congress dances, but does not advance’.3 Emissaries, plenipotentiaries and royals were entertained in the Hofburg Palace, where the 1967 ESC would be staged, and composers such as Ludwig van Beethoven were commissioned to produce musical pieces especially for the Congress of Vienna. Yet, beyond these connections, the Congress of Vienna was most significant for the ESC because it established the first intergovernmental organization, the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine. This paved the way for the creation of other international organizations in the nineteenth century. Some of the earliest of these were formed for international cooperation in postal and telegraphic communications, with the International Telegraph Union being set up in 1865 as the first public international union. While the founding members of the International Telegraph Union were all European states – the first bilateral agreement on telegraphy had already been agreed between the Austrian Empire and Prussia in 1849 – the development of intercontinental telecommunications and new technologies motivated the establishment in the early twentieth century of other international organizations whose regulations would ultimately define the remit of the ESC. In 1903, the German government organized the Preliminary Conference on Wireless Telegraphy in Berlin for European states and the United States. Prince Heinrich of Prussia – an admiral, a brother of Germany’s last emperor, Wilhelm II, and a grandson of Queen Victoria of the\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 20\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:41 PM\n\nThe Western European Arrangement\n\n21\n\nUK – had triggered the conference after he had been prevented from sending telegrams to American and German destinations, including to American president Theodore Roosevelt, as Prince Heinrich sailed back to Europe aboard the Deutschland following an official visit to the United States.4 The conference of 1903 was followed in 1906 by the International Radiotelegraph Conference, which produced the first international radio regulations and set up the International Radiotelegraph Union to administer them. At the International Radiotelegraph Conference in Madrid in 1932, the International Radiotelegraph Union merged with the International Telegraph Union to form ITU, which has since then been the international organization responsible for managing its namesake. The Statutes of the European Broadcasting Union have always stipulated that a state must belong to the ITU for its national broadcasting organization to join the EBU as an active member. Another criterion for active membership of the EBU is that the national broadcasting organization come from a state located within the EBA, one of the world regions defined by the ITU for the purpose of allocating broadcasting frequencies. In 1932, the ITU adopted the definition of the ‘European region’, as it then called the EBA, as being bounded to the North and West by the natural limits of Europe, on the East by the meridian 40° East of Greenwich and on the South by the parallel of 30° North so as to include the Western part of the U.S.S.R. and the territories bordering the Mediterranean, with the exception of the parts of Arabia and Hedjaz included in this sector.5\n\nAlthough the Statutes of the European Broadcasting Union take the EBA as being based on the definition adopted by the ITU, the EBA was originally delineated in the interwar era by the world’s first international broadcasting organization, the IBU. It was established in 1925 to manage the rapid expansion of the newest technology, radio, in Europe, especially considering the increase in the number of states following the dissolution of Austria–Hungary after the First World War. By 1939, the IBU’s active membership included national radio broadcasting organizations from almost all European states; the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the world’s first and, alongside Mongolia, only communist-ruled state in the interwar era, never joined because of its political exceptionalism. As the direct predecessor of the EBU,\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 21\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:41 PM\n\n22\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nthe IBU pioneered cooperation among national broadcasting organizations on legal and technical issues, particularly the allocation of broadcasting frequencies in order to reduce interference problems. The ITU also produced the first experiments in the international exchange, joint production and simultaneous broadcasting of musical programmes. Series such as European Concerts, International Concerts, National Concerts, National Nights and World Concerts showcased music from states represented in the ITU, and some of these programmes were even broadcast intercontinentally.6 As with the EBU, national broadcasting organizations from other continents also joined the IBU as associate members, and the IBU also collaborated with other international organizations – including the ITU and the League of Nations – especially as it had unrealized ambitions to become a worldwide organization. It was, however, the EBA that would be the IBU’s definitive legacy for the ESC. From 1925 to 1929, the limits of the EBA were defined by the IBU through plans that were adopted at meetings in Brussels, Geneva and Prague, the same three cities that would host the headquarters of Europe’s two postwar international broadcasting organizations. As the historian Suzanne Lommers has demonstrated, the debates over how exactly ‘Europe’ should be defined for the purposes of the IBU were settled by geographical and technical considerations – particularly the remit of broadcasting signals – rather than cultural or political ones.7 The northern and western limits of the EBA were relatively easily defined by the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, although they would prove the most difficult to conquer technologically: at the EBA’s northwestern extreme, Iceland would in 1986 become the last Western European state to join the ESC during the Cold War, mainly due to the need for a satellite connection between it and continental Europe. Regarding the eastern limit of the EBA, the 1925 Geneva Plan initially set it at 32°30’ East, thereby extending into the USSR only as far as the western-most parts of Russia in order to reduce interference between Soviet radio stations and those from neighbouring European states. That was subsequently amended to 40°30’ East in the 1929 Prague Plan in order to incorporate more of the USSR all the way to Moscow. This change occurred at a time when, in the early years of Joseph Stalin’s rule, the Soviet government sought a rapprochement with other European states and realized that engagement with the IBU could also advance the development of Soviet radio broadcasting.8\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 22\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:41 PM\n\nThe Western European Arrangement\n\n23\n\nStill, the eastern limit of the EBA did not extend as far as what is commonly accepted as Europe’s natural eastern extremity, the Ural Mountains; if it had, it would have included the Caucasus, Iran and parts of Central Asia, as any expansion eastwards obviously went south-easterly too. Indeed, the eastward extension of the EBA in 1929 also brought the Levant into the EBA at a time when, following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Lebanon and Syria were under French mandate and Palestine and Transjordan were British controlled. A repercussion of this is Israel’s participation in the ESC: this has reflected the breadth of the EBA’s borders, but it has ironically also limited the contest’s geographical scope as national broadcasting organizations from Arab states in the Levant and northern Africa have refused to participate in the contest because Israel does. Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia were also included in the EBA in order to reduce interference between their radio stations and ones from southern Europe. The definition of the southern limit of the EBA was thus motivated more by Eurocentric, technical interests rather than colonialist ones, even though Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia were in 1932 under French, Italian or Spanish control.9 Nonetheless, the definition of the EBA acknowledged the history of the Mediterranean basin as a single telecommunications space, the scope of which had been foreshadowed in the second half of the nineteenth century through the construction of telegraphic networks that connected the European metropoles to their territories on other continents. The biggest swathe of territory within the EBA that was never represented in the IBU was, then, that of the USSR. However, after having achieved superpower status in the Second World War, the USSR sought a leading role in international broadcasting organizations. The Second World War had reduced cooperation among the IBU’s members, especially after the organization’s technical centre in Brussels had been taken over by the Nazi occupation in 1940. In 1946, the USSR proposed the establishment of a new organization, the International Broadcasting Organization (OIR), which would also be based in Brussels and include members from both Eastern and Western Europe, but with plans for it to develop into a worldwide organization. Yet, the working of the OIR became unfeasible amid rising Cold War tensions in the late 1940s: as communist parties took control of Eastern European governments, states from both blocs used international radio broadcasting as a weapon in their propaganda wars,\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 23\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:41 PM\n\n24\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nsuch as through Radio Moscow and the Voice of America. Western European broadcasting organizations additionally opposed separate membership and voting rights for the broadcasting organizations of the various republics of the USSR, which would have given that state an inordinate influence in the OIR, especially in combination with the votes of other communist-controlled states in Eastern Europe.10 A fear of Eastern European domination was thus etched into the foundations of the EBU. Just as there would be the duplication of other international organizations for Eastern and Western Europe, such as the economic blocs of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and EC, and the military organizations of the Warsaw Pact and NATO, the EBU was established as a Western European response to the OIR. The tensions between Eastern and Western European national broadcasting organizations within the OIR led to broadcasting organizations from mostly Western European states to meet in Torquay in the UK in 1950 and form the EBU. The states that were represented at this meeting were the Western European ones of Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and Vatican City. Yugoslavia, which had in 1948 dissented from the Eastern Bloc but maintained a communist government, was represented as well. Officials from the national broadcasting organizations of Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey were also in attendance, while the Israeli one participated as an observer; the list of attendees was completed by the broadcasting organizations from the still French protectorates of Morocco and Tunisia. The IBU was also finally dissolved in 1950, with its assets being transferred to the EBU.11 Like the IBU, the EBU set up its administrative headquarters in Geneva and its technical centre in Brussels, the diplomatic capitals of Europe in the second half of the twentieth century. With Geneva being the site of international organizations, including the ITU and a UN office – Switzerland being an attractive location for these because of its neutrality which had been fixed at the Congress of Vienna – and Brussels the future centre of EC ones as well as NATO, the locations of the two headquarters would serve to advance both the European and global ambitions of the EBU. The OIR moved its headquarters to Prague in 1950 and continued to operate for the national broadcasting organizations from Eastern European states; unlike the EBU, its membership would largely be determined by\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 24\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:42 PM\n\nThe Western European Arrangement\n\n25\n\npolitical criteria, namely that of a state having a communist government. Although it was intended for states that were not allied with the USSR, the membership criteria for the EBU were nonetheless formulated to avoid subjective biases that could overly politicize the organization, as had been the case with the exclusion of the USSR from the IBU.12 The EBU’s membership criteria required only that the broadcasting organization have a national remit and public service aim, and that it come from a state that was located in the EBA and was a member of the ITU. Following the establishment of the UN in 1945, the ITU became a specialized UN agency in 1947. The ITU adopted its own membership criteria of a state being a member of the UN or having its membership approved by two-thirds of the ITU’s member states. Recognition of statehood by other international organizations therefore become necessary for a state to be represented in the EBU, but this did not mean that the EBU’s membership criteria were not political: they were just politicized by other international organizations. The EBU’s membership criteria, and the fact that the ITU was an older international organization than the UN, meant that the national broadcasting organizations of several states could join the EBU as their states were members of the ITU but not the UN. This was especially the case until 1955, when the UN admitted Austria, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, as well as with Switzerland and West Germany, which joined the UN in 2002 and 1973 respectively, and Vatican City, which has never joined the UN. Austria and West Germany were two exceptional cases because they were under Allied occupation after the Second World War. Although Austria was readmitted into the ITU in 1945, under the Allied occupation its broadcasting organizations were decentralized on a regional level. This meant that Austria could only enter the EBU in 1953 once it re-established a national broadcasting organization, the Austrian Broadcasting Entity, although still before it regained its sovereignty in 1955.13 ARD joined the EBU in 1952 as West Germany had to wait for permission from the Allied powers for it to first enter the ITU in the same year.14 Cyprus and Malta had the reverse experience: their membership of the ITU was contingent upon their entry into the UN as they achieved independence from the UK in 1960 and 1964 respectively. However, because of their geographical proximity to southern Europe and status as French protectorates, Morocco and Tunisia’s broadcasting organizations had already\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 25\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:42 PM\n\n26\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nbeen welcomed into the EBU in 1950 after also having been previously admitted into the ITU, and before they achieved independence in 1956. Algeria was initially also included in the EBU from 1950 as its Mediterranean region was administered as an integral part of France; after Algeria became independent in 1962, its national broadcasting organization, Algerian Radio and Television Broadcasting, joined the EBU in 1970. For most national broadcasting organizations, then, joining the EBU was less of a matter of political recognition and more one of how developed their radio and television services were and what economic and technical benefits they could anticipate from membership. The national broadcasting organizations that entered the EBU in the 1950s did so first through their radio services. Their television services joined according to the introduction and expansion of these in each state until 1966, when Iceland and Israel became the last states that would be represented in the ESC during the Cold War to introduce them. Television services had limitedly begun in some European states in the interwar era, including in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the UK and the USSR, but these were interrupted by the Second World War; they were introduced in most European states in the 1950s, making the pursuit of the technical advancement of television broadcasting the principal aim of the EBU in that decade. Already in the early 1950s, pioneering milestones were reached in transnational television broadcasting that echoed the history of the EBA in royalty and telegraphy. The BBC achieved the first transnational television transmission between France and the UK in 1950, on the occasion of the centenary of the laying of the first underwater telegraph cable between the two states. The first transnational one produced by the EBU was that of the coronation in 1953 of Queen Elizabeth II of the UK – herself a relative of the aforementioned Prince Heinrich – and it was broadcast live in France, the Netherlands, the UK and West Germany to a viewership of twenty million people.15 These successful experiments foreshadowed the establishment of the Eurovision Network in 1954. The EBU developed the Eurovision Network for the exchange and production of common television programmes in order to cost-effectively increase the programming material for national broadcasting organizations. An equivalent facility for radio programmes had previously been unsuccessfully proposed by Marcel Bezençon, the director general of the\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 26\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:42 PM\n\nThe Western European Arrangement\n\n27\n\nSwiss national broadcasting organization, the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR), to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1947 and the IBU in 1948. He readapted his proposal to focus on television programming when he presented it to the EBU in 1950; however, such international cooperation in television programming could only be realized by the EBU as more states developed television services.16 The first Eurovision Network programmes were broadcast between Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK and West Germany in four weeks of experimental programming held in June and July 1954. The experimental programming began with a broadcast of the Montreux Narcissus Festival, a flower festival. Foreshadowing the importance that religious programming would have for the Eurovision Network, the first evening of the experimental programming included a speech by Pope Pius XII, who called it ‘a symbol and a promise … of union between the nations, and in one respect, to a degree, it initiates that union’.17 EBU officials considered cooperation with Vatican City important due to the transnational Catholic audience and because religious freedom distinguished Western Europe from Eastern Europe; however, Vatican City is one of the two states in Europe that has never participated in the ESC. The most-watched programmes during the experimental programming were matches from the World Cup for soccer that was then being held in Switzerland, which was the main reason why the experimental programming was scheduled for that period.18 This foreshadowed the importance that sporting events would have as by far the biggest category of programmes exchanged by the Eurovision Network, which would be due not only to their mass, transnational popularity, but also to the fact that they would not face the linguistic obstacles of other programmes.19 Yet, the most popular and successful programme that the Eurovision Network would produce, and also its only regular multilateral project, was a light entertainment programme and its namesake, the ESC. When the Eurovision Network broadcast its first programmes in 1954, discussions ensued in the EBU as to how the offerings could be made more modern and spectacular. Following suggestions put forward at the meeting of its Programme Committee – which was in 1964 succeeded by the Television Programme Committee as the decision-making body for the ESC – in Monte Carlo in 1955, the EBU decided at the session of its General Assembly in Rome\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 27\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:42 PM\n\n28\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nlater in that year to establish the ESC as well as another ultimately short-lived programme for variety acts called Top Town.20 The inspiration for the ESC came from Italian Radio and Television (RAI), which had been staging the Festival della canzone italiana di Sanremo (Sanremo Italian Song Festival) in the seaside resort town of the same name since 1951. Members of the Programme Committee attended the Sanremo Italian Song Festival in 1955, when it was also broadcast through the Eurovision Network.21 However, the Sanremo Italian Song Festival was not the only song contest in Italy at the time: in the mid-1950s, the City of Venice and RAI also organized the International Song Festival in Venice. The first edition of this contest in 1955 included entries submitted by the radio services of broadcasting organizations from Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Monaco and the Netherlands: they each submitted six songs that were original and no longer than 3.5 minutes, with the entries being voted on by national juries and the winner being awarded the Golden Gondola prize. The International Song Festival was therefore more similar in its structure to the ESC than the national Sanremo Italian Song Festival was, with the major difference between the ESC and its Venetian predecessor being that the latter was broadcast only via radio and not television.22 Still, the International Song Festival was the world’s first ever international song contest based on the participation of national broadcasting organizations, and some of its participants would also go on to compete in the ESC. The Italian origins of the ESC would also be reflected in the staging of the first ESC in the Italianspeaking Swiss city of Lugano, when the hosting of the contest was also done entirely in Italian. The achievements of the Eurovision Network in the 1950s were pioneering not only for Europe but also for the world. However, the history of international broadcasting organizations in the postwar era was not just about the EBU and the OIR, which was renamed the OIRT in 1959. While they were among the first international broadcasting organizations to be formed, they were just two components in a global network of these. In 1946, the Inter-American Association of Broadcasters had been formed, and in the 1960s and 1970s there was the establishment of the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU), Arab States Broadcasting Union, Caribbean Broadcasting Union (CBU), Commonwealth Broadcasting Association, Islamic States Broadcasting Organization, North American National\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 28\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:42 PM\n\nThe Western European Arrangement\n\n29\n\nBroadcasters Association, Organization of Ibero-American Television (OTI) and Union of National Radio and Television Organizations of Africa. An organization for French-speaking national broadcasting organizations, the Community of French-Language Television Programmes, and one for Nordic ones, Nordvision, were also established. As these two demonstrate, international broadcasting organizations have been variously based on cultural and geographical regions and have not been mutually exclusive: national broadcasting organizations could be active or associate members in different international broadcasting organizations. Nordvision’s members have often adopted common positions within the EBU, including on matters relating to the ESC, and their states have also been perceived as a voting bloc within the contest. However, the EBU would always be the most advanced of these international broadcasting organizations in terms of the extent of cooperation among its members in programme exchange and technological development. As such, the EBU cooperated with other international broadcasting organizations, as well as with international organizations such as the European Space Agency, ITU and UNESCO, on matters such as the development of satellite broadcasting. The EBU also aided extra-European national broadcasting organizations, especially ones in the Third World, in the development of their own television services. The ABU, CBU and OTI were inspired by the EBU’s models to set up not only their own equivalents to the Eurovision Network but also song contests: the OTI Festival began in 1972, and the ABU Popular Song Contest and the Caribbean Song Festival were established in the 1980s. However, no other international broadcasting organization came up with a show that could match the longevity, popularity and remit of the ESC. The ESC continually expanded during the Cold War: its seven original participants were joined by Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the UK in the late 1950s and Finland, Ireland and Norway in the 1960s. The ESC expanded in the Mediterranean with the addition of Monaco in 1959, Portugal, Spain and Yugoslavia in the 1960s, Greece, Israel, Malta and Turkey in the 1970s, and Cyprus and Morocco in the 1980s. Almost all Western European states as well as Israel, Morocco, Turkey and Yugoslavia thus participated in the ESC at some point between 1956 and 1989. The only exceptions were Andorra, Liechtenstein and San Marino – which were not yet members of the EBU as they did not have their own national broadcasting\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 29\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:42 PM\n\n30\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nservices, although Andorra and San Marino would establish these in the 1990s and go on to debut in the ESC in 2004 and 2008 respectively – and, of course, Vatican City. The ESC also reached beyond Europe as it was even broadcast in some states in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australia. In the global context of international broadcasting organizations, the ESC was a unique Western European feat, and one of the reasons for this was that the contest’s development took place in the context of a regional economic and political integration that was unmatched on any other continent.\n\nIntegration The EBU was, however, never controlled by the CoE, EC or other Western European organizations, nor could its leading officials be interpreted as having been implementers of or mouthpieces for the policies of these. Rather than being ideological Europeanists, officials from the EBU were practical internationalists. Bezençon, for example, was initially more concerned with how programme exchange could benefit the infant television services of states – such as his small, multilingual Switzerland, where there was also significant opposition to the introduction of television because of its purported ‘social dangers’23 – than the idea of an integrated Western Europe. The EBU did for national broadcasting organizations what the EC did for states: as the historian Alan S. Milward argues, the ‘evolution of the European Community since 1945 has been an integral part of the reassertion of the nation-state as an organizational concept’, economically and politically buttressing states after the destruction of the Second World War.24 Like the ECSC, the Eurovision Network was also based on the principle of pooling resources, although without the supranational elements of the ECSC: national broadcasting organizations in the Eurovision Network have always been free to decide what they will contribute to and take from it. As Bezençon had been conceptualizing programme exchange from 1947, his proposal for the ‘Stock Exchange of Television Programmes’ to the EBU in October 1950 was thus not prompted by the French foreign minister Robert Schuman’s proposal for the ECSC in May of that year. EBU officials were initially not so enthusiastic about adopting the snappier portmanteau ‘Eurovision’ – in\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 30\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:42 PM\n\nThe Western European Arrangement\n\n31\n\nthe organization’s official publication of the time, the E.B.U. Bulletin, which was renamed the E.B.U. Review in 1958, the appellation was even accused of being ‘somewhat barbaric’ with a ‘somewhat “telegraphic” style’. However, EBU officials eventually did adopt it because it quickly caught on in popular use. The name ‘Eurovision’ was coined outside of the EBU by the British journalist George Campey in an article in the Evening Standard newspaper in 1951: he first used the term to refer to a broadcast by the Dutch national broadcasting organization, the Dutch Television Foundation (NTS), of a BBC programme.25 ‘Eurovision’ marked the beginning of the postwar use of the prefixes ‘Eur-’ or ‘Euro-’ for the names of international organizations and projects, and it was soon followed by Euratom, which was founded in 1957 by the member states of the ECSC. The term ‘Eurovision’ was also favoured by the CoE which, from its establishment in 1949, had been considering the role that radio and television broadcasting could play in promoting the ‘European Idea’, and it accordingly supported the establishment of the Eurovision Network for this.26 The Eurovision Network benefitted in the 1950s from the intergovernmental cooperation initiated by the CoE, which was established to promote cultural cooperation, democratic standards, human rights and the rule of law. The CoE’s spatial scope was also similar to that of the EBU, and these two organizations always had more members than the EC or NATO. The CoE’s membership criteria, however, were more restrictive in geographical and political terms than those of the EBU: as they limited the CoE to Western European states and liberal democracies, they excluded Middle Eastern and northern African states as well as authoritarian governments from Greece, Portugal, Spain and Yugoslavia. Even though the CoE did not directly interfere in the operations of the EBU, the former provided a cultural and legal framework for the operations of the latter. The CoE produced the first multilateral treaty on cultural cooperation in Europe, the ‘European Cultural Convention’ of 1954, which promoted ‘the study of the languages, history and civilization’ of other member states, the protection of ‘the common cultural heritage of Europe’ and ‘concerted action in promoting cultural activities of European interest’.27 The CoE also collaborated with the EBU in developing two multilateral agreements that facilitated the international exchange of television programmes: the ‘European Agreement Concerning Programme Exchanges by Means of Television Films’ of 1958 and the ‘European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts’ of 1960.\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 31\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:42 PM\n\n32\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nThere was an additional connection between the CoE and the EBU in their pioneering use of versions of the circle of twelve stars as a European symbol. The EBU became the first international organization to officially adopt a form of this symbol, which was individualized with the addition of rays that symbolized the international cooperation between and local remit of national broadcasting organizations. Timothy O’Brien from the BBC created the logo for the Eurovision Network in 1954, and he had been inspired by proposals that were being considered by the CoE for its own flag and which resulted in that organization adopting the circle of twelve golden stars on a blue background in 1955.28 For many Western Europeans, particularly those whose states joined the CoE after their national broadcasting organizations had entered the EBU, such as Austria, Finland, Monaco, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland, their first association with the circle of twelve stars was thus the Eurovision Network. The Eurovision Network introduced its programmes, and most famously the ESC, with this symbol accompanied by a wordless jingle taken from the prelude to Marc-Antoine Charpentier’s composition ‘Te Deum’ (Thee, O God). Although ‘Te Deum’ would not be shortlisted by the CoE as its potential anthem – it ended up adopting Beethoven’s ‘Ode to Joy’ in 1972 – the example that the Eurovision Network had set in popularizing it as a signature tune had been noted in discussions within the CoE regarding its selection of an anthem.29 Cooperation with the CoE also suited the EBU because of the former’s intergovernmental character. With the adoption in 1957 by the ECSC member states of the Treaties of Rome that established Euratom and the EEC, the EBU was careful not to associate itself closely with these organizations because their supranational aims were politically divisive. These organizations also included only a limited number of states represented in the EBU: Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK set up EFTA as an alternative economic organization in 1960. The British and Spanish applications for EEC membership were rejected in the early 1960s, with Denmark, Ireland and Norway also withdrawing their applications after France vetoed the British request in 1963. In 1957, Bezençon wrote that the Eurovision Network ‘demonstrated the much discussed idea of European union in action’, and the E.B.U. Bulletin even alluded to the EEC by describing the Eurovision Network as a ‘European Television Community’.30 However,\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 32\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:42 PM\n\nThe Western European Arrangement\n\n33\n\nin 1959, Bezençon emphasized the apolitical and technical nature of the Eurovision Network, asserting that it ‘would still be bogged down in theoretical discussions’ had it required the approval of parliaments and that ‘television can also be a deadly weapon of propaganda and controlled information’.31 In the mid-1960s, he underlined the EBU’s preference for internationalism rather than supranationalism by stating that the Eurovision Network was not ‘a super-State in embryo pursuing some hidden, or merely veiled, objective’.32 He believed that the Eurovision Network could be used ‘to build Europe’ but that ‘[a] united Europe is not the same thing as a unified Europe’ and ‘[t]he European game is therefore a dangerous one to play’ because ‘conceptions of Europe vary’.33 When Bezençon wrote about the Eurovision Network, he only sparsely mentioned the ESC as he saw it as just one aspect of the network’s production, albeit a desirable one for its internationalism, liveliness and modernity. The ESC was thus not conceived of or discussed by the Programme Committee as a generator of Western European integration or even the EBU’s flagship project, but as an experiment in cultural exchange and technical cooperation whose continuation would be determined by its audience reception and financial viability. The EBU did not even consider the contest to be a fixed event in its early decades: until the late 1970s it was never taken for granted that the contest would continue, and this was decided on a yearly basis. There was also always discussion in the Television Programme Committee about how the ESC should be improved, modernized and reformed: the representatives of the national broadcasting organizations felt pressured by the extensive attacks on the ESC in their national media to address issues such as the contest’s biased voting, excessive length, high costs, mediocre music and undistinctive artists. Bezençon – who would appear in the 1980 ESC to award the prize to the winner and his name would from 2002 be carried by a set of awards decided by artists, commentators, composers and journalists in the ESC – even acknowledged to the Television Programme Committee in 1965 that the ESC was ‘a most controversial programme’, popular among viewers but widely criticized in the media, and that the committee needed to decide whether it should be reformed – or abandoned altogether.34 In the 1960s and 1970s, the national broadcasting organizations made various suggestions to the Television Programme Committee, often threatening to withdrawal from the ESC if it\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 33\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:42 PM\n\n34\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nwas not reformed, and sometimes even suggesting that the contest be ended. Yet, what convinced the Television Programme Committee to continue the ESC was the fact that, already in the early 1960s, its officials were noting that it was one of the most popular television programmes in Western Europe. In its first research on the viewership of the ESC which it conducted in 1971, the EBU found that ratings admittedly varied across states and years – ranging in 1969 from 7 per cent of the audience in Italy to 66 per cent in Sweden and in 1971 from 38 per cent in Switzerland to 75 per cent in Malta – but they were nonetheless typically high, representing about half of the total audience of all of the states participating in the contest.35 Western Europeans were being united by the ESC not only as a result of the simultaneous development of their national television services, but also because of the transnational consumption of the products of the other cultural industry that was essential to the contest – that of popular music. The popular music industry did not need to promote itself through the ESC as much as the Eurovision Network relied on popular music, for the former was already established through other media, including commercial, transnational radio services like the ones of Radio Luxembourg and Radio Monte Carlo. However, the rules of the ESC never stated that an aim of the contest was the production of European cultural references, hits or stars, but ‘to encourage the production of original songs in the participants’ countries by bringing about rivalry between authors and composers through the international comparison of their works’. This was maintained as the aim of the contest throughout the Cold War era, albeit with some minor changes to the wording: that the songs should be of ‘high quality’, for example, was added to the rules for the 1966 ESC following widespread allegations – which nonetheless continued – of their mediocre quality.36 Although some ESC entries during the Cold War went on to become international hits in their original or cover versions, most did not. Still, whether or not they achieved commercial success as a result of the ESC, the contest’s artists already usually had cosmopolitan biographies, international ambitions and transnational careers that demonstrated the existence of a common market for popular music in Western Europe. Even before their participation in the ESC, artists had already been exposed to different musical influences from across Europe and the world through film, radio and records.\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 34\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:42 PM\n\nThe Western European Arrangement\n\n35\n\nIndeed, it was rare to find an ESC artist whose career was formed solely within national boundaries, cultural or geographical. Many ESC entries were also produced by a multinational group of artists. Citizenship of the state that they are representing has never been required of artists in the ESC: it would be very limiting considering the transnational character of the popular music industry. Some EBU members, namely the BBC, did seek to introduce such a rule in 1965, but it was rejected out of the interests of small states.37 Luxembourg and Monaco, for example, did not have a large pool of resident artists to choose from but did have commercial stations which were popular across Western Europe and made an association with these states attractive for foreign artists. Although it was not crucial for the development of a common popular music market in Europe, the ESC did contribute to this by internationally promoting the careers of artists and facilitating professional contacts between artists and record company officials who attended the contest. The rules that ESC entries had to conform to, especially the time limit of three minutes, as well as the multinational audience that they targeted, meant that the ESC also fashioned styles and tastes, and even genres, that came to be considered typical of the contest. This was traditionally derided in national media, and sometimes even within the EBU itself. In 1973, an official from the Norwegian national broadcasting organization, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), alleged that the contest had produced ‘a new “illicit” breed of popular songs’, ‘the Eurovision song’, that were neither commercially fashionable nor of high quality. In 1979, a report by light entertainment experts criticized ESC entries for trying to be too ‘international’ with ‘repetitive words accompanied by mime and rhythm’ and lacking ‘local colour’, thereby going against the contest’s aim of promoting national diversity.38 Yet, it was with such songs that the ESC helped forge Europop, a musical genre that developed from the mid-1960s. Characterized by ‘a bouncy beat, just one chorus hook, elementary lyrics’,39 Europop songs achieved transnational popularity because of their simple structures and universal themes focusing on consumption, fun and love. They were the ‘odes to joy’ of the postwar era: as the standard genre played in discos, shopping centres and summer resorts, Europop was the mirror and product of a period of prosperity and stability. It was not a genre of activism or protest but of affluence and pleasure, although it was also challenged in the ESC in the 1960s and 1970s by several\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.indb 35\n\n11/20/2017 4:18:42 PM\n\n36\n\nPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nentries that were critical of an overemphasis on consumption, commerce and money in contemporary societies. The summer holiday, especially spent in the Mediterranean region, was an inspiration and medium for Europop, reflecting the growing interconnectedness that tourism nurtured among Western Europeans during the Cold War, when the industry boomed through greater prosperity, improved transport connections and expanded labour rights. The summer holiday was something that marked Western Europe – and Yugoslavia – from Eastern Europe, where foreign travel was more restricted by the communist governments, or even from the United States, where paid holidays have been shorter and less culturally and legally institutionalized than in Western Europe. Europop also symbolized an era of relative peace, the most valuable thing that Western Europeans shared in light of the two world wars that had been waged in the first half of the twentieth century. In ‘Waterloo’, ABBA – the epitome of Europop – even trivialized a military battle by bringing it down to a Europop romance. In ABBA: The Museum in Stockholm, there is a recording of one of the songs’ lyricists, Stig Anderson, explaining that ‘Waterloo’ was chosen as the title because it is something ‘that everyone can relate to’, just as had been done with ABBA’s ‘Ring Ring’ for the Swedish national selection of the previous year, when it placed third. West Germany’s entry in the 1957 ESC, ‘Telefon, Telefon’ (Telephone, Telephone), was also conceived of in the same way: its singer, Margot Hielscher, confirms that her team deliberately chose an object that ‘is modern and international’, especially as telephone networks that had been destroyed in the war were still being reconstructed. The song furthermore incorporated multilingual lyrics in order to appeal to a pan-European audience.40 This was the first song that demonstrated some of the gimmicks that would become typical in the ESC of using international words, onomatopoeia like ‘boom’ and ‘ding’ or just ‘la la la’ to make entries that had to be sung in the official languages of the states that they represented more accessible to an international audiences.
