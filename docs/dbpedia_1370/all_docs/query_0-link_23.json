At its peak it was twice the size it is today, but with the secession of Finland in 1809 and the rise of Russia, Sweden changed its path and turned toward neutrality and a peaceful existence. Today, Sweden boasts a healthy economy and is an important member of the European Union, as well as a major contributor to international activities. This second edition of Historical Dictionary of Sweden both updates and expands upon the previous edition. Through a chronology, a list of acronyms and abbreviations, an introductory essay, a bibliography, appendixes, and hundreds of cross-referenced dictionary entries on significant people, events, and institutions, this dictionary provides information ranging from politics to economics, education to religion, and music to literature. Irene Scobbie has written extensively on Sweden and lectured on Sweden and Scandinavia at several universities, including the University of Edinburgh, where she was head of the Department of Scandinavian Studies before retiring.\n\nFor orders and information please contact the publisher\n\nSCARECROW PRESS, INC.

This applies most emphatically to Sweden. Once warlike and expansive, it has become neutral and if anything contented with its lot. Once terribly poor and backward, it has become uncommonly rich and advanced. Once conservative and dominated by the nobility and men in general, it has become a prolific source of social experiments with particular stress on equality. This has put Sweden in the forefront in many sectors, indeed, so much so that the Swedish “miracle” was widely admired and emulated. Yet, even now that the limitations and failings are more evident, it remains a country from which much can be learned. These changes obviously took decades and sometimes centuries, so they can only be correctly appreciated by observing the longer trends. That is just one reason why this Historical Dictionary of Sweden is so useful. And it is even more useful in its second updated and greatly expanded edition. For, it does take a long view, and it does show us where Sweden is coming from. But it also looks very carefully at the present situation, the problems as well as the achievements. The entries thus cover kings and nobles but also politicians, economists, businessmen, scientists, and cultural figures. Others describe the major institutions, political parties, trade unions, and newspapers or the educational system and literature. The flow of events can be grasped more readily thanks to a handy chronology. Those wanting to learn more about any particular aspect can consult a substantial and well-structured bibliography. This new edition, like the first edition, was written by someone who has devoted much of her life, initially, to learning about Sweden and then to teaching about Sweden, Irene Scobbie. The learning was at University of Newcastle, at University College London, and also in Sweden. The teaching was, among other places, at the University of Cambridge; the University of Aberdeen, where she became the head of the vii\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\nviii •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage viii\n\nEDITOR’S FOREWORD\n\nDepartment of Scandinavian Studies; and finally the University of Edinburgh, where she also held that post. Before this book, she also wrote a general work, Sweden: Nation of the Modern World, and numerous articles, monographs, and chapters on Sweden and especially Swedish literature. In 1985 she was awarded the Swedish Polar Star (1st Class) for service to Swedish culture.

I thank Jon Woronoff, the series editor, who read the completed manuscript and made many valuable comments. I express my gratitude to several Gothenburg friends, especially Dr. Maj-Lis Häggkvist, Dr. Monika Tunbäck Hansson, and above all fil. mag. Barbro Lindberg, for their expert advice, generous assistance, and encouragement in the production of this volume. Final responsibility for the text rests, of course, solely with the author.\n\nix\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage x\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xi\n\nReader’s Note\n\nThe Swedish alphabet has three extra characters—å, ä, and ö—which come at the end of the alphabet. Here they are treated as if unmodified and are placed alphabetically as a, a, and o, respectively. Swedish proper names have been used for the most part in this volume (e.g., Karl XII for Charles XII, Skåne for Scania), but there a few exceptions (e.g., Gothenburg instead of Göteborg) where the English version is much more familiar than the Swedish. The Swedish parliament is the Riksdag, a term used throughout this volume.\n\nxi\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xii\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xiii\n\nAcronyms and Abbreviations\n\nAB ABF AMS APK ASEA ATP DN EC EEC EFTA EU GDP HSB IOGT IT JO KB KDP KF LKAB LO LRF NATO NSF\n\nAktiebolag (Limited Company) Arbetarnas Bildningsförbund (Workers’ Educational Association) Arbetsmarknadsstyrelsen (Labor Market Board) Arbetarpartiet Kommnunisterna (Workers’ Communist Party) Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget Allmän Tilläggspension (general supplementary pension) Dagens Nyheter (Daily News) European Community European Economic Community European Free Trade Association European Union Gross Domestic Product Hyresgästernas Sparkasse- och Byggnadsförening (Tenants’ Savings and Building Society) International Order of Good Templars Information Technology Justitieombudsman Kungliga Biblioteket (Royal Library) Kristdemokraterna (Christian Democratic Party) Kooperativa Förbundet (Cooperative Union) Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB Landsorganisationen (Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions) Lantbrukarnas Riksförbund (Federation of Swedish Farmers) North Atlantic Treaty Organization Nationalsocialistisk Front (National Socialist Front) xiii\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\nxiv •\n\nSACO\n\nSÄPO SAS SEK SHT SKF SMR SR SR SRK SSU STF SUNS SvD SVT TCO UN USSR VAM WEF\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xiv\n\nACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS\n\nNU OECD OEEC OPEC SAC\n\nSAF\n\n7/27/06\n\nNationell Ungdom (National Youth) Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Organization for European Economic Cooperation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation (Swedish Workers’ Central Organization) Sveriges Akademikers Centralorganisation (Swedish Central Organization of Professional Workers) Svenska Arbetsgivareföreningen (Swedish Federation of Employers) Svenska Säkerhetspolisen (Swedish Security Police) Scandinavian Airlines System Swedish krona Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfarts Tidning Svenska Kullagerfabriken (Swedish Ball Bearing Company) Svenska Motståndsrörelsen (Swedish Opposition Movement) Statstjänstemännens Riksförbund (National Association of Swedish State Employees) Sveriges Radio (Sweden’s Radio) Svenska Röda Korsets (Swedish Red Cross) Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Ungdomsförbundet (Swedish Young Social Democrats) Svenska Turistföreningen (Swedish Tourist Association) Stockholms Unga Nationalsocialister (Stockholm Young National Socialists) Svenska Dagbladet Sveriges Television (Sweden’s Television) Tjänstemännens Centralorganisation (Central Organization of Salaried Employees) United Nations Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Vitt Ariskt Motstånd (White Arian Opposition) Wage Earner Funds\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xv\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xvi\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xvii\n\nChronology\n\nc. 12,000 B.C.\n\nNomadic tribes of reindeer hunters enter Sweden.\n\nc. 12,000–1500 B.C.\n\nStone Age\n\nc. 2500 B.C.

Occasionally it would burst its way into the mainstream through the actions (usually warlike) of a few dynamic Swedes, building an empire on the conquests of Gustav II Adolf, the “Lion of the North,” and Karl XII, but the impetus would soon be spent—the Swedish population too small, the country too northerly, and its infrastructure too primitive to sustain such exploits. The great transformation began in the last century and was brought about not by the military prowess of exceptional Swedes (indeed neutrality has been a key element in Swedish policy for almost two centuries) but by the creative ability of its people. Sweden has emerged as a model welfare state and a well-ordered democracy, to which economists, sociologists, feminists, architects, and scientists from sophisticated nations have paid study visits. Fortunately it has not lost sight of its past history and culture but rather built upon them, a red thread running through its development. Sweden now depends on international trade to preserve its high standard of living and, in a world of harsh international competition, often has to struggle to maintain its welfare system and its reputation. Despite its present difficulties, however, it remains one of the world’s most advanced and affluent democracies.\n\nLAND AND PEOPLE Sweden forms the eastern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula. Covering an area of 450,964 square kilometers (174,000 square miles), it is the xxvii\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\nxxviii •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xxviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nfourth largest country in Europe. An elongated country (55–69 degrees north latitude, 11–24 degrees east longitude), it has a north-south axis of 1,610 kilometers (1,000 miles) and a breadth of about 400 kilometers (250 miles). It is bordered by the North Sea in the southwest, Norway in the west and northwest, Finland in the northeast, the Gulf of Bothnia in the east, and the Baltic Sea in the southeast. The climate is influenced by prevailing westerly winds and the Gulf Stream, which keep the country warmer than its northerly position would suggest. The mean February (winter) temperature is –14°C (7°F) in the north to –1°C (30°F) in the south; the relative July (summer) figures are 4°C (57°F) and 17°C (63°F). Snow lies on the Norrland mountains for approximately eight months of the year, compared to one month in Skåne. In the far north, the midnight sun never sets during the summer (about six weeks). There are four main physical regions: the mountainous region of the north (Norrland), where the largest deposits of Sweden’s mineral resources—iron ore, copper, lead, pyrites, and some gold—are found, as well as extensive forests and fast-moving rivers; the central lowland lake region (Svealand and Götaland); a relatively low highland area (Småland); and the rich agricultural plain in the south (Skåne). The natural vegetation ranges from alpine (moss, lichen, dwarf birch) in the very far north, to coniferous (pine, spruce, aspen), and down to deciduous (beech, sycamore, elm, etc.) in the south. There are herds of domesticated reindeer in the northern mountains, while elk, badger, fox, and roe deer are common in central and southern Sweden. The brown bear is still found as far south as Dalarna, but the wolf and most other predators have become almost extinct. In 2005 Sweden’s population was 9,001,774. One and a half million live in the capital Stockholm, and 740,000 in greater Gothenburg (Sweden’s second largest city); over 85 percent of the population lives in the southern half of the country. In Malmöhus in the extreme south, there are 151 inhabitants per square kilometer, while in Norrbotten in the far north, there are only three. Life expectancy is high: 82.68 years for women and 78.35 for men. Ethnically Sweden is still a fairly homogeneous country, with about 90 percent of the population native Swedes. The Lapps were the earliest inhabitants, predating the Swedes. In the Middle Ages, Germans settled in Swedish towns; Walloons arrived later to work in the mines\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xxix\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxix\n\nor set up businesses, and Scottish and German soldiers were drawn to Sweden’s warrior kings. This century has seen a much greater influx of immigrants. Migrant workers began to arrive in the 1950s, and the numbers reached a peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1970 there were 73,000. The number of immigrants since 1974 has fluctuated between 20,000 and 30,000 per year, many of them from other Scandinavian countries. Others came to Sweden from Latin America, the Middle East, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece, often not as migrant workers but as refugees seeking asylum. By the 1990s about 10 percent of inhabitants were born abroad or were the children of immigrant parents. The official language is Swedish, a Germanic language. About 90 percent of the population belongs to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Sweden, which in 2000 severed its ties with the state. The other 10 percent are mostly Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist.\n\nECONOMY Sweden has few natural resources, but they include an abundance of iron ore and extensive forests. There was also a plentiful supply of hydroelectric power until Sweden became highly industrialized. Now electric energy covers less than half the country’s requirements, and nuclear energy and imported oil make up the deficit. Conversely, modern farming methods have turned the 19th-century shortage of arable land into a surplus. In this century, and increasingly from the 1960s, Sweden has developed her natural resources and manufactures specialized goods with world markets in view. Virtual self-sufficiency in certain vital sectors is preserved (e.g., food), but as an advanced trading nation, Sweden is exposed to international market forces and must export to preserve living standards. Sweden still has a mixed economy despite half a century of socialist governments. On the whole, they have managed the economy through social and fiscal legislation rather than state ownership. Nearly 90 percent of industrial output comes from private firms, the state and cooperative companies accounting for the rest. Over 60 percent of the Swedish workforce is employed in the public sector.\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\nxxx •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xxx\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSweden remains a relatively rich country, and a fairly even distribution of wealth has put it near the top of such living standard indicators as ownership of automobiles, computers, mobile telephones, televisions, refrigerators, freezers, and holiday homes.\n\nHISTORY Stone Age (c. 12,000–1500 B.C.) Archeological evidence shows that the first migration into Sweden started toward the end of the last Ice Age, around 12,000 B.C., when reindeer hunters and fishermen crossed the land bridge joining Sweden with the continent. These nomadic tribes used implements made of flint and bone. From about 2500 B.C. new tribes introduced agriculture and cattle rearing, which allowed a more settled existence. Dolmens, great stone monuments to the dead, have been found in west Sweden from that time, evidence of a belief in some form of afterlife. A form of peasant culture spread in south and west Sweden in what are now the provinces of Skåne, Halland, Bohuslän, and Västergötland. Beginning in 2000 B.C. there are traces of the Boat-Ax People (so-called because of their boat-shaped stone axes), a warlike people who had trading links with Europe. Their culture quickly spread in the southern and central areas, and archeologists believe that these tribes formed an elite class. The wealth of decorative objects found in the richer graves suggests that there was some kind of nobility in the country. Bronze Age (c. 1500–500 B.C.) Trade links with Europe and with the British Isles were maintained during the Bronze Age. Bronze was not produced in Scandinavia, but bronze objects reached Sweden along European trade routes. Burial mounds containing rich metal objects for use in the afterlife also date from this time. Most numerous on the west coast, they show the existence of an aristocracy, perhaps Boat-Ax People. Rock carvings, most impressively in Bohuslän on the west coast, have also survived from this period. They depict boats, humans, animals, tools, weapons, and disks and other designs suggesting sun cult and fertil-\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xxxi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxi\n\nity rites. For most of the Bronze Age, Sweden enjoyed a mild climate, but toward the end of the period, this deteriorated. The paucity of finds from this time coincides with the upheavals on the continent and the spread of the Celtic peoples across Europe, which endangered the old trade routes. Early Iron Age (c. 400 B.C.–A.D. 1) The colder climate and increased isolation caused Scandinavians to produce warmer clothing and habitations and to improve agricultural methods, and the foundations of Scandinavian culture were laid. An important step forward came with the use of iron for tools and weapons. Iron implements were at first imported, but gradually Swedish smiths learned to manufacture them from indigenous bog iron. Roman Iron Age (c. A.D. 1–400) As the Romans penetrated into Gaul, they came into contact with, and influenced, the Germanic tribes, including the Scandinavians. Trade links with the Roman Empire were established during this period, and a great many Roman coins found their way into Scandinavia. Written sources began to mention Scandinavia. Pliny the Elder (23–79) refers to an island far to the north, and Tacitus in his Germania (98) mentions for the first time the Suiones—that is, Swedes—“strong in men, arms, and their fleets.” Later Iron Age (c. 400–800) This was a period of unrest in Sweden, out of which emerged the first Swedish state. At some stage, the Svear, whose kingdom lay in Uppland and around Lake Mälaren with Uppsala as its center, must have gained supremacy over the powerful Götar and other independent tribes. The Svear kings extended their rule until by the beginning of the Viking period it embraced the whole of Sweden, except the extreme south, and even settlements on the southeast coast of the Baltic. The Svear gave the country its name: Sverige, from Svea rike, the Svear Kingdom.\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\nxxxii •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xxxii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nViking Age (c. 800–1060) Suddenly the Scandinavians emerged from their relative obscurity, making their name as intrepid merchant warriors, pirates, plunderers, and settlers. Danish and Norwegian Vikings raided western European settlements, while most Swedish Vikings journeyed eastward through Russia and down to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, seeking out lucrative trade with the Arab world. They established strongholds in Novgorod and Kiev and ruled much of European Russia. Gradually Swedish settlers in Russia were assimilated by the Slav population, and by the end of the Viking era the Swedes had returned to their former isolation. Little is known about the political situation in Sweden at this time. The country appears to have been loosely united under the Svear king Erik the Victorious of the Yngling dynasty, who ruled until about 994. His son Olof Skötkonung was the first Swedish king to accept Christianity, but his two sons who succeeded him were the last of the line, and the Yngling dynasty died with them in 1060. Sweden resisted Christianity longer than most European countries. The missionary Ansgar visited Sweden in 829 and set up a church at Birka, but with little lasting effect. Uppsala’s pagan temple, the great center for the Old Norse gods (Odin, Thor, and Freyr) survived until the 11th century. By the 1130s—when, symbolically, a Christian church was built on the old pagan temple site at Uppsala—Sweden had became a Christian country. The 12th, 13th, and 14th Centuries More than a century of turmoil followed the death of Olof Skötkonung and his sons toward the end of the 11th century as two families, the Sverkers and the Eriks, struggled for supremacy. A pretender, Erik Jadvardsson, according to legend went on a crusade to Finland, which became part of the Swedish kingdom. Little is known about Erik except that he died violently in 1160 and became Sweden’s patron saint. Sverkers and Eriks succeeded each other until Erik Eriksson, the last of his line, died in 1250. His brother-in-law Birger of the Folkung family became jarl (earl) and virtual ruler until his death in 1266. Birger jarl subjugated the rebellious magnates, gave laws securing the church and the Thing (Assembly), and helped establish trade links with Europe. He for-\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xxxiii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxiii\n\ntified Sweden’s coastal defenses, one of the forts forming the foundation of Sweden’s capital, Stockholm. Birger’s son Valdemar became king but was deposed in 1275 by his brother Magnus Ladulås. Magnus set up a Council of the Realm comprising representatives of the nobles, bishops, and lawmen, plus three officials: the lord high steward, the chancellor, and the marshal. In 1279 he exempted magnates serving in his cavalry from taxes and extended the exemption to include church lands in 1281. Despite these moves toward a feudal system, the Swedish peasants were not subjected to serfdom. Magnus’s son Birger succeeded him in 1290. The nobility, gaining rapidly in authority, deposed Birger in 1319, preferring his nephew Magnus, already king of Norway. During Magnus’s reign, a national code of law replaced the old provincial laws, laying the foundation of Sweden’s first constitution, and in 1323 the Peace of Nöteborg established the frontiers between Russia and Sweden-Finland. Magnus’s power was largely illusory, and in 1364 Magnus was deposed by the nobility, who elected instead Albrekt of Mecklenburg. When the latter proved less amenable than expected, the magnates deposed him, too, and appealed to the remarkable Queen Margareta, regent of both Norway and Denmark, to name a successor. Her 15-year-old great-nephew Erik of Pomerania, already heir to Norway and Denmark, was accepted as King Erik of Sweden and was crowned in Kalmar in 1397, ushering in the Kalmar Union, a Scandinavian union of crowns. Kalmar Union (1397–1521) As long as Queen Margareta was in control, the Kalmar Union held, but after her death in 1412, Erik quickly made himself very unpopular in Sweden. A successful revolt led by Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson in 1432 led to Erik’s downfall. Engelbrekt called a national assembly in 1435 and was elected regent. He had been used as a tool by the magnates to depose Erik and, having served his purpose, was murdered in 1436. Erik’s nephew Christopher of Bavaria was chosen as his successor to all three Scandinavian crowns in 1440, but when he died without an heir in 1448 the union began to crumble. The Swedish magnates elected Karl Knutsson as their regent, but the Danes chose Christian I of Oldenburg.\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\nxxxiv •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xxxiv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDissension within Sweden grew. Council members of both the nobility and the clergy preferred a distant union monarch, but others wanted a national leader to defend Sweden’s interests. The Sture family emerged in the 1470s to represent the anti-Union faction. On Karl Knutsson’s death in 1470, his nephew Sten Sture the Elder was elected regent, and at the Battle of Brunkeberg outside Stockholm he defeated Christian’s forces. Sweden was virtually ruled by regents for the next 40 years, but there was internal strife, with some Swedish magnates supporting Christian. When Sten Sture the Younger became regent in 1512, he determined to assert Swedish independence but was opposed by the forceful Archbishop Gustav Trolle. He had Trolle removed from office, which prompted a Danish attack in the name of the church as well as the Kalmar Union. In 1520 Christian II of Denmark killed Sten Sture, entered Stockholm, and, despite promises of amnesty, executed 82 of Sture’s leading supporters in the so-called Stockholm Bloodbath. His actions spurred anti-Unionist Swedes, especially the men of Dalarna, into rallying behind Gustav Eriksson Vasa, a nephew of Sten Sture’s widow, who expelled the Danes. In 1523 he was elected King Gustav I of an independent Sweden, and the Kalmar Union was defunct. The Early Vasas (1523–1611) The 27-year-old Gustav Vasa had borrowed heavily from Hanseatic League merchants, the royal coffers were empty, he was considered by many to be a usurper, and he had taken over a country that had been torn by civil strife for centuries. The Catholic Church was the single richest institution in Sweden. In 1527 Gustav persuaded the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament) to transfer church property to the crown and to make bishops responsible to the king. He appointed Olaus Petri, a Lutheran pastor, as secretary of Stockholm and his brother Laurentius Petri as archbishop of Uppsala. The Swedish Lutheran Church was established within a few years, and Gustav’s most pressing economic problems were solved. He reorganized his kingdom with vigor, using German jurists to establish a central administrative office, had a series of castles built to defend strategic points, and helped Sweden’s trade. Gustav survived several rebellions and by 1544 was able to proclaim the Swedish crown hereditary. By the time of his death in 1560, he had turned Sweden into an independent, well-ordered Lutheran state with a stable economy.\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xxxv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxv\n\nGustav’s defense policy had been to secure existing boundaries, but his sons Erik XIV (R. 1560–1568), Johan III (R. 1568–1592), and Karl IX (regent and then king, 1592–1611) sought to make Sweden a Baltic power, which brought them into conflict with Denmark, Poland, and Russia. When in 1561 Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia) acknowledged Swedish rule in exchange for protection, Sweden was committed to an expansion policy that led to the Northern Seven Years’ War (1563–1570), in which neither Sweden nor Denmark established superiority, and to further wars with Poland, Denmark, and Russia. On the sudden death of Karl IX in 1611, Sweden was threatened on all sides, and the immediate task for Karl’s son and heir, Gustav II Adolf (1594–1632), was to save his country, which he did through diplomacy and military force. Caught in internal troubles, Russia was prepared to evacuate Ingria and southwest Karelia in 1617 (Peace of Stolbova), and so Sweden emerged in possession of Finland and overland communications with Estonia. Age of Greatness (1611–1718) When the Thirty Years’ War broke out in Europe in 1618, Gustav II Adolf emerged as protector of the Protestant faith. He landed in Pomerania in 1630, defeated the Count of Tilly’s Catholic forces at Breitenfeld in Saxony, and marched triumphantly into southern Germany. In 1632 he defeated Gen. Albrecht von Wallenstein at Lützen but fell in battle. Before embarking on a full-scale foreign war, Gustav Adolf had, with his chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, introduced an effective system of government based on a council appointed by the king, and “colleges” equivalent to modern government departments. After his death, the system continued to function well, and Oxenstierna guided Sweden successfully to the end of the war and through peace negotiations. In the Peace of Westphalia (1648), Sweden gained western Pomerania, Verden, and Bremen (thus controlling the mouth of the Oder River and becoming a German power) and five million riksdaler to pay off her armies. Gustav Adolf’s only child, Kristina, ruled until 1654, when she abdicated in favor of her cousin Karl X Gustav, who followed an expansionist policy. In the Peace of Roskilde in 1658, he forced the Danes to relinquish the provinces of Blekinge, Skåne, Halland, and Bohuslån, but his sudden death in 1660 cut short his grand design of a united\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\nxxxvi •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xxxvi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nScandinavia under his rule. His son Karl XI successfully fought one desperate battle in 1676 for the retention of the southern provinces but then devoted his energies to internal affairs. During two long regencies, the nobility had increased their land holdings. Karl XI reclaimed estates for the crown (the “reduktions”). He established himself as absolute monarch, and, in a period of peace, he carried out far-reaching reforms in the field of the economy, the penal code, the church, education, and defense. The Age of Greatness started with one soldier king and ended with another. Karl XII succeeded his father in 1697. He was an untried 15year-old and, assuming the nobility would be disaffected after Karl XI’s reduktions, Denmark, Poland, and Russia prepared a triple attack. Demonstrating remarkable military skill, Karl forced Denmark to leave the alliance, defeated Tsar Peter’s numerically superior army at Narva in 1700, and forced the Poles to reject King August in favor of his own nominee Stanislav. In 1709, however, Karl overreached himself and was defeated by the Russians at Poltava. He fled to Turkey where he was held virtually a prisoner but finally escaped to Sweden to recruit a new army. The myth of his invincibility had been undermined, however, and his enemies closed in. Defending his western borders, Karl was shot dead in 1718. The Swedish government sued for peace and in the ensuing treaties lost Bremen, Verden, Swedish Pomerania, Ingria, Estonia, Livonia, and a large part of Karelia and had to abandon dreams of a northern empire. Age of Liberty (1718–1772) The absolute monarchy died with Karl XII. His sister Ulrika Eleonora was elected queen only after accepting a new constitution that reduced the role of the monarch to little more than a figurehead. The real power lay with the 24-member Council, which was responsible to the Riksdag. Two parties emerged, the Caps (Mössor) and the Hats (Hattar), which contended for political office. The Caps, led until 1732 by Arvid Horn, wanted a period of peace and moderation to help Swedish recovery. Horn’s foreign policy was to establish friendly relations with Britain and Russia, while his home policy was mildly protectionist. The general peace in Europe allowed Sweden’s merchant fleet to expand, especially in the Baltic, and by the 1730s trad-\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xxxvii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxvii\n\ning companies were set up, including the Swedish East India Company (1731). The Hats were more actively mercantilistic, and they were also much bolder in foreign affairs, hoping that a French alliance would help them to regain foreign territories lost on Karl XII’s death. In 1738 they ousted the Caps from office, and by 1741 they had launched a disastrous war against Russia. They clung to office until 1765 and were succeeded by the Caps, who in turn were defeated in 1769. The economy lurched from inflation to deflation, the country wearied of debilitating party squabbles, bribery, and corruption, and the Age of Liberty foundered in 1772. Despite its flaws, the age had fostered scientists of genius (e.g., Carolus Linnaeus, Anders Celsius, Christopher Polhem, and Emanuel Swedenborg) and saw the birth of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences. It also paved the way for land reforms and was a first step in the direction of a true parliamentary democracy. Gustavian Age (1772–1809) The Francophile Gustav III succeeded his father Adolf Fredrik in 1771 and tried to reconcile the Caps and Hats, but when this proved impossible, he staged a bloodless coup and in 1772 introduced a new constitution that considerably increased his powers. Initially his reign was characterized by effective and humane measures, including a reform of the civil service and of the penal code. He stabilized the currency and strengthened Swedish defenses. A degree of religious freedom was introduced for Jews and others, and some trading restrictions were lifted. His wave of popularity began to ebb, though, and in 1788 Gustav attempted to unite the nation behind him by staging a glorious war. He attacked Russia, hoping to regain lost Finnish provinces. A group of Swedish officers who considered the war unconstitutional formed the Anjala League and approached Catherine II of Russia, proposing negotiations. Gustav exploited the Anjala Conspiracy to suppress the nobility and arouse his people’s patriotism. The Danes chose that moment to declare war on Sweden, which had the effect of rallying the people behind the king. He determined to secure his authority at home and introduced the Act of Union and Security in 1789, a draconian measure giving him virtually absolute power. The nobility had long complained about the erosion of their privileges, and now a group of aristocrats plotted against\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\nxxxviii •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xxxviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nhim. In 1792 Gustav was assassinated at a masked ball in Stockholm. Culturally Gustav’s reign marked a significant point in Swedish history: Royal patronage led to a flowering of Swedish poetry, painting, architecture, and sculpture. Gustav established a Royal Opera House in 1782, the Swedish Academy in 1786, and the Royal Dramatic Theater in 1788, all of which have survived. Gustav’s son, Gustav IV Adolf, succeeded his father with no restriction on the monarch’s power. Conscientious but untalented and lacking his father’s charm, he proved unequal to the decisions necessary in a period of European revolution. From 1803 onward, he stubbornly supported Britain against France even after the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 when Russia, Sweden’s natural enemy, reached an agreement with Napoleon. Tsar Alexander invaded Finland in 1808 and by 1809 had reached the northern borders of Sweden itself. Despairing of the king’s ability to deal with the desperate situation, high-ranking Swedish army officers staged a coup and arrested the king, who was deposed and sent into exile. Russian peace terms were harsh, and Sweden lost the whole of Finland, which became part of the Russian Empire. The 19th Century In 1809 a new constitution restored the balance of power between the Riksdag and the crown but retained the four estates (nobility, clergy, burghers, and peasants), and the deposed king’s uncle, Gustav III’s brother, was elected as King Karl XIII. Since he was senile and had no heir, the selection of a crown prince was imperative. The choice fell upon Napoleon’s marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. Although he did not accede to the throne until 1818 (as Karl XIV Johan), he was ruler in all but name from his first arrival in Stockholm in 1810. His supporters had assumed that a dynamic French soldier would secure Napoleon’s backing and wrest Finland from Russia. However, Karl Johan’s “1812 policy” entailed an alliance with Tsar Alexander against Napoleon in return for help in forcing Denmark to relinquish Norway to Sweden. Karl Johan led Swedish troops against Napoleon in 1814 and then (under the terms of the Peace of Kiel in 1814) forced Denmark to cede Norway in return for Swedish Pomerania, Sweden’s only remaining possession in northern Germany. The Norwegians, however, had declared their independence, and they accepted a union with Sweden only under military\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xxxix\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• xxxix\n\nthreat. The Union of Crowns allowed them to keep their new constitution and virtual independence in internal affairs, but foreign policy was run from Stockholm. This subordinate role caused Norwegian animosity from the very outset, and although the union lasted until 1905, it often caused friction between the two countries. Karl Johan’s military actions while still crown prince were the last occasions on which Sweden was involved in a full-scale war. Despite his revolutionary background, he was an autocratic ruler, appointing ministers of his own choosing and expecting them to be responsible to him, not the Riksdag. He encountered increasing opposition from liberals demanding political, economic, and social reforms, and when in 1830 Lars Johan Hierta founded Aftonbladet, Sweden’s first modern newspaper, liberal journalists and politicians had a forum for their views. Faced with strong liberal criticism and with street riots when dissidents were arrested, Karl Johan gave some ground. By the time Oscar I succeeded his father in 1844, the pace of reform was already increasing. Oscar was more sympathetic to liberal ideas. In 1846 the guilds were replaced by much freer industrial and trade associations, and 1847 saw the removal of almost all restrictions on exports and imports. The tempo quickened in Sweden. The Göta Canal had been completed in 1832, and by 1854 a great railroad building project was started. There was social progress, too: women were given equal inheritance rights with men’s, legal reform made for a more humane penal code, and there was a greater measure of religious tolerance. When the 1848 revolutions in Europe sparked off disturbances in Stockholm, Oscar became more cautious. It was not until 1866, under his son Karl XV (R. 1859–1872), that the four-estate Riksdag was replaced by a bicameral parliament. In his foreign policy, Oscar initially allied himself with Russia, but by the time of the Crimean War (1853–1856), he was ready to assist Britain and France in the Baltic if they would help restore Finland to Sweden. He signed the November Treaty with the Western allies in 1855, but the theater of war moved to the Crimea, and nothing came of his scheme. Karl XV was an enthusiastic Pan-Scandinavianist, but in the DanoPrussian War (1864) the Swedish government refused to back up his promise of military support for Denmark. Sweden accepted a policy of neutrality, which she has endeavored to follow ever since. Karl’s brother, Oscar II (R. 1872–1907), who succeeded him, married a German princess\n\n06-340_01_Front.qxd\n\nxl •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:14 AM\n\nPage xl\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nand was sympathetic to the new German Empire, while several Swedish politicians were influenced by many of Otto von Bismarck’s social measures. There was also a tendency to see Germany as a bulwark against the Russian Empire. Even so, these pro-German sentiments never developed into active political alignment with Germany. In 1815 the Swedish population stood at 2.5 million, and by the end of the century it was over five million. Liberalized trade, modernization of agriculture, the rise of the middle classes, and improved educational standards created conditions that transformed a backward rural country into a modern industrial state. A demand for Swedish timber in the mid-19th century was followed in the 1870s by an international need for Swedish pulp. Using new techniques, the iron industry expanded rapidly in Kiruna and in the Bergslagen area, and by the turn of the century Swedish steel was being exported on a large scale. Swedish engineering inventiveness and entrepreneurial energy led to the founding of firms exploiting such Swedish inventions as ball bearings, farming equipment, and dynamite. There was a great movement from the land to the towns. In 1850, 90 percent of the population lived off the land, but by 1900 the figure was 50 percent and still rapidly falling. Industrial development was not free from recessions, and, during difficult periods, many Swedes emigrated, mostly to the United States. In the second half of the 19th century, many popular movements helped to bring about changes in society, such as the Free Church societies, the Fredrika Bremer Association for women’s rights, the Cooperative Movement for consumers’ rights, and the Temperance Movement and the Swedish Order of Good Templars, both aiming at reducing alcohol abuse. Folk high schools began to raise educational standards, and all this coincided with the founding of several inexpensive, quality newspapers. Even more fundamental to change in society was the setting up of the Social Democratic Party in 1889, with Hjalmar Branting as its guiding spirit. By 1898 Landsorganisationen (the Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions) was formed, which led to its counterpart, Svenska Arbetsgivareföreningen (the Swedish Federation of Employers) in 1902. This dynamic picture contrasts starkly with a moribund Riksdag, where most members of the First Chamber were aristocrats or highranking civil servants, while the Second Chamber was dominated by the\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 1\n\nTHE DICTIONARY\n\n–A– ABBA. Swedish pop group. The name is an acronym based on the four members’ forenames: Agneta Fältskog, Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus, and the Norwegian-born Anni-Fred Lyngsted. All four had enjoyed some success on the musical scene individually, but they reached international fame when they united. In 1973 ABBA represented Sweden in the European Song Contest with “Ring Ring,” written, as with all their material, by Ulvaeus and Andersson. They finished third, and the following year they won first prize with “Waterloo.” This opened the way to fame not just in Europe but also in the United States. By the time their third album ABBA was released in 1975, they were topping the charts as far afield as Japan and Australia. Their fourth album, Arrival, took the charts by storm with such hits as “Dancing Queen” and “Money, Money, Money.” Marriage and then divorce led to the breakup of the group in 1982, but their fame has survived. The 1990s saw an ABBA revival, with the compilation album ABBA Gold released in 1992. Since then, other material has been reissued, and there is now in addition a musical, Mamma Mia, produced by Ulvaeus and Andersson, based on ABBA’s favorite songs. First staged successfully in London in 1999, Mamma Mia has been performed in Canada, the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea. ÅDALEN. An area in Ångermanland, northern Sweden, at the center of the paper pulp industry. Ådalen is associated with the labor unrest that came to a head there in 1931. Striking industrial workers were incensed when the employers enlisted strikebreakers.

Five civilians were killed. The incident was reported emotionally throughout Sweden and helped to bring about the fall of Carl Gustaf Ekman’s minority Liberal government in the ensuing election in 1932. The Social Democratic Party then gained power and continued to form the government for the next 40 years. In 1967 Bo Widerberg made a successful film of the incident, entitled Ådalen 31. ADLERCREUTZ, CARL JOHAN (1757–1815). Swedish aristocrat and military general active in Finland during the Finno-Russian War of 1808–1809. In March 1809, fearful that Russia would invade the whole of Sweden and aware of King Gustav IV Adolf’s ineffectiveness, Adlercreutz sided with the revolutionaries and helped to arrest the king and bring about the coup d’état that led ultimately to a new constitution and the founding of the Bernadotte dynasty. ADLERSPARRE, GEORG (1760–1835). Swedish aristocrat and military general. During the 1809 coup d’état he moved his army from the Norwegian border to Stockholm to assist Carl Johan Adlercreutz and the revolutionary forces in deposing King Gustav IV Adolf. ADOLF FREDRIK (1710–1771). Swedish king, first king of the House of Holstein-Gottorp and descendent of Karl XI. After defeating Sweden in 1743, Empress Elizabeth of Russia imposed the condition that her favorite, Adolf Fredrik, be adopted as successor designate to Fredrik I, whom he succeeded in 1751. His reign coincided with the Age of Liberty (1718–1772), when the crown enjoyed little political power. He was dominated by his much more forceful wife, Lovisa Ulrika, sister of Frederick the Great of Prussia, but was personally uninterested in politics and played an insignificant role in the country’s affairs. He was succeeded in 1771 by his much more charismatic son, Gustav III. AFTONBLADET. See NEWSPAPERS. AGRARIAN PARTY.

In 1870, more than 70 percent of the Swedish population earned their living from agriculture and its subsidiaries, but by the end of that century the figure had fallen to 50 percent, and by the 1970s it was down to 6 percent. This trend has accelerated as manufacturing industries expand and the move from rural to urban areas increases. Today agriculture accounts for less than 4 percent of the GDP. Less than 6 percent of the land area is tilled, and farms are relatively small and highly mechanized. Despite the drastic reduction in the workforce, output has increased, and yields of Swedish farms are among the highest in the world, thanks to mechanization, fertilizers, field drainage, and experiments in plant breeding that have led to cereal crops thriving as far north as Norrland. Most of the arable land is in the south, especially in Skåne where almost 80 percent of the land is under cultivation. The main crops are wheat, sugar beets, barley, oats, and potatoes. Environmental problems have arisen recently, making it necessary to reduce the use of fertilizers. Livestock breeding (cattle, pigs, and poultry) is more important than cereals; dairy cows are important in all parts of the country, while pig and poultry farms are concentrated in the extreme south. ÅLAND ISLANDS (Finnish AHVENANMAA). Now politically part of Finland, this region, consisting of 6,554 islands, lies on the border of the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia almost exactly halfway between Sweden and Finland. There are some 24,000 inhabitants, more than 96 percent of whom are Swedish speaking. As long as Finland was in union with Sweden, Åland’s position was not in doubt, but at the end of the Swedish-Russian War of 1808–1809, Sweden had to accept terms dictated by Tsar Alexander I, and in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn (1809), she lost one-third of her territory, including all of Finland and the Åland Islands. Russia had two outlets to the west, the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland. With a threat of war between Russia and Britain and France, Russian troops began to fortify Åland in 1833. As a prelude to the Crimean War, a French-British fleet entered the Baltic in 1854, and French troops landed on Åland and destroyed garrisons there. Hoping to involve Sweden in a war against Russia, the allies invited Oscar I to take over the Åland Islands, but he declined unless given a guarantee that Finland would be restored\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n4 •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 4\n\nÅLAND ISLANDS (FINNISH AHVENANMAA)\n\nto Sweden, a condition ignored by the allies. Ultimately, all Sweden got out of the affair was a guarantee that Russia would be prevented from regarrisoning Åland. At the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in November 1917, Finland declared its independence from Russia, but by January 1918 civil war had broken out between the White and the Red Finnish armies. The Åland islanders had in August 1917 expressed their wish to be reunited with Sweden, but Russian troops invaded Åland in 1918. At the height of the Finnish civil war, Sweden sent two warships to evacuate any Ålanders wishing to leave. A Swedish garrison took over from the Russians until relieved by German troops aiding the Finnish White army. They left at the end of 1918, and in 1919 the islanders held a referendum in which 95 percent voted for reunion with Sweden. The Finnish government was opposed to this and in 1920 arrested two leading Åland islanders and installed a Finnish garrison on the islands. The language question played a part here. Swedish-speaking Åland was a necessary part of the Swedishspeaking Finns’ shield against the Finlandization program being pursued with vigor in some quarters. Sweden referred the Åland question to the League of Nations, and both Finland and Sweden agreed to accept the League’s ruling. A three-man commission appointed by the League recommended in 1921 that the Åland Islands should remain Finnish but that the Swedish language should be safeguarded and that the islanders should be given a measure of autonomy and guaranteed neutrality. When Soviet Russia attacked Finland at the outset of the Winter War in 1939, the Finns set up military installations on Åland, but at the Moscow peace talks the following year Russia insisted that they be dismantled. Finnish troops took up position on Åland again when the Continuation War started in 1941, but, with the cease-fire in 1944, all fortifications were destroyed. In 1945 the islanders again requested reunion with Sweden, but Sweden declined. The Finnish parliament passed a new Åland law in 1961, approved by the Åland council, granting the islands virtual autonomy. Åland sends a representative to the Finnish parliament in Helsinki but runs its own internal affairs, has its own flag, and issues its own postage stamps. The region’s economy rests on shipping, agriculture, fishing, and, increasingly, tourism. There are civil and commercial air links with\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 5\n\nALLIANSEN (THE ALLIANCE)\n\n• 5\n\nStockholm and Åbo (Turku) and frequent car ferry services from Sweden and Finland. Despite despair and indignation at the attitudes toward them in the past, the Åland islanders on the whole now consider that they have achieved the most a small territory could have hoped for.

He studied at Uppsala University, and then in 1940 he joined the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, where he was appointed professor of electronics in 1945 and of plasma physics in 1964. In 1967 he accepted a post at the University of California. His pioneering work was in plasmas and their behavior in magnetic and electric fields. In 1942 he predicted the existence of waves in plasmas (known as Alfvén waves). His theories have been applied to the motion of particles in the Earth’s magnetic field, to plasmas, and to experimental nuclear fusion reactors. He himself was opposed to nuclear energy. In 1970 he shared the Nobel Prize for physics with Louis Néel. ALFVÉN, HUGO (1872–1960). Swedish composer and conductor. From 1910 to 1930, he was musical director at Uppsala University, and from 1910–1947 he conducted the famous male voice choir Orphée Drängar. His orchestral compositions include five symphonies, the rhapsody “Midsommarvaka” (1904), tone poems, and the ballets Bergakungen (The mountain king, 1923) and Den förlorade sonen (The prodigal son, 1957). His music reflects the influence of Swedish folk melodies. ALLIANSEN (THE ALLIANCE). Twice, in the 1970s and 1990s, the Swedish Social Democratic government was defeated and a nonsocialist coalition was formed. In both cases the new governments foundered because the nonsocialist political parties within the coalition could not agree among themselves, and the Social Democrats were returned to office. In August 2004, Fredrik Reinfeldt, leader of the Moderate Party, approached the other nonsocialist party leaders, suggesting an Allians för maktskifte i valet 2006 (Alliance for Shift\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n6 •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 6\n\nALLMÄN TILLÄGGSPENSION (ATP) (GENERAL SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION)\n\nof Power 2006). While retaining their own party status, members of the Alliance would have working groups in such areas as finance and economic growth, enterprise, education and research, health, law, foreign relations, and security. The leaders of the Liberal, Center, and Christian Democratic parties responded positively. They agreed to put together a manifesto by January 2006, in time for the next general election in September 2006. Sixty percent of those employed in Sweden are dependent on the state. The aims of the Alliance are to reduce the size of the public sector, to prevent state monopolies from stifling private enterprise, to reduce unemployment, and to lower the tax burden. All four nonsocialist parties within the Alliance are having to compromise on certain issues, not least the extent to which they wish to retain or modify social welfare benefits introduced over the years by successive socialist governments. Public opinion polls give them a slight lead over the Social Democrats supported by the Left and Environment parties. The Moderate Party has gained most recently, taking support not from other Alliance parties but from the Environment and Left parties. It is assumed that if the Alliance is successful at the polls in 2006, Reinfeldt will form a government. However disillusioned some voters may be with the present regime, the Social Democrats nevertheless have solid backing from the trade unions and many years’ experience in electioneering, and the Alliance members are not complacent. ALLMÄN TILLÄGGSPENSION (ATP) (GENERAL SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION). Most white-collar and professional workers subscribed to private superannuation schemes to supplement the basic flat-rate state pension established in 1947. In the early 1950s, the Social Democratic Party decided to introduce a national compulsory supplementary scheme with central pension funds administered by the state. This caused the dissolution of the Social Democratic–Agrarian coalition, for the Agrarians objected to the compulsory element in the proposal. The other nonsocialist political parties were afraid of the economic power a central fund would put into government hands. A national referendum on the issue held in 1957 was indecisive, giving the Social Democrats’ scheme only 46 percent of the votes. The Second Chamber of the Riksdag was dissolved, and after the ensuing\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 7\n\nALMQVIST, CARL JONAS LOVE (1793–1866)\n\n• 7\n\nelection the chamber was exactly balanced between the socialist and nonsocialist parties. When Prime Minister Tage Erlander proposed his slightly amended pension scheme, one Liberal member defected, and the proposal was accepted. ATP guaranteed retiring employees up to 60 percent of their average income during their highest-paid 15 years of employment. The scheme had been introduced in an economic “fair weather” period, but by the 1980s it was proving to be too expensive. A new system was introduced in 1994. Whereas ATP was calculated on the 15 best years of an employee’s working life, pensions are now based on the employees’ entire working life. Employees must now invest partly in funds of their own choice, and so the final pension depends on the strength of the Swedish economy. ALMQVIST, CARL JONAS LOVE (1793–1866). Swedish author, journalist, polemicist, and teacher. After graduating from Uppsala University in 1815, Almqvist worked for seven years as a civil servant in the Ministry of Education and Church Affairs. In 1824 he married a peasant girl and moved to Värmland with like-minded friends to live the life of the ideal farmer. By 1825 he had returned to Stockholm. Genuinely interested in education, Almqvist taught at a new experimental secondary school in Stockholm and from 1829 was its headmaster. He wrote a number of textbooks while there, including a book on Swedish orthography in 1832, which had run to its fourth edition in 1854. A prolific author of novels, plays, poems, essays, and articles, Almqvist wrote for most of his adult life, but dating his works is sometimes difficult because their publication—mostly in volumes of collected works with the general title Törnrosens bok (The book of the wild rose, 1833–1851)—was often much later than their completion. In the 1820s and early 1830s, Almqvist’s works were romantic, frequently with a tendency to the exotic. Amorina (1822) and Drottningens juvelsmycke (The queen’s tiara, 1832) mark the high point of his achievement in this period, and modern adaptations of them for the theater, opera, and television have increased their popularity and underlined Almqvist’s strange but undoubted genius. Another, more realistic aspect of Almqvist’s writing became more prevalent from 1838, the year in which he published his essay “Svenska\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n8 •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 8\n\nALSTRÖMER, JONAS (1685–1761)\n\nfattigdomens betydelse” (The significance of Swedish poverty), a lively characterization of ordinary Swedish people and their temperament. There was a restlessness and unpredictability about Almqvist that was very marked during this period. He became ordained so that he would be qualified for clerical posts, and he applied (unsuccessfully) for a chair in languages and aesthetics at Lund University. Then in 1839 he began to contribute regularly to the new liberal newspaper Aftonbladet, putting forward in a series of articles his program for the reform of society. That year he published Det går an (which in English publication was called Sara Videbeck), a surprisingly modern, realistic novel dealing with an attractive, very capable young woman who, having witnessed her mother’s degradation in an unhappy marriage, is determined not to be caught in a similar trap. She agrees to live with her suitor, Albert, but only on condition that they remain unmarried and retain full independence. The book profoundly shocked society and gave rise to a nationwide debate on the position of women in society and the sanctity of marriage. By 1841 Almqvist was forced to resign his teaching post and found other openings barred to him. He had to defend a charge of heresy, now had no hope of a church appointment, and had to support himself and his family by his pen. He continued to write for Aftonbladet and other radical papers. Ill and exhausted, he became involved in dubious transactions, which came to a head in 1851. He was accused of embezzlement and the attempted murder by arsenic poisoning of a money lender, von Scheven, a case that has never been satisfactorily solved. He fled to America and in Philadelphia bigamously married the owner of a boardinghouse. In 1865 he returned to Europe as “Professor Carl Westermann” and died in Bremen, Germany, in 1866. At the height of his career, this enigmatic man produced some of the best literature in the Swedish language. He was also the most influential, if also controversial, polemical Swedish writer of his day, and he did much to advance Swedish liberal and feminist causes in the mid-19th century. ALSTRÖMER, JONAS (1685–1761). Swedish manufacturer and farmer who epitomized the Age of Liberty’s attitude to the economy. Having spent several years in England and Holland, Alströmer returned to Sweden in 1724 and founded a textile factory in his native\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 9\n\nANDRÉE, SALOMAN AUGUST (1854–1897)\n\n• 9\n\nAlingsås northeast of Gothenburg, turning the government’s mercantilistic approach to his advantage by obtaining large state subsidies. It was an ambitious scheme, employing English techniques, machinery smuggled out of Holland, and both Swedish and foreign labor, and the business became an important textile center. A government change of policy in the 1760s led to a withdrawal of subsidies, and the enterprise was not robust enough to survive. Alströmer was also enthusiastic about agricultural developments and was the first in Sweden to grow potatoes as a source of food on his farm, Nolhaga. He also improved Swedish sheep breeding by importing sheep for quality wool for his factory. He was ennobled in 1751. ANCKARSTRÖM, JOHAN JACOB (1762–1792). Swedish officer and regicide. Gustav III’s Act of Union and Security of 1789 reduced the Swedish aristocrats’ privileges and gave the monarch almost absolute power. A group of disaffected aristocrats led by old General Pechlin branded Gustav a tyrant and conspired against him. Anckarström, who had been accused of defaming the king’s name in 1790 but had his case suspended through lack of evidence, bore Gustav a grudge. He was hired by the conspirators to assassinate the king. At a masked ball at the Royal Opera House in Stockholm on 16 March 1792, Anckarström shot Gustav, who died two weeks later. After the shot, the doors were locked and the names of everyone present were recorded. When the police found Anckarström’s discarded pistols on the premises the following day, they arrested and charged him. Despite Gustav’s deathbed request for clemency for his killer, Anckarström was publicly flogged for three days and then executed. The family changed its name to Löwenström in 1792. ANDRÉE, SALOMAN AUGUST (1854–1897). Swedish engineer and Arctic explorer. Toward the end of the 19th century, several explorers set off to place their national flag on hitherto unclaimed territory (Nansen, Scott, Amundsen, and Nordenskjöld, for instance). Together with Knut Fraenkel and Nils Strindberg, Andrée set off on 11 July 1897 from Spitzbergen for the North Pole in the balloon Örnen (The eagle). They were not heard of again until 1930 when a Norwegian ship found their last camp on White Island. From there, their remains were taken to Stockholm. Using the material found on\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n10 •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 10\n\nANJALA CONSPIRACY\n\nWhite Island, the Swedish Anthropological and Geographical Society published Med Örnen mot polen (With the Eagle toward the North Pole, 1930), which contained photographic material developed after 33 years. The Andrée Museum in Gränna now houses exhibits from the expedition. Swedish author Per Olof Sundman based his prizewinning novel Ingenjör Andrées Luftfärd (translated as The Flight of the Eagle, 1967) on the documentary evidence. The novel was subsequently filmed by Jan Troell, with Max von Sydow in the leading role. ANJALA CONSPIRACY. When Gustav III declared war on Russia in 1788, there was opposition within the officer corps on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. Maj. J. A. Jägerhorn, a Finland-Swedish officer, represented a group wanting Finnish independence from Sweden. On his initiative, seven officers sent the so-called Liikala Note to Catherine II of Russia in August 1788, decrying the war and proposing negotiations between the empress and “the nation’s representatives.” Meanwhile, when Gustav demanded an oath of loyalty from his Finland-Swedish officers, 112 of them formed the Anjala League, signing a declaration on the illegality of the war and the necessity of peace negotiations and the recall of the Riksdag. Gustav’s own brother, Duke Karl (subsequently King Karl XIII), was apparently implicated, although he escaped recriminations afterward. For Empress Catherine, the salient point was the separation of Finland from Sweden, a thought alien to the majority of the Anjala signatories. Gustav’s Russian campaign was going badly, but the Danes, ironically, helped him at this point by threatening to occupy Sweden via Norway. Gustav skillfully played upon the Swedes’ hatred of the Danes and resentment of the nobility and officer class, and his people rallied behind him. Wishing to halt Russian expansion in the Baltic, Britain exerted pressure on Denmark to accept a cease-fire. At the beginning of 1789, the leaders of the Anjala League were arrested (except for Jägerhorn, who had gone over to Russia). They were treated leniently, but Col. J. H. Hästesko was made the scapegoat and was executed in 1790. ARBETARNAS BILDNINGSFÖRBUND (ABF) (WORKERS’ EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION). Founded in 1912 on the initiative\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 11\n\nBANÉR, JOHAN (1596–1641)\n\n• 11\n\nof Rickard Sandler, ABF’s aim was “by means of free voluntary educational activity independent of political party and religion, to educate its members for the Labor Movement and society and to make cultural values available to all citizens.” ABF is an association of political, cultural, trade-union, and cooperative organizations. Subsidized by the state, it arranges lectures and study circles throughout Sweden. It publishes a series of educational pamphlets and the periodical Fönstret (Window). It was particularly influential in the 1920s and 1930s, when formal education for most working-class children ended at the age of 13 or 14.\n\n–B– BAGGE, GÖSTA (1882–1951). Swedish Conservative politician and professor of national economy. Bagge was a member of the Riksdag from 1932 until 1947 and leader of the Conservative Party from 1935 to 1947. At the outbreak of World War II, Bagge pressed successfully for a four-party national government rather than a twoparty coalition and served as minister of education in Per Albin Hansson’s government from 1939 until 1944. He was more enthusiastic than most of his cabinet colleagues about assisting Finland in the Winter War, and he voted to allow German troops (the Engelbrecht Division) to pass though Swedish territory to support the Finns against Russia in the Continuation War. A highly respected academic, Bagge founded the Institute of Social Policy in Stockholm in 1920. BANÉR, JOHAN (1596–1641). Swedish general during the Thirty Years’ War. During his short but brilliant military career, King Gustav II Adolf had carefully trained a number of talented young officers, including Banér and Lennart Torstensson. In the attempt to secure Sweden’s position in Germany after Gustav Adolf’s death in 1632, Banér won a battle at Wittstock in 1636 and at Chemnitz in 1639. He was governor-general of Swedish Pomerania and from 1638 was also commander of Swedish troops in Germany. He died in Germany and was succeeded by Torstensson. Banér’s statue stands in Riddarholm Church in Stockholm.\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n12 •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 12\n\nBELLMAN, CARL MICHAEL (1740–1795)\n\nBELLMAN, CARL MICHAEL (1740–1795). Swedish lyric poet. Born into a well-to-do family and educated with a career in banking or the civil service in mind, Bellman preferred to exercise his lyric talents. His drinking songs and satirical sketches, which he accompanied on his cittra (a form of lute), were soon in demand, and he became a well-known Stockholm entertainer. Often in financial difficulties, he once had to flee to Norway to avoid his creditors, but his position improved when, as Gustav III’s protégé, he was given a sinecure as director of the national lottery. Bellman composed more than 1,500 poems, but he is best known for his meetings of Bacchi Orden (the Bacchus Order), a drinking club, and above all for his Fredmans epistlar (Fredman’s epistles, 1790). These epistles are a cycle of songs centered on a real Stockholm character, Fredman, a successful watchmaker until he ruined his life through excessive drinking, and on his dissolute companions, whom Bellman half satirizes and half idealizes. The poems range in style from bawdy songs, to burlesque, to naturalistic, bustling action sketches describing low life in 18th-century Stockholm, to rococo charm as a party takes a ferry to a Stockholm island or goes into the surrounding countryside to picnic alfresco. Ulla Winblad, a prostitute; Movitz, a musician; and Fredman himself are depicted in a language that can be drastic, sometimes almost breathless, touching, and humorous, with amusingly inappropriate biblical, classical, or mythological allusions. It is a measure of Bellman’s genius that he arouses affection for what in effect was a group of torpors and loose women. Fredman’s Epistles was followed by Fredmans sånger, (Songs of Fredman, 1791), a collection of drinking songs and lyrical poems, some of which are frequently performed by professionals and laymen alike. Bellman’s lifestyle caught up with him. He contracted tuberculosis and fell victim to depression. His financial state was almost always precarious, and when King Gustav was assassinated in 1792, Bellman lost royal patronage. He died in 1795 after a spell in debtors’ prison. He remains one of Sweden’s most popular poets, however, and there is now a Bellman Society devoted to his memory and a Bellman Prize, awarded by the Swedish Academy to commemorate “a truly outstanding poet.” See also LITERATURE.\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 13\n\nBERGMAN, INGRID (1915–1982)\n\n• 13\n\nBERGMAN, INGMAR (1918– ). Swedish film and stage director, born in Uppsala. From an early point in his career, Bergman alternated between stage and cinema. He was the director of Helsingborg Civic Theater (1944–1946), Gothenburg’s Civic Theater (1946–1949), Malmö’s Civic Theater (1954–1960), and then Stockholm’s Dramatic Theater (1963–1966). Meanwhile his film career began in the script department of Svensk Filmindustri, where he wrote the script for the impressive film Hets (Frenzy, 1944). He then went on to direct many films that have become classics, such as Sommarnattens leende (Smiles of a summer night, 1953), Smultronstället (Wild strawberries, 1957), Det sjunde inseglet (The seventh seal, 1957), Jungfrukällan (The virgin spring, 1960, for which he won an Oscar), and Såsom i en spegel (Through a glass darkly, 1961). By this time Bergman had become something of a cult figure for art cinema audiences. He became increasingly preoccupied with guilt, anguish, repression, and death, given expression in such bleak masterpieces as Skammen (Shame, 1968) and Viskningar och rop (Cries and whispers, 1972). His last film, for which he was awarded another Oscar, was Fanny och Alexander (Fanny and Alexander, 1982), a surprisingly warm evocation of many elements from his own Uppsala childhood. Bergman has also written for television and produced a greatly acclaimed production of Mozart’s Magic Flute. In 1987 he published Laterna magica, his memoirs. BERGMAN, INGRID (1915–1982). Together with Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman is one of the most famous film actresses Sweden has produced. She was born in Stockholm and studied at the Royal Dramatic Theater, after which she was offered a contract by Svensk Filmindustri. She won acclaim for her role in the Swedish film Intermezzo and was promptly offered a contract to play the same part in a Hollywood version, Escape to Happiness, with Lesley Howard. A series of romantic roles followed in such films as Casablanca (1942); For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943); Gaslight (1944), for which she won her first Oscar; and Spellbound (1945). In 1978 she returned to Sweden to make Höstsonaten (Autumn sonata), directed by Ingmar Bergman. Her memoirs appeared in 1980.\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n14 •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 14\n\nBERNADOTTE, COUNT FOLKE (1895–1948)\n\nBERNADOTTE, COUNT FOLKE (1895–1948). Oscar II’s grandson and Gustav V’s nephew, Count Bernadotte dedicated his life to humanitarian causes. In the last phase of World War II, Sweden, as a neutral country, made great efforts to save Scandinavians and others imprisoned in Germany. Bernadotte was able to establish some kind of rapport with Heinrich Himmler, the SS leader, and through the Swedish Red Cross, whose delegate he was, Bernadotte succeeded in saving some 30,000 people, including 19,000 Scandinavians, from concentration camps. He also played an active part in arranging the peaceful withdrawal of German occupation forces from Norway in 1945. In 1948 Bernadotte was asked by the United Nations to mediate in Palestine, and he produced a partition plan, but he was murdered in Jerusalem that year by Jewish terrorists. BERNADOTTE, COUNT LENNART (1909–2004). Bernadotte was born Prince Gustaf Lennart, son of Prince Wilhelm, Gustav V’s second son, and the Grand Duchess Maria, granddaughter of Alexander II. An enthusiastic photographer, he became editor of the photographic magazine Foto and cofounded a film company, Artwork, which later won an Oscar for the documentary on Thor Heyerdahl’s Kon-tiki expedition. In 1932 he caused a scandal by marrying a commoner without royal consent and thus forfeited his titles and any chance of inheriting the throne. He was given Mainau, an island at the end of Lake Constance, by his grandmother, Queen Victoria, wife of Gustav V. Bernadotte greatly extended the rose gardens and arboretum on the island, which has close links with Kew Gardens, London, and over the years could boast some 350,000 flowers and the largest butterfly house in central Europe. He was a proponent of environmental gardens and of the Green Movement in the 1950s and was ennobled once more as Count of Wisborg in recognition of his sterling work on his “Island of Flowers.” Every year for more than half a century Mainau served as host to a gathering of Nobel Prize laureates and students, who discussed scientific and ecological issues.

Only then, in 1976, did he marry Lillian Craig, a commoner. He was chairman of the National Athletics Association, the Swedish Olympic Games Committee, and the Swedish Automobile Association. A popular figure both at home and abroad, he frequently led Swedish international trade missions. BERWALD, FRANZ. See MUSIC. BERZELIUS, JÖNS JACOB (1779–1848). Swedish chemist and medical doctor. He was a professor at the Caroline Institute in Stockholm from 1807 until his death, and in 1807 he founded the Society of Swedish Doctors. His greatest achievements were in the field of chemistry and allied subjects. Following on from John Dalton’s atomic theory of 1803, Berzelius had by 1814 obtained accurate atomic weights of a number of elements. He discovered the elements selenium and thorium and was able to isolate others, including calcium and silicon. He developed the system of using letters of the alphabet for chemical symbols and formulas and urged the classification of minerals according to chemical composition. In 1818 Berzelius produced his first periodic table of chemical elements, a system still in use today. He was ennobled in 1818 and was awarded the Royal Society’s gold medal for his outstanding achievements. BILDT, CARL (1949– ). Swedish politician, former prime minister, and leader of the Moderate Party. Bildt’s family background is political. His father was a senior civil servant, and his great-great-grandfather, Gillis Bildt, was prime minister for one year (1888–1889). After studying politics at Stockholm University (1968–1973), Bildt served as chairman of the Moderate Party’s Students’ Union (1973–1974) and of the European Democrat Students (1974–1976), then became an adviser to the Department of Economics (1976–1978) and undersecretary of state (1979–1981). He was elected a member of the Riksdag in 1979 and became leader of the Moderate Party in 1986. Learning from the difficulties experienced by previous nonsocialist political parties trying to cooperate with each other, Bildt and Bengt Westerberg, then leader of the Folkpartiet (i.e., Liberal Party), declared their intention in 1990 of governing in tandem and put\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n16 •\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 16\n\nBIRGITTA, SAINT (SAINT BRIDGET; DEN HELIGA BIRGITTA) (1303–1373)\n\nforward a joint six-point plan. They consolidated this plan in their publication A New Start for Sweden, which appeared in April 1991. In the elections in September of that year, the socialist parties lost their majority, and a four-party nonsocialist government was established under Bildt’s premiership. A fairly young politician, Bildt tried energetically to move Sweden toward a strong market economy. In 1994 he successfully negotiated Sweden’s application for membership of the European Union. Rising unemployment during his term of office caused some loss of support for his party, and in the 1994 elections the Social Democrats were able to form a government again. His intelligence and experience in international affairs have gained him respect on the world scene, and, as he comes from neutral Sweden, he was appointed the UN mediator in the Bosnian conflict in 1995–1997. BIRGITTA, SAINT (SAINT BRIDGET; DEN HELIGA BIRGITTA) (1303–1373). Medieval Swedish visionary. Birgitta was born into one the most powerful families in Sweden. She was the daughter of Birger Persson, a knight and lawman, and Ingeborg of the royal Folkung family. At 13 she was married to the 18-year-old Ulf Gudmarsson, who also became a lawman, and for some years she was Mistress of the Robes for Queen Blanche of Namur, King Magnus Eriksson’s consort. Birgitta and her husband had a reputation for doing good works. They went on a pilgrimage to Nideros (Trondheim) in Norway and to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Ulf died shortly afterward in 1344. When she was seven years old, Birgitta had seen visions of the Virgin Mary. Now she experienced visions of Christ, who inspired her to found a new religious order. King Magnus was persuaded to grant her a royal estate at Vadstena, where she planned to have a monastery for both sexes serving under an abbess. She went to Rome in 1349 to persuade the pope to bless her enterprise and while there founded a Swedish hospice. In 1370 Pope Urban V granted her request, and the new Birgittian Order, a branch of the Augustinian Order but with rules drawn up by Birgitta, was established at Vadstena. In 1372, with her daughter Katarina and son Birger, she went on a pilgrimage to Palestine and Cyprus, and on the return trip she died in Rome in 1373. Nevertheless, the Birgittian Order spread throughout\n\n06-340_02_AtoF.qxd\n\n7/27/06\n\n11:18 AM\n\nPage 17\n\nBLIX, HANS (1928– )\n\n• 17\n\nEurope, at its height counting 80 convents. Birgitta’s body was carried from Rome to Vadstena, where she lies buried. She was canonized in 1391. Her widely circulated Revelationes celestes were collected and published in Latin in eight volumes in 1492 and in Swedish translation in 1857–1880. A strong-willed and courageous figure, Birgitta influenced the church and the political and cultural life of her day. Through her revelations she advised the pope to return from his retreat in Avignon to Rome. She also criticized the morals of King Magnus’s court and the Swedish Church, encouraging Swedish nobles to oppose the king; her son Karl took part in a rebellion against him in 1362. Saint Birgitta’s recorded revelations have an important place in Swedish medieval literature and were retranslated into Swedish in 1958–1959. BIRKA. A Swedish Viking town on Björkö in Lake Mälaren. Birka was Sweden’s first important commercial trading center and had links with the whole of Scandinavia, western Europe (many Frisian merchants visited and perhaps settled there), and Russia. Via the Baltic and Russian routes, its trading links reached the Byzantine Empire and the Arab world. Ansgar, a Christian missionary, visited it twice in the ninth century. Birka was active from c. A.D. 800 to 975, after which it declined and disappeared. The Baltic island of Gotland assumed the Baltic trade, the new settlement at Sigtuna dealt with Scandinavian goods, and Hedeby at the south of the Jutland Peninsula dealt with northern Europe. A large area of archaeological remains, some 3,000 grave mounds, and the vallum, harbor, and fortification have been uncovered, and in 1990 Sweden’s largest official archaeological dig was started on Björkö. A team of 15 experts are gradually revealing the full extent of the Viking town and its harbor. BLIX, HANS (1928– ). Swedish legal adviser on nuclear armaments. Blix studied law at Uppsala, Cambridge, and Stockholm. He became a lecturer at Stockholm University in 1960. Blix served as secretary of state at the Swedish Foreign Office in 1976–1978 and 1979–1981.
