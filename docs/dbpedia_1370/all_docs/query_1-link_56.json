        "text": "Esteemed colleagues/Cat GIF lovers,\n\nThanks to the great 90's Danish Girl Band gods above we are gathered together once more for the 34th edition of PJOPS.\n\nAfter the splendid hosting job from @KamikazeHeart (who literally delayed a Grindr hook-up to post the results - good luck getting the same commitment from me folks!) it's now time for my shoddy attempt at hosting\n\nBasically a competition of obscure songs from the ’90s, ’80s, ’70s, ’60s, ’50s, ’40s or earlier (if you can find a song from 1540 that fits the theme, go ahead and submit it!) If you have a song you’d like us all to hear, now’s the time to do it – everyone who submits a song will vote on the other songs submitted. Here’s a run-down of how it works:\n\n1. PM your entry to me with a link to it on a platform that will allow us all to be able to listen to it (YouTube, Vimeo and Dailymotion are all good starting points).\n\n2. Keep your fingers crossed that the veto panel doesn't reject your entry. If your song is vetoed, return to step 1 and try again.\n\n3. Once the song list is posted, listen to all the songs and decide on your top 10 in order. Award points to these in a Eurovision-style fashion (i.e. 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 points, with 12 points going to your favourite song) and PM me your scores. You only need to send through the top 10. Anything that doesn’t make your top 10 will automatically get a zero.\n\n4. Log in for the reveal and find out whether your song flops or smashes!\n\nWhat kind of songs can I send this time around?\n\nThe usual PJOPS rules apply:\n\nThe song must have been released before 01.01.2000.\n\n2. The song must not be by a huge act that we discuss a lot on the forum (so no Madonna deep cuts, please – although you could get away with a Vanessa Williams deep cut) and it must not be a song that was well-known or a major hit (so please don’t submit the Macarena just because Los Del Rio doesn’t have its own thread). Click here for list of previous entries to give you an idea.\n\nBut in addition, song must also fit this round's devilish theme, and as they say - stick to what you know best:\n\nGood Evening,\n\nBienvenue,\n\nDobryy vecher and\n\nKali Spera!\n\nThat's right you guessed it, this round's theme is EUROPEAN ARTISTS\n\n*\n\n* This is the closest thing I could find to a Cat GIF that also included the EU Flag (as in one doesn't exist)\n\nOnly songs by artists from European Countries are eligible this time around, and for the sake of clarity I'm allowing artists from any country that has ever entered Eurovision (except for Australia), whether or not they enter Eurovision now, or if they're even still a country at all. A handy list is provided in the spoiler:\n\nAlbania\n\nAndorra\n\nArmenia\n\nAustria\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nBelarus\n\nBelgium\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\nBulgaria\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nCzech Republic\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGeorgia\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nIreland\n\nIsrael\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMacedonia\n\nMalta\n\nMoldova\n\nMonaco\n\nMontenegro\n\nMorocco\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nRussia\n\nSan Marino\n\nSerbia\n\nSerbia and Montenegro\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTurkey\n\nUkraine\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nYugoslavia\n\nThe artist you submit does not have to have appeared in Eurovision, just the country they hail from.\n\nIf you can, try to avoid picking the UK, as i think it will be more fun to have a more diverse range of songs, but of course if you're struggling and you're 4 vetos deep I'm not going to throw out a song just because the artist is British.\n\nSo I need from you a PM containing the following:\n\nThe Name of your Artist and Song\n\nA link to be able to listen to it\n\nThe country from which your artist is from - this will help make reveals/results fun - for me at least...\n\nAs ever your Veto Panel will be:\n\n@Baby Clyde\n\n@Eric Generic\n\n@KamikazeHeart\n\nYou have until 23:59 UK Time on Friday 6th October 2017 to submit your offering to me (those caught in Veto Limbo will be allowed extra time to submit should it come to that/you want to still play). This means you have 2.5 Weeks to come up with an entry, and submission closes 1 week after PJ00s finishes - so there really is no excuse ;)\n\nOnce we have all participants I'll let you know about the voting time frame.\n\nAnd to appease, here is a Cat GIF - enjoy...\n\n¡Buena suerte!"
