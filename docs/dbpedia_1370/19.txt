The ninth edition of the Eurovision Song Contest took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, after the duo Grethe & JÃ¸rgen Ingmann won with the song Dansevise the previous year. This was the first time the contest took place in Denmark, and the first time a Nordic country had hosted the contest. The contest was held at Tivolis Koncertsal on Saturday the 21st of March. There was a solo presenter for the contest, and that was Lotte WÃ¦ver.

A total of sixteen nations participated, including Portugal who made their debut at the contest. No nations returned to the contest, however Sweden withdrew. The voting consisted of ten-member juries who each assigned points to their top three songs. The points were totalled, and the top three placed songs within that nationâ€™s jury were then assigned the top three points, which were 5, 3 and 1 point.

Unfortunately, no complete video recording of the contest survived. There is a complete audio recording of the contest in the form of the DR radio broadcast. Some clips still exist, including part of the opening ceremony and opening remarks. Majority of the winnerâ€™s reprise also still exists. Allegedly, the tapes were destroyed in a fire in the 1970â€™s, but more recent interviews with the host broadcaster DR reveal that the broadcast was not recorded in the first place, due to the lack of tape machines at the venue.

Here is the full list of participating countries:

Austria

Belgium

Denmark

Finland

France

Germany

Italy

Luxembourg

Monaco

Netherlands

Norway

Portugal

Spain

Switzerland

United Kingdom

Yugoslavia
