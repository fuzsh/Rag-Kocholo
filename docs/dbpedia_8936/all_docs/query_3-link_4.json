She was the wife of Stanton Abbott, a former middleweight champion of England, but they separated in early 1911. Living in Providence, Rhode Island, Rhoda supported herself and her sons, sixteen-year-old Rossmore and thirteen-year-old Eugene by sewing. She was also a soldier in the Salvation Army.\n\nIn August of 1911 Mrs. Abbott decided to move to England to live with her mother in St. Albanshurst, and she and her sons made the crossing to England on board the Olympic. It wasn’t long, however, before Rossmore and Eugene became homesick for Providence, and Rhoda eventually decided to return to the states for her sons’ benefit. In April 1912 she booked her family’s passage back to America as third class passengers on the Titanic.\n\nSurvived: Rhoda and her two sons jumped from the deck as the Titanic took her final plunge. She managed to get into Collapsible A but her two boys were lost. The boat had been swamped by a wave as it was launched and its occupants balanced precariously in knee-deep water until they were picked up by Collapsible D. Fifth Officer Harold Lowe ensured the survivors were transferred to the intact lifeboat and then drained the water from the bottom of Collapsible D. It drifted away with three bodies still in it, their faces covered by lifebelts.\n\nRhoda’s legs were badly damaged from prolonged exposure to the near-frozen water, and she was bedridden during the voyage to New York aboard the Carpathia. Rhoda’s community at Grace Episcopal Church in Providence supported her until her death in 1946.\n\nback to top\n\nMiss Karen Marie Abelseth, Age 16\n\nMiss Karen Marie Abelseth, was born on September 14, 1895 in Norway. She lived at Ørskog, Ålesund, Norway. Three of her siblings, Anna, Lisa, and Bertha had previously emigrated to the United States. Karen decided to join them and her destination was Los Angeles, California where her sister Anna lived.\n\nKaren was traveling with Olaus Abelseth (who, being a family friend, accompanied her but was no relation), Anna Salkjelsvik, Peter Søholt, Sigurd Hansen Moen and Adolf Humblen. They all set sail from Ålesund to Newcastle via Bergen and boarded the Titanic at Southampton as third class passengers.\n\nSurvived: Karen slept through the collision but was woken up by one of her traveling companions, Adolf Humblen. When she went out in the corridor she became very scared. Another companion, Sigurd Moen, had to hold on to her because she was shaking with fright. Up on deck she was escorted by Olaus, Moen and Søholt to a lifeboat (probably Lifeboat 16). Moen said to her to be brave, all would be well in the end. Then the boat was lowered.\n\nKaren was some time at St. Vincent Hospital before she was able to continue to Minneapolis and Los Angeles.\n\nKaren later married Harry S. Little and had two sons Norman and Francis and three daughters, Phyllis, Wanda and Iris.\n\nKaren died in Inglewood, California on July 27, 1969.\n\nback to top\n\nMrs. Leah Aks, Age 18\n\nMrs. Leah Aks (née Rosen), was born in Warsaw, Poland on March 18, 1894. She was the daughter of Morris Rosen. The family later moved to London, where Leah met Samuel Aks and the two married.\n\nUnable to make a living in London, Samuel emigrated to the United States, settling in Norfolk, Virginia where he worked as a tailor. While Samuel was away, Leah gave birth to the couple’s son, Frank Philip Aks, on June 7, 1911. Frank was known by the nickname Filly.\n\nAfter Samuel had saved enough money for their passage, he sent for Leah and Filly to join him in America. Leah and 10-month-old Filly boarded the Titanic at Southampton as third class passengers.\n\nSurvived: On the night of the sinking Leah found herself with her baby next to Madeleine Astor on the Boat Deck. Mrs. Astor removed her shawl and wrapped it around Leah’s son, Filly. Not long after, Filly was suddenly torn out of her arms and tossed into Lifeboat 11 as crewmen prepared it for lowering. She struggled to retrieve him but was restrained by crewmen who thought she was trying to rush the boat. Leah, still in a state of shock, was pushed into Lifeboat 13. She was reunited with her son on the Carpathia.\n\nLeah was so grateful to the Carpathia for her rescue that, when she had her second child she named her daughter Sarah Carpathia Aks. However, the nuns at the hospital wrote Sarah Titanic Aks on the birth certificate!\n\nLeah Aks died on June 22, 1967 and her son Filly passed away on July 15, 1991.\n\nback to top\n\nMr. William Henry Allen, Age 39\n\nMr. William Henry Allen was born in Nottingham, England in early 1873. He was the son of Alfred Allen, a turner and later a factory foreman, and Hannah Selina Hunt. William was married in 1906 to Florence Ann Rigby and they moved to Erdington, Birmingham where he worked as a toolmaker in the nut and screw trade. The couple had no children.\n\nAfter staying with his parents for a short while in London, William decided to emigrate to the United States in search of work. He planned to stay with his uncle who lived in New York City while he saved enough money to send for Florence to join him.\n\nWilliam boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a third class passenger.\n\nDied: William died in the Titanic disaster and his body was never recovered. His estate worth £167 which administered to his widow on April 5, 1913. Florence Allen never remarried and eventually resettled in Bridgford, Nottinghamshire. She passed away on September 15, 1965.\n\nA suitcase belonging to Mr. Allen was recovered from the wreck in 2000. It contained clothing that bore a laundry stamp “W. Allen.”\n\nback to top\n\nMiss Carla Christine Nielsine Andersen-Jensen, Age 19\n\nMiss Carla Christine Nielsine Anderson-Jensen was born on February 13, 1893. She worked as a maid in Eskildstrup, Denmark where her father, Christian Jensen, was a butcher\n\nCarla received permission from her parents to travel and settle in America. Her father paid for her journey. Her uncle, Niels Peder Jensen, who was a carpenter living in Portland, Oregon, agreed to lead the party that also included Carla’s brother Svend Lauritz Jensen and her fiancé Hans Peder Jensen. They traveled via Esbjerg and London to Southampton where they boarded the Titanic as third class passengers.\n\nSurvived: Carla was placed in one of the last stern boats, probably Lifeboat 16. She later recalled that while she entered a boat the men were making jokes with her saying that she might reach New York faster than the others that way. When the boat was lowered the uncle said “now you can wait there until we come.” Moments after her lifeboat departed, the Titanic broke in two and sank. Carla’s uncle, brother and fiance did not survive.\n\nIn New York Carla was quartered in a hospital and sewed to occupy herelf. Her father sent for her and White Star gave her a second class ticket on Adriatic to Liverpool. She was back at Eskildstrup on May 13 and never traveled out of Denmark again.\n\nCarla married Frederik Petersen, a farmer from Oremark, in 1915. They raised three children. She died on March 14, 1980 and was by her own request was buried in the nightdress she had worn on April 14, 1912.\n\nback to top\n\nMr. August Edvard Andersson, Age 27\n\nMr. August Edvard Andersson was born on April 24, 1884. He was the son of Knut Andersson and Elna Månsdotter. He was a journalist, typographer and socialist activist living in Malmö, Sweden.\n\nHis socialist activities included the publication, in 1905, of Gula Faran (The Yellow Danger) and thereafter he was known under that nickname. The paper, which described King Oscar II as “King of Thieves,” was not appreciated by the authorities. Confiscation and charges followed. August was acquitted but he decided to emigrate in 1912. He bought himself a ticket in Copenhagen, and to conceal his identity, he assumed the last name of his friend, Ivar Vennerström (changing the V to a W).\n\nHe boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a third class passenger.\n\nSurvived: As the Titanic went down August met Alma Pålsson and her children. He tried to hold on to two of the children, but lost them when they came into the water. He also found Edvard and Elin Lindell of Helsingborg, Sweden, who were part of the surge of steerage passengers who appeared on the Boat Deck in the ship’s final moments. As the ship sank the group struggled up the sloping deck until it was too steep and, clasping hands, they slid back down close to Collapsible A. August recounted that even though he was quite close to the ship, he detected no suction as it descended.\n\nOnce the ship went under August climbed into the lifeboat. He saw Mrs. Lindell in the water and grabbed her hand. Weakened by the cold he was unable to assist her further and after a while she drifted away. Fearfully, the young man glanced over at the woman’s husband but he was already dead.\n\nIn New York he was quartered at Salvation Army’s cadet school and he created a minor scandal when he accused the Lutheran immigrant home of embezzlement. He received $25 and a train ticket from the Salvation Army committee and $100 from the Red Cross. At the Salvation Army in Chicago he met and married Namoi Johnson. They moved to Culver, Indiana, where August found work as a gardener and had seven children.\n\nAugust died on November 22, 1950 and is buried in Culver, Indiana.\n\nback to top\n\nMiss Helene Barbara Baclini, Age 9 months\n\nMiss Helene Barbara Baclini was born July 12, 1911.

They were not originally scheduled to travel on the Titanic but Helene’s sister Maria developed conjunctivitis (pink eye) and they had to abandon their original plans.\n\nThe Titanic was the first available ship when Maria was better and they were ready to resume their journey. Latifa booked passage in third class and the family boarded at Cherbourg. Traveling with them was Miss Adele Jane Kiamie Najib who was going to the United States to be married. Helene’s mother was serving as Adele’s chaperone since she was only in her teens.\n\nSurvived: When the collision occured Helene’s mother, Latifa, knew something was wrong and somehow made her way with her Helene and sisters Euginie and Maria and Miss Najib, the woman Latifa was chaporoning to the boat deck. Supposedly, when they were boarding Collapsible C, the officer loading the boat would not let Miss Najib on because she was not a “blood relative” of Latifa. However, Latifa insisted that she could not arrive in America having saved herself and her daughters and tell Miss Najib’s family that she had to leave her behind. They finally let Miss Najib on the boat. This conversation had to have taken place in either French or Arabic since neither Latifa nor any of the others spoke English.\n\nHelene Barbara Baclini grew up and married Albert Mueller. She died April 28, 1939 of breast cancer in New York City.\n\nback to top\n\nMr. Karl Ivar Sven Berglund, Age 22\n\nMr. Karl Ivar Sven Berglund was born on January 24, 1890. He was the son of bricklayer Karl August Berglund and Emma Rydberg. Karl was unmarried and worked as a casual laborer in Tranvik, Finland.\n\nKarl had been persuaded to travel to the United States by Alfred Rindell, a building worker who had visited him back in 1911. Alfred told Karl he could get work in the United States and later sent him cash for a ticket. Karl traveled to Stockholm, Sweden where he bought a ticket for an American Line ship. In Southampton he realized he could go on the maiden voyage of the Titanic instead, so he changed plans and bought a third class ticket. From Southampton he sent a card to his parents with the ship’s picture on it.\n\nDied: Karl died in the sinking. The card he sent his parents and news of the disaster arrived at the same time. However, it was only after some weeks that Karl’s parents received definitive word of their son’s fate .\n\nHis body was never found and his family subsequently received £75 in compensation.\n\nback to top\n\nMiss Mary Bourke, Age 40\n\nMiss Mary Bourke was born in Carrowskeheen, Ireland on June 11, 1871.

She joined a large group of people from her locality, called the Addergoole Fourteen, who were all traveling third class aboard Titanic. Mary boarded at Queenstown.\n\nDied: On the night of the sinking Mary, her brother, John and sister-in-law Catherine were all reportedly asleep at the time of the collision. They were awakened by a steward who told them to get up and dressed. The three of them (perhaps with the others whom they were traveling with) all made the upper decks. Mary and Catherine had ample opportunity to escape, but they declined to be parted from John under the women and children first edict. The three of them were lost in the sinking.\n\nThe Addergoole Fourteen was the highest proportional death toll of any place in the British Isles.\n\nback to top\n\nMr. David John Bowen, Age 20\n\nMr. David John Bowen was born in Treherbert, Wales on July 30, 1891.

He boarded at Queenstown, leading a group of friends that consisted of Hannah Riordan, Bridget Bradley, Patrick Denis O’Connell, Patrick O’Connor, Nora O’Leary and Michael Linehan. All were third class passengers.\n\nSurvived: Daniel made his way up to the open decks but when he neared the steps to the first class area he found himself surrounded by other steerage passengers blocked by a crew member who refused them access. They smashed the lock and the passengers forced their way through.\n\nDaniel and some other male passengers leapt into Lifeboat 13. Many of the men were dragged out but a woman (who he mistakenly thought was Mrs. John Jacob Astor) covered him in a ladies shawl and disguised him as a woman. He was still aboard when the lifeboat was lowered into the water.\n\nDaniel settled in Manhattan and worked in a hotel. He joined the army and died in 1918 while serving in World War I.\n\nback to top\n\nMr. Jeremiah Burke, Age 19\n\nMr. Jeremiah Burke as born in Glanmire, Ireland over the summer months of 1893.

Queenstown\n\nThe bottle was brought to the local police station and later passed on to the Burke family. According to Brid O’Flynn, Jeremiah’s grand-niece, his mother had filled a little bottle with holy water and given him for good luck as he left the family house. Miss O’Flynn said, “This is unmistakably the bottle that had left thirteen months previously and unmistakably her son’s handwriting.”\n\nback to top\n\nMr. Patrick Canavan, Age 21\n\nMr. Patrick Canavan, known as Pat, was born in Knockmaria, Ireland on September 12, 1890. He was one of seven children born to Anthony Canavan (1848-1933), a farmer, and Bridget Kelly (1858-1946).\n\nPat’s older brother Thomas and sister Kate had emigrated to the United States and Pat intended to join them.

Carl was eventually picked up by a lifeboat, but Gerda died in the sinking and her body was not recovered.\n\nThe Mansion House Fund paid 875:52 Kr to her parents, and a claim for damages of 911 Kr was also later paid on June 30, 1914.\n\nGerda’s parents remained living in Stockholm. Her mother died in 1928 and her father in 1931. Her sister Signe continued to live in Chicago and was married in the 1920s to Martin Johnson, a fellow-Swede.

She was the daughter of German immigrant John Finkenagel (b. 1837) and an English mother, Elizabeth Phillips (b. 1841). The family ran a boarding house in England and later emigrated to Cleveland, Ohio, although Mary remained in England.\n\nMary married Thomas Henry Davison (b. 1880), a blacksmith and native of Chippenham, England, in Malmesbury in 1902. The couple lived in Chippenham and had two children that were both lost in early infancy.\n\nMary and Thomas had spent time in Cleveland with Mary’s parents and decided to emigrate to Bedford, Ohio to be near family. They boarded the Titanic at Southampton as third class passengers.\n\nSurvived: Mary was rescued, possibly in Lifeboat 16, but her husband, Thomas, was lost.\n\nMary never returned to England and she remarried on July 29, 1913 in Warrensville, Ohio to Fred Buescher. The couple later divorced and Mary married again on September 6, 1917 to Henry Godwin, who was also from Malmesbury and who had emigrated in 1910. The couple settled in Cleveland.\n\nMary died of cancer on March 26, 1939. She is buried in Bedford Cemetery, Bedford, Ohio with her husband Henry Godwin.

She was the daughter of Bertram Frank Dean (b. 1886) and Georgette Eva Light Dean (b. 1879). In April 1912 she was only nine-weeks-old when her family decided to emigrate to the United States. Her father’s cousin owned a tobacco shop in Wichita, Kansas and Bertram was set to be the co-owner.\n\nThe family was meant to travel on another ship, but due to the coal strikes in Britain, were transferred to the Titanic. Millvina, with her parents and older brother Bertram (b. 1910), boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a third class passenger. While on the ship, Millvina’s mother wrote a postcard to her parents saying: “Dear Mother, Just a card to say we are enjoying ourselves fine up to now. Little baby was very restless. With best love, Ettie.”\n\nSurvived: Millvina, her mother and brother were all rescued. They returned to England aboard the Adriatic. It was on the Adriatic that Millvina became quite a spectacle, people were amazed that such a tiny baby could have came through the ordeal alive. First and Second Class passengers on the Adriatic lined up to hold her, and many took photographs of her, her mother and brother, several of which were published in contemporary newspapers.\n\nIn her younger years Millvina did not know that she was on the Titanic, and only found out when she was eight and her mother was planning to remarry. Millvina never married, working for the government during World War II by drawing maps, and later serving in the purchasing department of a Southampton engineering firm.\n\nMillvina was both the youngest survivor as well as the last living survivor. She lived in retirement in Southampton, England and kept very busy attending conventions; appearing in documentaries, TV series and radio shows; signing huge amounts of autographs; and relating her tales to school groups. She died on May 31, 2009.\n\nback to top\n\nMr. Guillaume Joseph DeMessemaeker, Age 36\n\nMr. Guillaume Joseph DeMessemaeker (Bill) was born on December, 31, 1875 in Wilsele, Belgium.\n\nHe and his brothers, Emmanuel and Jacques, decided to emigrate to the United States in 1901. They were lured to Montana by tales of unclaimed farm and ranch land. Bill and his brothers homesteaded land between Tampico and Vandalia, near the Milk River. After clearing many acres of land for farming and building a log cabin on his land, Bill decided to return to Belgium to visit family and to marry. He returned in 1911 and married his wife Anna in early 1912.\n\nBill was bringing his new wife to his home in the United States when they boarded the Titanic as third class passengers.\n\nSurvived: On the night of the sinking, Bill and Anna managed to get on the boat deck following the collision. Bill’s comprehension of the English language undoubtedly enabled him and his wife to adhear to the regulations and orders – a hindrance to his fellow countrymen. When ordered into the lifeboat, Anna became hysterical and would not leave her husband’s side. Bill forcibly picked her up and handed her to an officer in Lifeboat 13. At that time, the officers asked for experienced crew to man Lifeboat 15 and Bill jumped into the crowded boat and helped to row for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe couple was later reunited on the Carpathia. After their rescue, they headed westward. However, Anna passed away in 1918, supposively having never recovered from the disaster.\n\nBill returned to Belgium where he met and married Marie Van Hamme (b. 1896). The couple were married in Paris in 1920 and soon after moved back to Montana. They became the parents of four children and had a large successful ranch. After raising their family, Bill and Marie sold their ranch and bought a small home in Glasgow, Montana. Bill died on June 5, 1955.

By this point Virginia’s mother was traveling as the opera singer Estelle Emanuel.\n\nVirginia lived in New York City with her grandparents and father, but had been on a visit to her mother, who was on a six month singing contract in England.\n\nVirginia boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a third class passenger with her nurse, Miss Elizabeth Dowdell, who was escorting her home. Virginia’s ticket stated her last name as Emanuel, but in other documents she is listed with her father’s last name of Marten. Virginia and Elizabeth shared a third class cabin with Amy Stanley.\n\nSurvived: Virginia and her nurse Elizabeth Dowdell were rescued in Lifeboat 13.\n\nVirginia returned to her grandparents and her mother, Estelle, sailed back to New York in August 1912. Estelle married a third time to Harold Binney, who was said to be devoted to Virginia.

Other family members believed that he left Lithuania to avoid compulsive service in the Russian Army. He would have been forced to serve twelve years.\n\nEliezer boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a third class passenger to move to Chicago, Illinois. Unable to afford a normal ticket, Eliezer was contracted as a reserve engineer in exchange for cheaper passage. He carried a primer on the English language with him.\n\nDied: Eliezer was lost in the sinking. His body was recovered by the Mackay-Bennett.

She lived and worked in Manhattan and soon sent for Kate to join her.\n\nKate joined the Titanic at Queenstown on April 11, 1912 as a third class passenger. While aboard she roomed in cabin 161 on E-deck aft with three other women from her area, Katie Mullin and the Murphy sisters, Margaret and Kate. She also became acquainted with fellow Longford passengers James Farrell, Thomas McCormack and the Kiernan brothers, John and Phillip.\n\nSurvived: When Kate headed out to the upper decks she found her way to the lifeboats impeded by crewmen blocking their way. When trying to pass through one barrier a crewman stopped her but James Farrell threatened the offending crewman with a punch if he didn’t let the women through. His intervention perhaps saved her life. Kate later referred to James as her guardian angel. Kate eventually managed to get to a higher deck with the lifeboats, but she couldn’t find her way any further. A man offered her a lift up on his shoulders, and she climbed over the railing to the boat deck. Spying a boat close by she made for it but a crewman again held her back, telling her it was full. Crying out that her sister was in the boat, the crewman relented and let her pass. In years later, Kate recounted that the magnitude of the disaster unfolding at the time escaped her and she naïvely thought that this was the regular way to make it to America.\n\nKate eventually arrived in the United States and was reunited with her sister Mollie. To reassure her family back home that she was safe, Kate and Mollie had a portrait taken and posted to Ireland.\n\nKate soon met her future husband, John Joseph Manning (b. 1893) who worked as a chauffeur. The two had three children and lived in Queens, New York until John’s death in 1955.\n\nIn later life Kate became a member of the “Titanic Enthusiasts of America,” later the Titanic Historical Society, and she appeared on two television programs, To Tell The Truth and the Steve Allen Show and also recalled her experiences to Walter Lord when he was writing A Night to Remember.

She was traveling to Washington, DC where she had a cousin, Mrs. D. Courtney, who lived at 715 North Capitol Street. While aboard she shared a cabin with three other women from her area, Mary McGovern, Julia Smyth and Kate Connolly.\n\nSurvived: On the night of the sinking Mary related that she and her cabin mates, Mary, Julia and Kate, felt the sensation of the ship striking something. Inquiring from passing crewmen as to if they were in any danger, they were reportedly ridiculed for their anxiety and told to go back to their bunks. Shortly after however they were told otherwise they left their cabin and went into the communal third class areas. In terror, she and her friends knelt in prayer but a man she identified as Martin Gallagher, found them and led them into a second class area of the ship. She and the other three girls from her cabin were rescued in Lifeboat 13. Mary described the perilous moment that the lifeboat, unable to release itself from the falls once lowered, was threatened with being crushed by Lifeboat 15 which was lowering rapidly overhead.\n\nMary eventually reached America aboard the rescue ship Carpathia and spent time in the hospital to recuperate. She also received modest monetary assistance from the American Red Cross before she continued her journey to Washington where she remained.\n\nMary soon met her future husband, Patrick Joseph O’Donoghue (b. 1887), a streetcar conductor from Ireland who had emigrated in 1907. The couple were married in Washington, DC on October 18, 1917 and made their home there where her husband later managed a restaurant.\n\nMary died while visiting her daughter in St. Petersburg, Florida on February 26, 1955.

Frankie and his parents boarded the Titanic at Southampton as third class passengers.\n\nSurvived: Frank and his mother Emily were rescued, probably in Collapsible D. However, his father, Frank, perished.\n\nFrank and Emily settled in Detroit, where he grew up near to Tiger Stadium. When the Tigers played, the roar of the crowds reminded him of the sound of the Titanic sinking; consequently, he never took his children to baseball games.\n\nAs a young man Frank worked as a milk cart driver, a job he held for many years. He served as a civilian employee of the U.S. Air Force photographic division during World War II.\n\nFrank married a woman named Victoria in 1926 and they had three sons.

She was engaged to another Finnish-American, Pekka Peitari Hakkarainen (b. 1884) a steelworker from Monessen, Pennsylvania, and they were wed in Finland on January 15, 1912. The stay in Finland was brief to avoid Pekka being conscripted into the Russian Army.\n\nInitially planning to return to the United States aboard Mauretania, they changed their minds and boarded the Titanic at Southampton as third class passengers.\n\nSurvived: On the night of the sinking Elin and her husband Pekka were in their cabin sleeping but were woken by the collision which Elin described as a strong vibration and a scratching noise. Pekka got up to investigate while Elin returned to bed, soon falling asleep again. When she awoke again sometime later Pekka had still not returned and some onboard acquaintances arrived at the cabin to rouse her. She did not have time to dress properly and grabbed a handbag and life preserver and hurried into the corridor. All the stairway gates appeared to be locked, but, at last, she noticed a steward coming to collect a group of steerage passengers, guiding them to the boat deck.\n\nElin looked for her husband on deck but an officer came up and told her that there was space for one more woman in Lifeboat 15. The boat was already on its way down and she almost fell between the ship between lifeboat and the ship side, before someone grabbed her in her hand and pulled her into the boat.\n\nElin never saw Pekka again and his body was never found. She continued to New York aboard Carpathia and later received £50 in compensation.\n\nFor a time Elin lived in West Virginia and was remarried there on April 10, 1917 to Emil Nummi (b. 1891), also a native of Finland. The couple’s only child, a son named Gerald Emil, was born on October 20, 1920.

His brother Simon had lived in Michigan (reportedly Port Huron) since 1906 and his sister, Rose had emigrated in 1911 and lived in Pennsylvania.\n\nMubārik boarded the Titanic at Cherbourg as a third class passenger and was traveling with a large group from Hardin, including several cousins.\n\nSurvived: On the night of the sinking Mubārik was asleep in his cabin and seemingly slept through the impact. A cousin woke him, telling him that the ship had shuddered and was now sinking. Hurriedly dressing and stuffing his bare feet into shoes, Mubārik left his few possessions and what money he had and hastened from his cabin. Knowing very little English, he managed to scale his way to the upper decks, noting that the sea was calm and the air very cool.\n\nAccounts of how Mubārik survived vary. One account states that he stepped into a lifeboat that was almost already full, seemingly without much opposition. Another account from an interview he gave had a much more dramatic exit where he took a baby from a woman and helped board her and the child on a lifeboat. He then jumped 30 feet into the boat where landed on the head of a woman.\n\nIn New York he was reportedly met by a brother who had traveled from Port Huron to meet him. Following treatment in St. Vincent’s Hospital he would travel to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania with Thamīn Tannūs and her son As’ad where he would spend time with friends and relatives before heading to Michigan.\n\nHe was married in Croswell, Michigan on September 9, 1912 to Elizabeth Āsī (b. 1891), also a Lebanese migrant. The couple had no children. In America they were members of St. Stephen’s Catholic Church and Mubārik Anglicised his name to Bert Johns.\n\nBert worked for several years in industrial plants before he and his wife operated a fruit store in Marlette, Michigan. For 15 years he operated a public house, Bert’s Tavern, in Port Huron.\n\nBert died in Port Huron on February 2, 1952. His widow, Lizzie, later died in February 1970 and they are buried together in Mt. Hope Cemetery in Port Huron.\n\nback to top\n\nMrs. Jennie Louise Hansen, Age 45\n\nMrs. Jennie Louise Hansen (née Howard) was born on December 20, 1866 in Racine, Wisconsin. She was the daughter of William J. Howard and Edith Dawson.\n\nJennie had previously escaped death when she was a pastry cook in the Blake Opera House and Hotel. When the building caught fire in 1884 she made the last trip down the elevator before flames gutted the shaft of the hotel.\n\nJennie married Claus Peter Hansen on July 25, 1900 in Racine. The couple had no children. In 1912, Peter (as Claus was known) and Jennie traveled to Denmark to visit Peter’s parents and brothers. When they returned to America, Peter´s twenty-six-year-old brother Henrik Juul Hansen decided to leave Denmark and accompany them to the United States. The three boarded the Titanic in Southampton as third class passengers.\n\nSurvived: After the collision, Jennie’s husband, Peter, put her into a lifeboat. Peter and his brother Henrik both perished in the sinking. Jennie later claimed that the lifeboat was so crowded that a sailor had to sit on her lap while he was rowing.\n\nJennie was briefly hospitalized in New York after the Carpathia landed. She also suffered from severe nightmares and went to stay with her elder brother Thomas Howard and his wife Maggie in Racine.\n\nJennie later married Elmer Emerson (who was 19 years her junior) on August 25, 1915. Jennie died on December 15, 1952.\n\nback to top\n\nMr. Harry Hart, Age 29\n\nMr. Henry Hart was born in Drumiskabbole, Ireland in 1883. He was one of seven children born to Michael Hart (b. 1843), a farmer, and Mary Cunningham (b. 1841).\n\nAt some point Henry emigrated to the United States, where he was married in Belmont, Massachusetts on July 30, 1911 to another Irish-American, Bridget Delia McGillicuddy (b. 1883). Delia and Henry reportedly worked together for a sugar company owned by E. F. Atkins in Belmont. The couple returned to Ireland on August 10, 1911. Henry at the time was a cook. They settled in Kerry where Delia still had family.\n\nOriginally scheduled to travel aboard the Celtic, Hart instead boarded the Titanic at Queenstown as a third class passenger. He was headed to Marion, Massachusetts where he had a relative, John Hart.\n\nDied: Henry died in the sinking and his body, if recovered, was never identified.\n\nHis widow Delia had been pregnant at the time of the sinking and later gave birth to a son whom she named after his late father. Mother and son are believed to have spent the remainder of their lives in Ireland, but what became of them is not certain.\n\nback to top\n\nMiss Honor Healy, Age 33\n\nMiss Honor Healy, also known as Nora, was born in Greethill, Ireland on April 9, 1879. Born into a Roman Catholic family, she was the daughter of Thomas Healy (b. 1841), a farmer, and Mary Martin (b. 1841). She lived with her mother, her father having passed away in years prior, and worked as a farmer. She was unmarried.\n\nHonor was traveling to Manhattan, New York where she had several family members, including an aunt. She boarded the Titanic at Queenstown on April 11, 1912 as a third class passenger.\n\nSurvived: On the night of the sinking, Honor was rescued in Lifeboat 16.\n\nHowever, her experiences on the Titanic pushed Honor over the edge. Speculated to be slightly mentally fragile already, she had a breakdown upon her arrival in New York and shortly returned to her family in Ireland. A few years later she was committed to Ballinasloe Asylum where she spent the rest of her life. She eventually died from a stroke on March 11, 1919.\n\nback to top\n\nMr Oskar Arvid Hedman, Age 27\n\nMr. Oskar Hedman was born in Umca, Sweden on July 5, 1884. He was the son of Gustav Hedman and had three brothers and two sisters. In 1905 he emigrated to the United States and settled in Beach, North Dakota.\n\nIn 1911, Oskar was living in Bowman, North Dakota where he was employed at the Carter Hotel as well as running automobiles for the Western Land Securities company, Obert A. Olson and others. In 1912 he was employed by the Land firm J.P. Rodgers & Co., in St. Paul Minnesota. He worked as a settler recruiter, someone sent by an American state to recruit migrant workers to work in the United States.\n\nOskar was returning from work abroad and boarded the Titanic at Southampton leading a group of seventeen migrant workers, few of whom could speak English.\n\nSurvived: Oskar threw himself into a lifeboat at the last second. He told later that he had thought to himself that he should at least jump because: “If they are going to shoot me I’ll just die faster.” It is not clear what lifeboat it was but it was probably 15. Contemporary newspaper reports give sharply conflicting accounts of his escape.\n\nOn November 7, 1912 Oskar married Julia Mathilda ““Tillie”“ Anderson. The couple had no children. Sometime during his residence in North Dakota Oscar began to train as an osteopath or chiropractor. It is unclear whether he ever completed his training but he practiced for many years, albeit in an unlicenced capacity, and was known to locals as “Doc.” However, because he never officially registered he and his wife had to move from town to town to avoid citation for practicing without a licence. In 1920 or 1925 Oskar settled in Onida, South Dakota, where he practiced for almost 40 years.\n\nOscar died in Onida, South Dakota July 28, 1961.\n\nback to top\n\nMr. Ling Hee, Age 24\n\nMr. Ling Hee was from Hong Kong. He was unmarried. As an Asian, even though he traveled with a British passport, he would have experienced a lot of racism in Europe.\n\nLing was traveling to New York City with eight Chinese colleagues. They were all bound for the steamship Annetta. Ling and the others were sailors out of work due to the coal strike in Britain. While it has been alleged that some or all the Chinese colleagues were stowaways on the Titanic, in fact all eight boarded the Titanic at Southampton as fare-paying third class passengers. In addition to Ling, they were Lee Bing, Chang Chip, Choong Foo, Ali Lam, Len Lam, Fang Lang and Lee Ling. They traveled together on the same ticket. While aboard the Titanic, the men would have been shunned and not able to socialize with the other third class passengers.\n\nSurvived: As a sailor, Ling understood the workings of the ship and made his way to Collapsible C. He was able to hide under the seats until after the boat was lowered. Out of the eight Chinese passengers, six survived the sinking.\n\nOnce Ling made it to New York, he was detained and placed under guard by United States Immigration officers and immediately escorted to the Annetta which sailed the following day to Cuba.\n\nback to top\n\nMiss Hilda Maria Hellström, Age 22\n\nMiss Hilda Maria Hellström was born December 7, 1889, the daughter of August Hellström and Carolina Hellström (née Johnson). She had two brothers and two sisters. Until 1912 Hilda lived in Stora Tuna, Sweden with her parents.\n\nHilda had been planning her journey to America for a long time, but had to postpone it when her mother became ill and she had to keep house for her father. When her mother died, in March 1912, a sister took care of her father and Hilda could finally go. She was initially meant to travel on the Adriatic but was transferred on account of a massive coal strike in Britain at the time. She boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a third class passenger. Her destination was the home of her widowed aunt Johanna Erikson in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nSurvived: Hilda had not yet got into bed when she heard the collision, she went on deck but could see no disturbance so returned to her room. When she was back in her cabin she felt uneasy and decided to go back up on deck. Someone grabbed her and guided her to a lifeboat. Hilda was able to get into one of the last boats (probably) Collapsible C with fellow Swede Velin Öhman. Hilda recalled that Velin produced a bottle of brandy and the two women shared it to calm their shattered nerves.\n\nIn a letter home she wrote about the arrival to New York on the Carpathia that she was “broke, pale and skinny, we were stowed in like pigs on Carpathia.” In New York she was brought to the Lutheran Emigrant Home. The Womens Relief Committee in New York gave her $25.\n\nAfter surviving the sinking she had such a terror of water that she never again traveled to Sweden or saw her Swedish relatives. Hilda married John Edward Larson on December 7, 1915, in Waukegan. They had a daughter, Ellen. The family lived in Chicago.\n\nHilda died at her daughter’s home on March 16, 1962.\n\nback to top\n\nMr. John Fredrik Alexander Holm, Age 43\n\nMr. John Fredrik Alexander Holm was born on February 20, 1869. He was the son of Elsa Nilsson who lived in Stockholm. From the age of two months John was looked after by Charlotta Johansson and regarded her and her husband as his parents.\n\nJohn’s adopted father died in 1912 and the 68-year-old Charlotta became dependent upon John’s income. He worked as a ship’s skipper in New York, but he planned to move back to Sweden and settle down with his fiancée Emmy Tanngren. However, he decided to continue working for a while for a yacht club, C. C. Ulmers Park, and look for a new job later.\n\nJohn traveled to Southampton via Denmark with Adelia Landergren and Mauritz Ådahl. He boarded the Titanic as a third class passenger.\n\nDied: After the collision John and Mauritz helped Adelia Landergren into Lifeboat 13, but did not enter themselves. John died in the sinking and his body, if recovered, was never identified.\n\nAfter his death the Swedish consulate tried to investigate his wealth and found all bank accounts had been emptied before his trip to Sweden in 1911. When consulate personnel entered his apartment they found very little furniture, just some dirty clothes and unsellable junk with the net result of minus $4.90 for the consulate for moving the things to the Public Administrator. His fiance, Emmy, never moved to the apartment she and John had prepared in Sweden and the furniture was sold at auction. Emmy never married and continued living with her parents.\n\nback to top\n\nMiss May Elizabeth Howard, Age 26\n\nMiss May Elizabeth Howard was born in North Walsham, England on May 2, 1885. She was the daughter of William Howard (b. 1845), an agricultural laborer, and Martha Whall (b. 1849) who had married in 1867.\n\nMay boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a third class passenger. She intended to visit with her brother in Toronto, Ontario before joining her married sister Jane Hewitt. Jane had emigrated in 1908 and lived in Albion, New York where she worked as a nanny. Mary had reportedly been booked on another ship but switched to Titanic because of a massive coal strike in Britain. On board the ship she shared a cabin with Mrs. Emily Goldsmith and Emily’s son Frank and was seasick during the voyage.\n\nSurvived: On the night of the sinking May had been in her cabin at the time of the collision but was still fully dressed. She described the impact as not violent enough to upset them but felt the ship rock and was further alarmed by the sound of ringing bells coming from down below. Leaving her bunk to see what had happened she encountered many other bewildered and half-dressed passengers who had left their cabins with similar curiosity. Crewmen initially instructed the crowd to go back to bed before a “doctor” came and told them all was well but to get their lifebelts.\n\nMay escaped the sinking, leaving with her cabinmate, Mrs. Goldsmith, and Mrs. Goldsmith’s son, Frank, in Collapsible C.\n\nMay became a nanny for the Kenyon family in New York where she would help raise their five children. Following service with the Kenyons she later worked for their daughter Margaret. May, who was never married, is remembered by the Kenyon family as a very sweet lady who was wonderful with children but who was quiet and reserved and ever fearful of water and, while it was common knowledge in the family that she had survived the Titanic, it was never a topic brought up to her as she did not like to discuss it.\n\nMay died in the Rochester State Hospital on November 28, 1958 and was buried in New York in the Kenyon family plot.\n\nback to top\n\nMr. Abraham Joseph Hyman, Age 34\n\nMr. Abraham Joseph Hyman was born in the Russian Empire in 1878.

Abraham worked as a storekeeper and later as a picture frame maker.\n\nAbraham boarded the Titanic in Southampton as a third class passenger on April 10 1912. He was traveling alone to Springfield, Massachusetts where he had a brother, Harry.\n\nSurvived: Abraham escaped in Collapsible C:\n\nReaching America aboard Carpathia Abraham was met by his brother. His wife refused to cross the Atlantic to join him and Abraham also had reservations about making the crossing again. However his time spent in New York inspired Abraham pursue an enterprise back in England.\n\nHe eventually returned to Manchester where he opened a Kosher deli and grocery store, J. A. Hyman Ltd on Waterloo Road. Locals referred to Abraham as the “Titanic Man” and the store became known as Titanics. The store is still in operation today and still within the Hyman family.\n\nHe and his wife had a further two children, but Esther died on September 14, 1927.

Her parents died when she was young, and Sāfiyah went to live with her married sister. She married Wassūf Ibraham Halut (b. 1887), also a native of her village, and the couple had a daughter named Zakiyah, on August 9, 1908.\n\nThe couple decided to emigrate to Pennsylvania. Safiyah and Wassūf left their daughter in the care of family and continued onward to the United States. Safiyah was refused entry at Ellis Island due to a contagious eye infection and was ordered to return to Syria. She made two more attempts to enter the United States.\n\nOn her third attempt, Sāfiyah left Syria and traveled from Beirut to Marseille then on to Cherbourg where she boarded the Titanic as a third class passenger.\n\nSurvived: Sāfiyah was in bed during the iceberg collision, and she left her cabin and joined scores of other confused steerage passengers who were wandering around the public areas waiting for instructions from the crew. She gave several newspaper interviews after the sinking with conflicting and occasionally embellished stories of her last moments on the ship. What is know is that she did make her way to the upper decks and was rescued in Collapsible C.\n\nUpon arrival in New York Sāfiyah was taken to St. Vincent’s Hospital for recuperation and given monetary assistance and travel allowance to complete her journey to her husband in Greensburg. Her husband Wassūf had reportedly been unaware that she was on Titanic.\n\nWassūf and Sāfiyah Ibrāhīm anglicized their names to Joseph and Sophie Abraham and on October 4, 1913 they welcomed a son, Zackie Halaut.

He bought tickets and legal papers in Copenhagen and was accompanied by fellow Socialist and Swede August Wennerström. They remained together on the Titanic which they boarded at Southampton. Carl boarded as a third class passenger and August as a second class.\n\nSurvived: Carl was woken by the collision and hurried up to deck. He was in such hurry that he had forgotten to put an any shoes. Up on deck he saw nothing and first he thought he would see the iceberg that somebody had mentioned to him but it was too late. So he went back down to put on some proper clothing. Carl’s cabin was one of those that was fast being filled with water.\n\nCarl remained on the ship until the end and then swam to the water filled Collapsible A.\n\nIn New York he was brought to the Salvation Army’s Cadet School and was given $25 from the Salvation Army assistance committee. He initially settled in Swedeburg, Nebraska and then in Wahoo. He continued to work as carpenter, and he never returned to Sweden. He was married Edith Syverson on May 3, 1923.

Richard was a leather worker and former farmer from a neighboring townland, Gortnagrough. The entire Jermyn family was making plans to settle in Massachusetts and Annie would cross the Atlantic first, destined for her sister Mary’s home.\n\nAnnie boarded the Titanic at Queenstown as a third class passenger. While aboard she shared a cabin with another woman from her town, Bridget Driscoll, and Mary Kelly.\n\nSurvived: On the night of the sinking Annie and her two cabin mates, Bridget and Mary, managed to secure places in the last lifeboat to be successfully launched from the ship, Collapsible D. Annie later reported many third class passengers were trapped in their quarters, not even managing to reach the upper decks, and she stated that large numbers of people “beat madly against the locked gates.” Annie stated that she managed to mount one such gate before rushing over to a flight of stairs that took her to the Boat Deck. Upon her entry into her lifeboat she apparently stumbled and injured her stomach. While Annie was collecting herself from her hasty and painful entry into the lifeboat she received a hefty blow on her back, as if she had been kicked. Startled and turning to see what had happened, she saw a man directly over her. Seeing an officer wielding a revolver at the stern of the lifeboat, a gunshot and a flash soon ensued, and the man who had unceremoniously slammed into her uttered a feeble cry before falling overboard.\n\nUpon arriving in New York Annie was treated in St. Vincent’s Hospital, suffering from exposure and injuries to her stomach. She later joined her sister Mary, where she was reported to be in a state of nervous shock.\n\nNot long after the disaster Annie’s parents and remaining siblings joined her in the United States and arrived in Boston in August 1912. The entire family settled in Massachusetts and Annie lived with them for a time.\n\nIt is reported that Annie later became involved with a man of who did not meet the approval of her family.

Bernt then traveled to America, working on different boats without great success and in 1910 he returned to Haugesund. On January 28, 1911 he married Ahna Karoline Hansdatter.\n\nIn 1912 Bernt sustained an industrial injury and was advised by his physician to find lighter work in America. He found a job in New York. Bernt was originally scheduled on the DFD Line’s Hellig Olav, but a lack of space forced him to book passage on the Titanic, which he boarded at Southampton as a third class passenger.\n\nSurvived: Bernt was rescued in Lifeboat 13. He claimed, First Officer Murdoch gave him permission to slide down the falls to the lifeboat.\n\nBernt was initially reported lost in an article in Haugesunds Avis April 25, 1912. However, in New York, while resting at St. Vincent’s hospital, Bernt alerted his wife of his safety by letter. Bernt returned home after having stayed three months in New York. His wife Ahna Karoline would not let her husband work on boats any more. Bernt eventually got work as a stonemason. The couple would later have eight children.\n\nIn 1920 Bernt got a job as a postman in his home village. For that purpose he used a bicycle. He was faithful to his duties, even once there was a flood, and had to get help from two ladies to carry him on a string above the flooded area. In 1952, when Bernt was 70 years old, and he retired from his postal duties.

He had no family in the United States, but knew a few people, including Emil Andersson, whom he was meeting in North Dakota. He got his ticket from acquaintances in North Dakota (an illegal but not unusual practice).

His intention was to work in the steel mills and save enough money for his wife to join him. He boarded the Titanic at Southampton on April 10, 1912 as a third class passenger and most likely shared a cabin with other Finnish men.\n\nSurvived: On the night of the sinking Eirikk was awakened by the collision but did not get up at once. He rose only after his cabin mate Juha Niskänen entered his cabin and warned him about trouble. Eirikk would later claim that before the boat was about to go under he had jumped into the water with his lifebelt on and swam towards the nearest boat. When he tried to get on the boat the crew man pointed a pistol at him and told him that if he had wanted to get on the boat he would have to give his lifebelt to one of the women passengers and then take up position at an oar. However, there is likely dramatic licence in this account and it is most likely that he boarded one of the aft starboard boats, probably Lifeboat 15.\n\nAfter his arrival in New York he stayed for a while at St. Vincent’s Hospital to recuperate.\n\nEirikk, who became “Erick” in the United States, was later joined by his wife and the couple settled in Minnesota and had two sons. The family lived in Nashwauck, Minnesota before moving to Ashtabula, Ohio in later years. What became of Erick’s wife is not clear but he was later remarried to another Finnish lady, a widow named Maria W.

Johannes decided to travel to the United States to search for his brother. Once well established with a job and property, would send for his fiancée Anna.\n\nJohannes went by boat from Haugesund to Newcastle and from there by train to Southampton where he boarded Titanic as a third class passenger.\n\nDied: Johannes died in the sinking. His body, if recovered, was never identified.\n\nHis widowed father, Halvar, later received £40 from the Titanic Relief Fund. He would pass away in 1918. What became of Johannes fiancée Anna is unknown. In later years it transpired that Johannes’ brother Godskalk, whom he was traveling to find, was killed not long after his arrival in the United States in a gunfight between cattlemen and homesteaders.\n\nback to top\n\nMr. Einar Gervasius Karlsson, Age 21\n\nMr. Einar Gervasius Karlsson was born on June 19, 1890 in Oskarshamn, Sweden. He was the son of Per Fredrik Karlsson (1856-1912) and Emilie Jonsdotter (b. 1860).\n\nFollowing his schooling Einar served in the Swedish Army, rising to the rank of corporal before his discharge around 1911. Due to a lack of opportunities in Sweden, Einar and his friend Johan Charles Asplund decided to leave for America where Einar hoped to become a teacher. They boarded the Titanic at Southampton as third class passengers.\n\nSurvived: On the night of the sinking Einar and his friend, Johan, were awake in their cabin and felt the thud of the impact with the iceberg. Leaving to investigate they made their way to the forward well-deck where they saw chunks of ice. Seeing Lifeboat 13 being lowered, they took a chance and jumped out onto the falls and slid down into the boat. Einar’s hastened entrance into the lifeboat left him with rope burns on his hands and legs and his shoes were destroyed. From the lifeboat he watched the ship go down and remembered the screams of those struggling for their lives, a sound that would forever haunt him.
