        "text": "*\n\nThe Detroit Armenian community was saddened on Saturday, March 11, by the loss of the prominent Armenian benefactor Karl (Kaloust) Sogoian, who died after a long illness at Beaumont Hospital in a Detroit suburb at the age of 80.\n\nKarl Sogoian was an ingenious individual and very original in his thinking. Thanks to his precocious intelligence he was able to excel in his studies and he received his Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Detroit Institute of Technology. He was the son of immigrants from Kharpert, in Armenia and he was born in Detroit. For over 50 years he had been an active leader and innovator in the engineering and manufacturing field and he developed a number of successful industrial projects, in addition to operating a precision manufacturing company, which he founded in the high tech machining industry, serving such major customers as General Motors, Detroit Diesel Corporation and the U.S. military complex. One of the examples of many successful patents is the hydraulic door closer in common use for over 40 years in buildings around the world. He also held many patents of mechanical innovations and he was always hopeful that he would implement them to be able to better serve his community.\n\nKarl Sogoian was a respected businessman in the Detroit manufacturing world and many challenging mechanical problems were directed to him and he was able to solve them, thanks to his ingenuity in mechanical engineering.\n\nKarl Sogoian's interests were many and varied. Besides his work as an innovative engineer and industrialist, he was a pillar of the Armenian Church and the Armenian community. He was respected throughout the Detroit Armenian community, and his munificence extended to many Diaspora communities, as well as Armenia. His philanthropic deeds are well known worldwide as they relate to humanitarian causes and alleviating human suffering.\n\nSimilar to his unique talent in his own profession, Sogoian was a very original thinker in community life, and he had developed his own philosophy of serving the Armenian community. He would be ranked as the most ecumenical benefactor throughout the Armenian community because he never directed his philanthropic endeavors to one single organization or group. Regardless of their affiliation all religious and cultural organizations benefited from his charitable activities. That is why he became a patriarch, in a way, on the path of Alex Manoogian, who was his close friend and associate in many relief projects. One of his major concerns was the Church unity. As a respected benefactor he pleaded, reasoned, and sometimes chided church leaders in his relentless pursuit of unifying the Church. In his mind the Armenian Church was one and indivisible, and that is why he treated with equal respect all church entities and all clergy.\n\nKarl Sogoian also developed many scenarios in helping to resolve problems facing independent Armenia, which is surrounded by hostile nations. He had an obsession to develop certain strategies and to appeal to world leaders to attract attention on Armenia's plight. One of his significant feats was to meet Soviet President Gorbachev's wife in Washington, D.C. and present a Slavonic Bible to generate awareness of Armenia's needs among the Soviet hierarchy. His contacts with the world leaders were featured in the news media at the time.\n\nProbably his most passionate interest outside of his work was the pursuit of world peace. He had written \"Thunderbolt to National and International Forced Behavior NOW!\" and \"Thunderbolt AGA\", a paper detailing plans for the Caucasus region to become an economic unit. He presented his plan to the top officials at the United Nations in New York City in 1997. He had also sent copies to political and church leaders in all the major countries represented in the United Nations. He traveled extensively, identifying humanitarian projects and financing them to completion. Some of the projects he had undertaken are as follows:\n\nHe rebuilt a school for 400 students in Karabagh. He was very proud in financing generously the building of an impressive church in the region of Vayk in Armenia, inhabited by 75,000 parishioners. He also funded projects at the headquarters of the Armenian Church at Etchmiadzin and Cilicia.\n\nAs an art lover, Karl Sogoian was an avid collector of ancient Armenian manuscripts and artifacts and he prided himself for having acquired major paintings by Aivazovsky and many other prominent Armenian painters whose works he treasured dearly, and at times he generously donated to major Armenian organizations and museums as gifts. Although he admitted that his proficiency in reading Armenian, let alone ancient Armenian texts was limited, he had a knack of selecting choice manuscripts for acquisition. That is how he became the proud owner of one of Sargis Pitzak's masterpieces.\n\nMany artists and intellectuals who would visit from Armenia benefited from Mr. Sogoian's generosity, extending his reputation also among the intellectual circles of Armenia.\n\nKarl Sogoian was also a collector of Americana. He was known for his glass and historic gun collection and he was very knowledgeable in those areas. He knew how to delicately preserve his guns and glasses apart.\n\nThe Detroit Armenian churches especially were the major beneficiaries of his generosity. Both St. John's Armenian Church and St. Sarkis Armenian Church were able to acquire new organs, thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Sogoian's generosity.\n\nKarl Sogoian's respect and admiration went far beyond the awards he was accorded. The honors bestowed upon him were as follows:\n\nMr. and Mrs. Karl and Emma Sogoian were honored with the titles of Prince and Princess of Cilicia by the Holy See of Cilicia in Antelias in 1996. He was also awarded the medal of St. Gregory the Illuminator in 1999 by the Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of all Armenians at the Holy See of Etchmiadzin. In 1996 he was also awarded the Sarafian Medal by the Armenian Student's Association. On many, many occasions Karl Sogoian was honored by the Armenian Relief Society, by the Tekeyan Cultural Association, by Hamazkayan Cultural Society, Cultural Society of Armenians from Istanbul, Detroit Institute of Arts, Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, the State of Michigan and the United Nations in New York. He was among the list of distinguished Armenians who received the prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor in May of 2001.\n\nKarl Sogoian leaves an entire community in bereavement. He will be missed because of his straightforward ideas, his innovative leadership, his wisdom and above all, his kindness. Many, many artists and intellectuals who would visit from Armenia benefited from Mr. Sogoian's generosity, extending his reputation also among the intellectual circles of Armenia.\n\nKarl Sogoian always said that he could not have accomplished what he had, without the help and support of his caring and loving wife and close business associate for over 45 years, Emma Sogoian (nee Tabibian), who is the President and major stockholder of the Royal Oak, Michigan based K.P. Sogoian Manufacturing, Inc.\n\nKarl Sogoian will be missed by many, many people who are devastated by his loss."
