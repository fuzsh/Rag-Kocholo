Over the years, he told me, his only child, stories about being in the Army, and the Korean War. He was very proud of his participation in the Army and in the war, and we, the rest of the family are also very proud of him and all the others. His honorable discharge was always hanging on a wall in his bedroom. He always said the Army was good for young fellows, as they learned so many good methods and priorities right from the beginning of the service experience. I never thought to search online for a site such as this one. If I had realized so many people were connecting here, I would have helped my Dad enter something on this site. He was not one to adapt to modern electronics or conveniences. He married a local girl from Union, NJ, my Mom, where he grew up and moved us to Iselin when it was just all farmland. He owned a paving business, and for years helped lay the asphalt you see from Central Jersey down past Freehold and out past Flemington, NJ. He gave to the local Catholic Church, and helped parishioners out by buying whatever they were trying to sell to make a living. The 50's here in Iselin were interesting. The Monsignor at the time often would say, \"Mike, come on over here, and buy some of this from so-and-so.\" My Dad would. My Dad put neighborhood men who lived on our street to work paving driveways when they were laid off from places like General Motors or Ford. Please feel free to put a note in your columns, and write back to me if you like. If you do anything like have members of your groups on this site raise money, or crochet or in some way contribute to vets, count me in. Just let me know how I can figure in and help a bit. Best regards, Patty Coleman, Iselin, NJ 08830\n\nCarcamo, Eddie\n\nEddie M. Carcamo passed away at the Loma Linda VA on 11/24/05.

Most of his growing-up years were spent in the Wheelersburg, OH area. He would tell stories of both his Grandpa Collingsworth and Grandpa Nichols, recalling times when their families visited back to the old home place in Kentucky. He was the big brother to three fun-loving sisters, Ruby, Patsy and Janice, also born to Thomas & Leona.\n\nRaymond only completed schooling through the 9th grade, then left home at a very young age to join the United States Army. He was immediately trained and shipped to the Asian Theater, where the Korean War was already in progress. Raymond always spoke with great love and respect of the years he spent in service to his country. Matter of fact, just recently, he had told his son Phillip that he highly regretted that he did not make a complete career of his Army service. He felt those years were the best years of his life and in retrospect, had wished he had given all his years of strength to his country. Nothing roused greater emotions or a livelier argument in him, than when issues of his nation, the military and politics were mentioned. He loved to debate and would do so in a very lively exchange with anyone who disagreed with his beloved Democratic Party.\n\nOn August 13, 1950, at just 19 years of age, Raymond was granted the 3rd highest medal available (among more than 200 medals) to a soldier in the US Army. It might also be interesting to know that this medal is only granted to 1 in about 500,000 soldiers and only 1 Silver Star has been awarded since the current conflict with Iraq has ensued. This gives you some idea of its extreme significance.\n\nThe following is a synopsis of the actual presentation of the award made on August 13, 1950:\n\nBy direction of President Harry S Truman, the Silver Star (which you can see on display here tonight) for gallantry in action is awarded to the following named officers and enlisted men: Private First Class Raymond E. Collingsworth, RA15412586, Field Artillery, United States Army, a member of Battery B, 52nd Field Artillery Battalion, 24th Infantry Division, is awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action on 16 July 1950, near the Kum River, Korea. The 19th Regimental Combat Team, to which the 52nd Field Artillery battalion was attached, had been overrun by overwhelmingly large enemy forces. The enemy had also succeeded in placing a roadblock between the withdrawing American units and safety. Several attempts had been made to clear the block. Private Collingsworth approached the senior officer present and volunteered to undertake any duty assigned to him. In the face of withering enemy fire, he assisted in rallying drivers, in overturning wrecked vehicles blocking the road, and in moving unattended vehicles that were impeding progress. He assisted in leading the wounded on operable vehicles and volunteered to man a machine gun that was mounted on one of them. With the approach of dusk, it was determined that a last effort should be made to clear the roadblock since, at that time, enemy fire would be less accurate. Just before the signal to move was given, the driver of a quarter-ton truck abandoned his vehicle, thus blocking all behind him. Private Collingsworth coolly took over. He secured an automatic rifleman and a rifleman to assist himself and the convoy started. Private Collingsworth drove skillfully and courageously, refusing to stop even when other vehicles did so. He drove through three islands of enemy resistance in his break for safety. By his daring coolness and gallantry, Private Collingsworth assisted materially in extricating a group of completely surrounded men from certain annihilation. His actions brought high credit to himself and to the military service. He entered the military service from Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThis extraordinary display of courage and valor brought many accolades from home and he was the subject of several newspaper articles both in the Dayton, OH and the Portsmouth, OH areas. Raymond was later wounded in action and was transferred back to US soil where he was stationed at the Pentagon in Washington DC. He was given a high security clearance, where it was his job to destroy and burn secret intelligence documents relating to the War in Korea. By this time, he had been promoted to the classification of Sergeant in the US Army. Raymond received a Honorable Discharge upon completing his time in the US Army and he returned to Dayton, OH, where his parents now lived. He was able to obtain work right away at Delco Moraine, a division of The General Motors Corporation, in Dayton and he remained employed there for 37 years as a jobsetter, retiring in 1988.\n\nOn June 5, 1954, Raymond married his bride of 51 years, Billie Jacqueline Sparks. To their marriage was born three children: Connie Rae, Rena Joy, and Phillip Brian. His wife Billie proceeded him in death by just 14 weeks, after fighting a 6 year valiant battle with ovarian cancer. Just last week, a day or so before he died suddenly and unexpectedly, he told his housekeeper that he was going to see Billie again real soon and that he was ready to go. Raymond very rarely dressed up and to see him in a tie was almost non-existent. But when those rare occasions came along and Billie coaxed, pleaded, and begged him into putting on a tie and suit, he would always wear a tie clip, as he thought this was a part of the unusual event of finally putting on a tie and it was only to be worn for a very special occasion. So it was with much surprise that his Son-in-Law, Dave Hilligoss noticed that his tie clip was laid out on top of his entertainment center just a day or so before he passed away. When Dave asked him why the tie clip was laying out, in a reply that was the personification of Ray’s outlook on life, he told Dave not to worry about it, that it was none of his business. He must have thought that seeing Billie again was a VERY special occasion. So, he is dressed with that rare tie & tie clip tonight, as his daughter Rena ran out and bought a new tie to go with the tie clip, after the rest of the family learned of this incident.\n\nRaymond was preceded in death by his wife of 51 years, Billie J Collingsworth. He was also proceeded in death by his parents, Thomas Edward Collingsworth and Leona Gebhart, and one sister, Patsy Storey. He is survived by his children: Connie Rae and her husband, David Hilligoss of Arcadia, IN; Rena Joy and her husband, Lowell Lavy of Versailles, OH; and his only son, Phillip Brian and his wife, Kimberly of Burlington, KY. Also surviving are his two sisters, whom he loved dearly: Ruby and her husband, Bob Linville of Dayton, OH and Janice and her husband Rob Mahoney of Columbus, IN. Ray and Billie had 11 grandchildren: Janella and her husband, Jonathan Thompson of Indianapolis, IN; Brandon and Justin Hilligoss of Arcadia, IN; Regina and her soon-to-be husband, Jason Baker, of Erlanger, KY; Danette Lavy of Erlanger, KY; Brent and Allyson Lavy of Versailles, OH; and Brooklyn, Courtney, Phillip & Olivia Collingsworth, all of Burlington, KY. Also, surviving are a host of nieces and nephews, some of which are present here tonight.\n\nRaymond will always be remembered as a man who was very diligent in his work ethic, rarely missing a single day of work in his 37 yrs of employment at General Motors Corp. Even when a terrible blizzard hit the Dayton, OH area in 1977 and everyone else in the neighborhood was inside, trying to stay warm, Ray was outside, alone, trying to get his car started, planning to head out for work, until he found out that even his shop was closed, due to the weather. He always faithfully provided for his family. His children will never forget those Hershey Candy Bars and Matchbox Cars he brought home every Friday, when he stopped to cash his paycheck at Diamond Drug Store, on his way home each Friday evening.\n\nRaymond forged some close friendships with neighbors who lived in the neighborhood where he & Billie lived in the same home for 49 years. When Ray & Billie bought the home at 5355 Haverfield Road, Dayton, OH in December 1955, they had only been married for 1 ½ years and the home was brand new. They were its only occupants. Charles & Sue Blackwell, Dan & Pat Votaw, and Harold & Mary Brown were long-time nearby neighbors who became close friends with Ray & Billie and all helped out many times when their health failed. Ray knew he could call any of these friends to simply walk across the street and help when he and Billie could not do things for themselves. Their children wish to express their sincere thanks to these three couples for the support and friendship you gave to Ray & Billie in their declining years.\n\nRaymond will be remembered for his love of nature, as he always had bird feeders filled with food and watched with great interest as the different species of birds flocked to the feeders. He loved gardening and always kept both an abundant vegetable and flower garden at his home. Many of you here tonight have enjoyed the samples of tomatoes he was so proud of, coming from his own garden. His children will never forget the experiences of their mom & dad canning tomatoes from the garden, then having the jars explode all over the pantry closet. They’ll also never forget the crooked Christmas Trees that were picked out by the children, then brought home for him to try and set up. The scene will forever be in their minds of Raymond, trying to get them to stand up straight, and his signature response to such crazy situations.\n\nHe’ll also be remembered for his love of working with his hands. Both he and his sisters Ruby & Janice loved crafts and would work together on projects, a lot of them built by Raymond’s own hands by spending many hours in the workshop in his garage. The beautiful Oak Casket that is the final resting place for Raymond was chosen by his children to signify his love for working with wood and he would have so loved and appreciated the artistry and craftsmanship that went into making the casket.\n\nTo each of you that have joined his family tonight to remember Raymond, thank you for coming. You have honored Raymond, just by being present.\n\nCollins, Edward J.\n\n1LT Edward J. Collins, US Army, passed away 2 December 2007. Edward served in the 8240 AU during the Korean War.
