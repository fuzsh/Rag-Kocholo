At the end of his meal, Joel called Roderick, who was still sitting across from the woman, and asked if she could drive him home.

However, despite his confidence in the restaurant, Roderick wasn't immediately smitten. In fact, Roderick drove him to his place after their first meeting and Joel offered to play her a piano piece, but she declined.

"It was like he couldn't not be 'Billy Joel' at that moment," Roderick told the New Yorker.

Joel played a piece by Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff on his grand piano, a move he picked up from the 1955 romantic comedy The Seven Year Itch. The duo started dating soon after and Roderick moved into Joel's Centre Island home.
