        "text": "Hello there! This week our blog features a beautiful pop song, Don’t Worry Baby. We will begin with the original version of this song by The Beach Boys. We will then include a cover by the Everly Brothers and the Beach Boys, and finally a version by Billy Joel.\n\nThe Beach Boys and Don’t Worry Baby:\n\nThe Beach Boys are one of the greatest rock and roll groups in history. They were formed in 1961 in California, and initially were primarily a family band. The three Wilson brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl teamed up with cousin Mike Love and family friend David Marks. They were initially known as the Pendletones, named after the Pendleton wool shirts popular with California surfers.\n\nAt first, the Beach Boys sang while the instrumental work was provided by studio musicians who became known as the Wrecking Crew. However, the brothers gradually became proficient on various instruments – Carl on electric guitar, Brian on bass and Dennis on drums.\n\nDavid Marks left fairly early and was replaced by Al Jardine. Jardine, together with Mike Love and the three Wilson brothers, made up the “classic” Beach Boys lineup of the 60s. The Beach Boys soon replaced their wool Pendleton shirts with a combination of striped shirts and white pants. Shown below from L: Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Brian Wilson.\n\nIt soon became clear that Brian Wilson was the brains of the outfit. Brian wrote the songs, oversaw the productions, and took control of all major decisions, once their micro-managing dad Murry was ousted as the group’s agent.\n\nThe song Don’t Worry Baby was written in 1963, by Roger Christian and Brian Wilson. They had earlier written the hot-rod racing song Shut Down, and Christian’s idea was to reprise another car tune. He envisioned a guy who gets into trouble bragging about his car, but is comforted by his girl; it contained the line “She makes me come alive, and makes me want to drive, when she says ‘Don’t Worry Baby.’”\n\nAfter Christian shared his idea with Brian Wilson, Brian used Christian’s lyrics. However, unlike the up-tempo Shut Down, Wilson converted this song into a tender love ballad.\n\nWell, it’s been building up inside of me\n\nFor oh, I don’t know how long\n\nI don’t know why\n\nBut I keep thinking\n\nSomething’s bound to go wrong\n\nBut she looks in my eyes\n\nAnd makes me realize\n\nAnd she says “don’t worry, baby”\n\nDon’t worry, baby\n\nDon’t worry, baby\n\nEverything will turn out alright\n\nDon’t worry, baby\n\nDon’t worry, baby\n\nDon’t worry, baby\n\nI guess I should’ve kept my mouth shut\n\nWhen I started to brag about my car\n\nBut I can’t back down now because\n\nI pushed the other guys too far\n\nShe makes me come alive\n\nAnd makes me wanna drive\n\nWhen she says “don’t worry, baby”\n\nThe song Don’t Worry Baby was recorded in January 1964 and was included in the band’s 1964 album Shut Down Volume 2. It was released as a single in May of that year, as the B side of I Get Around.\n\nHere is a music video of the Beach Boys Don’t Worry Baby.\n\nThe Beach Boys were always known for their terrific tight harmonies, but it would be hard to top this song. That is Brian Wilson on lead vocals with a high falsetto, and he is matched with absolutely beautiful vocals from his mates. Brian produced the song, and it is a real gem.\n\nDon’t Worry Baby has had enormous staying power. It is one of the songs included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s list of 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. It is also on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nBrian Wilson was a musical genius. His writing was incredibly creative; and he pioneered several innovative studio techniques. As time went by, Brian’s work became progressively more complex and novel. All of this culminated in the Beach Boys’ seminal 1966 album Pet Sounds.\n\nUnfortunately, Brian Wilson found himself under terrific strain. A combination of drug-related and mental health issues made Brian withdraw more and more. Eventually Brian became unable to function normally; and he was unable to complete his next album concept, Smile. That project eventually became the most controversial and anticipated ‘unfinished album’ of all time.\n\nBrian Wilson’s drug and mental health issues led to a subsequent mental breakdown. It took him decades to overcome the combination of mental-health and addiction issues. However, now that he has recovered he occasionally joins up with his fellow Beach Boys for concerts.\n\nThe Beach Boys were one of the greatest pop groups in history. Their vocal style, inspired by groups like the Four Freshmen and using harmonies borrowed from barbershop quartets, is impressive and creative. They will forever be associated with the Southern California sun and surf.\n\nDennis Wilson drowned in 1983, and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. The Beach Boys provided us with a legacy of great songs and wonderful memories, for which we salute them.\n\nThe Everly Brothers & the Beach Boys and Don’t Worry Baby:\n\nDon and Phil Everly were brothers who grew up in Shenandoah, Iowa. As young children, they began performing with their parents’ Everly Family singers as “Little Donnie and Baby Boy Phil.” The legendary close harmony singing for which they became famous was a result of years of performing together.\n\nBelow is a photo of the Everly Brothers Don (L) and Phil circa 1955, from Getty Images.\n\nWhen the brothers were in high school, the family moved to Tennessee where Don and Phil were hired as songwriters by Acuff-Rose music publishers. The duo had their first big hit in 1957 with Bye Bye Love. That song was written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, and was notable because it had been rejected by 30 other groups before the Everlys took it on.\n\nBye Bye Love became a smash cross-over hit. It reached #1 on the Country charts, #2 on the pop listings and #5 in the R&B category! With Don singing the baritone lead and Phil tenor harmony, the pair’s exceptional melodies, delivered in diatonic thirds, seemed irresistible.\n\nBetween the period 1957-1962, the Everly Brothers charted 26 top-40 singles. They were an inspiration to an entire generation of rock groups that followed them. The Beach Boys and Simon & Garfunkel developed their early styles by performing Everly covers. The Bee Gees, the Hollies, and other rock ‘n’ roll groups that feature harmony singing were also influenced.\n\nThe Beatles were also big fans, performing Everly Brothers covers early in their career, and at one time referring to themselves as “the English Everly Brothers.” For example, the Beatles based their arrangement of Please Please Me after the Everlys’ Cathy’s Clown.\n\nThe Everly Brothers formed a most profitable association with the husband-and-wife songwriting duo Felice and Boudleaux Bryant. The Bryants wrote over a score of songs that Don and Phil turned into hits.\n\nDon and Phil also formed a close relationship with Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They toured together in 1957 and 1958, and one of their close bonds was that each group had started out in country music before hitting the big time as country-pop crossovers.\n\nHere is video of the Everly Brothers, performing with the Beach Boys. This is actually a medley of fragments of three songs: Don’t Worry Baby and Getcha Back from the Beach Boys; and the Everlys’ Wake Up Little Susie.\n\nAs you can see, the concert took place on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. The audio and video quality is strictly so-so, but both groups seem to be enjoying themselves, and this is particularly appropriate because the Everly Brothers were one of the groups whose sound originally inspired the Beach Boys.\n\nUnfortunately, after 1962 the hits dried up for the Everly Brothers. A controversy cut the boys off from songwriters with the Acuff-Rose publishers, and that included Felice and Boudleaux Bryant.\n\nTheir situation was exacerbated by the fact that both brothers were addicted to speed, and brother Don also developed a dependency on Ritalin. For a time, Don was hospitalized in an attempt to cure his addiction.\n\nIn 1973 during a live performance, Phil became frustrated when Don arrived drunk and unable to perform. Phil smashed his guitar and left the stage. After that, the brothers broke up and began solo careers, until they re-united in 1983.\n\nWhen Neil Young introduced the Everlys at their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1986, he observed that every musical group he belonged to had tried and failed to copy the Everly Brothers’ harmonies.\n\nIn January, 2014, Phil Everly died of lung disease. After Phil’s death, Paul Simon issued a statement saying“Phil and Don were the most beautiful sounding duo I ever heard. Both voices pristine and soulful. The Everlys were there at the crossroads of country and R&B. They witnessed and were part of the birth of rock and roll.”\n\nWe can second that. What a great duo, the close harmonies that only siblings can produce. We salute the Everly Brothers.\n\nBilly Joel and Don’t Worry Baby:\n\nBilly Joel is an American singer-songwriter. He has had an extraordinary career, and has emerged as one of the best-selling musicians of all time.\n\nJoel was born in the Bronx in May 1949, and raised in Levittown, Long Island. His father was a classical pianist who emigrated from Germany after the Nazis came to power. Billy’s mother forced him to take piano lessons as a child. Although Joel resisted this, he nevertheless became an accomplished piano player.\n\nIn high school, Billy performed at a piano bar as a means of raising some extra money. Unfortunately, this resulted in poor attendance at school; as a result, he came up short of the credits required to graduate from Hicksville High School.\n\nJoel reports that his response to not graduating was: “To hell with it. If I’m not going to Columbia University, I’m going to Columbia Records, and you don’t need a high school diploma over there’.”\n\nApparently Billy was inspired to pursue a career in music after watching the Beatles perform on the Ed Sullivan Show. Below is a photo of a young Billy Joel.\n\nBilly Joel joined several bands, in search of fame and fortune. Although he found some work as a session musician, initially he had no commercial success.\n\nBilly landed a contract with a small record company, and began recording and touring. His first big break came when a Philadelphia DJ began playing Joel’s song Captain Jack.\n\nCaptain Jack became a popular hit on the East Coast. This led to a record contract with Columbia Records in 1972, at which time Billy moved to L.A. In order to make ends meet, Billy worked at the Executive Room piano bar on Wilshire Boulevard.\n\nBilly Joel’s first Columbia release was the 1973 Piano Man. The title tune from that album, which became Joel’s signature tune, recounted some experiences from his tenure at the Executive Room.\n\nBilly released a couple more albums that showed great promise and brought him some fame. However, he became disenchanted with L.A. and returned to New York in 1975.\n\nAt that point, Joel made two major strides forward. First, he assembled a group of musicians who would become the Billy Joel band. Second, he began to collaborate with Phil Ramone who produced his records for the next 11 years.\n\nBilly Joel then proceeded to release a number of blockbuster albums. The first was the 1977 release The Stranger. That album produced four top-25 singles and reached #2 on the Billboard album charts. The album outsold Columbia’s previous best-selling record, Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water.\n\nBilly Joel had his finger on the pulse of contemporary America. He could write beautiful sentimental ballads such as She’s Got A Way and Just The Way You Are.\n\nJoel also provided caustic commentary on America’s cultural and military history in songs like Allentown, Good Night Saigon, and We Didn’t Start The Fire. Later in his career, while he was married to Christie Brinkley, Joel even harked back to his doo-wop roots with songs like Uptown Girl and The Longest Time.\n\nHere is Billy Joel in a live performance of Don’t Worry Baby.\n\nThis took place at a Brian Wilson tribute concert. Billy notes that early in his career, he used to open for the Beach Boys on tour. Further, he says that Don’t Worry Baby is one of his daughter Alexa’s favorite tunes, so he sings it for her. Billy has a band with a full horn section and backup singers, and he gives a heartfelt cover of this Brian Wilson tune.\n\nAlthough Billy Joel had not written an original hit for many years now, he has continued many successful tours. Among these were a number of Face To Face tours with Elton John, one of which I caught while visiting Adelaide, Australia.\n\nSince 2014, Billy Joel played monthly concerts in Madison Square Garden. The concerts became exceptionally popular events. Of course, these were cancelled along with everything else during the pandemic, but they are scheduled to resume later this year, if everything goes well with the vaccination campaign. Also, Bill is scheduled for a North American concert tour as well later this year.\n\nBilly Joel is currently a “living national treasure,” a singer-songwriter who wrote and performed a series of brilliant tunes over a 20-year period from roughly 1970-1990.\n\nThanks for the memories, Bill — “We’re all in the mood for a melody, and you’ve got us feelin’ alright!”\n\nSource Material:\n\nWikipedia, Don’t Worry Baby\n\nWikipedia, The Beach Boys\n\nWikipedia, The Everly Brothers"
