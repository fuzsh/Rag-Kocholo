        "text": "Hello there! Our latest post features a great pop song, Piano Man. We first review the original by Billy Joel. Then we discuss a contribution by Elton John and Billy Joel from their joint Face to Face concert tours.\n\nBilly Joel and Piano Man:\n\nBilly Joel is an American singer-songwriter. He has had an extraordinary career, and has emerged as one of the best-selling musicians of all time.\n\nJoel was born in the Bronx in May 1949, and raised in Levittown, Long Island. His father was a classical pianist who emigrated from Germany after the Nazis came to power.\n\nBill’s mother forced him to take piano lessons as a child. Although Joel resisted this, he nevertheless became an accomplished piano player.\n\nIn high school, Bill performed at a piano bar as a means of raising some extra money. Unfortunately, this resulted in poor attendance at school. As a result, he came up short of the credits required to graduate from Hicksville High School.\n\nJoel reports that his response to not graduating was: ‘To hell with it. If I’m not going to Columbia University, I’m going to Columbia Records, and you don’t need a high school diploma over there’.” Apparently Bill was inspired to pursue a career in music after watching the Beatles perform on the Ed Sullivan Show.\n\nBilly Joel joined several bands, in search of fame and fortune. Although he found some work as a session musician, initially he found no commercial success. Below is a photo of Billy Joel, early in his career.\n\nIn 1969 Billy Joel joined forces with drummer Jon Small to form the duo Attila. They disbanded after Joel had an affair with Small‘s wife, Elizabeth Weber; Elizabeth eventually became Billy Joel’s first wife.\n\nBilly landed a contract with a small record company, and began recording and touring. His first big break came when a Philadelphia DJ began playing Joel’s song Captain Jack. Most people agree that Captain Jack refers to heroin; but I remember when it was thought that it might refer to a sex toy, or something else entirely.\n\nCaptain Jack became a popular hit on the East Coast. At that time Billy moved to L.A., at least in part to escape a record contract with Family Productions, whose production of Joel’s first album had flopped. In order to make ends meet, Billy worked at the Executive Room piano bar on Wilshire Boulevard for six months during 1972-73. In order to disguise from his record company the fact that he had moved to LA, he performed at the piano bar under the name Bill Martin (Martin is Joel’s middle name).\n\nBilly Joel wrote the song Piano Man about his experiences at the Executive Room. The lyrics from Piano Man give a graphic description of a lounge singer working at a piano bar.\n\nIt’s nine o’clock on a Saturday\n\nThe regular crowd shuffles in\n\nThere’s an old man sittin’ next to me\n\nMakin’ love to his tonic and gin\n\nHe says, “Son can you play me a memory?\n\nI’m not really sure how it goes\n\nBut it’s sad and it’s sweet and I knew it complete\n\nWhen I wore a younger man’s clothes”\n\n[Chorus] La, la-la, di-di-da\n\nLa-la di-di-da da-dum\n\nSing us a song, you’re the piano man\n\nSing us a song tonight\n\nWell, we’re all in the mood for a melody\n\nAnd you’ve got us feelin’ alright\n\nNow John at the bar is a friend of mine\n\nHe gets me my drinks for free\n\nAnd he’s quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke\n\nBut there’s some place that he’d rather be\n\nHe says, “Bill, I believe this is killing me”\n\nAs a smile ran away from his face\n\n“Well, I’m sure that I could be a movie star\n\nIf I could get out of this place”\n\nJoel notes that the people described in Piano Man were actual folks who were regulars at the Executive Room. As just one example, the waitress who “is practicing politics” refers to his first wife Elizabeth Weber, who worked at the lounge while Billy performed.\n\nPiano Man was released as a single in November, 1973 and was the title tune from Billy Joel’s 1973 Columbia Records album. The song has become an iconic hit and Billy’s signature tune. However, it was initially only a minor hit, and peaked at #25 on the Billboard charts.\n\nThe original tune ran to 5:37, which Columbia Records deemed too long for a pop song. For the single release they cropped a couple of the verses and cut it to 4:30. They also released a 45 single of the song that cut it even further to 3:16.\n\nHere is Billy Joel in a live performance of Piano Man from 1976.\n\nThis was an appearance on the Tonight Show. Bill stars on piano and harmonica on this tune. It is a waltz that features a series of notes declining down the scale, and the melody will stick in your head for weeks.\n\nBy now, Piano Man has become one of the great pop standards. It is one of Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and in 2015 the Library of Congress named it to its National Recording Registry, labeling it “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.”\n\nBilly returned to New York in 1975, where he made two decisions that had a major effect on his career. First, he assembled a group of musicians who would become the Billy Joel band. Second, he began to collaborate with Phil Ramone, who would produce his records for the next 11 years.\n\nBilly Joel then proceeded to release a number of blockbuster albums. The first was the 1977 release The Stranger. That album produced four top-25 singles and reached #2 on the Billboard album charts. The album outsold Columbia’s previous best-selling record, Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water.\n\nBilly Joel then became a pop superstar. At that time, Piano Man became Joel’s signature tune and the final song he would perform in his concerts. His fans know the words by heart and sing along with him.\n\nFor the next couple of decades, Billy Joel had his finger on the pulse of contemporary America. He could write beautiful sentimental ballads such as She’s Got A Way and Just The Way You Are. He provided caustic commentary on America’s social and military history in Allentown, Good Night Saigon, and We Didn’t Start The Fire.\n\nHe also produced songs that skewered American social and cultural mores, such as Only The Good Die Young, Big Shot, and The Entertainer. Later in his career, while he was married to Christie Brinkley, Joel even harked back to his doo-wop roots with songs like Uptown Girl and The Longest Time.\n\nIn 2014, the New Yorker ran a profile of Billy Joel titled Billy Joel, 33-Hit Wonder. Author Nick Paumgarten pointed out that following an extraordinary career as a singer-songwriter, Joel had not written an original hit for nearly 20 years (nearly 30 years by now).\n\nHowever, he has continued many successful tours during this period. Among these were a number of the afore-mentioned Face To Face tours with Elton John. Since 2014, Billy Joel has been playing roughly one concert every month in Madison Square Garden. The concerts have become exceptionally popular events. Billy can no longer hit the high notes, so the songs are performed in a lower key, but otherwise the arrangements are nearly identical to the original tunes.\n\nBilly Joel is currently a “living national treasure,” a singer-songwriter who wrote and performed a series of brilliant tunes over a 20-year period from roughly 1970-1990. Thanks for the memories, Bill — “We’re all in the mood for a melody, and you’ve got us feelin’ alright!”\n\nElton John & Billy Joel and Piano Man:\n\nElton John is one of our favorite rock musicians. He was born Reginald Dwight in a suburb of London in 1947. He adopted the stage name “Elton John” as a composite of Elton Dean, saxophonist in his first band, and blues singer and mentor Long John Baldry.\n\nAt age 11, he was awarded a junior scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. Elton recalls that he was not a diligent student and was not particularly attracted to classical music. He subsequently left high school at age 17 to pursue a career in pop music.\n\nBelow is a photo of Elton John in 1973. This is the way I remember him – as the wild and crazy rocker sporting a feather boa, before his more sedate (but sober) recent appearances as Sir Elton John. Nothing seemed too outrageous in those days – gigantic embossed glasses; feather boas; ruffles and lace; you name it, Elton appeared in it.\n\nA unique feature of Elton John’s career was his decades-long collaboration with lyricist Bernie Taupin. The two were introduced in 1967 when each of them answered an ad for musicians in the British magazine New Musical Express. Taupin would mail sets of lyrics to Elton, who supplied the melodies that produced ballads, rocking tunes and funky cross-over hits (the two never collaborated in person).\n\nFollowing the first big Taupin-John hit Your Song in 1970, Elton John embarked on an incredibly productive and versatile career. During the 70s he came out with one blockbuster album after another.\n\nElton’s outrageous behavior occurred during his ‘manic phase,’ a time when he was heavily into cocaine and sexually voracious. Elton still marvels that he did not die of a cocaine overdose, or catch AIDS. The upside of this otherwise dangerous and destructive period was that Elton John was incredibly productive.\n\nI have vivid memories of one of the Face To Face tours that paired Billy Joel with Elton John. I was visiting Adelaide University in South Australia in March 1998, doing physics research, when I noticed that the Elton John-Billy Joel concert would be playing at the Adelaide Oval cricket grounds.\n\nAlas, the ticket prices ($400 Australian and up) were out of my league. However, on the evening of the concert I wandered past the Adelaide Oval. To my great delight, a gigantic pair of video screens were mounted directly behind the stage.\n\nAlthough I could not see either of the performers directly, I had a great view of them onscreen; and even outside the cricket venue, the sound was terrific. I sat on the grass and thoroughly enjoyed watching Joel and John play selections of their own and each other’s greatest hits, and perform several duets.\n\nThe final set of encores featured a number of favorites, and the concert concluded with Piano Man. Here are Elton John and Billy Joel performing Piano Man on one of their Face to Face tours.\n\nElton and Billy trade verses and join in together on the chorus. They both noodle on their pianos while Billy plays harmonica. They portray a sense of great friendship and camaraderie, which is heightened when Elton screws up the lyrics near the end. And the audience loves it.\n\nSadly, the Face to Face tours did not leave Elton and Billy as great friends. Elton, who has now maintained his sobriety for decades, has criticized Joel for his alcoholism. And Joel, who swears that he now drinks only wine, and in moderation, responded angrily to Elton’s claim that Billy never took his rehab stints in 2002 and 2005 seriously.\n\nIn any case, fans loved seeing the two most famous “piano men” on the planet performing “Face to Face” in concert. We salute Elton and Billy – two pop superstars.\n\nSource Material:\n\nWikipedia, Piano Man (song)\n\nWikipedia, Billy Joel\n\nWikipedia, Elton John"
