        "text": "Christie Brinkley‘s been living in an uptown world!\n\nThe 70-year-old model was spotted in the audience at her ex-husband Billy Joel’s Madison Square Garden show on Friday (April 26), and in a fan TikTok video, Brinkley is seen smiling and dancing along to the 1983 hit, “Uptown Girl.”\n\n“Billy Joel wrote ‘Uptown Girl’ about his then-partner Christie Brinkley,” read text over the clip. “Tonight she watched him sing the song he wrote about her to all of Madison Square Garden.”\n\nIn his 2014 biography, Billy Joel: The Definitive Biography, Joel revealed that he originally wrote the classic about all of the models in Manhattan, but changed the initially plural title of the song to singular when he began dating Brinkley. Brinkley and Joel tied the knot in 1985 and welcomed their daughter Alexa Ray Joel that same year. They were married for nearly a decade before divorcing in 1994."
