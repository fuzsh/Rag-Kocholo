I was a teenager at the time, around 13 -14 and it had a catchy chorus...\n\nI might be wrong but i think it went a little bit like this......\n\nWe used to run together L _ o _ u _ i _ s _ e\n\nWe used to be happier than a ??? (something or an other)\n\nThat's where i can't remember anymore of the lines. But i remember the lead singer had a fairly deep voice and a good one too.\n\nIs that the song F/B ?\n\nGod, that's a long time ago and a great era in music.\n\nThat's the song Spinner, my memory is as good as yours...we must be getting old.\n\nI'l upload it to Youtube it once Scrappy has done his magical trick. We can't let classics from our youth disappear forever.\n\nRe: One for Scrappy, a rarity!!!\n\nby Scrappy Wed Jan 08, 2014 10:09 pm\n\nGood to see some of you more senior baby boomers' reminiscing'\n\nRe: One for Scrappy, a rarity!!!\n\nby Scrappy Thu Jan 09, 2014 2:50 pm\n\nGot a hold of some James Wright Trax\n\nHeard Louise for the first time today[44 years later !]\n\nA very good song\n\nLead singer has a rich voice\n\nBits + pieces of The Guess Who, Blood Sweat and Tears , and Douggie Parkinson in the voice\n\nAnd just for some of you the opening line of the song\n\nLouuuuuuuweeeeeeeeze\n\nLike a picture on a photograph.\"\n\nLast edited by Scrappy on Fri Jan 10, 2014 8:56 am; edited 3 times in total\n\nRe: One for Scrappy, a rarity!!!\n\nby IAmTheWarrior Thu Jan 09, 2014 3:00 pm\n\nWow- delivered in just over 24 hours- you are amazing Scrappy!!

They became a regular at \"Big Daddys Discotheque\"--now there is a name from the past. They were also known for a short while as \"James Riot\"\n\nFast forward a year and they became a five piece band known as \"James Wright Group\"\n\nThey shared the billing at many places in Adelaide over a couple of years with The Valentines, The Twilights, Max Merritt and The Meteors, Billy Thorpe and The Aztecs, The Mixtures and also performed as a backing band for solo artists including Johnny Farnham, Ronnie Burns, Jeff Phillips, Liv Maessen and Johnny Young.\n\nFunny thing was that no band member had the name \"James Wright\" so I don't know how they came up with this name.\n\nRe: One for Scrappy, a rarity!!!\n\nby Southee Thu Jan 30, 2014 3:44 pm\n\nIf anyone finds the album or single by adelaide band \"FAB\" called \"happy people\" ... Let me know. It's from about 1985 and produced by Split Enz keyboard player Eddie Rayner.
