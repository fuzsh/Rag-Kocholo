Joel's daughter, Alexa Ray, far left, and an unidentified guest, are also seen. [AP]\n\nJoel, 55, wed Lee in a sunset wedding at his waterfront home, Newsday reported in its online editions. Columbia Records, Joel's label, announced the marriage Saturday night. A spokeswoman for Joel could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nJoel, who was previously married twice, including to supermodel Christie Brinkley, has had more than two dozen Top 10 hits, including his signature song \"Piano Man,\" which was released in 1973 and became a hit the next year.\n\nLast month, Joel's star was placed on Hollywood Boulevard in front of the Pantages Theatre, where the Tony Award-winning musical based on his songs, \"Movin' Out,\" is playing through Oct. 31. He is also a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nLee, a native of Huntington, W.Va., recently graduated from Ohio's Miami University and works as a restaurant correspondent for the PBS show \"George Hirsch: Living It Up!\" She and Joel began dating last year, according to Newsday."
