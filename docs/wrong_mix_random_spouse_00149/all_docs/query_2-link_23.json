        "text": "WHILE the rest of alternative music was cranking up their guitars and pretending they didn't care about anything, the Five did the unthinkable - they were fronted by a piano player and mixed the heartfelt with the humourous. Their self-titled debut was a revelation, employing great melodies, old-school harmonies and intelligent songwriting that harked back to the likes of Joe Jackson and Billy Joel. The blend of jokey and sentimental is best exemplified by breakthrough single Underground (which charted in the UK and made it to number three in Triple J's Hottest 100 of 1996), a song that manages a perfect balance between poking fun at the cliquey alternative scene while being obviously reverent to it at the same time. Even the tongue-in-cheek title Best Imitation Of Myself belies a serious side, as does Julianne, in which the narrator meets \"a girl who looked like Axl Rose\". The intelligence in the songwriting shines through on every track, including the poignant character piece Boxing, the cheeky Uncle Walter, the end-of-a-relationship study The Last Polka, the upbeat salute to quitting Jackson Cannery, and the mysterious and mischievious Philosophy. On top of its smarts, humour and heart, it sounds great - Folds famously called it \"punk rock for sissies\", but there is a free-wheeling chemistry in Folds' honkytonking, Robert Sledge's fuzzed bass and Darren Jessee's drums, plus the great harmonies, that make this just great alternative pop and one of the more refreshing albums of the '90s.\n\nTHE formula set on their first album continues brilliantly on the follow-up - the outcasts of Underground have risen to fame and fortune in opener One Angry Dwarf & 200 Solemn Faces or fully embraced their apathy in Battle Of Who Could Care Less, while the relationship woes of The Last Polka are explored more deeply in Fair, Smoke and the album's jazzy epic Selfless, Cold & Composed. The sense of humour reaches its peak on the Jessee-penned Song For The Dumped, and Folds' penchant for characters continues in the rollicking Kate and the humourous clarinet-whirling kiss-off Steven's Last Night In Town. But it was the serious end of the scale that yielded the band's biggest hit - the astonishingly bold ballad Brick, which examined Folds' experiences of going with his girlfriend to get an abortion. Brick is an amazing piece of art, capturing the emotion of the moment without every pontificating about the matter at the song's focus. \"I didn't really want to write this song from any kind of political standpoint, or make a statement,\" Folds said before playing the song on his Ben Folds Live album. \"I just wanted to reflect what it feels like.\" Recorded in a house in the band's hometown in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the album finishes with two of their most beautiful moments - Missing The War and the aching Evaporated. The album went top 10 in Australia and Japan and cracked the top 50 in the UK and US. If you haven't got it yet, make sure you get the remastered version released in 2005 which features seven bonus tracks including their excellent versions of The Buggles' Video Killed The Radio Star and their lounge take on The Flaming Lips' She Don't Use Jelly, plus their stunning contribution to the Godzilla soundtrack, Air.\n\nHALF left-overs, half live tracks, there are some real gems here. The opener Eddie Walker was apparently \"the first song to click in rehearsal\", immediately revealing their sound, and it wound up as a b-side. Emmaline, left off their debut because it had guitar on it, is one of their greatest songs, with airy harmonies and a killer chorus hook. The best insight into the band's wacky sense of humour can be found in Dick Holster and For Those Of Y'All Who Wear Fannie Packs, both improvised screw-arounds recorded during sound checks. Another first album off-cut, Tom & Mary was left off because they band didn't really care for it, but it's got a cool groove and one of those effortless Folds melodies. Bad Idea was made in five hours for the soundtrack to The Truth About Cats & Dogs, the band actually attempts some jokey heavy metal on The Ultimate Sacrifice and Satan Is My Master, and round it out with great live versions of their songs, plus a neat Built To Spill cover.\n\nIN between his duties with the Five, Folds teamed up with his band's regular producer Caleb Southern to make some more left-of-centre music. Folds called it in an experiment, saying \"once youâ€™ve sold a million records, you've earned the right to experiment self-indulgently at the expense of your record company... I guess I haven't earned that right yet... but they let me do it anyway and we all actually agree now that it wasn't a total waste of time.\" Opening with the dark groove of the title track, it also features a faux cop show theme complete with sound effects (Kops), the trip-hop-like Slow Jam '98, the awesome robotic funk rant I Paid My Money, the absurd Beck-like jam Rubber Sled, and the ocker Root To This (which features Folds' then-girlfriend and now ex-wife Frally Hynes doing her impression of a bogan). But the real highlight is Folds' teaming with Captain James T Kirk himself - William Shatner, making his first serious return to music since his 1968 album The Transformed Man (if any of his musical outings can be called \"serious\"). His appearance on In Love (and its reprise Still In Love) is perfect for The Shat, as he intones his feelings about a relationship on the skids with all the gravitas you would expect from such a legend.\n\nFOR what would prove to be BFF's swansong, the group cut loose in the studio to make their most adventurous and fascinating album. Signalling their intention with opener Narcolepsy, they ramp up the drama and add swirling strings to Folds' lullabye-esque progressions as he likens being emotionally distant to the medical condition where a person randomly falls to asleep. Don't Change Your Plans continues the ambition with a bridge of Bacharach horns and strings, Mess is a beautifully polished piece that could have come from the US East Coast circa the '70s, while Jessee's Magic could be the best Billy Joel song Billy Joel never wrote. The album's big single was Army, which showed they still had a sense of humour as Folds' recalled his teenage years with the welcome of addition of a spirited horn section. Elsewhere there is the fleeting moment of beauty in Hospital Song, the jokey Your Redneck Past, the trippy phone message Your Most Valuable Possession (which was left on Folds' machine by his dad early one morning as his dad was half awake and thinking about an impending shuttle launch), and the loungey Regrets. The album's closer Lullabye sounds like it could have come from either of their first two albums before bursting into some cool big band jazz, although the Australian version closed with bonus track (Theme From) Dr Pyser, a wonderously arranged opening credits piece for a non-existent movie that sounds like it feature spies and a Middle Eastern setting. ...Reinhold Messner was the album the band chose to play in its entirety when they reunited for a one-off concert in 2008, as the band considers it their finest work, despite Folds calling it a commercial and critical failure."
