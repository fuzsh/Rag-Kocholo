If you sold candy bars along with those contracts, I might've been pretty easily coerced... :wink:\n\nNo, it's not your doing that's keeping the bar a little quiet. I can only speak for myself, but I've been at work, focusing on D2 with my free time, and still fuming a bit about my birthday (thanks for the good wishes, but my b-days always suck) so it's been a less than exciting week.\n\nAnyone got Christmas plans? I had been thinking a couple months back to go to Maine to see the folks, but it ain't happening. Now I'm gonna be trapped with my roommates, along with a mother, sister, and brother-in-law that aren't mine. ...Celebra-a-ate good time, c'mon!... :\\ I can't imagine what kind of Christmas shopping I can do for all these random people.\n\nTea, anyone? I should get some sleep. Although I've got the night off, I think I'm gonna visit the girlfriend at work tonight...\n\nJcakes1\n\nNew member\n\nMay 15, 2008\n\n16,164\n\n0\n\n0\n\nDec 12, 2008\n\n#25,423\n\nI'll grab a green tea it is too early to start on the beer just yet (will start in another half an hour - it is 11:30am friday).\n\nI am heading to coffin bay for a week of fishing, swiming, surfing etc. for about a week over christams. It is ~ 700 km from adelaide by road, or 280km as the crow flies.\n\npancakeman\n\nNew member\n\nMay 27, 2005\n\n9,735\n\n0\n\n0\n\nDec 12, 2008\n\n#25,424\n\nCoffin Bay sounds like a setting for some cheesy SciFi original movie thing. If I send them the title they could have a 2 hour cheesefest starring Stephen Baldwin in 2 weeks.\n\nGrape Fanta, please. I feel like something different tonight. Medal of Honor has me in it's mushy grasp, though I tried to stay away from it. Was up til way too late last night playing, and it might happen again tonight if I don't control myself. I have 2 (2!!!) 250-question reviews to do by tomorrow night, and MoH will just ruin my chances of passing this class. Silly me, I though that when the prof said the reviews were lengthy she meant 75 to 100 questions. Not 500.\n\nJohn Remedy\n\nWell-known member\n\nJul 17, 2007\n\n3,299\n\n228\n\n63\n\nDec 12, 2008\n\n#25,425\n\n@ pancakeman: Do you mean something like Lake Placid? There are of course *many* more.\n\nMy wife is down! I'm absolutely estactic. Although we're recovering from the bottle of vodka we had between us last night... MAde some headway with the solicitors this morning. The new lady handling my case sounds about 14 on the phone, but I'm sure she has five times as many qualifications as I do.\n\nI've got work at 4...

It took me a while to stop laughing. Happy times.\n\nGoltar got that last week, he's 29.\n\nShe asked for \"Dad\" and he responded, \"I AM Dad....\" that left her a bit flustered....\n\nReminds me of an encounter I had towards the end of last year (June 2008 ish). Knock on the door, there's a saleswoman there, the following conversation:\n\nHer: \"Hi I'm from BT, do you pay the phone bills at this house?\"\n\nMe: \"No, I'm afraid not\" - (Student accommodation, we didn't rent a phone line)\n\nHer: \"Oh, are your parents in?\"\n\nMe: \"No, they're half the country away.\"\n\nI thought it was brilliant, it was essentially the same as being ID'd at a bar. It probably helps if you know that I generally look about five years older than I actually am. :jig:\n\nSomeone serve me some decent dark beer. I was at the Birmingham Christmas Market last night and had a great time. I've also ended up with a drinking horn with a capacity for a pint, which is amazing. Now, I just need to stop using it for long enough to tidy up the house and pack my bags to go home for a fortnight!\n\n*Throws a green tea to Fast Eddie and a grape Fanta to pancakeman*\n\nEnjoy!\n\nJohn Remedy\n\nWell-known member\n\nJul 17, 2007\n\n3,299\n\n228\n\n63\n\nDec 13, 2008\n\n#25,428\n\nThanks for the beverage SiTro... Just about caught that...\n\nMy wife is watching the X-Factor Girls Aloud whatever on TV, and my PC headset is broken so I can't drown it out! Must... find... MP3 player...\n\nIncidentally we're both drinking Vodka and Relentless in preperation for the Tradition of Saturday night D&B & Subway night in Newquay, 0030-0500. She doesn't like D&B, she doesn't like half the people we're going with, and she won't like the club once she gets there. However, I don't care. It's my tradition.\n\nEddie's old film reviews: Over The Hedge is *the best* animated film ever. I found Blood Diamond very riveting and interesting, but also far too Hollywood. I'm not sure what the wife wants to watch next.

Though that's a little harsh if you haven't seen her much in the past couple months, even if she's not into your music it's still cool that she'll put up with it just to spend time with you.

Most people think that DnB, or any electronic music, afficionados are the ones with the bad taste in music. Meanwhile, I'm dry heaving when anything that gets MTV airtime is within earshot.\n\nBilly Joel and Elton John are classics, so there's no way I can bash on you. Heck, I grew up in the '80s, I still like Wham and George Michael and Peter Gabriel. Should I be ashamed to admit it? Maybe... but at least people know those artists. If I said I someone should pick up Dieselboy, Goldie, Modeselektor, and Matthew Dear, people just nod and pretend I'm talking about yummy cookies and unicorns.\n\nJcakes1\n\nNew member\n\nMay 15, 2008\n\n16,164\n\n0\n\n0\n\nDec 14, 2008\n\n#25,432\n\nI don't have anything against DNB perse, I just enjoy it (or can really tell the difference between the individual songs ). I also really hate what ever gets played in clubs (hence why I am a pub boy). I do however like Daft Punk and the Chemical Brothers (so I guess I like some electronic music).\n\nI guess my taste in music is mainly 70's 80's and 90's.\n\nZarfen\n\nNew member\n\nFeb 15, 2005\n\n4,123\n\n0\n\n0\n\nDec 14, 2008\n\n#25,433\n\nYou almost had me there, oh diablo, lord of addiction.\n\nIf I didn't have my cd's at my parents, I would have installed lod and thrown some assasin or weredruid action today...\n\nLuckily I was forseeing enough to \"forget\" my copy of the game, and now the worst abstinence have died out...\n\n:thumbup:\n\nEdit: @Sitro: Door-to-door salesmen are annoying I once got held up for 20 minutes by a guy from british gas when I lived in London...

I haven't even started to prepare for it, and it's just 10 days now!\n\nAs I said, I try to not get all sucked up in d2 again, but I might consider joining a tournement or something during the holidays. And d2 only entertains me for so long at a time these days, I mostly plan builds that never happen, and then you get tired of you chars... And now all my chars are gone! So if I was to come back I'd have to make a fresh start... If I don't coun't my e-mail backup of my relatively poor, but very much enough for me, higher end items stash that is\n\nAnd don't think I'm not watching you!

I guess it did sound a bit harsh, but it turns out that I was spot-on. Her girlfriend she was hoping to go with dropped out, she didn't like the music, and she said she didn't feel drunk enough to dance. But she did say she was quite happy to get chatted up by strange men at the bar while I did the hardstyle shuffle with my friends on the dancefloor.\n\nMy taste in music is pretty bad so I can't really comment. (the last concert I went to see was Billy Joel and the one before that was Elton John )\n\nActually my friend that drove us was listening to Elton John. We opened the car door, buzzing on Relentless, ready for four hours of D&B: \"WTF... Is that Candle In The Wind?\""
