        "text": "Billy Joel is back in the spotlight thanks to the CBS airing of his 100th show at Madison Square Garden, despite being controversially cut part of the way through due to coverage of golf's Masters Tournament.\n\nThe 74-year-old legend will conclude his series of performances at MSG this July, his 104th in the series and his 150th lifetime performance, and he's been supported on his journey by his many family members.\n\nSome of his loved ones have also made appearances at his shows over the years (backstage and on-stage), including one of his ex-wives, plus his musically inclined daughter. Read on below to learn more about Billy's love life and his blended family with his three children…\n\nElizabeth Weber Small\n\nIn the late 1960s, Billy joined the rock group The Hassles, but in 1969, he and drummer Jon Small broke away to form their own duo, Attila.\n\nThe duo only lasted for one year, however, as they broke up when it was revealed that Jon's wife Elizabeth Weber was having an affair with his bandmate. Jon and Elizabeth had a son together, and when news of the relationship broke, they split up, as did Billy and Elizabeth.\n\nHowever, she reconnected and reconciled with the \"Piano Man\" singer shortly after, and they resumed their relationship, tying the knot in 1973, with Elizabeth becoming his manager. Their marriage wasn't to last, and they finalized their divorce in 1982.\n\nChristie Brinkley\n\nIn 1983, Billy met supermodel Christie Brinkley in St Barts and they soon struck up a romance, two years after Christie's own divorce from French artist Jean-François Allaux.\n\nIn March 1985, they tied the knot on a yacht on the Hudson River and nine months later, they welcomed their daughter Alexa Ray Joel. Alexa is a singer, songwriter, and pianist just like her dad and has joined him onstage at his MSG residency multiple times, most recently in February.\n\nMORE: Christie Brinkley turns 70! Iconic supermodel moments, from swimsuit covers to shooting with her lookalike daughters, in photos\n\nWhile Christie and Billy got divorced in 1994, they remained close friends and co-parents, having spoken of each other highly in the years since, and Christie often attending her ex's sold-out shows.\n\nKatie Lee\n\nIn 2003, Billy met chef Katie Lee, best known for her appearance on Food Network shows and contributions to Iron Chef America, at a rooftop bar at The Peninsula Hotel in NYC.\n\nBilly and Katie, who is three decades his junior, tied the knot in October 2004 at his Oyster Bay, Long Island home, with Alexa acting as maid of honor and Christie in attendance, who gave the marriage her blessing.\n\nTRENDING: Madonna's son David Banda, 18, towers over her in glittering flares\n\nLess than five years later, in June 2009, Billy and Katie announced their separation and were divorced shortly after. Katie has since married TV producer Ryan Biegel and they have one daughter together.\n\nAlexis Roderick\n\nIn 2009, the \"Uptown Girl\" hitmaker began dating Alexis Roderick, an equestrian and former Morgan Stanley exec, who is three decades younger. After six years together, they tied the knot in Long Island on the Fourth of July in 2015.\n\nDISCOVER: Rob Kardashian shares very rare glimpse of life with daughter Dream and her new hair\n\nBilly and Alexis have been together since, and a month after their wedding, they welcomed daughter Della Rose Joel (now eight years old). Their second daughter, Remy Anne Joel, was born in October 2017 and is now six.\n\nBoth girls have joined their half-sister Alexa on stage at MSG, making for a tender moment in 2019 as they serenaded their dad with \"Happy Birthday\" on his 70th birthday."
