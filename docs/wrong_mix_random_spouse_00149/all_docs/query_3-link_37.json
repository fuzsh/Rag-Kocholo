        "text": "Christie Brinkley was feeling the music as Billy Joel performed her song!\n\nOn Friday, Brinkley attended her ex-husband's sold-out show at Madison Square Garden, and got a special serenade. In a video posted on TikTok, the former supermodel is all smiles as Joel belts out his tune, \"Uptown Girl,\" which was written for her during the early years of their romance. Brinkley also appeared in the music video.\n\nIn the clip, Brinkley, 70, is all smiles as she sways to the music and mouths the words of the song along with the sold-out crowd. From the stage, the Piano Man smiled as he sang the tune and looked in his ex-wife's direction.\n\nJoel, 74, and Brinkley were married from 1985-1994. Together, the pair are parents of Alexa Ray Joel, 37.\n\nFollowing the show, Brinkley shared a video filled with snippets from the concert including her dancing to \"Uptown Girl,\" the moment their daughter, Alexa, surprised Joel with a performance of \"To Sir With Love,\" and singing along with her 25-year-old daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook.\n\n\"Thanks for singing us a song @billyjoel and @alexarayjoel You've got us feeling alright! Just a few snippets from a magical evening at the garden! ( sometimes with my thumb over the speaker my apologies) @sailorbrinkleycook I must add we were pretty good back up singers right? üòú #billyjoelmsg #girldad #daddysgirl #historic #residency.\"\n\nIn another video, Brinkley celebrated Alexa and Joel's moment on stage with a longer video of their duet performance of \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood.\"\n\n\"Before @billyjoel's historic residency at @thegarden becomes a souvenir that slowly fades away.. one more night to remember! Alexa Ray and her Pop in perfect harmony on, Say Good Bye to Hollywood one last time in this great huge arena that Billy has turned into his own cozy living room,\" she wrote. \"And then as if that charming duo wasn't enough, the tears welled up when she surprised her Dad with a serenade of To Sir With Love ( technical difficulties on my video so not pictured) but trust me it was sweetness personified. Billy was in his word,faklempt! (Sorry if I deleted you but I just noticed the two clips both didn‚Äôt load so trying again ‚ù§Ô∏èü©∑üíú.\"\n\nJoel's decade-long residency at Madison Square Garden is going to end in July -- following his 150th show.\n\nIn February, the GRAMMY-winning musician spoke to ET and teased his future onstage in the Big Apple.\n\n\"Well I never said I'm never going to play the Garden again, just in this particular run and the residency, that's the end of that for now,\" he shared. \"We can do the Garden again, I can play other venues in New York where I haven't played in the last 10 years, so it opens up a whole new world.\""
