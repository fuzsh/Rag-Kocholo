        "text": "CENTRE ISLAND, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) -- Billy Joel not only hosted a Fourth of July party at his home on Long Island, but surprised his guests by marrying his now fourth wife.\n\nAs CBS2's Jill Nicolini reported, 'The Piano Man' has been dating former financial adviser Alexis Roderick since 2009.\n\nIn April, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child together this summer.\n\nJoel wrote a song in the 80s for his now 29-year-old daughter Alexa Ray. She is just four years younger than her new step mom.\n\nJoel who just turned 66 surprised his guests by marrying the 33-year-old at his Center Island home.\n\n\"Go out and meet somebody at that age, and to be happy they have a child on the way, I think it's great. Like you said love is in the air. I think it's a good thing,\" Jake Jarvis said.\n\n\"Good for him. I'm 82 and still kicking,\" Sylvia Wallace said.\n\nAlexa shared a picture of the couple on Instagram. Joel's ex-wife, model Christie Brinkley was also in attendance, and took to social media.\n\n\"Congratulations to the glowing bride and groom, and to my daughter Alexa who has a wonderful friend in Alexis,\"she wrote.\n\nResidents near 20th Century Cycles, where Joel keeps his motorcycle collection, seemed to think that the 4th time would be a charm.\n\n\"I think you know, four times down the road, maybe he's got it right this time,\" Sue Beall said.\n\n\"Bottle of red, a bottle of white, I hope it works for him. He's a nice guy, I really like him,\" Stuart Cozzens said.\n\nThe ceremony was presided over by longtime biker friend of Joel's, Gov. Andrew Cuomo. So far, there has not been word on the exact sure date of the baby, but sources said it would be very soon.\n\nThe couple has opted to keep further details of the pregnancy under wraps until their new addition makes an official debut."
