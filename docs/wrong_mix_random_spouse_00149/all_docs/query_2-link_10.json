        "text": "FEW men would dare kick Elle “The Body” Macpherson out of their house — but apparently that’s exactly what Billy Joel did.\n\nThe Aussie supermodel revealed on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen that she and Joel were living together as housemates in a New York apartment when the singer brought American model Christine Brinkley home.\n\n“We were living together. I had the upstairs … in Central Park West,” said Macpherson, 54. “We were friendly, and I think he was dating Christie at the time, just starting to. So yeah, I got ousted.”\n\nThe beauty then admitted that she didn’t believe she or Brinkley individually inspired Joel’s smash “Uptown Girls”, despite Brinkley starring in the music video for the tune.\n\n“I think it was all the uptown girls, put it that way,” she said diplomatically.\n\n“I don’t need to take ownership over that. He liked tall girls.”\n\nBut the house drama wasn’t all for nothing — Joel and Brinkley went on to tie the knot and welcomed daughter Alexa Ray Joel in 1985, before divorcing in 1994.\n\nMacpherson also went on to marry fashion photographer Gilles Bensimon, 20 years her senior, in 1986. However, the pair went their separate ways just three years later.\n\nIn 2013, the supermodel then tied the knot with billionaire Jeffrey Soffer, although they also went on to split and have since revealed that their union may not have been legally recognised.\n\nMacpherson has since been linked to an anti-vaccine doctor."
