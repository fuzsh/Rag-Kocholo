Friends say Lyons’ departure will leave a huge void in the downtown parish where the spry octogenarian has been a mainstay. “He has been a rock for this parish,” said Sister Mary Riordan. “He has always been faithful in coming to church. He’s an usher here in the parish. He set up for Mass here every morning and made sure everything was ready for the priest. He’s also been a very faithful member of our St. Vincent de Paul Society. He’s been very supportive of all the parish ministries.”\n\nCathedral rector Father John McGrath said Lyons is a special person.\n\n“Billy Lyons is the kindest and most gentle man I have ever met,” Father McGrath said. “He is a dedicated heart of Biloxi. He told me this past Sunday that every morning he thanks God that he was raised in Biloxi and a member of Nativity. His pleasant approach will be missed by all the parishioners of the Cathedral parish.”\n\nA lifelong Biloxian, Lyons, who will turn 85 in October, is one of nine children – eight boys and one girl and countless grandchildren.\n\nLyons, whose wife, Joy B. Lyons (1927-1982), died 25 years ago, has three children. His oldest daughter lives in Jackson, his son lives in Houston and his youngest daughter, with whom he will be staying, lives in Owensboro, Kentucky. While he looks forward to being with is daughter, Lyons said he will miss Nativity Parish.\n\n“I go to Mass every morning and my first prayer every morning is in thanksgiving that I was baptized Catholic,” Lyons said.“I’m thankful that I was able to go to the old Sacred Heart Academy with the nuns – the Sisters of Mercy. The clergy that we had were just so kind and so good to me. I was an altar boy when I was five years-old and I’m 85 and I’m still doing it.”\n\nLyons was a Merchant Marine during World War II and later joined the Army. Following his stint in the Army, Lyons carved out a career for himself in the insurance business selling life insurance and general insurance. He was also state boxing commissioner for 13 years.\n\nThrough the years, his devotion to Nativity Parish has never wavered.\n\nWhile he wore many hats during his time at the cathedral, Lyons said what he most enjoyed was serving the needy through the St. Vincent de Paul Society and he plans to remain active with St. Vincent de Paul once he moves to Kentucky.\n\nNor has Lyons wavered in his devotion to the Blessed Mother.\n\nEvery morning before Mass, Lyons prays before the statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the cathedral’s Marian Chapel. “I’ve been to Lourdes and I’ve seen the miracle of the Memorare several times,” he said.\n\nLyons was honored during the 8 a.m. Mass on June 11, the day before his departure. “Bill’s going to be making a big change in his life,” said Nativity parochial vicar Father Bernie Papania, who celebrated the Mass. “As we can imagine, that’s not easy, so we want to accompany him with our prayers. It’s a beautiful day in God’s providence that the Feast of the Sacred Heart is the day that we will send him off with our prayers.”\n\nFollowing Mass, the celebration moved across the street to the Old Biloxi Schooner Restaurant where Lyons was presented a prayer book from the St. Vincent de Paul Society. After a chorus of “For He’s A Jolly Good Fellow”, Lyons and his friends said so long for now but, make no mistake about it, this wasn’t a goodbye because Lyons will definitely be back to visit his Nativity family.\n\n“Oh yes, I can’t stay away from Biloxi,” he said.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\ncirca 1948\n\nKenneth J. Lyons\n\nKenneth ‘Kenny’ Jerome Lyons Sr. (1927-2008) was born July 20, 1927. He was married to Margaret Germaine Sablich (1928-2007) of Biloxi, the daughter of George J.

(The Sun Herald, October 3, 2008)\n\nHe led Biloxi sports family Kenny Lyons Sr. coached his sons\n\n[from The Sun Herald, October 4, 2008, p. A8]\n\nSouth Mississippi lost one of its leading sports figures Friday with the passing of Kenny Lyons Sr. Lyons, 81, began working in the cafeteria in the Biloxi VA before retiring as a mail handler for the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nAlong the way he coached Little League baseball in the old Biloxi Southern League along Back Bay and coached his four sons, Kenny Jr., Tommy, Barry and Pat. His oldest son, Kenny Jr., prepped at Notre Dame High School before playing quarterback at Ole Miss. He said his father was special and loved by all. When it came to supporting his kids in sports, there was none better.\n\n\"We all signed football or basketball scholarships,\" Lyons Jr. said. \"When I was a kid, he was a football official and I remember going to games with him until I was 10. \"When I was a junior at Notre Dame, I threw for almost 500 yards against Picayune. He had to miss that game due to an officials' meeting. He gave up officiating to be a part of my senior season and the rest of my brothers' high school careers.\"\n\nBarry Lyons played college baseball at Delta State and with the New York Mets. Tommy Lyons pitched at Ole Miss.\n\nOutside of coaching Little League baseball and delivering the mail, Lyons loved to visit Mary Mahoney's restaurant in Biloxi. \"When he got off work, he loved going down there to celebrate the day,\" Lyons Jr. said. \"He was involved with all four of us, but baseball was the only game he coached us in. Dad was outgoing and loved to have a good time. He knew everybody in town - he was everyone's favorite mailman. He was dedicated to his sons, not just on the field.\n\n\"He will be missed. He had been in a nursing home with Alzheimer's since Hurricane Katrina. He fought a long battle, but there was no escaping Alzheimer's. Dad was one of a kind.\" And he loved to fish. \"He loved to fish Chandeleur every chance he got,\" Lyons Jr. said. \"Some of his fishing buddies were Larry Manuel, Stanley Dellenger, Errol Bradley and Harold Catchot, to name a few. He really loved his fishing.\"\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nEugene J.
