        "text": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\n\"Piano Man\" singer Billy Joel has quite a storied career.\n\nThat includes a 10-year residency at Madison Square Garden and six Grammy wins. And on February 4, the American songwriter makes a triumphant return to the Grammys main stage, performing his new song in 17 years, titled \"Turn the Lights Back On.\"\n\nBack in 2019, he told Billboard that his departure from touring hinged on staying closer to home with his current wife, Alexis Roderick. \"This is my fourth marriage now. It's not good for a relationship to be gone for that long,\" he said. \"So I became a homey.\"\n\nBilly, 74, and Alexis, 41, live a relatively quiet life. The two share a love story that spans 15 years and two daughters. Here's a complete breakdown of Billy Joel and Alexis Rocerick's relationship timeline:\n\nBilly and Alexis met in 2009\n\nThey first connected at a restaurant in Huntington, New York, per The New Yorker. He approached her table, got her number, finished dining and called her from across the restaurant to ask if she'd give him a ride home. She drove him back to Centre Island on Long Island's North Shore, and he invited her in.\n\nShe wasn't interested at first\n\nBilly first offered to play a song for her. Though she declined, he played on his grand piano anyway. \"It was like he couldn't not be 'Billy Joel' at the moment,\" Alexis told The New Yorker. \"I might have gotten a bit fresh,\" he added. She left his place that night, but mere months later, the two started dating.\n\nAlexis worked on Wall Street\n\nWhen Billy met Alexis, she worked as a risk manager at Morgan Stanley. However, he persuaded her to leave her job on Wall Street shortly after moving in with him.\n\nThe two secretly tied the knot six years later\n\nBilly and Alexis wed at his Long Island Oyster Bay estate on July 4, 2015. Guests joined for the couple's annual Fourth of July party, but instead were surprised by a wedding ceremony, according to PEOPLE. Billy and Christie's daughter Alexa Ray toasted the happy couple and gave a speech.\n\nAlexis was pregnant with their first child at the time\n\nAt the time of their nuptials, Alexis was pregnant with their first child. She gave birth to Della Rose Joel in August 2015 — one month after the couple's wedding. In October 2017, the two expanded their family when Alexis gave birth to their second daughter, Remy Anne Joel.\n\nShe is friendly with Billy's ex-wives\n\nJoel's second wife, Christie, extended well wishes to the couple after their matrimony. \"Congratulation to the glowing bride and groom... And to my daughter Alexa, who has a wonderful friend in Alexis!\" the model wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of the bride and groom. \"Wishing the growing family every happiness! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.\"\n\nLikewise, Joel's third wife, Katie Lee, spoke warmly of the two's union. \"I'm really happy for them,\" she told Extra in 2015. \"He's a great guy, he deserves all the happiness in the world, and he's a terrific father, so I'm really, really happy.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like"
