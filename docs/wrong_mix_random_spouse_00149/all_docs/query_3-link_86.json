        "text": "&#151; -- When Billy Joel and his new bride Alexis Roderick tied the knot in a surprise wedding on the Fourth of July, the guests certainly ate very well.\n\nPeople reports that the happy couple treated 40 of their closest friends and family to a feast that featured pearl oysters, jumbo spot prawns, chilled Maine lobster, carved porterhouse steak with caramelized onions, grilled tuna and white truffle mac and cheese.\n\nFor dessert, guests feasted on crème brûlée, mini lemon meringue pies and a peanut butter and Oreo ice cream bomb.\n\nThe event, which took place on the grounds of Billy's estate in Center Island, New York, also featured lanterns, fireworks, handmade garlands and an illuminated fountain.\n\nAs previously reported, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo officiated the ceremony, the nuptials were attended by Joel's 29-year-old daughter Alexa Ray, from his second marriage to Christie Brinkley, as well as actor Kevin James.\n\nThe singer, 66, and his new wife, 33, are expecting their first child, a girl, this summer. They've been dating since 2009."
