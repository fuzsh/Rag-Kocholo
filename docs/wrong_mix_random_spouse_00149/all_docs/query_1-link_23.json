        "text": "[One of many Billy Joel stories in the Newsday archives, this article originally appeared in the Oct. 29, 1989 edition.]\n\nIt's no accident that Billy Joel calls his new company \"Maritime Music. \" These days, his interests have to do as much with rod and reel as rock and roll.\n\nHe's not taking early retirement, or turning in his piano bench for\n\na park bench. But he is going through a period of transition. He\n\nrecently turned 40. His new album, \"Storm Front,\" is his first in a\n\ndozen years without producer Phil Ramone, and he's about to embark on a tour (which will bring him to Nassau Coliseum for a series of shows in\n\nlate December) with a different lineup of musicians: some holdovers from his old band, and some new faces.\n\nJoel is also undergoing a business upheaval. He is suing his former\n\nmanager Frank Weber, his brother-in-law from his first marriage and a\n\nnumber of other former associates, charging mismanaging of his money, and seeking $30 million in compensatory damages and $60 million in punitive damages.\n\nWell, at least he's got his health -- back. Joel is just regaining\n\nhis usual confident stride after surgery to remove a kidney stone.\n\nWith all the tumult in his life, it's not surprising that the man who\n\nwrote \"New York State of Mind\" has sought some Long Island peace of\n\nmind. Joel and his family have left the city. (Sting bought his former\n\napartment. ) He's returned to his native Long Island and a home near the\n\nsea in East Hampton.\n\n\"I don't miss Manhattan,\" Joel said over lunch last week at a\n\nmidtown Italian restaurant, sounding like a suburbanite who had spent\n\none too many mornings commuting to work. \"You come into the city, you\n\nforget what it's like. I came yesterday. It was raining; it took me a\n\nhalf hour to get to Fifth Avenue from the East Side. When you live here,\n\nyou get inured to the aggravation. There's a certain amount of humanity\n\nyou switch off just to get through the day. \"\n\nIn East Hampton, though, Joel has become an active supporter of his\n\ncommunity's snake-bitten baymen. And on his new album there is a song called \"The Downeaster `Alexa,' \" a compassionate ode to the recent struggles of the East End's commercial fishermen.\n\nI was a bayman like my father was before\n\nCan't make a living as a bayman anymore\n\nThere ain't much future for a man who works the sea\n\nBut there ain't no island left for islanders like me\n\n\"My feeling is they're being put out of business by politicians,\n\ndevelopers, industrial pollution, agricultural insecticide run-off and\n\nthe sport-fishing lobby,\" Joel said. (At lunch, Joel asked the waiter if\n\nthe sole he ordered was local; the waiter was noncommittal. )\n\nJoel was first moved over the plight of the baymen, who use\n\nold-fashioned methods of fishing Long Island's inland and coastal\n\nwaters, about three years ago after reading Peter Matthiesen's book\n\n\"Men's Lives. \" It's a poignant insider's look at the hard times of these\n\nEast End commercial fishermen, some of whom come from families that have been plying their trade in the area since the 17th Century.\n\n\"I feel that if these guys disappear, we've lost a lot of the\n\nidentity of what Long Island is,\" Joel said. \"Especially if you go back\n\nin the history and culture of Long Island; Herman Melville wrote stories\n\nabout them. Winslow Homer painted them. Walt Whitman wrote poems about them... A lot of the cultural identity of Long Island has a lot to do\n\nwith these people. If they go, we're just a suburb. We're no longer an\n\nisland. People forget that - we're an island. \"\n\nWhen Joel, wife Christie Brinkley, and daughter Alexa Ray moved to\n\nEast Hampton, his interest in the fishermen was further piqued by\n\nneighbor Adelaide de Menil, who was friendly with both Matthiesen and\n\nthe local fishing community.\n\n\"Adelaide is a dear friend of ours, and she told Billy about the\n\nbaymen,\" said Arnold Leo, secretary of the East Hampton Baymen's\n\nAssociation. \"He called me up and you could have knocked me over with a feather. Out of the blue, he asked me to lunch, said he wanted to talk\n\nabout what he could do. \"\n\nLeo was skeptical before the meeting. \"In East Hampton, it's not\n\nuncommon for me to get called up to meet a celebrity or some very\n\nwealthy per-son,\" he said. \"I've learned that some are very genuine\n\npeople, and some are shallow publicity hounds. So I went with an open\n\nmind to meet Billy. He is a very simple, real person. I really do like\n\nand respect him. I've asked him to appear here or there for us,\n\nsometimes do an interview. He even put in a phone call into the\n\ngovernor's office on one occasion. \"\n\nFor the baymen, things are even more bleak than when \"Men's Lives\"\n\nwas published in 1986. According to Leo, the baymen's two primary means of livelihood, scalloping and striped bass fishery, evaporated that\n\nyear. The bay scallops disappeared as a result of the brown algae bloom\n\nthroughout the Peconic Bay system. Striped bass were banned from the\n\nmarket because of high levels of PCP's. (Leo is guardedly optimistic\n\nthat there may be some limited scalloping next year, and the baymen are\n\nhoping for legislation that will also allow some striped bass sales. )\n\n\"We lost both of them the same year, and that's what Billy's song is\n\nabout, because it was a devastating blow,\" Leo said. \"The fishing\n\ncommunity just started to cave in.\n\n\"This is a very old, stable, humble part of your Long Island community.\n\nIt gave a lot of character to East End life,\" Leo said. \"We estimate\n\nthat at least fifty percent of the full-time fishing force has gone into\n\nsome other work and left fishing entirely, and another 25 percent does\n\nonly part-time fishing. Five years ago, we're talking about a community\n\nwhere most of the sons went into their fathers' work. Now they go every\n\nwhich way. \"\n\nIn \"The Downeaster `Alexa,' \" (a \"downeaster\" is a type of boat) the\n\nbayman had to sell his home, and to support his family, guides\n\nday-trippers on charter sportsfishing expeditions. It is the ultimate\n\nswallowing of pride, since baymen and sports fishermen are political\n\narchenemies. Baymen blame the sportsmen for overdevelopment, pollution and forcing legislation that limits the striped bass catch to\n\nunmarketable size. The sportsmen accuse the baymen of plundering fish\n\nstocks.\n\n\"This song, the baymen love it,\" Leo said, \"because it really does\n\ncatch the feeling of the plight. Of being confronted by these changes\n\nthat you don't really have any power over. This little corner of Long\n\nIsland was an undisturbed part of the world until relatively recently.\n\nIt's very hard to see very old, beautiful things just altered\n\nirrevocably. \"\n\nAlso altered irrevocably is Joel's relationship with former manager\n\nand ex-brother-in-law Frank Weber. Calls to Weber's office were referred\n\nto a law firm in Richmond, Va. Weber's attorney there, Dan Gecker, could\n\nnot be reached by press time.\n\nIn legal papers filed in New York Sept. 25 by flamboyant\n\nentertainment attorney Leonard Marks (whose other clients include the\n\nBeatles), Joel alleges misappropriation of funds, misuse of power of\n\nattorney, investment of Joel's money in \"high-risk, low-liquidity\n\ninvestments,\" using Joel's funds for \"unrepaid, so-called `loans' \" and\n\nnot paying them back and allowing Joel's copyrights to be used as\n\ncollateral for other loans, among numerous other charges.\n\n\"The lawsuit itself I can't discuss,\" Joel said. \"I can say I'm\n\nshocked, disappointed, I'm really hurt by the whole thing. As far as I'm\n\nconcerned, it's my third burn. There was Artie Ripp [an early manager],\n\nmy ex-wife [Elizabeth Joel, who also managed his career in the\n\nmid-1970s], now this. How many lives do I have? \" The relationships with\n\nRipp and Elizabeth Joel both ended in court.\n\nIs Joel a bad judge of character, or, like many musicians, just lax\n\nabout the business side of rock and roll?\n\n\"I go around, I'm married to Christie Brinkley, the comment I get\n\nis, `Man, you've got it made,' \" he said. \"I even have a wry comment in\n\none of the songs: `Most men hunger for the life I lead. ' But you know\n\nwhat? Nobody really knows the inside of somebody's life. I never trusted\n\nrock-and-roll money, but I should have looked after it a little\n\nbetter. \"\n\nAh, Christie: Everyone wants to know about Billy's life with\n\nChristie, his celebrity / model wife. Joel wishes people would more or\n\nless leave them alone.\n\n\"To tell you the truth, the effort to make the music, the work that\n\ngoes into it, the touring, the writing, the arranging, producing,\n\nrecording - is all I owe,\" Joel said. \"I don't feel that I have to be\n\nvery accessible other than that, because that [the music] is the essence\n\nof what people liked in the first place. I don't feel I need to keep\n\nmyself exposed, because the private life being sacrosanct is fodder for\n\nthe artistic cannon. \"\n\nJoel, wearing a smartly-tailored European suit that's a decided\n\ncontrast to the jeans and motorcycle jacket of his pre-Brinkley days,\n\nwrings his hands over a discussion he and Brinkley had over whether to\n\nappear together on \"People Magazine on TV,\" \"I didn't want to do it,\n\ndidn't want to do it, didn't want to do it. There were all these rumors\n\naround at the time that we were getting a divorce. Christie says you\n\nhave to show up, be on camera for a minute, just to deny the rumor. I\n\nsaid, I'm not gonna deny every cockamamie rumor that comes down the\n\npike. It lends credence to it. I refuse, I refuse, I refuse.\n\n\"So she hits me with this: `Mick [Jagger] would do it for Jerry. ' I\n\nsaid, aw, low blow. So I said okay. As I'm going to sleep that night,\n\nthe last thought I had before my head hit the pillow was `Wait a minute!\n\nI married you!' [Jagger and Jerry Hall have children but have not wed.]\n\nBut the next day they were in there with cameras in the house, it was\n\nvery uncomfortable. There are some things that should just remain\n\nprivate. \"\n\nBesides the overhaul in management, Joel's new album is the first in\n\na dozen years to be produced by someone other than Phil Ramone. \"Storm Front\" was produced by Joel and Mick Jones, a member of Foreigner, a successful hard pop group during the 1970s.\n\n\"It was a good working relationship with Phil Ramone. I had no\n\nproblem with it,\" Joel said. \"I just thought it was time to work with\n\nsomeone with a different spin on things. Mick Jones is a songwriter, so\n\nthere we had a good relationship. He's a good musician, a good guitar\n\nplayer, and I thought that would give him a little more insight into\n\nwhat I'm trying to do.\n\n\" I still can't be objective about my own production. I don't have\n\nas much faith in my abilities as a recording artist or singer or pop\n\nstar as I should have. I've got to have another set of brains to tell me\n\nwhat they hear. \"\n\nJoel kept only two players - drummer Liberty DeVitto and a\n\nrelative newcomer, guitarist David Brown - from his longtime band for\n\n\"Storm Front. \" The new players, who include bassist Schuyler Deale and\n\nsynthesizer player Jeff Jacobs, will also appear with Joel on tour\n\nbeginning next month.\n\nIf Joel is a hero to the baymen, he is less so to some of the\n\nmusicians with whom he has worked since the early 1970s. Respect,\n\nadmiration, and friendship toward Joel is tinged slightly with\n\nbitterness.\n\n\"After thirteen years, it would've been nice to have gotten a phone\n\ncall,\" said Russell Javors, Joel's longtime rhythm guitarist. \"I wrote\n\nhim a letter and said, when I met you, I had no hair on my chest; now I\n\ndo and it's gray. But I want to look back on the good stuff we did. \"\n\nDoug Stegmeyer, the band's former bass player, said he was depressed\n\nand hurt at first when he heard he wasn't going to be playing with Joel.\n\n\"I can understand completely wanting to change players. That I can\n\nrespect one hundred percent,\" he said. \"I'm still friendly with him -- I don't want this to be a sour-grapes-type vibe. But I feel after 14\n\nyears, I couldn't quite get it out of him [that he was no longer in the\n\nband]. But Liberty [De Vitto] told him I was this close to hearing it on\n\nthe street. \"\n\nStegmeyer has been working on projects in his recording studio in\n\nHuntington and Javors has been working on developing TV pilots and\n\nrecord company A&R work.\n\nFew who saw the Billy Joel band perform over the years thought that the\n\nmusicians were the most technically refined on their instruments, but\n\nthe band had a chemistry based on friendship and deep Long Island roots.\n\nAccording to Joel, the chemistry began to sour during the recording of\n\nthe 1986 album \"The Bridge.\"\n\n`It got to a point, it became such a big business, what we were\n\ndoing,\" Joel said. \"We did arena tour after arena tour, and rather than\n\nbe friends like we used to be, we became business associates. People\n\nwould kvetch about money, and their deal, and we weren't close.\n\nEverybody was looking in everybody else's pocket. On the `Bridge' album,\n\nit came to a head. We weren't having fun; it just wasn't fun.\n\n\"And before I came to do this album [\"Storm Front\"], I realized you\n\nnot only had to reinvent yourself, but you have to refresh your memory\n\nabout why you're doing what you're doing. \"\n\nFor Joel, that meant digging deep into the feelings he had when he\n\nwas 14 years old, playing at a dance at the Holy Family Church in\n\nHicksville.\n\n\"I had a gas,\" he said, \"girls were looking at me for the first\n\ntime who'd never at me twice. At the end of the gig, we got $5 from the\n\npriest each - that was it, I was in, I was hooked. It was one of the\n\nhighlights of my life: You get paid for this? \"\n\nJoel said it wasn't his intention to completely rid himself of his\n\nformer colleagues. \"It wasn't a matter that I called people up and fired\n\nthem,\" he said. \"I discussed it with the guys who aren't with me, and\n\nthey were gonna do other projects anyway. I haven't closed the door on\n\nworking with anyone again; I just wanted to try something different. As\n\na writer, you have an obligation to explore other means of expression. \"\n\nRussell Javors, for one, is a former colleague who thinks perhaps\n\nit's time for Joel to do just that, to challenge himself and the\n\nboundaries of rock and pop. \"Billy could turn Broadway upside down,\"\n\nJavors said. \"He could be the kingpin. He's got influences from\n\nGershwin to Lerner and Loewe... He wrote a theme for something like\n\nthat, and the theme is gorgeous. And it's a great way to get old. He\n\nwouldn't have to look over his shoulder at Bruce [Springsteen] or\n\nanybody else. He writes songs that stand the test of time, and nobody\n\nelse can touch him. He can wipe the floor with guys like Andrew Lloyd\n\nWebber. \"\n\nIf Broadway isn't on Joel's mind, turning 40 is. The first single\n\nfrom the album, \"We Didn't Start the Fire,\" is a series of rapid-fire\n\nimages of key events from 1949, the year Joel was born, to the present.\n\nAnother song, \"Leningrad,\" about a chance meeting with a stranger who\n\nbecame a friend during his 1987 tour of the Soviet Union, also makes\n\nnote that \"I was born in '49 / A Cold War kid in McCarthy time. \"\n\nBut, although the 1950s that Joel grew up in were a time of\n\nunlimited possibility, some of the people he knew from Hicksville, the\n\npeople he sang about in songs such as \"Scenes From An Italian\n\nRestaurant\" and \"Only the Good Die Young\" find themselves facing a world as altered as that of the troubled East End baymen.\n\n\"I met a guy the other day out in Montauk. He's the same age as me\n\nand was a good friend when we were in high school,\" Joel said. \"He was\n\none of the high school heroes, all the girls wanted to go out with him,\n\nhe went into the Marines, big strapping guy. I saw him in Montauk. He\n\nlives in a camper. He said `Billy, the American Dream is dead. There's\n\nno way I can afford to buy a house. I can't live on Long Island the way\n\nmy parents did. ' He's got his kid in the camper with him. He was saying,\n\n`I'm waiting for my kid to be old enough to take care of himself, then\n\nI'm outta here. ' It really chilled me. There's a lot of people like\n\nthat, who fell through the cracks. \"\n\nThe music industry has its own cracks for veteran stars to fall\n\nthrough. Paul McCartney and Elton John may still bring out hordes to\n\nconcert performances, but their records are no longer big sellers. At\n\n40, Joel is far from a has-been as a recording artist. But he may soon\n\nhave to accept the possibility that he'll never sell 7 or 8 million\n\ncopies of an album, the way \"The Stranger\" did back in the late 1970s.\n\n\"They were just numbers,\" he said nonchalantly. \"If you sell seven\n\nor eight million albums, try to grasp seven or eight million people. You\n\ncan't. It's beyond my comprehension. Number one I can understand.\n\nPlatinum album I can understand. Biggest selling record, at that time,\n\nin Columbia Records history I can understand. But seven million?... You never really know with a record. Somebody at Columbia said, `You\n\nknow, Billy? You're always a threat. You could put out an album that\n\nsells one-and-a-half, two million copies, and then the next one could\n\nsell eight million. ' I've been at it as a solo artist since 1970-71, so\n\nthat's almost twenty years being able to have success, whether it's been\n\nhigh on the charts or lower on the charts. I've been a survivor. \"\n\nBut of course, if you look at the whole spectrum of creative\n\npossibilities, as Joel seems to be just starting to show signs of doing,\n\nit hasn't really been a long career.\n\n\"I think in terms of [Irving] Berlin, or Shostakovich, these guys\n\nwho live to be 90 or 100 years old. I feel like I'm in the early part of\n\nmy composing, my productivity as a musician,\" Joel said.\n\n\"You don't necessarily have to be on the cutting edge, or a\n\ncelebrity, or a rock star to be a musician. This is just one phase of\n\nit. Maybe I'll look back and say, this was the blue period. But I intend\n\nto be an artist all my life. I don't intend to stop making music just\n\nbecause I'm not a commercial recording artist.\""
