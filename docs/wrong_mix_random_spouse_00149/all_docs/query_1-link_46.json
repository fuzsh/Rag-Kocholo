        "text": "The parents meetings are six p.m. Mondays in the Good Samaritan Hospital basement. The same 25 parents always show up, and the rest are those who attend two or three times and disappear. Initially, Bill Franklin thought it was a huge waste of time, but he slowly accepted these people are the only ones who understood the rage, the embarrassment, and the ongoing misery.\n\nThe parents sit around the long table. You state your name, your childâs name and their addiction, and then you inform the group what occurred since the last gathering. Sometimes itâs an overdose or death; other times the child entered rehab or found a job with healthcare benefits, and things are finally looking up, fingers crossed. Lots of finger crossing in the meetings that are foremost a parentsâ pep rally. Hang in, be tough, donât enable, and never give up are repeated. Never ever give up, because you never know when things will change. Cheryl Wilton, Barbara and Fredâs daughter, overdosed four times, and was squatting in a building in Camden, and she just graduated from a good college--Bates in Maine--and was accepted to a top-tier medical school. So you never know.\n\nâThe brightest light may be behind the darkest cloud,â says a cornball poster thumbtacked to the wall.\n\nActually, you never do know. Though you have a decent idea how things will play out, and itâs rarely the happily ever after everyone prays for.\n\nOver the years, Bill Franklin became friends with two fathers -- Alvin Conan, a CPA and fellow Islanders fan, and Marty Abbott, an ex-priest, who raised three adopted children who are always in trouble, and often in prison. Marty observed, âWhen jail is the best option, you know youâve done one hell of a job raising them. God help us.â\n\nMarty ends many statements with âGod help us, âitâs Godâs willâ, or he or she are âin our prayersâ.\n\nAfter a parentsâ meeting, Bill says goodnight to Marty and Alvin. Unlocking the Camry, he mentions:\n\nâI need a drink.â\n\nThey all needed a drink, and the six p.m. meetings were followed by 7:45 gatherings at Mary Carrollâs, an Irish pub in Babylon, New York. Mary Carrollâs is the perfect after meeting spot -- nearby with generous parking, the pub is never crowded, unless the Jets or Giants are on Monday Night Football. The bartenders pour a proper Guinness, too, and the shepherdâs pie is exceptional. The three fathers continue discussing their children, always asking, will it end well?\n\nThe honest answer, probably not; the odds are stacked against shiny outcomes.\n\nOver the years, Billâs son, John, died; Martyâs children remained incarcerated; and Alvinâs daughter, Marie, would vanish for months.\n\nAfter John passed away, Bill stopped attending the meetings. Why go, John was dead. But Bill missed sharing memories, and it was the only effective support he receives.\n\nOne night Bill couldnât make the six p.m. meeting. He texts Marty he will meet them at the pub; heâll have Guinnesses waiting and be sitting far away from the jukebox. The old Wurlitzer is unnaturally loud, and contains every song by Billy Joel, who grew up in nearby Hicksville. Some evenings you hear âNew York State of Mindâ and âUptown Girlâ continuously.\n\nEntering the pub, Marty and Alvin see Bill smiling with three fresh pints.\n\nâWhatâs the grin for?â Marty says. âWin the lottery?â\n\nâHope so,â Alvin says. âHe owes me forty. With interest thatâs--â\n\nâ--forty dollars,â Bill says, removing two twenties from his wallet. âHow the meeting go?â\n\nâDidnât lose anyone; thank you, Lord,â Marty says, draping his raincoat over a barstool. âLetâs drink to that. And maybe you can tell us why youâre so smiley, officer Franklin.â\n\nAfter three early Billie Joel recordings, the next song is by another Long Island artist, LL Cool J from Bay Shore. Bill remembers when âMama Said Knock You Outâ was blasting all over Manhattan.\n\nâIâm gonna knock you out.\n\nMama said, knock you out.\n\nIâm gonna knock you out.\n\nMama said, knock you out.â\n\nLL is no threat to Cole Porter or John Lennon, Bill thinks, laughing.\n\nâWoo, just a fucking minute,â Alvin says, wiping Guinness foam off his mustache. âJust a fucking minute here. Whatâs happening to our weekly pity party? Bill, you gonna tell us or keep it a mystery, like the Sphinx?â\n\nâNew medication,â Marty guesses.\n\nâSame medication,â Bill says. âBupropion, and the occasional pints and shots.â\n\nThe bartender, Phil, yells if itâs okay to switch the TV to college hoops? Villanova is playing, and he has money on âNovaâ.\n\nâSure--â\n\nâ--Go ahead.â\n\nPhil aims the remote over Alvinâs baldhead, and grunts. Saint Joeâs 72, Villanova 70, 32 seconds left.\n\nâOnly down two,â Bill says.\n\nâAnd Iâm giving seven.â Phil switches to a replay of last yearâs Australian Open.\n\nâDjokovic wins in four sets if you want to bet on it,â Alvin says.\n\nâIâd lose that too. Can I pour you gents another stout?â\n\nBill waves a finger over the glasses.\n\nâAlright,â Bill says, âso the smiling? Well, I have something special to share. Letâs sit in that booth over there.â\n\nBill tells Phil to keep the tab open and send over potato skins.\n\nPhil says, âVill-a-no-va.â\n\nSitting down, Bill reaches in a Dickâs Sporting Goods bag, removing papers secured with red rubber bands. Tapping the printed pages, he says, âSo.â\n\nâSo,â Marty says, âyou have some downloaded pages.â\n\nâTwo hundred and forty-six pages worth. Adding up to what us in law enforcement call: the probable cause. The facts, beyond a reasonable doubt, that prove guilt.â\n\nâA case youâre working on,â Marty says, âand you want to discuss it with a CPA and a social worker?â\n\nBill drains his Guinness, placing the glass precisely on the cocktail napkinâs circular stain. âI donât want to discuss it with an accountant and social worker. I want to talk it over with two friends, whoâve traveled through the same lower rings of hell, and might appreciate the information here--\"\n\n--Phil places three pints on the table and points at Alvin, who finishes his last sip. Leaving with the empty glasses, Phil says: âYour food should be out in ten. But donât hold me to that time frame.â\n\nâIn another twenty,â Bill says, âthree more Guinnesses.â\n\nâI have to drive home,â Marty says.\n\nâIâll drive you.â\n\nâA drunk driving another drunk isnât the wisest solution.â\n\nâBetter than two drunks driving,â Bill grins, tossing his badge on the table. âBesides, our get out of jail card.â\n\nâNice abuse of power, Sergeant,â Marty says. âSo about this âprobable causeâ.â\n\nâAlright,â Bill says, âyou know Johnâs story. Iâve told it so often you can recite it from memory. A great kid gets hooked on opioids. Oxycontin, then heroin, and then . . . goodnight. Two months shy of his twenty-sixth birthday. Twenty-fuckinâ-six?â\n\nâWe know Johnâs story, sadly. So where you going with--\"\n\n--Bill taps the stack of papers, and says:\n\nâWhat if I told you John did not die.â\n\nâIâd say, thatâs surprising,â Marty says. âSeeing we attended his funeral, and anniversary mass.â\n\nâI am telling you, John did not die. He didnât . . . He was murdered and for the oldest reason of all.â\n\nâAnd thatâs?â\n\nâMoney, profit. And itâs all documented here. And there are thousands of additional articles full of collaborating evidence.â\n\nAlvin and Marty glance at one another, taking long swallows of stout.\n\nMarty, the ex-Jesuit, starts with the soft tone he employs at meetings when a parent cannot endure any more pain: âBill, listen to me--donât worry, Iâm not going into scripture quoting mode--you need to let it go. Have to, buddy. Before it swallows you whole again. You donât want to end up like Jim and Sheila Sullivan, aka the Walking Dead, do you? . . . Bill, you loved your boy; we hear it every time you mention him. But heâs gone, and you need to just let it go, or youâll be following right behind John.â\n\nâKnow what, Iâd do anything to be with him.â\n\nâWe know that,â Alvin shouts. âGODDAMN it, Bill, we were having so much fun just a minute ago. I wish you wouldnât ruin my fun, cause I donât get much of it . . . Guys, I think itâs time for Jamesons. Go full Irish, whataya say?â\n\nBill says, yes; Marty declines the whiskey.\n\nâTwo Jamesons, neat,â Alvin yells to Phil.\n\nâGuys, I didnât intend to ruin our fun,â Bill says. âThe thing is, I feel better now than I have in a long time. You see, I could never make sense of John dying how he did; and how it was âa plagueâ, something natural and unavoidable. Cause everywhere I looked I saw the same pattern. Painkillers leading to heroin, and then the morgue or funeral home. And the fuckinâ numbers, no one ever saw such numbers . . . Iâve sent many away for killing one person. Guess how many this person killed?â\n\nâWhat the hell you talking about,â Marty asks.\n\nâIâm saying, one murder gets you prison. Or death row in a redneck state. But this is the worst mass murder case ever. Bundy, Gacy, all of âem combined couldnât touch--.â\n\nâ--Bill, Iâm about to send out a search party. Youâve gone completely off the reser--\"\n\nâ--Alright . . . let me put this into perspective. Alvin, you still watch those awful war documentaries with the black and white film?â\n\nâEvery night.â\n\nâAnd youâre still married. Okay, how many Americans killed in World War Two?â\n\nâU.S. casualties, four hundred and forty thou.â\n\nâAnd Vietnam?â\n\nâFifty-seven thousand, roughly. For a grand total of half a million.â\n\nâThank you. Half a million,â Bill says, âin the last big wars. Which is . . . fewer than how many died in this recent slaughter. And it wasnât an unavoidable plague. The entire opioid massacre is man-made. And the son of a bitch killed my John, and he tried killing yours too!â\n\nMarty glances behind him, hoping to see potato skins, which could alter the conversation.\n\nBill wipes his eyes with his sleeve.\n\nâChrist,â Bill says, âI cry more than most grannies. Give me a second . . . So, it was awful not knowing why, thinking something so terrible can happen for no reason. I couldnât live in a world like that.â\n\nâA major theme in the Old Testament,â Marty says.\n\nâEverythingâs a major theme in the Old Testament,â Bill says. âWhat Iâm saying is, when I found out the who and the why I stopped blaming myself. Cause it wasnât anything I did.â\n\nMarty and Alvin exchange looks, as Phil gently places two overflowing shots on the table.\n\nâHow are those potato skins coming?â Alvin asks.\n\nâCanât rush greatness.â\n\nâHow about mediocrity?â\n\nâThat too,â Phil says. âSoon as theyâre done, Iâll wait before bringing âem over. Theyâll be cold, yeah, but I don ât want you burning your mouths.â\n\nâYouâre a saint,â Marty says, wanting to keep the mindless banter going, but Phil walks off.\n\nâSo,â Alvin says, pointing at the documents, âexactly what are you talking about? Please, while weâre still middle aged.â\n\nâIf we live to a hundred and eight,â Marty mumbles.\n\nBill grabs the documents. âLetâs start with a history lesson?â\n\nâLetâs listen to Billy Joel--â\n\nâ--Opioids are terrible. Right?â\n\nâTerrible,â Alvin agrees, âfucking terrible. My beautiful daughter a prime example. And our niece another casualty.â\n\nâNo,â Bill says, ânot another casualty. Another victim.â\n\nâQuickly, Matlock, state your case,â Marty says. âI want to be out of here before the food arrives.â\n\nâAlright. Before nineteen eighty-six, opioids were only prescribed for palliative care, and stage-four cancer. Thatâs it. You werenât dying, you couldnât get them. Because?â\n\nAlvin glances at Marty. Heâll answer.\n\nâToo addictive. No matter how many rehabs and overdoses, theyâll keep using. A nightmare, it all shouldâve been locked up.â\n\nâShould have been and was,â Bill says. âIf you were about to die, enjoy. But only then. And then all this happens.â Bill digs through the papers until he comes to a page with an adhesive bookmark. âHere, read this.â\n\nBill passes the pages to Marty, pointing at the underlined passage.\n\nâI saw something about this on TV -- they didnât want Oxycontin being âa niche drugâ.â\n\nâExactly. Purdue Pharma didnât want that, cause they wanted to earn billions. But it had to remain a niche drug, because itâs so dangerous. Purdue knew that, their own research confirmed it, but they found a couple paragraphs in an obscure letter to the editor in a medical journal and based an entire business plan around it. Wasnât vetted by research. Lies in a magazine was all they needed to declare Oxycontin safe--\"\n\nâ--The government wouldnât allow that.\"\n\nâThe government?â Bill says with a moan. âIn D.C. there are three pharma lobbyists for every member of the Senate and House. Thatâs lots of dinners and favors, and theyâre the number-one source of campaign funds. Giuliani had a million dollar retainer to protect Purdue Pharma.â\n\nâThat true?â\n\nâItâs here in these papers.â\n\nâYouâd think,â Alvin says, âthe media would be all over it.â\n\nâYeah,â Bill says, âuntil you realize pharmaceutical advertising keeps most newspapers afloat, and you canât watch TV for five minutes without commercials for pills you never heard of. So with politicians unwilling to confront them, and the media dependent on pharma advertising, they were free to promote Oxycontin as the all-purpose cure.â\n\nâI was prescribed it for my ankle--â\n\nâ--Read this,â Bill says, tossing papers at his friends. âAny pain, big or small, it was the miracle cure. Sore neck from a long flight, OxyContin. Tore up your knee like my John, OxyContin. And hereâs a prescription for sixty pills, kid, and lucky you, automatic refills as a special future-junkie bonus. Always overprescribe, even if Tylenol or an ice pack is all you need. And you gotta read about the babies.â\n\nâBabies,â Marty says, âI donât want to hear it.â\n\nBill empties the Irish whiskey.\n\nâHelpless newborns. Thatâs how fuckinâ evil Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, who own the company, are. The minute the umbilical cords are cut, the withdrawals kick in. Nurses say nothingâs like the shrieks from addicted babies, howling all day. Torturing thousands of infants, because the Sacklers wanted more money. When they already had so much . . . Newborns who never did nothing to no one.â\n\nMarty lowers his head: âWelcome to the world, children--â\n\nâ--Hey,â Phil laughs from behind the bar, âkeep it down. Or Iâll have to shut you off.â\n\nâWe donât want that.â\n\nâBabies?â Alvin says quietly, âbabies?â\n\nFor a long time, the fathers are silent, watching Djokovic close out the fourth set.\n\nâCould they be any slower with the food?â Alvin says.\n\nâBad things come to he who waits.â\n\nBill stretches the rubber bands around the papers. âIâll print you copies.â\n\nâPlease.â\n\nâAnd what do you want us to do?â\n\nâRealize how little control we had over what went wrong. So you stop blaming yourselves.â\n\nâThatâd be nice . . . and Bill, what are you going to do?â\n\nBill slides the papers into the plastic bag.\n\nâWhat am I gonna do?â Bill finishes his stout. âYou know what gets me most about all this? I put people away for stealing groceries . . . cause they were starving. Howâs that? I sent a woman upstate for burning a guy with an iron who molested her niece . . . Twenty-six years on the force, I did so many fuckinâ things I shouldnât have. But how can I ignore this? . . . The . . . bastard thought itâs okay what they did to my John, and your children . . . Iâd do anything for John, and, though heâs gone, that doesnât change. Does it?â\n\nMarty glances at Alvin over his pint glass as he swallows.\n\nâNo, it doesnât,â Alvin says. âBut going after a multinational corporation? How you plan to--â\n\nâ--No. Just the one who signed off on everything. Richard Sackler, Purdue Pharmaâs CEO . . . a doctor, he knew what opioids do. Listen: when the Attorney Generals came down on Purdue, he starts hiding billons. And when he realizes theyâre in deep shit, he declares bankruptcy. Cause itâs harder getting money from a bankrupted entity. And in the end, Purdue paid some fines, but the Sacklers were allowed to keep billions more. Sure, kill half a million and return to your country clubs and mansions, and, how about this -- no admission of guilt. When I get you a copy of the papers, youâll read how the bastard said his family wasnât guilty of anything. Indignant anyone would think it. The fuck!â\n\nâSo,â Alvin asks, âyou going to pay the doctor a visit?â\n\nâNot going to . . . Did.â\n\nAlvin unconsciously grabs his empty pint.\n\nâYou stop by his office?â\n\nâNo. I borrowed a decommissioned squad car, and drove to Greenwich, Connecticut, and waited. I downloaded his license plate and car model -- a huge fucking Mercedes, thatâs how corrupt he is. A Jew driving a Benz? So I park near his estate and wait.â\n\nBilly Joelâs classical recording starts playing.\n\nâYou park on the side of the road in Greenwich,â Alvin says, âand no one bothers you? Iâd think--\"\n\nâ--Within ten minutes the Greenwich police show up. They see the uniform, I flash the badge--NYPD carries a lot of weight-- and hereâs my captainâs number if you want to call, and they say, âokayâ. Around four the Mercedes drives toward me. Doctor Sacklerâs alone, good. I follow him towards the Merritt, and in a woodsy stretch I flip on the siren and pull him over.â\n\nâHappy to see you?â\n\nâDe-lighted . . . I knock on the smug bastardâs window. He doesnât immediately respond, so I give his window a nice whack with my flashlight. Bang. He starts right in: âYou know who I amâ. . . Yeah, I know who you are. Youâre the fuck who killed my son! I have the good doctor step out andâ\"\n\n--Alvin raises a hand, stopping the monologue: âYou didnât do anything, did you?â\n\nâWhat can you do to someone who killed so many? Heâs already dead, isnât he? Marty, please some scripture support.â\n\nâLeviticus: Whoever takes a human life is surely dead.â\n\nâThere you go-- --Oh, lookee here.â\n\nPhil sets down the overcooked potato skins.\n\nâYou bake those in a kiln?â Alvin asks. âWe should get âem carbon dated.â\n\nAfter picking at the cremated appetizer, the three fathers gather their coats and step outside. The heavy rain cleaned the air, and they smell the ocean.\n\nBill approaches a Plymouth Gran Fury; the decals have been removed, but itâs unmistakably an old NYPD cruiser. Billâs uniform hangs in the back.\n\nâThey mustâve loved that in Greenwich,â Marty says. âSurprised they didnât make you park in Hartford.â\n\nBill pats the relic, gets in, and starts the car.\n\nâGood luck getting home,â Alvin yells over the misfiring engine.\n\nBill leaves the parking lot, exposing the dry, lighter-colored asphalt underneath the Plymouth.\n\nâAlvin,â Marty says, pointing, âthat oil?â\n\nIn the lighter asphalt rectangle is a new puddle of dark, reddish liquid that dripped out of the Plymouth.\n\nâOilâs darker,â Alvin says. âAnd it leaks out of the engine, not the trunk. It looks like--â\n\nâ--Transmission fluid.â\n\nMary Carrollâs front door opens and they hear âPiano Manâ.\n\nâTransmission fluid.â\n\nâMustâve had a leaky bottle of it in the trunk.â\n\nâMustâve, right?â\n\nâMustâve.â\n\nMarty pats Alvinâs shoulder. The fathers walk silently to their cars and head home."
