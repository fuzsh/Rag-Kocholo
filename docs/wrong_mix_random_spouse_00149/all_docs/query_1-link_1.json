        "text": "Supporting band of Billy Joel\n\nBilly Joel is an American singer-songwriter and pianist who has used various musicians both in studio and for live performances. The band began with the recording of his first album as a solo artist in 1971; it stabilized around 1975 and underwent several lineup changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Joel's touring band as a whole did not begin playing on his records until he recorded the album Turnstiles in 1976. This line-up included Richie Cannata on saxophones and organ, Liberty DeVitto on drums, Russell Javors and Howie Emerson on guitars, and Doug Stegmeyer on bass.[1]\n\nThe band, which now no longer includes any of its original members, is often not recognized as a formal entity, and is instead referred to simply as Billy Joel's band.[2] The Lords of 52nd Street is a band formed by the original band members that previously played with Joel.\n\nJoel's original touring band, formed in 1971 to support the Cold Spring Harbor album, comprised Rhys Clark on drums, Al Hertzberg on guitar, and Larry Russell on bass. The group toured throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico.[3]\n\nThe touring lineup changed and it took a few years for the lineup to stabilize. In an online interview, DeVitto describes how Joel's classic late 1970s-early 1980s band first came together:\n\nBilly and I used to play the same club in Plainview, Long Island, called My House. He was 17 and in a band called The Hassles and I was 16 and in a band called The New Rock Workshop. We would watch each other play and acknowledge each other in passing. In 1974, he was living in Los Angeles and had already released Piano Man and Streetlife Serenade. He used studio musicians for the recording and different guys out on the road. I was playing in a band called Topper with Doug Stegmeyer and he got the gig to play bass with Billy on the “Streetlife” tour. [Billy] told Doug that he wanted to move back to New York and find a permanent band he could record and tour with on a regular basis. Doug recommended me because Billy was looking for a New York-type drummer, aggressive and hard hitting, and the rest is history. The three of us recorded the basic tracks for Turnstiles and we both recommended Russell Javors and Howie Emerson, who played guitars in Topper and with the addition of Richie Cannata on saxophone, the “Billy Joel Band” was born.[4]\n\nBy the late 1970s, the touring and studio lineup of Joel's band stabilized and consisted, mostly, of the following musicians:\n\nLiberty DeVitto – drums, percussion\n\nDoug Stegmeyer – bass guitar, backing vocals\n\nRussell Javors – rhythm and lead guitars, harmonica, occasional percussion, backing vocals\n\nRichie Cannata – saxophones, flute, clarinet, percussion, keyboards\n\nDavid Brown – lead guitar, occasional percussion, backing vocals\n\nThis was the basic lineup for some of Joel's classic albums of the 1970s and 1980s including Turnstiles, The Stranger, 52nd Street, Glass Houses, and Songs in the Attic.\n\nIn 2014, Cannata, DeVitto, and Javors reunited and performed a short set of Joel's songs at the ceremony during which they were inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (with Stegmeyer, posthumously), primarily for their work with Joel.[5] They officially formed a band, The Lords of 52nd Street, which plays faithful renditions of the original Joel recordings.[6] David Clark of the Joel tribute band Songs in the Attic[7] plays piano and provides lead vocals, Malcolm Gold plays bass, Ken Cino plays guitar, and Doug Kistner plays keyboards in the group.[8][9]\n\nFrom The Stranger in 1977 through The Bridge in 1986, Joel had been working with the same producer, Phil Ramone, as well as with the same basic incarnation of the Billy Joel Band (with minor line-up changes over the years). Joel also added lead guitarist David Brown in 1978 who stayed with the band throughout the 1980s, beginning with the recording of Glass Houses (1980). One important addition to the band in 1982 was the replacement of his long-time saxophonist Richie Cannata with Mark Rivera.[10] But for the 1989 album Storm Front, Joel chose a new producer, Mick Jones (of the band Foreigner), and started to make more significant changes to the band.[11] At this point, the only players that Joel kept, for both his touring band and for the recording of the album, were Brown, Rivera, and DeVitto. He also added the percussionist and multi-instrumentalist Crystal Taliefero who would become a permanent fixture in his band while Stegmeyer was replaced by Schuyler Deale and Javors was replaced by Joey Hunting on the album and Tommy Byrnes for its accompanying tour.\n\nFor his last studio album, River of Dreams, in 1993, Joel used a new producer again (this time Danny Kortchmar). Although Joel continued to use DeVitto as his main drummer, he allowed Kortchmar to use different drummers for some of the drum tracks. Cannata returned to record some of the sax parts on the record but did not join Joel for the River of Dreams tour that followed.\n\nAt this point, the only remaining long-standing member of Joel's touring band was DeVitto. Joel also had Tommy Byrnes move over to lead guitar. He remains at this position and served as both a musical consultant and band member in the Movin' Out musical. Tom \"T-Bone\" Wolk joined the band, just for the River of Dreams tour, playing bass guitar, as well as other instruments, including accordion. Joel continued to retain Taliefero and Rivera who both remain in his band. The 1993 River of Dreams tour saw the addition of David Rosenthal, formerly of Rainbow, on keyboards.\n\nIn August 1995, Joel's long-time bassist Doug Stegmeyer, who had been let go from the band prior to the recording of 1989's Storm Front album, committed suicide in his Long Island home.[12] Stegmeyer had played on every one of Joel's albums from Turnstiles (1976) through to the live album, КОНЦЕРТ (1987).\n\nFor the 2006 tour, Joel did not invite DeVitto back as his drummer after the two became involved in a legal dispute, and the drummer Chuck Burgi (who played in the Broadway production of Movin' Out) replaced DeVitto. For this particular tour, Cannata temporarily returned on lead saxophones though he soon left the band again and Rivera returned to his position as lead saxophonist. In 2006, Carl Fischer joined Joel's band as his trumpeter and trombonist for select songs (most notably for the trumpet solos in the song \"Zanzibar\").\n\nOn February 27, 2010, Joel's bassist from his River of Dreams tour, Tom Wolk, died from a heart attack at the age of 58.[13]\n\nIn 2013, the Billy Joel Band was joined by multi-instrumentalist Mike DelGuidice on rhythm guitar and backing vocals. DelGuidice had previously fronted various Billy Joel tribute projects.[14]\n\nImage Name Years active Instruments Release contributions Billy Joel 1971−present\n\nlead vocals\n\npiano\n\nkeyboards\n\nharmonica\n\noccasional rhythm guitar\n\nall releases Mark Rivera 1982−present\n\nsaxophone\n\nflute\n\nclarinet\n\nvocals\n\npercussion\n\nkeyboards\n\nrhythm guitar\n\nTommy Byrnes 1989−present\n\nlead guitar (1993−present)\n\nrhythm guitar (1989−1993)\n\nbacking vocals\n\nRiver of Dreams (1993)\n\n2000 Years: The Millennium Concert (2000)\n\n12 Gardens Live (2006)\n\nLive at Shea Stadium: The Concert (2011)\n\nCrystal Taliefero\n\npercussion\n\nvocals\n\nsaxophone\n\nrhythm guitar\n\nharmonica\n\nStorm Front (1989)\n\nRiver of Dreams (1993)\n\n2000 Years: The Millennium Concert (2000)\n\n12 Gardens Live (2006)\n\nLive at Shea Stadium: The Concert (2011)\n\nDave Rosenthal 1993−present\n\nkeyboards\n\nbacking vocals\n\nmusical director\n\n2000 Years: The Millennium Concert (2000)\n\n12 Gardens Live (2006)\n\nLive at Shea Stadium: The Concert (2011)\n\nAndy Cichon 2001−present\n\nbass guitar\n\nbacking vocals\n\n12 Gardens Live (2006)\n\nLive at Shea Stadium: The Concert (2011)\n\nChuck Burgi 2006−present\n\ndrums\n\npercussion\n\nCarl Fischer\n\ntrumpet\n\nflugelhorn\n\ntrombone\n\nsaxophone\n\nclarinet\n\nMike DelGuidice 2013−present\n\nrhythm guitar\n\nvocals\n\npiano\n\nbass guitar (occasional sub)\n\nnone to date\n\nImage Name Years active Instruments Release contributions Rhys Clark 1971−1975 drums\n\nCold Spring Harbor (1971)\n\nPiano Man (1973)\n\nLive at the Great American Music Hall 1975 (2023)\n\nLarry Russell 1971−1973 bass guitar\n\nPiano Man (1973) live tracks only\n\nStreetlife Serenade (1974)\n\nAl Hertzberg 1971−1973 (died 2020) guitar Don Evans 1973−1975\n\nCold Spring Harbor (1971)\n\nStreetlife Serenade (1974)\n\nPatrick McDonald 1973−1974 bass guitar none Johnny Almond[15][16] 1974-1975 (died 2009)\n\nsaxophone\n\nkeyboards\n\nLive at the Great American Music Hall 1975 (2023) Tom Whitehorse 1974\n\nbanjo\n\npedal steel guitar\n\nStreetlife Serenade (1974) Doug Stegmeyer 1974−1987 (died 1995)\n\nbass guitar\n\nbacking vocals\n\nall releases from Turnstiles (1976) to Kontsert (1987)\n\nLive at Carnegie Hall 1977 (2019)\n\nLive at the Great American Music Hall 1975 (2023)\n\nHoward Emerson 1975−1978 lead guitar\n\nTurnstiles (1976)\n\nThe Stranger (1977) live tracks only\n\nLive at Carnegie Hall 1977 (2019)\n\nRussell Javors 1975−1987\n\nrhythm and lead guitars\n\nharmonica\n\noccasional percussion\n\nbacking vocals\n\nLiberty DeVitto 1975−2005\n\ndrums\n\npercussion\n\nall releases from Turnstiles (1976) to 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert (2000)\n\nLive at Carnegie Hall 1977 (2019)\n\nRichie Cannata\n\n1975−1981\n\n2006 (one-off guest appearance in 2000)\n\nsaxophones\n\nflute\n\nclarinet\n\npercussion\n\norgan\n\nkeyboards\n\nbacking vocals\n\nall releases from Turnstiles (1976) to River of Dreams (1993)\n\n2000 Years: The Millennium Concert (2000)\n\n12 Gardens Live (2006)\n\nLive at Carnegie Hall 1977 (2019)\n\nDavid Brown 1978−1991 (one-off guest appearances in 2000 and 2022)\n\nlead guitar\n\noccasional percussion\n\nbacking vocals\n\nall releases from 52nd Street (1978) to The Bridge (1986) David Lebolt 1982−1987 keyboards Kontsert (1987) Kevin Dukes 1987 (sub for Brown) lead guitar Schuyler Deale 1988−1993 (one-off guest appearance in 2022) bass guitar\n\nStorm Front (1989)\n\nRiver of Dreams (1993)\n\nJeff Jacobs 1988−1993\n\nkeyboards\n\nbacking vocals\n\nMindy Jostyn 1988−1990 (died 2005)\n\nbacking vocals\n\nguitar\n\nviolin\n\nkeyboards\n\nnone Tom Wolk 1993−1994 (died 2010)\n\nbass guitar\n\naccordion\n\nmandolin\n\nbacking vocals\n\nDavid Santos 1997−2000 bass guitar 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert (2000)"
