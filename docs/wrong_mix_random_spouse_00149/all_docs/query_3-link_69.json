Ever hear him perform\n\n>it lately?\n\nYes, he performed the first two verses to \"Just The Way You Are\" on\n\nSunday afternoon, January 28th, 1996. This was during his lecture\n\nstop at Trenton State College in Trenton, New Jersey, during a question\n\nand answer session with a little music.\n\nThe reason was that Billy was apparently inspired when I had the\n\nopportunity to ask him a question pertaining to the interpretations\n\nof that song. I told him and the audience that, because I am\n\nphysically challenged, my interpretations of JTWYA are a little\n\nbit broader, to accept others for who they are inside. Billy\n\nconfirmed this interpretation by saying that he wrote the song\n\nbecause we all want to be accepted for who we are. A newspaper\n\narticle confirms this statement from Billy.\n\nPaul\n\n--\n\n\"What will it take until you believe in me, the way that I believe in you?\"\n\n-- Billy Joel, \"Just The Way You Are\" (1977)\n\nYes, Billy's first wife, Elizabeth Weber(maiden name) Small (first\n\nhusband's last name) Joel(second husband's last name) [I don't know her\n\nlast name now] was indeed Billy's manager for a period of time. I\n\nthink from around 1975-1980. Then her brother Frank Weber became\n\nBilly's manager. But you are right as far as I know that the Charlie\n\nreferred to in \"Great Wall of China\" is Frank. He just changed the\n\nname. Perhaps in reference to On the Water Front with Marlon Brando\n\nbecause in the movie he says something similar to \"you could have had\n\nclass, you could have been a contender Charlie.\"\n\nI don't know what ever happened to Elizabeth or Billy's step-son, Sean,\n\nbut if anyone out there has any clue as to whatever became of these two\n\nit would be interesting to know.\n\n> No, Billy's manager was not his first wife, but his first wife's\n\n>BROTHER, Charlie.

She made him much more successful than he\n\nwas. However, she also linked Billy with her brother who than, according\n\nto Billy, ripped him off big time and the whole thing went to court."
