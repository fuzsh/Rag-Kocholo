        "text": "Billy Joel married girlfriend Alexis Roderick in a surprise ceremony at the couple's annual Fourth of July party.\n\n(In)famous music critic Robert Christgau on how to rile up rock stars\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo presided over Saturday's nuptials at Joel's Long Island estate, the singer's spokeswoman Claire Mercuri said. The small group of family and friends at the party didn't know the couple planned to exchange vows. Among those in attendance were Alexa Ray Joel, his daughter with his second wife, model Christie Brinkley, and actor Kevin James.\n\nPeople magazine first reported the wedding.\n\nJoel, 66, and Roderick, 34, have been dating since 2009 and are expecting their first child. This is his fourth marriage.\n\nBrinkley's backhanded congrats?\n\nBrinkley, who was married to Joel from 1985 to 1994, offered her congratulations to the newlyweds on Instagram.\n\nWhether she meant to or not, Brinkley's message appears to underscore the 32-year age difference between Joel and his new bride.\n\n\"Congratulation to the glowing bride and groom,\" wrote Brinkley. \"And to my daughter Alexa, who has a wonderful friend in Alexis!\"\n\nJoel is currently on tour. On Wednesday, he set a record for most performances by a single artist at Madison Square Garden with his 65th show, besting Elton John."
