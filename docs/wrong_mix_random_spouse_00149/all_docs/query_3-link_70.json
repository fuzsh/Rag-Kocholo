        "text": "Billy Joel hopes that this marriage is FOURTH time lucky\n\nBilly Joel is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with over 150 million records sold worldwide and six Grammy Awards to his name.\n\nThroughout his impressive decades-long career, the Piano Man has performed on the Grammys' stage a couple of times.\n\nHowever, the singer-songwriter is scheduled to perform during music's most important night for the first time in more than 20 years on Feb. 4.\n\nAhead of his performance, it's worth revisiting his impressive career spanning over four decades, but also his high-profile relationships.\n\nJoel has been married to some famous women, and some of them have inspired him to write some of his hit songs, but here's a deeper look into his dating and relationship history.\n\nRead more: Billy Joel tickets: Last chance to get tickets to Billy Joel's only UK show today\n\nJoel's first wife was Elizabeth Weber.\n\nHis songs Just the Way You Are, She’s Got a Way and She’s Always a Woman are thought to be inspired by her.\n\nThe pair met in 1970 through the artist's friend and bandmate Jon Small, who was married to Weber at the time.\n\nAfter they started an affair, Small found out and Weber ended up leaving them both.\n\nJoel and Weber later got back together and married in 1973.\n\nYears later the pair had a nasty divorce in 1982, with Weber’s brother accused of stealing millions from Joel.\n\nThe Piano Man's next wife was model Christie Brinkley, who is said to have inspired This Is the Time and the entire album An Innocent Man.\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\n'Piano Man's back in the groove': Billy Joel The Vinyl Collection Vol 2 review - [REPORT]\n\nBilly Joel BST Hyde Park review: The Piano Man is still the great Entertainer - [INSIGHT]\n\nThe Piano Man put New York fans in a Billy Joel state of mind - [LATEST]\n\nAfter divorcing Weber, the singer went to St. Bart's where he started playing at a piano bar and met supermodels Elle MacPherson, Christie Brinkley and singer Whitney Houston.\n\nJoel, who was 33 at the time, returned home to find MacPherson, 19, and Brinkley, 28, were both after his affections.\n\nHe briefly dated MacPherson, but it was Brinkley who he later married in 1985.\n\nThey welcomed daughter, Alexa Ray Joel, the same year, but the pair split nine years later, divorcing in 1994.\n\nWhile Brinkley famously appeared in the music video for his hit Uptown Girl, the song was actually about her, MacPherson, and other models.\n\nAccording to reports (per Smooth Radio), the song was originally called Uptown Girls.\n\nAfter taking a break from marriage and relationships, Joel began a relationship with culinary professional and Food Network star Katie Lee.\n\nAt the time, Billy was 55 and Katie was 23, and the pair married in 2004.\n\nTheir marriage ended five years later in 2009.\n\nThe couple released a statement claiming they were \"caring friends\" and a spokesperson denied a third party was involved in the break-down of their relationship (per the Daily Mail).\n\nSources at the time said the 33-year gap finally took its toll. \"It was really the age difference that caught up with them,\" a friend of the couple told New York's Daily News.\n\n\"They grew apart. She is very career-oriented. She loves going out. She loves the city. When Billy isn't touring, he'd rather be on Long Island with his motorcycles and boats.\"\n\nJoel is currently married to 39-year-old Alexis Roderick, is a former executive at Morgan Stanley who now works as an equestrian.\n\nThe pair met in 2009 and tied the knot in 2015.\n\nThe couple have two daughters together; Della Rose Joel and Remy Anne Joel.\n\nHe seems to be content in his fourth marriage as he continues to perform around the world, celebrating his music.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
