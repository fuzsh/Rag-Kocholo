Bert has worked hard to take over the family farm and runs it on his own. He now wants someone with whom to share it. His ideal partner is funny, outgoing, adventurous, understands the long hours of his work, can banter and gets along with everyone, especially his nanna, whose disapproval could be a dealbreaker.\n\nTell us what makes you unique?\n\nI am a fourth-generation pineapple farmer and a third generation Bert.\n\nWhat are your interests?\n\nI like riding motorbikes, travelling and anything related to the ocean.

It’s his dream to bring the farm back to its full potential. Joe is a passionate rugby player and loves horses, fishing and travel. A bit of a social butterfly, his charming smile and playful, cheeky personality are infectious. Family is everything to Joe; he will cancel personal plans to make time for them, which is one of the qualities he’s looking for in his future wife. He is extremely close to his mother, who he cared for during her breast cancer battle three years ago.\n\nWhat makes you unique?\n\nI’ve been lucky enough to travel and experience a bit of the world through various rugby league opportunities. I’ve shaken our late Queen’s hand when my grandma was awarded the Australian of the Year award. My mum and Madonna were born on the same day, in the same year, and I’ve proudly inherited the “Madonna gap” in my teeth to keep the legacy going.\n\nWhat are your interests?\n\nTravelling, working with horses and breaking them in, footy, fishing, fourwheel driving and wild camping.\n\nName – Sarah\n\nAge – 31\n\nState – New South Wales\n\nOccupation – Livestock administrator\n\n“I hope that I can find love and my happily ever after.”\n\nName – Jen\n\nAge – 34\n\nState – New South Wales\n\nOccupation – Equine vet\n\n“I want to know every bit of him and share every bit of me so we can love each other just right.”\n\nName – Alice\n\nAge – 32\n\nState – New South Wales\n\nOccupation – Executive assistant\n\n“I’d normally go for a suit, but I live and work in the Eastern suburbs bubble and I’m looking for a change.”\n\nName – Taylah\n\nAge – 28\n\nState – Queensland\n\nOccupation – Hairdresser\n\n“I feel like I’m really deserving of love.

So, it’s been a long\n\n30 years.”\n\nFarmer Dustin\n\n26 | Cattle, sheep, goats and crop farmer | Condobolin, New South Wales\n\nThird-generation farmer Dustin feels a huge sense of responsibility to continue the family legacy. He has a heart of gold, is cheeky and loves to “take the mickey”. Dustin describes himself as a “girlfriend guy” whose ideal partner is happy, fun-loving, thick-skinned and has a good sense of humour. He comes from a tight knit family, so it’s very important that his partner gets along with the family. He wants to be married with kids by the time he turns 30.\n\nWhat are your interests?\n\nI love fishing, cooking, farming, cricket and my dogs, Flick and Sam. I enjoy being outdoors, travelling and spending time with my mates. I really love trying new things.\n\nWhat values are you looking for in a partner?\n\nThey must be family oriented. My family is really important to me, so I’m looking for someone who understands that.\n\nWhat is really important to you in a relationship?\n\nGood communication, loyalty, positivity, resilience and a good attitude.
