        "text": "Christie Brinkley is still Billy Joel’s muse nearly 30 years after their split.\n\nThe “Vienna” singer, 74, serenaded his ex-wife during his New York City concert at Madison Square Garden Friday night.\n\nThe former supermodel was all smiles while Joel sang “Uptown Girl,” which he wrote about her at the start of their romance in the early ’80s, in front of nearly 20,000 fans.\n\nCameras captured Brinkley dancing and singing along to the smash hit on the Jumbotron for nearly the entirety of the song, according to a video posted to TikTok.\n\nThe 70-year-old model looked radiant in a low-cut, metallic blue top as she swayed back and forth alongside a friend.\n\n“Billy Joel wrote ‘Uptown Girl’ about his then-partner Christie Binkley,” the user wrote atop the clip. “Tonight she watched him sing the song he wrote about her to all of Madison Square Garden.”\n\nIn the caption, the user added, “40 years later and your ex man is still grinning at you like that while he sings the song he wrote about how rich and hot you are?”\n\nThe pair met in 1983 while Joel was already working on “Uptown Girl,” which was originally about several women, including one-time girlfriend Elle Macpherson.\n\n“Rather than it [being] about all these different girls, she became the Uptown Girl. I started writing it about one person,” he told Howard Stern in 2010.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nBrinkley went on to star in the “Uptown Girl” music video and the pair wed in 1985. They welcomed their daughter, Alexa Ray, less than a year later.\n\nAlthough the “Piano Man” singer and the supermodel split nine years later, they have remained good friends for the sake of their daughter.\n\nIn fact, the now 38-year-old joined her parents at the concert on Friday night, taking to the stage to perform a song dedicated to her dad.\n\n“I’m gonna try not to get all verklempt,” she told the crowd. “This song is a song that my father introduced to me when I was a little girl and it’s a real classic, throwback moment. And I feel like its the kind of song that one should sing to their hero… and you are my hero dad.”\n\nAlexa, dressed in a retro pink outfit, then did her best rendition of “To Sir With Love” as her father proudly watched from his piano bench.\n\nAfter finishing the song, the noticeably emotional singer hugged his daughter before she walked off stage."
