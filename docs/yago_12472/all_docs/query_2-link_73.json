        "text": "When Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt isn’t busy helping organize one of the NFL’s most beloved teams, he’s raising his three children alongside his wife Tavia Shackles Hunt.\n\nThe Chiefs CEO married Tavia in 1993, and the pair have since welcomed three children: Gracie, Knovel and Ava. Their daughters, Gracie and Ava, were born on the same day six years apart, 1999 and 2005, respectively, while their son, Knobel, was born in 2002.\n\n“I would say we are very, very close, and I mean we talk every day if we don’t see each other every single day,” Tavia told KSHB in September 2022. “I just think our faith, our values and our deep love for each other.”\n\nWhile Gracie has followed in her mom’s footsteps as a pageant queen, Knobel and Ava have lived more out of the public eye while attending and starting college, respectively.\n\nFrom their respective sports (spoiler: no football!) to their commitment to their father’s alma mater, here’s everything to know about Clark Hunt’s kids.\n\nGracie Hunt, 25\n\nGracie was born on March 29, 1999, in Dallas. Like her mother, Gracie grew up to become a pageant queen, winning Miss Texas Teen International in 2016 and 2018 and Miss Kansas USA in 2021.\n\n\"She tells me, 'Just be you. You are enough,' \" Gracie told PEOPLE (the TV Show!) in a 2021 episode on advice she’s gotten from her mother, who was Miss Missouri Teen USA in 1990 and Miss Kansas USA in 1993. \"It's really nice to get to walk down a road with someone who has been down that path before. It really has just bonded us so much.\"\n\nThough she grew up in a football family — Clark inherited the Chiefs from his father, Larry Hunt — she had a passion for soccer growing up. She played the sport throughout high school and planned to continue in college until four concussions stopped her career.\n\nWhile she inherited an affinity for pageantry from her mother, soccer was a skill that actually came from her father, who played the sport for Southern Methodist University.\n\n“Soccer helped build my relationship with my dad. He was my first coach when I was little and those are sweet memories I’ll always cherish,” she told Maxim in 2023.\n\nGracie continued in her father’s footsteps when she became a student at SMU herself where she studied sports management and broadcast journalism. After graduating, Gracie chose to continue her education with a master’s degree from the University of Kansas.\n\nNow, she works alongside her father, helping the Chiefs with marketing and brand development.\n\n“I love working in sports and I see myself being involved in one capacity or another throughout my life, but I have also loved getting to pursue my own ventures and see where that takes me,” she said in a 2023 Q&A with Interview Magazine.\n\nAs the daughter of the Chiefs owner, Gracie has befriended some high-profile celebrities, including Taylor Swift, who has been dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce since 2023.\n\n“Happy birthday to this queen!💖 Bright, beautiful, beyond talented and engaging…easiest decision Time Magazine ever made for Person of the Year,” Gracie wrote in a birthday tribute for Swift in December 2023. “Hope it’s your best & most blessed year yet!🫶🏼.”\n\nKnobel Hunt, 22\n\nClark and Tavia’s only son, Knobel, was born on July 15, 2002, in Dallas.
