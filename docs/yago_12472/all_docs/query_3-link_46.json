        "text": "The Young and the Restless (Y&R) spoilers document that Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) had a sit-down with his daughter’s newest love interest. But disaster happened the last time Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle) crossed business with romance at Newman-Locke.\n\nThe Locke add-on to Newman represents the dead man Billy Abbott (Jason Thompson) said he would not mention when speaking with his longtime, but not current, muse at Crimson Lights. Victoria shrugged off Billy’s partially snarky comments and told him that the upbeat demeanor she sported was linked to her new man, Nate Hastings (Sean Dominic).\n\nThe Young And The Restless Spoilers – Ashland Locke Is Long Gone\n\nAshland Locke (Richard Burgi and Robert Newman) was wronged by his wife, who had a child with Kyle Abbott (Michael Mealor) and led the character Burgi and Newman played to believe otherwise. But that is not what drove him mad.\n\nInstead, the dynamic between Victoria and Ashland was off from the beginning. Eventually, he snapped and was seemingly going to kill her before Nick Newman (Joshua Morrow) intervened and saved the soapy day. Nick and Victoria’s reward had the authorities unable to prove who erased the Lockeness Monster.\n\nEnough time has passed, with various references to Ashland having that storyline seem like it was a while ago. With whatever time has passed, Nate is not a rebound. He is a new pursuit but one that does have a similar business complication.\n\nThe Young And The Restless Updates – Nate Hastings’ Backstory Is Meaningful\n\nVictor has known Nate since he was born. The character Dominic plays nicely ties to two of its legacy characters, Olivia Winters (Tonya Lee Williams), and the late Nathan Hastings (last played by Adam Lazzare-White).\n\nDevoted viewers recall the fateful scene when a then-young Nate witnessed his father killed by a car in the street outside their home. Nathan’s personal issues led to his split from Olivia and her coupling with Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore).\n\nIt would be great if Williams would return to the show in honor of Y&R’s fiftieth-anniversary celebration. While the coupling with Victoria can become uplifting, Nate could use his mother’s advice, as he has gone off-track within the last year.\n\nVictor Newman Remains Cautious\n\nVictoria met with Nate at Society. But he did not grill him, as Nate and later Victoria thought he might.\n\nBraeden’s character is protective of his creations, which include his family and the fabled Newman Enterprises. Nate’s role atop Newman Media and his place aside from Victoria elevates him to two levels of Victoria’s radar.\n\nThe Moustache likes and respects Nate. But he will remain cautious to see how Victoria’s newest romantic relationship evolves and if it affects the bottom line of Y&R."
