While I‚Äôm excited about what's to come, I am sad to be saying goodbye to this company and my Evercor family. As far as jobs go, this was truly one of the best. My experience at Evercor gave me the confidence and skills to start a new venture, which I will be posting about soon and I promise you düç©nut want to miss it! Until then I'll just say this: Thank you, #TeamEvercor, for all that you have done for me. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
