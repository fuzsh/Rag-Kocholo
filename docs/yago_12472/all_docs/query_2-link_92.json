        "text": "Mary Beth (Williams) Peterson, born in Grand Forks, ND, on September 29, 1948, to Adele (Harris) and Kenneth Williams, passed away peacefully at her home in Denver, CO, on August 2, 2024, surrounded by her beloved family, after a courageous battle with cancer.\n\nMary Beth’s early years were spent in Grand Forks, where she graduated from Grand Forks Central High School in 1966. She went on to the University of North Dakota, where she was a member of the first class in physical therapy, graduating in 1970. During her freshman chemistry class she met Ron Peterson, the love of her life. They married on December 22, 1970, at Wesley United Methodist Church in Grand Forks.\n\nTheir journey began with Ron’s service in the Air Force, which took them to Biloxi, MS; San Angelo, TX; RAF Chicksands, England; and finally, to Caribou, ME, where, in 1976, they welcomed their first child, Carolyn.\n\nAfter leaving the Air Force in 1977, the family returned to Grand Forks, where Mary Beth began working at the Rehab Hospital while Ron pursued his accounting degree. In 1979, the family settled in north Fargo where they lived for 37 years. In 1982, their second child, Kathryn (Katie) was born. Mary Beth served as a physical therapist at St. Luke’s Hospital/MeritCare for 30 years, until her retirement in 2009. She was an active member of Faith United Methodist Church. As a certified master gardener, she found joy in tending flower gardens at the church, at NDSU, and in her own backyard. After long and fulfilling careers, Mary Beth and Ron moved to Denver, CO, in pursuit of the mountains, milder winters, and to be closer to Katie and her family.\n\nMary Beth’s other favorite pastimes included reading, baking delicious from scratch apple pies, making decorated sugar cookies with her granddaughters, and making beautiful quilts for her family. She was a dedicated member of P.E.O. Chapter V in Fargo and of P.E.O. Chapter CF in Denver, where she found many lasting friendships. She was a member of Littleton United Methodist Church.\n\nMary Beth’s family was her greatest pride and joy. She was a devoted wife to her husband Ron, a loving mother to daughters Carolyn (Peterson) Tomeo and Katie (Peterson) Fair, and a cherished grandmother to Molly Tomeo and Olivia Fair. Her kindness, grace, and selflessness were evident to all who knew her. Friends and family would describe her as compassionate, encouraging, and deeply faithful and faith filled.\n\nMary Beth is survived by her husband Ron; daughters Carolyn (Damon Tomeo) and Katie (Andrew Fair); granddaughters Molly and Olivia; sister Patricia (Pat) Jones and brother-in-law Bill Jones; her dear aunt Lorna Marifjeren; and sister-in-law Bonnie Peterson; as well as many aunts, cousins, nieces, and nephews. She was preceded in death by her parents, parents-in-law, and grandparents as well as her dear uncle Lee Harris and brothers-in-law Larry and Phil Peterson.\n\nIn keeping with her wishes, there will be no formal services. A celebration of her life will be held in Denver at a later date. The Peterson family deeply appreciates the outpouring of love and support received, especially in the final months of Mary Beth’s life. In lieu of flowers, the family requests memorial donations be made to your local P.E.O. chapter, church, or other charitable organizations.\n\nCondolences and memories may be shared at CaringBridge."
