(Thad Luckinbill).\n\nThe character of Nate was last played in 2011 by Walter Fauntleroy.\n\nSo, what do you think is wrong with Victor? Glad to hear Nate Hastings will be back on the canvas?

The longtime TV talk show host died on Sunday night, August 18th after a long illness his family shared. He was 88-years old.\n\nMarlo Thomas, Donahue’s wife for more than 44 years, along with his sister, children, grandchildren and his beloved golden retriever, Charlies surrounded him as he passed on. The news of his death was confirmed by Today on Monday.\n\nIt was just three months ago in May, that Donahue received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Joe Biden.\n\nPhil’s success truly began when the issue-oriented The Phil Donahue Show was picked up for national syndication in 1969, then was renamed Donahue in 1974. Soon, more than 200 stations carried his show. The talk show continued on until 1996, when the daytime talkshow landscape changed to the Jerry Springer and Sally Jesse Raphael’s of it all. In addition, Oprah Winfrey and her success was taking away his female audience.\n\nDuring his run, segments of Donahue were also broadcast three times a week on NBC’s Today, and he joined the staff as a regular interviewer. He also hosted NBC primetime specials, including the Emmy-winning Donahue and Kids and the five-part Phil Donahue Examines the Human Animal.\n\nLater in 2002-03, Donahue briefly returned to television with a self-titled MSNBC talk show in which he interviewed newsmakers on social and political issues.\n\nIn his career, Phil would win 10 Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Host and 10 for Outstanding Talk Show, and the show would capture 200 Emmys during its run.\n\nWhen Donahue called it quits at the age of 60, Oprah Winfrey presented him with a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement honor in 1996, and shared, “I want to thank you for opening the door so wide, wide enough for me to walk through. Had there not been a Phil Donahue, I don’t believe there could have been an Oprah.”\n\nAfter receiving his Lifetime Achievement Daytime Emmy, Phil, in turn, shared, “Having to go in there every day and jump out of a cake and make sure you have a nice crisp clean shirt and all that, it was wonderful while it lasted, but I think we chose the right time to walk. I’ve never regretted it.”\n\nThe family requested that donations be made to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital or the Phil Donahue/Notre Dame Scholarship Fund in lieu of flowers.\n\nSurvivors include Donahue’s second wife, Marlo Thomas, whom he married in 1980; and his five children from his first marriage.\n\nShare your remembrances and condolences on the passing of Phil Donahue via the comment section below.\n\nBreaking News\n\nJohn Aprea, ‘Another World’ and ‘Knots Landing’ Actor, Dead at 83\n\nBy\n\nJohn Aprea, best-known to soap fans for his role as Lucas (Luke) Castigliano on Another World, has died at the age of 83.\n\nHis manager confirmed his death, which happened earlier this month on August 7th according to TMZ, and August 5th according to the Hollywood Reporter. The motion picture and television actor passed away of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles surrounded by loved ones.\n\nAnother World fans will recall that Aprea played two roles on the soap: Luke from 1989 to 1993, and Alexander Nikos from May 1997 to January 1998. Lucas was one of the loves of Felicia Gallant’s (Linda Dano) life, and they shared a daughter that was put up for adoption, Lorna Devon played by Alicia Coppola.\n\nMore recently, and in an ironic twist, Aprea appeared on the streaming series The Bay in seasons 6 and 7, which like Another World, is set in a town called “Bay City.” On The Bay, John played the role of the town’s former mayor, Jack Madison.\n\nThe Bay’s showrunner, Gregori J, Martin shared, “It was such a great honor to have the privilege of working with an icon like John on The Bay. I have always been a fan of his work and he was a true gentleman and absolute pro who brought some beautiful moments to the role of Jack in these later seasons. We will all miss him dearly.”\n\nKnots Landing fans will remember Aprea from his turn as bad guy Manny Vasquez.
