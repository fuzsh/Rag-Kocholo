        "text": "November 1998\n\nFollowing October '98, another great month. Alice discovers the file she's been looking for and begins searching for 'Sharon Collins.' Millie is desperate to warn Christine but collapses before she gets the chance. Meanwhile, Diane and Brad's sexy flirtation continues, while Christine travels to see 'Jim' and Ruth. Victoria Newman is hospitalized and, before long, her appendix ruptures, threatening to kill both her and her baby. Victoria is rushed into emergency surgery. Katherine calls Jill with the news that she has a new attorney -- Michael Baldwin. John Silva nearly sh!ts himself when he hears the news. Sharon confronts Nick about sleeping with Grace. She wants to move out but Nick offers to be the one to go. Tony confronts Grace and breaks off their second engagement. He and Megan become closer. Paul has noticed Christine's bizarre behavior, so of course he assumes she's cheating. He follows her to Jim and Ruth's and barges in... only to see his very much alive dad in front of him! As if that weren't a big enough shock, Jim/Carl wants nothing to do with Paul, whom he doesn't remember. Davidson does some amazing work here. Malcolm goes to Detroit to speak to Trey and the issues he and Olivia have been facing now become a chasm. Phyllis and Jack have sex but Phyllis wouldn't be Phyllis if she didn't have more going on: She assures Victor that she can spy on Michael for him -- if only she can convince him to get over the fact that she had him kidnapped! In one of my all-time favorite Y&R moments, Cole carries his ex-wife to see their baby daughter, Eve. Victoria sees her alive only once and, shortly after, learns that she died.\n\n*This month's ranking was compiled via full episodes, partial episodes, and filling-in the blanks with recaps.
