If you have a mental health emergency, call 988 or 911. Or click here for more Crisis Resources\n\nTelephone Contact\n\nYou can call Shine a Light at 831-996-1222, but we encourage you to use the email forms to the left. If you call, please leave the following:\n\nPhone number\n\nPreferred location\n\nBest times to meet\n\nIssue you want help with\n\nWhat insurance you have (if any)\n\nFAX us at: 831-417-0443\n\nGood Faith Estimate\n\nYou have the right to receive a “Good Faith Estimate” explaining how much your medical care will cost. Your fee will be set according to a sliding scale, in collaboration with your therapist, prior to your first counseling session. Total costs depend upon the number of sessions you choose to utilize.\n\nIf you have private health insurance, please be aware that your costs for therapy may be less by using an in-network provider for your insurance company. This will depend upon your plan's deductible amounts and co-payments. In some cases, counseling at Shine a Light is less costly than using private insurance.\n\nIf you hope to use \"out of network\" benefits through your private insurance, please be aware that many plans will not reimburse for services provided by pre-licensed therapists (most of our staff).\n\nClick here to download a flyer for\n\nShine a Light Counseling Center"
