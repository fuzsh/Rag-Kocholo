        "text": "Ever since I read The Poet X by Elizabeth Acevedo early in first semester, I was excited to read it with my 9th graders. The main character, Xiomara, reflects a lot of the identities that young high schoolers have. She is in tenth grade, dealing with ups and downs in her relationship with her parents due to the expectations they have of her. She is navigating her first romantic relationship, as well as shifts in her friendships with her best friend Caridad and her twin brother, Xavier, who is coming to terms with his sexuality in the story. She uses poetry to express herself, music to escape, and finds a safe haven in Ms. Galiano’s English class. Since the Romeo and Juliet unit ended with a focus on the importance of positive mentors in young peoples’ lives, this was a great entry point for The Poet X that linked it to Romeo and Juliet, and allowed for the unit to expand into a fascinating exploration of identity and creative expression through poetry."
