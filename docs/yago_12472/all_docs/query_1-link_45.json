        "text": "Quick — name a transformative black television character.\n\nJames Evans. Cliff Huxtable. Olivia Pope. Cookie Lyon. Annalise Keating.\n\nNeil Winters.\n\nYou only paused if you did not grow up, as I did, watching “The Young and the Restless.”\n\nKristoff St. John, who died this week at 52, originated the role of Neil Winters on “Y & R” — as it is commonly referred to by its fans — in 1991 and played it up until his death. With 28 years in the show’s fictional Genoa City, St. John was the second-longest-serving black soap opera actor, behind James Reynolds of “Days of Our Lives.”\n\n[Read our obituary of Kristoff St. John, who played Neil Winters.]\n\nBlack men like Neil have been hard to come by on television. He was a young, up-and-coming executive at Newman Enterprises, fresh out of Stanford. He was self-assured without being arrogant, and down-to-earth without being a caricature or a clown. He was ambitious, he loved his friends, and he got along well with all of those veteran, high-flying executive types.\n\nHis obvious romantic interest was Olivia — doctor, sorority sister, beautiful. His longtime love, though, turned out to be Drucilla (Victoria Rowell), Olivia’s outspoken sister, who was also lovely but decidedly rougher around the edges. Drucilla was Cookie Lyon, minus the prison stint, before there was a Cookie Lyon.\n\nI was groomed to care — our mother raised my brother and me while CBS soap operas played in the background. I knew about the Spauldings and the Bauers on “Guiding Light” long before I knew most of my classmates’ names at school.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
