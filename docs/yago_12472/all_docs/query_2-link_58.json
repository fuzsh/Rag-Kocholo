        "text": "LAS VEGAS (KVVU/Gray News) - A young girl suffered a head injury and was sent to the hospital after she was kicked by a wild horse at a popular hiking area outside of Las Vegas.\n\nHaley Wilkey says her family, including four children, were visiting Mount Charleston over the weekend when her 3-year-old daughter Olivia was hit by the horse.\n\n“I thought she had died because she was unresponsive,” Wilkey said.\n\nThe family was in the Lee Meadows area to do a photo shoot for another family when two wild horses appeared and calmly walked near some people holding a picnic.\n\nAccording to Wilkey, people started to approach the horses and one of the animals then closed in on her daughter Olivia and kicked her in the head.\n\nWilkey screamed for her husband, who rushed over. He ended up driving down the mountain, due to a lack of cell service, to call for help.\n\nThe mother’s screams also attracted another man to the scene, someone the family did not know.\n\n“He had a first aid kit. He gave me gauze, and helped me put pressure on her head until the bleeding slowed a little,” Wilkey said.\n\nBoth the man and Wilkey used their hands to keep the pressure on the bleeding wound.\n\n“If we let up a little bit of pressure, it would just start flowing again,” she said. “It was like, I think, almost 45 minutes of holding her head shut waiting for the ambulance to come.”\n\nAn ambulance picked up the little girl, and a helicopter flew her to the hospital.\n\n“They saved her life,” Olivia’s father Austin Wilkey said.\n\nThe family says scans at the hospital showed no brain issues, and Olivia was sitting up in bed and talking on Tuesday evening before being able to leave on Wednesday.\n\nThe family did not get the phone number of the bystander who helped but wanted to thank him for his help.\n\n“I wish I got his phone number. I actually hugged him. I said thank you so much. You saved my daughter,” Austin Wilkey said.\n\nHaley Wilkey added, “Just thank you. I have no words to express how grateful I am, thank you.”\n\nOlivia’s mother said in hindsight they were too close to the horse at the time and knowing what she knows now, they wouldn’t even be in the meadow with horses around."
