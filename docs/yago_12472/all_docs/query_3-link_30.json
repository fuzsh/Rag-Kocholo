        "text": "\"The Young and the Restless\" is a soap opera focusing on the lives and conflicts between families in fictional Genoa City.\n\nOne notable character is the trained physician Nathan Oliver Hastings Jr., who first appeared on the show as an infant in 1992 and has been played by Sean Dominic since 2019.\n\nNate Jr. was born to Nathan Hastings and Olivia Winters, although his mother had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and advised to have an abortion to save her life.\n\nNate Jr. was born early, and Olivia survived but wanted full custody as Nathan had committed adultery, prompting him to kidnap their son.\n\nNathan decided to return Nate Jr. to his mother, only to die in a car accident before he could. Olivia married Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore) but divorced after his infidelity.\n\nWhen her health declined, Olivia changed her will to assign Malcolm's custodial rights to his brother, Neil Winters.\n\nOlivia cheated death once more but continued to have conflicts about custody and access with Malcolm, who later disappeared on a trip to Kenya.\n\nOlivia hasn't been on the show since 2012, and the character of Neil Winters suffered a fatal stroke in 2019 when the actor who played him, Kristoff St. John, tragically died.\n\nShemar Moore Set To Make Big Return To The Young And The Restless\n\nThe Real-Life Partners Of The Young And The Restless Cast"
