        "text": "Cassidy was a member of Law & Order: SVU's debut cast, appearing in the pilot episode (\"Payback\") and throughout Season 1.\n\nIt was during this era that Cassidy and Benson had a one-night stand and, while they would later explore a serious relationship, she kept her focus on work. He openly wanted more from her, but Benson turned him down because they worked together.\n\nRELATED: All the Law & Order: SVU Detectives Through the Years\n\nDespite being the squad's class clown, Cassidy soon established himself as a dedicated and earnest detective. His lack of experience on the force inspired his pair-up with the seasoned veteran of the squad, Detective John Munch (Richard Belzer).\n\nCassidy was valuable in several cases but often struggled to cope with the grueling nature of sex crimes, especially those involving minors.\n\nRELATED: Dann Florek Tears Up Talking About Mariska Hargitay\n\nDespite Cassidy having a hand in several arrests in SVU's first season, former Captain Donald Cragen (Dann Florek) quickly clocked his incompatibility for the role. He then assigned Cassidy a simple task: Go check on one of the assault survivors.\n\nAfter realizing he lacked the stomach to handle the day-to-day testimonies of the victims whose cases he was investigating, Cassidy transferred to NYPD's Narcotics Division in Season 1, Episode 13 (\"Disrobed\").\n\nWinters first reprised his role as Cassidy in the Season 13 finale (\"Rhodium Nights\").\n\nDuring his time away from the SVU, Cassidy had soared through the ranks of the NYPD, eventually becoming an undercover detective. While investigating a pimp, Benson and her then-partner Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) crossed paths with Cassidy, who had been working undercover for three years disguised as the pimp's bodyguard. His case became entangled with the SVU's investigation.\n\nBenson learned in the course of their shared investigation that Cassidy had matured tremendously in his time away from the squad, and had become more confident as an investigator.\n\nCassidy remained part of the show through Season 14 and Season 15, as he and Benson got a second chance at romance.\n\nThe two detectives became involved in a serious relationship in Season 14, following their Season 1 one-night stand.\n\nIn Season 14 Episode 2 (\"Above Suspicion\"), Cassidy's cover as the pimp's bodyguard was blown and he got shot.\n\nHe was seriously wounded and rushed to the hospital while Amaro and Benson cleaned up the mess. When Cassidy awoke in the hospital, Benson was there to greet him, telling him she wasn't the same person she was the first time they worked together.\n\nShe then kissed him.\n\nRELATED: The Best Law & Order: SVU Episodes Fans Never Forget\n\nTheir romance were confirmed in Season 14, Episode 3 (\"Undercover Blue\"), albeit in less-than-ideal circumstances after Munch and Amaro arrived at Cassidy's apartment to inform him that he had been accused of a sexual assault.\n\nThe accuser was a sex worker with whom Cassidy used to have a consensual relationship during his time undercover. While her colleagues were delivering the news, Benson walked out of Cassidy's bedroom in a nightshirt.\n\nThe accusations complicated their romance, but the charges were dropped after it came to light that the woman had made a false accusation in order to sue the NYPD. Still, as a result of the consensual relationship, Cassidy was demoted.\n\nDespite the demotion, he and Benson continued their relationship, dating throughout Season 14 and Season 15.\n\nAfter Benson was traumatically kidnapped and tortured by the serial killer William Lewis (Pablo Schreiber) in Season 14, it was Cassidy who became her shoulder to cry on.\n\nIn Season 15 of SVU, the couple moved in together.\n\nAfter Cassidy and Benson because a couple, their compatibility remained in question. She was a meticulous planner, never running into the action without thinking of the situation from all angles. On the other hand, he was impulsive and short-sighted. Their differences caused tension for the couple at several points during their relationship, especially when the topic of their futures came up.\n\nRELATED: Olivia Benson's Relationship Timeline on Law & Order: SVU\n\nIn Season 15, Episode 19 (\"Downloaded Child\"), Benson ended things between her and Cassidy after concluding that they would always be fundamentally different people. The break-up was amicable, and it was clear she would always hold a special place in his heart.\n\nCassidy finally got justice for himself in Season 20, Episode 16 (\"Facing Demons\"), after a suicide led the SVU to Cassidy's abuser.\n\nUpon finding photos of Cassidy as a child in the defendant's home, the squad asked him to testify. Despite having no wish to rehash his childhood trauma in court, he agreed once he learned that no other survivors were able to step forward.\n\nWith Benson and the squad's support, Cassidy's agreement to testify led to his abuser's arrest.\n\nIt was his last appearance (so far!) on the show."
