        "text": "November 14, 2016\n\nI picked this book up as a loaner with my Kindle Unlimited membership. I love, love, love dark stories that deal with captivity. The books that come with the long disclaimers, cautioning readers and warning of triggers, are usually my favorites. I'm twisted that way.\n\nAfter reading the blurb for 'Broken: A Dark Romance', I thought I'd ran across a gold mine. Abduction. Sexual slavery. Organized crime. I was sure this would be a dark, gritty story that would keep me on the edge of my seat and have me chewing my nails down to the quick.\n\nUnfortunately, it didn't happen. While this story did have some dark elements, it was watered down. I felt like the author wanted to be dark and edgy, but was afraid to cross that line and truly embrace that darkness. If you're a fan of dark reads, then you know the type.\n\nOlivia Bell, our heroine, is abducted after she inadvertently stumbles upon a murder. She can't be set free after what she witnessed, so she is given to the murderer, Kane, to break. Of course, he happens to be an incredibly handsome guy that is in the business of breaking and training sex slaves.\n\nSounds dark, right? Well, if Kane hadn't been remorseful and sympathetic it might have been more believable. Top that off with Olivia's immediate and constant arousal in his presence, and it is hard to take this book seriously as a dark story.\n\nInstead of being the edge of your seat story that I had craved, it ended up being a fluffy read with some kink. Less 'Captive In The Dark' and more BDSM Carebear, if you get what I'm saying. It was okay, but not what I thought I was signing on for.\n\nOverall, it was a middle of the road type of book for me. It is a standalone and won't leave you hanging. However, if your looking for a dark romance/erotica that will make your pulse pound and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, you won't find it here.\n\nRead\n\nJanuary 2, 2017\n\nTHIS BOOK IS NOT FOR ME\n\nRead only a few pages and remembered right away, this author mostly doesn't work for me.\n\nI skimmed a lot and I got to the end of the story.\n\nIt was exactly what I thought it was going to be.\n\nThis is a story about a Dom and how he breaks a young girl for the enjoyment of others. He is a total rapist and abuser to me. She DID NOT ask for what happened and what he did to her and although she is accepting in the end and falls in love with him, it felt like Stockholm syndrome to me.\n\nHe honestly broke her and it was extremely hard to read.\n\nHe comes back randomly after 4 years to see her and they have a \"relationship\" aka more Dom/sub sex that goes nowhere 3 years after they are together still not married or babies. REALLY NOT FOR ME.\n\nIt seems to me that this author often writes about pushover sub heroines that take the crap the heroes give them.\n\nIt's always about controlling Dom/sub but not the protective type (although they say they are, they are not) it often ends in pain and humiliation for the heroine.\n\nAlso, I have a hard time with the pain aspect of BDSM and she writes mostly about this. BDSM I thought was about informed consent? I have no idea here I could be wrong? This is Not romance just painful sex, oral sex, and anal sex.\n\nJust going to avoid this author!\n\nHer writing is not for me.\n\nOctober 12, 2016\n\n❤️Broken: A Dark Romance\n\nBy Willow Winters\n\nOlivia witnesses something she shouldn't have which places her in a very dangerous situation with some very unsavory people. She fast learns that the tall dark and handsome man isn’t as safe person to be with as she thought..\n\nKane finds his self in place where he is given “Angel”| to train in to submit to him.. Lil does Olivia know that Kane is suffering to keep his “dark side” at bay..\n\nKane will fight to protect both of them as he trying to take down one of the biggest sex traffickers\n\nThis was by far one of Willow Winters Darkest books. I would happy recommend this book\n\n.**\"I voluntarily reviewed this ARC\" ..** .**In exchange for an honest review.**\n\nMarch 17, 2017\n\nNow, I'm no writer, nor am I an expert on Stockholm Syndrome or capture-bonding, but I feel pretty confident in saying that if you're going to go with the whole victim falls in love with her kidnapper plot, one of two things needs to happen: 1) Lots of lots of time, or 2) some kind of psychological conditioning--usually a combination of the two. But, maybe that's just me. Even so, I find it a bit unbelievable (and ridiculous) that a woman can witness a brutal crime, get kidnapped, yet when she is finally face to face with the big, bad criminal, just \"the deep cadence of his voice makes (her) pussy clench with sinful thoughts.\" Seriously? Why do they always get wet immediately?\n\nNow I'm ignoring that I've read this exact premise before other than to say if I were the other author, I'd be super pissed...because dayum... Okay, moving on...\n\nSo, Kane is going to train Olivia to be his slave. He doesn't tell her he's undercover, but he does tell her that \"things aren't quite what they seem to be.\" He explains that he just needs her to be perfect for him because their lives are in danger, but she can go home when it's all over. Oh, and shh--don't tell anyone. She agrees; let the training begin!\n\nThings are progressing, but it's the weirdest training I've ever read--no sex, no punishment. Say what now?! He shows her around a BDSM mansion and makes her watch. She has this really weird freak out that makes zero sense:\n\n\"Do you know about BDSM or anything at all about Master slave relationships?\" he asks.\n\n\"I know all about them. I've read about them in books...\"\n\n(Then later, when watching a submissive about to be paddled by her Dom along with several other people in attendance watching the show)\n\n\"It's a paddle. My heart races faster in my chest. He's going to beat her! My legs move naturally in an attempt to protest and save her... I can't stand by and watch this. I won't.\"\n\nIf she is so in the know because she's \"read about them in books,\" this seems like a disproportionate reaction to watching a woman get her butt paddled, especially when her Dom prefaced it by announcing, \"Tonight, my Sara will show her submission to me, and devotion to our lifestyle.\" Just saying...\n\nThe don't actually have sex until 60% in because he wants her to desire him, not just submit to him. He only \"punishes\" her once and it's by edging her. He does threaten to, then he says, \"I changed my mind.\" And even though he changed his mind, she still says later, \"he just punished me last time.\" Umm, no he didn't. And that's one of many, many problems.\n\nKane sits on the bed, and then he walks to the bed. Olivia searches a woman's face even though the woman's back is her. Olivia cries about Victor hurting her even though all he did was make her crawl, and on and on. It just didn't make any sense.\n\nThen there was the gratuitous sex scene. Now normally I wouldn't complain about this, but Kane repeatedly says he'll never share her. \"He said he'd protect me from them, and he'd be the only one to touch me. But as the two other Doms rise from their seats, he changes his tune and says, \"Now would be the time to say no if you don't want this.\"\n\nIn the end, of course, you get your HEA as promised in the blurb. Then again, no cheating is promised too, and there is one scene that I suppose some people might argue...\n\nSeptember 13, 2019\n\nI am really confuse with this book. I soldered on an keep reading. The more I read the more disgust I feel. Yes I understand that this is a very dark romance with heavy BDSM and kidnapping. So safety alert. I enjoy dark romance sometimes when the execution is right. Like Dollars. But in this book it seems Olivia enjoying herself being kidnapped and forced into BDSM lifestyle without explanation.\n\nBut in front she is all bother and acting like a diva who needs attention. She keeps saying she wants to runs away, but she wants to stay. There is no consent in the story. Its really bother me. At the end I just can not stomach it anymore. There is no plot on the story. Just a whole lot of BDSM. Yes it is a hot BDSM but it feels bland for me without convincing plot line. And I am bother that the author does not address the kidnapping and sex slaves.\n\nI usually like OK with Miss Winters books. Some of her books are OK read for me. But Broken just does not work for me.\n\n2 stars\n\nNovember 2, 2016\n\nMeh. I was expecting more from this book considering the dark subject matter is totally what I look for in a good read.\n\nThe heroine was doormat material and the hero was more of a willing participant in what was going on and less of a victim of circumstance. For someone who is \"forced\" to do the things he does, he certainly enjoys it much more than I thought he should.\n\nMay 12, 2017\n\nBizarre\n\nThis book was nothing like what I expected it to be and I found myself wanting to put it down, feeling like it just wasn't for me. Funny thing is, I never did and I finished it. I had to learn the fate of Kade and Olivia. It's truly a very dark romance in my opinion and I'm surely not used to reading this genre. With that said, I still enjoyed the book and I like the way it was written. The ending was what I wanted it to be, even if it seemed like a lie. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes reading romance novels that are a little hardcore.\n\nOctober 10, 2016\n\nI call bullshit! Blurb said there was no cheating in this story which was one of the reasons I decided to read it. Letting 2 other guys fuck her while he watches is cheating in my book. Very disappointed with this book. I hate being lied to. DNF @68%. Thank God I got it from KU. Don't think I will be reading this author again since this was the first book I read of hers.\n\nDecember 23, 2017\n\n2,5 stars\n\nAnother almost dark story. But at least his one wasn't as bad as the other dark stories I've read lately.\n\nIt was free on Amazon and I grabbed it immediately after reading the blurb. I expected a different story. Well Kane wasn't as believable as I wanted him to be. And Olivia fell too easy for the man who was supposed to break her. Stockholm syndrome much?\n\nThe writing was good enough and it kept my interest, but even if it had the ingredients to be a dark one, it didn't feel like it.\n\nDecember 13, 2016\n\nThis book was really hard to put down always wondering what was going to happen next.\n\nShelved as 'avoid'\n\nJune 8, 2023\n\nself note\n\nH shares the h with other men, but he's possessive. Yea, ok.\n\nAvoiding.\n\nJuly 21, 2024\n\nA dark mafia romance, and actually a good read! It was a little slow at first but it picks up and story swirling together nicely.\n\nMay 25, 2017\n\n3.8 Stars\n\nThey say it's dark but personally I found it a bit more erotica then dark.\n\nI started this one without reading the blurb, so I didn't really know anything. But it was on my kindle so I just picked a book. When I first started reading I thought \"Oh this gonna be fun, it's right up my alley\" a bit later on I got a bit scared.\n\nI don't want to spoil anything so anything that I need to get of my chest I'll put as spoiler and otherwise I'm just gonna explain a bit.\n\nOlivia is taken against her will and she can't cope with that in the nice calm state ( what is pretty damn normal!) So she let's her beast out, that's when Kade decide it isn't safe for both of them in that house and she needs proper training.. And that's where it begins to be a bit \"Oh no\" for me.\n\nKade takes her to a mansion for BDSM couples or woman and men separate. This doesn't bother me but the name calling in the mansion not in the bedroom or the whatever room is a bit much. Like do you see yourself in a take a way or restaurant and they ask you what you want and you need to look at Master K ( K for Kade ) for approval before saying what you want and he says \"It's okay Angel, tell the man/woman what you want. -In his defense he doesn't use the term slave-\n\nBut that doesn't mean I don't like a bit BDSM it just means let the name calling in the bedroom and then I wouldn't even do it..\n\nSo here are a bit of spoilers that I need to get of my chest.\n\nMaster G (Gabriel) is the owner and he has his esclave (Slave in French I thought?) Alia *Don't remember her name correctly* They have a different bond then the other Master / Slaves. But still they fuck around. Something I can't stand to read in my books, fuck as much as you want with each other but when another comes along no no no..\n\nA bit in the training he needs to show everyone that Olivia/Angel is doing well and is behaving. To show that he is going to share her with Master G and Master A So they fuck her while Kade is with her. I mean NOT for me, I don't like the sharing kind of books. My H/h need to be together forever alone *them to, but alone* This was a big NO for me.\n\nThe spoilers are also the reason why my rating is a bit on the low side, I just can't handle something like that.\n\nOctober 8, 2016\n\nI am totally speechless. Willow Winters has out done herself this time. It's going to be hard to top this one. I'm so in love with Olivia and Kade. Do yourself a favor and grab this and read it you will not be disappointed. Steam factor 10 stars. I voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book\n\nNovember 18, 2016\n\nWillow Winters has written one of the darkest stories I have yet to read of hers.\n\nOlivia Bell's day has not been going well, thrown out of school , abandon by her parents for screwing up Olivia finds herself alone walking late at night and accidentally into a bad situation. She witness something she should not have seen and finds herself captured by those very men. Men whose business is human trafficking, while they debate killing her or selling her into human slavery she pleads with the only man there who seems safe. Little does she know, under different circumstances, Kade is that safe port; but he can't be this time.\n\nKade is an undercover cop, deep undercover and on this night had to already prove his loyalty to this crime ring in a horrendous way, but now he finds himself being given Olivia to train , to break so she can become part of the next sex slave shipment .In the past the women he has supposedly trained he usually took,to a secure location and had them removed from the situation, however with Olivia he is going to have to break her for real to maintain his cover . This is where the story gets darker.....\n\nBreaking Olivia, may just break him too.\n\nArc Graciuosly supplied by author for honest review.\n\nJuly 15, 2018\n\nWas expecting so much from this book as I have read willows other books and those were so good. So my expectations were high from this one but it didn't stand out.\n\nOctober 24, 2016\n\nI was thrilled to receive an Advance Reviewer copy of BROKEN by Willow Winters, because I am fan of her Valetti Crime Family series and think she is a very talented writer of bad boy mafia romances, but I am sorry to say that in my opinion this book did not quite live up to the promise of the premise\n\nIn a nutshell, Olivia Bell was at the wrong place at the wrong time and witnessed a brutal murder committed by the tall, dark and fearsome Kade Maddox (aka Master ), a nefarious criminal in the sex trafficking trade. He takes her captive, but in order to spare her life, he brokers a deal with the head ringleader to “break” her and turn her into the “perfect” slave. She is far from compliant at first, and fights tooth and nail trying to run away, forcing him to move her from his comfy home to a sinful brothel, home to sex slaves and their masters, where her intense, rigorous slave training will commence. But Kade is harboring some dangerous secrets and vows to protect her at all costs Although she knows it’s all kinds of wrong she is powerfully aroused by Master K’s training and finds herself falling head over heels for her captor. As the danger, desire and deceit reach a fever pitch, neither of them counted on the shocking turn of events that is about to implode both their worlds.\n\nI REALLY wanted to like this book because it started out in a really thrilling and electrifying manner and I was excited at the prospect of diving into this dark master/slave tale where we see the hero's internal struggle between forbidding captor vs noble savior. But although I was drawn to the hot, sexy and breathtakingly tender master/slave dynamic between Kade and his “sweet angel,” overall this book did not work for me. The author touted this as her first dark romance but it really wasn’t really all that dark…or compelling. Granted, it was well written and there were some really hot BDSM scenes but it lacked dramatic urgency and after a while I found myself skimming the sex scenes and slave training sequences because if felt very redundant.\n\nOn the positive side, I liked Kade... he was dark and domineering and fiercely protective, and was so exquisitely gentle and doting with Olivia it melted my heart. And his captive, Olivia, was sassy and fiery in the beginning and certainly gave him a run for his money. But once the training began, she became too passive for my taste. Turns out his plan to break her into complete submission worked TOO well. She spends practically the entire book doing his bidding and complying with his every demand out of fear of being punished, and the end result is she come across as weak and pathetic.\n\nAnother big problem I had with this book was that there was no genuine depth to this romance, or any real character development. This was very much a sexually-driven story that was heavy on the BDSM with a little drama and suspense thrown in. Pretty much the entire plot was focused on her slave training in the sex slave brothel and there was no real palpable love story here to make my heart race. The feelings that Olivia develops for her captor are truly a case of Stockholm Syndrome and little else. I never felt as if I got to really know Kade or Olivia on a personal level and they did not have much rooting value for me because I didn't connect emotionally with them as couple. And while their “romance” (if you can call it that) had its sweet moments, their interactions lacked sparks, passion and genuine feeling, and the climax I felt to be quite anticlimactic and the HEA extremely rushed.\n\nOverall, this book had an intriguing premise and had some steamy interludes and sweet tenderness, but it ultimately fell short on execution. But even though this particular book is a miss for me, I am still a fan of the talented Ms. Willow's work and will continue to read her books.\n\nOctober 9, 2016\n\nHow can something so wrong seem so right? Just like how can something so dark bring such light? Olivia had witnessed something that she shouldn’t have and that’s what threw in the path of Kade. Kade seemed like such a strong, menacing man but there was something about him that had Olivia take notice. Just like she noticed the other men Kade was with and they made her feel nothing but fear to the highest level. She thought for sure that her life was going to end in that alley so she was surprised when a deal was made with all the men in the alley that night and Olivia was taken by Kade with one purpose in mind and that was to make her into a sex slave. Oh, yeah, it just gets better from here!\n\nYou have to be able to handle a dark read but it is also very erotic with one hell of a happy ending. This is the first time I read Willow Winters’ work and she has made her way to being one of my favorites. This may be dark but it is darkness at its best and will leave you reading Broken as a book you can’t put down.\n\nSeptember 15, 2019\n\nI LOVED this book. This one is a Standalone. The basic premise is... a girl (well, woman), stumbles upon some criminals and witnesses the murder of a cop. She gets taken by these guys and given as a gift to one of them \"to train\"... instead of being \"shipped off.\" Kade is this guy.\n\nShe doesn't know what being \"trained\" or \"shipped off\" means, but she has an idea and she knows she definitely doesn't want the last thing. She wants Kade to save her. She has this weird and wrong feeling that she can trust him that he will protect her and keep her safe.\n\nHer instincts are spot on because Kade isn't what he appears, but I will NOT spoil that.\n\nEither way, she is in a situation where she has to obey him. She struggles between her fantasies, her attraction to Kade, and the very real very wrong thing that's being done to her.\n\nIt's a brilliant dark romance with a great set-up! You should read this! I listened to the audio version narrated by Jacob Morgan (great as always!) and Muffy Newtown (new narrator to me, but did a great job. Very emotional!)\n\nOctober 15, 2016\n\nSeriously? This is even worse than the last one I read by this author. KU is my love/hate, I love some of the books I find but I hate getting sucked into crap like this. Come up with another way to describe sex scenes, the author used the same phrases repeatedly ad infinitum until the point if I read one more pussy clench I was going to straight up vomit. It says no cheating, but there is cheating. The entire story just went nowhere really, what was the point?\n\nOctober 13, 2016\n\nShe fell fast\n\nShe fell for him like the next day..way to soon, it was creepy..Now it was okay, fast read..I did find him sexy and you could tell he hated what he was doing, really he was very easy on her...I didn't get why he shared her with Master G and Master A, maybe I missed something or maybe it was just what it was...three men and a girl and she loved it\n\nDecember 4, 2016\n\nHoly heck this book was awesome! It hit every spot you would want for a book. We feel remorse for The heroine at the start. She had a crap hand dealt but she still pushed forward. She never stoped fighting, no matter what she was a fighter.\n\nCrap! Kade surprised me! He was ruthless and deadly in the best possible way! I warmed to him, because even under all that dark he was fighting to be be what Olivia deserved. I can't go into more detail but even though he was mean, he was amazing!\n\nHoly plot twist! I loved every twist and turn this had some familiar topics but they were done so differently that it all felt new and refreshing. The duel POV helped with the flow of the story. Not only because it helped with the plot twists, but because it gave us such amazin insight to both main characters.\n\nIt felt short. That's my only complaint. While there was a lot packed into these pages, I felt some parts could have been drawn out.\n\nOverall it was amazing and I was both sad and happy at the end. I could read these characters for so maybe more hours. 4.5 stars. #2OCCJD\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\nThe images I painted in my mind while reading this book I’m sure will send me to hell! It was amazing I loved it. The beginning middle and end was perfect. The build of excitement through the book keep me reading through it! Kade and olivias relationship build and bond was great. He had a soft spot for her. The beginning I thought oh this will be predictable but.... kade came in a switched it up real quick.\n\nTrigger warnings\n\n*rape type bdsm\n\n*murder\n\n*date rape drugs\n\n*kidnapping\n\nEnjoy like I did :)\n\nSeptember 3, 2017\n\nI'm speechless!!\n\nThis was my first read by Author Willow Winters and I swear I'm hooked!!\n\nThis story was exciting, fast paced, and edge of your seat nail-biting!!\n\nThe characters were lovable and held all the characteristics I look for in the perfect read.\n\nThis story was seriously intense. I found myself blushing, and my skin burning with heat!!\n\nI listened to this on audio. Muffy Newton and Jacob Morgan did an amazing job telling this story.\n\nHighly Recommend!!!!\n\nMarch 7, 2022\n\nThis Book was sOOOO good ! SOOOO Hot and spicy 🌶 i loved all the Characters . Kade and Olivia had the best chemistry kept me on the edge of my seat till the end.\n\nWillow Winters knows how to bring steam threw her pages.\n\nVery well written. Looking forward to reading all her books!\n\nIf you have not read broken. Don’t wait get a copy soon as possible ♥️♥️\n\nOctober 8, 2016\n\nDARK-DANGEROUS-SENSUOUS ROMANCE\n\nA titillating tale that is dark, dangerous and has action, suspense, tears, life-threatening incidents, loss, and sizzling obedient sensuous romance. The story makes you feel and keeps you turning the pages until the end. There are quite a few hurdles to conquer before the happy ever after.\n\nOlivia thought the worst thing that could happen to her was getting thrown out of college due to drinking in the dorm. Walking alone at night, depressed and frustrated she finds herself in a dark alley and becomes an eyewitness to a murder. Taken by force she finds herself tied up in a shabby office with the men from the alley. The men who have taken her want her dead thinking she is worthless. This group of men is into sex trafficking and treat women like dirt. Kade an undercover cop is there to destroy their operation. In front of the boss he plays his part well pretending he can break any woman to submit to their master. Kade wreaks of power and is deadly. Truth be told he has been trained by the best. Kade is tasked to break her to prove his worthiness. Olivia fights him until she no longer can. He must break her to save both their lives.\n\nThe story is fast paced and brilliantly written. The author has mixed reality and fantasy which makes this story impressive. She also does not disappoint by giving readers an enthralling plot with fabulous dialogue and vivid scene descriptions that leave you breathless. It sickened Kade the things he made Olivia do, but keeping up the ruse was to protect her. Olivia truly was strong even when she submitted to Kade and followed his commands, but in the midst of all the chaos and pain, she fell in love. Kade never dreamed that he would fall in love and believed he was not worthy of Olivia's love. Their love story started in terror, but ended in devotion; let us not forget that Kade always gets what he wants. This was a gratifying read and the author did a fantastic job with the writing of this story; loved it. If you treasure dark romances, this is an excellent book for your library. In the world of fantasy romance, the magic begins with the first thought to paper. {I received an advanced reader copy of this story; I was not asked by anyone to do this review, it is done totally by my own choice alone}. Without reservations, I recommend this book.\n\nDecember 19, 2016\n\nI have only read one other book listed as a Dark Romance. This one has the other one beat by a mile! If you are considering reading this book, read a few of the reviews so that you know what you will be reading and can make an informed decision.\n\nOlivia witnesses a gun shot murder in an alley. Beside the victim, there are three other really creepy bad guys in that dark alley, and one rather tall, imposing, handsome man who exudes power and control. Rather than have the young innocent killed there, too. He takes charge of her, promising to train her as a submissive to be sold into the sex trade. His name is Kade and we know right from the start that he is an undercover agent trying to bring down a large international sex ring. She can never know that piece of information.\n\nKade takes her to a gorgeous mansion, where other submissives and slaves are trained. Kade has participated in the BDSM scene, and is a DOM.\n\nOlivia is a spitfire and is always looking for ways to escape.Submissiveness does not come easily to her, at least at first. Kade has to do some hard bargaining with her. The BDSM is very light. This is a psychological study of how Kade works with Olivia and sees her first as a duty and then increasingly as a love interest. She too eventually falls under his spell, but even late in the book is till looking for a way OUT..\n\nThere are a few other characters in the story, but they just fill out the story of the building romance between Olivia and Kade.\n\nIt's one of the best stories that I have read all year... and it is already December! I highly recommend this book.\n\nOctober 12, 2016\n\nThis book is this author's darkest book to date. It wasn't the darkest I have read but it definitely took you out of your comfort zone. Our H is Kade Maddox and our h is Olivia Bell.\n\nOlivia Bell had been expelled from college for drinking on campus. She has lost her scholarship and her parents support. While out one night after looking for a job, she takes an alley home instead of walking by some men. She ends up witnessing a murder and before she can get away, she is captured. When she comes to, she is being given to the man that shot the other man.\n\nKade Maddox isn't everything that he seems. He comes off as a cold hearted killer that likes to break and train women. Kade is actually undercover and is there to take down the sex trafficking ring. Once he sees Olivia, he knows he has to take her to save her life. He will also have to break her to save his cover.\n\nOlivia fights Kade but feels drawn to him at the same time. He is actually Master K and introduces Olivia to BDMS. As their time goes on, Kade hates having to put Olivia through what he is but he is doing it to save her life. He also needs to save his cover so he can bring down the operation.\n\nOlivia and Kade's chemistry was off the charts and the sexy scenes were hot. This wasn't in the top of some of my darker reads (as far as the dark) but it was for what I have read by this author. You can easily see her growth as an author from her first book to this one. I, for one, can't wait to see what she is going to write next.\n\nI voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book.\n\nOctober 11, 2016\n\nOlivia Bell is a young college student that's been expelled from college for underage drinking. Olivia is looking for a way to support herself and pay rent now that she doesn't have a job any more. Olivia is overlooked for the jobs she's applying for. Then Olivia witnesses something that she shouldn't only to have her world turned upside down where nothing is ever the same again. Kade Maddox isn't even his real name yet he's so far undercover that defies logic. The rules are do nothing illegal ever no matter what but sometimes the rules aren't any good at all. Now Kade has to figure out a way to make things right for Olivia even if she never understands. Kade promises Olivia freedom but can he really grant it? Your answers await you in Broken.\n\nI love Ms. Winters writing style! The story and characters are compelling, complex, real, gritty, raw, honest, and flawed in their own way. I'm definitely looking forward to my next adventure with this author."
