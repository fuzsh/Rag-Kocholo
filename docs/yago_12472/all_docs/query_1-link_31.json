        "text": "To understand what a gerund is, imagine your doorbell rings on Halloween. “Trick or treat!” yell a ghost, a vampire, and a werewolf. Why don’t you run away, screaming in terror? Because you know they’re not really scary creatures — they’re just kids dressed up in costumes so they can get candy. That’s what gerunds do: They pretend to be a different part of speech to make a sentence work. (Now hand over the candy.)\n\nNow that your students know all about nouns, double the challenge by making them plural! The rules about plural nouns can be a bit confusing for young readers, especially when it comes to irregular nouns in the English language. Use these plural nouns worksheets to reinforce important grammar skills in elementary school."
