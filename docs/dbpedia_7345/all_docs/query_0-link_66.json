        "text": "If George Eliot’s Wikipedia entry has received an unusually high number of views this week, the responsibility lies with Lena Dunham, who tweeted a couple of days ago that the Victorian novelist’s page was “the soapiest most scandalous thing you’ll read this month. Thesis: she was ugly AND horny!”\n\nAlas, for the prurient-minded, Eliot’s wiki-biography is rather more elliptical in its characterization of the Victorian author. It does say that “she was considered to have an ill-favoured appearance, and she formed a number of embarrassing, unreciprocated emotional attachments.” Of course, that’s only a fraction of what it says about her. The Wikipedia contributors also give a capsule account of her remarkable transformation from provincial girl—she was born Mary Ann Evans, the daughter of a land agent, in Coventry in 1819—to one of the preëminent intellectuals of the nineteenth century, and the author of “Middlemarch,” widely considered the greatest novel in the English language. (Dunham told me in an e-mail this week that she’s just embarked on “Middlemarch” for the first time, having been inspired to read it by “The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P.,” Adelle Waldman’s clever, Eliot-inflected, début novel.) There’s a lot more to George Eliot than her less than conventionally beautiful appearance and her possession of a sexual drive—as there is to every other woman whose looks and sexual drive have been the subject of popular commentary, among them Dunham and her “Girls” alter ego, Hannah Horvath.\n\nStill, there’s no getting away from the fascination with Eliot’s romantic life and her looks, both of which presented a challenge to acceptable norms. Having refused a marriage proposal, from a restorer of paintings, when she was in her mid-twenties, Eliot had entanglements in her early thirties with men to whom she wasn’t married—the social theorist Herbert Spencer, who declined to fall in love with her—and with men who were married to someone else, including John Chapman, the publisher of the Westminster Review, and Eliot’s employer and landlord. Both Chapman’s wife and his live-in mistress, the Chapman children’s governess, were so vexed by the attentions that he was paying to his interesting lodger that Eliot was obliged to move out, at least until Chapman’s need for her editing skills overruled the preferences of his womenfolk.\n\nAfter those enlightening, if sometimes distressing, adventures, Eliot lived for twenty-four years with another married man, George Henry Lewes, in consummately happy defiance of custom. A year and a half after Lewes died, Eliot finally did get married: to John Walter Cross, a longstanding friend and adviser who was twenty years her junior. Whether this action bespoke horniness or something subtler—such as love—most of her contemporaries found it even more shocking than her extramarital cohabitation. And most of her later biographers have found it distasteful in their own ways, too—not least because, while the newlyweds were on their honeymoon in Venice, Cross jumped out of a window into the Grand Canal, an action that many commentators trying to explain Eliot’s life and choices have taken to imply that a grotesque inequity of desire underlay their marriage.\n\nAnd what of Eliot’s alleged ugliness? Ever since there have been George Eliot biographies, there have been George Eliot biographers remarking upon her uncomely appearance. “It must be a terrible sorrow to be young and unattractive: to look in the mirror and see a sallow unhealthy face, with a yellowish skin, straight nose, and mouse-colored hair,” the twenty-four-year-old critic Anne Fremantle wrote in 1933. As K. K. Collins discovered in compiling his indispensable volume, “George Eliot, Interviews and Recollections,” many of those who encountered George Eliot felt moved to describe her looks. She was “a woman with next to no feminine beauty or charm or of countenance or person,” according to William Michael Rossetti, the critic and brother of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti. Grace Greenwood, the American novelist, described her as “exceedingly plain, with her aggressive jaw and her evasive blue eyes.” Henry James characterized her as “magnificently ugly, deliciously hideous.”\n\nBut James also noted an interesting phenomenon about Eliot’s supposed ugliness: when she began to converse, her expression was one of such tenderness and sympathy that it left her interlocutor with an abiding sense of beauty. “Behold me, literally in love with this great horse-faced bluestocking!” James wrote after his first encounter with her. Many others who met her made similar comments, including Lucy Clifford, a novelist, who said that Eliot did, indeed, look like a horse—“a strange variety of horse that was full of knowledge, and beauty of thought, and mysteries of which the human being had no conception.” Eliot was possessed of a radiant, luminous intelligence that outshone her perceived deficits—that rendered irrelevant the small-minded criticisms of her character and visage to which she was subject for much of her life.\n\nGeorge Eliot knew she wasn’t good-looking—as a young woman she made painful, unfunny jokes about her appearance in letters to friends—but she also knew she had bigger things to spend her time on, including the loving commitments that she made to men of whom everyone around her disapproved. “Light and easily broken ties are what I neither desire theoretically nor could live for practically,” she told one censorious friend after she eloped with Lewes. “Women who are satisfied with such ties do not act as I have done—they obtain what they desire and are still invited to dinner.” And George Eliot’s intelligence was sufficiently encompassing to give lie to the easy, post-Freudian interpretations of Johnnie Cross’s great leap—interpretations suggesting, essentially, that Eliot was too horny and too ugly for Cross to handle. Eliot was profoundly adroit at charting the intricacies of desire and revulsion in her novels, and in her life she knew what it was to live in fulfilled, enduring intimacy with a passionate and loving partner. The wisest among us are capable of being under terrible misapprehensions about our own desires, or those of people around us; but the possibility that this particular honeymoon foundered on the basis of a simple case of erotic cold feet seems implausible. In any case, whatever went on in that Venetian chamber, nobody was better equipped to interpret it than Eliot—who chose not to, at least not in public."
