        "text": "Spencer is most recognised today for using the ideas of biology and evolutionary theory to inform his views on society. His most influential publication was A System of Synthetic Philosophy (1862-96), in which he sought to bring together his ideas of biology, sociology, ethics, and politics. Spencer was an early exponent of evolutionary theory, explored in his Principles of Psychology (1855). He later embraced Charles Darwin‘s theory of natural selection, and coined the phrase the ‘survival of the fittest’ to describe it in Principles of Biology (1864). He did, however, give significant weight to Lamarckian ideas of inherited traits and acquired characteristics, a recurring theme in his writings which would later cause his reputation to suffer. Regardless, he was a staunch – and significant – defender of evolutionary theory and its implications, writing in 1852:\n\nThose who cavalierly reject the theory of Lamarck and his followers, as not adequately supported by facts, seem quite to forget that their own theory is supported by no facts at all. Like the majority of men who are born to a given belief, they demand the most rigorous proof of any adverse doctrine, but assume that their own doctrine needs none.\n\nLike his close friend, T.H. Huxley (who became known as ‘Darwin’s bulldog’ for his own vociferous defence of evolutionary science), Spencer rejected the possibility of proving the existence (or non-existence) of a god. In his autobiography, he wrote:\n\nI hold that we are as utterly incompetent to understand the ultimate nature of things, or origin of them, as the deaf man is to understand sounds or the blind man light. My position is simply that I know nothing about it, and never can know anything about it, and must be content in my ignorance. I deny nothing and I affirm nothing… I am content to leave the question unsettled as the insoluble mystery.\n\nSpencer emphasised instead the ‘natural laws’ which governed the world, and believed that concepts of morality could be derived from these, with no need for revealed religion. He believed ‘there must be a basis for morals in the nature of things — in the relations between the individual and the surrounding world, and in the social relations of men to one another.’ Like others who argued for a distinction between concepts of religion and morality, he recognised in 1862’s First Principles that ‘volumes might be written upon the impiety of the pious.’ In an 1891 essay, Spencer expressed his belief that ‘absolute morality is the regulation of conduct in such a way that pain shall not be inflicted’."
