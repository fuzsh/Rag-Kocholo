        "text": "Herbert Spencer has been heralded as one of the most influential philosophers of progressive educational thought and social evolution, framing education not as a teacher-centered vehicle rooted in the classical pedagogical methods of the elite but rather as a culture-neutral and student-directed system for exploring innate scientific concepts. In contemporary education, his most enduring legacy is in the rise and growth of personalized learning as a pedagogical method for teachers to provide curriculum and instruction that is tailored to individual student needs and interests. This article contextualizes Spencer’s educational philosophy by recalling his learning environments, scholarly and personal influences, and lived experiences as a middle-class student in the punitive, authoritarian Victorian English education system. It also underscores his key contribution to educational thought: “What knowledge is of most worth?” It applies cultural historical activity theory to reflect on the racial beliefs that underscore his prioritization of student-directed learning and scientific education. Finally, the authors offer guidance for applying student-directed curriculum and instruction pedagogies that are also culturally sustainable."
