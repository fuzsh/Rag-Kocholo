        "text": "Probably no playwright today, however addicted to voluminous stage-directions, would furnish his character’s study, except as a surrealist fantasy, with a bust of Herbert Spencer. Bernard Shaw does just this in the stage-directions to Man and Superman, and means something by it.\n\nDoubtless few of Shaw’s readers had actually read the enormous volumes of the Synthetic Philosophy, but the name of their author was part of the general currency of culture; his bust symbolized a set of attitudes which would be recognized, though the intention was now to laugh at them. Spencer himself died later in the same year (1903), bitterly conscious that his influence and prestige were waning.\n\nHis present oblivion makes it difficult to appreciate how great that prestige had been. He had refused innumerable honorary degrees, it being against his principles to accept them. In America his philosophy, industriously propagated by publicists like Fiske and Youmans, had penetrated the universities; it was even seriously suggested that if the South had read Spencer there would have been no Civil War."
