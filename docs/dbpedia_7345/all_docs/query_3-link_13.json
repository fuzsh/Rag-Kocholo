        "text": "When Eliot’s father died in 1849, he left her a small yearly amount of £90. This was a reasonable amount, but not enough for her to carry on living in the way she was used to. After travelling abroad with the Brays, she decided to move to London. Unless she married, she needed to find a job.\n\nShe lodged at the house of her employer – John Chapman. She wrote essays and later became editor of his magazine, the Westminster Review. She continued to educate herself, reading widely on many topics. In 1851, she attended lectures in History, German, French and Elocution at the Ladies College (now known as Royal Holloway).\n\nEliot became close to John Chapman. His wife and his lover (who also lived with him as governess to his children) insisted that she took up lodgings elsewhere. However Chapman needed Eliot at the magazine and persuaded them to allow her to return. She also had a relationship with Herbert Spencer, a philosopher, who had visited Rosehill. She then met George Henry Lewes, a friend of Chapman."
