        "text": "Over a century after his death, Herbert Spencer still polarizes opinion. Incompatible estimations flow from a bewildering diversity of commentators. In 1994, he was singled out by one historian as ‘an extremely unpleasant man and theorist’ (McClelland, 1994: p. 394). W. H. Greenleaf, however, had come to evaluate his work as ‘one of the ablest intellectual achievements in British thought and letters of the Victorian age’ (1983: p. 32). Laland and Brown, concerned to distance Darwin from a political set of beliefs known often as ‘social Darwinism’ suggest that ‘Social Spencerism would be a more appropriate term, since it derives far more from Spencer than from Darwin’ (2002: p. 42). Michael Taylor, however, in the most recent study of the whole broad sweep of Spencer’s ideas robustly resists the premise lurking behind this advice: ‘To see his comprehensive world system through the lens of social Darwinism is thus to miss everything that enabled him to hold an entire generation in thrall’ (2007: p. 149). While the anthropologist Tim Ingold found there to be ‘good grounds for arguing that Spencer, and not Darwin, was the first sociobiologist’ (1986: p. 225), the author of a recent biography, Mark Francis, characterized Spencer as first and foremost a psychologist, yet one who proved to be ‘a corporate theorist who was also a Utopian individualist’ (2007: p. 311).\n\nHow small, of all that human hearts endure,\n\nThat part which laws or kings can cause or cure.\n\nStill to ourselves in every place consign’d,\n\nOur own felicity we make or find\n\n(Oliver Goldsmith, The Traveller)"
