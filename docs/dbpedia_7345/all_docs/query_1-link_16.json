        "text": "Spencer saw philosophy as a synthesis of the fundamental principles of the special sciences, a sort of scientific summa to replace the theological systems of the Middle Ages. He thought of unification in terms of development, and his whole scheme was in fact suggested to him by the evolution of biological species. In First Principles he argued that there is a fundamental law of matter, which he called the law of the persistence of force, from which it follows that nothing homogeneous can remain as such if it is acted upon, because any external force must affect some part of it differently from other parts and cause difference and variety to arise. From that, he continued, it would follow that any force that continues to act on what is homogeneous must bring about an increasing variety. That “law of the multiplication of effects,” due to an unknown and unknowable absolute force, is in Spencer’s view the clue to the understanding of all development, cosmic as well as biological.\n\nIt should be noted that Spencer published his idea of the evolution of biological species before the views of Charles Darwin and the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace were known. Spencer at that time thought that evolution was caused by the inheritance of acquired characteristics, whereas Darwin and Wallace attributed it to natural selection. Spencer later accepted the theory that natural selection was one of the causes of biological evolution.\n\nSociology and social philosophy\n\nThat Spencer first derived his general evolutionary scheme from reflection on human society is seen in Social Statics, in which social evolution (see social change) is held to be a process of increasing “individuation.” He saw human societies as evolving by means of increasing division of labour from undifferentiated hordes into complex civilizations. Spencer believed that the fundamental sociological classification was between military societies, in which cooperation was secured by force, and industrial societies, in which cooperation was voluntary and spontaneous.\n\nEvolution is not the only biological conception that Spencer applied in his sociological theories. He made a detailed comparison between animal organisms and human societies. In both he found a regulative system (the central nervous system in the one, government in the other), a sustaining system (alimentation in the one case, industry in the other), and a distribution system (veins and arteries in the first; roads, telegraphs, etc., in the second). The great difference between an animal and a social organism, he said, is that, whereas in the former there is one consciousness relating to the whole, in the latter consciousness exists in each member only; society exists for the benefit of its members and not they for its benefit.\n\nThis individualism is the key to all of Spencer’s work. His contrast between military and industrial societies is drawn between despotism, which is primitive and bad, and individualism, which is civilized and good. He believed that in industrial society the order achieved, though planned by no one, is delicately adjusted to the needs of all parties. In The Man Versus the State (1884), he wrote that England’s Tories generally favour a military and Liberals an industrial social order but that the Liberals of the latter half of the 19th century, with their legislation on hours of work, liquor licensing, sanitation (see public health), education, and so on, were developing a “New Toryism” and preparing the way for a “coming slavery.” According to Spencer,\n\nthe function of liberalism in the past was that of putting a limit to the powers of kings. The function of true liberalism in the future will be that of putting a limit to the powers of parliaments.\n\nNevertheless, Spencer’s view of such ameliorative legislation as a pernicious aid to the “unfit” and an impediment to the positive development of society through the success of its most-talented members was gradually discredited as the misery of the poor under industrial capitalism became more widely known. In the second half of the 20th century, interest in Spencer’s social Darwinism and his theory of natural rights was revived by libertarians and like-minded thinkers (e.g., the American philosopher Robert Nozick), who saw in them the basis of a moral argument against the burgeoning postwar welfare state.\n\nMetaphysics\n\nIn his emphasis on variety and differentiation, Spencer was unwittingly repeating, in a 19th-century idiom, the metaphysics of liberalism that Benedict de Spinoza and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz had adumbrated in the 17th century. Spinoza had maintained that “God or Nature” has an infinity of attributes in which every possibility is actualized, and Leibniz had argued that the perfection of God is exhibited in the infinite variety of the universe. Although neither of them believed that time is an ultimate feature of reality, Spencer combined a belief in the reality of time with a belief in the eventual actualization of every possible variety of being. He thus gave metaphysical support to the liberal principle of variety, according to which a differentiated and developing society is preferable to a monotonous and static one.\n\nEvaluation\n\nSpencer’s attempt to synthesize the sciences showed a sublime audacity that has not been repeated because the intellectual specialization he welcomed and predicted increased even beyond his expectations. His sociology, although it gave an impetus to the study of society, was superseded as a result of the development of social (or cultural) anthropology and was much more concerned with providing a rationale for his social ideals than he himself appreciated. Indigenous peoples, for example, are not the childlike emotional creatures that he thought them to be, nor is religion to be explained only in terms of the souls of ancestors. When Huxley said that Spencer’s idea of a tragedy was “the slaying of a beautiful deduction by an ugly fact,” he called attention to the system-building feature of Spencer’s work that led him to look for what confirmed his theories and to ignore or to reinterpret what conflicted with them.\n\nHarry Burrows Acton The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
