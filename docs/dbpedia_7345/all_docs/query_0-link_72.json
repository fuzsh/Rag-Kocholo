        "text": "G. H. LEWES\n\nA Life.By Rosemary Ashton.Illustrated. 369 pp. New York:Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press.\n\nGEORGE HENRY LEWES belonged to a species rendered virtually extinct by the knowledge explosion and the consequent specialization of labor that characterizes modern intellectual life. \"There was no form of literary expression in which he did not delight and instruct,\" Anthony Trollope declared in a warmly appreciative obituary. Yet, for all the dazzling variety of his achievements, Lewes (1817-78) is probably most familiar to 20th-century readers in the role of supportive spouse. Though he was not in fact married to the novelist known as George Eliot, Lewes nurtured and encouraged his partner with a zealousness that few husbands, then or now, could match.\n\nIf the good cheer with which he adapted to life with a woman who became far more successful than himself can make Lewes something of an exemplary figure for contemporary negotiations between the sexes, it also complicates the task of the biographer. After their elopement, Marian Evans may have become \"extinct, rolled up, mashed, absorbed in the Lewesian magnificence,\" as Lewes exuberantly announced to a feminist friend who persisted in addressing her by her maiden name. But from the moment Evans took on her pseudonym as a novelist, Lewes himself has been in danger of getting \"rolled up, mashed, absorbed\" in the \"magnificence\" of George Eliot. In this new life of Lewes, Rosemary Ashton, who teaches English at University College, London, sets out to right the balance.\n\nThe relation with George Eliot poses a further difficulty for Lewes's biographer, since their unorthodox union seems to have prompted a nearly wholesale destruction of the evidence. No letters between Eliot and Lewes survive. Her letters to him have disappeared; his to her were buried, by her own arrangement, in her grave. Only one undated note from Lewes to his lawful wife, Agnes, still exists, and only two letters in Agnes's hand, neither one addressed to her husband. Understandable as such impulses to privacy are, all this reticence has a certain irony, since Lewes scandalized his contemporaries less by what he did than by the openness with which he did it.\n\nWhen he eloped with Marian to the Continent in 1854, he was ostensibly the father of seven children, three of whom were the offspring of his wife's adulterous affair with his friend and fellow journalist, Thornton Hunt. Hunt, a son of the poet and essayist Leigh Hunt, himself had a wife and several legitimate children at the time, one of whom had been born within a month of his third child by Agnes Lewes.\n\nAs a young man, Lewes once planned to write a biography of Shelley, and he appears to have initially entered into this domestic triangle in a spirit of Shelleyan tolerance and free love. Though he grew increasingly disillusioned with the arrangement, Victorian law prohibited a man who had publicly condoned his wife's adultery from later divorcing her on those grounds. And there is no doubt that publicity attended the affairs of the Hunts and the Leweses. Though gossip was inevitably vague on the details, and many salacious fictions circulated along with facts, Agnes's adultery and the paternity of her children seem to have been common knowledge in some quarters even before Lewes eloped with Marian Evans.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
