        "text": "Herbert Spencer and Social Darwinism (c. 1857)\n\nThe English philosopher Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) was a late-nineteenth-century representative of classical liberal political economy. He is perhaps best known for his use of the expression “survival of the fittest” (Principles of Biology, 1864), which he took as the essence of Darwin’s evolutionary theory. Spencer applied the principles of Darwinian evolution to human society, and became the voice of a Social Darwinism that argued that governments ought not to intervene in the lives of those who cannot help themselves.\n\nThe current conception of Progress is somewhat shifting and indefinite. Sometimes it comprehends little more than simple growth—as of a nation in the number of its members and the extent of territory over which it has spread. Sometimes it has reference to quantity of material products—as when the advance of agriculture and manufactures is the topic. Sometimes the superior quality of these products is contemplated; and sometimes the new or improved appliances by which they are produced. When again we speak of moral or intellectual progress, we refer to the state of the individual or people exhibiting it; whilst, when the progress of Knowledge, of Science, of Art, is commented upon, we have in view certain abstract results of human thought and action. Not only, however, is the current conception of Progress more or less vague, but it is in great measure erroneous. It takes in not so much the reality of Progress as its accompaniments—not so much the substance as the shadow. That progress in intelligence which takes place during the evolution of the child into the man, or the savage into the philosopher, is commonly regarded as consisting in the greater number of facts known and laws understood: whereas the actual progress consist in the produce of a greater quantity and variety of articles for the satisfaction of men’s wants; in the increasing security of person and property; in the widening freedom of action enjoyed whereas, rightly understood, social progress consists in those changes of structure in the social organism which have entailed these consequences. The current conception is a teleological one. The phenomena are contemplated solely as bearing on human happiness. Only those changes are held to constitute progress which directly or indirectly tend to heighten human happiness. And they are thought to constitute progress simply because they tend to heighten human happiness. But rightly to understand Progress, we must inquire what is the nature of these changes, considered apart from our interests. Ceasing, for example, to regard the successive geological modifications that have taken place in the Earth, as modifications that have gradually fitted it for the habitation of Man, and as therefore a geological progress, we must seek to determine the character common to these modifications—the law to which they all conform. And similarly in every other case. Leaving out of sight concomitants and beneficial consequences, let us ask what Progress is in itself.\n\nIn respect to that progress which individual organisms display in the course of their evolution, this question has been answered by the Germans. The investigations of Wolff, Goethe, and Van Baer have established the truth that the series of changes gone through during the development of a seed into a tree, or an ovum into an animal, constitute an advance from homogeneity of structure to heterogeneity of structure. In its primary stage, every germ consists of a substance that is uniform throughout, both in texture and chemical composition. The first step in its development is the appearance of a difference between two parts of this substance; or, as the phenomenon is described in physiological language—a differentiation. Each of these differentiated divisions presently begins itself to exhibit some contrast of parts; and by these secondary differentiations become as definite as the original one. This progress is continuously repeated—is simultaneously going on in all parts of the growing embryo; and by endless multiplication of these differentiations there is ultimately produced that complex combination of tissues and organs constituting the adult animal or plant. This is the course of evolution followed by all organisms whatever. It is settled beyond dispute that organic progress consists in a change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous.\n\nNow, we propose in the first place to show, that this law of organic progress is the law of all progress. Whether it be in the development of the Earth, in the development of Life upon its surface, the development of Society, of Government, of Manufactures, of Commerce, of Language, Literature, Science, Art, this same evolution of the simple into the complex, through a process of continuous differentiation, holds throughout. From the earliest traceable cosmical changes down to the latest results of civilization, we shall find that the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous, is that in which Progress essentially consists. . . .\n\nWhether an advance from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is or is not displayed in the biological history of the globe, it is clearly enough displayed in the progress of the latest and most heterogeneous creature—Man. It is alike true that, during the period in which the Earth has been peopled, the human organism has become more heterogeneous among the civilized divisions of the species and that the species, as a whole, has been growing more heterogeneous in virtue of the multiplication of races and the differentiation of these races from each other. . . .\n\nIn the course of ages, there arises, as among ourselves, a highly complex political organization of monarch, ministers, lords and commons, with their subordinate administrative departments, courts of justice, revenue offices, &c., supplemented in the provinces by municipal governments, county governments, parish or union governments—all of them more or less elaborated. By its side there grows up a highly complex religious organization, with its various grades of officials from archbishops down to sextons, its colleges, convocations, ecclesiastical courts, &c.; to all which must be added the ever-multiplying independent sects, each with its general and local authorities. And at the same time there is developed a highly complex aggregation of customs manners, and temporary fashions, enforced by society at large, and serving to control those minor transactions between man and man which are not regulated by civil and religious law. Moreover it is to be observed that this ever-increasing heterogeneity in the governmental appliances of each nation has been accompanied by an increasing heterogeneity in the governmental appliances of different nations, all of which are more or less unlike in their political systems and legislation, in their creeds and religious institutions, in their customs and ceremonial usages.\n\nSimultaneously there has been going on a second differentiation of a still more familiar kind; that, namely, by which the mass of the community has become segregated into distinct classes and orders of workers. While the governing part has been undergoing the complex development above described, the governed part has been undergoing an equally complex development, which has resulted in that minute division of labour characterizing advanced nations. It is needless to trace out this progress from its first stages, up through the caste divisions of the East and the incorporated guilds of Europe, to the elaborate producing and distributing organization existing among ourselves. Political economists have made familiar to all, the evolution which, beginning with a tribe whose members severally perform the same actions each for himself, ends with a civilized community whose members severally perform different actions for each other; and they have further explained the evolution through which the solitary producer of any one commodity, is transformed into a combination of producers who, united under a master, take separate parts in the manufacture of such commodity. But there are yet other and higher phases of this advance from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous in the industrial structure of the social organism. Long after considerable progress has been made in the division of labour among different classes of workers, there is still little or no division of labour among the widely separated parts of the community: the nation continues comparatively homogeneous in the respect that in each district the same occupations are pursued. But when roads and other means of transit become numerous and good, the different districts begin to assume different functions, and to become mutually dependent. The calico manufacture locates itself in this county, the woollen-cloth manufacture in that; silks are produced here, lace there; stockings in one place, shoes in another; pottery, hardware, cutlery, come to have their special towns; and ultimately every locality becomes more or less distinguished from the rest by the leading occupation carried on in it. Nay, more, this subdivision of functions shows itself not only among the different parts of the same nation, but among different nations. That exchange of commodities which free-trade promises so greatly to increase, will ultimately have the effect of specializing, in a greater or less degree, the industry of each people. So that beginning with a barbarous tribe, almost if not quite homogeneous in the functions of its members, the progress has been, and still is, towards an economic aggregation of the whole human race, growing ever more heterogeneous in respect of the separate functions assumed by separate nations, the separate functions assumed by the local sections of each nation, the separate functions assumed by the many kinds of makers and traders in each town, and the separate functions assumed by the workers united in producing each commodity.\n\nNot only is the law thus clearly exemplified in the evolution of the social organism, but it is exemplified with equal clearness in the evolution of all products of human thought and action; whether concrete or abstract, real or ideal. . . .\n\nWe might trace out the evolution of Science; beginning with the era in which it was not yet differentiated from Art, and was, in union with Art, the handmaid of Religion; passing through the era in which the sciences were so few and rudimentary as to be simultaneously cultivated by the same philosophers; and ending with the era in which the genera and species are so numerous that few can enumerate them, and no one can adequately grasp even one genus. Or we might do the like with Architecture, with the Drama, with Dress. But doubtless the reader is already weary of illustrations; and our promise has been amply fulfilled. We believe we have shown beyond question, that that which the German physiologists have found to be the law of organic development, is the law of all development. The advance from the simple to the complex, through a process of successive differentiations, is seen alike in the earliest changes of the Universe to which we can reason our way back, and in the earliest changes which we can inductively establish; it is seen in the geologic and climatic evolution of the Earth, and of every single organism on its surface; it is seen in the evolution of Humanity, whether contemplated in the civilized individual, or in the aggregation of races; it is seen in the evolution of Society in respect both of its political and economical organization; and it is seen in the evolution of all those endless concrete and abstract products of human activity which constitute the environment of our daily life. From the remotest past which Science can fathom, down to the novelties of yesterday, that in which Progress essentially consists, is the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous.\n\nHerbert Spencer, “Progress: Its Law and Causes,” Westminster Review, vol. 67 (April 1857), pp. 445–47, 451, 454–56, 464–65.\n\nPope Pius IX, The “Syllabus of Errors” (1864)\n\nIn an attempt to assert the power of the Church in the face of increasing political turmoil in Europe, the pope issued a series of declarations which would eventually lead to the Kulturkampf, or conflict between the Church and the government. The “Syllabus of Errors” was issued in 1864 as a list of what were, in the pope's opinion, the worst problems of the time. Each statement represents the exact opposite of the pope's actual belief.\n\nThe syllabus of the principal errors of our time, which are stigmatized in the consistorial allocutions, encyclicals, and other apostolical letters of our Most Holy Father, Pope Pius IX:\n\n15. Every man is free to embrace and profess the religion he shall believe true, guided by the light of reason.\n\n16. Men may in any religion find the way of eternal salvation, and obtain eternal salvation.\n\n18. Protestantism is nothing more than another form of the same true Christian religion, in which it is possible to be equally pleasing to God as in the Catholic Church.\n\n20. The ecclesiastical power must not exercise its authority without the permission and assent of the civil government.\n\n24. The Church has not the power of availing herself of force, or any direct or indirect temporal power.\n\n39. The commonwealth is the origin and source of all rights, and possesses rights which are not circumscribed by any limits.\n\n41. The civil power, even when exercised by an unbelieving sovereign, possesses an indirect and negative power over religious affairs.\n\n42. In the case of conflicting laws between the two powers, the civil law ought to prevail.\n\n43. The civil power has a right to break, and to declare and render null, the conventions (commonly called Concordats) concluded with the Apostolic See, relative to the exercise of rights pertaining to the ecclesiastical immunity, without the consent of the Holy See, and even contrary to its protests.\n\n44. The civil authority may interfere in matters relating to religion, morality, and spiritual government.\n\n47. The most approved theory of civil society requires that popular schools open to the children of all classes, and, generally, all public institutes intended for instruction in letters and philosophy, and for conducting the education of the young, should be freed from all ecclesiastical authority, government, and interference, and should be completely subject to the civil and political power, in conformity with the will of rulers and the prevalent opinions of the age.\n\n48. This system of instructing youth, which consists in separating it from the Catholic faith and from the power of the Church, and in teaching exclusively, or at least primarily, the knowledge of natural things and the earthly ends of social life alone, may be approved by Catholics.\n\n53. The laws for the protection of religious establishments, and securing their rights and duties, ought to be abolished; nay, more, the civil government may lend its assistance to all who desire to quit the religious life they have undertaken, and to break their vows. The government may also suppress religious orders.\n\n55. The Church ought to be separated from the State, and the State from the Church.\n\n63. It is allowable to refuse obedience to legitimate princes; nay, more, to rise in insurrection against them.\n\n79. Moreover, it is false that the civil freedom granted to every mode of worship, and the full power given to all of overtly and publicly manifesting their opinions and their ideas, whatsoever their nature, conduce more easily to corrupt the morals and minds of the people, and facilitate the propagation of the pest of indifferentism.\n\n80. The Roman Pontiff can and ought to reconcile himself to, and agree with, progress, liberalism, and civilization, as lately introduced.\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 178–80.\n\nEyewitness Account of the Siege of Paris (1870/71)\n\nThe siege of Paris—September 19, 1870 to January 28, 1871—brought about the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War and ultimately led to German unification and the establishment of the German Empire. The empire of Napoleon III came to an end at Sedan in 1870 but the Germans pushed on to occupy the city of Paris. This account is by a Mr. Whitehurst, an Englishman who was in Paris during the siege.\n\nThursday, December 29 [1870]. The bombardment is going on in a desultory fashion, but the two days have cost the French about a hundred and fifty killed and wounded. It seems that the officers suffer out of all proportion. At Avron the loss was considerable, and four officers were killed. A horrible episode marked the history of the bombardment of the opening day. A Colonel Heintzler and his wife were giving breakfast at Avron to several friends, a servant being in the room. One of the guests was laughing with the hostess, and said, “No butter, certainly, but there may be a shell in its place, and—” As he spoke a shell burst in the room, killed six of the party, wounded severely the host and hostess, and only the doctor of the regiment and the servant got off unscathed. The remains of the six came just now to the Val de Grace hospital, but it was such a human ruin that no individuality could be recognized. The Prussians are firing with eighty guns, some of them being 112-pounders, and ranging from three miles and a half to four miles.\n\nMore curious facts of this startling siege: Mr. Geisling, one of the great “scullers” of the Seine, and well known here in connection with Church and Charity, is in [the regiment known as] the Mobiles of the Seine. On Christmas Eve he was on duty within five or six hundred yards of the Prussian lines, and the rifle shots—odd compliments of the season—were mutually passing like good wishes at a friendly party. At midnight he left the trenches, advanced to the Prussian lines, and sang a Christmas hymn. The Prussians ceased firing, and did not recommence till the Anglo-Frenchman finished and coolly retreated into his own lines. . . .\n\nA gentleman sent yesterday to his butcher’s for any possible scraps for his two favorite cats; the answer was this: “We will give no food to any cats, but we will buy any cats to sell for food.” M. Deboos, the butcher of the Boulevard Haussmann, has just paid one thousand and eighty pounds for three of the elephants of the Jardlin des Plantes, which he proposes to kill, cut up, and sell at sixteen and eightpence a pound as “boeuf de siège.” This will keep certain cooks of certain capitalists employed perhaps for ten days, but it certainly will not benefit the poor and needy; and had the government been that which they are not, they would really have taken all meat, normal and abnormal, to themselves and served out “rations”; as it is, their system is absurd and the result a failure. If we are really reduced to kill the elephants, the omnibus horses, and cut down the trees on the boulevards Champs-Elysées, and the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes, is it not time (having little else) to eat humble pie? Why not do on the 1st of January what you must do on the 1st of March, and so save two months’ battle, murder, starvation, and sudden death? . . .\n\n[March 1, 1871.] The troops were to enter Paris at 10 a.m., but at 8.30 a.m. five-and-twenty of those wonderful Uhlans approached the celebrated Arc de Triomphe, and the leader, waving his sword, jumped the chain and took possession of Paris. Later two thousand men of all arms came and held the Palais d’Industrie and the Place de la Concorde, where French absurdity had veiled with black “crêpe” the faces of the “Cities of France,” which caused them exactly to resemble the widows of nigger melodists, and ridiculous enough to make an angel weep under the circumstances. When the absurdity was exhibited to one Prussian it did, through some operation by the surgeon of his regiment, cause him to smile!\n\nThen occurred several hours of most unnecessary cruelty. It is needless to say that the French no more stayed at home, as they “proclaimed” others should do, then Favre kept his inch of earth or Ducrot his promise to conquer or die. In fact, there were more French in the Champs-Elysees than there had been since the fatal Fourth! Now Prussia must have known that the wild “red” blood of Paris was mad with an impotent and insane desire to go on fighting, and as North Germany was so utterly triumphant she might have spared irritation to an already much tried and overexcited people. But no! Vae victis! [Woe to the conquered!] was the order of the day, and so for hours little billeting parties paraded the quarter of Paris bordered on one side by the Seine, and on the other by the Rue du Faubourg-St-Honoré, with maps and ready-made billet papers displayed with unnecessary ceremony. Small sections of men, too, were posted just wherever the Parisians must see them, and every now and again three Uhlans—or an Hussar with his orderly—walked past, saluting a line officer who swaggered about with a victorious and most trying assumption of dignity.\n\nOf course I ought to be very enthusiastic or very downcast about this fall of Paris, but I was neither. Any military spectacle is splendid to a man who is as fond of soldiers as I am, and I will admit that since I saw the army of Sadowa defile [parade] before the Sultan, I have not looked on such good, well-drilled, military machines, —none of your republican independence here!\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 208–10.\n\nThe German Social-Democratic Gotha Program (1875)\n\n1. Labor is the source of all wealth and of all civilization; and since it is only through society that generally productive labor is possible, the whole product of labor, where there is a general obligation to work, belongs to society, —that is, to all its members, by equal right, and to each according to his reasonable needs.\n\nIn the society of today the means of production are a monopoly of the capitalistic class; the dependence of the working class, which results from this, is the cause of misery and servitude in all its forms.\n\nThe emancipation of labor requires the conversion of the means of production into the common property of society and the social regulation of all labor and its application for the general good, together with the just distribution of the product of labor.\n\nThe emancipation of labor must be the work of the laboring class itself, opposed to which all other classes are reactionary groups.\n\n2. Proceeding from these principles, the socialist labor party of Germany endeavors by every lawful means to bring about a free State and a socialistic society, to effect the destruction of the iron law of wages by doing away with the system of wage labor, to abolish exploitation of every kind, and to extinguish all social and political inequality.\n\nThe socialist labor party of Germany, although for the time being confining its activity within national bounds, is fully conscious of the international character of the labor movement, and is resolved to meet all the obligations which this lays upon the laborer, in order to bring the brotherhood of all mankind to a full realization.\n\nThe socialist labor party of Germany, in order to prepare the way for the solution of the social question, demands the establishment of socialistic productive associations with the support of the State and under the democratic control of the working people. These productive associations, for both industry and agriculture, are to be created to such an extent that the socialistic organization of all labor may result therefrom.\n\n[In addition to the demand for universal suffrage for all above twenty years of age, secret ballot, freedom of the press, free and compulsory education, etc.,] the socialist labor party of Germany demands the following reforms in the present social organization: (1) the greatest possible extension of political rights and freedom in the sense of the above-mentioned demands; (2) a single progressive income tax, both State and local, instead of all the existing taxes, especially the indirect ones, which weigh heavily upon the people; (3) unlimited right of association; (4) a normal working day corresponding with the needs of society, and the prohibition of work on Sunday; (5) prohibition of child labor and all forms of labor by women which are dangerous to health or morality; (6) laws for the protection of the life and health of workmen, sanitary control of workmen’s houses, inspection of mines, factories, workshops, and domestic industries by officials chosen by the workmen themselves, and an effective system of enforcement of the same; (7) regulation of prison labor.\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 493–95.\n\nAlexander II’s Proclamation to the Bulgarians (1877)\n\nMy troops, having crossed the Danube, will to-day enter your territory upon which they have already fought more than once for the amelioration of the condition of the Christian inhabitants of the Balkan Peninsula. My ancestors, faithful to their ancient and historical traditions, ever gathering fresh strength from the intimate union which had for centuries united them to the orthodox population, succeeded, by their influence and their arms, in securing the present position of the Servians and the Roumanians by summoning them to a new political existence. Time and circumstances have not altered the sympathies of Russia for her co-religionists in the East. She nourishes ever the same affection, the same solicitude towards all the members of the great Christian family of the Balkan Peninsula. . . .\n\nInhabitants of Bulgaria! The aim of Russia is to build up, not to destroy. She is called by the decrees of Providence to pacify and conciliate all races and all denominations in the Bulgarian territory, which is inhabited by people of various origin and belief. Henceforward the arms of Russia will protect all Christians against violence of all kind; no attack will be made by any one with impunity upon either their persons or their property; every crime will be followed by punishment; the life, liberty, honor, and property of every Christian will be equally guaranteed, to whatever sect he may belong. Vengeance will not guide our actions; a sentiment of strict equity will alone preside over them, as well as the firm intention of developing order and law in regions where disorder and despotism are now rampant.\n\nAnd to you, Mussulmans [Muslims] of Bulgaria, I address a salutary warning. It is painful for me to evoke the memory of the crimes and violence of which many of you have been guilty toward defenseless Christians. These horrors cannot be forgotten, but the Russian authorities do not wish to hold all responsible for the crimes of a few. A regular and impartial administration of justice will overtake only the criminals who have remained unpunished, although their names were perfectly well known to our government. Recognize to-day that it is the justice of God which overtakes you; bend before his will; submit yourselves to the lawful demands of the authorities who will be appointed whenever my troops appear; become peaceful citizens of a society which is ready to accord to you the benefits of a regular organization. Your religion will remain to you intact; your existence, your property, the life and property of your families, will be held sacred by us.\n\nChristians of Bulgaria! You are passing through a memorable period. The hour of deliverance from Mussulman despotism has at length struck. Give the world an illustration of Christian love; forget former internal dissensions, and respect scrupulously the legitimate rights of each nationality; unite yourselves, as brothers in religion, in a sentiment of concord and brotherly love, which alone offers foundations, for a solid and lasting edifice; gather closely under the shadow of the Russian flag, whose victories have so often resounded upon the Danube and among the Balkans. As the Russian troops advance into the interior of the country, the Turkish rule will be replaced by a regular organization, the native inhabitants will be at once summoned to take an active part therein under the supreme direction of special and newly appointed authorities. Obey the Russian authorities. Follow their directions faithfully. Therein lies your strength and your safety.\n\nWith humility I beseech the Lord to grant us the victory over the enemy of the Christians, and to send down his blessing upon our just cause.\n\nALEXANDER\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 395–96.\n\nThe Treaty of Berlin (1878)\n\nart. 1. Bulgaria is constituted an autonomous and tributary principality under suzerainty of his Imperial Majesty the Sultan; it shall have a Christian government and a national militia. . . .\n\nart. 3. The prince of Bulgaria shall be freely elected by the population and confirmed by the Sublime Porte [the government of the Ottoman empire] with the assent of the [European] powers.\n\nart. 4. An assembly of notables of Bulgaria, convoked at Tirnovo, shall, before the election of the prince, draw up the organic law of the Principality. . . .\n\nart. 9. The amount of the annual tribute which the Principality of Bulgaria shall pay to the Suzerain Court—such amount being paid into whatever bank the Porte may hereafter designate—shall be fixed by an agreement between the powers signatory of the present treaty at the close of the first year of the working of the new organization. . . .\n\nart. 13. A province shall be formed south of the Balkans which shall take the name of “Eastern Roumelia,” and shall remain under the direct political and military authority of his Imperial Majesty the Sultan, under conditions of administrative autonomy. It shall have a Christian governor general. . . .\n\nart. 25. The provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall be occupied and administered by Austria-Hungary.\n\nart. 26.

The high contracting parties recognize the independence of Roumania subject to the conditions set forth in the two following articles on civil and religious liberty]. . . ,\n\nart. 58. The Sublime Porte cedes to the Russian emperor in Asia the territories of Ardahan, Kars, and Batum, together with the latter port, as well as all the territories comprised between the former Russo-Turkish frontier and the following line [drawn roughly about forty miles to the south of the old Russian boundary]. . . .\n\nart. 62. The Sublime Porte having expressed the intention to maintain the principle of religious liberty and give it the widest scope, the contracting parties take note of this spontaneous declaration. In no part of the Ottoman Empire shall difference of religion be alleged against any person as a ground for exclusion or incapacity as regards the discharge of civil and political rights, admission to the public employments, functions, and honors, or the exercise of the various professions and industries. All persons shall be admitted without distinction of religion to give evidence before the tribunals. The freedom and outward exercise of all forms of worship are assured to all.\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 397–98.\n\nLetter of the Revolutionary Committee to Alexander III (1881)\n\nRepeated attempts were made on the life of Tsar Alexander II: in 1866, 1879 (twice), and 1880. In March 1881, he was assassinated by a member of the radical group Narodnaya Volya (People's Will). He was succeeded by his son, Alexander III. Shortly afterward, the Revolutionary Committee addressed Alexander III, proposing that Alexander either allow the people a voice in the “framework of social and governmental life,” or face repeated acts of terrorism and a revolution.\n\nMarch 10, 1881\n\nYour Majesty:\n\nAlthough the Executive Committee understands fully the grief that you must experience at this moment, it believes that it has no right to yield to the feeling of natural delicacy which would perhaps dictate the postponement of the following explanation to another time. There is something higher than the most legitimate human feeling, and that is, duty to one’s country, —the duty for which a citizen must sacrifice himself and his own feelings, and even the feelings of others. In obedience to this all-powerful duty we have decided to address you at once, waiting for nothing, as will wait for nothing the historical process that threatens us with rivers of blood and the most terrible convulsions. . . .\n\nYou are aware, your Majesty, that the government of the late Tsar could not be reproached with a lack of energy. It hanged the innocent and the guilty, and filled prisons and remote provinces with exiles. Scores of so-called “leaders” were captured and hanged, and died with the courage and tranquility of martyrs; but the movement did not cease, —on the contrary it grew and strengthened. The revolutionary movement, your Majesty, is not dependent upon any particular individuals; it is a process of the social organism; and the scaffolds raised for its more energetic exponents are as powerless to save the outgrown order of things as the cross that was erected for the Redeemer was powerless to save the ancient world from the triumph of Christianity. The government, of course, may yet capture and hang an immense number of separate individuals, it may break up a great number of separate revolutionary groups; but all this will not change, in the slightest degree, the condition of affairs. . . .\n\nA dispassionate glance at the grievous decade through which we have just passed will enable us to forecast accurately the future progress of the revolutionary movement, provided the policy of the government does not change. The movement will continue to grow and extend; deeds of a terroristic nature will increase in frequency and intensity. Meanwhile the number of the discontented in the country will grow larger and larger; confidence in the government, on the part of the people, will decline; and the idea of revolution—of its possibility, and inevitability—will establish itself in Russia more and more firmly. A terrible explosion, a bloody chaos, a revolutionary earthquake throughout Russia, will complete the destruction of the old order of things. Do not mistake this for a mere phrase. We understand better than any one else can how lamentable is the waste of so much talent and energy—the loss, in bloody skirmishes and in the work of destruction, of so much strength which, under other conditions, might have been expended in creative labor and in the development of the intelligence, the welfare, and the civil life of the Russian people. Whence proceeds this lamentable necessity for bloody conflict?\n\nIt arises, your Majesty, from the lack in Russia of a real government in the true sense of that word. A government, in the very nature of things, should only give outward form to the aspirations of the people and effect to the people’s will. But with us—excuse the expression—the government has degenerated into a mere coterie, and deserves the name of a usurping “gang” much more than does the Executive Committee.\n\nWhatever may be the intentions of the Tsar, the actions of the government have nothing in common with the popular welfare or popular aspirations. The government has brought Russia to such a pass that, at the present time, the masses of the people are in a state of pauperism and ruin; are subjected to the most humiliating surveillance, even at their own domestic hearths; and are powerless even to regulate their own communal and social affairs. The protection of the law and of the government is enjoyed only by the extortionist and the exploiter, and the most exasperating robbery goes unpunished. But, on the other hand, what a terrible fate awaits the man who sincerely considers the general good! You know very well, your Majesty, that it is not only socialists who are exiled and prosecuted.\n\nThese are the reasons why the Russian government exerts no moral influence and has no support among the people. These are the reasons why Russia brings forth so many revolutionists. These are the reasons why even such a deed as killing a Tsar excites in the minds of a majority of the people only gladness and sympathy. Yes, your Majesty! Do not be deceived by the reports of flatterers and sycophants; Tsaricide is popular in Russia.\n\nFrom such a state of affairs there can be only two modes of escape: either a revolution, —absolutely inevitable and not to be averted by any punishments; or a voluntary turning of the supreme power to the people. In the interest of our native land, in the hope of preventing the useless waste of energy, in the hope of averting the terrible miseries that always accompany revolution, the Executive Committee approaches your Majesty with the advice to take the second course. Be assured, so soon as the supreme power ceases to rule arbitrarily, so soon as it firmly resolves to accede to the demands of the people’s conscience and consciousness, you may, without fear, discharge the spies that disgrace the administration, send your guards back to their barracks, and burn the scaffolds that are demoralizing the people. The Executive Committee will voluntarily terminate its own existence, and the organizations formed about it will disperse, in order that their members may devote themselves to the work of promoting culture among the people of their native land.\n\nWe address your Majesty as those who have discarded all prejudices, and who have suppressed the distrust of you created by the actions of the government throughout a century. We forget that you are the representative of the authority that has so often deceived and that has so injured the people. We address you as a citizen and as an honest man. We hope that the feeling of personal exasperation will not extinguish in your mind your consciousness of your duties and your desire to know the truth. We also might feel exasperation. You have lost your father. We have lost not only our fathers, but our brothers, our wives, our children, and our dearest friends. We are nevertheless ready to suppress personal feeling if it be demanded by the welfare of Russia. We expect the same from you.\n\nWe set no conditions for you; do not let our proposition irritate you. The conditions that are prerequisite to a change from revolutionary activity to peaceful labor are created, not by us, but by history. These conditions are, in our opinion, two.\n\n1. A general amnesty to cover all past political crimes; for the reason that they were not crimes but fulfillments of civil duty.\n\n2. The summoning of representatives of the whole Russian people to examine the existing framework of social and governmental life, and to remodel it in accordance with the people’s wishes.\n\nWe regard it as necessary, however, to remind you that the legalization of the supreme power, by the representatives of the people, can be valid only in case the elections are perfectly free. We declare solemnly, before the people of our native land and before the whole world, that our party will submit unconditionally to the decisions of a National Assembly elected in the manner above indicated, and that we will not allow ourselves, in future, to offer violent resistance to any government that the National Assembly may sanction.\n\nAnd now, your Majesty, decide! Before you are two courses, and you are to make your choice between them. We can only trust that your intelligence and conscience may suggest to you the only decision that is compatible with the welfare of Russia, with your own dignity, and with your duty to your native land.\n\nTHE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 364–67.\n\nEmile Zola, “J’accuse!” (January 13, 1898)\n\nIn 1894, Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish artillery officer in the French army, was arrested and accused of treason. After an unfair trial, Dreyfus was convicted under false pretexts and sent to Devil’s Island the following year. Emile Zola’s four-thousand-word article “J’accuse!” appeared in L’Aurore, a French literary newspaper.\n\nMr. President:\n\nWill you permit me, in my gratitude for the kindly welcome that you once extended to me, to show my regard for the glory that is rightfully yours, and to say to you that your honor, so bright hitherto, is threatened with the most shameful, the most indelible of stains? You have emerged from base calumnies safe and sound; you have conquered our hearts. You seem radiant in that patriotic fête which the Russian alliance has been for France, and you are preparing to preside at the solemn triumph of our Universal Exposition, which will crown our great century of labor, truth, and liberty. But what a mud stain on your name — I was going to say on your reign—is this abominable Dreyfus affair! A council of war has just dared to acquit an Esterhazy in obedience to orders, —a final blow at all truth, at all justice. And now it is done! France has this stain upon her cheek; it will be written in history that under your presidency it was possible for this social crime to be committed.\n\nSince they have dared, I too will dare. I will tell the truth, for I have promised to tell it, if the courts, once regularly appealed to, did not bring it out fully and entirely. It is my duty to speak; I will not be an accomplice. My nights would be haunted by the specter of the innocent man who is atoning, in a far-away country, by the most frightful of tortures, for a crime that he did not commit.\n\nAnd to you, Mr. President, will I proclaim this truth, with all the force of an honest man’s revolt. Your honor convinces me that you are ignorant of it. To whom, indeed, should I denounce the malevolent gang of the really guilty, if not to you, the first magistrate of the country?\n\nFirst, the truth as to the trial and conviction of Dreyfus.\n\nA calamitous man has managed it all, has done it all—Colonel du Paty de Clam, then a simple major. He is the entire Dreyfus case; it will be fully known only when a sincere investigation shall have clearly established his acts and his responsibility. He appears as the most heady, the most intricate, of characters, haunted with romantic intrigues, delighting in the methods of the newspaper novel, —stolen papers, anonymous letters, meetings in lonely spots, mysterious women who convey overwhelming proofs by night. It is he who conceived the idea of dictating the bordereau to Dreyfus; it is he who dreamed of studying it in a room completely lined with mirrors; it is he whom Major Forzinetti represents to us armed with a dark lantern, trying to gain access to the accused when asleep, in order to throw a sudden flood of light upon his face, and thus surprise a confession of his crime in the confusion of his awakening. And I need not say more. I simply claim that Major du Paty de Clam, intrusted as a judicial officer with the duty of preparing the Dreyfus case, is, in the order of dates and responsibility, the leading person among those guilty of the fearful judicial error that has been committed. . . .\n\nThe Dreyfus case was a case for the war office, —a staff officer accused by his staff comrades, convicted under the pressure of the chiefs of staff. Accordingly he cannot come back innocent unless all the staff is proved guilty. Consequently the war offices, by all imaginable means, by press campaigns, by communications, by influence, have protected Esterhazy only to ruin Dreyfus a second time. Ah! with what a sweep should the republican government clear away this band of Jesuits, as General Billot himself calls them! Where is the truly strong and wisely patriotic minister who will dare to reshape and renew all? How many of the people I know are trembling in view of a possible war, knowing in what hands lies the national defense! And what a nest of base intrigues, gossip, and corruption has this sacred protector, intrusted with the fate of the country, become! We are frightened by the terrible light thrown upon it by the Dreyfus case, this human sacrifice of an unfortunate man, of a “dirty Jew.” Ah! What a mixture of madness and folly, of crazy fancies, of low police practices, of inquisitorial and tyrannical customs, the good pleasure of a few persons in gold lace, with their feet on the neck of the nation, cramming back into its throat its cry of truth and justice under the lying and sacrilegious pretext of the raison d’etat!\n\nAnother of their crimes is that they have accepted the support of the filthy press, have suffered themselves to be championed by all the knavery of Paris, so that we now witness knavery’s insolent triumph in the downfall of right and simple probity. It is a crime to accuse of troubling France those who wish to see her generous, and place her at the head of free and just nations. It is a crime to mislead public opinion, to rouse it to a delirium with a view of compassing this man’s death. It is a crime to poison the minds of the lowly and the humble, to exasperate the passions of reaction and intolerance, while seeking shelter behind odious anti-Semitism, which, if not suppressed, will destroy the great liberal France of the Rights of Man. It is crime to exploit patriotism for works of hatred, and, finally, it is a crime to make the sword the modern god, when all human science is at work on the coming temple of truth and justice. . . .\n\nSuch, then, is the simple truth, Mr. President, and it is frightful. It will remain a stain upon your presidency. I suspect that you are powerless in this matter, —that you are the prisoner of the constitution and of your environment. You have none the less a man’s duty, upon which you will reflect, and which you will fulfill. Not indeed that I despair of triumph. I repeat with more vehement certainty, truth is now in motion, and nothing can stop it. Today sees the real beginning of the affair, since not until today have the two opposing parties met face to face: on one hand, the guilty, who do not want the light; on the other, the doers of justice, who will give their lives to get it. When truth is buried in the earth it accumulates there, and assumes so mighty an explosive power that, on the day when it bursts forth, it hurls everything into the air. We shall see whether its enemies have not merely prepared the way for the most appalling disaster yet to come.\n\nBut this letter is too long, Mr. President, and it is time to finish.\n\nI accuse Lieutenant Colonel du Paty de Clam of having been the diabolical author of judicial error, —unconsciously, I am willing to believe, —and of having then defended his fatal work, for three years, by the most guilty machinations.\n\nI accuse General Mercier of having made himself an accomplice, at least through feebleness of mind, in one of the greatest iniquities of the century.\n\nI accuse General Billot of having had in his hands certain proofs of the innocence of Dreyfus, and of having suppressed them; of having rendered himself guilty of this crime of lèse-humanité and lèse-justice [roughly, crimes against humanity and justice] for a political purpose, and to save the compromised staff.\n\nI accuse General de Boisdeifre and General Gonse of having made themselves accomplices in the same crime, one undoubtedly through clerical passion, the other perhaps through that esprit de corps which makes of the war office the unassailable ark of the covenant.\n\nI accuse General de Pellieux and Major Ravary of having conducted a rascally inquiry, —I mean by that, a monstrously partial inquiry, of which we have, in the report of the latter, an imperishable monument of naive audacity.\n\nI accuse the three experts in handwriting, Belhomme, Varinard, and Couard, of having made lying and fraudulent reports, unless a medical examination should prove them to be afflicted with diseases of the eye and of the mind.\n\nI accuse the war office of having carried on in the newspapers, particularly in L’Éclair and in L’Écho de Paris, an abominable campaign, to mislead opinion and cover up their faults.\n\nI accuse, finally, the first council of war of having violated the law by condemning an accused person on the strength of a secret document, and I accuse the second council of war of having covered up this illegality, in obedience to orders, in committing in its turn the judicial crime of knowingly acquitting a guilty man.\n\nIn preferring these charges I am not unaware that I lay myself liable under Articles 30 and 31 of the press law of July 29, 1881, which punishes slander. I consciously expose myself to the provisions of the law.\n\nAs for the people whom I accuse, I do not know them; I have never seen them; I entertain against them no feeling of revenge or hatred. They are to me simple entities, enemies of the social welfare. And the act that I perform here is nothing but a revolutionary measure to hasten the triumph of truth and justice. I have but one passion, the passion for the light, in the name of humanity which has suffered so much, and which is entitled to happiness. My vehement protest is simply the cry of my soul. Let them dare, then, to bring me into the court of assizes, but let the investigation take place in the open day. I await it.\n\nAccept, Mr. President, the assurance of my profound respect.\n\nEMILE ZOLA\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 219–23.\n\nThe Fabian Program of Reform (c. 1900)\n\nA group of English socialists and intellectuals founded the Fellowship of the New Life in 1883, which became the Fabian Society in 1898. Members included Havelock Ellis, G. B. Shaw, H. G. Wells, and Emmeline Pankhurst. The society was dominated by Sydney and Beatrice Webb and was predicated on the idea that an elite group of reformers would “engineer” society for the improvement of humanity.\n\nThe policy of the “national minimum” translates itself into four main branches of legislative and executive activity. There will have to be a national minimum of wages. The trusts, or the other employers, will be under no legal obligation to employ any person whatsoever. But if they do employ him or her, it will be a condition of every contract, not to be waived or ignored, that its terms shall not be such as will impair the efficiency of the citizen or diminish the vitality of the race. To engage labor at wages insufficient to repair the waste of tissue caused by the employment is demonstrably to injure the community as a whole, and will be prosecuted as such in the criminal courts. Those whose labor is not worth the national minimum—the aged, the crippled, and the blind; the mentally or morally deficient; the epileptic; and the chronically feckless and feeble-minded—will be maintained by the community, as indeed they are now. But of all the ways of maintaining those unable to earn a full livelihood, by far the most costly and injurious is to allow them to compete in the labor market, and thus to drag down by their infirmity those who are whole. There are still people, of course, who simply cannot imagine how a legal minimum wage could possibly be enforced, just as there were, sixty years ago, economists who demonstrated the impossibility of factory laws. As a matter of fact, the legal minimum wage can be seen in force today in Victoria and New Zealand, South Australia, and New South Wales.\n\nThere will be a national minimum of leisure and recreation secured by law to every citizen, it will be an implied condition of every contract of employment, rigidly enforced by law, that it shall leave untouched sixteen hours out of each twenty-four for needful sleep, recreation, exercise of mind or body, and the duties of citizenship and family life. Any attempt by man or woman to sell for wages any part of the sixteen sacred hours will be blamed as virtual embezzlement, since this part of the twenty-four-hours day must be regarded as necessarily reserved for the purpose of maintaining unimpaired the efficiency of the race. Any employer purchasing them, or allowing them to be spent in his mill or mine, will be prosecuted and punished, as if he had incited to embezzlement or had received stolen goods.\n\nThere will be a national minimum of sanitation, enforced public not merely on land or house owners or occupiers, but also on local governing authorities. The nation will find it preposterous that any city, merely out of stupidity or incapacity or parsimony, should foster disease, or bring up its quota of citizens in a condition of impaired vitality. The power of the community as a whole will, somehow or other, be brought to bear upon every backward district, compelling it to introduce pure water, to improve its drainage, and to take such action, even by municipal building if need be, that no family in the land shall have less than three rooms and a scullery, as the minimum required for health and decency. Along with this must go the adequate provision of medical attendance, skilled nursing and hospital accommodation for the sick. Within a generation of the adoption of such a policy the death rate and sickness experience would show a reduction of one third of what is at present endured as if it were the decree of Providence.\n\nThere will be a national minimum of education—not merely in the provision of schools, but in genuinely compulsory attendance at them. Besides schools and colleges of every grades there will have to be an adequate “scholarship ladder,” securing free tuition, right up to the post-graduate course, for every scholar proving himself or herself fitted for anything beyond common schooling. And this provision will be enforced by the national power upon local school authorities as well as upon parents and employers. What right has any part of the community to allow any part of its quota of citizens to be reared in ignorance or to suffer even one potential genius to be lost to the community? The next few years will see not only a great improvement in common schooling but also the doubling or trebling of our expenditure on higher education.\n\nOnly by the enforcement of some such national minimum of subsistence, leisure, sanitation, and education will modern industrial communities escape degeneration and decay. Where life is abandoned to unfettered competition, what is known as Gresham’s law applies, —the bad drives out the good. To prevent this evil result is, as both Europe and America are discovering in the twentieth century, the main function of government.\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 495–97.\n\nProclamation Inciting a Jewish Pogrom (1903)\n\nThis proclamation appeared in the journal Bessarabetz on the eve of a pogrom in Kishenev in Bessarabia in the spring of 1903. It urged all faithful Christians to kill all the Jews, who were not only held responsible for the death of Christ but were also considered the true fomenters of revolution in Russia. The increase in pogroms at the end of the nineteenth century followed the assassination of Alexander II in 1881.\n\nFellow-Christians:\n\nOur great festival of the Resurrection of Christ draws near. It is many years since, put to death by the Jews, Our Lord expiated by his blood our sins and those of all the world, pouring out in his mercy his holy blood for the salvation of all the nations of the earth, of us Christians as well as the adherents of other religions.\n\nBut the vile Jews are content with having shed the blood of our Savior, whom they crucified, and who suffered for them. Every year they shed the innocent blood of Christians. They shed it and use it in their religious rites.\n\nYou have doubtless been told that at Dubossari they crucified a Christian youth, whose blood they offered in sacrifice. The story is quite correct. The authorities know it too, though they do not breathe a word in order not to excite our anger against these miserable, bloodthirsty men who should have been driven out of our country long ago. A similar case has just occurred at Kief, where they bled to death an innocent child and afterwards threw its body into the street.\n\nAt the present moment, whilst we are preparing to celebrate the Passion of our Lord, they are drinking Christian blood among themselves. Brothers, we are overcome with horror when we think of the number of Christian souls lost through them for many years.\n\nThey aspire to seize our beloved Russia. They issue proclamations in order to incite the people against the authorities, even against our Little Father, the Tsar, who knows them for a cowardly, vile, rapacious people, and will not give them liberty. They try, therefore, to provoke disturbances by which they hope to obtain more liberties for themselves. Now, if liberty is granted to the Jew, he will speedily become master of Holy Russia, lay his greedy hands on everything, and there will no longer be a Russia, but only a Jewry left.\n\nBrothers, in the name of our Savior who gave his blood for us, in the name of our very pious Little Father, the Tsar, who watches over the wants of his people, and alleviates their lot by generous manifestoes, let us join on Easter Day in the cry, “Down with the Jews!” Let us massacre these sanguinary monsters who slake their thirst with Russian blood!\n\nAct in such a manner that they will remember the pogrom [i.e., massacre] of Odessa, where the troops themselves assisted the people. This time they will again aid us, inspired as they are, like ourselves, with the love of Christ.\n\nBrothers, lend us your aid. Let us massacre these vile Jews. We are already numerous.\n\nTHE PartY OF THE WORKINGMEN WHO ARE TRUE CHRISTIANS\n\nP. S. Make your visitors read this, or else your establishment will be sacked. We shall be kept informed of this by those of us who go amongst you.\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 371–72.\n\nReport on German Welfare (1904)\n\nThere is little doubt that the German Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck (1815–1898) detested the Social Democrats. In an effort to woo the working classes away from socialism, Bismarck favored government intervention. Before his resignation in 1890, Bismarck was able to carry through a series of insurance laws for the benefit of the working classes. In this report the German government gave a full account of the success of these welfare proposals.\n\nThe minimum of relief in case of sickness entitles the beneficiary to free medical treatment and medicine for 26 weeks; and in case of incapacity for work, financial assistance to the extent of one half of the average daily wage, or to free hospital nursing, besides one half of the allowance for those dependent on the sick person. Further, it entitles sick women to relief for six months after their confinement; and in case of death, burial money amounting to twenty times their average daily wage.\n\nThe necessary means are raised by weekly contributions (not higher than four per cent of the average wage), two thirds of which is borne by the insured and one third by the employer. The administration is carried out through sickness clubs organized according to trades or localities, whose presiding officers are chosen from the insured and the employers according to the ratio of the contributions. The insurance against sickness embraces (inclusive of the miners’ clubs) about ten million persons in more than twenty thousand clubs, and involves an annual expenditure of about 200 million marks.\n\nInsurance against accidents replaces the old law of Employers’ Liability (its many defects being equally harmful to employer and employed) by a legal provision, which also insures the person injured, or his survivors, in cases of casual accidents, or such as have occurred through the fault of his co-workers, or through his own carelessness. The personal liability of the employer is thus changed into an economical charge upon the entire trade concerned, which is apportioned to single establishments according to the measure of their risk.\n\nThe minimum indemnity against accidents comprises: (1) in the case of wounded persons (from the commencement of the fourteenth week after the accident, that is to say, as a supplement to the sickness insurance) the expenses of medical treatment, and a payment during the period of incapacity for work up to two-thirds of the annual earnings, or free nursing in an institute until medical treatment is no longer necessary, and the same allowance to those dependent on the injured person as in case of death; (2) in case of death, funeral money to the amount of the fifteenth part of annual salary, but in any case not less than fifty marks, and for those dependent on the deceased an allowance amounting to 60 per cent of the annual wage for widow and children, and to 20 per cent of same for necessitous parents. Up to the end of 1903 more than 1,000,000,000 marks were paid in indemnities for accidents.\n\nInsurance against disablement and old age, which was introduced on the first of January, 1891, by an imperial law (revised in 1899), completes the system of workmen’s insurance. The administrators of the insurance, which includes all branches of trade, are territorial insurance institutions, guaranteed by the State, whose self-administration is shared equally by the employer and employees. The insurance entitles those incapable of work to pensions without regard to age, and gives old age pensions to septuagenarians regardless of working ability. Further it assures return of subscriptions paid by insured women who marry before receiving a pension, to widows or orphans of those insured persons who die before receiving an allowance, and to those insured who are disabled through accidents, but who do not receive a disablement allowance because of their higher accident-insurance allowance.\n\nThe funds necessary for this insurance are raised through a yearly contribution from the government of fifty marks for each pension, together with weekly contributions to an equal amount from employer and employed. The amount of the same for a definite period is so estimated in advance that the capital value of the pensions which the insurance institution must bear is covered, as well as the reimbursements of contributions and the other expenses of insurance.\n\nThe disablement-insurance scheme comprises about 13.5 million persons insured, or almost the whole of the working classes.\n\nTo the initiative of imperial social policy the blessing is therefore due that in Germany nearly all workmen are insured in case of sickness, accident, and disablement. Every day 1,250,000 marks are spent for this branch of workman’s protection alone. In countries without compulsory insurance scarcely one tenth of the workmen enjoy a similar protection, and this, moreover, falls considerably short of the German workman’s insurance in certainty and scope.\n\nIn one year over five million persons in need of help received about 370,000,000 marks; during the whole period of seventeen years (1885–1901) 50,000,000 persons in round numbers (sick and injured persons, the incapacitated and their families) received indemnities amounting to 3,000,000,000 marks as a result of the legislation for the insurance of workmen, although the most far-reaching clauses of the law (insurance against disablement) only came into force on January 1, 1891. The workmen have only paid the smaller part of the contribution, and have already received about 1,000,000,000 marks more in compensation than their contributions amount to.\n\nThe significance of this insurance for German workmen extends far beyond a simple financial one, for it has become a social-political school for the whole nation. The importance of German workmen’s insurance towers far above its financial aspect. Through the mutual participation of the employer and employee in the administration and payment of contributions, the workman is himself daily reminded of the moral duty of making provision for the future from his own resources, the employers of their social duties to their employees, and both parties of their common interest in their calling. Thereby social reconciliation is effected where otherwise special organizations would array themselves against each other as anatomists. It is of great importance, moreover, that the cure of sick and disabled workmen is more rapidly effected through the erection of special institutions. Owing to the success reached through these measures, public sanitation has been directed into entirely new channels. Above everything else, the cooperation of these organizations with those of voluntary charity, especially with the Red Cross Society and the National Women’s Club, has made it possible for even the smallest and poorest country parish to systematically cure the sick, and to undertake an organized campaign against that frightful national pestilence, tuberculosis of the lungs.\n\nInstead of smothering the free initiative of self-helping bodies, as many had feared workmen’s insurance would do, it has, on the contrary, enabled them to develop to their highest powers.\n\nThe reserve capital of 1,500,000,000 marks has furnished the means for solving the most important social economical questions.\n\nUp to the end of 1902 over 400,000,000 marks had been expended from the funds of disablement-insurance institutions for the construction of workmen’s dwellings, sick and convalescent houses, sanatoriums, public hospitals, homes for traveling workmen, public baths, blind asylums, kindergartens, slaughterhouses, systems of water works, sewerage and draining plants, street paving, savings banks, coöperative stores, and similar institutions for public welfare, as well as for the payment of agricultural loans (mortgages, light railroads, land and road improvement, development of cattle breeding, etc.), all measures the final aim of which is to cause the masses of the people to participate to an ever-increasing degree in the advance of civilization.\n\nThe advantages of German workmen’s insurance, in distinction to other systems, is that:\n\n1. It guarantees the support required by necessitous persons immediately, and as a well-earned right;\n\n2. It gives both employer and employee common interests in their duties, and thereby acts in a way as an instrument of social reconciliation;\n\n3. It awakens a feeling of social duty throughout the nation; and\n\n4. It strengthens the working and defensive power of the nation.\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 189–92.\n\nBloody Sunday (January 22, 1905)\n\nOn January 22, 1905, a crowd estimated at two hundred thousand peaceful demonstrators in St. Petersburg, led by Father Gapon, were on their way to deliver a petition to Tsar Nicholas II at the Winter Palace. Their petition called for improved working conditions, fair wages, and the eight-hour day. On orders, the Imperial Guard opened fire. Estimates on the number killed range from one hundred (the government’s figure) to four thousand people. This event intensified the revolutionary movement and ultimately led to the Revolution of 1905. The following account is from the London Times.\n\nA more perfect and lovely day never dawned. The air was crisp and the sky almost cloudless. The gilded domes of the cathedrals and churches, brilliantly illuminated by the sun, formed a superb panorama. I noticed a significant change in the bearing of the passers-by: They were all wending their way, singly or in small groups, in the direction of the Winter Palace. Joining in the stream of workingmen, I proceeded in the direction of the Winter Palace. No observer could help being struck by the look of sullen determination on every face. Already a crowd of many thousands had collected, but was prevented from entering the square by mounted troops drawn up across the thoroughfare. Presently the masses began to press forward threateningly. The cavalry advanced at a walking pace, scattering the people right and left.\n\nEvent has succeeded event with such bewildering rapidity that the public is staggered and shocked beyond measure. The first trouble began when the military tried to turn back some thousands of strikers at one of the bridges. The same thing happened almost simultaneously at other bridges, where the constant flow of workmen pressing forward refused to be denied access to the common rendezvous in the Palace Square. The Cossacks at first used their knouts, then the flat of their sabers, and finally they fired. The strikers in the front ranks fell on their knees and implored the Cossacks to let them pass, protesting that they had no hostile intentions. They refused, however, to be intimidated by blank cartridges, and orders were given to load with ball.\n\nThe passions of the mob broke loose like a bursting dam. The people, seeing the dead and dying carried away in all directions, the snow on the streets and pavements soaked with blood, cried aloud for vengeance. Meanwhile the situation at the Palace was becoming momentarily worse. The troops were reported to be unable to control the vast masses which were constantly surging forward. Rëinforcements were sent, and at 2 o’clock here also the order was given to fire. Men, women, and children fell at each volley, and were carried away in ambulances, sledges, and carts. The indignation and fury of every class were aroused. Students, merchants, all classes of the population alike were inflamed. At the moment of writing, firing is going on in every quarter of the city.\n\nFather Gapon, marching at the head of a large body of workmen, carrying a cross and other religious emblems, was wounded in the arm and shoulder. The two forces of workmen are now separated. Those on the other side of the river are arming with swords, knives, and smiths’ and carpenters’ tools, and are busy erecting barricades. The troops are apparently reckless, firing right and left, with or without reason. The rioters continue to appeal to them, saying, “You are Russians! Why play the part of bloodthirsty butchers?”\n\nDreadful anxiety prevails in every household where any members are absent. Distracted husbands, fathers, wives, and children are searching for those missing. The surgeons and Red Cross ambulances are busy. A night of terror is in prospect.\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 373–74.\n\nBismarck, Speech on the Anti-Socialist Law (1878)\n\nIn his quest for a stronger Germany, Otto von Bismarck (1815–1898) would let nothing stand in his way. His policies were resisted by the Social Democrats, who aimed at a reconstruction of Prussia and the imperial government along democratic lines. They believed that the great industries ought to be taken over by the state, now made democratic. As chancellor, Bismarck believed the best way to deal with the Social Democrats was to suppress their meetings and newspapers.\n\nFor eleven years we have had the advantage of associating with Social Democrats, and do you remember, Gentlemen, of hearing, amid all the long speeches delivered in this place by socialists, a single one in which it was possible to discover the slightest shadow of a concrete idea or of a project for future action indicating what they actually intend to do when they shall have made a breach in the existing social system? I recall nothing of the sort, and I believe I know the reason why these gentlemen are so carefully silent about the manner in which they intend to refashion the world when they are masters. It is because they do not know themselves. They can never keep the promises with which they have misled the people.\n\nThat these gentlemen with their obscure promises should have been able to seduce some people is not astonishing to any one who is discontented with his situation, particularly when he resents it and makes the most of his discontent with Germanic energy. When socialism is presented to the people who know how to read, but who can form no judgment on what they have read (the ability to read is much more extensive with us than in France or England, though perhaps the ability to form a judgment on what is read is less common in Germany than in these two countries), when one makes such people brilliant promises, and, moreover, contemptuously derides as rubbish and fiction everything formerly held sacred; when the glorious motto “With God for King and for Country,” which has filled with enthusiasm and guided and sustained our fathers and ourselves, is represented as a hollow phrase, a mere dupery; when one takes away from such people faith in God, faith in our royalty, attachment to the country, belief in family relations, in property, in the transmission by inheritance of what has been acquired for the children; —when one takes away all this, it is then not very difficult to carry the half-educated man to the point of finally crying out with Faust: “Cursed be hope, cursed be faith, and cursed be patience particularly.” If I had myself arrived at this state of unbelief which is taught to these people, if I had lost what the poet calls “Faith in God and in a better future,” nothing could make me desire to live a day longer. (Loud applause.) Take away this faith from the poor man to whom you can assure no compensation, and you produce in him a disgust with life.\n\nIt is only since 1867 that we have been able to recognize officially the leaders of Social Democracy by the presence in Parliament of Messrs. Bebel, Liebknecht, Fritsche, Schweitzer, and Mende. At the period of which I speak these gentlemen presented themselves with a certain timidity still, although they carefully announced that they were not tractable people like Lassale and his kind, and proclaimed themselves true Social Democrats. But the ambition which animates them today, namely, to seize the power of the State and use it for their own interest and ideas, has really taken its rise since 1870.\n\nBefore 1870, while the leaders of the International lived in London and Geneva, France was the real home of their endeavors; France was the real field of their operations; it was only in France that the socialists had an army all ready, able to give battle for the Commune and render itself effectually the master of the situation for a short time. At that moment, when they found themselves in the possession of authority, did they work out a definite programme, indicating how they could employ their power for the advantage of the needy classes? They were able to write Utopian phrases in their journals, but with authority in their hands they made no attempt in Paris to show by example what they really wanted. They did nothing but assassinate, burn, give themselves up to cruelty of every sort, destroy national monuments; and even when they had transformed Paris into a heap of ashes, in the face of this destruction they did not know any more about what they wanted: “We are malcontents; things ought to be otherwise; but how? We do not know.” They went no further.\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 185–87.\n\nAdolphe Thiers, Reasons for Favoring a Republic\n\nIn 1873, when the country saw the administrative system, the army, and the finances reëstablished, and the foreign enemy departed from our soil, a universal demand arose for the abandonment of the provisional form of government, and for the establishment of a permanent constitution, which meant, to give to each party, weary of waiting, the government of its choice. But there were three monarchical parties, and but one throne. The idea of gratifying them all had, therefore, to be abandoned. As for myself, my mind was made up. In the presence of these three competitors, monarchy was impossible. A republic was difficult without doubt, but possible if prudence and wisdom were exercised. Under a republic France had just been revived.\n\nI should have preferred that the question had not been brought up, but it could no longer be evaded. As a simple deputy, elected president of the republic by my colleagues, I stated the question without allowing myself to solve it. I could do neither more nor less. The three monarchical parties, united in the common design of resisting the establishment of a republic, proposed to the Assembly that it separate itself from me, and, as I was not less desirous of separating myself from it, I handed in my resignation, for which my successor did not have to wait ten minutes. . . .\n\nNow I ask every honest man, to whatever party he may belong, if the Count de Chambord could be placed on the throne, with the opinions that he professes and with the flag that he unfurls, or if it is hoped that he may some day be acceptable after he has modified his views? We respect him too much to believe that he will do so. I will say nothing of the Orleans princes, who wish to be mentioned only after the Count de Chambord, according to their hereditary rank; but I ask if the country is ready to receive the Prince Imperial [son of Napoleon III], who, though innocent of the misfortunes of France, suggests them so keenly that the nation still shudders at the bare mention of his name? . . .\n\nMust France wait until her future masters are ready; until one candidate is brought over to other ways of thinking, until another has made an advance in his right of succession, and until a third has finished his education? In the meanwhile everything will be in suspense, —commerce, industry, finances, State affairs. How can businessmen be asked to engage in great industrial enterprises, and financiers to negotiate loans, when the future threatens fresh political troubles? And how can foreign cabinets be expected to strengthen their relations and form alliances with us, when French policy is liable to be directed by new chiefs and influenced by new ideas?\n\nWe persistently ask if there be any other alternative than the following; either the monarchy, which is impossible, because there are three claimants and but one throne; or a republic, difficult to establish without doubt, not because of itself, but because of the opposition of the monarchical parties, but, nevertheless, possible, for it is supported by an immense majority of the people.\n\nIt is the duty, therefore, of this immense majority of the people to consult together, to unite and to vote against those who resist the establishment of the only government possible. Monarchy today, after the three revolutions that have overthrown it, would mean immediate civil war, if it were established now; and if put off for two years, or three years, the civil war is only postponed until that epoch. A republic is an equitable participation of all the children of France in the government of their country, according to their abilities, their importance, and their callings, —a possible and practical participation, excluding nobody except those who announce that they will govern only by revolution. A republic is absolutely necessary, for everybody who is not blind or lying must admit that it alone is possible.\n\nJames Harvey Robinson and Charles Beard, eds., Readings in Modern European History, vol. II (New York: Ginn and Company, 1909), pp. 213–15."
