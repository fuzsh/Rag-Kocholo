        "text": "Three Stars out of Five\n\nOut of the Silent Planet is a small book yet reads like a work twice its size. The plot is fairly basic though that’s certainly not meant as an insult. Essentially, this is similar in vein to the grand discovery tales penned by Father of Science Fiction himself, Jules Verne. The only difference is that where Verne concentrated on scientific concepts and technologies, Lewis focuses on the human (or should I also say alien?) aspect by exposing readers to an alien culture that bears some familiarity yet remains uniquely extraterrestrial.\n\nIt’s also no surprise that this novel is a spiritual allegory though it certainly doesn’t preach. Ransom is transported by evil and sorely misguided men to another planet, assuming Ransom will meet his end there and they, in turn, can make a name for themselves. But things aren’t what they seem and it’s Ransom who turns out to discover what life and the universe truly mean. The philosophical musings towards the book’s latter chapters can be bit dense though they actually force you to think as opposed to just being deep for no good reason. This novel makes me curious to read the other two works in the Space Trilogy to see how the rest of Ransom’s journey plays out.\n\nThe various alien species on Malacandra are interesting and Lewis downplays the idea of an ugly-looking alien equating a hostile force. Instead, these aliens are more humane than the Human characters, Ransom aside. Their culture is rich and interesting to engage though the lack of variation in their language makes it tricky at times to keep terms straight. Again, that’s not a negative and the linguistical rules at play here never break, but some readers might find the constant use of alien terms a bit difficult to keep track of.\n\nCharacter-wise, I wouldn’t call any of these figures in-depth but they’re not stock characters. Again, since this novel reads like an allegory, sometimes the qualities the character is supposed to represent and assume eclipse their development. Though I’m generally not a fan of allegory (and especially strict allegory), I take no issue with this novel though readers looking for characters they can sink their teeth into might find Ransom and Co. lacking just a bit.\n\nLastly, the ending holds a bit of a surprise and, all spoilers aside, shows the type of character Ransom is, proving he’s a likable protagonist. I was actually surprised by his choice but I’m glad Lewis wrote it that way. Otherwise, I don’t think the other two novels in the trilogy would have had much to work with. In the end, Out of the Silent Planet is a quick read if you want to peruse it merely for time. But for folks wanting to delve into its deeper meanings and spiritual connections, there is a lot here to savor.\n\nOverall, Out of the Silent Planet is a weighty read despite its physical size. It deals with what it means to be human as well as tackles spiritual truths under the guise of science fiction. To be fair, the alien linguistics might not appeal to all tastes but this novel is an impressive story that deserves to be engaged at least once, whether you love science fiction or C.S. Lewis or both.\n\nContent:\n\nLanguage – None, and if there were any they were very few and far between.\n\nViolence – Nothing in terms of any blood or gore. Violence is minimal, and while there are some scenes of peril, such as the aftermath of an attack, nothing is described in gory detail.\n\nSexual Content – None. At one point, Ransom and his fellow space travelers remove their clothes in order to wear a zero gravity-correcting belt, but nothing even remotely sexual occurs."
