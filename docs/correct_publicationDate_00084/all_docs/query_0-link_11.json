        "text": "Very good\n\nThis book was my 2nd favorite in the series. I've listened to it twice now, and recommened it for any Christian. The narrator does a nice job. The book is engaging and well written, though a little dated, because it was pretty early for SciFi. This series is not as fun as the Narnia series, but has more theology and christian philosophy. It was sometimes challenging to think about what Lewis was teaching at the same time as following the story, but well worth it.\n\nClassic C.S. Lewis\n\nThis book has amazing descriptions of space considering it was written in 1938. Lewis is very creative in imagining a space ship and space travel, and what the earth looks like from space. The story is vintage Lewis, creative fiction with theological implications. We, the people of earth, are \"bent\" by the king of our world, and live in a planet that is \"silent\" while the rest of the heavens has a kind of communication. It feels like old-fashioned sci-fi because there's a great deal of talk and description rather than plot and action. For instance, there's significant discussion that earthlings are people of fear, because we create fear.\n\nSciFi Backdrop for Theological Revelation\n\nWhat did you love best about Out of the Silent Planet?\n\nC.S. Lewis does it again! I am amazed at his ability to think of technologies and civilizations that he had yet to encounter for this story.\n\nWhat did you like best about this story?\n\nThe best part is that the story isn't even about scifi! It's about us, humanity, and how we have been deceived. He incorporates the Heavens in a way that explains angels, God, and the Big Picture.\n\nWhich character – as performed by Geoffrey Howard – was your favorite?\n\nObviously Dr. Ransom was the main (90%) of the dialogue.\n\nDid you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?\n\nNo, but it did make me think and that's better than both.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nGeoffrey Howard and C.S. Lewis must have been good friends or maybe he is an avid admirer of him b/c he is the only person I have heard read Lewis.\n\nBrilliant!\n\nI have always love the way Clive Staples Lewis thinks. He express many things in a way that I didn't think of before but upon closer inspection I find I agree. Other things I'm still pondering 😇. And not only that but some things he points out only some one who talks to God, who communes with Him, and contemplates on the things of God, thinks about. I know the difference between shallow Christian ideology expressed by casual Christians who \"admire\" God and goodness but they are content being in the family and those who seek Him as hidden treasure and are not content merely doing Christian things, being around Christians and knowing the lingo but they want to truly want to know \"Him\" and everything about Him, His word, and His world ( not just the physical but the spiritual realm as well). I know the difference because I am one of the latter.\n\nHope Dana"
