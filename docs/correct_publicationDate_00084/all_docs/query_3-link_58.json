        "text": "Hressa-Hlab, Hlab-Eribol-ef-Cordi, Old Solar, and a nonexistent lexicon\n\nby: darkwater4213\n\nAs anyone who has attempted to locate a full lexicon for the aforementioned languages knows...\n\nThere is none. None that is of any practical use, at any rate. FrathWiki (a site dedicated solely to the cataloguing and preserving conlangs -- fictional and/or artificially constructed languages) houses the most comprehensive lexicon for this language (they are, as far as I am aware, distinct dialects of one language). As anyone who cares to visit it will find, it is painfully small. The minuscule taste of the way the language rolls off the tongue in such a pleasing manner was simply too little. If it has yet to become clear: I want a comprehensive lexicon and grammar for hressa-hlab.\n\nBy the way: I'm darkwater4213! I don't have an account yet, but I stumbled upon this fascinating little corner of the internet not long ago and have spent several happy hours browsing through it. I am no philologist (much less a scholar of languages) but I still enjoy the feel of a language that has been crafted by an expert. As you can guess, I'm a big fantasy and Sci-Fi fan. I have yet to complete my first read-through of Asimov's works (which is a sort of initiation ritual as far as I can gather) but have read many of Tolkien and Lewis's works multiple times. That should count for something, right?\n\nI should get on with it. Obviously, I'm not very familiar with the way this site operates, but I would really like to work with someone to continue Lewis's work on a cosmic language. Or not. But I would like a lexicon :)\n\nQuite the diversion. Now for the article. It was quite well-thought out and I rather enjoyed it. That being said, I think (and this is largely a matter of opinion) that the author's offhand dismissal of the allegorical elements of the Space Trilogy seems a bit uncalled-for. I, for one, quite enjoyed the allegorical aspect of the first two books in the Space Trilogy. It presented many theological concepts largely considered extremely difficult to comprehend in a surprisingly digestible, readable format. Perhaps the plot is left wanting somewhat from the faint sense that this plot is a repeat (though I cannot imagine what of). Perhaps it was written to be reminiscent of the old Robert Louis Stevenson adventure stories; essentially the literary equivalent of an action film. That is, in that the plot is not so paramount as the points contained within. I should probably sign off at this point, seeing as how this has turned into my own criticism of Lewis's epic rather than a review of an article about said epic. My spelling's needing ever more correction is another indication. :){Don't worry - I've dealt with that. Z}\n\nComment from Zendexor:\n\nMany thanks for this, Darkwater4213! Your ref to FrathWiki is one fascinating eye-opener. I also very much like your attachment to the idea of expanding upon the meagre clues left by CSL concerning the Old Solar tongue. It reminds me of the urge I had to work out more of the dates in various sf future histories. It's all to do with filling in gaps and filling out structures and, in general, further enriching the riches available. Whether or not you manage to find a collaborator in your philological enterprise, I suggest as a technique that of the \"implicizer\", a sort of mental machine which I outline elsewhere on the site - see the references in the Themes page for the links you can follow up.\n\nIt's not often that I can find anything to complain about in CSL's masterful trilogy, but one point which stretches my credulity a bit too far is the expedient of turning the speech of the hross in volume 1 into the Ursprache of the entire System in volumes 2 and 3. I accept it, as I tend to accept everything when I'm under the spell of a great writer, but in this case it's somewhat of a strain."
