        "text": "Out of the Silent Planet\n\nAuthor: C.S. Lewis\n\nGenre: Science Fiction\n\nYear: 1965\n\nRating: 8 of 10\n\nThis is the first book in the ambiguously named Space Trilogy. I haven’t yet decided if I will continue the series but I immensely enjoyed the first installment. A man is kidnapped and sent to Mars as an apparent sacrifice to the sentient beings of the planet. Once arriving and escaping the protagonist discovers that there are multiple sentient species and attempts to overcome the present language barriers. I always find this an intriguing premise and love books that deal with language and communication. I also love the idea of multiple sentient species developing together on a planet and sharing cultures. Great aliens and a great story overall.\n\nPurchase: Buy!"
