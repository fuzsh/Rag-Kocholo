Also, would it make a good read aloud or better to read to oneself? I'm considering these books as a read aloud, or possible just for ds, age 11.",

        "text": "I read Out of a Silent Planet when I was 12 or 13 and didn't care for it AND didn't \"get\" it. Read it again (the whole series actually) in my late teens on recommendation of a friend and \"got\" a lot more out of it (can't say I liked it much though - and I loved the Narnia series, Screwtape Letters and some of Lewis' non-fiction books at that time).\n\nI read it first in early high school, and enjoyed the story line, but I didn't understand most of what is in those books until college. I believe he wrote the with adult readers in mind, not children.\n\nThey are some of my favorite books now. They shaped my ideas of angels (I know that is a little weird). I re-read them every few years. \"My name, too is Ransom...\" Oh, man! And I bawled over the end of Perelandra. Last year I heard on NPR about some organization going by N.I.C.E. and got the creeps. :)\n\nIf you haven't read them, read them for YOURSELF! But I think at 11 your child may not get most of it.\n\nC.S. Lewis's Space trilogy is a favorite of mine (Out of the Silent Planet is the name of the first book, not the name of the series; I'm not sure he actually named the trilogy...I'll have to go upstairs and find my copy. :)) I wouldn't lke to read it aloud, though. I think anyone who is interested should jump in, even if she's only 11yo. :-)"
