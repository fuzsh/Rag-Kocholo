        "text": "Out of the Silent Planet- Good Art, Good Message\n\nI have always been a fan of C.S. Lewis, but the only books I had read through completely were the Chronicles of Narnia. Then I read a study of heroines in literature and the \"Green Lady\" from Perelandra was one of the heroines. When I saw the book, including all three stories in the trilogy, I had to buy it. I was almost instantly captured by the story. Lewis wrote these books in such a suspensful way that I could not wait to get to the next page. I loved the way Lewis entertwined faith, science fiction/ fantasy, and current events into such a great story. One of the few things I disliked about the books was how much description Lewis put into the stories. I felt the bulk of description about Malacandra slowed down the story. I wanted to get past the flora and fauna and find out what was happening to Ransom. One of the things I most appreciated about the whole trilogy was the presence of Christian themes throughout the stories. In the first book, none of the characters ever preached a sermon, but the characters acted as they did because of the presence of Jesus Christ in their lives or the absence of Him in their lives. This quality of the book is what causes it to have a Good Message. The incredible storytelling of Lewis is what causes it to be Good Art.Read full review\n\nLove it! Get it if you like Lewis.\n\nI had been an avid C.S. Lewis fan for most of my life. I had \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" read to me as a child, and when I was older, reread them again. I have also enjoyed his other writings such as \"The Great Divorce\" \"Screwtape Letters\" and \"Till we have faces\" Then recently, I got my hands on \"Out of the Silent Planet\" and it quickly went into my favorites by Lewis. I highly recommend this book. I have read it three times already, and plan to read the series many more times in my life."
