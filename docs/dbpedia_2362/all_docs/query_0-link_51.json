(“Bert”) a founder of the Sarasota School of Architecture, died on January 23.\n\nMr. Brosmith, born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1928 to Allan and Georgette (Comeau) Brosmith, was 86, and a longtime resident of Pound Ridge, NY.\n\nWith an inquisitive mind and a gifted eye, Mr. Brosmith’s life was rich in creativity and intellectualism, evidenced by an architecture degree from the University of Pennsylvania, a Fulbright Scholarship to The University of London, and a lifetime of renowned architectural design.\n\nHis first artistic foray was a tour of duty with the U.S. Army Signal Corps in Japan in 1946, where, despite a lack of formal training, he served as photographer, once assigned to take pictures of General Douglas MacArthur. Mr. Brosmith and his Hasselblad camera spent a lifetime carefully chronicling weddings, anniversaries and family milestones.\n\nAfter his Fulbright fellowship in London, Mr. Brosmith co-authored a book entitled “London—An Urban Framework,” before assuming responsibility for the Sarasota, Florida office of famed architect Paul Rudolph.\n\nIn his first assignment under Rudolph, Brosmith created the “Family of Man” exhibition, which was featured at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\nBrosmith’s work transformed Sarasota through myriad projects including schools, office buildings, a juvenile detention center and residential homes, some in the Saratoga School of Architecture (also called Sarasota Modern) style which he’d help define. He founded his own firm in Sarasota in 1963.\n\nIn 1961, Mr. Brosmith met Catharina Boman, a Pan Am flight attendant. The two married, and had three children—Kevin, Sean and Karina.\n\nAfter working on a project with noted architect I.P. Pei, Yale University invited Mr. Brosmith to the position of Visiting Design Critic.\n\nThe Brosmiths moved to New York, where Mr. Brosmith joined the firm Perkins and Will in White Plains, NY, before founding Juster, Brosmith, Levine Architects in New York City.\n\nIn 1978, Mr. Brosmith founded Bert Brosmith Architecture in Pound Ridge, NY, where he continued to work—largely on residential projects throughout Westchester County—until 2012.\n\nAside from his far-reaching imprint on the world of architecture, Mr. Brosmith will be remembered for his love of education. He insisted his children study hard, rationing their television time in favor of time with books. Upon return from work, he often checked the temperature on the back of the television—if his hand got warm, it meant his children were slacking.\n\nMr. Brosmith also served as an unofficial matchmaker between hundreds of Pound Ridge’s college-bound students and a host of colleges and universities. With a keen sense of which school best matched a particular student, he also wrote countless heartfelt letters of recommendation.\n\nA devout Roman Catholic, Mr. Brosmith loved to translate the Mass into Latin in his head.\n\nMr. Brosmith was a scratch golfer, honing skills at Sarasota’s Sara Bay Country Club that would serve him well into his seventies.\n\nMr. Brosmith’s deepest and most important legacy, however, is his family. He and his wife, Catharina, celebrated 53 years of marriage in December.\n\nThe couple’s three children – Kevin, Sean and Karina were shaped and influenced by their father in countless ways, and have, in turn, ensured continuation of his legacy through eight grandchildren. Mr. Brosmith is survived by his wife, Catharina of Bethel, CT; Kevin and Mary Brosmith of Natick, MA; Sean and Hsiu-Yen Brosmith of Beverly Hills, CA and Karina (Early) and her husband, Patrick, of Chelmsford, MA.

Her beloved husband, Abram Claude, Jr. was by her side. Libba was born in Greenville, NC on January 21,1936 and is the daughter of Judge Dink James and Carolyn Fullilove James. A southern girl at heart, she graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill before moving to New York City. There she worked briefly on Wall Street before marrying Robert D. Thorson, with whom she had four children: Carolyn, Virginia, Martha and Robert, Jr. She was tragically widowed in 1969. In 1972 Libba married Abe and together they were long-time residents of Bedford, NY before retiring to their home in North Salem. Libba is also survived by six fabulous grandchildren. A force in any community in which she lived Libba was active locally and regionally in many not-for-profit organizations. For more than 20 years she served as a board member for East Side House Settlement, where she was the exhibitors chairman of the world renowned Winter Antique Show, held in the 7th Regiment Armory in New York City. Libba also ran the opening night gala for that major cultural event. She preformed the same function for the Art Dealer’s Association when they initiated a major exhibition at the 7th Regiment Armory. Libba also managed and/or was deeply involved in numerous events at the Bedford Rippowam Cisqua School and her very much loved St. Matthew’s Church. She also volunteered for more than 13 years at Northern Westchester Hospital, pushing the “book cart” room-to-room in an effort to spread her passion for reading to the sick. Libba’s most important life work, however, was for the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, the largest such prison in New York State. For more than 15 years Libba devoted herself to helping the women keep in constructive, positive contact with their children by serving as the liaison between the inmates, their children, social workers, teachers, foster parents. She did this all while handling the many problems the children faced that their mothers could not address while incarcerated. Libba single-handedly raised substantial monies to build an impressive garden and playground complex at the prison where the mothers and their children could be together in a tranquil and beautiful place, rather than in the sterile atmosphere of the prison’s visiting room. She personally designed and tirelessly cared for the garden section there as well. For her work at Bedford Hills she was honored by Catholic Charities with the esteemed Volunteer of the Year Award and received similar recognition from the Women’s Prison Association. Most of all, Libba’s greatest joy was being a devoted, loving wife and mother, and friend to her many, many friends of all ages. She loved entertaining (with great flair) and being entertained, and she enjoyed spending much of her spare time in art galleries, museums, and at the theater.\n\nA Memorial Service will be held on Fri, Nov 6 at 3 pm at St Matthews Church, Bedford.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please support Hour Children, Inc., 36-11 12th Street, Long Island City, NY 11106\n\nCorbo, MaryAnn N.

He was born and raised in Rockaway Beach, N.Y., the youngest of Raymond’s and Dorothy’s seven children, where he met the love of his life, Joan Proscia, just off the boardwalk. They were married in 1956 and raised five children as life took them from Rockaway to North Bellmore and Chappaqua, NY.\n\nGeorge worked his entire career in insurance brokerage, notably catching on with Parker & Company in 1962. He made his mark developing new business, particularly among large aviation clients. He joined Frank B. Hall & Co. upon its acquisition of Parker in 1970, moving to FBH’s headquarters in Briarcliff Manor, in 1974. He was FBH’s Executive Vice President and best known for forming its renowned Hall Services Division, which designed and managed placements for FBH’s largest national clients. He also helped establish and lead FBH’s captive insurance operations in Bermuda and its aviation insurance businesses. In 1988 George joined Aon in Chicago as Executive Vice President of its brokerage operations and helped build the company into the world’s second largest insurance brokerage. George was an officer and director of several of the company’s boards, including the Bermuda and UK operations.\n\nIn 1997, George gladly put the business world behind him to spend as much time as possible with Joan, who had been diagnosed with leukemia. He was Joan’s rock during treatment, and brought her back to the beach at a second home in Stone Harbor, NJ. As treatment allowed, and then during a blessed period of remission, they spent their time traveling and doing what they enjoyed most, being with their children, grandchildren, and extended family and friends, both at the beach and at their northern outpost in Ridgefield, CT. Sadly, Joan died in 2004. With a hole in his heart and a constant smile, he continued to support, nurture encourage and inspire their family.\n\nGeorge proudly served in the Army from 1953-1955. He was an avid golfer and member of Sleepy Hollow Country Club. He generously introduced Joan, their children and grandchildren to the sport, and played with a men’s group in Stone Harbor when he left SHCC. He jogged 4 miles a day into his late 70s, when illness slowed him to biking and walking, which he did until the month before he died. He loved to entertain. He loved life and living it. Above all, he loved, and was loved by his family. He was affectionately known to all as Crunch, The Cruncher, and even Crunchie, a nickname that came to mean much more than the prank on a neighborhood kid it started out as.\n\nGeorge was predeceased by his wife Joan in 2004 and, tragically, grandchildren Trevor and Alicia. He is survived by his sons George, Richard, Daniel and Gary, and daughter Angela; their spouses Meg, Debbie, Zoraya, Malia and Kevin; and, 17 grandchildren.\n\nFamily will receive friends on Monday, July 6 from 2-4pm and 7-9pm, and on Tuesday, July 7 from 10-12am, at Clark Associates Funeral Home, Katonah, NY.
