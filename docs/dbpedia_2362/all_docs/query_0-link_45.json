Loving husband of Mary (Misner); proud father of Jared, Sean, and Wendy, and stepfather of Scott (Stephanie) and Jason; fondly remembered by Mary’s grandsons, Gil, Liam and Dawson. Ash was predeceased by his dear sister Ellen and parents Ashton and Nora (McEwing). He is survived by Aunt Marion (McEwing) McKracken and Cousins Fraser, Robbie, Jean, Jane and Jennifer. Born in London, Ontario Ash grew up in the town of Simcoe. He received his law degree from the University of Western Ontario; articled with the firm of Basil Sullivan in Toronto; and was called to the Bar in 1970. He briefly joined his father’s practice in Simcoe before establishing his own law office in nearby Port Dover. A noted practitioner, Ash provided legal counsel to the City of Nanticoke while conducting a successful general practice for many years until his retirement in 1998. A champion of many causes, he continued to keep local politicians’ feet to the fire on important issues. He dearly loved this small town on Lake Erie and was visionary in developing properties on the waterfront there. Ash is remembered as one of the most dedicated counsellors at Onondaga Camp near Minden, Ontario. The lifelong friendships developed there continued to be of great importance to him throughout his life. His love of the outdoors led him on adventurous canoe trips on the rivers of the Arctic region and hikes on Baffin Island. His affinity for the Canadian Arctic and its culture is evident in the unique soapstone carvings that he took pleasure in creating since his retirement. His great passions were sailing and skiing. He was an accomplished sail boat racer, actively participating in regattas on Lake Erie and Lake Ontario with his boat Lancer; and is a past Commodore of the Port Dover Yacht Club. As an instructor at the Holimont Ski School in Ellicottville New York, Ash shared his enthusiasm for the sport and was one of the founding instructors in their Adaptive Program. Teaching these challenged children to ski brought him tremendous joy and satisfaction. He loved music of all sorts and recently his interest in developing his skill as a guitarist extended to building a series of now treasured acoustic guitars. Theatre also played a significant role in his life. His mother was a talented actress and director of regional theatre and Ash cherished a very special relationship with his godfather William Hutt. Ash was a man of a great many interests and talents: skilled woodworker who also designed and built a unique home on the lake; created a peach farming operation; made vast quantities of wine; and held an impressive reputation for his world famous chili. His huge circle of friends is a testament to his loyalty and his caring nature. Mary, Sean, Jared and Wendy will dearly miss him. At Ash’s request, cremation has taken place. Family and friends are invited to visit at the Thompson Waters Funeral Home, 102 First Ave., Port Dover (519-583-1530) on Monday, June 29 from 2 to 5 and 7 to 9.
