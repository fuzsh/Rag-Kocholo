He was 93.\n\nThe cause was leukemia, said his friend, Emilio Guede, adding that Barquin died Monday at his home in Guaynabo, a prosperous suburb of San Juan.\n\nBarquin, a former Cuban military attache in Washington, D.C., was imprisoned after he led hundreds of soldiers in an April 1956 coup that failed when someone tipped off the government. He gained his freedom three years later when Castro successfully toppled Batista, but he opposed Castro soon after.\n\n“He never abandoned the idea of country,” Guede said. “All his plans were directed toward the liberation of Cuba … He joined the fight against Fidel Castro when it became evident that it was another dictatorship.”\n\nShortly after his release, Barquin moved to Miami and then to Puerto Rico in 1961 with a group of Cubans that included Guede.\n\nBarquin was born in Cuba’s central Cienfuegos province on May 12, 1914. He enlisted in the army in 1933 and graduated from the Cuban Military Academy as a first lieutenant. He later was named director of Cuba’s Superior War College and the Military Academy.\n\nBefore leading the failed coup, Barquin also served as a Cuban delegate for the Inter-American Defense Board, a committee of nationally appointed defense officials.\n\nOnce in Puerto Rico, Barquin founded Atlantic College in Guaynabo, the American Military Academy in San Juan and various summer camps.\n\nHe rarely missed cultural or political events within Puerto Rico’s Cuban community, said Andres Candelario, a member of a local Cuban group who met Barquin a couple decades ago.\n\nBarquin also was known for his physical endurance. He placed first in the 1994 New York City Marathon for the 80-plus category, coming in more than an hour ahead of next runner.\n\nBarquin’s wife of more than 60 years, Hilda Barquin, died in 2004.
