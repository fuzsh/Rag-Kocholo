Manitowoc Herald Times - Friday, July 26, 1963 - page T3 ******** FARMER HAS HEAVY LOSS Fire wiped out the home of Joseph Manlick, a farmer residing three miles west of Clarks Mills, shortly after 2 o'clock Saturday afternoon. The loss is conservatively estimated at $7000 and is only partly covered by insurance. The fire, the origin of which is a mystery, was first discovered on the roof. Attempts to extinguish the flames proved futile. Fanned by a northeast wind the flames spread rapidly thru the entire house, making it impossible to save furniture and clothing. The house burned completely to the ground. Due to the fact that the wind was from the northeast, the large barns loaded with grain and valuable machinery were saved. The Valders fire department which arrived upon the scene assisted in confining the flames to the house. The house was a large structure. Besides Mr. and Mrs. Jos. Manlick and family, the building was occupied by Mr. Manlick's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Fred Manlick. On Sunday morning, nothing remained of the once fine home but a mass of charred ruin.

Harrigan Parkside Funeral Home Obituary - April, 2015\n\nEUGENE MCCARTHY Death in Cato Sun. of 21-yr. old Eugene McCarty of consumption. The funeral was Tues. morning in Clarks Mills. Der Nord Westen, 22 Aug. 1901 ******** Deaths of a Week: Eugene McCarty of Cato, died on Sunday. He was twenty years old. Manitowoc Pilot, Wis., Thursday, August 22, 1901 pg. 1 ******** Cato: Eugene McCarthy, a well known young man of this town died last week. Interment was in the Catholic cemetery at Clarks Mills, Tuesday. Manitowoc Pilot, Wis., Thursday, August 22, 1901 pg. 8 ******** CATO. On Sunday, Aug 18, Eugene McCarthy, aged 21 years, died at his home in Cato. Eugene was a young man of exemplary habits highly esteemed by all of his friends. Quiet, unobstructive, yet possessing those genial qualities that make and retain friends, he readily endeared himself to those with whom he associated. As a pupil the writer remembers him as an earnest, painstaking, conscientious worker and his subsequent career as teacher though brief, displayed the same qualities. He accepted the burden of self-sacrifice that the conscientious teacher must bear, deeming it a pleasure to be in a position to help others. A loving son and brothers (sic) , an earnest worker and a faithful friend, he is acknowledged to have been by all. The funeral services were held at Clarks Mills on Tuesday, Aug. 20. A line of carriages nearly a mile long bearing sorrowing friends to the last and sad rites was a fitting testimonial of the standing of the deceased in the community. The Catholic church could not accommodate the mourners. After the impressive Catholic burial services were over the corpse was borne to the cemetery preceded by the local branch of the C. K. of W. bearing its banner. As the choir sang the last sweet hymn, Rest loved one, rest, tears filled the eyes of many besides relatives. Words of sympathy cannot comfort the sorrowing parents, brothers, and sisters in their affliction, neither can despair claim them as victims. Faith and hope in an eternal future is a solace to them that nothing could replace. They Look to see the breaking day across the mournful marble play and in this trust the character of deceased bears them out. We mourn his untimely death but also wish that our careers, be they long or short, be as upright, our spirits as generous and our eyes undefiled as that of our deceased friend, Eugene McCarthy.

William McCully, a brakeman on the freight run on the Ashland division of the Northwestern railway, was run over and fatally injured Saturday afternoon (Nov. 4) at Underhill while attempting to board his train which was running at a high rate of speed. The train was preparing to leave the Underhill station and had backed up in order to ascend a steep grade. Mr. McCully was standing on the station platform talking to the agents and as his train was passing the station, running at a rapid rate, he jumped for a car but lost his hold and fell under the cars. The wheels passed over his right leg from the ankle to the hip, crushing it to a pulp. The train was immediately stopped and the injured man placed in the caboose, which was detached from the train and hurried to Oconto as quickly as possible. Arriving here he was taken to a private hospital of Mrs. Burke in the South ward. He suffered greatly from the shock, and failed to recover sufficiently to permit the amputation of his leg. He did the following morning at six o'clock, being conscious up to the last half hour of his life. The injured man was deprived a last farewell with his wife and parents. It was hoped he would live longer than he did as the doctors feared that a meeting with his relatives at any time during the few hours he survived the accident would have caused instant death. His parents had arrived in Oconto a short time after the accident and remained the entire night waiting for an opportunity to bid their son farewell. His wife is in a delicate condition, and it was for her own good as well as his that she was not summoned to his bedside. Deceased was about 25 years old, and had been employed on the Ashland division since last June. He was an exemplary young man, greatly admired by his acquaintances, a kind and loving husband and a dutiful son. He was married at Antigo, May 24 and besides his wife he leaves his parents, Mr. and Mrs. John Mc Cully of Cato, four brothers and two sisters. Mr. McCully was a member of the Catholic Order of Foresters and the society took charge of the arrangements for the funeral. The society turned out in a body Sunday and, in spite of the fact that it was raining, accompanied the remains of their departed associate from the hospital on the South side to his late home on upper Main St. The body was taken to Cato, his former home, for burial Monday, accompanied by William Sullivan and Frank Trepanier as a delegation from the local court of the Catholic Order of Foresters, and a committee of railway men from this city consisting of Conductor Ben Bell, James Mulvaney and C. R. Hartley. Owing to her delicate condition, Mrs. McCully was unable to go to Cato to attend the funeral, which was held at that place Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock.-Oconto Enquirer.
