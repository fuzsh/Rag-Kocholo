        "text": "Whoopee, SIP, RCOC/MDOT are about to make your ‘rush hour? ride to and from work and everything in between a snail’s drag race for the next 4-5 years.\n\nJust think about all those shortcuts/detours that will pop up, won’t that be so much fun? Not for me you say, I’ll just jump over to Joslyn or M-24 or Sashabaw.\n\nYa-sure, and what do you think the other 5 to 10,000 other cars will be doing while you’re jumping?\n\nThen there is the other end of this ‘snail drag/rush hour,? what have you accomplished at the finish line?? You will have a two-lane northbound ‘merge left? at Waldon, the very same idiot planning that is now Baldwin at I-75, except north of Waldon.\n\nYou will still have the ‘snakes backache? all the way to Clarkston Road, won’t that be fun? Just look at all this pork in the pan, and we in Lake Orion and Orion Township cannot get a little-o left turn traffic light at southbound M-24 and Atwater, became MDOT does not want to slow the flow of traffic at this location during peak travel (rush/snail) time.\n\nBut maybe, just maybe, within the time frame for the Baldwin job completion, we might just have a large enough ‘body count? with the increased traffic flow that MDOT/RCOC might just see the need, and now that the moratorium along M-24 north of Silverbell has been lifted for ‘one? property owner so she can sell 30 acres.\n\nPicture if you can three (that’s three) more traffic control lights between Silverbell Road and Lake Orion, ah-yes, the lure of county livin, ain’t it great?\n\nRoy Blankenburg\n\nIt should not be a surprise to anyone that Lake Orion Schools is looking at a $3.3 million shortfall, as reported last week in The Orion Review.\n\nBudget shortfalls just don’t happen overnight. They are caused by actions or inactions from previous years. Under board president Leeann Bartley, the board has made decisions that have now come back to bite them.\n\nThe decision to build Oakview Middle School on Lake George Road on the far east side of the school district is a perfect example.\n\nThe school is on an unpaved dirt road, that the district spent over $600,000 ‘to make it safe,? and without public water or sewer.\n\nDid it make any sense to build a second middle school on the east side of M-24, when the population density is on the west side of M-24? I don’t think so.\n\nThe administration told the board that there was no property within the district to build a new middle school.\n\nI don’t think that the administration even tried to find property on the west side of M-24, and none of the board members even questioned the administration about their recommendations.\n\nThere was property on Baldwin Road, north of Friendship Park, where Pulte Homes is now building $500,000 homes, that public water and sewer could have been easily extended to.\n\nThe administration will tell you that the cost of BUILDING Oakview Middle School on Lake George Road has no impact on the $3.3 million shortfall the district is now facing. That is correct, however, the OPERATING cost of Oakview Middle School has a major impact on the current budget.\n\nThe increase in the cost of busing students has to be substantial. The district is not only busing students on the east side of M-24 to the far east side of the district to Oakview, but to balance school populations, the district is also busing students across M-24 to Scripps Middle School.\n\nWe have all seen what has happened to the price of gasoline, and diesel fuel has gone up more. Furthermore, the wear and tear and increased maintenance on the buses driving over dirt roads has to be substantial.\n\nThe fact is that the board is really not interested in saving money.\n\nIn a conversation that I had with former superintendent Dr. Younkman, he told me that the district could have saved 17 percent on high school teachers? salaries by going back to a traditional six period schedule, but the board was not interested.\n\nThe board could have saved about $30,000 last year by not opting out of the November school board election.\n\nNow the board has scheduled their winter workshop at the Boulder Pointe Conference Center in Oxford on Jan. 31.\n\nNot only is that a violation of the Open Meetings Act, but it is another needless expense for the district.\n\nSurely, the board could find conference facilities within one of the district’s own buildings if they were really interested in saving money and setting an example.\n\nHoward Sherman\n\nWith the Snowflake Ball approaching (this Saturday, Jan. 28 at Devil’s Ridge in Oxford), I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the many committee members, who have been working fervently for many months! Thanks to:\n\nSue Welch, Leslie Shields, Sue Borella, Angela Snyder, Sue Willick, Julie Martin, Nanette Montgomery, Lisa Bjork, Bridgette Giampa, Sherry Curtis, Bobbie Tarbunas, Rhonda Pfieffer, and Trisha Donaldson. Together, these ladies have planned a wonderful evening for you!\n\nDiana Ostrand, from Accent on Art, has been an incredible supporter, framing art, and matting and shrinkwrapping our Student Exhibit (currently on display at the Orion Art Center, through Feb. 17).\n\nOf course the ball could not happen without the support of our corporate sponsors:\n\nT&C Credit Union, Oxford Bank, The Marketing Shop, Stephen Auger & Associates, Pine Tree Place, MicroTech Systems, Mary Rodgers Insurance Agency, Inc., Lymtal International, Elite Gymnastics, and Sherman Publications, Inc.\n\nThank you for your generous contributions to support the arts in our community!\n\nI am also grateful to the many businesses and organizations that have supported us with program advertising and donations for our auction.\n\nWe have an outstanding auction this year, it is true community effort that makes this event a success!\n\nFor more information call the art center at 693-4986.\n\nReggie Harrison\n\nOAC Executive Director\n\nLibrary benefits all, not just ‘certain groups?\n\nAs an educator, imagine my surprise to learn that, according to Addison Township trustee Christine Sypitkowski, libraries, like senior centers or parks, exist for the benefit of a ‘certain group? as opposed to ‘something that affects every citizen who lives in Addison Township.?\n\nAccording to my research, the Addison Township Public Library has over 2,400 registered patrons and circulated over 3,000 items in July alone. In addition, these resources were evenly divided between adult items and children’s materials. This library provides more than just books and magazines, such as audio books, preschool story time, summer reading programs, teen book collections, DVDs, videotapes, reference materials, fax facilities, internet, interlibrary loan…well, you get the idea. There is something for everyone.\n\nI’m sure trustee Sypitkowski meant no disrespect to our own township library, yet we need to remember that libraries ? ALL libraries ? are not luxuries designed for special interest groups, but an integral part of an educated society.\n\nLynda Henderson, Lakeville\n\nDDA chair says progress is happening\n\nWe, the board of the Oxford Downtown Development Authority, would like to take this opportunity to wish Amanda Cassidy success in her new job and to thank her for her time and effort on behalf of the DDA during her tenure.\n\nAs the board searches for a new Executive Director, we are committed to the ongoing process of moving Oxford forward. While change is never easy, it does provide an opportunity for regrouping, evaluation, and progress. It is from this vantage that the current DDA board is looking forward.\n\nThe board and our interim Director, Joe Young, are dedicated to the vision of the Main Street USA program and the mission of the DDA to create a viable and successful downtown.\n\nWhile progress may seem slow or non-existent to some at times, it is happening.\n\nWe are happy to welcome three new businesses to the downtown area and are looking forward to the completion of the Centennial Development next to Centennial Park and the Broadway Plaza Development (located where Jeff’s Tire use to be).\n\nDuring the next month we will be placing additional parking signage to help with directing visitors to municipal parking lots; soliciting development proposals for the lots on E. Burdick, finalizing designs for redeveloping the parking lot on the SE section of downtown, working with the Oxford Chamber of Commerce on the upcoming Scarecrow festival; and beginning plans for the Christmas Tree lighting and shopping day.\n\nIn July, the DDA adopted an updated Master Plan which will serve as a guide to the current and future development of Oxford’s downtown and we are working with the Village Council and Planning Commission to have the plan finalized and to begin the implementation of the plan, including a marketing survey to help with attracting businesses to Oxford.\n\nOn going items include the relocation of the house at 19 W. Burdick; redesigning and improving the remaining parking lots, looking into ways to improved traffic and pedestrian flow in the downtown area, and working with current businesses in downtown in an effort to continue improving current conditions.\n\nYet, for all the progress made, much remains to be done (the above ongoing list is a sample of what remains). The DDA board realizes that the efforts of nine members are not enough.\n\nWe appreciate and value each person who volunteers to help us with this effort by serving on one of the four standing subcommittees; organization, design, promotions, and economic redevelopment’as with all volunteer organizations, there is no such thing as too many volunteers.\n\nWe are always in need of additional volunteers and would ask that you consider joining us in our task. If you are interested in volunteering or would like to talk to one of the DDA board, please feel free to contact the DDA at either (248)628-3905 or via our website www.dowtownoxford.org.\n\nKevin A. Stephison,\n\nChairperson, Oxford DDA\n\nSeniors have ‘earned the right? to a center\n\nIn response to C.J.’s comments about the new proposed senior center for Orion, Oxford, and Addison townships…We seniors worked all our lives, paid taxes and have earned the right to have this new center. C.J. says he minds paying taxes for the new center. On an average, the center will cost taxpayers as little as 12 cents a day. Much of the money comes from many other sources.\n\nI, as well as millions of other seniors, have paid school taxes and have not had a child in school for many years, but we understand the need. I don’t like paying taxes for prisons or welfare! Unlike us seniors, those people never worked and paid into the system like us seniors have. In a few years, over half the population will be seniors. You are not paying for our recreation, C.J. We seniors worked very hard for years and through our tax money, the government gives a portion back.\n\nYou are young, C.J., so you call it recreation’we call it therapy for our arthritic bodies. Have you heard the phrase ‘Don’t get surgery, get better?? I have put off surgery for two-and-a-half years now by working out in the pool at Older Persons Commission (OPC) three days a week. The temperature of the water is 92 degrees. We could never use school pools or the Great Lakes Athletic Club pool’too cold and much too expensive, along with other obvious reasons.\n\nAlso, C.J., the Polly Ann Trail that you suggested is all stones across the road from where I live. Seniors cannot walk on that, plus, three-quarters of the year they couldn’t be out in the weather. The senior center has a padded track, and should a senior have a problem, help is there in seconds.\n\nA new senior center in our community will accommodate 100 percent of our seniors, not 1/10 as our one and two rooms do now. OPC is very successful with hundreds of seniors using their facility on a daily basis. Our area has grown so much over the last few years, that’s why we need a new and bigger senior center to accommodate the growing number of seniors in Orion, Oxford and Addison townships.\n\nWe have 10 acres of land donated that won’t cost taxpayers a cent. So, please’residents of this tri-community’vote ‘yes? for the new senior center. If you get a chance before November, please go to OPC in Rochester and view the entire center. Our new center will not be as big or elaborate, but will be ‘ours? and close to home, and help us to live a longer, healthier life.\n\nJoAnn Adkins\n\nOxford Township\n\n96 and going strong …\n\nI thank those who remembered me on my 96th birthday and Kalloway’s for the special treat!\n\nMargaret Stoddard\n\nOxford\n\nI am outraged by the recent article concerning the township’s stand on the HealthFirst shuttle bus for seniors.\n\nEveryone knows there is no such thing as a ‘free lunch? in this world, but this may be the one example to the contrary.\n\nThe doctor bought the bus, pays for the driver, the gas, maintenance and insurance and brings non-driving seniors to the medical building free of charge — then returns them home.\n\nWhere’s the crime? He should be applauded in a day and age when we are nickled and dimed to death for everything.\n\nI have seen all these little trashy signs up for months all over M-24. Why was that allowed and what did that do for the community?\n\nI’d like to know what law he has so seriously violated as to threaten his apparently well-meaning service.\n\nI haven’t heard of the township coming up with anything for our seniors, such as free transportation or any medical office.\n\nI sincerely hope the township sees this for what it truly is, someone being extremely generous to the community. — Mrs. Hogan\n\nI am outraged by the recent article concerning the township’s stand on the HealthFirst shuttle bus for seniors.\n\nEveryone knows there is no such thing as a ‘free lunch? in this world, but this may be the one example to the contrary.\n\nThe doctor bought the bus, pays for the driver, the gas, maintenance and insurance and brings non-driving seniors to the medical building free of charge — then returns them home.\n\nWhere’s the crime?

For all the Board’s mean-spiritedness, our community is no better off financially.\n\nThe same argument applies to the HealthFirst situation and to the audit, which is why I put all three situations in my letter.\n\nThe emphasis of the letter isn’t just the one situation with the bus, but the attitude of the Board in general. Thanks for making this correction. — Carol Roughton\n\nWe support the Orion, Addison, Oxford Tri-Township Senior Center and senior services like NOTA that meet the needs of our growing senior population.\n\nWe believe in taking care of Veterans (many of whom are seniors) and their families who need information and services to care for loved ones.\n\nBeing prepared is our motto — and we believe the senior center prepares all of us for a better future.\n\n— Joel Schleifer, Commander, Sons of the American Legion Lake Orion Squadron #233\n\nWe support the Orion, Addison, Oxford Tri-Township Senior Center and senior services like NOTA that meet the needs of our growing senior population.\n\nWe believe in taking care of Veterans (many of whom are seniors) and their families who need information and services to care for loved ones.\n\nBeing prepared is our motto — and we believe the senior center prepares all of us for a better future.\n\n— Joel Schleifer, Commander, Sons of the American Legion Lake Orion Squadron #233\n\nJudge Lisa Asadoorian has been my colleague and personal friend for over 15 years.\n\nAs a current judge with the 52-3 District Court and as a former prosecutor, magistrate and defense attorney, Judge Asadoorian has sat in every seat in the courtroom.\n\nHer experience along with her strong work ethic and respect and compassion for all who appear before her, make her uniquely qualified to continue to serve as a district court judge.\n\n— Cheryl A. Matthews, Judge, Oakland County Circuit Court\n\nI would like to thank Judge Lisa Asadoorian for her dedication, commitment and compassion to our community and students in Lake Orion.\n\nI am continually impressed with her candor and enthusiasm towards making Lake Orion a better place to live.\n\nI urge our community to support her in the November election as she has supported our community, schools and childrren for the past six years.\n\n— Michelle Novak\n\nSorry, Mr. Dan Dewey, that you feel I should be apologetic for expressing my opinion on the issue of both an Orion Township trustee and his wife holding Township positions; one as an elected official and the other as a full-time employee in the Clerk’s office.\n\nAs an observer, I was only bringing up a comparison; that what seems to be good for some is not good for others in Orion Township politics.\n\nI try to get to as many township meetings as I can, so I can see first-hand what is going on.\n\nHardly anyone attends these meetings unless there is an issue that affects their neighborhood, or when someone is receiving an award or proclamation.\n\nMr. Dewey. I feel I do not owe anyone an apology for expressing my opinion. That is our right in a free democracy: Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press.\n\n— James B. Delavan\n\nShould the Village of Oxford become a city?\n\nGenerally, people in favor of cityhood say that they don’t like paying both Village and Township taxes.\n\nCertainly no one likes to pay taxes!\n\nHowever, consider what services each provide. Consider how much of the Township tax you pay that may be somewhat duplicated by the Village. If one excludes such things as Fire and EMS, Library, Parks & Rec., and School taxes, on a home valued at approximately $200,000 you are paying about $125 per year to the township. What do we get for $125?\n\nWell for one thing we get a VOTE! We can elect the Township Board, we can serve on the Township Board, and we can serve on various committees that impact our community, such as planning and development committees.\n\nIf we were to become a City, do you know that a City can impose higher millages without a vote?\n\nDo you know that a City can impose a City income tax? Do you know that we would likely still pay Township taxes for Fire and EMS, Library, and Parks & Rec. or pay higher fees for the use of these services?\n\nAnd ask yourself this question, will the litigation and attorney fees involving the Township and City stop? I think not! And in all likelihood the disputes will become even more intense.\n\nWill you actually pay less tax? Again, the answer is likely no!! Members on the cityhood committee have repeatedly said they don’t know what the taxes would be. It seems to me that we should be asking if we can dissolve the village and only have one form of government, which based on current State law would be a township.\n\nThere is also a State Boundary Commission public hearing scheduled for 4 p.m. on Thursday May 3, 2007 at the Oxford Middle School. Why at 4 pm when most people are at work? Never-the-less this is an important issue and I encourage all to attend.\n\nCharlie Stevens\n\nNOTE: The comments above are my personal comments, however, I am President of the Oxford Lakes Homeowners Association\n\nThe people who pushed for the cityhood adventure with their secret ‘invitation only? meetings are no longer even Oxford residents. So, if this group wasn’t open and honest in the beginning ? what makes it that way now?\n\nWhat kind of answers will you really get when government is backing something? Remember the old ‘half-truth? days of Gary Ford? Remember who backed a police chief and an entity gone wild? Remember how the truth didn’t unfold until voters were smart enough to cut off the cash flow and read between the lines?\n\nMore than once I have heard that becoming a city will end all that double-dipping, but nobody really says what double-dipping will be eliminated other than ‘you will no longer have to pay township taxes on top of village taxes.?\n\nTruth? Half-truth?\n\nOxford Township keeps only .95 of one mill paid by Oxford taxpayers ? not even one mill! So becoming a city will knock off less than one mill. Whoopee!!! And in exchange, the new city can pick up the added expense of maintaining a cemetery, establishing an election and assessment department, sending out taxes, etc. They will also lose township tax dollars ? part of that lowly mill ? that was captured and returned to the village to fund their Downtown Development Authority.\n\nVillage officials refused to accept Christine Burns? letter of resignation ? proving she must have been an exceptional employee. So why didn’t the same officials even comment on her unbiased thesis ? her extensive research that proved Cityhood WOULD NOT save village residents any money?\n\nAlthough townships require the vote of the people to raise taxes ? villages and cities do not. But there are limits on how many mills officials can raise their no-vote tax. Did you know becoming a city raises those limits from what a village allows? Doesn’t that translate into more money for government to spend with no vote!\n\nBut of course ? official proponents say they will not raise taxes, they will not implement a city income tax like most cities have ? they will reduce taxes, they will not lead you astray, they will tell you the truth.\n\nSomething sounds very familiar ? doesn’t it?\n\nSue Bellairs\n\nOxford\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI will admit that I do not read the Clarkston Village meeting minutes in the Clarkston News as there is even less content in this “summary” version than there is in the official full version.\n\nHowever, I noticed that the date of the meeting minutes is Feb. 13 and published in the paper on Feb. 29, 16 days later and after the next meeting of the council has taken place.\n\nIf someone had an issue with what the Council did, they would not be able to publicly comment to the Council until two meetings or four weeks later Ordinaces generally have a 20 day period until they go into effect after being approved by the Council.\n\nIf one only went by the minutes published in the newspaper, it would be too late to address the council on the matter as it would be at least two meetings, four weeks or 28 days later.\n\nThe open meetings act require meeting minutes to be available eight business days after the meeting takes place.\n\nBy my count, that would be Thursday of the following week for the regular Monday meetings and in time for readng before the next meeting.\n\nOf course the city does not generally follow this rule and I have found it impossible to get any informaton, including meeting agenda and minutes, no matter how many times I ask.\n\nPerhaps they only want the public to read the approved minutes even though it provides little opportunity to publicly discuss an issue. Perhaps they just don’t want anyone to know what they are doing.\n\nCory Johnston\n\nClarkston\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI wish to comment Mr Larry Rosso for his long and valued service on the Independence Township Board.\n\nLarry was always a moderate and thoughtful voice on a board that could get very contentious and he also acted as chair during the long absence of Supervisor Wagner.\n\nI feel the township residents owe Larry a big thank-you for 16 years of dedicated service on the board and hope we do not lose his thoughts and ideas as he leaves the board. Best Wishes Larry!\n\nJim Reed\n\nIndependence Township\n\n‘Disappointed? by schools\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI had high hopes that a new Clarkston superintendent would end the secrecy and arrogance that seemed to pervade the previous administration and certain board of education members.\n\nHowever, it was very disappointing to read that Dr. Rod Rock believes it is “wasteful” for a district resident and taxpayer to use the law to obtain information that many school districts make public. (“FOIAs Under Fire,” Oct. 12).\n\nThis is the same superintendent who recently leveraged taxpayer resources to criticize charter schools. Apparently, it’s not “wasteful” when you spend the people’s money on issues you support.\n\nIt is equally disaappointing that several board members have joined the “move on, there’s nothing to see here” bandwagon. Diversionary tactics — such as insinuating that the citizen in question is in cahoots with the local paper — only reinforce the notion that there is something to hide.\n\nUntil certain Clarkston Schools leaders learn what transparency means, I don’t care if Santa Claus files FOIA requests and pays for them with money from the Easter Bunny, if that’s what it takes to get answers.\n\nKelly Kolhagen\n\nIndependence Township\n\nSunlight best disinfectant\n\nDear Editor,\n\nThere have been statements made that a member of the community is wasting the school district’s time and resources by making FOIA requests for information which some on the Board and in the administration feel is a fishing expedition.\n\nLet’s be clear on a very important point: community oversight of our elected and appointed officials is not just a community right, it is a community responsibility and it can only be accomplished with adequate information in a format that lends itself to review and analysis.\n\nIn the absence of full, voluntary disclosure on the part of officials, the law provides citizens with a tool to use to obtain the needed information ? the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThis tool provides the community with access to sufficient information to be able to make an informed judgment regarding the performance of those officials who hold the public trust when complete information is not readily available to the community for whatever reason.\n\nTo those on the board and in the administration who are opposed to these requests, my suggestion is to re-examine their position regarding the voluntary release of information and to encourage members of the community to become involved at a more granular level of detail in the areas of greatest concern such as finance and policy.\n\nIf no problems are found, this assistance will still enable the district to stretch its scarce resources by engaging these additional creative minds in process improvement.\n\nOn the other hand, if there are problems they can be identified early and corrected quickly because in the words of US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis ‘Sunlight is the best disinfectant?.\n\nLawrence Matta\n\nIndependence Township\n\nPublic has right to know\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI am in shock at the tone and comments coming from the Clarkston School Superindent and some School Board members (“FOIAs under fire,”Oct. 12).\n\nThese are the people we assume are establishing the policies for educating our students and I presume that includes civics and law. Instead of my usual long winded complaints, I offer the following explanation from the Michigan Legislature as contained in a very good document on the Michigan Freedom of Information and Open Meetings Acts which is available for free and online from www.Michigan.gov. This is what it says:\n\nAvailability of Public Records:\n\nAny person may ask to inspect, copy or receive a copy of a public record. There are no qualifications such as residency or age.\n\nAs soon as practical, but not more than five business days after receiving a request, the public body must respond to a request for a public record. Under unusual circumstances, the time can be extended by 10 days.\n\nThe public body or agency has a responsibility to provide reasonable facilities so that persons making a request may examine and take notes from public records. The facilities must be available during the normal business hours of the public body. A public body may make reasonable rules necessary to protect its public records and to prevent excessive and unreasonable interference with the discharge of its functions.\n\nMy opinion is that it is public information, created, compiled and maintained with public money. Therefore, in accordance with the law, the public has the right to any information for any reason, even if it is just because they are curious and want to know how their tax money is being spent. So tell the School Board to stop their whining and get back to educating the public, whether student or parent. It is not the School Board’s information, it is ours.\n\nCory Johnston\n\nClarkston\n\nFOIAs waste of money\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI concur with Kelli Horst’s views that Dawn Schaller is wasting our tax payer dollars on ridiculous FOIA requests. I believe this is part of a bigger effort to tear apart the fabric of public education. Now is the time to rally and support our public schools before this uniquely American success story is undermined by for-profit corporations.\n\nThank you,\n\nAnn Lehman-Rittinger\n\nDavisburg\n\nOutraged by newspaper\n\nDear Editor,\n\nAs a parent of children that attend Clarkston Community Schools, I am outraged that your newspaper is supporting the crazy antics of a delusional resident of Clarkston.\n\nDr. Rod Rock has done an amazing job of being the superintendent of Clarkston Schools. He has opened lines of communication that were not open before. He has also gone above and beyond in keeping Clarkston residents informed about all of the changes that could be occurring in education funding and policies.\n\nIf there is no evidence of wrongdoing, please let him get back to doing what he does best ? caring for the education of our kids.\n\nNoelle Collis\n\nGet behind Dr. Rock\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI, too, have had many frustrations over Mrs. Schaller’s relentless campaign to expose some type of fraud or misspending on the part of the Clarkston School District (‘FOIA questions focus on school spending,? Oct. 12). I think after 18 months and 4,760 pages of information, she should stop wasting our time and money.\n\nI am focused on moving forward with our new superintendent and excited about the direction in which he is moving our district. I have noted the School Board members who support Mrs. Schaller and will not vote for them. I want them to move into the future and get behind Dr. Rock. He has new and exciting ideas that I want to explore for the sake of my two children currently in the Clarkson school system. The recent economic situation within our state calls for new and inventive practices, not conspiracy theories.\n\nOf great concern to me is why the Clarkston News supported Mrs. Shaller’s efforts by supplying her with money. Isn’t this the time when we should be working together to create solutions and a new paradigm rather than steeping ourselves in past practices?\n\nAimee Baker\n\nDavisburg\n\nI think C.J. hit the nail on the head about the Planning Commission trying to run Kohl’s out of town. What are they thinking? Is this the same commission that just let Waterstone run rampant and build whatever they wanted? Now that we have more people around here than we can handle with hardly any shopping, you wold think that we would welcome a business like Kohl’s with open arms.\n\nMark Skrzypczak, Oxford\n\nFirst of all, I must state that I have never agreed with C.J. Carnacchio’s point of view in the past. However, that all changed when I read his column on the ridiculous requirements the Oxford Township Planning Commission is requesting Kohl’s to meet.\n\nWhat is wrong with these people? If I were Kohl’s, I would tell Oxford to take a hike. My neighbors and I have been chomping at the bit, waiting for Kohl’s to come here, and then I read last week’s Leader article on what Oxford is asking them to do and I was flabbergasted. I mean, let’s face it, these little downtown shops that keep opening up and then closing six months later are not cutting it. It’s nice that we have a quaint little downtown, but these shops are not going to help Oxford’s economy or tax base. And another thing ? C.J. was right ? we don’t walk around in barn boots in Oxford, not unless you live on a farm, which most of us here do not.\n\nNow, I am beginning to understand why there is such little economic or any other type of healthy growth in Oxford. The decision-makers just want themselves to seem important in front of a group of people, spew a bunch of nonsense and expel the hot air that they are so full of. They don’t care about Oxford in the least.\n\nDawn Gwisdalla, Oxford\n\nKudos to you for your recent articles on NOTA. It is high time that the truth comes out into the light. Your questions and research are just what is needed. You are exposing the old-boy network for what it is ? stagnation and self-serving political oligarchy sustained by a group of back-stabbing, co-dependant individuals with secretive and undisclosed agendas. When challenged, they hide behind speech limitations at meetings and meaningless circuitous answers and comments, all not answering the real questions. What answer is given depends on which old-boy is speaking.\n\nI have several questions which require answers: What were the purposes of the catered affairs and how much was spent on them? Do the NOTA minutes reflect the appointment or election of Eric Wilson as a member of the board ‘at large,? or did he simply stay on after his term expired? Why has the NOTA board permitted on alleged member to vote on anything? Will the NOTA facilities again be used for meetings to promote the tri-township senior center? If so, by whose authority and expense? How much taxpayer money is being expended to appeal the ruling in the NOTA vs. Poole unemployement case?\n\nI sincerely hope that this entire fiasco will soon be opened to public view and knowledge.\n\nSereal Gravlin\n\nLakeville\n\nNo more restrictions\n\nDear Editor:\n\nThanks for asking our opinion on this issue.\n\nI believe the current burning ordinance works well. You have to register with the Fire Department, a burning permit is issued, only certain days of the month are designated as burn days, restrictions apply to what can be burned, and if you are sensitive to smoke, you know what days to close the doors and windows.\n\nFurther restrictions are unnecessary. If I wanted Big Brother to regulate everything I did, I would move to the southeast section of Oakland County.\n\nThank You,\n\nLarry Liggett\n\nSome limits helpful\n\nDear Editor:\n\nThere are many interesting issues that can be discussed related to the burning privileges we enjoy in Independence Township. I believe the majority of people who live in this semi-rural community would have a major problem not being able to exercise our right to dispose of leaves, sticks, brush in an environmentally friendly manner. When brush is dry and burned, there is little smoke. Filling our landfills with compostable matter in not an acceptable alternative.\n\nI have to ask myself, how long has the person with allergies lived here? She should have educated herself on community policies before moving here. In any densely populated areas in this township such as neighborhood areas, there usually is no burning. It is mainly the residents with larger lots and large amounts of brush/leaves that burn. If you burn on non-windy days, smoke rises with the heat.\n\nI suggest publishing guidelines that only Dry brush / leaves should be burned on non-windy so all understand. Possibly limit burning to exclude Sundays. Six days a week should be enough. Every other week would be reasonable.\n\nPhil Zuelke\n\nStop lighting up\n\nDear Editor:\n\nNo smoke please. There are many alternatives to leaf burning.\n\nNot only is the smoke toxic there is also a danger of fire spreading to my property and burning down all my beautiful trees.\n\nI also have COPD and it makes it hard for me to breathe.\n\nLillian Hall Christein\n\nChanges would make burn policy clearer\n\nDear Editor:\n\nI am in favor of continuing the burning permit policy. We do not burn leaves. We mulch them.\n\nHowever, I have a suggestion: Instead of four days a week on the first and third week of each month (8 burn days) how about choosing the same two days out of every week. For instance every Tuesday and Thursday or every Monday and Wednesday.\n\nThis way when the weather doesn’t cooperate (rain and/or ozone days) you don’t have to wait two week before burning.\n\nIt would also be easier to remember whether or not it is a burn day.\n\nCliff and Dolores Smart\n\nJean’s story\n\nDear Editor,\n\nOur friend, Jim Sherman, Sr., was kind enough to drop off the July 20 copy of The Clarkston News because he knew I would want to read the article about Jean Saile.\n\nI was fortunate to be working at The Oxford Leader as a typesetter when Jean was at The News and of course became one of her many friends and admirers. I think anyone who ever met Jean was a friend!\n\nAlthough we hadn’t kept in touch for the last 20 years or so, I treasure the memories from our past acquaintance’some parties at the old house and elsewhere’but mostly feel I was privileged to know and love her. I loved working with her and am certain she had no equal as a newspaperman ? or woman.\n\nYour coverage of her life in The News was excellent and I enjoyed reading the whole paper. Thank you.\n\nSue Stilwell\n\nOxford\n\nGarden Walk\n\nDear Editor,\n\nThe Clarkston Farm and Garden Club would like to thank Clarkston homeowners Patricia Clees and Dennis Kwasny, Diane and Henry Woloson, Raeann and David Spanks, Sue and Bob White, Virgil and Diane Roberts, Pat and Doug Bailey and the Community Garden volunteers for opening their gardens for the 2011 Garden Walk.\n\nThe gardens are beautiful and the many extras that our gardeners added for the walk are appreciated. About 400 people from Clarkston and surrounding areas visited the gardens.\n\nWe would like to thank community members and businesses who supported the walk. Local restaurants provided specials, businesses supported a beautiful garden guide. Volunteer musicians and artists played and painted in the gardens. Local artists sold pieces at an Artist Market at Independence Township Library, which hosted the event for the second year.\n\nFunds raised will be used for scholarships for high school graduates, grants and programs for Clarkston staff and students, plantings for the Main Street planters, and Independence Township Library gardens.\n\nClarkston Farm & Garden Club\n\nConcerts in park\n\nDear Editor,\n\nAs the Clarkston Area Chamber of Commerce wraps up the 32nd Season for Concerts in the Park, I would like to extend a special thank you to the City of the Village for their support in helping us host these popular concerts.\n\nDPW’s Jason, in particular, was an outstanding resource to have on site each evening. He helped with traffic congestion, crowd control, handicap accessibility and electrical support. Crowds have been big. Great weather, good bands and an eager community have helped us average nearly 2,500 each evening.\n\nThere have been some electrical issues this summer. From the very beginning the city was alert to the issue and proactive in resolving the problem.\n\nI’m very grateful that we have so many people come out and attend the concerts. And I am equally grateful that we have the helpful and caring staff and support at the city offices.\n\nSee you next year for our 33rd Season when the Chamber will once again host six more free concerts in Depot Park.\n\nPenny Shanks, executive director, Clarkston Area Chamber of Commerce\n\nTo the editor, taxpayers and concerned citizens of Brandon Township:\n\nBy law, a Township Treasurer is required to appoint a Deputy Treasurer (MSL 41.77), to act in his/her absence. The law does not require an oath of loyalty as implied by Linda Owen in her recent letter to the editor.\n\nFor 13 years I acted as the Deputy Treasurer, fulfilling my duties in a professional and efficient manner. In the past, Mrs. Owen has always given me an excellent or above average in my performance appraisals. Prior to being fired by the Treasurer, my service record was free of any discipline, verbal or written counseling, or any other documented corrective management memos.\n\nNot only was I the Deputy Treasurer, I was and still am a concerned citizen of Brandon Township. I am well respected by the business associates that I have dealt with and my former co-workers.\n\nIt was only after I informed Treasurer Owen that it was my intention to run for the office of treasurer during the 2004 election that my loyalty, efficiency, and commitment to the citizens of Brandon Township was questioned by Treasurer Owen. If loyalty means blindly following orders no matter if they are legal or morally ethical, then the treasurer is correct, I was not loyal to her. I was loyal to the people of Brandon Township and the job they paid me to do.\n\nSince the last election, the actions of Treasurer Owen have not shown to be fiscally responsible for the tax dollars entrusted to her.\n\nTrust works both ways. When you can no longer trust the person you helped to elect, to do what is in the best interest of the people she represents, it is time to take a stand and speak out. Unfortunately, I was fired for exercising that right.\n\nDiana Reckwald\n\nBrandon Township\n\nJust before Christmas while meeting with a client, I could not help but notice that he (my client) looked extremely frail and had, obviously, lost a lot of weight.\n\nWhen I inquired as to his weight loss, my client advised me that he could not understand why he was so weak and had lost so much weight and had recently had a complete physical at a nearby hospital and had been advised that there was ‘nothing wrong with him.?\n\nI could see, with my own eyes, that there was something very wrong with him and I called my personal physician, Nathan Chase, M.D., and I asked him if he would be willing to meet with my client. Dr. Chase indicated that he was leaving on vacation the following day, however, based upon what I told him, he would meet with my client at 8 a.m. the following morning prior to leaving on his vacation. Thank God he did.\n\nDr. Chase diagnosed my client’s problem as a severe endocardiac infection which without treatment would surely have been fatal.\n\nDr. Chase’s willingness to meet with my client on a day he was leaving for his own vacation saved my client’s life.\n\nAfter a 10 day stay in the hospital and approximately one more month of IV treatment at home, my client will recover fully and return to good health.\n\nHow lucky we are in Clarkston to have such a dedicated physician, who not only is an expert in what he does, but is willing to meet, diagnose and treat a patient and sacrifice his own personal time to meet and care for a patient due to a telephone call from a fellow member of his community.\n\nMy personal thanks to Nathan Chase, M.D.\n\nRobert E. Kostin\n\nClarkston\n\nTo the editor:\n\nAs responsible American citizens it is our right, as well as our civic duty to vote in all elections. But when the people come out to cast their vote and their polling location has been changed or closed, with no sign giving the relocation site or reason for the closure of the precinct, who is ultimately responsible for the disenfranchisement of these voters? Though the new locations were listed in some newspapers, not everyone was aware of it. After the serious issues that have been raised regarding the voting rights that were denied to citizens in past elections throughout the country one would think that new processes would have been implemented to prevent further impediments to the people being able to exercise their right to vote. When the basic electoral process has flaws they need to be addressed immediately to prevent denial of the privilege and obligation of the citizens to vote and be counted. If we are truly a nation ‘of the people, by the people and for the people,? then who is responsible to assure that the people’s voices are heard?\n\nOn Saturday Feb. 7, 2004 at 12:15 pm I headed out to the polls to cast my vote in the 8th Congressional District for the Michigan Democratic Caucus in Ortonville, but to my surprise the precinct was closed. There was no sign on the door of the Intermediate school that is the site where I normally vote. I went to the entrance on the other side of the building and still no signs. Because there were cars and people around I went inside and found that a basketball tournament was going on. When I asked at the concession area where to vote one person responded: ‘what caucus?? Another then told me that it had been moved to the Old Town Hall on Mill Street. Relieved, though concerned about the lack of organization or notification, I went on my way. Imagine my astonishment when the Town Hall was closed and no notice was posted there either. Because Ortonville is such a small village the options were quite limited as to where the voting could be held so I tried the Township offices, which were also closed with no sign. Frustrated and almost ready to give up, I drove to the Fire Department, where a fireman was very helpful and sent me to the Brandon Township Library, where the Caucus had been moved. Ironically, it is near the same parking lot as the regular location for voting in my district, but had no signs outside the building to identify it as the new location. Once inside the library, I found the new site and was able to cast my vote.\n\nBecause I feel very strongly that voting is vital in a democratic society, I wanted to be sure that those who came after me did not have to endure the hassle I had gone through, so I asked the people working the polls if they would put a sign outside. One of the people responded: ‘Of course, we want everyone to be able to vote that wants to.? (Isn’t that the whole point of holding elections?) He then moved a sign on an easel outside the entrance of the building. I thanked him and left.\n\nAs I drove home, the whole incident began to bother me. Had the community not been so small, I would not have been able to find the new location and exercise my right to vote. I can certainly understand the concerns and feelings of anger and frustration of those in the Detroit districts whose polling locations had also been closed without notice of relocation who ended up not getting to cast their votes. In a time of apathy and dissatisfaction where the people are calling for serious changes to the way our government operates, it is imperative that if they make the effort to get out to vote they should be provided with an appropriate place for their vote to be counted. As a democratic society we need to encourage, rather than discourage, people to vote in order to have a truly representative government at all levels.\n\nI am puzzled and disturbed by the lack of consideration shown to the voters by incidences such as these. Who decided to move the location for the Caucus? Why? (I know how important basketball tournaments can be, but was it more imperative than an election?) Why were no signs posted at the original location or at the new location? And why should this type of blatant disregard for the people’s rights be tolerated? What else can be expected of the people, if they fulfill their duty by being present and ready to be counted? In my case, because of the small town, I went home, printed out signs for the location change and posted them at all the places I had checked, but they were not up until 1:00 pm. How many other people showed up to vote prior to me, but became frustrated or outraged and gave up and went home leaving their voices unheard? Posting signs was a simple solution to a problem of utmost importance, which took me a total of 15 minutes. Whoever made the decision to move the location or anyone involved at any level of the process could have taken the time to do the same thing to help facilitate the election. Was this incident, or those in Detroit, a case of oversight, incompetence, or a deliberate effort to sabotage another election? Only those responsible for their actions or inactions know for sure.\n\nObviously the system is broken and needs to be fixed. After the embarrassing national election debacle in Florida in 2000, among others, one would think that some very serious issues would have been addressed to prevent any further incidents of voting mishaps. If the people are willing to do their part by showing up to cast their votes, then the government or political party responsible is obligated to assure that the officials in charge do their part to provide them the opportunity to fulfill their duty as citizens of a democratic society. The American people want their voices to be heard and rights to be guaranteed. Who will step up and take the responsibility to ensure that this is possible? Would someone just give me a sign to let me know that the voice of the American people will truly be heard?\n\nKim Bildson\n\nBrandon Township\n\nYou admit that you are not familiar with the facts about ‘Education YES?, and yet you feel qualified to judge both the system and the school administrators who must implement it. Although I am not an expert, I have read about and attended information sessions on the impact of Education Yes on Michigan’s education system. Here are some of the problems that we face in Michigan:\n\nOn February 8, I read in the Detroit News how PSAT scores for Michigan students have to be ‘supplemented? by additional points in order to bring them up to a level to compete with the other states in the nation in the National Merit Scholarship Competition. Only one state in the nation (Indiana) has more points added to scores than Michigan. (How many National Merit Finalists did Clarkston High School have last spring? ? the answer will surprise you).\n\nOn February 4, the Wall Street Journal ran a feature article, second in a series of two, where they discuss the discriminatory nature of ‘No Child Left Behind? ? the federal program that fathered ‘Education YES? in Michigan. These ‘Accountability? programs discriminate against our most able students. (Home school districts are withholding information and referrals for gifted students to attend specialized schools so that their per child dollars and the students? above average test scores will remain in the home district).\n\nAn October 28, 2003 article in the Michigan Education Digest discusses why colleges and universities are spending precious resources on remedial courses, mentoring and tutoring programs because of grade inflation in the high schools. (students are earning more A’s and learning less).\n\nEducation YES is discriminatory against academic achievers, is statistically next to impossible to achieve (from Bruce Beamer’s presentation to the School Board early in 2003) and uses an inaccurate measuring tool (the MEAP test) to determine funding for our schools. Schools labeled as ‘Exemplary? within the last two years are now being labeled as ‘failing? because of Education YES.\n\nDespite all this, we still have a member of the School Board who will argue that dollars to fund athletics should be taken out of the savings that Clarkston holds against cuts in state funding for education. What we in Michigan need to understand is that we depend on these students for our future. If we do not focus on educating them properly, more businesses will leave Michigan, more jobs will leave Michigan, and our children will find it difficult to earn a decent living.\n\nYou are quick to find fault with our administrators, who are trying desperately to provide a good education to students in Clarkston, while spending countless hours on a worthless state-mandated program. I believe that the fault more properly lies with politicians like those who implemented Education YES without consulting with educators and without regard to possible outcomes for our students. (And the people who vote for them). Perhaps, before you put ‘pen to paper? in the future, you should take a closer look at the real issues.\n\nSherri Kerby\n\nPresident\n\nAcademic Boosters of Clarkston\n\nMallia offers mea culpa for sign violations\n\nTo the residents of the Village of Leonard,\n\nIn response to C.J. Carnacchio’s column dated October 23, I do humbly offer my apologies to the residents of the village. C.J. was very correct in pointing out that I had violated election law by not having placed the proper information on my campaign signs.\n\nI clearly did omit the information and have since corrected my oversight.\n\nTo those who have supported me in the past, I do not want to offer an excuse in this matter; I accept my responsibilities as village president and as an elected official.\n\nI have worked hard in the Village over the last 16 years and will continue to do so in the future.\n\nLeonard Village President Eugene Mallia\n\nDisagreed with vandalism, comments\n\nI do agree with Sarah Reyes that no one has the right to destroy anyone’s property–her McCain campaign signs were slashed by vandals. That’s just not right.\n\nWhat troubles me is two of her statements:\n\n‘What kind of neighborhood are we in??\n\nWell, Sarah, the people of Oxford area are good, honest, hard-working moral people! Her other statement: ‘It just shows what kind of people are really rooting for the other candidate.? (Obama)\n\nCome on, Sarah! They are the same great, hardworking, moral people that want (what’s in their opinion) the best for our beautiful wonderful country.\n\nCarole Marshall\n\nAddison Township\n\nThanks for a great homecoming\n\nDear Parents of the Class of 2009 that helped:\n\nWe would like to thank the parents that have helped with the Homecoming Floats over the past years. While we were in School, You were running for supplies so no time was wasted during float building. For the parents who sacrificed their evenings, weekends and their families, Mr. Couch, Mr. Rizzo, Mrs. Bosetti. Somehow we finished it all and with your support.\n\nWe would also like to thank The Moses Family that helped with the Sound system and sign on our floats. The support we have had from more parents that are not mentioned here. You all know your part of the class of 2009. The Photos taken will be part of history. The laughs, the poses and the paint. We only took one first place. That’s fine. We finished and marched proudly. Now it will be time for us to watch to see what everyone else will create. We could not have done any of this with out any of you.\n\nKatherine Bosetti, Class of 2009\n\n‘Stop throwing your weight around?\n\nMyself and all affected residents came to you a while back with a signed petition to stop sidewalk construction on our street. Ultimately you chose to ignore it, and you chose to ignore us. In the end, you were able to spend your grant money before you were required to, as you say, ‘give it back?. Congratulations to you all, you spent it, you beat the deadline. Those sidewalks are now in. You got what you wanted ? what YOU wanted. And now the entire community knows that you plainly do what you want, when you want, no matter who’s involved or what’s at stake. High fives all around! If you’re a resident and you have an issue or complaint and want to be heard, you’ve pretty much told us that we’re better off standing on the corner of M-24 and Burdick ? wearing a sandwich board ? than to gain the sympathetic ear of a council member. You WON! You must feel so proud of yourselves! Council 1. Residents 0. NEXT!\n\nTo all the residents on the original plan to have sidewalks installed on your property ? but escaped the destruction of your yard and privacy this time, know this: you will not matter and your opinions will not matter. If you go to council meetings next year to have your sidewalk project stopped about all you’re likely to get from them is a distant, sort of deer-in-the-headlights stare and an undeserved dose of near complete indifference. That is, if things go for you like they went for us. I wish you all luck. Let me know how it all works out, but I’m not about to cancel my plan to ride a bike in your yard in the very near future. Even if that new sidewalk leads to nowhere and connects with nothing!\n\nOn the Sept. 11, 2007 (last village council election) we had 3,540 residents, of those residents 2,361 were registered voters. Not a bad percentage. But of those registered voters, only 288 (12.2%) showed up to vote for any of you. In other words 87.8 percent of the registered voters didn’t think enough about you or your position to get up off the couch to cast a vote. Well over 2,000 of them would rather watch Seinfeld re-runs or take a vacuum to the basement stairs than be bothered by what you campaigned for in that election. I would even go as far as to say that if you were to ask anyone who lives here to name even one of their Village’s Council members you’d be lucky to get one correct answer. Based on those numbers, I believe it is safe to say that a very large segment of the population doesn’t give a darn about what you do here. So please stop throwing your weight around town as if you feel you have the support of the masses. You now know the numbers. Be a neighbor once in a while, I challenge you.\n\nBill Savage\n\nOxford\n\nDear editor,\n\nThe Orion Township Fire Fighters Goodfellows would like to thank all those who made our 2010 Christmas Food Baskets a success. Local Orion and Oxford businesses donated everything from cash to turkeys and Barbie dolls to smoke detectors.\n\nResidents purchased a special Goodfellows edition of The Lake Orion Review (donated by The Review) and gave us toys, cash and winter clothes. The Orion Township Fire Department provided working space so we could load it all up and deliver it. The heartfelt gratitude expressed by the families who received the baskets made it all worthwhile.\n\n-Orion Township Fire\n\nFighters Goodfellows\n\nDear Editor,\n\nAs the United States search for ways to promote peace and global understanding, one key initiative is taking place right here in our own Clarkston neighborhoods.\n\nFeb. 24 through March 2 will mark the 3rd Annual AYUSA Host Family Appreciation Week. This is a time for saluting families around the country that have opened their hearts and homes to international exchange students.\n\nNow more than ever, student exchange programs help pave the road to peace and global understanding. It has been the warmth of the people here that has made it possible for Clarkston to enhance our community through international friendships.\n\nTo all the host families in Clarkston: Thank you for being a true example of American goodwill and hospitality. I invite others in our community to also get involved in this great community-building activity that not only enriches our community, but also our country.\n\nCindy Dibble\n\nCommunity Representative\n\nAYUSA International\n\nDear Editor,\n\nThe next meeting concerning Parke Lake, and its watershed, will be held on Thursday, March 20 at 7 p.m. at the Independence Township Firehouse #1.\n\nAmong the matters to be discussed at the meeting are: status of the City of Clarkston storm water management plans, the pollution plumb spreading from the former gas station at the corner of Main Street and Clarkston Road, the pollution plumb spreading from the former landfill (i.e. Powell Dump) which is located north of Clarkston Road and east of Perry Lake Road, and lawn treatments and water quality.\n\nTom Stone\n\nDave McCarty\n\nFred Roeser\n\nClarkston\n\n…land conservancy\n\nDear Editor,\n\nRaising healthy vibrant communities with clean air and open space was the focus of ‘Motown Pride-Hometown Conservation?, our local land conservancy’s annual Wild Night Out fundraising event.\n\nThanks to the guests, auction donors, advertisers, volunteers and sponsors who so generously supported this event.

Total run of the city, treats from everyone, lots of petting and prizes.\n\nWe could do without the silly clothes and hats but we have to humor the humans or they get difficult to control, and it is nice to get dressed up, go downtown and see friends.\n\nWe do appreciate the prize for most humorous (the king plays the fool well), but everyone should know that we will be vigilant in protecting our kingdom from tyrants.\n\nSonny, Riley and Sadie\n\nThe Three Musketeers , Clarkston\n\n…Friendly Forest\n\nDear Editor,\n\nThe Clarkston Area Optimist Club would like to thank our co-sponsor, Independence Parks and Recreation Depart, and the Clarkston community for making our Friendly Forest event on Saturday, October 23, at Clintonwood Park a tremendous success. Thanks to the Parks and Rec.

A huge thank you to Mike Lewis, Shelley Schwaderer Roland, Justin Harris, and the many other directing support staff, for their dedication, hard work and love for music in this district which is constantly shown to our young musicians every day!\n\nThere are many Clarkston area businesses, including the Clarkston News, that support Clarkston Schools Instrumental Music Association, CSIMA. A special thanks also to Guido’s Pizza, Wendy’s and Uncle Peter’s.\n\nCSIMA would not be able to put on such an event without you and we thank you so very much! I also want to thank all the parents who come out and watch our marching band, rain or shine!\n\nAnd most importantly, I’m so proud of the Clarkston High School Marching Band students!\n\nI’ve had the privilege to have three of my children in marching band over the last six years, so I know the endless hours these students spend preparing for competition.\n\nI thank them for marching a beautiful show and want them to know how special they are and that they are some of the finest musicians in the state of Michigan!\n\nKelly Finazzo, president, CSIMA\n\n…golf outing\n\nDear Editor,\n\nClarkston Area Youth Assistance would like to thank all those who participated in the 17th Annual Golf Outing at Fountains Golf and Banquet Center on June 18, 2010.

These include the library and police.\n\nBecause of dropping revenues due to drop in property values, the police also request a millage increase to maintain current staffing levels. The township had to let three deputies go for 2010 due to budget cuts. Without the increase, eight more deputies will need to be cut for next year, with additional deputies cut each year thereafter. Police for the township is totally funded by the police millages.\n\nBecause of current economic conditions, library use is up, especially relating to job searches. Ninety percent of the library’s operating revenue comes from the library millage. About eight percent of revenue comes from library users and two percent from other sources. Though revenues are down, the library continues to operate with the strong support of the Friends of the Library. The library financially operates autonomously and does not receive money from the township general operating fund. ithout passage of the library millage renewal, the library would not be able to sustain itself.\n\nI believe library and police services are vital to the quality of life in our community. In addition, these services have a direct correlation to the stability of property values. I encourage you to vote yes for the Library and Police Renewals as well as the Police millage increase.\n\nCurt Carson, treasurer\n\nCharter Township of Independence\n\n…community vitality\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI have lived in Clarkston for nearly my entire life, only a few blocks away from the library. From a teenager’s perspective, it has been one of the most invaluable resources I have ever had.\n\nI have spent hours and hours browsing the library’s books, discovering vital life lessons I have applied throughout my entire life. The library’s many children and teen reading programs introduced me to many lifelong friends, and provided me with a place to have fun.\n\nBut far from simply impressing upon a single child, the library has done more for our community as a whole than any other local facility. From its availability of resources for economically challenged youth in need of computers for homework, to its stacks and stacks of picture books for children just learning how to read, the library has become not only a building of books, but a thriving community center.\n\nThe Independence Township Library is one of the most vital parts of our community, consistently providing a place for people of all ages and backgrounds to read, explore, discover, and connect. I urge you to keep it alive and flourishing. Insure that the youth of today can create the same fond memories of the library that I, and many others, have been making their entire life.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMel Pavlik\n\nIndependence Township\n\n…resource value\n\nDear Editor,\n\nMy family lived in this community for more than 30 years. One of the main reasons why we love it is the Independence Township Library.\n\nThe library has something for everyone. It provides music, DVDs, books, books on tape, magazines, internet access, resource materials, teen to preschool activities. For instance, I have a monthly book club with over 20 members. Without the library book club program, we would not be able to provide books for all our members.\n\nIn these hard economic times, the library provides important services to our community that many can no longer afford.\n\nI urge our community to renew the Independence Township Library millage to keep a valuable resource alive that benefits all in our community.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBarb Rush\n\nIndependence Township\n\n…knowledge base\n\nDear Editor,\n\nIndependence Township Library has an excellent collection. Librarians are constantly reading and writing reviews of books published in the U.S. ? not only books, but also videos, DVDs, and all information formats.\n\nDid you know you have access to all the libraries in the U.S. via Interloan service?\n\nThe Library of Congress is at your fingertips with information published here and abroad with your request.\n\nIrene Rauth\n\nIndependence Township\n\nThe letter to the editor by Bob Gritzinger, vice president of the Lake Orion School Board “is a story about a $5 bottle of water.” This is NOT the issue.\n\nThe issue is how was taxpayers’ money spent under Tony Rothschild’s leadership as board president of Oakland Intermediated Schools?\n\nUnder Rothschild’s leadership, Oakland ISD had a special election, at a cost to the taxpayers of $300,000 for a special and vocational education millage on Sept. 25, 2001. With a little foresight, that election could have been held with the regular school election in June 2001.\n\nThat raises a few interesting questions. Did the Oakland ISD Board think the proposed millage would be defeated in a regular school election? Did the board decide to have a special election hoping fewer voters would turn out than in the regular school election and thereby having a better chance of passing?\n\nAlso under Rothschild’s leadership, the Oakland ISD Board approved the use of $18.9 million of “Special education” monies for a new building. This was the straw that broke the camel’s back.\n\nIt was bad enough to hold a special “stealth election” for a special and vocational millage, but to use special education monies to build a new office complex is a violation of the taxpayers’ trust.\n\nIf Oakland ISD needed a new office complex, then the board should have held a bond election for that purpose and let the taxpayers decide.\n\nHas Lake Orion’s School Board become paranoid? Gritzinger’s statement as to “this continuing attack…to put in charge of public schools those who ultimately want our schools to fail, making way for a private, profit-making system of education in America” is an indication the LO School Board doesn’t get it.!\n\nHoward Sherman\n\nThe 13th Amendment to the US Constitution was adopted in 1789. It forbid lawyers from holding public office. The 13th Amendment was ratified by 12 states, but the War of 1812 put this amendment on hold.\n\nSomehow this 13th amendment disappeared in 1845, never to be brought back to the US Senate or Congress again. This is what I learned in US History back in 1960 when I was in the eighth grade.\n\nNow when you look at the majority of your elected officials today, the majority of them are attorneys.\n\nNationally for example: Senator Joe Lieberman, Carl Levin; in Michigan: Governor Jennifer Grandholm; locally L. Brooks Patterson and county rep Eric Wilson.\n\nThe reason why our founding fathers wanted to adopt the 13th Amendment was so we could have a government run for the people by the people.\n\nIf you pay attention to what’s going on, you’ll notice all the forms of government (national, state, local) will try to pass rules and regulations without you the citizen being able to vote on whether or not you approve.\n\nThese politicians set up commissions and committees and what does it usually favor — the rich and special interest.\n\nWe citizens always end up paying out of our pockets for some representative or senator who is usually in some lobbyist’s back pocket — as well as our local politicians.\n\nIt seems the big time developers and companies like Wortman and Carlisle or Plante and Moran have more clout and say so about what goes on in Orion Township then the citizens do.\n\nBut what can you do when only 10 percent vote and hardly anyone goes to the Orion Township meetings to speak up.\n\nI maybe see a ray of hope. At the township’s budget meeting on Sept. 8, a group of high school students came in to watch the meeting.\n\nI had made a comment that you can’t spend what you don’t have and don’t rob Peter to pay Paul. These youngsters understood what I was getting at, especially when a member of the township board let it be known they didn’t agree or care for my comment.\n\nI believe there is hope for us yet. These boys and girls are a lot smarter and innovated than our present leadership wants us to believe.\n\nJames Delavan\n\nDear Editor,\n\nThe last Clarkston City Council meeting was filled to capacity and in my opinion was a hotbed of issues, only one of which was addressed by Gerald McNally in his letter (“Keep police to avoid merger,” June 23)\n\nI cannot believe no one at that meeting had a comment to make to the public.\n\nSo what can we do to make the public more vocal? I think I have given them adequate things to complain about, including my letters.\n\nMr. McNally makes some good points but I would expand on that to say that the only things Clarkston residents will be paying for is government, lawn mowing and snow removal.\n\nThose who live on Main Street, Clarkston Road, Waldon, parts of Washington and parts of Holcomb get snow removal done by the state and county, so their 13-20 mills in taxes is only for a government to mow the lawn.\n\nThe city is proposing a $35,127 increase in DPW related funding and $12,971 for the police department, which they want to get rid of, as well as:\n\n? 150 percent increase in funds for Building Maintenance Labor, a 31 percent increase in utility costs even as we spend a grant from the government to make the building more efficient;\n\n? 75 percent increase in DPW costs for Taste of Clarkston;\n\n? 204 percent increase in DTE costs for what will become the DPW building on 3 E. Church;\n\n? 100 percent increase in maintenance costs for DPW vehicles;\n\n? 368 percent increase in tree trimming that DPW has never been able to get done no matter how much money is provided; and\n\n? 63 percent increase in fuel costs for DPW vehicles.\n\nAll of this while they state we have an imminent deficit facing us that may not be eliminated even if we eliminate the police department.\n\nCory Johnston\n\nClarkston\n\nWork together to help children\n\nIn response to ‘Parents: Kids are future generation,? The Citizen, June 12, p. 6)\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI agree with Ms. Taylor that parents should ‘rise to the occasion and take action.?\n\nHowever, I do not believe that leaving our school district is the answer to problems.\n\nMy son, who has special needs, just finished first grade at Oakwood Elementary. Ms. Taylor removed her child from Brandon Schools after four months and several meetings with the school ‘team? which were ‘unsuccessful and very stressful…? I have had many meetings with my son’s team ? very likely many of the same team members Ms. Taylor is referring to, including Principal Kristy Spann. Are team meetings stressful? Absolutely. Being the parent advocate of a child with special needs guarantees that. But this team is open to listening to parents. There have been differences of opinion, and even angry words and a few tears. But there are also good feelings and progress. We all respect each other. My son has made incredible progress in many ways. I will continue working together with the team to achieve improvement in other areas. I have had many opportunities to witness how much the staff at Oakwood care about the students. Mrs. Spann works very hard to make the school a positive environment for everyone.\n\nIt is relatively easy to say something isn’t good enough and walk away. It is much more difficult to do the necessary work needed for improvement. But it is ultimately much more rewarding. Ms. Taylor is correct that kids are the future. I believe that blaming others achieves very little. We should all respectfully work together to help all of our children.\n\nChristine Boyle\n\nNo sheriff deputies in Groveland\n\n(In response to, Tight twp. budgets rekindle Groveland, Brandon, MSP issues, The Citizen, June 12 page 1)\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI have lived in Groveland Township almost 40 years. We do need police. As our supervisor has stated, the state owns a lot of our township. Camp Tamarack owns at least two square miles and pays no taxes. We have one-and-a-half paved roads and not enough people. What was the last one? Was it the library who wanted $150,000 or $180,000 from our 6,000 people? Good luck.\n\nSome years back, I came on a wreck on Grange Hall on the S-curve before I-75. The poor man was dead. A call was put out for any police so the body could be moved. High class sheriffs were of course in the doughnut shop in Ortonville. They joked about it. I was at the wreck at 6:40 a.m. and (Michigan) State Police were all in Detroit. They got to the wreck at about 11 a.m.\n\nThe point of all this; I do not want sheriffs in Groveland. Just don’t come into the township. Don’t pass through. Leave your cars in Brandon. Do not drive into Groveland. Not welcome.\n\nI hope that is plain enough.\n\nIf not, go study ‘Stay Out? in your library.\n\nCharles Rockwell\n\nGroveland Township\n\nSafety of students top priority\n\nDear Editor,\n\nThe recent death of a student in Detroit who was killed when the bus started moving occurred while the girl had her head out the window waving to friends. As the bus passed by a roadside tree the girl’s head struck the tree. (The Detroit News, May 21, 2010.)\n\nI immediately thought of our students on Brandon School District buses. Our bus drivers do not allow students to have their hands, arms or heads out the window-period! They care about the students and their safety.\n\nThey take their jobs and responsibilities seriously. A few years ago the vote was approved for the sports complex, football stadium with turf. Now there is talk of privatizing our bus service-wrong! The safety of our students should be first in priorities. Their safety shouldn’t be placed in the hands of people who have no connection to our students and their families and our community. Please, no privatization! Our kids are worth more than that!\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nGael Tryles\n\nGroveland Twp.\n\nChurch, high school soccer bad mix?\n\nDear Editor,\n\nChurch youth groups have a goal of promoting strong values, positive relationships and decisions, as well as good healthy fun and fellowship.\n\nSt. Anne Catholic Church, along with three other churches, decided that it would be fun to have a ‘Teen Soccer Night,? as a fellowship opportunity, since so many of our youth like to play.\n\nWe combined about nine youth from each church ranging from never-played to on-a team in skill. We had a mixture of guys and girls ranging from ninth ? 12th grade and counted off to form teams and mix up the churches to promote fun and fellowship. We had a wonderful time and the youth met others from churches in our vicariate. At one time we were playing 17 against 17, to include everyone and no one even knew the score! We had no coaches, no referees or anyone who actually knew how to run this night. It was only us youth ministers and some parents. We were very happy with the success of this brand new outing until someone read the church bulletin (Yes, they do that) and decided to report this to the athletic director. Now our girls who play on the team at school are being punished and missing out on their last three games of the season. I can’t tell you how bad I feel about this and never in a million years did I think this could happen in our nice little town. No other churches had this issue and are all appalled that something so innocent could end up so political.\n\nApparently once the athletic director was contacted, it is his obligation to pursue the question of whether we violated Michigan High School Athletic Association rules by letting youth on the school team have fun with their youth group friends.\n\nBrandon Athletic Director Wayne Thompson understood this was about fun and fellowship also, but because a spiteful parent called him, the MHSAA ended up ruling against these girls playing with their church friends. Does this sound like MHSAA is overstepping church to you? Let’s leave the innocent youth out of the problems of the adults and let them have some good healthy fun.\n\nSo, does this mean we aren’t allowed to throw a football around in our yard if the youth is playing on a school team?\n\nDoes this mean we can’t play basketball in the church parking lot if the youth is on the school team?\n\nWhen and where is the line drawn between good clean fun and violating MHSAA rules? I am beyond disappointed and disgusted, so again ‘When is fun and fellowship not allowed?\n\nKim Zernec, St. Anne Youth Minister\n\nReader says technology threatens lotto law\n\nDear Editor,\n\nMichigan Constitutional Proposal 04-1, which passed overwhelmingly in 2004 and is now in our state Constitution, requires voter approval of any form of gambling authorized by law after January 2004.\n\nYet the state lottery commission has now added “Draw Games Online” “Online Keno” and “Online Instant Games” so that gamblers can play the lottery games with their “electronic devices.”\n\nAlso, after 2004 “self service lottery machines” “online terminals” and “scratch-off ticket dispensers” were put into service by the state lottery commission in violation of the Michigan state constitution. None of these new forms of gambling were ever brought to voters for their approval as the states constitution has required since 2004 – https://www.michiganlottery.com/\n\nFrom the state’s own 2004 Prop 04-1 analysis report, “The proposal (Prop 04-1) would seriously hamper the operations of the state lottery, which provides a substantial amount of funding for the state’s K-12 educational system. It prevents the lottery from introducing new electronic games or table games, which it will need to do in order to remain competitive, without a popular vote.\n\n“To maintain player interest and maintain state revenue, the lottery regularly replaces older games or underperforming games with newer ones.\n\n“As technology advances, the lottery is likely look to alternative forms of games, including electronic and mechanical devices operated by the player, including self-service, online terminals and scratch-off ticket dispensers. This proposal threatens those efforts.\n\n“Note that the lottery would have to get legislative approval of any ballot language (it could not put a question on the ballot itself) and would not be allowed to spend money in support of proposals (even though the opposition could).\n\n“Not only does the proposed amendment require a statewide vote for the introduction of a new game, it would prevent a new game from being introduced into any given local unit of government without local voter consent.”\n\nWhy were new games added online, self service lottery machines installed, online terminals and scratch-off ticket dispensers added at Kroger, Meijer, etc. without voter approval? Please investigate this violation.\n\nRegards,\n\nMichael Powell\n\nIndependence Township\n\nCouncil careless with closed meetings, reader says\n\nDear Editor,\n\nGovernment transparency is very important, especially in small town government. There are cases where closed meetings are necessary and there are strict procedures that need to be followed when voting to go into closed meetings.\n\nThe Clarkston City Council held an illegal closed meeting last night, Monday, Feb. 22.\n\nMichigan law states a body must state the reason for the closed meeting prior to a roll call vote. Last night’s vote was proceeding without the council doing this, even though they regularly call for closed meetings. As the council prepared to go into a closed session, I reminded Attorney James Tamm, the lawyer who was present at the meeting and who is representing the city in at least two lawsuits, of the correct procedure, and he corrected council before the vote.\n\nCouncil then voted to go into closed session to discuss the ‘Bisio lawsuit.? As the audience members were leaving, Mr. Tamm jokingly turned to me and said, ‘You should have asked which Bisio lawsuit.? However, this lawyer, who is representing the city in more than one ‘Bisio lawsuit,? never corrected council, nor asked them to amend their vote.\n\n(Editor’s note: Richard Bisio and his wife Susan Bisio have both filed suit against the city. The Open Meetings Act allows closed meetings “to consult with its attorney regarding trial or settlement strategy in connection with specific pending litigation, but only if an open meeting would have a detrimental financial effect on the litigating or settlement position of the public body.?)\n\nIn one of the Bisio lawsuits, the city is being sued for holding an illegal closed meeting. Because of this lawsuit alone, the city council and lawyers should be very aware and sensitive to the reasons and procedures for calling a closed meeting. The reason for these rules to control closed meetings is to help ensure transparency in government. I am sure that the Clarkston City Council will enter closed session again. I hope before that occurs, the council members and their lawyers will read the law about open and closed meetings, and follow those laws.\n\nSteve Wylie\n\nClarkston\n\nReader suggests ‘salute? on election day\n\nDear Editor,\n\nSome 30 years ago, a Connecticut state police officer was following a school bus filled with junior high school students.\n\nA young man in the rear of the bus gave the middle finger salute to the state police officer. The officer immediately stopped the bus and made collar. He arrested the young man for making an obscene gesture in a public place. The case eventually got to the Connecticut Supreme Court and the court ruled, in dismissing the case, that the middle finger salute is not an obscene gesture but a gesture of anger or irritation.\n\nIf the Independence Township Board rules in favor of the 92 rental units at the north end of Deer Lake, they will be giving the citizens of Independence Township the middle finger salute. I suggest we return the favor by giving the board the salute on election day this fall.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGerald McNally\n\nIndependence Township\n\nConcerns, questions on road condition\n\nDear Editor,\n\nIt is amazing to me that within several years the new Sashabaw Road from Maybee to I-75 is falling apart.\n\nWhen is the road commission and our local government going to step up to the plate and demand this is fixed without taxpayers? money?\n\nWhy don’t the contractors have to be responsible for their work? The potholes along this section are disgusting. Now we will have to see orange barrels along Sashabaw while the road is repaired. When are we as taxpayers going to stand up and demand better workmanship? This is why the people are upset with our government representatives.\n\nWhy is it no one really cares?\n\nDoug Alexander\n\nIndependence Township\n\nA call to observe Black History Month\n\nDear Editor,\n\nGrowing up, I never had to assert my blackness. I attended a predominately black school until the eighth grade, all while being exposed to other cultures and ethnicities. The dance school I attended was mostly white, as well as the environments surrounding the extra curricular activities I pursued.\n\nRegardless of how I was treated, at the end of the day, I had my black friends, teachers and family to validate the treasure in my blackness. It wasn’t until college I became ‘the only chocolate chip? ninety percent of the time.\n\nSuddenly I was beginning to understand the disparity between African American culture versus the Anglo-American culture which comprised most of the student body at the university. I became frustrated with the lack of knowledge held by a few of my classmates regarding black people’s contributions to the United States. While I was able to maintain a positive image of myself, I realized this was a given strength.?\n\nIn the 1940s, psychologist Kenneth and Marmie Clark conducted doll experiments. These experiments included four identical dolls with color as the only variant. In an interview produced by Blackside Inc., Dr. Kenneth Clark explained the purpose of the study: ?…to communicate to our colleagues in psychology the influence of race and color and status on the self-esteem of children.? The children did not view themselves as valuable, and repeatedly chose the dolls of a lighter shade over the black doll.\n\nThis should explain why programs and organizations created by and for people of color are crucial. Black Girls Rock, the BET Awards, the NAACP and black student organizations across campuses nationwide are just a few examples of the ways black people have had to come together due to a lack of representation.\n\nWhen the history of your ethnicity has been characterized by dehumanization, these alliances are necessary for the amelioration of the black community.?\n\nI hold no animosity toward those who do not acknowledge black history, which does not begin at slavery, but it is undeniably important. So encourage your fellow brothers and sisters revel in the annual observance that is Black History Month.?\n\nRhea Reid\n\nUniversity of Illinois grad student from Clarkston\n\nWhat is in a name for the City of Clarkston\n\nDear Editor,\n\n“What’s in a name? that which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet”\n\nRomeo and Juliet, – William Shakespeare\n\nIt appears to be all but official that the City of the Village of Clarkston no longer exists and is now the City of Clarkston. No vote, no amending the Charter, no permission from the governor, but it is a fait accompli, a done deal.\n\nIt is on the Village Hall, on the city vehicles, on the stationary, on Facebook (City of Clarkston-from the city office) and on the city web site which, while named www.villageofclarkston.org, sends messages and reminders out as City of Clarkston. Pick the “Citizen Service Request” button on the city web site and you will be transported to the Form Center with “City of Clarkston” proudly on it.\n\nThe sign at the north and south end of Main Street doesn’t even bother with “City of” but simply says “Welcome to Clarkston” which is really a mailing address or a school district and does not start or stop at the beginning of what was once the Village of Clarkston.\n\nBut then, what’s in a name?\n\nCory Johnston\n\nClarkston\n\nMeals on Wheels a success with community help\n\nDear Editor,\n\nClarkston in Oakland County and five other counties in Southeast Michigan are fortunate to provide Meals on Wheels programs through grants from the Area Agency on Aging 1-B for individuals 60 and over who meet eligibility requirements.\n\nA hot meal is delivered at lunch time to homebound seniors. This program is a life saver for those individuals who receive it. We have volunteers at our center deliver around 30 meals a day our clients. To apply for this program you can call the Older Person’s Commission at 248-608-0264. Independence Township through the Senior Community Center supports this program seven days a week.\n\nWe had several local organizations and business who provided meals and special treats during the holidays when are center is closed. A special thank you to the following business who provided meals, Thanksgiving Day, Deer Lake Racquet Club; Christmas Day, Autumn Ridge Assisted Living; New Year’s Day, The Woodshop; and United Methodist Ladies Club for individual holiday treats.\n\nOur Meals on Wheels program is very important to us and the seniors who receive it. Without the wonderful support from our community we would not be able to provide the extra special service we provide. Thank you to all of our volunteers and everyone listed above for your support.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBarbara Rollin, senior division supervisor\n\nIndependence Township Parks, Recreation & Seniors\n\nThank you for school carnival community support\n\nDear Editor,\n\nOn Friday, Jan. 29, Independence Elementary held its 2nd Annual Winter Carnival and the night was a roaring success.

With your help, we collected 30 grocery carts of food, 2,668 items, to stock the shelves of Kids’ Kloset.\n\nThank you to everyone who volunteered and contributed to this important event. Your generosity allows Kid’s Kloset to help families of Oakland County through difficult times.\n\nKids’ Kloset, located at the corner of Pine Knob and Clarkston Roads, is a mission and outreach of the First Congregational Church. It focuses on helping families with children ages 0-7 years old. Families with older children are served as our resources allow. Families can come to Kids’ Kloset each month for one year to receive food, formula, clothing, diapers, and toys.\n\nThank you again, Clarkston, for helping us help others. We couldn’t do it without you! If you would like more information about Kids’ Kloset or FCC please find us on Facebook or @ fcclarkston.com.\n\nTraci Cooley\n\nFirst Congregational Church\n\nThanks for Retro pics\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI just wanted to thank you for the wonderful coverage of the Strolling Retro Party (“Downtown strolling at Retro Party,” Jan. 20).\n\nI really enjoyed all the photos and the Clarkston News getting the info out there about what the event was that we hosted. Not only did folks have fun but we were able to raise a good amount of funds to donate to Stiggy’s Dogs, which is such a worthwhile program for our veterans.\n\nThanks again for taking the time to attend and cover our fundraiser.\n\nPeg Roth\n\nClarkston\n\n‘Neighbors? group timeline for city hall\n\nDear Editor,\n\nWe are, once again, sending a letter to respond to the mayor’s letter. Unlike the mayor, we will tell you where you can find the facts yourself, which is always best. The mayor’s letter tells us we are going to be building something; the only question is how big it is. We hope you continue to direct your elected representatives to consider alternatives before committing you to a 15-20 year obligation for a building expansion paid for at the expense of other more pressing things, such as sidewalk repair.\n\nWe have taken our information from the city agenda packets, found at www.villageofclarkston.org. Contrary to the impression the mayor letter tries to make, the city council decided early on to spend tax dollars on expanding the city hall, gave only cursory consideration to less costly alternatives, and did not take seriously the concerns raised by over a hundred residents who submitted a petition to the council. The following chronology shows that.\n\nOn July 14, 2014, the city manager notified the city council the owners of 3 East Church intended to sell the building and stated the mayor wanted to appoint a facilities committee at this meeting. The city manager mentioned a letter from the owners? attorney, but it’s not in the packet. The facilities committee will either recommend buying 3 E. Church or building a new building. As you can see, from the beginning, they were only focusing on buying or building something. The building lease expired on Dec. 31, 2015.\n\nOn July 28, 2014, a four-member facilities committee was established and approve by the city council. It consisted of two city employees ? Carol Eberhardt, city manager, and Jason Miller, Department of Public Works supervisor ? both of whom would benefit from private offices or an expansion of the village hall. Tom Hunter, then a city council member, and Jim Brueck, a former city council member, were also appointed and approved.\n\nOn Aug. 26, 2014, the city manager met with James Renaud of JFR Architects, apparently chosen because he worked with the city in 2012, the last time the city considered an addition to city hall. There is no indication the job was competitively bid or a qualifications-based selection was done. The agenda packet contained a resolution stating a new facility was needed, Renaud’s services were required ‘to begin the process of building a new facility,? and the council was asked to authorize $2,936 to pay for these services. Renaud’s proposal included three options, all of which assumed a new building would be built.\n\nOn Sept. 22, 2014, the city council decided not to buy the building at 3 East Church ‘due to the price of the purchase and the cost of repairs,? but they don’t tell us what those costs are so we could assess for ourselves whether buying the building would cost more than building a new "
