        "text": "Photo of Ed taken by Mike Coeyman.\n\nEd Toth is an American musician who currently plays drums for The Doobie Brothers. Toth joined the Doobies in 2005 following his departure from Vertical Horizon.\n\nAlways interested in music, Toth says that he has been drumming most of his life. He made good use of his father's record collection and was active in all music programs in East Lyme, Connecticut, playing in his high school band at East Lyme High School. He went on to the University of Miami's Frost School of Music, where he received a Bachelor of Music degree in 1994. While still at school, Toth became a member of the funk/rock band Jennifer Culture.\n\nToth has played in numerous other rock and funk bands over the last decade. Most notably, he was a member of Vertical Horizon from 1996–2005. Toth's association with the group began when he was working at a Boston Borders Books; The mother of Vertical Horizon's lead singer and guitarist Matt Scannell, was shopping in the bookstore and asked Ed for a Vertical Horizon CD, which he had listened to and quite enjoyed. His enthusiasm for the recording impressed Scannell's mother so much that, in gratitude for the assistance she received at the store, she offered to put the bookstore manager and a friend on the guest list for a Vertical Horizon show at Mama Kin, an Aerosmith-owned nightclub, also in Boston. Toth went to the show as the manager's friend; and when the band had an opening for a drummer, Toth auditioned for the spot.\n\nWhen the Doobie Brothers' drummer, Keith Knudsen, died of cancer in 2005; Toth was selected to fill his spot with the band. He has remained as drummer for the band, first in addition to Michael Hossack. After Hossack's untimely passing, Tony Pia was added, and after Pia's departure, Ed became the sole drummer in the band, and later percussionist Marc Quiñones joined the band after the passing of Gregg Allman. Ed has been influenced by Stewart Copeland, Neil Peart, Bill Bruford and a host of other virtuoso drummers. Toth has also produced some critically acclaimed albums and started a band called Cooper with his friend, Tim Bradshaw.\n\nFANS is thrilled to bring you Mavis 80, A Newport Folk Revival presented by Anti Records on Friday, July 31!

(The other United Kingdom nations are following their own reopening guidelines; Northern Ireland will host Europe’s first socially distanced music festival next month.) To be sure, British government officials are encouraging citizens to “Enjoy Summer Safely” by patronizing their favorite establishments once again.\n\nIn May, shortly after drive-in concerts began to pick up steam in Europe, YouTuber Marc Rebillet unveiled America’s first drive-in tour. Country music mainstay Garth Brooks then rallied behind the idea of a socially distanced audience, offering a one-night-only concert at 300 drive-ins across North America. Additionally, Live Nation’s “Live from the Drive-In” series is set to kick off tomorrow, while Walmart plans to convert 160 of its parking lots into drive-in theaters (in partnership with Tribeca Enterprises) later this summer.\n\nNow, country stars Trace Adkins and Blake Shelton, as well as Shelton’s Grammy-winning partner, Gwen Stefani, are preparing to release a drive-in concert of their own. Under the “Drive-In Encore Nights” banner, the specially recorded performance will stream at drive-ins across the U.S. and Canada – not unlike Garth Brooks’s once-off drive-in special, which Encore Live also promoted.\n\nMusic News\n\nPearl Jam, the Eagles, Guns N’ Roses, and Green Day are among the bands who have received loans from the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program, Rolling Stone reports. - Article\n\nOwing to health concerns stemming from the novel coronavirus, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has canceled its 2020 live induction ceremony and opted instead to release a special about this year’s nominees. - Article\n\nAnita White has spent decades singing the blues as Lady A.
