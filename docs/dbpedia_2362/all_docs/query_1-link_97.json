        "text": "Goldson exit path to England 'emerges' with Birmingham City keen\n\nConnor Goldson is a transfer target for Birmingham City, according to a report.\n\nThe Scottish Sun claim former Celtic coach Chris Davies wants to take the Rangers defender south of the border for his English League One bid.\n\nThe new boss is desperate to add experience to his ranks and is eyeing up the stopper.\n\nGoldson is one of the top earners at Ibrox and still has a few years to run on his current deal.\n\nBut if the guarantee of first team football is off the table - the same publication state he could be tempted to part ways and call time on his career in Glasgow.\n\nRojas fee Celtic would need to pay 'emerges'\n\nCeltic-linked Andy Rojas would command a fee of around £800k, according to a report.\n\nFootball Scotland state that the Herediano starlet - who has interest across Europe plus in Mexico and the MLS - is valued at around $1million which equates to just under £800k.\n\nHe made history at the Copa America for Costa Rica in becoming the youngest ever cap for his country at the tournament.\n\nRojas can operate in multiple positions across the frontline as Brendan Rodgers looks to add to his champions this summer ahead of defending their title and a tilt at the Champions League.\n\nZaha could make England return\n\nWilfried Zaha could make a return to the EPL, according to a report.\n\nThe Mirror reports that Galatasaray are ready to offload the attacker for a 'nominal fee' due to his large £300k-a-week wages.\n\nA move would need the winger to accept a significant drop in salary.\n\nOne option could be his current employers paying him off, which would allow him to depart as a free agent.\n\nFormer club Crystal Palace are among those keen - as are rivals West Ham and Wolves - and a free transfer would make him more appealing.\n\nBut that route would see the Turkish giants needing to take a hit financially.\n\nJim Goodwin eyes 5 more for Dundee United\n\nJim Goodwin has named the Dundee United positions he wants to fill as he targets a further FIVE signings.\n\nThe Tangerines boss has already started his hard work in the transfer market with a number of signings already on board including Ryan Strain and a return for Jack Walton.\n\nSpeaking to DUTV, the United gaffer offered the fans an update on the recruitment front as they bid for a successful return to the top flight after getting themselves back in the Scottish Premiership at the first time of asking.\n\nDefinitely, yeah. We need more competition for places in the forward areas. We need another striker, definitely. We still need, I believe, another winger potentially on the right hand side. And we definitely need another couple of midfielders as well. We’ve still got four or five new players we need to add and myself and Michael (Cairney), our head of recruitment, are working tirelessly on that.\n\nBrum move for Leonard\n\nBirmingham City are set to step up their interest in Marc Leonard.\n\nThe Brighton midfielder has been a Blues target for several weeks. Birmingham had been working on other positions in recent days but now want to get a £300,000 deal for Leonard over the line.\n\nThe Scot has English Championship and European interest. New Birmingham boss Chris Davies wants a deal for Leonard to be sealed.\n\nLeonard was a standout when he was on loan at Northampton Town. Davies knows he could help get Birmingham back up at the first time of asking.\n\nGunners backed to sign Williams and Osimhen\n\nArsenal legend Emmanuel Petit has called on his old club to break the bank on duo Nico Williams and Victor Osimhen.\n\nAtletic Bilbao winger Williams has been one of the stars at the Euro 2024 final so far, while Nigerian striker Osimhen still managed to net 17 goals in 32 games for an otherwise dismal campaign for Napoli last season.\n\nFrance World Cup winner Petit reckons Williams would be a \"dream signing\" for Mikel Arteta and also believes Osimhen would be a real force in the Premier League.\n\nSpeaking as part of bet365’s Euro 2024 coverage, he said:\n\nArsenal’s dream signing this summer would be Nico Williams.\n\nI've been watching him in Spain with his club, but he has impressed me a lot during Euro 2024, especially against Italy. It was a nightmare for the right back.I think this guy could have a huge impact at Arsenal.\n\nPeople have also mentioned Benjamin Sesko, but I think Arsenal need to look at Victor Osimhen at Napoli, this guy has all the character he needs to thrive. He’s got great ambition and when I mention his character, he reminds me of players who were in the Premier League back in the day, huge characters.\n\nHe will work incredibly hard on the pitch and Arsenal are desperate to get a real striker. Osimhen can hold two central defenders easily. He can play on the ground, he can play in the air. It will be important as well on set pieces.\n\nHe would add quality to Mikel Arteta's team.\n\nGrealish would 'suit' Villa or Chelsea\n\nFormer England star Chris Waddle reckons Jack Grealish should leave Manchester City and believes his talents would be best suited at Chelsea or with a return to Aston Villa.\n\nSpeaking to Betway, he said:\n\nIf you're buying Grealish, are you buying him as a winger? Tottenham like pace, Jack is not blessed with pace. You'd have to play him in a number 10 role, and they already have James Maddison for that\n\nSo Spurs no, and I wouldn't say Arsenal either. Liverpool play a very high tempo game, so I'm not sure about there too. What you're looking at is, would you play Grealish as a winger or a number 10, or midfield player? If I was buying him I'd be looking to play him in the middle. He does a job on the wing, but wingers create, get round the back, and Jack can't get round the back.\n\nYeah, he doesn't give the ball away and doesn't take a lot of risks, gives the side balance. But I think I'd be looking at his old club Aston Villa, I'd be looking to play him in that three in the middle of the park. I'm not sure about Newcastle, they play a high tempo and press. I think he has to go to a side where they are looking to play him as a midfield player.\n\nChelsea could be an outside bet with Gallagher possibly going, you could see him playing that midfield role. He'd be more effective there. He's got vision, he can see things, he's good at give and go. But he's stuck on that wing, you're thinking there is surely more in his locker.\n\nSo if I was a top club looking for a winger, I'd be looking at players ahead of Grealish.\n\nTodd's Law for Barron\n\nConnor Barron hasn’t even kicked a ball for Rangers and already he has endured himself to the Ibrox support.\n\nTodd Cantwell hasn’t kicked a ball this season and already he has been involved in a spat with a fan online. Two Rangers players, two very different attitudes. In 24 hours the contrast was summed up - and it’s not hard to see which of the two the light blue legions prefer.\n\nGranted, Barron still has to show what he can do following his move from Scottish Premiership rivals Aberdeen - a bold move in itself given the rivalry between the two clubs. But that fearless approach is one reason Rangers fans are excited about what the future could for him in Govan. But it was another line from his press conference after he was unveiled to the media on Friday that stuck out for many fans.\n\nWhen talking about the backlash he might face having swapped his boyhood heroes and hometown team for one of their fierce rivals, he shrugged and simply said: “All I do is focus on my job on the pitch. I don’t go on social media or anything like that. That is not my job. My job is to go on the pitch and perform and let my football do the talking.” That was music to the ears of light blue legions on, ahem, social media.\n\nAnd then just the day after Barron’s words, Cantwell - a player who has already been given the mocking nickname TikTok Todd due to his online activity - was involved in a spat with a punter.\n\nNorwich City fans probably aren’t too surprised to see how it’s panning out for Cantwell who is being linked with an Ibrox exit this summer after 18 months. He came through the ranks at Carrow Road and went on to start in the Premier League but it started to head in a downward spiral."
