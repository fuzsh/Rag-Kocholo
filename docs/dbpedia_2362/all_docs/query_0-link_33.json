Every summer from elementary school to college, Tom worked in the Salinas lettuce fields.

There his baseball experience culminated in pitching for Harvard in the College World Series. After beginning his Wall Street career at Lehman Brothers, Tom joined Salomon Brothers where he became its youngest ever managing director. In 1986 Goldman Sachs hired Tom as a partner in Fixed Income where he was a co-head of Liquid Caital Markets. Lisa Endlich in her book “Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success”, described Tom as “a hard driving trader who would be widely emulated. A conte nder in the annual “Iron Man” Triathlon, he would bring to the department a new intensity and a risky style of trading that was bolder and more aggressive than anything Goldman Sachs fixed income had ever seen.” Since retiring from Goldman Sachs in 1993, Tom’s priority has been his family. Tom took great pride in his daughter, Jennifer, now a senior at Wellesley and his son, T.J., a nationally ranked junior tennis player. Tom recently produced “50,000 Balls,” a documentary on junior tennis which premiered in June at the Newport International Tennis Hall of Fame.
