        "text": "Sunrise and sunset in the United Kingdom\n\n(Times for London)\n\nThe United Kingdom is located in the north of Europe, over 5600 km from the equator. This high position in the northern hemisphere is also decisive for sunrise and sunset. At over 16 hours, the days are relatively long in midsummer, while they only last just over 7 hours at the winter solstice. The day then begins up to 4 hours later.\n\nDuring these days, the sun in London rises at 5:50. The sunset on the other hand is currently late at 20:18 in the evening.\n\nBack to overview: United Kingdom"
