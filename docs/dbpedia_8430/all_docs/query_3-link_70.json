        "text": "Think back to your childhood at the beach or playing in a sandbox and you likely wondered \"What if I kept digging through the entire world, where would I end up?\" I recall as a kid my dad telling me to point to where we are on a globe and to find the exact opposite location on the other side of the globe.\n\nFor some reason it's akin to a long-lost pen pal, many of us have wondered what or whom lives on the other side of this massive earth. With a nifty tool called the Antipodes Map you can now know exactly where you'd end up on the other side of the world.\n\nFor instance, what if I took a shovel and dug through the entire earth starting in my backyard here in Houston, TX? I would find myself under a whole lot of water, smack dab in the center of the Indian Ocean directly west of Australia.\n\nTo calculate where you'd end up Antipodes finds the point furthest from the seed point which you can adjust interactively. You simply click a point on the left map and you see a guy's head pop out on the exact opposite location on the other side of the world on the right-hand map.\n\nBy using the exact longitude and latitude of your seed point, the tool can accurately measure the farthest point on earth from that seed. This is a much more convenient way to determine what's on the opposite side of the world than digging through the earth. If you were to dig, you would face the impossible task of digging through: continental crust, mantle, outer core, inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust once again. All that to likely end up in the middle of an ocean somewhere.\n\nWhat if you did want to dig to the other side of the world? You'd probably want to take a look at the Kola Superdeep Borehole in Russia. This borehole was drilled as an attempt to drill as deep as possible in the earth's crust. The well, which began drilling in 1970 finished in 1989 at 40,230 feet and is the deepest man-made hole on in the world. Unfortunately, they were hardly able to skim the surface of earth's crust, let alone drill into the mantle. I'd suggest sticking with a more theoretical approach to digging through to the opposite side of the world.\n\nThe name Antipodes refers to two antipodal points that are situated on the exact opposite side of the world from one another.\n\nCurious to calculate your antipode by hand? First, figure out the latitude and longitude of your current location. Then, take the latitude and convert it to the opposite hemisphere. For instance, if you're located in New York City your latitude is 40.7128°N simply flip that to -40.7128°S. For longitude, you will have to subtract the longitude of your current location from 180°. In the case of New York City again, you would subtract 74.0059° W from 180°, leaving you with 105.9941°E.\n\nIf curious, below is a list of antipodal locations, both exact and approximate. This will give you a sense of what lies on the opposite side of the world from many cities that you've either visited or have heard of.\n\nYou can finally scratch that itch of knowing exactly what lies on the other side of the world. Were you surprised?"
