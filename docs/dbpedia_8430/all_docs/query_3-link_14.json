This map from Mapmania below will answer your question.\n\nNow, you know that Miami is on the same latitude as Egypt and that Missoula is on the same latitude as Switzerland. Looking at a Mercator projection, it can be quite difficult to guess these equivalences without packing up your road trip gear and heading out to see for yourself.\n\nFor more precision, Check out Beardsley Klamm‘s map where you can see North America with all major western European cities laid over at the correct latitude, as well as American cities laid over a map of Western Europe.\n\nIf you are interested in maps and geography, we have more content for you:\n\nThis map shows which beach is across the ocean from you.\n\nThis map shows how many European countries can fit into the continental US.\n\nMapped: Canada’s incredible population density.\n\nThis map shows how many pubs are in the UK.\n\nThe optimal itinerary for a US national park road trip, mapped."
