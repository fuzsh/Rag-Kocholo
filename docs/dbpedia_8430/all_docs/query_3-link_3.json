People from Phoenix today are known as Phoenicians. (Credit: reddit users twomancanoe and svaachkuet)\n\nMiami is at the same latitude as Saudi Arabia.\n\nHonolulu at the same latitude as the Sahara desert.\n\nLos Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix and Houston are all at the same latitude as North Africa.\n\nAnchorage is further south than Reykjavik.\n\nWinnipeg has been placed near Lviv, Ukraine and coincidentally has a large Ukraine population. Even the city’s flag has Ukraine colours. (credit: reddit user ajyablo)\n\nReykjavik’s average temperature in January is -0.6°C (31°F) and is warmer than Boston’s average January temperature of -1.7°C (29°F) despite Reykjavik being over 20 degrees further north (64°08′N vs 42°21′N).\n\nMissoula is placed roughly where Geneva is.\n\nThe map also shows just how wide America and Canada are compared to Europe, stretching the equivalent distance from Spain to the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe reason many European cities have milder climates than equivalent cities in North America at the same latitude is of course the Gulf Stream.\n\nCurious what the map for the Southern hemisphere might look like? Well Reddit user Yearlaren has created the following map of South American cities transposed with Australian and New Zealand ones:\n\nWant to learn more about the Gulf Stream and relative latitudes? Then have a look at the following books:\n\nThe Gulf Stream: Tiny Plankton, Giant Bluefin, and the Amazing Story of the Powerful River in the Atlantic\n\nA Portrait of the Gulf Stream: In Praise of Currents\n\nThe World Today: Concepts and Regions in Geography\n\nNotice anything else interesting about either map?
