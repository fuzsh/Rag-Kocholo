This makes London an excellent destination year-round!\n\nReady to learn all about London latitude and longitude, and how this impacts the weather in London? Lace up your shoes and let’s go!\n\nWhere is London? London latitude and longitude\n\nWhere is London?\n\nLondon is located in the Southeast of England, on the River Thames. It’s considered a part of the United Kingdom, which also includes Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nLondon is the capital of England, a country located in Western Europe. With a population of over 8 million, London is one of the largest cities in the world.\n\nThe neighboring countries of England are Wales and Scotland, which are located on the same island as England.\n\nWhat is the latitude of London?\n\nLondon’s latitude is 51°30′ N, which is 51.51 degrees North of the equator. This means London lies north of the Equator.\n\nSince London’s latitude is higher than the latitude of Paris France, it means that London is closer to the North Pole than Paris.\n\nWhat is the longitude of London?\n\nThe longitude of London England is 0°7′ W, which is 0.12 degrees West of the Prime Meridian. This means London is located further west than Paris, making it closer to North America than its European neighbor.\n\nWhat parallel is London England?\n\nLondon England is located in the Northern Hemisphere, so it lies on the 51st parallel north. This means that it is at 51 degrees north of the equator.\n\nLondon’s main airport, Heathrow Airport, lies on the same parallel as its city center – in this case, the 51st parallel.\n\nDoes latitude impact hours of daylight in London?\n\nAbsolutely, the latitude of a city significantly influences its daylight hours.\n\nAs you journey away from the equator towards the poles, the summer days extend, and the winter nights become longer.\n\nThis impact is quite apparent in London, located on the 51st parallel north in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nDuring the summer months, London enjoys longer daylight hours, perfect for extended sightseeing, and then in winter, the days are much shorter.\n\nYou’ll want to keep this in mind when making your travel plans. You can certainly fit in a lot more sightseeing in the summer in London!\n\nDoes longitude impact hours of daylight?\n\nNo, longitude does not impact the hours of daylight in a given location. The hours of daylight depends only on its latitude.\n\nLongitude is only used to pinpoint the coordinates of a city. It does not change the amount of daylight hours experienced in any given season.\n\nHow many hours of daylight are there in London in the summer?\n\nIn the summer, there are usually around 16-17 hours of daylight in London (based on ‘official’ sunrise and sunset times).\n\nThis varies slightly from day to day, but overall, you can expect plenty of daylight during the summer months in London.\n\nThe longest day is on the summer solstice, which is usually on the 20th or 21st of June.\n\nEven after the sun has set you will still see some light in the sky, so true darkness is quite a bit later. In northern cities, a summer day in Dublin or London feels like it goes on forever!\n\nThis makes it the perfect city for long summer days filled with sightseeing and exploring!\n\nHow many hours of daylight are there in London in the winter?\n\nIn the winter, there are usually around 8-9 hours of daylight in London. This varies from day to day, but overall you should expect much shorter hours of daylight during the winter months.\n\n(That’s only half of the hours of daylight in the summer! Those long winter evenings are great for enjoying a pint in a friendly pub or snuggling up with your special someone in front of a cozy fire.)\n\nThe shortest day is the winter solstice, which is typically on December 21 or 22.\n\nSo, if you’re visiting London in the winter, be sure to plan your sightseeing carefully to make the most of those precious daylight hours!\n\nDoes latitude affect climate?\n\nYes, latitude does affect climate. As you move away from the equator and closer to the poles, temperatures tend to be cooler in general.\n\nThis is why places located on higher latitudes like London and Dublin tend to have more temperate climates and experience four distinct seasons.\n\nConversely, places with lower latitudes (such as the latitude of Rome, the capital of Italy) will tend to experience more tropical climates. These locations will experience much less temperature variation throughout the year.\n\nWhile latitude is a large factor in a city’s climate, it is not the only one. Other variables affecting climate include elevation and proximity to large bodies of water.\n\nWhat is the climate in London?\n\nThe climate in London is classified as a temperate oceanic climate.\n\nLondon summers are generally warm, and its winters are cold. London experiences rainfall throughout the year, so be sure to carry along an umbrella on your trip to London!\n\nWhat is the daily temperature range in London?\n\nThe daily temperature range in London varies greatly depending on the season.\n\nIn the summer, temperatures typically range from 17-25°C (63-77°F). London doesn’t often get heat waves, but it can still be quite warm during summer months. Make sure your hotel has air conditioning and bring a bottle of water to stay hydrated.\n\nIn the winter, temperatures range from 4-12°C (39-54°F). London can have days where the temperature drops below 0°C (32°F) in its coldest months of January and February.\n\nIt’s important to bring appropriate clothing and layers for both summer and winter when visiting London. Temperatures can fluctuate more than the yearly average, so it’s a good idea to be prepared.\n\nYou won’t want to miss out on any sightseeing due to being unprepared for the weather! So plan ahead and enjoy exploring London in comfort and style.\n\nDoes it snow in London?\n\nYes, it does snow in London. On average, London gets around 15-25 days of snow each winter.\n\nSnow usually falls in small amounts and won’t last very long before melting away since London doesn’t get bitterly cold during the winter.\n\nWhat city is on the same latitude as London?\n\nThe Canadian city of Calgary has a latitude very close to that of London, with a latitude of 51.0447° N.\n\nIn Europe, the latitude of Bruges, Belgium has a latitude of 51.2092° N, and Cologne Germany is 50.9375° N, both of which are close to the London latitude of 51.5072° N.\n\nWhat US city is on the same latitude as London?\n\nAll of the continental United States is further south than London. The state of Alaska is of course much further north than London! Even Ketchikan, which is one of the more southern towns in Alaska, still has a latitude of 55.3422° N.\n\nAre Seattle and London on the same latitude?\n\nNo, Seattle and London are not on the same latitude. The latitude of Seattle Washington is 47.6061° N, which is significantly different than London’s latitude of 51.5072° N.\n\nEven though a summer day in Seattle is long, it doesn’t have as many hours of daylight as a day in London!\n\nLondon Latitude and Longitude Fun Facts\n\nLatitude and Longitude FAQ\n\nThere you have it!
