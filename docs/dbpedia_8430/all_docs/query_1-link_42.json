        "text": "London Grammar burst onto the UK music scene in 2013. They would go on to sell over two million copies of their debut album, If You Wait. And, in the process, Hannah Reid (vocals), Dan Rothman (guitars) and Dot Major (drums, electronics) collected an Ivor Novello, two AIM Awards, Brit Award nominations and the iTunes’ Album Of The Year honour.\n\nFrom a standing start–three students at Nottingham University get together, muck around writing and playing, discover they have an alchemical gift for melodic and sonic gold; play pub gig in Camden in December 2010; sign to Ministry Of Sound; record DIY album in Rothman’s family’s garage–London Grammar and their music took off at bewildering speed.\n\nThe trio’s intoxicating mix of soulful electronics, techno-folk and Reid’s stop-you-in-your-tracks vocals was bewitching on record, and stunning on stage–and beyond: the band often had a good foot on the dance floor.\n\nTheir sophomore album, The Truth Is A Beautiful Thing, was released in June 2017 and didn’t disappoint, it went straight into the UK charts at number 1. The group were once again nominated for a prestigious Brit Award. They spent most of 2017 and 2018 touring the world performing to sell out audiences night after night.\n\nForget all the success. London Grammar are still that band of friends in the garage, doing what comes naturally, and doing what they love."
