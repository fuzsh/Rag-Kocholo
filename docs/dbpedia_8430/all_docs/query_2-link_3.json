        "text": "England comprises most of the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, in addition to a number of small islands of which the largest is the Isle of Wight. England is bordered to the north by Scotland and to the west by Wales. It is closer to continental Europe than any other part of mainland Britain, divided from France only by a 33 km (21 mi) sea gap, the English Channel.[3] The 50 km (31 mi) Channel Tunnel,[4] near Folkestone, directly links England to mainland Europe. The English/French border is halfway along the tunnel.[5]\n\nMost of England consists of low hills and plains, with upland and mountainous terrain in the north and west. Uplands in the north include the Pennines, an upland chain dividing east and west, the Lake District, containing the highest mountains in the country, the Cheviot Hills across the Anglo-Scottish border, and the North York Moors near the North Sea. Uplands in the west include Dartmoor and Exmoor in the south west and the Shropshire Hills near Wales. The approximate dividing line between terrain types is often indicated by the Tees–Exe line. To the south of that line, there are larger areas of flatter land, including East Anglia and the Fens, although hilly areas include the Cotswolds, the Chilterns, and the North and South Downs.\n\nThe largest natural harbour in England is at Poole, on the south-central coast. Some regard it as the second largest harbour in the world, after Sydney, Australia, although this fact is disputed (see harbours for a list of other large natural harbours).\n\nEngland has a temperate climate, with plentiful rainfall all year round. It has a milder climate than many places at similar latitudes: for example Newfoundland in Canada, and Sakhalin in Russia. The seasons are quite variable in temperature; however temperatures rarely fall below −5 °C (23 °F) or rise above 30 °C (86 °F). The prevailing wind is from the south-west, frequently bringing mild and wet weather to England from the Atlantic Ocean. It is driest in the east and warmest in the south, which is closest to the European mainland. Snowfall can occur in winter and early spring, although it is not very common away from high ground. England has warmer maximum and minimum temperatures throughout the year than the other countries of the UK, though Wales has milder minima from November to February, and Northern Ireland has warmer maxima from December to February. England is also sunnier throughout the year, but unlike Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the sunniest month is July, totalling around 192.8 hours on average.\n\nThe highest temperature recorded in England is 40.3 °C (104.5 °F) on 19 July 2022 at Coningsby.[7] The lowest temperature recorded in England is −26.1 °C (−15.0 °F) on 10 January 1982 at Edgmond, Shropshire. The climate of south-west England is rather distinct and somewhat milder than the rest of England. Crops, flowers and plants can be grown earlier there than in the rest of England and the UK.\n\nEngland mainly lies within hardiness zone 8, but the Pennines and Cumbrian Mountains lie in the colder zone 7, and south west England, the Irish Sea coast, South coast and London lie in the warmer zone 9. A very small area, the Isles of Scilly, lies in the warmest zone in the British Isles, zone 10 which is close to subtropical.\n\nClimate data for England Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Mean daily maximum °C (°F) 6.6\n\n(43.9) 6.9\n\n(44.4) 9.3\n\n(48.7) 11.7\n\n(53.1) 15.4\n\n(59.7) 18.1\n\n(64.6) 20.6\n\n(69.1) 20.5\n\n(68.9) 17.5\n\n(63.5) 13.6\n\n(56.5) 9.5\n\n(49.1) 7.4\n\n(45.3) 13.1\n\n(55.6) Mean daily minimum °C (°F) 1.1\n\n(34.0) 1.0\n\n(33.8) 2.4\n\n(36.3) 3.6\n\n(38.5) 6.3\n\n(43.3) 9.1\n\n(48.4) 11.4\n\n(52.5) 11.2\n\n(52.2) 9.3\n\n(48.7) 6.6\n\n(43.9) 3.5\n\n(38.3) 2.0\n\n(35.6) 5.6\n\n(42.1) Average rainfall mm (inches) 84.2\n\n(3.31) 60.1\n\n(2.37) 66.5\n\n(2.62) 56.8\n\n(2.24) 55.9\n\n(2.20) 62.9\n\n(2.48) 54.1\n\n(2.13) 66.7\n\n(2.63) 73.3\n\n(2.89) 83.6\n\n(3.29) 83.5\n\n(3.29) 90.4\n\n(3.56) 838.0\n\n(32.99) Average rainy days 13.4 10.4 12.1 10.1 9.8 9.8 8.5 9.4 10.2 11.8 12.5 13.1 131.2 Mean monthly sunshine hours 50.5 67.7 102.5 145.2 189.9 179.4 192.8 184.1 135.0 101.3 65.2 43.9 1,457.4 Source: Met Office[6] (1971–2000 averages)\n\nSee also: Geology of England\n\nThe Geology of England is mainly sedimentary. The youngest rocks are in the south east, progressing in age in a north-westerly direction. The Tees–Exe line marks the division between younger, softer and low-lying rocks in the south east and older, harder, and generally a higher relief in the north-west. The geology of England is recognisable in the landscape of its counties, for instance Cumbria, Kent and Norfolk all have very distinct and very different looks from each other. The geology of Northern England and Western England tends to be somewhat closer to that of its near neighbours, Wales and Scotland, with the geology of Southern England and Eastern England being more aligned with that found across the North Sea and English Channel in Northern France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.\n\nGeological features\n\nCheddar Gorge – the largest gorge in Great Britain\n\nJurassic Coast – a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nSalisbury Plain\n\nTees–Exe line\n\nWhin Sill\n\nLondon Basin\n\nHampshire Basin\n\nLondon-Brabant Massif\n\nDartmoor – one of a series of moors in the South West of England developing tors on a granitic batholith\n\nLizard Complex – an ancient piece of oceanic crust, onshore (i.e. an Ophiolite).\n\nGeological resources\n\nCoal\n\nNorth Sea oil\n\nSand and Gravel\n\nChina Clay\n\nCopper and Tin\n\nStone\n\nNorth Sea gas\n\nPotash[8]\n\nand less abundantly,\n\nGeothermal energy\n\nOnshore oil\n\nLondon is, by far, the largest urban area in England and one of the largest and busiest cities in the world. Other cities, mainly in central and northern England, are of substantial size and influence. The list of England's largest cities or urban areas is open to debate because, although the normal meaning of city is \"a continuously built-up urban area\", this can be hard to define, particularly because administrative areas in England often do not correspond with the limits of urban development, and many towns and cities have, over the centuries, grown to form complex urban agglomerations.[9][10] For the official definition of a UK (and therefore English) city, see City status in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to the ONS urban area populations for continuous built-up areas, these are the 15 largest conurbations (population figures from the 2001 census):\n\nRank Urban area[11] Population\n\n(2001 Census) Localities\n\n[clarification needed] Major localities 1 Greater London Urban Area 8,278,251 67 Croydon, Barnet, Ealing, Bromley 2 West Midlands Urban Area 2,284,093 22 Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Dudley, Walsall 3 Greater Manchester Urban Area 2,240,230 57 Manchester, Salford, Bolton, Stockport, Oldham 4 West Yorkshire Urban Area 1,499,465 26 Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield, Wakefield 5 Tyneside 879,996 25 Newcastle upon Tyne, North Shields, South Shields, Gateshead, Jarrow 6 Liverpool Urban Area 816,216 8 Liverpool, St Helens, Bootle, Huyton-with-Roby 7 Nottingham Urban Area 666,358 15 Nottingham, Beeston and Stapleford, Carlton, Long Eaton 8 Sheffield Urban Area 640,720 7 Sheffield, Rotherham, Chapeltown, Mosborough/Highlane 9 Bristol Urban Area 551,066 7 Bristol, Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Stoke Gifford 10 Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton 461,181 10 Brighton, Worthing, Hove, Littlehampton, Shoreham, Lancing 11 Portsmouth Urban Area 442,252 7 Portsmouth, Gosport, Waterlooville, Fareham 12 Leicester Urban Area 441,213 12 Leicester, Wigston, Oadby, Birstall 13 Bournemouth Urban Area 383,713 5 Bournemouth, Poole, Christchurch, New Milton 14 Reading/Wokingham Urban Area 369,804 5 Reading, Bracknell, Wokingham, Crowthorne 15 Teesside 365,323 7 Middlesbrough, Stockton-on-Tees, Redcar, Billingham\n\nThe largest cities in England are as follows (in alphabetical order):\n\nThe extreme points of England are:\n\nLocation Mainland only Including islands\n\nNorthernmost point\n\nNorthernmost settlement\n\nSouthernmost point\n\nSouthernmost settlement\n\nWesternmost point\n\nWesternmost settlement\n\nEasternmost point\n\nEasternmost settlement\n\nMarshall Meadows Bay, Northumberland at\n\nMarshall Meadows, Northumberland at\n\nLizard Point, Cornwall at\n\nLizard, Cornwall at\n\nLand's End, Cornwall at\n\nSennen Cove, Cornwall at\n\nLowestoft Ness, Suffolk at\n\nLowestoft, Suffolk at\n\nMarshall Meadows Bay, Northumberland at\n\nMarshall Meadows, Northumberland at\n\nWestern Rocks, Isles of Scilly at\n\nSt Agnes, Isles of Scilly at\n\nCrim Rocks, Isles of Scilly at\n\nSt Agnes, Isles of Scilly at\n\nLowestoft Ness, Suffolk at\n\nLowestoft, Suffolk at\n\nEngland is generally lower and flatter than the rest of the UK, but has two main divisions in its form – the lowland areas of the south, east, and midlands and the more rugged and upland areas of the north and west. East Anglia is the lowest area of England, having no high hills or mountains and hosting an area of the Fens, the lowest area of England. The highest area of England is the North West, which contains England's highest hills and mountains, including its highest – Scafell Pike.\n\nIn England, a mountain is officially defined as land over 600 metres, so most fall in Northern England. Some hill and mountain chains in England are:\n\nLake District (Cumbrian Mountains) – the highest mountains in England, containing Scafell Pike.\n\nCheviot Hills – sometimes considered as an extension of either the Southern Uplands in Scotland or the Pennines.\n\nBorder Moors and Forests – uplands to the south of the Cheviot Hills.\n\nThe Pennines which characterise much of Northern England and are often dubbed \"the backbone of England\".\n\nThe Peak District – uplands forming the southern end of the Pennines in central and northern England.\n\nSouth Pennines - area of the southern Pennines between the Peak District, Forest of Bowland and Yorkshire Dales.\n\nForest of Bowland - a western spur of the Pennines in Lancashire.\n\nYorkshire Dales – an upland area of the northern Pennines.\n\nNorth Pennines - uplands forming the northern end of the Pennines.\n\nHowgill Fells - uplands in Cumbria between the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales.\n\nOrton Fells - uplands in Cumbria between the Lake District and Eden Valley.\n\nNorth York Moors – an area of hills and moorlands beside the North Sea.\n\nExmoor – uplands beside the Bristol Channel.\n\nDartmoor – an area of uplands in the heart of Devon.\n\nThe Cotswolds – a quintessentially and stereotypical English rural area.\n\nChilterns – a collection of low hills.\n\nSouth Downs – low hills close to the English Channel which form the white cliffs of the English South Coast.\n\nShropshire Hills – uplands near Wales.\n\nCities with the highest urban elevation include Sheffield, Bradford, Stoke-on-Trent and Birmingham. Low-lying cities near sea level include London, Liverpool, Norwich and York.\n\nThe main English islands by area and population are:\n\nRank Island Area (sq mi) Area (km2) 1 Isle of Wight 147.09 380.99 2 Isle of Sheppey 36.31 94.04 3 Hayling Island 10.36 26.84 4 Foulness Island 10.09 26.84 5 Portsea Island 9.36 24.25 6 Canvey Island 7.12 18.45 7 Mersea Island 6.96 18.04 8 Walney Island 5.01 12.99 9 Portland 4.44 11.5 10 Wallasea Island 4.11 10.65\n\nRank Island Population\n\n(2001 UK census) 1 Portsea Island 147,088 2 Isle of Wight 132,731 3 Isle of Sheppey 37,852 4 Canvey Island 37,473 5 Hayling Island 16,887 6 Portland 12,800 7 Walney Island 11,391 8 Mersea Island about 7,200 9 Barrow Island 2,606 10 St Mary's 1,668 11 Thorney Island 1,079 12 Foulness 212 13 Tresco 180 14 Lindisfarne 162 15 St Martins 142 16 Roa Island about 100 17 Bryher 92 18 St Agnes 73 19 Lundy about 35\n\nThe longest river in England is the River Severn which has its source in Wales, enters England at its confluence with the River Vyrnwy and flows into the Bristol Channel. The longest river entirely within England is the River Thames which flows through the English and British capital, London. The Vale of York and The Fens host many of England's larger rivers.\n\nEngland has 4,422 km (2,748 mi) of coastline,[13] much less than the deeply indented Scottish coastline. The English coastline varies a great deal by the seas and regions it borders. The North Sea coast of England is mainly flat and sandy with many dunes and is similar to coastlines across the sea in the Netherlands. The English North Sea coast is an important area of bird life and is a habitat for many shore and wading birds. Along the English Channel, the South Coast builds up into steep, white cliffs at Dover, which are often seen as an iconic symbol of England and Britain.\n\nThe South Coast continues to the Isle of Wight, but eventually gives way to the Jurassic Coast of Dorset, a coastline rich in beauty, history and fossils.\n\nIn Devon and Cornwall, the coastline becomes more rocky and steep, with numerous cliffs and tiny fishing villages along the coastline. This stretch of coastline stretches from Devon to Land's End in Cornwall, the westernmost part of mainland England. The coastline of Devon and Cornwall has similarities to that of Brittany in France directly opposite.\n\nFollowing the coastline northwards the coast remains much the same as in south Devon and Cornwall but is besides the Celtic Sea until it eventually reaches the Bristol Channel, an important shipping and docking area.\n\nThe English coastline re-emerges again in North West England. The coastline here is similar to the North Sea coast in that it is mainly flat and sandy, with the only notable cliffs along this stretch of coast being at St Bees Head in Cumbria. The English Irish Sea coast is an important area of estuaries and bird life, with Wirral being a peninsula bounded by two rivers, the River Dee and the River Mersey. Liverpool and Merseyside are areas of high population and important industry along this coast, with tourist resorts of Southport and Blackpool being further to the north. The English Irish Sea coast hosts two important geographic areas, Morecambe Bay, a large bay, and the Furness and Walney Island areas. Further north into Cumbria the Sellafield Nuclear Power Station lies along this coast. The English section of the Irish Sea coast ends at the border with Scotland in the Solway Firth.\n\nSeas bordering England are:\n\nNorth Sea\n\nEnglish Channel\n\nCeltic Sea\n\nBristol Channel\n\nIrish Sea\n\nAlthough the largest nation within the UK, England is relatively absent of large lakes, with many of its former wetlands being drained throughout the Middle Ages. Most of its largest lakes lie within the aptly named Lake District in Cumbria, Northern England.\n\nEngland's largest lakes Lake Area 1 Windermere 5.69 sq mi (14.7 km2) 2 Kielder Reservoir 3.86 sq mi (10.0 km2) 3 Ullswater 3.44 sq mi (8.9 km2) 4 Bassenthwaite Lake 2.06 sq mi (5.3 km2) 5 Derwent Water 2.06 sq mi (5.3 km2)\n\nThe total land area of England, excluding inland water, is 130,310 km2 (50,313 sq mi).[1] Crops and fallow land accounts for 30% of the land area, grasses and rough grazing 36%, other agricultural land 5%, forest and woodland 8%, and urban development 21%.[14]\n\nEngland has two land borders: a 96 km (60 mi) border with Scotland that follows the Cheviot Hills and a 257 km (160 mi) border with Wales that loosely follows the route of Offa's Dyke. To the west, the Irish Sea separates England from Ireland and the Isle of Man; to the east, the North Sea separates England from Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium and to the south, the English Channel separates England from France and the Channel Islands.\n\nMain article: Economy of England\n\nEngland boasts one of the largest economies in Europe and indeed the world, with an average GDP per capita of £22,907. England's economy is usually regarded as a mixed market economy, it has adopted many free market principles in contrast to the Rhine Capitalism of Europe, yet maintains an advanced social welfare infrastructure. The currency in England is the pound sterling, also known as the GBP. England prints its own banknotes which are also circulated in Wales. The economy of England is the largest part of the United Kingdom's economy.\n\nRegional differences:\n\nThe strength of the English economy varies from region to region. GDP, and GDP per capita is highest in London. Generally the Northern and Western areas of England are the poorest, with the Southern and Eastern areas being the richest. The following table shows the GDP (2004) per capita of England as a whole and each of the nine regions.\n\nRank Place GDP per capita\n\nin Euros England 26 904 1. London 44 401 2.

North East 22 886\n\nTwo of the 10 economically strongest areas in the European Union are in England. Inner London is number 1 with a €71 338 GDP per capita (303% above EU average);Berkshire, Buckinghamshire & Oxfordshire is number 7 with a €40 937 GDP per capita (174% above EU average).\n\nEngland, formerly a kingdom and independent country, united with Scotland to form what would eventually become the UK (Wales was treated as part of England at that time)."
