        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm curious to know if there is anywhere else in the world (on land) that has a similar latitude to the UK but has winters that are as mild as we get here on average. I think I remember reading that there are places, but find it hard to believe how anywhere can beat the UK in terms of winter mildness!\n\nPrincipally wondering about northern hemisphere but also southern.\n\n220m asl, edge of Brendon Hills\n\nI'm curious to know if there is anywhere else in the world (on land) that has a similar latitude to the UK but has winters that are as mild as we get here on average.\n\nOriginally Posted by: Brendon Hills Bandit\n\nYes, Ireland\n\nBut assuming you meant similar latitude to the British Isles on other continents, then there are a few extreme maritime locations that would have as or mild mild winters. Whilst Vancouver does count, Western Vancouver Island is even milder.\n\nInterestingly there is a portion of SE Vancouver Island near Victoria that claims to be the most Northerly example of a mediterranean climate owning to its very dry summers and wet winters. If you look at the climate chart on the Wikipedia article the monthly temperatures are almost identical to those in parts of Western England and Wales, and the cooler bits of the South Coast. Victoria is at 48N, about the same as Brest in Brittany.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia\n\nThe difference is the summer rainfall, averaging 14mm in July and around 20mm in June and August.\n\nThe temperature data for Victoria international airport for 1981-10 are actually strikingly to South East England, for every single month.\n\nVictoria's \"mediterranean\" status triggered an interesting debate on the Wikipedia forum which proves to me that the concept of the med climate has to be more than just a statistical thing, but takes in people's contextual associations with vegetation (olive trees, evergreen oaks, scrubby hillsides), culture and lifestyle (youths on scooters, short old people gossiping on village squares, celebs hanging out at pool parties in the Hollywood hills) as well.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AMediterranean_climate\n\nOff topic a little, a couple of years ago I looked into the Met Office site records to find the most \"mediterranean\" site in the UK. The closest I could get was Lymington on the South Coast, which has around 35mm average rain in July compared with 3 times that in November.\n\nBrockley, South East London 30m asl"
