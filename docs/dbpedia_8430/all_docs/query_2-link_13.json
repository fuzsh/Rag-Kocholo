        "text": "Transcript\n\nDR. LIPPINCOCK: Why is the prime meridian at Greenwich? Well, as you know, the Earth has two fixed points, the North Pole and the South Pole. And if you want to measure latitude, or north-south, what you need to do is just divide the space between those two poles. But there is no fixed position, east-west, or no fixed longitude. And very soon people realized that they did need a zero longitude from which to make all their measurements. So, in 1884, a commission of all the countries in the world got together and voted to make Greenwich the prime meridian of the world. And the reason they chose Britain was because it happened at that time that Britain was a great maritime power and controlled seventy-two percent of all the shipping. So, like with everything, it was an economic and a political decision at base.\n\nNARRATOR: Visitors to the Greenwich Observatory can experience a unique phenomenon: few can resist the chance to stand with one leg in the Eastern Hemisphere and the other in the Western."
