        "text": "How far is a degree of latitude and longitude?\n\nA degree of latitude, one degree north or south, is about the same distance anywhere, about 69 miles (111 kilometers). But a degree of longitude, one degree east or west, is a different distance at different points on the globe. At the equator, a degree of longitude is the same as a degree of latitude, about 69 miles (111 km). But it decreases as you move closer to the north or south pole.\n\nFill in your latitude to find out how long a degree of longitude is at that distance from the equator.\n\nLatitude: Â° north or south\n\nDistance ...\n\n(You can look up your latitude and longitude here.)\n\nBrought to you by"
