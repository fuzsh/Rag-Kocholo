The atlas of the maps below will provide the answers to your question.\n\nThe first map shows the territory of the United States compared to Europe at the same latitudes.\n\nOn the map, you can observe that Miami shares the same latitude as Egypt, San Diego aligns with Morocco, and if Detroit were in Europe, it would be located in southern Bulgaria. Similarly, New York City and Washington D.C. would find their counterparts in Turkey.\n\nThe map depicting the U.S. with Canada at the same latitudes as Europe is available here.\n\nHere are similar maps created by Beardsley Klamm comparing the latitude of North America with Europe, featuring latitude lines.\n\nBelow is the animated version of the map.\n\nLet’s try to overlay more European cities in North America.\n\nThe map below created by Reddit user havedal shows major cities in North America were replaced by major cities across the Atlantic ocean by latitude.\n\nNow it was the turn to overlay the American cities on the map of Europe.\n\nHere is the map of the capital cities of Europe replaced with the largest city in North America by latitude.\n\nNow let’s look at the latitudes at which the capitals of European countries are located and find cities in the world that are at the same latitude.\n\nHere is the map of European capitals renamed to city names on the same latitude.\n\nOn the map below, in black marked cities of the northern hemisphere, located at the same latitude as the capitals of European countries, in blue marked cities of the southern hemisphere.\n\nAs you can see from the maps, many American cities are located much farther south than European cities. Therefore, it is no less interesting to compare the geographic latitude of American cities with that of Australian cities.\n\nThis map shows North American and Australian cities overlaid at equivalent latitude."
