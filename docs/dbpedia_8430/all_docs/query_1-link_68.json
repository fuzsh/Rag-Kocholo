        "text": "UK venture capital has caught up with that of the US, at the early stage. But we should be even more ambitious, with a powerful cohort of thoroughbred companies emerging here. üá¨üáß As Saul Klein says: ‚ÄúWe have the potential to be the world‚Äôs best innovation economy. We need to double-down. If we are just interested in being as good as the US, you are basically saying we don‚Äôt want to lead the world.‚Äù Thanks to David Wighton for this thoughtful piece on the economic opportunity the UK‚Äôs innovation economy now offers to build national, regional and global champions. https://lnkd.in/eF4QAgqn\n\nPhoenix Court was buzzing this afternoon at the start of London Tech Week‚Ä¶where all the conversation was about national, regional and global champions of tech. üí° Our co‚ÄîCOO Catherine Lenson welcomed everyone to Somers Town in the heart of New Palo Alto and set the scene to introduce a new way of looking at tech companies right across EMEA. Welcome to the Age of Thoroughbreds, finally‚Ä¶ üêéOur co-founder Saul Klein set the scene describing how \"Thoroughbred\" companies are a powerful and growing cohort, with details from Dealroom.co's Yoram Wijngaarde. Here‚Äôs what you need to know: Thoroughbreds are tech companies with over $100M in annual revenues Colts are making revenues of $25M to $100M annual revenues And here‚Äôs the formula: hope + promise x fundamentals = champions Where the hope and promise of unicorns is combined with real revenues, from businesses making real products and services. The thoroughbreds in action: üìàM-KOPA President and MD Mayur Patel in conversation with former L&G CEO Nigel Wilson on how MKopa recently surpassed $300M in revenue and has over 4 million customers, while keeping economic inclusion at its core. üöóHSBC Innovation Banking UK‚Äôs CEO Erin Platts and Moove‚Äôs Chief Capital Strategy and Impact Officer Tingting Peng explored how Moove has scaled fast from a colt to a thoroughbred! Moove‚Äôs meteoric growth journey over the past few years, including launches in the UK, and UAE, shows great companies can come from anywhere, as well as how its innovative approach to improving access to credit for ride-hailing and platform drivers. üí≥ UK Thoroughbred Tide‚Äôs Chief Product Officer Vinay Ramani spoke to M&G Investments‚Äôs Head of Impact & Private Equity Alex Seddon on how Tide grabbed 10% market share of UK business banking through supporting micro SMEs. With $250M ARR and $3 billion in deposits, Tide is on a mission to reach $1B ARR through expanding globally. üî¨ And championing British UK tech and innovation, we closed with some stirring words from former Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance interviewed by Bloomberg‚Äôs Parmy Olson From healthcare to life sciences, AI and deep tech, Sir Patrick talked about his huge enthusiasm for UK science and technology, particularly noting how so many researchers and academics want to develop their research into startups. With greater support, infrastructure and capital we can help this new generation of entrepreneurs compete on the same level as their Palo Alto counterparts. #LTW24 #Thoroughbreds #NewPaloAlto\n\nOn Tuesday evening we brought together 40 of Europe‚Äôs most exciting People leaders, to share learnings and swap notes, over intimate fireside chats and delicious food and wine at our home, Phoenix Court. We were delighted to be joined by People leaders from both within our portfolio, from companies such as Motorway, Tide and Multiverse, and the wider ecosystem, with folk from the likes of Activision Blizzard, GoCardless and Checkout.com joining too. Huge thanks to our fireside chat guests, Alan Cairns, Fiona Mullan and Sian Keane for sharing your expert insights and helping to kick start the conversation, and a special shout out to The Up Group for their support in helping us to bring this community together. We‚Äôll be bringing CFOs together in April - if you or a colleague would like to join us, register your interest here: bit.ly/48A2DPd Ambi Mistry Catherine Lenson Charles Guillemet Suzanne Ashman Blair\n\nNew post: 4 investment themes we're excited about incl a mix of emerging opportunities and more established areas where we've already made several investments. Consumer-Grade Products for Business Workflows: These products digitize critical business workflows, including transactions such as ordering, spending, and payments. They come in various forms, including vertical software, B2B marketplaces, and finance platforms. These companies are driving the digital transformation of SMBs, and we continue to see immense opportunities, especially with the rise of LLMs. My next post will be about the different models we‚Äôve seen and what we‚Äôve learned about these companies. TravelPerk Melio Tide Motorway Qogita REKKI Libeo E-commerce 2.0: Shopify defined the first generation of online commerce. Companies like Algolia, Klavyio, and Mailchimp have built successful businesses around the e-commerce stack. With the emergence of foundational technologies like AI, Web3, new form factors (3D, spatial computing), and the shift towards a more holistic digital commerce experience, we‚Äôre excited about the evolving e-commerce stack, from back-end to front-end and new applications. We‚Äôre moving away from monolithic SaaS solutions towards architecture and products that enable greater customization and automation. Beyond commerce via a chat interface, I‚Äôm particularly interested in the opportunity to leverage LLMs to merge ‚Äúsearch+discovery‚Äù. Medusa, Meilisearch Next Decade AI Eating Services: AI is enabling workers to be more productive but also taking over analytical tasks. The growing reasoning capabilities of LLMs present an opportunity to offer services traditionally performed by freelancers or consultants, both at an integration/ingestion level‚Äîcapturing data from multiple sources‚Äîand at a reasoning level for generating insights and triggering actions. Services industries previously considered ‚Äúnot venture scale‚Äù are particularly appealing to us. Faculty Streetbees Feedier A new stack for the physical world: The most impactful products stem from layering technological breakthroughs. With its camera and GPS sensor on top of cloud infrastructure, the smartphone powered the last wave of innovation, catapulting our lives into the digital world. While AI represents the new software platform shift, we‚Äôre incredibly excited about its combination with new hardware that unlocks vast datasets about our physical world. There is a new stack to build for and on. There are numerous commercial applications to reinvent here: certification, localization, exploration, monitoring, etc. I‚Äôm particularly interested in potential applications around biodiversity to help our generation solve the climate equation. Since the start of the century, we‚Äôve mined our physical resources to build our digital lives. We now have the opportunity to leverage our digital age to rebuild and augment our physical world. If you‚Äôre working in these areas or have thoughts, please get in touch!"
