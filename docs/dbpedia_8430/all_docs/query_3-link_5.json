And Florida is at the latitude of the Sahara Desert.\n\nDude, the way sunlight works here in London makes it VERY OBVIOUS how far north we are ESPECIALLY WHEN IT’S TOO EARLY AND WE CAN’T GET BACK TO SLEEP BECAUSE OF THE STUPID SUNRISE.\n\nI mean, if houses in England had shutters (like you would expect of any civilised country) instead of friggin’ curtains, the sunrise wouldn’t be an issue.\n\nWe don’t have shutters in the US (actually in New England we do but most of them are fake and permanently nailed open) but blackout curtains are less than $30 a pair and they’ll change your life.\n\nYes, Northern Europe is very North indeed. It isn't just due to the Gulf Stream, it gets wilder the more you learn.\n\nThe Scottish cities of Inverness and Aberdeen are on or near the 57th parallel, farther north than... Fort McMurray. And the Northernmost Functioning Year-Round Human Settlement - Svalbard - has milder weather in many respects than common-or-garden Canada. (Like, obviously Svalbard is the end of the world and you can probably see Valhalla from there, but Winnipeg has competed in the coldness stakes against Mars.)"
