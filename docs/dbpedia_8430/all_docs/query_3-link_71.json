        "text": "Greenwich meridian, an imaginary line, last established in 1851, that was used to indicate 0° longitude. It passes through Greenwich, a borough of London, and terminates at the North and South poles. Because it indicated 0° longitude, it was also known as the prime meridian. It served as the internationally recognized prime meridian from 1884 to 1984, when it was superseded by the International Reference Meridian (IRM), which differs from it only slightly.\n\nAny imaginary line joining the North and South poles that is used to locate a position on Earth’s surface in an east-west direction is a longitudinal line, or meridian. By defining a meridian as a benchmark, and taking thousands of observations of the sky from the same meridian, astronomers were able to create an accurate map of the sky. The standardization of astronomical maps was in turn essential for maritime navigation. In the 17th and 18th centuries each country defined its own prime meridian, which typically ran through its capital city. For instance, France had a Paris meridian, and Prussia had a Berlin meridian.\n\nEngland established its own meridian, which passed through a point at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. The first such meridian—later named for John Flamsteed, the first astronomer royal—was established in 1676. Over the years, three new meridians were established at the observatory as newer instruments succeeded older ones there, each meridian being east of the previous one. In 1721 the second astronomer royal, Edmond Halley, established the second meridian, and in the mid-18th century his successor as astronomer royal, James Bradley, established the third.\n\nIn 1851 yet another astronomer royal, Sir George Biddell Airy, established the fourth meridian, 5.79 metres (19 feet) from Bradley’s meridian at Greenwich. This new meridian ran through an instrument of Airy’s own design later called the Airy Transit Circle, which was used to determine the positions of stars and other celestial objects by observing their transit (i.e., their crossing of the meridian) and their zenith distance (i.e., the angle between each object, the observer, and the point directly overhead). By noting on the Airy instrument’s clock the times of the observed transit of stars whose transit times were already well known, corrections could be made to that clock and others at the observatory and beyond.\n\nAs travel and communications expanded in the 19th century, the need arose to have a common worldwide standard of longitude. Consequently, in 1884 an international conference was held in Washington, D.C., at which the representatives of 22 of 25 countries voted in favour of designating “the meridian passing through the center of the transit instrument at the Observatory of Greenwich as the initial meridian for longitude.” Notably, France abstained from voting, and it continued to use the Paris meridian until 1911. Thus, in 1884 the Airy meridian was internationally recognized as both the official Greenwich meridian and the prime meridian, though the Bradley meridian continued to be used in Britain for mapping purposes.\n\nThe Royal Observatory, Greenwich, which is now part of a UNESCO World Heritage site, has a bronze strip in the pavement marking the historical prime meridian, but that line is no longer the true prime meridian. In 1984 new terrestrial coordinate systems were adopted on the basis of satellite data and other measurements, such as ones made using lunar laser ranging (LLR), very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), and connected-element radio interferometry. Since then data provided by the U.S.-maintained GPS (Global Positioning System) and other constellations of space-based radio-navigation satellites have helped refine the accuracy of global positioning and timing. The 0° meridian is now defined as an imaginary plane passing through the centre of Earth rather than through the local vertical centre of the Airy Transit Circle. Known as the International Reference Meridian (IRM), this new prime meridian was approved by all countries. It passes about 102.5 metres (about 336 feet), or 0°0′5.3″, east of the Airy meridian.\n\nThe historical Greenwich meridian passes not only through England but also through France and Spain in Europe; Algeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, and Ghana in Africa; and Antarctica at the South Pole. It intersects the Equator (0° latitude) in the Atlantic Ocean."
