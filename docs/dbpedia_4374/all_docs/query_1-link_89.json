        "text": "I rode the Virginia Capital Trail from Richmond, VA to Jamestown, VA over to Williamsburg, VA to stay the night and back to Richmond. I did it on my Trek Dual Sport + (E-bike) on the lowest assistance (1% assist). First I was really impressed I got over 60 miles on the charge with the extra battery so I made it both ways with an overnight charge.\n\nThe trail was nice with some rolling hills, nothing unbearable to climb. However the heat was bad. Yesterday the heat index was 110 degrees. I did have plenty of water and gatorade with me. On Monday the heat index, I think, was around 105 degrees. Majority of the trail is not shaded! And if you are looking for a bench to take a break, well most of the benches (not that there is a lot to choose from) are in the sun. There are places to stop along the way to replenish drinks but there is also about a 15 mile run where there really isn't any convenient place to get food or water. The cool thing with this ride is the American history and history markers along the route. There are many plantations along the way that you can stop. I didn't read most of the markers or stop at any plantations. Once I got to Jamestown I did stop at the visitors center for food and more water before heading to Williamsburg. I found out that part of the Colonial Parkway was closed which sucked since I had to take a little detour through Colonial Williamsburg in order to get to my hotel. This added about 3 extra miles in the heat.\n\nOn the way back it was brutal in the heat. On top of the heat I had 9 mph SW winds which meant I was riding into the wind. 9 mph isn't much but on a bike you feel it. It only took me 4 hours to ride from Richmond to Jamestown but 6 hours back. I did enjoy the ride to Jamestown from Richmond better than coming back but I think that was also because of the wind. I really loved the downhill as I got closer to Richmond.\n\nOverall I am really glad I did the trail but I don't need to do it again. There are many other trails I want to do; I am really glad I did this one at least once. I feel very accomplished. This was my longest ride I have done as an overnight trip."
