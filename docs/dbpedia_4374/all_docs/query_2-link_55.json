The recognition of the property’s significance is a key component to revitalizing the area as a gateway and anchor for the West Linn Waterfront Project and the Willamette Falls Heritage Area.\n\nThe listing will allow the City and its partner, the Willamette Falls and Landings Heritage Coalition (WFLHC), to apply for grants and funding for planned restoration work to Historic City Hall. The City and the WFLHC are moving forward with building renovations to create a cultural center operated by the WFLHC. Once renovated, Historic City Hall will have community meeting facilities, office spaces, and an interpretive center highlighting area history and displaying local artwork.\n\n“This is a tremendous achievement for our community and the Waterfront Area,” Mayor Walters stated, “I am excited for the momentum this brings to revitalizing the Historic City Hall Building and the surrounding area.”\n\nHistoric City Hall was unique in that it was conceived as a public-private partnership in 1936, housing government services and commercial businesses. Funded through the Public Works Administration relief program of the Great Depression, Historic City Hall served as a center of city life, housing the council chambers, city offices, library, police station, post office, and a grocery market that was the flagship store to what would later become the Thriftway grocery store chain throughout Oregon.\n\nProgress towards renovation of Historic City Hall as a destination cultural heritage and community center remains underway, thanks to our tribal partners, area landowners, Willamette Falls and Landings Heritage Coalition, Clackamas County, and funding from the 2018 General Obligation Bond passed by voters.\n\nInterested in learning more about the history of West Linn, Historic City Hall and the area?
