        "text": "Lynn Elwood Lichty, 89, was united with Jesus on Monday, July 22, 2024. He had been a resident of Antwerp and most recently Vancrest of Hicksville\n\nLynn was born on May 8, 1935 the son of Don and Maxine Lichty.\n\nFirst of all, friends described him as a gentleman, always dressed up, acting with kindness and love.\n\nAnd beneath the entertainer was a comedy writer. He was a comic book writer for \"sick\" magazine from 1968 to 1974. Lynn wrote a weekly comedy and mystery column for the Antwerp Bee Argus.\n\nLynn spun records for skaters at the roller rink west of Antwerp that his parents owned.\n\nHis parents wintered in Florida in the 1950s during his younger years. Although he did not graduate from Antwerp he was interested in the alumni. Sandy Temple took him to the alumni dance and he loved chatting with the alumni and Sandy only got one dance.\n\nAfter the skating rink closed he operated a pool hall in Woodburn. He was a master pool player and played in many tournaments.\n\nLynn loved music and was an accomplished guitar player and gave lessons. He loved to sing, and was often invited to join other groups to sing.\n\nLynn went to the Antwerp school elementary classes and read his poem. “Busbys Pool Hall.\" He won first prize on a poem contest for Sandy Temple‘s next book. The children were very much interested in Antwerp history.\n\nHe was an officer of the Otto Ehrhart Paulding county historical society. Lynn was also very interested in the depot. The last conversation he had with Sandy Temple was about what was happening to it.\n\nLynn has a great appetite as anyone could have witnessed and savored every morsel and took his time.\n\nLynn‘s family attended Bethel United Methodist Church at Forders Bridge and Lynn, the Presbyterian Church in Antwerp and liked to attend other churches for the fellowship.\n\nHe will be sadly missed by many friends.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Don and Maxine.\n\nHe will be laid to rest privately.\n\nFond memories may be shared at dooleyfuneralhome.com."
