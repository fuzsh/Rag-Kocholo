        "text": "Although house and property history is a popular way to connect with local history, this may be one of the most difficult areas to research. The records are often hard to locate, scattered in a variety of sources, and in many cases, non-existent. This is particularly the case with photographs. The following suggestions are not intended to be exhaustive, but can provide you with starting points for your research.\n\nIf you are looking for information on the current ownership of a property, see our section on Property Ownership Information.\n\nAvailable online\n\nBegin your search at Portland Maps, a service of the City of Portland. After searching for a property, you will be able to view not only current statistics about property, but also some historic information, including year of construction and often scanned permits under the \"Historic Permits\" section.\n\nCheck the State Historic Preservation Office's Oregon Historic Sites Database to see if the house or property you are investigating has been designated as historically significant. In addition, this site provides information about having a house or property added to the National Register of Historic Buildings in Oregon.\n\nAccess digitized Land Use Planning Decisions online from 1998 to the present through a searchable database. Please contact the Department of Land Use and Transportation directly with questions about their database.\n\nAvailable at the County\n\nMultnomah County Library\n\nHistoric Resource Inventory of Portland (1984)\n\nDigital Sanborn Maps\n\nView their House History Guide for details on other resources available at the library.\n\nMultnomah County Land Use Planning\n\nProperty zoning in unincorporated areas. Zoning information dates from the early 1950's for most areas and provides a history of land use for properties.\n\nCounty Surveyor. Survey information includes microfilm, paper and online records of surveys performed in Multnomah County dating from 1852 until the present. Types of records include field notes, indexes, maps, subdivisions and partition plats, and other records used to determine property boundaries and locations.\n\nRecorder's Office provides access to land records and property tax records. Please see the Division of Assessment, Recording, and Taxation website for details on how to access these records.\n\nSheriff's Office holds eviction records as part of the Civil Process Unit. Per compliance with Oregon Records Law, they only maintain eviction records from the past five years.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nIn incorporated areas, zoning is performed by cities, with online information available for Portland and Gresham.\n\nHistoric structure information is also available at the Oregon Historical Society. Their holdings include a copy of the Historic Resource Inventory of Portland (1984), block books, Portland city directories, Sanborn insurance maps, and historic photographs. See their Guide to House and Building History.\n\nLooking into the history of the neighborhood in which the house or property is located can provide additional context into the history of your house. The City of Portland Office of Neighborhood Involvement and the City of Portland Archives' Website Links (scroll to bottom of page) provide guidance on neighborhood research.\n\nAnother valuable and often forgotten resource is one's neighbors. Long-term neighbors may have stories about previous owners, or your home may be in photographs of the exterior of their own homes.\n\nKey Contacts\n\nMultnomah County Surveyor\n\n1600 SE 190th Ave\n\nPortland, OR 97233\n\n(between SE Stark and SE Division)\n\n(503) 988-3600\n\nMultnomah County Land Use Planning Division\n\n1600 SE 190th Ave\n\nPortland, OR 97233\n\n(between SE Stark and SE Division)\n\n(503) 988-3043\n\nCity of Gresham Planning Department\n\nCity Hall\n\n1333 N.W.
