        "text": "Drop-off Recycling Centers\n\nAvailability:\n\nIn Person\n\nThe County maintains 12 recycling centers throughout Henrico that allow residents to bring glass bottles and jars, metal cans and foil products, #1 or #2 plastic bottles, newspapers, and mixed paper. These centers are located at many of the County’s fire stations and other locations described below.\n\nView a map of locations of all the Drop-off Recycling Centers.\n\nCharles City Road Public Use Area, 2075 Charles City Rd.\n\nSpringfield Road Public Use Area, 10600 Ford’s Country Lane\n\nCultural Arts Center, 2880 Mountain Road\n\nShane Road Recycling Center, 1412 Shane Road\n\nShort Pump Park – 3329 Pump Road\n\nFire Station #1, 110 E. Azalea Avenue\n\nFire Station #2, 2400 Darbytown Road\n\nFire Station #4, 8112 Strath Road\n\nFire Station #7, 2701 E. Laburnum Avenue\n\nFire Station #11, 1754 Hungary Road\n\nFire Station #13, 12491 Church Road\n\nFire Station #14, 5210 Technology Boulevard\n\nDrop-Off Recycling Center Rules\n\nRecycle only newspaper, white paper, junk mail, cardboard, and beverage containers at these facilities.\n\nPlease collapse and flatten all cardboard boxes and place them in the containers so they do not clog up the container openings. This allows patrons room for their recycling.\n\nPlace all recyclables in the proper container.\n\nDo not leave anything (recyclables, refuse, etc.) on the ground. This causes blowing litter and is a problem for our neighbors.\n\nWe do not accept styrofoam, foam packing materials, or foam peanuts. Please place these packing materials in your household trash and dispose of them as you do your other refuse.\n\nThese facilities are for recycling only and not for disposal of trash. This hurts our recycling program and costs us all money. Please dispose of your refuse properly.\n\nTaking materials that are dropped off for recycling is a violation of the county code."
