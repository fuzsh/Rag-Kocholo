        "text": "PHILADELPHIA - FEMA is proposing updates to the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Charles City County, Virginia. Community partners are invited to participate in a 90-day appeal and comment period.\n\nThe updated maps were produced in coordination with local, state and FEMA officials. Significant community review of the maps has already taken place, but before the maps become final, community partners can identify any corrections or questions about the information provided and submit appeals or comments.\n\nThe 90-day appeal period will begin on or around Feb. 11, 2021. Residents, business owners and other community partners are encouraged to review the updated maps to learn about local flood risks and potential future flood insurance requirements. They may submit an appeal if they perceive that modeling or data used to create the map is technically or scientifically incorrect.\n\nAn appeal must include technical information, such as hydraulic or hydrologic data, to support the claim.\n\nAppeals cannot be based on the effects of proposed projects or projects started after the study is in progress.\n\nIf property owners see incorrect information that does not change the flood hazard information—such as a missing or misspelled road name in the Special Flood Hazard Area or an incorrect corporate boundary—they can submit a written comment.\n\nThe next step in the mapping process is the resolution of all comments and appeals. Once they are resolved, FEMA will notify communities of the effective date of the final maps.\n\nSubmit appeals and comments by contacting your local floodplain administrator: Rhonda L. Russell, Community Development Director/Assistant County Administrator, Charles City County, rrussell@co.charles-city.va.us, (804) 652-4707. The preliminary maps may be viewed online at the FEMA Flood Map Changes Viewer: http://msc.fema.gov/fmcv. Changes from the current maps may be viewed online at the Region 3 Changes Since Last FIRM Viewer: https://arcg.is/1bm4TK0.\n\nFor more information about the flood maps:\n\nUse a live chat service about flood maps at http://go.usa.gov/r6C (just click on the “Live Chat” icon).\n\nContact a FEMA Map Specialist by telephone; toll free, at 1-877-FEMA-MAP (1-877-336-2627) or by email at FEMA-FMIX@fema.dhs.gov.\n\nMost homeowner’s insurance policies do not cover flood. There are cost-saving options available for those newly mapped into a high-risk flood zone. Learn more about your flood insurance options by talking with your insurance agent and visiting https://www.floodsmart.gov.\n\nCharles City County Flood Mapping Milestones\n\nAug. 14, 2019 — Flood Risk Review Meeting to review draft flood hazard data.\n\nMay 29, 2020 — Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map released.\n\nJuly 13, 2020 — Community Coordination and Outreach Meeting to review Preliminary FIRM and discuss updates to local floodplain management ordinance and flood insurance.\n\nOn or Around Feb. 11, 2021 –Appeal Period starts.\n\nApril 2022* — New Flood Insurance Rate Map becomes effective and flood insurance requirements take effect. (*Timeline subject to change pending completion of the appeal review process.)\n\n###\n\nFor questions, please contact FEMA Region 3 Office of External Affairs at (215) 931-5597 or femar3newsdesk@fema.dhs.gov."
