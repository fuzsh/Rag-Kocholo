        "text": "Avondale, Blende, Salt Creek,St. CharlesMesaandVinelandChronology Researched and Prepared by Joanne West Dodds\n\nNote: Key events in United States, Colorado and Pueblo history are listed to help clarify events and do not have citations because of the nature of the information.\n\n13,000 B.C. to 1900 A.D.\n\nNative American occupation and trails included prehistoric cultures such as the early to late Folsom and people making parallel-flaked points, Archaic, Woodland, and Panhandle. Later tribes included Plains, Apache, Cheyenne, Ute, Arapaho, Comanche, Kiowa and Pawnee\n\n(Scott, 1975).\n\n1541-1779\n\nSpanish explorers whose routes passed through what is now Pueblo County included: Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, 1541; Don Juan de Archuleta, 1664; Governor Diego de Vargas, 1696; Don Juan de Ulibarri, 1706; Gov. Antonio de Valverde, 1719; Col. Don Pedro de Villasur, 1720; and Gov. Juan Bautista de Anza, 1779 (Scott, 1975).\n\n1787-1788\n\nSan Carlos de los Jupes was established as a settlement for the Comanche who had been defeated at the Battle of Cuerno Verde in 1779. Spain provided workmen, tools, farming implements, livestock and seed. It is believed to have been located just west of the confluence of the Arkansas and St. Charles River. The site was abandoned within the year following the death of a member of the tribe. The St. Charles River, known in Spanish as the Rio San Carlos, may have been named for the settlement. The tributary was also known as the Rio Don Carlos, presumably for Carlos Beaubien, the first American federal judge in New Mexico and grantee of the Maxwell Land Grant (Martinez, 2001; Taylor, 1966; Dodds, 1982; Pueblo County Historical Society [PCHS], 2000, Marker 50).\n\n1803\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase acquired territory for the United States, including the St. Charles Mesa, Vineland, Avondale and other lands south of the Arkansas River.\n\n1806\n\nWhile exploring the southern portion of the Louisiana Purchase for the United States government, Zebulon Pike encountered Pawnees on Nov. 22 on the south bank of the Arkansas River near the future sites of Avondale and Vineland (Hatton-Wolf, 2006).\n\n1815-1860\n\nFur trappers and traders traveled along most streams and trails in the area.\n\n1820s\n\nNumerous Native American tribes lived in the Colorado area. The Utes lived in the mountains, the Cheyenne and Arapaho resided on the plains from the Arkansas to the Platte rivers, and the Kiowa and Comanche lived south of the Arkansas River. The Pawnee hunted buffalo along the Republican River and the Sioux sometimes hunted in the outskirts of the Cheyenne and Arapaho lands.

It has been speculated that Gervacio Nolan used the Don Carlos River as one of his landmarks to honor Carlos Beaubien. This later became the St. Charles River. Source: Spanish/Mexican Land Grants. Colorado State Archives website.\n\n1846\n\nA community of Mormons wintered on the river bottom of the Arkansas near the future site of Blende. At one point the population reached 275. They arrived on Aug. 7, 1846, and left in May, 1847 (Dodds, 1982).\n\n1847\n\nThe Taos Revolt on Jan. 19, led to the death of Cornelio Vigil and Governor Charles Bent. Charles Bent’s daughters inherited his land, which led to some of the first settlements in the Arkansas Valley.\n\n1848\n\nUnder the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico ceded to the United States most of that part of Colorado not acquired by the Louisiana Purchase. The treaty included a provision which guaranteed the property rights of Mexican citizens.\n\nSource: Colorado State Archives Chronology.\n\n1850\n\nThe U.S. purchased all Texas claims of Colorado lands, establishing the present day boundaries of the state of Colorado.\n\nSource: Colorado State Archives Chronology.\n\n1853\n\nCeran St. Vrain sent Charles Autobees to establish a settlement on his land grant.\n\nBorn in St. Louis in 1812, Charles Autobees was described by contemporaries as a “fur trapper, frontiersman, military scout and settler.” He spoke French, Spanish, English and Native American languages. The settlement was established on Feb. 20, 1853, on the west bank of the Huerfano River two miles south of its junction with the Arkansas River.\n\nIn 1857, he brought his wife, Serafina Avila, and their younger children from Rio Colorado (Red River), New Mexico to live at the placita. His eldest son, Mariano (born in Taos on Oct. 15, 1837) and his wife, Elena Baca were already with him. By 1860, he had 120 acres under cultivation.\n\nThe United States Census for 1870 recorded the following members of the Charles Autobees household: Charles 59, Saraphine (Serafina) 62, Mariano 28, Joe 25, Thos 21, Ellen (Elena) 20, Catharin 8, Charles 4, Andrew 10 months, Consa Autobees 24, Juan Pablo 40 and Jose Leandor 13.\n\nAfter years of negotiation, Autobees received 686 acres of his original land claim. The settlement was recorded as Plat of Derivative Claim No. 1, Vigil and St. Vrain Grant in Colorado Awarded to Charles Autobees. The claim was confirmed by Congress and approved on Jun. 2, 1860, awarded by the Register and Receiver on Feb. 23, 1874, approved by the President on Mar. 2, 1877, and certified by the Colorado Surveyor Generals Office on Oct. 27, 1877.\n\nCharles Autobees died in 1882. His family members have continued to live in Pueblo County. Autobees descendants include the Ortiviz, Tobin, Jaquez, Sierra, Finn, Olguin, Baca and other families. (Taylor, 1963; PCHS, 2000, Marker 43 and 48; Bullen, 1939; US Census, 1870; Colorado State Archives)\n\n1854\n\nDuring a Christmas celebration, Ute Indians who had been allowed to enter Fort Pueblo, massacred most of the residents and abducted others on Dec. 25.\n\n1858\n\nGold was discovered at Cherry Creek near Denver, Colorado. This event led to the 1859 gold rush. Some found gold and prospered, while others took up ranching, farming and lumbering.\n\nSource: Colorado State Archives Chronology.\n\nWilliam Kroenig of New Mexico bought some of Autobees’ land in 1858 and began raising stock. In 1859, he was the first to send vegetables, meats and corn to Denver in commercial quantities. The Rocky Mountain News reported on Dec. 21, 1859, that Kroenig had delivered fresh pork, cornmeal, corn, potatoes, onions, cabbage, and turnips to the city (Steinel and Working, 1926; Malone, n.d., “Huerfano Valley’s White House”).\n\n1859-1864\n\nDoyle Settlement, also known as White House or Casa Blanca, was on the west bank of the Huerfano River. Virginian Joseph B. Doyle (1817-1864) came west as a teamster for Charles and William Bent after working as a clerk in St. Louis. In the early 1840s, he became an independent trader working in partnership with Alexander Barclay, Dick Wootton, George Simpson and William Kroenig. With the exception of Wootton, these partners were all related to Doyle through Teresita Sandoval. Teresita was the wife of Barclay and the mother-in-law of the other men. They built Fort Pueblo at the confluence of the Arkansas River and Fountain Creek in 1842. Following the massacre he lived at several sites in New Mexico.\n\nIn 1859, Doyle purchased two miles of the Huerfano River valley from Cornelio Vigil and Ceran St. Vrain’s Mexican land grant and established his family home. By June 1860, he had 30 acres under cultivation and the next year he sent corn and corn meal to Denver.\n\nIn 1861, Doyle built a flour mill which cost $9,000. He was a Huerfano County commissioner and served in the territorial legislature.\n\nIn 1862, Doyle designed an eastern style, two-story frame house which he painted white with green shutters. Casa Blanca (White House) soon became a landmark. One of the main trails from Pueblo to Trinidad passed through the ranch. Newspapers called Doyle’s Ranch the main outfitting station between the Missouri River and the Rocky Mountains for oxen, mules, wagons, corn and general merchandise. His wife was Cruz Suazo. A teacher named Oscar Goldrick was brought to the ranch to educate Doyle’s children.\n\nA little north of the main house Doyle built a Mexican style casita where his mother-in-law, Teresita Sandoval (now 50 years old) lived. Doyle also built a small chapel. He died at the age of 46 on Mar. 4, 1864. The Doyle settlement is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n(PCHS, 2000, Marker 51; Aschermann, 1982; National Register application).\n\n1859-60\n\nThe city of Pueblo was founded.\n\n1860\n\nCongress approved only 96,000 acres of the Vigil and St. Vrain grant in June. The decision was disputed but upheld by Congress in an act on Feb. 24, 1869.\n\nOn Apr. 25, 1860, The Rocky Mountain News reported that Kroenig had shipped over 20 wagonloads of vegetables to the Denver market. By June, Kroenig had 160 acres in cultivation, Charles Autobees had 120, J. B. Doyle had 30, E. Young had 40, and M. J. Patterson had 40. These crops were all along the Huerfano River. In contrast, the Greenhorn area had about 100 acres under cultivation.\n\n1861\n\nThe Territory of Colorado was established in 1861. Autobees Plaza was the county seat for Huerfano County and Pueblo was the county seat for Pueblo County (PCHS, 2000, Marker 48).\n\nJ. B. Doyle, I. B. Welton and Charles Autobees were elected as county commissioners for Huerfano County on Dec. 2. George Simpson was county clerk. Precinct one was located at Autobees’ ranch, precinct two was at Doyle’s ranch, precinct three was at St. Vrain’s ranch, precinct four was at Gray’s ranch, and precinct five was at Ft. Wise (Malone, n.d., “Huerfano Valley’s White House”).\n\nHaynes Ranch had postal service that lasted until 1863 (Bauer, Ozment and Willard, 1990).\n\n1862\n\nOn May 20, 1862, the Free Homestead Act was finally passed and signed by President Abraham Lincoln. The law took effect on Jan. 1, 1863.\n\nWilliam Craig was appointed as Power of Attorney for Ceran St. Vrain. He awarded quit claim deeds to Charles Autobees, the Bent Family heirs (Hicklin) and others.\n\nThe Huerfano post office was established on Feb. 25 with Joseph B. Doyle as postmaster (Malone, n.d., “Huerfano Valley’s White House”).\n\n1863\n\nBooneville had postal service until 1891 when it was renamed Boone. Located near the junction of the Arkansas and Huerfano rivers, Boone was named for the grandson of Daniel Boone (Bauer, Ozment and Willard, 1990).\n\n1864-1878\n\nHermosilla (Beautiful Place) was the name of William Craig’s Mexican land grant ranch along the Huerfano River. During the Civil War, Ceran St. Vrain and Craig developed a profitable working relationship. On June 16, 1860, St. Vrain conveyed to Craig a one-fourth interest in his land grant and on July 1, 1860, the land along the Huerfano was deeded to Craig. While serving as quartermaster at Fort Union., Craig received the power of attorney for the Las Animas grant from St. Vrain on Dec. 31, 1862. In Apr. 1864, Craig left the Army and moved his family to Hermosilla. Located on the new route from Denver to Fort Union, Hermosilla had postal service from 1870 to 1872. The ranch was famous for its hospitality. Craig’s two-story home of stone and adobe burned on the evening of Oct. 25, 1878. The first story of the house survived. The predominately adobe and stone house is in the National Register of Historic Places (Butler House National Register Application; Aschermann, 1982; Hayes, 1881; Simonich, 1984).\n\n1864\n\nThe Sand Creek massacre occurred on Nov. 29.\n\nMark Blunt established his cattle ranch near the junction of the St. Charles and Arkansas rivers near present day Vineland. His Jan. 8, 1867, water rights claim was one of the oldest in the Arkansas Valley. His Arkansas Irrigation Ditch, also known as the Arkansas Valley Ditch, ran almost 11 miles and cost $20,000. It was the first cooperative ditch in the Arkansas Valley (Malone, n.d., “Mark L. Blunt”).\n\n1865\n\nAfter the Civil War, Gen. Butler was U.S. Surveyor General for the Mexican land grants in this area. He traded with Spanish settlers for over a hundred thousand acres on the west and east sides of the Huerfano River (Malone, n.d., “Huerfano Valley’s White House”).\n\n1867\n\nSeraphine Garcia settled on Arkansas River bottom lands next to Mark Blunt and near what was to become Vineland (Malone, n.d., “Mark L. Blunt”).\n\n1867-1872\n\nFort Reynolds was constructed of adobe with civilian labor and first occupied July 3, 1867. It was named for Gen. John F. Reynolds, who was killed at Gettysburg in 1863. The troops were assigned to protect the residents against Native American hostilities which had increased after the Sand Creek massacre in 1864. The Fort Reynolds troops were never engaged in any skirmishes. Surrounded by 25 square miles of government land, the fort had 30 major buildings. Fort Reynolds had postal service from 1869 to 1870. The fort was abandoned July 15, 1872, and the land sold at public auction in May 1881.\n\nCaptain John J. Lambert, post quartermaster and commissary, purchased the Colorado Chieftain in 1870. His brother Nicholas Lambert managed it until John resigned his commission and started The Daily Pueblo Chieftain (Aschermann, 1982; PCHS, 2000, Marker 49; Bauer, Ozment and Willard, 1990; and Malone, n.d., “Fort Reynolds on Santa Fe Trail).\n\n1868\n\nThe Colorado legislature reduced Huerfano County to its modern irregular boundaries and increased Pueblo County’s eastern boundary to the Kansas border (University of Colorado Studies, 1906)\n\n1868-1869\n\nAndersonville post office was established in 1868 and closed in 1869. Joseph W. Anderson was the postmaster. The Anderson “way house” was a popular stopping place for many years. It was listed in Bancroft’s list of Pueblo County towns and settlements in 1888. It later became the property of Mr. Nicholson for whom a county road and nearby school were named (Aschermann, 1982; Bauer, Ozment and Willard, 1990).\n\n1869-1893\n\nJuniata, located on the west bank of the Huerfano River, had postal service from 1869 until 1893 (Aschermann, 1982; Bauer, Ozment and Willard, 1990).\n\n1870\n\nThe Colorado legislature established the Pueblo County boundaries as they are today (University of Colorado Studies, 1906).\n\nCeran St. Vrain died at his home in Mora on Oct. 28 (Broadhead, n.d.).\n\n1870s\n\nSalt Creek became a recognized Pueblo community along with the Grove and the lower Eastside.\n\n1872\n\nThe Denver and Rio Grande Railroad extended into Pueblo from Colorado Springs.\n\nGold was discovered at Rosita.\n\nThe Central Colorado Improvement Company completed arrangements for the purchase of the Nolan Land Grant which consisted of 48,695.48 acres on Mar. 30. A portion of the land was offered for sale as the South Pueblo Colony. Many of the same men who owned the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad owned the Central Colorado Improvement Company (Scamehorn, 1976).\n\n1876\n\nOn August 1st, Colorado was admitted to the Union as the 38th state.\n\nWhen Colorado became a state, its first general laws provided for elected county school superintendents. Parents could petition the county superintendent to establish a new school district with a minimum of ten school age children (ages 6-21). Schools were the first sign of a new community (Report on School District Organization, 2002).\n\n1877\n\nOn May 24, William Craig created a warranty deed covering 71,000 acres in favor of Benjamin F. Butler. This was in consideration for services in the passing of Craig’s Mexican land claim (Simonich, 1984).\n\n1878\n\nIn 1871, P. T. Barnum (of circus fame) and David W. Sherwood purchased two ranches, the Las Animas Altos and Corral de Torres, on the upper Huerfano River from George W. Schofield. Their ranches adjoined William Craig’s ranch. In 1878, they sold their ranches to the Colorado Cattle Company for $320,000. By 1881, it had 30,000 head of cattle. The company did not prosper. By 1883, it was in court for foreclosure proceedings (Simonich, 1984).\n\n1879\n\nUndercliffe (formerly Huerfano) had postal service until 1925 (Bauer, Ozement and Willard, 1990).\n\nStockholders ratified a plan to create the Colorado Coal and Iron Company from three companies: the Central Colorado Improvement Company, the Southern Colorado Coal and Iron Company and the Colorado Coal and Steel Works Company. General William Palmer was named president. The incorporation papers were filed in 1880. The business plan called for the new company to sell town and agricultural land, the production of coal and the manufacture of coke, and to build a plant to manufacture iron and steel products (Scamehorn, 1976).\n\nSilver was discovered at Silver Cliff.\n\n1880\n\nThe Salt Creek post office was established. It was discontinued in 1893. Eleven years later in 1904 it was reestablished and discontinued in 1908 (Malone, n.d., “St. Charles River Basin”).\n\n1882\n\nHuerfano had postal service until 1883. After a break in service, postal service continued from 1883-84 and again from 1900-29 (Bauer, Ozment and Willard, 1990).\n\nA log school, built by M. J. Patterson, was the first school in the area. 15 children attended the school (Ingo, n.d.).\n\n1883\n\nJesuit priests dedicated St. Patrick’s Church in Pueblo on Dec. 2. The priests served the St. Charles Mesa residents.\n\nSource: St. Joseph Parish, Pueblo, Colorado: The History, The People, The Traditions. In Celebration of St. Joseph’s Day, March 19, 2000. Pueblo, Colorado: self published, 2000.\n\nThe Colorado Cattle Company faced foreclosure proceeding and Benjamin F. Butler was appointed trustee by the courts. A public auction and sale of the entire ranch was held on Aug. 3, 1886. Butler purchased the mortgaged territory for $40,000. This included 81,003 acres. In this public sale, Pueblo attorney Allen J. Beaumont was appointed by the courts as special master. Later Butler formed the Union Land and Cattle Company. Over time it became known as the Butler Ranch.\n\nSource: Simonich, Edward J., “The Ben Butler Ranch” in Pueblo Lore, April 1984, vol. 10, no. 4.\n\n1884\n\nPueblo real estate developer J. Eire Greene purchased the Forest Park area of Fort Reynolds. He also purchased a part of the Frederica Mesa and acreage from Dr. Collier along the Arkansas River. He then had the combined acreage platted into town lots. Englishman Samuel Taylor, came to Colorado in 1890, and opened a general store in Greene’s development.\n\nSource: Daisy Robert Malone. “St. Charles River Basin Settlement History Goes Back to Civil War Days,” in Early History of Pueblo County.

As time passed, school district numbers were not good indicators for establishing when schools opened relative to other schools.\n\nSource: Colorado State Archives. Source: Colorado State Archives.\n\n1886\n\nAfter Pueblo, South Pueblo and Central Pueblo consolidated in 1886, there was a real estate boom throughout the county.\n\n1888\n\nThe Colorado Coal and Iron Company established an irrigation company to build a canal to transport water from the St. Charles Mesa to Avondale. The head gate was on the Arkansas River west of Pueblo, and the Ditch emptied into the Huerfano River near Avondale. As principal financial backer, the Colorado Coal and Iron Company received 7,400 water shares and a portion of the ditch enterprise. The company had 20,000 acres that could be cultivated.\n\nThe ditch construction started in 1889, and was completed in 1890. By 1891, the lands of the St. Charles Mesa, Vineland and Avondale had been surveyed and engineered. The ditch followed an irregular course along the foothills. At intervals, laterals emanated from the head gates to distribute water to the farmlands that sloped northward toward the Arkansas River. Roads were laid out so each 640 acre area was bordered. Later, many intervening access roads were created. Each block was to be ½ mile long and ¼ mile wide or 80 acres.\n\nLand was sold to individual farmers at $100 to $200 an acre. Included with each acre of land was one share of interest in the water rights at a cost of $10 a share. One share was supposed to provide enough water to irrigate one acre of land in an average year.\n\nThe land was sold in plots of five to forty acres. Since most of the buyers were workers in the steel mills and smelters and had limited funds, they wanted small tracts they could work during their off-job hours. Investors in larger acreages bought sites in Vineland and Avondale.\n\nIn 1894, the company was reorganized as the Bessemer Irrigating Ditch Co.\n\nSource: Bessemer Ditch Near Pueblo, Colorado.

They had purchased a new zinc smelting process that had been developed in Belgium. Historically, zinc was more difficult to smelt than many other metals because of its low boiling point. At the temperatures used for smelting other metals, zinc became a gas that escaped from a furnace with the flue gas. The new process prevented this. Zinc blende, known as sphalerite by geologists, was the ore used at the Blende smelter.\n\nApproximately 500 acres were purchased along the Arkansas River in 1902. By April 1903, the new 16,000 square foot plant was almost completed. The Denver & Rio Grande Railroad line to the smelter opened in 1905. A two-story brick hotel provided housing for 50+ workers. There were cottages for the two foremen and a two-story house for the superintendent. By 1905, the plant employed 1,500 men. Housing for employees was a problem and the company provided bus service from downtown Pueblo.\n\n1902\n\nSalt Creek’s population was about 250. The community was located mostly along the road to Riverview (Roselawn) Cemetery. The men were employed as laborers, smelter men, steel workers and wood haulers. Most of the children attended Edison School in Bessemer and had a teacher who spoke both Spanish and English.\n\nSource: “Descendants of the Conquerors, Pizarro and Cortez,” Pueblo Chieftain, Wednesday, Jan. 1, 1902.\n\n1903\n\nThe Blende Subdivision plat was filed Apr. 7.

There were several hundred residents by 1908. During World War I zinc production was at its peak. The population soared from 500 to 1,200. The company closed in 1923 after the flood of 1921 destroyed much of the plant.\n\nSources: Tom McAvoy, “Blende: Source of Fruit, Fun for Puebloans” The Star-Journal, Sept. 15, 1971, Eleanor Fry, Smelters of Pueblo.

The first major goal of the credit union was to assist the squatters in Salt Creek, Smelter Hill and Pepper Sauce Bottoms to obtain title to their homes. The Salt Creek land was platted as the Fulton Heights Subdivision on Apr. 17, 1910 and a second filing was on Apr. 24, 1917. The land was owned by Colorado Supreme Court Justice William S. Jackson II. The credit union induced him to sell the property so that it could be sold to the occupants. Included in the subdivision was the Sagrada Familia (Holy Family) Catholic Church. The property probably came into the family in the 1870s when William S. Jackson, the owner’s father, was vice president of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad, an investor in the Colorado Coal and Iron Company and partner with William Palmer in numerous real estate transactions.\n\nThe rest of Salt Creek had been platted as the Stanton and Vroman Subdivision (Apr. 19, 1941), the Celestino Martino Subdivision (Apr. 19, 1941) and the Victoria Heights Subdivision (Mar. 3, 1911).\n\nConstruction of the Pueblo Ordnance Depot began in Feb., 1942, with the first carload of ammunition received in August.
