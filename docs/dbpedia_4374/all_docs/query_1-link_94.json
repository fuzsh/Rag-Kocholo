        "text": "Northampton County is the southern 35 miles of a 70 mile long stretch of the Delmarva Peninsula known as Virginia's Eastern Shore. \"The Shore\" as it is affectionately named, is cradled by the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay or what is known locally as Bayside and Seaside. The Seaside, in particular, contains the largest island wilderness chain on the U.S. Eastern Seaboard.\n\nThe Shore is a place that has somehow managed to remain relatively unchanged through the times. Its pristine condition is mainly a result of the surrounding waters of the Chesapeake Bay and the County's isolation to large East Coast metropolises. Generations of families have created a rich tradition of living off the land through farming and fishing.\n\nNorthampton County contains numerous natural and cultural sites, including two large public parks, Eastern Shore of Virginia National Wildlife Refuge and Kiptopeke State Park, located at the southern end of the county. Historic towns contain buildings that speak to over 350 years of architectural design in the United States."
