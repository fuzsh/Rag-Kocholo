        "text": "IMLA established this award to honor the memory of James H. Epps, III by recognizing local government attorneys who have distinguished themselves by years of service to the same community. Jim Epps served his hometown of Johnson City, Tennessee for over 40 years as its attorney. He also served IMLA in many capacities, including as its President. He was a consummate gentleman and was respected for his kindness as well as his legal skill. This award seeks to recognize those local government lawyers who have been able to persevere through changes in government over a period of at least 30 years. This award is a milestone award that recognizes the significant achievement of having the political and legal skills necessary to represent the same community for at least 30 years.\n\nThis award is established to honor the memory of Marvin J. Glink by recognizing a private practice practitioner who exhibits those qualities that made Marvin one of the truly remarkable lawyers working in the private sector on behalf of public clients. Marvin Glink was a founding member of the law firm Ancel, Glink, Diamond, Bush, DiCianni & Krafthefer, P.C. in Chicago, Illinois. He practiced municipal law for more than 50 years, serving as the general counsel and special counsel to many municipalities and local governments in Illinois, including the Villages of Skokie, Maywood and Bridgeview, the City of Naperville, and school districts, fire protection districts, and other Illinois specialty governments. In addition to the traditional qualities of excellence in the practice of law, the award seeks to recognize a private law practitioner who has provided outstanding service to the public and who possesses an exemplary reputation in the legal community, the highest of ethical standards, and who revels in maintaining a life that balances a passion for professional excellence with the joy of family and friends. In addition, the award seeks to recognize a person who exhibits qualities of openness and humility, coupled with a sincere concern for the interests of others, including the professional development of newer practitioners. The award is authorized by Article VI, Section 6 of the IMLA Bylaws.\n\nThis award is established to honor the memory of Daniel J. Curtin, Jr. by recognizing a new practitioner who exhibits those qualities that made Dan one of the truly remarkable lawyers working on behalf of public clients. In addition to the traditional qualities of excellence in the practice of law, the award seeks to recognize a public law practitioner who has provided outstanding service to the public and who possesses an exemplary reputation in the legal community, the highest of ethical standards and who revels in maintaining a life that balances a passion for professional excellence and the joy of family and friends. In addition, the award seeks to recognize a person who exhibits qualities of openness and humility coupled with a sincere concern for the interests of others, including the professional development of newer practitioners. The award is authorized by Article VI, Section 6 of the IMLA Bylaws.\n\nThis award is established to honor a local government attorney for significant and surpassing achievements in the field of local government law occurring or culminating in the previous year.\n\nIn the past, this award was known as the Joseph I. Mulligan Distinguished Service Award. The additions of Benjamin Brown and Susan Rocha, however, both reflect IMLA’s rich and diverse history as well as its continued recognition and celebration of local government attorneys who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to further the practice of municipal law.\n\nLike Mulligan, Benjamin Brown and Susan Rocha each brought honor to the practice of local government law and exemplified the traits the award seeks to recognize.\n\nThe award’s original namesake, Joseph Mulligan, was a former IMLA president and committed public servant, serving as the City of Boston’s Corporate Counsel and Licensing Commissioner.\n\nBenjamin Brown served as Baltimore’s City Solicitor, as well as an Associate District Court Judge and a Deputy State Attorney for Baltimore City.\n\nSusan Rocha began her legal career as an assistant city attorney for the City of San Antonio. She also created the Texas Attorney General’s first Office of Municipal Affairs and went on to become a partner with Denton, Navarro, Rocha & Bernal, where she served as the City Attorney for the Cities of Buda, Cibolo, Roma, and San Felipe, in addition to serving as general counsel for a variety of other public entities.\n\nIMLA established this award to honor the memory of William I. Thornton, Jr. by recognizing a person dedicated to IMLA and to the practice of local government law and who has participated as a member of the IMLA faculty in helping local government attorneys learn about or reaffirm their knowledge of issues important to their practice of local government law. In addition to the traditional qualities of excellence in the practice of law, the award seeks to recognize a practitioner who has provided outstanding service to the public and who possesses an exemplary reputation in the legal community, the highest of ethical standards and who is devoted to mentoring young lawyers and educating lawyers in local government law."
