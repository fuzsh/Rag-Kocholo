Stands of pine and hardwood trees greet visitors at every entrance to the County. The predominant land use, forestry, is only occasionally disturbed by scattered agricultural, residential and commercial activities. Stately plantations and othez'- historic sites remind visitor and resident alike of the long history of the County. There is another side to the County however. Each day many residents leave to work and spend money in surrounding communities. Scattered development patterns limit the possibilities for public water and public sewer service. There is no central focal point for residents and visitors alike to associate with Charles City County. Instead, it is remembered as a-se-r-i-es-of i:solated points of interest. In order to address these and other issues, Charles City County in cooperation with the Richmond Regional Planning District Commission has prepared this Comprehensive Land Use Plan. Purpose of the Land Use Plan As we move into the 21st Century, change is taking place in and around the County. That change will bring both opportunities and problems. Institutions and individuals that anticipate and plan for the future will fare better than those who merely react. The purpose of this Comprehensive Land Use Plan is to serve as a framework for decisions concerning land development. The Plan contains a series of goals, objectives, and strategies describing how and where the County wants to grow. The adopted plan will allow public and private land owners to coordinate decision within a shared concept of the future. The future is never certain, however. As conditions in the county change, the Plan will need to be modified. State law ,requires that the plan be reviewed and updated every five years. Scope of the Plan Three terms can be used to describe the scope of this comprehensive Land Use Plan: general, long-range and comprehensive. The Plan is general in that is summarizes the County's policies for future development without indicating how specified parcels of land should develop, and without indicating detailed regulations for controlling future development. These details are left to more specific ordinances and regulation designed to implement the Plan, such as zoning and subdivision controls, capital improvement plans and so forth. The Plan is long-range in that it deals with anticipated development over the next 20 years. Looking that far into the future is difficult, especially in a rural county located adjacent to rapidly growing urban areas. A long-range view is necessaryf however, if the County is to attempt to guide development toward appropriate locations and protect historical and environmentally sensitive lands. Finally, the Plan is comprehensive in that it encompasses the entire geographic area of the County and all types of land use. Publicly and privately owned land is included. The Plan examines the natural and man-made environment. Recommendations are included that cover residential, commercial, industrial and publicly owned land. How the Plan is Organized The Charles City County Comprehensive Land Use Plan is organized into three major sections. Section I summarizes the important issues that have influenced past land use trends and will influence development in the future. These include: population and economic base, environment, land use, transportation, and community services and facilities. Section II is the part of the Plan that looks ahead to the future. This section sets forth future development goals. Also included are a series of objections and strategies that can be used to reach these goals. A future land use map is presented as a means to visualize how the County could develop if these objectives and strategies are followed. Finally, Section III outlines a series of tools and action the County can use to implement the objectives and strategies contained in Section II. HISTORICAL AND ARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES It is generally believed that the beginning of Charles City County as a colony came shortly after the English landed in Jamestown in May 1607. on a exploration of the James River, Captain John Smith and a body of twenty-one men landed and spent the first night about eighteen miles from Jamestown, where they were entertained by either the Paspahegh Indians in the Sandy Point area or the Weyanoke Indians at Weyanoke Point. It follows that this night marked the first entry by Englishmen into Charles City County. After the Battle of Malvern Hill, Civil War General George McClellan and his troops retreated to Berkeley plantation where the bugle call \"Taps\" was composed by General Butterfield. Lott Cary [ a Charles City native ] bought his freedom from slavery in 1821 and became ordained as a Baptist minister. As many of the slaves were being sent back to Africa, Cary responded by raveling to Africa and establishing the first Baptist church on the continent. The church is still in existence today. Source: Tyler, D. Gardiner, A Brief History of Charles Cit County, Virginia Gleanings From the Past, September 30, 1984. j These excerpts provide 3ust a glimpse of how events and people related to Charles City County have been involved in state, national and international history. Historical and archaeological resources date from prehistoric man. Native Americans, European colonists, and others have left their mark here. The Washington Post has called Charles City 'the land lost in time' because it remains virtually untouched by new development. Many of the historic and archaeological resources can be seen in a pristine setting. Residents are proud of the historical and archeological resources within the County and want to protect and preserve them. The following is only a cursory report of these resources. More can be found in the soon to be published history of the County entitled Four Centuries of the Southern Experience: Charles City County, Virginia. From the Age of Discovery to the Modern Civil Rights Struggle. Historical Sites and Structures The Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission has recorded approximately 78 sites and structures in the County, dating as early as the 17th century. The County is well-known for its abundance of plantation houses from that time period. In general, historical sites and structures are found primarily in the southeastern section of Charles City County along the James River. The James River was an influential factor in the location of early settlements in Charles City. One of the oldest roads in Charles City County, Route 615, also has many historic sites along its route. Twenty-three of the 78 sites are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. (Refer to Map _ ) These landmarks are considered important to State history. Berkeley, Sherwood Forest, Shirley, and Westover Plantations have been recognized as National Historic Landmarks. This designation is the highest ranking given to historical sites and structures, and is given to landmarks that are significant to American history. Berkeley was the birthplace of Benjamin Harrison, signer of the Declaration of Independence, and William Henry Harrison, ninth president of the United States. Another president, John Tyler, made his home at Sherwood Forest in 1845. Shirley Plantation is considered to be a superb architectural example of plantation society, while Westover is a premier example of Georgian architecture. The presence of historical resources has undoubtedly impacted the development of the County and its economy. Much of the development activity continues to take place near and around these historical areas. Route 5, which links together and provides access to many of the historical sites in the County, has been designated as a Virginia Byway. As a result, tourism has increased as a significant economic resource. Many of the historic sites and structures are open to the public, and spinoff commercial activities, such as bed and breakfast establishments, have been developed to take advantage of the County's historical culture. The Division of Historic Landmarks recently completed a windshield survey of Charles City County to provide Richmond Regional Planning District Commission with updated information to integrate into the Plan. The survey identified approximately 157 historic properties never previously recorded by the Historic Landmarks Commission. Major recommendations of the survey included: a more intensive study of historic resources to be conducted within the County before the next revision of the Comprehensive Plan. 2 the establishment of rural historic districts along Route 5 and Route 615. the development of a slide tape program on historical and archaeological sites in the County to be used in the public school system. A copy of the survey can be obtained 'from the Department of Economic Development or the Division of Historic Landmarks. Archaeological Findings Charles City County contains a vast array of archaeological sites which date as far back as the beginnings of man and include early American settlement. Presently, 291 archaeological sites have been discovered in Charles City. Most of these archaeological sites lie along the James and Chickahominy Rivers and waterways extending into the interior of the County. Map _ provides a general overview of archaeological findings in the County. The earliest archaeological sites in Charles City can be found on Weyanoke. The peninsula has been occupied since 8000 B.C., and contains many sites from the Prehistoric and Middle Archaic periods. Eppes Island also has a significant number of prehistoric sites from the Archaic and Woodland periods. Archaeological findings reveal the presence of Native American communities in Charles City County in the early 1600's. Sites consist mainly of indian camping grounds along the shoreline areas. Three indian tribes were identified: the Chickahominy along that river, the Paspahegh in the Sandy Point area, and the Weanac in the Weyanoke neck area. Many Europeans established settlements in the same areas of Charles City as the Native Americans. Sites indicate the presence of farming communities and industrial activities along the James River. In fact, brick making at Sturgeon Point is considered to be one of the first sites for that industry in the nation. Plantations sites are also found in abundance in Charles City County. Many of the plantation houses have been preserved and help to understand the society of that period. The plantation settlements found on Upper Weyanoke are especially significant because they encompass three centuries of plantation life. It is expected that many more sites exist in Charles City County, but have not yet been detected. The time and labor necessary to survey one archaeological site limits the ability for a county-wide survey to be conducted. Therefore, archaeologists suggest that an archaeological survey be required before development of a particular tract of land begins. 3 SummarV Charles City County is a reflection of America's past. Its historic and archaeological resources provide important data concerning the development of early man, settlements of Native Americans, the entry of the English into the New World, and the colonial and plantation periods. The County serves as an historic \"laboratory\" because the majority of these resources have been preserved in their authenticity. Residents of the County recognize the quality and significance of these artifacts and welcome exploration of 'the land lost in time'. 4 HISTORIC Ek ARCHEOLOGICAL k rp ROXSURV 0 SITES MaRES STORE 667 609 Afetv /(617t C01411ti, 106 631 Property listed 653 6 on National Register. 629 56 Identified Archeological Sites k' 629 106 1 666 It 6 k 609 611 630 634 155 V, 604 4 , z 6 610 65 617 654 Hardens 650 ADKINS 614 STORE 63�-- Lott Cary 620 Birth Si Piney r606 106 602 660 156 651 646 Grove 1), @4 612 662 0615 607 648 Glebe of Westover 623 Y 663 607 HMDCF.OFT 639 94 1, 64 155 Pari�,h--' RUTHVILLE 601 Mer c? /I , - 626 ... 612 ......

Comparing data across time or to State or regional figures provides benchmarks to discern the significance of the data. An understanding of present conditions is necessary to be able to plan for the future. This section looks at who lives in Charles City County, where they live and where they work. Projections about future County residents are provided. Most of the data used in this section is taken from the U.S. Bureau of Census. Other sources include the Richmond Regional Planning District Commission, Virginia Department of Planning and Budget, Virginia Employment Commission, and the Charles City County Marketing Book. Population Characteristics The following provides information concerning the population makeup of the County and how the population has changed over the years. Also presented are population projections for the County, the region and the State. Historical Growth The County population has increased steadily since 1970. In 1970, 6,158 persons resided in the County. The population increased to 6,692 persons in 1980. By 1985, it was estimated that 6,900 people lived in the County. (Refer to Table A-1) The County's population is concentrated in the Harrison and Tyler magisterial districts. The Harrison district, located in the western part of the County, contains almost one half of the County's population. The Tyler district, located in the central portion of the County, contains approximately 40 percent of the population. The remainder live in the Chickahominy district, located in the eastern portion of the County. The fastest growing portion of the county between 1970 and 1980 was the Tyler District, growing by over 16 percent during that decade. The County's population has grown less rapidly than the region or state. Both the region and the state displayed about a 15 @ercent increase from 1970 to 1 .980 while Charles City County increased by only 8.6 percent. From 1980 to 1985, the region and state indicated a percentage change of 6.7 and 6.1, respectively. During that sane period, the County population increased one half as rapidly at 3.1 percent. 1 Population Proiections Based on projections by the Richmond Regional Planning District commission, Charles City County's population is expected to increase to 8,550 persons by 2010. (Refer to Table A-2) The County's population increases between 1990 and 2000 and 2000 and 2010 are expected to be 9.1 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively. These projected increase are similar to the actual increase between 1970 and 1980. Also, they are almost identical to the projected increases in the State population. The County is still projected to grow slower than the region, however. Age Distribution and Median Age Table A-3 indicates a substantial change in the age distribution between 1970 and 1980. Persons 19 years of age and younger decreased from 47 percent of th 'e population in 1970 to 36 percent in 1980. Meanwhile persons in the 20 to 64 age group increased from 45.7 to 55.6 percent of the population duringthe same period. This is significant in that persons 19 years of age and younger depend on the County for educational, recreational and other services. Persons 20 to 64 typically pay the taxes that allow the County to provide these services. An increase in the percentage of tax providers coupled with a decrease in tax \"users\" can have a favorable impact on County revenues. The median age of County residents in 1970 was 22 years. This was below the 1970 statewide median age of 26.8 years. In 1980, the median age in the County increased to 27.8 compared with the state median age of 29.8. In other words, while both the County and State populations are aging, the County is getting older faster than the State. Racial Composition The majority of Charles City residents are black. (Refer to Table A-4). In 1970 and 1980, blacks composed seventy percent or more of the total population. The percentage decreased between 1970 and 1980, with the change being accounted for by an increase in the while population. Native Americans population share remained constant at eight percent in 1970,and 1980. Education County residents made significant strides in educational achievement between 1970 and 1980. As shown in Table A-5, 38 percent of the population had finished high school in 1970. By 1980, the share of high school graduates increased to 51 percent, a figure in excess of the state percentage. 2 The County still lagged behind the State in percentage completing college, however. In 1980, 16 percent of Charles City residents had completed college, less than half the State figure of 34 percent. Household ComDosition In 1970 and 1980, over 80 percent of the households were family-headed households. (Refer to Table A-5). A family-headed housedhold is two or more individuals living together related by birth, marriage or adoption. These percentages were above the state percentage (75%) in 1980. In 1980i the percentage of female-headed households in the County was also greater than the percentage of female-headed households in the State. Average Household Size Household size data shows that while the average number of persons per household decreased between 1970 and 1980, household size in the County still exceeded State and regional averages. (Refer to Table A-5) While the average household size in the County is expected to continue to decline, it is expected to continue to exceed State and regional projections. Housing Characteristics An analysis of housing characteristics can help in the understanding of present housing conditions. This analysis can also be used to project the number and type of units necessary to house future populations. Number of Housing Units and Housing Unit Projections In 1970, there was a total of 1,568 housing units,in Charles City County. The number of housing units increased to 2,152 in 1980. (Refer to Table B-1) Future housing needs can be developed using projected population, household size and vacancy rate numbers. Based on projections provided by the Richmond Regional Planning District Commission, the County will need a total of 3,307 housing units in 2010. This represents an increase of 37 units per year between 1980 and 2010. Type of Housing Unit Single family dwellings dominate the housing stock in Charles City County. Table B-2 indicates that in 1970, single family dwellings accounted for 90 percent of the housing stock. In 1980 the portion of single family dwellings decreased to 80 percent. According to census information, single family homes and 3 mobile homes were the only type of housing available in 1970; no duplex or multi-family units were counted that year. By 1980, duplexes and multi-family units accounted.for nine percent of the housing stock. The percentage of mobile homes increased from ten percent in 1970 to eleven percent in 1980. Comparing housing types in the County with State figures indicates two major differences. The percentage of duplex and multi-family units in the County is approximately half the State figure. on the other hand, the percentage of mobile homes in the County is twice the State figure. Building Permit Data A review of building permit data confirms that single family dwellings and mobile homes continue to dominate residential development activities. (Refer to Table B-3). Between 1980 and 1987, 354 building permits were issued. Fifty-four percent of these permits were for site-built single family dwellings, while the remaining 46 percent were for mobile homes. An analysis of housing construction by year between 1980 and 1987 shows that while yearly permits fluctuated greatly, the average for the period was 44 units per year. This level of activity compares favorably with the 37 units per year necessary to meet future housing requirements. Tenure and Vacancy Rate Most of the housing in Charles City County are owner-occupied. As shown in Table B-4, the percentage of owner-occupied units decreased from 80 to 77 percent between 1970 and 1980. The 1980 figure still exceeded the State percentage, however. The percentage of rental units in the County was approximately half the State figure. Median Housing Value and Contract Rent Dramatic shifts in housing value occurred in Charles City County from 1970 to 1980. Table B-5 shows that in 1970, 96 percent of owner-occupied housing was valued at $20.,000 or less. The median housing value in 1970 was $6,700. In 1980, the median housing value increased to $27,200; while only 30 percent of the @ousing was valued at $20,000 or less. Although housing values increased dramatically from 1970 to 1980, Charles City County housing values were still lower than State housing values in 1980. The median housing value for the State in 1980 was $48,000. Rental housing statistics changed considerably during the period betwee 1970 and 1980. Figures displayed in Table B-5 indicate that in 1970, 62 percent of Charles City households were paying no rent, while 38 percent were paying less than $100. 4 Median rent payments were $30. In 1980, the percentage of persons not paying rent decreased to 31 percent. Forty-nine percent of the population started paying over $100 per month. By 1980, median rent in the County had increased to $97. However, rents in the County again lagged behind when compared to the State average of $207. Housing Conditions Figures on housing units lacking complete plumbing facilities and number of persons per room are two indicators used to evaluate housing conditions. Statistics in Table B-6 indicate a substantial increase in the percentage of units having complete plumbing between 1970 and 1980. Yet, twenty percent of the housing units in Charles City County remained without complete plumbing in 1980. This was well above the state figure of 4 percent. Information on persons per room is used as a measure of overcrowding. Housing with more than 1.00 person per room signifies overcrowding, while over 1.51 persons per room indicates severe overcrowding. Table B-7 indicates that crowding eased in the County between 1970 and 1980. Only 74 percent of the population in the County had their own room in 1970 compared to 80 percent in 1980. Again, however, overcrowding was still more common in Charles City than the State. Economic Characteristics Analyzing the local economy is one of the most revealing ways to examine the existing development activities and development potential of a community. Income and employment statistics provide the main types of information gathered in this analysis. Household Income and Household Income Proiections Household income statistics for the County, shown in Table C- 1, were very similar to the State figures in 1979. The median income for Charles City residents was $17,120 while the state figure was slightly higher at $17,475. Median household income is expected to continue to climb in both the State and the County, with the County figure growing somewhat faster than the State. By 1990, the County median household income is projected to be $27,287, slightly higher than the State figure of $26,874. Poverty Status Approximately 13 percent of the County population was living below the poverty level in 1979 (Refer to Table C-2). Forty-five percent of the persons who had related children under 18 years of age and ten percent of the elderly had incomes which fell below the poverty level. Poverty status for these special population groups were slightly higher in the County than the State. 5 Labor Force Characteristics In 1980, approximately 67 percent of the Charles City population participated in the labor force. Information in Table C-3 indicates that the County rate was approximately three percent higher than the State labor force participation rate.. The County unemployment rate was 5.1 percent, almost identical to the State unemployment rate of 5.0 percent. Males were more active in the labor force than females in Charles City County. Males were participating in the labor force at a rate of 76.3 percent in 1980, while only 58 percent of the females in the County were employed. Males had a lower unemployment rate, 4.8 percent for males versus 5.5 percent for females. Place of Work Most Charles City residents are employed outside the County. (Refer to Table C-4). In 1970, 71 percent of the working population was employed outside the County. The percentage of persons working outside the County increased to 80 percent in 1980. These out-commuting patterns are typical for rural counties near a metropolitan area. For example, 86 percent of the James City County population was employed outside the County, while 80 percent of the workers in adjoining New Kent County commuted outside the locality in 1980. of the 2,212 residents who worked outside Charles City County, Table C-6 indicates that 991 (45%) worked in Richmond in 1980. Fifteen percent of the population worked in Henrico County, while 13 percent of the County were employed in New Kent County or Williamsburg. Travel Time to Work Table C-5 indicates that the median travel time to work for Charles City residents in 1980 was 34.7 minutes. Median travel time for workers across the State was only 23.3 minutes. More specifically, 66 percent of the County workers traveled 30 minutes are more to their place of employment, more than twice the State figure of 32 percent. Again, these travel times are similar to figures in other rural counties. In New Kent County, 60 percent of the workers traveled 30 minutes or more to their jobs in 1980. Occupation of Charles City Workers Occupation refers to the type of job of an employed person. A comparison of 1980 information shows several differences in 6 occupation between Charles City residents and statewide figures. Only 12 percent of Charles City workers were in managerial or professional specialty occupations in 1980, half the State figure. operators, fabricators and labors accounted for 37 percent of County workers compared with 18 percent in the State. Other occupations varied also. Types of Industries Employing Charles City Workers Charles City workers are employed by a variety of industries. Data in Table C-8 shows that 35 percent of those employed in 1980 worked in the manufacturing industry. This was substantially greater than the State figure of 19 percent. The largest percent of state workers (29 percent) were employed in service jobs. This figure was similar to the 24 percent of County employees. Type of.Establishment and Number of Employees Per Establishment A total of 76 establishments were in operation in Charles City County in 1987 (Refer to Table C-9). These businesses employed 606 people. The most prevalent types of employers in the County were: Services (25%), Government (18%), and Cons't-, ruct ion (16%). Comparing the number of establishments with the number of employees, one can see that all of the businesses in Charles City County were small operations. The biggest employer in the County was Government, employing 263 people and making up 43 percent of the employment base in the County. Emplovment Projections Employment projections, displayed in Table C-10, show that the number of jobs in Charles City County will increase in future years. By 2010, non-agricultural employment is estimated to be 1,300 jobs. This increase denotes a 87 percentage change from 1980. Government will remain the leading employer while the manufacturing and service industries will employ the largest number of workers in the private sector. Wages People employed in Charles City County in 1987 earned the lowest wage per hour of any other jurisdiction in the region (Refer to Table C-11).

Natural features can greatly enhance the quality of development by virtue of its visual beauty, through the moderation of temperature by trees, the cleansing of the air by plants, the reduction of unwanted sights and sounds by hills and berms, and in countless other ways. Conversly, natural features can prohibit or make difficult certain types of development. Examples included, building on steep slopes, in floodplains and wetlands. In turn, desireable natural features can be degraded or destroyed by incompatible development activities. The home built in a floodplain, the septic system constructed in improper soil, and the wetland filled to accommodate a shopping center are examples of the incompatibility of development and natural features. It is important to identify and understand natural features for the benefit of the feature, and the development. Development does not have to clash with natural features, and usually they can work together. The following is an inventory of natural features in Charles City County. The features include topography, slope, hydrology, wetlands, flood plains, soils, sand and gravel, forests, prime agricultural land, and rare and endangered species. The f inal section in this chapter deals with efforts to implement the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act. TopograPhY The topography of land is the configuration of it's surface, including relief, and the position of it's natural features. Topography includes an area's size, elevations, and the location and shape of mountains, valleys, bluffs, lakes, rivers, and streams, among others. Topography is important in that it af f ects the aesthetic qualities of an area, plant and animal habitat, climate, and the type and location of man's development activities. Charles City County is located in the south-central portion of the Commonwealth. It is bounded to the north by New Kent County, the east by James City County, the south by Surry County, Prince George County, and City of Hopewell, and to the west by Henrico County. The County has 184 square miles of land area and 20 square miles of surface water. The County lies entirely in the coastal plain physiographic region, a region that runs north-south along the Eastern Seaboard of Virginia. Charles City County is generally flat with a gently rising 1 and falling topography. Elevations in the County average less than 80 feet, with the highest elevations around 150 feet. The lowest elevations are at sea level and are found along the major rivers. In general, the higher 'elevations gently slope down from the west- northwest part of the County to the east-southeast. The land also slopes down to the northern border. slope Slope is defined as \"the rise over the run\". Slope is a measure of the change in vertical distance (height) over a horizontal distance (length) expressed as a percentage. For example, a change of 5 feet over a distance of 100 feet equals a slope of 5 percent. It is generally acknowledged that a slope of 15% or greater presents a constraint to many types of development. Steep slopes (greater than 15%) are difficult to build on, place damaging stress on buildings, are easily erodible, and, when disturbed, contribute to sedimentation and pollution of streams. The majority of the County has slopes of 15% and less. Figure L shows that slopes greater than 15% can be found along bluffs adjacent to the Chickahominy River and some of it's tributaries, and in scattered areas along the James. Hydrology Hydrology addresses the distribution and circulation of surface and groundwater. Rivers, streams, wetlands, floodplains, and groundwater aquifers are elements of the hydrology of an area. Understanding hydrology is useful in determining the quality and quantity of water available for human consumption, waste treatment, and irrigation. Surface Water The many rivers and streams that flow through Charles City County have played a significant roll in the development and history of the County. The locations and general characteristics of the rivers and streams will greatly impact future development. The County's southern boundary lies along the James River. The James is the largest river adjoining the County. The Chickahominy River, the second largest, forms the northern boundary, and as it curves south, also forms the eastern boundary. There are many other significant smaller streams that are tributary to the these rivers. The County is nearly evenly divided by the James and Chickahominy drainage basins. Even though the Chickahominy drains as much of the County as the-James, it is actually a sub-basin of 2 Figure I -SLOPES STEEP\" Ro@xaw 0\\ 6 Slopes greater than 15%.

Both rivers flow from west to east with the Chickahominy joining. the James in the southeast corner of the County. The James River is an estuary in Charles City County, that is, it is influenced by the ebb and flow of lunar tide cycles. Fresh water flowing down from the upper basin mixes with the salty waters moving up from the Chesapeake Bay. The concentration of salt water is greatest at the mouth of the river and gradually decreases upriver. The salinity of the James as it passes through the County varies from season to season. Up-river from Charles City County there are approximately 15 major municipal and industrial dischargers to the James River. These dischargers affect the water quality of the river downstream through the discharge of pollutants contained in their effluents. The extensive growth and urbanization of upstream localities also adversely impacts the water quality in the James due to the runoff of pollutants from such activities. Part of the Chickahominy River in Charles City County is estuarine, and part non-tidal (not influenced by lunar tides). Walkers Dam, located 22 miles upstream from the mouth of the river, provides a barrier to further movement of tidal currents. That part of the river downstream from the dam is tidal, and that above, nontidal. The tidal portion is saline with concentrations similar to the James. The City of Newport News utilizes the water impounded by Walkers Dam as a raw water supply. For this reason the watershed above Walkers Dam requires protection from development activities that would adversely affect water quality. The State Water Control Board has developed strict standards for water quality and effluent discharges from Walkers dam to it's headwaters. Ground Water The nature and extent of ground water in the County is less well known than for surface water. This information gap has narrowed recently with the publication of Ground-Water Resources of the York-James Peninsula of Virginia by the United States Geological Survey. This study of the ground water of the York- James peninsula includes Charles City County. The report is a good source of information on ground water of the peninsula. The executive summary of the report reveals significant findings. \"[W]ithdrawal of ground water has caused a lowering of water levels throughout the multiaquifer system and has created cones of depression centered at and expanding outward from areas of concentrated ground-water use.\" 3 \"Withdrawal is expected to increase, further lowering water levels[,] ... result[ing] in interference among ground-water users and the possible movement of salty water into freshwater parts of aquifers.\" \"The availability of ground water for meeting future water needs has become a matter of local and regional concern.\" In general, the County is underlain by a geology made up of sand and gravel. A cross section of the hydrogeology reveals an unconfined surface aquifer with a water table at or close to the soil surface. The surface aquifer is underlain by seven confined aquifers, that is, aquifers separated from each other by an impermeable layer such as clay. Water for human consumption and other uses in the County is withdrawn from these aquifers. Residents and businesses in the County are served entirely by ground water at this time. There are 3 community systems in the county serving house holds and businesses. The rest of the County is served by individual well systems. Wetlands Wetlands are low-lying areas with water saturated soil. The source of water may come from rainfall, groundwater, or ocean tides. Marshes, swamps, and mud flats are obvious examples of wetlands, although there are other types that are not as conspicuous. Wetlands perform several important functions. Wetlands improve@ water quality by slowing the flow of water and allowing excess suspended solids, nutrients, and toxic substances to settle out of the water column. Some of these pollutants are taken up and used by wetland plants, while the rest are broken down by bacteria into less harmful substances. Wetlands act as natural buffers against flood waters by slowing the velocity of the flow, absorbing excess volume, and releasing flood waters at a slow rate. Wetlands prevent erosion by binding together soil through their extensive root systems. This prevents the loss of valuable uplands such as agricultural and forestal land. Wetlands contribute to the flow of rivers and streams by serving as discharge points for groundwater. This helps to maintain streamflow during drought conditions. In some cases they act as recharge areas for groundwater. Wetlands produce great amounts of food which feed small organisms, which in turn are fed upon by larger organisms, and so on. Eventually man feeds on organism, such as fish, fowl, and meat, produced by this 'chain'. Wetlands serve as habitat for many important commercial and recreational birds, fish, and mammals. They provide food, nesting areas, shelter, and protection. 4 Charles City County has extensive areas of both tidal and nontidal wetlands as seen on figure _2,, Tidal wetlands are influenced by the ebb and flow of lunar tides. These wetlands are found along the James River and it's tidal tributaries, and the tidal portion of the Chickahominy River and it's tidal tributaries. Nontidal wetlands are usually low lying areas, with a high water table that 'saturates the soil surface. Nontidal wetlands are isolated from tidal influences. Nontidal wetlands are found along nontidal portions of streams tributary to the James River, and along nontidal tributaries of the Chickahominy River and that portion upriver from Walkers Dam. Flood Plains A flood plain is level land lying adjacent to a river or stream that may become submerged by floodwaters. Floodplains are formed by silt and sediment deposited by a stream. The 100 year flood plain is that area of land that would be inundated by a f lood that statistically occurs once in 100 years. In other words, land lying within the 100 year flood plain would have a 1% chance of being flooded in a years period of time. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal Emergency Management Agency, has developed flood plain maps, under authority of the National Flood Insurance Act. These maps define those areas that are eligible for inclusion under the National Flood Insurance Program. They have been used in this survey to define those areas in Charles City County that fall in the 100 year flood plain. The FEMA maps have not been field checked, and may contain inaccuracies that can only be corrected though field inspection. The flood plain map indicates, generally, where the 100 year flood plain -is located. The map indicates where caution should be exercised when deciding where to locate development. Flood plains as mapped in Charles City County are primarily located along the James and Chickahominy Rivers and some of their tributaries. Figure a shows flood plain areas in Charles City County. soils Development activities are affected to a large extent by soils. 'Building construction, roads, bridges, septic systems, agriculture and forestry, need to occur in or on the right soil types to ensure their success.

RUSTIC Prince George County 5 623 p. z.0W SAkM CHARLES CITY COUNTY (D SCAL9 IN PMaT Prepared by Richmond Regional Planning District Commission Service in cooperation with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University has recently completed a draft soil survey of Charles City County. -This survey will be published for distribution in the near future. Information in this section was obtained from the Soil Conservation Service and represents the most current data available. The soil survey contains a large amount of valuable information that will be useful in the County's planning process. The survey contains maps that delineate all of the soil types within the County, as well as information on each soil such as, yields per acre of crops and pasture, woodland management and productivity, recreational development, wildlife habitat, building site development, sanitary facilities, construction materials, water management, engineering properties and classifications, physical and chemical properties of the soils, soil and water features, and other information. There are two issues of particular importance to Charles City County that are directly related to soils; (1) soil suitability for on site sewage treatment, and (2) the inclusion of highly erodible and highly permeable soils in Chesapeake Bay preservation areas. Figure + shows soil suitability for on-site sewage treatment. This information was produced in cooperation with representatives of the U. S. Soil Conservation Service (SCS), Virginia Department of Health, Charles City County, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and Richmond Regional Planning District Commission. This is a generalized map, and does not substitute for a site specific analysis of soils. This figure shows that 76% (88,700 acres) of the County contains soils that are unsuitable for any type of on-site sewage treatment system. Twenty-four percent of the County (27,400 acres) contains soils that are suitable. Within the soils that are suitable, 72% (19,621 acres) have severe limitations for on site systems, and 28% (7,779 acres) have moderate to slight limitations. Slight to moderate limitations may require on-site systems ranging from septic tanks to expensive mound systems. In anticipation of the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act (see section on Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act) , Figure 15 has been developed and included in the County's comprehensive plan. The map shows two expected components of the preservation areas, highly erodible soils, and highly permeable soils. Only those highly erodible and highly permeable soils found in or adjacent to rivers, streams, and adjoining wetlands are included on this map. Highly erodible soils are soils that are easily dispersed through the action of wind or water. These soils can easily undermine and damage structures that are built upon them. Highly erodible soils are soils with an erodibility value (K) greater than 6 Figure4 SOIL SUITABILITY FOR ON-SITE- RGXBMJW SEWAGE TREATMENT Afew kerit SUITABILITY Good to Moderate Poor Unsuited x 6506 x X,: X 60 ........... . . . .. . .......

Highly permeable soils are soils with a high potential for transmission of pollutants into ground water. Permeability information can be found in the soils information section of the Field Office Technical Guides published by SCS. Sand and Gravel Charles City County has abundant sand and gravel resources. This has already been recognized as evidenced by the several large scale sand and gravel mining operations located in the County. This sand and gravel resource has the potential to benefit the County economically, but if not carefully managed will cause serious environmental damage. Such an abundant resource should be managed for the benefit of the County. Protection of this resource as well as control of it for the protection of other resources is important. Alluvial deposits of sand and gravel have been placed in the County over a large span of geologic time by the James and Chickahominy Rivers. Figure shows those areas in Charles City County that most likely con ain significant sand and gravel deposits, or may contain significant deposits. The ancestral river beds of the James and Chickahominy make up those areas that most likely and may contain significant sand and gravel deposits. This map was produced using information provided by the staff at the Department of Geology, College of William and Mary, in association with the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, Division of Mineral Resources. Data was derived from core samples of soil taken throughout the County. It is intended to serve as a general guide and should not be used as the only source of information when making decisions regarding development. Detailed, site specific analysis is necessary to make accurate decisions. Forests Forests are a benefit to Charles City County both economically and environmentally. Economically, forestry ranks second behind agriculture in it's contribution to the County's economy. Forests benefit the environment by improving water quality and regulating water supply. Water quality is improved through the reduction of erosion and the sedimentation of lakes and streams. Water supply is regulated by the forest's ability to prevent the rapid runoff of precipitation from the land. Forests clean the air by acting as a filter or \"sink . oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide during the process of photosynthesis (the process of converting light energy into useable energy) thus keeping these two constituents in balance. Forests make up habitat that is used by 7 Figure6 SAND a GRAVEL DEPOSITS 0 k 622 HURAS SMIRE 667 /Ve Most likely does not contain sand and gravel deposits. 0 106\" Ket7t Co,,,t, 10 631 ... .... .. .

Forests are aesthetically pleasing and provide attractive homesites and recreational areas. The following information' is contained in Forest Analysis For Charles City County, June 30, 1986. The report is a good source of information on forests in the County. Forests cover 68% (79,342 acres) of the land mass in Charles City County. Forest cover is evenly distributed throughout the County, only broken to any significant extent by some of the large agricultural tracts along the James River. Sixty-eight percent of the forest land is in private ownership, twenty-six percent is in commercial, and the remaining six percent is owned by state or local government. major forest types in the County are loblolly pine, oak-pine, oak- hickory, and oak-gum-cypress. Most of the trees produced are of commercial quality. Prime Agricultural Land Prime farmland is determined by the characteristics of the soil. In addition, moisture and a sufficiently long growing season must be present. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has defined prime farmland soils as \"soils that are favorable for the economic production of sustained high yields of crops\". In addition, \"prime farmland soils produce the highest yields with minimal inputs of energy and economic resources, and farming these soils results in the least damage to the environment\". Prime farmland is important to locate within the County to assure that it is not developed for other uses while non-prime farmland lies idle or is used for farming. in this way prime farmland will be utilized for its best and highest use, while energy is not needlessly wasted on the cultivation of marginal land. The U.S. Soil Conservation Service (SCS) has determined that approximately 37% (43,500 acres) of Charles City County is made up of prime farmland. The far eastern portion of the County contains the fewest acres, with the rest being evenly distributed throughout the remainder of the County to the west. See figure Rare and Endangered SRecies Rare species are plants and animals that, because of their low numbers or the scarcity of the habitat in which they live, are in danger of extinction. Endangered species are those in imminent danger of extinction throughout, their range. Another category, threatened species, are those- that appear to be approaching endangered status. - The extinction of many species of plants and animals have occurred through the ages from both natural and manmade causes. 8 Figure7 PRIME 60 6 flox@amjw, AGRICULTURAL Ok 622 TORE 667 609 New Kent Co(jr)tjf ci Prime Agricultural Soils 631 653 29 661:-', 629,, 6 6 6 630 61 6 617 655 650 T 5 606 62 156 2 0 55 6 106 624 608 627 k CHAALE >b COURT 636 37 6 76 6 621 1.

Through overzealous hunting and the ability to dramatically change the landscape through development, man has greatly accelerated the rate at which species are lost. Information on the location of rare and endangered species in the County was obtained from the Virginia Natural Heritage Program (VNHP) under the Virginia Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. This information should not be considered comprehensive. A comprehensive study for the County has not been conducted. There are certainly many other locations of rare and endangered species that have not been identified. Figure 9 shows those areas in Charles City County that contain rare and endangered species. Each block contains 661 acres. These blocks should not be considered buffer areas for the protection of rare and endangered species. They only indicate that a species is located somewhere within the block. Those blocks with a solid outline contain an area where a report (sighting verified by VNHP staff) of a rare, e ndangered, or threatened species has occurred. The blocks with a dashed outline contain locations that historicall contain rare, endangered, or threatened species. Historic locations were found through the review of research literature by VNHP staff. Those reported and historical rare and endangered species include: bald eagle; double-crested cormorant; nuttall's micranthemem; long's bitter cress; sensitive joint-vetch; dwarf sundew; new jersey rush; hiddenfruit bladderwort; a spikerrush; sweetscent ladies I -tresses; chickahominy water-hyssop; mat-forming water-hyssop; water-purslane; yellow cowlily; and virginia least trillium. Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas In 1987. the General Assembly adopted the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act. The purpose of this Act was to protect and improve the water quality and natural habitat of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Under authority of the Act, the Chesapeake Bay Local Assistance Board is developing criteria for use by local governments in designating Chesapeake Bay Preservation areas, environmentally sensitive lands in and around rivers and streams. The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas will be divided into two areas. The most environmentally sensitive lands, tidal shorelines and tidal and nontidal wetlands and a vegetated buffer will be designated Resource Protection areas. A second area. Resource Management Areas, will consist of floodplains, steep slopes, highly erodible soils and highly permeable soils.

As proposed, land uses in Resource Protection Areas will be limited and- subject to stringent development criteria. Land uses will not be limited in the Resource Management Areas, but they will be subject to development criteria. Regulations and guidelines dealing with all of the above will not be finalized until the end of June, 1989. In anticipation of the adoption of these regulations, a map has been prepared of protection areas that could be included in Resource Protection Areas and Resource Management Areas in the County.

In the initial stages of the planning process, a land use inventory was conducted by the staff of Richmond Regional Planning District Commission for Charles City County. This in-formation was mapped and analyzed to in order to understand existing land use patterns. overview Development is scattered throughout the 184 square mile land area of the County. Concentrations of population are rare. Much of the development that is present is located adjacent to or very near the intersection of primary and secondary roads. Map shows the existing land use pattern. Forest Sixty-eight percent (79,342 acres) of the County's total land area is- covered by forests. Proper environmental conditions, such as soils, topography, and climate, have caused forest to flourish in Charles City. Scattered residential development can be found within these forest areas. Agriculture Agricultural land accounts for 21,350 acres of the County's land area. Tracts of agricultural land are scattered throughout the County. Some of the most visible concentrations of farmland are located along the Route 5 corridor in the southern part of the County.' Soil surveys indicate that 43,500 acres (37 percent) of the land area in Charles City County is prime agricultural land. This designation is based on criteria established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. By comparing the areas of existing farmland with the location of prime agricultural soils in the County, one finds that most of these prime agricultural lands are being used for agricultural purposes. Residential Residential development, like other land uses, is scattered throughout Charles City County. For purposes of this inventory, residential development was divided into two categories. Rural Residential Most of the housing in the County is located in small clusters scatted throughout the County. While some of these clusters are 1 f ound at intersections, most are scattered along secondary roads in the County. In a few cases, rural residential housing is found scattered along a primary road. Approximately 5,908 acres of land was categorized as Rural Residential, making this the largest land use category in the County. Housing in this category is typically located on one to five acre lots. 'The houses face a state maintained road and have direct driveway access to the roadway. All units are served by individual. water wells and septic tank. Mobile homes are also found within the rural residential area. Approximately 200 mobile homes are located in the County. The mobile homes are concentrated in the northwestern section of the County- Suburban Residential Only three Suburban Residential areas, consisting of 277 acres of land, exist in Charles City: Glendale Acres located on Route 604, Mt. Sterling located on Route 155 near Providence Forge, and Riverwood located on Route 645 near the Charles City-James City County line. These residential areas are termed suburban because they exhibit a pattern of development similar to those features typically found in a suburban subdivision. For example, lot sizes are uniform, averaging an acre or less and houses are clustered around a local street instead of having direct access to a major road. PlantationsZBed and Breakfast Operations This category was established to recognize a unique land use activity in the County. Nine plantation and or bed and breakfast operations are located in Charles City County. Except f or one site, these operations are located in older, mainly historically significant homes. Plantations and bed and breakfast operations serve many different land use functions. These establishments are homes for county residents, tourist attractions, commercial establishments or a combination of the above. The level of tourist and commercial activity is controlled by the individual property owner. Most of the plantations and related commercial activities are found along Route 5 near the James River. Commercial The County has a very limited commercial-base. Approximately 30 commercial uses, with a total land area of 19 acres, are in operation. Most of these commercial uses are found dispersed throughout the County in isolated locations, while some small clusters of commercial uses exist at intersections. Concentrations 2 of commercial uses are found at: Adkins Store, Ruthville, the Courthouse, and the intersection of Route 613 and Route 5. The vast majority of these uses consist of country stores, service stations, or a combination of the two. Other types of commercial establishments include: automotive body/repair shops, gift or antique stores, and florists. A small number of service- oriented businesses, such as beauty shops/barbers, are found within Charles City. Industrial Approximately 285 acres of land is used for industrial activities in the county. With the exception of the businesses located in the industrial park area, there are a few industries scattered throughout the County. Most of these industries are related to the many natural resources that exist in Charles City, such as forestry and farming. Other types of industrial uses found in the County include: metal fabrication, alcohol processing, salvage yards, and trucking operations. These industries tend to be small in size and employ only a few people. Most of the industries are located in or near the Roxbury Industrial Center area. The Center is located in the northwestern corner of Charles City County adjacent to Route 106. Approximately 272 acres has been purchased to develop the center which will become the central focus of industrial activity in the County. Only 33 acres of the center has,been developed so far. The area has full utility service and access to rail and highway transportation. One of the unique physical characteristics of Charles City County,is the large deposits of sand and gravel found within the soils. These resources have played a very significant role in the industrial and economic development of the County. Approximately five sand and gravel operations, composing 983 acres of land, are currently mining in the County. These operations are primarily located near the James River. Water-oriented Uses The shoreline areas of Charles City County are primarily undeveloped. Only a few water-oriented uses are located on the rivers. The Hideaway Marina is located in the northeastern part of the County off of Route 623. The marina consists of a boat ramp and a convenience store. A public boat ramp is located within the Chickahominy wildlife Management Area along Morris Creek. Cedarcrest Marina, a barge repair operation, exists at the end of Route 614 along the James River, while two barge ports are found at the sand and gravel operations near Eppes Island and Sandy Point on the James River. 3 Transportation Roads compose 1, 015 acres of land area in Charles City County. Primary roads account for 316 acres of land, while the remaining 699 acres make up the County's secondary road network. A detailed discussion of the transportation network in Charles City County can be found on Page County, State and Federal Land Uses, such as parks, schools, and government off ices, are provided to all Charles City County residents. Approximately 5305 acres of land is owned by the government. Two uses of major importance to State and Federal government authorities are the Chickahominy State Wildlife Area and the Harrison Lake National Fish Hatchery.

Together, these provide necessary services to County residents. Federal and State Government Properties Two very important assets are the Harrison Lake National Fish Hatchery and the Chickahominy State Wildlife Management Area. The Hatchery and the Wildlife Area function to preserve various species of animal and marine life. The-H .a\"Cchery covers approximately 420 acres of land in the southwestern portion of the County. The Chickahominy State Wildlife Management Area consists of 5214 acres and is located east of Route 6,23 along the Chickahominy River. Hunting, fishing, and other recreational. opportunities are provided within the wildlife management area. The Federal Aviation Administration operates an air traffic control facility in Charles City County. The facility is located near Route 615. There are two post offices in the County. These are located in Ruthville and Charles City Courthouse. County offices All of the County departments are housed in the Charles City Courthouse Complex Area. The Courthouse area is the focal point of government activity in Charles City County. The Courthouse is located along Route 5 at the intersection of Route 155. Utilities County residents are served by a variety of public and privately owned utilities. Utilities available are: water, sewer, electricity, gas and oil. Water Service While a majority of residents obtain water from private wells, there are three county owned water systems. Two of these systems, Wayside and Mt. Zion-Rustic, serve residential and commercial needs. The Roxbury Industrial Center has a separate system to serve industrial activity. The Wayside facility currently serves 363 customers in the County and is well below its production capacity. The system is located on Route 658 northwest of Harrison Lake. Approximately 60 customers use the Mt. Zion-Rustic system located on Route 623. The water system, located within Roxbury Industrial Center, has sufficient capacity and fire suppression capability. 1 one private water system has been installed at Glendale Acres. This system only serves the residents of the subdivision. Glendale Acres is located in the northwestern portion of the County on Route 604. Sanitary Sewer Central sewage treatment is provided for the Roxbury Industrial Center by a mass sanitary drainfield. This system is intended fo-7- domestic waste and minor industrial processes. The County is in the process of developing a spray irrigation system for the Roxbury area which will treat up to 40,000 gallons per day. Additional lands will be available for system expansion as the need arises. The Roxbury system is unique in the County. Private, on-site sewage treatment is the only other type of treatment system available. Electricity Virginia Power Company, the electrical service provider for the County, operates a substation off of Route 603 near the company's power lines. Three phase industrial electric service is available in several areas in the County. Adequate electric power is available to 'meet future development needs. Gas and Oil Although natural gas lines are not in place in the County, propane gas is available from local and regional vendors. Fuel oil is provided by several distributors within Charles City County. Solid Waste Disposal At present, one public landfill exists in Charles City County. It is located on Route 660 west of Route 155. This existing landfill will soon be replaced by a regional landfill within the near future. The regional landfill will consist of 390 acres of land and will be located in the northwestern portion of the County, bounded by Route 609 to the west, Virginia Power electrical lines to the north, and Bradley Run to the east. Three transfer stations will be provided: one at the new site, one at the existing site, and one on Route 623 in the Chickahominy District. Public Safet Police, firel and rescue services are provided to County residents by many resources. The County provides police protection which includes a sheriff, five deputies, and five dispatchers. Communication with other law enforcement agencies is well- maintained to assure additional police assistance if needed. Fire 2 protection is provided through a volunteer fire company. There are 42 members in the company, and support agreements are in ef fect with all surrounding jurisdictions. The Providence Forge Volunteer Rescue Squad serves the Charles City County area. Thirty rescue squad members and 25 dispatchers compose the volunteer crew. County Parks Two parks are maintained in the County. Harrison Park, the largest wit-h 19 acres, provides many outdoor recreational activities such as softball and baseball fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, and picnic areas. Hillside Park, located on Route 663 at the Charles City Courthouse Area, has approximately 1. 5 acres of open space. Picnic tables and foot trails are provided. The Recreation Center offers a-variety of outdoor and indoor recreational activities. Some of the outdoor playing fields are lighted for night use. A swimming pool is also located at the Center. The Center houses a gymnasium, arts and crafts rooms, and other facilities. The ten acre site is located in Ruthville. Schools The educational program for Charles City County is divided into four units. Charles City Primary School houses kindergarten through first grade. The school is located on Route 602 near Route 611. Charles City Elementary School houses grades 2-5. It is located at the intersection of Route 609 and Route 607. Grades 6 and 7 are housed at the Charles City Middle School, which is located-at the Courthouse Area. The high school (Grades 8-12) for the County is located in Ruthville. The residents of the County recently approved a ten million dollar school bond. The site for the new school complex will be located on approximately 73 acres of land in the Courthouse area. Three separate schools, (K-5, 6-8, 9-12), will be located at the complex. The project is estimated to be completed by 1991. Other Sixteen churches are located throughout Charles City County. A number of these churches are affiliated with the Baptist denomination. Other denominations present within the County are Presbyterian, Methodist, and Episcopalian. County residents have the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of local organizations. Two of these organizations have their own facilities.

Prepared by Richmond Regional Planning District Commission TRANSPORTATION NETWORK Historically, development activities have originated along transportation routes. Early settlements in the County were along the rivers which- were used to transport freight, mail, and passengers. As settlements moved into the interior of Charles City County, paths were created leading to the river. Between 1918 and 1932, a system of local roads were developed. Ferries and bridges gained importance as people started to use vehicular transport instead-of water-related transportation. This section examines the current transportation network in the County. This network includes highway, water, rail and air transportation. HIGHWAYS Highway rights-of-way occupy 1,015 acres of land area in the County. Primary roads account for 316 acres of land, while 699 acres make up the County's secondary road network. The following description of County highways is based on the Virginia Department of Transportation functional classification of highways. (Refer to Map _). INTERSTATES/MAJOR ARTERIALS No interstates or major arterials are located in the County. The nearest interstate highway is Interstate 64 in adjacent New Kent County. The interstate runs east-west and is located north of the County. Access points to Interstate 64 are the intersection of Route 106 and 1-64 near Talleysville and Route 155 and 1-64 south of Criss Cross. MINOR ARTERIALS Minor arterials provide the principal means of access between the County and other jurisdictions. These routes also carry traffic between local destinations in the County. The following routes are classified as minor arterials. Route 106, running north-south, is located in the western portion of the County. The road not only handles local traffic, but serves a regional purpose by handling traffic between Hopewell and Interstate 64. Recently, the State Department of Transportation upgraded the road to industrial specifications. County officials have established the road as an industrial corridor and desire to develop primarily industrial and intensive uses along the road. Route 5, is considered by residents to be the main highway in the County. Located in the southern portion of the County, it is the primary east-west corridor for local traffic. This route also serves as a link between Williamsburg and Richmond. While this route serves a variety of responsibilities, existing traffic counts are well below capacity according to Virginia Department of Transportation officials. Traf f ic conditions along Route 5 may change in the future, however. Numerous historic sites of national and state prominence are located along the road. Route 5 is also well-known for its aesthetic value. The landscape along. the corridor varies from open f ields, to trees overhanging the road. The road has not been intensely developed and exists, for the most part, in the same condition as it,did many, many years ago. The Virginia Department of Conservation and Historic Resources has designated Route 5 as a Scenic Byway. This designation seeks to give official recognition to unique roadways, but does not regulate development along the corridor. Localities are responsible for any type of protective measure along these corridors. MAJOR COLLECTORS The primary function of major collectors is to carry local traffic between arterial roads and residential neighborhoods. These roads carry high volumes of local traffic within the interior of the County. Major collectors are Route 155, Route 607 and Route 618. MINOR COLLECTORS Minor collector streets also link arterial and residential streets, but carry a lower volume of traffic. Roads classified as minor collectors in the County are: Route 609, Route 602, and Route 614. OTHER IMPORTANT ROADWAYS The following roads are not classified by the State, but are regarded as significant by the County as local roads. Route 600, referred to as Darbytown Road, is located in the northwestern portion of the County. The road extends into the County from adjacent Henrico County. Residential development along Darbytown Road has been prevalent in Henrico County. Charles City officials expect residential growth to continue to spread west into Charles City. Route 603, also located in the northwestern part of Charles City County , is considered a important road in terms of residential development. The road extends from Darbytown Road in the northwest to Route 609 in the northeast. The road crosses Route 106 near the Roxbury Industrial Center. 2 TRANSPORTATION NETWORK OXMIUM 600 622 - MUONIFS STORE 609 667 Ne W Iferit 6 1 631 Functional Classification VIRG111A Minor Arterials 653 ;;'62 03\"/-\" Major Collectors 56 106 629,, 666 I\\X k1 609 611 0 614 55 604 634 60 610 617 65 654 50 tin STORE 614 635 620 06 6 602 660 51 646 612 V 607 662 648 615 6 623 HOILOCWT 6 641 6 155 \"HVILLE t 4 6 (601 12 040 .......

Local residents have great interest in the historic resources of the County and are investigating ways to preserve these resources. There has been some discussion by local residents and the Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission in designating the area surrounding the route as a historic district. Route 615 is located in the center of the County, traveling north from Route 5 and ending at the intersection of Route 623. Route 623, located in the eastern portion of the County, serves as an access route to the Chickahominy Wildlife Management Area and the Hideaway Marina. The road has gained prominence because of its proximity to these recreational resources. PLANNED THOROUGHFARE IMPROVEMENTS Information on proposed improvements was obtained from the Virginia Department of Transportation Six Year Improvement Program and a draft of Virginia Department of Transportation 1989 Statewide Highway Plan. Scheduled improvements are mainly resurfacing of existing roads and improvements to several existing bridges. ONe significant improvement will be the realignment of the intersection of Route 623 and Route 613. OTHER TRANSPORTATION ELEMENTS Highways form the primary transportation network in the County. Other forms of transportation are available in or near the County, however. WATER Historically, water transportation has played a very significant role in the development of Charles City County. Today, water transportation plays a less significant part in the development of the County, but is still linked to the County's economy. Ports for barges transporting sand and gravel deposits are located at near Shirley Plantation and at Sandy Point. The County does have one deep water location, Sturgeon Point. There has been discussion of promoting this location for a port oriented toward ocean-going vessels. This concept does not appear to be feasible at this time due to port activities in Richmond and Hampton Roads. A barge building facility is located at this site presently. RAIL The main line of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad (CSX) crosses the northwestern corner of the County. Service is 3 presently available in Roxbury. Central rail facilities at Richmond offer direct shipment and connections to all parts of the nation through four major railroads. AIR commercial air service is available at nearby Richmond International Airport, located approximately eight miles west of the County. Commercial air carrier passenger service is provided by several air lines. Nationwide and worldwide connections are available through daily scheduled flights. Commuter service is also available. The airport also offers air freight and express service and maintenance facilities for many types of aircraft. The New Kent Airport, approximately five miles north of the Roxbury area of the County is a general aviation airport facility with a 3,200 feet paved runway for use by small corporate aircraft. Fuel and major and minor repair facilities are available. The field is attended during the day and can be lighted at night upon instrument activation. 4 DEVELOPMENT ASSESSMENT Development in Charles City County is influenced by many factors. Some of these, such as regional growth trends or soil conditions, are beyond the control of the County. Other factors, such as the future development pattern, can be influenced by the County. The purpose of this section is to take an honest look at what is happening in and around the County. Regional and local development trends are discussed. Also discussed are those assets that make the County a desirable place to live and work as well as those factors that limit or constrain development. Development Trends in the Richmond Region The Richmond region as a whole is experiencing a steady increase in population, housing units, and employment. According to unpublished data from the Richmond Region Planning District Commission (RRPDC), the population in the Richmond region increased from 632,015 persons to 686,430 between 1980 and 1985. This represents an 8.6 percent increase, exceeding the State's growth rate of 6.1 percent. Population forecasters anticipate continued growth in the region into the next century. Housing stock in the region has grown faster than the population. Between 1980 and 1985, housing stock increased from 241,126 to 269,750 units, an 11.5% increase. Residential development has flourished in the northern, western and southern portions of the region. Recently development has begun to occur in the eastern portion of the region, primarily in New Kent County. The number of jobs in the region has also grown. Non- agricultural employment in the region increased from 327,005 in 1980 to 358,816 in 1985, according to the RRPDC. This represents an increase of 9.7% increase. Labor force participation has increased by an annual rate of two percent while unemployment rates have remained low. Two comments can be made,about growthin the region. First, growth has not been even across the region. Some localities are growing by leaps and bounds; others are growing very slowly, if at all. Second, there is a price to pay for rapid growth. Some local governments find it difficult to keep up with demands from new residents. Local budgets are hard pressed to the limit to provide necessary schools and other services. Charles City County DevelORment Trends Charles City County is one of the localities that has not shared in the rapid growth of the region. County population growth has lagged behind both state and regional trends, showing a 3.1 percent increase between 1980 and'.1985. Future population growth is expected to approximate the state growth rate, but remain behind the regional trend. Likewise, increases in housing stock and new jobs are expected to trail behind the regional trend according to the RRPDC. To many residents, the County growth rate is good news. Development may lag behind the regional trend, but is in keeping with historical County trends. This means that while growth is occurring, it may be more manageable-than-growth being experienced in other parts of the region. DeveloRment Assets The County is fortunate to contain a variety of assets which contribute to the quality of life. Residents are able to enjoy what is essentially a rural life-style and still have the benefits of two urban areas close at hand. Following is a list of assets as identified by the County Planning Commission. Natural Beauty of the Rural Landscape The first thing new visitors notice is the relatively unspoiled beauty of the County. Deep forests and agricultural fields are the predominant land use. Maintaining this rural beauty is just as important today as it was in 1979 when the County adopted the goal of preserving the rural nature a part of the Comprehensive Plan. - Location between Richmond-Williamsburg/James City County. The County's location between two growing urban areas offers a variety of employment, shopping and recreational opportunities not found in rural areas. Theses urban areas also supply large numbers of visitors who are able to come and take advantage of what Charles City County has to offer.. The County's location is a mixed blessing, however. T h e growth currently being experienced in surrounding localities may one day reach the County line. Residential and commercial development is occurring in eastern Henrico County. A recently announced residential community proposed for western James City County could bring large scale development to within a few miles of the County line. As land adjacent to the county is developed, investors will begin to look more closely at Charles City County. Therefore, 2 Charles City must begin now to take action to plan for future development and the demands that development will place on the County. Historical Resources and Tourism. According to the 1989 Virginia outdoors Plan, tourism was the leading industry in the State in 1987, grossing approximately 6.1 billion dollars. Tourism is definitely an important part of this region's economy. Recreational opportunities range from historical -sites to theme parks. Travel,and interest in historic places are expected to continue as a major contributor to the region's economy. Tourist trade from Colonial Williamsburg and Richmond adds to the number of travelers visiting Charles City County. Many residents believe the County's greatest assets are the historical structures and sites. These resources are both a source of local pride and contribute greatly to the local economy. Several historical sites are open to the public. Some provide services such as eating facilities or curio shops. These activities add dollars to the County's tax base as well as providing employment opportunities. This important tie between these historical resources and the local economy was noted in the 1979 comprehensive plan. The County intends to work with private land owners to protect these valuable resources from incompatible development. Agricultural and Forest Land/Prime Agricultural Land. The County contains many thousands of acres of land that is well suited for agricultural and forestal use. In fact, over one- third of the soils in the County are classified as prime agricultural land according to standards established by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. The preservation of agricultural and forest lands is a high priority because of the importance of these resources to the local economy. Preservation of these resources is also important to maintaining the rural character of the County. Route 5 Corridor Route 5 has been designated by the Commonwealth as a Scenic Byway. According to the Virginia Department of Transportation, the purpose of the Byway program is to identify outstanding road segments and to conserve them for the enjoyment of Virginians and out-of-state tourist. The Route 5 corridor is important to County residents for several reasons. The tree lined corridor is the very symbol of the rural character of the County. Route 5 also serves to tie together many historical sites visited by tourist. 3 Route 5 also serves another purpose. It is the only east-west road that runs the entire breath of the County. A variety of users travel Route 5 including through trucks, local traffic, tourist and persons using the designated bike route. While capacity does not appear to be a problem at this time, the existing pavement width and variety of users can make for some close calls. Any future development plans need to incorporate measures to protect the Route 5 corridor, and other principal entrances to the County, from development that would destroy the scenic nature of these roads. Extensive River Frontage The County contains many miles of river front. To date, development along the James and Chickahominy rivers has been limited. Views along and across the both rivers offer few glimpses of urban development. In fact, a portion of the James River from approximately Trees Point eastward into Ja"
