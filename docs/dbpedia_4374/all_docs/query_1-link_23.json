        "text": "Growth\n\nA unique County business, the Williamsburg Pottery, had its beginnings in 1938. In a shed on a half-acre lot beside Route 60, Jimmy Maloney and his potter’s wheel opened what became a multimillion dollar business, which served 3 million customers annually in 30 buildings on 200 acres.\n\nDuring World War II, industrial activity added to the County's agricultural economy. Families of military and civilian workers moved to the area to be near their loved ones. Grove community was settled by Black Americans when the Naval Weapons Station and Camp Peary needed the property on which their homes were located. After the war, many military and civilian families remained, making their permanent homes in Grove.\n\nBy the 1950s the economy was growing away from its agricultural heritage and toward manufacturing and service-oriented businesses. The College of William and Mary, long an academic and cultural pillar and leader of the area's economy, contributed further to County growth. Student enrollment more than doubled from 1955 to 1970, leading faculty, administrators, and students to seek new housing areas beyond the city limits.\n\nLandmarks\n\nMany visitors start their exploration of James City County at the place where it all began: Jamestown Island. Visit the National Park Service Visitor Center and its introductory film, exhibits, and gift shop. Enjoy touring the foundations of old \"James Cittie,\" the ruins of the ancient church tower, the Robert Hunt Shrine, the Memorial Cross, the foundations of one of the colony's early statehouses, and the ongoing archaeological excavations. View demonstrations of glassblowing, one of America's first industries. At nearby Jamestown Settlement, see the reconstructed James Fort, replicas of the 3 ships that brought the original settlers, a Powhatan Indian village and the museum galleries.\n\nWhile your next stop may be Colonial Williamsburg, don’t forget to take note of the numerous historic marker signs along the way. All along James City County’s scenic by-ways, walking paths, and bicycle trails, from the Amblers House at Jamestown Beach, to the Norge Depot, and at many miles in between you will find history is at every roadside."
