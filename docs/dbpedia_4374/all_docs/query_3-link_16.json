(Statutes of Nevada 1901, Chapter L, pages 62-63).\n\nThe Nevada State Board of Irrigation is created with the Nevada Attorney General as a member. (Statutes of Nevada 1901, Chapter LIX, pages 72-73).\n\nThe Nevada Board of Examiners–with the Nevada Attorney General as member thereof–is to pay bounties for the boring of wells for oil, natural gas, and artesian water.
