        "text": "History\n\nThe Town of Eastville is located in Northampton County, on the Virginia Eastern Shore. The new corporate limits of Eastville encompass approximately 409 acres.\n\nThe town is divided by U. S. Route 13, which splits the town into two sections. The eastern section of Town is known as Eastville Station and formerly had its own post office. The western section contains Northampton County administrative offices, the Eastville Post Office, the historic Eastville Inn and Courthouse Green, and various other offices and commercial enterprises.\n\nLocal government began on the Eastern Shore in 1632 when \"commissioners\" meeting as a court in homes of individual members or other places such as taverns or ordinaries. The early court records dating from 1632 were actually kept by the clerks in their homes. In 1667 a new colonial courthouse site was selected in the community known as \"the Hornes,\" (referring to its location between two branches of a bayside creek) was the site for colonial court. A deed in 1780 mentioned \"the Hornes\" as Peachburg Town, by which it was known until about 1800 when it became Eastville. While the significance of the name Eastville is not known, it is thought to have been in coordination with the naming of Westville in Mathews County on the Western Shore across the Bay.\n\nEastville was incorporated in 1896 and remains today the Northampton County seat. An 1835 article about Accomack and Northampton Counties included the following description of Eastville:\n\nEastville P. V. (Postal Village) and seat of justice is in about the middle of the county and two miles from the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Eastville has two principal streets running at right angles to each other. Besides the usual county buildings it contains 21 dwelling houses, 4 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, 1 new and handsome Episcopal Church, 1 common school and 1 Bible society. The mechanical pursuits are: 1 coach factory, which completes about $6,000 worth of work annually; 1 harness maker, 1 cabinet maker, 2 blacksmiths, 2 boot and shoe manufacturers, 3 tailors, 1 house and sign painter and 1 hatter ... The population is 217 persons, of whom 2 are attorneys and 3 are regular physicians. The inhabitants are not to be surpassed for their morality and hospitality to strangers. (Truman, The Eastern Shore of Virginia 1603-1964, p. 168.\n\nIn 1922, most of the eastern downtown section was lost to fire.\n\nFrom the Eastville Comprehensive Plan 2018\n\nTake a Self-Guided Walking Tour of Eastville History:\n\nA Walk Through Eastville. A Walk Through History.\n\nThe County Seat\n\nThe County administration building's west entrance. Photo credit: Jean E. Flynn\n\n\"Eastville has been the Seat of Northampton County since 1680. The Old Courthouse was constructed about 1731 and the oldest continuous court records in the nation (dating from 1632) are preserved here and can be viewed by the visitor. The Declaration of Independence was publicly read from the steps of the courthouse on August 13, 1776. \"\n\n(Source: http://www.easternshorevisitor.com/eastville-virginia.html)\n\n\"The city, town, or populated place that houses county government is known as the seat of its respective county. Generally, the county legislature, county courthouse, sheriff's department headquarters, hall of records, jail and correctional facility are located in the county seat, though some functions (such as highway maintenance, which usually requires a large garage for vehicles, along with asphalt and salt storage facilities) may also be located or conducted in other parts of the county, especially if it is geographically large.\"\n\n(Wikipedia)\n\nThe County Seat of Northampton is also known as \" 'the Hornes', so named because of its location between the curving, prong-like branches of another Bayside creek. \"The Hornes\" later became Peachburg Town and finally Eastville. It has been the county seat of Northampton County for over three hundred years.\" (Source: Frances Bibbins Latimer)\n\nThis complex is located at 16404 Courthouse Road, Eastville, Virginia 23347.\n\nThe new courthouse, regional jail, sheriff's office and social services building were constructed in 2006 and are located behind the administration building and Historic Court Green at 5229 The Hornes, Eastville, Virginia 23347.\n\nCourthouse Rd. and Willow Oak Rd.\n\nAt the corner of Courthouse Road and Willow Oak Road you'll find some older buildings that have been rehabilitated for new purposes. An old gas station is now the home of interior design consultant, Jeannette Coulter of Design Philosophy. The very old mercantile store houses various offices and services. The old bank is in the process of being renovated into offices.\n\nIncidentally, Willow Oak Road is named after the National Big Tree Champion willow oak tree located at the home of Ralph W. Dodd, owner of the real estate firm Ralph W. Dodd and Associates located on Courthouse Road. The willow oak stands at 105 feet and has a circumference of 328 inches. The Virginia Big Trees website states: \"This tree has traded national champion status back and forth with one in Chesapeake. Recognized in 2018 as three-way national co-champion with trees in Chesapeake and Mathews, VA. Both trees were measured in 2013, and this tree was found to be larger. Appears to be in excellent health. It is not endangered by building projects or highway changes. Located within walking distance to the historic Eastville Courthouse, which is home of the oldest continuous court records in the nation.\" Northampton County is also home to a Champion Loblolly Pine tree which stands at 134 feet and has a circumference of 184 inches and a National Champion Hercules Club located on Fisherman's Island National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThe Willow Oak with some damage to one of it's enormous limbs after a storm.\n\nPhotos by Jean E. Flynn\n\nEastville Master Garden\n\nPhoto credit: Jean E. Flynn\n\nPlants are labeled with the Latin and common name.\n\nEastville Gardens is located in the historic town of Eastville on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, in a complex of county government and administration buildings both old and new. The county courthouse is the repository for the oldest continuous court records in the United States dating from the early 1700s to the present.\n\nA plan for the Gardens, situated between the 1789 Eastville Inn and the Courthouse and Administration buildings, was conceived and begun in 2002. This undeveloped ‘plain space' was designed by two Eastern Shore ladies in 2002, and executed by a young boy scout working for his Eagle badge.\n\nPhoto credit: Jean E. Flynn\n\nThe garden’s design is based on a 60-foot square plot divided into quarters with pebble walkways dissecting the square diagonally. A bench, located in the center where the paths meet, invites the visitor to sit and enjoy this cool, breezy spot.\n\nFour crepe myrtles were planted at the center of each quadrant in 2002, and the garden at that time was sunny all day.\n\nIn 2007, kitchen herbs were planted in the Gardens, for the use of the restaurant then occupying the Inn. Today, the lovely blue rosemary hedge along the southern border is all that remains of that herb bed. Although the ensuing ten years brought neglect to the Gardens, the Master Gardeners have restored and developed its beauty since that time.\n\nToday, with the growth of the crepe myrtles, the once sunny garden is now quite shady. Efforts are made annually to trim back the four trees to allow more sun to come through. Shade loving plants have been introduced, with an effort to include as many native plants to the garden as possible. The map of the Eastville Gardens, developed in 2018, will identify and locate all these plants for the visitor. The Master Gardeners who maintain this garden weekly hope you will enjoy your visit and come back soon!\n\nLearn more about Master Gardens in Northampton County.\n\nDid you know Northampton County, Virginia has a sister County?\n\nQueen Anne's County in Maryland is our sister County and it all came about in February of 2016 when the indomitable Ms. Mary Margaret Revell Goodwin, Queen Anne's County, Maryland Historian and a small contention of \"minutemen\" marched from Queen Anne's County Maryland to the Historic Court Green in Eastville, Virginia. This act was to commemorate the minutemen march in 1776 when a band of men from Queen Anne's County marched to Eastville to warn our citizens that the British were on the move. It was a six-day, 140 mile re-enactment of the journey to help defend the Northampton Courthouse from the British.\n\nEastville Town Clerk, Jonny Stevenson who was the Chair of the 1776 event, entered this letter in our Board records:\n\n\"On, Tuesday, February 9, 2016 the Queen Anne’s County 1776 March for Independence was celebrated on our Historic Court Green. Our community, the Board of Supervisors, and the Eastville Town Council welcomed five Queen Anne’s County citizens, namely: Mary Margaret Revell Goodwin, Commissioner Jack Wilson, Chris Whitesell, Mike Kessler and Mike Bilek. These modern day Minutemen marched in remembrance of the 80 heroic men who embarked 240 years ago on a long mission to defend Northampton County from British attacks.\n\nThe event was a joyous, educational, and patriotic celebration for our community. Groups of students from several schools attended the ceremonies to pay homage to our local history and experience this memorable day. Several of our historic groups (D.A.R., COLONIAL DAMES, and N.H.P.S.) participated monetarily and by volunteering their time in full support. Additionally, local businesses contributed to help make the day a success. The United States Coast Guard presented our country’s colors and the American Legion represented our Veterans. Historian Dennis R. Custis delighted in sharing a wealth of Shore local history concerning the original march and how it had impacted us to a standing room only audience.\n\nThe 1776 Event Committee worked hard to make this day special for both those who marched here and those who live here. Were it not for all the volunteers, donations, and sponsors this special occasion would not have been possible. We are most grateful the County allowed the event to be held in Chambers so all could enjoy the talks and presentations comfortably…Clearly, it has taken a community.\n\nMary Margaret Revell Goodwin, QAC Historian and marcher, plans March 8, 2016 Board of Supervisors that they are to attend the meeting. It is my understanding that she will be presenting two resolutions for consideration; first that Queen Anne’s and Northampton Counties become Sister Counties and second, that Centreville and Eastville become Sister Cities. This 1776 March for Independence has brought positive attention to our county and town and our people…\n\nThis event highlighted the 240th anniversary of both the historic march and the Declaration of Independence, which was adopted shortly thereafter...\n\n1776 Event Committee: Jonny Stevenson Town Clerk and 1776 Event Chair, Eleanor Gordon, Traci Johnson, Wendy Martin, Mary Beth Briggs, Diane Partin and Gwyn Coghill.\"\n\nMs. Mary Margaret Revell Goodwin, the Historian for Queen Anne's County, Maryland, read the following proclamation in reference to the recent 240th Anniversary of the February 3, 1776 March to Northampton County:\n\nThis Proclamation hangs near the Board Chambers on the 2nd floor of the 1899 Courthouse.\n\nProclamation 16-22\n\nWHEREAS, on February 3, 1776, the Queen Anne's County Minutemen left Chester Mill, now Centreville, in Maryland and marched overland through Snow Hill to Northampton County; and\n\nWHEREAS, their orders from the Annapolis Council of Safety were to march to Northampton County to defend the court house there against possible attacks by Lord Dunmore and his troops;\n\nand American Revolutionary War.\n\nWHEREAS, the march was done in cold winter weather and snow; and\n\nWHEREAS, many of the men were without shoes and thus marched barefoot; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Court House was defended by the Maryland Minutemen on several occasions;\n\nand\n\nWHEREAS, the people of Northampton County were generous in their welcome of the Queen Anne's County Minutemen, to such an extent, that they extended their stay in Northampton\n\nCounty beyond the time they had signed and agreed to; and\n\nWHEREAS, in the intervening 240 years, the bonds of friendship formed amongst fellow Eastern Shore people, have lapsed to the point that this act of defense was long forgotten in both\n\nQueen Anne's County and Northampton County; and\n\nWHEREAS, this year 2016, is the 204th Anniversary of 1776, the year of the first march, which ultimately was the first action by the State of Maryland that year, moving towards the\n\nDeclaration of Independence later in the year; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Commissioners of Queen Anne's County have determined to commemorate the 240th Anniversary of 1776; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Commissioners of Queen Anne's County agreed to a second march to commemorate the 240th Anniversary of the march itself;\n\nBe it now known that with the completion of the march on Monday, February 8, 2016, the County of Queen Anne's and the County of Northampton again renew their ties of friendship\n\nestablished 240 years ago and proclaim this bond a tie that will remain unbroken and proclaim that Queen Anne's County and Northampton County are now sister counties, bound in the\n\nfriendship established by defense during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nWhat a remarkable gesture of unity!"
