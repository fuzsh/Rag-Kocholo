        "text": "The Delaware Governor's Mansion, also known as Woodburn or Governor's House, is the official residence of the governor of Delaware and the governor's family. It is located in Dover and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \"Governor's House\" since 1972. This historic site offers a unique glimpse into the state's history and the lives of its governors.\n\nConstruction and Early Use of Woodburn\n\nConstructed in 1790 by Charles Hillyard III, Woodburn has a rich history. It was first used as the executive's residence in 1820 when it was leased to the Governor, Jacob Stout. This marked the beginning of its role as a significant political landmark in Delaware.\n\nWoodburn's Role in the State Museum System\n\nThe Governor's House holds great architectural significance as an exemplary surviving specimen of high-quality 18th century residences in Delaware. It has been diligently preserved as an essential component of the State museum system. This system aims to showcase representative Delaware houses from different eras and socioeconomic strata, providing visitors with a comprehensive view of the state's architectural history."
