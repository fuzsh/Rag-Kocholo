        "meta_description": "Annjanet R. Woodburn, Ed.D., the woman with the beautiful smile and wise brown eyes was born on June 8, 1965 in Kingston, Jamaica to Loris Harmer and Victor Jones.  Happy Tuesday!  No, she was not from Country; those from Jamaica know what I mean.  At the tender age of eleven she migrated, much to her dismay, to a city filled with concrete and walls; the Bronx, New York that is.    Annjanet was a quiet scholar she did not brag or boast, however, she earned an undergraduate degree in Computer Information Systems, a Master of Science in Education from Baruch College, and a second master’s in education from Lehman College (CUNY).  Annjanet did not stop there, she received her final degree, a Doctor of Education, from Fordham University.  Annjanet valued education.    Annjanet did this all while working full time and getting married in 1990 to the man that was captivated by her smile and skills…on the handball court, Noel A. Woodburn.  Yes, Noel was from Country, and he too migrated to the concrete jungle--I mean the Bronx.  We’ll talk about their union soon, first let’s concentrate on her jobs, she was a Jamaican woman, right?  Annjanet worked at Medgar Evers College, Lehman College (CUNY), and then became an Assistant Dean at Pace University.  Annjanet was a wonderful colleague and guide and she loved to mentor students, encouraging them to excel both socially and academically.  In 2014, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and she took a part-time position at the Westchester Community College and later at the Westchester Educational Opportunity Center.  Now, this diagnosis did not mean sad days or times for Annjanet; let’s go back to her marriage. Annjanet married Noel in 1990 and her family, which was once small and somewhat reserved, now became large, loud and loving.  Annjanet fit right in, Happy Saturday!  In 1992 Annjanet and Noel had their first child Brittany Noelle, the little girl they always wanted.  Happy Thursday!  Three years later Christopher Noel the precious son that they hoped for was born.  Happy Monday!  Now they had a perfect pair and as their fortunes increased they moved out of that concrete jungle to, you guessed it, the Country!  In February of 1996 they moved to Valley Cottage in Rockland County.  Happy Saturday!  There Annjanet excelled not only at work, raising a family, cooking (yes that lady could cook), going to restaurants (Cheesecake Factory anyone?) and eating chocolate.  Annjanet also joined St. Charles AME Zion Church and served as the President of the Board of the Valley Cottage Library; Annjanet loved to volunteer her services.  Happy days!   What happened to her friends you might ask?  Well she brought them all together at family picnics and barbeques; they traveled with her, and loved her.  In fact, on October 10, 2020, when Annjanet was struggling to breathe she was surrounded by her family and friends.  As more and more people came (socially distancing of course--we know we are in the midst of a COVID pandemic), and with Noel by her side all Annjanet could say was “Oh Boy!”  And as they carried Annjanet away she gave everyone a last glimpse of her big beautiful smile.  No, it was not a Happy Saturday, but we were all blessed to hear her speak, look into her soulful dark brown eyes, and feel the warmth of her smile.   Annjanet leaves to cherish her memories and spirit, her husband of 30 years, Noel; her beautiful daughter Brittany; and wonderful son, Christopher.  She is also survived by her mother, Loris Downie; her sister, Kerryann Jones-Grant; her brother, Alton Jones; her brother-in-laws: Barry Woodburn (Vinette), Danny Woodburn (Christina), Dale Woodburn (Marcia), Terry Woodburn (Zerlene), Wayne Woodburn (Lisa); her sister-in-law (Dianne Woodburn), and a host of aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, grandnieces, grandnephews, cousins and friends.  Annjanet is an inspiration to us all, let’s carry on her legacy.  Happy Friday!",
