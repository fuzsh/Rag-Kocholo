        "text": "Researching Virginians in the Williamsburg Area\n\nA Bibliography of Materials from the Rockefeller Library\n\nThe City of Williamsburg, established as Virginia's capitol in 1699 and incorporated in 1722, lies squarely on the boundary line between two counties, James City County and York County. Because many court records were destroyed during the Civil War, the amount of information on individuals who lived in this area depends largely on which county they resided in and when. Successful research will probably need to cover both counties.\n\nBefore 1722 Williamsburg city records were not kept separately from the counties, and legal issues were recorded in an individual's county of residence. A Hustings Court was set up when Williamsburg was incorporated, but the records of that court were burned during the Civil War.\n\nJames City County was one of the eight original counties created in 1634, and originally extended both north and south of the James River. Boundary changes since then include the formation of Surry County from James City County in 1652, the transfer of part of James City County to Charles City County in 1720, and a land swap with New Kent County in 1766. James City County has a history of significant record loss; all county court records were destroyed by fire in 1865.\n\nAlso one of Virginia's eight original counties, York County was originally named Charles River County in 1634. It was renamed York County in 1642/43. New counties formed out of York were Gloucester in 1651 and New Kent in 1654. York County's court records are intact from 1634, and are especially important to local research since all adjacent counties are \"burned counties\" with nearly complete court record loss.\n\nTherefore, with only the exceptions noted below, the early records of the City of Williamsburg are either well preserved (if on the York side of the boundary) or missing (if on the James City side). Research on James City County families is hindered by the loss of court records, but this may be compensated for by using the few remaining James City resources (such as land patents, church records, or tax lists), supplemented by the York County records. Research on York County families is easier; however, any surviving records from other counties should be used to form a more comprehensive picture.\n\nResources with information pertinent to James City and/or York County are listed below. They are grouped by record type.\n\nJames City and York Counties (combined)\n\nJames City County (only)\n\nYork County (only)\n\nJames City and York Counties (Combined)\n\nLand Records\n\nHistorical Research Reports for Colonial Williamsburg properties.
