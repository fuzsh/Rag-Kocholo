        "text": "Not only can tellers fit different periods into their story using a non-linear structure, but they can use temporally different angles to give additional insight into additional facets of the scenario. Opportunities for tragic or amusing irony arise when the reader knows more about the fate of the characters than the characters themselves (Breien and Wasson, 2021, p. 95). A storyline on the opposite end of the globe becomes an important or historical event affecting a character (Kukkakorpi and Pantti, 2021, p. 800). Therefore, raconteurs should learn more about world-building with this comprehensive guide. The more the reader learns about a subject’s past, the greater their comprehension of his or her decisions throughout the novel. Through non-linear narratives, the reader retains these experiences throughout the story (Cox-Stanton and Gibbs, 2021, p.11). Non-linear storytelling takes storytelling into the realm of art (Santos da Rosa, 2022, p. 15). Alternating between the main story and non-linear plots captures more of what it means to be human, shaping all the relationships that unite groups of people, even if they do not realize it.\n\nUsing linear narratives, narrators can maximize quality by completing the assignment with the fewest potential dubs. Most people believe nonlinear narratives to be more efficient, as they can start a project without a strategy (Azevedo and Almeida, 2021, p. 151). Numerous narrators believe that rearranging clips and audio files enable them to generate fresh ideas. Instantaneous playback allows users to decide whether or not to retain their existing sequence or to make modifications (Wang et al., 2021, p. 9). In addition to expanding people’s understanding and enhancing their nonlinear narration abilities, learning this technique can expand their information base (Lu et al., 2021, p. 225. Narrators can utilize nonlinear narratives to tell a more expansive version of the current story (Nash et al., 2023, p. 19). A nonlinear narrative, for instance, will not simply recount the chronological account of a single romance but will instead convey a story on the concept of romance. Often, a nonlinear narrative can be utilized by narrators to talk more broadly about an issue. Instead of focusing solely on the facts of what occurred in a tale, it will emphasize the why and how.\n\nCase Studies in Terms of Non-Linear Narrative Films\n\nLast Night in Soho\n\nLast Night in Soho, released in 2021 and perhaps the most recent film on this list, saw filmmaker Edgar Wright abandon the comedic qualities of his earlier films and create a sophisticated and thought-provoking horror film. Eventually, it becomes clear that it is telling two different stories connected somehow (Watkins, 2022). One is set in the present and follows a young woman who has relocated to London to study fashion at a prominent university. In contrast, the other is set in 1960s London and follows an aspiring dancer who seems to be followed by death and ruin. However, nothing is as it seems, and the audience keeps guessing until the end as we are pushed back to and from between these two narratives.\n\nLock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\n\nFrequently compared to Quentin Tarantino, Ritchie has directed several films with unconventional narrative structures. Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels may be the most audacious and best of these. Like Pulp Fiction, the audience is pushed back and forth between multiple interwoven scenarios, this time involving gangsters, deceptions, firearms, narcotics, and dogs (Watkins, 2022). It uses crash zooms, apparently involuntary camera situations, visual narrative, significant needle drops, and profanity-laced language.\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nWith good reason, Pulp Fiction is considered one of the best films of all time. Almost every part of the film is executed flawlessly, from the speech peppered with references from a pop culture still cited by cinema enthusiasts over 25 years later, to the non-linear, intertwining stories, to the ironic blend of humor and intense violence (Watkins, 2022). Even though this is due primarily to Quentin Tarantino and his distinct vision, it was only practical with one of the most outstanding ensembles of actors ever gathered.\n\nIrreversible\n\nIrreversible, a frightening and contentious tale of vengeance by Gasper Noe, is incredibly innovative in its use of nonlinear narrative. The film is told in reverse chronological sequence, with each scene occurring before the one that follows it. Behaviors and reactions are initially puzzling to the spectator. Still, as the film reveals more of the acts leading up to the occurrences, it gradually makes sense, leaving the audience anxious to learn more. The film begins with one of the most violent assaults ever performed on film. It is difficult to see what could justify such an attack (Watkins, 2022). As the audience learns more, a later-revealed incident will make the earlier attack look like child’s play as they comprehend its gut-wrenching motivations. This film will linger in the memory long after the closing credits (or opening credits) have rolled.\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nAnother film that is primarily viewed as one of the best made. Citizen Kane, released in 1941 and produced and starring Welles, covers an assessment of printing magnate Charles Foster Kane after disclosing his cryptic last words. The story is portrayed through a collection of flashbacks which are portrayed in a non-linear form and frequently overlap, as intermittent and incomplete facts of contradictory accounts of his scandalous life eventually emerge (Watkins, 2022). According to Rock music, despite receiving widespread praise and serving as one of the pioneers of non-linear narrative in film, the film could not recoup its production expenditures at the box office upon its initial release.\n\nNon-Linear Narrative Structure and how it Affects the Overall Viewership and Audience’s Reactions\n\nScreenwriters frequently utilize non-linear structures when introducing a character. A nonlinear analysis is one in which the relationship between applied forces and displacements is nonlinear (Chen et al., 2022, p. 170). The Non-linear structure of films enables filmmakers to reorder time in a manner that best fits the narrative. Character growth is one of the essential elements of a good television program. It is the impetus for the audience’s interest in the demonstration. Non-linear storytelling is a proper visual method for establishing a backstory, however. Not only can a non-linear story frame characters, it may also frame particular scenes.\n\nThe non-linear plot affects the overall viewership and audience’s reactions by facilitating the general comprehension of the story under coverage. This structure is a compelling narrative that contributes to establishing a consistent narrative of devotion and betrayal across the film’s timelines. For instance, the non-linear narrative structure of the aforementioned non-linear case studies permits the protagonists to comment on occurrences. This narrative activity is both powerful and captivating. It also contributes to establishing a consistent narrative of commitment and betrayal across the film’s periods. By confounding the audience, a complex structure produces a riddle that demands more significant interaction with the story’s component elements. Cause and consequence are no longer predictable or readily apparent, allowing readers to construct their reasoning. When a novel begins with a murder, subsequent events have greater weight and heighten anticipation for the (known) conclusion. When the audience knows more about the character’s fate than the character does, tragic or humorous irony opportunities develop.\n\nNot only can viewers use a non-linear framework to incorporate distinct periods into their story, but taking a temporarily different perspective can offer the reader the most understanding of other elements of the setting—for example, subplots emerging on the other side of the story that will ultimately become significant, or historical events that impact the lives of characters. The greater the reader’s knowledge of the character’s history, the greater their comprehension of the decisions they make during the story. Instead of merely stating that the character is an orphan, transport the reader back to when they became one. These experiences remain with the reader as the novel progresses. Nonlinear storytelling brings the narrative form closer to the realm of art. Instinctively, humans may be attracted to the tidiness of chronological sequence, yet they are charmed by the intricate. together, even when they are unaware of it.\n\nConclusion\n\nA nonlinear narrative will prevent speakers from employing nonlinear narratives for superficial reasons. Audiences can typically detect this, especially when the framework has become a standard storytelling device. Reporters should ensure that their use of a nonlinear narrative is intrinsically related to their story’s aim. They should ensure that a nonlinear narrative is connected to the story’s theme, which is a foolproof method for safeguarding their nonlinear narrative structure. If narrating the plot without it would leave relators without a central theme, they know their screenplay’s nonlinear structure is crucial. It is important to note that storytellers can employ non-linear narratives stylistically since they will reflect the mood and atmosphere of the film at hand.\n\nReference List\n\nAzevedo, A. and Almeida, A.H.
