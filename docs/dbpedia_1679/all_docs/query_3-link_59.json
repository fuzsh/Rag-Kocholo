        "text": "A non-linear story is a narrative technique in which the story is told out of chronological order. These types of stories are often thought to mimic the recall of human memory. They can be complex and tricky to get right but there are many methods and tropes you can use to make this technique successful. I have put together some articles and podcasts to help you understand the non-linear narrative technique and how you can apply it in your storytelling.\n\nhttps://www.masterclass.com/articles/non-linear-writing-tips-and-examples\n\nNon-linear narratives attempt to capture the choppy, fluid sensation of living. Masterclass shares examples of non-linear narratives in literature and explains 4 advantages of using such a narrative. Because a non-linear structure creates a puzzle that requires more engagement with the individual pieces of the story, it creates intrigue for the reader. The worldbuilding can be intensified by incorporating different time periods into your story or taking a momentarily different point of view, therefore, giving the reader more insight. Humans are enchanted by the complex. Interchanging the main plot with a no-linear plot allows you to capture more of what it means to be human.\n\nhttps://www.noblecopy.com/non-linear-story/\n\nThere is a complexity to non-linear narratives and this article from Noble Copy shares elements to include in your non-linear story. Probably the most common trope is the dream sequence either flashbacks or flashforwards. Sometimes flashbacks will appear on their own, not always in dream sequences. You can use flashbacks through bookends, incidents, and previews. All three are explained here. Parallel narratives in non-linear are interesting but they must run into each other during the story. The benefit of using parallel narratives is that the writer can delve into a particular storyline or character and build its world and depth so much that it feels like its own set story before it switches to another. This article also covers page structure and how to clearly inform the reader of time jumps. Using page breaks, white space, or titles as well as fashion, colours, and objects can all trigger the reader that a shift is coming.\n\nhttps://brilliantio.com/nonlinear-narrative-and-how-to-use-it-in-your-storytelling/\n\nUsing a non-linear narrative allows you to add depth to your story. This piece from Brilliantio discusses why non-linear storytelling works psychologically and emotionally. Because you create a bridge between the past and the future it creates a strong connection between your reader and your characters. It can be used to build suspense and thrill in your story, and use it to control and direct the reader’s attention. It also discusses the advantages of using a non-linear approach and shares examples of film and literature.\n\nhttps://www.masterclass.com/articles/guide-to-nonlinear-narrative\n\nThis article shares 3 tips for writing non-linear narratives. It advises you to use markers to indicate time change, and that it’s important to stay organised when bouncing between different timelines. Plotting your story structure, and both main and subplot points can help with this. Pay attention to the point of view and tenses. It often makes sense with a non-linear narrative to inhabit different perspectives by changing point of view and tense.\n\nhttps://becomeawritertoday.com/what-is-a-nonlinear-plot/\n\nThis article explains how to construct a non-linear plot and why you might want to use this type of narrative structure. There are multiple non-linear narrative patterns to choose from, such as retrogrades, zigzags, flashbacks, flashforwards, syllepsis, and achrony. It explains each one and then moves on to discuss reasons to use a non-linear plot.\n\nPODCASTS\n\nhttps://writingexcuses.com/2009/06/08/writing-excuses-season-3-episode-4-non-linear-story-telling/\n\nWhy do writers sometimes write out of order? This episode from the writing excuses podcast, explains why to do it, how to do it, and some common mistakes to avoid.\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/51-kelsey-beachum-on-writing-outer-wilds/id452692811?i=1000443731175\n\nThis podcast discusses writing non-linear stories, how to handle player agency and interactions, and mixing game mechanics with storytelling.\n\nhttp://www.fictionschool.com/time-flashbacks-jumps-nonlinear-plot-tricks-season-6-episode-1/\n\nFiction School talks about ways time leaps can help a story or make it look gimmicky, why character development matters more when time shifts, and ways that effective flashbacks and time jumps can surprise and engage a reader.\n\nUsing a non-linear narrative technique is certainly more complex yet it can make your story more rewarding for the reader.
