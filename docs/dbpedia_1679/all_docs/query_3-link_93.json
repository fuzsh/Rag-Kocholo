        "text": "Introduction The aims of this essay are to analyse the use, purpose and consequence of non l<strong>in</strong>ear narrative <strong>in</strong> film. The research compiled <strong>in</strong> this essay from books, journals and textual analyses should illustrate the effectiveness of non l<strong>in</strong>ear structure <strong>in</strong> film. Structure <strong>in</strong> narrative film can be thought of as the arrangement of scenes and sequences, however deconstruct<strong>in</strong>g sequences and re-order<strong>in</strong>g them can create a whole new theme and mood <strong>in</strong> a films sequence (Phillips 2005, p.150). It can effect character relations <strong>in</strong> a film, it can affect the role of the audience throughout a film and also can give film scenes more purpose for example <strong>in</strong> Citizen Kane (1941) the film beg<strong>in</strong>s with the death of the ma<strong>in</strong> character and then tells his life through flashbacks <strong>in</strong>tercut with a journalists present-time <strong>in</strong>vestigation of Kane’s life and his f<strong>in</strong>al dy<strong>in</strong>g word “Rosebud” (figure 1). Simple narratology states that a narrative plot is supposed to have a beg<strong>in</strong>n<strong>in</strong>g, middle and an end. However non l<strong>in</strong>ear narrative has the power to re-model a films plot and create a new beg<strong>in</strong>n<strong>in</strong>g, middle and end. Fabula and sujet are terms that describe narrative construction. Sujet is the employment of narrative and fabula is the order of retell<strong>in</strong>g events, so the fabula of a text is the raw order <strong>in</strong> which events occurred, while sujet is def<strong>in</strong>ed as the way <strong>in</strong> which these events are depicted and reshaped <strong>in</strong> their deployment (Phillips 2005 p.272). <strong>Narrative</strong> structure and plot <strong>in</strong> film can be quite restrict<strong>in</strong>g and sometimes non l<strong>in</strong>ear narrative liberates the text. Very much like <strong>in</strong> novels when an author can launch a back-story to a character at 1 Figure 1 (Instead of a cigarette – still). “Rosebud”; the last dy<strong>in</strong>g word of Charles Foster Kane."
