        "text": "Reading Time: 5 minutes\n\nFinding ways to move a film’s narrative forward can be challenging. Filmmakers will often employ the usage of Plot Devices to aid in the story’s progression.\n\nA plot device can take many forms. However, at its core they are common storytelling mechanics to advance the plot. At times these tropes run the risk of feeling cliché if it feels too forced at its occurrences in the story.\n\nHowever, if the filmmakers can find ways in which the plot device can occur organically within the story’s characters, setting, and events, they can be powerful tools that may go undetected by the viewer.\n\nThere are many plot device concepts that exist, but these are a few worth mentioning.\n\nMacGuffin\n\nA MacGuffin is one of the most popular plot devices, often associated with Alfred Hitchcock in coining the term. In storytelling, it helps to establish an objective that motivates the main character to move forward within the story. It is typically an item, person, or goal to obtain. However, one can later discover in the story that this “goal” is irrelevant and that there is a deeper objective for our protagonist.\n\nA great way to figure out if a protagonist’s objective is a MacGuffin is to imagine replacing the “objective” with something else.\n\nWould it be the same story?\n\nIf so, then the objective established at first is a MacGuffin.\n\nRed Herring\n\nA Red Herring is a type of narrative misdirection that presents the audience with a misleading or false clue. It is commonly popular in film genres such as mystery or thrillers. Through this technique the audience tries to guess the outcome. They mentally engage in the storytelling culminating in what is hopefully a rewarding surprise at the reveal.\n\nTicking Clock\n\nSometimes also nicknamed the Ticking Time Bomb, a Ticking Clock is a common story trope. It helps to increase the stakes and tension for the main character to meet their goal by a specific time. This can also help the audience to become more actively and emotionally involved in the story. This is because they become concerned over whether or not the protagonist will beat the clock.\n\nThe ticking clock is usually established early on within the film. The main character learns they have a limited time to reach their goal. That can be be finding authentic tortillas in an hour or saving the world from an asteroid in 24 hours. No matter how the ticking clock is set up, it is one of the plot devices that regularly works to create a sense of urgency.\n\nDeus ex Machina\n\nLatin for “god from the machine” Deus ex Machina is when a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and unexpectedly resolved with an easy solution by an unlikely occurrence. Many times this method of storytelling can feel too convenient, overly simplistic, and unrewarding to the audience.\n\nIn Medias Res\n\nAnother frequently used latin phrase, In Media Res, meaning “into the midst of things” is one of the plot devices that causes the audience to start in the middle of the plot or action.\n\nThis can be a creative way to engage your audience in becoming an active participant in piecing together the film’s narrative. This non-linear technique leads the audience to question how the character or characters found themselves in this situation.\n\nThis is a useful technique to energize the start of your film. Also, it can be used to hook the audience with curiosity or questions before you begin setting up the film’s exposition.\n\nCliffhanger\n\nA Cliffhanger occurs when the story ends in an intriguing abrupt manner. It can be sometimes at the end of a sequence or episode, often with the protagonist or featured character(s) left in a difficult situation that may seem unsolvable. This device is frequently used in television and various episodic media formats where you want to leave the audience with a compelling question about the story’s resolution. That will get them to return to the next installment in the series.\n\nPlot Voucher\n\nThe Plot Voucher is the antithesis of a Red Herring. This is a character or object that is introduced early on in the film in which its set-up will pay-off later in the story.\n\nThis compliments a related writing concept known as Chekhov’s Gun derived from the writings of playwright Anton Chekhov. In one of his writings, he states,” If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don’t put it there.” In essence, every story element presented to the audience must serve a purpose. Irrelevant elements should be removed."
