        "text": "Non-linear Narrative in Romantic Comedies\n\nRomantic comedies can be defined by a series of well known characteristics; there is usually a meet cute by two different yet not incompatible people, a variety of events that strive to keep them apart, and a comic resolution in which the couple are finally brought together. A classic example of this would be Breakfast at Tiffany’s, which diverting from the events of the source material, ends up with the two main characters together, kissing in the rain. At the heart of a classic romantic comedy, which can be seen in both television and film, is the ideal that love can triumph all, despite differences in class or temperament. For examples, Charlie Chaplin’s tramp in City Lights and Modern Times, although economically barren and apparently sexless, wins the girl through hard work and determination. What this essay seeks to explore is the ways in which screenplays subvert this well known framework through non-linear narrative in order to make statements upon the way memory works and desire finds its apotheosis through narrative structuring. The contention of this essay is that through the use of non-linear narrative, the conventional norms of the genre are brought under question, bringing forward a more subjective view of human nature. This moves away from mimetic representation towards a fragmented and diagetic exploration of subjective experience. This shows the combination between hollywood cinema and a more art-house approach, showing the influence of European auteurs such as Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman. All three screenplays, to some extent, work on the assumption that the viewer has a rough understanding of romantic comedy structure in order to see where the subversion begins; much in the same way that a basic understanding of film noir is needed to understand a film such as Robert Altman’s The Long Goodbye, or a basic knowledge of the gangster genre is needed to understand Pulp Fiction. This essay shall employ a structuralist reading of screenplays that reads them in relation to one another and to the larger concerns of the genre.\n\nIn “Desire and Narrativity in Annie Hall”, Sam B. Girgus note Barthes influence on film theory. He writes that the “theory of the fusion of desire and narrativity has become central for many critics and students of literature and cinema, especially those who tend to emphasize the connection between semiotics and psychoanalysis” (Girgus, 44). He cites Teresa de Lauretis’ accurate contention that “The work of a narrative, then, is a mapping of differences, and specifically, first and foremost, of sexual difference into each text” (Laurentis, 121). Annie Hall starts with a monologue (inspired both by Allen’s beginnings as a stand up comic, and the influence of Bob Hope and Groucho Marx) towards the audience. This breaks the fourth wall, and introduces us into the world as Alvy Singer sees it. As Allen mentions in Woody Allen on Woody Allen, “I wanted the audience to experience this with me” (Bjorkman, 82). He paraphrases from “Freud's wit and its relation to the unconscious”: “I would never wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member” (Allen, 1). This frames the narrative through psychoanalytic terms; through his own lack of self-worth as a person his ability to form lasting relationships has been impaired. Narrative suspension is destroyed early on when he tells us that “Annie and I broke up and I-I still can’t get my mind around that” (Allen, 1). We are told straight away that not only does this story not have a comic resolution, but that narrative closure has not been achieved. Then we move to Alvy as a child, starting a “sequence of scenes that thrusts a radical dislocation of chronological order on us” (Jacobs, 45). In literary terms, what is being achieved is a filmic stream-of-consciousness as the narrator seeks to find the answers to why his love life has failed. As Roger Ebert points out in his review of (500) Days Of Summer, “We never remember in chronological order, especially when we’re going back over a failed romance.” The scenes of his childhood are vital to narrative as ‘The boy who kisses outraged little girls... is Freudian ancestor to a sexually and otherwise confused adult who has “some trouble [differentiating] between fantasy and reality”’(Jacobs, 105).\n\nSimilar scenes occur at the start of (500) Days, this time employing the use of an extradiagetic narrator, who helps to mediate the space between Tom’s fantasy and the reality that surrounds him. The story begins near the end, with Tom and Summer sitting on a park bench- Summer wearing a wedding ring- as the narrator tells us, “This is a story of boy meets girl” (Neustadter & Weber, 1). The narration is purposefully contrived, and Tom’s ambitions clearly established from when he was a child, his belief that his life will not be satisfied until he has met the one. This has “stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total misreading of the movie, “The Graduate”” (Neustadter & Weber, 1). Like Alvy Singer, he has a “hyperactive imagination”; he is awash in signifiers that give him an unrealistic view of the world around him. The narrator subsequently establishes the love interest Summer as a girl who doesn’t believe in love after experiencing the harsh reality of her parents divorce. This creates the conflict that remains throughout the screenplay. We are told “up front, this is not a love story” (Neustadter & Weber, 3) before the title sequence starts. This postmodern statement frames the film in much the same way Annie Hall does, by imposing through diagesis what we are to experience mimetically. What is on offer here, is a film that “displays an earnest desire to challenge the codes and conventions of the romantic comedy genre in order to tell a more truthful story about romance” (Ryan). It can be argued that, just in the way that Annie Hall uses stream-of-consciousness to process how the relationship went wrong, (500) Days uses third indirect person in order to get inside Tom’s mind as he ciphers through his failed relationship. The narrator does talk about Summer’s feelings but we are giving the overall impression that she is essentially unknowable. The casting in the final film helps to illuminate that idea. Summer is played by Zooey Deschanel who, according to Roger Ebert, “evokes that ability in some women to madden you with admiration while never seeming to give it the slightest thought”. For Tom however, we see his inner conflict through a series of non-naturalistic techniques such as the musical sequence scored to Hall & Oates, “You Make My Dreams Come True.” Like Annie Hall, the conflict here is the unresolvable difference between fantasy and reality, and the narrative technique, which in both films moves from childhood to adulthood, and which swiftly juxtaposes the positive times and the negative, reflects the protagonists failed desire to match the two together. Therefore, whilst on the surface the structure is comic, their inability to overcome their flaws shows a more tragic strain emerging.\n\nClassifying genre in Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind is more problematic than simply seeing it through the lens of romantic comedy, and what propels the narrative is different from the other two screenplays. In Joel’s mental race to fight back against the technology that is destroying his memories of Clementine, the film also inhabits the science-fiction/thriller genre, as it takes on the classic theme of man versus machines. However, despite this, its concerns are still largely romantic. As Yugin Teo correctly notes, Eternal Sunshine is “less concerned with the details of technology used in manipulating memory and more preoccupied with the emotional and psychological blurring of the distinctions between remembering and forgetting” (Teo, 350). Additionally, despite not being as overtly comic as Annie Hall or (500) Days, with their obvious visual and verbal gags, its ending resolves the film as a comedy, with the possibility that love can triumph regardless of its obstacles, in this case a tenuous past as revealed through the leaked cassettes, and the attempts by Lucana Inc. to wipe Joel’s memories away.\n\nThe conceit of Eternal Sunshine, which involves Joel being hooked up to a machine that works through and clears his memories of Clementine in reverse, possibly showing the influence of Christopher Nolan’s Memento, reveals a strong relationship between narrativity and desire. The first scene of the movie shows Joel as he “breaks out of the crowd, lurches up the stairs two at a time, hurries across the overpass and down the stairs to the other side, just as the empty train stops. The doors open and the man gets on that train” (Kaufman, 1). He doesn’t know why he has done this, and neither does the viewer, thus creating narrative suspense in a way unlike the other two screenplays. He sees Clementine at a beach in Montauk, for what he believes is the first time, and she talks to him on the train. What we don’t know is that this scene comes near the end of the story, but by situating it at the start of the plot, this sets up an attachment to place that is to be realised when these scenes are repeated at the end. We come back to the house near the end of the plot, as Joel’s last memory of Clementine is being erased. But in fact a residue remains that cannot be destroyed, thus proving once again that love can ultimately triumph, and that the will of man can defeat the power of technology, thus completing both the requirements of classic science-fiction and romantic comedy genres. The fact it takes place on a beach is symbolically apt, as grains of sand still remain of what was once a rock. The use of non-linear narrative shows the “meet cute” near the end, with important parts from the beginning repeated but in altered forms, such as Joel singing “oh my darlin’, Clementine” (Kaufman, 139) instead of not knowing the song. When Joel and Clementine finally realise they have been together before but decide to try again despite their first relationship ending in failure this reveals a different approach to narrativity and desire than the other two screenplays. Instead of the narrative form reflecting the protagonists ultimately flawed desire to achieve some kind of closure, the narrative of Eternal Sunshine, shows a desire not for closure, but for the possibility to create new narratives together. This is illustrated in the title taken from the Alexander Pope poem Eloisa to Abelard. This is helpfully spelled out for us by Mary: “Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted, and, each wish resign’d”. Wiping the slate clean gives them the opportunity to start again. Although, we do not know Joel and Clementine’s fate after the credits roll, their desire to start again despite knowing that they will find issues with each other eventually shows a mature yet optimistic view of relationships that is eventually stronger than Annie Hall or (500) Days without falling into over-tread or cliched territory. The irony is, by not remembering how the relationship disintegrated, Joel and Clementine are given the rare chance to start again, whilst in the other two screenplays, another attempt at a relationship is flawed as the memories of the previous attempt will always be there as a constant reminder of what didn’t work.\n\nThis leads us unto gender construction in the three screenplays, and most significantly, the essentialisation of the female as both mysterious and unknowable. What gives Eternal Sunshine the most positive ending is that both sides are willing to try again, whilst in the other two screenplays, it is the male harking after a connection that in the long run isn’t there. Annie Hall, although praised for its complex female characterisation, suitably acted in the finished film by Diane Keaton (who won an Academy role for her role), is still a film about the male gaze. This is symbolized by the visual gag where “As Annie speaks, her inner self (ghostlike, moves up from the bed and) sits down on a chair, watching” (Allen, 72). By symbolizing Annie’s movements as ghostlike, he finds the mimetic representation of what he wants to say about their lackluster sex life. This is part of the non-linear narrative, as in the story of what really happened, her ghost did not actually leave her body, but this is how Alvy chooses in retrospect to represent it. The ghostlike representation is an essentialisation of the female, and shows the narrators immature view of woman. This is also true of (500) Days, in which juxtaposed scenes from days (238) and (31) show Tom treating Summer as a fixed entity and not as a real person with shifting emotions. The scene takes place in an IKEA, which works as a suitable metaphor for their relationship, as it is the simulacrum of a domestic scene, and not a real one. The latter scene is shown first in which Tom jokingly telling Summer her sink is broken is surprised by her reaction to tell him to stop it. The next scene, told two hundred days earlier in their relationship, shows why he is surprised, in which they happily play out the roles of a domesticated couple. This juxtaposition of scenes is effective because it displays Tom’s inability to realise that Summer is a real person with shifting moods, and not an unchanging platonic ideal, and this is achieved through the non-linear structure. By playing the first time in the story after the second time, this reveals Tom’s desire to go back to that first time, which has been lost. Therefore in both screenplays, what we see is a male gaze that in both cases eschews reality in order to essentialise women as unknowable, and deny them true complexity. They both seem to embody what Nathan Rabin has defined as a Manic Pixie Dream Girl: \"that bubbly, shallow cinematic creature that exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures\". But as Eva Wiseman points out, and the same could apply to Annie Hall, “While Deschanel's Summer is as whimsical as a traditional MPDG, the character rises above the cliche through her flaws” (Wiseman, 11).\n\nEternal Sunshine shows Clementine clearly not wanting to be pinned down as embodying that type: “Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours” (Kaufman, 96). Embodied in this speech is a reference to Jerry Maguire, a Hollywood romantic comedy, in which the titular character realises that the most important thing in his life isn’t his career as a sport agent, but his love interest Dorothy, who has supported him throughout. In his speech at the end her tells her that “you complete me” and the two of them are reconciled. This speech shows that Kaufman wants to reject the idealisation of women in film, and instead show that women are not concepts but individuals with their own problems and desires. Clementine repeats a portion of this speech at the end of the film, despite her memory of saying it before is erased. This shows that despite the narrative being wiped, how you want to be seen is an essential part of who you are. Clementine tells Joel that he will find things he doesn’t like about her, and that she will get bored of him. His “okay” (Kaufman, 129) at the end of the screenplay is a pledge to be with her regardless of the fact that she is not a concept, thus again going beyond the other two screenplays by affirming romantic relationships despite their dysfunctionality and the fact that she is not perfect. By reversing the male gaze, the possibility for functionality is maintained. The desire for narrative closure, revealed through the way the narrative is told in both (500) Days and Annie Hall, shows that by trying to pin down woman as fixed concepts relationships are destroyed, yet the ability to accept them for who they actually are creates the chance for a lasting romance. Therefore we can see that the desire for narrative closure contains an implicit denial of reality that uses non-linear narrative in order to represent this fantastical view of events. In the case of Eternal Sunshine, the desire shifts towards a more balanced view of relationships that leaves the narrative open, and creates the possibility for a happy ending.\n\nThis denial of reality, and the way memories affect narrative in all three screenplays betray the influence of European art-house cinema such as Bergman and Fellini. The influence of Ingmar Bergman upon Woody Allen has been substantial, and Annie Hall was his first attempt to make a more philosophical movie which says something serious about the human condition than his previous, more farcical movies. This can be seen right from the opening credits, which in their absence of music, show a more serious approach. Allen mention that “I remember Bergman never used music, and I was so taken with his film-making in those days” (Bjorkman, 76). Bergmanesque techniques are later used to affect the narrative, as in the sequence when Annie and Alvy literally walk into Alvy’s past to observe his parents bickering: “Annie, adult Alvy and Rob quietly walk into the scene to watch” (Allen, 105). This is borrowed from Bergman’s Wild Strawberries in which the main character, revisiting his family home, suddenly finds himself walking into his own childhood, and reliving moments from his past. This meta-theatrical technique, which allows the viewer to see the protagonists memories and the protagonist experiencing those memories at the same time, allows us to immerse ourselves and identify with the protagonist in a more effective way than simply using a normal flashback. As Alvy steps into the scene and tells his bickering parents that they are “both crazy” (Allen, 106) an extra layer of pathos is created, and shows the ways that over time, wounds afflicted as a child can still leave scars throughout adulthood. Rob, Alvy’s best friend, tells him that “they can’t hear you” (Allen, 106) thus through the present situation informing the viewer that we are unable to change our past. This scene, which through its visual borrowings from Bergman, shows Alvy’s desire to intervene in his parents arguments in order to change his future, and the ultimate fact that this desire cannot be achieved. This foreshadows his failed attempts of closure with Annie and shows a Freudian link between childhood and adulthood, with Annie standing in as the surrogate Oedipal figure. This is notable in one scene when Alvy decides that he can miss his psychoanalysis in order to spend time with Annie. Therefore, the influence of Bergman is essential to Allen's creation of non-linear narrative as his techniques are borrowed in order to strengthen the psychological depth of his protagonist Alvy Singer, and his flawed desire to change his past narratives.\n\nIn contrast to Annie Hall, the use of childhood memories alters the direction of the plot in Eternal Sunshine. Clementine asks Joel to take him somewhere that she doesn’t know about, and like in Annie Hall and in Wild Strawberries they are able to insert themselves into Joel’s past narratives. This is given a more surrealist bent when Joel’s mother’s neighbor “has Clementine’s face” (Kaufman, 68), and Joel occupies the body of his seven year old self. The Oedipal links here are clearly evident when Joel as a baby cried that he wants mommy, and by way of comfort Clementine “lifts her skirt to reveal the underwear from the previous scene” (Kaufman, 69). This tactic works and the machine designed to wipe away Joel’s memories temporarily stops. By going back and satisfying Oedipal desire as a child, Joel’s chances of influencing his future is increased. This shows Eternal Sunshine taking a more important stance towards the use on non-linear narrative in order to influence its main protagonists future. This, it could be argued, is possibly due to the genre-bending form that the movie takes, in which art-house cinema is not only combined with the romantic comedy, but also with the science-fiction genre, which allows imaginative possibilities that go beyond the more ‘realistic’ (in terms of its pessimistic view of human nature) reflection of reality shown in Annie Hall.\n\n(500) Days, although it does contain a parody of Bergman’s Persona, betrays more Felliniesque characteristics in its use of non-linear narrative. A film that is Felliniesque is one that is \"synonymous with any kind of extravagant, fanciful, even baroque image in the cinema and in art in general\" (Bondanella, 7). In Federico Fellini films such as 8 1/2, we are shown a world in which dreams and reality coexist. Fellini says in Fellini on Fellini that “I see no dividing line between imagination and reality’ (150, Fellini) and in (500) Days we can see the same truism applying to its protagonist, most notably in the films musical sequence which extravagantly blurs the two. It uses non-naturalistic techniques such as heavily choreographed dancing in the street, and a cartoon bird flying onto Tom’s shoulder. This is Felliniesque because of its use of extravagant gestures and the way in which the sequence unfolds in a fantastical way, replete with an entire brass band. In his directors commentary, Mark Webb notes the use of colour in the finished sequence. He says that this is the only sequence in the film that makes use of the colour blue, which symbolizes Summer when she is not around. This would lead one to conclude that this fantasy of Tom’s is part-memory, as he aggrandizes the success of his first time sleeping with Summer by replaying it in his head with even larger embellishments permeated by her symbolic presence. This is in direct contrast to his real life, in which she is absent. The shows through non-linear narrative Tom’s desire for closure by going back to the time in the relationship where the true romance was still alive. This, I would argue. is a fleeting Felliniesque gesture. As Roger Ebert notes: “Tom spends this movie in the emotional quandary of Mastroianni in \"La Dolce Vita,\" his hand always outstretched toward his inaccessible fantasies.”\n\nDespite not being able to sate his desire for Summer, Tom, as the screenplay puts it, “Gets his shit together” (Neustadter & Weber, 99) and manages to land an interview for an architectural firm. It is whilst waiting for this interview that he meets Autumn, and the next chapter of his life begins. It is notable that this decision to turn his life around and pursue his artistic dream occurs after a flashback towards day (240). This is significant because we have already been told how this day occurs, on page 5 of the screenplay. In the earlier version of events we are told in mundane terms what happened to them, such as going shopping, drinking coffee and watching a movie. Later that same day Summer breaks up with Tom, and he doesn’t understand why, portraying her as unreasonably mean. But when the screenplay revisits that same day, and views it honestly, we see the signs of a relationship breaking apart. She lags behind him when they are shopping, cries after seeing the movie, and moves her hand away from him when he goes to take it. By showing the same scene twice at the beginning and end of the screenplay, shows the way that non-linear narrative can be used to reflect personal character development. Once Tom stops denying reality, he is allowed to progress, and so the movie shifts towards a different ending than the stereotypical romantic comedy, in which the protagonist realises a different dream, which is to pursue his architectural career. At the interview he meets Autumn, and upon finding out her name stares into the camera and smiles, breaking the fourth wall, letting the viewer know that he is over Summer and onto the next chapter in his life. The title card goes back to (1) which shows a view of love as cyclical, and each substantial romantic partner in it as a movie in their own right. Therefore we can see that through the use of non-linear narrative that replays the same day but with different events occurring that being able to finally distinguish between reality and imagination is the key to letting go and moving forward. Therefore, whilst non-linear narrative can reflect the protagonists desire for closure by re-imagining reality, it can also be a way of finally piecing together the truth. Whilst this hasn’t given Tom the chance for narrative closure with Summer, it has allowed him to finally face the truth, and get on with his own life.\n\nThe same ability to move on is not true of Annie Hall, in which the same scenes are also replayed more than once. Alvy confronts Annie in Los Angeles and she rejects him, telling him that he is “incapable of enjoying life” (Allen, 143). When this scene is repeated again, it is during Alvy’s first play, in which actors are playing him and Annie. Alvy re-imagines the scene as he would’ve liked it to have gone:\n\nACTRESS Wait! I'm-I'm gonna... go with you.\n\n(The actor comes back. They embrace)\n\nI love you.\n\n(Allen, 149)\n\nAlvy cannot get over Annie, and tells the audience that “you know how you're always tryin' t' get things to come out perfect in art because, uh, it's real difficult in life” (Allen, 99). This can be seen by the way he uses montage in order to impose a definitive meaning on a fractured relationship. This montage is scored to Annie’s singing of “Seems Like Old Times” and this shows Alvy’s desire for their relationship to be back together, which he can only try to attempt through the artistic organisation of their relationship. The final scene however, is not one of togetherness, but of absence, shot through a cafe window: “Alvy and Annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like. Annie crosses the street, Alvy watching her go. Then he turns, and slowly walks down the street off screen” (Allen, 151). The perspective of this long shot, which suggests they are being watched by a random person in a cafe, decreases the intimacy between the couple, and by walking off the screen, they both walk out of each other’s lives. This shot is in direct contrast to Alvy’s desire to achieve closure in the relationship. The film ends with a joke delivered by voiceover. This joke about needing the eggs is a poignant one that speaks about Alvy’s view of relationships, and shows that although he hasn’t gotten over Annie, he leaves with a bittersweet view of his failed relationship. Even though his one true love has gotten away from him, he isn’t bitter about it, spinning a positive message about an ultimately unfulfilled relationship. Through the use of non-linear narrative, in which Alvy is able to talk about the events in the past through his final voiceover, we can see that although the desire for narrative closure hasn’t been fulfilled, the experience of being in a relationship with Annie was ultimately worth the heartache. This is similar to (500) Days in which the romantic comedy structure is used as a learning curve for the protagonist to develop as a person. Therefore, despite not adhering to the cliche of love triumphing all, an important lesson about personal progress has been learnt.\n\nIn conclusion, we can see that non-linear narrative is not just a way of presenting narrative in an unusual way, but a creative way of matching up a screenplays form with its message. Through a close analysis of genre this essay has proven to demonstrate the ways in which non-linear narrative is closely linked to the protagonists desire for closure, and the ways in which this closure is either denied or achieved. All three screenplays, whilst inhabiting the romantic comedy genre, arguably move beyond genre in order to make personal statements on issues such as gender, memory, and desire. What non-linear narrative achieves is a more perceptive look at romantic relationships through the prism of subjective experience, which rejects conventional norms and seeks to reflect human nature as infinitely more problematic and complicated than a linear narrative could achieve. Therefore it is clear that non-linear narrative is an innovative and essential part of achieving a complex and mature view of love and relationships."
