        "text": "Non-linear narrative structures are ways of telling stories that do not follow a chronological or causal order. Instead, they use techniques such as flashbacks, flash-forwards, parallel timelines, multiple perspectives, or circular loops to create complex and engaging plots. Animation is a medium that can explore non-linear narratives in creative and innovative ways, as it can manipulate time, space, and reality with visual and auditory effects. In this article, we will look at some examples of non-linear narrative structures used in animation, and how they enhance the themes and messages of the stories.\n\nRate this article\n\nWe created this article with the help of AI.
