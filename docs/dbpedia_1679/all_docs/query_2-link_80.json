Interrupted by Pumpkin and Honey Bunny robbery beat — same as the end of Scene 1, only from Jules and Vincent’s POV, this time played out to the movie’s finale.\n\nDATE: MONDAY (CONTINUOUS)\n\nANALYSIS\n\n1. The movie begins and ends with the Coffee Shop scene; it is the only time we see Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.\n\n2. We do not know until the very end of the movie, when Jules (p. 155) refers to the business about retrieving the black briefcase “this morning,” that the opening scene occurs on our Monday dateline.\n\n3. The story takes place over the course of four days, Monday through Thursday.\n\n4. There are two scenes which are played out, then replayed from a different POV: Scene 1 (Pumpkin and Honey Bunny) and Scene 24, and the very end of Scenes 2 (Jules and Vincent) and Scene 19 (The Fourth Man).\n\n5. At the end of the movie, Vincent is alive. Of course, this is Monday; he ends up dying at the hands of Butch on Thursday (Scene 15, p. 96).\n\n6. The script is comprised of several substories strung together: Jules and Vincent, Vincent and Mia, Butch and Fabian, Butch and Marsellus.\n\nThere is much more we could discuss about this inventive script, but for purposes of this lecture’s subject matter, let’s go directly to the heart of the matter:\n\nWhy tell the story in a non-linear style?\n\nI have thought about this quite a bit. The first time I saw Pulp Fiction, I thought Tarantino had gone the nonlinear route because it was stylistically cool. And indeed, it is cool. Arguably, this movie spawned an entire wave of cinematic storytelling, everything from end-scenes placed up front movies (The Usual Suspects), movies which employ occasional nonlinear storytelling elements (Out of Sight) to movies whose plot is told in reverse (Memento).\n\nBut after reading the script several times, I have come to the conclusion that Tarantino, whether he intended it or not, hit upon nonlinearity as the only way he could tell one particular storyline in the script, the tale which comprises the ‘moral’ center of the movie, the story around which the screenplay’s Themeline revolves. That story involves the fates of Jules and Vincent.\n\nTarantino goes to great lengths up front, enormous gobs of seemingly inane dialogue (p. 7–17), to establish Jules and Vincent as sort of philosopher-goofballs, whose vocation, as it happens, is to whack people. So Tarantino has set us up to anticipate yet another post-modern ironic take on violence, the breakdown of society, blah blah blah.\n\nBut what is really going on, in my opinion, is far more traditional: A tale about morality and humanity, one guy who finds it (Jules), and one guy who does not (Vincent). The guy who finds it, lives. The guy who does not, dies.\n\nLook at it this way: Jules and Vincent are co-Protagonists. Both are confronted by the same story-turning event, the Fourth Man shoot-‘em-up (which coincidentally happens on page 26, smack in the middle of the traditional end of Act One Plotline point). Against all odds and logic, both men survive without a scratch.\n\nJules is convinced this is a miracle (“We just witnessed a miracle!” — p. 115), but Vincent denies it, choosing to see the incident as “a freak, but it happens.”\n\nJules is moved by the event to decide to change his lifestyle (“That’s it for me. From now on in, you can consider my ass retired.” — p. 116), while Vincent is convinced that Jules is “freakin’ out.”\n\nThe fact that one of them chooses to change and the other doesn’t — that is the reason the non-linear approach to telling the story works.\n\nAgain, whether Tarantino intended it or not, by presenting the story’s seminal moment up front, then moving forward in time to see how Vincent handles the event (no change in attitude) and his resulting death, underscores the importance of the story’s other significant moment, one which plays directly to the script’s Themeline.\n\nOn P. 152, back in the coffee shop where we began, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny have drawn their weapons, and are going about rousting people, pulling off their twitchy robbery. Eventually, they come upon Jules sitting calmly at his booth, wearing his absurd “I’m With Stupid” T-shirt (Vincent happens to be off in the bathroom, a second time his gastro-intestinal timing impacts the plot, his other visit to a bathroom resulting in his untimely death). Pumpkin has his gun trained on Jules, unaware that Jules has his own gun drawn out of sight beneath the table.\n\nNow Jules is faced with the script’s big choice: He could easily blow away Pumpkin, an act which would in effect renounce his recent determination to live a different (moral) life; or he could try another, more peaceful tact.\n\nTarantino literally presents two potential futures: The first is Jules killing Pumpkin; the second is Jules talking his way through the situation, going so far as to give up his own hard-earned cash to the robbers, allowing them to go free (when Vincent returns from the john, he demonstrates that he still does not ‘get’ where Jules is coming from — “Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred bucks, I’m gonna shoot ’em on general principle.”)\n\nThe movie ends with the second future ‘winning’ out — Pumpkin and Honey Bunny do not die and make off with the cash they have thieved, followed by Jules and Vincent who wordlessly shuffle out of the joint, heading off toward their respective fates.\n\nBottom line, you, the writer, could not introduce Jules and Vincent in the coffee shop on p. 8 in the middle of a robbery and expect the reader to have any understanding of what the moral dilemma is, what the symbolic lay of the land is, what your thematic point is. No, in order to understand what is at stake in this key moment, the reader needs to know more. Otherwise, the impact of Jules’ transformation would be utterly minimized.\n\nWhat works so beautifully with the nonlinear approach to Pulp Fiction is that:\n\n* We get a chance to witness the opening shoot-out and wonder how it has anything to do with anything else for 141 pages — until we finally see it pay off.\n\n* We get a chance to meet Jules and see the ingrained violence of his world, setting the bar especially high for him to change.\n\n* We get a chance to live with the Fourth Man’s stunned expression after he unloads his .357 to no effect and his pursuant comment, “I don’t understand,” knowing that something odd took place at the end of that scene; again how will this pay off?\n\n* We get a chance to live with Vincent who doesn’t show a depth of soul akin to Jules (and ends up dying for his lack of human potentiality).\n\n* We get a chance to see another tortured soul with a choice, Butch, who makes the right decision (dignity in refusing to throw the fight), then makes another and even harder choice (goes back to help save Marsellus, the guy who wants him dead), but whose ‘moral’ decisions result in earning him his ‘freedom’ and the ability to live a new life.\n\nAll that story material, so when we rejoin the Jules’ storyline, we ‘get’ Tarantino’s moral landscape. When Jules has his life-altering confrontation with Pumpkin, and a single twitch of a finger could turn their little world into an instant bloodbath, we buy the meaning of the last words Jules says to the nervous robber, “The truth is you’re the weak. And I’m the tyranny of evil men. But I’m tryin’. I’m tryin’ real hard to be a shepherd.”\n\nIn sum, Pulp Fiction is a great example of nonlinear storytelling because it serves the story."
