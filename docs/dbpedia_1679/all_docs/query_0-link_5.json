        "text": "branching-narrative would be a good tag and we should create it\n\nThe reasons are already stated in the question, I just want to point out a few things.\n\nA branching storyline doesn't necessarily mean that we are talking about a videogame, because for example gamebooks (\"Choose Your Own Adventure\"-style books) would deal with this issue, too, and while these could be videogames when using for example a website to play them, such as ChoiceOfGames.com, you could just as well have a printed book like the \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books. In this case the tag name game would be more appropriate, but game would probably include other things. Imagine you were supposed to write the backstory or rules for a board- or cardgame. The focus of a game tag would probably be on other aspects than the specific issue of dealing with branching storylines that you as the writer have to deal with.\n\nThe alternatives branching and nonlinear strike me as not really telling the user what they are about. With branching-narrative we would have a tag that would tell the reader that it's about issues a writer might have with the narrative without even looking at the tag wiki. Otherwise someone might ask themselves whether these tags are for example used when asking about processes or approaches to writing, such as when asking whether you should work on one piece of writing at a time or on multiple pieces at a time, or multiple slightly different versions of the same book at a time - a nonlinear approach where you are skipping between worlds and having branched drafts that you are working on.\n\nOr people might think that \"branching\" is about \"branching out\" to get some new experience in a different field, such as in the question How can I freelance remotely for overseas advertising agencies as a writer? . People could also mistake this to be about version-control and branches used there to distinguish different versions that people are working on.\n\ninteractive doesn't really convey the feeling of being about problems you encounter when writing such a multi-branch story. It looks like it could be about interactive tools that help you write your story instead of being an element in the writing problem itself.\n\nI completely agree with the Pro section of the question.\n\nThe narrative is independent of the game mechanics and our focus should be on the narrative. Game mechanics and their impact would be better served over on GameDev.SE. The mechanics might play a role when mentioning requirements about your writing, such as when you are basing everything on locations but not knowing how to keep track of what happens where and needing for example tools or software that help you with this issue, but the mechanics shouldn't be the focus of the question.\n\nstory-engine might actually be another topic that might be worth a new tag if we have some questions that deal specifically with them. Questions like Resource for generic plot hooks? might profit from being categorized in a special category that deals with engines that are helping you to come up with stuff. Looking at the NaNoGenMo page linked in the question it says for example:\n\nThe \"novel\" is defined however you want. It could be 50,000 repetitions of the word \"meow\".\n\nThis shows that such a generator does not necessarily need a branching storyline. Maybe a generator is used to develop each branch of a multi-branch story, but in such a case I would say it would be a good idea to tag a question with both branching-narrative and story-engine. Maybe this could go together with the granular text category mentioned in the question so that we have a tag that is used for text generation in general, no matter if it's trying to be coherent, translating stuff or just creating more of less random stuff?\n\nA tag that might be important to think about in the context of this question is storyline. The tag assumes one continuous storyline and should therefore get a tag wiki update when we create branching-narrative to say that this is the main difference. Something like:\n\nThis tag should be used on questions that deal with a continous storyline, though the timeline could change if you are writing a story that involves timetravel. Contrast this with the tag [branching-narrative], which should be used for questions that deal with multiple possible storylines that depend on the choices of the person interacting with your work. A \"choice\" in this context could be a conscious choice, a quest-item in the characters inventory, the amount of interactions with certain other characters, ..."
