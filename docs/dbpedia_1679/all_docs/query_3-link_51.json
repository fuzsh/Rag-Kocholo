        "text": "As far back as classical Greek civilisation, non-linear narratives have existed though they were considered inferior to linear narratives. Critics considered Homer's 'Odyssey' a more superior text than the 'Iliad' as it contained fewer narrative defects, because the protagonist was always present and at the conclusion all strands of the story dove-tailed into a neat, cohesive conclusion. Twentieth-Century, film-maker Quentin Tarantino has been both hated and admired for his non-linear storytelling style in particular, 'Pulp Fiction' which simultaneously tells three stories, forward, backward, and in reverse order. The unconventional narratology of Stephen Daldry's 2002 film adaptation of Michael Cunningham's novel 'The Hours' (1998) which is in itself a story of three women in three different epochs, connected through the protagonist of Virginia Woolf's 'Mrs. Dalloway' will be the subject of this study. The rationale for the non-linearity of the structure, as also the presence of multiple protagonists will be elaborated upon from the perspective of its adaptation from the literary style of Stream of Consciousness writing that became popular in the early 20th Century. As each text is reflective of the culture that engenders it, this research will highlight issues that make the use of such unstructured frameworks possible both in literary writing as well as film-making. Structures are expressions of power and breaking structures, a form of resistance. Non-linearity has now become a discourse that feminists use to 'transmit and produce power' in order to thwart patriarchy's attempts to continue to shape discourse. This research will focus on the non-linearity of storytelling in an attempt to identify women's attempts to shape alternative framings."
