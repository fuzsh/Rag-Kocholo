        "text": "Flashbacks and flash-forwards are the most common non-linear storytelling techniques, as they allow you to move between the past and the future of your characters and plot. They can be used to reveal important information, motivations, or secrets, as well as to contrast or foreshadow the present situation. However, you need to make sure that your flashbacks and flash-forwards are relevant, clear, and consistent, and that they do not disrupt the flow or tension of your main story.\n\nIn medias res is a Latin term that means \"in the middle of things\". It is a non-linear storytelling technique that involves starting your story from a crucial or dramatic point, and then filling in the background or context later. It can be used to hook your readers' attention, create curiosity, or set up a conflict, as well as to avoid boring or clichéd introductions. However, you need to balance the amount of information you withhold and reveal, and make sure that your readers can follow and care about your characters and plot.\n\nDuring the academic year 2022/2023, I explored the micro-story/micro-narrative (a literary genre predominantly of Hispanic-American origin) with my Master's students. Due to the compact dimensions of this type of text, there is often a preference for commencing in media res, fostering the notion that the first words of the micro-story seamlessly continue an ongoing narrative. This technique contributes significantly to the emergence of the illusion of the sudden, commonly referred to as sudden fiction. In such instances, there is a typical reliance on the so-called empty deixis - false deixis, which involves using the definite grammatical form for an element previously undisclosed, as: 'When he woke up...', 'For those students...'.\n\nReverse chronology is a non-linear storytelling technique that involves telling your story backwards, from the end to the beginning. It can be used to create a sense of mystery, irony, or tragedy, as well as to challenge your readers' assumptions or perspectives. However, you need to avoid confusion, repetition, or predictability, and make sure that your story has a clear logic and purpose behind its reverse order.\n\nWhen building your story, don't be afraid to try something different - start with the ending and use it as a tease to the story. Go outside of the story you are in to give context. The best way to make people take notice of what you are doing is to be clear and concise...but be willing to think differently and try something new. Don't worry about haters telling you about the \"right\" way to do something. Innovation happens when you start thinking outside of the norm.\n\nParallel narratives are non-linear storytelling techniques that involve telling two or more stories that are related or connected in some way, but that take place in different times, places, or realities. They can be used to create contrast, comparison, or convergence, as well as to explore different themes, characters, or outcomes. However, you need to maintain a clear distinction, transition, and balance between your parallel narratives, and make sure that they enrich and complement each other.\n\nAs I delve into this definition, my thoughts are inevitably drawn to films such as 'Magnolia,' and particularly 'Mulholland Drive,' which, in my view, stands as a masterpiece in the artful deployment of parallel storytelling techniques. The viewer's focus remains unwavering (in my case, it proved impossible to divert my gaze from the screen). There's a perpetual quest to unearth potential connections between characters and narratives, utterly entrancing the viewer – or reader, in the context of a literary work. From my perspective, incorporating this strategy into writing represents one of the most effective means of crafting a compelling text and genuinely engaging the reader.\n\nFragmented narratives are non-linear storytelling techniques that involve breaking up your story into pieces that are not arranged in a logical or chronological order. They can be used to create a sense of chaos, confusion, or complexity, as well as to reflect the subjective or unreliable nature of your narrator or characters. However, you need to provide some clues, connections, or patterns that help your readers reconstruct and interpret your story, and make sure that your story has a coherent and meaningful message.\n\nNested narratives are non-linear storytelling techniques that involve embedding one or more stories within another story. They can be used to create depth, diversity, or intertextuality, as well as to comment on or critique the main story. However, you need to avoid distraction, digression, or inconsistency, and make sure that your nested narratives are relevant, engaging, and aligned with your main story.\n\nIf you want to write a complex story, you have to plan it ahead of time. You have build your story world. Choose the right characters. Decide on how your hero and opponent fight for the goal. Without planning, you will get lost in all the detail. Chances are you will give up on your story before you finish it. I believe writer's block comes partly from lack of planning. The truth is, you can tell a really good story if you put in the work. Planning takes work. You have to be very creative and to see the big picture. If you want to write on a professional level, don't wait for inspiration. Find it. And you'll find it by planning every detail of your story. Try it!"
