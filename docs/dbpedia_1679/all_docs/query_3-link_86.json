        "text": "Elliptical editing is a film editing technique in which certain parts of a scene are omitted in order to create a sense of ellipsis, or a missing piece. This can be used to imply a passage of time, suggest a character’s thoughts or feelings, or create a sense of mystery or intrigue. Elliptical editing is often used in conjunction with other editing techniques, such as jump cuts, match cuts, and cross-cutting.\n\nSome examples of elliptical editing in films include:\n\n“The Godfather” (1972) – The film uses elliptical editing to show the passing of time between scenes and to imply a sense of continuity between the different parts of the story.\n\n“Memento” (2000) – The film uses elliptical editing to tell its story backwards, with scenes out of chronological order, to give the viewer a sense of the protagonist’s memory loss.\n\n“Pulp Fiction” (1994) – The film uses elliptical editing to jump back and forth in time, creating a non-linear narrative that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.\n\n“Inception” (2010) – The film uses elliptical editing to show the different levels of the dream world and to create a sense of confusion and disorientation.\n\n“The Social Network” (2010) – The film uses elliptical editing to show the rapid and chaotic development of Facebook, and how Mark Zuckerberg’s business and personal relationships were affected.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but elliptical editing is a common technique used in many films to create a specific mood and tone, and to convey certain information to the audience.\n\nHow is elliptical editing used in films?\n\nWatch this video from the team at Fandor\n\nIf you’re looking to hire a video production company, check use the form below!\n\nGET A PROJECT QUOTE"
