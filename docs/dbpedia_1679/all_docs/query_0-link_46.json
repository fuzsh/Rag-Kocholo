Depressed people often have severe, complex problems, and rumination is a common feature. Depressed people often believe that their ruminations give them insight into their problems, but clinicians often view depressive rumination as pathological because it is difficult to disrupt and interferes with the ability to concentrate on other things. Abundant evidence indicates that depressive rumination involves the analysis of episode-related problems. Because analysis is time consuming and requires sustained processing, disruption would interfere with problem-solving. The analytical rumination (AR) hypothesis proposes that depression is an adaptation that evolved as a response to complex problems and whose function is to minimize disruption of rumination and sustain analysis of complex problems. It accomplishes this by giving episode-related problems priority access to limited processing resources, by reducing the desire to engage in distracting activities (anhedonia), and by producing psychomotor changes that reduce exposure to distracting stimuli. Because processing resources are limited, the inability to concentrate on other things is a tradeoff that must be made to sustain analysis of the triggering problem. The AR hypothesis is supported by evidence from many levels, including genes, neurotransmitters and their receptors, neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, neuroenergetics, pharmacology, cognition and behavior, and the efficacy of treatments. In addition, we address and provide explanations for puzzling findings in the cognitive and behavioral genetics literatures on depression. In the process, we challenge the belief that serotonin transmission is low in depression. Finally, we discuss implications of the hypothesis for understanding and treating depression.\n\nKeywords: adaptation, analysis, anxiety, attentional control, counterfactual thinking, depression, disorder, evolution, rumination, serotonin, social dilemmas, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, vigilance, working memory\n\nIntroduction\n\nDepression is an affective state characterized by sad mood, anhedonia (the inability to derive pleasure from activities such as eating or sex), and changes in psychomotor, sleeping, and eating patterns (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000). Depression is commonly thought to be caused by severe problems or stressors, often of a social nature (Brown & Harris, 1978; Hammen, 1992; Kendler, Karkowski, & Prescott, 1999). Depressed people are often concerned and ruminate about these problems, which they perceive to be complex, severe, and difficult to solve (Edwards & Weary, 1993; Lyubomirsky, Tucker, Caldwell, & Berg, 1999; Rudolph & Conley, 2005; Treynor, Gonzalez, & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2003). Depressive rumination is intrusive, persistent, resistant to distraction, and difficult to suppress (Lam, Smith, Checkley, Rijsdijk, & Sham, 2003; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990, 1991; Wenzlaff & Luxton, 2003).\n\nThe predominant medical view is that depression is a mental disorder (APA, 2000). But a recent critique argues that many episodes that meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depression are erroneously classified as disorder (Horwitz & Wakefield, 2007), and there have been calls for greater research into the possibility that depression is an evolved adaptation (Kennair, 2003; Nesse, 2000). Conceptions of mental disorder are usually defined in terms of biological dysfunction (APA, 2000; Kraepelin, 1907; Wakefield, 1992). All body systems are susceptible to malfunctioning, and on this level the idea that depression exists as a disorder has a good foundation. However, what is considered evidence of biological dysfunction has not been well specified. With the DSM-IV, the presence of “clinically significant impairment or distress” was added as a general criterion for the purpose of ensuring that a psychological condition was a disorder (APA, 2000).\n\nThe clinical significance criterion has been criticized on a number of grounds, and it probably fails in its primary purpose—to prevent erroneous diagnoses of disorder (Spitzer & Wakefield, 1999). According to one epidemiological survey, 46.4% of people in the United States have met DSM-IV-TR criteria for at least one mental disorder at some point in their lives, and 16.6% have met criteria for major depressive disorder (Kessler, Berglund, Demler, Jin, & Walters, 2005). Like this survey, most epidemiological estimates of lifetime risk for mental disorders are based on a single wave of data collection. However, people have poor recall of prior symptoms at a single point in time, so lifetime estimates increase when longitudinal information on psychiatric traits are collected from an epidemiological sample and aggregated across multiple waves (Wells & Horwood, 2004). One longitudinal study of adolescents living in Christchurch, New Zealand found that 37% met criteria for a lifetime DSM-III-R or DSM-IV episode of major depression by age 21 (Wells & Horwood, 2004). Another indication that even lifetime estimates may be conservative comes from a recent epidemiological survey in which over 45% of young adults in the United States met DSM-IV-TR criteria for at least one mental disorder within the last year, with 7% meeting criteria for major depression (Blanco et al., 2008).\n\nIn addition to high prevalence estimates in industrialized societies, the characteristic features of depression have been found in every society in which the issue has been examined closely (Horwitz & Wakefield, 2007; Patel, 2001). Information from small-scale societies is sorely lacking, but what exists indicates that depression is present there as well (Hadley & Patil, 2008; Kohrt et al., 2005; Patil & Hadley, 2008; Pike & Patil, 2006).\n\nSuch evidence suggests that much of what is currently classified as depressive disorder represents normal psychological functioning (Horwitz & Wakefield, 2007). One likely factor contributing to overdiagnosis is that clinically significant impairment is not conclusive evidence of disorder (Spitzer & Wakefield, 1999). Impairment can be caused by biological dysfunction, but it can also be caused by properly functioning stress response mechanisms. Organisms have limited energy, attention, and other resources that can be mobilized and allocated to different body systems to deal with adaptive challenges. Some stressors are important and severe enough to tax limited resources, and it is not possible to simultaneously devote resources to all problems. Organisms evolved stress response mechanisms that are triggered by particular stressors, prioritize fitness-related goals, make coordinated tradeoffs in the functioning of body systems, and allocate limited resources accordingly. Negative emotions are stress response mechanisms they are involuntary responses to environmental challenges with important fitness consequences, and they evolved to coordinate changes in physiology, immune function, attention and cognition, physical activity and other body systems to meet those challenges (Cosmides & Tooby, 2000; Ekman, 1999; Frijda, 1986; LeDoux, 1996; Levenson, 1999; Tooby & Cosmides, 1990).\n\nStress response mechanisms can produce impairments when making tradeoffs between different body systems to respond to a stressor. For instance, fever is metabolically expensive and causes significant impairment in multiple domains (work, sexual functioning, social relations, etc.), but these impairments are not usually the product of biological dysfunction. Rather, fever is an adaptation that evolved to coordinate aspects of the immune system in response to infection (Blatteis, 2003; Hasday, Fairchild, & Shanholtz, 2000; Kluger, Kozak, Conn, Leon, & Soszynski, 1996), and the impairments are the adaptive outcome of tradeoffs in body systems needed to produce an effective response (Nesse & Williams, 1994). If the clinical significance criterion were applied to fever, it would be erroneously classified as a disorder.\n\nLike fever, depression causes distress and impairment in many domains of life, including sexual functioning, work, and social relations. One mechanism by which depression is thought to cause impairment is through the production of maladaptive cognitions that interfere with the ability to solve problems (Beck, 1967; Coyne, 1976a, 1976b; Kramer, 2005; Nettle, 2004; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991; Seligman, 1975). This view is not universally held, however. Depressed people believe their ruminations give them insight into their problems (Lyubomirsky & Nolen-Hoeksema, 1993; Watkins & Baracaia, 2001; Watkins & Moulds, 2005). Clinicians also do not present a unified front on the question of whether depression has any beneficial cognitive effects. The issue is commonly debated in the therapeutic trenches, but it also reaches the clinical literature. Neil Jacobson argued that depression helps people detach from unrewarding social environments, but it also promotes avoidance of aspects of the social environment with antidepressant or problem-solving qualities (N. S. Jacobson, Martell, & Dimidjian, 2001). Emmy Gut argued that depression is a functional response to problems in the environment (Gut, 1989). It facilitates problem solving by drawing attention to and promoting the analysis of problems, but it can turn unproductive if people develop avoidant strategies. Peter Kramer acknowledges the lack of unity about depression, but eschews any benefits, cognitive or otherwise (Kramer, 2005).\n\nEmpirical research also differs with respect to whether depression improves or impairs problem-solving. One body of research shows that depression is associated with reduced accuracy on tasks that tap memory, intelligence, and executive functioning (Austin, Mitchell, & Goodwin, 2001; Hartlage, Alloy, Vazquez, & Dykman, 1993; Veiel, 1997). However, another large literature shows that depressed affect promotes an analytical processing style that enhances accuracy on complex tasks (Alloy & Abramson, 1979; Ambady & Gray, 2002; Au, Chan, Wang, & Vertinsky, 2003; Braverman, 2005; Forgas, 1998, 2007; Gasper & Clore, 2002; G. Hertel, Neuhof, Theuer, & Kerr, 2000; Sinclair, 1988; Sinclair & Mark, 1995; Storbeck & Clore, 2005).\n\nIn this paper, we explain the impairments associated with depression, cognitive and otherwise, by hypothesizing that depression is an evolved stress response mechanism. The hypothesis consists of a series of claims, depicted diagrammatically in , of which we now give an overview, and which are discussed in greater detail below.\n\nDifferent environmental stressors trigger different emotions, which coordinate body systems in different ways because those challenges require different responses (Cosmides & Tooby, 2000; Tooby & Cosmides, 1990). It is therefore important to specify the features of problems that trigger depressed affect. The first claim is that complex problems that influence important fitness-related goals trigger depressed affect. For the purposes of this paper, a “complex problem” is an analytically difficult problem. The American Heritage Dictionary (2006) defines analysis as “[t]he separation of an intellectual or material whole into its constituent parts for individual study” and “[t]he study of such constituent parts and their interrelationships in making up a whole”. An analytical problem is therefore one that can be solved by breaking it into smaller, more manageable components and studying each component in turn. The analytical difficulty of a task increases with the number of components that must be studied. In , we list two analytically difficult problems that are thought to trigger depression social dilemmas and exposure to stressors that were otherwise avoidable.\n\nWhen selection causes a trait to evolve, it does so because the trait has a gene-propagating effect, which is called the trait’s function (Andrews, Gangestad, & Matthews, 2002a; Thornhill, 1990; G. C. Williams, 1966). The cumulative effects of selection for genes that promote a specific effect often leaves the tell-tale signs of its workings on a trait, and such evidence can be used to make inferences about past selection pressures (Andrews et al., 2002a; Thornhill, 1990; G. C. Williams, 1966). When a trait has features that proficiently promote a specific effect, that will go a long way to demonstrating that the effect is an evolved function of the trait because it is highly unlikely that chance processes could be completely responsible for the trait’s features (Andrews et al., 2002a; Thornhill, 1990; G. C. Williams, 1966).\n\nOne effect of sad or depressed mood is to promote an analytical reasoning style in which greater attention is paid to detail and information is processed more slowly, methodically, thoroughly, and in smaller chunks (Ambady & Gray, 2002; Edwards & Weary, 1993; Forgas, 1998; Gasper, 2004; Gasper & Clore, 2002; Schwarz, 1990; Schwarz & Bless, 1991; Yost & Weary, 1996). Conversely, positive mood states promote heuristic or creative processing (Ambady & Gray, 2002; Isen, Daubman, & Nowicki, 1987). The second claim is that depression coordinates a suite of changes in body systems that promote rumination, the evolved function of which is to analyze the triggering problem. While analysis is used in science and many areas of modern life, this claim proposes that it is part of the evolved human cognitive repertoire.\n\nAnalysis is time consuming and requires sustained processing, so it is susceptible to disruption, which interferes with problem-solving. Depression induces changes in body systems, producing effects that facilitate analytical rumination by reducing disruption (listed as body system changes and facilitative effects in ). Specifically, depressed affect: (1) activates neurological mechanisms that promote attentional control, which gives problem-related information prioritized access to limited processing resources and makes depressive rumination intrusive, persistent, resistant to distraction, and difficult to suppress; (2) induces anhedonia, which reduces the desire to think about and engage in hedonic activities that could disrupt problem-related processing; and (3) promotes psychomotor changes that reduce exposure to stimuli that could disrupt processing (e.g., desire for social isolation, loss of appetite).\n\nThe third claim is that, over evolutionary time, depressive rumination often helped people solve the problems that triggered their episodes (listed as problem-solving effects in ). This claim is at odds with the commonly held view that depressive cognition is maladaptive and impairs problem-solving (Beck, 1967; Coyne, 1976a, 1976b; Kramer, 2005; Nettle, 2004; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991; Seligman, 1975). However, the strength with which this view is held surpasses the evidence that can currently be mustered in support of it. Most importantly, the view is held without the support of a single study showing that depressed affect impairs solving the problems that actually trigger the depressed episode. Nearly all the evidence that depression impairs cognitive problem-solving comes from laboratory tasks. In contrast, this claim predicts that depression promotes resolution of the triggering problem.\n\nStress response mechanisms often have to make tradeoffs between fitness-related goals to produce an effective response to the triggering problem. Like fever, then, the impairments associated with depression are usually the outcome of adaptive tradeoffs rather than disorder. For instance, because processing resources are limited, a decreased ability to concentrate on other things is a necessary tradeoff that has to be made in order to sustain analysis of a complex, depressogenic problem (listed as a problem-solving effect in ). The fourth claim is that depression reduces accuracy on laboratory tasks because depressive rumination takes up limited processing resources (a downstream effect in ).\n\nIn summary, we hypothesize that depression is a stress response mechanism: (1) that is triggered by analytically difficult problems that influence important fitness-related goals; (2) that coordinates changes in body systems to promote sustained analysis of the triggering problem, otherwise known as depressive rumination; (3) that helps people generate and evaluate potential solutions to the triggering problem; and (4) that makes tradeoffs with other goals in order to promote analysis of the triggering problem, including reduced accuracy on laboratory tasks. Collectively, we refer to this suite of claims as the analytical rumination (AR) hypothesis.\n\nIn , we list as downstream effects many other features of depression that have been reported in the literature. We argue that these features are interpretable in terms of the AR hypothesis as well. In the course of discussing the AR hypothesis, we also discuss anxiety because it is often comorbid with depression (Belzer & Schneier, 2004), and it shares genetic covariance and common triggers with depression (Kendler, Hettema, Butera, Gardner, & Prescott, 2003; Kendler & Prescott, 2006). In , we flesh out some of the triggers and effects of anxiety to the extent it helps us discuss the AR hypothesis.\n\nThe AR hypothesis does not preclude other evolutionary accounts for depression, and several important hypotheses have been proposed (Allen & Badcock, 2003; P. Gilbert, 2006; Hagen, 1999, 2002; Nesse, 2000; Price, Sloman, Gardner, Gilbert, & Rohde, 1994; Watson & Andrews, 2002). In principle, it is possible for different selection pressures to shape a trait for multiple functions (Andrews et al., 2002a; Andrews, Gangestad, & Matthews, 2002b). Emotions may be good examples of such traits because they are thought to have evolved to coordinate the activity of multiple body systems to meet challenges in the environment (Frijda, 1986; Levenson, 1999; Tooby & Cosmides, 1990). Since new body systems are constructed from pre-existing designs, their coordination may have evolved in a stepwise fashion over evolutionary time as new systems were constructed. If so, emotions could be viewed as adaptations that gradually accumulated multiple coordinating functions over evolutionary time. Elucidating that a trait has multiple functions minimally requires demonstrating that the trait has some features unique to one function, and other features unique to another function (Andrews et al., 2002a).\n\nWe argue that depression has some unique features to it that are best explained by the AR hypothesis, and are difficult for other hypotheses to explain. In doing so, we integrate research on genes, neurotransmitters, receptors, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, functional neuroimaging, pharmacology, behavior, cognition, comparative research, and the efficacy of therapies. We describe some of the likely neurological mechanisms involved in making depressive rumination analytical and resistant to distraction. This supports the point that depression evolved by natural selection because there is a neurological orderliness that appears to specifically and proficiently promote analysis in depressive rumination and is not likely to have evolved by chance. In the course of this review, we are led to examine the evidence for the widely held view that depression is a state of low brain serotonin. The evidence for this view is indirect, and we conclude that there are perhaps more compelling reasons to suspect the opposite i.e., that depression is a state of high serotonergic transmission. We also consider a puzzling finding in the behavioral genetics literature on depression and provide a possible resolution to it. Finally, we consider a number of paradoxical findings in the scientific literature on the cognitive effects of depression ( ). To our knowledge, this list has not been compiled before or targeted as worthy of scientific study. The AR hypothesis provides plausible or compelling explanations for each of them.\n\nTable 1\n\nParadoxical Findings\n\nDepression is associated with difficulty concentrating (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), but it also is associated with persistent ruminations (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990).\n\nDepressed affect causes performance decrements on laboratory tasks in many cognitive domains (Austin et al., 2000; Veiel, 1997). But it also promotes an analytical processing style that enhances performance on many cognitive tasks (Ambady & Gray, 2002; Au et al., 2003).\n\nDifferent procedures for inducing depressed mood have different effects on cognition (Hertel et al., 2000; Siebert & Ellis, 1991b; Storbeck & Clore, 2005).\n\nPre-existing depression is associated with reduced accuracy on some tasks (Austin et al., 2000) and greater accuracy on others (Alloy & Abramson, 1979; Yost & Weary, 1996).\n\nAntidepressants improve cognitive functioning in those with pre-existing depression (Koetsier et al., 2002), but they impair non-depressed subjects’ performance on tasks involving vigilance and high working memory loads (Reidel et al., 2005; Schmitt et al., 2002).\n\nDisruption of depressive rumination temporarily alleviates depressed symptoms (Morrow & Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990), but systematic disruption is associated with longer episodes (Hayes et al., 2005; Schmaling et al., 2002; Wenzlaff & Luxton, 2003).\n\nDifferent ruminative styles are associated with different longitudinal effects on depressive symptoms (Treynor et al., 2003).\n\nCrucial Concepts and Caveats\n\nIt is not uncommon to see arguments that depression might be adaptive at low levels, but is maladaptive at levels that reach DSM criteria (Dobson & Pusch, 1995; P. Gilbert & Allan, 1998; L. Lee, Harkness, Sabbagh, & Jacobson, 2005; Markman & Miller, 2006; Nettle, 2004; Price et al., 1994; Wolpert, 2008). These arguments implicitly assume that clinical and subclinical episodes are qualitatively different. Because we think that the clinical significance criterion leads to the overdiagnosis of depressive disorder, we intend our arguments to apply to a range of depressive symptoms, from transient sadness to much of what would currently satisfy DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depression. A good deal of evidence supporting the AR hypothesis comes from samples that satisfy DSM criteria, and there is little evidence that clinical depression is qualitatively different from subclinical depression, a point to which we now turn.\n\nIs Major Depression Qualitatively Different from Subclinical Depression?\n\nOur comments here are restricted to unipolar depression. For instance, we are not challenging the view that bipolar depression is qualitatively different from unipolar depression.\n\nEpidemiological and quantitative studies explicitly testing the issue find that unipolar depressive symptoms are better characterized on a single continuum of severity, duration, and liability (Aggen, Neale, & Kendler, 2005; Korszun et al., 2004; Krueger & Markon, 2006). Depressive symptoms are continuously distributed through large populations (Hankin, Fraley, Lahey, & Waldman, 2005), and depressive rumination increases continuously with symptom severity (Just & Alloy, 1997; Lam et al., 2003; Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow, 1991).\n\nWhile it is sometimes argued that impairment distinguishes clinical and subclinical depression, psychosocial impairment increases monotonically with the number of depressive symptoms (Kessler, Zhao, Blazer, & Swartz, 1997; Sakashita, Slade, & Andrews, 2007) as does the future liability for major depression (Aggen et al., 2005). Even the performance decrements on cognitive tests increase with the severity of episodes (Elderkin-Thompson et al., 2003). Finally, while chronic stress-related reductions in hippocampal volume have been found in people with major depression, the relationship between stress and reduced hippocampal volume is continuous and is not limited to those who satisfy clinical criteria (Gianaros et al., 2007).\n\nThe symptoms of depression show some variability, and this variability has been used to argue for depressive subtypes. For instance, the signs of melancholia include anhedonia, psychomotor disturbance, weight loss, feelings of guilt, and early morning wakening (Akiskal & Akiskal, 2007). However, the melancholic subtype is not heritable, except as part of a general liability to depression (Maier, Lichtermann, Heun, & Hallmayer, 1992). Moreover, individuals with melancholia in one episode often show different patterns in other episodes (Akiskal & Akiskal, 2007). Altogether, such variability is consistent with evidence of modulation of symptoms in response to different triggering stressors (M. C. Keller, Neale, & Kendler, 2007; M. C. Keller & Nesse, 2006). It is not strong evidence that the symptoms are discontinuous.\n\nIt could be argued that depression is not continuous based on evidence that variability in specific genes, such as the serotonin transporter gene, are risk factors for depression (Murphy, Lerner, Rudnick, & Lesch, 2004). However, the problem lies in understanding how genes with discrete effects can code for traits with continuous phenotypic variability. The resolution is that the effects of such genes are usually small and do not account for all the genetic variability (Conner & Hartl, 2004). When the phenotypic effects are summed across all loci, their overall influence looks continuous (Conner & Hartl, 2004). Thus, evidence that individual genes have small discrete effects on the risk of depression is not inconsistent with the evidence of continuity.\n\nIn this paper, we also rely on studies of people who, instead of coming into the lab with pre-existing depression, are exposed to a sad experimental mood induction. The issue of whether experimentally induced sadness is qualitatively different from pre-existing depression is more complicated. There are many methods that are used to induce sad mood, but they all seem to increase depressed affect as assessed by validated instruments (Westermann, Spies, Stahl, & Hesse, 1996). They also tend to increase other forms of negative affect, such as anxiety and anger (Westermann et al., 1996). But because pre-existing depression is often naturally comorbid with anxiety and anger (Belzer & Schneier, 2004; P. Gilbert, Gilbert, & Irons, 2004), it is not clear that this makes experimentally induced sadness qualitatively different. Indeed, from a practical standpoint, it is impossible to study pre-existing depression or experimentally induced sadness without some degree of comorbidity with other negative emotions.\n\nFunctional neuroimaging studies tend to show a great deal of similarity in the brain activation patterns of people with experimentally induced sadness and major unipolar depression, but there are some differences (Drevets & Raichle, 1998; Liotti, Mayberg, McGinnis, Brannan, & Jerabek, 2002). Some differences may stem from the fact that experimentally induced sadness usually does not involve actual exposure to a stressor (Drevets & Raichle, 1998). Other differences may result from the fact that the neuroimaging signal becomes a less reliable indicator of neuronal activity as the intensity of depressive episodes increases (Andrews & Neale, n.d.; Conca et al., 2000; Dunn et al., 2005).\n\nFinally, as we discuss in more detail below, the cognitive effects of experimentally induced sadness vary with the mood induction procedure. Some methods produce a state similar to pre-existing depression by virtue of the fact that they increase depressed affect as measured by validated instruments, elicit intrusive thoughts (ruminations), and affect performance on laboratory tasks in similar ways (Seibert & Ellis, 1991b). Other methods increase depressed affect, but probably do not elicit ruminative thoughts, and affect performance on laboratory tasks in different ways from pre-existing depression. We argue that the differences in the methods and their effects provide strong experimental evidence relevant to the AR hypothesis.\n\nMore generally, even if most episodes of DSM-IV-TR major depression were qualitatively different from subclinical forms in some ways, we show in this paper that the evidence that depression promotes the sustained analysis of problem-related information comes from research on clinical, subclinical, and experimentally induced samples (see Second, Third and Fourth Claims).\n\nTerminology\n\nSymptom\n\nTo some, “symptom” may imply an underlying disorder or disease. We do not mean to imply this and instead use the term merely to refer to a characteristic or feature of a trait.\n\nDepressed affect or depression\n\nBecause depressive episodes that satisfy DSM-IV-TR criteria are often thought to be qualitatively different from subclinical episodes, terms like “dysphoria” are sometimes used to describe subclinical depression, while “depression” is reserved for episodes that reach clinical criteria. Because this categorical approach is unsupported, we avoid “dysphoria”. Instead, we use depressed affect and depression interchangeably to describe an affective continuum that ranges from transient sadness (including experimentally induced sadness) to severe, chronic depression. When referring to studies, we still use “major depression”, “clinical depression”, “subclinical depression”, and “sad” or “induced” mood to let the reader know whether the depressed state was pre-existing or induced and to provide the reader with information about the intensity of the affective state. For instance, “major depression” and “clinical depression” are used to describe pre-existing depressive states that satisfy DSM criteria for episodes of major depression. But we view the thresholds that separate clinical and subclinical depression as arbitrary. As such, to us, episodes of major depression fall on the severe end of the continuum. Future research may prove the assumption of continuity wrong or in need of modification. However, it currently enjoys substantial empirical support, and we find it useful for organizing this paper.\n\nCognitive resources\n\nIn a general sense, the AR hypothesis proposes that depression influences the allocation of cognitive resources to problems or tasks. We define “cognitive resources” as the neurological machinery that is involved in monitoring, processing or storing information (Reisberg, 2006). Abundant evidence indicates that cognitive resources are limited (Baddeley, 2007; Cowan, 2005; Kahneman, 1973; Marois & Ivanoff, 2005; Reisberg, 2006). This is commonly demonstrated by interference patterns when subjects are given dual tasks that utilize the same pool of cognitive resources (Kane & Engle, 2002; Marois & Ivanoff, 2005; Reisberg, 2006).\n\nAttention\n\nWe occasionally use some terms to help us describe the allocation of limited cognitive resources. In general, we use “attention” to refer to cognitive resources that could be devoted to some task or problem. When used in association with attention, “focus” and its derivatives refer to an increase in the allocation of limited cognitive resources toward a task at the expense of other potential tasks to which the resources could be devoted; whereas “distract” and its derivatives refer to a diversion of cognitive resources away from one task by another task. Given two tasks, A and B, that utilize the same pool of cognitive resources, it is in principle equivalent to say that attention focuses on task A at the expense of task B, or that task A distracts attention from task B. From the viewpoint of the AR hypothesis, however, the most interesting task is the problem that triggered the depressive episode. Thus, we typically use focus and distract in reference to the allocation of resources towards, or away from, the triggering problem.\n\nFirst Claim: Complex Problems Trigger Depressed Affect\n\nThe AR hypothesis proposes that depressed affect is triggered by problems: (1) that are complex (analytically difficult); and (2) that affected fitness in evolutionary environments. While we spend more effort on the first component as it requires greater explanation, this is not to minimize the importance of the second component. The first component implies the existence of mechanisms that register whether a problem is ‘complex’. The features of such mechanisms are largely outside of the scope of this paper, but one way a problem could be registered as ‘complex’ is if it resists simple attempts to solve it.\n\nWhile this claim has not been directly tested, we know of no contradictory evidence, and it provides new interpretations of many findings in the depression literature.\n\nResearch on Treatments for Depression\n\nThe first line of research that we interpret with our hypothesis involves the efficacy of depression treatments. A fundamental principle in medicine is that it is more effective to treat the cause of an illness than to treat its symptoms (Nesse & Williams, 1994). For instance, treating fever with antipyretics does not treat the infection that caused the fever, and antipyretics actually impair recovery from infection (Hasday et al., 2000; Kluger et al., 1996; Plaisance, Kudaravalli, Wasserman, Levine, & Mackowiak, 2000). An antibiotic will be more effective for a bacterial infection. The principle may be reversed: the factors that make treatments effective can give insight into the cause of a condition. For instance, the cause of asexual reproduction in a species of wasp was attributed to a bacterial infection when it reverted to sexual reproduction upon administration of an antibiotic (Stouthamer, Luck, & Hamilton, 1990). We use the same kind of logic to get insight into the causes of depression.\n\nDepression is commonly considered to be a neurochemical disorder, and it is often treated with antidepressant medications. Relative to placebo, the response to antidepressants often fails to reach clinical significance except for the most severely depressed patients (Kirsch et al., 2008). Moreover, controlled experiments have yielded no evidence that they prevent relapse once treatment stops (Hollon, Thase, & Markowitz, 2002), which is precisely what one would expect if medications were only treating symptom.\n\nUnlike medications, some psychotherapies try to help people solve problems in their lives, and controlled experiments have shown that they work just as well as medications in the acute phase and have lasting post-treatment effects (Hollon et al., 2002). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is based on the cognitive triad hypothesis, which proposes that depression is caused by negative cognitions about the self, the future, and the world (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979). These cognitions are thought to arise in response to negative events and lead to social withdrawal, which reinforces the cognitions. In CBT, intervention is possible at a number of points, including: (1) helping depressed people solve the problems that cause their cognitions; (2) helping depressed people stay engaged in their social environment so they can test the veracity of their cognitions (the behavioral activation [BA] component); and (3) directly helping them change the way they think about their situation (the automatic thoughts [AT] component) (Greenberger & Padesky, 1995). CBT has positive effects in the acute and post-treatment phases (Hollon et al., 2002).\n\nBecause CBT is heterogeneous, some components may not be therapeutic. Neil Jacobson and his colleagues randomly assigned depressed subjects to three conditions: (a) full CBT; (b) AT plus BA; and (c) BA only. They found no differences in outcome in the either the acute or post-treatment phases (E. T. Gortner, Gollan, Dobson, & Jacobson, 1998; N. S. Jacobson et al., 1996). They reasoned that BA was the primary therapeutic component because it was the only thing common to all conditions. Based on these results, Jacobson and his colleagues developed and tested an enhanced behavioral activation therapy (EBA) (N. S. Jacobson et al., 2001). The goal of EBA is to identify the punishing or non-rewarding aspects of the environment that the depressed person attempts to avoid and help the person find ways to make them more rewarding. In the acute phase, EBA worked better than CBT and just as well as antidepressants (Dimidjian et al., 2006), and just as well as CBT in the post-treatment phase (Dobson et al., 2008). Moreover, this study found that patients with severe, chronic depression did not respond well to CBT, whereas they responded better to EBA (Coffman, Martell, Gallop, Dimidjian, & Hollon, 2007).\n\nSuch evidence suggests that the attempt to change depressed people’s cognitions may not be the most fruitful therapeutic approach to treating depression. Indeed, a study found that the degree to which a CBT therapist focused on changing cognitions during treatment was associated with worse long-term outcomes, possibly because patients can perceive CBT as dismissive of their real troubles (Castonguay, Goldfried, Wiser, Raue, & Hayes, 1996).\n\nAnother effective psychotherapy is interpersonal therapy (IPT), and one of its primary goals is to assess the interpersonal problems that depressed people face and help them develop strategies and skills for solving them (Hollon et al., 2002). Like EBA, there is some evidence that IPT may work better than CBT, and IPT appears to work just as well as medications in the acute phase (Cuijpers, van Straten, Andersson, & van Oppen, 2008; Hollon et al., 2002).\n\nIn short, CBT, EBA and IPT are effective psychotherapies for depression, and a common feature is that they attempt to identify and help solve problems that depressed patients face. Unlike medications, they have enduring effects even after treatment has ended. Applying the principle that treating the cause of a psychological condition works better than treating a sign or symptom of it, this research suggests that depressive episodes are not usually caused by negative cognitions, but rather by problems that people have difficulty solving on their own.\n\nWhat Depressed People Think About Their Situation\n\nThe second line of research that we interpret in light of the first claim involves the beliefs that depressed people have of their situation. Depressed people often report that they face severe, complex problems that are difficult to solve, they report less confidence in finding solutions to their problems, and they focus more on them (Lyubomirsky et al., 1999). Depressed people also tend to report having lost control over their lives (Edwards & Weary, 1998; J. A. Jacobson, Weary, & Edwards, 1999; Lyubomirsky et al., 1999). Perceived lack of control over negative events is often called hopelessness (Abramson, Alloy, & Metalsky, 1989), which is misleading because the term suggests a binary variable in which one either has some hope or no hope at all. In practice, it is treated as a semi-continuous variable that reflects a negative outlook for the self and the degree of perceived lack of control over it (Abramson et al., 1989; Beck, Weissman, Lester, & Trexler, 1974). The perception of having complex problems, and of having lost control over outcomes, also suggests that depression may be caused by complex problems.\n\nSocial Dilemmas\n\nComplex social problems may be the primary evolutionarily relevant trigger of depression in human beings (Watson & Andrews, 2002). The fitness benefits of living in groups include, among other things, food sharing, assistance in raising children, protection from enemies, and close proximity to mates. But the accrual of such benefits requires a certain amount of cooperation among group members. At the same time, selection favors those who effectively pursue their self-interest, and group members also compete for limited resources, social status, and mates. Over evolutionary time, humans have faced social dilemmas in which fitness depended upon effectively pursuing self-interest, but without breaking the cooperative bonds that make group living possible (Andrews, 2001; Humphrey, 1976).\n\nSocial dilemmas have an analytical structure, in part, because there are multiple goals that must be satisfied (e.g., maintaining cooperative bonds, pursuing self-interest). In essence, the problem must be broken down and studied with respect to each goal. However, the analytical structure of social dilemmas is not defined simply by goal number. The goals merely provide the context that creates the dilemma. For every social dilemma, there may be many possible tactics that one may take, and each must be analyzed for their effects on goals. The number of tactics that must be evaluated increases the analytical complexity of the dilemma.\n\nAnother facet of a social dilemma that increases its analytical difficulty is that the goals tend to work against each other. For instance, the pursuit of self-interest can often be accomplished with the use of coercion or deception, yet such tactics tend to have the effect of eroding cooperative bonds (Humphrey, 1976). When goals work against each other, it becomes more difficult to find a solution that satisfies all the goals, and tradeoffs may have to be made. This forces the level of analysis to go a level deeper in which the specific costs and benefits of each possible option must be considered and weighed against each other to ascertain the best likely choice. Finding the best solution to a social dilemma becomes more analytically difficult when there are more tradeoffs because the number of elements that must be studied increases.\n\nHuman social groups are not simply composed of dyadic relations they are webs in which people are also indirectly connected to each other through others (Andrews, 2001; Watson & Andrews, 2002). Dilemmas that reach wider into a social web are more analytically difficult to solve because more players must be considered (Humphrey, 1976).\n\nFinally, in human social groups, individuals interact repeatedly over their lifetimes (Humphrey, 1976; Trivers, 1971). A possible solution to a dilemma must not only be evaluated with respect to how it influences present outcomes, but it must also be evaluated for how one’s partner-opponents are likely to respond in future interactions (Humphrey, 1976). As in chess, the successful social player is often one who can see further into the future of possible moves and responses (Humphrey, 1976; Watson & Andrews, 2002). But this should also be an analytical task because it requires decomposing the problem into a decision tree, studying the possible moves and responses at each decision node, and considering their value not only to oneself, but also to one’s partner-opponents (Andrews, 2001; Watson & Andrews, 2002).\n\nSocial dilemmas have probably been recurrent features of the human evolutionary environment. Here are some examples. First, sexual infidelity may pose dilemmas for men and women (Buss, 2000). Consider a woman with dependent children who discovers her husband is having an affair with a younger woman. Is the wife’s best strategy to ignore it and tolerate the time and investment that the husband devotes to this other woman or confront him, force him to choose between her and the other woman, and risk abandonment? Conversely, consider a man who discovers that his wife is having an affair with a stronger, more dominant man. Is the best strategy to ignore the affair, and if his wife gets pregnant, help her raise offspring that may not be his? Or is it to confront the two and risk a potentially dangerous conflict with a more powerful man? In both scenarios, the answer is not obvious because there are benefits and risks associated with each option, and the best solution may depend on the specifics of the situation.\n\nSecond, for men, gaining dominance over other men yields benefits with respect to access to mates and the distribution of resources (Geary, Byrd-Craven, Hoard, Vigil, & Numtee, 2003). In humans, dominance is partly achieved by physical ability. But men also form cooperative coalitions, which are often successful in neutralizing the physical advantage of stronger males (Geary et al., 2003). Achieving within-group dominance in a cooperative coalition often requires great political skill, because indiscriminate violence and aggression can erode the support of group members. Conflict over dominance-striving is inevitable (Geary et al., 2003), but the dilemma is to find ways of negotiating it that do not erode coalitional bonds.\n\nFinally, women also have several fitness-related goals that tend to work against each other. First, bearing and raising offspring is one of the most energetically expensive activities that a female mammal can undertake, primarily due to lactation (Millar, 1977). In hunter-gatherer groups, which are thought to exist in conditions similar to those of the human evolutionary past, reproductively aged women expend more energy than they produce through their own resource acquisition activities (Kaplan, Hill, Lancaster, & Hurtado, 2000). Women’s energy budgets are therefore subsidized, primarily by men (Kaplan et al., 2000; Marlowe, 2003). Second, unlike other female primates, women need assistance during childbirth (Rosenberg & Trevathan, 2002). Third, they need protection because they tend to be physically weaker, which makes them vulnerable to rape, capture by warring bands, and homicide by jealous lovers and husbands (Bleske-Rechek & Buss, 2001; Wilson & Mesnick, 1997). Finally, they need to minimize social stress because it appears to cause infertility and negative pregnancy outcomes (Berga & Loucks, 2006; Berga et al., 2003; Hobel & Culhane, 2003; Wasser & Place, 2001). In the human evolutionary past, the difficulty of achieving these goals was probably exacerbated by the fact that, unlike men, women tended to migrate away from their natal group when they reached reproductive age (Geary et al., 2003). Migration put young women in the dilemma of trying to elicit resources, assistance, and protection without causing social stress from people they were genetically unrelated to, and with whom they had few prior interactions, both of which increase competition and reduce cooperation (Hamilton, 1964a, 1964b; Trivers, 1971).\n\nIs there any evidence that social dilemmas are depressogenic? Many of the problems that depressed people face are social in nature (Brown & Harris, 1978; Hammen, 1992; Kendler et al., 2003). Interpersonal conflict is commonly associated with depression (Hammen, 1992), but it is associated with higher levels of depression if it occurs with close social partners. For instance, people have higher levels of depressive symptoms if the conflict occurs in their most intimate circle of partners as opposed to less intimate circles (Antonucci, Akiyama, & Lansford, 1998). In married couples, the risk for major depression is about 40 times greater if the couple is unhappily married (Weissman, 1987). Moreover, conflict with close social partners is associated with more depression if the relationship is otherwise characterized by helpfulness and cooperation (Major, Zubek, Cooper, Cozzarelli, & Richards, 1997; Pagel, Erdly, & Becker, 1987). The fact that conflict within an otherwise cooperative relationship is associated with higher levels of depression strongly suggests that social dilemmas are depressogenic.\n\nDefeat in a struggle for dominance is thought to be depressogenic to many organisms, including humans, primates, and rodents (P. Gilbert, 2006). The social defeat hypothesis proposes that depression is a response to being socially uncompetitive, and its function is to down-regulate behavior that could be perceived as a challenge to dominants and signal that the depressed individual is not a threat (P. Gilbert, 2006). We agree that social defeat is depressogenic and an ecologically and evolutionarily relevant stressor. But we are unconvinced that depression serves the proposed appeasement functions. While depression elicits negative responses from people whose relationship to the depressed person is distant (Segrin & Dillard, 1992), it appears to suppress aggression and elicit supportive and sympathetic responses from partners when the partner and the depressed person are in conflict and in a close relationship (e.g., mates, parent-child) (Sheeber, Hops, & Davis, 2001). Reduced aggression is consistent with the social defeat hypothesis, but the elicitation of support and sympathy is more consistent with the idea that depression is useful in negotiating a personally advantageous outcome when in conflict with close social partners (Hagen, 1999, 2002; Hagen & Thomson, 2004; Watson & Andrews, 2002). We suggest that social defeat is depressogenic because the lives of subordinate organisms are complicated and they have to rely more on their wits to pursue self-interested goals (R. Byrne & Whiten, 1988; de Waal, 2007). They have greater difficulty getting mates and resources, and they are more vulnerable to stress-related disease and aggression by dominants (Alcock, 2001; Sapolsky, 2004).\n\nPreventing Recurrences of Avoidable Stressors\n\nSocial problems are often thought to be avoidable with foresight or planning (Hammen, 1992; Kendler et al., 1999). Many organisms have been under selection to prevent the recurrence of avoidable stressors. For instance, operant conditioning mechanisms allow organisms to learn, through repeated exposure to negative outcomes, to associate those outcomes with concurrent environmental stimuli, and use that information to behave in ways that help them avoid recurrences (Kandel, Schwartz, & Jessell, 1991). However, operant conditioning often requires multiple exposures to a negative outcome, and repeated exposure to a negative outcome can sometimes be inefficient, costly, or deadly. In such situations, selection may favor the evolution of more complex mechanisms that foster quicker learning or that help anticipate stressors so that preventative action may be taken before they occur.\n\nWith respect to human beings, one reason why avoidable stressors occur is because the person lacked an accurate causal understanding of the situation and how they could influence it (Roese & Olson, 1997; Weary, Marsh, Gleicher, & Edwards, 1993). This, in turn, suggests that the person could experience similar stressors again. Consequently, people who have been exposed to avoidable stressors may devote greater cognitive effort to understanding why the event occurred and how it could have been avoided (Roese & Olson, 1997; Weary et al., 1993). Such thoughts are called upward counterfactual thoughts (Roese & Olson, 1997). They are counterfactual thoughts because they focus on how the present situation could have turned out differently if different action had been taken. And they are upward counterfactual thoughts because they are focused on how the situation could have turned out better than it actually did.\n\nCounterfactual thoughts are sometimes considered unproductive because it is impossible to alter the past (Roese & Olson, 1997). However, upward counterfactual thoughts appear to help people understand why the problem was not avoided and how similar problems could be avoided in the future (Roese & Olson, 1997). Consistent with this, several studies have found that counterfactual thinking may help prevent recurrences of avoidable stressors (Nasco & Marsh, 1999; Page & Colby, 2003; Roese, 1994).\n\nExperiments show that avoidable stressors trigger negative affect, which in turn triggers upward counterfactuals about the avoidable stressor (Roese & Olson, 1997). This is also supported by correlational studies on depression. Exposure to an avoidable stressor appears to trigger depression (Hammen, 1992; Kendler et al., 1999), and depressed people tend to have more upward counterfactuals about recent avoidable stressors (Markman & Weary, 1996).\n\nThe generation of counterfactual thoughts involves analysis. When an avoidable stressor occurs, understanding why it occurred requires the individual to reverse the causal order of events to understand at what points he or she could have made different decisions that would have avoided the problem (Roese & Olson, 1997). This is an analytical task because it requires breaking up the causal chain of events into different decision nodes and studying the various decisions that could have been made and evaluating their likely consequences. Consistent with this, the longer the causal chain, the more difficult this becomes, and people have greater difficulty generating counterfactual thoughts (R. M. J. Byrne, 1998; German & Nichols, 2003).\n\nTo summarize, exposure to an avoidable stressor poses the problem of understanding why the stressor occurred so that similar events can be avoided in the future. Acquiring this understanding is a complex problem that requires counterfactual analysis. Consistent with our claim that depression is a response to complex problems, epidemiological evidence suggests that exposure to an avoidable stressor is more depressogenic than exposure to an unavoidable stressor (Hammen, 1992; Kendler et al., 1999), and experimental evidence indicates that it triggers higher levels of negative affect (Roese & Olson, 1997).\n\nFuture Directions\n\nA direct test of the first claim would experimentally manipulate the analytical difficulty of a task and measure depressed affect during the task. The depression-triggering effects of a task are predicted to be higher during the task (as opposed to after its completion) because depression is hypothesized to be a process-oriented emotion. We recently conducted a preliminary test (Andrews et al., 2007). Subjects who came into the testing situation with low depression reported an increase in depressed affect after they had been given difficult practice questions from an analytically difficult test. Conversely, control subjects who did not take the practice questions did not report an increase in depressed affect. Moreover, subjects who reported higher levels of depressed affect after taking the practice questions then proceeded to perform better on the test. These results suggest that the practice questions elicited depressed affect because they were analytically difficult, and not because they made subjects fatigued or frustrated, or because they found the questions too difficult and gave up. (Depression was measured after the practice questions but before administration of the test to facilitate detecting process-oriented effects.)\n\nThe claim should be tested with social dilemmas as they are posited to be an evolutionarily relevant trigger of depressed affect. As noted above, real-life social dilemmas are positively associated with depression. Several experimental paradigms have been developed in which cooperation must be balanced with the pursuit of self-interest (Axelrod, 1984; Doebeli & Hauert, 2005; G. Hertel et al., 2000). The AR hypothesis predicts that experimentally manipulating the analytical difficulty of the dilemma by changing the degree to which tradeoffs must be made between cooperating and pursuing self-interest, the number of people to keep track of, and so on, will induce depressed affect.\n\nSecond Claim: Depression Coordinates Changes in Body Systems that Promote Sustained Analysis of the Triggering Problem\n\nIntrusive thoughts are not unique to depression they also occur in other negative emotions (anxiety, fear, anger), post-traumatic stress, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, etc. Negative emotions are thought to be responses to problems or threats in the environment that can be solved or alleviated with attention to the problem (Alexander, 1986; Thornhill & Thornhill, 1989), so they are all predicted to orient cognitive resources on the triggering problem. This distinguishes negative emotions from some psychological states such as bipolar disorder in which thoughts race in the mind without focusing on a single issue.\n\nAdaptationist hypotheses for emotions propose that there is a concordance between the triggering problem and the effects promoted by the emotional response (Cosmides & Tooby, 2000; Tooby & Cosmides, 1990). Negative emotions are predicted to be distinguishable from each other in that they affect cognition in different ways because they have different triggers that require different responses. For instance, a severe drought is likely to require a different cognitive response from the theft of a valuable object or the dissolution of a cherished romantic relationship. The AR hypothesis predicts that depression coordinates changes in body systems to promote an analytical problem-solving approach that is concordant with the analytical difficult problems that trigger it. Consistent with this, studies of pre-existing and experimentally induced mood have consistently found that depressed affect promotes an analytical processing style in which information is processed more carefully, thoroughly, methodically, and in smaller chunks (Ambady & Gray, 2002; Edwards & Weary, 1993; Gasper, 2004; Gasper & Clore, 2002; Schwarz, 1990; Schwarz & Bless, 1991; Yost & Weary, 1996). Depressive rumination is therefore predicted to be uniquely different from other forms of intrusive thinking in that it involves analysis. To the extent analytical rumination is associated with other psychological states, such as post-traumatic stress (Martin & Tesser, 1996; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004), such states should be comorbid with depression and the event that triggered the comorbid state should pose complex problems.\n\nTwo rumination factors have been identified in depression (Treynor et al., 2003), both of which involve analysis. The first factor is focused on analyzing the problems that depressed people currently face (Treynor et al., 2003). This rumination style is often called pondering or reflection (Treynor et al., 2003), but we refer to it as problem analysis to emphasize its analytical nature. Depressed people often perceive the problems that they face as severe and complex (Lyubomirsky et al., 1999), and they attempt to analyze them (Lyubomirsky et al., 1999; Treynor et al., 2003).\n\nThe second factor is focused on regretful thoughts about the episode, especially understanding why the episode happened and what could have been done to prevent it (Markman & Weary, 1996; Treynor et al., 2003; Watkins & Mason, 2002). As discussed above, such counterfactual thoughts are generated through analysis. We therefore refer to this rumination style as counterfactual analysis, though it is often called brooding (Treynor et al., 2003).\n\nThe AR hypothesis predicts that the key factor for promoting sustained analysis is to minimize the disruption of rumination (see ). In this section, we first explain why analysis is vulnerable to disruption, and then we turn to discussing how depression coordinates body system changes to minimize the disruption of analytical rumination.\n\nAnalysis and Working Memory\n\nWorking memory (WM) is a memory system that maintains problem-relevant information in an active, accessible state because it is used in ongoing mental work (Baddeley, 2007). Analysis requires the use of WM because: (1) complex problems are broken down into smaller components; (2) components are studied sequentially; and (3) the results must be kept in an active state to study other components or to solve the larger problem.\n\nMaintaining information in an active, accessible state requires cognitive resources (Kane, 2005; Kane & Engle, 2002). For this reason, WM tasks are vulnerable to interruption, which can interfere with effective problem-solving. Organisms are constantly bombarded with information from the environment. Salient, but task-irrelevant, stimuli can displace information from WM and draw cognitive resources away from the task. Because the interruption of processing may have negative consequences to the organism, WM is thought to be functionally linked to mechanisms that allocate cognitive resources to maintaining information in WM to sustain task-relevant processing under conditions where processing could be interrupted (Baddeley, 2007; Gray, Chabris, & Braver, 2003; Kane, 2005; Kane & Engle, 2002). We refer to such mechanisms as attentional control mechanisms, where “attentional control” refers to the maintenance of information in WM under disruptive conditions by giving it prioritized access to WM.\n\nWorking memory load refers to the amount of information that must be held in working memory. As WM load increases, more cognitive resources must be devoted to keeping information in WM, there is less of a margin for cognitive resources to be diverted from the task before performance suffers, and distracting stimuli are more likely to interfere with task performance (Carpenter, Just, & Shell, 1990; Gray et al., 2003; Kane & Engle, 2002). Thus, WM tasks become more vulnerable to interruption, and require greater attentional control, when WM load is high (Gray et al., 2003; Kane & Engle, 2002).\n\nAn example of an analytical task in which WM load varies is Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) (Raven, Court, & Raven, 1994). The RAPM is considered one of the best measures of nonverbal analytical reasoning ability and fluid intelligence (Carroll, 1993). Each item is a nonverbal pattern completion task in which one of eight choices correctly completes a two-dimensional visual array, and test items become progressively more difficult. One reason that difficulty increases is that the number of elements in the array increases and the rules for how they vary across the two-dimensional array can be different for each element (Carpenter et al., 1990). The rule for each element must be solved independently, so once subjects figure out the rule for how one element varies across the array, they must keep the solution in their WM while they figure out the rules for the remaining elements. Simply put, the problems are solved by analysis. The number of elements that must be analyzed and held in WM varies from 1 to 5, and the proportion of people getting a test item correct is negatively related to the number of elements that must be analyzed (Carpenter et al., 1990).\n\nA recent study used a combination of cognitive and neurobiological evidence to provide evidence that analysis of RAPM problems is related to attentional control (Gray et al., 2003). The researchers gave participants a modified 3-back-matching task, in which individuals are sequentially presented with stimuli such as words or faces. Participants must indicate as quickly as possible whether each stimulus matched the stimulus three items back. In the sequence A-B-C-A-D, when presented with the fourth item, the correct response is a match because it matches the first item (A). But when presented with the fifth item (D), the correct response is a non-match because it does not match the second item (B). This task requires greater attentional control when false lures are presented. For instance, in the sequence A-B-C-D-E-D, the sixth item (D) requires a non-match because the third item back is a C. But the D is a false lure because it was also presented two items back. In this version of the 3-back-matching task, the presence of lures makes it more difficult to remember and update in WM the position of prior items relative to the current stimulus, and people tend to make more errors (Gray et al., 2003).\n\nThe researchers first gave participants the RAPM and then measured their brain activity using fMRI while they completed two versions of the 3-back test one with lures and one without lures. Performance on the RAPM was more related to the percentage of correct answers that they made on the 3-back-with-lures than the 3-back-without-lures. This suggests that people who perform better on the RAPM (i.e., those who can hold more information in WM) also are better at resisting distracting stimuli. Indeed, many studies have shown that people with larger WM spans have greater attentional control (Kane, 2005; Kane & Engle, 2002). Moreover, the covariance between performance on the RAPM and the three-back-with lures test was largely explained by differential activity in a few brain regions implicated in attentional control. For the purposes of this paper, the most important region of activation was the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), also called the inferior frontal cortex, which encompasses Brodmann’s areas 44, 45, and 47. We now discuss the VLPFC and its function.\n\nThe Role of the Left VLPFC in Attentional Control\n\nFunctional neuroimaging studies show that activation of the left VLPFC increases with WM load (Braver et al., 1997; Glahn et al., 2002; Love, Haist, Nicol, & Swinney, 2006; Wolf, Vasic, & Walter, 2006), which strongly suggests that it is involved in attentional control (D'Esposito, Postle, & Rypma, 2000; Jonides & Nee, 2006). VLPFC neurons appear to promote attentional control by continuing to fire through periods of distraction and delay (D'Esposito et al., 2000; Dolcos, Miller, Kragel, Jha, & McCarthy, 2007; Jonides & Nee, 2006). In delayed memory tasks, the subject is to recall a stimulus after a delay. In such tasks, delay-sensitive cells in the VLPFC begin firing when the target stimulus is to be encoded and continue firing throughout the delay period (Funahashi, Inoue, & Kubota, 1997; Rao, Rainer, & Miller, 1997). Unlike delay-sensitive cells in other cortical areas, cells in the lateral PFC, especially the VLPFC, are resistant to distraction (Dolcos et al., 2007; Miller, Erickson, & Desimone, 1996; Miller, Li, & Desimone, 1993; Postle, 2006; Yoon, Curtis, & D'Esposito, 2006).\n\nWith respect to the study by Gray et al. (2003), the fact that differential activation of the left VLPFC largely mediated the correlation between performance on the 3-back-with-lures and the RAPM suggests that the region promotes the analysis of complex tasks by increasing attentional control and decreasing the risk of disruption.\n\nThe Role of Serotonin in Attentional Control\n\nSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) appears to influence attentional control, which should make it an important regulator of analytical reasoning. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), located in the midbrain, is the source of serotonergic neurons that project to cortical and limbic areas (Amat et al., 2005; Barnes & Sharp, 1999). While there are 15 identified serotonin receptors (Albert & Lemonde, 2004; Barnes & Sharp, 1999), of primary importance to this paper are the 5-HT1A receptors. 5-HT1A receptors are found in two locations: (1) autoreceptors are found presynaptically on the soma of serotonergic neurons in the DRN that project to cortical areas; and (2) heteroreceptors are found postsynaptically on non-serotonergic neurons (Barnes & Sharp, 1999; Kia et al., 1996; Verge et al., 1986). 5-HT1A autoreceptors are inhibitory, so their activation inhibits the firing of DRN neurons (Sharp, Boothman, Raley, & Queree, 2007). The 5-HT1A heteroreceptor is present in the human VLPFC (Varnas, Halldin, & Hall, 2004).\n\nEvidence that 5-HT influences attentional control comes from a recent study involving the 5-HT1A receptor (Carter et al., 2005). Oral administration of psilocybin, a 5-HT1A activator (agonist), significantly impaired performance on human subjects’ ability to track an object in the presence of distractors, probably by activating the 5-HT1A autoreceptor, thereby inhibiting the DRN (Carter et al., 2005). Moreover, the effect was load dependent. The impairments increased with the number of objects that had to be tracked and kept in WM, which parallels the findings implicating the left VLPFC as WM load increases.\n\nSuch evidence suggests that attentional control is enhanced by activation of the DRN and increased transmission of 5-HT to the left VLPFC. This interpretation is supported by experimental research on how rats’ performance on demanding WM tasks is affected by lesion of the DRN (Harrison, Everitt, & Robbins, 1997), manipulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors (Carli & Samanin, 2000), and manipulation of post-synaptic 5-HT1A heteroreceptors in the ventral region of the medial prefrontal cortex (Winstanley et al., 2003). The ventral region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFCv) is a likely rodent homologue to the human VLPFC (Kesner, 2000).\n\nSummary\n\nAnalytically complex tasks are vulnerable to disruption, at least in part, because they have high WM loads. Maintaining such information in WM requires greater attentional control, which is regulated by the left VLPFC, serotonin, and the 5-HT1A receptor.\n\nHow Depression Promotes Rumination (Sustained Analysis)\n\nWe have argued that an important requirement for sustaining analysis is to minimize disruption of information in WM. We now argue that depression produces three types of changes in body systems that promote sustained analysis by reducing the risk of disruption ( ).\n\nDepression Enhances Attentional Control\n\nFirst, depression activates the left VLPFC ( ), which enhances attentional control and keeps information in WM when performing analytically difficult tasks. Neuroimaging studies of humans have consistently found that, relative to controls, people with experimentally induced depression or outpatient samples with episodes of major depression usually show a high neuroimaging signal in the VLPFC, with a tendency towards left lateralized activation (Drevets, 1999, 2000; George et al., 1995; Pardo, Pardo, & Raichle, 1993). As discussed above, the left VLPFC is activated during processing that requires high WM loads, such as analysis. Left VLPFC activity should therefore be crucial in maintaining the attentional control necessary to sustain analytical rumination in depression.\n\nSustained Neuronal Firing and Neuronal Apoptosis\n\nAs discussed above, attentional control is achieved by sustained neuronal activity in the VLPFC during periods of distraction or delay (D'Esposito et al., 2000; Dolcos et al., 2007; Jonides & Nee, 2006). However, the sustained activation of VLPFC neurons in depression is costly. Roughly 80% of cortical neurons release glutamate, an important neurotransmitter (Somogyi, Tamas, Lujan, & Buhl, 1998). High levels of glutamate in the synapse are toxic and can induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) (Hara & Snyder, 2007). Thus, while sustained neuronal activity in the left VLPFC is crucial to prevent disruption of analytical rumination, it carries a risk of apoptosis. Here, we argue that depression also coordinates processes that reduce apoptosis.\n\nTo reduce this risk, glutamate must be quickly cleared out of the synapse (A. L. Lee, Ogle, & Sapolsky, 2002). This function is accomplished by nearby astrocytes an abundant type of glial cell with processes that appose capillaries, neurons, and their synapses (Magistretti & Ransom, 2002). Astrocytes are the only brain cells where glycogen, the stored form of glucose, can be found (Magistretti & Ransom, 2002). Astrocytes take up glutamate from the synapse and convert it to glutamine in an energy dependent process (Magistretti & Ransom, 2002).\n\nUnder resting activity, neurons derive most of their energy from the metabolism of blood-borne glucose (Nehlig & Coles, 2007). However, as neuronal activity becomes more intense and sustained, energy must be quickly mobilized to sustain firing and to clear synaptic glutamate and convert it to glutamine (Pellerin et al., 2007; Shulman, Hyder, & Rothman, 2001a, 2001b). Under these conditions, there is an increasing reliance on the metabolism of astrocytic glycogen (Pellerin et al., 2007; Shulman et al., 2001b), the predominant product of which is lactate, the preferred energy substrate for neurons (Pellerin et al., 2007).\n\nThus, sustained activation of glutamatergic neurons in the VLPFC in depression is likely to be supported by the production of astrocytic lactate. We know of no pertinent studies in humans that directly show astrocytic lactate production in depression. However, support comes from studies of behavioral depression in rats, which is often induced by repeated exposure to uncontrollable stress (Vollmayr & Henn, 2003). Uncontrollable stress triggers sustained release of 5-HT to the mPFCv and sustained firing of mPFCv neurons (Amat et al., 2005). As the mPFCv is a likely homologue to the human VLPFC (Kesner, 2000), this may be analogous to sustained VLPFC activity in human depression. Moreover, repeated exposure to uncontrollable stress also causes astrocytic lactate production to increase in the mPFCv via the 5-HT1A autoreceptor (Uehara, Sumiyoshi, Matsuoka, Itoh, & Kurachi, 2006).\n\nThe Role of 5-HT in Depression\n\nSustained 5-HT transmission in depression may reduce apoptosis caused by sustained VLPFC activity by increasing lactate production. But it conflicts with conventional wisdom that human depression is characterized by low brain 5-HT (Maes & Meltzer, 1999). Depression is widely thought to involve altered interactions between 5-HT and its receptors, with the 5-HT1A receptor playing an important role (Sharp et al., 2007). Mutant mice lacking the 5-HT1A receptor show an ‘antidepressant’ (non-depressed) behavioral profile (Heisler et al., 1998; Mayorga et al., 2001; Ramboz et al., 1998), which strongly suggests it plays a role in depression. Moreover, 5-HT1A agonists have antidepressant properties in animal models (Albert & Lemonde, 2004). The 5-HT1A receptor is also implicated by evidence that it shows enhanced binding properties in the VLPFC of clinically depressed people (Parsey et al., 2006).\n\nHowever, the evidence for the low brain serotonin hypothesis is largely based on two circumstantial pieces of evidence (Albert & Lemonde, 2004). First, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) tend to be effective in alleviating depressive symptoms (Maes & Meltzer, 1999). When 5-HT is released into the synapse, it is taken back into the presynaptic neuron by the serotonin transporter molecule (Albert & Lemonde, 2004). Thus, the serotonin transporter tends to decrease extracellular levels of serotonin. SSRIs bind to the serotonin transporter, which inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, thereby increasing extracellular levels and increasing the binding to 5-HT receptors (Albert & Lemonde, 2004). Thus, depression is thought to be characterized by low levels of 5-HT because SSRIs have antidepressant properties and tend to increase synaptic levels of serotonin. Second, giving subjects diets that deplete levels of tryptophan, an amino acid needed to synthesize serotonin, tends to cause an increase in depressive symptoms, at least in subjects with recently remitted depression (Moore et al., 2000).\n\nHowever, several lines of evidence suggest that 5-HT is high in depression. First, as noted above, experimental research on rats has found that behavioral depression (induced by repeated exposure to uncontrollable stress) causes sustained DRN activity and 5-HT transmission (Amat et al., 2005). Despite some debate about their validity, rodent models of behavioral depression have been extremely useful in screening for antidepressant medications, identifying the phenotypic effects of genes, and testing neurobiological hypotheses about depression and other psychiatric conditions (Kalueff, Wheaton, & Murphy, 2007). It would be really surprising if the role of 5-HT in depression was functionally opposite in rodents and humans.\n\nSecond, SSRIs have multiple effects and it has been difficult to establish the precise mechanism by which they achieve their antidepressant effects (Hjorth et al., 2000). For instance, SSRIs also tend to activate 5-HT1A autoreceptors, which tends to inhibit DRN activity (Hjorth et al., 2000). Thus, the serotonin transporter binding and 5-HT1A autoreceptor activation properties of SSRIs tend to have opposing effects on synaptic levels of serotonin, which may partly explain why they usually take several weeks before they reduce symptoms.\n\nThird, there is variation in the serotonin transporter gene, with most people having either short (s) or long (l) alleles (Murphy et al., 2004). The variation has transcriptional and functional consequences, with the s-allele resulting in lower densities of transporter mRNA and protein, and slower clearance of 5-HT from the synaptic cleft (Murphy et al., 2004). By slowing the clearance of 5-HT, the s-allele mimics the serotonin transporter-binding effects of SSRIs. However, individuals with the s-allele are at greater risk of depression and anxiety, not less (Canli & Lesch, 2007), suggesting that depression is associated with high levels of synaptic 5-HT.\n\nFourth, a recent study of jugular blood flow in subjects with major depression found higher overflow of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) relative to non-depressed controls (Barton et al., 2008). 5-HIAA is the principal neuronal metabolite of 5-HT. Higher 5-HIAA overflow could reflect a clearing of 5-HT reserves from the brain, consistent with the low serotonin hypothesis. But this would not be a stable equilibrium (Barton et al., 2008). Clearance without a concomitant increase in synthesis and transmission would quickly deplete 5-HT and lead to an equilibrium in which 5-HIAA was lower in depressed subjects than in non-depressed controls. The prolonged nature of major depression argues against this interpretation. Rather, a more natural interpretation is that neuronal transmission of 5-HT is higher in depression (Barton et al., 2008). Moreover, the researchers found that 5-HIAA overflow was higher in subjects with the s-allele of the serotonin transporter gene. Since the s-allele tends to increase synaptic levels of serotonin, and is associated with a greater risk of depression, this further suggests that depression is associated with high levels of serotonin. Finally, 5-HIAA overflow was lower after treatment with an SSRI, consistent with studies reporting that a reduction in symptoms following SSRI treatment was associated with a reduction in 5-HIAA in the cerebral spinal fluid (Nikisch et al., 2004; Sheline, Bardgett, & Csernansky, 1997). This suggests that 5-HT production decreases with SSRI treatment (Barton et al., 2008).\n\nFifth, post-mortem studies have found that DRN cell number is higher, and 5-HT1A autoreceptor density is lower, in depressed subjects relative to non-depressed controls (Rajkowska, 2000). This suggests a greater capacity to transmit 5-HT in depression and less inhibition of serotonergic transmission.\n\nFinally, a PET neuroimaging study of brain activity following tryptophan depletion found that DRN activity was increased, not decreased (Morris, Smith, Cowen, Friston, & Dolan, 1999). This surprising finding directly contradicts the hypothesis that tryptophan depletion induces depressive symptoms by decreasing serotonin. We predict that lowering blood levels of 5-HT through tryptophan depletion deactivates the 5-HT1A autoreceptor, reduces the inhibition of the DRN, and increases serotonergic transmission to cortical areas.\n\nSummary\n\nThe distraction-resistant analysis of problem-related information that occurs in depressive rumination requires sustained left VLPFC activity. Based in part on evidence that behavioral depression causes sustained 5-HT release to the rodent homologue of the VLPFC and maintains neuronal activity there, we predict that brain 5-HT is high in human depression, not low. The sustained release of 5-HT to the VLPFC should promote the production of astrocytic lactate, sustain neuronal firing, and reduce apoptosis by supporting the clearance of synaptic glutamate.\n\nAnhedonia\n\nDepression also reduces disruption of rumination by inducing anhedonia (APA, 2000). The problems that depressed people face are often important, complex and difficult to solve, and sustained processing may not offer immediate reward. However, attending to activities that do offer more of an immediate reward (e.g., eating, sex, companionship) would tend to interfere with attempts to problem-solve. Anhedonia should promote uninterrupted rumination by reducing the motivation to engage in hedonic activities ( ). It should also have the effect of reducing exposure to such activities because they will not be sought out ( ).\n\nIf anhedonia reduces the salience of hedonic activities, then depressed people with higher levels of anhedonia should experience more focused and uninterrupted rumination. We know of no research testing this prediction. However, indirect support comes from research showing that those who score high in anhedonia tend to show a reduction in the amplitude of the P300 event-related potential (ERP) signals, which is often interpreted as evidence of a highly focused attentional state (Dubal, Pierson, & Jouvent, 2000; Yee & Miller, 1994). Such people may be ruminating about important problems in their lives that require sustained processing.\n\nPsychomotor Changes\n\nDepression may also decrease disruption of analysis through psychomotor changes, including a preference for solitude, fatigue, changes in appetite, and changes in sleep or activity patterns. Some of these symptoms can be easily seen to reduce exposure to distracting stimuli. For instance, social situations often demand attention, and this would tend to interfere with the depressive’s processing of episode-related problems. A preference for solitude would help the depressive avoid social interactions that could interrupt such processing.\n\nOther activities may similarly interfere with sustained processing. Sleeping is not conducive to analytical processing, although it may allow divergent thinking or unconscious processing. Consistent with this, depressed people who ruminate more tend to sleep less (Guastella & Moulds, 2007). Similarly, neurobiological evidence indicates that oral or buccal activity interferes with the processing of stimuli (Jacobs & Fornal, 1999). The reduced appetite often seen in depression may sustain processing by reducing oral and buccal activity.\n\nFinally, motor activity often requires cognitive resources to be devoted to how the body interacts with the environment. Psychomotor retardation might facilitate rumination by reducing the need to devote attention to the physical navigation of the environment and by keeping the depressed person in environments that are conducive to uninterrupted rumination. This predicts that symptoms of psychomotor retardation will be positively associated with more intense rumination. Indirect support for this comes from research showing that psychomotor retardation is positively associated with difficulty in attending to cognitive tasks in the laboratory (Lemelin & Baruch, 1998). As we discuss below, depressed people often have difficulty on laboratory tasks because their persistent ruminations about their personal life problems prevent them from devoting cognitive resources to laboratory tasks.\n\nFuture Directions\n\nThe AR hypothesis proposes that sustained left VLPFC activity is responsible for making depressive rumination intrusive, persistent, resistant to distraction, and difficult to suppress. The intensity of left VLPFC activity is therefore predicted to correlate positively with the intensity of depressive rumination. The DRN is predicted to be activated in depression and glycogenolysis is predicted to occur in the left VLPFC, especially during rumination, as this is hypothesized to reduce the risk of apoptosis that comes from sustained cortical activity.\n\nSurprisingly, we know of no research testing whether anhedonia and rumination are linked. The AR hypothesis predicts that they will be positively correlated in natural samples. Anhedonia is also predicted to be triggered by analytically difficult problems in a dose-dependent fashion, especially problems that are evolutionarily relevant.\n\nAnother issue arises from the fact that effective therapies often appear to promote activity that is opposite from the psychomotor symptoms that depressed people present. For instance, depressed people are often lethargic (DSM-IV-TR), but behavioral activation is therapeutic (Dimidjian et al., 2006; N. S. Jacobson et al., 1996). Similarly, depressed people often socially isolate (DSM-IV-TR), but talking therapies are helpful (Hollon et al., 2002). It could be argued that the fact that such interventions work suggests that it is counter-productive to socially isolate and be physically inactive when depressed.\n\nWe suggest that this is a puzzle only when one describes therapies and symptoms in imprecise terms. On the therapy side, the AR hypothesis predicts that is not physical or social activity per se that is therapeutic (although they may be palliatives that temporarily alleviate symptoms). Rather, physical and social activity are predicted to be therapeutic to the extent they help the depressed person solve the complex problem that caused the episode. For instance, behavioral activation is not simply about getting people up and moving about. It is based on behaviorism modification of behavior through punishment and reward, which makes it useful in problem-solving (N. S. Jacobson et al., 2001). Similarly, the efficacious interactive talking therapies we have reviewed CBT, EBA, and IPT have problem-solving components to them.\n\nOn the symptom side, the psychomotor symptoms that depressed people present are variable and may be more context-dependent and related to problem-solving than is typically appreciated. Depressed people can show lethargic or agitated activity patterns; they may sleep either more or less than normal; and they may have increased or decreased appetite (APA, 2000). The AR hypothesis proposes that some of the variability is a response to circumstances of the depressed person. Depressed people are predicted to exhibit psychomotor symptoms that make them stay put (e.g., lethargy) when in environments conducive to high quality, uninterrupted rumination. When in environments that are not conducive to rumination they are predicted to show symptoms that motivate them to search out better environments (e.g., agitation).\n\nThe preference for social isolation is also variable. In general population and depressed samples, most people prefer psychotherapies to antidepressant medications as treatments for depression, because they believe they will yield insight and help them solve their problems (Prins, Verhaak, Bensing, & van der Meer, 2008; van Schaik et al., 2004). Thus, depressed people don’t prefer social isolation in all contexts. In general, the AR hypothesis predicts that depressed people seek interaction with those that they perceive as trustworthy and willing and competent to give good advice. Because social dilemmas are likely to be causes of many depressive episodes, depressed people may be more likely to avoid those to whom they are closest, because these people are likely to be part of the problem. People who are depressed about social dilemmas with close social partners are predicted to be more likely to seek help from a therapist.\n\nThird Claim: Depressive Rumination Often Helps People Solve the Triggering Problem\n\nThis claim has not been thoroughly tested. However, there is one experiment directly on point, and other lines of evidence are interpretable in light of the claim.\n\nExperimental Evidence\n\nA study that attempts to tackle this issue experimentally must have a particular design. The laboratory task on which performance is to be evaluated must also be the problem that triggers depressed affect. We know of only one pertinent mood induction experiment. It explored the effects of mood in a simulated market where participants could buy and sell Deutsche Marks and Swiss Francs (Au et al., 2003). All participants were finance or economics students with knowledge of, or experience with, simulated or real financial trading. To help make decisions, participants were provided on each round with historically accurate charts about the daily closing prices in the last 3 years, and news items from the Dow Jones News Archive, which described influential market factors, how the market was moving, and comments from leading practitioners and economists from prominent investment banks. Careful analysis of this information would allow participants to make good predictions about the relative movement of Deutsche Marks and Swiss Francs. Performance was assessed by whether participants decided to buy or sell the correct currency on that round (accuracy), and how much money they gained or lost (profit), which in turn depended on accuracy and the amount invested.\n\nMood was manipulated by providing subjects with false feedback on the first round. In the positive mood induction, subjects received a high profit for their decision, regardless of what they actually did. In the sad mood induction, subjects took a substantial loss. In the neutral mood induction, subjects broke even. For all subsequent rounds, subjects’ payoffs were determined by their actual decisions and mood was maintained with positive, sad, or no music. People in positive moods made worse decisions by both standards: they were less accurate, and they lost more because they invested more. Sad participants made the most accurate decisions, but they tended to invest conservatively. Neutral participants were not as accurate as sad participants, but they received a higher profit because they invested more.\n\nThis experiment is very much in line with a model of depression’s causes and cognitive effects suggested by Weary et al. (1993). Subjects experienced an increase in sad affect when they received feedback that their causal understanding of their situation (the trading situation) was erroneous or in need of modification. Sad affect appeared to have focused their attention on the problem and helped them analyze it so that they could gain control over the situation. This experiment also explains why depressed people are sometimes cautious in implementing potential solutions (Lyubomirsky et al., 1999) (listed as a downstream effect in ). Caution is adaptive when uncertain about the cause-effect consequences of different options and making a mistake can make things worse. Because participants in the sad condition were unsure that their causal understanding of the situation was correct, they were conservative in their approach to the problem. But their processing of the problem led them to make more accurate decisions, because the problem was complex and required analysis.\n\nSocial Dilemmas\n\nAs discussed above, conflicts with cooperative partners appear to be particularly depressogenic. Is there any evidence that depression helps people resolve social dilemmas? Experimental research shows that people in depressed or sad mood states perform better in social dilemmas, because they show more context-dependent behavior and greater processing of information on costs and risks (G. Hertel et al., 2000; Hokanson, Sacco, Blumberg, & Landrum, 1980; Kirchsteiger, Rigotti, & Rustichini, 2006; Pietromonaco & Rook, 1987).\n\nTo make these points more salient, we describe one of these studies in detail. It involved a modified Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) game in which subjects played against each other in dyads (Hokanson et al., 1980). The PD offers players a choice between cooperating and defecting. The payoff structure provides an incentive for defecting, and, since the payoffs are symmetrical for both players, they both have an incentive to defect. However, the payoff structure is designed so that both players do better if they both cooperate than if they both defect (Axelrod, 1984).\n\nIn the usual PD, both players make their choices simultaneously. However, in this study, one player made his choice first (the low power position) and the other made his choice second (the high power position). The player choosing second is in the high power position because he knows what his opponent has chosen and can make the choice that optimizes his payoff on that round. Each dyad played 60 rounds. There was no monetary payoff subjects played for points.\n\nThere were three subject groups: (1) a non-depressed group (N); (2) a subclinically depressed group who scored high on a depression inventory (D); and (3) a group who scored high for fear or other problems (O). Subjects were then grouped into dyads. There were 10 N-D pairings, 10 D-N pairings, 10 N-N pairings, 10 N-O pairings, and 10 O-N pairings (the first letter refers to the low power position and the second letter refers to the high power position). Since O subjects did not play against depressed subjects, we do not discuss them any further.\n\nThe average scores for players in each of the pairing types are presented in . Several things about the results are worth noting. First, the highest scores were accumulated by non-depressed subjects in the high power position who were paired with depressed subjects (160.9 pts). However, their depressed partners in the low power position did almost as well, accumulating the second highest score (139.7 pts). Second, the worst scores were accumulated by non-depressed subjects in the low power position (−38.6 pts), but their depressed partners in the high power position did not do nearly as bad (55.0 pts). When averaged across these two pairing types (i.e., N-D and D-N), depressed subjects outperformed normal subjects (97.4 pts vs. 61.2 pts). N-N pairings did even better, but there were no D-D pairings to which they could be compared. Still, if the N-N pairings are included, the average score for the non-depressed only rises to 88.5 (i.e., depressed subjects still outperformed the non-depressed).\n\nTable 2\n\nDyadic PairingLow Power PositionHigh Power PositionN-N112.1119.7D-N139.7160.9N-D−38.655.0Mean71.1111.9\n\nThe differences in performance occurred because non-depressed subjects tended to cooperate regardless of whether they were in the high power position. In contrast, the behavior of the depressed subjects was more sensitive to position. In the high power position, depressed subjects tended to defect more; when in the low power position, they tended to cooperate more.\n\nIndeed, the studies exploring the effects on depressed affect in social dilemmas have all found that non-depressed subjects tend to cooperate regardless of their situation, whereas depressed subjects modulate their behavior with their situation in more rational ways (G. Hertel et al., 2000; Hokanson et al., 1980; Kirchsteiger et al., 2006). Specifically, depressed people are more sensitive to costs of cooperating than the non-depressed and are more likely to defect when it is costly to cooperate (G. Hertel et al., 2000; Hokanson et al., 1980; Kirchsteiger et al., 2006). This suggests that the depressed and the non-depressed may process cost-benefit information in different ways. Research explicitly exploring this issue has found that depressed and non-depressed people appear to give roughly the same weight to the potential benefits of an action, but the depressed appear to give greater weight to the costs (Pietromonaco & Rook, 1987).\n\nThat depression may help people solve social dilemmas is also supported by research on real-life dilemmas. When in conflict with close, cooperative social partners, people tend to show more sympathy, more support, and reduced aggression when their partner has depressive symptoms (Sheeber et al., 2001). The supportive response that the depressed get from their close social partners has led some researchers to argue that it reinforces depressive tendencies (Sheeber et al., 2001), which suggests that it may be useful in solving social dilemmas (Hagen, 1999, 2002, 2003; Hagen & Thomson, 2004; Watson & Andrews, 2002).\n\nProblem Analysis Rumination in Therapy\n\nAnother line of research that we interpret in light of the third claim involves a therapy developed by Adele Hayes and her colleagues that facilitates processing of episode-related thoughts and feelings (Hayes, Beevers, Feldman, Laurenceau, & Perlman, 2005; Hayes, Feldman et al., 2007). Rather than trying to prevent depressed people from ruminating, the facilitated processing aspect of the therapy encourages it by having patients write about their strongest thoughts and feelings about their depressive episode in a journal. Journal entries were later coded by third-party raters for avoidance and processing. Avoidance was defined as having difficulty facing disturbing emotions or thoughts, whereas processing was defined as exploring and questioning issues related to the episode, with some change in perspective or insight. Long-term improvements in depression were associated with a peak in the frequency and intensity of processing and greater insight, while peak levels of avoidance were associated with poorer long-term outcomes (Hayes et al., 2005; Hayes, Feldman et al., 2007). Moreover, the peak in processing was also associated with a spike in depressive symptomatology. Thus, the authors viewed the temporary spike in depression as a positive sign of growth and insight during treatment (Hayes et al., 2005; Hayes, Feldman et al., 2007; Hayes, Laurenceau, Feldman, Strauss, & Cardaciotto, 2007). This suggests that depression may enhance processing that promotes growth and insight into problems and may facilitate the resolution of the episode.\n\nWhile this research is correlational, controlled longitudinal experiments with subclinical and outpatient samples show that expressive writing about emotionally difficult topics facilitates the resolution of depressive symptoms over time (E. M. Gortner, Rude, & Pennebaker, 2006; Graf, Gaudiano, & Geller, 2008). Moreover, therapists rate their clients as having greater insight into the problems that they are working on in therapy (Graf et al., 2008).\n\nFuture Directions\n\nBecause it is crucial to the AR hypothesis, future research on how depression affects problem-solving should explicitly test how depressive cognition influences the triggering problem. As people with pre-existing depression will often have quite different problems, this issue may be best addressed experimentally. People who have depressed or sad mood triggered experimentally by an analytically difficult problem are predicted to perform better on that problem. The paper by Au et al. (2003) provides a model for conducting such experiments.\n\nWith respect to research on pre-existing depression, social dilemmas in which there is conflict with a close cooperative partner over a self-interested goal are particularly relevant. Effects on problem-solving can be assessed using longitudinal designs in which depressed people are randomly assigned to interventions that affect rumination: (1) antidepressant medications versus placebo; or (2) journal-based therapies that encourage depressive rumination versus therapies with elements that work against it, such as CBT. The AR hypothesis predicts that outcomes will be poorer for people assigned to antidepressant medications and therapies that interfere with depressive rumination. The crucial metric for assessing the outcome of a social dilemma is meeting the self-interested goal without breaking cooperative bonds.\n\nFourth Claim: Depression Reduces Performance on Laboratory T"
