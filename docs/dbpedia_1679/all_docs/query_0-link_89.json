        "text": "Naida Zukic\n\nProfessor\n\nSpeech, Communications and Theatre Arts\n\nEMAIL: nzukic@bmcc.cuny.edu\n\nOffice: S-628F\n\nOffice Hours:\n\nPhone: +1 (212) 220-8000;ext=7134\n\nDr. Naida Zukić is a Communication and Performance Studies scholar and Butoh artist. She teaches Media Studies, Intercultural Communication, Gender and Women’s Studies, and Public Speaking classes. Professor Zukić’s research highlights human ways of knowing as products of interlocking aesthetic, cultural, and political contexts, and examines the ways in which claims to authority—based on the reification of social categories—might be critically analyzed and challenged. Dr. Zukić has complemented her written scholarship on manifestations of global violence by the production of short digital films and Butoh performance pieces.\n\nExpertise\n\nEthics of Responsibility, Ideological Representations of Violence, Post-humanism, Digital Culture, Butoh Performance, Radicalism of Grief.\n\nDegrees\n\nPh.D. University of Minnesota, Rhetorical Criticism, 2005.\n\nM.A. Arizona State University, Critical Studies in Communication, 2001.\n\nB.A. Arizona State University, Communication Studies, 1999.\n\nCourses Taught\n\n3 CRS.3 HRS.NULL LAB HRS.\n\nCOM 255 (Intercultural Communication)\n\nThis course is designed to provide an understanding of intercultural principles and perspectives when communicating with people from diverse cultures. Consideration will be given to both verbal and nonverbal communication processes in the \"American\" culture, co-cultures, contact cultures, and popular culture. Through readings, lectures, response papers, and interviews, as well as through in-class discussion and exercises, this course will explore how culture shapes communication, how situations are framed through cultural lenses, and how histories, perceptions, values, contexts, aspects of stereotypes, and ethnocentrism all contribute to the complexity of intercultural communication. Prerequisite: SPE 100 or SPE 102\n\n3 CRS.3 HRS.NULL LAB HRS.\n\nSPE 100 (Fundamentals of Public Speaking)\n\nThe aim of this course is to develop effective skills in speech communication. The student examines how to generate topics and organized ideas, masters elements of audience psychology and practices techniques of speech presentation in a public forum. All elements of speech production and presentation are considered.\n\n3 CRS.3 HRS.NULL LAB HRS.\n\nSPE 102 (Fundamentals of Public Speaking for Non-Native Speakers)\n\nThis course is recommended for those whose native language is not English. It addresses fundamentals of speech communication, as does SPE 100, but provides special emphasis in vocabulary building, pronunciation, and enunciation. Classwork is implemented through the use of recordings, individual and group drills, interpersonal exercises, oral readings, and impromptu and prepared group discussions and speeches. Weekly speech tutoring is required. This course satisfies the equivalent for, and may be taken instead of, SPE 100. Credit is given for SPE 102 or SPE 100, but not for both classes.\n\n3 CRS.3 HRS.NULL LAB HRS.\n\nCOM 245 (The Mass Media)\n\nThe focus of this course is to provide an understanding of the influence and impact on our lives and society by the mass media. The course examines the history, law, technology, economics and politics of the mass media through independent study, field trips, etc. Students are encouraged to be aware of techniques of influence used by the mass media to influence and determine social and political values. In addition, students learn to develop tools for critical analysis of and standards for discriminating consumption of the mass media.\n\nPrerequisite: SPE 100 or permission of department\n\n3 CRS.3 HRS.NULL LAB HRS.\n\nCOM 265 (Gender and Communication)\n\nThe purpose of this course is to raise students? awareness regarding the ways in which gender is created, maintained, and/or changed through cultural expectations and interaction. Students will gain theoretical insights and develop analytical skills to identify gendered expectations, and to learn how such expectations serve to limit behavior for people of all genders. The course will enhance understanding of how predominant social assumptions and communication norms can devalue and silence women and other non-dominant groups, and how students can become change agents to enhance our collective lives.
