        "text": "“A good majority of movies that come out you pretty much know everything you’re going to see in the movie by the first ten or twenty minutes. Now that’s not a story. A story is something that constantly unfolds—I’m not talking about a quick left turn, or a quick right turn, or a big surprise— I’m talking about it unfolds . . . It’s not that I’m on this big crusade against linear storytelling, but the thing is it’s not the only game in town. My storyline [for Pulp Fiction] jumps all over the place, back and forward, and the thing about it is if I’d written Pulp Fiction as a novel and I was on your show you would never remotely bring up the structure. You would never bring it up. A novel can do that no problem. Novelist have always had complete freedom to pretty much tell their story any way they saw fit. And that’s kind of what I’m trying to do. Now the thing is for both novels and films 75% of the stories you’re going to tell will work better on a dramatically engaging basis to be told from a linear way. But there is the 25% out there that can be more resonant by telling it this way. Both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction gain a lot more resonance being told in this wild way.”\n\nWriter/director Quentin Tarantino (Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood)\n\n1994 interview with Charlie Rose\n\nScott W. Smith is the author of Screenwriting with Brass Knuckles"
