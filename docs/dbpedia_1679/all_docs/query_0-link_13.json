        "text": "Director: Stanley Kubrick\n\nProducer: James B. Harris\n\nScreenwriters: Jim Thompson and Stanley Kubrick\n\nCinematographer: Lucien Ballard\n\nMusic: Gerald Fried\n\nStudio: United Artists 1956\n\nMain Acting: Sterling Hayden and Coleen Gray\n\nLike most of Stanley Kubrick’s work, form and structure largely shape what makes The Killing so great. A caper/heist film molded in the same vat as John Huston’s earlier The Asphalt Jungle, it sets forth showing every last detail of the robbery from every possible angle. The movie brazenly shifts back and forth in a non-linear fashion with miniscule precision on how the robbery gets accomplished and how things inevitably fall apart. Each character is afforded a rich detailed background and given moments in the spotlight to let us know how they landed in such a precarious position. The examination of these noir characters is successful in opening up multi-dimensional nuances and making them come to life as real people with a desperate need for money and fortune. The character actors in The Killing are a who’s who of film noir. Marie Windsor (The Narrow Margin), Elisha Cook (The Maltese Falcon), Sterling Hayden (The Asphalt Jungle), Coleen Gray (Nightmare Alley) to name just a few, all seem to be cast in roles that Kubrick once saw each of them perform in other films. For most of them, they get to give one more great performance in a classic film noir before the final curtain drops on the whole movement. At times, The Killing feels like a lifetime achievement award for these thespians as they strut their stuff again one last time. The big difference is that this Kubrick film is no consolation prize, instead it breathes with vitality and greatness. In many cases, they are putting together their best performance in a picture that would contend with the greatest in which they have ever been involved.\n\nOn the surface, Sterling Hayden’s Johnny Clay is similar to his Dix Handley from The Asphalt Jungle. Hayden plays both parts with a steely straightforward toughness that gives forth an air of no-nonsense demeanor. The main difference for me is the fact that 1950 is no longer 1956. With Kiss Me Deadly the previous year, a certain irony or self-conscious streak was starting to creep into film noir. Johnny Clay has a certain cynical air to him that feels like he knows that in this type of movie he has no chance of getting away with the loot. As the final scene unfolds, Hayden’s expression at the airport is one where he is basically slyly winking at the audience, telling them, “I told you so.” He has none of the sympathy we feel for Handley. The apathy is pumped up exponentially and The Killing‘s final moments are of crushing defeat without a sense of emotional attachment. By this time, audiences knew what to expect from a noir and showing cynicism or total disconnect from the protagonist seemed probably like the most original thing Stanley Kubrick could employ.\n\nIt is interesting that even for this late-era film noir the femme fatale gets trotted out one last time and steals the show from all the hard-working men. Marie Windsor as Sherry is simply fantastic in her role as scheming wife of George Peatty (played by Elisha Cook as a sad sack ineffectual mope that he excelled at throughout his career). Sherry is George’s Sam Wilde, a stronger unstoppable force of bad mojo and greedy opportunism that the husband can’t contain or curb. In The Killing, Sherry is the superwoman of femme fatales as her duplicitous nature and drive for money not only destroys the sucker married to her, but every single male in his orbit. Her double crossing with lover Val Cannon is the primary reason the heist falls apart and leads to all the destruction. She is grade A trouble that in classic mode brings down everyone around her. She effectively kills about eight birds with one stone and a sneer. Her interesting poodle-like haircut hides a bite more compatible to a foaming-at-the-mouth pitbull.\n\nThe heist is intricate and well conveyed on screen. Lucien Ballard does a wonderful job as cinematographer. I have read that he and Kubrick clashed on the set and that Kubrick in many ways was actually responsible for how the movie looked as a finished product. Jim Thompson, who wrote The Killer Inside Of Me (which was butchered by Michael Winterbottom last year), mostly wrote the screenplay with Kubrick from the novel, Clean Break by Lionel White. As with most egomaniacs, the director tried to take all of the credit for the script and screw over his writing partner (a practice he would continue to attempt throughout his career) by only crediting Thompson with “additional dialogue.” Thompson, commissioned to adapt the White novel, was deep into alcoholism and needed the paycheck. He would eventually be asked to write Paths Of Glory (Kubrick’s followup to The Killing) and get treated with the same form of shrewd loss of public credit that was not uncommon from the great director.\n\nAs we all know, Kubrick would go on to make many classic films for the remainder of his life. Pictures like 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining need no introduction. He is for many, the greatest American director and on a short list of perhaps the most accomplished filmmaker of any region of planet earth. The Killing is only one of at least a half dozen films of his that often get labeled as a masterpiece. This was the beginning for Kubrick and soon the end for classic film noir. Thank god they happened to meet and intersect this one time to create the brilliant The Killing.\n\nI would also like to mention the uniqueness of Timothy Carey. Appearing in both The Killing and Paths Of Glory, the actor has the strangest screen presence I have ever seen. Fascinating and disturbing, you get the sense that he is not so much acting as just playing himself. A very odd and intoxicating blend of sinister mannerisms and goofball ticks and flinches."
