        "text": "Why choose Non Linear Narrative\n\nThe department is led by an international team of designers, programmers, filmmakers, artists and thinkers.\n\nEach year, in collaboration with governmental and non-governmental institutions and organisations, a small group of master’s students undertake research and present new visual forms of narrative.\n\nThe programme offers the chance to discover a wide, diverse range of research fields and practices, from design, photography, coding to filmmaking, as well as the possible interconnections in these fields.\n\nNon Linear Narrative offers a theoretical programme as a cornerstone to encourage context in research and practice.\n\nIs this study for you?\n\nDo you want to study Non Linear Narrative at KABK? Then the following most likely applies to you:\n\nYou have an investigative mindset and are keen to learn new ways of seeing and exploring the world as a researcher and practitioner.\n\nYou preferably have a design background with a bachelor’s degree in graphic design to prove that. Students from other disciplines with a demonstrated interest in and knowledge of design (for example architecture, film or journalism) are also welcome to apply.\n\nYou are not afraid of embracing new technologies and learning programming.\n\nYou are interested in the way our socio-political environments are designed, and ways that they can change."
