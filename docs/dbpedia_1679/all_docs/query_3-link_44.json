        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s \"Pulp Fiction\" is one of the most daring pieces of film to be released in the 1990s. The film, winner of the 1994 Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, is a prime example of post-modern art in cinema. Pulp Fiction is a postmodern crime thriller, which is also set apart from others of the same genre through its use of cinematically specific techniques. The film is told through three different narratives, told one after the other, each coming full circle and linking with one another in some way. This is a great example of how \"Pulp Fiction\" is an experiment in the technique and style of contemporary cinema. The importance of narrative and how information is relayed to an audience is a key focus of the film, and hence through manipulation and dissection of scenes, its underlying issues and evidence of this is revealed. The film deploys a vast array of artistic and cinematic techniques which are used to articulate its various messages to the audience. These techniques include narrative structure, character development, colour, use of the dark and light, sound design and a strong and meaningful intertextuality. In evaluating the film, one can see that a strong emphasis is placed on style, framing and coolness. The considering of \"Pulp Fiction\" as an example of what makes a good film and also the intent on making a successful film are both prevalent in the decisions made at a directorial and cinematographic level. The importance of cinematic technique in relation to the construction of a film narrative is the key to Tarantino’s \"Pulp Fiction\". In such, the technique used becomes a way of conveying messages about the narratives and this can be seen throughout the film. An example of this is to look at the scene where Butch (Bruce Willis) is preparing to escape from the city of Los Angeles. In an extremely well thought out sequence, various different techniques are employed with a sole intention. The use of point of view shots and a strong focus on Butch himself, create a clear image of his satisfaction and peace of mind with his decision to leave. This is further represented by the images of the empty apartment and the orange Camaro. Through clever use of cut transitions between flashback and current events, it is quickly brought to mind that Butch is in fact betraying gang boss Marcellus Wallace and this will ultimately bring conflict to what the viewer understands is Butch’s \"new found peace of mind\". This is further shown when the present day is re-established through a shot of Butch leaving his apartment, here, the viewer is given a visual on how the present narrative has been affected. At this point, it’s noted that the above example is only one of the simpler examples in which Tarantino’s use of technique is portrayed. The entire film is filled with instances where the pure manipulation of what is seen, compared with the order of events in the story, reveal a larger meaning behind the actual events which have taken place in a story. (Black, 2000)\n\n1.1. Background of \"Pulp Fiction\"\n\nReleased in 1994, Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction was instantly a hit and is still a cult classic. With its interconnecting story arcs and vividly unique characters whose lives dub towards speaking out of the ordinary philosophical fun bashing, which accentuates the gangster genre. Reviving the career of John Travolta, giving this film serious industry star power. This movie was fresh with memorable quotes, dark humor, a soundtrack with an old twist, and was all around a perfect shake from the generic movie formula. The appeal of Pulp Fiction is vast, but film buffs would especially appreciate the reuse of the classic genres and the film's influences on more recent movies. Now, we are going to investigate references and elements of Pulp Fiction in greater detail in terms of cinematically concerned attributes Tarantino used to define Generation X, the MTV generation. Rather than defining the generation as a whole itself, Tarantino's usage of nihilism, the feeling of being lost, sense of humor, and scattered values by using the term, \"That ought to be a goddamn shame what happened to that boy.\" This was also a film to show a change from the 80's to 90's culture, trying to reminisce in using 70's pop culture to define what the 90's would be perceived as in nostalgia. Pulp Fiction uses post-modernism in demonstrating a breaking away or making fun of the old styles of ways the old culture did in the outmoded youth of yesteryear.\n\n1.2. Importance of Cinematic Techniques in Filmmaking\n\nThere are various factors which constitute the progression of an effective storyline among the general public. Many people would agree that the most important aspect in creating a quality film would be a captivating storyline. Other factors that contribute to the progression of the story and add to the overall quality of the film are the characters involved, the special effects, and the soundtrack. But perhaps less obvious and less often considered by the average viewer is the importance of the cinematic techniques used by the director. Cinematic techniques help the viewer to understand the setting of the movie, the atmosphere, the mood, and the emotions of the characters involved. They are a very powerful tool in ensuring that the storyline progresses effectively and is certain to have a lasting impact on the viewer. If used effectively, cinematic techniques support the storyline and, in turn, the storyline is reinforced and becomes solid. If the visual and sound aspects of the film (the cinematic techniques) are not considered carefully, there is a risk of the movie coming across as unclear, disjointed, and disorganized. Hence, it is fair to say that for a movie to be defined as successful, full understanding of the storyline is crucial and is the defining line between a successful movie and a movie that is dismissed as unmemorable and/or unenjoyable. Considering that cinematic techniques are used to support the progression of the storyline and to add impact to the viewer, it is clear that they are an integral aspect of filmmaking. A good director will take the quality of the cinematic techniques into heavy consideration and understand that the role they play is just as important as the story itself.\n\n2. Cinematic Techniques Used in \"Pulp Fiction\"\n\nThis analysis of \"Pulp Fiction\" is based on the cinematography, the use of the various elements and themes, and the visual metaphors used throughout the movie. A possible explanation for the vivid and disturbing memory of \"rape scenes\" must be that the images are assaulting the visual senses and the brain processes these, relaying them into a visual memory. These are issues which will be addressed in this analysis. One of the most significant aspects of \"Pulp Fiction\" is the manner in which it is told through a circular sequence of events. The film begins and ends with the hold up of the coffee shop, and in between, the story unfolds in a series of long and short sections. This non-linear narrative structure can prove confusing for the viewer at first, but upon watching it again, it seems to unfold like a jigsaw puzzle, fitting the pieces together when they connect. Visually, there are two things to note about each of these long sections. Firstly, is the use of long takes and tracking shots, and secondly, the use of particular stylistic devices. The first long episode concerning Vincent and Jules and the events that lead from the meal at the coffee shop is framed by the tracking shot of the pair walking through the corridors into the apartment. This sets the momentum for the action to follow. The long take inside the apartment begins with a close-up of the mysterious black case, thus setting the precedence for a series of motifs and close-ups throughout the film.\n\n2.1. Nonlinear Narrative Structure\n\nIn \"Pulp Fiction,\" Tarantino achieves this linear sequence of events by breaking it up into differently ordered scenes, effectively jumping back and forth through time. He does this, as David Bordwell states, through the repetition of an event. At the beginning of the film, Jules and Vincent are seen retrieving a briefcase in the apartment of Brett and his friends, which contains a mysterious light. After this scene, the film shifts to the events that caused this retrieval, and then to the events of another character's life. After the viewer learns the mystery of the briefcase, the film goes back to the scene in which Vincent and Jules are dining at a cafe, and it is here where the film ends for Jules, who decides to retire from his immoral path of life and recites his favorite Bible passage. At this point, these characters never actually retrieve the briefcase, but the movie ends conclusively for Jules and veers off into another direction for Vincent, who is still alive. This sequence of events has effectively ended Jules' and Vincent's story in different contexts, but it ends on a more conclusive note for Jules.\n\n2.2. Long Takes and Tracking Shots\n\nLong takes and tracking shots were commonly utilized in the 1960s-1970s hit TV series \"The Mod Squad\" and the 1980s TV series \"Miami Vice.\" These long takes would involve a tracking shot that would follow one or many characters from behind. An example of this kind of shot in \"The Mod Squad\" would be if a character was exiting from the back entrance of a building, the camera would follow them from behind until they got to a vehicle and then the scene would cut to a different shot. A specific example from Pulp Fiction is a scene where Vincent and Jules walk into the Toluca Lake apartment owned by Lance and his wife Jody to buy heroin after Vincent gets off of work. This scene uses multiple long takes by following the characters from the front while they are walking and leads into tracking shots. This type of cinematography is effective in that it keeps the audience focused on the characters and dialogue with no cuts to other shots and the tracking shots give them a sense that they are right there with the characters following their every move. Another form of long take is when Mia is talking with Vincent at Jack Rabbit Slim's. The camera does not cut away from them throughout their entire conversation, creating an intimate feeling between them and keeping the attention solely on their dialogue. In addition, there are a few tracking shots in the film, one example would be when Vincent is walking to the bathroom at the aforementioned restaurant. These tracking shots are effective because they give the viewer a sense that they are also moving through the same space as the characters, it can reveal much about the location the characters are in, and it can also add tension or a mood to the scene depending on the context.\n\n2.3. Use of Dialogue and Monologues\n\nThe characters in Pulp Fiction are known for talking. Some speak so eloquently that they can be said to be orating. But it's interesting to note that upon closer inspection, the dialogue in Pulp Fiction is not at all excessive. In fact, what is most notable about this film is how often dialogue is not present. In many scenes where other films would use dialogue to convey information, Pulp Fiction leaves the dialogue out and instead uses action. This makes the dialogue that does occur in said scenes even more crucial and revealing to the characters. According to Tarantino's own thoughts on the dialogue, \"I believe the characters should say every thought that passes through their heads (and certainly in real life, a person never thinks 'I should not say that' before making a statement).\" The director has expressed a dislike for the way modern American movies have won over TV in that all ambiguity between characters must be removed for the audience to think them 'good guys' or 'bad guys'. This could be an explanation as to why his characters are often talking about trivial and mundane subject matter; in doing so, they reveal a greater humanity that makes them easier for the audience to relate to. A good example of this is the 'Royale with Cheese' conversation that takes place in the car travelling to hit on Brett, and reveals much the relationship between the two parties involved in said Vincent and Jules' good-natured, but professional.\n\n2.4. Visual References and Homages\n\nButch Coolidge, the aging boxer played by Bruce Willis in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, isn't just another punch-drunk palooka. For this multifaceted character, Tarantino has created a pop culture metaphor. Butch is every tough-guy-with-a-heart who has ever graced the screen, the warrior grappling with a life outside the danger zone. To flesh out this archetype, Tarantino uses various visual references to heighten the specific parallels between Butch and the many big-screen badasses he embodies. Perhaps the most profound of these allusions comes on the heels of Butch's decision to risk his life and his love for a valuable family heirloom. As he delivers a defiant monologue into the cellar door, his profile is starkly outlined by a light reminiscent of the one famously held by Robert Mitchum in Night of the Hunter. This kind of play with classic cinematic iconography is essential to the scene dissection of Pulp Fiction. Butch's story, heavily influenced by film noir, is rife with these thoughtful references. His jaded conversation with aging pug Fabienne takes place inside a seedy motel room straight out of the Robert Ryan Lizabeth Scott vehicle The Racket. Returning to this location later in a scene that parallels the struggle between Marlowe and Moose in the Big Sleep, Butch is forced to confront the absurdity of his situation when he discovers anally-fixated ex-nemesis Zed lying in wait.\n\n3. Impact and Influence of Cinematic Techniques in \"Pulp Fiction\"\n\nThe stylish, innovative techniques employed by Quentin Tarantino in Pulp Fiction dramatically changed the direction of contemporary cinema. His reshaping of traditional movie structure through the use of flashbacks, and by avoiding a linear narrative, fueled an interest in unconventional and fragmented storytelling. This is a trend that has been more readily embraced in the television industry, where such techniques are more readily accepted by a less conservative audience. The use of pop culture references in Pulp Fiction's dialogue inspired many other filmmakers to \"quote\" classic cinema in their work, and by doing so, to display their own breadth of knowledge of film history. This is a technique often employed by \"auteurs\" to establish their presence in a film. Finally, the heavy use of pastiche in Pulp Fiction (reconstructing historical genres through irony and innovation) has become more common in the post-modern age, as cinema becomes less and less about creating something new, and more about reworking the old in a new and interesting way. This ultimately suggests a film ahead of its time, and one that had a significant impact on the medium of cinema. The critical and public reception of Pulp Fiction was immense. It was the first independent film to gross over $200 million, and was the most talked about film of 1994, and is still a subject of discussion today. It won the highly prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes, was voted the best film since 1983 in 2008 by Entertainment Weekly, and is on the Sight and Sound Greatest Films list. This level of acclaim both solidified the film's contemporary impact and ensured it would have a lasting legacy in the cinematic world. The film remains a popular topic for academic critics, with emphasis often placed, for better or worse, on its perceived \"meaning\". Often Pulp Fiction is said to be discussing nothing, a claim deriving from the director's own statement that he was more concerned with style over substance. However, such a statement suggests a superficial reading of the film. Tarantino deftly manages to use his style to subvert audience expectations and question the values of contemporary society, which is more than can be said for many \"message\" films. This is often achieved by using irreverent or even casual dialogue to discuss weighty topics, an idea strongly at odds with the notion that the dialogue is there merely to entertain.\n\n3.1. Influence on Contemporary Filmmaking\n\nThe impact of Pulp Fiction was significant and extensive. The film has had an amazing influence on contemporary filmmaking styles and production. It revitalized John Travolta's acting career, made Uma Thurman a star, and gave Bruce Willis a much-needed hit. It is also responsible for the resurgence of film noir in the late 90s and has been parodied or paid homage in various mediums. But the impact on the filmmaking process was most important. The dialogue, the non-linear narrative, the irony, and the unique mix of violence and humor were all copied and became a popular formula for other filmmakers. More important is the success of the film and the effect it had on Hollywood. Major studio films with stars and large budgets like Pulp Fiction are the end goal for most independent filmmakers, and this film showed that it was a realistic goal. Major studios began to put more resources into independent film production, hoping to find the next Pulp Fiction. While the increase in studio alternatives for filmmakers can be viewed as either positive or negative, its effect on the independent film scene is largely negative. Early 90s independent cinema was a great movement with a wide range of films and great artistic freedom. The enthusiasm of Pulp Fiction allowed films like The Crying Game and the early work of the Coen Brothers to maintain success into the late 90s. But as major studios invested more in independent production, the scene became more monopolized and the creative freedom lessened. Higher budget studio independents and lower budget indies ensued a polarization, and it was difficult for truly unique and meaningful mid-range budget independent films to be made. This is the range where real artistic freedom exists and where cinema can see its most creative and daring work. This type of film has become increasingly rare and is one of the reasons why contemporary cinema is often criticized for not being what it once was.\n\n3.2. Reception and Critical Analysis of the Film\n\n\"Pulp Fiction\" is regarded by many to be a masterpiece of contemporary cinema, and indeed its impact and influence on the evolution of film has been far-reaching. Looking back on the film, much consideration has been given to analyzing what exactly about its style and form was so innovative. In terms of critical reception, especially by the American press, \"Pulp Fiction\" received overwhelming support, unlike the radical division in response seen with \"Reservoir Dogs.\" The film won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and in 1995 would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, establishing Tarantino as one of the preeminent talents in the film industry. In considering the innovations and impact of \"Pulp Fiction,\" it is necessary to look at how the film affected the work of other filmmakers and the genre of film itself. Immediately following the release of \"Pulp Fiction,\" a number of low budget independent films emulated its structure and style, evidence of the film's impact on those working within the American film industry. More importantly, \"Pulp Fiction\" altered the direction and style of mainstream Hollywood film and television in a manner that has had lasting implications. In the case of television, the film's fragmented narrative structure and \"cliffhanger\" scene endings on \"unimportant storylines\" became common techniques used in television writing, especially for situation comedies. Notably, the popular series \"Seinfeld\" adopted this style in a number of episodes, and the television drama \"The Sopranos\" would use a similar narrative structure to great critical acclaim. In the realm of film, the impact of \"Pulp Fiction\" went beyond imitation of its style and narrative structure and manifested as a change in the way in which films were written and marketed by Hollywood studios. Although often sensationalized by the press, the excessive violence and dark humor of \"Pulp Fiction\" simply provided an excuse for Hollywood to promote and release films of a similar or more extreme nature under the guise of \"artistic\" and \"for mature audiences\" film. In doing so, a number of mainstream Hollywood films ended up simply imitating the superficial aspects of Pulp Fiction (i.e. excessive violence, disjointed narrative structure) and thus failed to achieve the level of innovation and eloquence found in the Tarantino film. This however, had dire financial and artistic consequences for these films, a number receiving meager box office earnings and lacking critical acclaim. Case in point, the film Go, which though commercially successful and having a relatively positive critical reception, had numerous critics unfavorably compare it to Pulp Fiction, and was eventually forgotten in the shadows of the film it tried to emulate.\n\n3.3. Lasting Legacy of Tarantino's Cinematic Style\n\nLasting Legacy of Tarantino's Cinematic Style Directed by the up and coming new director Quentin Tarantino in 1994, \"Pulp Fiction\" has been a controversial topic of discussion in its relation to violence, drugs, and the mafia. Nonetheless, the impact it has created through being different and innovative has led to a new generation of film in Hollywood. \"Pulp Fiction\" has paved new grounds in filmmaking. A key aspect of its lasting legacy is the effect it has on Hollywood by being involved in a new genre of film. The neo-noir film \"Pulp Fiction\" has ever since led to many directors including Guy Ritchie (Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) and many more recently, creating their own movies involving the mafia and crime. The term \"Neo-noir,\" the refreshing revisitation to a classic genre, was derived from \"Pulp Fiction.\" Ever since its release, it has influenced and inspired many more crime films that have been alterations from the classic crime movie. In addition to the lasting impact on Hollywood, \"Pulp Fiction\" has introduced a new and creative way of showing a film plot. Quentin Tarantino was renowned for his complex storyline. The storyline encompasses three different but intertwining plotlines about a fixed boxing match, the retrieval of a priceless accessory, and the encounter of a mobster and his wife. This is crafted by its outstanding non-linear storytelling. Steps are taken in scenes, disarranged to sustain excitement and lure the audience to keep thinking. This is the first film to have a storyline like this and has impacted the way films are told. Non-linear storytelling in films has grown ever so popular and has been a popular device featured in many more modern films, and most contemporary and non-linear movies can be said to trace their roots to \"Pulp Fiction.\""
