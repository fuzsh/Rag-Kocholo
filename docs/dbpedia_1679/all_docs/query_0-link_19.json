        "text": "It is widely assumed that time appears to be tensed, i.e. divided into a future, present and past, and transitory, i.e. involving some kind of ‘flow’ or ‘passage’ of times or events from the future into the present and away into the distant past. In this paper I provide some reasons to doubt that time appears to be tensed and transitory, or at least that philosophers who have suggested that time appears to be that way have included in ‘appearance’ everything that falls under the broad term ‘cognition’, i.e. mental processes of all kinds, including perceiving, remembering, imagining, and thinking. I argue that the tensed and transitory aspect of our experience of temporal reality is, firstly, subordinate to our experience of a world of persistent objects, secondly, in conflict with a popular conception of the nature of persistent material objects, and finally, an aspect of how we think about temporal reality than how we actually experience it. I support the last contention by a comparison with our experience of spatiality, which arguably has three distinguishable components: (i) ‘pure input perception’, (ii) ‘perceptual experience modulated by top down cognitive processes’, and (iii) a ‘pure representation of space’. For space, the modulation of our perception of space at any given moment can be attributed to our pure representation of space, but it is not clear to me that our modulated experience of time is influenced by a pure representation of time. Rather, the modulated experience of temporality, to my mind, is much more clearly an experience of continuous existence of the persisting objects that make up the world.\n\nSpeculative visual consummation of our environment as human need in which polemic visions of the future meet the romanticizing versions of the past, tends to furnish spaces while constantly slipping between the real and the virtual. Late 18th century optical devices, such as panorama, acted as proto-cinematic devices by their unique capacity to provide travels to the remote worlds in both their spatial and temporal displacements. Particular attention is dedicated to the role that panorama played in offering distant views in form of a 360-degree continuous viewing experience, to reflect on the modifying perception of space. Today moving images took over the role of the panorama in supplementing the real world with the virtual, and became part of our everyday urban environment offering a continuous experience of our reality. These problematic zones of simultaneous co-existing processes of temporal displacement of the spectator along the past, present and fictive times eschew any principle of linear temporality and have capacity to track their space-time relations. The illusions provided by such non-linear time flow read in its kairos dimension in comparison to the linear time of history read in its chronos dimension, were detected in the function of panorama to assemble 'views' from different contexts and places. Yet Bergson used the term virtual to describe the past and its relation to memory as we place ourselves within it. Given that it is then expanding into a present image, the panoramic experience will finally be stimulated. This said, the purpose of this research is to revisit Bergson's term dureé in order to discuss the modifying perception of space today through the panoramic experience. Katarina will conclude that the panoramic experience pays homage to the development of a visual language that constantly reexamines spatial relationships, objects, protagonists and physical constructions, only to approach the real-world situations in which external standards of time no longer apply and where 'the past' is sold in the manner of panoramic experience available at any time.\n\nThe process of temporal orientation was studied in 977 subjects. They had to respond to one of the following questions : &quot;What is (was, will be) the current (previous, next) month?&quot;, and to explain &quot;how&quot; they had come to answer as they did. In the majority of cases, temporal landmarks justifying the responses referred to the present, whatever the context of the question. The use of Future Landmarks increased from the beginning to the end of the month, and from the Previous Month question to the Next Month question. Response times varied with the type of temporal landmarks, and with the question context. On average, users of a Future Landmark responded faster. Results are discussed in relation to results of other studies using a &quot;days of the week&quot; scale. The different use of past, current and future landmarks supports a hypothesis that response identification depends on the functional importance of the landmarks underlying a spreading activation process"
