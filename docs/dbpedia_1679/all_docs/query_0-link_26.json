        "text": "Notes\n\n[1]Â For a comprehensive survey of interwar city symphony films, see Jacobs, Kinik and Hielscher (2018). In fact, apart from DÃ¤hne (2013), this edited volume can be considered as the first book-length publication and overview on the topic.\n\n[2]Â This conclusion, though, should not deny the importance of key texts such as DÃ¤hne (2013) and Weihsmann (1997), who made a start in changing this situation. This is also true for Bollerey and FÃ¶hl (2014).\n\n[3]Â They create these impressions by cinematic means.\n\n[4]Â Manovich (2013) also did pioneering work in visualizing Vertovâs films by digital means, as did Heftberger (2016) and the project âDigital Formalismâ. In fact, my methodology builds on both Manovich and Heftbergerâs research. Another relevant study, to which I will return later, is Olesen (2017).\n\n[5]Â This happens, among others, through cross-sectional editing and thematic clustering. I will come back to this.\n\n[6]Â I made use of ELAN 4.9.4. for Mac OS X. For the software and additional information see https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/ (last consulted on November 29th 2018).\n\n[7]Â In addition, it is possible to mark and define hierarchical relationships and dependencies between tiers and annotations, a feature I have not made use of in my study. In fact, this article discusses the way I used ELAN for my research endeavor, whereas there are more functionalities, including also the possibility to generate different queries or retrieve more complex annotation statistics. For a more general discussion of ELAN, see Melgar et al. (2017).\n\n[8]Â For the individual tools, see http://www.anvil-software.org/, https://www.advene.org/, and https://www.iri.centrepompidou.fr/outils/lignes-de-temps/ (last consulted on November 29th 2018). For a further elaboration of ELAN and other digital video annotation tools for film analysis, see Melgar et al. (2017).\n\n[9]Â This depends on the zoom factor of the timeline viewer. When the zoom factor is at its maximum (1000), the control buttons, which enable to go to the next or the previous pixel, will make the video jump ahead or back one millisecond. Of course, jumping from frame to frame would be more accurate, which corresponds to jumping ahead or back 41.67 milliseconds (in case of a framerate of 24 frames per second).\n\n[10]Â This is also an advantage of ELANâs computer-based analysis in contrast to an analogue film analysis. While an analysis of extremely fast editing is not impossible in an analogue way when working with the film material itself on a montage bench, or by using a VCR or DVD player (see Kolaja and Foster, 1965), ELAN facilitates such an analysis in a feasible and time-saving way. This, of course, could be made even more time-efficient when shot changes would be detected automatically. In fact, some of the tools, including Linges de temps, provide such an automatic or semi-automatic segmentation. However, according to my knowledge, there is no satisfactory tool including a reliable and error-free automatic shot boundary detection at this moment. Lignes de temps, for example, fails when it comes to extremely short segments, as is often the case in experimental films. Moreover, there is the general issue of fades, since the software cannot detect these soft changes. In addition, there is a crucial benefit of manually segmenting, to which I will come later in more detail.\n\n[11]Â I used the option of predefined vocabularies especially for filmic techniques and shot distances.\n\n[12]Â I also looked into camera angles, shot distances, camera and object movements. However, this was rather done in a selective way.\n\n[13]Â âShotâ is understood here as the basic unit of the film, being characterized by a unity of time and space, a continuously exposed and uncut piece of film â a series of film frames without cuts.\n\n[14]Â Shot changes included hard cuts, dissolves, fade-ins and fade-outs.\n\n[15]Â The digital video files used for the analysis (mpeg-4-films, codecs H.264, AAC, and QuickTime Text) had their origins in the following DVDs: Berlin, die Sinfonie der GroÃstadt and Melodie der Welt, Walther Ruttmann, 1927, 1929 (Edition Filmmuseum 39, 2008), Man with a Movie Camera, Dziga Vertov, 1929 (Image Entertainment, 1998), Masterworks of American Avant-Garde Experimental film (1920-1970), including 2K restoration of Manhatta, Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler, 1921 (Flicker Alley, 2015), and Avant-Garde 3: Experimental Cinema 1922-1954, including Rien que les Heures from the collection of the George Eastman House, Alberto Cavalcanti, 1926 (Kino International, 2009). Unfortunately, the Masters of Cinema/Eureka Blu-ray of Man with a Movie Camera (2016) had not yet been released when I started my analysis, which presents the new Lobster Film/EYE Filmmuseum restoration from 2014, the uncut, most complete, and full-frame version of Vertovâs film. It needs to be said that the digital video files as well as their source DVDs differ from the original 35mm film material in terms of absolute frame accuracy. As silent films were shown at rates between 16 and 24 frames per second, these original rates have to be âtransformedâ to the DVD standard of 25 frames per second (European PAL format) respectively 30 frames per second (American NTSC format), otherwise the films look speeded up. This film-to-video transfer happens either by interpolating frames, selectively and consistently repeating frames to convert to the video frame rate, or (in the case of a DVD based on a progressive frame by frame digital scan) by flags in the DVD instructing the player to generate extra frames during playback. I wonât go into more detail here but underline that I am aware of the issue of frame (inâ)accuracy with regard to digital video files and that ideally, one would aim to use frame-accurate digital versions of the films. However, for the purpose of my analysis of city symphoniesâ features, an absolute frame accuracy was not necessary. Therefore, I went with the âuncleanâ digital video files without aiming to eliminate the interpolated or doubled frames first â simply for pragmatic reasons. For a frame accurate process, see Jacobs and Fyfe (2016).\n\n[16]Â This double focus was also related to a further research sub-question: if the city symphony can be considered as a film genre or a film cycle. I approached this issue by using Altmanâs semantic/syntactic approach to film genre (1984) as a heuristic tool for the analysis, which resulted in a split of the analysis and city symphony features into visual motifs (the city symphony semantics) and structural patterns (the city symphony syntax).\n\n[17]Â In the analysis scheme, this is represented by the orange double arrows (see Figure 3).\n\n[18]Â In fact, the more detailed the level of annotating, the more difficult it becomes to identify greater motifs. In this regard, elements such as cars, trams, taxis and trains can be combined under the common denominator of modern means of transportation.\n\n[19]Â Moreover, the combination of the tier âimagery/visual shot elementsâ with other tiers, especially the row on shot distances, gives indications about the role of visual elements in the picture. Further aspects include shot length, position in the entire film, within a specific sequence etc.\n\n[20]Â More precisely, this âtab-delimited textâ export option allows to select specific tiers and present them in the resulting text file in separate columns per tier, including (if selected) columns for start time, end time and duration of segments or shots. The data and columns can easily be transferred into Excel spreadsheets by copying and pasting.\n\n[21]Â See http://www.cinemetrics.lv/index.php (last consulted on February 6th 2017). On the Cinemetrics tool and method, see also Heftberger (2016) and Olesen (2017).\n\n[22]Â Apart from the analysis tool, the Cinemetrics website actually also provides a growing database of films measured and analyzed with the Cinemetrics software by scholars all over the world. This database comprises shot length analyses of Man with a Movie Camera and Berlin. However, to guarantee comparability and accuracy, I used the data from all your films compiled in ELAN.\n\n[23]Â At least, this is the case in version 4.9.4. for Mac OS X.\n\n[24]Â He speaks about âthe visual correlation of shots,â âthe visual âintervalââ and âmovement between shotsâ that is montage. In fact, later he refers to the âmontage battle.â\n\n[25]Â Manovich developed the plug-in ImageMontage and the software extension ImagePlot for the open-source scientific visualization software ImageJ, which was originally introduced by the National Institute of Mental Health in the US. Following Olesen it âadvanced the combination of modern computation techniques with microscopy and gained widespread success in a broad range of disciplines in the natural sciencesâ [Olesen 2017,Â 168]. See also http://lab.softwarestudies.com/2014/03/how-to-visualize-4512-instagram-selfies.html (last consulted on July 20th 2018).\n\n[26]Â Normally the tenth frame was selected to avoid imprecisions in shot changes, fades etc. See also Heftberger (2016) and Manovich (2013) and their earlier analyses and visualizations of Vertovâs films.\n\n[27]Â With one second consisting of 24 frames or less (in the case of silent films).\n\n[28]Â The strong focus on the canon films as prototypical examples was particularly motivated within the greater objective of my dissertation: an examination and critical reflection of the city symphony historiography. Therefore, the analysis also takes historiography and the city symphony as the product it became throughout historiography as its center of focus: How can the city symphony be defined according to the construct it became in film historiography â and from there expanding to the greater corpus of these films, which have only marginally been mentioned in film history writings? Moreover, there was also a very pragmatic reason as the level of detail applied in the analysis of the canon films could not have been extended to a greater corpus of sixty to eighty-five titles.\n\n[29]Â Moreover, by arriving at a list of visual motifs and structural patterns â or semantic and syntactic features â shared by a great number of films, I could also fortify the idea of considering the city symphony as a full-fledged film genre rather than a limited cycle. Obviously, not every feature is present in every film, but this is precisely an observation that can be made for every film that is considered in the context of a broader genre.\n\n[30]Â For a complete overview and extensive discussion of city symphony features, see Hielscher (2018). Since my analysis focused on shared features of the canon films and the broader corpus (thus the city symphony phenomenon as a whole), it excluded the comprehensive examination of individual films and the filmmakerâs individual projects. This means also that individual intellectual arguments remained in the background, even though they make part of these films.\n\n[31]Â When discussing the revealing functions and capacity of the film medium to make things visible that are usually overseen, Kracauer refers to the âwealth of sewer grates, gutters, and streets littered with rubbishâ in Berlin before turning to Cavalcanti, who âin his Rien que les Heures is hardly less garbage-mindedâ [Kracauer 1960,Â 54].\n\n[32]Â Berlin, Man with a Movie Camera and Rien que les Heures all depict waste objects â quite often as atmospheric images. While Manhatta forms rather an exception, Strand and Sheelerâs film also depicts smoke as waste product of heating and the maritime industry.\n\n[33]Â Georges Lacombe even uses waste, waste collection and recycling as main theme and structuring element in La Zone (1928).\n\n[34]Â I identified these groups in ELAN by ascribing each shot to one of the following categories: (1) a single person visible in the shot, (2) two people, (3) a small group of three to ten people, (4) a larger group of up to fifty people, (5) a crowd of more than fifty people.\n\n[35]Â These texts particularly refer to Berlin and Man with a Movie Camera regarding the deliberate avoidance of intertitles. In terms of the refusal of staged scenes and hired actors, it is especially Vertovâs film that is highlighted, while Ruttmannâs film is often criticized exactly for the integration of staged scenes, most prominently by Kracauer (1947).\n\n[36]Â This modern urban street construction aspect belongs to the modern metropolitan streetscape in general since Haussmannâs restructuring of Paris.\n\n[37]Â More precisely, he opposes Manhatta and the American film avant-garde of the 1920s and 1930s with their longing for the cityâs (reâ)unification with nature to the European city films of that time, which, according to Horak proudly celebrate urbanism and the machine age and praise the urban environment âfor its excitement, speed, and modernity, with few references to nature, beyond its role in leisure-time activities for Sunday picknickersâ [Horak 1995,Â 35]\n\n[38]Â This becomes even more obvious in city symphonies like Regen (Joris Ivens and Mannus Franken, 1929) and Images dâOstende (Henri Storck, 1929).\n\n[39]Â Interestingly enough, this does not mean that they do not take tourism as a theme. All four canon films (as well as a handful of other titles) present hotels, guests and travelers. Also the famous arrival in the city, depicted in at least twenty-three films, can be seen in light of a touristic aspect.\n\n[40]Â The prologue of Rien que les Heures might have also contributed to this assumption, in which Cavalcanti states in intertitles that all cities are the same, once we ignore their monuments, and that his film does not claim to synthesize any city as it is only a sequence of impressions of the passing of time. Moreover, the notion of the generic and unspecific makes sense also in light of city symphoniesâ focus on streets and various means of transportation â places that AugÃ© (1995) would later call non-places without identity in the postmodern city. City symphonies anticipate these later non-lieux of post-modernity. Nevertheless, it should be added that there are also some rare remarks on urban specificity and recognizable urban and architectural constructions (see e.g. DÃ¤hne, 2013 and MacDonald, 2001).\n\n[41]Â In Berlin buildings receive a definition and recognition as city markers also via written signs and boards on their faÃ§ades, such as the Gloria Palast at KurfÃ¼rstendamm, the Hotel Excelsior, or the Pschorr-Haus at Potsdamer Platz. Vertovâs film also includes a couple of textual signifiers, by which buildings become identifiable, like the Lenin Club building and the Club Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (aka Lenin) at Odessa Station, the Kiev Proletarian Film Theatre the camera pans across, the All-Union newspaper building (the Izvestiya building), and the Bakhmetievsky district bus depot in Moscow. Going beyond buildings as specific markers in the city and taking a closer look at the street scenes in Man with a Movie Camera, it stands out that Vertov chose only five or six urban locations to which he returns repeatedly throughout his film â depicted in similar or (slightly) different camera positions. In this way, they become urban markers and specific locations too. One of these streets is Tverskaia Street in Moscow, the street with the Gorky banner spanning the street, which we see deserted in the morning and later with the traffic policeman doing his work. Nevertheless, the most recognizable location and landmark in Man with a Movie Camera remains the Bolshoi Theatre, which Vertov makes visually collapse by a split screen shot in the climax of the film, according to Tsivian a âsymbolic destructionâ [Tsivian 2004,Â 19] Though, he also presents it in the first minutes of his film as an urban signifier.\n\n[42]Â Nevertheless, even though Ruttmann, Cavalcanti, Vertov, Stand and Sheeler do include city markers and specific buildings, it needs to be said that they all exclude the most famous sights of their respective city/-ies at the time, including the Brandenburger Tor, the Statue of Liberty, the Louvre or Notre Dame de Paris, and Red Square with Kremlin, St. Basil Cathedral, and the Leninâs Mausoleum. Indeed, it is not the touristic city the films focus on, but certain landmarks and monuments appear as part of the citiesâ everyday life.\n\n[43]Â Moreover, there is a great variation of cities thematized in city symphonies. While the literature generally speaks about metropolises such as New York, Paris, or Berlin, city symphonies of the extended corpus also focus on somewhat smaller, mid-sized cities, including Rotterdam, Porto, and Ostend. In addition, the greater city symphony corpus also demonstrates that Vertovâs concept to cinematically merge and spatially organize the visual material of several cities into a newly created filmic city, was not picked up. It was only once more realized in Les Nuits Ãlecriques (1929), in which EugÃ¨ne Deslaw combines material of nocturnal Berlin and Paris.\n\n[44]Â Of course, this feature was most elaborately deployed by Joris Ivens and Mannus Franken in Regen (1929) as the entire film is structured around the visual impacts a rain shower has on the city. Regarding the canon films, Manhatta is an exception as wet streets cannot be identified due to the filmâs high camera angles, extreme long and panorama shots and great distance to the streets on ground level. Moreover, the depiction of wet (reflecting) streets is present in virtually all films of the genre that include street scenes at night.\n\n[45]Â Montage forms such as rhythmic, fast, associative, metaphorical and cross-sectional editing as well as experimental techniques like unusual camera angles, extremely short takes, kaleidoscopic images, split screens, multiple exposures and manipulations of speed increase and cinematographically (reâ)create the intoxicating and overwhelming impressions in the modern city. They underline particularly the frenetic pace, highly fragmented nature and the contrasting features of urban modernity and modern urban life. In so doing, city symphonies can be considered as visualizations of the theories of Benjamin (1999) and Simmel (1997) and their ideas about the modern urban shock experiences and the overstimulation of the senses.\n\n[46]Â We can find those vertical and horizontal city explorations and establishments of space also in at least twenty other titles of the extended city symphony corpus.\n\n[47]Â The city is spatially introduced by an arrival into that urban space. Berlin and Man with a Movie Camera present arrivals into the city by train; Manhatta starts with an arrival by a local ferry boat. Rien que les Heures presents a rather conceptual and vertical arrival into the city as in the prologue Cavalcanti shows maps (and miniature monuments), from which he cuts to a shot of the Place de la Concorde on street level. Moreover, he switches from the idea of general city life in the prologue to the specific portrait of Montmartre in the main part. These arrivals into the city, which often stand at the beginning of the films, are also a pragmatic way of getting a film on a topic as huge as the metropolis started.\n\n[48]Â There are rides through the city especially in Berlin and Man with a Movie Camera, such as in the horse-carriage-ride-through-the-city-and-filming sequence in Vertovâs film and nocturnal taxi rides in Ruttmannâs Berlin portrait.\n\n[49]Â In this regard, they also go together the aforementioned recognizable landmarks and monuments, which, too, add to such a sense of spatial orientation.\n\n[50]Â Berlin, Man with a Movie Camera, Rien que les Heures and Manhatta show this linear structuring element, even though not all parts of the day are presented and made equally explicit in all four films.\n\n[51]Â Manhatta is an exception as it does not apply this temporal structuring element. Moreover, it needs to be said that Rien que les Heures includes a certain linear narrative development as it shows several urban types and their doings in the course of one day presented in episodes with beginnings and endings, that happen one after the other. Though, it is an experimental and fragmented narrative structure as the different narrative threads constantly interrupted each other and the characters (and their stories) remain underdeveloped.\n\n[52]Â Of course, this also emphasizes the chronological day structure and is also interwoven with the aforementioned numerous shots depicting acts of opening and closing, arriving and entering, leaving and de-boarding, and (reâ)starting and stopping.\n\n[53]Â Indeed, while film itself as a time-based medium presents pictures one after the other in chronological time, city symphonies employ strategies to evoke the idea of simultaneity resulting in cross-sections across space.\n\n[54]Â In addition, there are also mini-narratives that further underline the logic of the narrative. In Man with a Movie Camera, for instance, there is the mini-thriller narrative of the cameraman getting stuck with his foot under the rails when the train is approaching or the story of the accident, the fire brigade and ambulance operations. An example from Berlin is the mini-narrative of the female flÃ¢neuses in the streets (there is a sequence of similarly looking women), which turns into the story of a woman (a cocotte) and a man coupling.\n\n[55]Â Manovich, in fact also points toward the interweaving of both logics as he describes Man with a Movie Camera not only as a film anticipating the database logic but also as a work merging âdatabase and narrative into a new formâ [Manovich 2001,Â 241â243]. Besides the âcatalog of subjects that one could expect to find in a city of the 1920s â running trams, city beach, movie theatres, factories ...,â and âthe most amazing catalog of film techniques,â there is also the narrative of modern urban life and the âgradual process of discovery,â which, according to Manovich, âis filmâs main narrative, and it is told through a catalog of discoveries.â Similarly, other city symphonies also include a narrative â the story of the city and modern urban life in a day â while they also present a cross-sectional database of modern urban material of the era between the wars.\n\n[56]Â The fortunate encounters with other scholars from the field of media studies and information science, particularly L. Melgar and A. Heftberger, introduced me to various digital tools and inspired me to investigate benefits and options of applying those tools for my own research purposes.\n\n[57]Â There are further interesting analysis methods and data evaluation/visualization types that could be very fruitful for a study of urban films. For example, in a cloud or network representation, relations between motifs could be highlighted or the manner specific features (reâ)appear in a number of films. Moreover, an online database project could be interesting, which would allow to provide access to findings and research results in an interactive and a rather non-linear way.\n\n[58]Â I refer here especially to the MS-Office package, including Word and Excel.\n\n[59]Â No doubt, an automatic shot detection would be more time-efficient, but it would also eliminate this empirical aspect. As important part of the analysis, the experience of segmenting and annotating in ELAN and the pure viewing observations are indicated in the center of the analysis scheme, contributing to both sides of the study of motifs and structures (see Figure 3).\n\n[60]Â Moreover, it also recalls the analogue film strip."
