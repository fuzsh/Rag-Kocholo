All rights reserved.\n\n8 Global citizenship at HP\n\nHP today overview Corporate accountability and governance Environmental responsibility Community investment and involvement Supply chain responsibility Key Message: Few companies can match HP’s legacy of good corporate citizenship. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were pioneers in recognizing that beyond making a profit, a company has a responsibility to enrich the businesses, lives and communities of its customers, partners, employees and stakeholders. For nearly 70 years, we’ve strived to be an economic, intellectual and social asset to each community in which we work and live. As HP has grown to become the world’s largest IT company, our commitment to global citizenship has remained core to our business strategy and ingrained in everything we do. We engage with and respect the interests of local communities. Above all, we understand that earning—and keeping—the trust and loyalty of those we serve depends on upholding the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Details: Corporate accountability and governance Global citizenship at HP begins with the highest ethical standards. Keeping the trust and loyalty of those we serve depends on doing business with honesty and uncompromising integrity. HP’s values are the foundation for our business practices and shape our policies and actions in areas of ethical conduct, personal data protection and responsible supply-chain management. We hold our employees, partners and suppliers accountable for their actions in all aspects of our business. HP was founded on the idea that integrity really matters, and we strive to reflect this every day. Environmental responsibility Environmental responsibility is a key element of global citizenship at HP and is vital to our long-term business success. HP is committed to reducing our own environmental impact, as well as that of our customers, partners and suppliers. We do this by providing products and services that are environmentally sound throughout their life cycle and by conducting our operations in an environmentally responsible manner. Community investment and involvement The third pillar of global citizenship at HP is community investment and involvement. Our founders began a tradition of investing back into the community the first year they made a profit. Today, the company continues to invest in local communities around the globe through product and cash grants, as well as through the actions of our employees. In addition, we are active members of the global community. We engage in dialogue with governments on the development of public policy and with nongovernmental organizations and other stakeholders concerned about social and environmental issues. HP’s leadership in global citizenship has helped differentiate our products and services, strengthen our brand and drive growth. Customers—enterprise, small businesses and individuals—are giving preference to companies distinguished by their positive contributions to the environment and society. More and more, being a good global citizen is good business, and HP is uniquely positioned to fulfill customers’ evolving expectations.

HP's strategic framework is built on HP continuing to invent and develop technology solutions for the customers we serve, capitalizing on industry trends and becoming best-in-class in the industry. Made up of three major components, the operating framework represents the interconnected levers we must focus equally on — cost efficiency, targeted growth and capital strategy — for HP to perform to its full potential. Detail: Strategic framework: From customer viewpoint with strategic framework as background Invent & develop technology solutions for our customers in 3 markets: Enterprise Accounts; SMB; Consumer Capitalize on 3 industry trend: Automated 24x365 lights-out data centers; Always ready, always on, mobile computing; Ubiquitous digital printing and imaging (more coming in later slide) Become best-in-class in the Industry by implementing: Disciplined on operational excellence; Efficient cost structure; a Go-to-market model HP’s operating framework requires us to work on three interconnected levers at the same time. These levers are growth, cost efficiency, and our capital strategy Cost efficiency: We need to be as efficient as we possibly can. We will work on lowering our expenses to improve not only our financial performance but to also improve our capital position. Targeted Growth: We want to be in markets that can scale and grow since we are now so large that we can’t invent our growth. We have elected to follow a strategy that capitalizes on our existing strength. In this way we can feed the $90 billion revenue stream that we have to sustain and grow. Capital: We need to align our resources with the capability we want to build and the best opportunities that we see in the market that will allow us to scale the company. In some cases, we will spend money to save money and will spend money to grow. An example is reducing our 85 internal datacenters to 6 new ones with greater efficiency in everything from data-warehousing to power and cooling costs. References: Transition: So that’s our strategic plan. But it’s important to look at that strategy in the context of the marketplace and what we see going on around us. There are a number of market trends that we see, but at the moment we’d like to look at three major trends we think are of crucial importance to our business over the next few years. Invent & develop technology solutions for our customers 1 2 Drive select industry trends Become the best-in-class in the industry 3 6/30/2019 Copyright © 2007 HP corporate presentation.

However, HP has chosen to focus on three areas where we believe our investments will build experiences and solutions that customers value and in turn offer the greatest opportunities for growth for the company. We believe these three trends track to important stages of evolution in the market. Each trend encompasses separate aspects, but it’s the relationship between the three that allows HP to leverage our broad portfolio to offer unique value to customers in all three areas. Detail: The three big trends we assume will happen between now and 2010 are: 1. Always connected mobile experiences: Customers face the challenge of connecting devices to the network and ensuring that all the digital assets (photos, audio, business documents) they’re buying and creating stay connected for anytime, anywhere access. Devices often don't work together at all at the moment. If you're very lucky you can get the contacts that are on your mobile phone onto your personal digital assistant. The market evolution around mobility involves a complex ecosystem of devices and services where a users’ content/data smoothly migrates across any device. CTO Phil McKinney calls this ‘liquid’ media: “liquid media means content becomes ever easier to move around.” Customers want to be able to use their notebook, phone or work desktop and have their data migrate with them — have everything be synchronized properly so they don’t have to think about it. To be able to use an airport kiosk or any other device and get the same type of access. Customers value the experience of connecting to services on any device at any time. Always ready, always connected mobile computing allows you to be much more spontaneous. You can breakdown the whole concept of an 8 to 5 workday. You can escape the idea of a fixed office. You can evolve beyond the idea of static workgroups. You can literally change the sociology of how work is done. 2. Digital imaging and printing: Of the 45 trillion A4 pages printed annually, only about 9% come from digital sources. Huge market opportunity for HP’s commercial printers like Indigo and Scitex. Customers face the challenge of moving quickly from analog to digital printing and imaging to take full advantage of the flexibility and lower costs of digital. Today, the technologies are mature. The presses are fast enough, the RIPs are fast enough, and the workflows are well established. The printing market is evolving is toward convergence of high-speed commercial and transactional printing, with IT-savvy commercial printers trying to increase their reach into their corporate accounts. We are also seeing a shift in how digital presses are marketed and sold. Instead of merely competing on technical specifications, manufacturers (and their customers) are looking at the overall cost of operation, workflow, and feeds and finishing options as part of the overall package. It’s becoming less about the productivity of an individual machine and more about the productivity of the printer’s larger production environment. Customers value the advantages of digital printing including: Print on demand – minimizing waste Simplified processes such as web-to-print Speed - ability to produce fast results Lower set-up costs, short runs and quick turn-around Emergence of large-scale commercial digital presses like the HP indigo product line 3. Next generation data center: Customers face the challenge of running high-cost islands of IT. The data center is the heart of a company. But the average data center has grown extremely complex. The market evolution includes the move away from running many smaller datacenters toward consolidation that allow companies to enjoy a lowering of cost from operations and human capital; a reduction of errors through automation, and IT that delivers business value, reacting in real-time to changes in the market or in business strategies. Customers value the experience of automated 24x7 lights-out computing. Through virtualization and automation, significant improvements will be seen in the ability of the data center to respond to dynamic changes brought by shifting workloads. NOTE: An elaboration of these Trends with examples of each is available in the HP Today Innovation Module: Transition: Let‘s take a look at a sampling of Innovations at HP that support the three main trends that we‘ve discussed.

Business outcomes is a very important concept and core to understanding this new era of business technology. The ability to line up everything inside of an organization in one direction to affect both top line and bottom line is how we measure business outcomes. There are three categories of business outcomes: Accelerating business growth Lowering cost Mitigating risk Speeding time to market is critical – faster you get products to market, the faster you can grow Improving decision making – having much better information available – can help you make decisions faster and grow faster Strengthening customer relationships, another way you can help accelerate revenue Lowering costs Lowering IT spend Returning shareowner value CIOs need compliance and need to lower IT risks if they run 80 percent of business processes IT risk is a business risk 6/30/2019 Copyright © 2007 HP corporate presentation.

Details: HP Software is the only IT software provider that helps IT leaders reduce the cost, time, and risk to business outcomes by automating all of the strategic functions of IT. Our end-to-end product portfolio helps companies govern and manage IT and optimize application quality, performance, and availability. HP’s business technology optimization (BTO) software is the industry’s most comprehensive suite of IT management software for automating key processes across critical IT functions, including strategy, applications, and operation. BTO Software helps CIO’s address their top strategic agenda, optimizing the business outcome of IT. Central to doing this is to make sure that IT initiatives are aligned. First, customers need to align organization’s strategic IT initiatives with business goals and priorities. Second, and just as critical, is to ensure functional IT initiatives—the ones different teams execute across organizations—aligned with strategic initiatives. To achieve this alignment companies need to optimize and automate teams’ functional IT initiatives such as demand and portfolio management, software quality assurance and performance validation, Business Service Management and ITIL/ITSM Service Management. And then organizations need to ensure these initiatives are working in a coordinated and collaborative manner to deliver the business results associated with the strategic initiatives on the CIO’s agenda.
