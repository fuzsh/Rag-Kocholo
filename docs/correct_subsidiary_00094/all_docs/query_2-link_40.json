        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nCarly Fiorina, the first woman ever to lead a Fortune 20 company, is considered one of the most powerful women in business. From July 1999 to February 2005, she had been the Chair of Hewlett-Packard (HP) board and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). After a controversial career with HP, she was terminated by the HP board. Her leadership style, management, personality, and decisions are really challenged. This paper seeks to explore the leadership of Carly Fiorina, concentrating on her strategic leadership and value-based leadership. This paper also looks at some of the changes that had been implemented by Carly during her leadership. The reason this paper chooses Carly Fiorina for the leadership analysis is because she is currently labeled as the world's second-worst CEO in company performance and governance since 2000, according to the 20/20 rankings on Chief Executive Magazine. She was the only woman in the top 10 worst CEOs. She also sits at number 10 in CNBC's 15 most disastrous tech company CEOs of all time. These harsh labels and rankings really attract us to further evaluate her leadership and what she had actually done. Although there are some obvious failures pointed to Carly, she did contribute to HP where her changes actually became a foundation and competitive advantage to the next CEO, Mark Hurd. We cannot simply say that Carly is a complete failure but a mix of success and failure in her leadership. Her period at HP is rich with events and HP has been in the fast lane of changes.\n\n2. Challenges Faced by Carly Fiorina\n\nBarriers and Challenges in Carly's Career at HP Carly Fiorina's illustrious career at Hewlett Packard was impaired with the impediment to overcome these barriers in order to be successful as a leader. These next several sections will identify the barriers and challenges and how she responded to them in her quest to change HP's fate. The first barrier she had to overcome was a divided management due to the effects of the Compaq merger. HP's acquisition of Compaq was the brainchild of Fiorina herself. This was seen as a way to quickly increase market share and thrust HP to the status of industry leader. During the time leading up to the merger, most of HP's management did not agree with the acquisition. Post-merger, there was great hostility and resistance to the new changes. Mark Hurd, who was hired in 2005 to succeed Fiorina (who was \"forced to resign\"), spoke in hindsight of the differences in management. \"What I found in the company, however, was two different businesses with two different models, with not a lot of synergies between them\". He goes on to explain how the company was not sure whether they wanted to be a low-cost producer of products or pursue higher-end, more innovative products. Because of the divisiveness of management, these lingering issues from the merger never had a clear resolution during Fiorina's reign. The differences in opinions between the two sides in many cases led to costly indecisive actions. One of the reasons for there being two different business models was the fact that HP had not successfully integrated the systems and processes of the two companies, which led to competition between the two sides and no clear direction for the company. This lack of unity was an unpropitious beginning to Fiorina's reign.\n\n2.1. Financial difficulties\n\nIn 2002, HP faced financial problems due to their merger with Compaq. Despite the fact that the majority opposed the merger, it eventually went through and marked Fiorina's strategy and idea in reviving HP. $15 billion in losses made them realize that they didn't have an effective strategy to achieve the potential synergy they were targeting from this merger. Seven quarters after the merger, the company still wasn't making any profit, which made the situation even worse. The reason behind this financial problem lies in \"the battle of power\". All management at that time had to allocate their time and resources to prevent themselves from being laid off and to protect their turf. This blocked crucial decision making, and the resource allocation towards potential projects was disrupted. With all the miscarriages in decision making, the steps they were taking were not concrete steps for recovering from the losses. The worst case was the layoffs of 30,000 employees, which indicated that HP was using the merger and cost reduction to overcome their financial problem. Carly Fiorina's financial strategy was not effective, as she used acquisition and merger as a medium to increase the company's market share without focusing on immediate profit that these acquisitions could give. HP acquired and merged with at least 10 significant-sized companies during her leadership in order to strengthen their position to compete in the industry. The biggest one was the merger with Compaq. Acquisition and merger were costing too much capital and resources, but the results were not worth enough compared to what they were spending. Usually, this leads to further loss in the company doing the acquisition step due to the high price of the target company. This continued to drag HP's financial problem and their inability to generate potential revenue from the business they were doing. The step that an acquisition should take is to increase the buyer's shareholder value, but this was not the case for HP.\n\n2.2. Cultural clashes\n\nCarly Fiorina brought a new corporate culture to Hewlett-Packard based on her experience from AT&T and Lucent. The HP Way emphasized consensus and respect for the individual. According to critics, Fiorina's contentious announcement of the merger and subsequent actions began cultural clashes which showed a lack of respect for the \"HP Way\" and its employees. This began with the manner in which the merger was announced to the public. The fact that the HP executives were not informed prior to the leak from Wall Street Journal shows Fiorina was not concerned with HP's employees or its reputation. She \"showed herself to be no friend of HP workers and their families - or their shareholders\" because the uncertainty which the merger caused led to a forty percent decline in HP's stock. Fiorina chose not to address the concerns of employees, merely stating the purpose of the merger was \"to create an $87bn company with the kind of resources required to lead in the Internet era.\" An international \"lights out\" meeting broadcast to all HP employees featuring Fiorina and Compaq CEO Michael Capellas was similarly vague. A French translator at the meeting symbolized the loss of jobs to some French HP workers and caused a nationalist uproar in France. This event and others like the sale of HP's Cupertino private golf course and retreat damaged HP's image with the local community and added to the alienation of HP employees. Evidently, Fiorina's cultural betrayal led to much hostility from her employees. An internal Compaq memo written by chairman, Ben Wells to his employees regarding the merger states \"Work hard. Pray. Let's bury these little HP sons of bitches. I want you to be successful and take no prisoners.\" This alienation extended to the HP/Compaq merger teams whose efforts and allegiance largely determined the success of the merger. An anonymous HR study of the Palo Alto HP and Compaq offices and other key cities after the merger found that HP employees scored consistently lower in motivation and satisfaction and higher in resistance to change compared to their Compaq counterparts. High turnover rate and increased union efforts were further signs of dissatisfaction. As a final indicator of her cultural impact, Fiorina's frequent ridicule in the media and inaccurate portrayal as a tyrant led to an increase in employee morale. Slipper photos of Fiorina in a dominatrix outfit can be perceived as an indication that she looked good in leather but did not call the shots.\n\n2.3. Declining market share\n\nFrom 1999 to 2005, HP experienced the most damaging market-share reversal in business history. At the dawn of the Fiorina Era, HP's market share was $25 billion and 31.5 percent in the PC market. HP was No. 1 in Western Europe and Japan, and No. 2 in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. By 2005, HP's share position had been lost in every region of the world. In the PC market, share fell to 15.5 percent. HP held the No. 1 share in just one segment, one that carried the lowest margins. Overall, share losses accounted for $9 billion of lost revenue. The way this happened is an object lesson in how overreaching and underperformance erode a company's competitive position. The problems began with the acquisition of Compaq. The proxy fight and its aftermath were massively distracting to HP's people, and many were in open rebellion against Fiorina's leadership. Several executives, both within HP and from the Compaq side, were given the choice of leaving or being fired. (Fiorina had no agreement with Compaq about who the acquirer really was, and hence no merger plan for either the business or the cultures.) The ensuing turmoil detracted focus from the business at the precise time that Dell was ramping up its own attack. The effect was a long period of organizational paralysis from both companies, but only Dell had the discipline to keep executing during that time. HP lost some leadership in the channel and lost some pace in the market. By 2003, HP's internal competition between printer and PC people became very destructive, and this internal conflict was obvious to the outside world. This was exacerbated by the fact that the printer business was enjoying healthy profits while the PC business was struggling to stay afloat. Operating under the theory that the printing and imaging division would bail out the PC division, HP bought a $19 billion business consulting company in a preemptive move against Dell. This furthered the divide between HP's strategic intent and its ability to execute a PC business that was shunned from the position on leveraging the company brand to improve margins.\n\n3. Strategies Implemented by Carly Fiorina\n\nThose strategies implemented by Carly Fiorina show her effective leadership and effort to bring HP back to its prime time. There were at least 4 major strategies implemented by Carly. She began by implementing several cost-cutting measures, for example, reducing the workforce and an across-the-board pay cut. She managed to reduce HP's costs by lowering its workforce and implementing an across-the-board pay cut. The pay cut was a big blow to the employees' morale, but Carly had set the standard at a top level through her actions, which shows she was not only concerned about the financial matters but also ensuring HP's survival. This was considered necessary to lower costs and increase HP's competitive edge through increased investment in R&D and sales and marketing to take share against IBM and EDS. After the cost-cutting measures, she boldly transformed HP when she decided to merge with Compaq, which caused great disagreement between HP's board of directors, shareholders, and the Walter-Hewlett family. There were several factors that caused the merger, such as both companies being a good strategic match with minimal customer and product overlap. Additionally, the merger could reduce costs and increase sales and market share to compete against IBM and EDS. Carly believed that this merger was the key to shifting HP from the specter of a growth company with very decent margins to a cost company with low margin costs. This was proven by hitting the targets set. HP achieved US$17 billion in gross annual cost synergies, and HP changed dramatically within a 3-year period after the merger. During her leadership in HP, Carly placed great focus on innovation as she believes innovation is the key to survival in the technology industry. She increased spending on the company's research and development and implemented new systems to allocate funds better to products that have the potential for high margins and to better monitor product development. This strategy has led to significant improvement in HP's next-generation products, especially the printer lines, and the results have been satisfying as they provide high margins to HP and are favored by customers. This criterion has pushed HP's board of directors to select high-potential products out of many and decide to invest more in the products to achieve better profitability. Last but not least, Carly tried to expand HP into new markets. She believes that aggressive moves into the market can give HP opportunities to gain a large share of the customer base. One best example is when HP made inroads into SAP's markets. HP has successfully gained a large share of big customers such as Nestlé and Unilever and become SAP's partner in supplying HP's infrastructure into SAP's solution. This move was considered successful as HP has succeeded in disrupting IBM, which is the biggest player in SAP's market, and the revenue was significant. This strategy was well done by leveraging the existing HP's products and strong relationships with customers, then trying to partner with third-party vendors or providers. This will give a new field for HP to explore and a chance to offer the best solution for customers.\n\n3.1. Cost-cutting measures\n\nCost-cutting measures were mostly implemented to bail HP out from its financial crunching position. The biggest decision taken during that period was the merger with Compaq, which was the handywork of Fiorina. From the merger, it was estimated that cost cuttings would take place ranging between $2 billion to $2.5 billion on a yearly basis starting from 2003, affecting the overall productivity of the company in a positive way. Another groundbreaking decision was taken to outsource the jobs related to product design and manufacturing to save costs and to use the same for research and development purposes. It was estimated that this action would facilitate HP with lowered overall costs by $24 billion for a period of six years from 2002 to 2008. But then outsourcing production of HP hardware products wasn't an easy task as it looked because during the fiscal year 2003, U.S. outsourcing cost the company with an impairment expense of $7.7 billion before tax and also loss of about 6250 employees. During the period, some of the business operations were completely shut like respective operations at Barcelona, Spain and also operations of HP in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, where the former decision would affect around 4500 employees while the latter would affect 500 employees. In October 2001, the management decided to cut costs by reducing the wages and salaries and also to implement a workforce reduction program. This would take place by implementing severe measures like job cuts and retirements. But all this had an adverse effect on the HP's employees' morale. At the end of the year, it was estimated that there were about 5000 employees that lost their jobs and were significantly affected by the workforce reduction program. A number of them were in a state of shock because the company had never done this in its 60+ years of history. But the decision paid dividends when HP saw its first profitable results at the end of 2002.\n\n3.2. Merger with Compaq\n\nMr. Fiorina has made two significant attempts to change the direction of the company from the previous CEO's. These strategic changes are an attempt to restore Hewlett-Packard to former industry dominance. Mr. Fiorina's first major strategy was to merge with Compaq. In order to reduce costs, the merger included plans for a layoff of approximately 15,000 employees from both companies. Mr. Fiorina argued that the merger was a strategic move that would place HP in a competitive position for the next generation of computing. There were plans for a shift in focus from the printer industry to computing and services. In a public statement to the press, Fiorina explained, \"The logic was all about transformation. It was all about moving from a company that had been largely a personal systems company; that was in fact split off from the printer company some years back. It was a recognition that the industry was consolidating.\" The merger was clouded in controversy as Walter B. Hewlett, the son of HP's co-founder, declared his opposition and attempted legal action to block it. The merger barely gained board approval and was also met with resistance from within the company, and the opposition eventually led to Mr. Fiorina's resignation. Mr. Fiorina's final strategy, which continued after the CEO position, was a renewed $3 billion attempt to overtake IBM as the leader in computing and services. The money was invested in products and development towards data storage, software, servers, and cloud computing. HP acquired several software companies and made a $13.9 billion purchase of Electronic Data Systems. Although the attempt showed initial success with HP momentarily surpassing IBM in revenue from servers, the plan was destined to fail with the end of HP's era of CEOs.\n\n3.3. Focus on innovation\n\nIn the wake of the Compaq-Hewlett-Packard merger, which created the world’s second largest computer company after Dell, Fiorina moved towards a strategy of focusing less on cost-cutting and more on differentiating HP from its competitors. She worked to improve the company’s global brand image, standardize its marketing and partner programs, and integrate its various lines of business. One of the most significant steps in terms of leading HP in a new direction was Fiorina’s decision to make changes in executive personnel in order to change the company’s culture. Fiorina maintains that HP had the “brainpower, the technology, and the resources to really make a difference,” but was in need of a revitalization of leadership. She sought to infuse HP with a soul and increase motivation and creativity among HP’s employees. In order to kick-start an initiation of innovation, Fiorina had Executive Vice President of the Technology Solutions Group, Ann Livermore, speak to HP employees in an effort to motivate them to take initiative and stimulate growth and momentum throughout HP’s various business units. Livermore called for innovation and risk-taking, stating, “If we ever had a time at HP to be more aggressive and to take more risks for competitive advantage, we have never had a better one than right now.” This new direction of leadership was said to be understood and embraced by HP employees. An internal survey revealed that 86% of HP employees understood the changes being made and believed they would benefit HP in the long run. Building on this momentum, Fiorina emphasized the importance of HP’s trademark invention and innovation, calling it the “true differentiator that will set HP apart,” and was committed to improvement of R strategic intent to shift in 5 years HP’s R spending from 4% to 6% of revenue, a move worth USD 2.5 billion over the next 5 years. This strategy was deemed as HP’s way of propelling to the forefront of the technology industry and setting the standard the rest of the industry will follow. Fiorina stated that she wanted HP to “reclaim its place as the recognized engine for innovation and invention.” This is a significant statement as HP was one of the most storied and innovative technology firms of the 20th century, and Fiorina’s efforts would be a push for HP to return to former glory in terms of innovation and invention. This focus on long-term research and high-end development was said to be one of HP’s key strategies to drive profitable growth. During Fiorina’s leadership, R&D increased by USD 900 million. With this new focus on innovation, Fiorina sought to make HP’s corporate culture more intuitive and less risk-averse in comparison to its old reputation of conservative decision-making and policy. This culture change and Fiorina’s focus on innovation are strong evidence that she was looking to turn HP into a true reflection of her vision and was steering it away from being the near-conservative company that it had always been.\n\n3.4. Expansion into new markets\n\nUnder Fiorina, HP began to make inroads into new markets. HP turned toward the digital camera market, with the Photosmart line. HP used the power of their printing platform in digital photography and on January 30, 2007, the official announcement was made for the merger between HP and the photo and imaging company, Shutterfly. This merger allowed Shutterfly's customers to have an easy link to the use of printing and photo products through the utilization of the HP design program, Snapfish. During this time, HP also produced the Agilent spin-off, and later decided to cut off the product line of the lower-end, to the middle of the line of electronic and scientific measurement instruments. Featuring today's best-known HP technologies, the division was sold through a public stock offering, and then purchased by the private equity firm, Silver Lake Partners. After the turbulent times that HP went through with the merger of Fiorina's time as CEO, the company began to stabilize and thrive in 2005. With the Fiorina \"HP Way\" and a history of all that Fiorina had accomplished at HP, Mark Hurd could get HP back to its original form, although rather successful. After his time, Hurd would follow his own path to success within HP. During his orientation time, Hurd would like to make an immediate fully criminal investigation of HP. Hurd chose to keep the investigation internally, thus causing a scandal which led to his resignation from the company. Though Hurd had no direct connections with Fiorina's old ways, HP was damaged by the decision of Hurd and HP would go through turbulent times once again. Today, HP thrives with the \"HP Way\" and new values. At the same time, still following some of the original plans and goals laid out by Fiorina, the company still has a long way to go to becoming the best in technology and a leader in the world. But Fiorina's visions and strategies still remain as some of the final stepping stones for HP to accomplish what it has always intended.\n\n4. Evaluation of Carly Fiorina's Leadership\n\nFiorina was the first outsider to become CEO of HP, and she had enormous positive impacts on the company. When she was sworn in, the US economy was unstable, and the dot-com bubble burst. Business was tough for a lot of businesses, including HP, with revenues dropping for both the years before she took the job. She began her work by resolving the confusions inside the company, such as the copier debacle. She had convinced the board of directors to license the basic technology of their printers to Japanese company Canon Inc. to create a low-cost light version of HP's laser printers. By 2004, HP had seen three straight quarters of growth, with revenues surpassing the pre-merger Compaq for the first time. Under her tenure, HP became the 11th largest US company in terms of revenue. This represents a success as she was able to grow HP significantly during a period where a lot of companies were struggling to maintain their business. A major strategic move she made to help the company was to force the merger with Compaq. Her rationalization was that the firm will have a faster rate of recovery, double the growth rate, and double the revenue and competitive cost structure. While many people criticized her for this, it is clear that it was a very successful move. From the implementation of Fiorina's 4-quadrant model, Compaq's sales experienced a substantial increase. The \"solution provider\" program was created to provide comprehensive support for channel partners; it increased the time partners spent with HP by 50%. Around 6 months after the merger, revenue was up by 8%, and there was profitability in both storage and servers, marking a turning point for the company. At the time of Fiorina's dismissal, the company was again experiencing growth with high rankings in the most recent quarterly PC server unit sales and both storage and server sales. HP was also the global market leader in personal computers. There is no criticism that HP's current success is derived from the Compaq merger, and given that it is the case, Fiorina's leadership has definitely created a successful turnaround for the company. She has made successes in efficiency and effectiveness. HP was able to achieve near-completion of merger integration within 1.5 years, faster than the average of similar merger integrations, indicating minimum time and resources wastage. Overall, although it was not a popular move, forcing the HP/Compaq merger has been a significant success for HP.\n\n4.1. Positive impacts on the company\n\nCarly Fiorina's leadership has brought significant turnover in HP history. Just in her first year as CEO, she put forth her vision for HP by pushing innovation and improvement that had been neglected by the previous leader, Lew Platt. She realized that customer satisfaction was of utmost importance if HP wanted to grow and increase shareholder value. To achieve this, she called for a meeting to analyze the situation at HP, collecting information from the entire company and centralizing it into a single dataset so that everyone could see and understand the true situation at HP. This phase was called the \"Honda phase\" by HP employees, standing for \"Honest Data Open Access\". This phase had a positive impact on HP, as employees could see and understand the true situation at HP, allowing everyone to work together to improve it. She also implemented sanctions, requiring first-line managers to prioritize meeting customer needs. Fiorina believed that by meeting these requirements, customer satisfaction would increase. Recognizing that knowledge is key to success, Fiorina also launched the e-initiative program. This program was a tactical plan to position HP as a leader in utilizing the internet. Fiorina believed that internet growth would be significant in the coming years, and leveraging the internet would provide tremendous benefits if implemented successfully. She allocated $2 billion from the company's savings for R&D purposes and changed the R&D culture, which previously focused solely on research without producing any tangible products. She aimed for a more advanced R&D approach, focusing on how to materialize the products that were conceptualized. This included building strong relationships and respecting customer needs, ultimately leading to a successful outcome. HP began producing a lot of new technology products, and the results of the R&D efforts were evident, as HP obtained patents at increasing levels each year while delivering new technologies that satisfied customers.\n\n4.2. Criticisms and controversies\n\nSome analysts, many of whom opposed the merger to begin with, concluded that the Compaq merger failed to deliver the promised synergies which Fiorina had stated as the primary motivation for the merger. Although the company regained the position of number 1 in PC sales for a short period, the company's market share remained smaller than that of a combined Dell and EMC. The merger was also met with strong opposition regarding the fact that the money and jobs would be better spent in a different market. In the end, the merger was concluded to be a direct failure by the HP board of directors, which has been criticized for causing the worst strategic identity crisis since the company's founding days. Many of the executives involved in the merger have faced strong opposition in their new places within the company and have been met with a substantial drop in their compensation packages. On February 9, 2005, the effects of Fiorina's tenure culminated in her removal as CEO by the board of directors. The controversial nature of her leadership style and the direction in which she was taking the company manifested in a record drop of stock price. In her six years as CEO, the company lost over half of its value and the stock traded at a mere $21 a share. After her removal, the company quickly rebounded with the stock trading in the mid $30s within a few months. This furthered the sentiment that the primary method to change the company's direction for the better would be to remove Fiorina from the top.\n\n4.3. Legacy of Carly Fiorina's tenure at HP\n\nThe legacy that Fiorina left behind was a very dynamic one, but it was also one that was marked by some negative features. The dynamic changes that she brought to the company were her main legacy and stemmed from her attempting to turn around the company from the state that she found it in. The $19 billion merger with Compaq was a move designed to cement HP's position as a market leader and it demonstrated Fiorina's desire to raise HP from the state that she found it in. The merger, however, was also a move that was forced through by Fiorina to the extent that it divided the board and to win shareholder approval, Fiorina had to conduct an unprecedented proxy fight. The eventual success of the merger was a victory for Fiorina, but it was also the final act in her turning around HP due to the fact that it set the company on a path towards being a leader in the industry, even though it was a path that would be continued without Fiorina herself. Fiorina also changed the culture and brand of HP. The merger with Compaq effectively ended the HP way and culture, with the Compaq staff going so far as to say that their company had taken over HP. Fiorina twice tried to create a new image of the company through marketing/branding campaigns, the first of these was the \"Invent\" campaign which was designed to shift the brand image of HP from being very much utilitarian and business-oriented to a more dynamic and consumer-oriented image. The second campaign was the \"+HP\" campaign and was designed to illustrate the new merged company, being an extension of the first brand change as well as an emphasis that the merger was a success. Two years after the second campaign, Fiorina stepped down as CEO, and given that brand image campaigns often have long-run effects, there is a possibility that this will be the HP brand that is remembered by many."
