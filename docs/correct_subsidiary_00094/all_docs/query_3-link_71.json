        "meta_description": "In a bruising computer hardware market, Hewlett Packard is edging ahead of the fierce competition with a combination of innovative products and smart, customer-targeted marketing. A12-by-18-foot, one-car garage has become the symbol of computer power to millions across the world – the single locale that changed the destiny of Silicon Valley. Curious as it may sound, if you attach the name Hewlett-Packard to this garage,the story rapidly unfolds. January 1, 1939: Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard embarked on a journey on 367 Addison Avenue, Palo Alto, California. It comes as no surprise that the garage where it all started has been given the status of a state-recognized landmark. Millions of dollars have been devoted to renovate it. From these nondescript beginnings to becoming the world leader in personal computers in 2006, Hewlett-Packard has come a long way over these past 68 years. HP has spread to over 170 countries with a dazzling array of products ranging from handheld devices to supercomputers. According to the IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly PC Tracker, HP recorded a 24 percent growth in annual sales last year and took a “clear lead in global shipment volume.” HP overtook traditional rival Dell, whose international growth dropped to 1.5 percent. The company is also now the world’s largest technology vendor in terms of sales, having posted $91.7 billion in annual revenues in 2006, just ahead of software giant IBM’s $91.4 billion. HP’s success comes despite a year pock-marked with a boardroom spying scandal and a soft US commercial market. The three IT majors – HP, Dell and IBM (now of course a software and consultancy firm after selling its PC hardware business to China’s Lenovo) have traditionally been locked in combat over market-share in the PC industry. GARAGE TALES Post-graduate students from Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard started their company with an investment of $538 which comprised cash and a used Sears-Roebuck drill press. Unsure about the company’s name – Packard-Hewlett or Hewlett-Packard – the latter was chosen after a coin toss. The first product HP manufactured was a resistance-capacitance audio oscillator,the HP 200A, an instrument that tested sound equipment. The critical portion of the circuit was a small night-light bulb. This enabled HP to sell the Model 200A for $54.40 while its competitors sold oscillators for over $200. Explaining the reason for calling the instrument the HP Model 200A, Dave Packard said:“Because we thought the name would make us look like we’d been around for awhile.” The Model 200A did stay around for many years with the design improving and the Model then being called the 200 AB. Incidentally, Walt Disney Company bought eight Model 200B oscillators for certifying the Fantasound surround sound systems for Fantasia. The deal was struck by a simple handshake which would be the manner of functioning for most HP deals for the next 50 years. The critical portion of the circuit was a small night-light bulb which enabled HP to sell the Model 200A for $54.40 while its competitors sold oscillators for over $200. All work was conducted in the garage and in the Packard kitchen oven where the panels for the first instruments were baked. In 1940, HP moved into rented buildings nearby. For the first time, employees were given a $5 Christmas bonus and another $5 was given to localcharities. In 1941, Hewlett decided to serve in the US Army and Packard ran the company till 1947. With the onset of the Second World War, the US government increased its orders for electronic instruments. When construction began in HP’s 10,000 square foot office, the founders decided to give it an open floor plan – commonly seen in companies today. Along with a better work atmosphere, Hewlett and Packard thought the site could double up as a grocery store in case their business failed. They also supported an employee’s family financially when he contracted tuberculosis, a precursor to HP’s health insurance plan, an unprecedented move at the time. Perhaps most importantly, Hewlett and Packard created a unique managerial style that came to be known as ‘the HP Way.’ Calling employers and employees by first names, designing open cubicles and executive offices without doors, and holding regular staff picnics,management by walking around’ involved good listening skills and the recognition that “everyone in an organization wants to do a good job.” Lucile Packard, Dave’s wife, said: “I guess the most important part about the HP Way, as I have felt it myself, is the fact that you were expected to do your job well; and expected to be able todo it. You were given the opportunity to do a good job and if you did a good job, you were given recognition for it.” She reached out to employees by establishing rituals like the company coffee pot, baked goods, planning company picnics and social activities such as the War Bond and blood drives. While Packard was busy getting HP off the ground, his wife would support the household with $90 a month which she said “wasn’t too difficult.” HP developed signal generators and a radar-jamming device for the Naval Research Laboratory in 1943. The company decided to stay in the microwave field which contributed increasingly to the firm’s business. In 1947,HP produced a catalogue showcasing 39 products and Packard convinced a New York trade show audience that“HP’s future appears very promising.” In 1951, HPinvented the HP 524A high-speed frequency counter which reduced the time required to measure highfrequencies from 10 minutes to 1-2 seconds. Five years later, HP’s first oscilloscope was rolled out into the market. In 1957, HP went public and the founders offered stock grants to its employees. Revenue by now had crossed $5.5 million and the number of employees reached 215. ‘The HP Way’ was documented with the company’s philosophy officially written down following a meeting of senior managers with focus areas of profit,customers, fields of interest, growth, people, management and citizenship. In 1959, HP went global. It established a marketing center in Geneva and a manufacturing plant in Boeblingen,Germany. Three years later, in 1960, HP’s corporate headquarters,set atop a 50-acre hill, was constructed repletewith a landscaped patio, horseshoe pits, volleyball and badminton courts, and a large cafeteria. Fortune for the first time included HP in its ranking of the 500 leading US companies. HP’s first computer, the HP 2116A, entered the market in 1966 and the company also expanded into Asia. The HP 5060A cesium-beam atomic clocks, also known as the “flying clocks,” gained recognition as they were designed to maintain accuracy for 3,000 years with a one second error. The clock became the standard for international time. The company’s research facility, HP Laboratories, was established and became one of the world’s leading research centers, giving birth to many innovative technologies including the famed memory spot chip. With a capacity to store 256 kilobits to four megabits of information, it could store short video clips and data with applications ranging from medicine to security solutions. They also supported an employee’s family financially when he contracted tuberculosis, a precursor to HP’s health insurance plan, an unprecedented move at the time.In 1951, HP invented the HP 524A high-speed frequency counter which reduced the time required to measure high frequencies from 10 minutes to 1-2 seconds. HP is credited with introducing the world’s first desktop scientific calculator, the HP 9100A, which performed scientific and engineering functions at least ten times faster than the normal rate. Interestingly,advertisements for the HP 9100A called it a ‘personal computer,’ one of the first documented uses of the term. Hewlett is believed to have said, “If we had called it a computer, it would have been rejected by our customers’ computer gurus because it didn’t look like an IBM. We therefore decided to call it a calculator, and all such nonsense disappeared. The HP-35, the world’s first scientific handheld calculator, brought in a new trend of portable computing. In 2000, Forbes ASAP called it one of the 20 “all time products” that changed the world. While the company was making technological strides, the concern for employer welfare grew and many new rules were established such as “flextime” at HP’s German center. In Packard’s words, “To my mind, flextime is the essence of respect for and trust in people.” MANY FIRSTS From the first electronic calculator to print Japanese characters to the first minicomputer to be based on 4K dynamic random access memory chips to the world’s first programmable pocket calculator and the HP-01 wrist instrument, a combination of digital wristwatch, calculator and personal calendar – the company kept making rapid technological strides. HP’s array of products continued to grow in number with its HP-150 Touchscreen and HP LaserJet. The latter became the company’s most successful single product line ever. After HP’s first personal computer, the HP-85,debuted in 1980, many models followed, including HP’s first handheld computer. When HP celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1989, the company recorded annual revenues of $11.9 billion and had employee strength of 95,000. With a firm focus on customer comfort, HP now introduced the 11-ounce HP 95LX, the first palmtop personal computer, the DeskJet 500C, the three-pound HP OmniBook 300 and the world’s brightest LED (lightemittingdiode). Through several technological triumphs and rises, HP has retained its unique brand of managerial skills. Longtime HP loyalists love to recall the stories of Hewlettand Packard roaming the halls of the company’s corporate headquarters, talking to employees about projects, the annual skiing holidays where the founders were often ribbed, workers being assigned to new jobs instead of being fired and how the work week was shortened to benefit certain workers HP is credited with introducing the world’s first desktop scientific calculator, the HP 9100A, which performed scientific and engineering functions at least ten times faster than the normal rate.The HP-35, the world’s first scientific handheld calculator, brought in a new trend of portable computing. Looking at the journey of the HP Way, Lucile Packard said: “I think the amazing thing is that it has been preserved over all these years. Which means that the people, who absorbed the meaning of it in the beginning, have been able to pass it on through all these years and through all these different countries. It’s really astonishing.” HP,over the decades, has adopted an aggressive strategy of acquiring other companies. The 5-person Data Systems, Inc., bought by HP helped the computer giant launch the HP 2116A in 1966. This machine marked HP’s foray into the burgeoning computer market. For $476 million, HP acquired Apollo Computers in 1989. The move helped HP garner a bigger share of the US market. In 1995,Convex Computer came under the HP umbrella. Two years later, Verifone too was bought but was then acquired by Gores Technology Group in 2001. Dazel Corporation, Bluestone, Indigo, PipeBeach, Snapfish, AppIQ, Peregrine, OuterBay, Silverwire, VoodooPC,Mercury Interactive and Knightsbridge Solutions were all bought by HP with the most recent acquisitions being of Bitfone in December 2006 andBristol Technology Inc. in January 2007. Compaq obviously was the big prize. Its acquisition in 2001 by HP changed the IT hardware game. HP bought the only-slightly smaller Compaq in a stock swap deal valued at $25 billion. The acquisition brought together two of the largest vendors of computers, computer servers and printers and placed HP just a smidgen below IBM (which prior to the Lenovo deal was the world’s largest computer firm) in annual revenues. It was one of HP’ smartest moves. In one stroke it had put itself in pole position to become the world’s premier IT hardware company while simultaneously dispensing with a potential rival. Once IBM got out of the hardware game, HP would have only Dell as a contender for the top spot. The deal was structured in a way that HP shareholders would have 64 percent of the combined company’s stock and Compaq shareholders would own 36 percent of the merged entity. Cost synergies were substantial – around $2.50 billion annually. Carleton “Carly” Fiorina, HP’s chairman and CEO, became the new company’s chairmanand CEO while Compaq chairman and CEO Michael Capellas took over as President. “Think of culture as norms of what’s important in the corporation. HP developed a culture for engineers at a time when lifecycles of products were longer. In the last decades, product lifecycles becae shorter and profit margins lower.The infrastructures were built for a different market.They were consensus oriented built for a different strategy.”The acquisition of Compaq was a key driver in HP’s growth strategy, but the real answer to the firm’s enduring success lies in its focus on three good, oldfashioned virtues: manufacturing,marketing and management. However, just over three years later, in February 2005,Fiorina was forced out of HP by the company’s board.The directors were unhappy with the performance of the merged entity. HP shares traded at 13 times 2005 earnings compared to IBM and Dell which traded at 17 times and 26 times 2005 earnings. The problem was that HP was being squeezed by IBM-Lenovo at the high end of the PC and server market and by Dell at the low end. But by mid-2006, HP’s top management led by new CEO Mark Hurd had fixed the problem with a slew of cost-cutting measures and innovative product launches.For the quarter ending July 31, 2006, HP’s profit surged to $1.38 billion compared to $73 million in the previous year’s quarter. Revenues too rose five percent to $21.90 billion as all the company’s main divisions – servers, PCs and printers – began to rev up. Hurd has pledged to cut 10 percent of HP’s workforce by laying off 15,300 employees and save up to $2.5 billion annually even while upping the pace of new product offerings. The markets smiled further when HP reported its earnings for the quarter ending October 31, 2006. Revenues were up seven percent year-on-year to $24.60 billion and profit rose smartly to $1.9 billion. HP was clearly back on track and seemed to have fully digested the Compaq acquisition. CHANGES IN HP’S FABRIC Many analysts, however, bemoan the loss of the ‘HP Way’ in today’s competitive global marketplace. Commenting on this phenomenon, Stanford Business School Professor,Charles O’Reilly said: “Think of culture as norms of what’s important in the corporation. HP developed a culture for engineers at a time when life-cycles of products were longer. In the last decades, product life-cycles became shorter and profit margins lower. The infrastructures were built for a different market. They were consensus oriented built for a different strategy.” Many insiders comment that the ‘HP Way’ became an impediment to decision-making with some employees saying the market window would keep shifting by the time the company would analyze and make the right decision.Several top management personnel have also been blamed for spoiling the traditional way by laying off people and motivating people through fear. HP has run into troubled waters recently over several issues. One of these includes the charge of supplying militarily useful technology to Iraq before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. Latterly, it also got on the wrong side of public opinion with its internal probe methods which were approved by the then HP chairman and board member, Patricia Dunn. Tactics included impersonating employees and business journalists covering the company to obtain their phone records. The episode led to several criminal and Congressional investigations. Dunn was eventually succeeded by CEO Mark Hurd. HP is keenly aware of the increase in competition in the global computer bazaar and has now taken to aggressively marketing its products. For instance,with cheaper store-brand inkjet printer cartridges, the world leader in consumer printers is feeling threatened. According to reports, HP has asked several stores to curb the practice of selling replacement cartridges. What lies behind HP’s sustained success over the decades? The firm does not have the cachet of Apple, the flair of Dell, the gravitas of IBM or the glamor of Lenovo or Toshiba. And yet, steadily and surely,HP has outpaced them all. The acquisition of Compaq was a key driver in HP’s growth strategy, but the real answerto the firm’s enduring success lies in itsfocus on three good, old-fashioned virtues: manufacturing, marketing and management. HP has always been a great believer in innovation right across the product manufacturing spectrum from the earliest HP audio oscillator 200A to the latest supercomputers.The firm has backed product innovation with smart but never over-hyped – marketing. This has helped give it a public image of solidity and dependability. Secondly,its management style has been “familial” – treating employees as an extended family but with patriarchal firmness so that laxity is never allowed to overwhelm efficiency. Finally, HP’s top management has always stayed ahead of customer expectation. As a result, its products are not only innovative but practical and they are marketed with ruthless efficiency. REVISITING THE ORIGINAL HP Hewlett-Packard has traditionally been regarded as the one of the tech industry’s most consistent performers. With the company portfolio embracing a wide range of products, ranging from $25 ink cartridges to multimilliondollar multimilliondollar supercomputers, the challenge before HP is to maintain the current tempo. Hurd is in no hurry to produce blockbuster products, choosing instead to focus on chinks in the system. “We need to temper the idea that this company has to have some earthshaking event every 15 minutes,” Hurd said in an interview to BusinessWeek. Any fear of the ‘HP Way’ dying forever is allayed with Hurd defending it strongly in the BusinessWeek interview:“It’s a real strength. When a company has the kind of passion that HP-ers have, it shows up not only inside the company in a positive way but it bleeds into how we support and treat our customers….History doesn’t predict the future. Just because you were good at something in the 1970s doesn’t mean you’ll be good at it tomorrow.But to the degree that it’s a foundation to build on, Ibelieve it’s a strength.” The change in HP’s management strategy has prompted many to believe that the golden era of HP has returned. “Bill [Hewlett] and Dave [Packard] were that way,” recalls Dennis Cain, a 32-year HP veteran, “Don’t talk about what you’re going to do. Just do it, and then let other people talk about it.” History doesn’t predict the future. Just because you were good at something in the 1970s doesn’t mean you’ll be good at it tomorrow. But to the degree that it’s a foundation to build on, I believe it’s a strength.” HP has the lineage, grit and vision to retain its iconic status provided it reads the future accurately. As Mark Hurd said at a Hewlett-Packard annual analyst meeting in New York: “The good news and the bad news is all one and the same: we have a lot more work to do.” That perhaps is the new ‘HP Way.’",

With a capacity to store 256 kilobits to four megabits of information, it could store short video clips and data with applications ranging from medicine to security solutions.\n\nThey also supported an employee’s family financially when he contracted tuberculosis,\n\na precursor to HP’s health insurance plan, an unprecedented move at the time.In 1951, HP invented the HP 524A high-speed frequency counter which reduced the time required to measure high frequencies from 10 minutes to 1-2 seconds.\n\nHP is credited with introducing the world’s first desktop scientific calculator, the HP 9100A, which performed scientific and engineering functions at least ten times faster than the normal rate. Interestingly,advertisements for the HP 9100A called it a ‘personal computer,’ one of the first documented uses of the term. Hewlett is believed to have said, “If we had called it a computer, it would have been rejected by our customers’ computer gurus because it didn’t look like an IBM. We therefore decided to call it a calculator, and all such nonsense disappeared.\n\nThe HP-35, the world’s first scientific handheld calculator, brought in a new trend of portable computing. In 2000, Forbes ASAP called it one of the 20 “all time products” that changed the world. While the company was making technological strides, the concern for employer welfare grew and many new rules were established such as “flextime” at HP’s German center. In Packard’s words, “To my mind, flextime is the essence of respect for and trust in people.”\n\nMANY FIRSTS\n\nFrom the first electronic calculator to print Japanese characters to the first minicomputer to be based on 4K dynamic random access memory chips to the world’s first programmable pocket calculator and the HP-01 wrist instrument, a combination of digital wristwatch, calculator and personal calendar – the company kept making rapid technological strides.\n\nHP’s array of products continued to grow in number with its HP-150 Touchscreen and HP LaserJet. The latter became the company’s most successful single product line ever. After HP’s first personal computer, the HP-85,debuted in 1980, many models followed, including HP’s first handheld computer. When HP celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1989, the company recorded annual revenues of $11.9 billion and had employee strength of 95,000. With a firm focus on customer comfort, HP now introduced the 11-ounce HP 95LX, the first palmtop personal computer, the DeskJet 500C, the three-pound HP OmniBook 300 and the world’s brightest LED (lightemittingdiode).\n\nThrough several technological triumphs and rises, HP has retained its unique brand of managerial skills. Longtime HP loyalists love to recall the stories of Hewlettand Packard roaming the halls of the company’s corporate headquarters, talking to employees about projects, the annual skiing holidays where the founders were often ribbed, workers being assigned to new jobs instead of being fired and how the work week was shortened to benefit certain workers\n\nHP is credited with introducing the world’s first desktop scientific calculator, the HP 9100A, which performed scientific and engineering functions at least ten times faster than the normal rate.The HP-35, the world’s first scientific handheld calculator, brought in a new trend of portable computing.\n\nLooking at the journey of the HP Way, Lucile Packard said: “I think the amazing thing is that it has been preserved over all these years. Which means that the people, who absorbed the meaning of it in the beginning, have been able to pass it on through all these years and through all these different countries. It’s really astonishing.”\n\nHP,over the decades, has adopted an aggressive strategy of acquiring other companies. The 5-person Data Systems, Inc., bought by HP helped the computer giant launch the HP 2116A in 1966. This machine marked HP’s foray into the burgeoning computer market. For $476 million, HP acquired Apollo Computers in 1989. The move helped HP garner a bigger share of the US market. In 1995,Convex Computer came under the HP umbrella. Two years later, Verifone too was bought but was then acquired by Gores Technology Group in 2001. Dazel Corporation, Bluestone, Indigo, PipeBeach, Snapfish, AppIQ, Peregrine, OuterBay, Silverwire, VoodooPC,Mercury Interactive and Knightsbridge Solutions were all bought by HP with the most recent acquisitions being of Bitfone in December 2006 andBristol Technology Inc. in January 2007.\n\nCompaq obviously was the big prize. Its acquisition in 2001 by HP changed the IT hardware game. HP bought the only-slightly smaller Compaq in a stock swap deal valued at $25 billion. The acquisition brought together two of the largest vendors of computers, computer servers and printers and placed HP just a smidgen below IBM (which prior to the Lenovo deal was the world’s largest computer firm) in annual revenues.\n\nIt was one of HP’ smartest moves. In one stroke it had put itself in pole position to become the world’s premier IT hardware company while simultaneously dispensing with a potential rival. Once IBM got out of the hardware game, HP would have only Dell as a contender for the top spot.\n\nThe deal was structured in a way that HP shareholders would have 64 percent of the combined company’s stock and Compaq shareholders would own 36 percent of the merged entity. Cost synergies were substantial – around $2.50 billion annually. Carleton “Carly” Fiorina, HP’s chairman and CEO, became the new company’s chairmanand CEO while Compaq chairman and CEO Michael Capellas took over as President.\n\n“Think of culture as norms of what’s important in the corporation. HP developed a culture for engineers at a time when lifecycles of products were longer. In the last decades, product lifecycles becae shorter and profit margins lower.The infrastructures were built for a different market.They were consensus oriented built for a different strategy.”The acquisition of Compaq was a key driver in HP’s growth strategy, but the real answer to the firm’s enduring success lies in its focus on three good, oldfashioned virtues: manufacturing,marketing and management.\n\nHowever, just over three years later, in February 2005,Fiorina was forced out of HP by the company’s board.The directors were unhappy with the performance of the merged entity. HP shares traded at 13 times 2005 earnings compared to IBM and Dell which traded at 17 times and 26 times 2005 earnings. The problem was that HP was being squeezed by IBM-Lenovo at the high end of the PC and server market and by Dell at the low end.\n\nBut by mid-2006, HP’s top management led by new CEO Mark Hurd had fixed the problem with a slew of cost-cutting measures and innovative product launches.For the quarter ending July 31, 2006, HP’s profit surged to $1.38 billion compared to $73 million in the previous year’s quarter. Revenues too rose five percent to $21.90 billion as all the company’s main divisions – servers, PCs and printers – began to rev up. Hurd has pledged to cut 10 percent of HP’s workforce by laying off 15,300 employees and save up to $2.5 billion annually even while upping the pace of new product offerings. The markets smiled further when HP reported its earnings for the quarter ending October 31, 2006. Revenues were up seven percent year-on-year to $24.60 billion and profit rose smartly to $1.9 billion. HP was clearly back on track and seemed to have fully digested the Compaq acquisition.\n\nCHANGES IN HP’S FABRIC\n\nMany analysts, however, bemoan the loss of the ‘HP Way’ in today’s competitive global marketplace. Commenting on this phenomenon, Stanford Business School Professor,Charles O’Reilly said: “Think of culture as norms of what’s important in the corporation. HP developed a culture for engineers at a time when life-cycles of products were longer. In the last decades, product life-cycles became shorter and profit margins lower. The infrastructures were built for a different market. They were consensus oriented built for a different strategy.”\n\nMany insiders comment that the ‘HP Way’ became an impediment to decision-making with some employees saying the market window would keep shifting by the time the company would analyze and make the right decision.Several top management personnel have also been blamed for spoiling the traditional way by laying off people and motivating people through fear.\n\nHP has run into troubled waters recently over several issues. One of these includes the charge of supplying militarily useful technology to Iraq before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. Latterly, it also got on the wrong side of public opinion with its internal probe methods which were approved by the then HP chairman and board member, Patricia Dunn. Tactics included impersonating employees and business journalists covering the company to obtain their phone records. The episode led to several criminal and Congressional investigations. Dunn was eventually succeeded by CEO Mark Hurd.\n\nHP is keenly aware of the increase in competition in the global computer bazaar and has now taken to aggressively marketing its products. For instance,with cheaper store-brand inkjet printer cartridges, the world leader in consumer printers is feeling threatened. According to reports, HP has asked several stores to curb the practice of selling replacement cartridges.\n\nWhat lies behind HP’s sustained success over the decades? The firm does not have the cachet of Apple, the flair of Dell, the gravitas of IBM or the glamor of Lenovo or Toshiba. And yet, steadily and surely,HP has outpaced them all. The acquisition of Compaq was a key driver in HP’s growth strategy, but the real answerto the firm’s enduring success lies in itsfocus on three good, old-fashioned virtues: manufacturing, marketing and management.\n\nHP has always been a great believer in innovation right across the product manufacturing spectrum from the earliest HP audio oscillator 200A to the latest supercomputers.The firm has backed product innovation with smart but never over-hyped – marketing. This has helped give it a public image of solidity and dependability. Secondly,its management style has been “familial” – treating employees as an extended family but with patriarchal firmness so that laxity is never allowed to overwhelm efficiency. Finally, HP’s top management has always stayed ahead of customer expectation. As a result, its products are not only innovative but practical and they are marketed with ruthless efficiency.\n\nREVISITING THE ORIGINAL HP\n\nHewlett-Packard has traditionally been regarded as the one of the tech industry’s most consistent performers. With the company portfolio embracing a wide range of products, ranging from $25 ink cartridges to multimilliondollar multimilliondollar supercomputers, the challenge before HP is to maintain the current tempo. Hurd is in no hurry to produce blockbuster products, choosing instead to focus on chinks in the system. “We need to temper the idea that this company has to have some earthshaking event every 15 minutes,” Hurd said in an interview to BusinessWeek.\n\nAny fear of the ‘HP Way’ dying forever is allayed with Hurd defending it strongly in the BusinessWeek interview:“It’s a real strength. When a company has the kind of passion that HP-ers have, it shows up not only inside the company in a positive way but it bleeds into how we support and treat our customers….History doesn’t predict the future. Just because you were good at something in the 1970s doesn’t mean you’ll be good at it tomorrow.But to the degree that it’s a foundation to build on, Ibelieve it’s a strength.”\n\nThe change in HP’s management strategy has prompted many to believe that the golden era of HP has returned. “Bill [Hewlett] and Dave [Packard] were that way,” recalls Dennis Cain, a 32-year HP veteran, “Don’t talk about what you’re going to do. Just do it, and then let other people talk about it.”\n\nHistory doesn’t predict the future. Just because you were good at something in the 1970s doesn’t mean you’ll be good at it tomorrow. But to the degree that it’s a foundation to build on, I believe it’s a strength.”\n\nHP has the lineage, grit and vision to retain its iconic status provided it reads the future accurately. As Mark Hurd said at a Hewlett-Packard annual analyst meeting in New York: “The good news and the bad news is all one and the same: we have a lot more work to do.” That perhaps is the new ‘HP Way.’"
