It explore how technology and services can help people and companies address their problems and challenges, and realize their possibilities, aspirations and dreams. Hewlett and Packard tossed a coin to decide whether the company they founded would be called H-P or P-H. Packard won the coin toss but named their electronics manufacturing enterprise the \"Hewlett-Packard Company\". The company originated in a garage in nearby Palo during a fellowship they had with a past professor, Frederick Terman at Stanford\n\nIndustry profile: Information technology (IT) is \"the study, design, development, implementation, support or management of computer-based information systems, particularly software applications and computer hardware.― IT deals with the use of electronic computers and computer software to convert, store, protect, process, transmit, and securely retrieve information. IT perform a variety of duties that range from installing applications to designing complex computer networks and information databases. It may include data management, networking, engineering computer hardware, database and software design, as well as the management and administration of entire systems. Information technology is a growing, wide spread, multi-tasking field required for the development of all other sectors.\n\nCompany profile Hewlett-Packard Company , commonly referred to as HP, is an American information technology corporation headquartered in Palo Alto, California, USA. HP is one of the world's largest information technology companies and operates in nearly every\n\n2\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED country. HP specializes in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware, designing software and delivering services. Mark Hurd joined HP in early 2005 as chief executive officer and president and was named chairman of the board of directors in September 2006. \"Everything we do must be for the customer. If it's not, then we need to reconsider why we're doing it.―-MARK\n\nVISION Enhance productivity of individuals and business Acting as a change agent. Leading edge research. Improve quality of life. Provide world wide access to information and infrastructure.\n\nRevenue chart of hp\n\nObjectives: HP strives to be an economic, intellectual and social asset to each country and community in which we do business. Earning customer loyalty and respect by consistently providing the highest quality and value. Market leadership by developing and delivering useful and innovative products, services and solutions. Uncompromising integrity by being open, honest and direct in our dealings. To invent the useful and the significant innovation. Recognize and seize opportunities for growth that builds upon our strengths and competencies. Attain Global citizenship to fulfill our responsibility to\n\n3\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED society by being an economic, intellectual and social asset to each country and community where we do business.\n\nStakeholder Facilitation Description We Sustainability has worked with HP since 2002, when HP joined our Engaging Stakeholders program. Since then our work has expanded to support HP‘s global citizenship strategy in numerous ways, including developing engagement strategies, obtaining and analyzing stakeholder inputs, providing executive briefings, developing competitive assessments and advising on HP‘s environmental strategies. In 2006, HP identified the need to establish an ongoing dialogue at the corporate level with sustainability thought leaders, to better understand external perceptions of the issues critical to society and their business. Together, HP and Sustainability conceived, designed and launched HP‘s Stakeholder Advisory Council (SAC). The purpose of the SAC, which met quarterly, was to provide independent, expert advice to HP on current and emerging corporate citizenship issues, including climate change, labor conditions, electronic waste, human rights, access to technology, supply chain management and privacy. The approach to corporate-level engagement further evolved in 2009, from a single group of individuals with general sustainability expertise to groups of advisers with more specific knowledge, the make-up of which would change according to the topics discussed. Sustainability helped HP to successfully navigate the change in approach, while at the same time creating the meeting design and leading facilitation. Both advisory structures have been effective mechanisms for corporate-level stakeholder engagement. The influence on decision-making was at times obvious (as in HP‘s decision to disclose its supply chain), but frequently more subtle or gradual. Each of the conversations powerfully impacted how HP thinks about citizenship and its business. In addition, the engagements have created and strengthened invaluable relationships for HP.\n\n4\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED HP‘s approach to corporate-level stakeholder engagement continues to evolve. In 2010, building on the strong foundation laid by the SAC and the Trusted Advisor Network, HP has established a global stakeholder engagement model and continues to raise engagement on sustainability issues to senior leaders throughout the company. Embedded in all of Sustainability‘s work with HP has been an ability to combine strong business acumen with knowledge of civil society perspectives on issues of concern to HP. Sustainability has pushed HP to go beyond its comfort zone, in the process enabling the company to strive for – and achieve – leadership in many aspects of its citizenship strategy. HP has frequently been acknowledged for its sustainability performance, achieving the status of ―America‘s Greenest Company‖ in Newsweek‘s 2009 ranking, and topping CRO Magazine‘s 100 Best Corporate Citizens list in 2010.\n\nHP Sets Strategy to Lead in Connected World with Services, Solutions and Technologies HP today shared its vision to provide seamless, secure, context-aware experiences for the connected world. HP Chief Executive Officer Léo Apotheker outlined a strategy for the company to continue delivering unparalleled value for customers and stockholders, while defining the future of information technology. HP is well positioned to win through a compelling combination of financial strength, unmatched scale and global reach, and market-leading positions that span from the consumer to the enterprise. The convergence of cloud computing and connectivity is fundamentally changing how IT is delivered and how information is consumed. Powerful trends like consumerization, cloud computing and connectivity are redefining the way people live, businesses operate and the world works. Traditional on-premise, proprietary computing resources are gradually being complemented and even replaced by the massive, agile and open computing resources of the cloud. Meanwhile, the cloud is combining with mobility to create ubiquitous connectivity. In HP‘s view, a hybrid environment that combines the best of traditional environments with private and public clouds will be the prevailing model for many large enterprises for a long time. With its leading services portfolio, HP is well positioned to be the trusted partner of customers as they move from the traditional to the hybrid world. Apotheker committed to continue enhancing HP‘s offerings across its broad hardware, software and services portfolio to meet evolving customer demands while also leveraging its core strengths to develop the cloud- and connectivity-based solutions of the future to meet the needs of consumers, small and midsize companies and large enterprises. This includes becoming a leading provider of cloud-based platform services.\n\n5\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED ―We see clearly a world in which the impact of cloud and connectivity is changing not only the user experience, but how individuals, small businesses and enterprises will consume, deploy and leverage information technology. HP is well positioned to be the trusted leader in addressing this opportunity,‖ said Apotheker. ― Apotheker outlined a four-point strategy for HP‘s expanded market leadership by extending its leadership in managing and optimizing today‘s traditional environments; leveraging HP‘s core strength in cloud to build and manage next-generation cloudbased architectures; being the trusted partner to customers by enabling the seamless transition to hybrid computing models; and by defining and delivering the connected world from the consumer to the enterprise. In his presentation, Apotheker examined the impact of industry trends on users and businesses, and how those trends can best be met through HP‘s portfolio, core businesses and scale. Of note in the speech: \n\n\n\n\n\nHP announced it intends to leverage its position as a leading provider of cloud technology to develop a portfolio of cloud services from infrastructure to platform services. HP also signaled it plans to develop and run the industry‘s first open cloud marketplace that will combine a secure, scalable and trusted consumer app store and an enterprise application and services catalog. HP intends to build webOS into a leading connectivity platform. As the world‘s No. 1 maker of PCs and printers, HP has the potential to deliver 100 million webOS-enabled devices a year into the marketplace, and HP plans to use that scale along with leading development tools to build a robust developer community that is eager to access every segment of the market and every corner of the globe. At the event, highlighting an increasing focus to bring innovation to market faster, HP demonstrated a new ―big data‖ appliance, leveraging the unmatched performance of HP computing power mated with real-time, high-speed analytics from Vertica Systems, which HP recently announced its agreement to acquire. HP expects to close the acquisition in its second fiscal quarter and have the HPbranded appliance ready for market immediately thereafter. The proposed HP Vertica solution will offer a choice of delivery options – from appliance, to software, and in the cloud.\n\n―The world has changed dramatically, and we increasingly live in a world where enterprise and personal IT experiences are blurring,‖ said Crawford Del Prete, chief research officer, IDC. ―More and more, it‘s about enabling customers to seamlessly and securely interact with the ‗right‘ information for a multitude of contexts. The technology and delivery models required to enable this change are significant. HP‘s strategy lays a foundation for the company to move from delivering world-class information technology, to world-class information experiences.‖\n\n6\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED\n\nStrategic priorities HP‘s strategy will be driven across a multitude of initiatives, focused on three strategic areas: Cloud: HP plans to build a full cloud stack and help transition customers to hybrid cloud environments. HP intends to leverage its scale, reliability and security in its current hardware, software and services offerings. HP also plans to grow its higher-value services that offer greater strategic value. A device-aware HP cloud will configure and send the appropriate services to the device that the customer is using, and connected devices will intuitively access services the customer needs. Connectivity: HP also intends to be a leader in the area of connectivity. HP already has a globally distributed installed base in both the consumer and enterprise, and ships two printers and PCs a second, which will be webOS enabled – this huge, growing installed base of devices provides enormous opportunity upon which to build HP-, customer- and ecosystem-driven innovation. HP and its ecosystem of partners will continue to provide context-aware experiences for consumers, SMBs and large enterprises with secure information creation, digitization, transformation and consumption — anytime, anywhere. Software: Through a build, buy and partner approach, HP intends to continue to enhance its leading management and security portfolio. Using that as a foundation, the company plans to address real-time analytics for ―Big Data,‖ which is the combination of structured and the much faster growing unstructured data set. Upon completion, HP‘s acquisition of Vertica will provide an important asset in this area. HP‘s digitization offering also provides important information management capabilities that can be\n\n7\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED verticalized for specific industries. HP will continue to invest in leading-edge technologies and services that go beyond today‘s limited point solutions to protect the modern enterprise and provide the security and information backbone that enterprises rely on for visibility and insight across distributed infrastructures and new hybrid environments. Concluding, Apotheker said, ―Information technology is the fabric of the global community. Data is the world‘s most valuable raw material and information is the most valuable commodity – created, consumed and delivered in always-on connectivity. At HP, our mission is to deliver seamless, secure, context-aware experiences for a connected world.‖\n\nAbout HP HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society. The world‘s largest technology company, HP brings together a portfolio that spans printing, personal computing, software, services and IT infrastructure at the convergence of the cloud and connectivity, creating seamless, secure, context-aware experiences for a connected world. More information about HP (NYSE: HPQ) is available at http://www.hp.com/. How is HP dealing with a challenging economy? Leading tech companies (including Intel and Cisco) believe that given the constraints of the economy today and the likely global recession, customer spending on technology will decline rapidly impacting both consumer and corporate purchases. Declining sales figures in October and November (2008) reflected on this fact. Hewlett Packard (HP) on the other hand has delivered a contrastingly optimistic forecast and expects significant growth with respect to the negative outlook for the coming quarter. How is it able to do so? A look at some components of HP’s business strategy:\n\nHP and its Business Strategy Wide Variety H.P. offers a wide variety of products to consumer and corporate customers which means that strength in some businesses can offset weakness in others. Repeat/Recurring Sales and Long-term deals HP’s stable revenues come from a large amount of recurring sales – about 40 percent (65 percent of its profits) from longterm deals.\n\n8\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED Declining sales of major printer and PC productsAt HP, printers are often sold at a loss. Fewer printers sold imply higher HP profits. On the other hand, PC losses have a marginal effect on H.P.’s overall profits. What the CEO and Analysts say? Mark Hurd, Chairman and CEO of HP remarked that HP’s ability to execute in a challenging marketplace helps it to differentiate against its competitors and therefore it is able to increase its market share and earnings. Other analysts opine that HP is a really well-run company particularly from a cost perspective. Cutting costs and layoffs The company was aggressively cutting costs and even began laying off workers (around twenty-five thousand) before the declining economy had its effect on the tech industry. HP is optimistic, but will it be able to match its 5 percent (approx.) growth in recent quarters. Given the economic gloom, at least it has done well competitively and probably will emerge from the current economic environment as an even stronger force.\n\nHewlett-packard company\n\nType\n\nPublic\n\nTraded as\n\nNYSE: HPQ Dow Jones Component S&P 500 Component\n\n9\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED Industry\n\nComputer hardware,Computer software, IT consulting, IT services\n\nFounded\n\n1939 (Palo Alto)\n\nFounder(s)\n\nBill Hewlett, David Packard\n\nHeadquarters\n\nPalo Alto, California, U.S.\n\nArea served\n\nWorldwide\n\nKey people\n\nRaymond Lane (Executive Chairman) Meg Whitman (President & CEO)\n\nProducts\n\nSee list of HP products.\n\nRevenue\n\nUS$ 127.24 billion (2011)[1]\n\nOperating income\n\nUS$ 9.67 billion (2011)[1]\n\nNet income\n\nUS$ 7.07 billion (2011)[1]\n\nTotal assets\n\nUS$ 129.51 billion (2011)[1]\n\nTotal equity\n\nUS$ 38.62 billion (2011)[1]\n\nEmployees\n\n10\n\n349,600 (2011)[1]\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED Divisions\n\nFinancing, Hardware, Services, Software\n\nSubsidiaries\n\nList of subsidiaries\n\nWebsite\n\nHP.com\n\nProducts and organizational structure HP has successful lines of printers, scanners, digital cameras, calculators, PDAs, servers, workstation computers, and computers for home and small business use; many of the computers came from the 2002 merger with Compaq.

For years, HP has produced and marketed its brand of enterprise management software, HP OpenView. From September 2005 through 2010, HP purchased a total of 15 software companies between as part of a publicized, deliberate strategy to augment its software offerings for large business customers. HP Software sells three categories of software: IT performance management, IT management software and information management software. HP Software also provides consulting, Software as a service, cloud computing solutions, education and support services. HP's Office of Strategy and Technology has four main functions: (1) steering the company's $3.6 billion research and development investment, (2) fostering the development of the company's global technical community, (3) leading the company's strategy and corporate development efforts, and (4) performing worldwide corporate marketing activities. Under this office is HP Labs, the research arm of HP. Founded in 1966, HP Labs's function is to deliver new technologies and to create business opportunities that go beyond HP's current strategies. An example of recent HP Lab technology includes the Memory spot chip.HP IdeaLab further provides a web forum on early-state innovations to encourage open feedback from consumers and the development community. HP also offers outsourced services for companies like Bank of Ireland, some UK banks, the U.S. defense forces, etc.\n\nCorporate social responsibility 12\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED In July 2007, the company announced that it had met its target, set in 2004, to recycle one billion pounds of electronics, toner and ink cartridges.It has set a new goal of recycling a further two billion pounds of hardware by the end of 2010. In 2006, the company recovered 187 million pounds of electronics, 73 percent more than its closest competitor. In 2008, HP released its supply chain emissions data — an industry first. In September 2009, Newsweek ranked HP No.1 on its 2009 Green Rankings of America's 500 largest corporations.According to environmentalleader.com, \"HewlettPackard earned its number one position due to its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction programs, and was the first major IT company to report GHG emissions associated with its supply chain, according to the ranking. In addition, HP has made an effort to remove toxic substances from its products, though Greenpeace has targeted the company for not doing better.\" HP took the top spot on Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for 2010. The list is cited by PR Week as one of America's most important business rankings. HP beat out other Russell 1000 Index companies because of its leadership in seven categories including environment, climate changes and corporate philanthropy. In 2009, HP was ranked fifth. In May 2011, HP released its latest Global Responsibility report covering accomplishments during 2010.The report, the company‘s tenth, provides a comprehensive view of HP‘s global citizenship programs, performance, and goals and describes how HP uses its technology, influence, and expertise to make a positive impact on the world. The company‘s 2009 report won best corporate responsibility report of the year. The 2009 reports claims HP decreased its total energy use by 9 percent compared with 2008. HP recovered a total of 118,000 tonnes of electronic products and supplies for recycling in 2009, including 61 million print cartridges. In an April 2010 San Francisco Chronicle article, HP was one of 12 companies commended for \"designing products to be safe from the start, following the principles of green chemistry.\" The commendations came from Environment California, an environmental advocacy group, who praised select companies in the Golden State and the Bay Area for their efforts to keep our planet clean and green. HP is listed in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks electronics manufacturers according to their policies on sustainability, energy and climate and green products. In November 2011, HP secured the 1st place (out of 15) in this ranking (climbing up 3 places) with an increased score of 5.9 (up from 5.5). Moreover, HP does especially well for its disclosure of externally verified greenhouse gas emissions and its setting of targets for reducing them.However, Greenpeace reports that HP risks a penalty point in future editions due to the fact that it is a member of trade associations that have commented against energy efficiency standards.\n\n13\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED After winning nine straight annual \"Most Respected Company in China\" awards from the Economic Observer and Peking University, HP China has added the \"10 Year Contribution\" award to its list of prestigious accolades. The award aims to identify companies doing business in China with outstanding and sustained performance in business operations, development and corporate social responsibility.\n\nMANAGERIAL POLICY With HP 3PAR Policy Manager Software, customers have the ultimate flexibility and control to allow or deny outbound communications or remote service connections to and from HP 3PAR Storage Systems at the customer site.

Proven across enterprises of any scale and complexity, HP’s policy-based model for software change- and configuration-management automates the entire software lifecycle-management process—from discovery, deployment, and ongoing management through to migration and retirement.\n\n15\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED The combination of dynamic provisioning for initial deployment and automated desired-state management for ongoing compliance is a key differentiator for HP’s solutions. By automating manual tasks and processes, HP helps enterprise IT organizations and service providers lower costs, reduce software-related problems, and keep the software supporting the business up to date, reliable, and secure. Whether driven by external requirements for regulatory governance or by internal requirements for security and software-patch compliance, business agility, or improved service delivery, every organization can benefit from an Adaptive Enterprise IT environment that is flexible and able to embrace and automatically manage change. For IT organizations, this means a constant motion of application deployments and updates, patch deployments and assurance, technology refreshes, PC migrations, and server consolidation. With each of these services comes the requirement to provision, reprovision, or update the software that powers business. Traditionally, IT has employed a semi-automated or task-based approach for managing software and software configurations. First, create an image or package an application, next create a software deployment script and a target list, next feed these into a software-deployment tool and have an administrator execute the task. When problems with the deployment occur, affected end users call the help desk and the list and script process is repeated until the software is brought into its correct, or desired, state. ―Software change and configuration management solutions that provide continuous automation of the full life cycle enable IS (information services) to align with changing business needs. By delivering application and infrastructure changes more quickly, timely and accurately, business can become more agile. Through continuous software configuration automation, IT organizations can improve reliability and repeatability, and reduce security risks for tasks done manually by over-extended staff.‖ ⎯ Ronni Colville, Research Director, Gartner\n\nA unique approach HP OpenView Change and Configuration Management solutions provide the answer. By substituting automation for manual intervention, IT organizations can dramatically lower IT costs, lower resource requirements, and increase software reliability. The HP difference\n\n16\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED Many solutions talk about automation, but why is HP’s solution different? The HP solution is, in fact, quite different. In contrast to task-based approaches to software change- and configuration management, HP solutions employ a unique approach to managing software—automated desired state management. Desired-state management In its simplest form, automated desired-state management works much like a thermostat. A ―Policy‖ is set on the thermostat—―keep the temperature in this room at 70 degrees‖—and the thermostat manages the temperature to the desired state, 70 degrees. If the room becomes too cool the heat is turned on until the desired state, in this case 70 degrees, is met. If the room becomes too warm, the air conditioning is turned on to bring the temperature back into a desired state. The thermostat continuously monitors the current state of the room and adjusts the temperature according to policy and desired state. Essentially, this is the way HP’s unique, automated desired-state approach works on software. Business management sets a policy requirement such as ―all workers in the sales group should have the latest version of Microsoft ® Outlook®‖ or ―every UNIX® server should have the latest software patch‖, and HP’s powerful solution makes it so. As software versions, user requirements, and device configurations change, the managed software and content is automatically reconfigured to correspond to the desired state, thus eliminating the need for manual user or administrator involvement. However, the value of automated desired-state management extends far beyond software deployment. The greatest value is derived from continuous management and ongoing compliance. If a device drifts out of its desired state, if a file or registry setting is corrupted, if a security patch is inadvertently backed out, HP Open View Change and Configuration Management solutions can automatically return the device to its desired state. Downtime, disrupted service, lost productivity and even unhappy customers can be dramatically reduced.\n\nThe HP solution HP OpenView Change and Configuration Management solutions are available today for servers—data center, distributed or blades, PCs—desktop or laptop, and specialty devices such as automated teller machines (ATM), handheld, and point-of-sales (POS) devices. These solutions all work seamlessly together and share a common architecture to\n\n17\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED • Automate the entire software life-cycle management process—from discovery, deployment and ongoing management through to migration and retirement • Automatically deploy and manage the entire software stack to a desired state— operating systems, applications, patches, settings, and content • Provide continuous management by monitoring and adjusting to changes in policy • Manage software on virtually any device—desktops, laptops, servers, handhelds, ATMs, and POS devices—in a heterogeneous or stand-alone infrastructure • Manage software on virtually any operating system—Windows®, UNIX, Linux, Mac, OS/2 • Manage software on virtually any scale, complexity, or any rate of change Customers typically use HP Change and Configuration Management solutions for the following: • PC change and configuration management—For enterprise IT managers and service providers who need to provide consistent availability of desktop applications, HP’s change and configuration management solution is a highly-scalable solution that enables administrators to efficiently and reliably inventory, deploy, and maintain software and content across heterogeneous desktop platforms from a web-based console. • Mobile change and configuration management—HP’s mobile change- and configuration management solution is for enterprise IT managers who need to provide application availability, security, and reliability of software on mobile devices like laptops and personal data assistants (PDA). • ATM change and configuration management—HP’s ATM change and configuration management solutions lower administrative costs while increasing software reliability and security by automating the management of operating systems, patches, applications, content, and multimedia.

Policy While we recognize that there are different legal and cultural environments in which suppliers operate throughout the world, the HP Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (the Code) sets forth the minimum requirements that all suppliers must meet in doing business with HP. Additional requirements for suppliers of subassemblies, parts, materials, components, batteries, and packaging that are incorporated into HP brand products are contained in the HP General Specification for the Environment.\n\n19\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED\n\nHP Electronic Industry Code of Conduct Version 4.01 (June 2012) The Electronic Industry Code of Conduct establishes standards to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. Considered as part of the electronics industry for purposes of this Code are all organization that may design, market, manufacture or provide goods and services that are used to produce electronic goods. The Code may be voluntarily adopted by any business in the electronics sector and subsequently applied by that business to its supply chain and subcontractors, including providers of contract labor. To adopt the Code and become a participant (―Participant‖), a business shall declare its support for the Code and actively pursue conformance to the Code and its standards in accordance with a management system as herein. Participants must regard the code as a total supply chain initiative. At a minimum, participants shall also require its next tier suppliers to acknowledge and implement the Code. Fundamental to adopting the Code is the understanding that a business, in all of its activities, must operate in full compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of the countries in whichit operates. The Code encourages Participants to go beyond legal compliance, drawing upon internationally recognized standards, in order to advance social and environmental responsibility, and business ethics.The Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition is committed to obtaining regular input from stakeholders in the continued development and implementation of the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (EICC). The Code is made up of five sections. Sections A, B, and C outline standards for Labor, Health and Safety, and the Environment, respectively. Section D adds standards relating to business ethics; Section E outlines the elements of an acceptable system to manage conformity to this Code. A. LABOR\n\n20\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED Participants are committed to uphold the human rights of workers, and to treat them with dignity and respect as understood by the international community. This applies to all workers including temporary, migrant, student, contract, direct employees, and any other type of worker. The recognized standards, as set out in the annex, were used as references in preparing the Code and may be a useful source of additional information. The recognized standards, as set out in the annex, were used as references in preparing the Code and may be a useful source of additional information. The labor standards are: 1) Freely Chosen Employment Forced, bonded (including debt bonded) or indentured labor; involuntary prison labor; slavery or trafficking of persons shall not to be used. This includes transporting, harboring, recruiting, transferring or receiving vulnerable persons by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction or fraud for the purposes of exploitation. All work must be voluntary, and workers shall be free to leave work at any time upon reasonable notice. Workers must not be required to surrender any government-issued identification, passports, or work permits as a condition of employment. Excessive fees are unacceptable and all fees charged to workers must be disclosed. 2) Child Labor Avoidance Child labor is not to be used in any stage of manufacturing. The term ―child‖ refers to any person under the age of 15 (or 14 where the law of the country permits), or under the age for completing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is greatest. The use of legitimate workplace apprenticeship programs, which comply with all laws and regulations, is supported. Workers under the age of 18 shall not perform work that is likely to jeopardize the health or safety of young workers. 3) Working Hours Studies of business practices clearly link worker strain to reduced productivity, increased turnover and increased injury and illness. Workweeks are not to exceed the maximum set by local law. Further, a workweek should not be more than 60 hours per\n\n21\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED week, including overtime, except in emergency or unusual situations. Workers shall be allowed at least one day off per seven-day week. 4) Wages and Benefits Compensation paid to workers shall comply with all applicable wage laws, including those relating to minimum wages, overtime hours and legally mandated benefits. In compliance with local laws, workers shall be compensated for overtime at pay rates greater than regular hourly rates. Deductions from wages as a disciplinary measure shall not be permitted. The basis on which workers are being paid is to be provided in a timely manner via pay stub or similar documentation. 5) Humane Treatment There is to be no harsh and inhumane treatment, including any sexual harassment, sexual abuse, corporal punishment, mental or physical coercion or verbal abuse of workers; nor is there to be the threat of any such treatment. Disciplinary policies and procedures in support of these requirements shall be clearly defined and communicated to workers. 6) Non-Discrimination Participants should be committed to a workforce free of harassment and unlawful discrimination. Companies shall not engage in discrimination based on race, color, age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, pregnancy, religion, political affiliation, union membership or marital status in hiring and employment practices such as promotions, rewards, and access to training. In addition, workers or potential workers should not be subjected to medical tests that could be used in a discriminatory way. 7) Freedom of Association Open communication and direct engagement between workers and management are the most effective ways to resolve workplace and compensation issues. The rights of workers to associate freely, join or not join labor unions, seek representation, and join workers’ councils, and bargain collectively in accordance with local laws shall be respected. Workers shall be able to openly communicate and share grievances with management regarding working conditions and management practices without fear of reprisal, intimidation or harassment.\n\n22\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED HP Additional Requirement In saying that worker rights are to be respected as established or provided by local law, what HP means is that in countries that have legal systems that support those rights, they are to be understood in the context of the definitions, conditions and procedures that local law provides. However, basic worker rights to open communication, direct engagement and humane and equitable treatment must be respected even in countries where they are not given meaningful legal protection. Where worker representation and collective bargaining are restricted by law, participants are to facilitate open communication and direct engagement between workers and management as alternative ways of ensuring that workers’ rights, needs and views are considered and acted upon appropriately and in good faith. Open communication and direct engagement between workers and management are the most effective ways to resolve workplace and compensation issues. B. HEALTH and SAFETY Participants recognize that in addition to minimizing the incidence of work-related injury and illness, a safe and healthy work environment enhances the quality of products and services, consistency of production and worker retention and morale. Participants also recognize that ongoing worker input and education is essential to identifying and solving health and safety issues in the workplace.Recognized management systems such as OHSAS 18001 and ILO Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health were used as references in preparing the Code and may be a useful source of additional information. The health and safety standards are: 1) Occupational Safety Worker exposure to potential safety hazards (e.g., electrical and other energy sources, fire, vehicles, and fall hazards) are to be controlled through proper design, engineering and administrative controls, preventative maintenance and safe work procedures (including lockout/tagout), and ongoing safety training. Where hazards cannot be adequately controlled by these means, workers are to be provided with appropriate, well-maintained, personal protective equipment. Workers shall not be disciplined for raising safety concerns. 2) Emergency Preparedness\n\n23\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED Potential emergency situations and events are to be identified and assessed, and their impact minimized by implementing emergency plans and response procedures, including: emergency reporting, employee notification and evacuation procedures, worker training and drills, appropriate fire detection and suppression equipment, adequate exit facilities and recovery plans. 3) Occupational Injury and Illness Procedures and systems are to be in place to prevent, manage, track and report occupational injury and illness, including provisions to:  encourage worker reporting;  classify and record injury and illness cases; c) provide necessary medical treatment;  investigate cases and implement corrective actions to eliminate their causes; and e) facilitate return of workers to work. 4) Industrial Hygiene Worker exposure to chemical, biological and physical agents is to be identified, evaluated, and controlled. Engineering or administrative controls must be used to control overexposures. When hazards cannot be adequately controlled by such means, worker health is to be protected by appropriate personal protective equipment programs. 5) Physically Demanding Work Worker exposure to the hazards of physically demanding tasks, including manual material handling and heavy or repetitive lifting, prolonged standing and highly repetitive or forceful assembly tasks is to be identified, evaluated and controlled. 6) Machine Safeguarding Production and other machinery shall be evaluated for safety hazards. Physical guards, interlocks and barriers are to be provided and properly maintained where machinery presents an injury hazard to workers. 7) Sanitation, Food, and Housing\n\n24\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED Workers are to be provided with ready access to clean toilet facilities, potable water and sanitary food preparation, storage, and eating facilities.

C. ENVIRONMENTAL Participants recognize that environmental responsibility is integral to producing world class products. In manufacturing operations, adverse effects on the community, environment and natural resources are to be minimized while safeguarding the health and safety of the public.Recognized management systems such as ISO 14001, the Eco Management and Audit System (EMAS) were used as references in preparing the Code and may be a useful source of additional information. The environmental standards are: 1) Environmental Permits and Reporting All required environmental permits (e.g. discharge monitoring), approvals and registrations are to be obtained, maintained and kept current and their operational and reporting requirements are to be followed. 2) Pollution Prevention and Resource Reduction Waste of all types, including water and energy, are to be reduced or eliminated at the source or by practices such as modifying production, maintenance and facility processes, materials substitution, conservation, recycling and re-using materials. 3) Hazardous Substances Chemical and other materials posing a hazard if released to the environment are to be identified and managed to ensure their safe handling, movement, storage, use, recycling or reuse and disposal. 4) Wastewater and Solid Waste\n\n25\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED Wastewater and solid waste generated from operations, industrial processes and sanitation facilities are to be characterized, monitored, controlled and treated as required prior to discharge or disposal. 5) Air Emissions Air emissions of volatile organic chemicals, aerosols, corrosives, particulates, ozonedepleting chemicals and combustion by-products generated from operations are to be characterized, monitored, controlled and treated as required prior to discharge. 6) Product Content Restrictions Participants are to adhere to all applicable laws, regulations and customer requirements regarding prohibition or restriction of specific substances, including labeling for recycling and disposal. D. ETHICS To meet social responsibilities and to achieve success in the marketplace, Participants and their agents are to uphold the highest standards of ethics including: 1) Business Integrity The highest standards of integrity are to be upheld in all business interactions.

Messages are ësingle instancedí and then passed to Orchestria via the Import Connector. In addition to the message itself, HP also passes a Unique Identifier (UID) that will allow the message to be retrieved from the Data Store at a later date. The Import Connector moves the message and UID into a disk based Import Pool and returns control to the HP system. This Import Pool is then emptied by a group of Import Agents, the exact number depending on the scale of the installation. These Import Agents then create appropriate event records and temporarily store a copy of the message so that it can be Content Indexed by the Orchestria Content Indexers. Once this has occurred the message will be automatically deleted. Each Event Record in the Orchestria database will identify the record as being stored in HP and will keep the UID such that it can be retrieved later. The Orchestria Import Agents automatically identify duplicate copies of the message. (This will make information available quickly to compliance officer). If the CMS already has a copy of the message, it will simply be deleted, and the database record changed to reflect the HP UID. Retrieval The Orchestria database contains a record for every event, irrespective of whether the object was captured by Orchestria or HP, irrespective of the application (Exchange eMail, Web or IM), and irrespective of whether the event was blocked (assuming policy determines that the message should still be recorded), and perhaps held for a short time. If the message is held in the Orchestria object store it will be retrieved from it. If\n\n30\n\nHAWLETT PACKARED the message is held in the data store the event record will contain the HP UID and the message will be recalled from HP on demand via the Retrieval Connector.\n\nAbout HP Customer Portal solutions HP Customer Portal solutions help you plan, design, build, integrate, and manage a portal that meets the precise needs of your enterprise.
