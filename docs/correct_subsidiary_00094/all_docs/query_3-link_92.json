        "text": "Synopsis\n\nMultinational computer firm Hewlett Packard better known for its printers, servers and boxes for the enterprise, is now wooing the Indian consumer by entering the retail photo printing market.\n\nMUMBAI: Multinational computer firm Hewlett Packard better known for its printers, servers and boxes for the enterprise, is now wooing the Indian consumer by entering the retail photo printing market.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nBudget Highlights: Your 2-minute guide\n\nTax tweaks, jobs & more: All that FM announced in Budget\n\nFM 's plan for Viksit Bharat: A look at key numbers\n\nThe HP logo, more commonly seen on a laptop or a desktop, will now be visible outside photo developing and printing outlets. The firm is tying up with channel partners and existing players for HP branded outlets to tap the market that’s estimated at around 3 billion prints per year in India.\n\nElevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses\n\nOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIndian School of BusinessISB Product ManagementVisitIIT DelhiCertificate Programme in Data Science & Machine LearningVisitMIT xPROMIT Technology Leadership and InnovationVisit\n\nSnapfish, the company HP acquired in 2005, will also be launching in India. Snapfish provides free online space to store digital photographs and allows partnerships through which the photographs can be printed.\n\nPhotography using films is increasingly become obsolete and as more pictures are taken through digital cameras and camera phones, very few of them get printed. Most of them are stored online or on other digital media such as CDs and pen drives.\n\nHP is targeting the potentially huge retail market for digital photo prints and India, with its large population, can grow into one of its most lucrative markets, along with countries like China. In about four years, HP is conservatively aiming at 3,000 photo outlets, according to HP India sales general manager - consumer sales, imaging & printing group Varadarajan Krishnan.\n\n“Digital prints are growing by 26% and the market for film prints is falling by 17%,” HP Asia Pacific & Japan retail photo solutions, imaging & printing group director V Narayanan said.\n\nDiscover the stories of your interest\n\nBlockchain\n\n5 Stories\n\nCyber-safety\n\n7 Stories\n\nFintech\n\n9 Stories\n\nE-comm\n\n9 Stories\n\nML\n\n8 Stories\n\nEdtech\n\n6 Stories\n\nHP’s retail presence in the country will be through self-operated kiosks that print digital photographs and accept credit card payments, a full-fledged photo centre providing for prints on canvas, mugs, T-shirts and other media and HP Micro Labs, a scaled down version of the photo centre.\n\n“We expect the HP Micro Lab to be big in emerging markets like India and China,” Mr Narayanan said. The launch in India will be multi-city and HP has already kick-started discussions with channel partners. The photo centres are likely to be situated in hypermarkets and malls and the kiosks in high traffic areas, that could again be in locations such as malls.\n\nThe photos will be printed using HP inkjet and laser printers and have a shelf life of over 100 years if kept exposed and over 200 years if they are kept protected in an album or in a glass-protected photoframe, HP officials said. HP’s rivals in the photo printing market, Kodak and Fuji, use dye or silver-halide printing.\n\nFor Snapfish founder, Bala Parthasarathy, the India launch is a homecoming of sorts. An Indian by birth, he founded Snapfish in 2000 in US.\n\nThe company, which is present in over 20 countries, will offer free online photo sharing, storage for active members (those who order at least one print a year). Digital prints from Snapfish will cost Rs 2.95 and can be accessed through www.snapfish.co.in.\n\n\"There maybe a number of photo-sharing sites, but what differentiates Snapfish is that we are targeted at end-to-end users,\" Mr Parthasarathy said.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nWhat's cheaper and what's costlier?
