(collectively âComplainantâ), represented by Molly Buck Richard of Richard Law Group, Inc., 8411 Preston Road, Suite 890, Dallas, TX, 75225.Â Respondent is gnic.com (âRespondentâ), jeonggon seo, 1475-3youngchunri changsungeub changsunggun chunnam kr, changsunggun,youngchunri changsungeub changsungun 515-800, Korea (South).\n\nREGISTRAR AND DISPUTED DOMAIN NAME\n\nThe domain name at issue is <snapfish.net>, registered with Onlinenic, Inc.\n\nPANEL\n\nThe undersigned certifies that she has acted independently and impartially and that to the best of her knowledge she has no known conflict in serving as Panelist in this proceeding.Â Hon. Carolyn Marks Johnson sits as Panelist.\n\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nComplainant submitted a Complaint to the National Arbitration Forum electronically March 24, 2006; the National Arbitration Forum received a hard copy of the Complaint March 27, 2006.\n\nOn March 27, 2006, Onlinenic, Inc. confirmed by e-mail to the National Arbitration Forum that the <snapfish.net> domain name is registered with Onlinenic, Inc. and that Respondent is the current registrant of the name.Â Onlinenic, Inc. verified that Respondent is bound by the Onlinenic, Inc. registration agreement and thereby has agreed to resolve domain-name disputes brought by third parties in accordance with ICANN's Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the \"Policy\").\n\nOn March 30, 2006, a Notification of Complaint and Commencement of Administrative Proceeding (the \"Commencement Notification\"), setting a deadline of April 19, 2006, by which Respondent could file a response to the Complaint, was transmitted to Respondent via e-mail, post and fax, to all entities and persons listed on Respondent's registration as technical, administrative and billing contacts, and to postmaster@snapfish.net by e-mail.\n\nHaving received no response from Respondent, the National Arbitration Forum transmitted to the parties a Notification of Respondent Default.\n\nOn April 25, 2006, pursuant to Complainant's request to have the dispute decided by a single-member Panel, the National Arbitration Forum appointed Hon. Carolyn Marks Johnson as Panelist.\n\nHaving reviewed the communications records, the Administrative Panel (the \"Panel\") finds that the National Arbitration Forum discharged its responsibility under Paragraph 2(a) of the Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the \"Rules\") \"to employ reasonably available means calculated to achieve actual notice to Respondent.\"Â Therefore, the Panel may issue its decision based on the documents submitted and in accordance with the ICANN Policy, ICANN Rules, the National Arbitration Forum's Supplemental Rules and any rules and principles of law that the Panel deems applicable, without the benefit of any response from Respondent.\n\nRELIEF SOUGHT\n\nComplainant requests that the domain name be transferred from Respondent to Complainant.\n\nPARTIES' CONTENTIONS\n\nA.Â Complainant makes the following assertions:\n\n1. The domain name that Respondent registered, <snapfish.net>, is identical to Complainantâs SNAPFISH mark.\n\n2. Respondent has no rights to or legitimate interests in the <snapfish.net> domain name.\n\n3. Respondent registered and used the <snapfish.net> domain name in bad faith.\n\nB.Â Respondent failed to submit a Response in this proceeding.\n\nFINDINGS\n\nComplainant, Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P., is a licensee and predecessor in interest of Complainant, Hewlett-Packard Company.Â Complainant holds a trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (âUSPTOâ) for the SNAPFISH mark (Reg. No. 2,643,556 issued October 29, 2002), for use in connection with services including photographic and image processing services and providing online access to digital images.Â\n\nRespondent registered the <snapfish.net> domain name January 13, 2003.Â Respondent is using the disputed domain name to redirect Internet users to Respondentâs commercial website that features links to third-party online photo sharing and digital photography services that compete with Complainant.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nParagraph 15(a) of the Rules instructs this Panel to \"decide a complaint on the basis of the statements and documents submitted in accordance with the Policy, these Rules and any rules and principles of law that it deems applicable.\"\n\nIn view of Respondent's failure to submit a response, the Panel shall decide this administrative proceeding on the basis of Complainant's undisputed representations pursuant to paragraphs 5(e), 14(a) and 15(a) of the Rules and will draw such inferences as the Panel considers appropriate pursuant to paragraph 14(b) of the Rules.Â The Panel is entitled to accept all reasonable allegations and inferences set forth in the Complaint as true unless the evidence is clearly contradictory.Â See Vertical Solutions Mgmt., Inc. v. webnet-marketing, inc., FA 95095 (Nat. Arb. Forum July 31, 2000) (holding that the respondentâs failure to respond allows all reasonable inferences of fact in the allegations of the complaint to be deemed true); see also Talk City, Inc. v. Robertson, D2000-0009 (WIPO Feb. 29, 2000) (âIn the absence of a response, it is appropriate to accept as true all allegations of the Complaint.â).\n\nParagraph 4(a) of the Policy requires Complainant to prove each of the following three elements to obtain an order that a domain name should be cancelled or transferred:\n\n(1) the domain name registered by Respondent is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which Complainant has rights; and\n\n(2) Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and\n\n(3) the domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\n\nIdentical to and/or Confusingly Similar\n\nComplainant submitted extrinsic evidence in this proceeding of its registration of the SNAPFISH mark with the USPTO.Â The Panel finds that such evidence establishes Complainantâs rights in the mark pursuant to Policy Â¶ 4(a)(i).Â See Innomed Techs., Inc. v. DRP Servs., FA 221171 (Nat. Arb. Forum Feb. 18, 2004) (âRegistration of the NASAL-AIRE mark with the USPTO establishes Complainant's rights in the mark.â); see also Vivendi Universal Games v. XBNetVentures Inc., FA 198803 (Nat. Arb. Forum Nov. 11, 2003) (âComplainant's federal trademark registrations establish Complainant's rights in the BLIZZARD mark.â).Â\n\nRespondentâs <snapfish.net> domain name is identical to Complainantâs SNAPFISH mark because Respondentâs domain name incorporates Complainantâs mark in its entirety, adding only the generic top-level domain â.com.âÂ The addition of a generic top-level domain to Complainantâs registered mark does not negate the identical aspects of Respondentâs domain name pursuant to Policy Â¶ 4(a)(i).Â Thus, the Panel finds that the disputed domain name is identical to Complainantâs mark pursuant to Policy Â¶ 4(a)(i).Â See Porto Chico Stores, Inc. v. Zambon, D2000-1270 (WIPO Nov. 15, 2000) (stating that the panel should resolve whether a mark is identical or confusingly similar âby comparing the trademark and the disputed domain name, without regard to the circumstances under which either may be usedâ); see also Pomellato S.p.A v. Tonetti, D2000-0493 (WIPO July 7, 2000) (finding <pomellato.com> identical to the complainantâs mark because the generic top-level domain (gTLD) â.comâ after the name POMELLATO is not relevant).Â Â\n\nThe Panel finds that Complainant satisfied Policy Â¶ 4(a)(i).\n\nRights to or Legitimate Interests\n\nComplainant established that it has rights to and legitimate interests in the mark contained in its entirety in the disputed domain name.Â Complainant alleged that Respondent has no such rights.Â Under Policy Â¶ 4(a)(ii), the burden is on Complainant to prove Respondent does not have rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name.Â Once Complainant has made a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to Respondent to show that it does have rights or legitimate interests pursuant to Policy Â¶ 4(c).Â See Do The Hustle, LLC v. Tropic Web, D2000-0624 (WIPO Aug. 21, 2000) (once the complainant asserts that the respondent has no rights or legitimate interests with respect to the domain, the burden shifts to the respondent to provide âconcrete evidence that it has rights to or legitimate interests in the domain name at issueâ); see also Compagnie Generale des Matieres Nucleaires v. Greenpeace Intâl, D2001-0376 (WIPO May 14, 2001) (âProving that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the Domain Name requires the Complainant to prove a negative. For the purposes of this sub paragraph, however, it is sufficient for the Complainant to show a prima facie case and the burden of proof is then shifted on to the shoulders of Respondent.Â In those circumstances, the common approach is for respondents to seek to bring themselves within one of the examples of paragraph 4(c) or put forward some other reason why they can fairly be said to have a relevant right or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name in question.â).\n\nRespondent is using the <snapfish.net> domain name to redirect Internet users to Respondentâs commercial website that features links to competing third-party websites.Â Respondentâs use of a domain name that is identical to Complainantâs SNAPFISH mark to redirect Internet users interested in Complainantâs services to a website that offers links to services in competition with Complainant is not a use in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services pursuant to Policy Â¶ 4(c)(i), and it is not a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name pursuant to Policy Â¶ 4(c)(iii).Â See Coryn Group, Inc. v. Media Insight, FA 198959 (Nat. Arb. Forum Dec. 5, 2003) (finding that the respondent was not using the domain names for a bona fide offering of goods or services nor a legitimate noncommercial or fair use because the respondent used the names to divert Internet users to a website that offered services that competed with those offered by the complainant under its marks); see also Glaxo Group Ltd. v. WWW Zban, FA 203164 (Nat. Arb. Forum Dec. 1, 2003) (finding that the respondent was not using the domain name within the parameters of Policy Â¶ 4(c)(i) or (iii) because the respondent used the domain name to take advantage of the complainant's mark by diverting Internet users to a competing commercial site).Â\n\nMoreover, Complainant asserts, without contradiction from Respondent, that Respondent is neither commonly known by the <snapfish.net> domain name nor authorized to use a domain name featuring Complainantâs mark.Â Thus, the Panel finds that Respondent is not commonly known by the disputed domain name pursuant to Policy Â¶ 4(c)(ii).Â See Charles Jourdan Holding AG v. AAIM, D2000-0403 (WIPO June 27, 2000) (finding no rights or legitimate interests where (1) a respondent is not a licensee of a complainant; (2) complainantâs prior rights in the domain name precede that respondentâs domain name registration; (3) that respondent is not commonly known by the domain name in question); see also Compagnie de Saint Gobain v. Com-Union Corp., D2000-0020 (WIPO Mar. 14, 2000) (finding no rights or legitimate interests where a respondent was not commonly known by the mark and never applied for a license or permission from a complainant to use the trademarked name).\n\nThe Panel finds that Complainant satisfied Policy Â¶ 4(a)(ii).\n\nRegistration and Use in Bad Faith\n\nComplainant alleged that Respondent acted in bad faith in registering and using a domain name that contained in its entirety Complainantâs protected mark.Â Respondent is using the <snapfish.net> domain name to redirect Internet users to Respondentâs commercial website that features links to competing third-party websites.Â The Panel finds that such use constitutes disruption and is evidence of bad faith registration and use under to Policy Â¶ 4(b)(iii).Â See S. Exposure v. S. Exposure, Inc., FA 94864 (Nat. Arb. Forum July 18, 2000) (finding the respondent acted in bad faith by attracting Internet users to a website that competes with the complainantâs business); see also Puckett v. Miller, D2000-0297 (WIPO June 12, 2000) (finding that the respondent diverted business from the complainant to a competitorâs website in violation of Policy Â¶ 4(b)(iii)).\n\nBased on the uncontested evidence presented by Complainant, the Panel infers that Respondent receives click-through fees for diverting Internet users to a website offering links to competing photo sharing and photography services.Â Respondentâs domain name incorporating Complainantâs mark may create confusion as to Complainantâs affiliation with the disputed domain name and resulting website.Â Thus, Respondentâs use of the <snapfish.net> domain name amounts to bad faith registration and use pursuant to Policy Â¶ 4(b)(iv).Â See Kmart v. Khan, FA 127708 (Nat. Arb. Forum Nov. 22, 2002) (finding that if the respondent profits from its diversionary use of the complainantâs mark when the domain name resolves to commercial websites and the respondent fails to contest the complaint, it may be concluded that the respondent is using the domain name in bad faith pursuant to Policy Â¶ 4(b)(iv)); see also Drs. Foster & Smith, Inc. v. Lalli, FA 95284 (Nat. Arb. Forum Aug. 21, 2000) (finding bad faith where the respondent directed Internet users seeking the complainantâs site to its own website for commercial gain).\n\nThe Panel finds that Complainant satisfied Policy Â¶ 4(a)(iii).\n\nDECISION\n\nHaving established all three elements required under the ICANN Policy, the Panel concludes that relief shall be GRANTED.\n\nAccordingly, it is Ordered that the <snapfish.net> domain name be TRANSFERRED from Respondent to Complainant.\n\nHon.
