        "text": "·\n\nPC Postage Services. After completing the registration process, customers can purchase and print postage 24 hours a day, seven days a week through our software or web interface. When a customer purchases postage for use through our service, the customer pays the face value of the postage, and the funds are transferred directly from the customer’s account to the USPS’s account. The customer then draws down their prepaid account balance as they print postage and repurchases postage as necessary. Customers typically pay a monthly subscription fee for access to our service.\n\n·\n\nPC Postage Integrations. As part of our PC Postage services, we offer back-end integration solutions where we provide the electronic postage for transactions to partners who manage the front-end process. Our software integrates directly into the most popular e-commerce platforms, allowing web store managers to completely automate their order fulfillment process by processing, managing, and shipping orders from virtually any e-commerce source through a single interface without manual data entry. Managers can retrieve order data and print complete shipping labels for all USPS mail classes, including First Class International®.\n\n·\n\nMailing & Shipping Supplies Store. Our Mailing & Shipping Supplies Store (our “Supplies Store”) is available to our customers from within our PC Postage software and sells NetStamps labels, shipping labels, other mailing labels, dedicated postage printers, scales, and other mailing and shipping-focused office supplies. Our Supplies Store features a store catalog, messaging regarding our free or discounted shipping promotions, cross-selling product recommendation during the checkout process, product search capabilities, and same day shipping of orders with expedited and rush shipping options.\n\n·\n\nBranded Insurance. We offer Stamps.com branded insurance to our customers so that they may insure their mail or packages in a fully integrated, online process that eliminates any trips to the post office or the need to complete any special forms. Our branded insurance is provided in partnership with Parcel Insurance Plan and is underwritten by Fireman's Fund.\n\nŸ\n\nAffiliate Channels. We utilize the traffic and customers of smaller web sites and other businesses or individuals that are too small to qualify for a partnership directly with us by offering financial incentives for these small businesses and individuals to drive traffic to our web site through a third party affiliate management company.\n\nŸ\n\nPartnerships. We work with strategic partners in order to leverage their web site traffic, marketing programs, and existing customer base to distribute our PC Postage software. For example, these partnerships may result in a link to our website from a partner’s website, a copy of our software included along with a partner’s software product, the distribution of our software at a retail location, or the bundling of our software with a hardware device. Our partnerships include Microsoft, Avery Dennison, Hewlett Packard and the USPS.\n\nŸ\n\nRemarketing. We remarket our services to former customers. Our remarketing efforts are generally focused on new features that may relate to the reasons former customers stopped using our service. We utilize e-mail and regular mail to communicate new features of our products to our former customers.\n\nŸ\n\nUSPS Referrals. We utilize the nationwide USPS Account Manager network to market and sell our services to customers. We market to the account managers by attending regional and national meetings and forums, and participating in local vendor calls. We also receive referrals directly from the USPS website at www.USPS.com.\n\nŸ\n\nEnhanced Promotion Online Advertising. We work with various companies to advertise our service in various places across the Internet. This channel typically offers an additional promotion directly to the customer by the partner in order to get the customer to try our service. This channel tends to attract more consumer oriented customers. We reduced our investment in the enhanced promotional channel during recent years.\n\n·\n\nIncrease our Small Business Marketing Spending. Based on recent analysis and trends, we continue to experience a strong return on our investment in our small business PC Postage customers, who have a lifetime value of more than twice the cost of acquiring those customers. Accordingly, we plan to increase our small business customer acquisition spend by an estimated 5% to 15% in 2013 versus 2012.\n\n·\n\nOptimize our Business Model and Improve our Customer Experience. We plan to continue optimizing our registration process and post-registration customer interactions to improve the initial experience a customer has with our service by shortening and streamlining the registration process and facilitating easier purchasing of postage by customers during registration. We plan to expand our usage of demo videos and online how to videos. We also plan to continue expanding our presence in social networking sites and continue expanding our customer web portal and enhancing content on our website.\n\n·\n\nEnhance our Enterprise Solutions Sales and Marketing Efforts. Customers continue to be attracted to our enterprise solution versus a postage meter. We believe this customer preference is based on our dramatically lower cost of ownership and the greater visibility into individual employee activity available from our sophisticated centralized front-end reporting tool, with features typically not available with a postage meter, such as real time data, improved web-based postage management tools, and enhanced web-based financial and administrative controls for central decision makers.\n\n·\n\nEnhance our High Volume Shipper Solutions and Sales and Marketing Efforts. We continue to attract high volume shippers such as warehouses, fulfillment houses, e-commerce shippers, larger retailers, and other types of high volume shippers to our service through our efforts in these areas. In 2012 we continued to invest in our shipping technology and our sales and marketing efforts. As a result, postage printed by our high volume shipping customers in 2012 was up 66% compared to 2011.\n\nPeriod\n\nTotal Number of\n\nShares Purchased\n\nAverage Price Paid\n\nper Share\n\nTotal Number of\n\nShares Purchased as\n\nPart of Publicly\n\nAnnounced Plans or\n\nPrograms (1)\n\nApproximate Dollar\n\nValue of Shares That\n\nMay Yet be\n\nPurchased Under the\n\nPlans or Programs\n\n(in 000’s)\n\n·\n\nWe expect Non-Core PC Postage and PhotoStamps revenues to decrease in 2013 compared with 2012, as we expect to minimize investment in these areas of our business.\n\n·\n\nIn October 2012, Amazon.com launched an additional Marketplace USPS shipping solution as an alternative to our shipping solution and we expect this to have a negative impact on our 2013 revenue from this partnership.\n\n·\n\nWe expect to continue to increase customer acquisition spending on our Core PC Postage marketing channels by 5% - 15% in 2013 compared to 2012. We will continue to monitor our customer metrics and the state of the economy and adjust our level of spending accordingly.\n\n·\n\nWe expect research and development expenses to be higher in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily related to expected increased headcount costs to support the growth in our products and services.\n\n·\n\nWe expect capital expenditures to be approximately $3.5 million in 2013 reflecting an increased level of investment in our technology platform and data centers to ensure the scalability and reliability of our solutions.\n\nCertification of Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) and Rule 15d-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended.(17)\n\nCertification of Chief Executive Office pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
