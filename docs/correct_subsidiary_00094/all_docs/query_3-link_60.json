        "text": "In a Snapfish vs. Shutterfly photo printing showdown, which online service wins?\n\nYou might have digital photos you’d like to print onto a mug or photo book but don’t know which website to use.\n\nSo, I’ve written this article to help you understand how each service works, its pros and cons, and key points of difference.\n\nAfter years of experience in the photography field, I thought it was about time to test these two online printing options and give you my verdict.\n\nBy the end of this article, you should be able to make a well-informed decision about using Snapfish or Shutterfly.\n\nWhat Is Snapfish and How Does It Work?\n\nWith more than 20 years in the online printing industry, Snapfish is one of the biggest names on the market and easily one of the best photo printing services.\n\nFounded in 1999, this website allows you to upload images to make photo cards, canvas prints, photo books, and photo gifts.\n\nSnapfish was owned by the market giant HP (Hewlett Packard) from 2005 to 2015, at which point it was sold to District Photo.\n\nTo use Snapfish, you can either start uploading the images you’d like to print or select a project and then add photos.\n\nIn both scenarios, you may use images saved on your computer, Google Photos, or your social media accounts.\n\nIs Snapfish Really Free?\n\nSigning up for an account on Snapfish and using the iOS and Android app is free.\n\nEven better, you get up to 100 free 4×6 prints a month for an entire year once you download the official app for the first time!\n\nBut, afterward, prices will range based on the type of photo product you’ll be ordering.\n\n7 Best Photo Book Makers\n\nWhat Are the Pros and Cons of Snapfish?\n\nAfter trying Snapfish, here’s everything I liked and disliked about the experience:\n\nPros\n\nIntuitive website and app interface (great if you’re not tech-savvy)\n\nShips to many other countries besides the U.S., including Canada, the United Kingdom, France, New Zealand, and more\n\nFair prices for the quality\n\nReputable payment methods, like Visa, PayPal, and MasterCard\n\nA multitude of attractive templates for photo cards\n\nEasy picture upload process thanks to its compatibility with different devices\n\nCons\n\nMost printed images come out oversaturated or with overexposure issues in bright areas\n\nSome popular photo book sizes (10×10, 11×8, and 7×9) aren’t available\n\nCalendars and books need thicker paper with higher quality\n\nWhat Is Shutterfly and How Does It Work?\n\nSimilar to Snapfish, Shutterfly is a platform that specializes in printing your digital photos onto photo books, cards, or gifts of your choosing.\n\nTheir range is vast, too, including coffee mugs, wall art, calendars, pillows, stationery, and more.\n\nYou can start by signing up for an account and then uploading photos from your phone, PC, Facebook, Instagram, or others.\n\nOr, you may shop by category first, and then pick the pictures you want to include.\n\nIs Shutterfly Really Free?\n\nYes. Shutterfly enables you to securely store your pictures online for an unlimited time without charging you any money.\n\nLike Snapfish, signing up is free, and you also get free prints once you download the app.\n\nHow to Print Photos Directly from Your iPhone\n\nWhat Are the Pros and Cons of Shutterfly?\n\nHere’s a rundown of Shutterfly’s many upsides and few drawbacks:\n\nPros\n\nMaintains the accuracy of the original photo with minimal to no overexposure and oversaturation problems\n\nOffers you unlimited photo storage and unlimited free prints\n\nLocal pickup option in the U.S.\n\nMany choices when it comes to photo size\n\nFast delivery\n\nCons\n\nExpensive compared to similar services\n\nSometimes the prints come out blurry\n\nSnapfish vs Shutterfly: At a Glance\n\nTypes of photo book covers\n\nSnapfish: Full photo cover, dust jacket, die-cut leather/linen/paper, padded velvet, and padded leather\n\nShutterfly: Full photo cover, fabric, leather, suede, satin, cloth, padded, glossy, and matte\n\nNumber of themes\n\nSnapfish: 110+\n\nShutterfly: 100+\n\nLayouts\n\nSnapfish: 80+\n\nShutterfly: 270+\n\nPhoto editing options\n\nSnapfish: Rotate, Zoom, Brighten, Flip, Red Eye, Enhance, B&W, Color Tints, Sepia,\n\nShutterfly: Rotate, Zoom, Red eye, B&W, Saturate, Soft focus, Vivid Pics, Fade, Color Tone\n\nShare online\n\nSnapfish: Yes\n\nShutterfly: Yes\n\nSell online\n\nSnapfish: No\n\nShutterfly: Yes\n\nSnapfish vs Shutterfly: An In-Depth Comparison\n\nNow, let’s look at how these two photo printing beasts compare in terms of photo books, paper size options, photo quality, software, and more.\n\nSnapfish vs Shutterfly: Photobooks\n\nIn my opinion, both services provide a remarkable photo book printing experience. They offer you different sizes, styles according to occasion, and cover materials.\n\nHowever, Snapfish allows you to have 22 to 150 pages in your book, while Shutterfly is limited to 20 to 110 pages.\n\nAlso, Snapfish lets you print 2,000 pictures per photo book. Alternatively, Shutterfly gives you 500 pictures for Simple Path and 1,000 for Custom Path.\n\nSnapfish vs Shutterfly: Paper Options\n\nBoth platforms have various paper types and sizes to cater to your needs.\n\nWith Snapfish, you can choose silk, glossy, and layflat extra-thick premium paper. The dimensions depend on the finish and purpose, so you can go for Standard, Large, or Photo Book.\n\nShutterfly has four size categories: Standard, Square, large format, and Photo Books. Paper options include matte, glossy, cardstock, and pearl.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that you’ll find the 10×10 size in Shutterfly, unlike its competitor.\n\nHow to Choose the Best Paper for Photo Books\n\nSnapfish vs Shutterfly: Software\n\nFrom my experience, these two services were equally easy to use. This makes them fantastic options if you’re a beginner.\n\nBoth give you the choice to use a pre-designed template or more freedom to modify the designs according to your vision.\n\nThey also support online use only, so you cannot download separate software for offline work.\n\nSnapfish vs Shutterfly: Print Quality\n\nMost people who used both printing platforms preferred the print quality of Shutterfly. Its prints are usually free of flaws like overexposure, too-bright colors, and excessively dark shadows.\n\nEven the paper used in Shutterfly has a more premium feel.\n\nStill, it’s worth noting that Snapfish is more affordable, offering decent quality at a budget-friendly price.\n\nSnapfish vs Shutterfly: Christmas Cards, Calendars, and Other Gifts\n\nIf you choose Snapfish, the gifts you can make with it include hanging canvas, wedding invitations, custom holiday cards, and calendars.\n\nOther photo gifts involve ceramic and travel mugs and home decor accessories.\n\nBut I found that Shutterfly offers you more. Besides these gift ideas, it lets you personalize napkins, dinner plates, candles, hoodies, and kids’ toys.\n\nSnapfish vs Shutterfly: Shipping & Delivery\n\nShutterfly has faster shipping across the United States because its most affordable plan (and slowest) can ship your order in 6–10 days.\n\nIts other plans are Standard, Expedited, Rush, and Super Rush, which span from 5–7 to 1–2 business days.\n\nOn the contrary, Snapfish’s slowest plan takes 8–10 days of shipping. Its other plans are Ground, Expedited, and Rush.\n\nSnapfish vs Shutterfly: Price\n\nGenerally, the prices of Shutterfly prints, personalized gifts, and shipping are higher than Snapfish.\n\nStill, both websites have deals and promos from time to time, so you can keep an eye out for those if you want to save some cash.\n\nWhich Services is Best for Printing Photo Tiles?\n\nSnapfish vs Shutterfly: Which One’s for You?\n\nIf you want unlimited storage, unlimited prints, faster delivery, more natural colors, and higher photo quality, Shutterfly should be your go-to option.\n\nThe only downside is that the print and shipping cost is higher.\n\nOtherwise, Snapfish can be a good choice if you’re not particular about your photo quality or if you’re on a budget.\n\nSnapfish vs Shutterfly FAQs\n\nIs Snapfish owned by Shutterfly?\n\nYes. Shutterfly and Snapfish were merged in 2020.\n\nWhich has better quality Snapfish or Shutterfly?\n\nShutterfly produces better colors, paper quality, and overall finish than Snapfish.\n\nIs Snapfish high quality?\n\nSnapfish has fairly good print quality, which suits the budget-friendly price.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of Shutterfly?\n\nThe most notable disadvantage of Shutterfly is its high shipping prices.\n\nOther pronounced downsides include lower calendar quality compared to normal prints and flimsy hardcover bindings."
