Shutterfly’s competitors include San Francisco, California-based Snapfish Inc., and Amazon. The latter launched a competing online service called Amazon Prints in September 2016, Sending Shutterfly's stock price down 14% over the next month.\n\nIn 2001, Hewlett Packard bought Israel-based Indigo, a digital press manufacturer, founded in 1977.
