The company started in May 2006.\n\nFounded by Antonio Rodriguez, Tabblo.com, will stick around and will be applying new technologies as a result of the acquisition. HP also owns Snapfish.com, which is also a photo-sharing website. Tabblo and Snapfish will remain independent of each other.\n\n“Tabblo is a very cool company with a great product. They’ve got Flickr-like community, they blogged critically about Yahoo while sponsoring Techmeme and I’ll tell you – I often show off the Tabblo of the kids in my family to people who visit my house. Naysayers called them an also-ran but they deserve a big congrats today” stated Marshall Kirkpatrick, Director of Content at SplashCast.\n\nThe announcement was made official by the Tabblog."
