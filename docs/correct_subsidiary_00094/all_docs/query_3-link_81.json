        "text": "By Sarah Pierce\n\nA federal class action lawsuit claims Snapfish.com, owned by Hewlett-Packard, “has stolen money from its own customers” by sending their credit card information to a marketer who uses it to trick them into enrolling in a fee-based membership.\n\nLead Plaintiff Carol Hill Castagnola alleges in the Snapfish class action lawsuit that Hewlett-Packard transfers its Snapfish customers’ credit card information to Regent Group, Inc. d/b/a Encore Marketing International, Inc. (“Regent”), which then uses the information, along with a misleading website, “to deceive Snapfish’s customers into enrolling in a fee-based membership.”\n\nThe deception is accomplished by leading customers through several checkout screens to make their purchase, the Snapfish class action lawsuit states. During the checkout process, customers are sent to a different website controlled by Regent without informing them.\n\n“To the contrary, Regent designed its website to deceive consumers into believing they were still viewing the Snapfish website by displaying the Snapfish trademark and using the Snapfish layout and color scheme,” the Snapfish.com class action lawsuit says.\n\nRegent then offers a “$10 gift code” or other perk to entice consumers into joining the Snapfish Valuepass program.\n\n“Only in small print, on the far left side of the Regent website, designed not to be noticed by the consumer, did the Regent website disclose that consumers would be charged a $1.95 activation fee and then billed $14.95 per month thereafter for the Snapfish Valuepass program.”\n\nThe Snapfish class action lawsuit is brought on behalf of all persons who were enrolled in the Snapfish Valuepass program after December 1, 2007. It is seeking restitution, costs, an injunction and Class damages for unfair and deceptive trade and business law violations.\n\nA copy of the Hewlett-Packard Snapfish.com Class Action Lawsuit can be read here.\n\nThe case is Castagnola v. Hewlett-Packard Company d/b/a Snapfish.com, et al., Case No. 11-cv-5772, U.S. District Court Northern District of California.\n\nWe tell you about cash you can claim EVERY WEEK!
