        "text": "Hewlett-Packard announced on Monday that it has added new functionality to Snapfish, its free photo storage Web site. For example, Group Rooms, a new photo-sharing tool, allows users to create their own Web page, with a unique URL, to which the page creator, and invited friends and family, can add and view photos. Group members receive e-mail updates when the \"room\" has been updated.\n\nSnapfish has also enhanced existing features such as its services for creating calendars, greeting cards and hardcover coffee table books. In addition to the main photo of the month on a Snapfish calendar, users can add additional photos or text to individual days. Snapfish bound books of personal photos, called Memory Books, offer more design options and book sizes. And there now are more design options for Snapfish greeting cards. The site interface has also been reorganized with new navigation tools and sorting options for stored photos. HP acquired Snapfish in March 2005."
