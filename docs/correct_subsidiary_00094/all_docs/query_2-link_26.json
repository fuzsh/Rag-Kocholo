        "text": "We’ve broken down our analysis of Shutterfly into 2 main business segments:\n\n1. Photos, Cards, Albums & Stationery\n\n2. Commercial Printing Services\n\nOpportunity in Online Gifts and Stationery Market\n\nThe stationery market in the U.S. is estimated to be between $7-7.5 billion, and the greeting and photo books cards business is around $14-14.5 billion. [ ] We estimate that less than 2% of this market is online, representing a huge growth opportunity for the company.\n\nShutterfly is leveraging social media to expand its outreach as its site allows users to share photos and albums by setting up personal or group share settings or personal websites for their photos. The company makes most of its revenues from selling professionally bound photobooks, greeting cards, stationary, calendars and high quality prints for holidays and special occasions. Also by focusing on youth events and organizations, it can increase registrations and customer acquisitions. For instance, in 2010 the company partnered with American Youth Soccer Organization (“AYSO”) to create sites to support over 50,000 teams across the U.S. [ ]\n\nWe estimate that continued innovation to its site and partnerships will enable Shutterfly to grow the number of customers in the years to come. Innovative methods such as these have resulted in a $200k decrease in customer acquisition costs in 2010 compared to 2009. [ ]\n\nPartnership and Acquisitions to Drive Growth\n\nShutterfly’s photobooks, cards, stationery, mugs and calendars fall under its personalized products and services segment and contributed around 71% of net revenues and grew at 35% year-over-year in 2010. Within this segment, its award winning line of photo books, cards and stationery products, including silver halide greeting cards accounted for the majority of these revenues.\n\nTo drive growth, the company plans to expand its R&D outlay apart from increasing its sales and marketing focus to attract new customers. These efforts are expected to create greater demand for its personalized products and services business.\n\nAdditionally the company has stepped growth by acquiring Tiny Prints in April 2011 for $333 million which included approximately $146 million in cash and approximately 4 million shares of Shutterfly common stock. Tiny Prints offers more stylish and personalized stationary. Also, last November the company acquired WMSG to boost its commercial printing business.\n\nThese moves indicate the company’s focus on acquiring new customers and scaling its business to become a leader in the online photo and printing services business."
