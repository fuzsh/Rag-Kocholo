        "text": "It is done!\n\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/hewlett-packard-to-buy-aruba-networks-1425303619\n\nHewlett-Packard Co. agreed to buy Aruba Networks Inc. for about $2.7 billion in an all-cash deal aimed at bolstering the tech company’s wireless networking operations.\n\nAruba—based in Sunnyvale, Calif.—had revenues of $729 million last year, and it has reported compound annual revenue growth of 30% over the past five years, Hewlett-Packard said.\n\nThe deal values Aruba at $24.67 share, or about $3.0 billion, including cash and debt. Both companies’ boards of directors have approved the deal.\n\nHP is the dirty snowball of the tech world. They roll downhill mashing in everything they can absorb. Buried somwhere in that muddy mess are the bones of Compaq, Digital Equipment Corp, Palm, 3COm, Mercury Interactive, Bitfone, Voodoo PC, Snapfish, Texas Instruments and much more. Did any of these make HP more relvant in the market? No. Just a bloated meandring giant good at not much. Even their printers (which were good hardware) have suffered from a decade long decline in software quality.\n\nAcquisitions are always negative. The acquired will eventually suffer and languish as a less important cousin to the central family. Cisco's done it, Microsoft does it constantly. Suddenly there is a change at the top and last year's darling acquisition is put on a starvation diet.\n\nThis is a sad day for Aruba.\n\nI think things will be fine for at least the next couple years. It's a promising sign that Dominic and Keerti will be in charge of the combined organization. Assuming that they stay and are allowed to lead the way they want to, the future looks good. If they leave or aren't allowed to lead with their vision, then I would be concerned...\n\n@scottm32768 wrote:\n\nI think things will be fine for at least the next couple years.

CEO is said to maintain the same role or control as before, then a year later they leave the company because things didn't really work as promised? History often repeats itself."
