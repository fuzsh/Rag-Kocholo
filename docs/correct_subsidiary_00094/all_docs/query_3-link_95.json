        "text": "HYDERABAD: Hewlett Packard-owned Snapfish, which provides image sharing and print service, would launch its Indian edition by August, according to sources close to the development.\n\nAn Indian company is providing technical support, product management and marketing to Snapfish to start the operations. Snapfish is currently running 19 editions.\n\n``They are launching in 17 countries and India is one of them. They will be launching by August,’’ a source said without providing further details.\n\nHP acquired Snapfish in 2005. Snapfish was a division of District Photo Inc. prior to the acquisition by HP. Beltsville (USA) based District Photo acquired Snapfish in 2001.\n\nSnapfish, founded in 1999, competes with companies like Flickr, Shutterfly and Eastman Kodak’s EasyShare Gallery. In India, merasnap.com and eyaadein.com run similar services.\n\nKodak, Compaq, BellSouth, the Mayfield Fund and other private investors initially backed Snapfish.\n\n© CyberMedia News"
