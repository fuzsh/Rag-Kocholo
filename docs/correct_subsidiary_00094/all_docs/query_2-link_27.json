        "text": "Hewlett Packard (HP) is pulling the plug on its web-based photo sharing and photo printing service Snapfish in India and three other countries – Belgium, The Netherlands and Spain. As per a note on the website, Snapfish says that it is pulling the plug to focus on its core markets and has directed all users to complete any saved projects and place their respective orders on Snapfish by September 16, 2013, following which HP will be shutting down the service. This shutdown was first reported by NextBigWhat.\n\nAs per the note, all orders placed before September 16, 2013 will apparently be processed and delivered as usual. Its also worth noting that Snapfish is only shutting down the local websites in the above mentioned markets on September 16. Therefore, while users will still no longer have access to their projects or use their promotional credits and gift certificates on the site, they will be able to download photos from any other Snapfish site after September 16, 2013.\n\nSnapfish-Photojaanic Tie-up: Interestingly, Snapfish is suggesting users to make use of an alternative photo printing service called Photojaanic and is currently providing an introductory offer for its customers, which claims to provide vouchers and offers worth Rs 1,500. Snapfish says that Photojaanic has been printing and shipping all Snapfish India’s orders since its launch in 2007.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded in 1999, Snapfish was acquired by HP for $300 million in 2005 and currently has presence in 21 markets including Germany, France, Ireland, Netherlands, USA and United Kingdom among others. The company launched (pdf) a dedicated India site Snapfish.in in 2007 and allowed users to upload photos and order photo prints or print digital photos on products like mugs, posters, photobooks, calendars, and greeting cards among others. The company had acquired (pdf) the customers of the online digital photo printing and delivery portal Merasnap.com in May 2008.\n\nOver the years, Snapfish had also inked quite a few tie-ups to launch co-branded online photo centers. This includes Indiaplaza tie-up in August 2008, Indiatimes* and eBay India tie-up in September 2009 and Johnson & Johnson’s BabyCenter tie-up in November 2009.\n\nOther players in this space include Printo which has investors like Sequoia Capital, Seed Fund and Blume Ventures, Canvera which has investors like Info Edge, Footprint Ventures, Mumbai Angels and DFJ and ZoomIn which had raised around Rs 8 crore ($1.5 million) in venture debt funding from Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) subsidary, SVB India Finance in January 2013."
