        "text": "Thoughts and opinions about the IRGA (International Reprographics Association) Convention, May 2010 - 'wrap-up'\n\nWell, the annual IRGA Convention ended late this afternoon, and although the number of attendees was still down from two, three, four, etc years ago, attendance at this year's convention appeared to be about the same as last year. Next year's IRGA convention will be held in Las Vegas. Hopefully, the recession the reprographics industry has been enduring will be over by then and that plus the location of Las Vegas will attract a higher number of attendees.\n\nAbout this 'wrap-up' I'm about to type; I am not a good note taker (when I take notes during an event, I lose track of what I'm listening to, so I prefer to do my write-ups from 'memory recall' rather than from written notes.) So, pardon me if my write-up misses some of the stuff that happened at the convention. (Those of you who wish to do so can submit your own 'wrap-up' by posting \"comments\" to this post.)\n\nFirst, I'd first like to mention Mike Cully. Mike Cully is the outgoing IRGA President. Mike is an outstanding guy, and I'm sure that everyone appreciates the personal time Mike has devoted to the IRGA. I absolutely love Mike's sense of humor, and I am positive that Kevin Cully, his brother and partner in Air Graphics, has had an influence on Mike's sense of humor. (Kevin is a great guy, just like Mike.)\n\nSecond, I'd like to mention Gary Wilbur (of RS Knapp / Napco), who will be the IRGA President after Mike Cully leaves office. Like Mike, Gary has devoted a ton of time and energy to the IRGA, and I wish him success as the next President of the IRGA. If you are an IRGA member, support Gary's efforts, and one of the best ways of supporting Gary (and the IRGA Board) would be to encourage your local competitors to join the IRGA this year.\n\nThird, Steve Bova and his SmithBucklin Group team members did another outstanding job organizing this year's convention.\n\nFourth, I am compelled to mention that this years Convention Education Program Chair, Casey Simpson (who is a member of ARC's Global Solutions team), did a truly outstanding job. The educational breakout sessions were excellent - thought provoking - actionable - etc. The Open Space Technology session held this afternoon was Tanner Bechtel's idea, and my own personal opinion of this method of collaboration and networking .... it was excellent. (Tanner is also a member of ARC's Global Solutions team.)\n\nNow, on to the convention \"wrap-up\" .....\n\nLast year, I said that K.P. Reddy's presentation (about BIM) was 'worth the price of admission.' (KP Reddy is President of RCMS Group and he is an expert in BIM technology. Last year, RCMS Group was a private company; but at the end of September last year, RCMS Group became an ARC-owned enterprise. KP is now part of ARC's management team.) My \"nod\" for this year's 'worth the price of admission' presentation goes to Henry Givray, Chairman and CEO of SmithBucklin Group. The subject of his presentation was \"The Passion of Leadership\". Only one word can truly express my opinion of Henry's presentation - AWESOME! There are many of us who think we know all there is to know about \"leadership\", so \"why bother to hear another presentation about that subject?\" After all, many of you own businesses and \"what can anyone tell us that we don't already know?\" During Henry's presentation, he points out the differences between \"management\" and \"leadership\" and points out that the two don't necessarily go hand in hand. (One of my ex-partners, Martha Korman, has, for many years, said that \"managers transact, but leaders transform.\") For those of you who \"think you are leaders\", I invite you and suggest to you that you dwell hard on the presentation that Henry gave today, for there are many of us who think we are leaders even though we've not yet gone beyond being managers. In Europe, I have the privilege of working with a young man who is a natural born \"leader\", not to mention an exceptional \"manager.\" In spite of his abilities, he would have paid very close attention to Henry's insightful presentation this afternoon. Actually, he would have been 'riveted' to his chair, like I was. (For those of you who attended Henry's presentation but were dawdling with your iPhones, iPads, Blackberries and other gadgets while Henry was giving his presentation, you missed one of the best presentations about leadership and management that I've ever heard .... and at 63 years old, and considering that I've read a lot of books on that subject and attended lots of events where that subject was discussed ..... I think that's saying something. Henry's presentation was not just excellent, it was extremely well organized and given with, yes, PASSION. Thank you, Henry.\n\nMost of this year's educational breakout sessions were very informative and thought provoking. But, I'd like to make special mention that it was nice to see Jim Ryerson (of Sales Octane) back for a second time. If you want to stoke the fires of your sales managers and sales team members, Jim lights fires as well as anyone I've ever met. His presentations are not just chock full of actionable information, but fun to listen to.\n\nDuring my explorations in and around the trade show, I discovered a company called \"ReproConnect\". They were demonstrating and will soon be releasing on the market a software program called \"ROCR\" (pronounced \"rocker\"). Well, all I can say is 'rock and roll', the guys/gals on this team have come up with an automated way to rename and index files after documents have been scanned. Sounds like an excellent software product to me; one that will save time and allow reprographers to give better, more accurate, faster service to their customers.\n\nAbout HP, I am a huge fan of HP's \"latex\" printing technology. If you did not take the time to check that out, you must do so.\n\nThe opportunity to \"network\" at the IRGA is simply outstanding. And, it is one of the reasons why I said, in a post I did last year or the year before, that those of you who do not attend the IRGA convention are idiots. The opportunity to learn from others in the industry (and to share successes and failures and wins and losses) and to discuss and debate industry and business issues is ALWAYS worth the price of admission to an IRGA convention.\n\nBased on conversations I had at the IRGA convention with vendors who sell to the reprographics industry and with reprographers from all across the U.S., it appears that reprographers in the U.S. have finally hit bottom and that an upturn is going to be happening in the not too distant future. Therefore, I'm sticking to a prediction I made in a post I did not too long ago - that by Q3 2010, most reprographers will finally see a year-over-year improvement in their numbers.\n\nAnd, I say that in spite of one of the more interesting presentations given at this year's convention. The presentation I'm now mentioning was this one: \"Paperless and Virtual – Future of the AEC Industry and Reprographics\" - presented by Bob Middlebrooks, Industry Programs Manager, Autodesk. Prior to joining Autodesk, Bob was a practicing Architect, so he is very familiar with the reprographics industry .... what reprographers do, where reprographers fit in the food chain, and the challenges that reprographers face. During his presentation, he suggested several ideas for diversification; basically, services reprographers might want to consider offering in the future to help replace revenues from declining prints-on-paper volumes. If you did not attend Bob's presentation, then you might want to buy the tape recordings of the IRGA convention, but I'm going to warn you; if I were to \"sum up\" in just a few words what Bob's suggestions amounted to (and using the phrase \"few words\" and \"Joel attempting to doing that\" is an oxymoron at best), if you follow Bob's suggestions you will be in a different business than reprographers have traditionally been in. Kind of like suggesting that, since reprographers have 'relationships' with A/E firms and GC's, we can rent them cars or sell them furniture. At the end of Bob's presentation, he called for questions from the audience. At first, there was a \"stunned silence.\" Bob said things that reprographers just don't want to hear. I totally agree with Bob that changes are already underway (in the A/E/C industry) that will lead to declining prints-on-paper volumes over the years to come. But, I don't agree with several of the suggestions Bob made to reprographers, about new services they might consider adding. But, 'what do I know', anyway?\n\nOkay, that's it for my post-convention write-up.\n\nExcept to say, that those of you who've been reading my blog know that I attended the GGN conference in Rome last month. That conference was attended by European reprographers. To the European reprographers who read my blog, consider attending the IRGA convention next year in Las Vegas. For those who attend, I'll buy the \"first round.\" Although I found the GGN conference to be well run and informative, there is, in my opinion, nothing that matches the networking opportunity offered by an IRGA convention. I encourage my European reprographer friends to also consider joining the IRGA as members.\n\nOne final \"special\" mention about a gentlemen most reprographers know, John Cronin, CEO of PLP. In all my years in the industry, I've never met an industry vendor who was as \"participative\" as John is. In many (I think I should say, \"most\") of the customer proposals I developed over the many years I was actively involved in the reprographics business in the U.S., I said, \"we are very aware that our success depends on your success; we will do everything in our power to help you make your business more successful.\" John Cronin exemplifies that phrase. John is always asking questions. John knows that asking customers questions is paramount to his company's success. John is always full of thought provoking ideas and suggestions. If you've never done business with John, you are missing out on a valuable experience. Although many will consider my comments about John to be sort of an advertorial for PLP, they are not meant to be, or intended to be, that. I've made these comments about John because he is that good to work with, and because I think his contributions to the industry have been significant.\n\nNext year in Vegas ..... certainly hoping that the industry will see a very nice rebound by then!\n\nAdd RIM (Blackberry) to the Fedex Office, Canon, HP deal (???)\n\nThe article, below, is a follow-on to the post I did earlier this morning about the Fedex Office / Canon / HP deal. The article i'm reprinting below comes from crackberry.com and was written by Isaac Kendall.\n\nRIM, FedEx Office, Hilton Worldwide Join HP to Make Printing On-the-Go Reality for Enterprise Blackberry Users\n\nBy Isaac Kendall | 26 Apr 2010 01:17 |\n\nThankfully we don't travel with steamer trunks anymore. But for business travel we still hump around the country with a travel suitcase AND the coveted laptop bag. With products like the Blackberry Presenter we dare to dream that we can travel without the laptop.\n\nIt's great that the laptop isn't needed to do PowerPoint presentations but there are times when printing documents on the go still require a laptop. Well now RIM, FedEx, and Hilton have joined forces with HP to enable the Enterprise Blackberry user more laptop independent. Hit the jump for the full release.\n\nPALO ALTO, Calif., April 21, 2010 - HP today announced a new services delivery platform - the HP MPS Smart Decision Suite - that enables customers to better analyse, report and predict the use of their imaging and printing devices through an HP Managed Print Services (MPS) engagement.\n\nIn addition, HP introduced HP ePrint Enterprise mobile printing solution, based on HP CloudPrint technology and available on the BlackBerry®smartphone.(1) This announcement is the result of HP and Research In Motion's (RIM) strategic alliance announced last year and is the first use case of HP's ePrint strategy. HP ePrint also will be available at public print locations through FedEx Office and Hilton Worldwide, providing mobile enterprise workers a secure remote printing experience.(2)\n\nCustomers who have recently selected HP MPS include ISS Facility Services, America First Credit Union and Rosemount Inc.\n\n\"Our enterprise customers need us to help them bring order to the chaos of their technology fleet,\" said Bruce Dahlgren, senior vice president, Managed Enterprise Solutions, Imaging and Printing Group, HP. \"Today, we can show them proven return on investment with the right mix of software tools, workflow solutions and mobile workflow innovations - bringing it all together through a scalable Managed Print Services engagement.\"\n\nManage environment to increase visibility and efficiency\n\nFor an enhanced management experience, the HP MPS Smart Decision Suite integrates front-end capabilities with back-end services infrastructure. By enhancing IT visibility and providing greater access into printing fleets, the suite enables global standard delivery processes and capabilities. This provides customers with a strategic view of device and solution availability, an optimally deployed fleet, real-time access to information and, as a result, improved efficiency and cost savings.\n\nTo help customers better manage telecommuting workforces, HP has extended the HP Web Jetadmin offering to allow IT departments to configure both networked and USB-connected devices and write rules-based printing, including items such as automatic duplexing and color access control.\n\nImprove workflow to strengthen productivity and reduce costs\n\nCreated in collaboration with RIM, HP ePrint Enterprise enables employees to print from their BlackBerry smartphones to printers on their trusted network and to printers at HP ePrint-supported locations and FedEx Office.\n\nMany HP ePrint locations are powered by the PrinterOn® network of public printers, called PrintSpots®. PrinterOn is HP's print network partner for relevant print locations, including Hilton Worldwide.\n\n• More than 1,300 hotels in the Hilton Worldwide portfolio of brands have PrintSpots in the PrinterOn network, including Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, Conrad Hotels & Resorts, Hilton Hotels, Doubletree, Embassy Suites Hotels, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton Hotels and Homewood Suites by Hilton. Hilton has announced today its intention to enable the HP ePrint technology in June 2010.\n\n• Additionally, FedEx Office (formerly FedEx Kinko's) is implementing the solution across its network of more than 1,800 locations, giving users access to ePrint through the world's largest retail printing network. The deployment for FedEx Office is scheduled for later this year.\n\nHP Enterprise Production Print Solutions consists of a suite of options that provide companies with onsite, offsite and near-site production print capabilities.\n\n• HP Onsite Copy/Print and Mailroom Services enable comprehensive day-to-day operations management.\n\n• HP Enterprise Services Document Processing Services specialize in digitizing, storing, archiving and retrieving documents - and include high-volume print and mail services.\n\n• HP Virtual Print Center, a turnkey HP portal available with MPS contracts, enables users to efficiently produce, manage and distribute printed materials on demand.\n\nHP also introduced solutions from HP Exstream, a fully integrated software platform for creating, managing and delivering customized customer communications in high-volume, on-demand and interactive environments.\n\n• HP Exstream Application Manager shares data across applications, streamlines content integration and centralizes content compliance.\n\n• HP Exstream Command Center streamlines production processes through automated job scheduling and helps maximize return on investment by efficiently managing throughput across production engines.\n\nOptimize infrastructure to save costs\n\nLast week, FedEx Office announced it will use Canon and HP as sole-source providers in their respective printing categories and will deploy more than 12,000 new Canon and HP printing devices across more than 1,800 locations in the United States and Canada.\n\nHP's alliance with Canon is yielding global results. Recent work together includes offering the latest devices from Canon's imageRUNNER ADVANCE lineup as part of an HP MPS engagement.\n\nHP has expanded the HP Printing Payback Guarantee, an industry-first program designed to provide companies risk-free entry into HP MPS engagements, to Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.\n\nScalable and flexible HP Managed Print Services\n\nHP continues to offer broad, flexible procurement options with HP MPS, based on agreed upon print policies with enterprise customers. Billing options include Level Pay, Base + Click, Cost Per Page and cost per page with no minimums.\n\nFlexible financing solutions and sale-leaseback services also are offered from HP Financial Services, the company's leasing and life cycle asset management services subsidiary.\n\nEnabling the channel\n\nHP will offer HP Access Control Printing Solutions through the channel as part of its strategy to enable reseller partners to be more competitive. Today's offerings are an extension of the imaging and printing channel enhancements the company announced in September 2009.\n\nHP Access Control Printing Solutions help mitigate security and compliance risks by helping to control and protect access to imaging and printing devices and documents and to facilitate tracking and monitoring the usage of documents. The solutions available to customers through reseller partners include: HP Access Control Intelligent Print Manager, HP Access Control Job Accounting and HP Access Control Secure Print Express.\n\nDetailed information on these new solutions and services is available on the What's New page.
