        "text": "Web-based photo sharing and printing service\n\nSnapfish is a web-based photo sharing and photo printing service owned by Shutterfly based in San Francisco, California.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nSnapfish was launched in 1999 by business partners Rajil Kapoor, Bala Parthasarathy,[1] Suneet Wadhwa, and Shripati Acharya.[citation needed] Ben Nelson joined soon thereafter as corporate development operations lead, to become CFO and later president and CEO. Jasbir Patel was named president and CEO in January 2017.[2]\n\nOn October 30, 2001, the service was acquired by District Photo for an undisclosed amount.[3]\n\nIn 2004, Snapfish opened a physical retail concept store in Alexandria, Virginia, but later closed it.[4]\n\nThe next year, Snapfish was bought by Hewlett-Packard[5] for $300 million while Nelson was CEO,[6] even though the service's revenue at the time was less than $100 million.\n\nNelson continued to run the company as an HP subsidiary. During this time, Snapfish partnered with Walgreens, Costco, and Walmart.[7]\n\nIn August 2013, Snapfish announced on their local websites (and through a mailing to members) that they were shutting down the service in Belgium, India, the Netherlands and Spain.[8]\n\nIn April 2015, HP reached an agreement to sell Snapfish back to District Photo. Under the terms of the sale, HP allowed the company to continue to use its printing services.[9]\n\nDuring a website conversion in 2016, the service experienced a data loss. Photos prior to January 2014 were unable to be migrated to the new website system. Snapfish said that although some photo albums were recovered, others would remain empty. Typically Snapfish has three versions of images: high resolution, low resolution, and printable images. Both the high and low resolution images were lost and the backup files for the printable images were not recoverable.[10]\n\nOn September 28, 2018, it was announced that Snapfish would acquire CafePress for more than $25 million.[11][12] The acquisition was completed on November 9, 2018.[13]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, Apollo Global Management announced that it would acquire both Snapfish and its rival Shutterfly in separate deals valued at around $3 billion in total. The two companies would be merged into a single entity, with Snapfish parent company District Photo as a minority stakeholder.[14] The merger of Shutterfly and Snapfish was completed on January 8, 2020.[15]\n\nOn May 4, 2020, it was announced that Snapfish will no longer be providing the platform for Boots Photo in the UK and Ireland from May 13, 2020.[16]\n\nOn September 1, 2020, it was announced that PlanetArt had acquired CafePress from Snapfish/Shutterfly.[17]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nSnapfish Lab, a service of HP Labs\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
