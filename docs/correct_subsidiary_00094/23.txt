Hewlett-Packard plans to make its Snapfish service a bigger fish in the digital-photo business. The company on Tuesday said it plans to take over privately held German company Bilderservice.de, which operates the Pixaco digital-photo services.

With the acquisition, HP would extend many of its Snapfish offerings to Pixaco, which is available in 11 European countries. HP acquired Snapfish in March.
