Snapfish is a division of HP (Hewlett Packard) and is a well known online photo service started in 2004. Snapfish's products not only include photo books, but also other personalized items including invitations, mugs, address labels, posters, prints, puzzles, canvas prints.

Both hardcover and softcover photo books in both landscape and square orientation are available and Snapfish's software is online. You upload your photos to the site and you can share and store your photos for free.

Snapfishâ€™s book making software is easy to use and is geared towards making a more simple photo book as the layouts are not customizable.

For more information and for actual photos of my Snapfish photo book, check out my Snapfish comparison to MyPublisher or my comparison review of Snapfish, MyPublisher, Mpix, and Blurb.
