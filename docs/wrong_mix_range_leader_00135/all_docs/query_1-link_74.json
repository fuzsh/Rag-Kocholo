        "meta_description": "In multiple sclerosis (MS) disease, the importance of the intrathecal B cell response classically revealed as IgG oligoclonal bands (OCB) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was reaffirmed again in the recently revised diagnostic criteria. We aimed to optimize Laboratory investigation by testing the performance of new B cell-related molecules in CSF (Ig free light chains (FLCκ and λ) and CXCL13 (B-Cell Attracting chemokine1)) for MS diagnosis. 320 paired (CSF-serum) samples were collected from 160 patients with MS (n = 82) and non-MS diseases (n = 78). All patients benefited from IgG index determination, OCB detection, CSF CXCL13 and FLC (κ and λ) measurement in CSF and serum for metrics calculation (κ/λ ratio, FLC-related indexes, and κFLC-intrathecal fraction (IF)). CXCL13 and FLC metrics in CSF were higher in patients with MS and positive OCB. As expected, κFLC metrics—in particular, κFLC index and κFLC IF—had the highest accuracy for MS diagnosis. κ index showed the best performance (sensitivity 83% and specificity 91.7%) at a cut-off of 14.9. Most of the FLC-related parameters were positively correlated with IgG index and the level of CXCL13. In conclusion, the quantitative, standardizable, and technically simple CSF FLCκ metrics seem to be reliable for MS diagnosis, but could not replace OCB detection. CXCL13 appears to be an effective parameter reflecting the intrathecal B cell response. An optimized way for CSF testing combining the conventional and the new B cell-related parameters is proposed in this study.",

        "text": "In this study, in addition to the conventional tests (IgG index calculation, Reiber Diagram, CSF Isofocusing test) (Table 1), we investigated other B lymphocyte-related parameters in CSF (the κFLC and λFLC metrics, the chemokine CXCL13) and studied their performance for MS diagnosis and their correlation with the intrathecal humoral immune response (Table 2).\n\nFree light chain-related parameters in CSF\n\nFLC levels and ratio in CSF\n\nIn this study, the mean value of κFLC (but not λFLC) level in CSF was significantly higher in the MS group than in the control group. When comparing all patients according to the OCB positivity, both types of FLC were significantly higher in the OCB-positive group than in the OCB-negative group.\n\nWe also noticed that κFLC and λFLC were undetectable in CSF of 26/160 (16.25%) and 62/160 (38.75%) included patients, respectively. Among the 26 patients with an undetectable level of κFLC in CSF, only 4 were MS patients, and all of them were OCB negative. It is interesting to note that for the remaining 22 non-MS patients with an undetectable level of κFLC, 19 were OCB-negative, 2 OCB-positive, and 1 with one band in CSF.\n\nThe calculated mean value of the κ/λ ratio in CSF was significantly higher in the MS group than in the non-MS group (7.8 vs 3.8; p = 0.003) and in OCB-positive than in OCB-negative patients (9 vs 1.3; p < 0.001) (Table 2). The distribution of this parameter in the different studied groups is represented in Fig. 1. The correlation study of the different CSF levels with EDSS in MS patients demonstrated a trend to significant correlation between this score of clinical disability and the κ/λ ratio (r = − 0.3; p = 0.052).\n\nRegarding serum results, levels of the 2 FLC were slightly higher in the non-MS group and OCB-negative patients.\n\nComparison of FLC metrics\n\nMS vs non-MS patients\n\nAs expected, the mean value of κ index, κIgG index, and κFLC IF in MS patients were significantly higher in MS patients than in non-MS group (p < 0.001). The λ FLC-related parameters (λFLC index and λIgG index) were also higher in the MS group, with a significant difference for the λFLC index (Table 2).\n\nThe comparison of the 4 indexes distribution between the MS and non-MS groups was illustrated in Fig. 2A,B. The quantitative analysis demonstrated that, in addition to κFLC-related indexes, λ FLC-related indexes are significantly higher in the group of patients with MS disease in comparison with the control group.\n\nOCB-positive vs OCB-negative patients\n\nConsidering the total cohort, κ index and κFLC IF were significantly higher in the group where OCB was detected in comparison with the group without OCB in CSF. However, for the λ index, there was no significant difference between the compared groups. The κIgG index (and not the λIgG index) was significantly higher in presence of OCB.\n\nThe comparative distribution of the κ index and λ index according to the status (MS, non-MS) and the OCB detection (positive, negative) is shown in Fig. 3.\n\nThe mean level of κ index in OCB-negative MS patients was 16.6 ± 22.1 (1.75–88.2). This mean was 25.92 ± 29.8 in OCB-positive non-MS patients. The λFLC index and the ratio were also higher in the non-MS group with OCB. However, κIgG index and λIgG index were lower in OCB-positive non-MS patients when compared to the OCB-negative MS group.\n\nFLC indexes thresholds for MS diagnosis (ROC)\n\nA ROC curve analysis was created with data from both MS and non-MS diagnosed patients. A very high performance of the κ-index for the discrimination of MS diagnosis from non-MS disorders was reflected by an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.910 (Fig. 4A). We also generated a ROC curve of κ-index for the detection of OCB in CSF in the whole sample (Fig. 4B) and found a slightly higher performance of κ-index in the discrimination of OCB-positive patients (AUC: 0.917). Thus, in our study, this parameter seems to have a very interesting capacity for discrimination in both situations. On the other hand, the comparative ROC analysis (Fig. 4C) including IgG index, κ-index, λ-index, and κ/λ ratio to discriminate MS patients from non-MS patients revealed that AUC of κ-index and κ-IgG index were slightly higher than the conventional IgG index. The other studied parameters (λ indexes and FLC ratio) were less accurate than IgG index for MS diagnosis.\n\nAccording to the ROC curves relative to the discrimination of MS diagnosis (Fig. 4A,C,D), we determined the cut-off corresponding to the best performance of the parameter (combination of sensitivity and specificity) for a diagnostic purpose (Table 3). According to Table 3, it seems that using a cut-off of 14.9, κ-index has the best performance for MS diagnosis in our Tunisian population. It is notable that in our MS group, using this cut-off, there were 6 cases of OCB-positive patients with a high κ index (> 14.9) and normal IgG index. No MS patients had a profile with a normal κ index/high IgG index.\n\nκFLC reibergram\n\nUsing the software “FLC-κ statistics and graphic program” for Free Light Chains κ, we generated a graphical result for MS and non-MS patients (Fig. 5A) and we calculated and compared the mean values and the distribution of the fraction κFLC IF between groups (Fig. 5B). We also tested the performance of κFLC IF for MS diagnosis using a ROC curve (Fig. 6).\n\nAccording to the ROC curve, diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.926) of κ-FLC IF was slightly higher than the κFLC index. For a cut-off of 54.9%, the sensitivity was as high as 92.3%, with a specificity of 75%. With a higher cut-off of 80%, the specificity reached 90.7%, with a sensitivity of 8.5%.\n\nTests combination\n\nIn OCB-negative MS patients, 5/19 (26.3%) cases had a combination of high κ index (cut-off: 14.9) and high IgG index (cut-off: 0.7). This profile (double increased indexes) was not found in any OCB-negative non-MS patients (n = 51).\n\nCXCL13 in CSF\n\nIn the second step of the study, the CXCL13 level was measured in the CSF of the study population (n = 160). To evaluate the comparative distribution in the presence and absence of MS diagnosis and an IS of IgG, Means, medians, and quartiles of CXCL13 levels in CSF have been calculated. The same comparison has been performed between different subgroups of MS patients (Table 4).\n\nAs expected, levels of CXCL13 were significantly higher in the MS patients in comparison with the non-MS group (p = 0.029) (Table 4, Fig. 7A).\n\nConsidering the total population, the level of this chemokine was significantly higher in patients with a detected intrathecal humoral immune response (calculated IgG index ≥ 0.7, OCB in CSF (Isofocusing test) or an IS of IgG (Reiber diagram)) than the corresponding negative group (Table 4). The comparative distribution of CXCL13 between OCB-positive and OCB-negative patients is shown in Fig. 7B.\n\nIn the MS group, under clustering according to the previous parameters (calculated IgG index < or ≥ 0.7, positive or negative OCB in CSF, and detection or not of an IS of IgG (Reiber diagram)), the statistical significance was found only between subgroups with high and low mean of IgG index. On the other hand, the CXCL13 level in CSF was not correlated with the clinical disability evaluated by the score EDSS in the MS group.\n\nCorrelation study of B cell-related parameters in CSF\n\nResults of the correlation analysis of the studied B cell-related parameters (IgG, FLC κ and λ metrics and CXCL13) were summarized in Table 5. Our findings revealed that the κ index was in positive correlation with all the other studied CSF parameters. Overall, it seems that most of the FLC-related parameters (except the λIgG index) were positively correlated with the IgG index and with the level of CXCL13 chemokine.\n\nCurrently, B cells are reported to be major contributors to the pathogenesis of MS, an inflammatory neurodegenerative disorder of the CNS characterized by an intrathecal humoral immune response4. To reveal these IS of affinity-maturated IgG antibodies considered a hallmark of the disease, MS biological investigation is mainly based on the detection of IgG OCB by parallel CSF and serum samples testing using an isoelectric focusing technique, known as the gold standard for CSF assessment in this context32. Recently, OCB detection has been included in the revised criteria of McDonald 2017 for MS, which has permitted the substitution of the dissemination in time criterion.\n\nHowever, some limitations of OCBs detection are still reported in clinical practice. From the laboratory's point of view, the imprecise number of bands in the CSF defining positive results33, the need for some expertise to perform the technique—a relatively laborious method, partially automatized—and the lack of standardization34 are some reported issues for the practice of the test and the validation of its results. In addition, OCBs detection is not specific enough for MS diagnosis35 and can be missed in a subgroup of authentic MS36. Taking all of this into account, an additional indicator may be needed to improve the biological diagnosis of MS. Recently, standard assays to measure other B cell-related biomarkers in CSF—the κ and λ FLC and the chemokine CXCL13 responsible for B cell recruitment within the CNS—have been studied and seem to improve the detection of the intrathecal B cells activity. In general, the detection of high levels of the polyclonal form of FLC was observed in many inflammatory and auto-immune disorders, which has led to testing their relevance as a biomarker of disease activity and as an attractive therapeutic target. Polyclonal FLC overproduction can occur when there is an excess production of Ig, as a consequence of chronic immune stimulation. During the inflammatory process, FLC seem to inhibit the apoptosis of inflammatory immune cells such as neutrophils and bind to a broad range of cell membranes (high affinity with monocytes).\n\nTherefore, in this study, we aimed to optimize the diagnostic algorithm using routinely available and recently reported Laboratory tests to reveal the IS of IgG and to discriminate MS patients from non-MS patients with symptoms of central neurological disorders. Indeed, in our laboratory, we have started performing FLC and CXCL13 measurements within the routine CSF investigation for central neuroinflammation since January 2018. In the present study, we tried to compare the performance and the usefulness of different CSF parameters related to B cell activity (IgG, OCB, κ and λ FLC metrics, CXCL13) for the detection of IS and MS diagnosis, in a cohort of Tunisian patients. We also tested the κFLC data interpretation using the new hyperbolic reference range in quotient diagrams37. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study interested in the diagnostic value of the recently described B cell-related parameters (Immunoglobulin FLC in CSF and their related parameters, and CXCL13 chemokine responsible for B cell recruitment within the CNS) in Tunisian and North African population. Such findings should be very helpful for MS clinicians treating diverse patient populations.\n\nAs expected, our main findings revealed that the κFLC-related parameters, in particular the κFLC index and the intrathecal fraction κFLCIF, which consider serum FLC levels as well as BBB function, reached the highest accuracy in MS diagnosis and IS detection. Regarding CXCL13 measurement in CSF, it seems to be an effective parameter reflecting the inflammatory intrathecal B cell response and may be suggested to take part in the diagnostic but mainly the prognostic investigation in MS disease.\n\nCSF parameters\n\nWhen considering our global results of FLC measurement in CSF, 26/160 patients had an undetectable level of κFLC with our nephelometric technique, only 4 of them were diagnosed with MS and they were all OCB-negative MS patients. These findings are in line with those reported in the study of Sanz Diaz et al.29; where authors found that 160/252 (63.8%) patients had undetectable κ-FLC levels in CSF (turbidimetric technique), of whom 157 did not have MS. These results lead them to conclude that it is justified to obviate OCB testing in patients with suspicion of MS having undetectable κ-FLC levels in CSF unless there is strong clinical suspicion. Our findings comfort this proposed strategy, which should allow saving reagent costs and labor time for unnecessary OCB testing.\n\nWhen comparing our CSF findings relative to each type of FLC, and as expected, κ production in CSF appears to be a much more interesting quantitative parameter than λFLC; Indeed, κFLC is associated with the IS of IgG (OCB) and with MS disease, while λ level in CSF seems to be only related to the intrathecal activity of B Lymphocytes and not specifically to the disease. Indeed, several studies from different non-African continents have indicated that during MS, abnormal intrathecal production of these FLC occur, resulting in increased κ and, to a lesser extent, λ FLC levels in the CSF of patients24,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48. It has been described that after B cell activation, plasma cells secrete an excess of κ and λ FLC, in addition to intact Ig production. FLC do not appear to derive from the degradation of the whole IgG49. These parameters may therefore represent a potential quantitative tool to detect the IS of IgG and support MS diagnosis.\n\nAnother interesting result in our CSF findings is that the mean value of the κ/λ ratio in CSF was significantly higher in the MS group than in the non-MS group and in OCB-positive than in OCB-negative patients. In addition, our study revealed a trend for a significant correlation between the score of clinical disability (EDSS) and this ratio. In fact, it has been demonstrated that CSF κ/λ ratios, determined at the time of diagnostic lumbar puncture, may predict the progression of MS disease (EDSS at 5 years postdiagnosis) and thus may be useful as a prognostic biomarker for early therapeutic stratification50. Interestingly, the same study demonstrated that the high κ/λFLC ratio in CSF (good prediction of disability accumulation) seems to result from a selective expansion of κ light chain-expressing plasmablasts revealed within the CSF of MS patients and is not an epiphenomenon of FLC measurement. Other authors reported that the CSF FLC ratio may predict the conversion from CIS (clinically isolated syndrome) to MS disease38.\n\nFLC metrics\n\nOverall, κFLC metrics were more performant for MS diagnosis and detection of the IS than λFLC-related parameters. Results of the comparative sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the κ and λFLC metrics for MS diagnosis in our Tunisian population confirmed the reported vast superiority of κFLC-related parameters described in other populations. In particular, the κFLC index and κFLC IF showed the best accuracy for MS diagnosis. The higher clinical relevance of κFLC in MS could be relatively explained by the fact that the κ chain is rearranged first during Ig production and is consequently quantitatively more dominant in the human body. In addition, λFLC are usually found in a dimeric form while κFLC are mostly monomeric51.\n\nOn the other hand, FLC, as proteins detected in the CSF, originated in part from the blood by diffusion across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) but could also be produced within the CNS during pathological conditions, such as MS disease52. It is therefore necessary to differentiate the locally synthesized intrathecal fraction of FLC from the blood-derived fraction. Two approaches to studying the intrathecal fraction of κFLC have been established and evaluated: the known linear approach (in analogy to IgG index) by calculating the FLC index (for both types of FLC) with reference to a determined cut-off, and a non-linear function for the κ chain (in analogy to Reiber’s formula) by coupling each QFLC (CSF FLC/serum FLC) to its corresponding Qalb dependent upper normal limit (Qlim FLC). In the Two approaches, Qalbis considered a well-established parameter for BBB status and function, and the inter-individual variability of serum FLC levels is taken into account52. Non-linear functions are in general considered more representative of the physiological conditions and appear to be superior in case of barrier dysfunction53,54. However, the linear IgG index formula is relatively simpler to perform in routine.\n\nIn our study, and according to the ROC curves analysis, κ metrics were overall more accurate than the classical Total IgG index for MS diagnosis. In particular, κFLC IF (AUC: 0.926) accuracy was slightly higher than the κFLC index (AUC: 0.910) and than IgG index (AUC:0.874). This finding is in line with the results of previous studies where κFLC IF has been found to be the more accurate metric compared to κ index and conventional parameters55. Evaluation of κFLC with this hyperbolic reference range in quotient diagrams seems to decrease the number of false-positive/-negative cases in the presence of low/high albumin quotients, which allows a most reliable interpretation of the data56. Other authors reported that both linear and non-linear approaches have a similar performance in patients with normal or only slightly elevated Qalb57 and that diagnostic accuracy does not differ between the κFLC index and κFLCIF58,59,60. Therefore, we can consider κFLC IF as a very promising parameter in the context of MS suspicion, having at least the same diagnostic accuracy as the κ index.\n\nAnother interesting finding in our study is the high percentage of the intrathecal fraction IF detected using the diagram in our MS patients (mean 86.87%). Indeed, it has been described that this intrathecal fraction of CSF FLC is greater than 80% in most MS patients61, which can reflect that the contribution of blood-derived FLC to total CSF FLC concentration is very low in MS cases with intrathecal synthesis. This observation has led some authors to use QFLC (without considering BBB function)59,62,63,64, or even the absolute CSF FLC concentrations65 for MS laboratory investigation.\n\nWith a cut-off of 14.9, the κFLC index showed a sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 91.7%, and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 91.8%. These values are within the correspondent range of values reported for this parameter in different populations25,39,40,41,66,67. Interestingly, both sensitivity and specificity of the κFLC index were higher than OCB detection (using the Isofocusing test) for MS diagnosis in our same Tunisian population (77.6% and 81.8%, respectively as mentioned in our previous published study)68. By focusing on our MS group, there were 6 cases of OCB-positive patients with a high κ index (> 14.9)/normal IgG index and no MS cases with the inverse profile. This could reflect, in the context of MS suspicion, the higher sensitivity and the more reliability of the κ index as a quantitative test for the detection of intrathecal antibody production. In the OCB-negative MS subgroup, 5/19 (26.3%) cases had a combination of high κ (cut-off: 14.9) index and IgG index. No OCB-negative non-MS patients (n = 51) showed this profile, which could reveal the usefulness of the combination of κ and IgG indexes in case of strong MS suspicion with a negative result in the OCB detection test.\n\nRegarding MRZ Reaction testing in our population, it was found as a very specific test (91.9%) with a very good PPV (93.9%) but a relatively moderate sensitivity (65%) in another previous study performed in our laboratory69. MRZ reaction has been proposed as a very specific-second line test for CSF investigation, especially when OCB is negative or equivocal and/or when the clinical context is confusing. In the present comparative study, the κFLC index had similar specificity to the MRZ reaction with much better sensitivity.\n\nAs mentioned above, the intrathecal fraction κ-FLC IF determined using the software “FLC-κ statistics and graphic program” for κFLC showed a slightly higher diagnostic accuracy than the κFLC index. For a cut-off of 54.9%, the sensitivity reached 92.3% (specificity: 75%). With a higher cut-off of 80%, the specificity was 90.7% (sensitivity: 80.6%).\n\nIn addition to κFLC index and κFLC IF, the concentrations of FLC and IgG have been evaluated in our study using the same formula for the diagnosis of MS (κIgG index and λIgG index), as an innovative approach which has been just described and tested70. CSF concentrations of FLC and IgG are known to be increased in MS patients, but they have never been used in the same algorithm. Our findings showed that the κIgG index (and not the λIgG index) has a diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.890) close to that of the κFLC index (AUC: 0.910) and is significantly higher in patients groups with MS and with positive OCB in CSF. This new tested parameter also showed interesting sensitivity and specificity for MS diagnosis when considering a cut-off of 2.4. In the study of Gudowska-Sawczuk et al.70, authors reported a significant difference in κIgG index and λIgG index values between MS patients and controls having other neurological disorders, with a higher diagnostic significance for κIgG index compared with the λIgG index in this context. Regarding OCB, in the same study, κIgG appeared to be useful in pattern differentiation. This parameter was significantly higher in patients with type 2 patterns in comparison with those with patterns type 1 and 4. Only the values of this parameter were markedly higher in patients with pattern type 3 than patterns type 4 and 1. Taking into account all these data, this parameter could be considered a good candidate for further studies with a larger patient group size.\n\nCXCL13 level in CSF\n\nIn the last part of our study, we analyzed another B cell-related parameter in CSF, which is the molecule CXCL13, also called B-Cell Attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1) or B-Lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC). This chemokine plays an important role in B cell recruitment within the CNS during inflammatory disorders. It has a crucial role in the development of secondary lymphoid nodules and the regulation of lymphocyte migration. In these conditions, CXCL13 is mainly expressed by monocytes/macrophages/microglia but can also be produced by follicular dendritic cells. The Receptor for this molecule (CXCR5/BLR1) is found mainly on B cells and T-cells (about 20% of CSF TCD4+) and monocytes- macrophages26,71,72.\n\nIn our study, the CXCL13 level in CSF was significantly higher in the MS group in comparison with the non-MS group (mostly inflammatory conditions of CNS). In fact, several studies reported CXCL13 as a potential marker of inflammation in CSF and high levels of this molecule have been reported in CSF during MS (RRMS, PPMS, and CIS disease courses)26,27,28 and NMO conditions73, while very high CSF levels have been described in MS mimics, such as CNS lymphoma, neuroborreliosis (where CXCL13 is described as a specific biomarker) and viral miningitis74. The CSF levels of CXCL13 in our MS group seem slightly higher than in other studies26,27,28,75,76. Indeed, in our study, most of the patients had a RRMS and all of them were in relapse at the time of sampling. It has been reported that during MS relapse, Levels of CXCL13 are higher and the positive correlations between these levels and other molecules that are essential for B-cell recruitment, survival, and maturation (B-cell activating factor (BAFF), IL-6, and IL-10) seem to be crucial to driving the B-cell response26,28,75,76. Regarding levels in the non-MS group, there is a big heterogeneity of findings since it depends on the type of other inflammatory or non-inflammatory diseases included, where production of CXCL13 in the CNS could vary greatly27,73,76.\n\nOn the other hand, considering the total population of our study, CXCL13 was significantly higher in patients with a positive intrathecal humoral immune response (IgG index ≥ 0.7, OCB in CSF (the Isofocusing test) or an IS of IgG according to the Reiber diagram)) than the corresponding negative group. In addition, CSF levels of this chemokine were in positive correlation with CSF markers of intrathecal B cell activity, in particular, IgG index, κFLC metrics (κ index; κIgG index), and κ/λ ratio. These findings were consistent with the results of other studies where CXCL13 levels were demonstrated to correlate strongly with the IS of Ig (IgG level in CSF, IgG index, number of OCB, BAFF level in CSF) as well as the presence of B cells, plasmablasts and T cells (or the number of inflammatory cells)28,72,76,77.\n\nSome authors also mentioned that in the MS group, patients with IS of IgG had higher CXCL13 levels than patients without IgG synthesis, which was observed in our study with a significant difference. Therefore, CXCL13 seems to be a marker of intrathecal inflammation rather than a specific parameter for MS diagnosis. It is an important mediator in the inflammatory cascade associated with the polyspecific intrathecal B cell response classically revealed by IgG index or OCB. This chemokine could therefore be a potential candidate biomarker to evaluate the efficiency of B-cell targeting therapy during MS. This hypothesis has been studied in Rituximab-treated MS patients, where it has been shown that CXCL13 levels in the CSF decrease significantly under treatment78. In addition, as a factor that attracts and maintains B and T cells in inflamed CNS lesions, both CXCL13 and its receptor CXCR5 have been suggested as therapeutic targets in MS72.\n\nRegarding MS prognosis, much evidence demonstrated that CXCL13 could be considered an effective marker of severity and activity of the disease. This chemokine has shown an association with disease exacerbations and unfavorable prognosis in RRMS. A significant positive correlation between CXCL13 level in CSF and relapse rate, clinical disability (EDSS), and the number of MRI lesions have been described. In addition, a high level of this molecule was predictive of CIS conversion to MS76. In our study, no correlation with EDSS results was found, which can be explained by the relatively small size of the MS group. In the study of Di Sano et al., the CXCL13 index was calculated, and this parameter was also reported to be an excellent candidate prognostic biomarker for predicting MS disease activity79.\n\nRegarding patient stratification, the CXCL13 level in CSF could identify an MS subgroup with higher CSF leukocyte counts and early evidence of cortical thinning reflecting the disease severity75.\n\nIn clinically and radiologically stable patients, it has been reported that a significant proportion still showed increased CSF levels of CXCL13 (in addition to neurofilament) indicating residual disease activity. Thus, this chemokine seems to be more sensitive than clinical and MRI features in revealing disease activity80.\n\nWe propose that CSF CXCL13 measurement, as an effective parameter reflecting the inflammatory intrathecal B cell response, can be part of the diagnostic but mainly the prognostic work-up in MS. It has been particularly reported as a helpful tool in future treatment decisions.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study interested in the diagnostic value of FLC in CSF and their related parameters in the Tunisian and North African populations. In addition, our study has interestingly tested concomitantly almost all the κ and λ FLC metrics described so far (CSF levels of κ and λ FLC, κ/λ CSF ratio, κ, and λ FLC indexes, κ, and λIgG indexes, κFLC IF), in addition to the recently reported software “FLC-κ statistics and graphic program”. The performance of these parameters has been studied comparatively, and they have also been compared to the performance of routine tests (especially OCBs and MRZ reaction) reported in our previous studies including the same populations. Furthermore, our study is one of the very rare publications interested in the concomitant evaluation of CXCL13 (responsible for B cell recruitment within the CNS) and FLC levels in CSF during MS. There is a single study81 where both biomarkers have been evaluated in CSF during rituximab treatment, however, this study included only 9 treated MS patients, and the statistical analysis was very limited with no relevant results regarding these 2 parameters. However, this study presents some limitations, such as its monocentric characteristic and the relatively small number of patients included.\n\nFinally, we aimed to optimize the algorithm of routine CSF investigation for MS diagnosis and prognosis by adding the new effective, simple, available, and standardizable laboratory parameters. Based on our previous68,69 and present findings and the above literature data, we suggest that:\n\nInitial measurement of automatized κ-FLC in CSF allows obviating OCB testing in case of undetectable levels in patients with suspicion of MS unless there is strong clinical suspicion.\n\nComplete Calculation of IgG index, κ-index values, and evaluation of FLC-κ Reibergram (κFLC IF) as the next automatized, relatively simple, rapid, and standardizable step of effective screening for IS detection and therefore, MS diagnosis to obtain the highest sensitivity and accuracy.\n\nThis CSF investigation is followed by the CSF Isofocusing test (OCB detection) if available, with a combined interpretation of all previous parameters (especially the κ and IgG indexes) and the clinical context.\n\nAs an optional additional step, in remaining confusing cases, MRZ Reaction could be performed (highest specificity for MRZ Reaction with a good sensitivity when combined with OCB detection).\n\nCXCL13 measurement in CSF can take part in the armamentarium for the work-up in MS, especially for prognostic evaluation (good prognostic biomarker for MS activity and prediction of treatment response).\n\nIn conclusion, this study highlights the usefulness and accuracy of CSF examination in the diagnosis of MS, by demonstrating the high performance of the newly described CSF B cell-related parameters (especially the intrathecal κFLC metrics) in this context, in addition to the well-established (OCB detection, IgG index…) routine laboratory tests.\n\nOverall, the determination of FLC metrics in CSF seems to have many advantages over the established CSF parameters detecting the IS of IgG. They appear to be valuable and supportive additional quantitative parameters in CSF investigation for MS diagnosis but may not replace the gold standard OCB detection. These clinically reliable parameters are technically simple, rapid, standardizable, and offer objective results. In particular, κ-related metrics are more sensitive than the other quantitative and qualitative tests for IS detection with good specificity. The calculation of κ index and the interpretation of κ-FLC data using a diagram with a hyperbolic reference range (considering the BBB status) showed the best accuracy for MS diagnosis. However, FLC-related parameters do not inform about the clonality of the IS, which is one of the advantages of OCB detection using the Isofocusing test. On the other hand, CXCL13 appears as an established mediator of the inflammatory cascade associated with the polyspecific B cell response and it has been reported to be promising in prognosis evaluation and prediction (activity of the disease, treatment decisions…). A CSF testing combining conventional and new biological tools (quantitative standardizable tests) may certainly improve the performance of MS investigation."
