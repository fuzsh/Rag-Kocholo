The Syrian president said to him, \"When we met to make a decision to go into Lebanon, you and Naji Jamil were urging the front to adopt a decision to go in, and that daq I was reluctant because of all the political considerations. Today, it was decided that it is necessary _ for us to remain in Lebanon to protect its unit~? and Arabism within the framework of Syria's nationalist role, and I see you urging withdrawal. wtsy. . Khalid Bakdash replied, \"I understand the situation. I am satisfied with your answer, Mr President.\" ~ This is what the source told AL WATAN AL='ARABI's special correspondent - to Damascus. He is trustworthy and very well-informed. Perhaps the most significant thing that a Syrian official told a Beirut leader who visited Damascus recently was: \"There are operations being carried out by political forces in Lebanon, with in~c~rnational connections, to smuggle arms into certain Gulf states by way of Syria, under the guise o f goods destined for export. We have uncovered some of these operations, but military reports reveal that more than 36,000 weapons have been smuggled into the Gulf area thanks to th~se networks.\" AL WATAN AL-'ARABI reports the Syrian source's story in good faith and with strict reserve.

The following is his impressions about the situation in Syria and about Syrian-Lebanese relations, based on his cQntacts and conversations with Syrian politicians: Official Syrian sources have referred, directly and indirectly during recent weeks, to a basic change in the strategy of Syrian political action within Lebanon, in light of changes which have occurred unexpectedly in:the conditions of the area and in the Syrian internal situation itself, and in light of facts which experience has reve8led, during the last 3 years, ' regard~ing the balance of Lebanese political forcea. ' I What is happening today in Syria is the other side of what heppened in ~ Lebanon. The plot is the same in the view of observers, although its ~ instruments and some of its methods differ, and despite the fact that the elements of its success in Syria are much weaker than what they were iu , Lebanon, because of the difference of the area of action and the ; dissimilarity of levels of harmony with the winda of change. However, that does not prevent it from being the literal translation of a single ~ text rendered in two different ways. It [the plot] is based on the use of terroi and violence to incite sectarian;gtri~e, aimed at tearing apart ~ the people's cohesiveness and solidarity and shattering the state and ; _ its institutions. ~ ; While observers are trying to draw up a list comparing events of the two i countries and are examining facets of the similarity between the Aleppo ` slaughter in the artillery officers school or the parking lot incident in Latakia, with the autobus slaughter of 12 April 1975 in 'Ayn al-Rumanah, ~ a southern suburb of Beirut, and while various political circles are i detecting a chain of violence in certain Syrian cities and are connecting ~ 4 ~ ~ i FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ' ~ APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY that with what happened in Lebanon during 1975-76, it appears that the plotters are finding more difficulty in carrying through their plans in Syria and on its Cerritory because of several reasons, the most important of which is the victory of the national spirit in Syria over sectarian, regional and ethnic feelings during 30 years of carrying out the struggle. For this reason the plan aimed at shaking the people's unity has found itself in a confrontation with the regime, iti which President al-Asad has relied solely on his::personal standing, after it became evident that the party was lacking, because he is exerting greater efforts to broaden his popular base and to establish a diaiogue with other principal forces in th 2 country. _ No matter what reprecussions the crisis may have in the near or long term, there is an important lesson which the crisis has dictated to the government - and party in Syria. It is the need to change methods of dealing with incidents within Syria and in the rest of the Arab region, especially in Lebanon whose shifting sands and moving shadows alter many expectations and conflicts with them as the harvest estimate differs from the actual yield. I~ has become clear now, as AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has reported on previous occasions, that Syrian leadership is determined to make extensive changes on the governmental, party and national front levels. - Probably the changes will extend to dealing with accepted things which were a:tiomatic until recently, in order to keep the country froan giving way to the plotters' goal, and so long as the change does not affect the basic structure of the ~,overnment. Therefore it is not unlikely that the Lebanese doorway will be one of the portals through which the Syrian internal change wil~ pass. To put it more clearly, it is not unlikely that the main body of Syrian forces will - be withdrawn from Lebanon, or that their re-grouping, along with reducing their size, in specific strategic areas will be one of the principal manifestations of the change in Syria. That does not mean that Syria wants to lessen the 1eve1 of its concern t~!ith Lebanon, but it does want to fEee itself of. the burden of the details of life and the daily problems--and how many there are--in Lebanon, the total immersion and the distraction by them from Syrian internal issues and problems which have now become more imgoEtant and increasingly urgent. A senior Syrian official told me: \"President al-Asad has been preoccupied by the e~vents in ~ebanon and the Syrian presence there for the past 4 years. However now he wants to allocate a greater part of his time to Syrla's internal affairs.\" The dominant feeling in official and party circles here is that al-Asad, personally, still has a good opportunity to remedy the causes which have 5 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY i led to the pre~ent situation in the country, and also that he has the capability to once again put the wheels of goverr:~ient on track. Aowever, that requires considerable effort and daily, personal followFup in order to carry out the.public decisions and instruccions issued from the national front. He knows that whenever his other problems preoccupy him, led by Che Lebanese distractions, there are powerful forces capable of making those decieions merely ink on paper and honey sweet words of no more effect~than a wish. Therefore the trend was toward withdrawal from the daily entaglement in Lebanese details, details which have begun to revolve in a vicious - circle, no longer of any benefit, a waste of precious time for the ruling establishment in Syria, aimless and ~utile. _ Results of the Wyrian Effort in Lebanon � Syria's gain from its initiative in Lebanon since the autumn of 1976 is - scarcely worth mentcioning in proportion to the efforts ~;;iich it has made toward affecting the direction, even though there is a certain amount of - firm cooperation between Lebanese political and national forces and the _ political and national forces in Syria, not to mention the direct official relations between the two governments and the revival of traditional cooperation between the two countries and their institutions. It has been evident throughout the stages through which Syrian political strategy in Lebanon has passed, from the constitution during the regime of ~resident Sulayman Franjiyyah, to backing \"the Lebanese front\" in its progress through the crisis of 1976, and then assisting the Lebanese Government in getting past the danger of a constitutional breakdown (the election of the president, the formation of al-Huss' first government, t:he election of the president of the Chamber of Deputies and the continuati~n of parliamentary life, and the establishment of the army's first elements) and finally backing the nationa~. movement and supporting the Palest~nian resistance in the south and elsewhere, throughout all of these stages, it has been evident that Syria has only been able to find temporary allies. The need was and still is for solid popular and political bases, which will not be convulsed and vanish in regard to national allegiance, and which will be a true supportiag force for Syria in any possible military confrontation with the enemy or ~n the cold war to which the two countries have together been exposed during the international conspiracy, no longer concealed from anyone. If Syria works internally to continue the establishment of the national front, then it will still work in the Lebanese sector to create a broad national front. Its activity is also being aimed on the Palestinian level toward creating a cohesive national front which would reject th'e petty gang or the individualism concept for the benefit of any Arab-or international faction, and which would stress unity of the struggle in order to att~in final and honorable solutions to the Arab -Israeli conflict. ~ 6 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - Syria has succeeded to a large degree in its internal activity :.nd in its Palestinian policy. However, its Lebanese efforts are still being thwarted by a group of basic problems resulting from the disparity of goals and methods and the mutual ly hosCile atmoaphere in a Lehanese arena filled with variables. - A quick look at the political map reveaels how it has changed from 1576 to 1979, and hew both the national movement and the Palestinian resistance have become Syria's friend and ally in Lebanon, after the \"Lebanese front\" had been the friend and the parties of the \"nationalist front\" the aily in 1076. This makes us aware to some extent of why the Syrian leadership was compelled in this Lebanese arena to alter its plans in the fie13 and in circumstances which it does nbt consider to be natural, or rather which the facts of incidents, their developments, and their surprises farces upon them. ~ Those informed about the intricacies of the Syrian situation confirm ttiat Syria was and still is working to bolster Lebanese legal authority in the ~ int~rests of creating a broad national front. However, the waves of incompatibility which have created petty states in Lebanon since 1975, and it did not take them long to occupy tre power of government, are still in the ascendency and dangerously increasing, forcing the Lebanese Government ~ into a position of passive, powerle~s sp~ctator, instead of pursuing its basic job ;n keeping w ith the fact of Lebanese life which is that positive rule should be powerful. Thus, the Lebanese authority cloaked in legality appears to be semi-isolated, as fully as the Syrian presence, which has taken on the legal presence in Lebanon, through joint Arab desire, appears to be a presence incapable of _ performing *hE roles it aspires to, achieving Lebanon's unity, security and stabilit; in co~peration with the legal authority itself. Syria has discovered, faced with the government's isolation and its forced banishment [from affairs] resulting from organic weakness, that it must have direct dealings with the various forces in the Lebanese arena. Thus it has shown two faces: the face of cooperation with the legal government, and the face of cooperation with the illegal petty states, frequently taking _ into ac.count the legalities of the situation more than the legalities of principle. Damascus' Relations with Lebanese Political Powers If we were to take a quick look at relations existing at the present time between Damascus and the various political farces in Lebanon, they could be ~'elineated as follows: *'rThe Lebanese f~ont\": tense relations amoun�ting to a degree of hostility ` and complete mutual repugnance in the summer of 1978. They then tended toward wariness and mutual doubt. During th~ last year, attempts were _ 7 ~ FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02148: CIA-RDP82-00850R040240030014-1 ~ FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY made ta mediate between Da~nascus and the Lebanese front, but this collided ~ . w ith basic obstacles, the most important of which are the Franjiyyah family's position, the question of dealing with Israel and the Egyptian - regime, and the front's position regarding the armed Palestinian presence. Thus relations between Syria and the Lebanese front have ultimately become a kind of wary truce with both sides convinced that a military solution w ould not be beneficial. * The \"national front\": It is an old all.y of Syria, but Damascus' alliance w ith this fr~nt has created many difficulties becanse~of the turncoat relations between this front and the parties of the national movement for o ne thing, with traditional Islamic forces for another, and with the Lebanese front for a third (the direct military clash between the Syrian Nationalists [SNP] and the Kata'ib [Phalangists~). This is in addition to the fact that the \"national front\" lacks the heavy popular bases and the firmly established political preparation which ensures firm alleoiance over the course of time, in addition to confusion of authority and struggle for influence which exists within the front itself. * The \"national movement\": The nature of relations b etween Syria and the _ parties of the national movement differ and fluctuate between ordinary _ comp~iance and lukewarm friendship. While we see the Progressive Socialist - Party having good relations and employing constant frank dialogue with the Damascus authorities, under th~ direction of Walid Junblat, we note that these relations have not reached the point of an open political alliance, which is being prepared for the broad national and nationalist front, in view of the antipathy existing between this party and certain important powers within the ranks of the right and the left. As for the organization of communist action and the communist party, both their relations with the Damascus authorities appear generally tepid and many times tense, because of:the control which Syria imposes over the communists. It is a question of Syria tying it to a large extent to its internal security. As for the independent Nasirists (al-Murabitun), their increasing influence in Beirut has led to a slackening off in relations with Damascus, which rejects the principle of joining together in military authority especially ' in widp areas of the capital, and so wariness is currently dominant between the two parties. The Syrian national socialist party is just about the only party whose relations between Damascus and itself are on the basis of mutual trust, especially since the Syrian leadership played a prominent role in forming - it. However, basic doctrinal differences between Syrian nationalists and the Ba'athists are causing some reluctance in issuing a sure judgment on the fature of these relations. 8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/48: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200034414-1 I FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY There remains the various organizations, groups and minor parties which _ have no power and are more of a burden on Damascus' auth~rities than a help. Therefore, it is clear that Syria has not achieved any of the goals to - which it aspires through creating a popular national current which would _ - be a eafaty valve for Syria itaelf, even though it has been able to limit - the conspiracy's viciousneas to a conaiderabl~ extent and to weaken its - nature during the past three years. The Syrians acknowledge this fact and confirm~d it to a progressive party delegation that visited them 10 days ago. Fore~gn Minister 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam told members of the � delegation, \"Syria will reconsider i~s existing relations with political forces in Lebanon, in light of the considerable experie~nce gained during the past years.\" ~ This is precisely what Colonel Muhammad Ghanim, chief of Syrian intelligence = in Lebanon, told Lebanese Prime Minister Dr Salim A1-Huss when the latter was reviewing with him the existing relations beCween Syria and Lebanesa political forces shortly before al-Auss' recent visit to Damascu5. In the face of all this, observers are asking themselves about the nature of the change that Syria has decided to introduce into its policy in Lebanon. Most of them answer that it will give the government a completely free hand to impose its authority, after the Lebanese army has gained such a posture as to be fit for greater duties. _ however, the problem is not that s~:mple. It mi~ht be that the coming Arab summit conference, in agreement with Syria, will have a way to extract ~ Lebanese legitimacy from tne predicament from which the legal Syrian _ presence has been trying to extricate itself, before considering the problem of the south. This might be Syria's way to withdraw through the ~ame door that it used in 1976 to reach the Lebanese shifting s~nds.

It took place a few days bef~re his full release in the _ city of M'sila, which is 400 kilometers south of the Algerian capital. Although Mr Ben Bella declines to receive ~ournalists or non-Algerian citizens, AS.-WATAN AL-'ARABI succeeded in conveying a group of questions to him to which he responded very~ clearly. He focused on his experiences in prison and on the ideas he had on the present and the future. - There is a story worth telling behind the succes~ of AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI in conveyi,ng these questions to Mr Ben Bella. The Picture From Abroad When the eve of the first day of next November comes around, Ahmed Ben Bella, the first pre3ident of the People's Republic of Algeria, will re- - gain his full freeuom, pursuing his life and his rights like any Algerian citizen. He can travel and move freely throughout Algeria without restric- tions. He can travel abroad and can return to the homeland whenever he wishes. He can express his views and his positions publicly and ~~ithout - censorship. I learned from a well-informed source that the Political ~3ureau of the - Liberation Front Party, which is chaired by Chadli Bend~edid, the secre- - t3ry general of the party and president of the republic--the Polit~cal isureau is known today in the jargon of Algerian politics as the political - '~adership--did take a unanimous decision to release Brother Ahmed Ben R~lla. This decision was made during the bureau's regular weekly meeting �tr.at was held Saturday, the 22nd of last September. ~?:e.

Ben Bella had been under house arrest since he was overthrown by the 1965 coup on 19 June. Thgt coup was led by the late President Houari Boumediene who was at that time ~ vice president and minister of defense. Thia decision became effective on the 4th of July. That day coincided with the 17th annivereary of the independence of Algeria which was the outcome of the revolution of the million and a half martyrs that broke out in Novem- ber of 1954. Algeria [has harnessed] all its energies ~nd is prpparing it- _ _ self to celebrate its 25th anniversary next month. Former President Ahmed Ben Bella chose the home of his wife's family in the city of M'sila which i~ ~ocated 400 miles south of the Algerian capita.l. He will reside there temporarily until the decision of a full pardon is announced. Informed sources think it likely that there was agreement be- - tween the political leadership and Brother Ben Bella on this decision and on its timing. _ Ever since Ben Bella moved from [the condition] of being und~r house arrest to a life of limited freedom in the city and suburbs of M'sila, he has been receiving hundreds of Algerian citizens openly and without any restrictions _ except thase that are necessary for security. He walks around town; he prays in the mosques of M'sila on F,:idays; and he lunches or dines in pub- lic restaurants with his wife, the 3ournalist Mrs Zahrah Salimi, and a number of his close friends. Brother Ben Bella continued to decline receiving non-Algerians, even if they were his Arab friends. He did so out of respect for the agreement that was made between him and the Algerian authorities. He was postponing such meetings to the day when a decision about his full release would be issued. ' r The former president's family consists ~f his wi�e Zahrah Salimi who was ~ a journalist for the leftist weekly magazine that was published in French after tndependence and was called REVOLUTION AFRICAINE. Ben Bella married her 5 years after he was placed under house arrest where he stayed for al- most 14 years. ~ In addition to his wife Ben Bella's small family includes today two A1- gerian daughters whom the couple adopted 1 year after their marriage. Zahrah chose them from an orphanage for the children of those who were killed in the revolution in Oran. The elder is 10 years old; and the younger is almost 8. The only request that Ahmed Ben Bella had made of his wife [in this re- gard] and had insisted upon was that one of the girls be white and the other black. \"Why, Mr Ahmed?\" asked one of the Algerian citizens who was visiting him in his home in M'sila. 11 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 FUR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Ben Bella replied in an eloquent Arabic that surprised his audlence who knew how littie Arabic he could speak before his arrest in 1965. \"This is a symbol of Ar3b-African brotherhood. ?.t is the brotherhood in ~ whose interaction and strength I aee the cornerstone of the new historic confrontation with colonialism, Zioniam, backwardness and fY~agmentation [that will occur] at the end of the 20th ce~tury.\" - Boumediene Decided...But One of Ben Bella's close f.riends says that those who had raiaed the ques- tion of Ben Bella and had suggested to the Palitical Bureau that he be released were President Chadli Bend~edid; Mohamed Salah Yahiaoui, the party's business attache; and Col Belhouchet, former member of the Revolu- tionary Council. Today, in addition to being a member of the Political ' Bureau, Col Belhouchet is the inspector general of the army. He was also the one who was initially responsible for Ben Bella's arrest and custody. [He was charged with this responsibility] in the context of the military and security responsibilities he had ait that time for the first district. _ It is known with certainty in informed Algerian circles that the late - President Houari Boumediene had decided more than once on Ben Bella's re- _ lease, but that there were always unexpected circumstances that prevented him from actually m~king the decision. _ E�~ery time the council met it was Col Abdallah Belhouchet, member of the Revolutionary Council, who would bring up the sub~ect of Ben Be11a. He would get support from the late president and from a large majority of the council members. These circles affirm that the last time the decision was about to be an- nounced was in 1977, but the so-called \"the smuggled weapons airplane to Algeria\" operation was discovered, and announcement of the decision was postponed one more time. One of the senior statesmen who was close to the late President Houari Boumediene on his death bed in Mustafa Pasha Hospital says that in his few moments of consciousness, Boumediene's eyes fell on Col B~lhouchet, an3 he murmured, \"Ben Bella.\" He was, however, heard clearly by everyone around him. The Alger3an statesman goes on in his conversation with his friends, \"The late Boumediene was not impatient with those who took up with him the question of Ben Bella, as some thought he was. Boumediene did not hide his differences with Ben Bella, but he always said that the difference w~s objective and that it should stay objective and not become personal. Among those who continued to raise the question of Ben Bella most often were Tito, 'Ard-al-Nasir, Castro, Nyerere, Sekou Toure and some Arab friends, politicians and writers, with whom Boumediene had been meeting almost regularly. 12 FOR OFFICIAL US~ ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY I \"Boumediene used to take advantage of these opportunities to bring up the matter [for discussion] at every Revclutionary Council by saying, \"Presi- den~ so and so or brother so and so spoke to me about ~:~.e question of Ben ~ Bella.\" The Risk Very well! ' I was able to obtain this information about the case of Brother Ahmed Ben Bell_a after entpring AlgE:ria recently in ~nusual circumstances that gave me opportunities to c~ntact numerou~ Algerian figures who are impo-rtant in , the country's contemporarp life. One feels the strong pulse of this coun- try's life in different positions. It throbs for the purpose of continuing - the course of putting the Nati.onal Charter into practice, overstepping with awareness an3 with control the pains and the tremors that resulted from the absence of Boumediene, the strong man of the people and of the army. The information is useful in drawing a sketch from the outside of Ben Bella, but is this information enough? Does it satisfy the sense of a~ournalist - who is looking for the truth? No! One cannot apgroach the truth without supplementing Ben Bella's outside picture with his picture from the inside. One cannot put his hands on Ben Bella's picture without a direct interview with him. And here lies the insurmountable obstacle whose attainment was imposaible. - Many of [r~ur] fellow correspondents--Arabs and foreigners--have tried several ways to get an intervieza with ~tt:~ Bella, and they are still try- ing. I can provide from my information the names of more than 60 persons who attempted it, but [these correspondents] have not yet succeeded; they have not given up, however. Today, there are still 14 colleagues in A1- geria who are planning or awaiting the appropriate moment. idhy do I not ~oin in these attempts since circumstances have made it pos- sible for me this time to be in the heart of Algeria? I proceeded to knock carefully, cautiously and indirectly on doors, but I they all remained closed. Everyone, including the person who accompanied me on the visit [to Algeria] advised me to stop trying, or at least to postpone my attempt until a suitable time in the future when Ben Bella would regain his full freedom. The obstacles [that I encountered] were not only those that were made by officials, but they were also those made by Ben Bella who firmly declined receiving journalists. In fact he denied receiving non-Algerians, even if they were his friends. - The journalistic challenge provoked me, and my sense of provocation welled within me. To be in Algiers, only 400 kilometers from Ben Bella who was - free and to be in these suitable circumstances and not to see him or talk to him [was unthinkable]. 13 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY I APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLX 4 I dectded to show my a~ceptance of the fact, to cease my attempts and to ~ pursue in secret, the different trouble-shooting methods of the profession in order to reach ~en Bella. I no longer had any course but that of taking - a risk, regardless of its cost. Briefly, the risk was a success. I do not �aant to reveal its aecreta today because most certain_ly this is not the time to do so, even though the story deserves to be told in its details. I am express~ng my sincere apologies here to everyone for taking this riek. But my excuse is that I belong to the family of the press whose ob~ective is to search for the truth even if that truth inconvenienced or embarrassed others. At any rate, all that I can do today is reveal one secret that was essen- tial t~ La:e 3ournalistic risk [that I took]: I succeeded in making a group of Algerian brothers convey the questions of AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI to Ben Bella. They traveled quickly to M'sila where they met with Brother Ben Bella and asked him questions in an .Algerian wording. Ben Bella replied spontaneously and candidly. As soon a~ I received the answers, I left Algeria i~nediately on the first airplane. The Picture From the Inside: the Interview [Question] By God, Mr Ahmed, how? [Answer] Prison was not altogether a loss and an affliction. It can also be a blessing and a profitable experience for a human being if he so wishes. _ This blessing and this profitable experience may not be available to a human being if he continues to go around the whirlpool of life talindfolded either by rigid convictions; erroneous ideas; or emotions that are excessively preoccupied with the self, with power, with renown or with money. In prison the blindfold is removed from one's eyes--from the mind's eye and from the eye of the intellect. A person faces himself fully naked; his critical faculty is awakened so he can criticize himself and the experience of others to the utmost. In addition, a person acquires an extraordinary capability for love, f~r forgiveness and for understanding human weaknesses in people. - The fact is that I e~erienced in prison--I mean under house arrest--two stages. There was an extremely cruel and bitter stage of resentment that lasted for the first 3 years. And there was the stage of blessing and the profitable experiences that I obtained by challenging the cruel circum- stances, by challenging myself and by reeducating myself and acquiring the capability of facing my errors and evaluating everything ob~ectively. I armed myself with scientific knowledge and with the ability to show love _ and tolerance in analyzing everything: the revolutiori; the experience of government; the present and the future of Algeria; the Arab character and Islam; the question of Palestine; the problems of the Third World; the struggles on the international scene; the human product of the age of 7,4 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 yI FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY , technology, of oil and of going to the moon; and the pitfalls of material ~nd moral poverty that are becoming wider and deeper everywhere for man. _ The First Years Were Harsh in Ezzaf [QuestionJ May God bless ynur parents, M~ Ahmed, and grant them sslvation. How was that period of the first 3 years? - [Answer] The period of the firs~ 3 years was physically and emotionally the harshest period of my being under house arrest. Physically speaking, my activities were restricted to the utmost extent Supervision was tight and severe in Ezzaf. During that period I was not allowed to contact my relatives outside, to examine newspapers or books, to hear the radio or to watch television. Ali that I had was the Holy _ Koran, and it was in fact an excellent companion. It reassured me and it soothed and f_ortified my heart, my nerves and my mind. - Psychologically, you can imag3.ne, of course, the state :C was in of being torn, bewildered and anxious because of the dreadful shock that I had to _ face suddenly and unexpectedly. My psychological condition became even more critical when, orders were issued to all the guards not to exchange any conversation with me on any matter regardless of the circumstances. [They were told] not to answer any question I put to them. Thus I was not only imprisoned by walls, but also by the dreadful silence. I tried to break through the walls of silence, but I failed completely. The guards were carrying out their orders to the letter. I sensed that there must be a plan behind all this to drive me to insanity. i ~ I decided to resist this plan with all my power, and my oniy weapon was the greatest weapon; I mean the Holy Koran. I buried myself in its chapters. My Arabic language was at that time weak and it did not help me. But I persevered without weariness, and little by little, God Almighty opened the closed doors for me, and I entered into the boundlessness of purity and divine wisdom. The universe was opened to , me and I absorbed knowledge insatiably. Suddenly the prison of silence collapsed around me in spite of the fact that the guards continued to ob- serve their orders of not talking to me. The Holy Koran gave me extraordi- nary inner strength that I had never felt before; it gave me mental power, emotional power and even physical power. The more intensively I read in the Holy Book and repeated what I read, the more new things I discovered. I discovered numerous secrets of the universe and of life. And then my view of myself, of life and of people became more magnanimous and more pure; ~ it became free from all malice or desire for petty or major revenge. I am well aware of the errors I made, and i forgive from my heart the offenses ~ ' 15 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 I FOR OF~ICIAL USE ONLY that others committed against me. I reconsider with deeper rational and moral capabilities everything that transpired in my life, all my sins and the sins of others ao I can achieve a genuine and a~sincere degree of what - I believe is self-criticism and criticism of the experiment and of others with af~ection and tolerance. God was benevolent with me, and r.e enabled me Co study all parts of the Koran. Suddenly I became fluent in Arabic to the degree that I now smi~e or laugh at myself ~hen I remember how awkward m,y Arabic language used to be; how difficult it was for me to speale in Arabic; and how many mistakes I made when I expressed myself in Arabic. From the gate of the Holy Koran I went to study the tradition of the Pro- phet, may God bless him and grant him salvation. Then I went to the books of ~u-:;:~prudence with their different orientations. Then I went to the most a~.~.hr,ritative Islamic references in philosophy and sociology such as those oi Ibn Rushd, Ibn Khaldun, al-Hamadani and others. I did this after the first 3 years went by and I was allowed to ask for any books I wanted. Then the 3 years passed peaceably in spite of Cheir cruelty. I came out ~ of these 3 years having won my religion, myself, my tolerance and my love for my fellow man even if he declared his hostility to me. The fact that one discovers the human side of one's enemy is in reality [like] finding a friend under the enemy's skin. It makes one rise above the petty matters of the world and of one's own selfish ills; it purifies one from the short- comings of malice, of revenge or of vengeance. - The Guards Turned Into Companions After God pulled me through the crisis of the first 3 years, the atmosphere _ changed and became clear. The guards turned into companions and friends who devoted themselves to my service and my comfort and talked with me dur- ing the day and night. The walls of silence and isolation were shattered, and I began seeing relatives and close friends and reading any Algerian and non-Algerian newspaper I wanted. I listened to the radio; I watched television; and I kept up with everything that was happening in the home- land and in the world. I commi.tted myself to a daily regimen ro educate myself in philosophy, politics and economics. I Bear the Late Boumediene No Malice [Question] By God, Mr Ahmed, how do you now view your experience with the late Boumediene? [Answer] May God have mercy on him. My God have mercy on our brother Boumediene. We struggled together for Algeria with all the fighters and the masses of the people. We were in agreement for some time, and then we disagreed. And what has been has been. - The truth is that both of us, he and I, were victims of very complicated and very mysterious circumstances in whose midst we found ourselves after 16 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 FGR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ' 1 the revolution achieved victory and the coun~ry achieved independence. [There was the task of] building the state; [there was] a vacuum; a lack of cadres; and there were conspiracies planned against us so that we would be forced to go to French colonialism or to any other colonialism to ask for assistance. With our lack of experience, and at the same time, our insistence upon total reliance upon ourselves, we had to embark upon ~he dangers of poli- tics an3 to chart a course that iione of us had previously experienced. I embarked upon the dangers of polit~c.s, and I ultimately became the victim of politics. As a fighter, may God have mercy on him, Boumediene embarked _ upon his course of political dangers, and he too became a. victim of another kind. But each one of us did what he believed at tli~t time was his duty. In all hones~ty and truthfulness, I bear the late Boumediene no malice. Quite the contrary, I understand him well after uncovering the human side within him, and T made peace with him. , I no longer see politics as col~l and absclute tactics even when it contra- dicts values. Successful and effective politics is the politics of civi- - lized men with vision; the character of modern man makes him refrain pri- marily from revenge. Against Settling Accounts I am returning tc: freedom having been completely pusified from any desire to settle any ac.counts with any one of them regardless of who he is or of the position he had taken regarding my experience. I am returning to freedom with a desire to devote every sincere effort as a citizen to our dear Algeria and to its progress forward. About this let me say that it is necessary th~~ we be armed with revolutionary humility. We must review what happened with a comprehensive, realistic and tolerant view. We must ; - have the courage to criticize ourselves and our experience publicly. I ' = humbly will be the first to present my errors and to criticize them. [Question] May God have mercy on your parents, Mr Ahmedl What are these errors? [Answer] There have been numerous errora. The truth is that prison en- abled me to carry out a process of comprehensive and important revisions - - of my experience and my responsibilities in government through the experi- ence of the revolution and that of the government of ind~pendence and its struggles. From these revisions I deduced that we, and I was at the forefront, concen- trated on pursuing a policy that was purely theoretical in nature and di- - vorced [from reality]. Sometimes it was completely isolated from reality - and from its given situations. We used to solve the problems as we under- stood them and not as they were in society. We were more concerned with philosophies and slogans than we were with life as it was experienced. _ 17 ' FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Hence, our policy was in fact more theoretical than practical. When theory clashed with action, we absolved the theory and tried to impose it force- fully fln reality. This practice may still be found extensively in many of the experiences of the Third World. _ During the prison years, i learned that politic~ i5 action; it is behavior; it ic changing reality. Accordingly, it must begin with reality, from its - living substance and not from theoretical thoughts and ideas. Politics must be turned into a practical policy that does not yield blindly to - theory regardless of the capabilities of that theory. Politics must have substance that may b~ translated into specific actiuns with specific time- tables to achieve specific goals. It must not be a superficial policy whose chief concern is to consider those who disagree with it or those who have different opinions or positions to be dissenting and retrogressing from the revolution. The truth is that the difference between an abstract theoretical policy and a practical policy which is based on intellectual and social alterna- tives is the difference betwe~n adolescence and maturity. In various de- grees, we all fell into adolescence. And There Is the Problem of Democracy There is also the question of democracy. We, and I was at the forefront, did not give democracy the measure that was necessary for its growth and fruition. Democracy continued to be a question urgently waiting for an answer while we ignored it or offered marginal answers. The truth is that the regime or the government in our country--as govern- ments are in progressive Arab countries and in the countries of the Third World--continued to revolve around the progressive, national individual leader who had [the people's] trust; it did not revolve around constitu- tional institutions and popular organizations. The center of government continued to revolve around the individual leader when I was responsible for the government and during the administration of Boumediene, may God have mercy on him. In fact, the role of the individual leader was gaining strength at the expense of the role of the people and their institutions. This is a serious flaw in democracy which the people, the party and the state cannot do without. [It should be corrected] so _ ~ that the institutions can become effective and immune to the diseases vf bureaucracy, neglect, corruption and the conspiracies of enemies. There is also the question of recalling ou~ ~~utional history in a manner that would enable us to look at it a3 continuous periods without divisions that we ourselves would make in accordance with our personal preferences. We should judge every period not according to our notions of today and our current circumstances, but rather according tc the notions and the circum- stances of that age. Many of those we have swept aside in revolutionary enthusiasm and impetuosity or because of our personal preference were pure 18 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY and innocent nationalists and fighters. Whether they are movements, or- ganizations or individuals, we must reatore to them t~eir fu11 regard. Yes, we must criticize ourselves and re-evaluate our history with ob3ec- _ tivity and honesty. Generations have a right to the continuity of history which must not be tainted and manipulated. There Is Also the Question of the Party There are many other questions...[such asJ the question of the party. The political organization of the revolution was the liberation front. This was necessary and in consonance with the nature, the spirit and ~the goals of the revolution. The front includes and should have included every Algerian who re~ected French colonialism and dedicated his life, ~ his wealth and his childr~n to take part in fighting it. After indepen- dence we replaced the sign of the front with that of the party, but the party grew weak and continued to grow weaker until it became a mere sign without vitality. Accordingly, we lost the role [it could have had] in influencing [affairs] and leading [the nation]. Why [did that happen]? - . We did not study this problem with the necessary eamestne~s. Some move- , ments are calling for pluralism. Is pluralism possible or necessary for democracy? Where would its scope be? Would it be inside the party or outside the party? Must we continue in the form of a party, or must we change our organization so that it would comprise the organizational form and the formulae of a front? For 14 years I asked myself these questions, ~nd today I ask myself these questions again. I do not claim to have ready, absolute answers. But I do have a few preliminary ideas for discussion. In general, this + is a question that only the people themselves will settle. , _ The Socialist Exper:.ment Is Essential...But i ~ [Question] By God, Mr Ahmed, wh~t about...? [Answer] The socialist experiment was and still is the essential and the - inevitable solution for Algeria. But the errar that we fell into with re- ; gard to socialism is that we continued to tie it to rigid notions that we revered and worshiped as though they were idols. We did not tie socialism ~ . to life. We were imitators more than innovatora and creators. We saw so- cialism in the circumstances of o~hers. But we did not see it carefully _ and deal with it creatively in our own special circumstances which are quite different from the circumstances, the herftage and the spiritual values of others. i i I do not believe that socialism can succeed in our country if it does not ~ take into consideration the specific features of our reality.

Peo- ~ ple are equal like the teeth of a comb. At any rate, prison gave me the opportunity to make significant revisions. I did in fact write 1,400 pages zhat I hope to publish in a book in two ' v~Zumes. Before I publish the book, I will show it to a number vf friends so that I may get their observations, their criticism and their correct~ons of the specific details of the facts or events where my memory may have failed me. It is a oook about my experience as one of tne fighters in the revolution, in government and in prison. I deal in that book with every- thing in the past and in the present, and I try to look over the horizons of the future and to raise the questions that I have for discussion. I do that to the best of my effort. It is God who grants success. 'Abd-al-Nasir, al-Sadat and Camp David [QuestionJ My God have mercy on your parents, Mr Ahmed. What else can you tell us about these memoirs? [Answer] Of course. My writings dealt with Arab and international events and figures. Among those figures, for example, is Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir, may God have mercy on him. He was a great, progressive, nationalistic leader. He achieved much for Egypt and for the entire Arab homeland. No one denies _ that but a blind or an ungrateful person. But the great man did also have shortcomings. Like all human beings, one of his shortcomings was the fact - that he made the sociaZ and political natio~;ial movement revolve around an individual leader. This is what broke the continuity of Egy~t's Arab course and of its social- ist development. In the absence of the. centralizing [influence of] an or- ganized popular movement, of constitutional institutions and of popular or- ganizations, this absence of conttnuity in Egypt's Arab course allowed the occurrence of this ma3or dangerous twist whose effect goes beyond Egypt to the entire Arab homeland. I was referring to the Camp David Accords and to the separate peace with Israel under the leadership of al-Sadat with his centralized, individual leadership also. A1-Sadat's leadership represents another political and social nature that is different from that of the late 'Abd-al-\"LVasir. Camp David was a catastrophe. If all of us, Arabs and Moslems, do not overcome it quickly, it will drag us into a bottomless pit that will take us back scores of years. After dealing with the Algerian question, my writings deal with the Arab question. . In my opinion the essence of the Arab question is the Palestinian question. Failing to achieve victory in the Palestinian question or stabbing it in the back will lead all Arabs into mazes of wretchedness and fragmentation, regardless of their countries and their inclinations, and they will fall again into the cfiasm of colonialism wfiicfi, tfirougFi its strong and new 20 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 ~ FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY institutions, covets their oil, their marketa and their strategic loca- tions. Color~ialiam wante to eatablish Zionist hegemony. What is being done so far to support the liberAtion org$nization, the only legitimate representative of the Paleatinian `people, is very little and is not ade- quate on the part of the Arabs in spite of the fact that their destinies are fully tied with the destiny of Palestine. I am even noticing that some well-intentioned Arabs as well as others with evil intentions are going al~ng with colonialism in its plans to abort the Palestinian Revolu- tion. Sometimes, the methods of these plans are obvious; at other times they are clandestine. It were as though the Arabs had been charged with the task of preventing the revolution from achieving victory that would bring about freedom and progress for Arabs through the victory of the Palestinian Revolution against Israel. What I wrote also deals with the fact that our destiny in Algeria and ou.r destin~; as Arabs are tied to the destiny of the Third World. I dealt with the necessity of unifying the Third World's movement in all areas against the new racist, imperialist attack. I give special significance in this unification to the establishment of an Arab-African brotherhood with strong ties. The Core of the Arab Character Is Islam I pay special attention to the Islamic dimension of our movement whose core is Islam not only because Islam is the religion of the vast ma~ority of the faithful nations [of the Arab worldJ, but rather because it is the spring- head of thought and culture which nourishes the Arab character and makes it non-racist and religiously tolerant. Without this dimension we lose our national personality and our spiritual values that move us to struggle for freedom and for progress, and to mobilize our people in a profound - manner to oppose different forms of colonialism, exploitation, tyranny, racism and fanaticism. Lebanon? Cain and Abel! , [Question] By God, Mr Ahmed, what...? \" [Answer] What is happening in Lebanon is heartbreaking. It is a crime for which a11 the Lebanese and all the Arabs are responsible. It brings ~ _ back to our age the story of Cain and Abel. The crisis of Lebanon is the crisis of the Arabs' inability to oppose colonialism Zionism and backward- ness, not to mention the horrid bloody fanaticism which is forbidden by both ~slam and Christianity. Unless the Arabs cooperate with good persons who are among the people of Lebanon and in the legal government of Lebanon = to temporize the civil strife, its fires will extend to all of them. i Final Touches i Thus ends the dialogue with Brot'her Ahmed Ben Bella.

The weather was - fine for the firat time in many days and a former company director was planning to go golfing when he was unexpectedly detained by a telephone call from an acquaintance assigned to Tehran, capital of Iran. - The gist of the phone cail from Tehran, which took 45 minutes, was as follows: \"Sorry to bother you. Appealing to you will not help us but I do not know to whom I can appeal so please listen to what we Japanese in Iran have to say. I have heard that in Japan it was decided to use national tax money _ ~c resume construction (Note: cabinet decision on the 12th), which Mitsui ~ ; & Co., Ltd. [Mitsui] failed to accomplish, of the Iranian petro-chemical ' plant (Note: the Irano-Japan Petroleum Corporation [IJPC], a 3oint com- , pany with Iran). Ezaki, Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] Minister, is visiting Tehran. But do you think such a venture will succeed? As a natter of fact, a terrible thing is happening now in Tehran. A large neimbe,r of Iranian laborers have besieged the Tehran oftice of Fudo Construc- tion Co., Ltd. [Fudo] which is doing subcontract�work for Mitsui on IJPC, and are perse~uting four Japanese, incl~uding the resident manager. They are demanding i~ediate payment of layoff compensations totaling 8 million - rials (spproximately 24 million yen). If Fudo makes such compensations, they will make the same demands of other Japanese companies one after ' another. If Fudo give~c way, there is no telling what they will demand : nex4:, even if the IJPC ~plant construction is resumed. Since the February ' revolution, manpower costs have risen 30 percent. With such worries in - my mind, I hurried to the Fudo office. There, I was taken by aurprise. The company's four employees had already been held in captivity for nearly 15 hours, since yesterday morning, but Mitsui and the Japanese embassy had feigned ignorance...what time is it here? It is 0130 of the 14th.

That is the problem. They are having a big party to welcome Ezaki. Ambassador to Iran Wada is also present. Since all of the newspaper reporters are also invited to the party, no shred of news regarding the captivity will probably be reported in Japan. \"During the regime of former Shah Pahlavi, Mitsui arrogantly boasted that 'we are going to accomplish this task in place of the Japanese nation.' They bribed the Iranian Government and bragged to the Japanese contractors ...Japanese entrepreneurs prayed at the feet of Mitsui. Heretofore, Mitsui took most of the margin from these entrepreneurs. They keep their profits and are now asking for tax money. No.Japanese here will look favorably again at Mttsui. Even the Iranians are aware of Mitsui's actions during - Pahlavi's regime. It's anyone's guess as to when IJPC will be nationalized.\" Well, the story is that this \"righteous indignation\" had co.tinued for some time. � After 32 Hours of Captivity ~ - The four Japanese employees of Fudo were held captive from 0800 on the 13th to 1600 on the 14th (Iran time) or a total of 32 hours. Ironically, this - is about the same period that Minister Ezaki and party were in Tehran. On the evening of the 13th, through the auspices of Mitsui, a gala Japanese party called \"Welcome to Minister Ezaki\" was held at the Hilton hotel in Tehran. In addition to Minister Ezaki, MITI Trade Policy Bureau Chief Miyamoto, Deputy Director General Furuta of the Agency of National Resources and Energy, and Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau Chief Chiba of the Foreign Miniatry, who accompanied Ezaki, were present at the party. Am- _ bassador Wada and embasSy staff inembers were also present. Approximately ~ 60 Japanese residipg ~.n Iran were also there and a large number of them were Mitsui representatives in Tehran. According to a Japanese in Iran who at- ~ tended the party, the Islam religion absolutely forbids alcohol and there- fore, to call the partq a\"gala\" might be~an exaggeration. They toasted with ~uice and cola and the \"food was so-so.\" But even so, this type of a party was a\"lavish one\" and \"the first in Tehran since the r.evolution.\" Tehran resident manager Wataru Shibata of Fudo, who had been held in cap- tivity for 32 hours, was one of those who had been invited to the party. \"It was the morning of the 13th: Forty-five Iranian laborers suddenly - - appeared in our office. I was about to leave in a car but they pounded on the hood and ordered, 'You Japanese return to the office.' They were laborers who had come from Bandar Khomeyni, where the IJPC combinant is ~ located, and were wearing turbans and sandals. They were southerners and many of them were of black Arabian color. _ 27 ' FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY a APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02108: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY \"They did not use violence but they surrounded us and shoved their de- mands in our faces.

According to Fudo books,� the employment contract with them had expired in December of last year and they had been \"given termina- tion pay.\" - In spite of that, they had been held captive for 32 hours. During that period, a' member who had been permitted to go outside to purchase food- stuffs, made an SOS call to the Japanese embassy and Mitsui. However.... . \"The embassy personnel said, 'a minister is here from Japan and we are too busy,' or 'for the present, your lives are not in danger, is that right?' and refused to help. They did not even contact~the police. As for Mitsui, they sponsored the party and 'congratulated themselves that the enterprise had become a national one.' They did not try to contact us. It was dis- heartening.\" (Statement of Fudo manager Shibata.) - The Hidden Aim of Mitsui? The Iranian laborers, who reappeared in Tehran a week later, carried a \"compulsory enforcement directive\" from the Abadan District Court Office. The directive ordered that \"unless payment were made by the deadline, ar- rests will follow.\" The frightened Fudo procured the money in a hurry and proceeded to the dis- trict court office. \"This is like receiving the termination pay twice. From the Japanese standpoint, there is absolutely no need to pay this money. We also feel highly indignant about paying this money. The social conditions of Iran, _ however, are not that stable. The laborers want to take as much as they can get. It so happened that our office was open when many enterprises had closed their doors. We became their target.

Visiting re- searcher at the Iranian Philosophical Academy, Hajime Igarashi (presently _ back in Japan because of the revolution), says: \"Because Iran does not have labor-related laws, there are no regulations covering strikes and layoff:s. In September of last yesr, there was an anti-Pahlavi strike at IJPC. In the midst of the strike, Iranian laborers came to the company and asked for their pay. The companies were forced to come up with a plan to pag wages to those who did not work and bonuses to those who did. It is common in Iran to ask for pay whether they are laid ' off or not reporting to work. One of the teachings in the Koran is 'those who possess should bestow blessings' and the Iranians are utilizing this 'to take without hesitation from those who possess.' There are some revc- lutionary commtttee members, however, who do not recognize such demands so there are no standards in Iran after the revoluti~n. There is only confusion.\" Among the Japanese residing in Iran, some say \"even if IJPC resuaes as a national enterprise of Japan, there is no telling what the Iranians will demand. The outlook is not only bad but extremely dark.\" Others claim, neither the Japanese embassy nor Mitsui informed the Japanese Government about the serious situation and made it appear that Iran was safe.\" Re- portedly, such charges are rampant now. According to the Japanese cabinet decision, another 180 billion yen will be granted to IJPC, in which Japan and Iran have already invested Sfl0.5 billion yen. Of the Japanese outlaq, government subsidy amounted to 20 billion yen and loans from the E~cport-Import Bank of Japan and othera totaled 80 billion yen.... \"I think that Mitsui reallq knows best that IJPC's future is hopeless from _ the standpoint of profitability or any other standpoint. Mitsui is saying _ that IJPC will definitely be in the black in the years ahead but I think that inwardly, Mitsui has other thoughts. They are saying that rather than continue any unfavorable relation with Iran, they should complete _ IJPC which is already 85 percent finished and have the Iranians take over ~ the corporation stocks at market value. If the Iranian side nationalizes and seizes the plant, Mitsui can get away by pleading a case of force ma~eure. Even if the combinant is completed and produces goods, there is - no sales outlet for the products. Ira~n's domestic consumption is limited. If the products are imported by Japan, domestic makers will face competi- tion. What can we do?\" (Statement of aforementioned Igarashi.) \"The labor situation was chaotic im~aediately after the revolution but it is settled now. There is absolutely no chance that the plant will be na- tionalized upon completion. Becauae of that, the Japanese Government par- ticipated.\" So says Mitsui.

It is said that a memorandum from Premier Bazargan has reached the Foreign Ministry but.... � \"What we feared most was being told by Iran that 'well, forget it, but in return, we shall not provide oil.' Because of that, we came around to the decision to complete the remaining 15 percent of construction. It is a form of bribery. There might be arguments as to the sum of 20 billion yen for bribery but should the enterprise succeed, Japt~n would be highly eval- uated, even in Iran, for being the only country to remain and finiah the project, after all the European countries and United States had evacuated. ` For a country without natural resources, Japan had no choice but to try.\" - Oil is mentioned as the problem. Speaking of oil, OPEC chairnian and Min- : ister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources of the United Arab Emirates, Otaiba, = was given an unprecedented welcome by the government and people when he : visited Japan recently. ~ The government arranged an Imperial audience, the first since Petroleum Minister Yamani of Saudi Arabia, for a cabinet level official visiting Japan. Furthermore, he was presented with the First Class Order of the Sacred Trea- sure, a decoration which even Yamani could not get. Newspapexs and TV sta- tions competed for interviews with Otaiba. Among them, Fuji TV acted as though it were a medium for the government by asking \"will you continue giv- _ ing us oil in the future?\" Otaiba was bewildered by a woman interviewer'3 remark that \"Japanese wives in Hokkaido are having a difficult time because of kerosene shortage.\" Ultimately, he severely criticized Japan's wastage in oil consumption. In an interview, he said, \"support Arab's anti-Israel movements\" but what he really meant by that statement was for \"Japan to cut off re.iations with Israel.\" If those who bickered for oil with Otaiba are willing, at his request, \"to sever relations with Israel,\" that is another story. It can be said that by shouting for oil alone, without considering today's world situation which is buried under the oil problem, Japan might fall into a terrible \"pitfall\" of world politics. It is hoped that Japan will not have to deeply regret the situation someday of seeing no increase in the vital oil supply after having been utilized at will by the oil pro- - ducing countries, whether in Iran's IJPC pro3ect with poor \"guarantees\" or in the \"all-out Japaneg~ welcome\" for Otaiba.

However, this preoccupation does not prevent the - Iraqi Government from watching closely certain disturbing phenomena on the Arab arena. What are these phenomena? And what worries Iraq? Perhaps before the end of ~his year, Iraq will be ready to begin a new stage of national activity, represented by the establishment of constitutional institutions, the foremost, of which is an Iraqi national assembly or a parliament. ! It is taken for granted that the election of the members of the national , assembly will be free and direct. The elections will be held in a manner apt to build up democracy on a solid basis quite different from those weak and shakey foundations on which the parliaments and the representative coun- cils were bu~.lt during the modern history of Iraq. Almost all those legis- lative bodies were a distortion of genuine democracy and the will of the people. This may be the first time, during the past 20 years, the Iraqis will have a chance to go to the polls to elect their popular xepresentatives. Hence, the Iraqi political leadership is determined, after a long interruption - for various circumstances, which cannot be expl~ined in this report, to see that the new experiment will be sound, correct, logical and rational, - rather than follow the model of the superficial elections held in most of the countries of the Third World where referendums and elections recur and the rulers and their representatives win with implausible ma~orities (99.99 percent). Perhaps President Sadat's referendums and elections are the best evidence of the corruption of such experiments and falsehood of the a~.le- - gations that they reflect the will of the people and express the hopes, ' and aspirations of the-people and their choice of their genuine representa- . tives. - 31 ~ FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007102/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY I I ~ The 17 July Revolution has been ruiing the country for a little over 10 , years. But those years have been eventful and fui�1 of experiences and cir- cumstances that prevented the fulfillment of this prerequisite of a democra- tic government. ; Stability flelps Democracy It is true that many of the prevailing circumstances and preoccupations are ~ still impeding the process of building up a constitutional government, but the Iraqi political leadership seems to be determined, today, not to drag ' its fee+t in building up constitutional institutions. It considers such work an integral part of national action and national struggle. ; ~ In this determination, the Iraqi political leadership is supported by the solid stability of the current regime and its self-confidence and long ex- perience. These conditions are adequate to bring this democratic experiment to a successful and honorable conclusion. One of the most important conditions which help in expediting the process ; _ of creating and electing the representative establishment is the existence of the political establishment represented in the Ba'th party. Perhaps the Ba'th party in Iraq is different from all the other political ' organizations in the Arab world or the Third World since it represents _ authority of the people. In other words, it is not a party created by the ruling regime to flourish and expand in a manner which would make it a parasitic and subservient tool of the regime. - Consequently, the presence of a strong and effective political party gives the democratic process a special meaning and builds its institutions on ; committed and firm foundations which are not affiliated with any one indi- ~ vidual or a particular government. ~ In fact, a committee was formed last week in which the concerned ministries ' ~ ! were represented.

The Council will include those suggestione serving the public's interest into the bills and then issue them in their final forms. However, the attention pa3.d by the Iraqi polit3.ca1 leadership to the creation of elected representative councils during this stage does not prevent it from pursuing carefully other national interests, especially the developments on the pan-Arab arena. Attempt to Distort the Independence and Sovereignty of Iraq Observers note that the Western media is concentrating on distorting the independence of the Iraqi political leadership. It is also attempting to discredit this leadership through the fabrication of various rumors and dis- torted information repeatedly reported by the greatest number of information channels and networks. As an example, there is the allegation that there aYe Cuban forces in Iraq! The Iraqi President Saddam Hussayin, himself, denied these allegations. In a speech he made in Najaf (150 kilometers to the south of Baghdad) he said \"The masters of the White House know the truth, that there is not a single foreign soldier in Iraq.\" He went on to say \"The Arabs are capable of defending their lands, honor, dignity and principles without seeking aid from any foreigner, far or near, even if he is a friend.\" Stressing the independence of Iraq and the pride the Iraqis derive from maintaining sovereignty over their land, he said: \"The Iraqis are masters of their land, There is no room in Iraq except for its sons and the sons of the Arab nation. The Iraqis will maintain their loyalty, not only in Iraq but also in all the other parts of the Arab world. Wherever they find 33 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200030014-1 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/48: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200034414-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY injustice they will fight against it with the sword of Imam Ali, peace be on him, our Master al-Hussayin, Khalid Ibin al-Walid and Salah al-Din al- Ayyubi and the swords of all the Arab strugglers and all the Mosle~ leaders - in the land of Arabism. We will carry out our mission and we shall win.\" Indications Worrying the Iraqis On another level, some political and partisan circles here are concerned about certain overt and covert initiatives and moves which are currently taking place on the Arab arena. What disappoints the Iraqis most is the allegation of certain Arab states that the Arabs \"receive offers from others and reciprocate with rejection.\" In other words, these states say that the Arabs have no solid plan or counter- proposals to offer against the current proposals for a solution to the Middle East problem. The Iraqis also are outraged by the whispers in certain capitals about \"the necessity of finding a formula other than the Baghdad Summit formula, acceptable to the American camp.\" The Iraqis are provoked, as well, by those high voices calling for recog- nition of the Palestine Liberation Organization in return for its recogni- _ tion of Israel! Or those voices that call for changing or amending the United Nations resolution 242 return for a Palestinian recognition of the Zionist state and consequently the acceptance of the proposed compromises. In cvuntering these calls, the Iraqi officials, in their analysis of what is happening on the Arab-international arena, see that there is an insistence, _ especially from certain mediators, on convincing the Palestinians that the - gun is no longer the way and that they should give precedence to a political solution, since the political course is now the only way to salvation at this stage. The observers believe that political action is necessary and required but _ onti~e basis that it should be part of a comprehensive Arab plan and an in- tegrated strategy, rather than being a unilateral political activity. For an example, they ask: What is the value of an international recognition of the PLO if its price will he acceptance of an Tsraeli entity which re- fuses the creation of an independent Palestinian entity, at least on Palestinian territory? With regard to Iraqi-Iranian relations, there is no a.ndication here that Baghdad is certain about the real intentions of the new Iranian regime to- wards the Arabs, particularly, the Arabs of the Gulf. Consequently, Baghdad has not taken seriously the reports about Arab mediations to dissipate the clouds of tension over the relations between Iran and the Gulf states. 34 .

Hence, the ideal solution, from the Iraqi point of view, lies in Tehran ab- staining from following this rough course against the Arabs and in presenting to the Arabs practical evidences of its good intentions and its genuine de- termination to establish neighborly relations with the Arabs, based on mu- tual interests and historical ties. Tehran should dispel the notion that there is a vacuum on the Arab side that can only be filled by the winds of _ the \"Iranian revolution\" and that the mission of Iran is to export the revo- lution to its neighbors. ~ The Iraqis say that when the leaders of the new regime in Iran relinquish these illusions, Arab-Iranian relations will easily overcome the present crisis, and will be based on normal friendship between the two nations with- out complexes and sensitivities.

They \"decapitated\" _ three men who, in varying degrees, had played a role during the lOth Congress: ' Messrs Abdallah Farhat, Hedi Baccouche and Mahmoud Triki. Only the departure - of the first, the minister of defense, was announced, which was a big surprise to many. For some time, however, the minister's growing influence had irritated PrQsident Bourguiba. There had been sufficient circumstances for his dis- content to take pr~cise shape. Wanting to determine his position before the lOth Congress met, Bourguiba reviewed the films of previous congresses _ on 3 August. According to one of his associates, he was upset over the - sick-man image which he had given of himself in Mon~stir in 1971 at the time of the Eighth�Canqress. This was further qrounds for complaint against = his adviser at the time, who was none other than Mr Abdallah Farhat, then director of his staff. Had it not been for the prime minister, who said that he had assigned the organization of the congress to the mi.nister of defense, the latter would probably riave lost some of his privileges beginning on that day. After opening the congress in Tunis on 5 September, Bourguiba followed its proceedings from the palaae of Carthage by means of a special televi.sion installation. On the very first day, he summoned certain congressional participants. According to one of them, the president did not like the \"level\" of the debates. In his opinion, belaboring the confrontations and denouncing complicities, at the time of the events of 26 January 1978, were clumsy moves. Irritation turned to anger when th~ participants, one after another, requested the election of the general secretary, Mr Hedi Nouira, ' by the congress. \"But that is a duality of power!,\" a surprised minister confided to one of his colleagues. 37 FOR OFFICI6i:.
