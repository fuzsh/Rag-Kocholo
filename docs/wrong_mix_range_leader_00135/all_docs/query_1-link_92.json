However, by the end of Wednesday the deal appeared to have stalled.\n\nMore than 113,000 of the 454,000 people diagnosed with the disease have recovered, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. About 20,500 people worldwide have died from COVID-19.\n\nHere are the latest updates:\n\nWednesday, March 25\n\n21:59 GMT – $2 trillion virus rescue bill hits late snags in Senate\n\nSenate leaders raced to unravel last-minute snags and win passage of an unparalleled $2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe measure is the largest economic relief bill in history, and both parties’ leaders were desperate for quick passage of a bill aimed at a virus that is costing lives and jobs by the hour.\n\n“A fight has arrived on our shores,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we’re going to win it.”\n\n21:57 GMT – Pentagon orders halt overseas movement for US military\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper issued a stop movement order to the US military halting travel and movement abroad for up to 60 days in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus through the ranks, the Pentagon chief told Reuters news agency.\n\nThe measure is by far the military’s most sweeping to date and will affect forces around the world.\n\nEsper said in an interview the order applied to all US troops, civilian personnel and families, but noted there would be some exceptions.\n\n“The purpose is to make sure that we’re not bringing the virus back home, infecting others, that we’re not spreading it around the military,” Esper said.\n\nEsper said one exception to the order would be the drawdown under way in Afghanistan, which will continue.\n\n21:54 GMT – Undocumented in US have few protections from virus fallout\n\nSome 10 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants are believed to live in the US.
