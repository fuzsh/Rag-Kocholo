        "text": "More protests against the deadly attack at Tunisia’s Bardo national museum are planned for Thursday, as the prime minister said one of the two gunmen was known to security services.\n\nThe country is in shock after two Tunisian gunmen killed 18 tourists and three Tunisians on Wednesday in the deadliest attack on civilians in the country for 13 years. The gunmen were shot dead by security forces.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon security forces arrested four people in connection with the attack, Reuters reported the president’s office as saying. The army will also be deployed to increase security in Tunisia’s major cities.\n\nIn an interview with France’s RTL radio on Thursday morning, the prime minister, Habib Essid, said Tunisia was working with other countries to learn more about the attackers, identified as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaoui. He said Laabidi had been flagged to intelligence, although not for “anything special”.\n\nThe night before, the newly elected president Beji Caid Essebsi gave an address to the nation in which he said: “I want the people of Tunisia to understand firstly and lastly that we are in a war with terror, and these savage minority groups will not frighten us.\n\n“The fight against them will continue until they are exterminated.”\n\nAuthorities have launched a manhunt for two or three suspected accomplices in the attack.\n\nHours after the police ended the siege, thousands of Tunisians flocked to the capital’s main thoroughfare, Avenue Habib Bourguiba, waving red Tunisian flags and singing songs from the 2011 Arab spring revolution.\n\nMohammed Nasri, a young activist, said: “After the last election we thought we made a big step forward to real democracy, but what happened today was like a KO to our future. An attack so close to our parliament makes us speechless.”\n\nTunisia’s main trade union confederation and other civil society groups called for a silent demonstration later on Thursday outside the Bardo museum. The groups called on Tunisians to gather at 3pm GMT “to demonstrate our national unity in the fight against terrorism”.\n\nTunisia’s health minister, Said Aidi, said the number of dead had risen on Thursday to 23 people, including 18 foreign tourists, with almost 50 people wounded. Five Tunisians were killed, including two attackers. Aidi said all the injuries came from bullet wounds, and that several victims were brought in without identity documents.\n\nAs well as three Tunisian nationals, the gunmen killed four Italians, three Japanese, two Colombians, two Spaniards, an Australian, a Briton, a Pole and a French national. The nationalities of the other murdered tourists were not confirmed, but reports said an unknown number of South African tourists may have been involved.\n\nSpain’s foreign minister said two Spaniards who survived the attack hid inside the museum building all night. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said Juan Carlos Sanchez and Cristina Rubio, who is four months pregnant, appeared after dawn on Thursday and were well.\n\nThe targeting of tourists by terrorists is a new phenomenon in Tunisia and a big blow to a country whose struggling post-revolution economy depends largely on its beach resorts and foreign visitors. Tunisia, which peacefully elected a new parliament in December, has prided itself as a model of political transition since the overthrow of the brutal authoritarian Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, in contrast to the post-revolutionary difficulties of its troubled neighbours.\n\nBut it has also been struggling to tackle the growing terrorist threat in the region and thousands of Tunisians have left to fight foreign jihad. The attack immediately raised questions about the Islamist terrorist threat to Tunisia amid mounting anxiety that jihadi violence is spilling over the border from neighbouring Libya, as well as Algeria.\n\nWednesday night’s protests took place close to the French embassy, which has been ringed by barbed wire and concrete barriers for many months, a sign of the apprehension the city feels about the threat of terrorist attack.\n\nThat threat has become real with the killings at the Bardo museum, in what is the first jihadi strike against civilians in Tunisia since its 2011 revolution; previously militants had restricted attacks to military and government targets.\n\n“Today’s murderous assault targeted not only tourists and Tunisians but also the tolerant and rights-respecting society that Tunisians have been struggling to build,” said Eric Goldstein of Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe dilemma for many Tunisians now is how the government should respond: many are proud of their break from dictatorship, but worry about how the government can crack down on terrorism while preserving hard-won freedoms.\n\n“Everybody is shocked,” said Houeida Anouar, of Huffington Post Maghreb. “The government now has a huge responsibility. I hated the state when you had no rights. I don’t want Tunisians to go there, it would be a horrible back-pedalling.”\n\nThe attack began just after midday as gunmen armed with Kalashnikovs opened fire in front of the Bardo museum, the country’s largest and an important tourist attraction, which houses one of the world’s biggest collections of Roman mosaics within a 19th-century palace adjacent to parliament. As the gunmen struck, tourists were getting out of coaches to visit the museum on a spring day that had seen scores of visitors, many from cruise ships docked in the port for the day.\n\nWafel Bouzi, a guide with a Spanish-speaking group, told journalists that on exiting the museum with his group, he saw in the car park “a young 25-year-old man, dressed normally, without a beard” who was holding a Kalashnikov. “I thought he was playing with it. Then he opened fire.”\n\nThe gunmen began shooting near the coaches then entered the museum where hundreds of panicked visitors had taken refuge. Josep Lluís Cusidó, mayor of the small Catalan town of Vallmoll, was at the museum as part of a wedding anniversary trip with his wife. “A few men walked in and started shooting. We’re alive thanks to a miracle,” he told the Spanish news agency Efe. “These men suddenly started shooting and people started falling to the ground dead and things started falling from the ceiling … Everything happened so fast.”\n\nTwo Britons were “caught up in” the shootings, the British Foreign Office said, but did not specify whether they were among the dead or injured.\n\nWednesday’s attack was the worst since 2002, when an al-Qaida militant killed 21 people, mostly German tourists, after detonating a truck bomb in front of a historic synagogue on the Tunisian island of Djerba in 2002.\n\nIt came days after the death of Ahmed Al-Rouissi, a Tunisian also known as Abu Zakariya Al-Tunisi, who led a contingent of Islamic State fighters in Libya. He was killed in clashes with Libyan troops near the town of Sirte, a stronghold of followers of Muammar Gaddafi, the late Libyan strongman.\n\nTunisian commentators speculated there might be a connection between his death and Wednesday’s deadly attack. Pro-Isis Twitter accounts hailed the attack as “ghazwat Tunis” or the “raid of Tunis” (ghazwa is the description given to the early Islamic battles) and have cheered on the attackers. A purported Isis video from last December threatened attacks on Tunisia."
