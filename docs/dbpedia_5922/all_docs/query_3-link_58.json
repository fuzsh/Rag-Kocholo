From 24 Oct 1604 James I also began to use the style of \"King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\" this was formalized from 1 May 1707; (e) 16 Dec 1653 - 7 May 1659: \"By the Grace of God, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland (and the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging), often shorted to \"By the Grace of Godand Republic, Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland\" (Dei Gratia Reip[ublicae] Angliae Scotiae et Hiberniae, &c Protector); (f) from 1 May 1707: \"By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, France and Ireland King/Queen, Defender of the Faith\"; (g) from 1 Jan 1801: \"By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King/Queen, Defender of the Faith\"; in 1 Jul 1876 the title \"Empress of India\" was added; (h) from 1901: \"By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India\"; (i) 13 May 1927 - 11 Dec 1936: \"By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India.\"\n\n²The Dáil, in accepting the abdication of Edward VIII on 12 Dec 1936, did not proclaim the succession of George VI, but merely provided for the use of the U.K. crown for purposes of foreign representation, while leaving a hiatus in the transition to the new constitutional arrangements. There was no explicit provision for an interim head of state until the new constitution was to take effect on 29 Dec 1937. The domestic functions of the sovereign were exercised in part by the chairman of Dáil Éireann (Frank Fahy) and in part by the president of the Executive Council (Éamon de Valera). Having ceased to be the head of state of Ireland, the British King (George VI) continued to exercise the executive power in connection with external relations for appointment of diplomatic representatives and conclusion of international agreements. As provided by the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, the king acted strictly on the advice of the Executive Council (1936-1937) and subsequently on the advice of the Government of Ireland (1937-1949). On 21 Dec 1948 Dáil Éireann passed the Republic of Ireland Act, 1948 (effective 18 Apr 1949), which effectively abolished any connection of Ireland with the British monarchy.\n\n³The English-language constitution of Dáil Éireann of 25 Aug 1921 uses the wording \"President who shall also be Prime Minister.\" At the election on 26 Aug 1921 it is asserted in Dáil (in English) that the proper style is \"President of the Irish Republic.\" At the election on 10 Jan 1922 this is deprecated, and it is asserted, without formal contradiction, that the style is Uachtarán ar an nDáil Éireann (\"President of Dáil Éireann\"); the matter is left unresolved, the incumbents thereafter using the latter style.\n\n4Ua Buachalla (s.a.) indicated a preference for not being called governor-general, instead insisting to be styled Seneschal (a back-translation from his official Irish language style Seneascal).\n\nTerritorial Dispute: Ireland, Iceland, and the U.K. dispute Denmark's claim that the Faroe Islands' continental shelf extends beyond 200 nm.\n\nParty abbreviations: FF = Fianna Fáil/The Republican Party (Soldiers of Destiny, populist, center-right, republican, est.1926); FG = Fine Gael (Family of the Irish, christian democratic, center-right, est.1933); LP = Páirtí an Lucht Oibre/Labour Party (Labour Party, social-democratic, center-left, est.1912); SF = Sinn Féin (We Ourselves, democratic socialist, Irish republican, left-wing nationalist, center-left, est.1905/1970);\n\n- Former parties: IRB = Irish Republican Brotherhood (Irish nationalist, Irish republican, pro-independence, militant, 1858-1924); CG = Cumann na nGaedheal (Society of the Gaels, Irish nationalist, conservative, predecessor to FG, 1923-33); Con = Conservative Party (conservative, British); Lib = Liberal Party (liberal, British); - Before the development of the British Conservative and Liberal parties in the mid-19th century, parties were largely simply alliances of prominent groups or aristocratic families. The designations Whig and Tory tend often to be approximate: Tor = Tory Party (British conservative, remnants became the Conservative party by the 1840s); Whg = Whig Party (British moderate conservative, aristocratic, pro-reform, later elements became the Liberal party by the 1850's).\n\nGaelic kingdoms\n\nConnacht (Connaught)\n\n1st cent.
