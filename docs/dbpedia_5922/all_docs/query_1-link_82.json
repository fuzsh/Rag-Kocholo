Loose drawings and a sermon (folio 94) have been pasted in.\n\nScope and Contents\n\nThe caricatures are especially of Mrs Edwin Edwards (with a note on her and her husband), Julia Sandeman, and Robert Russell and John Robertson of Durban.

Although most of the sketches are of St Abb's Head, the Bass Rock, Tantallon, Holy Island, etc., there are some views of Perthshire, Jedburgh, Roxburgh, and other places inland. The collection also contains an unfinished drawing of Fernilee, subscribed 'The house were (sic) the \"Flowers of the Forest\" was written'.\n\nScope and Contents\n\nThe sketches were probably made on the tour of 1780-1782 described in MSS.3628-3629, 3634.\n\nSketches found loose in the album have been pasted in.\n\nScope and Contents\n\nThe sketches include scenes, portraits, objects, and incidents. Some are the source of woodcuts in John Hanning Speke’s ‘Journal of the discovery of the source of the Nile’ 1863, and some of these have notes in Speke’s hand."
