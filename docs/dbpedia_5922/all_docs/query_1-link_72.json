Princess Charlotte of Wales’s Royal Wedding in 1816 | Wedding Jewels Royal Jewels History\n\nThe wedding dress of Princess Charlotte of Wales was worn at her wedding to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld on 2 May 1816 at Carlton House in London.\n\nCharlotte was the only child of George, Prince of Wales and Caroline of Brunswick; Leopold was the youngest son of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and Countess Augusta Reuss of Ebersdorf.\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Wales | Royal Wedding 1816 | Wedding Jewels Royal Jewels History\n\nEmeralds from the Sultan Abdul Hamid -Cartier-the Maharaja of Nawanagar -Princess Anastasia of Greece -Harry Winston to Mrs Heidi Horten\n\nMuzo emeralds are found in the Muzo mines of Colombia.\n\nThe journey of the Sultan’s collection of muzo emeralds from its origins in the Ottoman Empire to its current place in the possession of Mrs. Heidi Horten has been a long and fascinating one. The emerald was initially part of a collection owned by Abdul Hamid II, the last sultan of the Ottoman Empire. When the sultan was forced to abdicate in 1909, his collection of gems was sold at auction in Paris, and his emeralds were purchased by Cartier.\n\nOver the years, the emerald changed hands several times, eventually ending up in the possession of Harry Winston. In 1959, Winston purchased a collection of 17 emeralds from the Maharaja of Nawanagar, six of which were used to create a necklace that included the Sultan’s emerald.\n\nThe necklace, which also included pear-shaped and round diamonds, was valued at one and a half million dollars at the time of its creation. Although several potential buyers expressed interest, only one South American seriously negotiated for it, but he ultimately decided to invest his money elsewhere.\n\nThe necklace was eventually sold to a European connoisseur, who had it mounted in its current form.\n\nMr. Horten later purchased the necklace for his wife, who wore it until her death in 2022. Now, the necklace is set to be offered at auction at Christie’s in Geneva in May 2023.\n\nThe story of the Sultan’s emeralds is a testament to the enduring appeal of rare and beautiful gems. Despite changing hands many times over the years, the necklace has remained a coveted piece of jewelry, admired for its exquisite craftsmanship and timeless elegance.\n\nFor the details of the history:::\n\nHeidi Horten Important Jewels| Extraordinary Emerald and Diamond Necklace rectangular-shaped emerald 68.13ct Harry Winston| Royal Jewel History Famous Jewellery"
