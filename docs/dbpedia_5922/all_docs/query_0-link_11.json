Alice Massey, Vincent’s wife, was not there to greet them as she died in 1950.\n\n“During his time in Canada, he [Bessborough] witnessed a country that had successfully emerged from the Depression of the 1930s, but also a country changed by World War II and the Korean War.”\n\nVere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough, died March 10, 1956, age 75. As with his predecessor Freeman Freeman-Thomas, Lord Willingdon, Hansard reported tributes to the late Lord Bessborough, March 13, 1956, in the House of Lords. Part of what was said, we learned in last Ponderings.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“But the main achievement of his earlier years was, of course, his tenure of the great position of Governor General of Canada. For that country he retained an abiding affection to the end of his life, and the moving tribute paid to him by Mr. Byers in The Times this morning is, I think, some indication of the high regard in which he is still held there. More recently, his chief interest was in furthering close relations between this country and France; and though his work in this sphere, like everything he did, was quiet and unobtrusive, those in touch with the Franco-British Society will, I know, be aware how ceaselessly and how successfully he laboured in a cause which was very near to his heart. The sympathy of all of us will, I am sure, go out to Lady Bessborough and his children in their grievous loss.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nRoberte Poupart de Neuflize Ponsonby, Lady Bessborough, died in London, November 22, 1979, age 86. However, their children, two remaining of four, Frederick and Moyra, placed a tablet, in memory of their parents, in Stansted (Stanstead) Park Chapel – a private chapel on what was the Bessborough estate. It is undetermined whether Lord and Lady Bessborough are buried here. “In 1983, the 10th Earl of Bessborough [Frederick] made the decision to give Stansted Park, the arboretum, his family home, and its beautiful contents to the public.” It is now in the care of a Charitable Trust – Stansted Park Foundation.\n\nWhen Lord Bessborough’s assignment as Canada’s Governor General ended in 1935, it was time for appointment of a successor. As with Bessborough, the appointment to the vice-regal post was a decision made by the monarch – King George V and to which Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King agreed. The one thing the King and Prime Minister did not agree on was the status of Buchan. King George V wanted him in the role as a commoner, while\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMackenzie King insisted he be represented as a peer. Thus, John Buchan was assigned the role of Canadian Governor General – the 15th Governor General since Confederation in 1867. Unlike his Governor General predecessors, John Buchan, was a commoner. However, for the role, he was created Baron Tweedsmuir of Elsfield in the County of Oxford.\n\nIt might be safely assumed the appointment of a Canadian Governor General would be routine by now. Not so. Conservative Richard Bedford Bennett was Prime Minister of Canada at the time of Lord Bessborough’s appointment (1930-08-07, 1935-10-22). When the question of a choice of the person to replace Bessborough arose, Bennett approached the current Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King (1930—08-06, 1935-10-23) to consult with him regarding a perspective vice-regal replacement. “King insisted that he would oppose any appointment made before the next election, placing Bennett in an embarrassing predicament.” To add to the drama, King George V’s private secretary was “pressing for urgent action”. To comply with the urging of the private secretary, Bennett offered Mackenzie King complete freedom to name his choice.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nKing was acquainted with Buchan through a mutual friend and greatly admired him. By the time the newly appointed Lord Tweedsmuir arrived in Canada, Mackenzie King was once, again, prime minister and “enthused that nothing would afford him more “comfort and satisfaction as that I shall have you at my side as a counsellor and friend [and that] our paths have been brought together through the guidance of Providence”.\n\nOne of Tweedsmuir’s sons, expressed the thought his father “was patience itself” with Mackenzie King, “an odd mixture of hard, political shrewdness and an unappealing kind of sentimentality, and was given to fits of high enthusiasm punctuated by sulks. He was extremely touchy and inclined to imagine slights where none were intended.”\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThus, Tweedsmuir ‘s five-year term – November 2, 1935 – February 11, 1940, began. Lord and Lady (Susan) Tweedsmuir, both authors – John Buchan, of Thirty-nine Steps fame, she of books and plays under the name, Susan Buchan, arrived in Ottawa to reside, as was the custom for a vice-regal couple – in Rideau Hall.\n\nAs one could rightly expect, Tweedsmuir took seriously his responsibilities and tried to make the office of Governor General relevant to the lives of ordinary Canadians. His opinion: “A Governor General is in a unique position, for it is his duty to know the whole of Canada and all the various types of her people.”\n\nTo fulfil the getting to know the “whole of Canada” part, Tweedsmuir travelled throughout the country, including Arctic regions, as well as Western Canada – Peace River and Peace Country. In doing so, he took every opportunity to speak to Canadians and to encourage development of own distinct identity. Building national unity was important. To do so, he figured diminishing religious and linguistic barriers dividing the country would go a long way to meeting that goal. He was well-aware of effect of Great Depression on the country’s people. “He often wrote with compassion about their difficulties”.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBefore we go too far in the story and travels of Canada’s 15th Governor General, it would be well to delve into his Peace Country journey.\n\nAugust 15, 1939, the vice-regal train with Lord and Lady Tweedsmuir and vice-regal party made an early morning pass through Peace River on way to Hines Creek from whence it would later return to town. Their Excellencies were met in Hines Creek at 11:09 a.m. by “hundreds of enthusiastic men, women and children, including representatives from Legion, Women’s Institute, Girl Guides, Boy Scouts, and Cubs. Scottish music was supplied by Howard McLean of Fairview, who had brought along his pipes for the occasion.”\n\nThe vice-regal party detrained, shook hands with some of the welcomers before entering cars, which took them to Saskatoon Hill, a few miles north of town, “where they walked about, after which they returned to town. They appeared to enjoy their outing very much”.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBouquets were presented to Lady Tweedsmuir – one by Mr. Michaelson and the other by little Marjory Crighton. “Marjory caused quite a laugh, as shortly after she had made her presentation, the train started to move away and she said to Lady Tweedsmuir, ‘You are out of luck Lady Tweedsmuir, your train is leaving you.’”\n\nWhen the special train returned to Peace River – Lady Tweedsmuir on board, “the vice-regal party,[including two sons – Hon. John N.S. Buchan and hon. Alistair Buchan; Lord Tweedsmuir’s brother, Walter Buchan, a banker of Peebles, Scotland; also of Peebles, His Excellency’s secretary, Sir Shuldham Redfern] was met at the station by His Worship, Mayor Sutherland, and Mrs. [Clara] Sutherland, Mr. and Mrs. W.J. Lampley, [Anglican] Bishop and Mrs. Sovereign, members of Town Council and their wives, and hundreds of citizens of the town and district. As the Governor General stepped from his car, the band played the National Anthem, after which the crowd gave three cheers for the distinguished visitors. His Excellency then inspected the guard of honour provided by local war veterans, speaking for some time with veterans who wore medals for special service. The Girl Guides were represented on the occasion by the district Commander, Mrs. S.C. Elliott of Berwyn and the Legion of Frontiersmen [civilian organization formed in Britain in 1905 – branches throughout Empire to prepare for war and foster vigilance in peacetime – once affiliated with RCMP until formal ties severed] by T. Catberg, also of Berwyn. Lady Tweedsmuir was presented with a bouquet by little Pat Baldwin, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. [Beulah Freeland, artist] G.W. [Ged] Baldwin [lawyer, Conservative candidate Peace River constituency – Access to information Act].\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Buchan/Tweedsmuir story continues in next Ponderings.\n\nSources: Peace River Remembers, Jack Coulter, Frank Richardson; Turning the Pages of Time – History of Nampa and Surrounding Districts; Peace River Museum, Archives and Mackenzie Centre files; Peace River Record-Gazette; Peace River Standard; Coots, Codgers and Curmudgeons – Hal C.
