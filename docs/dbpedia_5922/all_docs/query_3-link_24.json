        "text": "Monatgue was the fourth child and second son of Charles Eliot and Constance Guest, known to family and friends as Monty.\n\nMonty Eliot is an ongoing \"research project\", so I haven't finished a full biography for his page here. He suceeded his older brother to the Earldom in 1942, after which time he made his home at Port Eliot. However, it appears that he must have spent the majority of the previous twenty years (during which time his brother was Earl but never actually resided at Port Eliot) living there as well. He owned Ince Castle in Cornwall during this period as well, though exactly when and for how long are still a mystery. If anyone can add information about his time at Port Eliot or Ince Castle during this time, that would be wonderful!\n\nMany photos of Monty survive in the Port Eliot albums, as well as a portrait or two. There are some photos in the right-hand column here, and you can also click on the button to see more photos.\n\nLike his siblings, Monty inherited a musical talent from his mother. While he was not listed in newspaper reports as often as his sisters, he did perform at some family functions and benefits. He played the banjo, clarinet and saxophone.\n\n— The following was written by Peregrine, 10th Earl St. Germans. He was feeling reminiscent about his grandfather, so he wrote the following:\n\nThe Honorable Montague Charles Eliot was my grandfather. He was sent to Charterhouse, where among his childhood friends was Baden Powell. He then went up to Oxford, in 1890, where he made a glittering success of himself at Exeter Collage at Oxford. In Athletics, he was a winning miler and long jumper. In his studies, he attained a double first in Classics. In those days, Classics included a fluency in Greek, Latin and Hebrew; whereby, he could create triple acrostics in all three languages. Having came down from Oxford, he went to up the Bar but never practiced.\n\n‘Monty’ Eliot was a witty, immensely clever and popular ‘fellow’; known amongst his contemporaries as \"the Big Shot\". His accumulated lifetime bag out shooting reached an incredible 260,000 kills. His game books are filled with little drawings of curious or funny incidents of the day’s sport (e.g., people falling into ditches or having their hats blown away in bad weather). He shot with the Prince of Wales [later King Edward VII] a lot, and they became close friends.\n\nMy grandfather had a lifelong affair with Am Dram [Amateur Drama] on the stage and also played multiple instruments. I have found programs of late 19th-century Theatricals at Port Eliot with Monty, aged three, playing ‘The cat that sat on the mat.’ He performed and wrote clever charades and review sketches at Oxford, in country houses and at Court. He also staged elaborate gala shows in London theatres, with Royal patronage, for various charities.\n\nIn 1899, my grandfather became a member of Queen Victoria’s household, remaining at Court to serve all the Monarchs of the twentieth century. He looked the very essence of a courtier: tall, cadaverous, straight-backed, high and mighty, not to mention immaculately dressed. It was said of him at the time “that he has all the stiffness of a poker with none of its occasional warmth.” His clothes were often outside the curve of current fashion, neither eccentric nor flash, just extremely stylish. He sported many bejewelled shirt studs, fancy cufflinks and curious tie pins (one of which was definitely not suitable for the grandchildren to see and which, I imagine, had been acquired in the Naughty Nineties). I stumbled on these things years after his death in stud boxes and trunks in long-unvisited attics.\n\n— \"Sheffield Daily Telegraph\" 18 May 1870, page 3:\n\nEliot.– On the 18th inst., at 2, Ovington-gardens, the Hon. Mrs. Charles Eliot, of a son.\n\n— \"Cheltenham Looker-On\" 25 Jun 1910, page 7:\n\nThe Marriage was celebrated on Wednesday afternoon at St. George's Church, Honver Square, of Mr. Montague Eliot, one of the Grooms in Waiting to the late King Edward, son of the late Colonel the Hon. Charles Eliot and Hon. Mrs. Eliot, and nephew of the Earl of St. Germans, to Miss Helen Agnes Post, daughter of the late Mr. Arthur Post and of Lady Barrymore. The bride arrived at half-past two o'clock, accompanied by Lord Barrymore, who afterwards gave her away, and was met inside the entrance by her bridesmaids and pages. The bridesmaids were the Hon. Dorothy Smith-Barry, her half-sister; Lady Wenteth Ponsonby, cousin of the bridegroom; Miss Coxwell Rogers, Miss Margaret Trefusis, Miss Conellan, and Miss Clare Frewen. The bride was wearing a robe of white satin with train of anitque lace over chiffon. Her old lace veil, lent by Lord Barrymore's sister, Mrs. Oswald of Auchincruive, was worn over a wreath of orange flowers, and her ornaments included an aquamarine pendant set with diamonds, given her by the bridegroom. Her train was carried by two little pages attired in white satin suits, Lord Clonmore, son of the Earl and Countess of Wicklow, and Master Horace Renshaw, son of Mr. and Lady Winifred Renshaw. Her bridesmaids wore white satin dresses with embroidered chiffon tunics and tulle veils over wreaths of silver rose leaves. They carried sheaves of white lilium longiflorum tied with silver ribbon, and wore blue pendants set in diamonds, the gifts of the bridegroom. Viscount Duncannon, M.P. for Cheltenham, discharged the duties of best man. Hundreds of magnificent presents were received; among them a large silver bowl from the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, a tall seilver flower vase from teh Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Sweden. Lady Barrymore's gifts to her daughter included a diamond and ruby necklace, a diamond ring, a gold fitted dressing case, and all the furniture for her new house. From Lord Barrymore there is a grand piano, and the Hon. Mrs. Charles Eliot gives her son a canteen of table silver. The Earl and Countess of Bessborough sent a large silver tea-tray, and Viscount Duncannon, M.P., a large silver-gilt pheasant. There was a large number of guests, the ladies on entering the church being handed bunches of Caroline Testout roses, and the men received carnation buttonholes. Miss Post is the third American girl to be married into our peerage within a fortnight.\n\n— OBE Awarded on 08 Jul 1919.\n\nLt. Commander Montague C.

GERMANS\n\nThe Earl of St. Germans died yesterday at Port Eliot, St. Germans, Cornwall, aged 90. He became the 8th earl by the death of his brother in 1942.\n\nEducated at Charterhouse and Oxford, he was called to the Bar in 1895. He was a lieutenant-commander, R.N.V.R. 1914-19, after which he was attached to the Royal Household. He married Helen Agnes Post, daughter of the late Mr. Arthur Post, of New York, in 1910.\n\n— \"England & Wales, National Probate Calendar\" (1961, S, St, 55):\n\nSt. Germans (Eighth Earl of) Montague Charles of Port Eliot St. Germans Cornwall died 19 September 1960.

Former Grant P.R. 2 February 1961\n\nMonty Eliot's wedding to Nellie Post was one of the big news items of the day, particularly as it was one of three marriages in a two-week period where an American girl married a gentleman of the British Peerage. Another interesting fact is that the wedding took place in London, when the country was still in mourning for the recently departed King Edward VII. This accounts for most of the guests arriving in black or grey and the bridal party wearing silver and grey. The following transcriptions are some very interesting descriptions of the lavish ceremony and celebration.\n\n— \"Cheltenham Looker-On\" 25 Jun 1910, page 7:\n\nThe Marriage was celebrated on Wednesday afternoon at St. George's Church, Honver Square, of Mr. Montague Eliot, one of the Grooms in Waiting to the late King Edward, son of the late Colonel the Hon.
