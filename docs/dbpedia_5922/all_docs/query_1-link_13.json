        "text": "THE EARLS OF BESSBOROUGH WERE THE SECOND LARGEST LANDOWNERS IN COUNTY KILKENNY, WITH 23,967 ACRES\n\nThis ancient and noble family derives its origin from Picardy, in France.\n\nTheir ancestor accompanied William, Duke of Normandy, in his expedition to England, and his descendants established their residence at Haile, near Whitehaven, in Cumberland.\n\nThey assumed their surname from the lordship of Ponsonby, in Cumberland.\n\nThe office of Barber to the King was conferred upon them about the same time as the Earl of Arran's ancestor was appointed Butler.\n\nJOHN PONSONBY, of Haile Hall, was great-grandfather of\n\nSIR JOHN PONSONBY (c1609-78), Knight, of Haile, Colonel of a regiment of horse in the service of CROMWELL, who wedded Dorothy, daughter of John Brisco, of Crofton, Cumberland, and had by her a son, JOHN, ancestor of MILES PONSONBY, of Haile.\n\nSir John married secondly, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry, 1st Baron Folliott, and widow of Richard, son and heir of Sir Edward Wingfield, and by her had issue, from which derives the family of which we are about to treat.\n\nColonel Ponsonby, removing himself into Ireland, was appointed one of the commissioners for taking the depositions of the Protestants, concerning murders said to have been committed during the war, and was Sheriff of counties Wicklow and Kilkenny in 1654.\n\nHe represented the latter county in the first parliament called after the Restoration; had two grants of lands under the acts of settlement, and, by accumulating debentures, left a very considerable fortune.\n\nSir John was succeeded by his eldest son,\n\nSIR HENRY PONSONBY, Knight, at whose decease, in the reign of WILLIAM III, without issue, the estates devolved upon his brother,\n\nTHE RT HON WILLIAM PONSONBY (1659-1724), of Bessborough, MP for County Kilkenny in the reigns of ANNE and GEORGE I, who was sworn of the Privy Council in 1715, and elevated to the peerage, in 1721, in the dignity of Baron Bessborough. of Bessborough, County Kilkenny.\n\nHis lordship was advanced to a viscountcy, in 1723, as Viscount Duncannon, of Duncannon, County Wexford.\n\nHe married Mary, sister of Brabazon Moore, of Ardee, County Louth, and had, with six daughters, three sons,\n\nBRABAZON, his heir;\n\nHenry, major-general;\n\nFolliott.\n\nHis lordship was succeeded by his eldest son,\n\nBRABAZON, 2nd Viscount (1679-1758), who was advanced to an earldom, in 1739, as EARL OF BESSBOROUGH; and created a peer of Great Britain, 1749, as Baron Ponsonby of Sysonsby, Leicestershire.\n\nHis lordship wedded firstly, Sarah, widow of Hugh Colville, and daughter of James Margetson (son and heir of the Most Rev James Margetson, Lord Archbishop of Armagh), and had issue,\n\nWILLIAM, his successor;\n\nJohn, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons;\n\nRichard;\n\nSarah, m to Edward, 5th Earl of Drogheda;\n\nAnne, m to Benjamin Burton;\n\nElizabeth, m to Rt Hon Sir W Fownes Bt;\n\nLetitia, m to Hervey, Viscount Mountmorres.\n\nThe 1st Earl espoused secondly, in 1733, Elizabeth, eldest daughter and co-heir of John Sankey, of Tenelick, County Longford (and widow of Sir John King, and of John Moore, Lord Tullamore), but by that lady had no issue.\n\nHe was succeeded by his elder son,\n\nWILLIAM, 2nd Earl (1704-93), who married, in 1739, Lady Caroline Cavendish, eldest daughter of William, Duke of Devonshire, and had surviving issue,\n\nFREDERICK, his successor;\n\nCatherine, m to Aubrey, 5th Duke of St Albans;\n\nCharlotte, m to William, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam.\n\nHis lordship was succeeded by his only son,\n\nFREDERICK, 3rd Earl (1758-1844), who wedded, in 1780, Henrietta Frances, second daughter of John, 1st Earl Spencer, and had issue,\n\nJOHN WILLIAM, his successor;\n\nFrederick Cavendish (Sir);\n\nWilliam Francis, 1st Baron de Mauley;\n\nCaroline.\n\nHis lordship was succeeded by his eldest son,\n\nJOHN WILLIAM, 4th Earl (1781-1847), LORD LIEUTENANT OF IRELAND, 1846-7, who espoused, in 1805, the Lady Maria Fane, daughter of John, 10th Earl of Westmorland, and had issue,\n\nJOHN GEORGE BRABAZON, his successor;\n\nWilliam Wentworth Brabazon;\n\nFREDERICK GEORGE BRABAZON, 6th Earl;\n\nGeorge Arthur Brabazon;\n\nWALTER WILLIAM BRABAZON, 7th Earl;\n\nSpender Cecil (Rt Hon Sir);\n\nGerald Henry Brabazon;\n\nMaria Jane Elizabeth; Kathleen Louisa Georgina; Georgiana Sarah; Augusta Lavinia Priscilla.\n\nHis lordship was succeeded by his eldest son,\n\nJOHN GEORGE BRABAZON (1809-80), 5th Earl, who wedded twice, though the marriages were without issue, and the family honours devolved upon his brother,\n\nFREDERICK GEORGE BRABAZON (1815-95), 6th Earl, DL, who died unmarried, when the titles devolved upon his brother,\n\nTHE REV WALTER WILLIAM BRABAZON (1821-1906), 7th Earl, who married, in 1850, the Lady Louisa Susan Cornwallis Eliot, daughter of Edward, 3rd Earl of St Germans, and had issue,\n\nEDWARD, his successor;\n\nCyril Walter;\n\nGranville;\n\nArthur Cornwallis;\n\nWalter Gerald;\n\nEthel Jemima; Sara Kathleen; Maria.\n\nHis lordship was succeeded by his eldest son,\n\nEDWARD, 8th Earl (1851-1920), KP CB CVO JP DL, who wedded, in 1875, Blanche Vere, daughter of Sir Josiah John Guest, 1st Baronet, and had issue,\n\nVERE BRABAZON, his successor;\n\nCyril Myles Brabazon;\n\nBertie Brabazon;\n\nOlwen Verena; Helena Blanche Irene; Gweneth Frida.\n\nHis lordship was succeeded by his eldest son,\n\nVERE BRABAZON (1880-1956), 9th Earl, GCMG PC DL,\n\nJohn William Ponsonby, 4th Earl (1781–1847);\n\nJohn George Brabazon Ponsonby, 5th Earl (1809–80);\n\nFrederick George Brabazon Ponsonby, 6th Earl (1815–95);\n\nWalter William Brabazon Ponsonby, 7th Earl (1821–1906);\n\nEdward Ponsonby, 8th Earl (1851–1920);\n\nVere Brabazon Ponsonby, 9th Earl (1880–1956);\n\nFrederick Edward Neuflize Ponsonby, 10th Earl (1913–93);\n\nArthur Mountifort Longfield Ponsonby, 11th Earl (1912–2002);\n\nMyles Fitzhugh Longfield Ponsonby, 12th Earl (b 1941).\n\nThe heir apparent is the present holder's son, Frederick Arthur William Ponsonby, styled Viscount Duncannon.\n\nBESSBOROUGH HOUSE is located in Kildalton near Piltown in County Kilkenny.\n\nIt was first built in 1745 by Francis Bindon for the 1st Earl of Bessborough.\n\nBessborough House, as stated by Mark Bence-Jones, consists of a centre block of two storeys over a basement joined to two-storey wings by curved sweeps.\n\nThe entrance front has nine bays; a three-bay pedimented breakfront with a niche above the pedimented Doric doorway.\n\nThe roof parapet has urns, while the basement is rusticated; perron and double stairway with ironwork railings in front of the entrance door.\n\nThe Hall has a screen of Ionic columns made of Kilkenny marble.\n\nThe Saloon has a ceiling of Rococo plasterwork; and a notable chimney-piece.\n\nBessborough House had to be rebuilt in 1929 following a catastrophic fire in 1923, and the Bessboroughs never returned to it as a consequence.\n\nIn 1940, the Oblate Fathers established a seminary at Bessborough House.\n\nThe Oblates worked their own bakery, and farmed dairy cows, poultry, cattle, pigs, sheep. They grew potatoes, grain and other crops.\n\nThey also had a very good orchard.\n\nAlas, the great mansion has been altered and added-to since the Ponsonbys left: The urns have been removed from the parapet and are now at Belline.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1971, 360 priests were ordained in Bessborough House, Kildalton.\n\nBy 1970, numbers joining the order had fallen and the Oblates decided to sell the property.\n\nIt was bought for £250,000 by the Irish Department of Agriculture in 1971.\n\nIt was then opened as an agricultural and horticultural college and renamed Kildalton College.\n\nOther seats ~ Parkstead House, Surrey; Sysonby, Leicestershire; Stansted Park, West Sussex.\n\nFirst published in September, 2011.
