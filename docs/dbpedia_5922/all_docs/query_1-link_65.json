Purdy EM\n\n​Honorary Colonel: Honorary Colonel William Wasbrough Foster, DSO, VD\n\nHonorary Lieutenant-Colonel: Honorary Lieutenant-Colonel William Culham Woodward, ED\n\n​Bandmaster: Will Edmunds\n\n​The following pictures are from Vancouver Archives where they may have been incorrectly identified as Armoury Opening 1944 rather than the actual 1934 date. They show the members of the Brigade providing demonstrations for a very well attired audience.\n\nTraining\n\nTraining was conducted at Sarcee Camp and the following photo shows the members that attended at Sarcee Camp near Calgary.\n\nCamp Hughes 1934\n\nThe following photographs and descriptions are from Edward (Ted) Edmonds collection. This was an austerity camp where the Batteries only sent skeleton detachments. Fortunately, Ted included many names in his album and we can identify some of the early members of the 15th Brigade. Unfortunately, some of the photos are duplicated in a series donated by Brigadier Theodore DuMoulin and labelled​Camp Hughes 1932. Which is correct? See more...\n\nRegimental Band\n\nThe Band of the 15th Field Brigade, said to be one of the finest military bands in Canada, had a very active year under the leadership of Bandmaster Will Edmunds. The events included the Girl Guide Pagent in May, a concert on Newcastle Island in June, weekly concerts in Alexandra Park starting in July, a Mess Dance in October​.
