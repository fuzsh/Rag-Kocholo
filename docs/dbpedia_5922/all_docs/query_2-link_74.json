        "text": "New York Times 15 Dec 1893. MARRIED TO AN EARL.\n\nMiss Adele Grant or New-York Becomes the Countess of Essex.\n\nLONDON, Dec. 14 [1893].â€”The marriage of Miss [his wife] Adele Grant (age 27), daughter of the late Beach Grant of New-York, to the Earl of Essex (age 36) took place at 2:30 0'clock this afternoon at St. Margaret's Church, Westminster [Map]. Archdeacon Farrar, assisted by the Rev. Mr. Lee, the Rev. Mr. James, and the Chaplain of the Duke of Essex, the Rev. George Chapel, officiated.\n\nThe bride wore a white satin dress, the train of which was embroidered with silver sunrays. The bodice was trimmed with point d'Alencon lace. The bridal veil was of Alencon lace, which the bride's mother wore at her wedding. The only ornament worn by the bride was a diamond tiara, the gift of the Earl of Essex. Instead of a bouquet, she carried an ivory Prayer Book.\n\nThere were seven bridesmaids. Those were Edythe Grant, Alberta Paget, Mary Colebrooke, Diana Sturt, the Hon. Eustace Daunay, the Hon. Leila Daunay, and Gwenfra Williams. They wore white satin dresses, draped in soft folds and bordered with mink, and velvet toques trimmed with fur. Each of them carried a long Louis XV. stick, with a gold tip, decorated with roses, the gift of the Earl of Essex. Baron Tuyll was the best man. Suydam Grant, a brother [a mistake for uncle] of the bride, gave her away. The service was full choral. Sir Arthur Sullivan presided at the organ. The floral decorations were extensive and rich.\n\nAfter the ceremony, a reception was given at the residence of Mrs. Grant, 35 Great Cumberland Place. It was largely attended. In the early afternoon, the newly-married couple departed for their honeymoon, which will be spent at Cassiobury, Watford.\n\nOver 300 presents were received, many of which came from the United States and the Continent."
