        "text": "Category Archives: Peerages: United Kingdom\n\nGeorge Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Favorite of King James I of England and King Charles I of England\n\nby Susan Flantzer\n\nÂ© Unofficial Royalty 2021\n\nFavorite: a person treated with special or undue favor by a king, queen, or another royal person\n\nGeorge Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, a courtier and favorite of King James I of England and his son King Charles I until a disgruntled army officer assassinated him, was born on August 28, 1592, in Brooksby, Leicestershire, England. George was the second of the three sons and the second of the four children of Sir George Villiers (circa 1544 â 1606) and his second wife Mary Beaumont (circa 1570 â 1632).\n\nGeorge had three siblings:\n\nSusan Villiers (1589 â 1652), married William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh, had five children\n\nJohn Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck (circa 1590 â 1657), married Frances Coke, no children\n\nChristopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey (died 1630), married Elizabeth Sheldon, had two children\n\nGeorge had five half-siblings from his fatherâs first marriage to Audrey Saunders who died in 1588:\n\nSir William Villiers, 1st Baronet (circa 1575 â 1629), married (1) Anne Griffin, no children (2) Anne Fiennes, had one child (3) Rebecca Roper, had three children\n\nSir Edward Villiers (circa 1585 â 1626) married Barbara St. John, had ten children, grandparents of Barbara Villiers,1st Duchess of Cleveland, mistress of King Charles II\n\nElizabeth Villiers (died 1654), married John Boteler, 1st Baron Boteler of Brantfield, had eight children\n\nFrances Villiers, unmarried\n\nAnne Villiers (born 1588), married Sir William Washington (elder brother of Lawrence Washington, the great-great-grandfather of George Washington), had two children\n\nSir George Villiers, Georgeâs father, was a well-to-do sheep farmer. He was High Sheriff of Leicestershire in 1591, knighted in 1593, and a Member of Parliament from 1604 until he died in 1606. Georgeâs mother Mary Beaumont was a poor cousin of her husband but she had ambitions for her second son George. She recognized that he had potential and found the funds to send George to the French court where he learned courtly skills and improved his French. When George returned from France, Mary provided him with a suitable wardrobe and sent him to the English court in 1614 where he quickly became the new favorite of King James I. As George rose, his mother, his siblings, and his half-siblings rose along with him. In 1618, King James I retorted that he lived to no other end but to advance the Villiers family.\n\nIn 1615, George was knighted and became a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. He became Master of the Horse in 1616, was raised to the peerage as Baron Whaddon, Viscount Villiers, and was made a Knight of the Garter. In 1619, George was made Lord High Admiral of England. In 1617, George was created Earl of Buckingham and climbed the steps of peerage when he was created Marquess of Buckingham in 1618, and Duke of Buckingham in 1623.\n\nGeorgeâs mother Mary chose Katherine Manners, the only surviving child of Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland, and the richest woman in England, to marry George. However, because Katherine was Catholic, King James I refused to allow the marriage, and Katherineâs father refused to accept the demands for an extremely lucrative dowry. Katherine did convert to the Church of England which greatly upset her father. Georgeâs mother Mary entrapped Katherine into the marriage by arranging for her to spend the night under the same roof as George, ruining her reputation, and leaving her family with no choice but to allow her to marry George. George and Katherine married on May 16, 1620.\n\nGeorge and Katherine had four children:\n\nMary Villiers (1622 â 1685), married (1) Charles Herbert, Lord Herbert, no children (2) James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox, had two children (3) Colonel Thomas Howard, no children\n\nCharles Villiers, Earl of Coventry (1625 â 1627), died in childhood\n\nGeorge Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (1628 â 1687), married Mary Fairfax, no children\n\nLord Francis Villiers (1629 â 1648), unmarried, died in a skirmish at Kingston during the Second English Civil War\n\nWhether the personal relationship between King James I and his male favorites was a sexual one is still debated by historians. Some historians think that James Iâs need for a close male favorite came from a lack of family while growing up in Scotland where he became King of Scots when he was one year old. James I did not know his parents Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley and Mary, Queen of Scots and he had no siblings. His maternal grandparents died before he was born. His paternal grandfather died while James was still a boy and his paternal grandmother lived in England. James I compared his love for George to Jesusâ love of his apostle John when he spoke to his Privy Council about rumors in 1617: âYou may be sure that I love the Earl of Buckingham more than anyone else, and more than you who are here assembled. I wish to speak in my own behalf and not to have it thought to be a defect, for Jesus Christ did the same, and therefore I cannot be blamed. Christ had John, and I have George.â\n\nGeorge was King James Iâs constant companion and closest advisor until the king died. George greatly influenced James Iâs son and successor, the future King Charles I, while he was Prince of Wales. By 1624, an increasingly ill James I was finding it difficult to control Parliament. Before King James I died in March 1625, Charles and George had already assumed de facto control of England. At the end of King James Iâs reign and the beginning of King Charles Iâs reign, George had a number of diplomatic and military failures that caused Parliament to refuse to fund any more of his endeavors. Parliament then attempted to impeach George twice but King Charles I rescued him by dissolving Parliament both times. George was widely considered a public enemy by the English people. Georgeâs physician Dr. Lambe, popularly supposed to have an evil influence on him, was killed by a mob in the street. A pamphlet published after Dr. Lambeâs death said:\n\nLet Charles and George do what they can\n\nThe Duke shall die like Doctor Lambe\n\nJohn Felton (1595 â 1628) had been an army officer and had submitted petitions to the Privy Council over two matters, back pay he believed he was owed, and his promotion to captain, which he believed he had been unfairly denied. He was unsuccessful in resolving these matters and believed George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham was responsible. Felton further believed that his grievances against George were part of Georgeâs treacherous and wicked influence on the English government. He decided to kill George and traveled to Portsmouth where he knew George was staying.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAssassination of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham\n\nOn August 23, 1628, George was staying at the Greyhound Inn in Portsmouth, England while planning another military campaign. After having breakfast, George left the inn. John Felton made his way through the crowd that surrounded George and stabbed the 35-year-old Duke of Buckingham in the chest with a dagger, killing him. Felton could have escaped in the resulting chaos but instead, expecting to be well received, he confessed to the gathering crowd. He was immediately arrested, and taken before a judge who sent him to London for interrogation. Because of the unpopularity of the Duke of Buckingham, Feltonâs deed received widespread approval and was celebrated in poems and pamphlets. After being tried and found guilty, John Felton was hanged on November 29, 1628, at Tyburn, the principal place for execution in London.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe Chapel of St. Nicholas at Westminster Abbey where George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham is buried\n\nKing Charles I ordered George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham to be buried at Westminster Abbey in London, England in the Chapel of St. Nicholas which had previously been reserved for those only of royal descent. A lavish tomb of black and white marble and bronze was constructed by his widow in 1634 with an effigy of George and his wife Katherine although she is not buried there. Katherine succeeded to one of her fatherâs titles Baron de Ros of Helmsley upon his death in 1632, becoming the 18th Baroness de Ros of Helmsley in her own right. She married for a second time to Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim in 1635, and went to live at Dunluce Castle in County Antrim, Ireland. Katherine survived her first husband by twenty-one years, dying in Waterford, Ireland, probably of the plague. She was buried in Waterford but there is a memorial to her in Westminster Abbey.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was christened on January 30, 1670, so it can be assumed he was probably born shortly before his christening. His parents were Osewolt van Keppel, Lord of Voorst (1630 â 1685) and Reinira Anna Geertruida van Lintelo (1638 â 1700). The van Keppel family is of old Gelderland nobility.\n\nArnold had at least one brother:\n\nJan Rabo van Keppel (circa 1665-1733), married Cornelia Mechteld Van Lynden, had at least one son\n\nSometime in his teens, possibly as early as 1685, Arnold became a page of honor to Willem III, Prince of Orange. Willem III was the only child of Willem II, Prince of Orange and Mary, Princess Royal, who was the eldest daughter of King Charles I of England. In 1677, Willem III married his first cousin the future Queen Mary II of England, the elder of the two surviving children, both daughters, of the future King James II of England and his first wife Anne Hyde. Being the grandson of King Charles I of England, Willem III was also in the line of succession to the English throne and eventually co-reigned as King William III of England with his wife and first cousin Queen Mary II of England. William and Mary came to power in England during the Glorious Revolution of 1688, following the birth of a Catholic heir James Francis Edward Stuart to Maria Beatrice of Modena, the second wife of King James II of England, Maryâs father and Willem IIIâs uncle. When the new King William III of England, with his name anglicized as William, came to England, Arnold accompanied him as a member of his household. King William III remained Prince of Orange and Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic.\n\nArnold rose in royal favor and became a Gentleman of the Bedchamber (1690 â 1695) in William IIIâs household. He copied Williamâs letters and spent many hours with the king, resulting in jealousy among some courtiers, particularly Williamâs long-time friend and favorite, and a fellow Dutchman, William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland. William found Arnold to be better company because Bentinck, who had governmental duties, was always preoccupied with the affairs of state. In 1691, William returned to the Dutch Republic where a military meeting with his allies was planned in The Hague and Arnold accompanied him. During a hunting holiday with some of the meeting participants at Het Loo Palace in Apeldoorn, Dutch Republic, now in the Netherlands, Arnold was thrown from his horse and broke his leg. William was impressed that Arnold never complained about his pain and often visited him during his recovery.\n\nArnold began to receive favors and honors, both English and Dutch. In 1692, Arnold received from William, in his capacity as Prince of Orange and Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, the titles of Knight of Zutphen, Knight of Holland and West Friesland, and Lord van der Voorst. From 1695 â 1701, he served as William IIIâs Master of the Robes. Arnold was created an English peer by William in 1697 receiving the titles Earl of Albemarle, Viscount Bury, and Baron Ashford. He served as Captain and Colonel of His Majestyâs Own Troop of Horse Guards from 1699 â 1710 and in 1700, he was created a Knight of the Order of the Garter.\n\nWilliam Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland, who was Groom of the Stole, Keeper of the Privy Purse, and a Privy Councilor, continued to be jealous of Arnold, and because of this, in 1700, he resigned all his offices in the royal household. However, he never lost the esteem of King William III who continued to trust him and use him as an advisor, and it was in the arms of Bentinck that William III took his last breath in 1702.\n\nOn July 10, 1701, Arnold married Geertruida van der Duyn (1674 â 1741) in The Hague, Dutch Republic, now in the Netherlands. Her father Adam van der Duyn, Lord of âs-Gravenmoer (1639 â 1693) was a Major-General in the Dutch Army and Master of the Buckhounds to King William III. King William III gave the couple his blessing and provided the bride with a dowry and jewels.\n\nArnold and his wife, whose name was anglicized to Gertrude, had two children:\n\nWilliam van Keppel, 2nd Earl of Albemarle (1702 â 1754), married Lady Anne Lennox, daughter of Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, 1st Duke of Lennox, illegitimate son of King Charles II of England by his mistress Louise de KÃ©rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth, had over fifteen children with six surviving to adulthood\n\nLady Sophia van Keppel (1716 â 1773), married General John Thomas, had at least two sons\n\nOn February 20, 1702, King William III went riding at Hampton Court Palace. The horse stumbled on a molehill and fell. William tried to pull the horse up by the reins, but the horseâs movements caused William to fall on his right shoulder. His collarbone was broken and was set by a surgeon, but instead of resting, William insisted on returning to Kensington Palace that evening by coach. A week after the fall, the fracture was not healing well and Williamâs right hand and arm were puffy and did not look right which probably meant an infection developed. His condition continued to worsen and by March 3, William had a high fever and had difficulty breathing. By March 7, the doctors knew that William was dying and he began to say goodbye to his friends and advisors. In early February 1702, William III had sent Arnold to the Dutch Republic to plan for the upcoming military campaign, and he only returned in time to receive Williamâs farewell. William gave Arnold the keys to his cabinet and private drawers, and said, âYou know what to do with them.â On March 8, 1702, William III died. William bequeathed to Arnold the huge sum of 200,000 guilders and the Dutch Lordship of Breevorst.\n\nAfter Williamâs death, Arnold returned to the Dutch Republic and took his seat as a member of the nobility in the States-General, the legislature of the Dutch Republic. He was one of the two commanders of the Dutch forces in the Grand Allianceâs campaigns during the War of Spanish Succession (1701â1714). John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, the Grand Alliance commander, who had been on good terms with Arnold, expressed pleasure at his rejoining the allied army. In 1705, Arnold visited England and attended Queen Anne on a visit to Cambridge University, where he received the honorary degree of doctor of laws. On the death of Queen Anne in 1714, Arnold was sent to the Electorate of Hanover by the States-General to congratulate the new King George I on his accession to the British throne. Both Queen Anne and King George I held Arnold in high esteem.\n\nArnold van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle, aged 48, died on May 30, 1718, in The Hague, Dutch Republic, now in the Netherlands, and was buried in The Hague.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was the fourth of the eight children and the third of the three sons of Berent Bentinck, 6th Baron Bentinck (1597 â 1668) and Anna van Bloemendale (1622 â 1685). The Bentinck family is an old Dutch noble family whose noble rank can be traced to the 14th century.\n\nBentinck had seven siblings:\n\nHendrik Bentinck, 7th Baron Bentinck (1640 â 1691), married Ida Magdalena van Ittersum, had three daughters\n\nEusebius Bentinck, 8th Baron Bentinck (1643 â 1710), married (1) Elizabeth de Brakell, had two sons and one daughter (2) Hendrina Schimmelpenninck van der Oye, no children, died two months after her wedding\n\nEleonore Bentinck (1644 â 1710), married Robert van Ittersum, Baron Nijenhuis, no children?\n\nIsabelle Bentinck (1651 â 1687), married Alexander Schimmelpenninck van der Oye, Baron van De Engelenburg, no children, died five months after her wedding\n\nAnna Bentinck (1652 â 1721), married Dirk Borre van Amerongen, had two daughters\n\nAgnes Bentinck (1654 â 1722), unmarried?\n\nJohanna Bentinck (1597 â 1668), unmarried?\n\nIn 1664, fifteen-year-old Hans Willem Bentinck came to the court of fourteen-year-old Willem III, Prince of Orange, as a page. Willem III was the only child of Willem II, Prince of Orange and Mary, Princess Royal, the eldest daughter of King Charles I of England. Willem IIIâs father died at age 24 of smallpox eight days before Willem IIIâs birth, so when he was born on November 14, 1650, Willem III succeeded to his fatherâs titles. Being the grandson of King Charles I of England, Willem III was also in the line of succession to the English throne and eventually co-reigned as King William III of England with his wife and first cousin Queen Mary II of England.\n\nIn 1672, Bentinck became Willem IIIâs chamberlain. Along with his role at the court where he was an important advisor for Willem III, Bentinck also had a military career. When Willem III became ill with smallpox in 1675, Bentinck cared for him for sixteen days. When Willem III recovered, Bentinck fell ill with smallpox but recovered in time to accompany Willem III on a military campaign that year. Sadly, smallpox caused much personal loss for Willem III. His father Willem II, Prince of Orange, his mother Mary, Princess Royal, Princess of Orange, and his wife Queen Mary II of England all died from smallpox.\n\nIn 1677, Bentinck was Willem IIIâs special envoy to England where he sought the support of Willemâs uncle King Charles II of England in the Dutch Republicâs struggle against France. At the same time, Bentinck negotiated a marriage for Willem III with his first cousin Mary, the elder surviving daughter of James, Duke of York, later King James II of England, and his first wife Anne Hyde. 27-year-old Willem and a weepy 15-year-old Mary, prodded on by their uncle King Charles II, were married at St. Jamesâ Palace in London, England on November 4, 1677. Bentinck served as Willem IIIâs best man.\n\nBentinckâs first wife Anne Villiers (circa 1651 â 1688) was the eldest child of Sir Edward Villiers and his wife Lady Frances Howard, daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk. Anneâs mother had been the governess to Willem IIIâs new wife Mary and her younger sister, the future Queen Anne, and she used her position at court to secure positions in Maryâs new household for her daughters. Anne Villiers and her sisters Elizabeth and Katherine, were among the maids of honor who accompanied Mary to The Hague in the Dutch Republic, now in the Netherlands, to serve the new Princess of Orange. The three Villiers sisters were the first cousins of Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland, born Barbara Villiers, a mistress of King Charles II of England. Their fathers were brothers.\n\nBentinck and Anne Villiers became acquainted and on February 1, 1678, they were married. They are ancestors of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom through her motherâs family, specifically through her maternal grandmother born Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck. Five months after giving birth to her last child, Anne died on November 30, 1688, in The Hague, Dutch Republic, now in the Netherlands.\n\nBentinck and Anne had seven children:\n\nLady Mary Bentinck (1679 â 1726), married (1) Algernon Capell, 2nd Earl of Essex, had one son and two daughters (2) Sir Conyers DâArcy, no children\n\nWillem Bentinck (1681 â 1688), died in childhood\n\nHenry Bentinck, 1st Duke of Portland (1682 â 1726), married Lady Elizabeth Noel, had two sons and three daughters\n\nLady Anna Bentinck (1683 â 1763), married Arent van Wassenaar, Baron van Wassenaar, had at least one daughter\n\nLady Frances Bentinck (1684 â 1712), married William Byron, 4th Baron Byron, had three sons and one daughter who all died in childhood\n\nLady Eleonora Bentinck (1687 â ?)\n\nLady Isabella Bentinck (1688 â 1728), married Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull, had two daughters\n\nAnneâs sister Elizabeth Villiers became the mistress of Willem III, and reportedly, she was his only mistress. In 1679, when Willem III made his first advances to Elizabeth, she tried to discourage him. However, by 1680, Elizabeth was his mistress, rumors of the affair reached Paris, and Mary was probably aware of her husbandâs relationship with Elizabeth. In 1685, Maryâs father, now King James II of England, hoping to break up his daughterâs marriage with Willem III, had encouraged others to relay gossip from Mary and Willem IIIâs household to him. Through the meddling of King James II, Elizabeth and Willem IIIâs affair became public knowledge and Elizabeth was sent back to England. To stop rumors continuing in England, Elizabethâs father begged Willem III and Mary to allow Elizabeth to return to The Hague. Elizabeth was permitted to return but Mary refused to receive her. Elizabeth then went to live with her sister Katherine who had married and settled in The Hague. Bentinck had forbidden his wife Anne to socialize with her sister Elizabeth. Meanwhile, the affair between Elizabeth and Willem III continued and was to last until 1695, a total of fifteen years.\n\nFollowing his initial visit to England in 1677, Bentinck was sent on many other diplomatic missions to England, resulting in the development of a strong and influential network of contacts within English political circles. As a result, Bentinck was to play a key role in the planning and execution of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, following the birth of a Catholic heir James Francis Edward Stuart to Maria Beatrice of Modena, the second wife of King James II of England, Maryâs father and Willem IIIâs uncle. Willem III, Prince of Orange landed in England vowing to safeguard the Protestant interest. He marched to London, gathering many supporters. James II panicked and sent his wife and infant son to France. James later fled to France where his first cousin King Louis XIV of France offered him a palace and pension. Parliament refused to depose James II but declared that having fled to France, James had effectively abdicated the throne and therefore, the throne had become vacant. Jamesâs elder daughter Mary was declared Queen Mary II and she was to rule jointly with her husband Willem, whose name would be anglicized to William. He would reign in England as King William III but he remained Willem III, Prince of Orange and Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic.\n\nHaving supported King William III throughout his efforts to secure the English throne, and after accompanying him to England, Bentinck was generously rewarded. Parliament passed an act of naturalization so that he and his children would be British subjects. He was created Earl of Portland, Viscount Woodstock, and Baron Cirencester. With these titles came significant estates, including Theobalds House in Hertfordshire, England. Bentinck was appointed Groom of the Stole, Keeper of the Privy Purse, and a Privy Councilor, and he remained William IIIâs closest advisor. In 1697, William III created Bentinck a Knight of the Order of the Garter.\n\nIn late December 1694, when Mary was very ill with smallpox, Bentinck was one of the two people William III would see. On December 28, 1694, Queen Mary II of England, aged only 32, died of smallpox at Kensington Palace. When Maryâs grief-stricken husband collapsed at her death bed, it was Bentinck who carried the nearly insensible William from the room.\n\nBentinck was responsible for overseeing affairs in Scotland and played an influential role in English politics. His main achievements were diplomatic. In 1697, Bentinck played a major role in securing the Treaty of Ryswick, ending the Nine Yearsâ War (1688 â 1697) between France and the Dutch Republic. He was active in addressing the crisis of the Spanish succession through the Treaty of The Hague (1698) and the Treaty of London (1700) and became William IIIâs ambassador to France.\n\nBentinck became very jealous of the rising influence of another Dutchman Arnold Joost van Keppel. Keppel was created Earl of Albemarle by William III and emerged as the second favorite. Because of this, in 1700, Bentinck resigned all his offices in the royal household. However, he never lost the esteem of King William III who continued to trust him and use him as an advisor.\n\nOn May 12, 1700, 51-year-old Bentinck married again to 28-year-old Jane Martha Temple (1672 â 1751), daughter of Sir John Temple, and widow of John Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley of Stratton. He spent his final years consolidating his estates and adding to his family.\n\nBentinck and Jane had six children:\n\nLady Sophia Bentinck (1701 â 1741), married Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, had one son and one daughter\n\nLady Elizabeth Bentinck (1703 â 1765), married Reverand The Honorable Henry Egerton, Bishop of Hereford, had five sons and one daughter\n\nThe Honorable Willem Bentinck, 1st Count Bentinck (1704 â 1774), married Charlotte Sophie, Countess von Aldenburg, had two sons, the title of Count Bentinck of the Holy Roman Empire, was created for Willem as the second surviving son\n\nLady Harriet Bentinck (1705 â 1792), married James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Clanbrassill, had one son and one daughter\n\nThe Honorable Charles Bentinck (1708 â 1779), who married Lady Margaret Cadogan, daughter of William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan, children ?\n\nLady Barbara Bentinck (1709 â 1736), married Francis Godolphin, 2nd Baron Godolphin, no children\n\nOn February 20, 1702, King William III went riding at Hampton Court Palace. The horse stumbled on a molehill and fell. William tried to pull the horse up by the reins, but the horseâs movements caused William to fall on his right shoulder. His collarbone was broken and was set by a surgeon, but instead of resting, William insisted on returning to Kensington Palace that evening by coach. Bentinck called on William every day as he recovered. However, a week after the fall, the fracture was not healing well and Williamâs right hand and arm were puffy and did not look right which probably meant an infection developed. His condition continued to worsen and by March 3, William had a high fever and had difficulty breathing. By March 7, the doctors knew that William was dying and he began to say goodbye to his friends and advisors. By the time Bentinck arrived on March 8, 1702, William had lost his power of speech but with a look, he beckoned Bentinck to his bedside. Bentinck bent down and put his ear to Williamâs mouth but could only distinguish a few words of Williamâs incoherent speech. William then took Bentinckâs hand and placed it against his heart. Then Williamâs head fell back, he closed his eyes, took two or three breaths, and died.\n\nWilliam Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland, aged 60, died on November 23, 1709, at Bulstrode Park, one of his principal residences, in Buckinghamshire, England. He was buried at Westminster Abbey in London, England, in the Ormond Vault at the eastern end of Henry VIIâs Chapel. He has no monument but his name and date of death were added to the vault stone in the late 19th century. The Ormond Vault is now located in the Royal Air Force Chapel at Westminster Abbey and a carpet permanently covers the vault-stone with the inscribed names.\n\nBentinckâs second wife Jane survived him by 42 years, dying on June 26, 1751, in London, England, at the age of 79. She was buried in the cemetery at St. Mary the Virgin Church in Walthamstow, London, England.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Born November 10, 1565, at Netherwood near Bromyard, Herefordshire, England. Robert was the eldest of the three sons and the eldest of the five children of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex (1541 â 1576), and Lettice Knollys (1543 â 1634). Robertâs father was an army general in service to Queen Elizabeth I. Robertâs mother Lettice Knollys was the daughter of Sir Francis Knollys, who was a courtier in the service of King Henry VIII, King Edward VI, and Queen Elizabeth I, and Catherine Carey. Catherine Carey was the daughter of Mary Boleyn, the sister of Anne Boleyn, King Henry VIIIâs second wife, and the mother of Queen Elizabeth I. This made Lettice Knollys the first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth I and therefore her son Robert was Elizabethâs first cousin twice removed.\n\nRobert had four younger siblings:\n\nSir Walter Devereux (1569 â 1591), married Margaret, Dakyns, no children, killed at the Siege of Rouen\n\nPenelope Devereux (1563 â 1607), married (1) Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick, 3rd Baron Rich, had seven children, divorced due to Penelopeâs adultery (2) Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devonshire, had four children out of wedlock who were never legitimized\n\nDorothy Devereux (circa 1564 â 1619), married (1) Sir Thomas Perrot, had five children (2) Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, had four children\n\nFrancis Devereux (born and died 1572)\n\nRobertâs father died in 1576, and the eleven-year-old became the 2nd Earl of Essex and the ward of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, the chief adviser of Queen Elizabeth I. On September 21, 1578, Robert got a stepfather when his mother married Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, Queen Elizabeth Iâs long-time favorite and Robertâs godfather. Dudley feared Elizabeth Iâs reaction to his marriage and insisted that it be kept secret. However, Elizabeth I found out about the marriage two months later. She banished her cousin Lettice permanently from court, never forgave her, and never accepted the marriage. Although Dudley remained at court, he was alternately humiliated in public by Elizabeth and treated as fondly as always.\n\nRobert had one half-brother who died in childhood from his motherâs second marriage:\n\nRobert Dudley, Lord Denbigh (1581 â 1584)\n\nRobert Dudley had much influence on his godson and stepson Robert Devereux. Robert served in the military under his stepfatherâs command in the Netherlands. Several years before his death in 1588, Dudley introduced Robert to the Elizabethan court, and Elizabeth I increasingly became interested in the young man. Robert spent much time in the company of Elizabeth I and succeeded his stepfather in royal favor. Although Elizabeth I was thirty-two years older than Robert, she found it very pleasant to be adored by such a young man. In June 1587, Robert replaced Dudley as Master of the Horse. After Dudley died in 1588, Elizabeth I transferred Dudleyâs royal monopoly on sweet wines to Robert, providing him with lucrative revenue. In 1593, Robert was made a member of the Privy Council.\n\nIn 1590, Robert married Frances Walsingham, the only surviving child of Sir Francis Walsingham, Secretary of State and spymaster for Queen Elizabeth I, and Ursula St. Barbe. The marriage greatly displeased Queen Elizabeth I because the couple had not asked for permission beforehand, but she forgave them relatively quickly.\n\nRobert and Frances had five children:\n\nRobert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex (1592 â 1646), married (1) Frances Howard, no children, marriage annulled (2) Elizabeth Paulet, no children\n\nPenelope Devereux (1593/4 â 1599), died in childhood\n\nHenry Devereux (born and died 1596), died in infancy\n\nFrances Devereux (1599 â 1674), married William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset, had eight children\n\nDorothy Devereux (1600 â 1636), married Sir Henry Shirley, 2nd Baronet, had three children\n\nRobert had a petulant nature, acted on whims, and often acted disdainfully and disrespectfully. His behavior would ultimately lead to his downfall. At court, he dueled with Sir Walter Raleigh, among others, which displeased Elizabeth I. In 1591, Robert was given command of an army that was to come to the aid of Henri IV, King of France but he defied Elizabethâs instructions. In the summer of 1596, Robert managed to easily take the Spanish port of Cadiz. However, because the Spanish were able to burn their ships before the attack, there was nearly no loot but Robertâs bold act made him famous throughout Europe. However, the next year, an expedition to the Azores with Sir Walter Raleigh turned out to be a complete failure.\n\nIn 1599, Robert reluctantly accepted the post as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. At that time, the Irish revolutionary Hugh OâNeill, Earl of Tyrone was rebelling against the English rule in Ireland. After several costly battles and an armistice that was disadvantageous for England, Robert disregarded an explicit order from Elizabeth I to remain at his post in Ireland. He left Ireland in September 1599 and reached London four days later where he gained access to the chambers of the not-yet-fully-dressed Queen Elizabeth I. After interrogation by the Privy Council, Robert was placed under house arrest for ten months.\n\nRobert was released from house arrest in August 1600 but the source of his income, the monopoly on sweet wines, was not renewed. His financial situation became more and more desperate. Robert had inherited large debts from his father, and he had amassed his own large debts. Essex House, Robertâs London mansion, became a meeting place for people who were upset with Elizabeth Iâs government. On February 3, 1601, five conspiracy leaders met at the home of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. Hoping to avoid suspicion, Robert was not present. The group discussed Robertâs proposals for seizing the court, the Tower of London, and the City of London. Their goal was to force Queen Elizabeth I to change the leaders in her government, particularly Robert Cecil, Secretary of State.\n\nOn February 8, 1601, four messengers including Lord Keeper Thomas Egerton,1st Viscount Brackley came to Essex House in the name of Queen Elizabeth I to try to persuade Robert to surrender. Robert seized the four messengers and held them hostage. Then Robert and about 200 followers made their way to the City of London. Meanwhile, Robert Cecil sent a warning to the Lord Mayor of London denouncing Robert as a traitor and ordered the heralds to spread the warning throughout London. Once the word traitor was used, many of Robertâs followers disappeared, and none of the citizens joined him as he had expected. Robertâs position was desperate, and he decided to return to Essex House. When he got there, he found the hostages gone. Soldiers under Lord High Admiral Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, besieged Essex House and rescued the hostages. By that evening, after burning incriminating evidence, Robert surrendered and was arrested along with the Earl of Southampton and the other conspirators.\n\nOn February 19, 1601, Robert and Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton were tried on charges of treason. The trial lasted only a day and it was no surprise that the verdict was guilty. Robert had burned incriminating evidence to save his followers before his arrest but he was convinced by a minister he needed to reveal the identity of his conspirators to save his soul. He revealed everyone who was involved including his sister Penelope Blount, Countess of Devonshire on whom he put a great deal of the blame but no action was taken against her. Robert, the Earl of Southampton, and four others were sentenced to death. Other conspirators were fined. Through the efforts of Robert Cecil, Southamptonâs sentence was reduced to life imprisonment. Southampton and one other conspirator remained imprisoned in the Tower of London and were freed when King James I succeeded to the throne in 1603 upon the death of Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nRobertâs wife Frances attempted to see Queen Elizabeth I to plead for clemency but the queen refused to see her. On February 25, 1601, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, aged 34, was beheaded on Tower Green within the Tower of London. Beheading in the privacy of Tower Green was considered a privilege of rank and those executed there were spared insults from the jeering crowd. He was buried in the Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula at the Tower of London. Robertâs conviction for treason meant that his earldom was forfeit and his son did not inherit the title. However, after Queen Elizabeth Iâs death, King James I reinstated the earldom in favor of Robertâs disinherited son, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Sarah was the youngest of the eight children of Richard Jennings (circa 1619 â 1668), a Member of Parliament, and Frances Thornhurst (1628 â 1693), daughter and heiress of Sir Gifford Thornhurst, 1st Baronet and Susanna Temple.\n\nSarah had seven siblings:\n\nSusanna Jennings (1645 â 1655), died in childhood\n\nJohn Jennings (died 1674)\n\nFrances Jennings (circa 1649 â 1731), married (1) Sir George Hamilton, Comte Hamilton, had three daughters (2) Richard Talbot, 1st Duke of Tyrconnell, no children\n\nBarbara Jennings (1651 â 1678), married Colonel Edward Griffith, had one daughter\n\nRichard Jennings (1653 â 1654), died in infancy\n\nSusanna Jennings (1656 â ?)\n\nRalph Jennings (1656 â 1677)\n\nIn 1663, during negotiations for the recovery of an estate in Kent that had been the property of his mother-in-law, Sarahâs father Richard Jennings came into contact with James, Duke of York, the future King James II of England, and the brother of King Charles II of England. Favorably impressed with Jennings, James appointed his eldest surviving daughter Frances a maid of honor to his first wife, Anne Hyde, Duchess of York. Although Frances had to give up her post as maid of honor when she married, James did not forget the Jennings family, and in 1673, 13-year-old Sarah was appointed a maid of honor to Jamesâ second wife Maria Beatrice of Modena.\n\nAlso at court were the two surviving children from Jamesâ first marriage to Anne Hyde, Mary (the future Queen Mary II who was two years younger than Sarah) and Anne (the future Queen Anne who was five years younger than Sarah). Sarah first became acquainted with the royal sisters in 1671 but became closer friends with Anne after she was appointed maid of honor to Anneâs stepmother. Sarah later claimed that their five-year age difference did not discourage Anne and Sarah from playing together and that even then Anne expressed âa particular fondnessâ for her. Sarah would remain an intimate of Anne until 1711 when Sarah and her husband John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough were dismissed from court.\n\nIn late 1675, 15-year-old Sarah met 25-year-old John Churchill, an upcoming military leader who fell in love with her. In 1663, John Churchillâs fifteen-year-old sister Arabella Churchill had been sent to court to be a maid of honor to Anne Hyde, Duchess of York. Arabella captured the eye James, Duke of York (the future King James II) and by 1665, she was his mistress. The Churchill family was firmly loyal to the royal household, and their feeling about Arabellaâs position as a royal mistress seems to have been âa joyful surprise that so plain a girl had attained such high preferment.â\n\nJohn Churchill, who had previously been a lover of King Charles IIâs mistress, Barbara Palmer, Duchess of Cleveland, had little to offer financially as his familyâs estates were deeply in debt. Johnâs father, Sir Winston Churchill was anxious to restore the familyâs fortune. In 1677, Catherine Sedley, because of her familyâs wealth, was considered a marriage prospect for John Churchill by his parents. John hoped to marry Catherine Sedley and then take Sarah as a mistress in place of Barbara Palmer, Duchess of Cleveland, who had recently departed for France. However, surviving letters from Sarah to John show her unwillingness to become his mistress. Catherine Sedley later became a mistress of the future King James II and bore him three children.\n\nAfter the death of her surviving brother Ralph in 1677 and then the death of her sister Barbara in 1678, Sarah and her elder sister Frances became co-heirs of the Jennings estates in Hertfordshire and Kent and Sarahâs financial situation improved. John decided he would marry Sarah but both their families disapproved of the marriage. Sometime during the winter of 1677 â 1678, Sarah Jennings and John Churchill secretly married. Their marriage was announced only to Maria Beatrice of Modena, then Duchess of York, and a small circle of friends so that Sarah could keep her court position as Maria Beatriceâs maid of honor. When Sarah became pregnant, their marriage was announced publicly on October 1, 1678, and she retired from the court to give birth to her first child Harriet who died in infancy.\n\nSarah and her husband John had seven children. Their children and grandchildren married into the British aristocracy. Among their more famous descendants are British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill and Diana, Princess of Wales, and of course her son William, a future King of the United Kingdom.\n\nHarriet Churchill (born and died 1679), died in infancy\n\nHenrietta Churchill, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough in her own right (1681 â 1733), married Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin, had two sons and three daughters\n\nAnne Churchill (1683 â 1716), married Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland, had three sons and two daughters, their son Charles became 3rd Duke of Marlborough upon the death of his aunt Henrietta Churchill, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough; their son John is the ancestor of the Earls Spencer and therefore of Diana, Princess of Wales\n\nJohn Churchill, Marquess of Blandford (1686 â 1703), died of smallpox at age 17, the dukedom passed to his eldest sister Henrietta after their fatherâs death in 1722\n\nElizabeth Churchill (1687 â 1714), married Scroop Egerton, 4th Earl of Bridgewater, had one son and one daughter\n\nMary Churchill (1689 â 1751), married John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, had three sons and two daughters\n\nCharles Churchill (1690 â 1692), died in infancy\n\nWhen Sarahâs third daughter was born in February 1683, Anne accepted an invitation to be her godmother, and the child was named after Anne. Later in 1683, when Anne married Prince George of Denmark, Sarah was appointed a Lady of the Bedchamber. It was during the 1680s that Anne and Sarah became quite close and Anne was quite upset during the periods Sarah was not at court. While they were apart, they wrote to each other, eventually using the pen names Mrs. Morley (Anne) and Mrs. Freeman (Sarah). The question of whether Anne was sexually attracted to Sarah is often raised. While there have been rumors of sexual relationships, as depicted in the 2018 film The Favourite, between both Queen Anne and Sarah, and Queen Anne and Abigail Masham, Sarahâs first cousin and her replacement as Anneâs favorite, most historians and biographers reject this idea.\n\nUpon the death of King Charles II in 1685, his brother succeeded him as King James II. Between 1675 and 1684, Maria Beatrice, James IIâs second wife, had ten pregnancies and gave birth to five live children, all of whom died young. On June 10, 1688, Maria Beatrice gave birth to a Catholic heir to the throne, James Francis Edward, later known as the Old Pretender. Rumors soon swirled that Maria Beatrice had had a stillbirth and the dead baby was replaced with one smuggled into her bed via a warming-pan even though many had witnessed the birth including James IIâs younger daughter Anne. Fearful of a return to Catholicism, some members of Parliament began what is called the Glorious Revolution and King James II was overthrown and succession rights for his son James Francis Edward were denied. Parliament invited James IIsâ elder daughter Mary and her husband and first cousin William III, Prince of Orange to reign jointly as King William III and Queen Mary II.\n\nJohn Churchill had been created Lord Churchill of Eyemouth by King Charles II in 1682 and Sarah became Lady Churchill. King James II created John Baron Churchill of Sandridge, in 1685, and Sarah was raised to Baroness Churchill. When William III and Mary II created John the Earl of Marlborough in 1689, Sarah became the Countess of Marlborough.\n\nIn January 1692, suspecting that John Churchill was secretly conspiring with the Jacobites, the supporters of the deposed James II, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices. In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace and refused her sister Maryâs request to dismiss Sarah from her household. Instead, Sarah was dismissed from the household by the Lord Chamberlain. Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House, the home of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset. As a result, Anne was stripped of her guard of honor, courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and government officials were instructed to ignore her.\n\nAnneâs obstetrical history is tragic. She had 17 pregnancies with only five children being born alive. Two died on the day of their birth, two died at less than two years old within six days of each from smallpox, and one died at age 11. On April 17, 1692, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes. Her sister visited her, but instead of offering comfort, Mary berated Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again. On December 28, 1694, the childless Queen Mary II died of smallpox. Following, the death of his wife Mary II, William III restored Anneâs honors, as she was now next in line to the throne, and provided her with apartments at St. Jamesâs Palace. He also restored John Churchill to all his offices and honors and exonerated him from any past accusations. However, fearing Sarahâs powerful influence, William kept Anne out of government affairs, and he did not make her regent in his absences although she was now his heir presumptive.\n\nOn March 8, 1702, King William III died after a fall from his horse, and his sister-in-law and first cousin succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. Shortly after she acceded to the throne, Queen Anne created John Churchill the 1st Duke of Marlborough, and granted him the subsidiary title Marquess of Blandford. During Queen Anneâs reign, John Churchill served Anne as a general in the War of the Spanish Succession. Anne had the spectacular Blenheim Palace built for John Churchill in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, England as a reward from a grateful nation for the dukeâs military victories against the French and Bavarians during the War of the Spanish Succession, culminating in the 1704 Battle of Blenheim.\n\nQueen Anne named Sarah Mistress of the Robes, the highest office in the royal court that could be held by a woman, Groom of the Stole, Keeper of the Privy Purse, and Ranger of Windsor Great Park. She was the first of only two women ever to be Keeper of the Privy Purse and the only woman ever to be Ranger of Windsor Great Park. Sarah exerted great influence on Queen Anne and had control over most of Anneâs existence, from her finances to the people admitted to the royal presence. However, the relationship between Sarah and Anne became increasingly strained.\n\nAbigail Hill, a first cousin of Sarah, was forced to work as a servant because of her familyâs poor financial situation. Sarah took Abigail into her household, where, according to Sarah, âshe lived with me and my children, and I treated her with as great kindness as if she had been my sister.â In 1704, through Sarahâs influence, Abigail received an appointment in Queen Anneâs household as a Woman of the Bedchamber. While Sarah was assertive and outspoken, Abigail was understated and meek. During Sarahâs frequent absences from court, Abigail and Anne grew close. Abigail was not only happy to show Queen Anne the kindness and consideration that Anne needed and never pressured Anne about politics. In addition, Abigailâs opinions on church and political matters, unlike her cousin Sarahâs, were similar to Queen Anneâs. In 1707, Queen Anne was present at Abigailâs secret wedding to Samuel Masham, a Groom of the Bedchamber to Anneâs husband Prince George. Sarah had no idea about either Abigailâs marriage or the friendship that had developed between Queen Anne and Abigail. She became enraged and jealous and unsuccessfully attempted to force Queen Anne to dismiss Abigail.\n\nSarah was further angered when Abigail moved into rooms at Kensington Palace that Sarah considered her own although she rarely used them. The fondness Queen Anne showed for Abigail and the refusal to dismiss her so angered Sarah that she implied without evidence that a sexual affair was taking place between the two women. When Queen Anneâs husband Prince George died in 1708, Sarah was the only one who refused to wear suitable mourning clothes. In October 1709, Queen Anne wrote to Sarahâs husband asking that his wife âleave off teasing & tormenting me & behave herself with the decency she ought both to her friend and Queenâ.\n\nOn April 6, 1710, Queen Anne and Sarah saw each other for the last time. Sarah asked Anne why their friendship was at an end. Anne kept repeating âI shall make no answer to anything you sayâ and âYou may put it in writingâ. After Sarah told her husband what had happened, John realized Anne intended to dismiss both of them. He begged Anne to let them keep their positions for nine months until his military campaign ended. Queen Anne told him that her honor required that Sarah resign immediately. In January 1711, Sarah lost her positions of Mistress of the Robes and Groom of the Stole and was replaced by Elizabeth Seymour, Duchess of Somerset. In December 1711, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough was dismissed as Captain-General of the British Army. Along with her position of Lady of the Bedchamber, Abigail Masham was made Keeper of the Privy Purse and remained Queen Anneâs favorite until Anneâs death in 1714.\n\nIn disgrace, Sarah and John left England and traveled in Europe for several years. Because of his military campaigns on the European continent, John was welcomed at German courts. Queen Anne died on August 1, 1714, the same day Sarah and John returned to England. Anne was succeeded by George, Elector of Hanover, a great-grandson of King James I of England and the Protestant heir as stipulated by the Act of Settlement of 1701. The new King George I had a personal friendship with Sarah and John who had visited him frequently during their exile in Europe. Georgeâs first words to John as King of Great Britain were, âMy Lord Duke, I hope your troubles are now over.â John was restored to his old office of Captain-General of the Army.\n\nIn 1716, John suffered several strokes. His speech was impaired but he recovered enough to ride out to watch the builders at work on Blenheim Palace which had lost its funding from the Crown in 1712 and was then being completed. On June 16, 1722, 72-year-old John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough had another stroke and died at Cumberland Lodge in Windsor, England, and was initially buried at Westminster Abbey in London, England.\n\nIn 1730, Sarah commissioned a sarcophagus for her husband, herself, and their sons John Churchill, Marquess of Blandford who died of smallpox at age 17, and Charles Churchill who died at age 2. The sarcophagus, which is in the chapel at Blenheim Palace, was a collaboration between Flemish sculptor Michael Rysbrack and English architect William Kent and was constructed between 1730 and 1733. John and Sarah are depicted in Roman dress with their son John standing near his father and their son Charles with his mother. âThe large statues flanking the sarcophagus are of History with her quill and Fame with her trumpet and the sarcophagus itself crushes the last enemy of all, Envy.â (From a photo taken by this author of an informational display at the chapel at Blenheim Palace.)\n\nSarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough survived her husband by twenty-two years, dying on October 18, 1744, aged 84, at Marlborough House in London, England. Following Sarahâs instructions, Johnâs remains were transferred from Westminster Abbey to the chapel at Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, England where he was interred with Sarah.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Louise was educated at home with her siblings and developed a strong interest in the arts. In 1863, Queen Victoria permitted Louise to enroll at The National Art Training School, to pursue her interests and she became a very skilled painter and sculptor. Later in life, she sculpted a statue of Queen Victoria which stands today in the grounds of Kensington Palace.\n\nFor more information on Princess Louise, see Unofficial Royalty: Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll\n\nLorneâs Early Life\n\nJohn George Edward Henry Douglas Sutherland Campbell was born on August 6, 1845, in London, England. He was the eldest son of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, Head of the Highland Clan of the Campbells, and Lady Elizabeth Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the eldest child of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland. At the time of his birth, he was styled, by courtesy, Earl of Campbell. Less than two years later, his father succeeded his father as Duke of Argyll, and he was then styled Marquess of Lorne. He became the 9th Duke of Argyll upon his fatherâs death in 1900.\n\nLorne attended Edinburgh Academy, Eton College, the University of St. Andrews, and Trinity College, Cambridge. He also studied at the National Art Training School. Lorne served in the House of Commons, representing Argyllshire, Scotland from1868 â 1878 and Manchester South, England from 1895 â 1900, when he succeeded to the Dukedom of Argyll and became a member of the House of Lords. Lorne and Louise spent five years in Canada when Lorne served as Governor-General of Canada from 1878 â 1883.\n\nFor more information, see Unofficial Royalty: John Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll\n\nThe Engagement\n\nSeveral foreign princes were put forward as possible husbands for Louise, including the future King Frederik VIII of Denmark, Prince Albert of Prussia, and Willem, Prince of Orange, son of King Willem III of the Netherlands who ultimately predeceased his father. However, none of these princes was agreeable to Queen Victoria, and Louise herself wanted nothing to do with marriage to a prince. Queen Victoria began to pursue the idea that she could have a British son-in-law and she started a search through the noble houses and came upon the Scottish John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne and heir to the Dukedom of Argyll.\n\nQueen Victoria met with Lorneâs father George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll about a possible marriage between their children. The duke tried to persuade Queen Victoria that at the present time, it was not a good idea. He wanted his son to marry a bit later so he could experience the life his privileged position could offer. However, the Duke of Argyll felt that any decision about marriage should be solely his sonâs decision. When Queen Victoria told Louise about her meeting, she showed little interest and during 1870, several other peers and peersâ sons were paraded before Louise. Lorne felt that matters were unsettled between him and Louise and he refused to consider another possible marriage until either he or Louise definitely ended the possibility of marriage.\n\nMeanwhile, Louise had been asking her mother if she could attend more social occasions and Queen Victoria allowed Louise to attend one of Prime Minister William Gladstoneâs famous breakfast parties. By chance, Lorne was also in attendance. In the high society atmosphere and away from her mother, Louise was enchanted by the sophisticated Lorne. In 1870, Louise found herself falling in love with Lorne and he proposed to her during a walk at Balmoral, Queen Victoriaâs Scottish estate, on October 3, 1870.\n\nAlthough the British public loved the idea of a princess marrying a British subject, the marriage was met with much opposition in the royal family, as Lorne was not royal. There had been no marriage between a daughter of a sovereign and a British subject since 1515, when Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, married King Henry VIIIâs sister Mary Tudor, daughter of King Henry VII. The Prince of Wales found it appalling that his sister should marry below her class. However, despite protests from some of Louiseâs siblings as well as the Prussian court, Queen Victoria saw the marriage as an opportunity to âinfuse new and healthy bloodâ into the royal family. The Queen offered Lorne a peerage, something she would do many times over the years, with the intent of resolving issues of precedence and giving him a rank closer to that of his wife. Lorne refused for several reasons â he would one day inherit the Argyll dukedom, and he did not want to give up his place in the House of Commons.\n\nWedding Site\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nSt. Georgeâs Chapel at Windsor Castle in Windsor, England was begun in 1475 by King Edward IV and completed by King Henry VIII in 1528. It is a separate building located in the Lower Ward of Windsor Castle. The chapel seats about 800 people and has been the location of many royal ceremonies, weddings, funerals, and burials. Members of the Order of the Garter meet at Windsor Castle every June for the annual Garter Service which is held at St. Georgeâs Chapel.\n\nThere had been no royal weddings at St. Georgeâs Chapel until 1863 when Queen Victoriaâs eldest son, the future King Edward VII, married Princess Alexandra of Denmark. Four more of Queen Victoriaâs children were married there and it has become a popular site for royal weddings.\n\nWedding Guests\n\nRoyal Guests\n\nQueen Victoria, mother of the bride\n\nThe Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII, brother of the bride\n\nThe Princess of Wales, born Princess Alexandra of Denmark, sister-in-law of the bride\n\nCrown Princess Victoria of Prussia, The Princess Royal, sister of the bride\n\nCrown Prince Friedrich of Prussia, the future Friedrich III, German Emperor, brother-in-law of the bride\n\nPrince Arthur, brother of the bride\n\nPrince Leopold, brother of the bride\n\nPrincess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein (Princess Helena), sister of the bride\n\nPrince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, brother-in-law of the bride\n\nPrincess Beatrice, sister of the bride\n\nPrince Albert Victor of Wales, nephew of the bride\n\nPrince George of Wales, the future King George V, nephew of the bride\n\nPrince George, 2nd Duke of Cambridge, maternal first cousin once removed of the bride\n\nDuchess of Cambridge, great-aunt of the bride, born Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel\n\nErnst II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, paternal uncle of the bride\n\nPrince Philippe of Belgium, Count of Flanders, paternal and maternal first cousin once removed of the bride\n\nPrince Francis of Teck and his wife, born Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, maternal first cousin once removed of the bride\n\nPrince Edward of Saxe-Weimar\n\nMaharajah Duleep Singh and his wife Maharani Bamba\n\nPrince Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (Count of Gleichen), nephew of Queen Victoria via her half-sister Feodora of Leiningen, and his morganatic wife Laura Seymour, Countess of Gleichen\n\nThe Queenâs Household\n\nAnne Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland â Mistress of the Robes\n\nSusanna Innes-Ker, Duchess of Roxburghe â Lady of the Bedchamber in Waiting\n\nThe Honorable Lucy Kerr â Maid of Honor in Waiting\n\nThe Honorable Horatia Stopford â Maid of Honor in Waiting\n\nThe Honorable Mrs. Alexander Gordon â Bedchamber Woman in Waiting\n\nJohn Ponsonby, 5th Earl of Bessborough â Lord Steward\n\nJohn Townshend, 3rd Viscount Sydney â Lord Chamberlain\n\nGeorge Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury â Master of the Horse\n\nMajor-General Sir Thomas Biddulph â Keeper of the Privy Purse\n\nColonel Henry Ponsonby â Private Secretary\n\nGeorge Warren, 2nd Baron de Tabley â Treasurer of the Household\n\nLord Otho Fitzgerald â Comptroller of the Household\n\nValentine Browne, Viscount Castlerosse â Vice Chamberlain\n\nGeneral George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan â Gold Stick in Waiting\n\nGeorge Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby â Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms\n\nWilliam Beauclerk, 10th Duke of St. Albans â Captain of the Yeoman of the Guard\n\nRichard Boyle, 9th Earl of Cork â Master of the Buckhounds\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Sir John Cowell â Master of the Household\n\nFrederick Methuen, 2nd Baron Methuen â Lord in Waiting\n\nMajor-General Sir Francis Seymour â Baronet, Groom in Waiting\n\nLord Alfred Paget â Clerk Marshal\n\nColonel C.

Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill, Lady of the Bedchamber to the Queen, was in attendance on Princess Louise.\n\nThere were eight bridesmaids, all unmarried daughters of Dukes, Marquesses, or Earls.\n\nLady Mary Butler, daughter of John Butler, 2nd Marquess of Ormonde, married The Honorable William Henry Fitzwilliam\n\nLady Elizabeth Campbell, sister of the groom, daughter of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, married Lt.-Col. Edward Harrison Clough-Taylor\n\nLady Mary Cecil, daughter of James Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury, married Alan Stewart, 10th Earl of Galloway\n\nLady Alice FitzGerald, daughter of Charles FitzGerald, 4th Duke of Leinster, married Sir Charles John Oswald FitzGerald\n\nLady Grace Gordon, daughter of Charles Gordon, 10th Marquess of Huntly, married Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale\n\nLady Florence Gordon-Lennox, daughter of Charles Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond, unmarried\n\nLady Florence Montagu, daughter of John Montagu, 7th Earl of Sandwich, married Alfred Charles Duncombe\n\nLady Constance Seymour, daughter of Francis Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford, married Frederick St John Newdigate Barne\n\nThe supporters for the bridegroom were Henry Percy, Earl Percy and Lord Ronald Sutherland-Leveson-Gower. Henry Percy was styled Earl Percy, one of the subsidiary titles of his father Algernon Percy, 6th Duke of Northumberland. He was the groomâs brother-in-law, the husband of the groomâs eldest sister, and later was the 7th Duke of Northumberland. Lord Ronald was the youngest of the four sons and the tenth of the eleven children of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland. His eldest sister was the groomâs mother and so Lord Ronald was the groomâs maternal uncle. He was the same age as the groom so he was more a friend than an uncle.\n\nWedding Attire\n\nLouise wore a white silk wedding gown with deep flounces of flower-strewn Honiton lace. The dress was trimmed with orange blossoms, white heather, and myrtle and had a train that corresponded with the rest of the dress. On her head, Louise wore a wreath of orange blossoms and myrtle with a short wedding veil of Honiton lace that she designed herself. Her veil was held in place by two of the three diamond daisy brooches given to her by her three youngest siblings Prince Arthur, Prince Leopold, and Princess Beatrice. The diamond daisy brooches are now the property of Princess Michael of Kent, whose husband had been willed them from his mother Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. Princess Louise liked her great-nephew Prince George, Duke of Kent and his wife Princess Marina. When Louise died in 1939, she left several pieces of jewelry to Marina including the diamond daisy brooches. You can see and read more about the daisy brooches here: Artemisiaâs Royal Jewels: Focus onâ¦ Kent Jewels: The Argyll Daisy Brooches.\n\nLouise received a beautiful bracelet from her future husband. The center, with a sapphire mounted with diamonds and pearls and a pearl drop, could be worn as a pendant ornament. Princess Louise wore this pendant on a diamond necklace on her wedding day, and it can be seen in her wedding photographs. She also wore an emerald bracelet given to her by the Prince and Princess of Wales and a diamond bracelet that had been given to her maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Kent, born Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, by the people of Windsor.\n\nWhile Lorneâs male kinsmen wore kilts of the Campbell tartan, he wore the uniform of the Royal Argyllshire Artillery Volunteers.\n\nThe bridesmaidsâ dresses were of white glacÃ©-silk, trimmed with satin, with a tunic of gossamer and fringe, decorated with cerise roses, white heather, and sand ivy. On their heads, they wore corresponding floral wreaths. Each of the bridesmaids wore a locket made from cristal de roche, richly decorated with blue and white enamel. In the center of the locket was a purple scroll inscribed with âLouise 1871â surrounded by a wreath of roses and forget-me-nots. The loop was formed of a Princessâ coronet studded with emeralds and rubies attached to a true loverâs knot of turquoise enamel suspended from a gold chain.\n\nWedding\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nGuests arrived by a special train from London and were met at the Windsor train station by carriages which took them to the entrance of St. Georgeâs Chapel near Wolsey Chapel, now known as the Albert Memorial Chapel, and they were then shown to their seats. The groomâs parents, the Duke and Duchess of Argyll, and other close relatives of the groom arrived from Windsor Castle and were taken to their seats near the altar. Next, the clergy participating in the wedding ceremony took their places at the altar.\n\nMembers of the British royal family and other royalty assembled in the Green Drawing Room of Windsor Castle. At twelve noon, the royalty along with their attendants were taken by carriages to the south entrance of St. Georgeâs Chapel. They proceeded up the nave to their seats in the choir while The Festal March composed especially for Princess Louiseâs wedding by the St. Georgeâs Chapel organist George Elvey was played on the organ.\n\nThe bridegroom arrived from Windsor Castle with his two supporters and was shown into the Bray Chapel. After all the royalty was seated, Lorne was escorted to his place near the altar, accompanied by his two supporters. As he proceeded to his place, the March from George Fredrich Handelâs oratorio Joseph was played on the organ. Meanwhile, the bridesmaids assembled at the West Door to St. Georgeâs Chapel where they waited in a room for the arrival of the bride.\n\nAt 12:15 PM, Princess Louise, accompanied by her supporters, her mother Queen Victoria, her brother the Prince of Wales, and her paternal uncle Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, along with their respective attendants, left Windsor Castle in carriages for the short ride to the West Door of St. Georgeâs Chapel. The bridal procession formed at the West Door and proceeded through the nave to the choir while Felix Mendelssohnâs March from Athalie was played on the organ. The bride was supported by Queen Victoria on her right and the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha on the left.\n\nQueen Victoria, who gave her daughter away, was seated near the bride as were the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The wedding ceremony was performed by John Jackson, Bishop of London in the absence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. During the ceremony, the choir sang two psalms composed by George Elvey and a chorus by Ludwig von Beethoven.\n\nAt the conclusion of the wedding ceremony, a royal salute was fired. The newlyweds and the royalty left St. Georgeâs Chapel via the West Door as the organ played the March from Occasional Oratorio by George Friedrich Handel.\n\nPost-Wedding\n\nUpon returning to Windsor Castle, the marriage registry was signed by the bride and groom, Queen Victoria, and other royalty and members of the government in the White Drawing Room. A private luncheon was served to the royalty in the Oak Room while a buffet luncheon for the other guests was served in the Waterloo Gallery.\n\nThe wedding cake was quite spectacular. It stood five feet high and weighed over 225 pounds. The cake had four tiers and was shaped like a tower. Atop the cake was a classical female figure. Cherubs, flowers, vases, Greek Corinthian columns, and other figures decorated the cake which was finished with fine white icing. Queen Victoriaâs chief confectioner Samuel Ponder worked on the cake for three months.\n\nAt 3:30 PM, a special train left Windsor, taking the guests back to London. The newlyweds left Windsor Castle at 4:00 PM, attended by Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill, a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Victoria, and Colonel George Conyngham, Earl of Mount-Charles, Equerry in Waiting to Queen Victoria, for a four-day honeymoon at Claremont House in Esher in Surrey, England.\n\nLater in the evening, a banquet was held in the Waterloo Chamber and then an evening party was held in St. Georgeâs Hall.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

The title first appeared in the 1300s, but it was not until 1611 that the title became commonly used. In 1611, King James I issued Letters Patent granting Baronetcies to 200 men. In return, they were required to pay for the upkeep of 30 soldiers for three years. Eight years later, he created the Baronetage of Ireland. In 1625, King Charles I created the Baronetage of Nova Scotia, to raise funds and support for the colonization of the now Canadian province. After failing to reach his desired 150 Scottish grantees, he allowed English and Irish men to be created Baronets in Nova Scotia as well. Upon the Act of Union 1707, new baronets were created in the Baronetage of Great Britain (and since 1801, the Baronetage of the United Kingdom).\n\nBaronets (and Baronetesses in their own right) hold precedence following all members of the peerage, but above all knighthoods other than the Order of the Garter and the Order of the Thistle. The title traditionally descends to male heirs, but sometimes special remainder allows them to pass to daughters and their male heirs; sons-in-law; and sometimes to whoever holds ownership of the property or estate.\n\nBaronetesses in their own right\n\nThere have been only four women who were Baronetesses in their own right. Of them, three were inherited titles, while only one was created a Baronetess in her own right.\n\nDame Maureen âDaisyâ Moore Dunbar, 8th Baronetess (of Hempriggs) â 1906-1997 â Daisy inherited the Baronetcy in 1963, following the death of a second cousin.\n\nDame Mary Witham Bolles, 1st Baronetess (of Osberton) â 1579-1662 â Mary is the only woman created a Baronetess in her own right. The baronetcy was inherited by her grandson, Sir William Jopson, 2nd Baronet.\n\nDame Eleanor âNoraâ Dalyell, 10th Baronetess (of the Binns) â 1895-1972 â Nora inherited the baronetcy which was created with special remainder to âtailzie succeeding the grantee in the estateâ â the technical owner of the property and estate.\n\nDame Anne Maxwell Macdonald, 11th Baronetess (of Pollack in the County of Renfrew) â 1906-2011 â Anne was recognized as heir to her fatherâs baronetcy in 2005, 49 years after his death.\n\nKamagra Oral Jelly, in the same way as all are discount viagra cialis made with the same thing.

Approximately 242 of these baronetcies are held by members of the Peerage.\n\nThe creation of Baronetcies basically ended on December 31, 1964. Since then, only one Baronetcy has been created. In February 1991, Denis Thatcher, husband of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was granted a hereditary Baronetage. (This is also the last hereditary peerage granted to anyone other than members of the British Royal Family.)\n\nTitles and Styles\n\nBaronetcies are created with a territorial designation (ex. John Smith, Baronet Smith of London), and usually include the surname. These territorial designations are not usually used in casual reference, unless to differentiate several baronets with the same surname (example: Baronet Smith of London, Baronet Smith of Manchester, etc). Holders are entitled to Sir or Dame before their name, and the post-honorific of âBtâ or âBtssâ following their name.\n\nA Baronet is styled Sir (first name) (surname), Bt, and is addressed as Sir (first name).\n\nA Baronetess, in her own right, is styled Dame (first name) (surname), Btss, and is addressed as Dame (first name).\n\nA wife of a Baronet is not styled or addressed as a Baronetess. Instead, they are styled and addressed as Lady (surname).\n\nChildren of a Baronet are not accorded any courtesy titles or styles.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Despite being the lowest rank, it is perhaps the oldest title. The rank was introduced by William I to recognize those who had pledged their loyalty to him under the feudal system. With this came the obligation to provide troops and support for the army, and the right (and often obligation) to attend the Kingâs Council They were charged with advising and supporting the King, and in return received protection from outside forces. In the mid-1200s, Barons started to be created by writ â personally summoned by the King based on their accomplishments or character, and not merely because of their ownership of land. By 1388, this was done via Letters Patent, and the once feudal claims to the title had fully shifted from territorial to personal. Additional degrees of peerage were soon added and they all become collectively known as the Peerage. The female version of the title is Baroness.\n\nIn the Peerage of Ireland, the title of Baron was first created shortly after the Norman Invasion of Ireland in 1169. One of the earliest was Baron Athenry, believed to have been created in 1172 for a member of the de Birmingham family. The title became extinct in 1799.\n\nThe Premier Baron in England is the Baron de Ros. In 1264, Robert de Ros was summoned to Parliament, and it was considered that the barony was created by writ that year. It was later deemed to have been granted to his son, William de Ros, in 1288, but with precedence dating back to December 1264. Unlike many titles within the peerage, this barony passes down to heirs-general, meaning it can pass to daughters if there are no living sons. In that case, if there is more than one daughter, all of them hold an equal claim to the title and the title goes into abeyance until such time as there is only one heir (or the Sovereign declares a sole heir). The current holder is Peter Trevor Maxwell, 27th Baron de Ros.\n\nThe last non-royal hereditary barony created was Baron Margadale, created on January 1, 1965 for the politician John Granville Morrison. Today the title is held by his grandson, Alastair John Morrison, 3rd Baron Margadale. The first Baron was also the father of The Hon. Dame Mary Anne Morrison, who has served as Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth II since 1960, and is considered to be one of The Queenâs closest friends and confidantes.\n\nSince that time, the only hereditary baronies created have been for members of the Royal Family:\n\nPrince Andrew â created Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh upon his marriage in 1986\n\nPrince William â created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus upon his marriage in 2011\n\nPrince Harry â created Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel upon his marriage in 2018\n\nThe Life Peerages Act 1958 established the creation of non-hereditary peerages, granted for the holderâs lifetime only. These life peerages have all been baronies. Since that time, only 47 hereditary baronies have been created, while there have been over 1300 life baronies created (as of January 2019). The first of these was created on August 1, 1958, when William Jocelyn Ian Fraser was created Baron Fraser of Lonsdale.\n\nLord of Parliament\n\nWhile the title of Baron is the 5th rank in the peerages of England, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, it does not exist in the Peerage of Scotland. Instead, the 5th rank is Lord of Parliament. Dating back to the 1100s, the basis for the title is very similar to the history of the Barons in England. Often landowners who provided support and troops, they became part of the Scottish parliament. Since the Act of Union 1707, which joined England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain (and consolidated the two parliaments into one), no new Lords of Parliament have been created. Instead, they are granted the title of Baron.
