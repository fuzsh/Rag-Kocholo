Apart from Sir John WheelerBennett’s weighty official life, there have been no other full-length biographical studies of the King during the three decades since his death. In these circumstances, it seemed appropriate to take a comprehensive and fresh look at the life and reign of George VI and to examine, in particular, some of the less comfortable aspects of his personality and career. I have tried throughout to avoid the sycophancy that so often distorts royal biography, and to conduct an honest and unprejudiced appraisal of a man whose ultimate national and international reputation was achieved at the cost of consistent self-sacrifice in the name of duty, and after a lengthy struggle to overcome various personal disabilities. As well as extracting information from printed letters and speeches, works of autobiography, biography and historical analysis, I have examined a mass of contemporary newspapers and journals, both British and American, in order to see George VI from as many angles as possible. In writing the book I have received a great deal of encouragement and support from Alan Brooke and Jennie Davies at Michael Joseph. I have also been fortunate in the promptness and skills of my typist Jill Fletcher, and in the supplementary secretarial assistance offered by my mother, aided by my father. Edda Tasiemka and her staff of the Hans Tasiemka Archives have efficiently provided me with access to much contemporary archival material. I am grateful, too, for the facilities offered by a number of national and public libraries and their staff. My friend Bruce Hunter, of David Higham’s, has been, as usual, a source of invaluable advice and support, and I take great pleasure in dedicating this book to him.

This has not, however, simply been the function of the eliding of his reputation into some half-remembered Golden Age comprising the 26 years of his reign, heroic though many of them were. Rather it represents something more substantial and tangible, though undoubtedly nostalgia and the swirling mists of popular mythology play their parts. The public’s interest in this shy, troubled, earnest and reliable man has recently been reawakened and, in many cases, vastly increased by the extraordinary success of the 2010 film The King’s Speech. Addressing head-on the apparently crippling problem of the serious speech impediment that had dogged the young Prince Albert, Duke of York, for most of his life, the film concentrated upon his sometimes explosive interaction with the unorthodox speech therapist Lionel Logue. Undermined and scorned by his tyrannical father George V and kept at arm’s length by his cold mother Queen Mary, Prince Albert’s profound lack of self-confidence not merely caused him to stammer so badly in public that he became incoherent, but also often tipped him into inarticulate and unpredictable rages. In The King’s Speech, however, salvation comes not only through the skilful and therapeutic treatment he receives with Lionel Logue but also due to the loving commonsense of his wife, the former Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. The film is, therefore, essentially about the triumph of honesty and goodness and understanding over inadequacy and dysfunction. In that sense, it is a parable of the potency of kindness and honesty in the face of despair, humiliation, ignorance and seemingly xiii\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: JZP IBBK056-PRE\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 31, 2012\n\n9:38\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\noverwhelming odds. Indeed, the battle that was waged and eventually won by Prince Albert against his demons runs parallel to the epic struggle of Britain and its Empire in the face of the hideous threat of invasion and conquest by Nazi Germany. Interestingly, the phenomenal and unexpected critical and boxoffice success of The King’s Speech provoked an extremely rare attack on George VI’s posthumous reputation. Perhaps, in a desperate attempt to damage the film’s prospect of sweeping the board at the forthcoming Oscar awards, early in 2011 it was alleged that in 1939 the King had written to the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, suggesting that perhaps a halt should be put to the process of admitting Jewish refugees to the British Mandate of Palestine. Clearly, this was aimed at smearing the film by associating it with apparent royal anti-Semitism. Fortunately, a number of British historians were able to remind the public of the Chamberlain government’s ambivalence over the issue of Jewish emigration to Palestine at a time when it hoped to make the recent Munich Agreement with Hitler stick, and when it was anxious not to provoke the Arab world and put future oil supplies at risk. It, thus, seemed evident that the relatively inexperienced King had merely been following up what he understood to be the government’s policy of the moment. Putting aside such recent carping, what were the innate, and perhaps the rapidly acquired, qualities that enabled King George VI to play such a creative role in the two great titanic struggles of his later life – the battle to overcome his speech impediment and the world conflict with Nazi Germany and its allies? Also, how far has our understanding of the man changed in the 60 years since his death? To begin with, George VI seems almost impossibly dutiful, hard working and ordinary – ridiculous though that last word might seem when applied to one of Queen Victoria’s great-grandsons and the King-Emperor of a Commonwealth and Empire that comprised nearly one-third of humanity. But the standards he set in both his public and his private life were staggeringly high and seem almost millennia away from the deportment of some of today’s members of the House of Windsor. There is, of course, one clear exception to this judgment: Queen Elizabeth II is nothing if not her father’s daughter, though even he xiv\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: JZP IBBK056-PRE\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 31, 2012\n\n9:38\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nmight have drawn the line at the expending so much enthusiasm and attention upon race horses. But if the essence of the late King lived on in any earthly form after 1952, it was not in the shape of his wilful, flighty, merry and sad second daughter Princess Margaret Rose – much though he loved, and perhaps envied, her vivacity and enthusiasm for life – but in the personality of his adored, serious, somewhat inhibited and deeply committed eldest child. Who else in the royal family could, at the age of 21, have announced in a worldwide radio broadcast that: ‘I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great Imperial Commonwealth to which we all belong’. The Empire, in all its pomp, is now gone for good, even though a scattering of small dependant territories remain as reminders of those increasingly distant days of superpower status. The Commonwealth, however, is very much still with us, despite its capacity for papering over the chronic and sometimes ugly cracks in its structure caused by well-publicised cases of corruption and human rights’ abuse in some member states. It was George VI who witnessed, somewhat helplessly, the beginning of this huge transformation, fretting over the loss of ‘Emperor of India’ from the royal style and titles, concerned as to the implications of republican status requested by Nehru’s India in 1949, anxious to see the conflicts in territories like Cyprus, Kenya, Malaya, even Egypt, speedily resolved. At his death, the new Queen eagerly and confidently assumed the title Head of the Commonwealth and proceeded to do her utmost to keep the best traditions of the organisation alive. George VI presided over other major national transformations, from the introduction of the welfare state to the beginning of the end of Britain’s capacity to ‘go it alone’ in foreign policy, from the nationalisation of key parts of British industry and the British economy to the post-war decline in deference and the stifling effects of inhibition – both in public and private, from the waning of church attendance to the rapid growth of the modern media, from the homogeneity of the British population to the start of mass immigration and settlement. Among George VI’s best qualities was his capacity to adapt to his dramatically changed circumstances after 1936 and to absorb what xv\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: JZP IBBK056-PRE\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 31, 2012\n\n9:38\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nwas required of him as monarch. No great scholar or bookworm in his early life, he proved a very quick learner indeed after his accession to the throne. He also understood, and was able to judge to a fine degree, the limitations of his role and influence as a constitutional monarch. Not for him rhetorical flights and vivid verbal imagery addressing and swaying huge audiences, or demanding that he got his own way over policy, or obstructing, either overtly or covertly, developments of which he disapproved. This was not his function or his duty, and, in any event, between 1940 and 1945 he had a Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who could do all of that and often did. Though born into the unimaginable wealth of the British royal family and raised in palaces, George VI projected an entirely genuine image of ordinariness. This was in part because, indifferently educated and at least initially fundamentally unsure of his standing, he was disinclined and ill-equipped to pose as a Renaissance Prince or to astound the world with his intellectual brilliance. Instead, like the vast majority of his subjects he preferred musical comedy to opera and undemanding light reading to Tolstoy or Proust. After the trauma of his brother’s abdication in 1936, the media, especially in Britain, was quick to present a cosy, reassuring image of the new royal family: a monogamous and loving couple at its head, with their two adored, demure and wholesome daughters, together in the garden, or perhaps gathered round a roaring sitting room fire while reading, chatting, stroking a dog and doing what millions of others might well be doing in countless semi-detached houses of country cottages. Perhaps, the father thus portrayed might in a while bring his stamp collection up to date. Might the mother be knitting? How kindly and nice the two daughters looked. The temptation to identify with what appeared, at first sight anyway, to be merely another comfortable, happy and unpretentious suburban nuclear family was irresistible. The paradox is that this much-peddled image was essentially accurate. Despite his royal pedigree, despite her aristocratic birth, both King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, were almost certainly more comfortable within a calm, everyday domestic setting rather than when formally opening Parliament, or taking the salute at the trooping of the colour, or touring any part of Britain’s far-flung Empire-Commonwealth waving to huge, heaving crowds. xvi\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: JZP IBBK056-PRE\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 31, 2012\n\n9:38\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThese qualities of ordinariness, hard work and modesty were to stand George VI and his family in very good stead, not only as the royal spin doctors hastened to refashion the monarchy’s image amid the ruins of the Abdication Crisis, but also as the nation and its Empire faced a triumphant Nazi Germany after the rapid collapse of France in the summer of 1940. If the British people really then considered that they were ‘standing alone’, it seemed far better to be led by a Prime Minister who exuded self-belief and who could conjure up support from past triumphs of national history, and a monarch who refused to move out of London in daytime during the Blitz and who, in the interests of national economy, took the time to paint lines inside all the baths in Buckingham Palace to show how deep to make the hot water. Nor was it forgotten amid the perils and anxieties of the Second World War that as a midshipman the future George VI had served in HMS Collingwood during the 1916 Battle of Jutland, or that Princess Elizabeth joined the ATS during World War Two becoming a driver of army trucks and knowledgeable on the subject of sparking plugs. There was also a certain symmetry in the bombing of Buckingham Palace at the same time as terraced houses in Stepney and Coventry were being pulverised. In the post-war period, George VI again showed just the right personal and constitutional touch in his dealings with the Labour government of 1945–51. Though a naturally conservative man himself, the king was determined to give the new administration, many of whose senior ministers he knew well from their roles in the wartime coalition, as much support as it needed. He even got on well with the loquacious left-winger Nye Bevan, perhaps partly because both men suffered from stammers, and he had considerable regard for the taciturn Prime Minister, Clement Attlee. In fact, the only Labour minister who aroused the King’s dislike was the pompous, booming and tactless Hugh Dalton, the son of his father George V’s much-disliked former tutor Canon Dalton. The Festival of Britain held in 1951, one year before the King’s death, was meant to be, in the words of one of its inspirations, the Labour Home Secretary Herbert Morrison, ‘the British showing themselves to each other – and to the rest of the world’. It was also a collective pat on the back for a nation, and an Empire, that xvii\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: JZP IBBK056-PRE\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 31, 2012\n\n9:38\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nhad played a bigger part than most combatants in achieving final victory in 1945. It is perhaps worth noting that the British were the only people who fought through both World Wars from beginning to end. Yet, in the words of the great historian A. J. P. Taylor, ‘[T]hey remained a peaceful and civilised people, tolerant, patient, and generous. Traditional values lost much of their force. Other values took their place. Imperial greatness was on the way out; the welfare state was on the way in. The British Empire declined; the condition of the people improved. Few now sang “Land of Hope and Glory”. Few even sang “England Arise”. England had risen all the same’. By the time of his death in February 1952, it was clear that, despite his inadequacies and shortcomings, but by playing to his strengths, both innate and acquired, King George VI, too, ‘had risen all the same’.\n\nxviii\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\n1\n\nA ROYAL, AND DEPRIVED, CHILDHOOD 1895–1908 . . . my grandfather [George V] found it so easy to find fault with anyone that what was probably a basic kindness was quite lost in his gruff exterior . . . I don’t think he really cared much for children and he had a positive mania for punctuality. The Earl of Harewood The child to whom I was most drawn was Prince Albert – Bertie – although he was not a boy who made friends easily. Intensely sensitive over his stammer he was apt to take refuge either in silence – which caused him to be thought moody – or in naughtiness. He was more often in conflict with authority than the rest of his brothers. Mabell, Countess of Airlie\n\nThe future King George VI was born in 1895 at Sandringham on the blackest day in the calendar of the Royal Family – 14 December, the anniversary of the death of Prince Albert thirty-four years earlier, and of Queen Victoria’s daughter Alice in 1878. In a more superstitious age, soothsayers would have struggled to interpret the omen. As it was, there was much consternation within the Royal Family and early, anxious attempts to propitiate the imagined wrath of Queen Victoria, who was now in her seventysixth year, and, despite her physical infirmities, a matriarchal totem of great potency. The baby’s father, the Duke of York, later to become King George V, recorded in his diary the events of the momentous day in the spare prose of the naval log: A little boy was born, weighing nearly eight lb. at 3.40 a.m. . . . Everything most satisfactory, both doing well. Sent a number of telegrams, had something to eat. Went to bed at 6.45, very tired.1\n\n1\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nAmong the telegrams was one addressed to Queen Victoria, mourning at Windsor. It read: “Darling May was safely confined of a son at 3.30 this morning both doing well. GEORGIE.” How would the old Queen respond? Early newspaper reaction to the birth met the problem head-on: the Globe believed that: Henceforth it is permissible to hope that the august lady, in whose joys and sorrows the nation claims a right to share, may find in the felicitous event of December 14, 1895, a solace for the mournful memories of December 14, 1861, and December 14, 1878.2 On 16 December the Standard weighed in with an editorial in which sound advice was presented in pompous and leaden prose: But, surely, the Fourteenth of December may, henceforth, bear its white mark. Not that the Past can ever be forgotten, not that even the sound of the joy-bells of the present hour can ever deaden our ears to the recollections of a sadder and graver note. It is the distinguishing characteristic of the higher natures, and equally of the more serious communities, never to part wholly with their reminiscences, even though these should give to existence a certain air of sombreness. But the “Too much sorrow”, on which Shakespeare comments with disapproval, is incompatible with the healthy activities either of individual or of national life; and all of us, from our beloved Sovereign downward, will, we are quite sure, hail with eagerness the new cause given us by the Duchess of York for looking on the Fourteenth of December as not by any means one of the days devoted exclusively to mourning and regret.3 Within the family, Queen Victoria’s eldest child, Victoria, the widowed mother of the German Kaiser Wilhelm II, was quick to put the best interpretation on the birth. Writing to her mother from Berlin on 17 December she said: I cannot say how much I rejoice! On the one hand I thought it rather to be regretted that the dear little Baby was born on a day of such inexpressibly sad memories to us – but on the other – it is a gift from Heaven and a very precious one – and there is something very touching in the thought – that on this darkest 2\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nA ROYAL, AND DEPRIVED, CHILDHOOD, 1895–1908\n\nday of your Life a ray of sunshine is sent in after years! and I like to look at it in this light!4 The new baby’s grandfather, the Prince of Wales, had written in similar terms to the Duke of York from Windsor on 14 December. While admitting that, “Grandmama was rather distressed that this happy event should have taken place on a darkly sad anniversary for us,” the future King Edward VII added, “but I think – as well as most of us in the family here – that it will ‘break the spell’ of this unlucky date.” The Prince of Wales followed up this letter with a second, written two days later, in which he reassured his son that, “Grandmama is not the least annoyed with you about anything, but she only regretted that the little boy was born on the fourteenth though we have all told her that it will dispel the gloom of that sad anniversary.” In order to make the best of it, the Prince of Wales, after reminding the Duke of York that the Queen “is ageing rapidly – and has always been very kind and affecte. to you”, suggested, “I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name of Albert to her.” Queen Victoria had probably already indicated the pleasure that naming the new baby Albert would give her. Indeed, it was difficult for her descendants to christen their male offspring without including Albert among the names. Thus the Prince of Wales’ first name was Albert, as had been that of his eldest son, the Duke of Clarence, who had died of typhus in 1892; the Duke of York’s fourth name was Albert, and his eldest son, later to be King Edward VIII, bore Albert as his second name. The name should, in Queen Victoria’s view, be the distinguishing mark of the lineage that had sprung from her joyful union with the Prince Consort. The Duke of York hastened to play the Albert card, and with some finesse. He wrote to the Queen, soon after the new prince’s birth, repeating the family sentiment that “his having been born on that day may be the means of making it a little less sad to you”, and then produced his trump: “Dear Grandmama, we propose with your permission to call him Albert after dear Grandpapa & we also hope that you will be his Godmother.” Queen Victoria accepted these offerings at the shrine of her dead husband with the warmth and spontaneity of the middle-European great-grandmother that she was. She replied immediately: 3\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nI cannot tell you how much pleased & gratified I have been by your dear letter [she wrote to her “Darling Georgie”]. But before I answer it let me express my joy at dear May’s doing so well & recovering so quickly. Thank God! she is, unberufen, very strong. She gets through these affairs like nothing. It is a great satisfaction to us all that it should be a second boy & I need not say how delighted I am that my great wish – viz. that the little one born on that sad anniversary shd. have the dear name of Albert – is to be realized. Most gladly do I accept being Godmother & this dear little Boy born the day when his beloved great grandfather entered on a new greater life will be especially dear to me. – I thank you lovingly for your very kind letter & will write again soon, but I must end to save the Post. Ever Your devoted Grandmama V.R.I.5 So excited was she by the birth that she confessed to the baby’s mother, “I am all impatience to see the new one,” and would dearly have liked the christening to have been held at Osborne so that she could have personally played the part of Godmother. The new prince was, however, christened at the Church of St Mary’s, Sandringham, on 17 February 1895, taking the names Albert Frederick Arthur George. Within the family he was destined always to be known as Bertie. The prospects for Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George were overwhelmingly favourable. Britain was still the greatest world power in 1895, her influence, like her Empire, far-flung and worldwide. The Royal Navy patrolled the seven seas and British exports still dominated the world’s markets. Although Britain’s commercial pre-eminence was shortly to be challenged by the rapidly growing industrial strength of Germany and the United States, and her military shortcomings cruelly exposed in the Boer War of 1899–1902, there seemed little cause for pessimism on these scores in 1895. If Britain was the centre of a global imperial structure, the Royal Family were the unquestioned leaders of British society and the only viable focal point of imperial patriotism. The republican agitation of the 1870s had died away; indeed, a few months before Prince Albert Frederick’s birth, Joseph Chamberlain, earlier a demagogic radical and republican, had taken the post of Colonial Secretary in 4\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nA ROYAL, AND DEPRIVED, CHILDHOOD, 1895–1908\n\na Unionist government dominated by the Tory party. Few in 1895 countenanced the overthrow of the British monarchy or imagined a bloody revolution that would plant the red flag amid the smoking ruins of Buckingham Palace. In all these ways the new prince’s future seemed secure, but Prince Albert Frederick’s upbringing was little short of disastrous. A combination of circumstances robbed him of the consistently loving, intelligent support and guidance which should form the basis of childhood development. In a very real sense, his was a deprived childhood. To begin with, the Duke and Duchess of York had serious failings as parents. For those who remember them fondly as King George V and Queen Mary this may be difficult to accept. George V is recalled as a bluff, kindly, plain-spoken monarch, the embodiment of good sense, a father-figure to his people; Queen Mary, upright and alert, embodied family respectability and patriotic devotion, and was an emblem of stability amid much change. All of this is true enough; it did not, however, make the Duke and Duchess of York good parents. Frances Donaldson, in her biography of Edward VIII, has even gone so far as to say that the couple “were for different reasons temperamentally unsuited to parenthood”.6 The future George V, though amiable with the children of others, and a devoted father to his own children in that he watched carefully over their development and bathed and played with them when they were babies, was far too ready to criticise and control them. In part, the problem lay in his excessive respect for discipline and order. The naval career that had been cut short by the premature death of his elder brother the Duke of Clarence in 1892 had encouraged his passion for tidiness and hard work, and made him later inclined to see his children as the potentially mutinous crew of an unseaworthy vessel. George V’s obsession with the formalities of dress, with doing things in the “correct” way, was an indication of a narrowness of outlook that sprang both from his strong belief in tradition and from feelings of intellectual inadequacy. He read very little and showed scant interest in artistic or cultural matters. In addition to his need to control his children, he also gave way all too easily to fits of temper. He was, particularly as a young man, impetuous and unrestrained in giving vent to his feelings. So much so that his wife found it difficult “to stand between [the children] 5\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nand the sudden gusts of their father’s wrath”.7 Apart from these unpredictable outbursts, George V frequently hauled his children before him for formal rebukes, many of which added yet another “Don’t” to an already lengthy list. The Duke of Windsor was one of the chief recipients of such rebukes, and recalled in his autobiography that nothing would ever be so “disconcerting to the spirit”8 as the message delivered by a footman that his father wished to see him in the library. George V may have had a deliberate policy of intimidating his children, particularly his sons. The evidence is confused, but Harold Nicolson probably came nearest the mark when he recorded in his diary: At dinner I sit next to Cromer. He makes interesting points about George V.1 He believed that Princes ought to be brought up in fear of their father: “I was always frightened of my father; they must be frightened of me.”9 At the very least, it seems clear that George V could be a very forbidding father and one likely to undermine the self-confidence of his offspring. It has been said, on the other hand, that he got on well with other people’s children. This is not the impression given by his grandson, the Earl of Harewood, in his recently published memoirs The Tongs and the Bones. Recalling his childhood contact with the King he wrote: We saw our royal relations comparatively often and regarded them therefore with awe rather than dread, though my grandfather the King found it so easy to find fault with anyone that what was probably a basic kindness was quite lost in his gruff exterior, added to which the ritual good morning and goodnight peck had to be offered to a beard of astonishing abrasiveness. I don’t think he really cared much for children and he had a positive mania for punctuality. The only person who was allowed to be late for anything, even breakfast, was apparently my mother, who was of course his only daughter, and whose instincts must have been similar to those of her two grandmothers, Queen Alexandra and the Duchess of Teck, each of whom was capable of being up to a 6\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nA ROYAL, AND DEPRIVED, CHILDHOOD, 1895–1908\n\ncouple of hours late for meals, which must have been astonishing even in Victorian times. We used at Windsor to come down at nine o’clock to breakfast, not to eat – we’d done that – but to play, visibly of course but if possible inaudibly. The King had an African Grey parrot called Charlotte of which he was very fond, it sat at a table by his side eating seeds or the apple core he gave it, sometimes perching on people’s hands, including my mother’s. Like all parrots, it clung on hard and we were scared of those pinching claws and that awesome beak so that my grandfather shouted: “The parrot will see that child’s nervous – make him keep still. . . . ”10 The possibility of getting something wrong was, where my grandfather was concerned, raised to heights of extreme probability, and our visits to Windsor for Easter usually provided their quota of uneasy moments. In 1931 he had been dangerously ill and was terrified of getting a cold. I had started to get hay fever and at the end of April, as we went to say goodbye to him in the sitting room after breakfast, I started to sneeze, either from the pollinating grass or sheer nerves, and no amount of assurance that I had hay fever could stop the shouts of “Get that damn child away from me”, which made a rather strong impression on an awakening imagination.11 Marion Crawford, nanny to the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret Rose, has also left a graphic account of her awesome first meeting with George V soon after she had taken up her post: King George grunted and prodded the ground with his stick. At first acquaintance he was rather disconcerting. He had a loud, booming voice, rather terrifying to children and young ladies who did not know him. After a moment he said: “For goodness sake, teach Margaret and Lilibet to write a decent hand, that’s all I ask you. Not one of my children can write properly. They all do it the same way. I like a hand with some character in it” he added, and walked away.12 Interestingly, George V’s own handwriting has been described as ‘slow and laboured, like a schoolboy’s’. Kenneth Clark has said he never saw an adult man write so slowly. It would seem, therefore, that the King’s irascible condemnation of his children’s 7\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nhandwriting may have sprung from his own inadequacies in the art. Perhaps many of his criticisms of others originated in an inner recognition of his own failings. The novelist and statesman John Buchan, however, thought that George V “had one key of access to all hearts, his sincere love of his fellows”. He acknowledged that the King “could be explosive and denunciatory”, but added that it was “always with a twinkle in his eye”. Mabell, Countess of Airlie, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Mary, has also left an account of the royal parents which, though basically favourable, intentionally or otherwise contains some telling criticisms: King George V and Queen Mary have often been depicted as stern unloving parents, but this they most certainly were not. Remembering them in my early days at Sandringham, before their family was even complete, [before the births of Prince George in 1902 and Prince John in 1905] I believe that they were more conscientious and more truly devoted to their children than the majority of parents in that era. The tragedy was that neither had any understanding of a child’s mind. They themselves had been brought up in particularly loving homes – Queen Alexandra had an almost cloying affection for her son; the Duchess of Teck was an adoring mother to Princess May – but they did not succeed in making their own children happy.13 Lady Airlie also remarked that, “Prince George was fond of his sons but his manner to them alternated between an awkward jocularity of the kind which makes a sensitive child squirm from selfconsciousness, and a severity bordering on harshness.”14 If George V’s failings as a father are plain enough, his wife’s inadequacies as a mother were perhaps even more serious. Lady Airlie was sympathetic, though perceptive: Princess May’s [Mary’s] attitude to parenthood I could well understand, for it was much the same as my own. Although she disliked the routine of child-bearing, and had no interest in her children as babies, she grew to love them dearly when they were older. But the difference between us was that while I, being a commoner, could keep in step with my children as they 8\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nA ROYAL, AND DEPRIVED, CHILDHOOD, 1895–1908\n\npassed from babyhood into childhood and adolescence, she was prevented by her position and her public life from having this close contact with them. When they reached an interesting age, and began to develop personalities, her sons were taken from her and delivered over to tutors. Her only opportunity of getting to know them as individuals was during the hour they spent with her in the evening, and that is not enough to create a happy relationship between child and parent.15 The future Queen Mary was prey to acute shyness, and so reserved in her emotions that she found it almost impossible to express them freely to her small children. The Empress Frederick considered her to be ‘very cold and stiff and very unmaternal”. According to Frances Donaldson, “Someone who knew her in later life summed up what dozens of people bear witness to by saying: ‘Queen Mary had nothing of the mother at all.’”16 So crippling was her inability to communicate easily with others, at least during this early stage of her marriage, that it was left to her husband to rebuke servants or alter arrangements for the children. Between her young children and her there was a chilling distance, and it is significant that she once wrote to her husband of her eldest son: “I really believe he begins to like me at last, he is most civil to me.” Later, “I have always to remember that their father is also their King.” Nothing illustrates the sorry lack of a close physical and emotional involvement between the royal couple and their young children more plainly than the fiasco over Prince Edward’s first nursemaid. This woman who was, it transpired, emotionally unstable, was so possessive of the baby prince that whenever she brought him into his parents’ presence for some rather ritualized formal contact, she pinched him so that his cries of pain and outrage ensured his speedy return to her care. It is difficult to know what effect this sadistic treatment had upon the development of the future King Edward VIII, although the fact that it cut down to the absolute minimum his physical contact with his parents was damaging enough. More significant is the implication that neither of his parents wished to keep and comfort him when he was handed, bawling, to them. Instead, he was passed back quickly and whisked out of sight. How such a disturbed and manipulative nursemaid could have been appointed 9\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nin the first place, let alone sustained in her appointment for three years, is an unpleasant mystery. Furthermore, only when the nursemaid eventually revealed the extent of her problems by suffering a nervous breakdown did it come to light that she had not had a single day’s holiday during her three years of service. Although the nursemaid was dismissed, and her place taken by the under-nurse Mrs Bill – the altogether more wholesome and stable “Lala” – she had not only helped to damage Prince Edward’s emotional development, but had also so consistently neglected Prince Albert Frederick, feeding him carelessly and erratically, that he developed chronic gastric troubles. The Duke and Duchess of York were away from their young children for lengthy periods, quite apart from only seeing them briefly during the day when they were at home. In 1897 the couple paid a state visit to Ireland, and between March and November 1901 they undertook an Empire-wide tour which culminated in the Duke opening the first parliament of the new commonwealth of Australia. On her return, it is hardly surprising that the Duchess of York should have felt that, “The younger children had grown and altered so much that, when I got back, they seemed like little strangers.” In October 1905 the Yorks embarked on a six-month tour of the Indian Empire. Although, as they grew up, their mother came to play a more conventionally maternal part in their lives, reading to them and helping them with their problems, the royal children’s early years were passed in an inhibiting atmosphere. York Cottage, on the Sandringham estate, was the first home of the Duke and Duchess of York and did not exactly provide a liberating environment. Sir Harold Nicolson described it as: . . . a glum little villa encompassed by thickets of laurel and rhododendron, shadowed by huge Wellingtonias and separated by an abrupt rim of lawn from a pond, at the edge of which a leaden pelican gazes in dejection upon the water lilies and bamboos. The local brown stone in which the house was constructed is concealed by roughcast which in its turn is enlivened by very imitation Tudor beams. The rooms inside, with their fumed oak surrounds, their white overmantels framing oval mirrors, 10\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nA ROYAL, AND DEPRIVED, CHILDHOOD, 1895–1908\n\ntheir Doulton tiles and stained glass fanlights, are indistinguishable from those of any Surbiton or Upper Norwood home. The Duke’s own sitting-room, its north window blocked by heavy shrubberies, was rendered even darker by the red cloth covering which saddened the walls. Against this dismal monochrome (which was composed of the cloth used in those days for the trousers of the French Army) hung excellent reproductions of some of the more popular pictures acquired by the Chantrey Bequests. This most undesirable residence remained his favourite home for thirty-three years. It was here that five of his six children were born.17 Lady Airlie has left an account of York Cottage which first emphasizes the difference between the royal couple’s quarters and those of their children and attendants, and then describes its orderly atmosphere: In spite of its disadvantages she had succeeded by the time I arrived there in 1902 in imprinting her own personality on the Cottage. Her boudoir, which had the exquisite daintiness and freshness which I grew to associate with her, was charming. But many of the other rooms were very badly planned. The lady in waiting slept in a bedroom little bigger than a cupboard, and the nursery and schoolroom quarters were dark and depressing.18 The children were expected to keep within their own domain, except when they had a legitimate excuse for leaving it – on their way to their mother’s boudoir after tea, or for a less pleasurable interview with their father in his sitting-room. I never saw them run along the corridors; they walked sedately, generally shepherded by nurses or tutors.19 The future Queen Mary, according to Osbert Sitwell, was almost obsessionally tidy: Certainly [she] disliked untidiness in every form, even in plants that grew in a dishevelled manner and harboured dirt or dust: for this reason, among others, she was an inveterate and implacable foe to ivy, advising always that it should be cut down, and pulling it off walls herself and making others do so.20 11\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nIn these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the York children were, in various degrees, inhibited. Lady Airlie considered “Prince Edward, always called David, and Princess Mary . . . the least inhibited of the children – the former because as the eldest son he had the highest status in the family; the latter because she was her father’s favourite. Although his jokes at her expense often made her cheeks crimson she was rarely scolded by him.”21 If Prince Edward was the least inhibited of the boys, he certainly did not escape unscathed. Quite apart from the emotional needs that led him ultimately to sacrifice his throne for Mrs Simpson, he exhibited various nervous traits throughout his young manhood, like tugging at his tie and fiddling with his coat lapels; he also smoked very heavily. Prince Albert was in a particularly difficult position in the family, sandwiched between Prince Edward and the only girl, Princess Mary. His elder brother was more self-confident and enjoyed a pre-eminence as the future monarch. His sister was doted upon by their father; indeed, the Duke of York had fervently hoped that his second child would be a girl. When the third baby proved to be the longed-for daughter, a tremendous amount of paternal emotion was invested in her. So deep was the attachment that when Princess Mary married Lord Lascelles in February 1922, George V recorded in his diary, “I went up to Mary’s room & took leave of her & quite broke down . . . Felt very down and depressed now that darling Mary has gone.”22 This almost excessive emotional attachment was very similar to the bond that had existed between Prince George and his mother, Queen Alexandra. Hating to be parted from his “Darling Motherdear”, Prince George’s emotional dependence upon his beautiful mother had only been broken by his marriage to Princess Mary of Teck in 1893. The pinching nursemaid had “frankly ignored [Prince Albert] to a degree which amounted virtually to neglect”.23 Given this and the other vicissitudes of his early upbringing it is little wonder that his official biographer, John Wheeler-Bennett, has described him thus, “a shy, nervous and affectionate child, frightened and somewhat prone to tears, he compared unfavourably with the gaiety of his more forthcoming elder brother and the inevitable charms of his baby sister.” Squeezed between these two attractive siblings, Prince Albert sometimes escaped notice altogether as when 12\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nA ROYAL, AND DEPRIVED, CHILDHOOD, 1895–1908\n\nQueen Victoria recorded in her diary, “The dear little York children came, looking very well. David is a delightful child, so intelligent, nice and friendly. The baby is a sweet, pretty little thing.”24 The old Queen made no mention of Prince Albert, who perhaps compensated for his difficult position in the family by engaging in mischievous pranks, even though these were often inspired by his elder brother. His father’s exhortations to be more obedient were even included in his fifth birthday greetings. Lady Airlie has left a sensitive account of Prince Albert’s “naughtiness”, and of his attempt to make friendly contact with her: The child to whom I was most drawn was Prince Albert – Bertie – although he was not a boy who made friends easily. Intensely sensitive over his stammer he was apt to take refuge either in silence – which caused him to be thought moody – or in naughtiness. He was more often in conflict with authority than the rest of his brothers. He made his first shy overture to me at Easter 1902 – after I had been only a few weeks in the Household – when he presented me with an Easter card. It was his own work, and very well done for a child of six – a design of spring flowers and chicks, evidently cut out from a magazine, coloured in crayons, and pasted on cardboard. He was so anxious for me to receive it in time for Easter that he decided to deliver it in person. He waylaid me one morning when I came out of his mother’s boudoir, but at the last moment his courage failed him, and thrusting the card into my hand without a word he darted away. When I succeeded later in gaining his confidence he talked to me quite normally, without stammering, and then I found that far from being backward he was an intelligent child, with more force of character than anyone suspected in those days.25 Prince Albert’s stammer was a symptom of those insecurities that his parents had done little to dispel and much, unwittingly, to increase. Classically, his stammer vanished when he felt at ease and valued. There is some dispute as to when the stammering first manifested itself. It has been claimed by Sir Louis Greig, his mentor, friend, and tennis partner, that Prince Albert’s stammer only started when he “had to make public speeches . . . It was never a natural stammer”,26 but this seems to be quite wrong. Lady Airlie 13\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nhad noticed it when the child was six years old. Another theory is that it began to be a problem after the prince’s tutors forced him during his seventh and eighth years to write with his right hand, rather than his left which came more naturally to him. This, according to his official biographer “would create a condition known in psychology as a ‘misplaced sinister’ and may well have affected his speech”.27 This speech affliction, according to one authority, was treated callously and unthinkingly at home: His brothers and sister were allowed to make fun of his stammering, ragging him without mercy after the style set by his father’s quarterdeck chaff, and he withdrew still more tightly into himself.28 As if this was not enough, Prince Albert suffered from knockknees, like his father and all of his brothers except the eldest. A set of splints was devised to correct a failing deemed inappropriate for princes of the blood royal, and at the age of eight, for many months, he had to spend some hours each day and every night in these contraptions. For much of the time it was a wearisome business and at worst like some mild form of torture. Once Prince Albert begged his manservant Finch to allow him to sleep without them. Finch relented in the face of his young charge’s bitter weeping and one night was spent without the splints. The Prince’s father heard of this act of compassion and, summoning Finch to the library, displayed his own, uncorrected, knock-knees and roared, “Look at me. If that boy grows up to look like this, it will be your fault.”29 For the most part, Prince Albert bore the splints with fortitude, writing stoically to his mother in 1904, “This is an experiment! I am sitting in the armchair with my legs in the new splints and on a chair. I have got an invalid table, which is splendid for reading but rather awkward for writing at present. I expect I shall get used to it.”30 Prince Albert’s courage was rewarded. His knock-knees were eventually straightened out. Unfortunately his stammer and his chronic gastric troubles were not as easily cured. It is little wonder that his frustrations and disabilities sometimes erupted in fits of ungovernable rage. “I am very sorry to say that Prince Albert has caused two painful scenes in his bedroom this week,” wrote his first tutor, Mr Hansell, on 16 January 1904. “On the second occasion I understand that he narrowly escaped 14\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nA ROYAL, AND DEPRIVED, CHILDHOOD, 1895–1908\n\ngiving his brother a very severe kick, it being absolutely unprovoked & Finch being engaged in helping Prince Edward at the time.”31 Prince Albert and his siblings found some solace in the affection and relaxed attention of their grandparents, Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. In their presence it was possible to indulge in highspirited romps and to escape from the watchful and disapproving eye of their father. These hours of condoned mayhem must have tasted like great gulps of freedom, and Prince Albert was quite a favourite of his grandfather. His great grandmama Queen Victoria, on the other hand, was held in great awe by the family, and seems not to have played any creative role in Prince Albert’s development; on the contrary, he felt uncomfortable in her presence. Apart from Prince Edward and Princess Mary, three other brothers were born: Prince Henry (later Duke of Gloucester) in March 1900, Prince George (later Duke of Kent) in 1902 and Prince John in 1905. Although Prince Albert was to find much joy in his relationships with Prince Henry and Prince George, his youngest brother’s life was a tragic one and ended in his sudden and premature death in 1919. Nothing much is known of Prince John. He is almost a skeleton in the Royal Family’s cupboard. Sir John Wheeler-Bennett mentions him twice in his official biography of George VI, saying, of his death in January 1919: This handsome and lovable, but unfortunately quite abnormal, boy had lived in complete seclusion at Sandringham in the charge of Mrs Bill and a male attendant, and his sudden and peaceful death could only be regarded as a release from further suffering and misery.32 No one has ever disclosed the precise nature of Prince John’s abnormality. He appears as a bouncing baby in a few family photographs. Sir Harold Nicolson’s official life of George V refers to him once in the text at the time of his death saying, simply but obscurely, that he “had for long been an invalid”.33 In James Pope-Hennessy’s Queen Mary there is a brief footnote which informs us that, “Prince John . . . had early developed epilepsy and was segregated from his brothers and sister.”34 Later, there is a fuller description of his death. 15\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nEpilepsy seems to be the most commonly recorded description of Prince John’s disability. Whether the epilepsy was the result of a difficult birth, an accident in infancy, or some undiagnosed mischance it is difficult to establish. What is certain is that Prince Albert’s youngest brother lived the latter part of his brief life segregated from his family on medical advice. He has been described as living: . . . as a satellite with his own little household on an outlying farm on the Sandringham estate under the care of a nurse Lala [Mrs Bill]. When the family went to Scotland little Prince John would follow them, though at a distance. Guests at Balmoral remember him during the Great War, a distant figure, tall, muscular but always remote, who would be glimpsed from afar in the woods escorted by his own retainers.35 Apparently, Prince John “was a friendly, outgoing little boy, much loved by his brothers and sister, a sort of mascot for the family, who treasured his na¨ıve little sayings in later years”. His eventual exclusion from their company must have been a cause of sadness, perhaps even of feelings of guilt, but since he was only born in 1905 and had in any case lived for several years in the family home, his elder siblings in particular would have been able to understand and adjust to his predicament. Still, at one level, his segregation and “abnormality” must have been disturbing to his brothers and sister. At the news of his death, Queen Mary was both grief-stricken and somewhat relieved, writing in her diary, “The news gave me a great shock, tho’ for the poor little boy’s restless soul, death came as a great relief. I broke the news to George & we motored down to Wood Farm. Found poor Lala very resigned but heartbroken. Little Johnnie looked very peaceful lying there.”36 Queen Mary also put her feelings into a letter written to her old friend Emily Alcock: For him it is a great relief, as his malady was becoming worse as he grew older, & he has thus been spared much suffering. I cannot say how grateful we feel to God for having taken him in such a peaceful way, he just slept quietly into his heavenly home, no pain no struggle, just peace for the poor little troubled spirit which had been a great anxiety to us for many years, ever 16\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nA ROYAL, AND DEPRIVED, CHILDHOOD, 1895–1908\n\nsince he was four years old – The first break in the family circle is hard to bear but people have been so kind & sympathetic & this has helped us much.37 Although the immediate family circle (if Prince John can fairly be described as belonging to that circle) was thus broken in 1919, the wider family circle had suffered the far more momentous losses of Queen Victoria in 1901 and Edward VII in 1910. The five-yearold Prince Albert had stood among a host of domestic and foreign dignitaries on a bitingly cold afternoon in early February 1901 and watched the burial of his great-grandmother, the revered and aweinspiring “Gangan”. At least he would no longer have to suffer the ordeal of being presented to the old Queen, a contact which had almost invariably reduced Prince Albert (and Prince Edward) to frightened weeping, causing Victoria to ask “with the petulance of old age, what she had done wrong now”. Prince Albert first knew of the death of his greatly loved “Grandpapa” when, looking out of a window of Marlborough House on 7 May 1910, he saw the royal standard flying at half-mast over Buckingham Palace. There is no doubt which of the two monarchs the children mourned most sincerely. Prince Albert’s early education was as erratic and flawed as his upbringing. The year 1902 marked the ending of “Lala” Bill’s benevolent reign, and two new influences entered his life. One was his manservant, Frederick Finch; the other was his tutor, Henry Peter Hansell. Finch, who took charge of both Prince Edward and Prince Albert in 1902, was a great success. Described as “handsome, stalwart and muscular”, he was also “naturally respectful but without a trace of servility”.38 He was thirty years old when he became, in effect, the two princes’ “nursemaid”, and for the next eight years he was responsible for their care, supervising their clothes, ensuring that they had washed properly, hearing their prayers, and coping with their tantrums and anxieties. There is no doubt that Finch was a good influence: fair, concerned, consistent and unruffled. The same cannot be said for Mr Hansell. Appointed by the boys’ father chiefly on account of his enthusiasm for yachting, Hansell, though tall and good looking, a competent academic 17\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nand a keen sportsman, was often detached, much given to staring into space with his pipe in his mouth. Mr Hansell had neither a sense of humour nor any great insight. He expected obedience and hard work, but seems to have manifestly failed to captivate or stimulate his young charges’ imaginations. It is perhaps symptomatic of Hansell’s virtuous and humourless disposition that he was later to make Prince Edward head-boy in a “school” consisting of two pupils. When, in the spring of 1907, Prince Edward left for the Royal Naval College at Osborne, Prince Albert was appointed head-boy over his brother Prince Henry, who constituted the rest of the school. Such dizzy promotion did not increase Prince Albert’s sense of responsibility, and in December 1907 Hansell told the Prince of Wales, “I should say that Prince Albert has failed to appreciate his position as ‘captain’.” In fairness to Hansell, he did tell the Princes’ father that his pupils might benefit more from contact with boys of their own age in a preparatory school. The Prince of Wales, however, recalling his own close attachment to his tutor the Reverend John Dalton, refused to consider such a move. So Hansell plodded on, aided with varying degrees of success by Walter Jones, the schoolmaster at Sandringham, Monsieur Hua who taught the royal children French, Professor Oswald the German tutor, and their maths teacher Martin David. Prince Albert was not the ideal pupil. His stammer made foreign language practice an agony, his maths were at first very weak, and, in general, he found concentration difficult: Driven in upon himself, he alternated between periods of dreamy abstraction, during which it seemed impossible to command his concentration, and outbursts of emotional excitement, sometimes of high spirits and exuberance, sometimes of passionate weeping and depression.39 Added to this, his father’s testy and regular exhortations to do better and to “no longer behave like a little child of 6” could not have encouraged him to gain in confidence. In 1908, he took the entrance examination for the Royal Naval College at Osborne. Thanks to some heavy cramming in mathematics, he passed the written examinations in December with some ease – having done “extremely well” in English, History and 18\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nA ROYAL, AND DEPRIVED, CHILDHOOD, 1895–1908\n\nFrench. His interview, a month earlier, also went well after a bad start when he stammered and exhibited tremendous shyness. It was clear, therefore, that despite his disabilities, Prince Albert could rise to a challenge and acquit himself with credit. It was a pattern that was to be characteristic of his later career.\n\n19\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\n2\n\nTHE NAVAL CADET 1909–1913 Now remember everything rests with you, and you are quite intelligent and can do well if you like. George V to Prince Albert while a naval cadet at Osborne, 1910 I am afraid there is no disguising to you that P[rince] A[lbert] has gone a mucker. He has been quite off his head, with the excitement of getting home, for the last few days, and unfortunately as those were the days of the examinations, he has come quite to grief. . . . James Watt, Second Master at Osborne, to Mr Hansell, 1910\n\nDuring his five years of naval training, Prince Albert progressed from the Royal Naval College at Osborne, to Dartmouth, and finally to the training ship HMS Cumberland. Prince Albert’s father had received what was probably the most formative part of his education as a cadet in the Royal Navy, it seemed natural to him that his two eldest sons should follow his example. There was no featherbedding for princes in the Royal Navy. King George V later recalled: It never did me any good to be a Prince, I can tell you, and many was the time I wished I hadn’t been. It was a pretty tough place and, so far from making any allowances for our disadvantages, the other boys made a point of taking it out on us on the grounds that they’d never be able to do it later on . . . they used to make me go up and challenge the bigger boys – I was awfully small then – and I’d get a hiding time and again.1 Prince Albert was hardly better equipped to cope with the rigours and demands of life at the Royal Naval College at Osborne. To begin with, he was shy, nervous and particularly homesick. He had never before sat in a class of more than three, and never played a serious game of cricket or football in his life. In addition, the fact that he was a prince of the blood, and one who suffered 20\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nTHE NAVAL CADET, 1909–1913\n\nfrom a stammer, encouraged his fellow cadets to taunt and tease him. Despite the fact that in his first letter home to his mother, Prince Albert wrote “I have quite settled down here now”, it is quite evident that it took him from January 1909 well into the summer term of the same year to adjust to the demands of his new environment. By that summer term, however, his friendly and open personality, and his growing skill at rugby and cricket, had made him more popular with his fellow cadets. Captain Christian, the Captain of Osborne College, said of him, “He shows the grit and never-say-I’m-beaten spirit which is strong in him – it is a grand trait in anybody’s character.” Later, at Dartmouth, another naval officer recalled, “One knew, instinctively, that he would never let you down . . . he never once asked for a favour all the time he was at Dartmouth, nor did he once use his position to gain a favour from anybody else.”2 Prince Albert, despite his natural shyness and the disability of his stammer, proceeded to make a number of friends at Osborne. These included Jimmie James, Colin Buist, George Cavendish, Bill Slayter and Miles Reid. He continued to keep in touch with all of these throughout his naval career, and did not forget them in later life. For their part, they enjoyed his sense of fun and what has been called his complete lack of “side”. He was also known for his integrity and courage, and for his general capacity for good fellowship. When he was with these friends, Prince Albert’s stammer more or less disappeared. Unfortunately, this was not so in class. He frequently found it impossible to participate in group discussions, and several of his masters were annoyed and impatient at his hesitation, failing to understand the cause of it. His father showed a deeper understanding of what was going on. Writing to Mr Hansell, “Watt thinks Bertie shy in class, I expect it is his dislike of showing his hesitating speech that prevents him from answering, but he will, I hope, grow out of it.” Towards the end of the summer term of 1909, and just before the State Visit of the Tsar of Russia, Prince Albert developed whooping cough. He was quickly put into quarantine, and the illness, though denying him the opportunity of meeting his royal Russian relatives, brought him into contact with a young Scotsman, 21\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nSurgeon-Lieutenant Louis Greig. Greig was the Assistant Medical Officer at Osborne, and he was a hero to the cadets, more for his skill at coaching rugby football, than for his medical expertise. Prince Albert took an instant liking to this self-confident and tough young man, and a friendship developed between them which was to play a significant part in the later life of the Prince. In May 1910, Prince Albert’s grandfather, King Edward VII, died, and on 9 May the accession of King George V was proclaimed on the balcony of Friary Court, St James’s Palace. Prince Edward and Prince Albert, dressed in naval uniforms, witnessed the ceremony from the garden wall of Marlborough House. Prince Edward now became Prince of Wales, and Prince Albert second in line to the succession to the throne. There were, however, more pressing concerns for Prince Albert. In particular, it was not certain that he would make the grade for the transfer to Dartmouth at the end of 1910, as his academic performance at Osborne had not been impressive and he had frequently been bottom of the class, or near the bottom, in many subjects. Captain Christian had written, “He is always very penitent with me, assures me that he is doing his best, and so on. I am sure the boy has determination and grit in him, but he finds it difficult to apply it to work, tho’ with games it comes out strongly.” One of his tutors commented, “With Prince Albert’s mercurial temperament, all things are possible . . . I don’t think he regards a rebuke any more seriously than his work.” His father, though earlier prepared to be understanding, had consequently issued him with a stern reprimand on the subject: My dearest Bertie, I am sorry to have to say that the last reports from Mr Watt [the Second Master] with regard to your work, are not at all satisfactory, he says you don’t seem to take your work at all seriously, nor do you appear to be very keen about it. My dear boy, this will not do, if you go on like this you will be at the bottom of your Term . . . and you won’t pass your examination, and very probably will be warned this term if you don’t take care. You know it is Mamma’s and my great wish that you should go into the Navy, and I believe that you are anxious to do so,\n\n22\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nTHE NAVAL CADET, 1909–1913\n\nbut unless you now put your shoulder to the wheel and really try and do your best to work hard, you will have no chance of passing any of your examinations. It will be a great bore, but if I find that you have not worked well at the end of this term, I shall have to get a Master for you to work with all the holidays, and you will have no fun at all. Now remember, everything rests with you, and you are quite intelligent, and can do very well if you like. I trust that you will take to heart what I have written, and that the next report will be a good one, and the others to come, until the end of the term.3 Although Prince Albert avoided the necessity of having a home tutor, his academic performance during his last few months at Osborne was far from satisfactory. In the end of term examinations in December 1910, he did very badly indeed. The excitement engendered by the prospect of returning to Sandringham for the Christmas holidays had apparently destroyed his powers of concentration. Mr Watt wrote despairingly to Mr Hansell: . . . I am afraid their Majesties will be very disappointed, and I can well understand it. But after all, the boy must be at the least stable part of his mental development, and I expect another year will produce a great change in him. There could be no disguising the fact that Prince Albert’s final position at Osborne was sixty-eighth out of sixty-eight. Despite these lamentable results, Prince Albert was allowed to proceed to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. He arrived there on a grey January afternoon in 1911. Here he joined his brother, the Prince of Wales, who was in his last year. Prince Albert did not make a brilliant start at Dartmouth. He was at once assigned for extra tuition in mathematics and engineering to a Lieutenant Start. Start, who was another of the Prince’s tutors with a distinguished sporting reputation, at least succeeded in encouraging Prince Albert to make some academic headway. Indeed, as a reward for his pupil’s hard work, shortly before the beginning of the holidays Start gave him a set of teaspoons made of an amalgam of metals which looked very like silver, but which would melt at 160◦ F. These trick spoons would dissolve in a cup of tea, as\n\n23\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nthe tea was stirred. The Prince reported to Start on his return to Dartmouth after the holidays that he had tried the trick at Sandringham, with excellent results, although his father had not been amused. Prince Albert’s first six months at Dartmouth were marked by two occurrences, one potentially lethal, the other more satisfying. In the first instance, an epidemic of measles and mumps swept through the naval college, and both princes were among the victims of both diseases. They were sufficiently ill for bulletins to be issued to the press, but by the beginning of March they were discharged from medical attention and went to recuperate at Newquay, at the Headlands Hotel, under the supervision of their old tutor, Mr Hansell. In June 1911, Prince Albert participated in the great ceremonials attending the Coronation of his father as King George V. Dressed in naval cadet’s uniform, he drove to the Abbey in the Prince of Wales’ procession, where, with his three brothers and sister, he watched the age-old and majestic ceremony of the Coronation, and saw his elder brother pay homage to their father. They then took part in the lengthy ceremonial drive back to Buckingham Palace through the cheering crowds, and appeared with the King and Queen on the balcony. When he returned to Dartmouth, he went straight back to his studies, but his tutors still found him wanting in concentration. One of them wrote, “He can concentrate, but at present he will not force himself to do so for more than a minute or two; it is a spasmodic effort to satisfy us, not the deliberate choice of his own mind.” Therefore, during the summer vacation at Balmoral, Mr Watt was engaged to tutor Prince Albert in physics and mathematics. In view of the fact that Prince Albert had finished sixty-seventh out of sixty-eight at the end of the summer term at Dartmouth, this extra tuition was very necessary. Although some progress was made in the offending subjects during the summer vacation, King George took his second son to task before his return to Dartmouth, urging upon him the virtues of hard work and self discipline. He followed this up with a letter:\n\n24\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nTHE NAVAL CADET, 1909–1913\n\nI trust you will take to heart all I told you before you left, & remember yr. position, & that is for you to set an example to the others, & you must really work hard & try your best and soon I hope go up several places, as it does look so bad that you are practically last in your term, & everyone says that you can do much better if you like.4 By the end of the Christmas term, Prince Albert had satisfied his father’s demand to some extent. He was now marked sixty-third, a rise of four places, and his tutor’s reports were encouraging. Life at Dartmouth did not consist only of hard academic work. It seems that Prince Albert had the opportunity to get up to mischief as well. On Guy Fawkes night, 1912, he and some sixteen other cadets let off fireworks in the college’s lavatories. Together with the others, the Prince was given six strokes of the cane, although he was later to complain that since the cane had broken at the fourth stroke, he should not have received the remaining two. In April 1912, at the Parish Church at Sandringham, where he had been baptized, Prince Albert was confirmed by Bishop BoydCarpenter, the Clerk of the Closet. The Prince was apparently greatly moved by the ceremony of confirmation, and two years later wrote to Bishop Boyd-Carpenter, “It will be just two years ago tomorrow that you confirmed me at the small church at Sandringham. I have always remembered that day as one on which I took a great step in life. I took the Holy Sacrament on Easter Day alone with my father and mother, my eldest brother and my sister. It was so very nice having a small service, quite alone like that, only the family.” During his last six months at Dartmouth, Prince Albert continued to make steady, though unspectacular, academic progress. His final position was sixty-first, which was a moderate improvement. None of his tutors yet considered him to be outstanding, either in academic work or even in games. On the other hand, he had acquired an admirable reputation for generosity, loyalty and the capacity for sharing in fun. One of his tutors summed him up by saying, “Quite unspoiled, and a nice honest, clean-minded\n\n25\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nand excellent-mannered boy.” It was a judgement which must have pleased his father. The final part of Prince Albert’s naval training took place aboard the 9,800-ton cruiser Cumberland, which he joined at Devonport on 17 January 1913. Aboard HMS Cumberland, Prince Albert had to put into practice the theoretical training he had acquired at Osborne and Dartmouth. Quite apart from this, he was obliged to experience, at first hand, the various tasks of those whom he would one day have to command. Thus he coaled the furnaces, like everybody else on board, and went on watch under the supervision of his officers. More important, perhaps, the cruise on HMS Cumberland brought him into contact with the world outside. A further advantage, since Prince Edward was not aboard Cumberland, was that he no longer was likely to be compared unfavourably with his elder brother. One contemporary, remembering them both at an earlier stage of their naval training, recalled, “It was like comparing an ugly duckling with a cock pheasant.” The ugly duckling was now about to strike off into the world in his own right. The Cumberland’s cruise lasted from 18 January to 8 July 1913, and took her from Tenerife to the West Indies, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Quebec, St John’s, Newfoundland and finally back to Plymouth. Prince Albert was thus able to witness the enthusiasm of many of his father’s subjects at first hand. In Jamaica, he faced the ordeal of officially opening the new wing of the Kingston Yacht Club, of which the main building had been opened by his father in 1901. The speech was not a great success. Quite apart from Prince Albert’s anxiety lest he should stammer, several young Jamaican women stood round him on the platform as he spoke, and prodded his ankles and thighs. One whispered to her friend, “Say, have you touched the Prince?” Her friend replied rapturously, “Yes, three times.” At the very least, this was a new experience. Later, in Canada, Prince Albert was pursued by the press. He wrote in his diary, “I was hunted all the time by photographers, and also by the Americans, who had not manners at all, and tried to take photographs all the time.” He went salmon fishing on the Gaspe peninsular, and in Newfoundland, his hosts noticed that he 26\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nTHE NAVAL CADET, 1909–1913\n\nseemed completely at ease while engaged in this sport, and that his stammer was not in evidence. When Prince Albert returned to England in July 1913, his father noticed on greeting him that he had changed a great deal. He seemed more grown up, with more self-confidence, and was able to express himself more fluently. A little later, King George met Prince Albert’s Term Officer aboard HMS Cumberland, and said to him, “Thank you. I am pleased with my boy.” It was sufficient.\n\n27\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\n3\n\nTHE ROYAL NAVY 1913–1917 At the commencement I was sitting at the top of A turret, and had a very good view of the proceedings. I was up there during a lull, when a German ship started firing at us, and one salvo “straddled” us. We at once returned the fire. I was distinctly startled, and jumped down the hole in the top of the turret like a shot rabbit! Prince Albert on his part in the Battle of Jutland, 1916\n\nPrince Albert was appointed midshipman on 15 September 1913, barely eleven months before the outbreak of the First World War. Halfway through that conflict, the Prince took part in the Battle of Jutland, thus becoming the only British monarch in recent history to have been on active service. It cannot, however, be claimed that Prince Albert’s naval career was an unqualified success. Although between 1913 and 1916 he rose from the rank of midshipman to lieutenant, his progress was dogged by chronic seasickness, and other disabilities. His first appointment was in the 19,250-ton battleship Collingwood, commanded by Captain James Ley. Midshipman Prince Albert was accorded no special privileges, as this rank were at the beck and call of their superior officers aboard ship. Even when off duty, he and a dozen others shared a flat outside the gun-room, where all his clothes and personal belongings were stored in a teachest, above which he slung his hammock at night. In addition, he carried out the daily routine of the midshipman, such as standing watch, taking his picket boat to shore, and working hard at coaling the battleship. He was known aboard ship simply as Mr Johnson, a further indication of his lack of privilege. Being, at seventeen, one of the lowest forms of life in the Royal Navy could not fail to be an excellent training for a prince. As a result, and despite his innate conservatism, Prince Albert was always able to demonstrate that he had the common touch. At the same time, his naval duties\n\n28\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nTHE ROYAL NAVY, 1913–1917\n\nimposed a considerable degree of responsibility, and there was soon ample evidence that the experience was maturing and developing his personality. At the end of October, 1913, Collingwood sailed as part of the first battle squadron, from Devonport, to take part in manoeuvres in the Mediterranean, and then to cruise in Egyptian and Aegean waters. During this voyage, Prince Albert saw Alexandria where the fleet docked after its manoeuvres. He stayed with Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, the British Agent and the effective ruler of Egypt. Kitchener presented Prince Albert to the Khedive, Abbas II, who must have wondered at the sight of the second son of the KingEmperor serving in so humble a position aboard a British warship. While he was in Egypt, Prince Albert was taken by a guide to the top of the great Pyramid, where the initials ‘AE’ were pointed out to him, scratched into the stone. They were the mark of his grandfather, King Edward VII, made there fifty years before. After Alexandria, the fleet sailed to Greece, where it anchored in the Bay of Salamis. Despite suffering from a cold, Prince Albert was able to make some contact with his Greek relatives, particularly King Constantine and Queen Sophie. He recorded in his diary, “I saw Uncle Tino, Aunt Sophie and the cousins, and then I went with George and Alexander to see the Acropolis and museums. After lunch I looked at some photographs of the War. After tea I motored down to Piraeus with Aunt Sophie, and returned to the ship in the barge. I changed and then helped with the main derrick. After supper, we left Salamis Bay for Malta. I turned in at 9.30.”1 By December 1913, Collingwood was back at Gibraltar. There, Prince Albert celebrated his eighteenth birthday, the first birthday and the first Christmas he had spent away from home. The entry in his diary read, “My eighteenth birthday, and I am allowed to smoke.” In celebration of his birthday his mother had sent him a cigarette case, which he acknowledged in a grateful letter, written from Toulon. Thus began Prince Albert’s long addiction to nicotine, a taste which was eventually to lead to lung cancer and his premature death in 1952. At the end of December the first Battle Squadron returned to its home base, and Prince Albert was able to join his family at Sandringham for the new year celebrations. His father was pleased with further signs of his son’s growing maturity. 29\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nFor the next six months, Prince Albert served aboard his ship, with routine periods of leave with his family. That he lived a very ordinary life aboard HMS Collingwood is indicated by the account he sent to his father of a minor injury he suffered as a result of being tipped out of his hammock by another midshipman. “. . . hit my left eye on my chest. It swelled up very much, and yesterday it was bandaged up. I did not touch it, or actually hurt the eyeball, but it was very sore all round. It is much better today, but I expect I shall have a black eye for a few days.”2 King George V replied sympathetically, “Sorry that with the help of someone else you fell out of yr. hammock, and hit your eye on yr. chest, it must have hurt a good deal, but glad it didn’t damage yr. eye permanently. I should do the same to the other fellow, if I got the chance.” Meanwhile, the old order in Europe was passing. The assassination in June 1914 of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, at Sarajevo, began the lengthy and in some ways unnecessary descent into full-scale hostilities. On 15 July 1914 the Naval Reserve began a test mobilization on the orders of Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty. On 28 July, Austria declared war on Serbia in retaliation for the assassination of the Archduke. On the very same day, the British fleet was despatched to its war station, and the battle squadrons began to leave Portland to concentrate at Scapa Flow. Collingwood took part in this great naval migration, and Prince Albert reported in his diary, “After dinner, I kept the first watch, and we went to night defence stations. The four-inch guns were all ready for a destroyer attack. We passed the Straits of Dover at 12.00. I then turned in.” On 4 August, Britain declared war on Germany. Aboard HMS Collingwood, Prince Albert recorded, “I got up at 11.45, and kept the middle watch till 4.00. War was declared between us and Germany at 2.00 am. I turned in again at 4.00 until 7.15. Sir John Jellicoe took over the command from Sir George Callaghan. After divisions, we went to control. I kept the afternoon watch till 4.00 pm. Two German trawlers were captured by destroyers. Papa sent a most interesting telegram to the Fleet. I put it down in words.” Back in London, George V wrote in his diary, “Please God it may soon be over, & that he will protect dear Bertie’s life.” As it happened, there was no immediate cause for alarm. Collingwood 30\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nTHE ROYAL NAVY, 1913–1917\n\nplayed her part in the routine patrolling of the coast and Prince Albert performed his routine duties as midshipman in the ‘A’ turret of the battleship. For the most part, these duties consisted of enduring lengthy periods at sea, interspersed with brief bouts of shore leave at Rosyth. With his second son at sea in the Royal Navy, the King found it easier to express the growing warmth of his regard, writing, “It has all come so suddenly . . . always do your duty. May God bless and protect you, my dear boy, is the earnest prayer of your ever devoted Papa.” A few days later the King was reminding his son that “you can be sure that you are constantly in my thoughts”. In fact, the main hazard which Prince Albert faced in these early months of the war came not from the German High Seas Fleet, but from a series of gastric illnesses. Doubtless the tensions of war service revived the gastric ailments that had characterized his childhood. On 23 August, however, something more serious occurred. Prince Albert noted in his diary, “I then went to the sick bay with a violent pain in the stomach. I could hardly breathe. They put hot fomentations on it, which eased it. . . . Morphia was injected into my arm. I was put to bed in the Commander’s cabin at 8.00 and I slept the whole night.” Within two days, appendicitis had been diagnosed. Prince Albert was moved from Collingwood to the hospital ship Rohilla, at Wick. Eventually, despite the menace of a German submarine in the vicinity, Rohilla was sent to Aberdeen on 28 August. The next day Prince Albert was occupying a bed in the Northern Nursing Home. On 9 September he was operated on by Professor John Marnoch of Aberdeen University. The operation was perfectly straightforward and successful, and within a few days Prince Albert was writing to his parents: I am afraid you must be rather frightened when you heard I was ill. I am much better now, and feel quite happy . . . the pain has practically gone away, although it hurt a good deal last Sunday . . . you must be very sorry at not being able to go up to Scotland this year as usual. You must be very tired after all this very trying time with so much work to do, and so many people to see, and never getting a rest. . . . Best love to you dearest Papa, Mama and Mary, and my thoughts are always with you. Your most devoted son, Bertie. 31\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nBecause of his appendicitis, Prince Albert had missed the first engagement of the war, when the fleet had encountered the enemy at the Battle of Heligoland Bight. Moreover, for a time it seemed that he might never go to sea again. Sir Frederick Treves, the King’s surgeon, was adamant that the convalescence should be a protracted one, even arguing that the Prince should not be allowed to go back to the Navy. Eventually it was arranged that he should go to work on the War Staff at the Admiralty, and on 2 December 1914 he reported there and was received by Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, and taken to see the War Room, where the great charts showed the position and movement of every British warship. Shore work, however, did not appeal to him, and he was soon showing his eagerness to get back on active duty. At length, in February 1915, after an interview with the Second Sea Lord, he was given permission to return to sea. He wrote to his father, “I was really very sorry to leave last Friday, and I felt quite homesick the first night, not being used to a hammock. But of course I knew that it was quite right for me to go back, now that I have quite recovered from my appendicitis.” His father replied, somewhat oddly, a few days later, “I miss you still very much, especially at breakfast.” Back aboard the Collingwood, Prince Albert now took up the post of senior midshipman. His new duties included being in control of searchlights and in charge of submarine lookouts during the daytime. The pattern of the naval war had changed since his sick leave. Now, units of the Fleet only went out into the North Sea for three-day tours of duty, remaining in harbour at Scapa Flow for ten days. This meant that a good deal of Prince Albert’s new responsibilities were undertaken on shore. While ashore, he worked as an assistant to the gunnery and torpedo lieutenants, and commanded a variety of small boats, servicing the Fleet. For the most part, the Prince’s routine was a dreary one, but he was able to correspond regularly with his father and mother, and it is from these letters that we learn of the exciting or dramatic incidents of these months. The nearest that Prince Albert came to experiencing a taste of real action was when Collingwood and other warships bumped into several German submarines, one of them being sunk from a blow from the Dreadnought’s bow. The appalling losses being suffered by the British Army on the western front were brought home at 32\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nTHE ROYAL NAVY, 1913–1917\n\na personal level to Prince Albert with the death in action of John Bigge, son of King George V’s Private Secretary, Lord Stamfordham. Later, the sinking of the Lusitania on 7 May 1915, with the loss of 1198 lives, caused Prince Albert to write to his father, “. . . a terrible catastrophe, with so much loss of life. It makes one angry to think that after a thing like Lusitania going down, we cannot do anything in revenge. Here we are, absolutely ready the whole time, and still we have to wait.”3 Prince Albert was further frustrated by the return of his gastric troubles three months after his return to the Collingwood. By the middle of May 1915, he was complaining of the attacks. They were particularly trying in that he never knew when to expect them, and they might seize him while on duty. By the beginning of July he had lost so much weight, and was exhibiting so much anxiety, that he was transferred to a hospital ship for a period of observation and recuperation. Prince Albert’s second bout of sick leave was no more comprehensible than the first. What was really wrong with him? The diagnosis was of a weakening of the muscular wall of the stomach, resulting in a catarrhal condition. The treatment of this condition was hardly agreeable: a quiet, regular life, careful dieting, and the pumping out of the contents of his stomach every night – a process which he described in great detail to his mother in a letter of 21 July 1915. Recovery was not easy and there were frequent relapses. His failure to recover as quickly as expected put his medical advisers into a quandary. However, Prince Albert had received assurances from his father, his captain, and from the consultant to the Fleet, Sir William Watson Cheyne, that if the Fleet put to sea for action, he would immediately be recalled for duty. On 10 August 1915, Captain Ley, commander of the Collingwood told King George V of his anxiety about Prince Albert’s health. Expressing his misgivings over his undertaking to summon Prince Albert back to the Collingwood in the event of naval action, Captain Ley wrote: Ten days ago Dr Sutton told me that it would be most unadvisable, even dangerous to his health, to do so. Since then he has been improving steadily, but today he has again informed me that, taking everything into consideration, he does not consider 33\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nthat the Prince’s condition would allow of his being embarked at the present time. . . . At the same time I feel strongly that should I . . . go to sea without him, I should be breaking my word to Your Majesty and Prince Albert. Nevertheless, I consider that this would be my right course.4 King George would have none of this. Convinced that his son would not want to miss any great sea action, and doubtless, with his own naval career behind him, wishing to experience any moment of glory vicariously through Prince Albert, the King told Captain Ley that: He attached the utmost importance to keeping faith with Prince Albert, with regard to the promise given HRH that in the event of the Fleet putting to sea, he should return to Collingwood. . . . there is in the King’s opinion only one alternative, and that is to declare that the Prince is medically unfit for service; to send him on sick leave and place him in a nursing home under special treatment. This course His Majesty would however strongly deprecate. . . . HM also remembers that you think that the Prince’s illness gets somewhat on his nerves, which seems to be another reason for refraining from any action likely to upset HRH.5 Here, encapsulated in his father’s letter, was Prince Albert’s problem. That he wanted to return to sea was not in doubt. That his nervous and anxious disposition had exacerbated his physical ailments seems very likely. At the same time, the Prince knew how dearly the King wished him to participate in some great high seas naval action. He was aware that his father was investing more and more in him, in his reliability, obedience, and the capacity to mirror the paternal image. All of this must have put an enormous pressure upon the young naval officer. His father swung between consideration, understanding and impatience, on the one hand writing to his son, “you can’t expect to get well in a minute, anything to do with the stomach must take a little time to get right,” and on the other, expressing his exasperation to his old friend Admiral Sir Stanley Colville at his son’s continuing indisposition. 34\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nTHE ROYAL NAVY, 1913–1917\n\nAt length a compromise was found. In mid-September 1915 Prince Albert was sent to convalesce at Abergeldie in the Highlands, where he was joined by Mr Hansell for a month. In October, however, he was still declared unfit for duty. His anxious state was not improved by the news of his father’s accident in France at the end of October: the King had been pitched from his horse while inspecting men from the first Wing of the Royal Flying Corps, and had received serious injuries. By the end of 1915 Prince Albert, still unwell, was granted three months’ sick leave by the Naval Medical Board. Although he was officially attached to the Admiralty for light duties, these amounted to very little, and Prince Albert’s spirits remained depressed. One breath of fresh air, bringing him near to real action in the war, occurred at the end of January 1916 when he went to spend four days with the Prince of Wales, who was attached to the Headquarters Staff of the Army in France. He returned to London with more self-confidence, and with fresh determination to fight off his illness. While on sick leave, Prince Albert began his official career as a working member of the Royal Family, although his duties were not particularly onerous. On 17 March 1916 he performed his first public function when he opened a new rifle range installed for the use of Members of Parliament in the Palace of Westminster. He concluded his short speech by saying, “I shall declare the range open by firing the first shot, and I will try my very best to obtain a bull’s eye.” (The shot was, in fact, an inner, just above the bull’s eye.) A little later, he welcomed the Crown Prince of Serbia on his arrival at Charing Cross for a visit to Britain. Despite having to converse in French, he did well enough, though writing to his friend Louis Greig, “I am still leading the quiet life, with a Serbian Prince thrown in last week. Pretty stiff time with him, as he can’t talk English.” At the beginning of May 1916 he was at last allowed to rejoin Collingwood. A few weeks earlier he had passed his examinations to be an acting sub-lieutenant, and was later made up to substantive rank. He rejoined the Fleet only just in time. It was clear, by the spring of 1916, that the German High Seas Fleet could no longer skulk within the safety of harbour, and the failure of the German army to make a dramatic breakthrough on the Western 35\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nGEORGE VI\n\nFront accentuated the demand for victorious action at sea. On 30 May the British Battle Fleet from Scapa and Cromarty under Sir John Jellicoe, and the Battle Squadrons from Rosyth under Sir David Beatty, put to sea, knowing that the German High Seas Fleet was steaming into the North Sea off the Norwegian coast. The scene was now set for the most significant naval confrontation of the war. It was the day for which the Royal Navy, and, perhaps with less enthusiasm, the German navy, had thirsted since the beginning of hostilities. The Battle of Jutland, brief, oblique, and ultimately indecisive, was about to take place. Ironically, when Collingwood, with the first Battle Squadron, put to sea, on the night of Tuesday 30 May, Prince Albert was in the sick bay. Whether his indisposition was the result of his old gastric and nervous problems, or the effect of eating too much soused mackerel with a fellow lieutenant on the previous Saturday night, is not clear. What is clear is that he was revived by the call to action early in the afternoon of 31 May. A fellow lieutenant, Tait, serving on Collingwood, sent an amusing account of Prince Albert’s recuperation to his brother, the Prince of Wales: Suddenly, at about 2.00 pm a signal was received that the German High Seas Fleet was out, and engaging our battle cruisers only forty miles away, and that the battle was coming in our direction. Huge excitement. Out at last. Full speed ahead. Sound off “action” – you can imagine the scene! Out of his bunk leaps “Johnson”. Ill? Never felt better! Strong enough to go to his turret and fight a prolonged action? Of course he was, why ever not?6 Sub-Lieutenant “Johnson” remained in his turret until the action finally ceased the next day. Collingwood, in fact, had little contact with the main German Battle Fleet apart from seeing the distant flashes of their guns. She was, however, attacked by torpedo craft, and saw the destruction of HMS Defence, and then Black Prince, uncomfortably near at hand. HMS Collingwood’s great moment came when the German warship Derfflinger suddenly emerged from the mist leading a division of the enemy’s ships. Collingwood’s great guns fired three salvoes, at eight thousand yards’ range at Derfflinger. Huge gaps were torn in the enemy’s side, and flames flickered through a hole in her 36\n\nTrim: 135mm × 216mm\n\nP1: KAE IBBK056-INT\n\nIBBK056-George VI\n\nJanuary 11, 2012\n\n9:9\n\nPrinter: Yet to Come\n\nTHE ROYAL NAVY, 1913–1917\n\nquarter deck. But Collingwood was unable to finish her off. It was nine o’clock, and the darkness was closing in. Everywhere the action died away, and men in both battle fleets manned their guns, waiting for attacks which never came. Prince Albert left a graphic account of his experiences in a letter written to his parents: I was in A turret, and watched most of the action through one of the trainer’s telescopes, as we were firing by Director, when the turret is trained in the working chamber, and not in the gun house. At the commencement I was sitting at the top of A turret, and had a very good view of the proceedings. I was up there during a lull, when a German ship started firing at us, and one salvo “straddled” us. We at once returned the fire. I was distinctly startled, and jumped down the hole in the "
