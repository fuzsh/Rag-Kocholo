        "text": "List of literature quotes from the last 100 years of Nobel Literature Prize winners.\n\nGathered by Regina Kenney\n\n“Death is the fairest thing in the world. No one’s ever gotten out of it. The earth takes everyone – the kind, the cruel, the sinners. Aside from that, there’s no fairness on earth.”\n\n– Svetlana Alexievich\n\nFrom Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster\n\n2015 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“You were right to tell me that in life it is not the future which counts, but the past.”\n\n― Patrick Modiano\n\nFrom Missing Person\n\n2014 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“There is a limit to the amount of misery and disarray you will put up with, for love, just as there is a limit to the amount of mess you can stand around a house. You can’t know the limit beforehand, but you will know when you’ve reached it. I believe this.”\n\n― Alice Munro\n\n2013 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“Finally, she mused that human existence is as brief as the life of autumn grass, so what was there to fear from taking chances with your life?”\n\n― Mo Yan\n\nFrom Red Sorghum\n\n2012 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“In the middle of life, death comes to take your measurements. The visit is forgotten and life goes on. But the suit is being sewn on the sly.”\n\n― Tomas Tranströmer\n\nFrom The Deleted World\n\n2011 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“One can’t fight with oneself, for this battle has only one loser.”\n\n― Mario Vargas Llosa\n\nFrom Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter\n\n2010 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“I have packed myself into silence so deeply and for so long that I can never unpack myself using words. When I speak, I only pack myself a little differently.”\n\n― Herta Müller\n\nFrom The Hunger Angel\n\n2009 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“Real lives have no end. Real books have no end.”\n\n― Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio\n\nFrom The Book of Flights\n\n2008 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“What’s terrible is to pretend that second-rate is first-rate. To pretend that you don’t need love when you do; or you like your work when you know quite well you’re capable of better.”\n\n― Doris Lessing\n\nFrom The Golden Notebook\n\n2007 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“I read a book one day and my whole life was changed.”\n\n― Orhan Pamuk\n\nFrom The New Life\n\n2006 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“One way of looking at speech is to say that it is a constant stratagem to cover nakedness.”\n\n― Harold Pinter\n\nFrom Various Voices: Prose, Poetry, Politics\n\n2005 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“Every day, a piece of music, a short story, or a poem dies because its existence is no longer justified in our time. And things that were once considered immortal have become mortal again, no one knows them anymore. Even though they deserve to survive.”\n\n― Elfriede Jelinek\n\nFrom The Piano Teacher\n\n2004 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“Truth is not spoken in anger. Truth is spoken, if it ever comes to be spoken, in love. The gaze of love is not deluded. It sees what is best in the beloved even when what is best in the beloved finds it hard to emerge into the light.”\n\n― John M. Coetzee\n\nFrom Slow Man\n\n2003 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“You just sit there and tolerate it, the same way everything in this country is tolerated. Every deception, every lie, every bullet in the brains. Just as you are already tolerating bullets in the brains that will be implemented only after the bullet is put in your brains.”\n\n― Imre Kertész\n\nFrom Liquidation\n\n2002 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“Most people are not really free. They are confined by the niche in the world that they carve out for themselves. They limit themselves to fewer possibilities by the narrowness of their vision.”\n\n― Sir Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul\n\n2001 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“You should know that there is little you can seek in this world, that there is no need for you to be so greedy, in the end all you can achieve are memories, hazy, intangible, dreamlike memories which are impossible to articulate. When you try to relate them, there are only sentences, the dregs left from the filter of linguistic structures.”\n\n― Gao Xingjian\n\nFrom Soul Mountain\n\n2000 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“Granted: I AM an inmate of a mental hospital; my keeper is watching me, he never lets me out of his sight; there’s a peep-hole in the door, and my keeper’s eye is the shade of brown that can never see through a blue-eyed type like me.”\n\n―Günter Grass\n\nFrom The Tin Drum\n\n1999 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“Words were not given to man in order to conceal his thoughts”\n\n― José Saramago\n\n1998 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“A theatre, a literature, an artistic expression that does not speak for its own time has no relevance.”\n\n― Dario Fo\n\n1997 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“Let the people who never find true love\n\nkeep saying that there’s no such thing.\n\nTheir faith will make it easier for them to live and die.”\n\n― Wislawa Szymborska\n\nFrom View With a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems\n\n1996 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“I can’t think of a case where poems changed the world, but what they do is they change people’s understanding of what’s going on in the world.”\n\n― Seamus Heaney\n\n1995 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“…I kept trying to run away. And I almost did. But it seems that reality compels you to live properly when you live in the real world.”\n\n― Kenzaburō Ōe\n\nFrom A Personal Matter\n\n1994 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“If there’s a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.”\n\n― Toni Morrison\n\n1993 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“The future happens. No matter how much we scream.”\n\n―Derek Walcott\n\nFrom The Odyssey\n\n1992 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“The truth isn’t always beauty, but the hunger for it is.”\n\n― Nadine Gordimer\n\n1991 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“Love is an attempt to penetrate another being, but it can only be realized if the surrender is mutual.”\n\n― Octavio Paz\n\nFrom The Labyrinth of Solitude and Other Writing\n\n1990 Nobel Literature Prize Winner\n\n“I’m not made to philosophize, I don’t have the heart for it.
