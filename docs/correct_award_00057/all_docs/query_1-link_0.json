        "text": "Karl Adolph Gjellerup\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1917\n\nResidence at the time of the award: Denmark\n\nPrize motivation: “for his varied and rich poetry, which is inspired by lofty ideals”\n\nLanguage: Danish\n\nPrize share: 1/2\n\nLife\n\nKarl Gjellerup was born in Præstø, Denmark. The son of a parson, Gjellerup studied theology, but after coming under the influence of Darwinism and the ideas of fellow countryman Georg Brandes, he thought of himself as an atheist. In later years, he once again searched for religion, finding inspiration for his writing in Buddhism. In 1923, Gjellerup settled in Dresden.\n\nWork\n\nKarl Gjellerup’s first novel, An Idealist, A Description of Epigonus (1878), dealt with his personal break from Christianity. His preoccupation with Buddhism is represented in Minna (1889) and The Pilgrim Kamanita (1906), an exotic tale of reincarnation set in India. Gjellerup wrote in Danish until about 1900, when he started writing solely in German, a language he thought helped him develop as an artist."
