        "text": "诺贝尔文学奖的误解\n\n(2014-04-25 14:20:32) 下一个\n\n记不清什么时候知道诺贝尔奖项中包含了文学奖，反正是很早以前就知道了，肯定是在莫言被提名为诺贝尔文学奖得主的很多很多年以前，但是不久以前才发现，所谓的诺贝尔文学奖是中国人自己的发明，诺贝尔奖项中并没有文学奖这一项，莫言得到的也不是文学奖，而是文献奖（Nobel Prize in Literature）只不过这个文献不但包含了文学，而且很不幸地，迄今为止的诺贝尔文献奖主要是颁发给了文学作品的作家。\n\n包括散文，长短诗，剧作，故事在内的各种形式的文学作品确实是人类文明中最能直接打动社会大众的心灵的写作形式，同时也是最容易被读者理解的一类作品，所以诺贝尔文献奖主要颁发给了文学作品的作家自有其合理性。但是在人类文明中，文学写作只反映了除了与物理，化学，医学，经济，及与和平有关的努力以及诺贝尔因个人感情而不喜欢的数学之外的极为广泛的文化领域的一个具有相当的局限性的一个子集，只是这个子集相对来说最容易理解而已。因此，反映了人类文明各重大领域的发展现状的诺贝尔奖的绝大多数得主都是文学作品的作家这一点本身反映了人类文明的一种不幸：作为自然界的最高进化的物种的人类在对于真理的认识上却与自然界的最原始的无机物的运动一样是受到最小阻力律制约的。这个最小阻力律在人类的认识活动中就表现为最容易理解律。\n\n当然，就如同在自然过程中最小阻力律并非永远成立一样，对于有了智能的自主性的人类来说，最容易理解律也只是一个在大范围内以大概率成立的一个相对正确的统计现象而已。之所以说这个律的成立是一种不幸是因为最容易理解的内容不但不代表最深刻最有意义的，而且很多时候会因为它的肤浅而诱使人们忽视对于深刻内涵的理解因而为人类的社会实践带来困难和灾难。在诺贝尔文献奖的问题上所表现出来的人类对于最容易理解律的屈从的不幸有着两方面的意义：首先，这表明了社会大众具有欢迎容易理解的而排斥不容易理解的内容的倾向，尽管这些不容易理解的内容中有很多是非常重要的；第二，诺贝尔文献奖评审人员本身对不容易理解的内容也具有回避的倾向。\n\n我在本文下面列出了自1901年以来历年的诺贝尔文献奖的获奖列单[1]。从这个列单中我们可以看到，不幸中的万幸是诺贝尔文献奖并没有象这个名词的中文译者可能期待的那样将它完全颁发给文学作品的作家，而是自1901年第一个诺贝尔文献奖以来的一百多次文献奖中有7次颁发给了非文学作品的作家。虽然这7次中的有些作者也曾写小说故事，但是他们在文学上的成就并非是他们得奖的主要原因，或者说他们在文献方面的主要成就不是表现在他们的小说作品上；其中也有的作者与文学基本无关。这7位非文学类的获奖作者中有一位是德国的历史文献作家（Theodor Mommsen），一位德国的哲学家（Rudolf Eucken），一位英国的政治家（英国首相丘吉尔），三位法国的哲学家（Henri Bergson，Albert Camus，Jean-Paul Sartre），和一位英国的哲学家（Bertrand Russell）。\n\n这里要顺便提一下1938年的文献奖得主，美国女作家赛珍珠（Pearl Buck）。她出生在美国的西弗吉尼亚，3岁时到中国，43岁回到美国。她因她的一系列反映中国农民生活的文学作品而获得1938年的诺贝尔文献奖。今天的华人很多熟悉高行建和莫言的反映中国文化的作品，但是对赛珍珠的作品可能就不太熟悉了。\n\n历年诺贝尔文献奖列表：\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1901 was awarded to Sully Prudhomme
