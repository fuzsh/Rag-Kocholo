His influences ranged from Christian to Darwinist to Buddhist sources, and his fiction consequently explores the issues of the human soul, the nature of existence, and fate. Among his more successful efforts are the play Brynhild and the novel Der Pilgrimen Kamanita. Though popular in their day, Gjellerup's works are infrequently read today, and the Nobel Prize he won was little noted because at the time the world's attention was focused on World War I.\n\nBorn in Denmark, Gjellerup's first major influence was a relative named Johannes Fibiger, a clergyman who raised the boy from the age of three after his father died. From Fibiger, Gjellerup learned to be a scholar, being exposed to music, literature, and philosophy from all around the world. Fibiger's influence also led Gjellerup to study theology at the University of Copenhagen. While he was a student he was greatly influenced by Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, and by the time he graduated he had become an atheist. In his early works, including En Idealist and Arvelighed og moral, the author's belief in evolution and science over religion and mysticism is clear. His Germanernes Laerling, furthermore, is an obviously fictionalized novel about \"a young theologian dealing with a crisis of faith,\" as an essayist for the Encyclopedia of World Biography Supplement observed.\n\nAs he matured, Gjellerup became increasingly concerned with the concepts of free will, fate, and the human condition. After moving from his native Denmark to settle in Germany, he fell under the influence of the writers Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich von Schiller and began a deeper philosophical exploration of the underlying truths of the universe and existence. Fate comes into play in the romantic tragedies Brynhild and Wuthhorn, both of which are about lovers who find themselves torn apart from each other by circumstances beyond their control. In another love story, the novel Minna, Gjellerup injects his own experience of divorce from his first wife in writing about another doomed relationship. By the 1880s, when these works were being released, Gjellerup had found great popular success; along with this came a government pension, which left him financially comfortable and able to focus on his writing.\n\nIn the early 1900s the author began exploring new ground as he studied Buddhist theology. This can be clearly seen in his lyrical novel Der Pilgrimen Kamanita. The novel, once again about two lovers who are painfully separated from each other, is set in India. It explores the Buddhist notions of life, death, and rebirth as the lovers become reunited only after they have died. For this and many other contributions, Gjellerup was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1917; two years later he passed away.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nEncyclopedia of World Biography Supplement, Volume 25, Thomson Gale (Detroit, MI), 2005.\n\nONLINE"
