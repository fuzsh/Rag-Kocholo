        "text": "The Journal of the Midwest Modern Language Association, 2000\n\nBy Richard Jewell\n\nThrough the decades the Nobel Prize in literature has been criticized negatively as being at best a popularity contest and at worst a political event run by second-rate provincials who know too little about literature beyond their own borders, and in addition are almost exclusively white and male. Yet when one of our own--a U.S. author--wins, as for example Toni Morrison for 1993, many critics in this country may grumble, but most are willing to gather to congratulate the winner and, more often than not, agree that the candidate, though of course chosen from a field of equally excellent candidates in this country and others, is reasonably deserving. Are the Nobels in literature fair--that is, are winners chosen justly to represent the best of world literature? Part of the answer to this question lies in determining what is the literary canon. One can argue that the history of the Nobels in literature is in fact a history of how the literary canon has been--and will be--determined. In recent years in the awarding of the prize in literature, it is quite clear that there has developed a greater effort not only to include nonwhite and female authors, but also to redefine the meaning of good--canonical--literature in accordance with literary values displayed by nonwhite and female authors when their writings differ from those of the traditional canon. This paper examines these issues first by looking at a description of the literary prize, then at the history of the political and aesthetic judgements made in awarding the prize, and finally at contemporary fairness and canonicity. ...Read more\n\nRelated Papers\n\nThis paper discusses Pramoedya Ananta Toer (hereafter Pram) as an example of a peripheral author moving towards the realm of the centre, to which the Nobel literature prize belongs. Aesthetics of laureates’ are compared with Pram’s since his first nomination in 1980/1981 within a framework of centre/periphery relations, the criteria applied by the Swedish Academy and international cultural politics.\n\nDownload\n\nUsing the Nobel Prize as a prism through which to view the life and literature of a difficult-to-define artist, this article argues that Dylan’s output is one in which life and literature become, and have always been, indistinguishable. It is the life which has made the literature, through years lived in a particular niche of 1960s counter-cultural history; the lyrics gave voice to a man who was never at ease in the formalities of interview. For a supposed spokesman of a generation Dylan spoke very little except through his songs. So too in the more difficult-to-define later decades, little of his life was spoken of except through song, and some samplings of autobiography. Detailing the historically distinctive features of the Nobel Prize, the article shows how Bob Dylan has, through life and literature, broken down the boundaries between the literary and the popular. The article’s title is drawn, of course, from a famous line in Bob Dylan’s era-defining “Like a Rolling Stone,” one ...\n\nDownload\n\nTher Polish Review , 2021\n\nReading the Nobel Prize Lectures delivered by Polish Nobel laureates in literature from 1905 to 2019 as one mutually influencing narrative (the so-called \"collective narrative\") clearly suggests the changing direction of how Polish writers perceive the world, Poland, and the social obligations of literature towards humanity. The early focus on Poland's loss of independence and the injustice of fate (Henryk Sienkiewicz) gave way to seeing the entire world as a unity (Wisława Szymborska, Czesław Miłosz, Olga Tokarczuk). The mutually exclusive participation in life and being a detached observer. although seen as an insolvable contradiction (Miłosz) is acknowledged. but now with the urgent need for an engagement with the world's fate (Szymbo-rska, Tokarczuk). Literature is seen as a vehicle for painful memory and the acknowledgment of the injustices of the twentieth century (Miłosz), a tool of analysis of the human and non-human condition in general (Szymborska), and as a way of telling stories that represents the only remaining path to universal human understanding and bond (Tokarczuk). For Tokarczuk, \"the tender narrator\" represents the powerful connection necessary for searching I would like to thank those without whose help this article could not be written as I worked on it during the coronavirus pandemic, in almost completely locked-down London (first lockdown) and edited it during the third lockdown.

Einstein nominated other eleven scientists, and all them were Nobel Prizes laureates. We also examine and discuss the Nobel Peace Prize Nominators and Nominees from 1901 to 1964. Just taking into account data up to the year of the Nobel Prize, the highest number of nominations was awarded to an organization, the Permanent International Peace Bureau in 1910, with a total of 103 nominations, followed by two women: Bertha von Suttner (101 nominations, 1905) and Jane Addams (91 nominations, 1931). Data show that the average number of nominations per Nobel Prize awarded was 17.7, and only 18 of the total 62 laureates exceed this average. At the other extreme there were often prizewinners who had just zero, one, two or three nominations-a highly subjective indicator. We also verified that there were at least 25 nominations by National Parliaments, there were determinants for some winners. Considering the results presented, it is possible to affirm that Rondon received sufficient nominations to be awarded the Nobel Prize, even not considering Einstein's letter.\n\nDownload\n\nSamuel Beckett Today/Aujourd'hui, 2018\n\nSuzanne Beckett’s shocked response to the news of her husband’s Nobel Prize has gone down in history: it was, she declared, “a catastrophe.” This paper follows Suzanne’s lead and reads Beckett’s 1982 play Catastrophe as Beckett’s reaction to his receipt of the Nobel Prize. Catastrophe is not only Beckett’s meditation on his painful experience of media exposure and institutional manipulation; it is also his caustic response to the Swedish Academy labelling him an “idealistic” writer of “compassion” and “inner purification.” La réponse stupéfaite de Suzanne Beckett à la nouvelle du Prix Nobel de son mari est restée dans les annales: elle a déclaré que c’était une “catastrophe.” Cet article suit l’exemple de Suzanne et interprète la pièce Catastrophe (1982) comme la réaction du dramaturge à son Prix Nobel. Catastrophe est une méditation de Beckett sur son expérience douloureuse d’une exposition aux médias et à la manipulation institutionnelle. Elle est aussi sa réponse caustique au fait que l’Académie suédoise l’a qualifié d’un écrivain “idéaliste” de “la compassion” et “la purification intérieure.”\n\nDownload\n\n“Through Me Tell the Story”: A New Historical Analysis of Bob Dylan’s Rock Poetry, 2018\n\nMaster's thesis.\n\nDownload"
