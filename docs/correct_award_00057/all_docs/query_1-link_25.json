        "text": "Karl Gjellerup (June 2, 1857 - October 13, 1919) was a Danish poet and novelist who together with his compatriot Henrik Pontoppidan won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1917. In Denmark Gjellerup's award was received with little enthusiasm. He had been regarded long as a German writer. Because Sweden was neutral during World War I, the divided prize did not arouse political speculations about partial decision, but showed on the other hand allegiance between the Nordic neighbors.\n\nExternal links\n\nhttp://www.nobel-winners.com/Literature/karl_gjellerup.html\n\nTemplate:Gutenberg authorda:Karl Adolph Gjellerup"
