        "text": "Karl Adolph Gjellerup (born June 2, 1857, Roholte, Den.—died Oct. 11, 1919, Klotzsche, Ger.) was a Danish poet and novelist who shared the 1917 Nobel Prize for Literature with his compatriot Henrik Pontoppidan.\n\nThe son of a parson, Gjellerup studied theology, although, after coming under the influence of Darwinism and the new radical ideas of the critic Georg Brandes, he thought of himself as an atheist. This atheism, which turned out to be no more than a break with Christianity, was proclaimed in his first book En Idealist Shildring af Epigonus (1878; “An Idealist, A Description of Epigonus”) and in his farewell to theology, Germanernes lærling (1882; “The Teutons’ Apprentice”). The latter, however, indicated the path that was to take him, via German idealist philosophy and Romanticism, back to a conscious search for religion, which finally found its satisfaction in his preoccupation with Buddhism and other Oriental religions. This last period is represented by two books: Minna (1889), a novel of contemporary Germany, where Gjellerup lived in his later years, and Pilgrimen Kamanita (1906; The Pilgrim Kamanita), an exotic tale of reincarnation set in India."
