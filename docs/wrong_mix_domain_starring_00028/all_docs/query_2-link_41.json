        "text": "By Peterson Gonzaga And Angela Dawson\n\nEntertainment News Wire\n\nAdam G. Sevani was born five years after the late great hoofer Fred Astaire died. But in “Step Up 3D,” the newest installment of the hit “Step Up” franchise, the 18-year-old delivers a remarkable dance number with co-star Alyson Stoner that recalls one of the classic silver screen performances of the man dubbed Daddy Long Legs and his frequent dance partner, Ginger Rogers.\n\nOf course, Sevani, who also appeared in “Step Up 2 the Streets,” had to do a little research before tackling his showstopping number. The dark-haired, dark-eyed native Angeleno comes from good musical stock: His father is a world-renowned choreographer and his mother is an accomplished musician. As Sevani says, he not only loves to dance, he feels compelled to do it.\n\nWhen you were making “Step Up 2 the Streets,” did you expect a “Step Up 3” to follow?\n\nTo be honest, I did. We (cast members) were joking around. We were saying, “Step Up 2 the Streets” was a hokey title, so we said the next one will be “Step Up for Good” or “Step Up 3D.” It started off as a joke, but they started writing (“Step Up 3D”) right after. It became a reality right after.\n\nAre there any elements of Moose that you relate to?\n\nYeah, totally. A lot of people say that when they see the movie, (they think the character) is me. I’d definitely say that Moose’s persona is me, or a part of it is me.\n\nWhat dance performance is your favorite?\n\nThe Fred Astaire number I did with Alyson Stoner.\n\nDid you have to research all things Fred Astaire?\n\nYeah. To be honest with you, I didn’t know who he was. I had kind of heard about him, but I hadn’t seen his movies because they are kind of old. But I dug up my dad’s old Fred Astaire tapes, and now I find him super-inspiring. He’s, like, one of the best dancers. I’m so inspired by him now.\n\nYou and Alyson have known each other off screen for a quite a while. There is a scene where you and she get close — was that awkward for you?\n\nOf course it was. Alyson is like my little sister. We had to reshoot that scene so many times because I was giggling too much in the original take.\n\nDid she kind of feel the same way?\n\nNo. She was like, “Uh, let’s get this over with. You gotta kiss me.” But I just couldn’t stop giggling.\n\nWhat are the most memorable or enjoyable moments of doing these “Step Up” films?\n\nI don’t remember shooting anything in particular because there was so much that was happening. The most memorable moments for me are watching the movies and being impressed by them. It’s that moment when you see it all come together as a film, watching it.\n\nYou’ve collaborated with other dancers, such as Chris Brown, with some YouTube clips. How did that come about?\n\nThose started out as a joke. We saw some people doing stuff on YouTube, and me and (“Step Up 3D” director) Jon M. Chu said, “We can do this.” So we did it as a joke, and the clips blew up.\n\nWhat direction do you see your career going — acting or dancing?\n\nDancing is something I do. Not something I just want to do. It’s something I just do depending on how I’m feeling. I don’t see myself taking that as just a job. I’ve done these movies because they happen to have dancing in them.\n\nWhen kids come up to you and tell you they want to dance, what advice do you give them?\n\nJust recently, some woman came up to me and said, “My daughter has always wanted to dance but she felt overweight and embarrassed to dance. But ever since she saw you dancing, she’s lost 25 pounds. She was inspired by you.” To me, if you have that drive, why not pursue it? That actually inspires me more to do what I do."
