Hilary Duff played the title character as a typical 13-year-old girl who is trying to navigate life in school. The show also used an animated version of Lizzie who helped to explain some of the character’s inner thoughts. The show ended up being a funny, down-to-earth look at growing up. It also set some of the formulas for future Disney Channel shows like Hannah Montana, The Wizards of Waverly Place, and more.\n\nYou can also check out The Lizzie McGuire Movie on Disney Plus.\n\nReady to watch?

Star Wars: The Clone Wars was made originally for kids, but it grew into a very complex look at the Star Wars universe. We got introduced to new characters. We also got reintroduced to some older characters, particularly Darth Maul, in new incarnations. The final result was that this “kids show” turned out to be far better than the prequel films that spawned it.\n\nYou can watch all of the episodes, including the final season, on the service.

Dodd, Cedric Smith, Norm Spencer, Catherine Disher, George Buza, Lenore Zann, Alyson Court\n\nGenre: Animation, Action, Adventure\n\nIMDB rating: 8.4\n\nDisney acquired the rights to this series when it bought Marvel. This X-Men series was shown first on Fox in its original run. Like another show on Fox, Batman: The Animated Series, this show took itself very seriously. It adapted many of the great storylines from the original X-Men comics and offered serialized storylines as well.\n\nThe success of X-Men on Fox was likely why the first X-Men live-action feature film was finally given the green light a few years later. It’s not a stretch to say that X-Men paved the way for the current superhero boom in films and TV.\n\nReady to watch?

As played by Pedro Pascal, he’s a man who is not to be crossed as he takes his assignments.
