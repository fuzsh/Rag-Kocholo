        "text": "Early Life\n\nStars are not born with a silver spoon in their mouth, but they are shaped by determination, hard work and a desire to achieve success. A tweener star and a Toledo native, who have gained popularity during the 2000s, Alyson Stoner, is little above 21 years of age, but she earned fame in Hollywood even before she turned 10.The story of her life inspires many of how a child can do wonders in the industry with a will to taste success.\n\nStoner was born on August 11, 1993 and started studying tap, ballet and jazz dance at the age of 3 only, in Holland Ohio. 3 years later, she started taking modeling lessons in Toledo at the Margaret O’Brien Modeling Studio. It was her hard work and passion that earned her the title of ‘Model of the Year’ at the Convention of International Modeling & Talent Association (IMTA) in NYC.\n\nAt the present age of 21, Alyson has a number of creditable works attached to her portfolio, which started with her first appearance in the music video ‘Work It’ from Missy Elliot in 2002. After this debut, she performed for Elliot Videos, ‘Pass That Dutch’ & ‘Gossip Folks’ in 2003 and ‘I’m Really Hot’ in 2004.\n\n\"Honestly, what keeps me grounded is my faith and my value system\"-Alyson Rae Stoner\n\nCareer"
