        "text": "CGTV is an exclusive TV & Film Training Program that teaches the necessary skills to be successful in the industry as well as providing mentoring and networking opportunities not found elsewhere. Participants are selected based on their natural talents through an audition process including script reads. Participants then take an online course to learn the ropes of audition techniques, self-promotion and marketing within the industry. Our course curriculum can be viewed here. A week of in-person training follows and includes mentoring by industry veterans. The program concludes with a Grand Finale Showcase; where founder Adrian R’Mante’s extensive industry contacts are in attendance, allowing the graduates to network further and create career opportunities.\n\nThe program is for educational purposes only. This is not an audition or guarantee of work. The presence of a Talent Agent or industry professional is not a guarantee or implication of a job offer of any kind. We are not offering employment, a job opportunity or an audition, only training. We are bonded in the State of California. BOND# S9141930"
