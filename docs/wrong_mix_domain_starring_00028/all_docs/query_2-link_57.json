        "text": "Nineties kids rejoice! A handful of notable Disney Channel alumni reunited Wednesday (April 4) in celebration of Lemonade Mouth star Hayley Kiyoko‘s birthday.\n\nAmong the meetup included Cole Sprouse, Alyson Stoner, Debby Ryan and Demi Lovato, as evidenced by a nostalgia-inducing group shot posted on Instagram. Anyone who watched Disney Channel during their era is undoubtedly celebrating.\n\nThe photo was shared by Matthew Scott Montgomery from So Random! the sans-Lovato spinoff of Sonny With a Chance. Sprouse, famed for playing the more logical half of The Suite Life of Zack and Cody title characters, went on to graduate from NYU with honors alongside his twin brother Dylan before starring in CW’s Riverdale.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nStoner, who also portrayed a Suite Life recurring character, made headlines last month after penning a heartfelt essay for Teen Vogue in which she opened up about her sexuality. Ryan portrayed Sprouse’s love interest on Suite Life spinoff, The Suite Life on Deck, before temporarily becoming the real-life love interest of Twenty One Pilots drummer Josh Dun.\n\nThe photo only has us yearning for more golden-era Disney Channel reunions in the near future."
