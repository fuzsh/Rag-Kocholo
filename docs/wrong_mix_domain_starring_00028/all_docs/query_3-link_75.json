        "text": "ALYSON Stoner played Sarah Baker in the chaotic family film Cheaper By The Dozen in 2003.\n\nThat won't be the only reason you know her though - the previous year she'd showed off her impressive dance moves in the video for Missy Elliot's hit Work It when she was just nine.\n\nThe dancing didnâ€™t stop there as Alyson also appeared in many Disney channel shows like The Suite Life Of Zac And Cody and the original Step Up film.\n\nAlyson is best from her role in Cheaper By The Dozen, playing the mischievous tomboy Sarah - who she went on to play in a second and third sequel film about the huge family with eleven children.\n\nNow, the star is all grown up - and looks completely different from her childhood acting days, often wowing her fans with glamorous selfies on Instagram.\n\nAlyson is also often a regular feature on celebrity red carpets - as well as making guest appearances on a number of talk shows, including America's The Today Show last week.\n\nOf course she's changed quite a bit over the years, and is now 28 with a big social media following.\n\nAlyson uses Instagram to posts pictures of her daily life, ranging from sultry modelling shots to short videos of her dance moves.\n\nJust this week, the star posed for a series of glamorous modelling pictures from a photoshoot in New York's Central Park.\n\nWhile she also gives fans a sneak peek into her workout routine - with her treadmill under her desk at home.\n\nEarlier this month we showed you what 'Janis Ian' from mean girls looks like now.\n\nAnd you can see how the kids from Mrs. Doubtfire have changed over the years here."
