        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton WRITTEN BY: Emma Schell\n\nIt's been well over a dozen years since we last saw the Cheaper by the Dozen cast. Where are they now? For this list, we'll be catching up with the actors behind the Baker family. Our countdown includes Bonnie Hunt, Tom Welling, Hilary Duff, and more!\n\nThis family is one we’d like to be a part of. Welcome to MsMojo, and today we’re looking at the Cheaper by the Dozen Cast: Where Are They Now?\n\nFor this list, we’ll be looking at what the Cheaper by the Dozen cast has been up to since their days as the Baker family.\n\n#13: Shane & Brent Kinsman\n\nThese two trouble makers captured our hearts as the youngest children of the Baker clan, playing Nigel and Kyle Baker at just 5 years old. While they haven't done much since their roles in CBTD, they did find success playing the Scavo twins on “Desperate Housewives” from 2004 to 2008. They were even nominated for 4 SAG awards, winning for ‘Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a TV Series’. According to an interview with California Polytechnic State University’s Mustang News, both have fond memories of their time in the movie and its sequel.\n\n#12: Blake Woodruff\n\nAfter playing karate-loving son Mike Baker in CBTD, Blake Woodruff went on to appear in movies like “Whisper”, where he starred as a young boy held captive by an ex-con, and the Hallmark Channel’s “Back To You and Me”. On TV, Blake played a small role in \"The Young and The Restless” as Noah Newman, the son of Nicholas and Sharon Newman, from 2004 to 2005. Although Woodruff took a break from acting for 10 years to lead a normal life, he returned to the big screen in 2017, appearing in the horror film \"Victor Crowley\".\n\n#11: Forrest Landis\n\nMark Baker - or as the other Baker kids like to call him, Fed-Ex - had a central role in CBTD as the black sheep of the Baker clan. But what is Mark Baker - aka Forrest Landis - doing now? Before he quit acting in 2008, Landis played the protagonist in \"Spy School\" alongside AnnaSophia Robb and had minor parts on hit shows like \"ER\" and \"Boston Legal”. Landis can now be seen on his Instagram shredding up Indianapolis skate parks, and, according to his bio is working with Minus Skate Shop.\n\n#10: Morgan York\n\nIn CBTD, York plays half of the fraternal set of Baker twins, Jessica and Kim. Despite quitting acting in 2010, Morgan went on to have one of the most successful acting careers out of the Baker kids, starring in \"The Pacifier'' alongside Vin Diesel and in her final role as the recurring character Sarah in the hit Disney Channel show ''Hannah Montana''. Since quitting acting in 2010, Morgan has been working as a young adult fantasy writer and can be seen streaming on Twitch part-time; she also got married in July 2019!\n\n#9: Liliana Mumy\n\nSince appearing in CBTD as Jessica Baker, Liliana Mumy has gone on to lend her voice to a number of animated films and TV series. In terms of film, she voiced Rosebud in the sequels to the \"Air Buddies'' movies, \"Snow Buddies'', \"Space Buddies\", and “Santa Buddies”; while on TV she’s had a recurring role on Nickelodeon’s \"The Loud House\" and the web series \"Bravest Warriors\". She also continued her role in \"The Santa Clause '' franchise after CBTD, appearing in \"The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause'' in 2006.\n\n#8: Jacob Smith\n\nThis Baker kid actually ended his acting career shortly after CBTD2 premiered in 2005, with his final role being in the pilot episode for “Secrets of a Small Town” starring Angie Harmon and Leighton Meister. Prior to his role as Jake Baker, Jacob Smith could be seen in “Hansel and Gretel” with costars Taylor Momsen and Dakota Fanning, and \"Troy\" with Brad Pitt. Most recently, Smith can be seen in an interview with his college, Charis Bible College, posted to youtube in 2019; in the interview, Jacob talks about overcoming drug addiction and his relationship to God.\n\n#7: Alyson Stoner\n\nBefore Alyson Stoner was playing troublemaker Sarah Baker in CBTD, she was capturing our hearts with her dancing skills in Missy Elliot's \"Work It\" music video; in fact, the video is still so popular that Stoner was brought onstage by Elliot during her performance at the 2019 VMAs, almost two decades after it’s premiere in 2002. Alyson has also found tremendous success as an actress, getting leading roles in major movies such as \"Step Up\" and the \"Camp Rock\" franchise, as well as the TV shows \"Phineas and Ferb\" and \"Suite Life of Zack & Cody\". Alyson can also be found posting on her own “personal transformation”-themed YouTube channel, which has garnered over 600,000 subscribers.\n\n#6: Kevin G. Schmidt\n\nKevin Schmidt, CBTD’s clarinet playing Henry Baker, has continued working in the entertainment industry, snagging roles in movies like \"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel\" and \"Princess Protection Program\". As well, he's had starring roles on the TV shows \"Unnatural History\" and, like CBTD co-star Blake Woodruff, also played Noah Newman on \"The Young and the Restless\". According to his Instagram, Kevin is now working on the Hapbee Company, a business he founded with “Spy Kids” actress Alexa PenaVega, Carlos PenaVega, and his brother Kendall - of Big Time Rush fame. The company sells all-natural hygiene products including toothpaste, deodorant, and multiple skincare products.\n\n#5: Hilary Duff\n\nAppearing in CBTD at the height of her career, Hilary Duff has garnered worldwide fame as both a singer and actress. After CBTD, her starring role on the hit Disney Channel show \"Lizzie McGuire'' ended in 2004 and she went on to get leading roles in movies like \"A Cinderella Story\" and \"The Perfect Man\", as well as in shows like \"Younger\" and \"Gossip Girl\". When she wasn’t acting, Duff was going on worldwide tours and creating hit singles like “So Yesterday” and “Come Clean” - and let’s be honest, we still know all the words to this day. In her personal life, Duff had a son, Luca, in 2012, and in 2018 welcomed daughter Banks. Hilary is set to appear in a reboot of the Lizzie McGuire series, and when that eventually gets off the ground it will surely bring back all of our childhood nostalgia!\n\n#4: Tom Welling\n\nIt’s safe to say that Tom Welling was one of the biggest heartthrobs of his generation - and his role as eldest son Charlie Baker is partly to thank for that. After CBTD, Welling continued his starring role as Clark Kent in CW's hit show 'Smallville' - which ended its 10-year run in 2011. Despite the show ending nearly a decade ago, Tom recently returned to his role as Superman’s alter ego for an episode of CW’s Batwoman in December 2019. He’s since continued acting in movies and TV outside of the “Smallville” realm, starring in 2016's 'The Choice'. He’s also had a recurring role on Netflix's “Lucifer” as L.A.P.D. Lieutenant Marcus Pierce.\n\n#3: Piper Perabo\n\nSince appearing as the oldest Baker child in CBTD, Perabo has gone on to appear in the movie \"Looper'' and snagged a leading role on the show \"Covert Affairs\", which ended in 2014. When she’s not pursuing acting, the “Coyote Ugly” actress can be found on Instagram using her platform to advocate for causes like action against climate change and encouraging her followers to go out and vote come election time. Her social activism efforts don’t stop there; she was recently arrested at Jane Fonda’s “Fire Drill Fridays” climate change protest alongside fellow actress Diane Lane and actor Manny Jacinto.\n\n#2: Bonnie Hunt\n\nSince starring as the matriarch of the Baker family, Bonnie Hunt has found great success as a voice actor for Pixar, starring in some of their biggest franchises - including \"Cars\", \"Monsters, Inc.\" and \"Toy Story\"; as well as Disney’s Oscar-winning movie \"Zootopia\". Hunt was also given her own talk show, \"The Bonnie Hunt Show\", which ran from 2008 to 2010 and was frequented by her CBTD co-stars. In 2018, Bonnie starred in the Showtime limited series “Escape at Dannemora”, where she played real-life Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott alongside Patricia Arquette, Benicio Del Toro, and Paul Dano.\n\n#1: Steve Martin\n\nSince adding CBTD to his very impressive acting resume, this legendary comedian has appeared as Inspector Clouseau in \"The Pink Panther\" films, and as a romantic lead in the 2009 romantic comedy \"It’s Complicated\". Like co-star Bonnie Hunt, he’s also done his fair share of hosting since his time as Tom Baker, co-hosting the Academy Awards for the third time in 2010 with Alec Baldwin and serving as guest-host on Saturday Night Live an astonishing total of 15 times. More recently, Steve appeared alongside his longtime friend Martin Short on their comedy tour turned Netflix special, \"Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget For The Rest Of Your Life\"."
