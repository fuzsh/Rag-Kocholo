Now as an adult, Alyson has taken up the mantle of advocate, pushing for more safety and protection measures for child stars who have been thrust into the limelight.\n\nOn the FOX News Rundown Extra, you’ll hear the full conversation with Alyson Stoner about the difficult experiences child stars suffer through, the legislation they are helping push to protect children from exploitation from influencers and media companies, and the mental toll the entertainment industry can take on child stars."
