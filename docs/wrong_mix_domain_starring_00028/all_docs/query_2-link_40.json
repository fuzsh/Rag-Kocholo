        "text": "Logan Lerman\n\nJimmy Townsend, a teenager that got into trouble for being in the wrong place and wrong time, was arrested for breaking and entering. He thought he was getting off when he was ordered to work at a summer camp in Montana- but was he wrong. Along with his new friends, Scott and Tara, he tries to figure out a way to escape.\n\nBorn and raised in Beverly Hills, Logan Lerman wanted to become an actor at an early age. So he told his mother of his desire to be an actor when he was 2 1/2 years old. At the age of 4, Logan had an agent and was booked for two commercials. His first appearance on the big screen was as William, the youngest son of Mel Gibson's character in The Patriot (2000). Also in 2000, he appeared with the same actor (Gibson), this time as the younger version of his character Nick Marshall, in What Women Want (2000). After a small role in 2001's Riding in Cars with Boys (2001), he starred in John Grisham's A Painted House (2003) (TV). His most recent work on the silver screen is his portrait as the younger version of Ashton Kutcher's character Evan in The Butterfly Effect (2004). After making his small screen debut in a guest-starring role in \"10-8: Officers on Duty\" (2003), he stars as Bobby (Robert) McAllister in \"Jack & Bobby\" (2004), where he portrays a teenager who will be a future president of the United States.\n\nLogan now is about to make his first headlining feature in the brand new Film Escaping Westwood (2009), as a troubled teen having to work at a camp, but finds out it was more then he signed up for, and with others he plans an escape.\n\nWhen Logan is not working, he likes to play soccer and baseball. He is a LA Lakers fan and, even though he plays mostly dramatic roles, he enjoys playing pranks on his friends.\n\nAlyson Stoner\n\nTara Crawford has always been known for her attitude and sarcasm. She was always in and out of trouble until it all caught up with her. She was detained and charged with defacing statues in front of the Museum of Modern Art, in San Francisco. She was shipped off by her parents to Camp Westwood with the warning that she better shape up, or not to bother returning home.\n\nAlyson Stoner was born in Toledo, Ohio. While growing up, she studied ballet, tap, and jazz dancing at the O'Connell's Dance Studio in her hometown. She also modeled and trained at the Margaret O'Brien Modeling Studio there. She even attended the IMTA Convention in New York City with Ms. O'Brien's studio in 2000, and she won many awards in acting, modeling, and dance. After this, Alyson decided to try hip-hop dancing. She moved to LA and trained with such well-known choreographers as Wade Robson, Fatima, and Hi Hat. She auditioned and was cast to dance in the Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott videos \"Work It\" and \"Gossip Folks.\" Because of these videos, Alyson has been in demand by such media outlets as \"Extra\" (1994), \"The Maury Povich Show\" (1991), \"Ellen: The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" (2003), and magazines such as \"YM\" and \"M.\" She performed on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" (1992), and with 'Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott' at the 2003 American Music Awards, on \"MTV's Fashionably Loud,\" and Seattle's Radio Concert. Not only is Alyson a talented dancer, she is also the co-host of the Disney Channel's \"Super Short Show\" (2002), an infomercial segment that sells upcoming DVD and Video releases of Disney features.\n\nNow Alyson is staring in the New Movie Escaping Westwood (2009) as Tara Crawford, and is looking forward to taking her fans on another crazy adventure- but in this one, the stakes are higher then ever.\n\nMoises Arias\n\nScott Torres never had the life he wanted, so he made his own luck. He learned to pick-pocket from a young age, which led to stealing and conning his way to the top. He was caught with the wrong crowd, and was busted for car-jacking a Porsche. He has been to Camp Westwood multiple times, and is one of the most troublesome kids at the camp.\n\nMoises Arias is an American actor. His career has included guest appearances on shows such as Sister Sister, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, One Missed Call and a recurring appearance as Rico on Hannah Montana, where he became a series regular in the show's second season as a shop owner on the beach. As a regular on the Disney Channel, Arias participated on the first and second Disney Channel Games on the red team. He also participated in the third Disney Channel games on the Yellow Team (Comets). He has also appeared in music videos for Pearl Jam, Jonas Brothers (SOS), and Parmalee, and the movie Nacho Libre. (2006) other films include the straight to DVD film, Beethoven’s Big Break (2008) and upcoming Disney movies, Dad napped (2009), The Perfect Game (2009), the Hannah Montana Movie(2009) and Escaping Westwood (2009)\n\nEscaping Westwood is Arias' biggest movie premier, and is hoping to particpate in more movies with Universal Pictures.\n\nDavid Spade\n\nBruce Bassett, has been running Camp Westwood since he was left it from his late father. He has made changes to the camp to make it run smoother. Along with his crazy Uncle Bob and a mischievous staff, he has set out to make kids work, and pay for the things they have done at home.\n\nComic brat extraordinaire David Spade was born on July 22, 1964, in Birmingham, Michigan, the youngest of three brothers. Raised in both Scottsdale (from age four) and Casa Grande, Arizona, he graduated with a degree in business from Arizona State University in 1986. A natural prankster most of his life, Spade was pushed immediately into stand-up comedy by friends and appeared in nightclubs and college campuses all over the country.\n\nA casting agent saw his routine at \"The Improv\" in Los Angeles and offered him a mischievous role in the film Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol (1987). In 1990, the diminutive, flaxen-haired comedian finally hit the big time as a regular cast member and writer on \"Saturday Night\" (1975). Slow at first in gaining acceptance on the show, his razor-sharp sarcasm eventually caught on by his second season, when he played a number of smart-aleck characters in a variety of sketches, including a highly disinterested airline steward who bids each passenger adieu with a very sardonic \"buh-bye\" and an irritating receptionist for Dick Clark Productions who greets each huge celebrity with an unknowing \"And you are . . . ?\"\n\nFollowing his SNL departure after six years, he spun off into a slapstick movie career, most noticeably as the scrawny, taciturn foil to SNL's wild and crazy big boy Chris Farley in Tommy Boy (1995) and Black Sheep (1996). The teaming of this unlikely but funny pair ended with Farley's death from a 1997 drug overdose. Since then, Spade has appeared in his own lukewarm vehicles, including Joe Dirt (2001) and Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star (2003). More recently he teamed with former SNL member Rob Schneider on the film The Benchwarmers (2006). Television has been more accepting over the years, with Spade earning an Emmy nomination as the droll, skirt-chasing secretary Dennis Finch on \"Just Shoot Me!\" (1997) and filling in after the untimely death of John Ritter on ABC's \"8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter\" (2002) as Katey Sagal's unprincipled nephew.\n\nMore recently he was the star of the Comedy Central show \"The Showbiz Show with David Spade\" (2005) in 2005 wherein he more or less resurrected his obnoxious, razor-tongued gossipmonger from the old \"Hollywood Minute\" put-down segment on SNL, as well as co-starring in the adult-oriented ensemble sitcom \"Rules of Engagement\" (2007).\n\nNow Making his return to the big screen after 10 years, plays a smart, and cross Camp director, with aa axe to the grind, in Escaping Westwood (2009)\n\nChristopher Lloyd\n\nBob Bassett, has been working at Camp Westwood for over 25 years, and is known to be not the brightest bulb in the box. He is content working for his Nephew Bruce. He does everything he is asked, and is easily is persuaded by the campers to do things; normally resulting in a lecture from his nephew that the campers are not here for a fun time.\n\nLloyd was born in Stamford, Connecticut, the son of Ruth (née Lapham), a singer who was the sister of San Francisco mayor Roger Lapham, and Samuel R. Lloyd, a lawyer.[1][2] He attended the Fessenden School, a preparatory school in Newton, Massachusetts. Lloyd was raised in New Canaan, Connecticut and Westport, Connecticut where he graduated from Staples High School in 1958. His mother, Ruth, donated Waveny Park to the town of New Canaan.\n\nLloyd seldom appears in public or gives interviews (he gave a rare interview on Channel 4's 100 Greatest Family Films in 2005). Some of his best friends, co-stars [who?] and fans who have met him describe Lloyd as a very shy and quiet man. His nephew, Sam Lloyd, is best known for playing Ted Buckland, the lawyer on Scrubs. Christopher Lloyd was married from February 1992 to December 2005 to writer/producer Jane Walker Wood; this was his third marriage. His namesake, Chris Lloyd, is not related but is actually the son of sitcom writer David Lloyd. He is a fan of fly fishing. Lloyd's home was destroyed by the California Wildfires of November 2008 in Montecito.\n\nHe began acting by age 14 and started apprenticing in summer stock. He took acting classes in New York City at age 19, some at the Neighborhood Playhouse with Sanford Meisner. He appeared in several Broadway productions, including Happy End, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Red, White and Maddox, Kaspar, The Harlot and the Hunted, The Seagull, Total Eclipse, MacBeth, In the Boom Boom Room, Cracks, Professional Resident Company, What Every Woman Knows, And They Put Handcuffs on the Flowers, The Father, King Lear, and Power Failure.\n\nHis first major motion picture role was as a psychiatric patient in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. However, he may be most remembered for his roles as Reverend Jim Ignatowski, the ex-hippie cabbie on the TV sitcom Taxi, and the eccentric inventor Emmett \"Doc\" Brown in the Back to the Future trilogy of sci-fi films, a role he has played numerous times in various spin-offs and incarnations. He also played notable roles as Klingon Commander Kruge in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, Professor Dimple in an episode of Road to Avonlea, the title role in The Pagemaster, the villain Judge Doom in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a wacky sound effects man named Zoltan in Radioland Murders, and Uncle Fester in the big screen adaptations of The Addams Family. In November 2007, Lloyd was reunited onscreen with his former Taxi co-star Judd Hirsch in the (Season 4 episode) \"Graphic\"[3] of the TV series Numb3rs. He played Ebenezer Scrooge in a 2008 production of A Christmas Carol at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles with co-stars John Goodman and Jane Leeves.\n\nActing in his first movie of 2009, Lloyd plays the charismatic, slightly crazy Uncle in Escaping Westwood.\n\nBeth Broderick"
