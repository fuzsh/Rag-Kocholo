        "text": "Many people recognize Alyson Stoner as the once 9-year-old star of Missy Elliott's \"Work It\" music video. That video, along with two other Missy Elliott projects she did shortly after, launched her career, eventually leading her to Disney stardom (via Elle). She appeared in Disney's \"Super Short Show,\" \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody,\" \"That's So Raven,\" \"Phineas and Ferb,\" and starred in the hit Disney Channel movies \"Camp Rock\" and \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose not as familiar with Disney probably recognize Stoner from her roles in the \"Cheaper by the Dozen\" films, where she plays spunky tomboy Sara Baker in both the original film and the sequel.\n\nWhen she isn't on screen, Stoner is known for her dancing and singing skills. She appeared at the 2019 VMA's to reenact her role in \"Work it\" alongside Missy Elliott and has released music of her own, including her own song titled \"Stripped Bare,\" which she released in February 2019 (via ShowBiz Cheat Sheet). Her most recent work has been in the realm of voice acting; she even voiced characters for \"Phineas and Ferb\" and \"Milo Murphy's Law.\"\n\nWith such an impressive resume behind her, how much is the young star actually worth?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlyson Stoner got her start very young, so it makes sense that she has amassed quite a bit of wealth in her time on and off the screen. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Stoner is worth about $1.5 million. The 20-something has earned her wealth through acting, singing, dancing, voice acting, and choreographing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while her net worth is impressive to many, Stoner has recently spoken out about her childhood fame, explaining that her stardom was actually an extremely negative and hurtful experience (via People). She told the outlet, \"I narrowly survived the toddler-to-trainwreck pipeline. In fact, nothing was designed for me to end up... 'Normal.' 'Stable.' 'Alive.'\"\n\nStoner also came out about her eating disorder struggles and the sexual harassment and child labor violations she faced as a young star (via Insider). Today, she is working hard to change the way child actors are treated, advocating for better working conditions and more education on how to ensure children aren't exploited by the system like she was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are struggling with an eating disorder, or know someone who is, help is available. Visit the National Eating Disorders Association website or contact NEDA's Live Helpline at 1-800-931-2237. You can also receive 24/7 Crisis Support via text (send NEDA to 741-741).\n\nIf you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available. Visit the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network website or contact RAINN's National Helpline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673)."
