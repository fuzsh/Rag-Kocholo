She is also known for her voice as Isabella in the Disney series \"Phineas and Ferb\".\n\nBiography\n\nStoner was trained at the O'Connell Dance Studio in Holland, Ohio and the Margaret O'Brien Modeling Studio. She went to Maumee Valley Country Day School in Toledo, a very elite private school. Stoner started acting in 1999, when she went to the International Modeling and Talent Association. Consequently, she received several awards for acting, modeling, and dance (including an honorable mention for best model of the year at the IMTA convention).\n\nIn 2002, Stoner became the co-host of the Disney Channel's \"Mike's Super Short Show\" along with Michael Alan Johnson, an infomercial segment regarding forthcoming Disney releases.\n\nAfter choreography training in Los Angeles, Stoner famously appeared as a background dancer in the music video for Missy Elliott's \"Work It\" and \"Gossip Folks\", as well as Eminem's \"Just Lose It\" and the lesser known \"No Tengo Dinero\" by the Kumbia Kings. She danced with a dancing group called the JammXKids between 2003 and 2006. She quit the group in early 2006 due to scheduling conflicts, but continues to work with the individual kids in different jobs. She was also one of the dancers in the special features for the \"Shark Tale\" DVD. Stoner teaches hip hop currently at millennium dance complex, and is credited as the youngest person to teach a master class there.\n\nIn 2003 and 2005, she appeared as one of the twelve Baker children (Sarah) in the successful comedies \"Cheaper by the Dozen\" and \"Cheaper by the Dozen 2\". She has also appeared in several television shows aimed at the preteen market, including \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\", \"That's So Raven\" and \"Drake and Josh\".\n\nIn 2005 Alyson recorded a cover version of the song \"Baby It's You\" by JoJo.
