Actress Alyson Stoner alleged that she was removed from a project by her previous employer Disney after she came out as pansexual.

Stoner would not reveal what project she was pulled from during her interview on the “I’m Literally Screaming With Spencewuah” podcast released in June. The 29-year-old former Disney star claimed the move was made on account of her being “unsafe” for children.

“I did end up getting fired from a children’s show because they felt that I was unsafe, now that they knew I was queer, to be around kids,” Stoner said.

Her repertoire included The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, That’s So Raven, and Phineas and Ferb, and the popular Camp Rock film.

Stoner came out in an op-ed in Teen Vogue in 2018, and anticipated blowback.

“Some people in the industry warned me that I’d ruin my career, miss out on possible jobs, and potentially put my life in danger if I ever came out,” Stoner wrote at the time.

When Stoner revealed her sexuality, she simultaneously announced that she had a girlfriend. Today she says she’s more attracted to a person’s “soul” than their gender.
