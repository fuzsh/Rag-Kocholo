American child actress Alyson Stoner started her career as a dancer, before appearing in different television shows and films. Born on August 11, 1993 in Toledo, Ohio, she trained at the OâConnell Dance Studio in Holland, Ohio and at the Margaret OâBrien Modeling Studio in Toledo. In 1999, she joined the International Modeling and Talent Associationâs convention in New York, which subsequently started her acting career.

Stonerâs first screen appearance was in 2002, through Disney Channelâs Mikeâs Super Short Show, an infomercial segment which promoted upcoming Disney films. She also trained in choreography in Los Angeles, and she subsequently appeared as a dancer for music videos such as Missy Elliottâs âWork Itâ and âGossip Folks,â and Eminemâs âJust Lost It.â In 2003, she joined the dancing group JammXKids; she left in 2006 because of scheduling conflicts, although she still collaborates with individual members.

In 2003, Stoner made her film debut as one of the Baker children in the film Cheaper By The Dozen, which stars Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt. She has since reprised the role in the 2005 sequel Cheaper By The Dozen 2, and has also appeared in the 2006 film Step Up, as Channing Tatumâs younger sister. She also made guest appearances in different pre-teen television shows such as Drake & Josh, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and Thatâs So Raven. Also notable is a guest appearance in 2006 on the NBC sitcom Joey.

Stoner has also recently gone into voice acting, providing her voice for characters in the 2004 film Garfield, as well as on the animated series Lilo & Stitch: The Series and, more recently, as Isabella on Phineas and Ferb. Her recent credits include the lead role in the straight-to-DVD film Alice Upside Down, and the Disney Channel television film Camp Rock, where she stars alongside the Jonas Brothers.
