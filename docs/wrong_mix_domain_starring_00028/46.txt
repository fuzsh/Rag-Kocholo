Alyson Stoner was 10 years old when 'Cheaper By The Dozen' made her one of the most famous kids in film and TV. As a skilled dancer at such a young age with a distinctive look; pigtails, a thick fringe, and skater sartorial repertoire, she's one of the most recognisable child stars from the 2000s.

If you grew up in the early noughties, Alyson Stoner was everywhere; 'Step Up', 'Cheaper by the Dozen', and 'Suite Life of Zack & Cody' were just some of the places she cropped up as one of the "it girls" of the moment.

Since her days as a child star, Stoner hasn't had an easy life; growing up in the public eye is famously a very difficult, often traumatising thing to do. In a recent interview reported by Entertainment Weekly, she opened up about her struggles as a kid in the limelight.

"My first kiss was on camera, in front of a crew of strangers. Also, going through puberty, suddenly I was being asked to speak and behave in these ways that felt really mature and inappropriate."

Circa 2012, when the 'Hunger Games' came out, Stoner checked herself into rehab. After undergoing a serious training regimen to try and get the role that eventually went to Jennifer Lawrence, she found herself in a dark place.

"I was so committed to the audition process that I underwent very intense physical training, and I was on a very restrictive diet. My hair is starting to fall out, my skin is sallow, and I'm medically underweight," she explained, "So I checked myself into rehab".

Nowadays, since Stoner has taken time to understand herself and her sexuality, she's still performing, and she's pretty huge on TikTok â€” she seems to be flourishing. We're so happy for her.
