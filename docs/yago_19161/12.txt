Gardner Dickinson, a founder of the Senior PGA Tour and owner of the best U.S. Ryder Cup record, died Sunday. He was 70.

Dickinson died in his sleep after a long illness at his home, said his wife Judy, a three-time president of the LPGA and a tour player. He lived in Tequesta, about 10 miles from PGA National Golf Club, where many of his colleagues were playing in the PGA Seniors’ Championship.

“He was a fierce, hard-working competitor and made up for his lack of size with his intensity and hard work,” Jack Nicklaus said.

“He not only had a gift for playing, but a gift for teaching and getting his message across.

“We will all miss Gardner and send out deepest sympathy and love to his family.”

Dickinson was a member of U.S. Ryder Cup teams in 1967 and 1971 and holds the best record in Ryder Cup history at 9-1.

In 1979, Dickinson became one of the original members of the Senior Tour Policy Board, which formally established a tour circuit for senior players.
