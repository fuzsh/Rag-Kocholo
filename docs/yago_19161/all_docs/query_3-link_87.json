        "text": "W hen Howard Dickinson III was a child in Wayne, N.J., he'd gather his Lionel trains in a wagon or on a sled and head on over to his friend's house to play.\n\nHe'd take his own lunch, because that's what you did in those days. On those cold snowy days, they'd play until 4 or so. That's when Mom signaled that he needed to clean up because Dad was coming home.\n\nHe remembers the sleet stinging his face as he plodded along with the trains.\n\nIn the summer, they'd fish off the railroad bridge until the trains came along and sprayed them with steam and hot water.\n\nHe's all grown up now, but the Pocono Lake man has never lost that boyhood love of trains, toy or real ones.\n\nDickinson, now 68, is the station master at Tobyhanna railroad station. He talks about the ice business, the tourist trade, Steamtown, Jim Thorpe and just about anything anyone wants to know.\n\nIf he doesn't know, he'll find out, as he spends his spare time reading about trains or watching videos.\n\n\"This has been all-consuming,\" he said.\n\nWhen he goes on vacation, it's to Altoona or other sites to see trains.\n\n\"People say You're crazy standing out in the cold waiting for a train,'\" he said, but he points out, \"My father was a hunter and fisherman, and he stood out in the cold waiting for a deer to go by.\"\n\nSo he spends weekends, weekdays or whatever it takes to keep the station clean so he can give tours.\n\n\"The station was originally built in the 1850s,\" Dickinson said. \"The first train came here in May 26, 1856.\"\n\nThe station was redone in 1904, because more space was need to accommodate the growing tourist trade.\n\nA porch was added in 1908, so passengers could be under shelter.\n\nSteam engines were used in the beginning, but they were dangerous, Dickinson said. \"They were just a tea kettle.\"\n\nAs the water would be heated, steam would build up, causing the potential for explosion. The engines were tied up for inspection about a third of the time. \"They were very labor intensive,\" Dickinson said.\n\nRail lines switched to diesel electrics in 1953. \"A diesel does not need that,\" he said.\n\nDickinson added that the diesel was more simplified and more efficient.\n\nIn the early days at the station, the boiler that heated the building was across the street in the switch tower. Later a small stove was added to the station, and an opening cut through for coal. \"They slid the coal right off the car and into here,\" Dickinson said, pointing to the baggage area.\n\nHe talks about the local economy, showing a map of Tobyhanna in earlier times. \"It was lumber first, then ice,\" he said. \"Ice was harvested here in lakes and ponds.\"\n\nDickinson said Brady's Lake harvested 200,000 tons of ice a year, with 150 men doing the ice cutting and 50 to 75 men employed throughout the year to load ice on the trains.\n\nThe last passenger train came through in 1968, and the station closed in spring 1975. It was dormant until the 1993, when the Pocono Mountains Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society took over the lease and began to restore it.\n\n\"It took 10 years to make it what it is today,\" Dickinson said.\n\nThe chapter has 80 members. \"Everybody pitches in and does their part in running the station and cleaning up,\" Dickinson said.\n\nHe came into the project about seven years ago. He moved here from Montclair, N.J., and attended the Pocono Rail Historical Society train show. He bought a shirt and a hat, and picked up an application and later was able to join. \"It's a labor of love,\" he said.\n\nThe Pocono Rail Historical Society hosts a train show to help defray expenses. The show will be held Sunday at the Stroudsburg Intermediate School.\n\nCoolbaugh Township has provided support, and the group, now registered as a nonprofit, has obtained a $12,000 grant from ESSA. That grant will be used to redo the ceiling and the waiting area in January.\n\nThe station will be open on weekends after Thanksgiving.\n\nThen they will start the work. \"We try to keep everything historically accurate,\" Dickinson said.\n\n\"Lionel trains were toys of the boys of my generation,\" Dickinson said, adding that for 60 years the No. 1 toy was the Lionel train. A toy train collection magazine calls model trains \"The World's Greatest Hobby.\"\n\nAs a kid, \"each Christimas we had one piece we would want,\" he recalled.\n\nTrains aren't just for boys. \"Girls were more interested because Lionel had cars that emulated businesses,\" he said.\n\nHis daughter Lucinda used to string tracks from room to room in their townhouse in Montclair, N.J., placing a Barbie Dream House along the way. Glamour Girl dolls would ride the trains. \"She would put the trains together after school,\" he said.\n\nA member of the Toy Train Collectors of America, Dickinson said people are becoming interested again in this old hobby. \"The baby boomers had toy trains as kids,\" he said.\n\nHe added, \"Children were more imaginative than the modern day digital child who is fantastic with the computer.\"\n\nAs he pointed to a layout in the station, he said, \"This develops the imagination when a boy sits on the living room floor and plays.\"\n\nLocal freight trains still run by the station during the week, serving the propane, lumber and grain industry.\n\nFor a taste of the goneby passenger era, people can still take Steamtown excursions that stop at Tobyhanna.\n\nDickinson, and his shih tzu, Popcorn, are there for all of them, giving information about history, railways and the surrounding areas. \"When I get into something, I go whole hog,\" he said.\n\nName: Howard C.
