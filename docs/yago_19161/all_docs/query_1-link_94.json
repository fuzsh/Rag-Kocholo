        "text": "Thanks to Facebook algorithms, ads for Candlelight Concerts have been showing up in my feed for months now. \"Wow, that looks cool!\", I thought. Then, when I originally clicked on the link, I was disappointed to find that the nearest candlelight concert was far from Montana.\n\nFast forward to today.\n\nI clicked the link again and this time I was pleased to see a Billings date on the company's calendar. Fever presents Candlelight: A Tribute to Coldplay on Strings, on August 31st at the Petro Theater at MSU-B.\n\nEnjoy the music of Coldplay with hundreds (thousands?) of candles lighting the stage.\n\nCandles make everything better, right? The soft glow of candlelight is hard to duplicate. Flickering candles can set the perfect ambiance at a romantic dinner table for two, in the bedroom, around the bathtub, or at church during a Christmas Eve candlelight service.\n\nAbout the Coldplay by Candlelight Tribute show in Billings.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of Coldplay, but I'm seriously considering a date night for this show. Much of Coldplay's catalog is already heavy on the strings, making their songs perfect for this candlelight tribute show.\n\nThe August 31st performance at the Petro Theater on the MSU-B campus is affordable too. Tickets start at just $17 (plus fees). The show is open to ages 8 and up and lasts approximately 1 hour."
