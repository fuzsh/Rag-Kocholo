        "text": "Gardner Dickinson, a founder of the Senior PGA Tour and owner of the best U.S. Ryder Cup record, died Sunday. He was 70.\n\nMr. Dickinson died at home in his sleep after a long illness, said his wife, Judy, a three-time LPGA president and a tour player. He lived in Tequesta, about 10 miles from PGA National Golf Club, where many of his colleagues were playing in the PGA Seniors' Championship.\n\n\"He was a fierce, hard-working competitor and made up for his lack of size with his intensity and hard work,\" Jack Nicklaus said.\n\n\"He not only had a gift for playing but a gift for teaching and getting his message across. We will all miss Gardner and send deepest sympathy and love to his family.\"\n\nMr. Dickinson was born in Dothan, Ala., and was a member of the NCAA championship team at LSU in 1947. He was 5 feet 11 and weighed 130 pounds when he turned professional in 1952, earning the nickname \"Slim Man.\"\n\nMr. Dickinson's first tour victory came at the 1956 Miami Beach Open. Throughout the next four decades that victory remained his greatest golf thrill, according to a statement from his family.\n\nBut his last tour victory was nearly as exciting _ he defeated Nicklaus in a playoff in the 1971 Atlanta Classic.\n\nMr. Dickinson was a member of U.S. Ryder Cup teams in 1967 and 1971. He was 9-1 in Ryder Cup play.\n\nIn 1978, Mr. Dickinson and Sam Snead teamed to win the first Legends of Golf, a made-for-TV event, by one stroke over Peter Thomson and Kel Nagel. Snead birdied the last three holes.\n\nA year later, Mr. Dickinson became one of the original members of the Senior Tour Policy Board, which formally established a circuit for senior players.\n\nMr. Dickinson is a member of the Sports Halls of Fame at Georgia, Alabama and LSU.\n\nHe is survived by five children, Gardner, 41; Randall, 40; Sherry, 38; and 8-year-old twins Barron and Spencer.\n\nThe funeral is Wednesday."
