She was a graduate of Ann Arbor High School and the University of Michigan where in her senior year she was president of her sorority, Collegiate Sorosis Sorority. Judy was married to James Kelley Newton in 1956 and together they raised two children Cynthia and Robert. As a mother, she had her children involved in a wide variety of activities including figure skating, hockey, tennis, music, art and Judy’s favorite, silent hour. Throughout Judy’s life she was very active in tennis, golf, croquet, skiing, and figure skating of which she was most adept. Judy was a member of the Ann Arbor Figure Skating Club and US Figure Skating Association. Growing up she performed in many ice shows. Judy trained at the Broadmoor while attending Colorado College befriending Dick Button and Gretchen Merrill. Judy transferred to the University of Michigan graduating with a degree in Sociology. Judy became a regional figure skating judge and traveled to many parts of the country to judge individuals and competitions. Judy and her family spent many happy summers at their cottage in Wequetonsing, where they played tennis with Mr. D, golfed at Birchwood, and had a lot of fun with friends. Judy is survived by her husband James Kelley, children Cynthia and Robert, grandchildren Eric and Kelley Stanske, brother James Cushing, nephew Jeffrey Cushing and niece Sarah Newton. The Newton Family is most grateful for the competent, thoughtful, and loving care provided by the staff at Perry Farm Village in Harbor Springs. The family is also grateful for the thoughtful and loving care given to Judy by her caregiver Cheryl Smiley."
