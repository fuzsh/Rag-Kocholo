        "text": "After a successful PGA Tour career, during which he recorded seven victories, Dickinson became one of the founders of the Senior PGA Tour. His wife, Judy Clark, was a four-time LPGA Tour winner, who became President of the LPGA Tour.\n\nDickinson is known for the quote, “they say golf is like life, but don’t believe them. Golf is more complicated than that”.\n\n124th US Open: the No.2 Course at Pinehurst once again plays host to this most illustrious championship (June 13-16). Wyndham Clark defends his title, having won at Los Angeles CC in 2023.\n\n79th Women’s US Open: the second women’s major championship of the season gets underway at Lancaster CC in Pennsylvania. It’s the second time the championship has been held here.\n\n(May 30-June 2).\n\nNelly Korda: won the Mizuho Americas Open (May 16-19) at Liberty National GC, continuing her extraordinary form in LPGA events. This was her sixth win in seven starts in 2024.\n\nXander Schauffele: recorded his first major championship win, and second record-equalling low score of 62 in a major. Only he, Branden Grace, Rickie Fowler and Shane Lowry have achieved this feat in a men’s major championship.\n\nMarco Simone Golf & Country Club: With a clubhouse that might befit a Roman Emperor, and a golf course to match, you can be sure of a memorable outing at Rome's most talked about golf facility.\n\nJim Fazio's original layout was much changed to create a modern Ryder Cup course ... now one of the Eternal City's (and Italy's) most revered.\n\nHere at Prince’s Golf Club you'll find 27 excellent holes of links golf. Just over the fence and sharing similar terrain is Royal St George’s; but Prince’s is far from overshadowed by its venerable neighbour. The three nine-hole loops at Prince's, laid out over gently undulating terrain, are sure to bring a smile of satisfaction to all lovers of links golf.\n\nStay&Play at Prince's: excellent onsite Lodge accommodation available\n\nYou can subscribe to the Where2Golf channel on YT if you like to see more video content.
