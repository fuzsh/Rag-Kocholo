        "text": "Andrew “Tony” Rogers ’65 and Judith Elder Rogers ’66\n\nAnthony and Cleopatra. Victoria and Albert. John and Yoko. The scrolls of history are replete with noteworthy couples. Now it’s time to add a new pair of names to the list: Andrew “Tony” Rogers ’65 and Judy Elder Rogers ’66.\n\nAnd what have they done? What haven’t they done? is more like it. During the past decade, Tony and Judy have been involved in virtually every aspect of the College. And now, three-and-a-half decades after they flipped their tassels in front of Old West, their faces are familiar on campus and their voices are critical to the College’s progress.\n\n“One of the strengths of Dickinson is the sense of community,” says Tony, explaining why he and Judy chisel time out of their hectic schedules to volunteer for the College. “That [sense of community has] been an important part of our lives…and we enjoy giving back to that community.”\n\nIn Tony’s case, “giving back” has meant serving as co-chairman of the class of 1965’s 25th reunion, acting as chairman of the Dickinson Fund Advisory Council, sitting on the Alumni Council, assuming national chairmanship of the Dickinson Fund, participating in the Alumni Admissions Program, and holding membership (including a stint as senior advisor) on the Board of Advisors from 1992-1999. Currently, he’s chair of the McAndrews Fund for Athletics and chairman of his class.\n\nJudy, too, is chairman of her class. She’s also on the Reunion Committee for the class of 1966—which is celebrating its 35th reunion this weekend—and she’s registered in the Alumni Contact Program. She’s also been a member of the Board of Advisors, chairman of the Dickinson Fund Advisory Council, national chairman of the Dickinson Fund, a volunteer in the Alumni Admissions Program, a member of the Volunteer Weekend ’99 Steering Committee, and a resident at the 1995 Metzger-Conway Series.\n\n“If I hadn’t done the things I’ve done,” Judy remarks, “I’d just be one of those people who says, ‘Yeah, I loved my four years at Dickinson’.” Instead, she says, “I really feel a connection.”\n\nBetween Judy’s position as human resources manager at Johnson and Johnson Network and Computing Services and Tony’s role as vice president of sales and marketing for Fashionaire Home Products, it’s a wonder that over the years they’ve found time to remain active at and beyond Dickinson. (Then again, finding time is among the mandatory magic acts of volunteers.) A past PTA volunteer and former board member at Newark’s chapter of Habitat for Humanity, Judy is currently on the board at Our House, a residence for the developmentally disabled, and she helps out at Teach for America. Tony has previously served as president of the Gunnery School Alumni Association, member of the Gunnery School Board of Trustees, member of the South Mountain YMCA Board of Management, and member of the Maplewood Club Board of Trustees.\n\nMarried since their college days, Tony and Judy have two grown children—Andrew and Elizabeth—and a “great dog,” Pudge.\n\nThis year marks the first time that the Distinguished Alumni Award has been given to a pair of alumni. “It’s nice for us to receive this together,” says Judy, “because Dickinson has meant so much to both of us.”"
