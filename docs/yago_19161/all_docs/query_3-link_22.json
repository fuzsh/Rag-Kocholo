        "text": "Judith (Judy) Marlys Gratz, Thompson Falls, Montana, died June 2, 2013 of pulmonary\n\nhypertension. Judy was born April 8, 1941 in Bismarck, North Dakota, to Harry and\n\nMargaret Klick.\n\nA funeral mass to honor Judy will be held at 11 a.m. on June 21, 2013 at St.\n\nWilliam's Church, Thompson Falls, MT. Friends and family are invited to share\n\nmemories of Judy at a luncheon following the service.\n\nShe attended school in Hebron, North Dakota, where she graduated from high school in\n\n1959. She played trumpet in the school band, was a cheerleader and was a member of\n\nthe Hebron Rodeo Club. She was Worthy Advisor in Rainbow for Girls and a delegate to\n\nNorth Dakota Girls' State.\n\nIn 1963, Judy earned her Bachelor of Science Degree in Elementary Education from\n\nDickinson State College, Dickinson, North Dakota. She was a member of the Alpha\n\nSigma Alpha Sorority, the college rodeo team and was homecoming princess in her\n\nsenior year.\n\nJudy married her college sweetheart, Donald Gratz, April 4, 1964, in Poplar,\n\nMontana, where Judy taught English and Physical Education. It was here on the Ft.\n\nPeck Indian Reservation where Judy developed her affection for the Native American\n\npeople.\n\nSon Robbin Lee was born in 1965 while they lived in Poplar. Second son, Scott Allen,\n\nwas born in 1966 after the family moved to Bismarck, N.D. where they lived for two\n\nyears.\n\nFor the next 32 years, Sidney, MT was their home. Judy did substitute teaching and\n\nwas assistant manager for the LaLonde Hotel for several years before going back to\n\nteaching in the Title I program for a number of years. Her dream of retiring in the\n\nmountains of western Montana was realized in 2000 when she and Don moved to Thompson\n\nFalls, MT.\n\nJudy had a deep love of animals, especially horses and was an ardent rider until her\n\nscleroderma disease kept her from riding in recent years. Through her love and\n\ncompassion, Judy touched the lives of many students and friends, but most profoundly\n\nher family.\n\nJudy is survived by her husband Don Gratz, son Robbin (Jody) Gratz of Austin, TX;\n\nson Scott (Vickie) Gratz of Clarkston, WA; grandsons Matthew Gratz, Tanner Gratz,\n\nand Trevor Gratz; great grandson Gavin Gratz-McGill; mother Margaret Klick; and\n\nsister Nancy Sand. She was preceded in death by her father Harry Klick and\n\ngranddaughter Kirsten Gratz.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please feel to send memorial contribution to one of Judy's\n\nfavorite charities listed: Thompson River Animal Care Shelter, PO Box 1589,\n\nThompson Falls, MT 59873; DeLa Salle Blackfeet School, PO Box 1489, Browning, MT\n\n59417; or St. Labre Indian School, Ashland, MT 59004.\n\nArrangements have been entrusted to Sunset Hills Funeral Homes, Thompson Falls,\n\n406-826-5653."
