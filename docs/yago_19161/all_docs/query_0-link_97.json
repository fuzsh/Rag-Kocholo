        "text": "This novel is based on the true story of Emily Dickinson, and the affair between her brother Austin and Mabel Todd. I really don’t know much about Emily Dickinson apart from the fact that she was a poetess. From the book we learn that she had a sister Lavinia, who she lived with, and an older brother, Austin. She became a recluse and didn’t let anybody see her.\n\nEmily Elizabeth Dickinson (December 10, 1830 – May 15, 1886) was an American poet. Dickinson was born in Amherst, Massachusett. Around the 1860s, Dickinson’s behavior began to change. She did not leave the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors from the other side of a door rather than speaking to them face to face.nShe acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen, and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Although Dickinson’s acquaintances were most likely aware of her writing, it was not until after her death in 1886 — when Lavinia, Dickinson’s younger sister, discovered her cache of poems — that the breadth of her work became apparent to the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content.\n\nLavinia Dickinson was her sister. Lavinia Norcross Dickinson (February 28, 1833 – August 31, 1899) was the younger sister of American poet Emily Dickinson. Lavinia “Vinnie” Dickinson was instrumental in achieving the posthumous publication of her sister’s poems after having discovered the forty-odd manuscripts in which Emily had collected her work. Despite promising her sister that she would destroy all correspondence and personal papers, Vinnie sought to have her sister’s poetry edited and published by two of Emily’s personal correspondents, Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd.\n\nAustin Dickinson was her eldest brother. William Austin Dickinson (April 16, 1829 – August 16, 1895) was an American lawyer. Known to family and friends as “Austin”, he was the older brother of the poet Emily Dickinson. After his father’s death, Austin became treasurer of Amherst College from 1873 until his death. Dickinson married Susan Huntington Gilbert, a friend of his sister Emily from childhood, in 1856. They had three children and resided at the Evergreens, which stood adjacent to the Dickinson Homestead. Aside from his connection to his world-famous sister, Emily, Austin is also known for his longtime affair with Mabel Loomis Todd, a young faculty wife who would eventually edit the first few collections of Emily Dickinson’s poetry.\n\nThe couple lived in a house called the Evergreens."
