        "text": "Fourteen years ago, Angie Dickinson did the unthinkable: she walked off the television program This Is Your Life, leaving its host, Ralph Edwards, and a collection of Dickinson’s family and celebrity and hometown friends stranded on the set. [#image: /photos/54cbf7233c894ccb27c79841]Edwards had lured her with the pretense that she would be meeting with Brian De Palma, who directed her so magnificently in the 1980 thriller Dressed to Kill, to talk about directors and actors. Instead, “they had assembled all these people,” Dickinson explains over dinner in West Hollywood, “my sister Janet, my daughter, Nikki, even an old high-school boyfriend. Bob Hope had left a dinner with President Ford and Colin Powell to be part of this, and of course they all had to go home.” That had never happened in the history of the show. When asked why she refused to allow the assembled crowd to honor her, she replies, “All these people are supposed to come around and rave about you. I think they should have organized it the other way around, so I could have talked about their importance.”\n\nHer refusal to be part of that show is one of the many things that Los Angeles novelist and screenwriter Bruce Wagner—who wrote the 1993 mini-series Wild Palms, in which Dickinson played Josie Ito, a sexy, villainous grandma—loves about the actress: “That was so ballsy and so antithetical to the culture,” he says. “Knowing Angie, you would think she’d have no trouble with that show; she’d think it was a hoot.” He compares Dickinson to British actress Jacqueline Bisset: “There’s a kind of easiness about the way they carry themselves in the world, a kind of devil-may-care, sexually charged quality. They’ve really seen it all and done it all and don’t give a damn—but in a really elegant way.”\n\nThat was not the only time Dickinson—born Angeline Brown in North Dakota in 1931—balked about revealing her personal life. In 1989 she returned a six-figure advance from a major publisher for her autobiography. What was it that she couldn’t bring herself to tell? Rumors had swirled around her for decades: about an affair with President Kennedy during the four-day inaugural celebration; about her on-again, off-again 10-year love affair with Frank Sinatra; and about the dissolution of her marriage to songwriter Burt Bacharach. Were there other secrets as well? And for an actress as good, as professional, and as beloved as Angie Dickinson, why were there so few major film roles?\n\n“I was a leading lady,” she says, “but never the lead.”\n\nA veteran of more than 89 films and television movies and well over a hundred TV appearances, she still gets scripts that ask her to do nude scenes. “Don’t they know I’m an old lady?” she says, laughing. At 76, Dickinson still attracts admiring glances, though she apologizes for “not having the Angie Look” anymore. But she does: the champagne-colored hair, the warm, flirty eyes, the sensual mouth, the peach-melba voice—in short, the epitome of the game blonde with class and brains.\n\n“You know my story. I’m pretty,” Dickinson says as Sheila Farr, the femme fatale nonpareil in Don Siegel’s thrilling 1964 noir film, The Killers, in which she seduces a racecar driver, intensely played by John Cassavetes, and leads him to his doom. Dickinson’s Sheila is so seductive, so sympathetic, that when she finally shows her true, treacherous nature, you gasp. The most terrifying moment in the film is when Lee Marvin, playing a vicious hit man, dangles her by her ankles from a hotel window. She also gets slapped hard across the face by Ronald Reagan, in his last film role and his only one as a villain. For years after, he would apologize to her. “He was uncomfortable playing the villain,” Dickinson says, “and only did so to fulfill his contract.”\n\nFilm historian David Thomson claims that Dickinson is his favorite actress, “a woman you thought of as a pal, always effective, a reliable doll,” though he admits that “there was a moment when it looked as if she could do a great deal more than she did.” If she never won an Academy Award or achieved the superstar status of Marilyn Monroe or Elizabeth Taylor, she still remains the secret crush of generations of male moviegoers. Mention her name and eyes light up.\n\nIt’s not just Old Hollywood that remains entranced with Angie Dickinson. Younger, hip directors do too. Gus Van Sant cast her in Only Cowgirls Get the Blues. Steven Soderbergh made sure she had a cameo in his remake of Ocean’s Eleven. And when Brian De Palma cast her as the sensual, adulterous wife in Dressed to Kill, it was because he needed someone who would immediately establish a sympathetic bond with the audience—someone we already knew and loved.\n\nThe character of “Feathers” (usually just called “The Girl”) in Howard Hawks’s 1959 Western, Rio Bravo, put her on the map. Cast as a flirtatious saloon girl, she likes to please men, or, in this case, The Man (John Wayne, as Sheriff John “T for Trouble” Chance). But there’s never a weak or passive aspect to her performance. “I’m hard to get, John T.,” she says to the stoic Wayne. “You’re going to have to say you want me.” There’s a similar self-assurance in all the characters she has played—what one critic called “a quasi-liberated, pre–Women’s Liberation woman.”\n\nHawks, who also discovered Lauren Bacall, first noticed Dickinson in an episode of Perry Mason, which he watched at the suggestion of his elegant wife, Slim Keith. But when he chose Dickinson, Slim remarked, “Really? I’m surprised.” And Hawks replied, “That’s what I wanted you to say.” Dickinson wasn’t exactly a newcomer: she had already appeared in seven films and had played the female lead, “Lucky Legs,” in Sam Fuller’s 1957 melodrama China Gate. As a Eurasian good-time girl whose marriage to Gene Barry is derailed by the birth of her Chinese baby, Dickinson at 25 is stunning and her confidence borders on bravado.\n\nShe was born in the North Dakota prairie town of Kulm (pronounced “Kulum”), settled by Germans, and then moved to the even smaller town of Edgeley. “Some say that L. Frank Baum, who wrote The Wizard of Oz, used Edgeley to describe the edge of the world,” Dickinson says, “and it wasn’t Kansas, it was North Dakota.” It was “smaller than small, and then again, it was the Depression.” Her parents published two newspapers when Angie and her two sisters, Janet and Mary Lou, were growing up: the Kulm Messenger and the Edgeley Mail. “My father, Leo Henry Brown, really was talented—he could write. He had a gift, and he had a great, sly humor. He was handsome, he was tall. He taught my mother how to run a Linotype, and they had that big roller—everybody working on that,” Dickinson recalls.\n\nLike many of his generation, Angie’s father lied about his age to get into the navy at the outset of the First World War. “But his stepfather died, and he had to come home and take care of his mother I think his dreams were smashed. He’d wanted to play the saxophone, he’d wanted to be a veterinarian, so I think he was one of those sad people who didn’t get what he wanted in life.” Instead, he became an alcoholic. “It made it hard at home. You don’t know if that’s what gave you the drive to say I’m never going to be stuck like that. I loved him, but you can’t love the life—the life is horrible. Just remember this was Kulm, North Dakota, population 700, the end of the war, the Depression. It all adds up to what you are.”\n\nDickinson did what every other child with imagination and hope did during the Depression: she went to the movies. And she found herself identifying not with the leading ladies of the day—Marlene Dietrich, Betty Grable, and Lana Turner—but with the men. “I remember a Humphrey Bogart movie where he was a reporter, so I wanted to be a reporter, and then he was a parachutist and I wanted to be a parachutist,” she says. “Even a priest, when Gregory Peck was a priest in Keys to the Kingdom, because the women didn’t do anything! They were just wives or old maids. I wanted to look like Dietrich or Grable or Lana Turner, but I wanted to do what the men did.”\n\nAfter the war, her parents moved the family to California, where her mother worked as a proofreader for the Burbank Review (“She could spell any word there was”) and her father “shuffled around from job to job, poor soul.” Angie attended Glendale College, and in 1952 she met and married Gene Dickinson—a big, good-looking football star with a passion for electronics. They divorced in 1960, and she went to work as a secretary at an airplane factory. She came in second at a local preliminary for the Miss America contest, and that got the attention of a casting agent, who landed her a spot as one of six long-stemmed showgirls on The Jimmy Durante Show.\n\nThat’s where she met Frank Sinatra, who was a guest star on the television show. “It was my first show, my first step onto a professional stage. I had not even seen one before. I had come from work in a fill-in job, and I stepped on the stage, and there were Frank Sinatra and Jimmy Durante, working. I just walked in and thought, Oh my God, this is what I want to be a part of.”\n\nThat’s one reason she believes that “the most important man in my life was Frank. He was so important, because he was so powerful when I got to meet him.” In 1960, Dickinson played the estranged wife, Beatrice, of Sinatra’s Danny Ocean in the Las Vegas caper film Ocean’s Eleven, and by that time she was the gal pal of the Rat Pack, the one woman they would let in the room, who could beat them at poker and tell a bawdy story. “The part of Bea Ocean is too small for a star, so I was lucky to get it,” she says. It is indeed a small role—she has only two scenes, both with Sinatra, but the chemistry between them is unmistakable. Watching the film today, Dickinson comments, “Look at that face!” She’s still entranced by him.\n\n“Frank and I stayed friends for all those years, and it was just one of those great, comfortable things, where you always desire somebody, but you can live without them,” she says about their 10-year affair. Sinatra would park his Dual-Ghia behind her house, Dickinson recalls, and in the morning “the garbagemen would come and hang around the car,” she says with a husky laugh. “It was wonderful, it was kind of perfect,” she adds, “but I don’t think he ever had a great passion for me, which is why I think it lasted as long as it did. And I for him. There’s a difference between having to have something and wanting something.”\n\nAnother part of Sinatra’s life that Dickinson shared was his involvement with the Kennedys. “It was Frank who brought me in,” she says, recalling a big party given by J.F.K.’s sister Pat and her husband, Peter Lawford, at their beachfront home in Santa Monica, just before the 1960 Democratic convention, in Los Angeles. “The future president was there,” she says, “and Joe Kennedy, and Bobby and Eunice and Pat, of course—and Frank. We were feverish to work for him, which is why I got invited to the inauguration. It was an electrifying time.” Dickinson believes it was her role in Ocean’s Eleven that made her so welcome with the Kennedy family. Sinatra, the film’s guiding spirit as well as its star, sent a copy of the movie before it was released to the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port. “I was Frank’s wife in the movie, so I was already one of the boys!”\n\n“We went barnstorming to seven states,” Dickinson recalls, “and we picked up athletes like [baseball stars] Stan Musial and Ernie Banks.” None of those seven states broke for Kennedy, but she felt they reduced the margin. Dickinson missed the inaugural parade because she had to spend the day getting her hair fixed for the ball later that night (“There were no hot curlers in those days!”). The night before, there was a gala put on by Sinatra at the National Guard Armory (with Jimmy Durante, Gene Kelly, Shirley MacLaine, Ella Fitzgerald, and many others), and then the president-elect went to Paul Young’s restaurant for a late-night dinner hosted by his father. Among the guests was Paul “Red” Fay Jr., a friend who’d served with J.F.K. in World War II, who would soon become undersecretary of the navy. In his 1966 memoir, The Pleasure of His Company, Fay recalled that his assignment that night was to escort Dickinson, a date arranged by Ethel Kennedy. He recalled Angie “wrapped in fur, standing all alone,” and many have speculated that Fay was merely the “beard.”\n\nThat night Kennedy teased Fay and flirted with Dickinson. Since then the rumor of an affair with J.F.K. has clung to Dickinson like the fur coat she wore that cold January evening. It comes up again and again, and she’s quick to show her displeasure when asked about Fay’s book. “He shouldn’t have written it,” she says. “It was too personal.” The persistent rumor is “kind of like having a broken wrist,” Dickinson admits. “It’s an annoyance, but I have to live with it.” According to one source, her unwillingness to publish anything about her relationship with Kennedy is why she returned her advance to the publisher. She had completed more than 100 pages, with “all the details of her affair with the president intact.”\n\n‘I thought better of it,” she says today. “I didn’t want to let it go out,” so she withdrew the manuscript. “They wouldn’t believe me if I said it never happened Anyway, it’s time for everybody to grow up about the Kennedys. It’s more important what we lost as a country.” It was during the making of The Killers, with future president Ronald Reagan on the set, that she first heard the news that the president had been assassinated in Dallas. David Thomson assumes the rumor of a Kennedy affair is true, but lauds Dickinson because she has never once “talked about it publicly, taken advantage of it, tried to use it to boost her celebrity, or said one word to detract from the dignity of the presidency.” Or, more to the point, as Sinatra liked to say about Dickinson: “How wonderful it is to meet a lady who’s a gentleman.”\n\nIndeed, when asked her opinion of the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 over the Lewinsky scandal, she rises to his defense. “I think it was a terrible thing. He did so many great things for this country, and when they go after you, if they can’t find anything, that’s when they go after the genitals!”\n\nShe met President Clinton once, at a Democratic fund-raiser given by film mogul Lew Wasserman. “I was standing next to [actress] Suzanne Pleshette on the receiving line,” she recalls about the encounter, “and as he got closer, I said to her, ‘My God, I’m beginning to sweat!’ And then he was in front of me, bigger than life, and so great-looking. He said when he met me, ‘At last!’” He must have known of her long-standing connection to the Kennedys and her support for Democrats. In fact, she once famously joked, “I have never knowingly dated a Republican.”\n\nIn the 1960s, Dickinson played the female leads in a number of compelling films (The Sins of Rachel Cade, Jessica, Cast a Giant Shadow), but that star-making role eluded her, and her parts—though good—did not give her a lot of screen time. After The Killers, Dickinson accepted a small role as the sheriff’s wife in Arthur Penn’s 1966 film, The Chase, because it gave her the chance to play opposite Marlon Brando. Lillian Hellman wrote the overheated screenplay, and the rest of the large cast—including James Fox, Robert Duvall, E. G. Marshall, Jane Fonda, and a wildly miscast Robert Redford—all seem to be acting in different movies. Only Brando and Dickinson are true and sure.\n\n“The director, the screenwriter, and Brando all wanted different things,” Dickinson explains. “I was totally in awe to be working with Brando, who made me feel part of the group. He didn’t ad-lib just to smart off. He did it to add to the scene, and he wanted me to feel that comfortable. I watched him, and it was as if there wasn’t a camera in sight. He was so rich, he just exuded a greatness, and yet a comfortableness. We’d sit in his trailer and talk, and he’d tease me to death—it was all part of him making me feel less intimidated and able to work.” But, generally, away from the cameras, she notes, “he liked to make people squirm.”\n\nIn 1967, John Boorman directed Dickinson and Lee Marvin (who had played one of the relentless hit men in The Killers) in the chilling Point Blank, a noir film about a double-crossed man who obsessively tries to recover a fortune stolen from him by the Mob. Dickinson has a steamy sex scene with the film’s villain, John Vernon, but what everyone remembers from the film is her pummeling of Lee Marvin, who refuses to give up his search for the stolen loot. She stands there and beats his chest with her fists, much longer than you expect her to, until she finally collapses on the floor. In the next moment she belts him with a pool cue, and actually opens a gash on his face.\n\n“She was very enthusiastic about it,” Boorman recalls from his home in Ireland, “because I think she was taking revenge on Lee Marvin for holding her upside down out the window in The Killers. She didn’t get on with Lee, really. She was afraid of him in a sense, uneasy with the character Lee was playing—a terrifying figure. When she got into that scene, she really went for it. She went beyond what was required. He stood there impassively, which was exactly that character, but the next day he was covered in bruises.” (Boorman did feel, however, that Dickinson eventually felt “an affection for Marvin.”)\n\nBoorman adds, “I do think I photographed her well. We were shooting in February of ’63, I think, and I put her in the first miniskirt to hit America. They were already, you know, on the Kings Road in London, but she wore the first one seen in America. She had the legs for it.” Indeed, she was given the Golden Garter Award for “Hollywood’s Greatest Gams” in 1962 and voted the actress with “the most beautiful legs in Hollywood” by the L.A. County Podiatry Association in 1981. Boorman confesses that Dickinson “was very unhappy with me about forcing her to change her hair color. I had this maniacal idea that I wanted her hair to be the same color as her dress, and we went through three dyeing jobs to get there. The hairdresser at MGM said, ‘I can’t go any further, her hair’s starting to break off.’”\n\nAnd then, for a while, the terrific roles stopped coming. It’s hard to know why. Bruce Wagner says, “You know, I think it’s just the luck of the draw, the throw of the die. Angie is completely iconic, and yet perhaps never got those roles—or passed them over—that would have made her a much bigger star than she is.” A slew of younger actresses—Jane Fonda, Mia Farrow, Julie Christie, Faye Dunaway—got the plums instead: Klute, Rosemary’s Baby, Doctor Zhivago, Bonnie and Clyde. At this point in her career, Dickinson contemplated a move to Paris, where The Killers and Point Blank had given her star status. (There’s nothing the French love more than a good noir.) She began studying French, but stayed in L.A.\n\nBy the time she met Burt Bacharach, in 1964, her career had cooled, just as his was reaching for the stratosphere. They were married on May 5, 1965, in the Silver Bell wedding chapel in Las Vegas. The ceremony was attended by Ricky Nelson’s older brother, David, and the producer and *über-*agent Charles K. Feldman.\n\nShortly after their marriage, Bacharach, a former accompanist for Marlene Dietrich’s Las Vegas show, was handed the opportunity to score his first film, What’s New, Pussycat?, and the title song became a huge hit for Tom Jones. There was also a spate of hit songs performed by Dionne Warwick (“Walk On By” and “Do You Know the Way to San José”), Dusty Springfield (“The Look of Love”), and Jackie DeShannon (“What the World Needs Now”).\n\nAn Academy Award for best song, for “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head,” from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, arrived in 1970. For a time, they were Hollywood’s most glamorous couple; with her pale blond hair and his gold records, they practically shimmered. “You couldn’t be a hotter couple than Angie and Burt in those days,” says Wagner. But, in fact, Dickinson noticed that the power equation in their relationship changed on the night of the Academy Awards, with 60 million people watching: “The audience loved ‘Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head,’ and they loved the attractive man who wrote it,” she says. Photographers practically knocked her down in their rush to get pictures of Bacharach.\n\nIn 1966, their only child, a daughter named Lea Nikki, had been born three months prematurely and weighed not quite 29 ounces. “It was the nurses who named her,” Dickinson says, “because nobody thought she would live.” Mother and infant barely survived, and Nikki’s prematurity would have serious consequences down the road.\n\nDickinson continued to work in film, though in smallish roles in Westerns such as Sam Whiskey, with Burt Reynolds, and Young Billy Young, with Robert Mitchum. In l974 she made a rollicking, lightweight Roger Corman film, Big Bad Mama, “basically a rip-off of Bonnie and Clyde,” she says now, with Tom Skerritt and William Shatner. Again, she has a number of incredibly sexy love scenes with her two leading men, and her nudity, at 43, is breathtaking.\n\nHer marriage to Bacharach lasted 15 years. Dickinson later felt that she had “held on too tight” in caring for her daughter. “I spoiled her. It obviously damaged the marriage, plus we had other problems. We really never should have married. We should have stayed in a romance, in love, and I should have walked away long before.” When Dickinson was offered a role in a new television cop show, Police Woman, she asked Bacharach if she should do it, and he said yes. It became a smash hit, one of the first successful crime dramas in television history to feature a female lead.\n\n“It was the cement block that landed on our marriage,” Dickinson now says. After the failure of Lost Horizon in 1973, for which Bacharach composed the music, his career went into the wilderness, while Dickinson’s shifted into high gear. “It was hard,” she admits, and the grueling schedule was even harder—12-hour days on location six days a week. Her not coming home was difficult for Bacharach, she recalls, “and he’s a New Yorker, used to going out at night after working.” She was disappointed when he declined to write the theme music for Police Woman, because, Dickinson says, “he didn’t think it was going to be a hit.” Bacharach did, however, compose a piece for his daughter, “Nikki’s Theme,” for an ABC Movie of the Week.\n\n“It was exciting when it was good—and it was great a lot of the time,” she now says about the marriage, but they separated in 1976 and divorced four years later.\n\nPolice Woman—released in 2006 on DVD with Dickinson’s commentary—ran from 1974 to 1978 and earned Dickinson three Emmy nominations. Her Sergeant Suzanne “Pepper” Anderson was among the first of a new wave of tough, resourceful female action heroes who could hold their own in a man’s world. She was perfect for the role—that independent spirit coupled with a willingness to go undercover as a hooker or a moll, to be “eye candy”—and she was grateful to have the series. “A lot of actors tried television—Shirley MacLaine, even Anthony Quinn—but few were successful,” she says in a rare boast.\n\n“I never really felt like a movie star until Police Woman,” when she began to be recognized on the street, she says. Unfortunately, success on television seemed to signal the end of leading-lady film roles. Her next movie appearance would, indeed, be small, but it would make a tremendous impact.\n\nTwo years passed between the final episode of Police Woman (“I just didn’t want to sign another four-year contract”) and her unforgettable appearance in Brian De Palma’s Dressed to Kill. Dickinson played Kate Miller, a sleek, elegantly dressed, unsatisfied wife who embarks on a daytime tryst with a stranger. The erotic content is far more intense than anything she had done before, and the fact that most of her 20 or so minutes of screen time are acted in silence makes her performance all the more remarkable. Dickinson asked De Palma if he “wanted to put in dialogue in the museum scene, and he said he’d written lines, but when he saw the rushes, he knew that they weren’t needed. And he was right. He knew exactly what he wanted.”\n\nThe film opens with Dickinson in the shower, slowly pleasuring herself while her clueless husband shaves at the bathroom sink. Except for her eloquent face—and at 48 she was at the peak of her beauty—the scene is played with a body double, but it’s her face that delivers the erotic charge. Later, after unburdening her discontent to Michael Caine, who plays the film’s psychiatrist/psycho-killer, she has that glorious scene in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (actually filmed in the Philadelphia Museum of Art). Dressed resplendently in a white dress, white trench coat, and off-white kid gloves, Dickinson alternately flirts with, runs from, pursues, then loses a handsome stranger in dark sunglasses. She searches for her lost glove, which the stranger has found and uses to lure her into his cab. They end up at his apartment. Next we see her waking up alone and writing a note of appreciation to her mysterious lover. She silently dresses, and it’s De Palma’s genius that the camera watches her, both as voyeur and as lover, as she slowly puts on her clothes. The reverse striptease is excruciatingly intimate, and Angie unself-consciously holds the gaze of the camera.\n\nThere were some uncomfortable moments on the set, however, because of friction between Dickinson and De Palma’s then wife, Nancy Allen, who stars in the film as a high-priced call girl. “His wife hated me because I asked her to stop smoking in a small room … I mean, hated me. And the director didn’t want to hear about two bitches bickering!”\n\nDressed to Kill was a sensation at the box office, in part because of the controversy over the movie’s mingling of sex and violence. Several feminist organizations, such as Women Against Pornography, picketed it, but the National Association of Theater Owners named Dickinson Female Star of the Year.\n\nIt’s her favorite of all her film roles, because, as Dickinson says, “I’m good in it, and it’s a great part. I’m sorry I didn’t try to go for an Academy Award for that role. I think I could have won it. But the studio didn’t want to put up the campaign, and I felt that I didn’t want to go for a supporting-actor award, because I’d always thought of myself as the lead, even though by then I wasn’t getting starring roles. I regret it now. Of course, De Palma is to blame for the great performance.”\n\nDickinson’s most enduring passion may be poker. “I played every Saturday night instead of going to the Daisy, or whatever was popular at the time,” she says. Regular Sunday-night games at the Sinatras’ included Jack Lemmon and his wife, the Sammy Cahns, and the Gregory Pecks, though Sinatra himself never liked to play. “Frank never played poker,” Dickinson explains. “Frank’s game was the dice. He’d be going great at the crap tables, but he was an impatient man,” and he liked the continual action of craps and baccarat. “Dean Martin was a professional poker player” at one time in his hometown of Steubenville, Ohio, she says, “but he got into a lot of trouble, and they broke his hands.” The reason poker is so popular now, she believes, “is that they play Texas Hold ’Em. You’ve heard of the dumbing down of America? This is the dumbing down of poker.”\n\nJohnny Carson, who was a close friend for many years, was “a great cardplayer. He was an amateur magician.” Dickinson was a frequent guest on The Tonight Show, where she ad-libbed her most famous remark. “I had a funny outfit on—funny to Johnny,” she recalls, “and he said, ‘Tell me, do you dress for women, or do you dress for men?’ And I said, ‘I dress for women. I undress for men.’”\n\nAt one point she and Carson came close to having a romantic relationship, but the timing was never right. And Dickinson has always seemed to prefer men of action. David Janssen, the brooding, hard-drinking star of The Fugitive, was “a great gentleman, a great date, and a great love.” While on the set of Wild Palms, Dickinson found producer-director Oliver Stone highly attractive. “He’s so magnetic, it was unnerving.” She calls it “the John Wayne syndrome—that quiet presence.” Earlier, she had been involved with the director Richard Brooks (Blackboard Jungle, In Cold Blood, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof). But sometimes, as she says, “excitement can be a pain in the ass.” According to John Boorman, she and Brooks once went off on a tramp steamer together. “We wanted to be alone,” she told Boorman, “but after three days we couldn’t stand each other. Brooks stayed in the cabin and wrote a script [for Elmer Gantry], which he then won an Academy Award for. And he didn’t even thank me!”\n\nDickinson, who’s an active member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, loves the movies. “I’m one of the few members of my generation who still gets in line for them. I like to see them all.” She believes that a certain femininity is missing in contemporary actresses, with the exception of Nicole Kidman and Charlize Theron. “When they’re too tough,” she says, “it just doesn’t appeal.” Are there any actresses she would rush off to see? “I like Hilary [Swank] very much. She’s extraordinary.” She’s also impressed with relative newcomer Rachel McAdams, especially her performance in Wedding Crashers. “She’s so great,” Dickinson says. “Every once in a while that happens, and you root for her not to fuck up. Charlize Theron does it for me, though—so great in Monster. I would never even dream of looking like her—she’s breathtaking.”\n\nAs for her own appeal, Dickinson says, “I wasn’t considered beautiful, not to the executives. I think I was just too unusual. I didn’t fit. Besides, it’s hard to define beauty, but I think one of its qualities is a generosity, a reaching out. I think I had that.” She recalls that, in the l950s, “everybody looked alike. Our hair was the same. I looked like Lana Turner sometimes; sometimes I looked like Esther Williams—the dress down to here, the ugliest fucker! It wasn’t until the 60s you were allowed some individuality.”\n\nAt a recent dinner in Beverly Hills, Dickinson found herself seated next to Clint Eastwood. They were talking about how relieved they were not to be fussed over anymore by countless makeup artists and hairdressers on movie sets. “I’m glad that’s over with,” Eastwood confided to Angie. “I’m not saying I’ll never act again, but I don’t miss that part of it.” Dickinson, however, admitted, “You get so used to being fussed over that when it stops you feel naked just going to the supermarket. You end up obsessed with your looks. If an elevator doesn’t have a mirror in it, I’m finished. I don’t care who you are, when you get to be past 50, it all changes. That’s the way it is. It isn’t wrong—we want to look at young, beautiful things. I don’t want to see two old people screwing,” she says with a laugh.\n\nDickinson guards her time and her privacy and is still coping with the heartbreak caused when her daughter committed suicide on January 4, 2007. Nikki Bacharach, who was 40 when she died, had Asperger’s syndrome, a neurobiological disorder first described in 1944 by a Viennese doctor, Hans Asperger, but not widely recognized until the mid-1990s. It’s characterized by normal and sometimes extremely high I.Q., deficiencies in social skills (stemming from the inability to read nonverbal cues), extreme literal-mindedness, difficulty handling changes in routine, and a tendency to become obsessed with things. Another feature is extreme sensitivity to noise, which especially plagued Nikki, who was tormented by the sounds of the omnipresent helicopters flying over Los Angeles. “We have so many disgusting sounds,” Nikki would complain, asking that the air-conditioning be turned off because she found it too noisy. “It’s horrible and I dread every single day, except Sunday.” “She just went crazy with it,” Dickinson says. “Believe me, we played music, but when the helicopter came over, we jacked up the Pavarotti.” Dickinson even thought about selling her beautiful home in Coldwater Canyon and finding a quieter spot.\n\nSome experts consider Asperger’s a high-functioning form of autism, and in fact many people with it do manage careers and families of their own, but Nikki was also hobbled by diminishing eyesight, a result of her premature birth. The greatest trial of her life, Nikki firmly believed, was her hospitalization when she was 14, when her Asperger’s syndrome had not yet been identified. Hospitalization is not a prescribed treatment for the disorder, and Nikki held her father responsible for her 10 years of incarceration. “I don’t want to be unkind to Burt,” Dickinson says, “because I’m very respectful of him, as a person and an artist, as a former husband and as a father to Nikki, but he had no real connection with her. She was too difficult for him, but it was his loss. He put her in a hospital, and it was the worst thing you can do. He had the wrong goal in mind: he thought that she was just a difficult child, and I was just a terrible mother, indulging her. He didn’t know there was actually a syndrome. He thought, Just get her away from Angie’s indulgence and she’ll shape up. But, of course, the doctors didn’t have a clue. He does regret it,” she adds wistfully, “and he has said, ‘I’m terribly sorry. Had I known, I never would have done that.’ Nevertheless, it destroyed her.”\n\nNikki had a difficult time forgiving her father, because holding on to ideas and emotions is part of the syndrome. “Since then, Burt was very supportive,” Dickinson says, and made repeated attempts to move back into his daughter’s life, but Nikki “resented him so much, she wouldn’t let him back in. He kept telling her, ‘I’m sorry.’ But once she got on a thing, it was very hard We were once coming up with titles for a book, and she floored me with the title she came up with: I’ve Never Healed from Anything. Whatever she’d been wounded by, she never healed. It’s a terrible syndrome because they can’t let go. Medication can slow it down a little.”\n\nNikki had her own apartment in Los Angeles but spent a great deal of time living with her mother, skinny-dipping in their pool, watching DVDs at home or going to screenings at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Like her mother, she loved the movies. “I love her career,” Nikki would say, going on to recite dialogue from her favorite Angie Dickinson film, Big Bad Mama.\n\nDickinson was clearly proud of her daughter, and, as she says, “You wouldn’t have wanted to see her gifts ignored.” Like a lot of people with Asperger’s, Nikki was extremely articulate, even lyrical. She once described listening to one of her father’s songs as “going to heaven on a velvet slide.” Dickinson realizes that she “became less viable about the time Nikki needed me so strongly. It wasn’t a sacrifice. Would I have been out working? Yes, I would have been doing plays in Chicago or something like that, if I hadn’t had a daughter who needed me. But I did. I didn’t have the gift of free time.” In the days and weeks after Nikki’s suicide, Dickinson’s close friends helped her to survive her grief. Gregory Peck’s widow, Veronique, introduced her to playwright Tony Kushner at a literary event she hosted. “He read a piece about loss, about a death in his family, and it was the truest thing I’d ever heard. I asked for a copy of it. I miss Nikki so much, but it was her decision. The world was too harsh a place for her.”\n\nIn some ways, Dickinson’s career has been one of great film moments: teasing John Wayne in Rio Bravo, pummeling Lee Marvin’s chest in The Killers, betraying John Vernon in Point Blank, seducing and being seduced in that great little silent film at the heart of Dressed to Kill. But when asked what she considers her greatest role, she says without hesitation, “I have yet to do it.” Bruce Wagner says, “I was always so moved by how Angie prioritized her life. I will always think of her as a kind of rose, in a luminous black-and-white photo taken at Chasen’s or Romanoff’s. There’s a part of her that’s a phantom, and a part of her that’s very much alive. I don’t know how else to put it.”\n\nSam Kashner is a Vanity Fair contributing editor."
