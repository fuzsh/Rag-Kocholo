        "text": "The Wynantskill UFSD Welcomes Three New Staff Members to GD!\n\nThe Wynantskill UFSD welcomes three new staff members to GD this year! Please welcome Ms. Pia Biondo (Middle School Spanish), Ms. Victoria Kohan (Social Worker) and Mrs. Tania de Rosier (Middle School ELA)!\n\n“Hello, I’m Tania. I’ve been in education for the past 15 years and have taught a variety of courses in elementary, middle, high school and college levels. Before I became a teacher I was a journalist and have a background in newspaper reporting and freelance magazine writing. I received my graduate degree in English education from the University of New York, Albany. I love reading and writing with my students and listening to their insights.”\n\n“I’m Victoria, I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. I have my Bachelor of Science degree in Public Relations and Psychology from Syracuse University and received my Master’s in Social Work at Columbia University where I specialized in Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy with children and adolescents. My background prior to coming to the school has been quite varied from working in the Office of Mental Health – Division of Forensics for NYS to working in both not-for-profit and private practice as a therapist. I have always had a passion for working with children and that continues to date! Happy to be here!”\n\n“I’m Pia, I was born in Spain and have lived in Italy and Spain until I moved to the US in 2004, where I came to pursue my Master’s degree. I have a BA in Translation and Interpreting and a MA in Spanish Literature and Linguistics. I moved to Albany to live near family. I started working as a Translator during college but my passion was teaching since an early age, so that is what I focused on since 2004. I have taught at university level as well as private and charter schools.”\n\nPosted in Uncategorized."
