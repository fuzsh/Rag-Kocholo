        "text": "Terry Wayne Saville, age 76 of West Fargo, ND, passed away on March 7, 2024. A celebration of his life will be held on April 20, 2024, at 11:00 am at the Henry Biesiot Activities Center in Dickinson, ND.\n\nTerry was born on September 16, 1947, in Bismarck, ND to Jeannette Danielson and Ray Saville. He grew up on a farmstead near Braddock, ND, graduated from Braddock High School in 1965, and later attended Dickinson State University. Terry was a farmer at heart and reminisced about those days often. His love of animals began with his horse Diamond, dog Tippy, and cat Katsla, and their shared adventures. He honed his highly specialized skill of teasing in his early years on the farm.\n\nOn December 22, 1966, he married his best friend, Judith Kurtz, and moved to Dickinson, ND where they raised their family. Even after relocating to West Fargo to be closer to his kids and grandkids, he would proudly tell anyone he met he was from Western ND. Terry and Judy met in 4-H as kids and enjoyed 57 years married as each other’s companions. His career was working in communications at Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, AT&T, and eventually US West. He was intelligent, articulate, and enjoyed problem-solving. He shared many fond stories about his coworkers throughout the years and even in retirement would visit the office for their coffee breaks.\n\nGrowing up with Terry was never dull. He had an adventurous spirit and loved to have fun. He enjoyed many activities including but not limited to travel, scuba diving, boating, skiing, motorcycling, amusement park rides, Pinochle, Yahtzee, bowling, softball, basketball, and golf. Many members of his family learned to waterski or tube behind his tan and gold Hammond ski boat at Eagle Lake in Park Rapids, MN. Some of his favorite things in life were black coffee, fried chicken, hot buttered popcorn, Budweiser, Yankees baseball, Packers football, TCM movies, Louis L’Amour novels, comic strips, classic cars, eating (very slowly), and researching family history. If you ever dined out with Terry, you knew the affair was a minimum of two hours. He loved to talk, and he loved to eat.\n\nTerry had the best sense of humor, laughter, and smile. His kids enjoyed that he grew to love the sitcom Seinfeld later in life. Many conversations and texts about life events related back to a Seinfeld scenario. His biggest wish for anyone would be to have fun and not take life too seriously. Those are the values he bestowed upon his family.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Judy of West Fargo, sons Steve (Carol) Saville, and Ryan (DeAnna) Saville of West Fargo, and daughter Alyson (Jay) Saville of West Fargo; grandchildren Erich, Casey, Sam (Kelli), Leanne, Ben, Hayden, Addison, and Hudson; sisters Serena Peck of Hudson FL, Renae (Greg) Winter of Minneapolis, and Janelle (Tom) O’Mara of Minneapolis; and numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, brothers Dwight and Loren Saville, sister-in-law Carol Saville, and brother-in-law Thomas Peck.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family would prefer memorials to be designated to the charity of your choice."
