        "text": "My father, James “Jim” Elwood Dickinson, was born in Scobey, MT, on June 15, 1929, to Marie Chase and Floyd Adelbert Dickinson. He was their first child of seven. He spent most of his youth on a farm in Spring Valley, near Scobey, just south of the Canadian border. His father farmed and raised cattle for dairy. When the family finally had electricity installed at the farm in the 1940's (through the Rural Electrification Project), my dad elated, with a glint in his eye, that they bought a toaster and had homemade toast every night.\n\nJim graduated from Scobey High School in 1947 and attended Hamlin University in St. Paul, MN. From there he was accepted into Drew University Seminary in Madison, NJ. After Drew, he spent three or four semesters at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. Germany was still in its postwar state even into the mid 1950s. His stories about food shortages and piles of rubble everywhere were sobering. However, his time at Heidelberg filled him with fond memories and presented many adventures.\n\nOn his return voyage in early March of 1956, the Dutch-owned passenger ship encountered such rough seas that everyone on board was seasick. The north Atlantic is treacherous in the winter. My dad, desperate to get some fresh air after spending days in the cramped cabin with a roommate, made his way to the deck and stepped out briefly. A huge wave crested over him and he barely made it back inside with the latch closed before the wave hit — just a heartbeat from being swept overboard.\n\nA few weeks after arriving back in Montana, Jim accepted the parishes of Hobson and Judith Gap near Lewistown, MT. He began his life of ministry in the heart of central Montana.\n\nSoon after serving in the parish of Huntley, MT, near Billings, Jim met Dora Mae Storm and they married August 4, 1959. Dora Mae had three sons by a previous marriage. Soon after their marriage the couple moved with sons Michael and Barry to Whitefish, MT. They were there for nine years. Daughter Christine was born to the couple in 1961.\n\nThe Yellowstone Conference of the United Methodist Church liked to move their pastors around so the family was transplanted many times. They moved to Dillon, MT; Buffalo, WY; and Plains and St. Ignatius, MT, until Pastor Jim retired and moved to their beloved old house up at Proctor, MT, which he named Elwood.\n\nJim had not been retired for long before the Hot Springs Presbyterian Church asked him to become fill-in pastor. That role suited him well as he didn't have any administrative duties; he just showed up for services, potlucks, and an occasional wedding or funeral. It was a \"sweet gig\" as he and Dora Mae were able to live in their house at Proctor while he drove each Sunday to Hot Springs.\n\nJim’s hobbies kept him busy when he wasn’t pastoring. He loved listening to his large collection of LP’s and CD’s; he played organ and piano, and tinkered in the barn restoring old furniture. He also loved to read.\n\nIn the Fall of 2013, Jim and Dora Mae moved to the Missoula Manor in Missoula on Central. They made many friends there and were involved in activities, especially song gatherings or anything that involved music. After Dora Mae declined to the point of needing assistance, the couple moved in 2019 to BeeHive Homes where Dora Mae passed away in February of 2020, just before the Covid pandemic lockdown. They had been married for sixty years.\n\nJim opted to remain at BeeHive Homes, where he stayed until a sudden illness took him from us on June 4, 2024, a few days short of his 95th birthday. The staff and people have told me they miss him very much. As do we. I love you, Dad. And may Light Perpetual shine upon you.\n\nJames is survived by his daughter, Christine Dickinson,and her husband Matthew Lyon of St. Ignatius, MT, sister Florence Hagiwara of Colorado Springs, CO, sister Shirley Van Wyhe of Sterling, IL, grandson Ian Lyon of Helena, MT, grandson Alasdair Lyon of Missoula, MT.\n\nHe is also survived by step-sons Brian Chandler of Winter Haven, FL, Michael Kyle Chandler of Algona, WA, and Barry Chandler of Proctor, MT, plus their children: Seth Chandler, Jillian Steele, Karen Pergesen, Loy Chandler, Lea Chandler, Sara Williamson, KC Chandler, and Kevin Chandler who knew him as Grandpa Jim.\n\nBurial will be at the private family cemetery in Proctor, MT."
