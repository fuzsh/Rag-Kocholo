George Edward Dickinson was born on May 30, 1947 to Billy William Dickinson and Clarabelle Lavina (Sanders) Dickinson at the Taylor Hospital in Sidney, NE. George grew up on the Dickinson family farm SE of Sunol. He attended school in Sunol and graduated from 8th grade. George grew up as one of seven boys.                                                                                                                                            Growing up with a family who used horses to till and plant the fields and horses to mow the meadow and put up hay, George worked alongside his Dad, Uncle George and brothers to make a living and have food for the family and animals.  Cows were milked, the milk was separated and cream was sold to neighbors. During the summer, some cream was always saved to make ice cream for the family to enjoy. George worked for over 50 years at the Sidney, Chappell and Ogallala Auction Barns, and made extra money helping local farmers and ranchers with odd jobs. George was always ready to tease. He always helped friends and neighbors when asked.           Proceeding him in death were his parents Billy and Clarabelle; Grandparents, Irvin W.  and Klara Alvina (Rahe) Sanders, George Washington and Fanny (Kilgore) Dickinson, brother Leroy Dickinson and wife Pat (Saali) Dickinson, brother Jim Dickinson, and nephews Joe and Eric Dickinson.
