        "text": "When Amy Dickinson, 54, and Bruno Schickel, 57, married five-plus years ago, she imagined their marriage would be like a good romantic comedy.\n\nShe was a cerebral, bookish, polished career woman whose nationally syndicated “Ask Amy” advice column had replaced the one written by the late Ann Landers, while he was a burly guy who built houses for a living and drove an old red pickup truck full of power tools. Actually, their five years of marriage have been more like a poorly built roller coaster: up and down and unstable, but still fun.\n\nBefore she married Mr. Schickel, Ms. Dickinson had been a divorced single mother, which seemed almost inevitable. Her mother, two sisters and several aunts all became single moms at some point. “Divorce runs through my clan like an aggressive chromosome,” Ms. Dickinson wrote in her memoir, “The Mighty Queens of Freeville,” which was published by Hyperion Books in 2009. Ms. Dickinson brought up her daughter, Emily Mason, in Washington and Chicago. “Our life was very quiet and very predictable,” she said, “No surprises.”\n\nAfter the wedding, Ms. Dickinson moved in to Mr. Schickel’s very unpredictable household. He was a divorced single dad with full custody of his three of his four daughters who ranged in age from 11 to 19 at the time. They lived in a farmhouse in Dryden, N.Y., surrounded by hills, sheep and approaching weather systems. Ms. Dickinson had grown up on a dairy farm in nearby Freeville, met Mr. Schickel in high school, and fallen in love with him when she returned home in the fall of 2007 to take care of her elderly mother.\n\nWhen he originally told his daughters he was marrying Ms. Dickinson, the girls didn’t exactly celebrate. “One daughter threw up her hands and stomped out of the room,” he said. “Another burst into tears. It was like cats scattering.”\n\nSo, after the wedding, Ms. Dickinson, whose daughter had left for college by then, more or less tiptoed into the household, bringing as few belongings as possible. “I arrived at the door with my two suitcases, like Maria von Trapp,” Ms. Dickinson said. Mr. Schickel added, “To her credit, she didn’t walk in and say, ‘We’re redecorating!’ ”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
