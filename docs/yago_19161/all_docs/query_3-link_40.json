Judy took great pride in her gardening and tended to acres of land with beautiful plants, flowers, and vegetables. She made lifelong connections in AFS and was a host to many exchange students, who will remember her fondly. Through her tenure at the Ark, Judy also was like a second mom to many.\n\nJudy is survived by her loving husband of almost 63 years, Jim; children James (Lauren) Cotugno Jr., Jeff (Pam) Cotugno, Jill (Jose) Renteria, Jon Cotugno, and Janet (Chad) Wagner; grandchildren Michael, Brian, Jessica, Owen, Daniel, Machaela, Jeremi, Dilen, Inara; great-granddaughter Lucy; and numerous cousins, nieces, and nephews.\n\nA memorial visitation will be held October 21st, 2023 from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. at Fitzgerald Funeral Home & Crematory, 1860 S.
