The Phoenix Suns are waiving recently acquired 16-year NBA veteran wing Kyle Korver, via Uproxx's Brad Rowland.

Korver was traded along with guard Jevon Carter by the Memphis Grizzlies to the Suns for former fourth-overall draft pick swingman Josh Jackson, guard De'Anthony Melton, and a second-round pick.

It's uncertain whether the 38-year-old Korver will retire following his waiver from Phoenix or opt to look to sign and contribute to an expected playoff-contending team like the Los Angeles Lakers or Clippers, Milwaukee Bucks, or Philadelphia 76ers.

The Grizzlies acquired Korver in the Mike Conley trade with the Utah Jazz, wherein Memphis traded their long-time floor general for Korver, Jae Crowder, Grayson Allen, the 23rd overall pick in the 2019 draft (Darius Bazley), and a future first-round pick.

Korver was selected with the 22nd pick in the second round (51st overall) of the 2008 NBA Draft by the New Jersey Nets, who then traded the Creighton product to the Sixers for cash. Korver spent four-plus years with Philly before being traded to the Jazz in 2007.

The 6-foot-7 wing later played for the Chicago Bulls, Atlanta Hawks, and Cleveland Cavaliers. He's a one-time All-Star and known profoundly across the league for his impressive three-point shooting, hitting 42.9 percent of his career triples.

It was never likely the Suns would need Korver's talents as they rebuild around players like center Deandre Ayton, shooting guard Devin Booker, forward Mikal Bridges, and the recently drafted 23-year-old University of North Carolina product Cam Johnson, who they acquired after trading the sixth overall pick in the 2019 draft to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Dario Saric and what would yield Johnson with the 11th pick.
