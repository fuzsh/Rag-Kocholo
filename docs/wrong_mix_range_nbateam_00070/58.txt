The Phoenix Suns waived Kyle Korver on Monday.

The 38-year-old shooter is considering signing with the Los Angeles Lakers, Milwaukee Bucks or Philadelphia 76ers once he clears waivers, according to ESPN.

The 6-foot-7 forward shot 39.7 percent from beyond the arc last season and 42.9 percent for his career. He ranks fourth all time with 2,351 3s made.

He would fit right in with the Bucks system of getting open 3s when teams double down on Giannis Antetokounmpo driving the lane.

Combined with Wes Matthews, the two would really stretch the floor much better than Tony Snell and Nikola Mirotic did last year for Milwaukee.
