        "text": "It is important for Shakespeare to present Macbeth as a hero in order to prepare the reader for his tragic downfall. Shakespeare first presents Macbeth as a hero when he is called “brave Macbeth” by the captain. In many ways the captain represents the whole army and this could be a way for Shakespeare to show how Macbeth is viewed by the army it could also show how Shakespeare is seen as brave by a high up member of society. As well as being praised by the captain Macbeth is also praised by the King, the line ‘more is thy due than more than all can pay’ shows how the King respects Macbeth “more is thy due” shows Macbeth is a hero in the eyes of the King as the King believes he owes Macbeth for what he has done.\n\nMany people wish for greatness; Larry Bird worked for it until he achieved it, particularly in basketball. Basketball has always been a fast-paced, exciting game to watch. The sport has even been nationally televised for decades. The game has gained special popularity because of its superstars. National Basketball Association (NBA) superstars are recognized by many as the most recognizable pro athletes. Larry Bird was one of the most famous stars of the league, and his popularity greatly increased the publics’ interest in the league. Larry Bird’s fame and basketball success was brought about by his hard work and competitiveness.\n\nWhen LeBron James was born, nobody would have guessed that he would have been the one to go all the way to the NBA and perform like he does. He has amazing talent and he knows how to use it. And what's so amazing about how he went all the way to the NBA, is he was living in a state of poverty with trouble all around him and still managed to make it tontine big times.Even though the odds of how he lived were against him, LeBron James managed to put his talent first and become one of the best basketball players in the world.\n\nUnwind, a very well written science fiction book by Neal Shusterman. There are a few arguments arguing whether Connor, a male character in Unwind, is a hero or not. According to my opinion on this argument, I would say that Connor is a hero and is not a hero, but goes more towards being a hero. Connor Lassiter is a 16-year-old male in Unwind. He was very aghast when he saw a letter signed by his parents as to Unwinding him. Unwinding is the transplanting of a teen’s body parts to another person who is in need of those parts. In the following three paragraphs, I will tell you what specifically is a hero, why Connor is a hero, and why Connor isn’t a hero.\n\nThe Boston Celtics had 29 wins the season before they drafted Bird. The team improved by 32 games to go 61-21 in Bird's first season. The main reason they won so many more games was because of Larry Bird. Bird was not just a shooter, he was also a great passer and rebounder too, which in turn made his teammates better as a whole. In his second year in the NBA, Bird and Celtics won the NBA Championship against the Houston Rockets. Larry Bird would go on to win two more championships with the Celtics. He would also win the Most Valuable Player award three times. This is what Larry Bird said after his second Most Valuable Player award, \"While I was still trying to figure out how I could improve my game for the next season, I was notified that I had been selected as the league MVP for the second year in a row\"(Bird and Ryan 153). Larry Bird after being in the league for seven years and winning two straight MVPs was still trying to find ways to get better. Bird proved that perseverance and dedication to the sport he loved would lead to a successful and rewarding\n\n“ A hero is somebody who voluntarily walks into the unknown .” When a hero keeps on going and never stop trying that makes them a hero.When a hero puts there life at risk just to save another life, even though it could mean losing their own that makes them a hero. Someone who goes through great challenges but never stops trying is a hero. Ahero is not someone who gives up or someone who is selfish.Heroism is being selflessness, someone who makes sacrifices, and someone who never gives up.\n\nOne of the top reasons that high school players choose to skip college is because they can make a lot of money instead of getting an education in school. High school players need to think about what they could get out of college before making a decision to go to the NBA. For example, Tim Duncan, who has been one of the most dominant players in the NBA in the last five years, went to college for all four years and then went to the NBA. Duncan attended Wake Forest University where he earned a degree in Psychology, and had a successful college basketball career. In the NBA, Duncan has been a two-time MVP, has two NBA championships, and has been named to the first-team all NBA five of the six years he has been in the league (Duncan Player Profile).\n\nLebron James, the first pick taken in this year’s draft, may be the prototype for an athlete having immediate fame and wealth by jumping straight to the NBA. Almost undoubtedly, he has set the bar for years to come. Before he even played in an actual NBA game, he already had his own commercial and shoe deals. When he was a senior in high school, ESPN and ESPN2 were already publicizing his regular season games whenever they had the chance. Amazingly, as a junior in high school, he was already being considered the next Michael Jordan (Broussard).\n\nFirst Off, Kyle Korver is dominant. Kyle Korver has played for 8 teams and every team has enjoyed having him.Kyle Korver has a 50.8 percent shooting average his whole career that is the second best ever. His fifth on the list of the all-time made three-pointers made and is still rising.He is currently playing for the Cavs and is a vital piece for this team and was traded midseason. Kyle has been a three time all star two years as a starter and 1 year as a reserve. Kyle is arguably the best three-point shooter of all time behind Ray Allen.\n\nHis career highs so far are with the Timberwolves. He played in 57 games, his field goal (2-point shots) percentage is at .421, his 3-point percentage is at .304, his free throw percentage is at .641, and he has his high in rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks also. The only record he has broke since then was his free throw percentage that changed to .900 with the Raptors. In his whole career so far he has played in 151 games, has 472 rebounds, given 77 assists, has 58 steals, has 27 blocks, and 658 points. He has only played in four seasons, so this is impressive. Although he hasn’t won any championships, he has great achievements and who knows how his future will\n\nThere are many types of heroes (such as the ones in comic books, myths, movies, or even just everyday life heroes) but all of them have perseverance when they’re going through a conflict. Heroes are role models and they’re people that we look up too. They all have unique and special qualities that make one another different from each other. For example policemen battle crime everyday and when they’re overcoming a conflict they have determination, courage and other traits that people admire them for and that make them as a hero. Typically a hero is admired for their achievement/actions and qualities.\n\n“I’m just a little kid from Akron”-LeBron James. Lebron James is one of the greatest basketball players to ever play the game and even at age thirty two he is still crushing the game. That is a big reason why he is my hero because he has always been a superstar from the start. At St.Vincent-St. Mary High School where LeBron went to highschool he led them on to win three Division III state championships. He was the first sophomore ever selected for USA Today All-USA First Team and then kept going from there to be named Parade magazine's High School Boys basketball Player of the Year and Gatorade Player of the Year in just his Junior year. He just kept getting better and better every year. His senior year he lead his team to the top national ranking and then went straight out of highschool to the NBA.\n\nWhen the word \"hero\" is spoken, everyone has different thoughts. Some will think of super powers like flying and saving people from villains; while others have a certain person they know or have heard of that come to mind who have done something to make a difference in the lives of others but who is a hero to you? To answer this question you must first ask yourself what a hero is; what comes to your mind when someone says the word. When I am confronted with these questions I always have the same thoughts; smart, strong will power, and someone who stands up for what they believe is right."
