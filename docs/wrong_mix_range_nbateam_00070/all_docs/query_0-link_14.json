        "text": "Melissa Majchrzak/Getty Images\n\nThe Phoenix Suns waived forward Kyle Korver on Monday, two days after officially acquiring him from the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nKorver, 38, had $3.44 million of his $7.5 million base salary guaranteed for next season.\n\nThe veteran shooter is expected to have his pick of contenders on the open market, with the Los Angeles Lakers appearing to be in a strong position. Korver teamed with LeBron James during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons, and the pair have a strong relationship.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers are also expected to receive consideration. Of those two, Philadelphia seems more likely because Korver spent his first four-and-a-half seasons in Philadelphia.\n\nKorver's contribution levels at his advancing age are limited, but he has value as a floor spacer and heady player (albeit still a minus) on defense. He averaged 9.1 points and 2.5 rebounds while knocking down 38.4 percent of his shots from distance with the Utah Jazz after a midseason trade from the Cavaliers.\n\nWhichever team that signs Kover will ask him to play a similar role off the bench, knocking down an occasional three while using the gravitational pull of his shooting to give them spacing for drives."
