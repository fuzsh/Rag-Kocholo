        "text": "After missing the past two games as a result of a back injury, Atlanta Hawks swingman Kyle Korver will remain on the sidelines against the Phoenix Suns, per Mike Budenholzer before the game. Budenholzer went on to say that Korver could be available as soon as Wednesday in Minnesota, but there is no definite timetable for him to be back on the floor.\n\nThe Hawks are an uninspiring 1-5 without Korver in the lineup this season (including losses on Friday and Sunday), and they have shown themselves to be a completely different team without him available. Shelvin Mack received the start in both games that Korver missed over the weekend, but the bigger story was that his absence allowed for Lou Williams to reappear in the rotation, although his play has been unspectacular.\n\nKorver has led the league in 3-point percentage this season at 48.6%, but in addition to that obvious excellence, he is an above-average team defender on the wing, and the lack of size in guys like Mack and Dennis Schr√∂der has been a concern. Against Phoenix, the relative size concerns won't be as great, as they deploy a small-ish backcourt, but the longer Kyle remains on the sideline, the uglier it becomes for Atlanta.\n\nStay tuned for more updates as they become available."
