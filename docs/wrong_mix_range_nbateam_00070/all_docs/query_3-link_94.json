        "text": "Andrew Bigley\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n10 min read\n\n·\n\nNov 21, 2018\n\n--\n\nIntroduction\n\nInspired by the CARMELO model (CARMELO uses several factors including game performance and physical attributes to project how the rest of a player’s career will go) from the folks at FiveThirtyEight, I wanted to build a similar model but for projecting how college athletes will fare in their transition into the NBA. The purpose of this dashboard is to visualize that work in an easily consumable fashion.\n\nTo start, select a draft class and a player, for the sake of this introduction we’ll look at Jordan Bell, the Golden State Warriors 2017 second round draft pick.\n\nHere is Bell’s summary page:\n\nAs you can see there are basic physical attributes, some information about where and how long he played in college, and his high school scout ranking from RSCI.com.\n\nTo the right of that, we see the main event, a survival curve, which shows the likelihood of still being an active player in the nba from one to 15 years after being drafted. Here’s Bell’s:\n\nSo in Bell’s case, his curve is in the 76th percentile for expected length of career of all players’ career predictions and that he has about a 39% chance of still being in the league after 10 years.\n\nI’ll talk a little more about why later, but all players’ curves seem to be systematically underestimating the likelihood they are still in the NBA. For this reason, I like to use the relative quantity to provide a bit more context. In order to generate these predictions and subsequent curve, I used a Cox Proportional Hazards model. I’ll describe this more in depth later (tl;dr this method allows for the use of active players in career length prediction whereas other models wouldn’t). This plot’s x-axis shows career durations while the y-axis shows the likelihood that a player will achieve a career of that duration.\n\nMoving down the page select college stats for the player are displayed as a grouped bar chart. The individual observations in each group correspond to the which year of college the player was in. The default features that are shown are the features that go into the Cox model above, they were chosen from a combination of intuition and tuning to be:\n\nOffensive Win Shares (OWS), Defensive Win Shares (DWS), Assist to Turnover Ratio (Ast/TO), Turnover % (TOV%), True Shooting % (TS%), Steal % (STL%), Total Rebound % (TRB%)\n\nHeres Ball’s chart:\n\nBy default, the percentile rank of this player relative to the whole database is displayed. This can be changed to the raw values with the radio button on the left, additionally on the left is a column selector that will update the bar graph with any of stats in the database. This is to visualize what is going into the Cox regression and allow for some more in-depth investigation into a player. Check out this link for a glossary of terms that are listed in the drop-down.\n\nBelow the bar chart, I used two different unsupervised learning methods to group similar players in my dataset together. First, a nearest neighbors method to generate a list of 5 similar players based on the players’ college stats, whose NBA stats are displayed in a table below and whose names link to the players RealGM page.\n\nAlso, a t-SNE dimensionality reduction technique to generate a visualization of how similar players are in 2-D which is displayed on the right. The nearest neighbors technique provides more accurate results because it retains the high dimensionality of the input, but I found it useful to visualize the similar players as well. For these I used the following features:\n\nField Goal Attempts to 3 Point Attempts (FGA/3A), ‘True Shooting % (TS%), Assist % (AST%), Offensive Rebound % (ORB%), Defensive Rebound (DRB%), Steal % (STL%), Block % (BLK%), Turnover % (TOV%), Usage Rate (USG%), Height in Inches (Hght\\n(inches)), Wingspan, Weight\n\nThe similar players serve to provide a double check on the survival curves. If a player has a very favorable survival curve but his comparables have short careers and or poor NBA numbers as shown by the table at the bottom, it might be worth it to take the prediction with a larger grain of salt.\n\nDATA\n\nMost of the data I used was from an aggregated dataset put together by the folks over at the Stepien. The data is a combination of many college statistics, including advanced ones like AST%, BPM and WS from RealGM and a database of measurements of heights, weights, and wingspans from combines, high school all-star games, and Olympic camps. Where no data could be found for wingspans it was estimated using the Stepien's Jackson Hoy’s regression method, which is based on height weight and selected statistics. The data runs back to 2003 and I excluded all players who came straight from high school, like Lebron James and those who came in from international teams like Giannis Antetokounmpo. In addition to this, I gathered pictures and NBA career stats for the 924 players in that database who had made it to the NBA from the NBA Stats official website.\n\nCheck out the full dataset.\n\nAfter some using some intuition and experimentation, I narrowed down the features from this set to:\n\nOffensive Win Shares (OWS), Defensive Win Shares (DWS), Assist to Turnover Ratio (Ast/TO), Turnover % (TOV%), True Shooting % (TS%), Steal % (STL%), Total Rebound % (TRB%)\n\nI wanted to keep the number of factors small for a simpler model on my first pass so I added features one by one by my idea of their importance and kept them if they model assigned them a p-value of 0.05 or less with the exception of Defensive Win Shares and STL% which I kept because I wanted something to measure defense and those two were the most significant and increased the concordance score of the model significantly.\n\nThis set of features seems on intuition to capture a least a little bit of each part of the game. Win Shares (WS) are a measure that attempts to split up responsibility for team success between the players, it is further split into Offensive Win Shares (OWS) and Defensive Win Shares (DWS), which I use here. Ast/TO is the ratio of assists to turnovers a player has and can be thought of as a proxy for how good/willing of a playmaker a player is. TOV% is an estimate on the number of turnovers a player commits every 100 possessions and provides a measure of how secure a player is with the ball. TS% is also known as True shooting percentage and is a measure of shooting percentage that takes into account the relative weight of 3 pointers and free throws, TS% provides a good idea of how efficient a player is. STL% is also the number of steals a player records per 100 possessions of play. Lastly, I included the total number of rebounds a player gets per 100 possessions.\n\nFor finding similar players, I used the same features as in the previous section but added some information about a players physical stature (height, weight, wingspan) plus split the rebounding percentage into offensive and defensive rebounding percentage, added a measure for how often a player shoots threes, ‘FGA/3A’, and added a measure for how much a player dominates the ball, USG%. These come together to provide a bit of a fuller picture of a player’s tendencies for the sake of finding similarities.\n\nData Exploration and Results\n\nUnder most standard regression techniques, I would have only been able to use players whose careers are already over to predict career length. Given that my dataset only goes back to 2003 this would have led to a very small sample size specifically among those with the longest careers.\n\nThe Cox proportional Hazards model was developed for a very similar situation. The model, still most often used in medicine but also adopted for customer churn analysis and many other uses, comes from long-term medical studies. In these studies when it comes time to make inferences about life expectancies or durations to other biomedical markers, it is possible, if not, likely not all of the deaths have occurred yet. When a death event is not observed, that observation is called ‘censored’ and we know only that they are still living and their current lifespan when we make our inferences. This information almost certainly gives an underestimation of the observations true lifespan but the Cox model uses methods that allow for the extraction of at least some knowledge from these cases. For the more in-depth explanation of how that works check out the documentation, here.\n\nAs you can see his curve almost perfectly follows the shape of the average, just offset vertically by some amount, which is how most curves will look except in the extreme cases like Steph Curry at the top, or Aaron Gray on the low end as seen below.\n\nWhen looking at the forecast it is important to remember that this isn’t necessarily a forecast of how good a player is but rather how long they will be in the NBA. Sometimes those things are correlated, but there are many cases in the NBA of role players carving out long careers for themselves, some examples are players like Jamal Crawford (19 years), Derek Fisher (18 years) or, a notable example in my analysis, Kyle Korver (16 years) who was predicted to and lived up to a 97th percentile career in years played despite never reaching the heights of a superstar. So just because the model says a player will have a longer career than another player that doesn’t always mean they will have more impact.\n\nWith that said, here are my top 50 and bottom 50 careers:\n\nIt’s clear looking at the top 50 here that the model is underestimating the length of careers at the top. The longest NBA careers are 20+ years and many players make it past 15 but only the very best here are projected to make it past 10. This comes because I’m only using a 15-year sample size so the longest career that the model can observe is 15 years. This is the main reason I display the rank of the player relative to his peers on the survival curve to give a little bit more of a straightforward interpretation through the relative values.\n\nOverall my model is fairly accurate and scores decently with a concordance score of 0.689 upon cross-validation. It also has some successes picking players to have long careers despite being picked low or undrafted. For example P.J. Tucker, currently of the Houston Rockets, has the 40th best prediction in my database and appears to be on track to fulfill that prediction despite NBA scouts passing on him until the second round. It also does well on other second round picks like Draymond Green (35th pick, 80th percentile) and Jeremy Lin (undrafted, 96th percentile).\n\nBut it also has many misses as well. The main issue I see with my model is that it overrates guards who put up huge numbers as the primary creator for a lower level college team against sub-par competition. You can see several examples of this in my top 50 with players who were drafted at the very end of the draft and never played a full season in the NBA getting 90th+ percentile predictions. Examples of this are Cedric Jackson, Derrick Zimmerman and Marcus Banks along with a few others in the top 50.\n\nIn future iterations of my model I’d like to incorporate some version of an expert scouting report in the form of prospect grades or draft big boards and a measure of competition faced to account for some of these over preforming guards but I haven’t found good sources for this data yet.\n\nAnother, smaller issue is, it seems to overrate traditional big men who may have been successful in previous iterations of the NBA but they just don’t quite fit into the current style of play an example of this in my set is Jahil Okafor who is predicted to be in the 87th percentile of career because he has great stats for a traditional center but is on his last legs in the league because he can’t stay on the floor verses other contemporary big men who are often much quicker than him. This change in style is difficult to account for but hopefully as more new generation players come into the NBA the model improves on this.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nMy last note is that this is only v1 of this dashboard. I plan to keep updates coming over the next few weeks to months. First I will add this years draft class and update their statistics as the season goes on. Some of the other stuff I have in mind is adding a tab to allow for the comparison of multiple players survival curves and college careers and another tab to create player clusters via t-SNE for whatever set of features the user picks."
