        "text": "Wednesday’s release of the Suns’ summer-league roster hinted another personnel change was about to pop. De’Anthony Melton, a second-year point guard and a prime candidate to log heavy reps in Las Vegas, was not listed.\n\nTurns out the morning buzz morphed into one of Phoenix’s more dramatic changes during an already active offseason. The Suns traded Josh Jackson, the 2017 draft’s fourth overall pick, and Melton (along with two second-round draft picks) to Memphis in exchange for Kyle Korver and Jevon Carter.\n\nThe move is partially financial, clearing enough cap space for Phoenix to sign new starting point guard Ricky Rubio to his three-year/$51 million contract on Saturday and continue its pursuit at retaining restricted free-agent wing Kelly Oubre Jr.\n\nThe move thins the logjam at wing, but it also cuts ties with Jackson, a player who was often intriguing and frustrating all in the same game during his two NBA seasons. He was the subject of some unflattering off-the-court headlines and is due to make more than $7 million in 2019-20.\n\nJackson’s athleticism — flexed via highlight-reel dunks, chase-down blocks and gritty defensive effort — has always been enticing. He averaged 11.5 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game while playing a variety of roles last season, and was always candid and thoughtful in how he broke down his performances.\n\nBut he can be too careless with the ball and his body, leading to turnovers (2.2 per game last season) and sloppy misfires at the rim. He was not a consistent shooter until last season’s final 15 games, when he drilled an impressive 42.6 percent of his 3-point attempts. And his intense competitiveness sometimes goes over the edge, as evidenced by his 15 technical fouls last season that trailed only the NBA regular-season leaders Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and Draymond Green (16 apiece).\n\nJackson was also involved in three off-the-court incidents in the past six months, including getting fined for missing a team-sanctioned fan meet and greet he said he could not attend due to family reasons. New Phoenix coach Monty Williams is known for having high character standards for players, but declined to speak specifically about Jackson’s issues when asked at his late-May introductory news conference.\n\n“All of us can make better decisions off the floor, and I’m at the head of that line,” Williams said then. “I just didn’t get caught, and that’s a reality. I’m not going to comment on his off-the-court stuff. I want to be a part of the solution if I can, and I think that’s where I’ve made an impact on young men is to be able to be transparent about my past and letting them know it’s not the end. …\n\n“I really want to look him in the eyes and just be able to learn more about him, and go from there.”\n\nAlso departing is Melton, an intriguing prospect who spent part of the season as Phoenix’s starting point guard.\n\nMelton was drafted by Houston last summer, then traded to Phoenix along with Ryan Anderson in the August deal that sent Marquese Chriss and Brandon Knight to the Rockets. Melton’s offensive game is raw — he shot 39.1 percent from the floor in 50 games last season — but his length and instincts as a defender had an immediate impact. He ranked second among rookies in steals (1.4 per game), just behind teammate Mikal Bridges.\n\nThe 38-year-old Korver, who was dealt to Memphis two weeks ago as part of the Mike Conley trade with Utah, is expected to be bought out by Phoenix.\n\nCarter, meanwhile, also fits the mold of a defense-first point guard, as he set West Virginia’s record for career steals (330) and single-season steals (112) and twice won the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year award. And his off-the-court accolades — named one of three finalists for the 2018 Arthur Ashe Jr. Male Athlete of the Year and the winner of the 2018 Academic All-America of the Year for Division I men’s basketball — align with the type of person Williams and general manager James Jones want on their roster.\n\nTrading Jackson, though, means the Suns have essentially punted on the two drafts between the selections of Devin Booker (2015) and Deandre Ayton (2018), now the franchise’s two cornerstones.\n\nIn the top eight of the 2016 draft, Phoenix picked both Chriss and Dragan Bender, who is not expected to re-sign with the Suns this summer after Phoenix declined his team option for 2019-20. Phoenix chose Jackson the following year, ahead of promising players such as De’Aaron Fox, Lauri Markkanen and Donovan Mitchell.\n\nThat’s not much to show for two Suns seasons in which they compiled 23 and 24 wins, respectively.\n\nWednesday’s trade was one part of the swift and massive summer roster overhaul since Jones was officially promoted to general manager following last season. Just four players remain from the 2018-19 opening night roster — Booker, Ayton, Bridges and second-year point guard Elie Okobo, an interesting player to follow at summer league beginning this weekend.\n\nJackson is the most recent notable player to go. He gets a fresh start in Memphis, another young team, spearheaded by Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr.\n\n(Photo of Josh Jackson against Memphis in October 2018: Justin Ford / USA Today Sports)"
