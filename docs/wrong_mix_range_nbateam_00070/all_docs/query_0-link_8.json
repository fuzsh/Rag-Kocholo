        "text": "The Phoenix Suns are acquiring veteran sharpshooter Kyle Korver and guard Jevon Carter from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for forward Josh Jackson and two second-round picks, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski is reporting.\n\nKorver, 38, played last season with the Utah Jazz and shot 38.4 per cent from outside, his first sub-40 per cent season since the 2015-16. Korver landed in Memphis very briefly after being sent there as part of the Mike Conley trade.\n\nDespite trading for him, Phoenix won’t be holding onto Korver as Wojnarowski reports the Suns will be looking to buy him out, making a him a potentially hot commodity for contenders in need of shooting such as the Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers and Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nJackson is a former No. 4 pick who has struggled in his two seasons in Phoenix and now joins a young Grizzlies team, headlined by 2019 No. 2 pick Ja Morant, where Memphis is likely banking on a change of scenery will help him revive what was a promising-looking pro career when he came out of Kansas after his freshman year in 2017.\n\nCarter was a second-round pick of the Grizzlies from the 2018 NBA Draft. He’s known best as a defensive specialist on the perimeter.\n\n[relatedlinks]"
