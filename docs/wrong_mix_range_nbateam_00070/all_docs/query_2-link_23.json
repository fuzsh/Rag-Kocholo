        "text": "“The red X that I’m wearing, it’s on my clothes too, went all out today,” Korver said while pointing to his t-shirt and hat that also had the mark. “One day a year, and literally thousands of people across the world, letting people know there’s over 27 million slaves in the world today.” It’s called the End It Movement, which Korver has been part of for three or four years. His photo is on the website, one of the many athletes that has joined this fight for freedom that started in Atlanta in 2013, raising awareness for this global issue. Korver also tweeted out his own picture in support Thursday, the day on this year’s calendar that represented “Shine A Light On Slavery Day.”\n\nKorver will continue to become part of the Cavs’ culture, whether it be through experiencing his first postgame awards ceremony, where Cleveland honors whatever achievement a player reaches — tonight it was James congratulating Korver in front of the whole locker room for passing Jason Kidd for seventh all-time in 3-pointers — or even picking up a new nickname. James bestowed upon Korver the nickname “American Eagle,” inspired by the intricate tattoo of a bald eagle he has etched on the left side of his body spanning from his rib cage to abdomen."
