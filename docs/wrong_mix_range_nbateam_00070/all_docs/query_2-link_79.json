        "text": "Kirk Korver (B.A. ’14) was a role model, hero and a Roo.\n\nThis exemplary student-athlete, who passed away unexpectedly in 2018 after a brief illness, is remembered as someone who shared joy and kindness wherever he went.\n\n“Kirk’s smile on the court was contagious,” said Nate Rogers (B.S. ’13). “He was a well-respected, fun-loving teammate. And though he was a fierce competitor, he loved seeing his teammates do well. Kirk exuded what it meant to be selfless.”\n\nKorver and Rogers met in the summer of 2010 and became best friends on and off the basketball court.\n\nWhile they were teammates, Rogers witnessed Korver’s determination and tenacity in the face of challenges.\n\n“I watched Kirk score his career high against Western Illinois my sophomore year,” Rogers recalled. “I was so excited for him, and it meant a lot to see my best friend do well after overcoming adversity and injuries.”\n\nKorver attended UMKC on a basketball scholarship. A record-breaking high school player in his hometown of Pella, Iowa, the 6’7” forward started in 50 games for the Roos, while pursuing his degree in communications.\n\nHe was also recognized with numerous awards for academic achievement during his four years at the university. He earned the Commissioner’s List of Academic Excellence and Academic All-League honors and received UMKC’s Lee Hunt Award, which honors a basketball student-athlete who demonstrates academic ability, moral character and leadership.\n\nOne of four brothers, Korver and his close-knit family shared a love for faith, community — and basketball.\n\nKorver’s parents, Kevin and Laine, both attended and played the sport at Central College in Pella. In the days of Iowa's 6-on-6 women's high school basketball, Laine once scored a remarkable 74 points in a single game.\n\nThe Korver brothers, Kirk, Klayton, Kaleb and Kyle, grew up in this small town near Des Moines. Each of the four were star basketball players at Pella High School, and all of them attended college on basketball scholarships.\n\nThough Kevin and Laine encouraged their sons to pursue excellence in all they did, they also inspired them to live life mindful of others — and they led by example.\n\nKevin, a senior pastor at Pella’s 3,000-member Third Reformed Church, has served his community with compassion and dedication for more than three decades.\n\nOne spring, when the Korver brothers were young, Kevin took out a $4,000 second mortgage to build a basketball court for his sons next to their home. The court cost $2,000. The remaining $2,000 Kevin donated to community members in need.\n\n“At the time, it made no sense to me at all,\" said Kyle. “But my father’s example to us was about how you live — and try to live generously.”\n\nRogers saw Kirk exemplify those family values while they were students at UMKC.\n\n“Kirk’s faithfulness really rubbed off on a lot of us,” Rogers said. “We had spirited discussions on faith, life, school, sports and everything in between. I’d give anything to have one more conversation with him, and I’ll cherish those moments forever. He was the brother I never had.”\n\nAs with Rogers, Kirk also shared an immeasurable bond with his brother, Kyle. Instead of sibling rivals, the youngest and oldest Korver brothers were close friends. They played endless one-on-one games on the backyard court — except when it was two-on-two with Klayton and Kaleb. They also watched a lot of basketball together, including one last game when Kirk was ill in the hospital.\n\nKyle delivered the eulogy at his brother’s funeral, which was both a tribute to Kirk and to their family.\n\n\"You will always have four sons,” Kyle said to his parents. “There will always be four.\""
