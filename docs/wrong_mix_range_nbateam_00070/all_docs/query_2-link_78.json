        "text": "CHERRY HILL, N.J. — He wasn’t their first choice, or even the second. But, on the third try, the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association got it right, and named Danny Briere the recipient of annual “Good Guy” award.The diminutive Flyers center may only have been in town for six months, but it’s near impossible to find a professional athlete as genuine, as accommodating, as accessible and at the same time as giving to the community as Briere.”I guess they gave me this award because they know I’m going to be here for eight years,” Briere joked. “It’s pretty cool though. It’s a big honor. To have the reputation of being a good guy is great.”The award is given annually to the Philadelphia athlete deemed a good guy for outstanding cooperation with the media.But in recent years, it has taken on additional standards, and requires the recipient be active in his community.Briere is a gem in each regard.From a journalist’s perspective, he gets it. He knows what his role is and he knows what the people want to hear and complies to the nth degree.”Growing up (in Gatineau, Quebec), I was always a sports fan, and now I get to see it from both sides of the fence,” said Briere. “I’m still a fan, but I also get to play a game as well. When reporters come up to me, I try to think of myself as the person on the other side that wants to know, ‘what’s really happening here,’ and I try to relate to my own experiences as a fan when I answer the questions.”But more importantly, Briere is giving of his time to any cause that helps children.Recently he gave an hour of his time to the children participating in the Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation. But every day, he raises money for special causes.Briere started a group called “The Briere Bunch” which are fans who purchase autographed hats (black with orange for the guys, pink for the ladies) with the total cost of the hats going to charity.Briere splits the proceeds among the Flyers Wives Carnival, Camp Good Days and Special Times, a camp for children with cancer in the Buffalo, N.Y. area, and the Daniel Briere Foundation in his Canadian hometown.Last season, while with the Sabres, Briere raised $62,000 for Camp Good Days.”I realize that I am very fortunate and have been able to live my dream of playing in the NHL,” said Briere. “And I just want to help out and give back. It breaks my heart when I see kids that weren’t as fortunate as I was growing up. I did it in Buffalo the last few years and I decided to keep it going in Philadelphia too.”And to think he wasn’t the first choice for this award.It was originally slated to go to former 76ers guard Kyle Korver. But new general manager and Delaware County native Ed Stefanski kind of put a crimp in those plans by shipping Korver off to Utah.Plan B was Flyers teammate Martin Biron, who is equally affable as Briere, but for some unknown reason, changed the recipient one final time and gave it to Briere.Hey, even Thomas Edison had to try a few times before he actually perfected the light bulb.Briere becomes the ninth Flyer to receive the award, which has been handed out annually since 1979.The first, believe it or not, was Bob Clarke in 1983. The most recent was Simon Gagne in 2006.l l lNOTES: In the absence of funnyman Joe Conklin, Eagles lineman Jon Runyan cracked the first joke of the Sports Writers dinner festivities when he approached the podium, looked down two feet and muttered, “short people microphones.” Runyan, honored with the Humanitarian Award, spoke of several members of his family who have endured physical hardships, and came close to tears in thanking his wife for being so supportive of his charitable efforts … Kerry Fraser received a special achievement award for his longtime service as an NHL official. Noting Fraser was scheduled to officiate tonight’s Flyers-Kings contest, coach John Stevens stood at the podium, turned to Fraser and said, “Kerry, I just want you to know you’re my favorite referee too.”"
