        "text": "American basketball player (born 1996)\n\nThis article is about the NBA basketball player. For the basketball player in Europe, see Devin Booker (basketball, born 1991).\n\nDevin Armani Booker (born October 30, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA). After playing college basketball for one season with the Kentucky Wildcats,[1][2] Booker was selected by the Suns in the first round of the 2015 NBA draft with the 13th overall pick. In 2017, at 20 years old, he became the youngest player to score over 60 points in a game, finishing with a Suns franchise record 70 against the Boston Celtics.[3] In 2019, at 22 years old, Booker became the youngest player in NBA history with consecutive 50-point games.[4]\n\nThe son of former basketball player Melvin Booker,[5] Devin is a four-time All-Star, a two-time All-NBA member, and helped the Suns reach the NBA Finals in 2021. The following season, he was named to the All-NBA First Team and helped lead the Suns to a franchise record of 64 wins. Booker also won a gold medal on the 2020 U.S. Olympic team in Tokyo.\n\nEarly life\n\nBooker is the son of Veronica Gutiérrez, a cosmetologist,[6] and Melvin Booker, who was named the 1994 Big Eight Player of the Year while a point guard at Missouri.[7][8] His parents met while his father was playing basketball for the Continental Basketball Association's Grand Rapids Hoops in Gutiérrez's hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan.[9] Booker was born and raised in Grand Rapids, living with his mother, who is reportedly of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent[10][6] while his African-American father pursued a professional basketball career internationally.[11][12] He visited his father regularly during the summer. At age 12 while visiting him in Milan, he played one-on-one with Danilo Gallinari, then teammate of his father's at Olimpia Milano.[6][13] Booker was taught by his father that having basketball IQ was just as important as natural athleticism.[14] During his time in middle school, Booker became friends with future fellow NBA players D'Angelo Russell and Tyler Ulis.[15]\n\nHigh school career\n\nSophomore year\n\nAfter playing for the freshman, junior varsity and varsity basketball teams during his freshman year at Grandville High School in Michigan, Booker moved to Mississippi to live with his father after the latter's retirement from professional basketball.[9] He enrolled at Moss Point High School, where his father was hired as an assistant coach, in August 2011.[8][9][16] In his team's fifth game of the season—a 52–32 loss to Gulfport High School—Booker scored more points (17) than the rest of his teammates combined (15).[17] In December, he hit a buzzer beater from just beyond half court to beat Harrison Central High School, improving Moss Point's record to 4–6 on the year.[18] By early January, Press-Register sportswriter Creg Stephenson opined, \"Sophomore guard Devin Booker has developed into one of the top players on the coast in his first season with the [Moss Point] Tigers' varsity, averaging 22.7 points per game.\"[19]\n\nIn the Laurel MLK Shootout, Booker scored 54 points against Northeast Jones High School, falling nine shy of Litterial Green's Moss Point record for most points in a game, set in 1988.[20] He followed up that performance with 32 points, including a game-winning three-pointer, against Murrah High School and was named ESPNHS.com's Southeast Player of the Week.[9] At that time, his father told reporters that Booker was drawing interest from Mississippi State, Ole Miss, Florida, Alabama, Georgetown, Michigan and Missouri.[9]\n\nBooker was limited to just 14 points, with no field goals made in the second half, in a 57–55 win over Gautier High School in the opening round of the Division 7-5A tournament.[21] In the championship game against Pascagoula High School, Booker was held to single-digit scoring (8) for only the second time in the season as Moss Point lost 48–32, setting up an away game with defending state champion Wayne County High School in the first round of the South State playoffs.[22] Wayne County focused their defense on Booker, holding him to a single, first-quarter free throw, en route to a 57–37 victory that ended Moss Point's season.[23] For the year, Booker averaged 22.8 points per game and was named the South Mississippi Player of the Year by the Sun Herald, becoming just the second sophomore to be awarded the honor.[24] In the announcement, the paper reported that Booker held scholarship offers from Ole Miss, Alabama, Georgetown, Michigan and South Alabama.[24]\n\nIn the summer following his sophomore year, Booker played in the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League and participated in the Elite 100 Camp, the LeBron James King's Academy Camp, and the Kevin Durant Nike Skills Camp.[20] These commitments caused him to miss the inaugural South Mississippi All-Star Basketball Showcase in May.[25]\n\nJunior year\n\nWith most of Moss Point's experienced players graduating, Booker switched to point guard for his junior year.[20] In an early December game, Booker outscored the entire Ocean Springs High School team 40–39 through three quarters en route to a 48-point finish as Moss Point won 100–55.[26] He followed up this performance with a 30-point outing, including 7 three-pointers, in a win over 54–37 win over Laurel High School in the second annual Melvin Booker Shootout, named in honor of his father.[27] The following week, Booker left a game against Harrison Central High School in the third quarter with a sprained MCL; he had scored just 9 points, but grabbed 7 rebounds.[28]\n\nBooker's injury proved minor, and did not hamper him in Moss Point's next game, where he scored 26 points in a 52–48 loss to Davidson High School in the Jackie Laird Christmas Classic at Biloxi High School.[29][30] On the second day of the Classic, Booker scored a season-high 49 points in an 80–65 win over Brewbaker Technology Magnet High School, a performance that added Duke to the list of schools recruiting him.[29][31] In early January, Moss Point went 1–2 in the Poplar Bluff showdown in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, defeating Memphis' Kirby High School but losing to Maplewood Richmond Heights High School and host Poplar Bluff High School.[29] University of Missouri fans attended en masse to cheer for Booker, who averaged 30.2 points over Moss Point's three games, hoping to entice him to play for the Tigers.[29]\n\nBooker scored a game-high 32 points in a 58–56 loss to Gulfport High School, the top-ranked team in Mississippi, in Moss Point's final game before divisional play, dropping the team's record to 6–11.[32] Moss Point went 3–3 in Division 7-5A, finishing the divisional season with a 51–40 victory over Gautier High School.[33] Booker, who struggled with his outside shot due to a wrap on his injured right wrist, hit all 17 of his free throws en route to a game-high 30 points in the win.[33] Moss Point closed out the regular season with a 67–65 loss to Division 5-6A champion Hattiesburg High School, despite 43 points from Booker.[34]\n\nThe following week, Moss Point faced a rematch with Gautier in the first round of the Division 7-5A tournament with a spot in the state tournament on the line.[33] Moss Point fell 54–51 in double overtime, ending the team's season at 12–16.[35] Booker scored 35 points in the loss, including 17 free throws.[36] For the year, he averaged 29.7 points, eight rebounds and four assists per game while carrying a 3.81 grade point average.[37] He was named to the Division 7-5A All-Division team and was the division's MVP.[38] In March, he was named the Mississippi Gatorade Player of the Year for 2013, and in April, he became the second player ever to win the Sun Herald Player of the Year Award in consecutive seasons.[8][39]\n\nBy the end of Moss Point's season, Booker held scholarship offers from Duke, North Carolina, Florida, Michigan, Michigan State, Missouri, and Mississippi State.[40] Rivals.com ranked him a four-star prospect and the 30th best player overall in the class of 2014; ESPN tabbed him as the 18th best player overall.[40] Recruiting analyst Evan Daniels called Booker \"one of the best shooters\" in the country.[8] In April, Booker began playing for the Alabama Challenge on the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League circuit.[41] After watching Booker play for the first time in the league's opening weekend, Kentucky coach John Calipari offered Booker a scholarship.[8] At the South Mississippi All-Star event in May, Booker scored 23 points to lead his East team over the West team 101–70 in the underclassman game.[42]\n\nSenior year\n\nDuring the summer of 2013, Booker participated in the Kevin Durant Skills Academy, the LeBron James Skills Academy, the CP3 Elite Guard Camp, and the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) Top 100 camp.[41] His fellow participants in the NBPA camp voted him to the camp's 10-man all-star team.[43] Booker also participated against international competition at the Nike Global Challenge.[41] At the Under Armour Elite 24 showcase, he won the three-point shooting contest.[44] In August 2013, Booker narrowed his list of potential college choices to Florida, Missouri, Michigan, Michigan State, and Kentucky.[45] He took an official visit to the University of Kentucky on the weekend of September 9 to watch an alumni exhibition game; fellow 2014 prospects Jahlil Okafor and Tyler Ulis also attended.[46]\n\nNear the beginning of October, his high school coach said Booker would announce his college choice on October 31 after taking official visits to Michigan and Missouri; he also stated that Booker was no longer considering Florida. Booker stated that ESPN had offered him the chance to make his announcement on live television, but he declined, saying he didn't want the pressure of such an event and that he wanted to keep the date flexible to allow his family from Michigan to attend.[48] At an October 31 ceremony at his high school gymnasium, Booker announced he had chosen Kentucky, citing the program's history and his affinity for coach John Calipari as primary factors in his decision.[45][49] He, Tyler Ulis, Karl-Anthony Towns and Trey Lyles all signed National Letters of Intent to play for Kentucky on November 13, the first day of the official signing period.[50]\n\nIn December, Booker's Moss Point team traveled to the Marshall County Hoop Fest in Marshall County, Kentucky, to play Louisville's Ballard High School, the top-rated high school team in the state.[51] Booker led his team in points (40), rebounds (9), and assists (2) while shooting 50% from the field and 20-for-24 from the free throw line, but his team lost the game.[51] Two games later, he scored a season-high 45 points in a 78–67 loss to Alabama's McGill-Toolen Catholic High School in the Melvin Booker Shootout.[52] Although Moss Point lost all three games they played in the late-December HighSchoolOT.com Invitational, Booker's 111 total points over those three games fell just four short of Donald Williams' 1991 record for the event.[53]\n\nBooker's 38-point performance in a January 31 win against Pass Christian High School made him Moss Point's all-time career scoring leader with 2,263 points, surpassing the 2006 mark of 2,251 set by David Booker (no relation).[54] Moss Point won Mississippi's Region 8-4A regular season and tournament championships before ending their season with a 61–56 loss to McComb High School in the Class 4A South State Finals.[55] Booker scored 42 points in the loss, including 26 in the fourth quarter.[56] He averaged 30.9 points per game in his senior season and finished his three-year career at Moss Point with 2,518 points.[55] After the season, he was named to the USA Today All-USA third team.[57]\n\nIn the 2014 Alabama-Mississippi All-Star game, Booker had a game-high 31 points and was named MVP of the Mississippi team, but his team lost to the Alabama team 90–83.[58] Booker's 31 points tied Othella Harrington's 1992 performance for the most ever scored by a Mississippi player in the event.[59] Booker joined future Kentucky teammates Ulis and Lyles on the West team in the 2014 McDonald's All-American Game, while Towns suited up for the East.[60] He scored a three-point basket in each half and finished with 8 points as the West won 105–102.[61] In March, all four were selected for the Jordan Brand Classic, with Booker and Ulis on the West team and Towns and Lyles playing for the East.[62] In May, Booker participated in the South Mississippi All-Star Basketball Showcase leading the Home team with 43 points, including a three-pointer to send the game into overtime, in a 114–106 win against the Away team.[63] He was named the game's MVP.[63]\n\nUS college sports recruiting information for high school athletes Name Hometown High school / college Height Weight Commit date Devin Booker\n\nG Moss Point, Mississippi Moss Point 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) 185 lb (84 kg) Oct 31, 2013 Recruiting star ratings: Scout: Rivals: 247Sports: ESPN: ESPN grade: 93 Overall recruiting rankings: Scout: 28, 6 (SG) Rivals: 29 ESPN: 18, 1 (MS), 3 (SG)\n\nNote: In many cases, Scout, Rivals, 247Sports, and ESPN may conflict in their listings of height and weight.\n\nIn these cases, the average was taken.
