He ranks fourth all time with 2,351 3s made.\n\nHe would fit right in with the Bucks system of getting open 3s when teams double down on Giannis Antetokounmpo driving the lane.\n\nCombined with Wes Matthews, the two would really stretch the floor much better than Tony Snell and Nikola Mirotic did last year for Milwaukee."
