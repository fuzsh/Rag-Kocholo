Sarah (Jennifer Love Hewitt) leaves San Francisco and the Salinger family to find her real father in New York. It´s the first time she stands on her own feet. "It´s the end of the world as we know it" - an old R.E.M. title - Sarah sang at the end of the pilot-episode. The song fits! "Time of your life" didn´t survive a long time. Why?! It was full of interesting characters!

Maybe I´m in the minority, but I don´t think that the focus of the show wasn´t too much on Sarah. There was enough space for the other characters to develop their own stories. Romy (Jennifer Garner), an actress who tries to find work, Maguire (Jonathon Schaech), the guy from the record-shop, who falls in love with Sarah, J.B. (Diego Serrano), a hairdresser who works at the edge of legality sometimes and falls in love with Romy, etc - they all try to find luck on their own way. I can especially remember episode 12 "The time everything changed" when Molly, a girlfriend of Romy died. I guess it was the most dramatic episode! Besides in Germany - where the show was called "New York life" - all 19 episodes were aired. So the american TV-audience will never know who Sarah´s real father is. It was a real touching moment when she met him....

"Time of your life" would have been a great alternative for "Party of five"-fans. Why didn´t they give the show a second chance?! It really had the potential for success! I can remember that "Party of five" was also a missuccess in the first season! It´s a shame that it was cancelled so soon!

Another great show on television that I will miss...
