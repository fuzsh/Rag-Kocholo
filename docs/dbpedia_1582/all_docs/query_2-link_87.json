        "text": "Imagine a narrative of your “life story” in which you are the hero of your own life, rather than the victim?\n\nIt is likely that the life story you tell yourself and others changes depending on who is asking, your mood, and whether you feel like you are still at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of your most salient story.\n\nBut when was the last time you paused to consider the stories you tell?\n\n“What is your story?”\n\nNarrative therapy capitalizes on this question and our storytelling tendencies. The goal is to uncover opportunities for growth and development, find meaning, and understand ourselves better.\n\nWe use stories to inform others, connect over shared experiences, say when we feel wronged, and even to sort out our thoughts and feelings. Stories organize our thoughts, help us find meaning and purpose, and establish our identity in a confusing and sometimes lonely world. Thus, it is important to realize what stories we are telling ourselves, and others, when we talk about our lives.\n\nIf you’ve never heard of narrative therapy before, you’re not alone!\n\nThis therapy is a specific and less common method of guiding clients towards healing and personal development. It’s revolves around the stories we tell ourselves and others.\n\nBefore you continue, we thought you might like to download our three Positive Psychology Exercises for free. These science-based exercises will explore fundamental aspects of positive psychology including strengths, values, and self-compassion, and will give you the tools to enhance the wellbeing of your clients, students, or employees.\n\nWhat is Narrative Therapy? A Definition\n\nNarrative therapy is a form of therapy that aims to separate the individual from the problem, allowing the individual to externalize their issues rather than internalize them.\n\nIt relies on the individual’s own skills and sense of purpose to guide them through difficult times (Narrative Therapy, 2017).\n\nThis form of therapy was developed in the 1980s by Michael White and David Epston (About Narrative Therapy, n.d.).\n\nThey believed that separating a person from their problematic or destructive behavior was a vital part of treatment (Michael White (1948-2008), 2015).\n\nFor example, when treating someone who had run afoul of the law, they would encourage the individual to see themselves as a person who made mistakes, rather than as an inherently “bad” felon. White and Epston grounded this new therapeutic model in three main ideas.\n\n1. Narrative therapy is respectful.\n\nThis therapy respects the agency and dignity of every client. It requires each client to be treated as an individual who is not deficient, not defective, or not “enough” in any way.\n\nIndividuals who engage in narrative therapy are brave people who recognize issues they would like to address in their lives.\n\n2. Narrative therapy is non-blaming.\n\nIn this form of therapy, clients are never blamed for their problems, and they are encouraged not to blame others as well. Problems emerge in everyone’s lives due to a variety of factors; in narrative therapy, there is no point in assigning fault to anyone or anything.\n\nNarrative therapy separates people from their problems, viewing them as whole and functional individuals who engage in thought patterns or behavior that they would like to change.\n\n3. Narrative therapy views the client as the expert.\n\nIn narrative therapy, the therapist does not occupy a higher social or academic space than the client. It is understood that the client is the expert in their own life, and both parties are expected to go forth with this understanding.\n\nOnly the client knows their own life intimately and has the skills and knowledge to change their behavior and address their issues (Morgan, 2000).\n\nThese three ideas lay the foundation for the therapeutic relationship and the function of narrative therapy. The foundation of this therapeutic process has this understanding and asks clients to take a perspective that may feel foreign. It can be difficult to place a firm separation between people and the problems they are having.\n\nKey Concepts and Approach\n\nMaking the distinction between “an individual with problems” and a “problematic individual” is vital in narrative therapy. White and Epston theorized that subscribing to a harmful or adverse self-identity could have profound negative impacts on a person’s functionality and quality of life.\n\n“The problem is the problem, the person is not the problem.”\n\nMichael White and David Epston\n\nTo this end, there are a few main themes or principles of narrative therapy:\n\nReality is socially constructed, which means that our interactions and dialogue with others impacts the way we experience reality.\n\nReality is influenced by and communicated through language, which suggests that people who speak different languages may have radically different interpretations of the same experiences.\n\nHaving a narrative that can be understood helps us organize and maintain our reality. In other words, stories and narratives help us to make sense of our experiences.\n\nThere is no “objective reality” or absolute truth; what is true for us may not be the same for another person, or even for ourselves at another point in time (Standish, 2013).\n\nThese principles tie into the postmodernist school of thought, which views reality as a shifting, changing, and deeply personal concept. In postmodernism, there is no objective truth—the truth is what each one of us makes it, influenced by social norms and ideas.\n\nUnlike modern thought that held the following tenets as sacred, postmodern thought holds skepticism over grand narratives, the individual, the idea of neutral language, and universal truth.\n\nThus, the main premise behind narrative therapy is understanding individuals within this postmodern context. If there is no universal truth, then people need to create truths that help them construct a reality that serves themselves and others. Narrative therapy offers those story-shaping skills.\n\nIt’s amazing how much easier solving or negating a problem can be, when you stop seeing the problem as an integral part of who you are, and instead, as simply a problem.\n\n5 Commonly Used Narrative Therapy Techniques\n\nSome of the skills applicable to solving problems through narrative therapy are skills that we may already possess; others take effort to learn and apply.\n\nThe five techniques here are the most common tools used in narrative therapy.\n\n1. Telling One’s Story (Putting Together a Narrative)\n\nAs a therapist or other mental health professional, your job in narrative therapy is to help your client find their voice and tell their story in their own words. According to the philosophy behind narrative therapy, storytelling is how we make meaning and find purpose in our own experience (Standish, 2013).\n\nHelping your client develop their story gives them an opportunity to discover meaning, find healing, and establish or re-establish an identity, all integral factors for success in therapy.\n\nThis technique is also known as “re-authoring” or “re-storying,” as clients explore their experiences to find alterations to their story or make a whole new one. The same events can tell a hundred different stories since we all interpret experiences differently and find different senses of meaning (Dulwich Centre, n.d.).\n\n2. Externalization Technique\n\nThe externalization technique leads your client toward viewing their problems or behaviors as external, instead of an unchangeable part of themselves. This is a technique that is easier to describe than to embrace, but it can have huge positive impacts on self-identity and confidence.\n\nThe general idea of this technique is that it is easier to change a behavior you do, than to change a core personality characteristic.\n\nFor example, if you are quick to anger or you consider yourself an angry person, then you must fundamentally change something about yourself to address the problem; however, if you are a person who acts aggressively and angers easily, then you need to alter the situations and behaviors surrounding the problem.\n\nIt might seem like an insignificant distinction, but there is a profound difference between the mindset of someone who labels themselves as a “problem” person and someone who engages in problematic behavior.\n\nIt may be challenging for the client to absorb this strange idea at first. One first step is to encourage your client not to place too much importance on their diagnosis or self-assigned labels. Let them know how empowering it can be to separate themselves from their problems, and allowing themselves a greater degree of control in their identity (Bishop, 2011).\n\n3. Deconstruction Technique\n\nThis “deconstruction” refers to reducing the problems a client is experiencing, thus making it easier to understand the “whole picture.”\n\nOur problems can feel overwhelming, confusing, or unsolvable, but they are never truly unsolvable (Bishop, 2011).\n\nDeconstructing makes the issue more specific and reduces overgeneralizing; it also clarifies what the core issue or issues actually are.\n\nAs an example of the deconstruction technique, imagine two people in a long-term relationship who are having trouble. One partner is feeling frustrated with a partner who never shares her feelings, thoughts, or ideas with him. Based on this short description, there is no clear idea of what the problem is, let alone what the solution might be.\n\nA therapist might deconstruct the problem with this client by asking them to be more specific about what is bothering them, rather than accepting a statement such as, “my spouse doesn’t get me anymore.”\n\nThis might lead to a better idea of what is troubling the client, such as general themes of feeling lonely or missing romantic intimacy. Maybe the client has construed a narrative where they are the victim of this helpless relationship, rather than someone with a problem coping with loneliness and communicating this vulnerability with their partner.\n\nDeconstructing the problem helps people understand what the root of problems (in this case, someone is feeling lonely and vulnerable) and what this means to them (in this case, like their partner doesn’t want them anymore or is not willing to commit to the relationship like they are).\n\nThis technique is an excellent way to help the client dig into the problem and understand the foundation of the stressful event or pattern in their life.\n\n4. Unique Outcomes Technique\n\nThis technique is complex but vital for the storytelling aspect of narrative therapy.\n\nThe unique outcomes technique involves changing one’s own storyline. In narrative therapy, the client aims to construct a storyline to their experiences that offers meaning, or gives them a positive and functional identity. This is not as misguided as “thinking positive,” but rather, a specific technique for clients to develop life-affirming stories.\n\nWe are not limited to just one storyline, though. There are many potential storylines we can subscribe to, some more helpful than others.\n\nLike a book that switches viewpoints from one character to another, our life has multiple threads of narrative with different perspectives, areas of focus, and points of interest. The unique outcomes technique focuses on a different storyline or storylines than the one holding the source of your problems.\n\nUsing this technique might sound like avoiding the problem, but it’s actually just reimagining the problem. What seems like a problem or issue from one perspective can be nothing but an unassuming or insignificant detail in another\n\n(Bishop, 2011).\n\nAs a therapist, you can introduce this technique by encouraging client(s) to pursue new storylines.\n\n5. Existentialism\n\nYou might have a particular association with the term “existentialism” that makes its presence here seem odd, but there is likely more to existentialism than you think.\n\nExistentialism is not a bleak and hopeless view on a world without meaning.\n\nIn general, existentialists believe in a world with no inherent meaning; if there is no given meaning, then people can create their own meaning. In this way, existentialism and narrative therapy go hand in hand. Narrative therapy encourages individuals to find their meaning and purpose rather than search for an absolute truth that does not necessarily resonate for themselves.\n\nIf your client is an avid reader, you might consider suggesting some existentialist works as well, such as those by Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, or Martin Heidegger.\n\nThe visual below helps summarize what narrative therapy is, and how it can be used.\n\nYou can download the printable version of the infographic here.\n\n3 More Narrative Therapy Exercises and Interventions\n\nWhile narrative therapy is more of a dialogue between the therapist and client, there are some exercises and activities to supplement the regular therapy sessions. A few of these are described below.\n\n1. Statement of Position Map\n\nThis simple handout consists of four areas for the client to write about:\n\nCharacteristics and naming or labeling of the problem\n\nMapping the effects of the problem throughout each domain of life it touches (home, work, school, relationships, etc.)\n\nEvaluation of the effects of the problem in these domains\n\nValues that come up when thinking about why these effects are undesirable\n\nThis map is intended to be filled out in concert with a therapist, but it can be explored if it is difficult to find a narrative therapist.\n\nGenerally, the dialogue between a therapist and client will delve into these four areas. The therapist can ask questions and probe for deeper inquiry, while the client discusses the problem they are having and seeks insight in any of the four main areas listed above. There is power in the act of naming the problem and slowly shifting the idea that we are a passive viewer of our lives.\n\nFinally, it is vital for the client to understand why this problem bothers them on a deeper level. What values are being infringed upon or obstructed by this problem? Why does the client feel negative about the problem? For example, what does the “stressful dinner party” bring up for them? Perhaps feelings of social anxiety and “otherness” that feel isolating? These are questions that this exercise can help to answer.\n\nFor a much more comprehensive look at this exercise, you can read these workshop notes from Michael White on using the statement position maps.\n\nYou can also access a PowerPoint in which a similar exercise is covered here.\n\n2. My Life Story\n\nOne of the most basic therapeutic principles in narrative therapy is that we find meaning and healing through telling stories.\n\nThis exercise is all about your story, and all you need is the printout and a pen or pencil.\n\nThe intention of the My Life Story exercise is to separate yourself from your past and gain a broader perspective on your life. It aims to create an outline of your life that does not revolve too intensly around memories as much as moments of intensity or growth.\n\nFirst, you write the title of the book that is your life. Maybe it is simply “Monica’s Life Story,” or something more reflective of the themes you see in your life, like “Monica: A Story of Perseverance.”\n\nIn the next section, come up with at least seven chapter titles, each one representing a significant stage or event in your life. Once you have the chapter title, come up with one sentence that sums up the chapter. For example, your chapter title could be “Awkward and Uncertain” and the description may read “My teenage years were dominated by a sense of uncertainty and confusion in a family of seven.”\n\nNext, you will consider your final chapter and add a description of your life in the future. What will you do in the future? Where will you go, and who will you be? This is where you get to flex your predictive muscles.\n\nFinally, the last step is to add to your chapters as necessary to put together a comprehensive story of your life.\n\nThis exercise will help you to organize your thoughts and beliefs about your life and weave together a story that makes sense to you. The idea is not to get too deep into any specific memories, but instead to recognize that what is in your past is truly the past. It shaped you, but it does not have to define you. Your past made you the reflective and wiser person of today.\n\nYou can download this worksheet here.\n\nWorld’s Largest Positive Psychology Resource\n\nThe Positive Psychology Toolkit© is a groundbreaking practitioner resource containing over 500 science-based exercises, activities, interventions, questionnaires, and assessments created by experts using the latest positive psychology research.\n\nUpdated monthly. 100% Science-based.\n\n“The best positive psychology resource out there!”\n\n— Emiliya Zhivotovskaya, Flourishing Center CEO\n\n3. Expressive Arts\n\nThis intervention can be especially useful for children, but adults may find relief and meaning in it as well.\n\nWe all have different methods of telling our stories, and using the arts to do so has been a staple of humanity for countless generations. To take advantage of this expressive and creative way to tell your stories, explore the different methods at your disposal.\n\nYou can:\n\nMeditate. Guided relaxation or individual meditation can be an effective way to explore a problem.\n\nJournal. Journaling has many potential benefits. Consider a specific set of question s (e.g., How does the problem affect you? How did the problem take hold in your life?) or simply write a description of yourself or your story from the point of view of the problem. This can be difficult but can lead to a greater understanding of the problem and how it influences the domains of your life.\n\nDraw. If you’re more interested in depictions of the problem’s impact on your experience, you can use your skills to draw or paint the effects of the problem. You can create a symbolic drawing, map the effects of the problem, or create a cartoon that represents the problem in your life. If drawing sounds intimidating, you can even doodle abstract shapes with the colors of the emotions you feel, and keywords that express your reflection in that moment.\n\nMovement. You can use the simple medium of movement and mindfulness to create and express your story. Begin by moving in your usual way, then allow the problem to influence your movement. Practice mindful observation to see what changes when you let the problem take hold. Next, develop a transitional movement that begins to shake the problem’s hold on you. Finally, transition into a “liberation movement” to metaphorically and physically explore how to escape the problem.\n\nVisualization. Use visualization techniques to consider how your life might be in a week, a month, a year, or a few years, both with this problem continuing and in a timeline where you embrace a new direction. Share your experience with a partner or therapist, or reflect in your journal to explore the ways in which this exercise helped you find meaning or new possibilities for your life (Freeman, 2013).\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how to put your creativity to work on developing a more positive story, follow this link or click here to dive a little deeper into expressive arts therapy.\n\nDownload 3 Free Positive Psychology Exercises (PDF)\n\nEnhance wellbeing with these free, science-based exercises that draw on the latest insights from positive psychology.\n\nDownload PDF\n\nExamples of Questions to Ask Your Clients\n\nNarrative therapy is a dialogue in which both you and your client converse to learn about your story. As you may imagine, it requires many questions on the part of the therapist.\n\n“Every time we ask a question, we’re generating a possible version of a life.”\n\nDavid Epston\n\nThe list of questions below is intended to go with the statement of position maps, but these questions can be useful outside of this exercise too:\n\nIt sounds as though [problem] is part of your life now.\n\nHow long have you been noticing this [problem]?\n\nWhat effect does the [problem] have on your life?\n\nHow does the [problem] impact on your energy for daily tasks?\n\nDoes [problem] have an impact on your relationship with other family members?\n\nWhat effects does [problem] have on your child’s life?\n\nWhat do you think about the effects [problem] is having on your life?\n\nAre you accepting what [problem] is doing?\n\nAre these effects acceptable to you or not?\n\nWhy is this? Why are you taking this position on what [problem] is doing?\n\nHow would you prefer things to be?\n\nIf you were to stay connected to what you have just said about what you prefer, what next steps could you take?\n\nThe website www.integratedfamilytherapy.com also provides excellent examples of questions to ask your client as you move through their story:\n\nEnabling Openings\n\nCan you describe the last time you managed to get free of the problem for a couple of minutes? What was the first thing you noticed in those few minutes? What was the next thing?\n\nLinking Openings with Preferred Experience\n\nWould you like more minutes like these in your life?\n\nMoving from Openings to Alternative Story Development.\n\nWhat was each of you thinking/feeling/doing/wishing/imagining during those few minutes?\n\nBroadening the Viewpoint.\n\nWhat might your friend have noticed about you if she had met up with you in those few minutes?\n\nExploring Landscapes of Action.\n\nHow did you achieve that? How did Tim help you with that?\n\nExploring Landscapes of Consciousness.\n\nWhat have you learned about what you can manage from those few minutes?\n\nLinking with the Exceptions in the Past.\n\nTell me about times when you have managed to achieve a similar few minutes in the past?\n\nLinking Exceptions from the Past with the Present.\n\nWhen you think about those times in the past when you have achieved this, how might this alter your view of the problem now?\n\nLinking Exceptions from the Past with the Future.Thinking about this now, what do you expect to do next?\n\nYou can download the printable version of the infographic here.\n\nNarrative Therapy Treatment Plan\n\nDeveloping a treatment plan for narrative therapy is a personal and intensive activity in any therapeutic relationship, and there are guidelines for how to incorporate an effective plan.\n\nThis PDF provides a profile of a treatment plan, including goals and guidelines for each stage and theories that can apply to the client’s treatment.\n\nThe co-founder of narrative therapy, Michael White, offers an additional resource for therapists using narrative therapy.\n\nAccording to White, there are three main processes in treatment:\n\n1) Externalization of the problem, which mirrors the steps of the position mapping exercise:\n\nDeveloping a particular, experience-near definition of the problem;\n\nMapping the effects of the problem;\n\nEvaluating the effects of the problem;\n\nand justifying the evaluation.\n\n2) Re-authoring conversations by:\n\nHelping the client include neglected aspects of themselves;\n\nand shifting the problem-centered narrative.\n\n3) Remembering conversations that actively engage the client in the process of:\n\nRenewing their relationships;\n\nRemoving the relationships that no longer serve them;\n\nand finding meaning in their story that is no longer problem-saturated as much as resilient-rich.\n\nBest Books on Narrative Therapy\n\nIf you’re as much of a bookworm as I am, you’ll want a list of suggested reading to complement this piece.
