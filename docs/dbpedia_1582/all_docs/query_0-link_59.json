Explore data and research on time use.\n\nTime is the ultimate limited resource. Every one of us has the same “time budget” — 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, giving a total of 8,760 hours — each year of our lives.\n\nHow do we spend our time? There are many commonalities across the world: we all sleep, work, eat, and enjoy leisure time. But there are also important differences in the freedom people have to spend time on the things they value most.\n\nStudying how people across the world spend their time provides an important perspective for understanding living conditions, economic opportunities, and general well-being.\n\nHere we present the data on time use. We explore how it differs across countries and over time and how these differences matter for people’s lives.\n\nOn our related topic page on Working Hours, you can read more about people’s time spent working and how this varies around the world.\n\nSee all interactive charts on time use ↓\n\nWorking Hours\n\nHow much time do people across the world spend working? How have working hours changed over time, and what do these changes matter for people’s lives? Explore data and research on working hours.\n\nLoneliness and Social Connections\n\nIn this topic page, we explore data on loneliness and social connections and review available evidence on the link between social connections and well-being.\n\nTime use from the perspective of an average day\n\nHow do people across the world spend their time and what does this tell us about living conditions?\n\nSleep, work, eat, leisure — at a high level most of us spend time on similar activities. But just how similar are the daily activities of people across the world?\n\nThis is something worth considering, not just to serve our curiosity but because differences in the way we spend time give us meaningful perspectives on living conditions, economic opportunities, and general well-being.\n\nHere we take a look at the data on time use. We explore some of the key patterns that emerge from cross-country time use surveys, and then dig deeper to understand how these differences matter for people’s well-being.\n\nDaily activities: similarities and differences across countries\n\nIn the chart below we compare the average time spent across several common activities.\n\nThe data comes from the OECD and brings together estimates from time diaries where respondents are asked to record the sequence of what they did over a specific day, as well as from general questionnaires where respondents are asked to recall the amount of time spent on different activities on a specific day in the previous week.1\n\nThe first thing that jumps out from this chart is that there are indeed many similarities across countries.\n\nThis is not surprising — most of us try to split our days into “work, rest, and fun”, and so there are some predictable patterns. We spend the most time working and sleeping. Together, paid work, housework, leisure, eating, and sleeping take 80–90% of all the 1440 minutes in a day.\n\nWork is an important activity where we see large differences. Countries are sorted by paid work hours in the chart — from highest to lowest. On an average day, people in China and Mexico spend almost twice as much time on paid work as people in Italy and France do. This is a general pattern: people in richer countries can afford to work less. Keep in mind that this chart shows the average for all people in the working age bracket, from 15 to 64 years, whether or not they are employed.3\n\nRead more on our page on working hours:\n\nWorking Hours\n\nHow much time do people across the world spend working? How have working hours changed over time, and what do these changes matter for people’s lives? Explore data and research on working hours.\n\nDifferences in demographics, education, and economic prosperity all contribute to these inequalities in work and time use.\n\nBut what’s clear in the chart here is that some differences in time use are not well explained by economic or demographic differences. In the UK, for example, people spend more time working than in France, but in both countries, people report spending a similar amount of time on leisure activities.\n\nCultural differences are likely to play a role here. The French seem to spend much more time eating than the British — and in this respect, the data goes in line with stereotypes about food culture. People in France, Greece, Italy, and Spain report spending more time eating than people in most other European countries. The country where people spend the least time eating and drinking is the USA.\n\nGoing beyond averages: The gender gap in leisure time\n\nGoing beyond national averages reveals important inequalities within countries. The gender gap in leisure time, for example, is a key dimension along which large inequalities exist.\n\nThe chart here relies on the same time-use data described above but it shows total leisure time for men and women separately.\n\nTime for men is shown on the horizontal axis, while time for women appears on the vertical axis. The dotted diagonal line denotes \"gender parity\", so the further away a country is from the diagonal line, the larger the difference between men and women.\n\nAs we can see, in all countries the average leisure time for men is higher than for women — all bubbles are below the diagonal line — but in some countries, the gaps are much larger. In Norway, the difference is very small, while in Portugal men report much more leisure time than women.\n\nA key factor driving these differences in leisure time is the gender gap in unpaid work. As we explain in detail on our page on women’s employment, women are responsible for a disproportionate amount of unpaid work and have less leisure as a result.4\n\nWomen's Employment\n\nHow does women’s labor force participation differ across countries? How has it changed over time? What is behind these differences and changes?\n\nWhy should we care about differences in time use?\n\nEvery single one of us has the same “time budget”: 24 hours per day and 365 days per year. But of course, not all of us can choose to spend time on the activities that we enjoy most. Differences in our freedom to allocate time to the things we enjoy are the main reasons why time-use data is important for studying living conditions.\n\nIn the UK, researchers from the Centre for Time Use Research linked time-use diaries with the respondents’ assessments of enjoyment, on a scale from 1 to 7, to better understand the connection between time use and well-being.\n\nThe chart here, which we’ve adapted from the book \"What We Really Do All Day’, by professors Jonathan Gershuny and Oriel Sullivan, shows the results. The estimates correspond to average reported levels of enjoyment for each activity, with confidence intervals.5\n\nWe see that the most-enjoyed activities involve rest or leisure activities — such as eating out, sleeping, going to sports events, playing computer games, or attending cultural performances. The activities receiving the lowest ratings include doing school homework, looking for a job, or doing housework.\n\nThe activity where people show the greatest variation in enjoyment is working a “Second Job”. This likely reflects the difference between people who work a second job because they want to, and those who work a second job because they have to.\n\nSo what do we learn from this?\n\nFirst, we learn that the enjoyment of activities is, at least to some degree, predictable and stable. This means we can take activity groups and make meaningful comparisons across groups of people. Economists, for example, often classify any activity with an enjoyment level below work as a “non-leisure activity”, to measure trends in leisure across people and time.7\n\nBut beyond this, and more importantly, this confirms that time-use is informative about well-being.\n\nThe fact that there is a very clear and predictable pattern in the enjoyment of activities suggests that differences in time use do, indeed, give us meaningful perspectives on living conditions and economic opportunities. In countries where people do more paid and unpaid work, and have less time for leisure, their enjoyment — and happiness and life satisfaction — levels are likely to be lower.\n\nTime use from the perspective of the life cycle\n\nWho do we spend time with across our lifetime?\n\nAs we go through life we build personal relationships with different people — family, friends, coworkers, partners.\n\nThese relationships, which are deeply important to all of us, evolve with time. As we grow older we build new relationships while others transform or fade, and towards the end of life, many of us spend a lot of time alone.\n\nTaking the big picture over the entire life course: Who do we actually spend our time with?\n\nFrom adolescence to old age: who do we spend our time with?\n\nTo understand how social connections evolve throughout our lives we can look at survey data on how much time people spend with others, and who that time is spent with.\n\nThe chart here shows the amount of time that people in the US report spending in the company of others, based on their age.\n\nThe data comes from time-use surveys, where people are asked to list all the activities that they perform over a full day, and the people who were there during each activity. We currently only have data with this granularity for the US — time-use surveys are common across many countries, but what is special about the US is that respondents of the American Time Use Survey are asked to list everyone who was present during each activity.\n\nThe numbers in this chart are based on averages for a cross-section of American society — people are only interviewed once, but we have brought together a decade of surveys, tabulating the average amount of time that survey respondents of different ages report spending with other people.8\n\nWho we spend our time with changes a lot over the course of life\n\nWhen we’re young — particularly in our teens — we spend a lot of our time with friends, parents, siblings, and extended family.\n\nAs we enter our 20s, time with friends, siblings, and parents starts to drop off quickly. Instead, we start spending an increasing amount of time with partners and children. The chart shows an average across Americans, so for those that have children the time spent with children is even higher, since the average is pulled down by those without children.\n\nAs the chart shows, this continues throughout our 30s, 40s, and 50s — over this period of their life, Americans spend much of their time with partners, children, and, unsurprisingly, co-workers.\n\nFor those 60 and older, we see a significant drop-off in time spent with co-workers. This makes sense, considering many people in the US enter retirement in their mid-60s. We see that this time is partly displaced by more time with partners.\n\nHow about the number of people we interact with? This chart suggests that the number of people with whom we interact is highest around 40, but then things change substantially after that. And this is perhaps the most conspicuous trend in the chart: above 40, people spend an increasing amount of time alone.\n\nOlder people spend a lot of time alone\n\nOlder people spend a large amount of time alone and it is understandable why — time spent alone increases with age because this is when health typically deteriorates and people lose relatives and friends.\n\nIndeed, many people who are older than 60 live alone as this chart shows clearly: living alone is particularly common for older adults.\n\nAnother interesting point here is that the share of people across all age groups who live alone has been rising over time.\n\nThis is part of a more general global trend — if you want to read more about the global \"rise of living alone\", we provide a detailed account of this trend across countries in this article:\n\nOlder people spend more time alone, but this doesn’t necessarily mean they’re lonely\n\nThe data shows that as we become older we tend to spend more and more time alone. What’s more, the data also shows that older people today spend more time alone than older people did in the past.\n\nWe might think older people are therefore more lonely — but this is not necessarily the case.\n\nSpending time alone is not the same as feeling lonely. This is a point that is well recognized by researchers, and one which has been confirmed empirically across countries. Surveys that ask people about living arrangements, time use, and feelings of loneliness find that solitude, by itself, is not a good predictor of loneliness.\n\nYou can read our overview of the evidence in our article:\n\nAre people more likely to be lonely in so-called 'individualistic' societies?\n\nIn countries such as Denmark and Switzerland, it is very common for people to live alone; but contrary to what many believe, this does not translate into higher loneliness. Loneliness and aloneness are not the same.\n\nSo, what about loneliness? If we focus on self-reported loneliness, there is little evidence of an upward trend over time in the US, and importantly, it’s not the case that loneliness keeps going up as we become older.\n\nIn fact, a recent study based on surveys that track the same individuals over time found that after age 50 — which is the earliest age of participants in the analysis — loneliness tended to decrease, until about 75, after which it began to increase again.9\n\nTaking the evidence together, the message is not that we should be sad about the prospect of aging, but rather that we should recognize the fact that social connections are complex.\n\nWe often look at the amount of time spent with others as a marker of social well-being — but the quality of time spent with others, and our expectations, matter even more for our feelings of connection and loneliness.\n\nCite this work\n\nOur articles and data visualizations rely on work from many different people and organizations.
