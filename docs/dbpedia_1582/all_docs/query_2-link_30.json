See Apply for a Non-Virginia Address Exception for more.\n\nIf you are due to renew your license or ID, please ensure that your current address is on file with DMV before the renewal is processed.\n\nIf not due for renewal soon, you would need to replace your license or ID for the address to be reflected there."
