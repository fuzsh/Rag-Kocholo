        "text": "One hundred and nine days. At the end of all of this, all of this small journey in a year, I will have learned a lot. So much in fact that writing it all down does no justice at all. All I will have are the memories, a couple photos, and maybe a collection of postcards I’ve sent to loved ones. My time in Europe is coming to an end but in full transparency, I couldn’t be happier. This part of my life, this little part, is not called happiness. That moment, that Will Smith title moment of happyness is reserved for the day I get home.\n\nJude King, a research scientist and professor, once said that, “Work is more meaningful when daily responsibilities have broader significance.” And I fully agree. There could not be a better way to describe the way I feel about my time in Europe. That being said, this does not mean that I believe that my work here has been meaningful. In fact I think quite the opposite.\n\nMy time in Europe has come with a strong absence of significance.\n\nI feel that although I am experiencing plenty, none of it holds any significance. To me, learning in a foreign country brought nothing but irregular schedules, a lack of daily structure, and the lack of an opportunity to learn in a field I plan to pursue. My official degree at University will be Urban and Regional Planning, and that is one of my largest regrets in life as of yet. Having had the chance to expand my knowledge of the subject and learn about my major in another country did in fact show me that I should’ve chosen something more factually based. In an interview with an Urban Planner for the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the interviewee was asked about budget and how much a certain project would cost.\n\n“We have no idea.”\n\nThis paraphrased response was a surprise to all of us as students. But despite the fact that not even a ball-park budget could be provided, the urban planners had continued with the project, planning acres of the site to be destroyed or removed, and replaced with a much newer, higher quality facility. They had developed models and renderings of what could come in the future, all under the guise of an illegitimate and non-existent budget. So yes, I have learned a surprising amount in Germany, but more so about my environment and surroundings rather than something educational. This makes me quite nervous about arriving home and having to face the question, “so what did you learn?”\n\nIt has been said before that when you come in with expectations, you’re bound to be disappointed. So, because of this I came to Germany with zero expectations, yet somehow I was still let down. I’m not going to say that the entire experience was a waste, but to say that I enjoyed most of my time in Europe would be grossly inappropriate. This is not to say that when asked, the rest of the class might have the same response, but my experience was not something I’m necessarily happy about.\n\nMy favorite part of the entire trip existed in multiple moments. These moments consisted of texts and phone calls describing how happy someone was back in the states after they had received my post cards. Sending post cards has become one of my favorite hobbies, and to stop sending legitimate mail once I return would be a pity. I’ve enjoyed this thoroughly, and it seemed like a valuable way of spending my time. Not only did sending mail home prove to be a relaxing way to spend my time, but it also preserved and maintain the relationships I have back home.\n\nI would, however, also like to point out some German things I still do not understand. Although some of these examples I will provide are not in any way bad, for some people they are quite understandable, but for myself I struggle to comprehend these things.\n\nNumber one. I have yet to understand why cleaning plates and other dishes before moving them to the dish washer is an odd thing. My host family was appalled when I cleaned my plate before placing it in the dishwasher. “Nonsense,” they said, “the dishwasher will clean the dishes.” Which, in theory makes sense…but then your dishwasher begins to smell prior to being run. Personally, I don’t appreciate putting dishes in the dish washer and having to clean my hands afterward because of the grime found in the dishwasher.\n\nNumber two. I’m quite perplexed and intrigued by how public urination is treated. Where as in the United States it is extremely frowned on, public urination in Germany is quite a normal thing, and there are even public places that have small, open urinals for all to use. I believe the main intent was to solve the number of homeless people relieving themselves wherever they please…but if restrooms didn’t charge a fee, then I don’t see this as being a problem in the first place. I’m not in charge here though, so maybe the things that I do not know negate any argument I hold.\n\nNumber three. The hype around sparkling water. Although I don’t mind it, and I know Americans often drink it too, it seems like such an integral part of every German household.\n\nI could go on for a couple chapters. Things like knocking on the table instead of clapping, or the strictness surrounding jaywalking, or how serious littering is, yet the streets are filled with cigarette butts. So no, no I don’t understand."
