        "text": "Providing practical support\n\nMany people worry about how they’ll manage the day-to-day tasks of caring for someone. To make it easier and safer to care for the person at home, you may need to modify the environment, or buy or rent equipment.\n\nSome carers prefer to provide practical support themselves and just need some guidance from a health professional. Other carers find providing personal care awkward or overwhelming and prefer to have it given by someone else. The palliative care team can help reduce your stress and free you up to spend time with the person you’re caring for in a way that is comfortable for you.\n\nPractical ways to help\n\nProviding emotional support\n\nThe diagnosis of a terminal illness may be a crisis for family and friends. How everyone responds may depend on their relationship with the person dying and their own beliefs about death. It is natural to feel shocked, angry, scared, sad or relieved.\n\nYou may be worried about discussing the end of life with the person who is dying because you think you’ll upset them. It may be helpful to know that people who are dying often want to talk about what is happening but are afraid the topic will upset their loved ones. Starting the conversation can be difficult, but the opportunity to share feelings can be valuable for both of you.\n\nAs the person you are caring for nears the final days of life, there are still many ways to spend time together:\n\nsit with them without talking\n\nread a book\n\nlook through old photo albums and talk about the pictures\n\nsing a song\n\nshare some special memory or experiences you’ve had together\n\nor tell them that you love them and that family send their love.\n\nWhen someone is ill for some time, their family and friends often begin to grieve their death before it happens. This is known as anticipatory grief. You may find yourself wishing for the person’s life to be over. It’s also not unusual to start thinking about how you’ll cope, other events in your life and the future. It may help to speak to a counsellor about your feelings or Cancer Council on 13 11 20.\n\nSaying goodbye\n\nWhen you don't know what to say\n\nMaking arrangements\n\nProviding physical support\n\nWatching the physical changes of someone dying can be upsetting. It may help to know that they are a normal part of the dying process, and don’t mean that the person is distressed or uncomfortable.\n\nYou don’t have to face these changes alone – loved ones, your palliative care team and Cancer Council can provide comfort and support.\n\nSigns that someone is dying\n\nHow you can help in the final stages\n\nKeeping a vigil\n\nChoosing the moment to die\n\nAfter someone dies\n\nEven when death is expected, it’s common to feel upset, sad or shocked. An expected death is not an emergency and what you need to do depends on the circumstances.\n\nWhat to do after the death\n\nFuneral and religious services\n\nLegal and financial matters\n\nGrief\n\n“I had promised Mum that after she died, I would make sure she had her favourite lippy on. I did this at the funeral parlour before the final viewing of her body. She was wearing the dress we had chosen together.” Judith"
