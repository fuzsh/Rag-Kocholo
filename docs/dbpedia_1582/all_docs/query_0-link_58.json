        "text": "Time — friend or foe?\n\nIn their battle to come to terms with the arrow of time, people have discovered different means to tame the passing of years, months, and days. They invented the clock, the calendar, and spent countless hours trying to figure out the concept of time.\n\nOne thing after another, they put their fears into words — and we are left with a good deal of wise quotes about time.\n\nSo nowadays, whenever we struggle with scheduling our time, prioritizing, or being late, we can turn to Shakespeare’s or Leonardo da Vinci’s famous sayings — and see that similar issues troubled them, too.\n\nLuckily, you don’t have to spend hours combing through dusty books or hidden corners of the Internet to hear what the world’s best thinkers have to say. We already did that for you!\n\nSo, we present you the 150+ best time quotes.\n\n10 Best time quotes\n\nWhether the FOMO makes your anxiety go through the roof or you just struggle with keeping up with your daily to-do list — the world’s greatest minds have already been there.\n\nWe’ve selected 10 all-time best quotes to help you change your perspective on time and make the most out of your days.\n\nLet’s hear what the wise had to say.\n\n1. “We must use time as a tool, not as a couch.” — John F. Kennedy\n\nWhile different cultures have various perceptions of time, one thing is certain: waiting for time to simply pass you by is a waste. You should learn to use time to your advantage.\n\nOnce we start understanding how time can be used as a tool rather than something we passively rely on, achieving goals gets much easier!\n\n2. “Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.” — Marthe Troly-Curtin\n\nThis famous line holds a true sentiment. Within “the grind” culture today, it might seem that whatever doesn’t make us money or is an investment in the future is a waste of time.\n\nYet, as many as 94% of people value work-life balance and believe spending time on things that enrich us (just not financially) is just as important.\n\nSo, instead of overworking, try going for simple activities that’ll perk you up.\n\nIf you love watching TV shows, enjoy your Netflix binge. Go window shopping for hours or spend time with your loved ones. Appreciate your downtime guilt-free.\n\nAs long as you enjoy an activity, the amount of time spent on it doesn’t matter.\n\n3. “Time is what we want most but what we use worst.” — William Penn\n\nOnly 12% of people have a dedicated time management system, a recent Timewatch survey shows. Despite the alarmingly low numbers, many people believe that proper time management reduces stress, increases productivity, and brings more focus and confidence at work.\n\nStill we tend to lose a lot of time on unnecessary things — a minute here, ten minutes there, and we end up with an entire wasted day on meaningless tasks.\n\nLearning how to manage our time is a skill that requires constant work. So, to use time in the best way possible, it’s important to come up with a system and schedule that makes our time use more efficient.\n\n4. “Tough times never last, but tough people do.” — Robert H. Schuller\n\nWe frequently hear “This too shall pass,” as a way of comforting ourselves during difficult times. But what we often forget is that those moments are when we truly grow, harden, and evolve.\n\nBy simply waiting for a rough period to pass, we lose out on the opportunity to learn from the experience and become stronger. See what lessons you can learn and let time make you wiser.\n\n5. “ ‘Someday’ is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you.” — Timothy Ferriss\n\nWe’ve all heard stories of people regretting not taking a chance on their dreams because they weren’t good enough yet, weren’t confident enough, or lacked the resources or support.\n\nThese stories, however, aren’t complete fiction.\n\nWhen we keep promising ourselves that “someday” we’ll realize our passion, we effectively lose time.\n\nIt is better to take a risk and put in the effort to realize a dream because then we get the chance to learn and improve. Otherwise, we’re left with a perpetual “what if…”\n\n6. “Yesterday’s the past, tomorrow’s the future, but today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present.” — Bil Keane\n\nThis quote is a good reminder that we should appreciate the time we have now because not everyone is lucky enough to have it. Also, dwelling on the past only makes us less productive and more anxious.\n\nThus, appreciating the moment you have right now does wonders for motivation and overcoming difficulties.\n\n7. “Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.” — William Shakespeare\n\nIn this quote from The Merry Wives of Windsor, Shakespeare alluded to the benefits of doing something earlier rather than missing an opportunity.\n\nIt is so easy to put off things like writing up an email, checking a job listing, getting a medical check-up, and so on. We get lost in other things until it becomes too late.\n\nCombat your procrastination, even if it means doing something way before the deadline.\n\n8. “The past always looks better than it was. It’s only pleasant because it isn’t here.” — Finley Peter Dunne\n\nHave you noticed how each generation tends to reminisce about their past, claiming it was much better in their day?\n\nAs it turns out, it is a very human thing to do — our brains tend to embellish good memories. In fact, researchers found that positive memories stay with us much longer than negative ones. They call this “fading affect bias.”\n\nSo, the times haven’t changed, only our perception of them.\n\nTake your past with a grain of salt, and remember to take some pressure off the time you live in.\n\n9. “The time for action is now. It’s never too late to do something.” — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\n\nIt’s a common saying that there are no age limits to anything in life. Morgan Freeman landed his first big role at 52, and Winston Churchill became Prime Minister at 66!\n\nLet go of any fears or embarrassment that you are too young or too old to take up a career endeavor, especially if it’s something you’re deeply passionate about and you love doing it. The only mistake you can make is waiting so long that you give up in the end.\n\n10. “Time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead.” — Harry Potter\n\nEven though this quote comes from a work of fiction, it’s an important one nonetheless.\n\nWith this thought from the book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, J.K. Rowling pointed out that no matter how much we wish to stop time when hardship is on the horizon, we can’t go against it.\n\nThe biggest favor we can do ourselves is to accept the passage of time, both when good and bad things happen. The sooner we face our troubles, the sooner they’ll be over.\n\nTime quotes on waiting for the perfect moment\n\nA lot of us struggle with making the right decision, and we tend to wait for a better moment to start something.\n\nHow many times can we tell ourselves “The time is not right” or “I’m not ready yet” before it is too late to grab an opportunity?\n\nLet’s see what some great minds had to say about that “perfect timing.”\n\n1. “Do not wait; the time will never be ‘just right.’ Start where you stand and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.” — George Herbert\n\n2. “Time is a created thing. To say ‘I don’t have time,’ is to say, ‘I don’t want to.’” — Lao Tzu\n\n3. “You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don’t try to forget the mistakes, but you don’t dwell on it. You don’t let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space.” — Johnny Cash\n\n4. “If you don’t have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?” — John Wooden\n\n5. “Any action is often better than no action, especially if you have been stuck in an unhappy situation for a long time. If it is a mistake, at least you learn something, in which case it’s no longer a mistake. If you remain stuck, you learn nothing.” — Eckhart Tolle\n\n6. “There are two types of patience. One is exercised in hard work and the other in idleness. Patience with hard work is the one that moves mountains. Patience in idleness moves nothing, not even cobwebs.” — Israelmore Ayivor\n\n7. “Your success will be in direct proportion to how you spend your ‘free’ time.” — Mike Dunlap\n\n8. “If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done.” — Bruce Lee\n\n9. “You may delay, but time will not.” — Benjamin Franklin\n\n10. “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.” — Steve Jobs\n\n11. “You will never find time for anything. If you want time you must make it.” — Charles Buxton\n\n12. “The way we spend our time defines who we are.” — Jonathan Estrin\n\n13. “Remember, today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.” — Dale Carnegie\n\n14. “This time, like all times, is a very good one, if we but know what to do with it.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\n15. “Don’t let the fear of the time it will take to accomplish something stand in the way of your doing it. The time will pass anyway; we might just as well put that passing time to the best possible use.” ― Earl Nightingale\n\n16. “If you wait for the perfect moment when all is safe and assured, it may never arrive. Mountains will not be climbed, races won, or lasting happiness achieved.” ― Maurice Chevalier\n\nTime and work quotes\n\nWe worry a lot about time in relation to our work, as well. Sometimes, our work days seem to stretch into eternity, and other times, they fly by leaving us with little time to finish up our tasks.\n\nPerhaps a proper habit-tracking app is the solution.\n\nOr maybe a motivating quote can help you acknowledge the importance of tracking your time.\n\nThe following quotes are meant to give you another view of how you use your time at work — where you may be wasting it, investing it poorly, or how to prioritize your tasks better.\n\n17. “Don’t spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door.” — Coco Chanel\n\n18. “People are often so busy living that they never stopped to wonder why.” — Terry Pratchett\n\n19. “It’s not about the paycheck, it’s about respect, it’s about looking in the mirror and knowing that you’ve done something valuable with your day.” — Dave Kovic\n\n20. “The great dividing line between success and failure can be expressed in five words: ‘I did not have time.’” — Franklin Field\n\n21. “Don’t watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.” — Sam Levenson\n\n22. “When I’m doing a movie, I’m not doing anything else. It’s all about the movie. I don’t have a wife. I don’t have a kid. Nothing can get in my way… I’ve made a choice, so far, to go on this road alone. Because this is my time. This is my time to make movies.” — Quentin Tarantino\n\n23. “A person who has not done one half his day’s work by ten o’clock runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.” ― Emily Bronte\n\n24. “I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now.” ― Edna Mode, The Incredibles\n\n25. “If you trust in yourself… and believe in your dreams… and follow your star… you’ll still get beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren’t so lazy.” — Terry Pratchett\n\n26. “We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.” — Alan Turing\n\n27. “By faithfully working eight hours a day you may eventually get to be boss and work twelve hours a day.” ― Robert Frost\n\n28. “It’s not enough to be busy, so are the ants. The question is, what are we busy about?” ― Henry David Thoreau\n\nTime and life quotes\n\nAchieving a work-life balance in this day and age can be a struggle. Some are not sold on the “hustle culture” and highly value their private time, while others believe that working 120 hours a week allows them to reap rewards later.\n\nSo, whenever you start wondering how to strike the perfect balance, maybe one of these thoughts can be a reminder of how precious this time is.\n\n29. “Have regular hours for work and play; make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth will bring few regrets and life will become a beautiful success.” — Louisa May Alcott\n\n30. “Life isn’t a matter of milestones, but of moments.” — Rose Kennedy\n\n31. “It’s surprising how much free time and productivity you gain when you lose the busyness in your mind.” — Brittany Burgunder\n\n32. “No such thing as spare time, no such thing as free time, no such thing as downtime. All you got is a lifetime. Go.” — Henry Rollins\n\n33. “I always live in the present. The future I can’t know. The past I no longer have.” — Fernando Pessoa\n\n34. “With technology and over-scheduling, we are forgetting to invest time in simple connective moments with others.” — Michelle Gielan\n\n35. “For disappearing acts, it’s hard to beat what happens to the eight hours supposedly left after eight of sleep and eight of work.” — Doug Larson\n\n36. “They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.” — Andy Warhol\n\n37. “At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, or a parent.” — Barbara Bush\n\n38. “Don’t live the same year 75 times and call it a life.” — Robin S. Sharma\n\n39. “Time sometimes flies like a bird, sometimes crawls like a snail; but a man is happiest when he does not even notice whether it passes swiftly or slowly.” — Ivan Turgenev\n\n40. “Half our time is spent trying to find something to do with the time we have rushed through life trying to save.” — Will Rogers\n\n41. “Stop and take your time to notice things and make those things you notice matter.” — Cecelia Ahern\n\n42. “People hurry so they can get to places faster, where they’d rather not be, so they can have more time to do things they’d rather not be doing.” — Peter Turla\n\n43. “Free time is a terrible thing to waste. Read a book.” — E.A. Bucchianeri\n\n44. “You can have it all. Just not all at once.” — Oprah Winfrey\n\n45. “Free time was the most precious time when you should be doing what you loved, or at least slowing down enough to remember what made your life worthwhile and happy.” — Amy Tan\n\n46. “There’s only one thing more precious than our time and that’s who we spend it on.” — Leo Christopher\n\n47. “Too often man handles life as he does the bad weather. He whiles away the time as he waits for it to stop.” — Alfred Polgar\n\nTime management quotes\n\nTime management is an invaluable skill every adult strives to perfect. We want to be better at using the time we are given, but it’s a lifelong learning process.\n\nWith a little motivational boost and learning from our mistakes, we can quickly solve our poor time management problems. So long as we don’t waste time waiting to start or fretting over the process.\n\nHere are some time management quotes to motivate you.\n\n48. “Time management is an oxymoron. Time is beyond our control, and the clock keeps ticking regardless of how we lead our lives. Priority management is the answer to maximizing the time we have.” — John C. Maxwell\n\n49. “You’ve got to know what you want. This is central to acting on your intentions. When you know what you want, you realize that all there is left then is time management. You’ll manage your time to achieve your goals because you clearly know what you’re trying to achieve in your life.” — Patch Adams\n\n50. “Don’t make the same decision twice.
