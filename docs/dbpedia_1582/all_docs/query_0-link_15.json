        "text": "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) Album nimrod. Released December 23, 1999 Track Number 17 Recorded May 1999 – July 1999 Length 2:34 Writer Billie Joe Armstrong, Green Day\n\n\"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\", also called \"Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)\" or more commonly \"Time of Your Life\", is a popular song by the American Alternative-punk band Green Day. Although written by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong just after the release of their 1994 hit album Dookie, the song was not released until their third major-label album Nimrod in 1999 although an alternate version did appear as a B-side to the 1996 German import single for \"Brain Stew/Jaded\".[1]\n\nWriting and composition[]\n\nIn comparison to previous Green Day material, \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" features more mellow, contemplative lyrics with acoustic music. Band member Mike Dirnt went on to state that the release of this song was probably the \"most punk\" thing they could have done.[2] The song is more commonly promoted on the radio as \"Time of Your Life\", and it became a Billboard Rock chart-topper and an international hit, and was the only song from Nimrod that was a crossover success when released in single form.[3]\n\nThe song began life as an entirely different version as a B-side to the Insomniac album. This alternate version featured strummed chords instead of the usual sound and lacked the orchestra strings found on the more well known version. This early version can be found on the \"Brain Stew\" single.\n\nBillie Joe Armstrong in an interview in Guitar Legends magazine, May 2005:\n\n\"At the time I wrote Good Riddance, I was breaking up with a girl that was moving to Ecuador, and I was trying to be as understanding about it as I could. I wrote the song as kind of a bon voyage. I was trying not to be bitter, but I think it came out a little bit bitter anyway... I thought that calling the song \"Time of Your Life\" was just a little too level-headed for me, so I had to come up with something different\".\n\nOn the album version, at the beginning, Billie Joe Armstrong makes a mistake (the 3rd and 4th strings of the open G/D chord are played instead of the 2nd and 3rd), tries again, repeats the mistake, and in anger swears in a barely audible voice. This \"mistake\" was recorded on purpose and included in the song to provide comic relief, as it is considered one of their more serious songs.\n\nAppeal[]\n\nBecause of the song's retrospective tone, despite it being a break-up song, it is frequently played at ceremonial social occasions such as weddings, anniversaries, graduations, etc. It is a continual favorite to be played as the last song at a high school promTemplate:Fact. The song reached a massive audience in one night, when it was used during the special two part \"Clip Show\" of the extremely popular show Seinfeld in 2000. The song played during a montage of clips from the show's history.\n\nBillie Joe plays an electric acoustic version of the song as their traditional show-closer for live Green Day concerts, including their live performance on Bullet in a Bible.\n\nThe song features on their greatest hits compilation International Superhits!.\n\nMusic video[]\n\nThe music video was directed by Mark Kohr, and features Billie Joe Armstrong playing an acoustic guitar in a bedroom interjected with scenes depicting various people undergoing every-day-things. Band members Mike Dirnt and Tré Cool make cameo appearances in the video as a person getting gas (Dirnt), and an injured bike rider (Cool). Also when the video came out, both names of the songs were swapped and were known as \"Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)\", this name was also used on the single cover.\n\nIn 1998 Green Day won their first MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video for \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" and they were also nominated for Viewer's Choice.[4]\n\nThe video can be found on their music video compilation DVD, International Supervideos!.\n\nTracklist[]\n\nCD 1\n\n1. \"Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)\" 2:28\n\n2. \"Suffocate\" 2:47\n\n3. \"You Lied\" 2:25\n\n7:40\n\nCD 2\n\n1. \"Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)\" 2:28\n\n2. \"Desensitized\" 2:47\n\n3. \"Rotting\" 2:50\n\n8:05\n\nEU CD\n\n1. \"Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)\" (Clean Album Remix) 2:28\n\n2. \"Desensitized\" (Non-LP Track) 2:47\n\n3. \"Rotting\" (Non-LP Track) 2:50\n\n8:05\n\nCharts[]\n\nTemplate:Unreferenced section\n\nChart (2000) Peak\n\nposition UK Singles Chart 11 Australia Singles Chart 2 Irish Singles Chart 30 New Zealand Singles Chart 40 Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks 7 Billboard Modern Rock Tracks 2\n\nIn popular culture[]\n\nTemplate:Trivia\n\nAt the end of the 2007-2008 Barclays English Premiership Season, Skysports used it as a soundtrack to preview the whole season.\n\nIn episode 18 of the fourth season of ER (Gut Reaction) ER, PA Jeanie Boulet - played by actress Gloria Reuben, sang this song as a farewell to a young boy (Scott Anspaugh, son of Dr. Anspaugh) who had died in her care.\n\nThe song was featured in the retirement ceremony held for hockey player Wendel Clark before the season opener between the hockey clubs the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens at the Air Canada Centre.
