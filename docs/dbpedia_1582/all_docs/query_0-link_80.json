        "text": "English Letters\n\nSpanish Letters\n\nLetter #1\n\nCopied\n\nIt's so hard to believe that in just six days we will have been together for a year now! Time really does fly when you are having the time of your life, doesn't it? At times I wish we could go back and relive the whole relationship, don't you? Although we both made our share of mistakes, I wouldn't change one thing; not a single breath spent with you would be different.\n\nYou are the greatest gift the world has ever presented to me. I have to admit that a year ago I didn't believe in God, or even any higher power for that matter, but now that I have you, you are my angel God has sent down to watch over me. You are my heart and my soul. You are everything to me. I love you with every ounce of my heart and soul, and so much more. Words cannot explain how much you mean to me, and I am truly blessed to have you in my life.\n\nThis year has turned out to be so amazing. I want to thank you for making my life worthwhile. You are my heart, my soul, my everything. I never want to be without you. I love you so much!\n\nLetter #2\n\nCopied\n\nYou make me feel so special, like I'm your one and only love. You make me feel like I'm a star in the sky lighting up your life. I feel safe when I'm near you and wrapped up in your arms. You make me feel like an angel from heaven because you never stop telling me how much you love me. You're always warming my heart with the things you do and say. I feel so happy just being with you this way. You're my baby and will forever be my baby. You will always be the love of my life.\n\nLetter #3\n\nCopied\n\nThe love that we share has grown so strong that it has become unbreakable now. We've been through a lot of ups and downs that sometimes brought us to the edge of saying goodbye. But, together, you and I found our way back to each other. We just couldn't stand being apart anymore.\n\nI love you more than words can say. I love you with everything I have to give. As the poet wrote: \"Across the years, I will walk with you in deep green forests, on shores of sand; and when our time on earth is through, in Heaven, too, you will have my hand.\" I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you! I Thank God every day that He sent you to me and that He gave us this amazing love that is untouchable! My baby, my love, my friend, you are my life, and we belong to each other.\n\nSo long as I can breathe or I can see, as long as you live, because that's what gives life to me now. I promise my love to you now and for the rest of my life. I love you with all my heart and all my soul. I'm here forever, by your side, for always. You mean the world to me, and I would do anything for you. You've taken my whole heart into your hands, and what I feel for you can never be replaced. Only you have my love. We're going to have the most amazing future ahead of us and, remember, our day is coming, sooner than we think! My love, I'm here to take care of you and to be together with you for eternity! I love you always!\n\nLetter #4\n\nCopied\n\nYou are my dream come true, my soul mate, my angel sent from above. I never thought it was possible to love someone the way I love you, but that was before I met you. We met differently than other couples--we met online. I didn't get to hold you, feel you, caress your silky skin, touch your lips, but I carried you with me all day long in my heart. My love for you grows more and more with every day that goes by. You know that I love you more than anything; that's why I don't understand why you ask me if I love you, or how do I love you? You don't need to have doubts because my love for you is real and always will be. If I stay quiet and don't say anything when you ask me that, it's not because I don't want to answer or don't know what to say, it's because there isn't anything that can describe my love for you. There isn't anything as amazing as you are, Honey. I will love you today, tomorrow, and FOREVER!\n\nLetter #5\n\nCopied\n\nIf the sun were to rise tomorrow as it usually does, but this time without me in this world, I would want you to know how much I love, admire, and respect you.\n\nYou're a terrific man, a man who has stood by my side through everything, and has loved me, supported me, and given my heart strength and shelter. In the short time that I've known you, not a day has gone by in which I wasn't overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude and affection.\n\nYou've lent me your ear when I've needed to vent, and you've given me advice when I've felt lost. You've offered unwavering support when I've been scared. You've even challenged me when I've needed it most. When I've been tired, you've helped me along. You've cried with me when I've been hurt, and cried for me when I've been sick.\n\nYou are truly more than the love of my life. You are the most precious friend I could have asked for, too. I love you so very much, and I hope to be with you always--through every sunrise and every sunset, until our lives are over.\n\nLetter #6\n\nCopied\n\nI always thought love was only in movies and songs till I met you, my love. To my surprise, what you make me feel every day is the same inspiration that inspired all those beautiful songs, warm poems, and amazing movies. You became my reason for existing, my dreams, and my future just by being yourself, and I thank you, I thank you with all my heart for being the most important part of my life, for being my wife, for with you my soul is everlasting and my love is eternal. I'm yours forever, not just for this lifetime but for whatever else follows. I love you.\n\nLetter #7\n\nCopied\n\nI think about you all the time. We are so close now. It's not like I feel that we have drifted apart. It's just that I want to let you know again how much I am in love with you. I will love you forever and for always, Baby. You are the one every girl dreams about, but the best part is that you are all mine. I don't know what I did to deserve you, but I must have done something right! Being with you makes me feel like the entire world is mine. One day we will marry and have a houseful of kids. I am dreaming about that already. I love you, Baby, and I am yours forever!\n\nLetter #8\n\nCopied\n\n\"Forever\" and \"always\" are two words that people use loosely. I say them from the depths of my heart and from all the strength within me, \"I will love you, forever and always.\" My heart leaps for joy when I see you. My mind slips away to moments we shared. You give my life meaning. Every step we take, we take together, and I know that tomorrow each step will grow even sweeter. Our lives have become so entwined that I can feel your every breath as my heart beats. I know even from a distance when you are sad or feeling down, and my heart aches for you. I know when you are happy, and it makes me smile. I wish your every dream will come true. Your happiness is my only wish.\n\nLetter #9\n\nCopied\n\nNever in my wildest dreams did I think I would meet a woman that could captivate and win my heart just with a \"Hello.\" From the moment I wake up till deep in the night, there is no place on earth I would rather be than holding and kissing you tenderly.\n\nYou are a special woman with unique and intriguing qualities that drive my desire for you far beyond anyone's imagination. Never in my life until the day I met you have I wanted to bring a child into this world, share everything life has to offer, give all my love unconditionally, and grow old with someone till we reached the day we can reminisce of all the years we shared together. Just the thought of offering my total heart to you and spending my life cherishing every moment with you, brings these incredible emotions to me that I have never experienced before.\n\nThe worst day of my life was letting you slip away three years ago because the timing just was not right for either one of us, but second chances do not come too often in life. I will not go another day without giving us a true chance at a life with love and happiness. I know we can kiss and hold one another again.\n\nA wise man once told me, \"When it is real, you will know it.\" I know now."
