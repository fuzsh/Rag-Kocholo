        "text": "An episodic memory is a memory of a specific event. Because each person has a different perspective and experience of an event, episodic memories of that event are unique to each person.\n\nClosely related to this is what researchers refer to as autobiographical memoryâ€”memories of your own life history. As you can imagine, episodic and autobiographical memories play an important role in your self-identity.\n\nHow Episodic Memory Works\n\nImagine that you get a phone call from an old college friend. You spend an evening reminiscing about amusing moments from your days at school. Your memories of those specific events and experiences are examples of episodic memory.\n\nEpisodic memories are important for shaping your personal sense of identity. These memories provide you with a sense of personal history and a shared history with others in your life.\n\nAreas of the Brain Involved in Episodic Memory\n\nSeveral regions of the brain have been implicated in episodic memory. These regions of the brain are part of what is known as the default mode network. These areas include:\n\nPosterior cingulate cortex\n\nAngular gyrus\n\nMiddle temporal gyrus\n\nMiddle frontal gyrus\n\nMedial prefrontal cortex\n\nThe hippocampus and parts of the brain found in the temporal lobe are also important in encoding, consolidating, and retrieving episodic memories.\n\nSeveral parts of the brain work in concert to help you store and retrieve episodic memories: the temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices, diencephalon, and cerebellum. Practice, genetics, and experience all influence your ability to recall episodic memories.\n\nEpisodic vs. Semantic Memory\n\nThe term episodic memory was first introduced by Endel Tulving in 1972 to distinguish between remembering events from the past (episodic memory) and knowing factual information, known as semantic memory.\n\nSemantic and Episodic Memory Are Interdependent\n\nResearchers have found that episodic memory can also be interdependent with semantic memory.\n\nParticipants were asked to remember the prices of grocery items. Those in the control group were better able to remember these prices when the new information was congruent with their existing episodic memories of grocery prices.\n\nAmnesiac participants in the experimental group, however, performed much worse at remembering new information because they did not have access to episodic information from their past.\n\nIn experiments where participants were asked to generate lists of items in particular categories, those who were able to rely on episodic memories performed better than amnesiac participants who did not have access to episodic memories.\n\nTypes of Episodic Memories\n\nEpisodic memories fall into a few main categories.\n\nSpecific Events\n\nThese involve memories of particular moments from personal history. Your first kiss, first day of school, a friend's birthday party, and your brother's graduation are all examples of episodic memories. In addition to your overall recall of the event itself, the episodic memory include the locations and times of the events.\n\nPersonal Facts\n\nKnowing who was president the year that you got married, the make and model of your first car, and the name of your first boss are all examples of personal fact episodic memories.\n\nGeneral Events\n\nRemembering what a kiss feels like is an example of this general type of memory. You do not remember each and every kiss you've ever shared, but you can recall what it feels like based on your personal experiences.\n\nFlashbulb Memories\n\nFlashbulb memories are vivid and detailed \"snapshots\" related to finding out particularly important news. Sometimes these moments might be highly personal, like the moment you found out that your grandmother had died.\n\nExamples of Episodic Memories\n\nSome examples of episodic memories might include:\n\nWhat happened on your recent trip to Disneyland\n\nWhere you were when you learned that a loved one had died\n\nYour old cell phone number\n\nYour first day at your job\n\nYour first date with your partner\n\nRemember, each person's episodic memory of an event is entirely unique. Even other people who shared the same experience may have different recollections of what happened.\n\nYour memory of a particular the year you attended your first concert or of what you had for breakfast yesterday morning are also examples of episodic memory.\n\nNine Properties of Episodic Memory\n\nResearch indicates that episodic memory carries nine attributes. Other types of memory feature some of these, tooâ€”but only episodic memories comprise all of them. Episodic memories:\n\nContain summary records of sensory-perceptual-conceptual-affective processing\n\nRetain patterns of activation/inhibition over long periods\n\nAre often represented in the form of (visual) images\n\nAlways have a perspective (field or observer)\n\nRepresent short time slices of experience\n\nAre represented on a temporal dimension roughly in order of occurrence\n\nAre subject to rapid forgetting\n\nMake autobiographical remembering specific\n\nAre recollectively experienced when accessed\n\nResearch has found, for example, that women tend to outperform men on tests of episodic memory function, particularly on verbal-based episodic memory. Studies also show that women can access these memories faster and date them more accurately than men.\n\nImpact of Episodic Memory\n\nEpisodic memory has a profound effect on your life. Tulving described it as a \"mental time machine.\"\n\nSuch memories help create a cohesive experience. They allow you to form a personal history that plays a role in your identity and sense of self.\n\nHow Damage and Disease Can Affect Episodic Memory\n\nAging and neurodegenerative diseases take an extreme toll on episodic memory. For example, a decline in the ability to retrieve this kind of memory is among the first signs of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.\n\nOther psychiatric conditions that can cause deficits in episodic memory:\n\nDissociative disorders\n\nSchizophrenia\n\nParkinson's disease\n\nHowever, such damage is difficult to assess because memories are difficult to induce and measure."
