        "text": "Emailing a faculty member can be intimidating, especially if you don’t know them very well. Getting an email started can be the hardest part of reaching out. Thankfully, there are a few guiding rules that can help you start off on the right foot!\n\nProper salutation\n\nAlways start out your email with a polite “Dear” or “Hello” followed by your professor’s name/title (Dr. XYZ, Professor XYZ, etc.). If you’re not sure what their proper title is, using “Professor” followed by their last name is almost always a safe bet.\n\nTip: If you want to know their proper title, check the class syllabus!\n\nIntroduce yourself\n\nEven if your professor knows who you are, it can never hurt to give a brief introduction. Simply giving your preferred name, year, major, and the course you’re enrolled in can provide a great deal of context.\n\nUse correct grammar and spelling\n\nAn email is more formal than a text or message on social media, so be sure this is reflected in your writing (no abbreviations/acronyms). Be sure not only to use spelling/grammar check, but also proofread the email. You can even ask a friend or roommate to give it one final read-through.\n\nUse a formal closing\n\nConclude your email with a closing, such as “Best regards”, “Sincerely”, or “Thank you” followed by your name.\n\nTip: Set up a signature on your Purdue email account that include your full name, major, and intended graduation year.

I am writing because in class yesterday you mentioned having some open positions in your research lab. I found the summary of your project very interesting, and I would like to learn more and possibly talk to you about joining the lab. Is there a time in the coming weeks that we could meet?\n\nThank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest regards,"
