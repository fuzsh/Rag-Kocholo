        "text": "When I originally wrote this post in 2010, I was sitting on a ferry from Koh Phi Phi, Thailand to Railay Beach. I was floating on the Andaman Sea late morning on a Wedensday.\n\nThe same Wednesday that used to be spent in an office, dreaming of the day where I could go off gallivanting around the world for an indefinite period of time.\n\nHere at Location Rebel I play up my ability to do this quite a bit.\n\nWe shoot videos from all over the world, and post those fun laptop photos. Like this one recent one from Cabo:\n\nOr getting to shoot a video like this while road-tripping through Australia with my wife and daughter:\n\nNot because I’m trying to brag, but because this is my life. This is my reality. When I started the site, I was very honest about my cluelessness about life and where I was going.\n\nI continue that same honesty and openness now as well.\n\nSo for those of you who have called me out for bragging or don’t believe everything I write here, very politely: go somewhere else if you don’t like what I have to say.\n\nNow that I’ve got that out of the way, I’ve come to realize there are ten very important life-altering moments that I’ve experienced in the last few years which have made my dream into a reality.\n\nTen very specific moments, which I remember vividly that have helped shape who I am.\n\nWhat is a Defining Moment?\n\nA defining moment in your life is an occasion where your life’s path has undeniably changed.\n\nIt could be something that changes within yourself. Maybe you experience an injury or illness that changes your perspective in life.\n\nIt could be an external factor like a career or relationship change.\n\nBut a defining moment is one of those times that you know you’ll look back on and say “If it weren’t for that, things would be different.”\n\nAs you go on your own path, you undoubtedly will have similar defining moments. In fact, I’m sure you already have. Sometimes it just takes a while to realize how important these moments are.\n\nDefining Moment Examples\n\nBefore I jump into my defining moments, I think it’s important to look at what a defining moment is and what different kinds of them are out there.\n\nThe dictionary definition of a defining moment is an event that influences or changes all subsequent related occurrences.\n\nTo put it more simply a defining moment is a fork in the road. It’s one of those times where depending on the moment, and how you react to it your life could go one direction or another.\n\nHere are some common defining moment examples:\n\nGetting married or divorced\n\nStarting a new job or leaving an old one\n\nBeginning a new business partnership\n\nTaking a big trip\n\nPaying off debt\n\nFinishing school\n\nRetiring\n\nLosing a Loved One\n\nHaving a baby\n\nThe list goes on, but these are some of the most common examples you’d expect.\n\nNow, with those in mind, I want to share with you 12 of my most important “defining moments” in life.\n\nThese are the things that have put me on the path that I’m on, and frankly, it was some of these decisions that have shaped not only my life, but Location Rebel and this business as well.\n\nMy 12 Defining Moments in Life\n\n#1: Backpacked through Europe – Without the Backpack\n\nThis was my first global adventure. It was a two-month backpacking trip that was not only cut down to 3 weeks due to employment reasons, but it also had to be experienced with next to nothing.\n\nThe fine folks over at Air Canada had lost my bag when I arrived in Rome. It subsequently returned to my home in the U.S. two days before I did.\n\nFor as angry as I was about this, it had a very profound impact on who I am and how I travel. This was the trip where I realized that I need very little to get by.\n\nAlong with that, I learned that all of these mishaps are all part of the adventure. Whether you’re at home or traveling, shit happens. When you can go with the flow, you’ll be far better off.\n\nThink about this as you go on your entrepreneurial journey. I promise you, things will go wrong. There will be times that totally suck. You will make it through, and chances are, you’ll have a hell of a story at the end of the day as well. And if you know anything about me, you know that’s what I’m all about – having good stories.\n\nRelated: How Backingpacking Through Europe (Without a Backpack) Changed My Life\n\n#2: Began the Location Rebel Blog\n\nOriginally this point was “made my first dollar online” but I realized if it weren’t for starting this blog, I never would have made that money.\n\nI began Location Rebel to hold myself accountable for doing the things I wanted to do in my life. To be honest, I didn’t expect the site to live past the first month.\n\nI’m awesome at starting things. You want to get a project off the ground? Get me involved. I’m full of ideas and enthusiasm, and I always stay positive. That said, when it comes to seeing long-term projects through, I struggle a bit.\n\nThat’s why it’s so remarkable that we’re still going strong in 2024! This post was originally written in 2011…\n\nTo see that this was originally the 245th post on the site, I can’t help but think about the lessons this blog has taught me. Not the least of which is persistence. By staying persistent and continuing to blog, I’ve shown myself that I can indeed see things through to the end, and I’ve seen firsthand just how valuable that persistence can be.\n\nAll of that said, it was that first $22 commission off an ebook called Source Control that I realized the potential of the internet. To see that commission come in opened up a whole world of possibility that I knew nothing about – but I was damn sure going to learn about it.\n\nYour takeaway? Persistence pays off. If you’re working hard and aren’t seeing the benefits you want – keep working. It’s all a matter of having the right combination of things come together. For some people this happens right away, for others it takes longer, but in the end, it will work out.\n\nRelated: The Very First Blog Post I Ever Published at Location Rebel\n\n#3: Quit My Job\n\nI still remember this day like it was yesterday. It was quite possibly the most terrifying yet exciting day of my life. It was the first day in my life where I didn’t know what was going to happen next.\n\nI went from being terrified of the uncertainty to embracing it, and eventually turning it into an asset.\n\nI may be one of the few people who actually benefitted from the tanking economy in 2009-2013. Had we seen a bull run in 2008 and 2009, I’d be willing to bet that I’d be preparing to put my suit on here in a few hours.\n\nEntrepreneurs see opportunity in a poor economy – many men and women have made their fortunes in such times.\n\nI’ve made mine.\n\nWhile it may not be a monetary fortune, it’s one much more important than that – I’ve built a fortune in time and opportunity. I wish I could say that’s how I’d planned it from the beginning.\n\nInstead, I just look back and say, “wow that worked out better than I expected!”\n\nAnything worth doing will terrify you. There will be uncertainty. However, taking the leap can (and probably will) be the best choice you’ve ever made – assuming it’s what you want.\n\nRelated:\n\nMy Last Day\n\nHow to Quit Your Job (Without Burning Bridges)\n\n#4: Moved to Thailand\n\nThis was the first time in my life where I first consciously thought about the idea of a “defining moment.”\n\nIn fact, I remember the exact date and time.\n\nJanuary 5th, 2010.\n\nI was sitting at the Portland airport, about to board a flight to Thailand – where I’d live for the next 7 months.\n\nI even wrote a post about it: “Embrace Life’s Defining Moments.”\n\nNever in my life had I lived more than an hour from my family.\n\nI’d never even been to Asia.\n\nThis was the biggest, scariest thing I’d ever done in my life up to that point. And honestly? It may still be the scariest thing I’ve ever done.\n\n#5: Ran a Marathon\n\nIt wasn’t until the last 200 meters of my marathon that I:\n\nActually believed I would finish\n\nRealized what a profound impact it would have on me moving forward.\n\nRunning a marathon was without a doubt the hardest thing I’ve ever physically done. I’m not a runner, and will never claim to be. This was the one thing on my bucket list that I actually thought may never happen (ok, Virgin Galactic may be a bit of a long shot as well).\n\nSo when I entered Hayward Field for the last 200 meters of the Eugene Marathon I was overcome with emotion. I wasn’t sure if I was fighting back tears or if it was the the previous 26 miles catching up with me, but I hit an emotional point I’d never experienced. To know that I was seconds away from actually accomplishing something that I never thought possible was eye-opening.\n\nAll of a sudden, my reality shifted. If I could do this, what else could I do? What couldn’t I do?\n\nMaybe it’s a false sense of self-assuredness, but I really do believe I can do pretty much whatever I want. If it weren’t for the marathon I don’t think I’d have anywhere near the confidence I have now.\n\nConfidence is everything. If you’re confident in what you do, other people will gravitate towards you and share in your confidence – whatever it may be directed towards.\n\nGo accomplish your impossible. Afterwards? You’ll never look at life the same again.\n\nRelated: How to Run a Marathon with (Almost) No Training\n\n#6: Released Location Rebel Academy\n\nLocation Rebel Academy is the culmination of the last 13+ years of my life. It incorporates everything I’ve talked about in this post. Overcoming fears, building a blog, starting a business, and living life on your own terms.\n\nI was able to take all of the skills that I learned along the way, and share them with others in hope you can do a similar thing in your own life.\n\nThe best part? That’s exactly what happened. Thousands of members and success stories later, I truly feel like the Academy has made an impact.\n\nI knew it was a good program. But it wasn’t until releasing it and seeing the success that everyone is having that I realized I was on to something.\n\nThis program has given me more confidence to continue putting out content, and go further down the rabbit hole to see what’s really possible.\n\nIf you haven’t checked it out yet, I really hope you will. Whether you join our community or just just grab the free 6 day course, I promise you will get value out of it. I know I and many others have.\n\nThose six defining moments above I first wrote in 2011 when this was first published. They’re still major milestones in my life.\n\nBut since then there have more that have had equally as large of an impact as those.\n\nRelated: Location Rebel Academy\n\n#7: Got Engaged and Bought a House\n\nI lump these two together, because they happened on the same day.\n\nOn my 29th birthday, April 4th, 2014, I bought my first house and got engaged. I was terrified of what that would mean for my brand and business. After all, I was the location rebel! The guy that travels and works from anywhere.\n\nSo to be settling down with both a house and a wife? I wasn’t sure how people would react…how I would react.\n\nWhat I realized though is that building a lifestyle business is not about being able to work from anywhere. Rather it’s about being able to do the things you want to do. For some that might be travel (I still travel 3-4 months out of the year), for others it may not look that different than their current life with a day job.\n\nBut the fact I was able to do these things and still grow this brand and business was huge.\n\nRelated: A House, an Engagement, and a Huge Kick in the Ass\n\n#8: Got Married\n\nIt’s one thing to get engaged, it’s another to get married.\n\nThe extra level of commitment and support, is huge. The intertwining of finances, the discussions about kids and futures.\n\nIt’s no longer just you.\n\nAnd in my case having someone else to both share in the defining moments and the day-to-day moments has not only helped me to become more successful, but to be more fulfilled as well.\n\nRelated: Sudden Loss, New Beginnings, and Three Simple Words\n\n#9: Started The Eighty Club\n\nAt the beginning of 2017 I finally decided to try and monetize my golf site Breaking Eighty. I did this through creating a community called The Eighty Club, which I created for members of private golf clubs around the world.\n\nPreviously, while I’d had success here with Location Rebel Academy, and a bit of niche site success with HDR Software, I wasn’t entirely sure I’d be able to build another business in another industry.\n\nSeeing how well this has grown (we’re up to over 250 members), and the people it has brought together has fundamentally altered much of how I travel and how I approach my businesses these days.\n\nRelated: Rogue Financial Analyst Makes $34,000 a Year from Golf Business\n\n#10: Began My Golf and My Bar Quest\n\nI have a couple (admittedly ridiculous) quests in life: to visit the top 100 golf courses in the world, as well as the top 100 bars.\n\nFor most people, these might seem at best a little odd, and at worse downright shallow.\n\nLet’s face it elite golf courses and expensive cocktails aren’t exactly making the world a better place.\n\nHowever for me, these two things have taken me to places I’d never expect to go, introduced me to wonderful people, and helped me to add purpose and direction to my travels and websites.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve played 58/100 of the Top 100 Golf Courses in America, 54/100 Top 100 Golf Courses in the World, and at its peak, I hit 59 of the top 100 bars in the world (based off the 2017 list).\n\nSince adopting these I’ve changed how I travel, where I travel, who I travel with, and it’s made the journey that much more exciting and rewarding in the process.\n\n#11: Shot the Desk\n\nOf everything I’ve done at Location Rebel, the most interesting and the most defining may have been the video we shot called “The Desk”.\n\nWhen we shot it, I had no idea how iconic it would become, or frankly, how much of our branding would be built around this concept.\n\nThe video proved to me that it’s worth it to do things a bit differently, and it also ended up being a once-in-a-lifetime journey I got to take with my Dad and good friend, Jamie.\n\n#12: Had a Baby\n\nI tried really hard to keep this list to 10, but honestly? I’ve had 12 major defining moments in life, and this most recent one?\n\nIt’s by far the biggest.\n\nOur daughter was born on January 5th, 2021. I had no idea what I was in for, how much my life would change, or how much love I was capable of giving. It’s been one of the ultimate defining moments in my life.\n\nMore than anything else, Elliot has changed my routines, my habits, and my thoughts.\n\nI can’t wait to see the woman she becomes, and I’m more thankful than ever for these previous 11 moments. Because it was this path that has allowed me to spend so much time with her during the early years of her life.\n\nRelated: Turning 36 and Some Advice for New Parents\n\nWhat is Your Most Defining Moment?\n\nThese are the moments that have shaped my life more than any others. If it weren’t for these things I have no idea where I’d be.\n\nSo what are your life-defining moments? What’s led you to where you are? Or if you don’t feel that you’ve had a defining moment yet, what will it be? What do you need to do to make that happen?\n\nThank you for following along with me on my journey, as I continue to explore just how much is possible in life.\n\nWant help building a lifestyle business that will help you do the exact same thing I’ve been able to do over the past 11+ years?
