        "text": "Seneca once wrote:\n\nIt is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it… Life is long if you know how to use it.\n\nThis is a profound statement and I would encourage you to read it again. The more I read it, the more I am inspired by it.\n\nThese phrases stick out the most to me:\n\n“It is not that we have a short time to live… but that we waste a lot of it…”\n\n“Life is long enough for the highest achievements if it were all well invested…”\n\n“It is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity…”\n\n“We are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it…”\n\nI should, perhaps, end this article right now—with Seneca’s own words—rather than thinking I can improve upon them.\n\nBut maybe, for just a few short sentences, I will comment.\n\nYou (the person reading these words right now) were designed to achieve great things! You are unique in your being, your substance, your abilities, and your relationships. And there is no one else on the face of the earth who can live your life and accomplish your good.\n\nPlease, do not forget that.\n\nThere is no doubt that “success” and “achievement” are relative words and your highest achievement is different from someone else’s highest achievement. You may never lead thousands or cure cancer. But make no mistake:\n\nThere is a good that you are designed to bring into this world. And there are people in your life that you can serve and love better than anyone else.\n\nYour highest achievement will be different than mine, but we both have one. And “life is long enough for us to achieve it.”\n\nUnless, as Seneca wrote, “Our lives are wasted in needless luxury and spent on no good activity.”\n\nIt is up to us to decide, every day, to focus our energies on those things worthy of the one life we have been given.\n\nDiscard the inessential. Remove the distractions. Reject worthless activity.\n\nYour life is too short… to waste accumulating material possessions.\n\nYour life is too short… to be offended all the time.\n\nYour life is too short… to chase accolades.\n\nYour life is too short… to compare it to others.\n\nYour life is too short… to waste watching 6 hours of television/day.\n\nYour life is too short… to pursue riches.\n\nYour life is too short… to not believe in yourself.\n\nYour life is too short… to not forgive.\n\nYour life is too short… to not speak your mind.\n\nYour life is too short… to worry about the future.\n\nYour life is too short… to regret the past.\n\nYour life is too short… to live in fear.\n\nYour life is too short… to be unhappy.\n\nYour life is too short… to waste time on the trivial.\n\n—\n\nYour life is too short… to live like everyone else.\n\nYour life is too short… to not be true to yourself.\n\nAnd life is too short to wait."
