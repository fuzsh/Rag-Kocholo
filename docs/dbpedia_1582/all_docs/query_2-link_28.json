During this transition of updating expiration dates, no insurance producer license was shortened and insurance producers can view updated expiration dates and reprint their licenses at https://www.statebasedsystems.com/solar/index.html\n\nWhat types of licenses are issued?\n\nInsurance Licensing issues producer licenses for the following lines:\n\nLife\n\nLife, variable contract\n\nAccident and health\n\nGeneral casualty\n\nProperty\n\nPersonal lines\n\nTitle\n\nRestricted to credit (No exam required)\n\nRestricted to travel (No exam required)\n\nCrop\n\nBusiness entity producers must be licensed separately from its producers. A business entity producer can only solicit, negotiate or produce insurance contracts through licensed producers.\n\nPlease contact the Licensing Section for information on the following licenses:\n\nBail bond agent\n\nGeneral bail bond agent\n\nSurety recovery agent\n\nSurplus lines\n\nPublic adjuster\n\nPublic adjuster solicitor\n\nCan I still get a license if I have a criminal conviction?\n\nYou are not automatically disqualified from obtaining a license if you have a criminal record.\n\nOn the application for a license, there are specific instructions about the information to provide about your criminal record on the conviction.\n\nA signed statement describing the circumstances surrounding your arrest, the charges and the conviction.\n\nProvide a certified copy of the Indictment or Information and the Judgment and Sentencing documents that show the disposition of each criminal charge.\n\nSubmit complete information with your application.\n\nHow do I apply to take an examination?\n\nContact Pearson VUE for the Licensing Information Bulletin, which contains step-by-step instructions and the examination and license applications.\n\nPearson VUE\n\nMissouri Insurance\n\nPO Box 8588\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19101-8588\n\n866-274-4740\n\nwww.pearsonvue.com\n\nPearson VUE will notify Insurance of your exam results, but you must apply for your license to Insurance within one year of passing the exam. The exam scores are only valid for one year.\n\nAs a veteran, can I be reimbursed for the cost of a licensing exam required by the department?\n\nYes. Veterans taking a state licensing examination required by the department can be reimbursed for the cost of the exam. Click here to learn more and see which licensing exams are eligible for reimbursement.\n\nI have a license in another state. Do I still have to take an examination?\n\nNo. If you hold a resident agent, broker or producer license in another state, you are not required to take an examination for those lines in which you are licensed, with the exception of Title agents. This exemption applies to residents of those states that award licenses to Missouri residents on the same basis.\n\nIf you have just moved to Missouri, you will not have to take an exam if you hold a current agent, broker or producer license in another state, or have held a current agent, broker or producer license in another state within the past 90 days, and apply within 90 days of relocating to Missouri.\n\nHow do I apply for a producer/business entity producer license or add lines to my current producer license?\n\nFee may be paid by check or money order, made payable to Department of Commerce & Insurance.\n\nHow does an insurance company notify the department of my appointment or termination as an agent?\n\nInsurance companies do not have to notify the department of appointments. Companies are required to maintain an internally updated register of appointed and terminated producers. No fees will be assessed for appointments or terminations. The appointment must be recorded in the company register within thirty days of an insurer authorizing a producer to transact business on its behalf.\n\nSome terminations must be reported to the department. Terminations must be reported in two instances: 1) when the termination is \"for cause\" or 2) when the termination is the termination of a title agent or agency. Title insurers are required to report all agency terminations, and the reasons for those terminations, to the director within seven calendar days. When the terminated agent and the insurance company are not in the business of title insurance but the termination is \"for cause,\" the department must be notified within 30 days of the termination.\n\nHow do I renew my license?\n\nThe department will send a renewal notice to you 60 to 90 days before your producer or business entity producer license expires. Your renewal is due on or before the expiration of your license. Licenses will terminate if completed renewal documents are not received by the expiration date.\n\nA maximum late renewal period from date of license expiration has been established at twelve months. A $25 per month penalty fee will be assessed. After twelve months, a license may not be renewed and the previous licensee must apply for a new license.\n\nThe renewal fee is $100 for your producer or business entity producer license. Fee may be paid by check or money order, made payable to Department of Commerce & Insurance. Click to renew your license.\n\nWhen will the department terminate my license?\n\nYour producer and business entity producer license will be terminated if your license is not renewed on or before your expiration date.\n\nHow can I get my license reinstated after I was terminated?\n\nYou must fill out a new producer license application and fulfill all the examination requirements. There is a $100 fee for a producer license.\n\nIf your license has terminated due to nonrenewal within the past 12 months, you may late renew your license. See \"How do I renew my license?\"\n\nIf your business entity producer license is terminated, you must request reinstatement by filing a new application and $100 fee. Fee may be paid by check or money order, made payable to Department of Commerce & Insurance\n\nMy license got destroyed or lost. How do I print a new one?\n\nClick this link to print your license.\n\nMy name or address changed. What do I need to do?\n\nTo make changes to your name, as well as address changes within your resident state, you may electronically change contact information within 30 days of the change. Any other changes will need to be completed in writing using the Change of Producer Status form. If failure to notify the Department of Commerce and Insurance (DCI) of your producer address change prevents DCI from serving you with a complaint, your license may be immediately revoked.\n\nHow do I meet my continuing education requirements?\n\nAll resident and non-resident producers are required to meet the continuing education requirements for Missouri. Non-residents are exempt if their state has a mandatory continuing education law.\n\nYour continuing education summary is due biennially at your license renewal.\n\n*** Licensed producers selling Long-term Care Partnership policies must complete four hours of Partnership CE every two years as part of the above required sixteen hours.***\n\nThese requirements may be waived if you:\n\nHave suffered a serious physical injury or illness.\n\nAre on active duty in the Armed Forces for an extended time.\n\nReside outside the U.S.\n\nAre 70 or older.\n\nHow do I pay my fees?\n\nYou may pay your fees with either:\n\nCompany check.\n\nBusiness entity producer check.\n\nMoney order.\n\nCashier's check.\n\nFee may be paid by check or money order, made payable to Department of Commerce & Insurance.\n\nIs there a specific statute or regulation that deals with how long a business entity (agency) must retain customer policy and claims' information?\n\nTypical Question:\n\nWe are in the process of going paperless. We have many old files that are for people that are no longer our customers. Our question is how long do we have to keep the old files, and if they are no longer insured through us do we have to keep the signed applications longer than the rest of the files.\n\nOr\n\nIs there a specific statute in regards to how long a business entity (agency) must retain customer policy information?\n\nTypical Answer:\n\nThe regulation that governs record retention is 20 CSR 700-1.140. The subsection dealing with policy records is 20 CSR 700-1.140(5), which states that a policy record file must be maintained for each policy issued for the duration of the current policy term plus three calendar years. That subsection also outlines what documents are considered \"policy records.\"\n\nRecords must be kept in an orderly manner so that the information is readily available within 5 business days per 20 CSR 700-1.140(5)(B).\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of the regulation, please read the full regulation. It can be accessed at\n\nhttps://www.sos.mo.gov/cmsimages/adrules/csr/current/20csr/20c700-1.pdf.\n\nWhat are the CMS rules for soliciting Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans?\n\nThis page from CMS lists prohibited and appropriate agent/broker behavior."
