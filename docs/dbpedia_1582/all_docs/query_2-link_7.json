        "text": "When the track list for “The Tortured Poets Department“ dropped, consensus among fans was that “loml,” the 12th track on the album, stood for “love of my life.”\n\nThe lyrics tell a different story. Like many of the other songs on “The Tortured Poets Department,” this is a song of heartbreak. Rather than love of my life, the title means loss of my life.\n\nShe describes a relationship she thought would be forever but wasn’t, singing, “What we thought was for all time, was momentary.”\n\nRevisit our live coverage of the release of “The Tortured Poets Department.”\n\nThe other person made promises, including one that ties into the song’s title: “You said I’m the love of your life.” The person also lied (or s--- talked her under a table) by “talking rings and talking cradles.”\n\nNow, she is coming to terms with the other person’s broken promises. “I’m combing through the braids of lies/ ‘I’ll never leave,’ never mind,” she sings.\n\nThe song ends with her mourning what could have been. The final words are, “You’re the loss of my life.”\n\nThe idea of forever and wedding rings comes up in other songs on the album.\n\nShe describes an incident in the song “The Tortured Poets Department,” singing, “At dinner you take my ring off my finger/ and put it on the one people put wedding rings on/ and that’s the closest I’ve come to my heart exploding.” In “Fresh Out the Slammer,” she describes a rekindled relationship with someone she used to know: “Here at the park where we used to sit on children’s swings, wearing imaginary rings.”\n\n“The Tortured Poets Department” is the first album Swift released since her breakup with Joe Alwyn.\n\nShe and the English actor were together for six years before their rumored breakup came in April 2023, which was followed by a rumored relationship with Matty Healy that appeared to span from May to June 2023. Swift hasn’t commented on either — but both are seemingly subjects on the album.\n\nRead the lyrics to 'loml'\n\nWho’s gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames\n\nIf we know the steps anyway?\n\nWe embroidered the memories of the time I was away\n\nStitching, we were just kids, babe\n\nI said I don’t mind, it takes time\n\nI thought I was better safe than starry-eyed\n\nI felt a glow like this never before and never since\n\nIf you know it in one glimpse, it’s legendary\n\nYou and I go from one kiss to getting married\n\nStill alive, killing time at the cemetery, never quite buried\n\nIn your suit and tie, in the nick of time\n\nYou low down boy, you stand up guy\n\nYou holy ghost, you told me I’m the love of your life\n\nYou said I’m the love of your life\n\nWho’s gonna tell me the truth\n\nWhen you blew in with the winds of fate\n\nAnd told me I reformed you\n\nWhen your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes,\n\nWell, you took me to hell too\n\nAnd all at once the ink bleeds\n\nA conman sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme\n\nBut I felt a hole like this never before and ever since\n\nAbout a million times\n\nIf you know it in one glimpse, it’s legendary\n\nWhat we thought was for all time, was momentary\n\nStill alive, killing time at the cemetery, never quite buried\n\nYou cinephile in black and white\n\nAll those plot twists and dynamite\n\nMr. steal-your-girl then make her cry\n\nYou said I’m the love of your life\n\nYou s----talked me under a table,\n\ntalking rings and talking cradles\n\nI wish I could unrecall how we almost had it all\n\nDancing phantoms on the terrace,\n\nare they second-hand embarrassed\n\nThat I can’t get out of bed cause something counterfeit’s dead?\n\nIt was legendary\n\nIt was momentary\n\nIt was unnecessary\n\nShould have let it stay buried\n\nOh, what a valiant roar\n\nWhat a bland goodbye\n\nThe coward claimed he was a lion\n\nI’m combing through the braids of lies\n\n“I’ll never leave,” never mind\n\nOur field of dreams engulfed in fire\n\nYour arsons matches your eyes\n\nAnd I’ll still see it until I die\n\nYou’re the loss of my life"
