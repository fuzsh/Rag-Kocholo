        "text": "Time-shifting is when a person’s experience is that they are living at an earlier time in their life. They may become disorientated and confused about time and place.\n\nA person who is time-shifted may seem to be experiencing a different reality to you. Try to remember that what they perceive is as real to them as your reality is to you.\n\nThe person may not understand what more recent technology is or does. They may not recognise friends and family as they look now, expecting them to be much younger. They may think that people who have died are still alive. They may also not recognise themselves in a mirror, as they are expecting to see a much younger version of themselves.\n\nWhat causes time-shifting?\n\nMemory is important in understanding the world. To understand what is happening now, the brain uses information from the senses, and memories.\n\nA person with dementia often has damage to their short-term memory. This means they may rely more on older memories to make sense of things now. A person with dementia may not recognise an object, or how to use it, even though they can see it clearly.\n\nFor example, the person you care for may put their electric kettle onto the stove to boil water. If the parts of the brain that store and find more recent memories are damaged, they cannot remember using an electric kettle.\n\nThey may, however, be able to recall earlier memories from their life, perhaps one which they put on a gas hob or the stove. They have shifted to a time in their life before they used electric kettles. The person may feel like they are living in the past, because they’re using older memories to fill in the gaps to make sense of the present.\n\nWho gets time-shifted?\n\nTime-shifting may be more common in Alzheimer’s disease than other types of dementia. However, people with all types of dementia are more likely to experience it as their condition progresses.\n\nA person may not always be time-shifted, but they may move in and out of being time-shifted and living in the present, perhaps over the course of a day.\n\nHow does a person experience time-shifting?\n\nA person with dementia may experience time-shifting by:\n\nAsking if they can collect the children from school, or when they can speak to their mother. They are recalling memories from much earlier in life, and possibly showing an unmet need.\n\nNot recognising themselves in the mirror, as they believe they are much younger, and the reflection is of someone much older. They can’t access recent memories of themselves.\n\nNot recognising their adult children or family, believing their children to be much younger. Their memory of them is from a much earlier time.\n\nStruggling to identify newer technology and what it is for.\n\nInterpreting people around them in a role they were familiar with in the past. For example, if the person used to run a bed and breakfast, they may think other care home residents are guests. They could help to set out tables for lunch, which is a meaningful occupation for them.\n\nSupporting a person who is experiencing time-shifting\n\nAs with delusions, pointing out mistakes to a person with dementia who is time-shifted can be very upsetting. Often you won’t often be able to convince them to recognise their current situation or surroundings, or that time- shifting is not logical.\n\nThis is because time-shifting is due to damage to the brain and is not a choice for the person with dementia. It is real to them. If the person with dementia is happy and content, think about whether correcting them is in their best interests.\n\nTips for carers supporting a person experiencing time-shifting\n\nAnnouncing their name when entering the room by saying 'Hi, it’s (name)' or similar. Other family members friends and professionals should do the same. This may help prevent the person from becoming confused and mistaking them for someone in their past.\n\nAttend carefully to what the person is saying and doing, to understand their reality. Acknowledge their worry, and explain you will try to help. They are more likely to be gently distracted, once they feel heard.\n\nNot contradicting their experience. They shouldn’t be told what is or is not true in a confrontational manner. They may become frightened or upset.\n\nRemembering that emotional memories are often easier to retrieve. Staying open, calm and friendly can help the person with dementia to associate a carer with positive emotions, even if they struggle to understand who you are in the present.\n\nRemaining calm. If a carer becomes frustrated that the person is struggling with the present, they should take themselves out of the situation until they feel calmer. Perhaps making a drink for them both, to take some time out of the room.\n\nRemembering the positive difference they make to the person with dementia. The person with dementia does not need to fully understand your reality for them to feel happy, so continue to try and do what makes them feel content.\n\nPreventing or reducing time-shifting\n\nThese tips may prevent or reduce time-shifting:\n\nRemove or replace mirrors and shiny surfaces at eye height. Some people may not recognise themselves in the reflection, if they have time-shifted to when they were much younger. They may believe their reflection to be a stranger in their home, and this can cause distress and alarm.\n\nUnless there is a problem with any appliances they have, such as their TV, avoid changing them for newer technology. They may not be able to use newer and unfamiliar items. It is better that they continue to use their appliances without help, than to introduce newer technology that they need assistance with.\n\nTalk to them about simple solutions. For example, if using the radio causes confusion, try replacing it with a model that they used when they were younger.\n\nTry and find out about their life history. This can include former job roles, daily routines, interests and important relationships. Understanding their past may help to understand how they are interpreting their present. It may also help understand questions and actions that seem odd to others (for example, someone getting up very early ‘to clock on for work’). Giving someone meaningful occupation often helps.\n\nThis is me\n\nIf a person with dementia is living in a care setting or staying in hospital, any problems they have communicating can affect the care and support they receive. Alzheimer’s Society produces a simple form called ‘This is me’ to help record personal information about a person.\n\nThis includes how the person likes to communicate, any difficulties they have, and how care and support staff can tailor their care for the person as an individual. ‘Dyma Fi’ is also available in Welsh.\n\nDownload or order a free copy of This is me\n\nDementia Support Line\n\nOur dementia advisers are here for you.\n\nDementia Support Forum\n\nVisit our online community to get advice, share experiences, connect.\n\nThink this page could be useful to someone?
