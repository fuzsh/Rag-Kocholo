Ask an Archivist.\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nArms Control and Disarmament\n\n\"With all of the history of war, and the human race's history unfortunately has been a good deal more war than peace, with nuclear weapons distributed all through the world, and available, and the strong reluctance of any people to accept defeat, I see the possibility in the 1970's of the President of the United States having to face a world in which 15 or 20 or 25 nations may have these weapons.\" --\"The President's News Conference of March 21, 1963 (107),\" Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, let us take that first step. Let us...step back from the shadow of war and seek out the way of peace. And if that journey is a thousand miles, or even more, let history record that we, in this land, at this time, took the first step.\" --\"Radio and Television Address to the American People on the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (316),\" July 26, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\n\"I have said that control of arms is a mission that we undertake particularly for our children and our grandchildren and that they have no lobby in Washington.\" --\"Statement by the President to American Women Concerning their Role in Securing World Peace (449),\" November 1, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\nThe Arts\n\n\"If more politicians knew poetry, and more poets knew politics, I am convinced the world would be a little better place in which to live.\" -- Speech at Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass., 14 June 1956. Papers of John F. Kennedy. Pre-Presidential Papers. Senate Files, Box 895, \"Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 14 June 1956.\" John F. Kennedy Presidential Library.\n\n\"There is a connection, hard to explain logically but easy to feel, between achievement in public life and progress in the arts. The age of Pericles was also the age of Phidias. The age of Lorenzo de Medici was also the age of Leonardo da Vinci. The age Elizabeth also the age of Shakespeare. And the New Frontier for which I campaign in public life, can also be a New Frontier for American art.\" --Response to letter sent by Miss Theodate Johnson, Publisher of Musical America to the two presidential candidates requesting their views on music in relation to the Federal Government and domestic world affairs. Then-Senator John Kennedy's answer was dated September 13, 1960 and published in the October issue of the magazine.\n\n\"...I am certain that after the dust of centuries has passed over our cities, we, too, will be remembered not for victories or defeats in battle or in politics, but for our contribution to the human spirit.\" --\"Remarks at a Closed-circuit Television Broadcast on Behalf of the National Cultural Center (527),\" November 29, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F.

Kennedy, 1962.\n\n\"The life of the artist is, in relation to his work, stern and lonely. He has labored hard, often amid deprivation, to perfect his skill. He has turned aside from quick success in order to strip his vision of everything secondary or cheapening. His working life is marked by intense application and intense discipline.\" --\"LOOK magazine, 'The Arts in America' (552),\" December 18, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962.\n\n\"We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda; it is a form of truth.\" --\"Remarks at Amherst College upon receiving an Honorary Degree (439),\" October 26, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F.

Kennedy, 1963.\n\n\"It may be different elsewhere. But democratic society - in it, the highest duty of the writer, the composer, the artist is to remain true to himself and to let the chips fall where they may.\" --\"Remarks at Amherst College upon receiving an Honorary Degree (439),\" October 26, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\n\"I look forward to an America which will reward achievement in the arts as we reward achievement in business or statecraft.\" --\"Remarks at Amherst College upon receiving an Honorary Degree (439),\" October 26, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\n\"The life of the arts, far from being an interruption, a distraction, in the life of a nation, is very close to the center of a nation's purpose...and is a test of the quality of a nation's civilization.\" --\"LOOK magazine, 'The Arts in America' (552),\" December 18, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962. (Inscribed at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.)\n\nChange\n\n\"But Goethe tells us in his greatest poem that Faust lost the liberty of his soul when he said to the passing moment: 'Stay, thou art so fair.' And our liberty, too, is endangered if we pause for the passing moment, if we rest on our achievements, if we resist the pace of progress. For time and the world do not stand still. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future.\" --\"Address in the Assembly Hall at the Paulskirche in Frankfurt (266),\" June 25, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\nChildren\n\n\"Children are the world's most valuable resource and its best hope for the future.\" --\"Re: United States Committee for UNICEF July 25, 1963.\" Papers of John F. Kennedy. Presidential Papers. White House Central Files. Chronological File, Box 11, \"July 1963: 16-31.\" JFK Library.\n\n\"We can say with some assurance that, although children may be the victims of fate, they will not be the victims of our neglect.\" --\"Remarks upon signing the Maternal and Child Health and Mental Retardation Planning Bill (434),\" October 24, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\nCivil Service\n\n\"I have pledged myself and my colleagues in the cabinet to a continuous encouragement of initiative, responsibility and energy in serving the public interest. Let every public servant know, whether his post is high or low, that a man's rank and reputation in this Administration will be determined by the size of the job he does, and not by the size of his staff, his office or his budget. Let it be clear that this Administration recognizes the value of dissent and daring -- that we greet healthy controversy as the hallmark of healthy change. Let the public service be a proud and lively career. And let every man and woman who works in any area of our national government, in any branch, at any level, be able to say with pride and with honor in future years: 'I served the United States Government in that hour of our nation's need.'\" --\"Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union (11),\" January 30, 1961, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1961.\n\n\"The success of this Government, and thus the success of our Nation, depends in the last analysis upon the quality of our career services. The legislation enacted by the Congress, as well as the decisions made by me and by the department and agency heads, must all be implemented by the career men and women in the Federal service. In foreign affairs, national defense, science and technology, and a host of other fields, they face problems of unprecedented importance and perplexity. We are all dependent on their sense of loyalty and responsibility as well as their competence and energy.\" --\"Special Message to the Congress on Federal Pay Reform (55),\" February 20, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962.\n\nEconomics\n\n\"Rising tide lifts all boats\". --\"Remarks in Pueblo, Colorado following Approval of the Frying Pan-Arkansas Project (336),\" August 17, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F.

Kennedy, 1962.\n\n\"If the economy of today were operating close to capacity levels with little unemployment, or if a sudden change in our military requirements should cause a scramble for men and resources, then I would oppose tax reductions as irresponsible and inflationary; and I would not hesitate to recommend a tax increase if that were necessary.\" --\"Address and Question and Answer Period at the Economic Club of New York (549),\" December 14, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962.\n\nGoals, National\n\n\"For one true measure of a nation is its success in fulfilling the promise of a better life for each of its members. Let this be the measure of our nation.\" --\"Special message to the Congress on National Health Needs (65),\" February 27, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962.\n\n\"Our deep spiritual confidence that this nation will survive the perils of today - which may well be with us for decades to come - compels us to invest in our nation's future, to consider and meet our obligations to our children and the numberless generations that will follow.\" --\"Special message to the Congress on Conservation (69),\" March 1, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962.\n\n\"I have seen in many places housing which has been developed under government influences, but I have never seen any projects in which governments have played their part which have fountains and statues and grass and trees, which are as important to the concept of the home as the roof itself.\" --\"Remarks at the Unidad Independencia Housing Project, City of Mexico (269),\" June 30, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962.\n\n\"It's only when they join together in a forward movement that this country moves ahead...\" --\"Remarks at Los Banos, CA at the Groundbreaking Ceremonies for the San Luis Dam (337),\" August 18, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962.\n\n\"Our goal is not the victory of might but the vindication of right...not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom, here in this hemisphere, and, we hope, around the world. God willing, that goal will be achieved.\" --\"Radio and Television Report to the American People on the Soviet Arms Build-up in Cuba (485),\" October 22, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962.\n\n\"This country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor.\" --\"Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union (12),\" January 14, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\n\"And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.\" --\"Commencement Address at American University in Washington, D.C. (232),\" June 10, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\nHistory\n\n\"A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers. (439)\" --\"Remarks at Amherst College upon receiving an Honorary Degree (439),\" October 26, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\nIdealism\n\n\"...we shall be as a city upon a hill - the eyes of all people are upon us.\" (Winthrop) -- Speech before the Massachusetts State Legislature, Boston, Massachusetts, 9 January 1961. Papers of John F. Kennedy. Presidential Papers. President's Office Files, Box 34, \"Address to Massachusetts State Legislature 9 January 1961.\" JFK Library.\n\n\"A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on\". --\"Remarks Recorded for the Opening of a USIA Transmitter at Greenville, North Carolina (55),\" February 8, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents, John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\nInaugural Address (full speech)\n\n\"Ask not what your country can do for you...ask what you can do for your country.\"\n\n\"All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, not in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.\"\n\n\"Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\"\n\n\"Inaugural Address (1),\" January 20, 1961, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1961.\n\nJefferson\n\n\"I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.\" --\"Remarks at a Dinner Honoring Nobel Prize Winners of the Western Hemisphere (161),\" April 29, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962.\n\nNavy\n\n\"I can imagine a no more rewarding career.

Kennedy, 1963.\n\n\"New Frontier\"\n\nFirst mentioned on July 15, 1960 when accepting nomination for the U.S. presidency.\n\nPerseverance\n\n\"...what really counts is not the immediate act of courage or of valor, but those who bear the struggle day in and day out - not the sunshine patriots but those who are willing to stand for a long period of time.\" --\"Remarks at the White House to Members of the American Legion (70),\" March 1, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962.\n\nPolitical Courage\n\n\"Today the challenge of political courage looms larger than ever before. For our everyday life is becoming so saturated with the tremendous power of mass communications that any unpopular or unorthodox course arouses a storm of protests such as John Quincy Adams – under attack in 1807 – could never have envisioned. Our political life is becoming so expensive, so mechanized and so dominated by professional politicians and public relations men that the idealist who dreams of independent statesmanship is rudely awakened by the necessities of election and accomplishment... And thus, in the days ahead, only the very courageous will be able to take the hard and unpopular decisions necessary for our survival…\" --Profiles in Courage (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1956)\n\n\"In whatever arena of life one may meet the challenge of courage, whatever may be the sacrifices he faces if he follows his conscience – the loss of his friends, his fortune, his contentment, even the esteem of his fellow men – each man must decide for himself the course he will follow. The stories of past courage can define that ingredient – they can teach, they can offer hope, they can provide inspiration. But they cannot supply courage itself. For this each man must look into his own soul.”--Profiles in Courage\n\nPresidency\n\n\"If all of you had voted the other way - there's about 5,500 of you here tonight - I would not be the President of the United States.\" --\"Address in Chicago at a dinner of the Democratic Party of Cook County (155),\" April 28, 1961, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1961.\n\n\"When I ran for Presidency of the United States, I knew that this country faced serious challenges, but I could not realize - nor could any man realize who does not bear the burdens of this office - how heavy and constant would be those burdens\" --\"Radio and Television Report to the American People on the Berlin Crisis (302),\" July 25, 1961, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1961.\n\n\"Harry Truman once said, 'There are 14 or 15 million Americans who have the resources to have representatives in Washington to protect their interests, and that the interests of the great mass of the other people - the 150 or 160 million - is the responsibility of the president of the United States, and I propose to fulfill it.'\" --\"Address in Atlantic City at the Convention of the United Auto Workers (174),\" May 8, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962.\n\nRepublicans\n\n\"We have all seen these circus elephants complete with tusks, ivory in their head and thick skins, who move around the circus ring and grab the tail of the elephant ahead of them.\" --Speech at the Cow Palace, San Francisco, California, 2 November 1960. Papers of John F. Kennedy. Pre-Presidential Papers. Senate Files, Box 914, \"Cow Palace, San Francisco, California, 2 November 1960.\" JFK Library.\n\nResponsibility, Collective\n\n\"Let us not despair but act. Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past - let us accept our own responsibility for the future.\" --Speech at Loyola College Alumni Banquet, Baltimore, Maryland, 18 February, 1958. Papers of John F. Kennedy. Pre-Presidential Papers. Senate Files, Box 899, \"Loyola College annual alumni banquet, Baltimore, Maryland, 18 February 1958.\" JFK Library.\n\n\"But I think the American people expect more from us than cries of indignation and attack. The times are too grave, the challenge too urgent, and the stakes too high to permit the customary passions of political debate. We are not here to curse the darkness, but to light the candle that can guide us through that darkness to a safe and sane future. As Winston Churchill said on taking office some twenty years ago: if we open a quarrel between the present and the past, we shall be in danger of losing the future.\" --Speech accepting the Democratic nomination, Los Angeles, California, 15 July 1960. Papers of John F. Kennedy. Pre-Presidential Papers. Senate Files, Box 910, \"Acceptance Speech of Senator Kennedy, Democratic National Convention, 15 July 1960.\" JFK Library. (References the Chinese proverb, \"it is better to light a candle than curse the darkness.\")\n\n\"And we must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient - that we are only six percent of the world's population - that we cannot impose our will upon the other ninety-four percent of mankind - that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity - and that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.\" --\"Address in Seattle at the University of Washington's 100th Anniversary Program (473),\" November 16, 1961, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1961.\n\n\"But however close we sometimes seem to that dark and final abyss, let no man of peace and freedom despair. For he does not stand alone.\" --\"Address to the U.N. General Assembly (387),\" September 25, 1961, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1961.\n\n\"Never before has man had such capacity to control his own environment, to end thirst and hunger, to conquer poverty and disease, to banish illiteracy and massive human misery. We have the power to make this the best generation of mankind in the history of the world - or make it the last.\" --\"Address before the 18th General Assembly of the United Nations (366),\" September 20, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\n\"In seeking the help of the Congress and our countrymen, I pledged no easy answers. I pledged, and asked, only toil and dedication. These the Congress and the people have given in good measure.\" --\"Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union,\" January 14, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\nResponsibility, Personal\n\n\"When at some future date the high court of history sits in judgment on each of us...our success or failure...will be measured by the answers to four questions: First, were we truly men of courage...? Secondly, were we truly men of judgment...? Third, were we truly men of integrity...? Finally, were we truly men of dedication...?\" --Speech before the Massachusetts State Legislature, Boston, Massachusetts, 9 January 1961. Papers of John F. Kennedy. Presidential Papers.

Kennedy, 1961.\n\n\"...we must think and act not only for the moment but for our time. I am reminded of the story of the great French Marshal Lyautey, who once asked his gardener to plant a tree. The gardener objected that the tree was slow-growing and would not reach maturity for a hundred years. The Marshal replied, 'In that case, there is no time to lose, plant it this afternoon.'\" --\"Address in Berkeley at the University of California, (109),\" March 23, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F.

Kennedy, 1963. (President Kennedy was quoting from the Bible, Gospel of Luke, Chapter 12, verse 48.)\n\n\"Dante once said that the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in periods of moral crisis maintain their neutrality.\" --\"Remarks in Bonn at the Signing of a Charter Establishing the German Peace Corps (258),\" June 24, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963. (Note: Dante never made this statement. The closest to what President Kennedy meant is in the Inferno where the souls in the ante-room of hell, who \"lived without disgrace and without praise,\" and the coward angels, who did not rebel but did not resist the cohorts of Lucifer, are condemned to being whirled through the air by great winds while being stung by wasps and horseflies.)\n\nThe Sea\n\n\"I really don't know why it is that all of us are so committed to the sea, except I think it's because in addition to the fact that the sea changes, and the light changes, and ships change, it's because we all came from the sea. And it is an interesting biological fact that all of us have, in our veins the exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean, and, therefore, we have salt in our blood, in our sweat, in our tears. We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea - whether it is to sail or to watch it - we are going back from whence we came.\" --\"Remarks in Newport at the Australian Ambassador's Dinner for the America's Cup Crews (383),\" September 14, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962.\n\nSpace\n\n\"We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of preeminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war.\" --\"Address at Rice University in Houston on the Nation's Space Effort (373),\" September 12, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F.

Kennedy, 1963. (The original anecdote from which Kennedy derived this comparison is in Frank O'Connor, An Only Child, London: MacMillan & Co. Ltd., 1961, p. 180.)\n\nStudents\n\n\"No country can possibly move ahead, no free society can possibly be sustained, unless it has an educated citizenry whose qualities of mind and heart permit it to take part in the complicated and increasingly sophisticated decisions that pour not only upon the President and upon the Congress, but upon all the citizens who exercise the ultimate power...Quite obviously, there is a higher purpose, and that is the hope that you will turn to the service of the State the scholarship, the education, the qualities which society has helped develop in you; that you will render on the community level, or on the state level, or on the national level, or the international level a contribution to the maintenance of freedom and peace and the security of our country and those associated with it in a most critical time.\" --\"Commencement Address at San Diego State College (226),\" June 6, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F.

Kennedy, 1963.\n\n\"What we seek to advance, what we seek to develop in all of our colleges and universities, are educated men and women who can bear the burdens of responsible citizenship, who can make judgments about life as it is, and as it must be, and encourage the people to make those decisions which can bring not only prosperity and security, but happiness to the people of the United States and those who depend upon it.\" --\"Address at the University of North Dakota (379),\" September 25, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\n\"I hope that all of you who are students here will recognize the great opportunity that lies before you in this decade, and in the decades to come, to be of service to our country. The Greeks once defined happiness as full use of your powers along lines of excellence, and I can assure you that there is no area of life where you will have an opportunity to use whatever powers you have, and to use them along more excellent lines, bringing ultimately, I think, happiness to you and those whom you serve.\" --\"Address at the University of Wyoming (381),\" September 25, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\n\"I ask particularly that those of you who are now in school will prepare yourselves to bear the burden of leadership over the next 40 years here in the United States, and make sure that the United States - which I believe almost alone has maintained watch and ward for freedom - that the United States meet its responsibility. That is a wonderful challenge for us as a people.\" --\"Remarks at the Cheney Stadium in Tacoma, Washington (387),\" September 27, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963.\n\n\"...I come here today...not just because you are doing well and because you are outstanding students, but because we expect something of you. And unless in this free country of ours we are able to demonstrate that we are able to make this society work and progress, unless we can hope that from you we are going to get back all of the talents which society has helped develop in you, then, quite obviously, all the hopes of all of us that freedom will not only endure but prevail, of course, will be disappointed. So we ask the best of you...I congratulate you on what you have done, and most of all I congratulate you on what you are going to do.\" --\"Remarks in New York City to the National Convention of the Catholic Youth Organization (463),\" November 15, 1963, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1963."
