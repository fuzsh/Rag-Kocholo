        "text": "Because YouTube thinks I’m stealing my OWN CONTENT, I have to note that you’ll find that my YouTube channel, https://www.youtube.com/stephaniebethany, also contains the above video and content because I CREATED IT. Thanks~\n\nNote: This is not meant to gatekeep, make people feel bad or left out, or anything along those lines. This is an honest, questioning conversation regarding an evolving term and movement that has little clarity. We’re allowed to talk and ask questions. Let’s converse.\n\nAwhile ago, I made a short video to give a very basic understanding of neurodiversity to people, most specifically helping people understand what people even meant when people said \"neurodivergent\" or \"neurotypical,\" etc.\n\nIt appears that recently there's been an uptick in interest in this, and much of the response is the question, why is this so vague?\n\nIt's a good question. It's one I wanted to learn about, myself, because people keep asking me what counts as neurodivergent, and I've been mostly answering based on what I've heard. For that, I apologize. I really think this understanding is necessary because it is a topic that I think many of us have accepted nearly-blindly and are applying fast-and-loose to a lot of things.\n\nThe term neurodiversity was first used by Judy Singer in 1998 and was applied nearly-exclusively to autism at the time (Tougaw, 2020). However, using the term to reflect the concept of biodiversity, and the name of the term itself, lends easily to the idea that we're not just talking about autism versus not-autism.\n\nThus begins the muddying of the waters. One of the main stances of the neurodiversity movement is that our brains are diverse, and pathologizing that and demanding us to be cured or act like the majority is wrong and unfair. Baron-Cohen makes an interesting argument on the status of autism as a disability that does not meet the criteria of a disorder, which makes sense for the idea of neurodiversity (Baron-Cohen, 2017).\n\nBut this idea spreads and people begin to wonder what other things are just diversities of the brain to be celebrated. This is where it becomes vague, because who wants to gatekeep a neurological difference, especially when they may not understand it well, just as many have not understood autism well?\n\nLet's review some different sources to see what they list as neurodivergent, and then we'll go over whether that actually makes sense, and what currently actually fits with the input of a very-well written post I'm happy to have run across.\n\nPossibly one of the broadest lists, an article by Jason Tougaw published on Psychology Today mentions the following as part of neurodiversity (and thus neurodivergent conditions): autism, epilepsy, Tourette's syndrome, mania, depression, hallucination, dyslexia, prosopognosia, migraine, synesthesia, bipolar, schizophrenia, and psychosis (2020). It's not intended to be an all-encompassing list, but definitely highlights many things that other sources don't appear to mention at all.\n\nAnother source, Different Brains, indicates neurodivergent conditions by a list of \"virtually every neurodiversity diagnosis and topic\" they talk about on their site: ADHD, Anxiety, Apraxia, Asperger’s Syndrome (ASD), Autism, Alzheimer’s Disease, Bipolar, Concussions, Depression, Down Syndrome, Dyslexia, Epilepsy, Misophonia, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Parkinson’s Disease, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Tourettes (“Topics,” n.d.). It is worth noting that with the “and topic” portion, Different Brains may not be trying to say that everything on that list is considered neurodivergent, as many of them are common comorbidities and thus can be rather relevant.\n\nYet another source, Exceptional Individuals, lists what I believe are the most commonly accepted neurodivergent conditions: dyslexia, dyspraxia, autism, and ADHD. Under \"other\" they add Meares-Irlen Syndrome, hyperlexia, Tourette Syndrome, OCD, and Synesthesia. They add anxiety under \"related\" (“Other Neurodivergent Conditions,” n.d.).\n\nYou might be like me and hesitate to add things that indicate poor mental health like depression and anxiety to a list of fundamental brain differences that should be celebrated. While many people with neurodivergent conditions do experience these (in fact, a large portion of the population in general), that doesn't make them neurodivergent conditions to be respected and celebrated. Arguably, there is no real strength to them, either.\n\nI came across this insightful post on, of all places, Tumblr, that actually parses out what makes sense to be a part of neurodivergence and what doesn't really well. Feel free to check out their full post, as they lay out a pretty convincing argument.\n\nThey point out that neurodiversity was born out of the autistic community and stands against cures and sometimes even treatments, basically anything to try to make that person no longer themselves. Clearly, most people would and need to seek treatment regarding depression, for example, as it endangers their life. They also point out that most mental illnesses are \"not lifelong variations in neurotype\" (Katherine, n.d.). They go on to argue that disorders that would fall under neurodivergent conditions are those that are developmental in nature, life-long, and aren't going away. They're integral parts of how that person exists. The post was specifically to address the question of whether DID/OSDD-1 was considered neurodivergent, and they argue it's not because it is specifically caused by an event or action, not a naturally-occurring neurotype, and can eventually end in integration (or what I have heard is now called fusion).\n\nThat doesn't mean that someone with DID/OSDD-1 has a normal or typically-working brain, and this is mostly why people get confused. Someone with DID/OSDD-1 wouldn’t be considered neurotypical, but they also don’t really fall under having a naturally-occurring difference in neurotype. However, since the trauma that triggers the condition must happen in childhood, there could be an argument made that it is in some way developmental, and thus brings in the question of if developmental changes before a certain cut-off age are considered natural or not. The broad implications of neurodiversity are that if a brain is different, it should be celebrated and respected as such. And it's a good portion of why a lot of people are against the movement.\n\nI'm not interested in celebrating depression - it's taken the lives of so many people, especially autistic people. But mental illness is not the same as autism or ADHD. Additionally, I want to be sure to point out that it doesn't mean that I think people with depression should be cast aside or considered worthless or less-than. People with chronic depression can get treatment to help manage it and lead good lives. Just because someone has a condition, whether a mental illness or not, doesn't make them not worth being here or participating in society, whether that condition is viewed positively or negatively.\n\nI agree in part with the author of the post regarding the DID question: neurodivergent conditions should be those that are developmental. So, let's look at what are considered to be neurodevelopmental disorders:\n\nNDDs comprise intellectual disability (ID); Communication Disorders; Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); Neurodevelopmental Motor Disorders, including Tic Disorders; and Specific Learning Disorders.\n\n(Morris-Rosendahl & Crocq, 2020)\n\nThe paper that provided the official list of neurodevelopmental conditions also predicted that eventually schizophrenia and bipolar would likely be added to the spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. According to this, we can confirm that autism, ADHD, Tourette's and other tic disorders, intellectual disability, communication disorders (like issues with expressive language, for example), and specific learning disorders like dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia would be considered neurodivergent.\n\nTentatively, this could include schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Just as this is a prediction for the future, these conditions are debated over whether they're included on the neurodivergent list.\n\nThis leads me, personally, to another question. Do we celebrate all neurodevelopmental disorders as neurodivergent minds? Though most of them have been noted as a kind of disability, and most neurodiversity movement proponents can concede on that fact, there's disagreement on the social or medical models of disability. But the idea is that there are unique abilities or differences that are good about these things, too. We often try to help people understand the positives of autism, or how ADHDers work differently but can be great at things and so can many with learning disorders that often speak to their brains' different processing that leads to great strengths in other areas.\n\nBut what about some of these that don't have apparent benefits? Some find benefit of religious-like roles for those with schizophrenia, but from a brief look, I wasn't finding anyone declaring any kind of real positive to those with it. Those with bipolar could be really productive sometimes, but most work hard to manage and treat the condition to achieve stability. And other than some reported social strengths and some strengths in areas of the brain from suppressing tics, what benefit is there in not seeking treatment and relief for Tourette's syndrome's tics, especially the ones that cause the person harm?\n\nI want to make it clear that I agree that all of these things shouldn't be shamed or demonized. I think awareness, knowledge, and understanding in any of these areas is fantastic. Just because something isn't necessarily objectively positive doesn’t mean that someone should live in misery or be ashamed or afraid. We should learn about how these things work so we're not trying to force harmless stims to stop or punish those with Tourette's for their tics. But does that mean celebrating the condition itself if it only brings issue to a person's life?\n\nThis leads me even further to the debate around a cure for autism. Obviously, we're pretty certain that a cure would be basically impossible due to the nature of autism. If a cure means stopping the birth of children with risk of autism, then obviously that's horrible. But if somehow there were a cure that could be taken at any time during one's life, there are some who would want it, whose experiences of negative things outweigh any positives they perceive. I believe that should be a choice of the individual, not something imposed on all autistic people or suggested as an obvious answer, because many of us have unique positives associated with autism. More ideally, something that could help reduce the most disabling affects and/or comorbidities of autism without changing the person could potentially be beneficial. However, accepting diagnosis, accepting positive and negative, are imperative to someone's wellbeing.\n\nAt the heart of this, neurodivergent is much more restricted than most use it today. Many use it to describe any type of brain change, but once you dip into that, literally everyone would be considered neurodivergent, and thus no one at the same time - the significance of the truly different way that autistic people's brains work would be effectively erased, for example. Part of the concept of neurodiversity is that it is a naturally-occurring difference, not one instigated by specific events or that happen later on in life. Additionally, there is some debate around the word “neurodiversity” and “neurodivergent” being completely different, but this adds to confusion.\n\nThe neurodiversity movement wants to help de-stigmatize and de-pathologize natural differences. But there are fair criticisms to it, and many are taking it well beyond any type of border it may have.\n\nWhat do you think?"
