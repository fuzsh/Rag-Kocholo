        "text": "Prayers for Letting Go\n\nLightening the Load\n\nThe first thing we have to do\n\nis to notice\n\nthat we've loaded down this camel\n\nwith so much baggage\n\nwe'll never get through the desert alive\n\nSomething has to go.\n\nThen we can begin to dump\n\nthe thousand things\n\nwe've brought along\n\nuntil even the camel has to go\n\nand we're walking barefoot\n\non the desert sand.\n\nThere's no telling what will happen then.\n\nBut I've heard that someone,\n\nwalking in this way,\n\nhas seen a burning bush.\n\n-Francis Dorff, O. Praem.\n\nBack to top\n\nDesperate Prayer To Let Go\n\nLoving Lord Jesus, I want to yield up my life into Your hands for my life seems to be falling apart at the seams and I am desperate. Oh Lord, I don’t know which way to turn nor do I know what to do, and I am coming to You confessing my need of You in my life, and pray that You will forgive me of my pride in trying to be the god of my own existence. Lord, I have made me the centre of my life and not You, and I pray You would help me to change.\n\nLord, I don’t really know how to “let go”. I don’t really know what to do to give You control of my life, but I am coming to You in humility of heart to admit that I can do nothing in my own strength and to confess my need of You in my life. Lord, I pray that Your grace and mercy would lead and guide me and take control.\n\nBut Lord, I also ask that You would teach me how to submit my life to You. Show me how to abide in You day by day, and instruct me how to live in spirit and truth. Help me Lord, to give control of my life over to You in every way, and to become the person You would have me be. Thank You Lord, that You have not given up on me and I ask You to teach me Your way from this day forward. In Jesus' name I pray,\n\nAmen.\n\n-Author Unknown\n\nBack to top\n\nPrayer to Let Go of The Past\n\nLord, I kneel before You in humble submission and pray that in Your mercy and kindness You would help me to simply let go of all the fears and worries, problems and doubts, guilt and disappointments that seem to be filling my heart and mind so often, during the course of a day.\n\nFill my hurting soul with Your love and peace I pray. Fill the emptiness and pain that is tearing my life asunder. Lord, You know what is in my heart and why I am going through this time of fear and worry. Help me Lord, to take every thought captive, to hand it over to You as it rears up in my mind, and help me to replace it with thoughts and words of Scripture that tell of Your great might and wonderful power.\n\nLord, You have told us to think about whatever is lovely and pure and holy and good, and I pray that You would help me to turn the eyes of my heart upon Jesus and look to Him day by day. In Jesus' name I pray,\n\nAmen.\n\n-Author Unknown\n\nBack to top\n\nLetting Go\n\nDear Jesus,\n\nPlease hear my prayer. I go along each day, trying to run my life my own way. I forget to let go and give you control.\n\nI wonder why things aren't going the way I want them to go. I forget to stop and ask what you want, Lord. Please help me to give you control, Jesus. I want to follow you. I want what you desire for me.\n\nHelp me to realize that when you close one door, you open the one you want me to walk through. Help me also to realize that what I desire may not be what is meant for me, or what is best for me. Maybe it will lead me away from what your great plan is for me.\n\nLord, let me accept each day as a gift. Let me follow the path you choose for me. Help me to be thankful for what you give me and not to worry about my needs. I trust you will take care of all my needs. Remind me that my role is to care for those around me and focus on those who need my help.\n\nHelp me not to be judgmental, as we are all equal in God's eyes. Help me to see the good in all of your creations. Let me leave the judging to you, dear Jesus. Instead, I will concentrate on living to please you!\n\nHelp me, dear Jesus, be who and what you want me to be. Give me strength, faith and hope, and most of all, give me guidance each and every day. I let go and give you control."
