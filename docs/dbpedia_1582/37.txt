I'm gonna let the glory roll when the roll is called in Glory

I'll gonna get beside myself when I get beside the King that day

I'm gonna have the time of my life when the time of my life is over

I'm gonna get carried away when I get carried away

Well, I don't know why I become a little shy

When I get around a whole lotta people

And I can't figure out why I never can shout

About the love that floods my soul

Well, I must confess, I can't express

The feelings deep inside me

But the things I know and cannot show

One day will overflow

I'm gonna let the glory roll when the roll is called in Glory

I'll gonna get beside myself when I get beside the King that day

I'm gonna have the time of my life when the time of my life is over

I'm gonna get carried away when I get carried away

Oh, I'll pass the clouds and shout so loud it may sound like thunder

My tearful eyes may fill the skies until it looks like rain

When I leave this world past the gates of pearl and stand before my Savior

Iâ€™ll let my soul let the glory roll when from the roll He calls my name

I'm gonna let the glory roll when the roll is called in Glory

I'll gonna get beside myself when I get beside the King that day

I'm gonna have the time of my life when the time of my life is over

I'm gonna get carried away when I get carried away

I'm gonna let the glory roll when the roll is called in Glory

I'll gonna get beside myself when I get beside the King that day

I'm gonna have the time of my life when the time of my life is over

I'm gonna get carried away when I get carried away
