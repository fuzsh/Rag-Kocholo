Was a bug, little bug, hardly there

How he felt, what he dreamed, who could care?

Without any evidence

(His flaws were many)

He was full of confidence

(Some people haven't any)

Didn't have much common sense

(It's highly overrated)

He just knew that he'd come through

It's the time of your life so live it well

It's the time of your life so live it well

We may only go 'round one time

As far as I can tell

It's the time of your life so live it well

We may only go 'round this one time

As far as I can tell

(He could be wrong about that)

It's the time of your life

It's the time of your life

It's the time of your life so live it well

(instrumental)

It's the time of your life so live it well

It's the time of your life so live it well

We may only go 'round one time

As far as I can tell

It's the time of your life, so live it well

Like us all, he started small

Then he grew

When the time came he knew what to do

He knew in order to succeed

(They'd have to work together)

He turned a rock into a seed

(And they were changed forever)

Then they had the strength they'd need

(To get through stormy weather)

Do or die, you gotta try

It's the time of your life so live it well

It's the time of your life so live it well

We may only go 'round one time

As far as I can tell

(He could be wrong about that)

It's the time of your life so live it well

Isn't it a bit surprising

How one's fortunes ebb and flow

And only to the enterprising

Does the magic fortune cookie go

Believe me

It's the time of your life so live it well

It's the time of your life so live it well

We may only go 'round one time

As far as I can tell

It's the time of your life

It's the time of your life

It's the time of your life so live it well
