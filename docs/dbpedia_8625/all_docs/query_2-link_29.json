        "text": "I wanted to screen a documentary from the states I have been given permission for. As a way of showing up and contributing to my community. As someone who experienced what could diagnosed as ‚Äúschizophrenia‚Äù ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù. When the Bondi attack happened it felt like this was needed even more so. As I only heard one voice who recognised my perspective, and that was a voice on social media and wasn‚Äôt part of the mainstream. Yet I didn‚Äôt understand that there is no funding for individuals to do something for their community. The grants I went through the process to apply for told me I am not eligible. You have to have an organisation. And I don‚Äôt have the capacity to start an NGO or some other association. For years I have been forthright on that which I care about and have hoped and searched for others to team up with for when I have the capacity to organise to no avail. Last year I made a beautiful event on my own appart from one friend that helped clean on the night. Out of my own pocket. A jobseeker pocket. This year I don‚Äôt have the means. Perhaps there are many on this platform who can educate me as to why individuals shouldn‚Äôt be funded. I just wanted to express my disappointment in this reality. As it means that something that could have happened is not happening. And I see zero NGOs doing it. As I said my perspective is overall not recognised. It seems strange to me that we fund NGOs to empower people that are directly impacted to create change. And we don‚Äôt fund people we are directly impacted who are wishing to create change themselves. #grassrootsactivism #schizophrenia #psychosis #education #youth #community #sydney #funding #mentalhealth #bondiattack\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm only unemployed in the white man‚Äôs world‚Äù stays a top tier quote‚Ä¶ Anyway, welcome to Day 15 of Let‚Äôs Go to Mexicooo! Let‚Äôs talk about work. Please be clear, I do not dream of labor. If I decided to nap for the rest of my life it would be deserved. I is tired. I rarely share about my past work history as it‚Äôs painful to accept that I wasted 35 years of my life on jobs that crushed my spirit in pursuit of a dream that was never intended for me. I‚Äôve been a 10 year+ corporate employee in a corner office, a nursery teacher who taught my kiddos to meditate, a successful home organizer, a delivery driver on nearly every platform, and I ran a Rent-A-Robin business. Wait - that isn‚Äôt how it sounds‚Ä¶ My point is, I‚Äôm a Black woman. I know how to WORK. Over the past few years my cognitive abilities have started to decline. I have C-PTSD (complex post-traumatic stress disorder) which makes it difficult for my brain to process new information or understand basic instructions anymore. Fast forward to today and I‚Äôm self-employed. Ok fine, I can‚Äôt actually describe my job but I STAY busy. What I DO know is that I don‚Äôt work for capitalism - I serve my community. Over the past two years I‚Äôve: - Educated people about poverty and mutual aid - Co-founded the Decolonized Community Care Fund - Curated a Black Business Guide (Summer 2024 edition out soon) - Started my Poverty Sucks Substack which has over 100+ informative posts - Created the Palestine Resource Guide which I‚Äôve updated daily since January Oh! And I‚Äôve done this while I live in poverty, have severe depression, experience sleep deprivation and deal with chronic financial stress. Can you imagine what I‚Äôd be able to create if I was resourced, rested and had time for my nervous system to recover? Chile please‚Ä¶ But what I really want to do is write my Poverty Sucks book - it‚Äôs time. All I need is space to breathe (and a dope home office with an ocean view.)

If you're driven to make a difference, #Volunteer #Education #Healthcare #Leadership why not start in your community? This video addresses my daily question: \"Why are you doing this? Throughout my life, I empathized with those facing adversity. As I matured, I realized I could take action to assist them. At each stage, I offered aid in whatever capacity possible, gradually alleviating that initial sense of helplessness. _As a student, I volunteered at an orphanage. _As a working adult, I donated money. _As a mother, I contributed breast milk to those in need. _Witnessing a caregiver's dire living conditions spurred me to build her a home. During personal struggles, including family tragedies and mental health challenges, I recognized the need for support. Despite my leadership background, I was adrift, unable to make decisions or find joy in life. Attempts to mask my turmoil for the sake of social interactions proved futile; people either ignored or dismissed my struggles. Yet, my dedication to uplifting others persisted. Why do I volunteer? Because it's my calling. I advocate for women, children, and education. Regardless of race or circumstance, everyone deserves access to education, autonomy, and freedom. This video symbolizes my battle against despair and commitment to steering disadvantaged youth away from the streets towards education. They are the future. #4Future #Classforfree #4Future.us\n\nI request for your few minutes to read my story Benevity GlobalGiving I am Alex Bwaluka, I am the founder and Executive Director of Charity Centre for Children and Youth Development (CCCYD) in Zambia. After my mother gave birth to me when she was 15-years-old, she dropped out of school. Later, my father abandoned her. I came to know my father when I was 15 years old, but he still refused to be responsible for my education or involved in my life. I had decided that I would support myself and began to attend school at the age of twelve because mum was also poor to support my education. In order for me to raise money for my education, I started running a small business selling chicken and goats. I walked eight days from Kasempa, Zambia to Kipushi in the Democratic Republic of Congo to sell either chicken or goat. In spite of the struggle, I was resolute and did not look back until I finished school in 2004. In December 2016, I completed my bachelor‚Äôs degree in development studies at Zambian Open University and graduated on 1st September 2017. My life history led me to form CCCYD in 2005. I was determined to make things different for women and children who shared challenges similar to my mother and me or worse. Since 2005, our team has worked with thousands of people, sending orphans and vulnerable children to school, and providing vocational training and business coaching to local women. In our current projects, we are helping 21 girls with post secondary education scholarship in partnership with Beautiful World Canada foundation, Girls mentorship, supporting 4500 rural farmers with business simulation training helping them turn farming into business, help 500 orphan caregivers and 1500 youth with business skills. We have also established a school and providing primary education to over 2500 orphans. We identify the poorest self-employed parents who are unable to earn enough money and live in extreme poverty due to lack of small investment capital or skills. To grow their micro-businesses, we provide these families with hands-on coaching and starter-up Capital ranging from $50 to $100. We help them increase productivity and earn higher incomes. It all helps to pull children and families out of extreme #poverty in a sustainable way. I am writing this to you so that you can understand why I have offered my time for others and how you can help us continue with this #cause. We want to continue building self-reliance and resilience in the most vulnerable children and the youth through the continued provision of micro-entrepreneurship and help provide #education, improve infrastructure at our Fortune School of Excellence in Solwezi. I have changed my life through education, and I know the potential education has in changing our world.

In the words of Robin Divine, our goal is: To connect people who HAVE money with people who NEED money. üëâ Got an emergency? Community Care in action takes care of that. üëâ Have monthly expenses that are necessary for your survival but put you at a deficit every month? Community Care in action takes care of that. üëâ You're an artist who needs and deserves to be paid to create, and the money isn't there. Community Care in action takes care of that. üëâ Your basic needs are taken care of, but you need a fucking break from feeling the strain of finances, and you would rather put your energy to use in the gym, receiving gender-affirming care, therapy, and anything that takes you from surviving to thriving. Community Care in action takes care of that. üëâ You need access to resources that aren't money, but that make your life a hell of a lot easier. Community Care in action takes care of that. Historically, if these types of movements aren't under some type of Capitalist umbrella, they're considered terr*ri$t groups. That's a weird way to say Community Care, but okay, challenge accepted. Stay tuned, and also, actively participate NOW in helping people in the LinkedIn Community who are already asking for help. A dollar is a dollar that someone else doesn't have, that will come back to you based sheerly on privilege. Those aren't fighting words, it's just how the System has been designed. You know who these people are who need help - you see their posts on your feed. And if you don't, then start expanding who you're following. Let's get to work - if you haven't already. We've got this, together. #CommunityCare #MutualAid #Decolonization\n\nI request for your few minutes to read my story Benevity GlobalGiving I am Alex Bwaluka, I am the founder and Executive Director of Charity Centre for Children and Youth Development (CCCYD) in Zambia.

Raised below the poverty line and in an impoverished community, I grappled with academic struggles and behavioral health issues. My neighborhood was filled with adversity, but what rescued me were passionate individuals working to uplift young lives.\" üî• In 2020, I launched the Change Me Foundation, driven by the goal to empower communities. As the Founder & CEO, my journey has been one of transformation and resilience. Growing up, I faced academic difficulties and battled my own demons. At a young age, I was arrested for violence and bullying, reflecting the struggles around me. üí™ Determined to break free from these challenges, I pledged to change my life after losing my mother in 2003. Overcoming deep depression and social isolation, I found strength in a supportive peer group that taught us to express our feelings. This marked the first step in my year of resilience. üå± After seeking therapy, I became part of a passionate movement addressing our community's needs. I learned to advocate for change, starting locally and scaling to a national level. Alongside fellow young adults, I formed an advisory board that raised a powerful voice for neglected youth. This led to the birth of a national nonprofit dedicated to fighting for system change and youth empowerment. ‚ú® Over the last seventeen years, I've actively volunteered, serving on committees, advisory boards, and advocating for meaningful change. In 2020, I founded Change Me Foundation with a vision of putting community lives first. We stand as a voice for individuals, families, and seniors, striving to enhance everyone's quality of life by connecting them with vital services. ü§ù As the CEO of Change Me Foundation, I extend a heartfelt welcome to you. Join us on this journey of transformation, empowerment, and lasting impact.

Generally speaking, compared with women, men are really bad at asking for any help. Really bad. Statistically, at least 40% of us don't ask for help when we really need it, particularly with respect to anything mental health related. We don‚Äôt ask for help because either we are too embarrassed or due to the false negative perception around asking for help. One of the biggest barriers to men asking for help is 'conditioning.' The conditioning starts at a young age and comes from our educational systems, playing sports, observing other men, watching films, etc. Conditioning comes from reinforcing perceptions around how we should behave or perform. The rationale behind it is that through conditioning, asking for help makes us somehow inferior or less of a man. The other factor is 'fear.' Fear is, for many of us, a lifelong companion and the paradox of masculinity. I acknowledge my fear. There is also a lot of fear due to a lack of understanding generally around Alzheimer‚Äôs, either as someone diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs or a partner, relative or friend supporting someone with the disease. Talking to others does help, and we need to be reminded that emotions aren't gendered. I actively encourage anyone in need to ask for help. Dementia UK has published my story today for International Men's Day with the intent of encouraging men to talk, particularly those with a loved one suffering from Alzheimer's. My experience with Dementia UK was transformational at my family's time of need. Check out this personal story: https://lnkd.in/eVNCB7JW My Mum, Anthea, was a devoted wife and mother and had a deep love for people. She spent a lifetime helping others, particularly those fleeing war, and through her life supported a variety of charities. Supporting Dementia UK is my way of honouring her life, and I am really pleased to be part of their current campaign today. I hope my story and post today will encourage men I am connected to to ask for help when needed or encourage a friend, spouse or partner to encourage the man in their life to ask for help if needed. #internationalmensday2023 #equality #diversity #inclusion #internationalmensday"
