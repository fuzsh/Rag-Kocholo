        "text": "TOH-er ordained deacon\n\nMatthew Crawford SM was ordained to the diaconate in a ceremony in Auckland cathedral, NZ, on Dec 13.\n\nMatthew is a member of the New Zealand Marist province and was a participant in the Marist Mission Centre sponsored 'The Other Half' journey of 2005-06.\n\nMany Australians know Matthew from his time at novitiate at Ermington, NSW, in 2004. After two years of cross-cultural experience in Mexico and completion of theology studies in Auckland, Matthew will now take up a posting at St Mary of the Angel's, Wellington.\n\nRight, above: Matthew with Marist provincial, Fr Brian Cummings SM and Bishop Robin Leamy SM.\n\nRight, lower: With Australian Fr Tony Kennedy SM, seminary rector for 2009.\n\nYoung Aussies visit Ranong Mission\n\nSix members of the Catholic Asian Students Society leave Sydney on Dec 12 to visit the Marist Mission at Ranong, southern Thailand, as part of a three week exposure experience in Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nLeader of the group and former CASS president, Clement Cheung, was himself a member of 'The Other Half' group sponsored by the Marist Mission Centre in 2006-07. He is accompanied by his sister, Gladys, and four other CASS colleagues\n\nMMC celebrates a million dollar year\n\nAs Christmas approaches the Marist Mission Centre, Hunters Hill, celebrates the end of a very successful year.\n\nAt a function on Dec 08 MMC director, Fr Kevin Stewart SM, thanked the team of staff, volunteers and supporters for such a fruitful year despite the economic downturn internationally.\n\nOver $1,000,000 was sent to development projects throughout Asia-Pacific and to the Marist missions worldwide\n\n.\n\nTypical of projects supported by MMC is Guangzhou Huiling, China. Huiling means 'wisdom' and 'soul' and expresses commitment to help persons with mental disabilities to have a thinking mind and a loving heart.\n\nHuiling was born as a simple shelter for mentally disabled persons. Now it includes various types of service and accepts people with mental disabilities of any age and social condition. Guangzhou Huiling looks after more than 200 persons with mental disabilities spread in various centers and a dozen family homes.\n\nClick here for more on this and other MMC projects.\n\nBr Pat resting at Tutu\n\nAustralian Marist, Br Patrick Thomson SM, laboured for over sixty years in the Pacific before his death on Taveuni, Fiji, in 2007.\n\nBr Pat pioneered young farmer training in Bougainville before joining the formation community at Tutu. In his latter years he taught the art of rosary making to Marist novices and other confreres.\n\nPhotos of Br Pat's resting place have recently become available to our web site."
