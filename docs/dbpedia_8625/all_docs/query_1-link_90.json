        "text": "I begin by greeting everyone in the languages of the realm of New Zealand, in English, Māori, Cook Island Māori, Niuean, Tokelauan and New Zealand Sign Language. Greetings, Kia Ora, Kia Orana, Fakalofa Lahi Atu, Taloha Ni and as it is the morning (Sign)\n\nI then specifically greet you: Most Rev Robin Leamy, Assistant Bishop and Vicar-General in the Diocese of Auckland; Father Paul Farmer, Parish Priest of St Benedict’s; Sister Colleen Keeble, Congregational Leader of the Sisters of St Joseph; Richard Hurley, Chair of the Parish Finance Council; Distinguished Guests otherwise; Ladies and Gentlemen.\n\nThank you for inviting me and my wife Susan to attend Mass and this luncheon to celebrate the canonisation on 17 October (49 days ago) of the Blessed Mary MacKillop as St Mary of the Cross (MacKillop), becoming the first saint from this part of the world in Australia or New Zealand.\n\nI would like to say a few words about the significance of the Canonisation and particularly for St Benedict’s.\n\nIn the weeks before and after Mary MacKillop’s canonisation, I was happy to receive a number of requests to attend celebratory events. I deliberately chose to accept the invitation here because of being aware that Sister Mary McKillop as she was had a strong connection with this church parish and community. It is also the Church in Auckland in which I often attend Mass either at 9.30 or at 5.30 in the crypt, when living nearby in Government House Auckland.\n\nWhile Mary Helen MacKillop was born in Victoria Australia in 1842 and spent much of her life in that country, she travelled widely maintaining strong connections in New Zealand, visiting here four times before her death in 1909. Those visits were not fleeting, but sometimes lasting several months, and one occasion, for more than a year. She did not enjoy good health during much of her life, but found the New Zealand climate conducive.\n\nIn 1883, three nuns from Australia established the Order in Temuka and soon after there developed communities of nuns in a number of places in New Zealand. One of those places where she lived and worshipped was with the community of St Benedict’s here in Newton, which I understand had been established by Benedictine monks from Britain in 1879.\n\nShe came here because in 1881, the Abbott, who had lived in South Australia and knew of her Order, wrote asking her to send sisters to establish a school. The sisters duly arrived in 1884 and through the school across the road, maintained a direct connection with this parish until closure almost a century later when the buildings were demolished.\n\nMary MacKillop died 101 years ago, but even so, the Order that she founded continues to be active in New Zealand, with a focus on addressing social, pastoral and educational needs of the community, and with a particular focus on children and families. I remember well as an Aucklander growing up in a Catholic family in Ponsonby and later Glen Innes, seeing Sisters of the Order as they went about their work in their characteristic “brown joe” habits – partly because Father – later Monsignor Hyde the parish priest was a friend and colleague of my father’s.\n\nThere are a number of messages that can be drawn from the new saint’s life and teachings. The first is the respect and dignity that should be shown for all humanity. She was a humble person with an innate respect for human dignity, which she regarded as more important than strict observance of rules. She never lost sight of her mission and that of her Order being to help the poor, unemployed and needy.\n\nThe second message is the transformative power of education. She saw in education the means to help the poor out of poverty and the means to change society more widely for the better. To that end, she established training colleges to ensure that her Sisters could provide their students with the best possible education.\n\nAs I have noted, she created a number of schools including that which sat across from this church for many years. It reminds us all that the most important gift that a parent, a family, a community or a nation can give to its children and young people is a good education.\n\nA third message that can be drawn is the importance of practical service to others, best summarised in the new saint saying “never see a need without doing something about it.” Few of us receive the call to devote ourselves as selflessly to others as St Mary did. Her life, however, shows we can all make a difference through voluntary service be it to professional organisations, sporting or community groups, charitable organisations, schools or hospitals.\n\nAs one who has attended St Ben’s on many occasions, I am keenly aware of the vibrant community life within this Parish, and particularly its attractiveness to young people. All of this work relies on a significant voluntary contribution.\n\nIn conclusion, St Mary MacKillop’s life remains an inspiration. While many Catholics will pray to her seeking intercession, words of hers which I will now quote could be said to give the finest instruction to all seeking help. As she wrote in one of her last letters in 1909: “Whatever troubles maybe before you, accept them cheerfully, remembering whom you are trying to follow. Do not be afraid. Love one another, bear with one another, and let charity guide you in all your life.”\n\nAnd on a note reflecting a remarkable person, I will close in New Zealand’s first language Māori, offering everyone present this morning, greetings and wishing everyone all good health and fortitude in your endeavours.\n\nNo reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, kia ora, kia kaha, tēnā koutou katoa."
