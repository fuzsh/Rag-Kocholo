        "text": "OTTAWA -- The Ottawa Senators have traded goalie Ben Bishop to the Tampa Bay Lightning for rookie centre Cory Conacher and fourth-round pick, according to multiple media reports.\n\nThe 26-year-old Bishop was acquired by Ottawa from the St. Louis Blues last season in exchange for a second-round pick.\n\nOttawa had a crowded crease this season with Bishop, No. 1 goalie Craig Anderson and rising star Robin Lehner all seeing action.\n\nAnderson suffered an ankle injury early in February, forcing both Bishop and Lehner to shoulder the load.\n\nBut with Anderson set to return, Bishop was the odd man out.\n\nThe six-foot-seven Bishop, who will be a restricted free agent this summer, has an 8-5-0 record in 2013 to go along with a 2.45 goals-against average and .922 save percentage.\n\nConacher, 23, has nine goals and 15 assists in 35 games this season with the Tampa Bay. He becomes the Senators' leading scorer, ahead of forward Kyle Turris and defenceman Sergei Gonchar (22 points each)."
