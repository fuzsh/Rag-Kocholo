The Hospital of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Philadelphia formally opened on Saturday, December 11, 1852, but it was not until Christmas Eve that any call was made for its services. The idea of opening a hospital began under the auspices of Bishop Potter. Alonzo Potter (1800-1865) was an American bishop of the Episcopal Church who served as the third bishop of the Diocese of Pennsylvania. He was baptized in St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia & was confirmed by Bishop White. In Philadelphia, he gave instruction to \"colored persons,\" which may have foreshadowed his later concern as a bishop for \"equal rights and opportunities. .to all sorts and conditions of men.\" Potter responded to an appeal from Dr. Caspar Morris, a Philadelphia physician, for a church hospital. The effort was helped immensely by the daughters of the deceased John Leamy (1757-1839), an Irish-born American merchant who pioneered Philadelphia's trade with the Spanish colonies in the Americas. As an active Roman Catholic, he helped fund the construction of St. Augustine Church, was a trustee at St. Mary's, and there participated in the Hogan schism. However, according to Catholic history & baptismal records of St. Joseph's Church: \"his children became Episcopalians. and bitterly opposed to Catholicity.\" After Leamy's death, two of his daughters, Anna (baptised August 22, 1800) and Elizabeth Harriet (baptised June 24, 1802) donated their father's family estate to the establishment of the Episcopal Hospital. Leamy built the estate on the corner of Front Street and Lehigh Avenue in Kensington, Philadelphia, PA, which he named Tusculum. Anna & Elizabeth gifted the estate, along with six acres of land, to the hospital's cause after hearing Bishop Potter preach. There is a albumen photo in this work of the \"Leamy Mansion.\" Quite scarce with all plates and albumen photos. American Mid-Atlantic History.
