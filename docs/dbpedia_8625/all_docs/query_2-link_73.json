Mullin with Andrew Campbell, Katie Hanlon and Rachel Tuffy of NCAD Dublin.\n\nWinner:\n\nTiarnan O’Machair, BA Textile and Surface Design\n\nTiarnan’s collection of constructed fashion fabrics Killery was inspired by 16th and 17th century Irish metal work, leathers and textiles such as the surprisingly sophisticated plaid and tweed of the Killery ensemble which was discovered in a bog. Rusting metals, plaster casts, matted hair, and buried fabrics were used to create 3d sketches which reinterpret their aesthetic qualities. He combines traditional techniques and experimental approaches, using unconventional materials including human hair and latex, to merge the resilience of the past with a reimagined urban sensibility, resulting in unusual weaves and knits.\n\nOur Textile Design Prize at Belfast School of Art was inaugurated in 2019 following the showing of the AUB touring exhibition Lucienne Day: Living Design at Coach House, Dublin Castle.\n\nThe 2024 award was adjudicated by our Trustee Mary V. Mullin with Trish Belford and Professor Barbara Diss of Belfast School of Art.\n\nWinner:\n\nAlma Conway, BA (Hons) Textile Art, Design and Fashion\n\nAlma’s collection Miscellany showcases hand-dyed and printed fabrics, honouring traditional techniques while incorporating digital tools with shibiori-inspired patterns.

He explored the utilisation of plant-based materials to create products that require a minimal amount of new infrastructure and extraction whilst not taking up valuable agricultural land for specialised crops. This led to experimenting with agricultural waste, using spent solid material from anaerobic digesters to build with the compost-like fibre. The future for this project is to push what forms can be made and moulded with this material.\n\nSee Sean’s work here.\n\nOur Textile Design Prize at AUB was inaugurated in 2017 as part of our collaboration with AUB on the exhibition Lucienne Day: Living Design at The Gallery, AUB.\n\nThe award was adjudicated by our trustee Mary V.

Mullin with Paul Leamy, Head of Department, ATU Connemara, School of Design and Creative Arts.\n\nNeil’s design Podium is a set of end tables designed in response to the EU legislation in progress ‘Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation’. The three materials used – biodegradable linoleum and cotton, plus fully recyclable glass – are assembled without the use of adhesives, allowing ease of separation at the products’ end of life. Each Podium consists of two layers of linoleum placed back-to-back to form an enclosed loop. The shape is achieved by using the flexibility and structural properties inherent in linoleum in combination with the tension created from hand sewing the material together against two pieces of toughened glass, which sit in rebates cut into the linoleum. Linoleum off-cuts are a by-product of the flooring industry.\n\nRobin and Lucienne Day both studied at the Royal College of Art, where they met in March 1940.

Growing up on Jersey, Bethany has witnessed the increase in oceanic plastic pollution washing up on beaches. Single-use polystyrene packaging is not currently accepted by recycling facilities in the UK; Bethany has discovered a process which transforms it into a mouldable consistency which can be stretched, twisted, re-shaped and textured into any design before it dries, transforming it into a useful material.\n\nInnovative and focused on practical solutions to environmental issues, Bethany’s beautifully presented WIP project was considered to best meet our awards criteria, which are based on Robin and Lucienne Day’s own design practise.\n\nSee Bethany’s work here.\n\nOur annual Textile Design Prize for an AUB Textiles graduate was established in 2017 as part of our collaboration with AUB on the exhibition Lucienne Day: Living Design, which launched at The Gallery, AUB that year.\n\nThe Award was adjudicated by our Trustee Mary V.

The collection considers the notion that in embracing the blues, we can become more resilient to deeper feelings of despair. Just like the tides, the blues come in waves.\n\nOur Textiles Prize at The Belfast School of Art was inaugurated in 2019, following the showing of the AUB touring exhibition Lucienne Day: Living Design at the FE McWilliam Gallery, Northern Ireland.\n\nIn 2021 the entries were submitted and judged online by Duncan Neil, Design Director of Irish Linen company William Clark and Son Ltd, and our Trustee Mary V.
