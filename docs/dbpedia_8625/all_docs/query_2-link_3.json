        "text": "Robin Leamy was born in Samoa (then Western Samoa) as a New Zealand citizen but came to the United States in 1974 with his family. He started out in high school as a water polo player but soon became a fast sprint freestyler. Leamy attended UCLA where he helped the Bruins win the 1982 NCAA team title. He helped the US win international gold medals in the 4x100 free relay for three consecutive years, in 1982 at the World Championships, in 1983 at the Pan American Games, and in 1984 at the Los Angeles Olympics. At the 1981 US Nationals, Leamy broke the world record for the 50 metre freestyle, a record that lasted for almost four years. He had also helped the US set a world record in the 4x100 free at the 1982 Worlds.\n\nLeamy eventually earned an MBA at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management. He then joined Grubb & Ellis in Orange County, California, a real estate firm, but soon left for a start-up realty firm, Langdon Rieder, where he was a vice-president. It was there that he discovered his niche, which was locating office space for corporations. Coldwell Banker acquired Langdon Rieder and Leamy left for Mohr Partners in Northern California, but in 2010 started his own company, Leamy Realty Group."
