FORMER Slovak PM Mikulas Dzurinda, who served as the country's prime minister from 1998 to 2006, said he was leaving office with a clear conscience.

According to Dzurinda, Slovakia is in better shape than it was eight years ago.

"Slovakia is a peaceful, nice country. There is no ethnic tension or animosities. There is not so much hatred here as there was some years ago. Slovakia has a civic, pluralist society with a stable economy and democracy. I think that we have sown our seeds well," Dzurinda said.
