        "text": "I spent many years in politics and women have been playing a very important role in my two governments, but also in my political party. Gender equality is one of the research priorities of the think tank I lead. Lately, I have been impressed by the great bravery and courage of the Belarusian women, who took over the fight for democracy and a better future, instead their imprisoned husbands, sons and brothers. This is a great example that women should have the same rights and opportunities to shape our common future wherever in the world. To achieve such a goal, still a lot must be done. We need to focus on education, quality childcare and healthcare. Focusing on these areas will not only overcome gender stereotypes but will also encourage women to be even more presented in politics."
