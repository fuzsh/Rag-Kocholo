        "text": "Convincing five-and-a-half million Slovaks to vote in favour of joining the European Union when 70% of them have already made it clear that is precisely what they intend to do is not most people’s idea of a Herculean task.\n\nBut despite that, not everyone feels the man who has been given this particular sinecure, Slovakia’s Deputy Prime Minister Pál Csáky, is doing the job properly.\n\n“I have two problems with the referendum campaign here,” complains Vladimír Bilcík, a senior analyst with the Bratislava-based Slovak Foreign Policy Association (SFPA).\n\n“I think it has been launched too late and that it has only focused on mobilizing people to vote, not on the debate surrounding our country’s membership of the EU. That is not only Csáky’s fault. He is carrying out government policy. But as deputy prime minister and the man in charge of promoting the referendum, he must take some of the blame,” Bilcík adds.\n\nThe SFPA analyst is not the only person who thinks Csáky has handled the pre-referendum campaign badly.\n\nThe populist opposition party Smer (meaning ‘direction’) recently called for him to be sacked. The party argued that the two-week campaign planned ahead of the referendum, taking place tomorrow and Saturday (16-17 May), was too short and did not address the issues underlying Slovakia’s future EU membership.\n\n“We ask Prime Minister Mikulás Dzurinda to propose the recall [from his post] of Deputy PM Csáky because his office is failing in tasks for which it is responsible, with respect to Slovakia’s strategic goal to enter the EU,” an angry Robert Fico, Smer chairman, said in March.\n\nEven members of Csáky’s own centre-right coalition government have suggested the campaign should have been longer.\n\nSpeaking in March, Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan said he felt 14 days was not enough time to explain the issues to voters.\n\n“I think it will be necessary to work more intensively, not only during those 14 days, but, let’s say, starting right now,” he argued.\n\nThe big worry for the pro-EU camp in Slovakia is not that there will be a ‘no’ vote in the referendum but that turnout will be so low that the poll will be invalid.\n\nUnder Slovak law at least 50% of voters must cast their ballots for a referendum result to be legally binding. And the country’s record thus far has not been good.\n\nSlovakia has held four referenda since its 1993 ‘velvet divorce’ with the Czech Republic and not one of those polls achieved the required turnout.\n\n“Sure, those referenda were about less exciting issues like privatizing state enterprises, but the question of a low turnout is nevertheless a serious one,” warns Bilcík.\n\nThe Greek government, which currently holds the EU’s six-month rotating presidency, is also worried about voter apathy in Slovakia’s EU poll. Greece’s ambassador to Slovakia, Efstathios Daras, recently warned that there was “a risk that people would prefer to go fishing than to the referendum”.\n\nEnlargement Commissioner Günter Verheugen for his part raised the low turnout question during a whirlwind pre-referendum visit to Bratislava last week (5-6 May). “If you fail to attend the referendum, others will make the decisions for you,” he cautioned Slovak voters.\n\nBut despite all of the warnings and criticisms, Csáky himself remains confident that he has taken the right approach to the referendum campaign.\n\n“Why should I lose sleep if some fans go to an empty stadium at 15.30 and start shouting that the captain should be changed because no goal has been scored, when the match doesn’t start until 16.00? That’s not my problem,” he said in a recent newspaper interview.\n\nBéla Bugar, leader of Slovakia’s Hungarian Coalition Party (SMK), also rounded on Csáky’s detractors recently. Defending his party colleague – Csáky is SMK deputy leader – Bugar said, “only those who do nothing, do nothing wrong”.\n\nOther experts also argue that the deputy prime minister’s decision to opt for a short, sharp, pre-referendum campaign was the right one.\n\n“There was a long campaign in Hungary and I don’t think you can say the result there was particularly impressive,” says one well-placed Slovak analyst. Hungary voted in favour of joining the EU on April 12, but the turnout was only 46%.\n\nThe Slovak campaign features huge billboards plastered all over the country bearing slogans such as “Don’t Leave it Up to Others”, along with a series of TV advertisements in which national celebrities urge their fellow citizens to turn up to the polls.\n\nThe government paid advertising agencies Creo/Young Rubicon and Monarch more than €700,000 to help sell its ‘get out and vote’ message, but not everyone is convinced by their efforts.\n\n“I guess you’d have to ask a sociologist if this is really the right approach. Personally I think the advertisements are silly,” says Bilcík.\n\n“You get a famous ice-hockey player saying he will vote in the referendum and that’s supposed to make you want to do the same,” he continues, adding: “I am going to vote for EU membership but not because the ice-hockey player told me to.”\n\nCsáky’s decision to opt for a last-minute campaign has also fuelled criticisms that he is not committed to his job in general.\n\nEyebrows were first raised on this score shortly after last year’s general elections in Slovakia.\n\nWhen Csáky was re-appointed deputy prime minister he announced that he no longer wanted to take responsibility for trying to improve the lot of Slovakia’s persecuted Roma population – one of the country’s hottest political potatoes.\n\nCsáky argued he would not have the time to give the Roma question the attention it deserved and tried to transfer the dossier to the culture ministry.\n\nBut many Slovaks perceived the move as a bid to shirk his responsibilities. “His official job title was deputy prime minister with responsibility for European integration, human rights and minorities so trying to get rid of the Roma dossier was not well received,” says one observer.\n\nIn the end, Csáky kept responsibility for the Roma question and soon had to deal with a major crisis when a coalition of human rights groups published a report alleging Roma women living in eastern Slovakia had been forcibly sterilized.\n\nHe adopted a hard line approach to the criticisms, saying he would sue the report’s authors. If the allegations were untrue they were libellous, he argued; if they were correct then the groups had failed to inform the proper authorities.\n\nCsáky has taken an equally feisty approach in his dealings with the European Union’s current member states, refusing to play the role of a grovelling wannabe begging for a place at the Union’s top table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe thinks the EU is in urgent need of reform and has not held back in saying so.\n\nThe Union “must reform its central institutions if Europe is to remain competitive in the global market,” he said in a recent interview with the UK’s BBC.\n\nHe also believes that the EU must do more to forge common policies on issues such as the economy, defence and foreign affairs. But unsurprisingly for an ethnic Hungarian who has spent most of his political life fighting for the rights of fellow members of his minority, he also favours the development of a strongly decentralized EU.\n\n“The ethnic and linguistic diversity of Europe is crucial for the region’s creativity,” he said recently.\n\nWhen Csáky is not working, the married father of four likes to get out and about. He is apparently a keen rambler and also enjoys swimming.\n\nPerhaps he should take a dip on referendum day and try to persuade some of those Slovak fishermen to pack up their rods and head for the poll booths.\n\nAdvertisement"
