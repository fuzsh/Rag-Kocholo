        "text": "Dzurinda’s announcement hit the squabbling and muddled Slovak political scene like a bombshell. But he had almost no alternative following the failure late last year of his attempts to mould a single party from the loose grouping of five political factions, the Slovak Democratic Coalition (SDK), which propelled him into power in September 1998.\n\nThat ploy was always likely to fall foul of powerful counter currents which want the factions to reassert their separate identities, with only the weakest of links holding them together.\n\nAs well as providing Dzurinda with a much-needed party power- base, the launch of his new Slovak Democratic and Christian Union (SDKU) is also a stinging retort to mounting criticism that he is hemmed in by coalition politics and lacks the authority as leader needed to take difficult decisions.\n\nDzurinda, 45, has taken a pack of leading politicians to the new party with him, including the respected Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan and the ministers for culture, health, and home affairs. Estimates of how many of the SDK’s 42 members of parliament will follow vary from around 50% to just over half a dozen.\n\nPowerful faction leaders did not heed the initial call, most notably the Christian Democrat leader Jan Carnogursky and Democratic Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Miklos. The response from the other parties in the government coalition has been muted but no one has yet emerged who could challenge Dzurinda’s position as premier.\n\nHis move has nevertheless been interpreted as a sign of weakness rather than strength, exposing the poor hand he has been dealt.\n\nThe five separate centre-right parties which buried their differences to form the SDK in May 1998 with Dzurinda as leader were held together by one principal aim: to defeat the controversial nationalist left-leaning government led by ex-boxer Vladimir Meciar.\n\nDzurinda’s folksy election campaign, in which he toured the country on a bicycle, sometimes being pelted by fruit and vegetables in hostile territory, helped the SDK to win 26.3% of the vote in the September poll, just behind Meciar’s 27%. The SDK, together with party allies the reformed Communists, Hungarian SMK and Party of Civic Understanding (SOP) in the anti-Meciar coalition, secured 58% of votes and 93 seats in the 150-seat parliament.\n\nWhile Dzurinda, who only entered politics after the 1989 Velvet Revolution which toppled Czechoslovakia’s Communists, was a credible enough match for Meciar, the decision to make him SDK election frontman even though he was not even a leader of one of its constituent parties was the result of a tactical compromise. The existing party chiefs did not want to abandon their posts and power bases, so Dzurinda got the job.\n\nThe timing of his announcement on 17 January this year that he intended to go it alone could have been better timed from the EU’s point of view. On his first official visit to Bratislava three days later, European Commission President Romano Prodi, accompanied by Enlargement Commissioner Günter Verheugen, had to side-step a barrage of questions on what all this meant for Slovakia’s attempts to catch up with its neighbours in the race to join the Union.\n\nObservers in Brussels and Bratislava are still trying to work out whether Dzurinda’s risky political gambit will pay off by offering more stability or increase the chances of early elections which would certainly hamper Slovakia’s drive for EU membership.\n\nThose in Brussels complain that the internal kitchen of Slovak politics is difficult to fathom at the best of times and becomes almost incomprehensible at the worst. There is also clear concern that opposition leader Meciar, whose undemocratic policies in power barred Slovakia from winning a seat at the accession negotiating table, might somehow take advantage of the situation and become prime minister for a fourth time. “Meciar’s party has around 30% of voting intentions in the polls and unemployment in Slovakia is now the highest in Europe,” said one Union official.\n\nDzurinda’s popularity slipped to around 14% last October after he was forced to sack two close allies, the ministers for telecommunications and the economy, following scandals.\n\nHowever, some political analysts say the growing shadow of Meciar, who is threatening a referendum campaign for early elections, makes it less and less likely that the centre-right parties in the coalition will risk dumping Dzurinda or destroy the SDK before it runs its term. That would probably result in premature polls or the premiership being handed to the second largest party, the reformed Communists.\n\nSince he took power, Dzurinda’s early popularity has faded fast.\n\nHe still lives in a panelak, one of the Communist-era pre-fabricated concrete apartment blocs which seemingly lay siege to large Slovak cities, but has moved from a sprawling estate to a site nearer the centre of Bratislava.\n\nHis family background is modest. His parents were teachers, but his father was kicked out of his job by the Communists and forced to take up manual work on the railways.\n\nBefore power beckoned in the mid-1990s, Dzurinda – a Frank Zappa look-alike who resembles the musician – sported a long mane of hair and a trendy, but ill-assorted wardrobe of clothes. Now, the hair is short and his suits conventional. Marathons, apart from coalitions negotiations, are also a rarity these days.\n\nWhile the fight against corruption and an attack on cronyism were the main campaign cries in the 1998 election which brought Dzurinda into office, his own government team appears to have done little better.\n\nSwingeing austerity measures have been imposed and price controls on essential products removed after ministers discovered Meciar’s free spending had left the treasury coffers bare and the hoped-for – and much-needed – inflow of foreign capital failed to materialise last year.\n\nDzurinda is one of those politicians who have consistently cut a better figure abroad than at home. He has pulled off political coups, such as meeting US President Bill Clinton and addressing Congress (although Clinton refused to go jogging with him), and was rewarded for months of shuttle diplomacy across Europe at the EU’s Helsinki summit in December by winning an invitation to join the enlargement negotiations.\n\nCritics say that most of this Union courtship demanded little of Slovakia and could have almost been done on auto-pilot. However, the passing of a new language law aimed at giving the country’s substantial Hungarian minority a better deal almost broke the coalition.\n\nUnlike some of his government colleagues, Dzurinda has made a point of bringing the Hungarian party into power. He himself hails from the Kosice region, which has a high proportion of Hungarians and is one of the most nationally varied parts of the country. In a half- serious move, the town of Kosice even considered declaring itself independent when Slovakia split from the Czech Republic in 1993.\n\nDzurinda, nicknamed the signalman because of his past specialisation in railway economics and stint with the state rail company, will soon find out if he has put himself on a steadier course or is heading for the buffers.\n\nBIO\n\n1955: Born in Spissky Stvrtok, Eastern Slovakia.\n\n1979: Graduated from Traffic and Communications University, Zilina, after specialising in railway economics."
