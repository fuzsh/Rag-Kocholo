        "text": "\"As it was the first bilateral visit of the prime minister of Slovakia to Prague after both countries became members of the EU it marks a new future, reinforcement of mutual relations between the two countries on the basis of membership of the EU.\n\n\"And the declaration both prime ministers signed today is proof that there is a strong willingness on both sides to continue and enhance bilateral relations.\"\n\nThey don't have the same interests: Slovakia has borders with some non-EU members and the Czech Republic doesn't - how do they join their interests?\n\n\"I think that there is a common interest because both countries together with all other new member countries of the EU want to join the Schengen area as soon as possible.\n\n\"Therefore it's also in our favour when our Slovak counterparts and others will complete the necessary measures on their external borders. And as was said today, work on that is well on track.\"\n\nIs it a common goal to join the Eurozone and Schengen?\n\n\"Well, when it comes to Schengen there is a kind of target date at the end of 2006 for the new member states. It's a date which was targeted within the EU.\n\n\"But when it comes to membership of the Euro, that to a certain extent is a different story because the most important prerequisite is the shape of the economy of individual countries.\n\n\"And they may be different starting positions and different speeds in which they try, or they are on the track to comply with the Maastricht criteria. I think that not necessarily all the new member states will adopt the Euro at the same time.\""
