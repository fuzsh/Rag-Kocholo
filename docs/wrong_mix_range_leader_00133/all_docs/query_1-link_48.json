        "text": "His departure was memorable. Vladimir Meciar, the outgoing Slovak premier, went on television and sang a tearful dirge to his people. \"Farewell, I leave you,\" he crooned, with tears in his eyes and a furrowed brow. \"I never did anything to hurt you ...\"\n\nA Bratislava DJ called Karol remixed his touching performance, and turned it into a dancefloor hit. We thought that was it - the authoritarian former boxer turned politician said he would now lead a life of solitude and the country was duly taken over by Mikulas Dzurinda, a former traffic engineer who, with a wide-ranging programme of reforms, started moving the country in the right direction.\n\nIn the past three years Slovakia - that small chunk of land with 5.4m citizens, sandwiched between Poland, Hungary, Ukraine and Czech Republic - has achieved something of a miraculous volte face. It has released itself from the shackles of Meciarism, and both Nato and the European Union have said entry dates for the country may soon be in sight.\n\nSuch news would have been unthinkable during the Meciar era, when the then US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went so far as to call the country the \"black hole of Europe\".\n\nSuddenly people have started to wake up to Slovakia. Its reputation as a country run by dodgy politicians may still stand, but it is also being seen for its other assets: good skiing, its Andy Warhol heritage, quality wines and supermodels. But the whole train of progress may be about to grind to a halt.\n\nMeciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) is performing consistently well in opinion polls, and has dominated as the most popular party for some time, running at around 29%. That's some way ahead of Dzurinda's Slovak Democratic and Christian Union party (SDKU), the biggest party in the governing coalition, which is scoring a mere 12%.\n\nFor his part, the bearish Meciar has remodelled himself as one of Slovakia's staunchest supporters of Nato, and of late one might well think he was being paid by the EU to advertise its benefits.\n\nHis customary gypsy-bashing appears to have ceased, and has turned his back on his previous isolationist views and suddenly become an enthusiastic advocate of globalisation.\n\nIs this the same man who, during his various terms of office from the country's foundation in 1993 to 1998, strong-armed the media, attacked Nato's bombing of Kosovo, ridiculed minorities, and supposedly deliberately ruined a referendum on joining Nato?\n\nHis privatisation policies - largely corrupt, and carried out to benefit cronies - still hurt the country to this day.\n\nIncidents which took place during his rule are still unsolved mysteries - the kidnapping of former president Michal Kovac's son, and the subsequent death of former policeman Robert Remias who was helping journalists investigate the incident. The man who carried out the kidnapping, Ivan Lexa, Meciar's secret service chief, has since disappeared. No one knows of his whereabouts.\n\nBut with his current \"conversion\" to modern, pro-western globalisationist, Meciar's voter base is growing considerably. So too is support in the population for joining Nato - at 50% from 30% not so long ago.\n\nMeciar is now the favourite to become prime minister after next summer's parliamentary elections.\n\nBut Nato's general secretary, George Robertson, and Gunther Verheugen, the EU's enlargement commissioner, have both heavily hinted that a HZDS-led Slovakia will be relegated to the back of the queue of those countries hoping to join their respective clubs. If Meciar succeeds, the whole of Slovakia will feel the pain.\n\nMany are now looking to Robert Fico, the country's most popular politician, who heads the Smer (Direction) party. He currently has 20% of the vote, and insists he will not form a coalition with a Meciar-led HZDS if invited to do so. If he did, it would mean curtains for him, politically, but some still fear the temptation may just prove too much for him.\n\nMeciar's answer then, he says, would be to link up with the Christian Democrats and the Democratic Left.\n\nFico, meanwhile, is playing his cards close to his chest. He has not totally ruled out negotiating with the HZDS, only with Meciar. But that is hardly likely to help Slovakia.\n\nEven a remodelled HZDS would find it difficult to prove it had changed before next September's decisive Nato accession conference in Prague, or upcoming meetings with the EU. The 40-year old populist - plus Slovak voters - hold the country's future in their hands."
