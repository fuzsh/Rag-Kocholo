        "text": "Round-up\n\nThe four times-married German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and his Green foreign minister Joschka Fischer, who’s also on Frau No 4, have apparently been banned from taking flights …\n\nMixed views on enlargement, but at least hookers are happy!\n\nMOST newspapers around Europe – and, indeed, the world – concentrate on enlargement’s afterglow, quite rightly focusing on the historic outcome of the Copenhagen summit.\n\nPaying homage to Joschka, the man who saved the Copenhagen summit\n\nIT DIDN’T matter how loudly they chanted or banged their bongo drums: the few hundred hardy souls who came to protest at the European summit were kept too far from the action to make any impression on the events that mattered.\n\nStill much to do to avoid ‘summit rotten’ in the state of Denmark\n\nSHORTLY before Denmark began its stint as EU president in July, European Voice predicted four major hurdles on the road to its number one objective – ensuring the Union’s expansion. These concerned money, Cyprus, Kaliningrad and the Nice Treaty.\n\nPoland fights to the wire for extra cash\n\nEUROPEAN reconciliation shouldn’t be done on the cheap.\n\nWhy membership talks don’t quite live up to the Copenhagen rhetoric\n\nHISTORIC, epoch-making, momentous…expect to read these words a lot in the days and weeks after the Copenhagen summit as journalists rifle through their thesauruses in search of suitably solemn ways to describe the importance of the EU’s biggest-ever enlargement.\n\nCherie may be down, but not as down as Polish men\n\nTHE United States may be about to launch a devastating attack on Iraq, the EU is set to admit ten new members from central and eastern Europe and famine stalks large swathes of southern and eastern Africa.\n\nAccession countries in danger of catching up with EU’s unsustainable policies, warns latest EEA report\n\nTHE 13 countries seeking accession to the European Union are making the same mistakes as existing member states by adopting “unsustainable” transport policies with too much emphasis on roads at the expense of rail.\n\nAlleged cronyism costs Polish four their jobs\n\nFOUR senior regional farm officials in Poland have lost their jobs following a European Commission probe into alleged cronyism.\n\nThe EU should think Turkey this Christmas\n\nTHE EU faces some tough decisions ahead of next week’s Copenhagen summit – with the pressure fully on.\n\nProdi appeals for ‘sense’ as candidates reject Euro 40bn deal\n\nJUST a week to go before the crucial enlargement summit in Copenhagen, tension is mounting among EU leaders after key member states and candidate countries rebuffed a financial deal proposed by the Danish EU presidency.\n\nHungary and Cyprus to lead way in raft of referenda for 2003\n\nCANDIDATE countries are set to stage a cascade of referendums on EU membership in the New Year with Cyprus and Hungary, the most pro-Europe nations among the ten ‘big bang’ invitees, leading the way.\n\nTough talks ahead over Euro 1bn sweetener for entrant countries\n\nDENMARKÕS EU presidency is bracing itself for two weeks of tough talking over its attempt to increase the amount of funding for new member states.\n\nSeven states queue up to join NATO as Czech Republic hosts historic summit\n\nVACLAV Havel is going out in style. Last weekend the Czech President lit a 15-metre pink neon heart in Prague Castle. For the next three months, it will send ‘beats’ of light across one of Europe’s most beautiful cities. According to Havel – due to step down in January – the light is a reminder of the pro-democracy ideals he proclaimed in December 1989.\n\nVerhofstadt unveils ‘third way’ in bid to woo Schröder\n\nGERHARD Schröder, the German chancellor, is being urged to back a ‘third way’ for the future of Europe that would strengthen the powers of the European Commission – and preferably ditch the idea of an EU president.\n\nEIB urged to ‘invest in rail, not roads’\n\nGREEN campaigners are calling on the European Investment Bank (EIB) to provide more money for rail and put less into road projects in the countries bidding for EU membership.\n\nSensitive issues (and body parts) at EU-Russia summit\n\nAS EU enlargement approaches, so do fears in candidate countries about what membership of the Union will actually mean.\n\nPutin visit may seal deal on Kaliningrad\n\nHOPES are high that the European Union will be able to settle its differences with Russia over its Baltic territory of Kaliningrad when President Vladimir Putin visits Brussels for a summit on Monday (11 November).\n\nHoly orders\n\nWHEN you know you’re doing God’s work, niggling little earthly concerns like self-doubt are just not a problem.\n\nEU contenders caught in the crossfire as US trade row looms\n\nCOUNTRIES hoping to join the European Union risk being caught in the diplomatic crossfire as a new transatlantic dispute threatens to explode.\n\nVIEWPOINT – Prospering in uncertain times\n\nPROFITABILITY at European private banks and wealth management institutions declined by an average of 34% during 2001. Overall, for wealthy investors around the world it was one of the worst years in recent memory, as declining equity markets cut the value of their net investment assets by 2.6 trillion euro.\n\nUEFA racism ‘inaction’ given red card\n\nMEPS have branded action by UEFA, European football’s governing body, to tackle the growing rise of racism in Europe as inadequate.\n\nWarsaw and Prague cool on farm deal but others give it cautious welcome\n\nDavid Cronin reports from the candidate countries’ mini-summit in Copenhagen\n\nBolkestein steps up war against CD pirates\n\nSINGLE Market Commissioner Frits Bolkestein is set to unveil a directive clamping down on the fraudsters who cost the EU music and film industry billions of euro each year."
