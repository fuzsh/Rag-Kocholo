The Future of NATO and the Enlargement of the Alliance UNITED STATES MEMBERSHIP IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established as an alliance of common defense among democratic and market oriented governments in North America and Western Europe on August 24, 1949, with the entry into force of the North Atlantic Treaty. Original members included the United States, Canada, and ten European countries emerging from the destruction of World War II (Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg, Iceland and Italy). Subsequently, the Alliance has been enlarged on four separate occasions--to include Greece and Turkey in 1952, the Federal Republic of Germany in 1955, Spain in 1982, and Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in 1999. NATO has been central to peace and stability in Europe for more than fifty years and provides the United States with an ongoing and direct leadership role in European security affairs. During the Cold War, NATO served as a bulwark against the threat of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellites. The U.S. strategic nuclear guarantee served as a deterrent to Soviet aggression, and U.S. conventional forces stationed in Europe, reaching over 300,000 at their peak, were evidence that the United States would meet its commitment to collective defense under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, NATO members have made significant cuts in their military forces, including a substantial reduction in U.S. forces stationed in Europe. Since 1991, NATO has shifted from its Cold War strategy of mounting a massive, static defense against a significant military threat from a single direction. Instead, NATO's 1991 Strategic Concept revised the strategy to provide mobile response to diverse and multi-directional risks to the North Atlantic area. The Committee welcomes Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's statement about NATO's continuing relevance that he provided in testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee on April 29, 2003. In explaining the continuing relevance of the Alliance and enduring transatlantic relationship, Secretary Powell stated that: For over half a century NATO was indispensable to security on both sides of the Atlantic. That has not changed. Today, the Alliance remains indispensable to our security, and to meeting the security challenges in a world of diverse threats, multiple challenges, and unprecedented opportunities. The Alliance remains crucial to the link that binds North America to Europe and Europe to North America. At the 1999 Washington Summit, the NATO allies approved a new Strategic Concept to ``equip the Alliance for the security challenges and opportunities of the 21st century and to guide its future political and military development.'' In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and NATO's subsequent decision to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, the allies ``approved a comprehensive package of measures, based on NATO's [1999] Strategic Concept, to strengthen our ability to meet the challenges to the security of our forces, populations and territory, from wherever they may come,'' including ``. . . the threat posed by terrorism and by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.'' And most recently, at the November 2002 Prague summit, NATO Heads of State committed the Alliance to transform NATO with new members, new capabilities and new relationships with its partners. The Alliance invited Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia to begin accession talks to join the Alliance and considered the membership of these seven countries as part of the Alliance's transforming role for the 21st century. The Alliance also defined part of its new mission as combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, matched by pledges to obtain the military capabilities to accomplish that mission. NATO first established a forum for constructive dialogue and cooperation with the Russian Federation in the Permanent Joint Council in 1997, and in 2002 established the NATO-Russia Council to provide a forum for strengthening peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic area, and where appropriate, consensus building, consultations and joint decisions. NATO has also forged a relationship with Ukraine in the NATO-Ukraine Commission. Within the guidelines of its Resolution of Ratification, as in 1998, the Committee supports these initiatives as a way to demonstrate the defensive and stabilizing intentions of NATO. Nonetheless, the core purpose of the Alliance must remain the defense of its members. In order to fulfill this purpose, the forces of Alliance members must remain capable of defending against a significant military threat, and all members of the Alliance must fully meet their commitments as defined at the Prague summit. During the Cold War, NATO played an important role. After two World Wars in the first half of the 20th century into which the United States was drawn, the close relationship among NATO members allowed countries to lay aside historical grievances and develop democratic traditions and market economies to the enormous benefit of themselves, their neighbors, and the United States. Under NATO's security umbrella, old enemies have not only been reconciled but now stand side by side as allies; national defense policies are coordinated; and, on a daily basis, consultation, joint planning, joint training and cooperation reinforce the trust and commitment to common principles that are the very essence of the Alliance. As Poland and Germany, and Hungary and Romania, and several other former antagonists in Central and Eastern Europe build constructive, friendly relations in the post-Cold War era, the stabilizing influence of NATO membership, and potential membership, is illustrated yet again. The defensive nature of the Alliance, the democratic nature of its decision-making, and membership based not upon force of arms or coercion, but the willing choice of democratic governments, are the central reasons that association with the Alliance, and even membership, is a foreign policy priority for many European nations previously denied the rights of self-determination, freedom, and democracy. And for this reason, no country in Europe, with the exception of Belarus, has objected to the enlargement of the Alliance. Russia appears to accept enlargement as inevitable and has put NATO-Russia and U.S.- Russia relations in a broader context rather than making enlargement a focal point as it did in the 1990s. In December 2001, NATO and Russian Foreign Ministers announced their intention to create a NATO-Russia Council, on the principle of ``NATO at 20.'' In May 2002, NATO and Russian leaders meeting in Rome signed the ``NATO at 20'' agreement, in which Russia and NATO members participate as equals on certain issues. This new body replaces the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. With NATO's continued importance to European stability, and a new mission, as defined in Prague, to combat terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, matched by pledges to obtain the military capabilities to accomplish that mission, as in 1998, the Committee supports a continued United States commitment to, and leadership of, NATO. The Committee welcomes the strategic rationale for NATO that was provided by Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman in testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee on April 8, 2003. In explaining the continuing relevance and purpose of the Alliance, and in referring to comments earlier in the hearing by Senators Lugar and Biden, Secretary Grossman stated that: NATO [is] the central organizing agent for transatlantic cooperation. It represents, as you both said, not just a military alliance, but a political- military alliance, a community of common values and shared commitments to democracy, free markets and the rule of law. NATO is key to the defense of the United States, and so therefore, as you both said, NATO must continue to lead and to adapt. [The] NATO Prague summit launched a transformation of NATO with a three-part agenda: new members, new capabilities and new relationships. The job you've given me today, Senator, is to discuss enlargement, which is key to that transformation. THE STRATEGIC RATIONALE FOR NATO ENLARGEMENT Notwithstanding the collapse of communism in most of Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States and its allies face continuing threats to their stability and territorial integrity, including the potential, if lessened threat of the emergence of a hegemonic power in or around Europe, conflict stemming from ethnic and religious enmity, the revival of historic disputes, or the actions of undemocratic leaders. Furthermore, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, DC heightened NATO's awareness of emerging capabilities to use and deliver weapons of mass destruction, as well as transnational threats such as terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime that threaten both the new and old democracies in the transatlantic region. By providing a defense against many of these threats, NATO membership for Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia will expand the area in Europe where peace and democracy are not only present, but secure. Through much of its history, Europe has seen many insecure and small powers, a few great powers, and far too many nationalist defense policies--a dangerous catalyst for collusion and conflagration. Twice in the last century these dynamics have pulled the United States into conflict on the European continent. With the enlargement of NATO, the United States and its allies have an opportunity to build a more stable Europe, to lock in that stability, and to replace the dynamics of confrontation and conflict with trust and cooperation. NATO membership will extend to Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia the institutions, practices, and traditions that have made NATO an effective military alliance for the last half century. This structure has proven that vital U.S. interests in Europe can be guaranteed by a stable architecture of security and cooperation based upon a common commitment to the defense of democracy. The Committee finds that the accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia to NATO will make the Alliance stronger and more cohesive. Each of the seven countries is an established democracy with a growing market economy. Each shares the commitment to democracy that unites the transatlantic community. Their militaries are firmly under civilian control. In addition, these seven countries have proven themselves ready to bear a share of the burden in support of American and Allied interests beyond their borders. Each has contributed to the peacekeeping missions in the Balkans, and more recently, contributed to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom. All seven have contributed to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan and have pledged contributions for post- conflict reconstruction of Iraq. NATO enlargement is not a reaction to any single event or threat; rather it is a strategic opportunity for the expansion of a zone of peace and democracy in a continent that is of vital interest to the United States. As in 1998, the view of the Committee is that this is the best way to minimize the possibility that U.S. troops will be called upon again to fight in a major war in Europe. The invasion or military destabilization of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia would threaten the stability of Europe, jeopardize vital United Sates national security interests, and would quite likely lead to the engagement of United States forces. NATO enlargement is a prudent step to ensure that this does not happen. NATO'S STRATEGIC CONCEPT The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and the subsequent disarray of the Russian military have significantly reduced any immediate, conventional threat to Western Europe and the United States. Consequently, in 1991, NATO members agreed to their first Strategic Concept, reiterating the central importance of collective defense to the Alliance, but also noting that, with the emergence of independent democratic states in Central Europe, ``the political division of Europe that was the source of the military confrontation of the Cold War period has . . . been overcome.'' At the 1999 Washington Summit, the NATO allies approved a new Strategic Concept to ``equip the Alliance for the security challenges and opportunities of the 21st century and to guide its future political and military development.'' In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and NATO's subsequent decision to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, the allies ``approved a comprehensive package of measures, based on NATO's [1999] Strategic Concept, to strengthen our ability to meet the challenges to the security of our forces, populations and territory, from wherever they may come,'' including ``. . . the threat posed by terrorism and by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.'' The Committee Resolution of Ratification declares that, in order for NATO to serve the security interests of the United States, the core purpose of NATO must remain the collective defense of the territory of all Alliance members but NATO must develop the capabilities to go beyond the treaty area to combat weapons of mass production proliferation and terrorism if necessary. With that focus, the Committee supports the 1999 Strategic Concept's leaner approach to security for the post- Cold War environment, provided that NATO's forces become more mobile and capable for high intensity conflict beyond the Treaty area. The Committee supports the 1999 Strategic Concept's realistic force adjustments to meet new threats to the territory of NATO. The Committee considers some positional forces to have continued importance as an element of static defense, but emphasizes the importance of more mobile, expeditionary forces. As in 1998, the Committee Resolution of Ratification declares that as NATO develops forces with enhanced flexibility and mobility, it must continue to pursue defense planning, command structures, and force goals first and foremost to meet the requirements of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. The 1999 Strategic Concept continues to provide guidance for the development of detailed policies and military plans. It examines the Alliance's strategic perspectives in the light of the evolving strategic environment and security challenges and risks, and reconfirms the importance of the transatlantic link and of maintaining the Alliance's military capabilities, and examines the role of other key elements in the Alliance's broad approach to stability and security, namely the European Security and Defense Identity; conflict prevention and crisis management; partnership, cooperation and dialogue; enlargement; and arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation. But in keeping with the Kyl amendment of 1998, NATO should develop forces for high- intensity conflict to confront the threats of terrorism and proliferation. In 1998, Senator Kyl presented an amendment to the Resolution of Ratification for amendment of the North Atlantic Treaty to admit new countries to the Alliance. The amendment, which passed overwhelmingly, describes the principal threats to the Alliance as being the potential revival of a hostile Russia, ``rogue states and non-state actors'' that might develop weapons of mass destruction; terrorism; disruption of the flow of vital resources; and ethnic conflict. As in 1998, the Committee strongly advises the Executive Branch to consult extensively with the Senate before undertaking any interpretation, reinterpretation, expansion, or revision of NATO's 1999 Strategic Concept. Finally, as in 1998, the Committee finds that the Strategic Concept and burdensharing are inextricably linked. Because the United States is the leading military power in NATO and has force projection capabilities far superior to those of its allies, the costs associated with a mission to respond to diverse and multi-directional risks falls disproportionately upon the United States military. Active development of the Combined Joint Task Force concept, in which European forces would undertake some NATO missions on their own, with support from the United States, also will reduce the burden on the U.S. military. However, differences exist among Alliance members over the extent and purpose of such missions, and there is some question of how well the European allies can accomplish such new missions on their own, with only limited U.S. involvement. The current disparities between the United States and its NATO allies in transport, logistics, communications, and intelligence capabilities (made apparent in the first Persian Gulf War, in the Kosovo conflict, in the ongoing Balkans operations, and in Afghanistan) indicate that NATO is moving toward a two-tiered Alliance in which the United States and its NATO allies have vast differences in capabilities. The Committee notes, as it did in 1998, that in a February 1997 report to Congress on the rationale, benefits, costs, and implications of NATO enlargement, the Department of Defense concluded that in order to prevent such disparities the current allies would have to spend some $8-10 billion for force modernization by the year 2010. At a NATO ministerial meeting in Reykjavik in May 2002, the allies agreed that they must be able ``to carry out the full range of . . . missions, . . . to field forces wherever they are needed, sustain operations over distance and time, and achieve their objectives.'' While not all member states have sufficiently mobile or appropriately trained forces for the current tasks in Afghanistan and Iraq, a number of allies have an intelligence capability, transport, medical units, and political influence that might assist in such conflicts. The Committee Resolution of Ratification requires a specific and detailed report on progress by members of the Alliance to meet their commitments in fulfilling force goals. FUTURE NATO ENLARGEMENT Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty provides that NATO members, by unanimous agreement, may invite any other European state in a position to further the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area. The Committee emphasizes, however, that in the process of considering the qualifications and purpose for the admission of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia into NATO, the Committee did not state a view on when, or whether, the United States should invite any additional countries to join NATO. Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia have been invited by NATO members to join the Alliance. No other agreement or document should be construed otherwise. As in 1998, the Committee points out that the Executive Branch must first consult the Senate before inviting any new aspirant countries to join the Alliance. The proposed candidates must be able to fulfill the obligations and responsibilities of membership, and their inclusion must contribute to the overall political and strategic interests of the United States. The Executive Branch has stated its understanding of the need for consultation with the Senate. The Committee Resolution of Ratification reiterates that no action or agreement other than a consensus decision by the full membership of NATO, approved by the national procedures of each NATO member, including, in the case of the United States, the requirements of Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States (regarding the advice and consent of the Senate to the making of treaties), will constitute a security commitment pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty. SENATE ADVICE ON NATO ENLARGEMENT On October 24, 2001, Senator Jesse Helms introduced to the Committee the Freedom Consolidation Act (S. 1572), which reaffirms support for continued enlargement of the NATO; designates Slovakia for participation in PfP and states that it is eligible to receive certain security assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994; and authorizes specified amounts of security assistance for FY 2002 for Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. (an identical bill, H.R. 3167, was introduced in the House on the same day and passed on November 6, 2001). The Committee reported out the legislation on December 12, 2001. Cosponsors included Senators Durbin, Lieberman, Lott, Lugar and McCain. Unfortunately, consideration and passage could not be completed until the following year. The Senate took up S. 1572 again on May 16, 2002, and passed it the next day by a vote of 85-6. President Bush signed the bill into Public Law 107-187 on June 10, 2002. An August 2002 report by the Republican staff of the Foreign Relations Committee recommended that Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia be invited to join NATO at the Prague summit if they continue to carry out political, economic and military reforms. The report stressed the importance of the Membership Action Plan (MAP) program during the ratification process in preventing backsliding on reforms among the invitees, and that the MAP process would also help to implement policies announced in Prague to fight the threats of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. NATO members preliminarily endorsed the expansion of the Alliance at a November 2002 summit in Prague, setting in motion a process to expand NATO for the fifth time since 1949. In the view of the Committee, the Executive Branch has consulted and sought the advice of the Senate, consistent with the requirements of Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States, as the membership of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in NATO has been proposed and considered. Indeed, this consultation is a model of how the two branches should cooperate in exercising their treaty-making power. As is evident in the Senate Action portion of this report, the Bush Administration and the Senate have been in constant dialog on this policy for two years. NATO foreign ministers signed the protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty to admit Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia on March 26, 2003. The President transmitted the protocols to the Senate on April 10, 2003 for Senate action. LAST ROUND OF ENLARGEMENT During the Clinton Administration, the Senate debated and approved legislation in support of NATO enlargement in 1994, 1995, and 1996. On July 25, 1996, by an 81-16 vote, the Senate approved legislation stating that: The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe which are found to be in a position to further the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty would contribute to international peace and contribute to the security of the region. Throughout 1996 and 1997 the Executive Branch worked closely with the Foreign Relations Committee as this policy was pursued in NATO. NATO foreign ministers signed the protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty to admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic on December 16, 1997. President Clinton transmitted the protocols to the Senate on February 11, 1998 for Senate action. On April 30, 1998, the Senate voted 80-19 in favor of admitting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to NATO. II. Qualfications of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia for NATO Menbership Countries in Central and Eastern Europe first gained institutional access to NATO in late 1991 through the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), a forum which includes all former Warsaw Pact members. At the January 1994 NATO summit, the Alliance launched the Partnership for Peace (PfP), a U.S. initiative designed to develop military cooperation among NATO members and interested countries in Europe. By August of that year, each of the seven aspirants had signed the PfP framework agreement. Since 1994, the seven nations have actively participated in PfP military exercises, which have provided their militaries the opportunity to work with NATO military headquarters, and alongside NATO allies, in the field, and have contributed to increasing the interoperability between prospective new members and the Alliance. However, while all PfP countries seek some degree of interoperability with NATO, not all of them desire NATO membership. At the April 1999 NATO summit in Washington, NATO leaders announced a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to provide ``advice, assistance and practical support'' to countries seeking membership in the Alliance. Each NATO aspirant country submits an annual program on its preparations for possible future membership, and NATO provides feedback on aspirant countries' progress. All of the aspirants joined the MAP program and set Partnership Goals to help them prepare for NATO membership. In February 2002, U.S. Ambassador to NATO R. Nicholas Burns led an interagency team to visit Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, as well as Albania and Macedonia (which were not invited to join NATO at the Prague summit in November 2002) to assess their progress toward meeting NATO standards. He held detailed discussions with officials from these countries on their military reform efforts and their ability to contribute militarily to the Alliance. In July 2002, Ambassador Burns again led the interagency team to Riga for the V-10 summit, and in October 2002, he led the team to the aspirant countries to evaluate their progress. The Committee supports the Administration's assessment of the readiness of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia to join NATO that was provided by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Bradtke in testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee on March 27, 2003. In explaining the Administration's engagement in working with the candidate countries to prepare for NATO membership, Secretary Bradtke stated that: We have held literally hundreds of meetings and traveled thousands of miles to learn as much as we could about the aspirant countries and to encourage their preparations to join NATO. By issuing the invitation at Prague to the seven countries we are talking about today to join the Alliance, President Bush and his fellow leaders signaled their belief that these intensive efforts to promote and encourage reform had been a success. Mr. Chairman, nothing has happened since Prague that should cause us to question their judgment. The evidence shows that all seven invitees have made an enduring commitment to the core values of NATO and that each is ready, both politically and militarily, to contribute to the defense of the Alliance. . . . All of the countries, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, are parliamentary democracies that have had free and fair elections, that have open market economies, and that respect the principles of free speech and free press. All have taken steps to improve governance by bolstering judicial independence and adopting anti-corruption measures. All have improved their protection of human rights, including minority rights and civil liberties. And all have taken steps to restitute property and to deal with complex and difficult issues from the past. An important issue NATO countries confront is whether it is necessary for the new members to contribute substantially to NATO's collective defense or collective security functions in the near term. Indeed, many current NATO members need to upgrade their capabilities to carry out NATO's new missions. U.S. and NATO officials have dealt with this difficulty by urging aspirants to develop as quickly as possible specialized ``niche'' capabilities that the Alliance needs most. NATO's key priority for both current and future members is to develop capabilities to strike terrorism and other threats anywhere in the world. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, each of the seven aspirants declared its determination to act as an ally of the United States in the fight against terror. Since then, all seven countries have provided support for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, and have contributed to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. At a May 1, 2002 hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith said that enlargement was needed to extend the zone of security and stability in Europe through the expansion of a united Euro-Atlantic community based on democratic values. Grossman asserted that enlargement was still relevant in the wake of the September 11 attacks because ``if we are to meet new threats to our security, we need to build the broadest and strongest coalition possible of countries that share our values and are able to act effectively with us.'' He noted that the aspirants declared their determination to act as allies of the United States in the fight against terror. Feith added that ``an enlarged Alliance of democratic states with improved capabilities and interoperability, joint defense and operational planning, and realistic training will be better able to fulfill the Alliance's main purpose: to increase the security of its members and provide for the common defense against terrorism and other threats.'' In considering the qualifications of the seven countries, the Committee has examined the degree to which each has satisfied the Membership Action Plan (MAP). The Committee believes that Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia have overcome obstacles to their candidacies. And of the seven aspirants, the Baltic states have made the most progress in meeting MAP requirements. BULGARIA \\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The facts and figures in Qualifications, section II, are based on several memoranda by Carl Ek, Paul Gallis and Steve Woehrel of the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division of the Congressional Research Service of The Library of Congress. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Democratic Reform Bulgaria is a parliamentary republic ruled by a democratically elected government. Bulgaria's process of reform since 1989 from communism to an open, market-oriented democracy accelerated after 1997. The Bulgarian government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, but has problems with rampant corruption, as well as trafficking in persons and drugs, and mistreatment of its Roma (Gypsy) minority. The government is working to reform the judicial system and has taken anti-corruption initiatives. Implementation of these reforms remains an issue. Free Market Economy Bulgaria is a functioning market economy, and has made progress in privatization and structural reforms. Bulgaria's GDP was $13.6 billion in 2001 and $15.5 billion in 2002. The economy remains troubled by high unemployment, low living standards, and low levels of foreign investment. Economic priorities for the government include keeping tight controls over spending, completing delayed privatization, and combating corruption. The October 2002 European Commission report lauded Bulgaria's macroeconomic stability and progress in privatization and in structural reforms. Due to its late start in making economic reforms, however, it was not invited to join the European Union (EU) in December 2002, unlike all of the other candidate states, except Romania. EU leaders hold out hope that Bulgaria could reach its goal of achieving EU membership by 2007 if it continues its reforms. Foreign Policy Bulgaria's primary foreign policy goals are membership in NATO and the European Union. Bulgaria is a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe and has been a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) since 1996. Located in an unstable region, Bulgaria has actively supported and, in some cases, led regional cooperation initiatives such as the Black Sea Economic Conference, regional summit and defense ministerial meetings, and the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe. Bulgaria maintains favorable relations with its neighboring states. Military Capabilities & Defense Issues In the last few years, the Bulgarian armed forces (comprising the army, navy, and air force) have embarked on a comprehensive reform and restructuring process focused on moving away from large, offensively-oriented and top-heavy structures and toward smaller, flexible, and NATO-compatible forces. The process of downsizing the armed forces, while important for cost savings in the long run, has imposed short- term burdens on the budget, limiting available resources for modernization and training. Bulgaria plans to continue implementing its armed forces reform program and participating in international peace missions. Bulgaria has developed and adapted several plans for reforming the armed forces, including reducing the strength of the armed forces. The goal of the reforms is to achieve a small but combat-ready army. In 2002, Bulgaria's armed forces numbered 53,400, and by the end of 2003, it expects to reduce the armed forces to 46,500 with 8,281 professionals. Its ``Plan 2004,'' which is based on recommendations included in a U.S. study on the Bulgarian armed forces, calls for the armed forces to be reduced to about 45,000 by 2004, with 25,447 in the army and 2,569 in the army reserves, 12,116 in the air force, and 4,868 in the navy with 100,000 personnel in the reserves. The armed forces are being restructured into rapid reaction forces, main defense forces, territorial defense forces, and reserves. The term of conscription has been reduced to nine months, and the army will convert to a fully professional force by 2010. Other key reform priorities include increased interoperability with NATO in areas such as air defense, command and control, logistics, and training. Bulgaria signed a bilateral agreement with the United States on the destruction of its SS-23 SCUD, and FROG missiles. On October 31, 2002, Bulgaria announced that it had destroyed all of the missiles. Bulgaria's defense budget has been increasing since 1999, and it is committed to sustaining over 3.0% of GDP for defense spending. Most of the defense budget goes toward personnel costs. Bulgaria has active and reserve forces, but only the army has reserves in activity during peace time. Bulgaria also has paramilitary personnel serving as border guards, security police, or railway/construction troops. Bulgaria remains saddled with equipment from the Warsaw Pact era, with attendant high costs of maintenance and repair. Bulgaria has no immediate plans to purchase expensive Western fighter aircraft, and has decided instead to upgrade most of its fleet of MiG-29 tactical fighter aircraft. Bulgaria has participated in and hosted numerous NATO Partnership for Peace training exercises designed to improve interoperability with NATO forces. It has also participated in the Planning and Review Process under PfP, and agreed to work on Partnership Goals. Bulgaria participates in the NATO peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo, contributed to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and has deployed nuclear, biological and chemical decontamination units to ISAF in Afghanistan. On February 5, 2003, Bulgaria joined the V-10 Statement on compelling Iraq to disarm, joined the coalition for the immediate disarmament of Iraq, and has indicated it will provide support for post-conflict and reconstruction in Iraq. Illicit arms sales is a problem throughout southeastern Europe, and the so-called Terem case in Bulgaria has raised many questions about its commitment to tackle the issue of grey arms. The Terem case involved the sale of dual-use materials that, according to some reports, could have ended up in Iraq. The U.S. brought it to the attention of the Bulgarian government, which acted swiftly to stop the sale of the illicit arms, fire officials, and initiate investigation and prosecutions with respect to the Terem case. At the time of this report, the investigation into the Terem case is continuing. The United States is assisting the Bulgarian government, with a view to helping it get a firmer grip on grey arms sales in general. Civilian Control of the Military & Oversight of Intelligence Agencies Under the Bulgarian constitution, the role of the armed forces is to guarantee the sovereignty, security, and independence of the country and to defend its territorial integrity. The President is commander-in-chief of the armed forces and appoints or dismisses the higher command of the armed forces. Civilian government and parliamentary authorities exercise administrative and budgetary control over the armed forces. As outlined in Plan 2004 and the MAP Annual National Programs, parliament has also adopted several other related laws and amendments to the Defense and Armed Forces Act. Protection of Classified Information NATO has expressed concern to Bulgaria about its procedures for ensuring the security of classified information. It is the hope of the Committee that Bulgaria will continue to improve these procedures for ensuring the security of classified information. The Committee urges the Executive Branch to assist the Government of Bulgaria to swiftly bring its protection of classified information into conformity with NATO standards. ESTONIA Democratic Reform Estonia is a parliamentary democracy with a free market economy. It has held free and fair elections since the restoration of its independence in 1991. Estonia respects the human rights of its citizens, including the large ethnic Russian non-citizen community, and enjoys the rule of law. Problems exist in some areas, including the treatment of prisoners and the use of excessive force by police. Free Market Economy Estonia is a functioning market economy. Estonia's GDP was $5.5 billion in 2001, and an estimated $6.3 billion in 2002. Many experts believe Estonia has one of the strongest records on economic reform in Central Europe. It has pursued sound fiscal and monetary policies and has privatized much of its economy; the private sector accounts for 75% of GDP, one of the highest percentages in the region. Unemployment is low, at 5.4% of the labor force in 2002. However, Estonia still needs to restructure its energy sector, including the oil shale industry. In 2002, the central government had a budget surplus of 1.9% of GDP and average consumer price inflation was 3.6%. However, Estonia suffers from a high current account deficit, which reached 12.4% of GDP in 2002. On April 16, 2003, Slovenia signed an accession agreement with the EU. It is expected to join the EU in 2004. Foreign Policy Estonia is a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, NATO's PfP and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). It enjoys excellent relations with most of its neighbors, and has no ethnic or territorial disputes with them. It has very good ties with the Nordic countries, which are enshrined in a number of institutional frameworks. Links between Finland and Estonia are especially close. Estonia has also increased cooperation with Lithuania and Latvia in security, economic and political matters through the Baltic council, the Baltic Assembly and other intergovernmental organizations. Estonia's relations with Russia have been strained at times, but both countries have initialed a border agreement. Military Capabilities & Defense Issues Estonia has about 7,200 men in its regular armed forces. In addition, it has about 8,300 men in the Defense League, a volunteer reserve force. Estonia's armed forces do not possess tanks or combat aircraft. It has 7 BRDM-2 reconnaissance vehicles, 32 armored personnel carriers, 19 105 mm artillery pieces, 44 81 mm mortars and 14 120 mm mortars. Estonia is building its armed forces around a light infantry brigade, supplemented by territorial defense troops. Estonia plans to have one battalion of this force equipped and trained by May 2003. Estonia is concentrating its efforts on developing specialized capabilities in air surveillance and naval minesweeping. Estonia's defense spending in 2002 was about $125 million, or about 2.0% of Estonia GDP. Small in number, Estonia's armed forces can make a modest contribution to future NATO peacekeeping efforts, similar to that of smaller current NATO members. Baltic defense cooperation is an important part of Estonia's efforts to improve its qualifications for NATO membership. Estonia joins Latvia and Lithuania in a range of regional defense forces and institutions, along with Latvia and Lithuania, agreed to form a Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion with the help of NATO countries, which have supplied equipment and training for the force. BALTBAT has not been deployed as a whole unit, although parts of the force have participated in the NATO-led force in Bosnia. By 2005, each of the three states plans to create its own professional infantry battalions from BALTBAT, which will form the core of its armed forces. These forces would be able to engage in a full range of international deployments, as well as to contribute to the self-defense capabilities of the Baltic states. A Baltic naval squadron (BALTRON) is another joint Baltic military project. Since 1998, this five-vessel minesweeping unit has participated in exercises with NATO forces. A third important Baltic military program is BALTNET, a joint air surveillance network. BALTNET became operational in 2000, but it will need additional, more modern equipment before it will be full effective. It is planned that BALTNET will eventually be integrated in NATO's air defense system. Finally, the Baltic states have established a joint Baltic Defense College (BALTDEFCOL) in Tartu, Estonia. BALTDEFCOL educates staff officers from the three states in NATO-based staff procedures, defense planning and management. Estonia has made progress in achieving interoperability with NATO and from 1997-2002, had a company of soldiers serving as part of the Danish battalion of SFOR on several occasions, rotating with units from Latvia and Lithuania. A 22-man Estonian military police unit is deployed as part of an Italian-led Multinational Specialized Unit in KFOR in Kosovo. In February 2003, an Estonian infantry company was deployed to KFOR, where it will rotate with companies from Latvia and Lithuania. Estonia sent an explosives detection unit to assist Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in July 2002. An ordinance disposal unit was assigned to the ISAF peacekeeping force in March 2003. On February 5, 2003, Estonia joined the V- 10 Statement on compelling Iraq to disarm and offered overflight and transit of U.S. coalition forces for Operation Iraqi Freedom. Civilian control of the Military & Oversight of Intelligence Agencies Legal mechanisms exist in Estonia to guarantee civilian control of Estonia's military and intelligence services. The President of Estonia is the Supreme Commander of National Defense. He can declare war and issue mobilization orders in case of an attack against Estonia. He also appoints and dismisses the leadership of the armed forces, and approves officer promotions, on the proposal of the government and the commander of the regular armed forces. The parliament approves the defense budget as well as defense policy guidelines and priorities. The parliament also approves the nomination by the President of the commander of Estonia's armed forces. The Estonian defense minister, a civilian, exercises control over the development and organization of the armed forces through the commander of the Regular Armed Forces. The President of the Republic is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and appoints top military officers. LATVIA Democratic Reform Latvia is a parliamentary democracy that has held free and fair elections since it achieved full independence in 1991. Latvia has a democratic political system, the rule of law, respect for human rights and for the rights of minorities, including integrating the Russian-speaking minority. Latvia has problems with police brutality, an inefficient judiciary, poor prison conditions, and trafficking in women and children. Free Market Economy Latvia has a functioning market economy. Its GDP was $7.6 billion in 2001 and $8.4 billion in 2002. Average consumer price inflation was 1.8% and the unemployment rate was 7.6% in 2002. Privatization in Latvia accelerated in early 2003, particularly in the banking sector. Latvia needs to privatize several companies in its vitally important energy sector, including the oil transit firm Ventspils Nafta, and the state energy company Latvenergo. Privatization of these firms has been hindered by a conflict with Russia, which is demanding a share of Ventspils Nafta, and by charges of corruption at Latvenergo. According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Latvia needs to make progress in improving transparency, corporate governance and fighting corruption. On April 16, 2003, Latvia signed an accession agreement with the EU. It is expected to join the European Union in 2004. Foreign Policy Latvia is a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, NATO's PfP and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). It enjoys good relations with most of its neighbors and has increased cooperation with Estonia and Lithuania in security, economic and political matters through the Baltic Council, the Baltic Assembly and other inter-governmental organizations. While Latvia's relations with Russia have been difficult at times, Latvia and Russia have completed negotiations on a border agreement, but have yet to sign it. Military Capabilities & Defense Issues Latvia has about 6,500 men in its active-duty armed forces, and 14,400 men in the National Guard reserves. It has 3 T-55 tanks, 13 armored personnel carriers, 2 reconnaissance vehicles, 26 100 mm artillery pieces, as well as five 82 mm mortars and 26 120 mm mortars, and no combat aircraft. Latvia spent $144.4 million on defense in 2002, or 1.75% of GDP. In 2003, It plans to increase defense spending to $184 million, or 2.0% of GDP,, the informal target set by NATO for the applicant states. Small in number, Latvia's armed forces will provide a modest contribution to future NATO peacekeeping efforts, similar to that of smaller current NATO members. Latvia has had a company of soldiers serving as part of the Danish battalion of SFOR on several occasions, rotating with units from Estonia and Lithuania. Fifteen Latvian soldiers are deployed to KFOR in Kosovo. In March 2003, Latvia sent eight military medics to serve in the ISAF peacekeeping force in Afghanistan. On February 5, 2003, Latvia joined the V-10 Statement on compelling Iraq to disarm. On March 20, 2003, the Latvian parliament passed a resolution supporting U.S. military action in Iraq. Latvia has contributed overflight and transit of U.S. and coalition forces to Operation Iraqi Freedom; and the Parliament has approved allowing forces to deploy to Iraq for peace operations. The main priorities of Latvia's defense policy are to enhance the country's ability to defend itself, develop interoperability with NATO, and participate in international peacekeeping efforts. In 2003, Latvia plans to equip and train a light infantry battalion that would form the core of the country's army as well as be fully capable of participation in NATO-led peacekeeping missions. Latvia also plans to train and equip three additional mobile reserve battalions. A key part of Latvia's cooperation with NATO is the effort of the three Baltic states to develop joint defense projects. In 1994, Latvia, along with Estonia and Lithuania, agreed to form a Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion with the help of NATO countries, which have supplied equipment and training for the force. BALTBAT has not been deployed as a whole unit, although parts of the force have participated in the NATO-led force in Bosnia. By 2005, each of the three states plans to create its own professional infantry battalion from BALTBAT, which will form the core of its armed forces. These forces would be able to engage in a full range of international deployments, as well as to contribute to the self-defense capabilities of the Baltic states. A Baltic naval squadron (BALTRON) is another joint Baltic military project. Since 1998, this five-vessel minesweeping unit has participated in exercises with NATO forces. A third important Baltic military program is BALTNET, a joint air surveillance network. BALTNET became operational in 2000, but it will need additional, more modern equipment before it will be fully effective. It is planned that BALTNET will eventually be integrated in NATO's air defense system. Finally, the Baltic states have established a joint Baltic Defense College (BALTDEFCOL) in Tartu, Estonia. BALTDEFCOL educates staff officers from the three states in NATO-based staff procedures, defense planning and management. At NATO's urging, Latvia is focusing its efforts on developing specialized capabilities in air surveillance (as part of BALTNET), military medics, explosive ordnance disposal experts, military police, and nuclear, chemical and biological decontamination units. Civilian Control of the Military & Oversight of Intelligence Agencies Legal mechanisms exist to provide for civilian control of Latvia's military and intelligence services. The Latvian parliament adopts the defense budget and approves laws on national defense. The commander of Latvia's armed forces is subordinated to a civilian Minister of Defense. Protection of Classified Information NATO has expressed concern to Latvia about its procedures for ensuring the security of classified information. It is the hope of the Committee that Latvia will continue to improve these procedures for ensuring the security of classified information. The Committee urges the Executive Branch to assist the Government of Latvia to swiftly bring its protection of classified information into conformity with NATO standards, particularly its procedures for vetting individuals for access to the most sensitive materials. LITHUANIA Democratic Reform Lithuania is a parliamentary democracy, which has held free and fair elections since achieving independence in 1991. Lithuania has a democratic political system and respects the human rights of its citizens, including the rights of national minorities. Lithuania has an independent judiciary, but police brutality and corruption and poor prison conditions remain problems. Free Market Economy Lithuania is a functioning market economy. Lithuania's GDP was $12 billion in 2001 and $13.9 billion in 2002. In 2002, average consumer price inflation was 0.3%, and unemployment was 10.7%. In February 2003, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) praised Lithuania's stringent fiscal and monetary policies and its excellent macroeconomic performance. Lithuania has privatized most of its industries. However, several key sectors remain to be privatized, including the natural gas company Lietuvos Dujos (delayed due to protracted negotiations with the main bidder, the Russian gas giant Gazprom), the national airline, and the power distribution networks. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) notes that Lithuania has privatized its banking sector, but needs to bolster other parts of its financial sector, including the stock market and insurance companies. On April 16, 2003, Lithuania signed an accession agreement with the EU. It is expected to join the European Union in 2004. Foreign Policy Lithuania is a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, NATO's PfP and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). It enjoys good relations with neighboring countries, and has no major territorial or ethnic disputes with them. Lithuania has increased cooperation with Estonia and Latvia in security, economic and political matters through the Baltic Council, the Baltic Assembly and other inter-governmental organizations. Lithuania has forged highly successful ties with Poland, a country with which Lithuania has historically had a complex and sometimes difficult relationship. Lithuania has a generally good relationship with Russia. Russia and Lithuania signed a border treaty in October 1997. While Russia no longer opposes Lithuania's membership in NATO, a point of contention is Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave in eastern Europe, which would be surrounded by NATO member states if Lithuania gained membership in the Alliance. NATO and Latvia have said that this issue should be resolved through the European Union. Lithuania currently permits Russian military traffic to transit Lithuania on its way to Kaliningrad. Military Capabilities & Defense Issues Lithuania currently has about 6,900 men in its active-duty army. Lithuania possesses no tanks, combat aircraft or heavy artillery, and has 10 reconnaissance vehicles, 81 armored personnel carriers and 42 120 mm mortars. Lithuania is making the transition from a force based on territorial forces to one based more on professional, better- equipped, rapidly-deployable ones. Lithuania is developing a Rapid Reaction Brigade that will form the core of its forces. This force, which will be composed of about 3,800 men in peacetime when it is completed by 2008, will be supplemented by territorial units, which are being reduced. When the Rapid Reaction Brigade is ready, Lithuania expects to provide a battalion-sized unit that can deploy with NATO forces overseas for combat missions. In 2001, Lithuania spent $230.2 million on defense, or about 1.96% GDP. In 2002, Lithuania increased its defense spending to 2% of GDP. Small in number, Lithuania's armed forces will provide a modest contribution to future NATO peacekeeping efforts, similar to that of smaller current NATO members. On a rotating basis, Lithuania contributes a company of 100 personnel with the Danish contingent to SFOR and maintains 30 Lithuanian soldiers in KFOR as part of a Polish battalion. Lithuania offered use of Lithuanian airspace and airfields and other support for Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and in November 2002, the Lithuanian government sent 40 special forces soldiers to Afghanistan to assist U.S. and allied efforts, and these troops have participated in combat operations there. A team of Lithuanian military medics has also been deployed to ISAF in Afghanistan. On February 5, 2003, Lithuania joined the V-10 Statement on compelling Iraq to disarm, and on March 17 expressed support for the U.S. military campaign in Iraq. The Lithuanian parliament voted on March 25, 2003 to deploy cargo handlers and medical personnel to support Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Lithuania has offered medical and logistic support to a post-war peacekeeping force in Iraq. Baltic defense cooperation is an important part of Lithuania's efforts to improve its qualifications for NATO membership. Along with Latvia and Estonia, agreed to form a Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion with the help of NATO countries, which have supplied equipment and training for the force. BALTBAT has not been deployed as a whole unit, although parts of the force have participated in the NATO-led force in Bosnia. By 2005, each of the three states plan to create its own professional infantry battalion from BALTBAT, which will form the core of its armed forces.

At NATO's urging, Lithuania is attempting to develop specialized capabilities useful to the Alliance, such as air surveillance (as part of BALTNET), special forces, explosive ordnance disposal experts, and engineers. Civilian Control of the Military & Oversight of Intelligence Agencies Legal mechanisms exist to guarantee civilian control of Lithuania's military and intelligence services. The President of Lithuania is the Supreme Commander of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. Lithuania's parliament approves the defense budget. The Defense Ministry prepares plans and budget requests and supervises their execution. ROMANIA Democratic Reform Romania is a constitutional democracy with a bicameral legislature. It has held four elections, deemed free and fair by outside observers, since the fall of communism. Romania's political life has been relatively stable since President Ion Iliescu and his Party of Social Democracy (PSD) were reinstalled in the 2000 elections. The PSD has ruled as a minority government, with the support of the ethnic Hungarian party. The Romanian government generally respects the rights of its citizens, and the situation of the ethnic Hungarian minority has improved considerably over the past years. Nonetheless, the Greater Romania Party, a xenophobic organization, continues to command the support of about one- sixth of the electorate, and the notorious bias against ethnic Hungarians of a few local officials stands in opposition to the more enlightened policies of the national government. Other problems continue, such as police mistreatment of detainees, discrimination and violence against women, juvenile homelessness, and discrimination against religious minorities and its Roma (Gypsy) population. A major concern is corruption. Prime Minister Nastase has said that reduction of corruption is a top priority, and the government has initiated an anti- corruption campaign. Free Market Economy Over the last several years, Romania has continued to make progress towards being a functioning market economy. While GDP declined sharply during 1997-1999, it rose by 1.8% in 2000 and 5.3% in 2001; the 2002 growth rate was 4.9%. Inflation, which averaged 45% in 1999 and 2000, dropped to 30.3% in 2001 and was about 18% at the end of 2002. Unemployment for 2002 is expected to be 8.3%. Romania has natural resources and may prosper with successful market-oriented reforms, including taxation, investment and privatization. Pervasive corruption has been a continuing problem in Romania, and the government has created a new National Anti-corruption Prosecutor's Office and has recently introduced a clutch of laws to combat graft. Foreign observers are watching for signs of aggressive implementation of the legislation once it is passed, as well as for continuing privatization of large-scale enterprises, especially in the financial and energy sectors. Romania continues to receive much-needed assistance from international organizations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the European Union (EU). Romania is expected to join the EU in 2004. Foreign Policy Romania is a member of the Council of Europe, as well as NATO's PfP and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). In 2001, it was judged to have done an excellent job in the revolving chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Through a series of bilateral treaties and multilateral agreements, Romania has been seeking to normalize its relations with neighboring states and to increase regional cooperation. It has concluded agreements intended to improve relations with Hungary and Ukraine, and has signed treaties that address disputes with Bulgaria, former Yugoslavia and Slovakia. Romania has also been working in cooperation with Moldova, Turkey, Greece, and other countries in the region on matters affecting trade, security, the environment, and law enforcement. Military Capabilities & Defense Issues In 1995, Romania started to take more active participation in the United Nations. It sent a battalion of troops and medical staff to Angola, and has military observers in Central Africa and the Persian Gulf, and has provided troops for the humanitarian assistance effort in Albania. It has participated in numerous NATO PfP exercises, and has contributed personnel to SFOR and KFOR. The Committee commends Romania's unusual airlift capability, as demonstrated in July 2002 when it used its own airlift to send a battalion to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan. As President Bush stated in his March 25, 2003 Report to Congress on the Enlargement of NATO, ``In support of OEF, Romania used its own C-130 aircraft to self-deploy an infantry battalion of 400 troops, the `Red Scorpions,' to Kandahar, where the mission was recently extended until mid-2003.'' Since that Report, the ``Red Scorpions'' have been replaced by the ``Carpathian Hawks.'' For ISAF, the peace keeping mission in Afghanistan, Romania has deployed military police, personnel and troops. On February 5, 2003, Romania joined the V-10 Statement on compelling Iraq to disarm, and offered the use of its territory for military action in Iraq. Romania has offered public support for all U.S.-led post-conflict and reconstruction initiatives in Iraq. Romania's 2002 defense budget was 2.38 % of GDP. The defense minister announced in October 2002 that the 2003 budget would allocate 2.3% of GDP to the military. Romania is doing well on military personnel reform; it has been reorganizing its military structure in accordance with Western standards, and has created a rapid reaction force. The force size was reduced to 121,693 in September 2002, with a goal of 75,000 by 2007. In addition, the top-heavy officer ranks are being culled. The Defense Ministry also intends to move toward a more professional military. Romania has been making progress in terms of NATO interoperability. It has been modernizing its military equipment and adding new weapons systems. Romania's MIG-21 fighter aircraft are being upgraded, as are navy ships, communications facilities, and missile launching systems. Romania has been developing ``niche capabilities'' to offer NATO, including airlift, minesweeping, UAVs, counter-NBC warfare, mountain combat troops, and special forces. With relatively large armed forces, Romania has the potential of significant military contributions and could serve as a geostrategic partner. Civilian Control of the Military & Oversight of Intelligence Agencies Romania has made progress in the area of civilian management of the military and intelligence services, though some problems remain from the Ceausescu era, including the presence of former Securitate officials in senior positions in the intelligence services, Romania has enacted legislation to ensure civilian control over the military and intelligence agencies--the 1991 constitution declares the president to be commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Romania has had a civilian defense minster since mid-1994, and has sought to consolidate civilian control since then. SLOVAKIA Democratic Reform Slovakia and the Czech Republic peacefully split from union in the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic in 1993. From a starting point generally equal to that of the Czech Republic, Slovakia's international standing quickly diminished during the controversial leadership of Vladimir Meciar and his party, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HzDS). In the 1998 elections, a broad coalition of four opposition parties defeated Meciar's HzDS and its coalition partners, and Mikulas Dzurinda of the Slovak Democratic Coalition became Prime Minister. Meciar also lost to Rudolf Schuster in Slovakia's first direct presidential elections in May 1999. Slovakia's most recent parliamentary elections were held on September 20-21, 2002, shortly before the NATO Prague Summit. Meciar's party won a plurality, but was unable to attract coalition partners. Dzurinda's party finished second in the voting and teamed up with three center-right parties to form a government. During his first term in office, Dzurinda focused on accelerating economic reforms, consolidating democratic development, combating corruption, and advancing accession negotiations with the European Union. Slovakia has improved its human rights situation, but continues to have problems related to the treatment of its Roma (Gypsy) population in Slovakia. The government also passed amendments to its constitution that strengthened the judicial branch and constitutional court, facilitated public administration reform, and established an ombudsman's function for the public defense of citizens' rights. Free Market Economy Slovakia is a functioning market economy able to cope with the competitive pressures of European Union (EU) membership and market forces in the EU in the near term. Slovakia's GDP rose by 3.3% in 2001, 4.4% in 2002, and the outlook for 2003 and beyond is favorable, buoyed by increasing foreign investment and domestic consumption. Inflation is expected to rise temporarily to nearly 8% in 2003, mainly as a result of the passage of needed reforms in fiscal policy. Unemployment in Slovakia is currently at 17.1% (below the 2002 level by 2.5%), but remains a serious concern for the government. Joblessness is concentrated mainly in rural areas and among Roma settlements. Corruption, particularly in public procurement, has been identified as a problem. On April 16, 2003, Slovakia signed an accession agreement with the EU. Foreign Policy Slovakia was among the first countries to sign up for NATO's PfP program in 1994, and has since participated in numerous PfP exercises. Slovakia is a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). In December 2000, Slovakia also joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Slovakia consults regularly with its ``Visegrad partners'' (Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic). Military Capabilities & Defense Issues Since 1998, the Dzurinda government has given priority to reforming, restructuring, and developing the Slovak armed forces, ultimately to become fully compatible with NATO. The Slovak armed forces have been downsizing steadily, moving toward a smaller, more flexible, and less top-heavy force. In 2002, the Slovak armed forces numbered about 26,200 troops, including 10,400 conscripts; 13,000 served in the army and 10,200 in the air force. The government also has nearly 4,700 paramilitary troops serving in internal security and civil defense capacities. Current reform and restructuring plans call for the Slovak armed forces to reduce its personnel strength to 24,500 land force, air force, and civilian personnel by 2006. The term of conscription is currently 9 months. Compulsory military service is to be phased out as the army becomes fully professional by 2006. After several years of decline, defense spending has increased in the last few years. Slovakia's defense budget in 2002 was $370 million, or about 1.89 GDP, most of which was designated for operations and support. Slovakia's military reform programs call for the gradual modernization of armed forces equipment to enhance interoperability and standardization. The Dzurinda government has adopted numerous armed forces reform programs that have subsequently been adapted to take into account feedback from the annual MAP process and a U.S. defense assessment from 2000. In early 2000, the armed forces general staff was integrated into the defense ministry. In early 2001, parliament approved a constitutional amendment to facilitate joining collective defense alliances. Later, the government adopted and parliament approved legislation on a national security strategy, a defense strategy, and a military strategy. Also in 2001, the government prepared a long-term defense review and planning process for the structure and development of the armed forces. The process resulted in a long-term reform plan referred to as Slovak Republic (SR) Force 2010, which aims to establish by the year 2010 a small, well-equipped and trained armed force that is integrated into NATO military structures and capable of operating in allied military operations. SR Force 2010 calls for a streamlined force structure comprised of ground and air forces, a consolidated training and support element, and command and control through the integrated general staff and defense ministry. Slovakia has provided troops to SFOR and KFOR, and immediately offered support and granted overflight, landing and refueling rights to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. It has also budgeted for and initiated preparation of an Afghan Assistance Program. On February 5, 2003, Slovakia joined the V- 10 Statement on compelling Iraq to disarm, and has contributed to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Slovakia has indicated that it will contribute to post-conflict and reconstruction in Iraq. Civilian Control of the Military Under the Slovak constitution, the President is supreme commander of the armed forces and is able to declare a state of emergency in the republic. The Slovak parliament considers all defense-related acts and provides financial support for the armed services. The parliament has been active and engaged in developing and shaping defense policy. Civilian control was enhanced with the integration of the armed forces general staff into the defense ministry in 2000. The establishment of a new legal framework for national security issues and strategy and the role fo the armed forces has been a priority under the MAP process. In response, parliament passed by wide voting margins three major pieces of legislation in 2001 relating to national security, defense, and the armed forces. In December 2002, a Western media report severely criticized the Slovak Security Services for alleged undemocratic behavior, a charge which was vigorously denied by the Slovaks. The Committee urges the Executive Branch to work with the Government of Slovakia to assure that all remaining doubts about the activities of the Security Services are put to rest. SLOVENIA Democratic Reform Slovenia has a democratic political system. It is a parliamentary democracy and has held free and fair elections since winning independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Slovenia has an independent judiciary, the rule of law, and respects the human rights of its citizens and minorities. Free Market Economy Slovenia has a functioning market economy. Its GDP in 2001 was $18.7 billion, and $21.7 billion in 2002. Average consumer price inflation was 7.5% in 2002, which Slovenia needs to reduce to be in line with European Union (EU) requirements. Slovenia is the wealthiest of the candidate states, with a per capita GDP of $9,500 in 2001, but has suffered from low foreign direct investment (FDI). However, Slovenia has liberalized capital flows since 1999. Net FDI has surged from $110 million in 2000 to an estimated $553 million in 2002, and after a slow start, Slovenia has accelerated privatization of its industries. In 2003 and 2004, it plans to sell off parts of Slovenian Steelworks, the oil company Nafta Lendava, stakes in the Port of Koper and Ljubljana airport, and other assets. According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Slovenia needs to make further progress in privatizing the financial sector. On April 16, 2003, Slovenia signed an accession agreement with the EU. It is expected to join the EU in 2004. Foreign Policy Slovenia is a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, NATO's PfP and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Slovenia is a member of Central European Free Trade Area and the U.S.-sponsored Southeast European Cooperative Initiative. It participates in the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe. Although Slovenia has had some political disputes with Italy and Croatia in the past, Slovenia has made progress in improving relations with its neighbors, and has demonstrated good faith in attempts to resolve outstanding issues. Military Capabilities & Defense Issues Slovenia's armed forces are engaged in a reform and restructuring effort. At the time of Slovenia's declaration of independence in June 1991, Slovenia's armed forces consisted of territorial defense forces, somewhat similar in nature to U.S. National Guard units. In 2002, Slovenia decided to move rapidly toward wholly professional armed forces, to abolish conscription by 2004, and to step up efforts to recruit professional solders. The peacetime strength of Slovenia's armed forces in August 2002 was 5,346 men. This number is expected to rise to 6,300 troops by the end of 2004 and 7,900 by 2008, all of whom will be professional soldiers. It is also working on a concept for volunteer reserve forces. Total wartime strength, including reserves, will be less than 18,000 men. An important part of Slovenian army reform efforts has been the creation of ``reaction forces.'' These are composed of two battalions which can be deployed abroad within 30 days to conduct combat or peacekeeping operations. Slovenia is in the process of moving from a militia-based force to a professional one. Slovenia inherited a significant amount of the former Yugoslavia's weaponry, much of which is obsolete, including tanks, APCs and artillery. Aside from equipping the peacekeeping battalion, other procurement priorities for Slovenia are air defense, anti-armor weapons and NATO- compatible communications systems. In 2000, U.S. military experts noted that Slovenia needed to better relate its procurement priorities to the country's overall national security strategy. In response, Slovenia has adopted or is currently working on a hierarchy of documents that will govern its defense planning. These include a new national security strategy, a national threat assessment, a long-term development plan for the armed forces, a document on force structure, and other documents. Slovenia has amended its Defense Law in order to make it easier for the Slovene government to send forces out of the country to assist an ally and permit the stationing of allied forces on Slovene territory. Although it plans to continue to make equipment purchases according to the priorities listed above, Slovenia does not plan to undertake major increases in such spending over the next few years, but will focus on maintenance of current stocks. Slovenia's 2001 defense spending was $274.5 million, about 1.46% of Slovenia's GDP. Slovenia's defense spending in 2002 amounted to about 1.5% of GDP. Slovenia plans to increase defense spending by 0.1% of GDP each year until it reaches 2% GDP by 2008. The Committee hopes that given Slovenia's position as the wealthiest of the post-communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe, it could accelerate this timetable. Slovenia is working hard to increase interoperability with NATO within PfP. It participates in the NATO/PfP Planning and Review Process and has adopted Partnership Goals, aimed at increasing its ability to participate in future operations with NATO. Small in number, Slovenia's armed forces will be able to make a modest contribution to future NATO peacekeeping efforts, similar to that of smaller current NATO members. Slovenia would also provide a strategic land link between current NATO members Italy and Hungary. Slovenia is providing troops and equipment to SFOR and KFOR. Slovenia granted overflight, landing and refueling rights to Operation Enduring Freedom, and has provided humanitarian and demining assistance to Afghanistan, as well as a police officer for training and assisting the Afghan Police. On February 5, 2003, Slovenia joined the V-10 Statement on compelling Iraq to disarm, and has indicated its willingness to look for ways it could contribute to post- conflict reconstruction in Iraq. Civilian Control of the Military & Oversight of Intelligence Agencies Legal mechanisms exist in Slovenia to provide for civilian control of the military and intelligence services. According to the Slovenian constitution, the National Assembly approves the defense budget and conducts oversight of military and intelligence programs. The Slovenian defense minister, a civilian, exercises control over the development and organization of the armed forces through the General Staff. The President of Slovenia is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and appoints top military officers. III. The Cost of NATO Enlargement BACKGROUND \\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ The Cost of NATO Enlargement, section III, is based on a Memorandum by Carl Ek of the Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade Division of the Congressional Research Service. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The cost of NATO enlargement was an important, and at times contentious, issue during the last round of enlargement, when the Alliance was considering membership of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. NATO had taken in new members several times since its creation in 1949, but this round was different for two reasons: less than a decade earlier, the countries under consideration had belonged to the Warsaw Pact; and they were, for the most part, weaker economically than earlier new entrants. After NATO's 1997 Madrid Summit, during which Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were invited to begin accession negotiations, three major budget estimates--ranging to more than $100 billion--were prepared, but the need for large outlays failed to materialize. In fact, the cost of bringing in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic appears to have been relatively modest. The budget issue has almost disappeared during discussions of the current round of enlargement--even though some of the current invitees, particularly Romania and Bulgaria, are even less economically developed than the three former communist countries brought in during the last round. After their admission to NATO, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic began making payments into NATO's three common budgets and the prorated contributions of the other member states fell accordingly. The total U.S. share dropped by approximately 1%. CURRENT ENVIRONMENT Since the admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, NATO has moved even further away from the Cold War concept of maintaining a static defensive force--heavy ground forces prepared to repel a large-scale armored attack. The Committee notes, however, that although the conventional threat may have faded and new threats have emerged, were a conventional threat to emerge, the cost to NATO would be substantial regardless. As the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks demonstrated, non-state actors such as al-Qaeda may seek to conduct asymmetric warfare on NATO member states. The Committee believes that the threat of weapons of mass destruction is a growing concern for the United States and its allies, and commends the Alliance's pledge at the Prague Summit to strengthen its ability to meet the challenges to the security of NATO forces, populations and territory, from wherever they may come, and to ``go out of area'' to fight terrorism and proliferation and to develop more mobile capabilities. NEW MEMBER COST CONSIDERATIONS The seven countries currently under consideration for membership present a different set of issues militarily than did the last round of new members. The two largest countries, Romania and Bulgaria, are much less affluent than Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, and will therefore need to stretch out their procurement. On the other hand, the three Baltic states were left with virtually no armed forces after the Soviets withdrew. Since 1999, the United States and many of the NATO allies have participated in wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. These conflicts have pointed up the need for greater troop and asset mobility as well as the value of new capabilities, such as having special operations forces working in concert with aircraft capable of delivering precision-guided munitions. The MAP process in effect compels the invitees to take specific steps to reform and upgrade their militaries. The new states have also been strongly encouraged to commit to maintaining their defense spending at or near 2% GDP--a level higher than that of several current allies. Rather than dollars and cents, policymakers have been focusing this time around on military capabilities; emphasis is being placed not on how long it will take for new members to become interoperable with current NATO members, but rather on what their militaries are able to offer. To complement the NATO Response Force, and ensure that it has the proper tools to conduct a range of operations, the Alliance at its last summit approved the Prague Capabilities Commitment, under which members obligate themselves to acquire specific military assets. The seven countries that have been invited to join have already begun developing ``niche'' capabilities that NATO can draw on to fulfill its new missions. There is also a growing recognition of the value of having countries pool their resources to develop big-ticket procurement items such as strategic airlift. IV. Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimates of NATO Enlargement \\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ The information in section IV is taken directly from an April 28, 2003 report by the Congressional Budget Office entitled ``Cost Implications of Implementing the March 26, 2003, NATO Accession Protocols.'' U.S. Congress, Congressional Budget Office, April 28, 2003. Honorable Richard G. Lugar, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: In response to your request, the Congressional Budget Office has prepared the attached report on the costs associated with ratifying the protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Treaty Document 108-4). CBO estimates that integrating those seven countries into NATO would cost the 19 current NATO members about $2.7 billion dollars over the 2004- 2013 period; the U.S. share of that amount would be about $650 million and would be subject to appropriation action. In addition, the seven prospective NATO members could incur significant costs to upgrade and modernize their militaries. The United States might help those countries in that process through the use of foreign military financing and other assistance. However, such assistance would be discretionary and would probably not be significantly larger than current levels of aid to those countries. CBO does not anticipate any direct spending to result from the ratification of the protocols. If you would like further information about this analysis, we would be pleased to provide it. The CBO staff contacts are Matthew Schmit (in the Budget Analysis Division), and Robie Samanta Roy (in the National Security Division). Sincerely, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Director. [Attachment.] Cost Implications of Implementing the March 26, 2003, NATO Accession Protocols SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION On March 26, 2003, the United States and the other 18 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) signed Protocols of Accession. Once ratified by the governments of the 19 NATO members, those protocols would allow seven more countries--Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia--to join the alliance.\\1\\ The original North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949 by 12 countries. Since then, seven other members have joined NATO, on four separate occasions: Greece and Turkey in 1952; the Federal Republic of Germany in 1955; Spain in 1982; and, most recently, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in 1999. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Those seven countries were formally invited to join NATO at the Prague summit in November 2002. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Member countries bear the direct costs of maintaining the alliance through the contributions that all of them make to NATO's three common budgets--the civil, military, and infrastructure budgets. Those budgets fund NATO headquarters activities as well as common infrastructure projects needed to maintain interoperability between the forces of the member nations. Each member is obligated to pay a prenegotiated share of the common budgets. Last year, those three budgets together totaled about $1.7 billion; the U.S. share of that amount was just under 27 percent, or $442 million. On the basis of data from NATO and the Department of Defense (DOD), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that admitting the seven prospective members into NATO would increase overall costs associated with the common budgets for the 19 current NATO members by about $2.7 billion over the 2004-2013 period. The U.S. share of those costs would total about $650 million over 10 years (assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts)--or about 12 percent more than the United States would otherwise spend to support NATO's common budgets over that period. Besides costs, another important consideration in enlarging NATO is whether the seven prospective members could meet their obligations to the alliance to provide certain military capabilities (obligations commonly referred to as burdensharing). Those obligations include such things as providing a certain level of air-defense capability and being able to deploy military forces rapidly during crises. Although NATO members agree in principle to meet all burdensharing obligations, each country's military programs and level of defense spending are generally left to the country's discretion. Each member's funding depends to a great extent on its long-term military modernization strategy and overall economic situation. One indirect measure of burdensharing is the percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) that a member nation allocates to defense. By that measure, each of the seven prospective members already funds, or is planning to fund, defense at or near the average level of current NATO countries. In recent years, the United States has attempted to help new members modernize their militaries by providing them with grants and loans to purchase military hardware and training. Such assistance is not required, however, and would be subject to the annual authorization and appropriation process of the U.S. Congress. NATO'S COMMON BUDGETS Generally speaking, each NATO member is responsible for the costs associated with maintaining and operating its military forces, even when those forces operate under NATO's command structure. However, certain common costs--such as those associated with headquarters staff and command-and-control capabilities--are financed through the alliance's three common budgets: The civil budget ($174 million in 2002), which pays the cost of NATO's civil headquarters and personnel in Brussels; The military budget ($790 million in 2002), which funds the alliance's military headquarters and activities (including the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium), the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) program, and the NATO command structure for peace keeping activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo; and The infrastructure budget ($693 million in 2002)-- also known as the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP)--which underwrites the costs of common support facilities, including command, control, communications, and intelligence facilities; transportation; storage facilities; and investments in airfields, fuel pipelines, harbors, and navigational aids. Taken together, NATO's common budgets totaled almost $1.7 billion in 2002 (see Table 1). The United States paid nearly 27 percent of that amount, or $442 million. The share that each member pays of each budget is determined by consensus among the members and is periodically renegotiated, particularly when new members join the alliance. The U.S. share of the civil and military budgets has remained fairly constant at around 25 percent since those budgets were established in 1951. Member contributions to the NSIP are more variable, since shares are frequently adjusted to take into account the location and national importance of individual infrastructure projects. Within the U.S. Federal budget, contributions to the three NATO common budgets are provided through three separate appropriations each year. The U.S. contribution to NATO's civil budget is made from the ``Contributions to International Organizations'' account in budget function 150 (international affairs), which is funded through annual appropriations to the Department of State. Similarly, the U.S. contribution to NATO's military budget is made through the ``Operations and Maintenance, Army'' account in the annual Department of Defense appropriation act; and the U.S. contribution to the NSIP is made through a specific appropriation in the annual military construction appropriation act.

Note: AEW&C = Airborne Early Warning and Control; NSIP = NATO Security Investment Program; (*) = between zero and 0.05 percent. \\1\\ NATO's Airborne Early Warning and Control program is part of the military budget. However, it is shown separately here because not all countries contribute to the program, and therefore it has different sharing percentages. COST IMPLICATIONS OF THE LATEST ROUND OF NATO ENLARGEMENT Adding new members to NATO could affect costs to the United States in several ways. First, it would allow current NATO members, including the United States, to spread the costs of the common NATO budgets over more countries. Second, integrating the new members into NATO's military command structure would require up-front costs. Most of those costs would be eligible for funding from NATO's common budgets and therefore would increase costs for current members. Third, the United States might choose to assist the new member countries in modernizing and upgrading their military capabilities. Impact on the U.S. Share of the Common Budgets CBO estimates that adding the seven new members to NATO would most likely reduce the cost share that each country pays to support the three common budgets but the impact of that reduction would be insignificant in percentage terms. When Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic joined the alliance in 1999, the U.S. share of the common budgets declined slightly-- from 28.5 percent overall in 1997 to 26.7 percent in 2002. In that instance, the new members' cost shares were established by NATO's Senior Resource Board and were largely based on each country's GDP. Together, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic currently pay about 3.7 percent of NATO's common budgets. CBO does not expect the U.S. share of the common budgets to decline significantly with the addition of the seven prospective members. Those countries have a combined gross domestic product that is about 40 percent of the total GDP of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Assuming that the seven new members would together contribute about 40 percent of what Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic now pay, CBO estimates that their combined share would amount to about 1.5 percent of the common budgets. In that case, the resulting reduction in the U.S. share would probably be about 0.4 percent. That reduction in the United States' cost share would not necessarily reduce U.S. payments to the common budgets, however. The reason is that the costs of those budgets, especially the NSIP budget, would most likely increase if the seven new members joined NATO. In other words, the slightly smaller percentage share of a larger base amount would probably require current NATO members to contribute more than they do now.
