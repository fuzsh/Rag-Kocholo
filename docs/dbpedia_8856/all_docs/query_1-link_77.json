        "text": "The paper examines the cuneiform evidence from sixth-century Babylonia (and beyond) for information on the form and aims of Neo-Babylonian imperial rule over its western provinces. While new texts, which hitherto have not been considered in this context, can be brought to bear on the issue, direct evidence from these provinces is still scarce. These documents will thus be supplemented by drawing on the rich information concerning state institutions and resource extraction in the imperial centre. It is argued that in the first half of the Neo-Babylonian period, until ca. 585 BCE, Babylonian imperial rule in the western periphery can be conceptualized primarily as a straightforward exploitative tributary regime. From about the mid-reign of Nebuchadnezzar onwards, however, there is a shift towards a more sustainable resource extraction through the creation of stable pockets of Babylonian presence in the periphery. This diachronic shift was meant to steady and organize the initial ad hoc Babylonian approach. These measures, however, did not prevail, and the chaotic years which followed the 43 years reign of Nebuchadnezzar illustrate the fragility of the relatively short-lived Babylonian imperial age.\n\nBabylonia and Assyria were two of the greatest nations the history of mankind has brought forth. These two great Mesopotamian civilizations were best known for their massive armies and instruments of war. This is not surprising, since they were rarely at peace with one another. They were, however, heavily influenced by each other, as well as their predecessors, the Sumerians. Much of what we taken for granted today, the arts and science of industry and invention, were bequeathed to us from these ancient cultures. This two-volume series is remarkable in that it offers an exceedingly comprehensive and detailed looked at ancient Babylonia and Assyria. The way in which these reference works were compiled and written will bring noteworthy enjoyment for the curious reader. These two volumes are based mostly on the archaeological discoveries of the late 19th Century, and are well-referenced and cited with footnotes from that period. As a result, much of what they have to say is timeless, in a sense, because of nature of how the information is presented. For example, randomly thumbing through this 900 page tome and stopping to read a passage will normally result in the reader being completely preoccupied in whatever annals of history is being revealed. As a professor of ancient Oriental literature at Princeton University at the turn of the twentieth century, professor Robert William Rogers provides a competent perspective concerning the past history of Babylonia and Assyria. This book was skillfully written from the author’s vast scholarship and understanding on these subjects. Volume two examines the beginnings of the Assyrian empire, its trials and tribulations, and how it eventually held authority over the Babylonians. The author reveals in meticulous detail each of the kingships as well as the accompanying wars, revolts and rebellions. A considerable amount of space is devoted to the reigns of specific Assyrian kings, including Asshurnazirpal, Shalmaneser, Asshurnirari, Sargon, and many others. Throughout these Assyrian king’s regimes many new cities were founded, and others destroyed, along the banks for the Euphrates river. Also included is a detailed record on the noteworthy conquests, tributes, and building projects of each kingship. This volume also covers the reign of Sennacherib, who ascended to the throne after the mysterious death of Sargon II in 705 B.C.E. As was the case many times with kings in ancient Assyria, Sennacherib was assassinated, leaving his son, Esarhaddon the legal heir to the throne. We owe a great deal of thanks to the next king, Asshurbanapal, for he was devoted to the collection of books in the form of clay tablets. He took great care that his deeds and his wars, his buildings and his very thoughts and hope, should be carefully written down. During his reign it was obvious that the Assyrian empire had started to collapse. Asshurbanapal’s death in 626 B.C.E., began a new revolt by the Babylonians, who, with the help of the Meades,* were finally able to subdue their long-time rivals. This two-volume set concludes with a brief history of the Chaldean empire, whose most famous king, Nebuchadnezzar, helped restore Babylon to its former glory."
