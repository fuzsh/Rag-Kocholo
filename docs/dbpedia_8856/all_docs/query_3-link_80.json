        "text": "The Vacuum created by the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian Empire was filled by the kings of Babylon, who launched military movements to bring broadly of the Fertile Crescent under their control.\n\nThe most known of these kings was Nebuchadnezzar II (604 3 562 BCE), who conquered many lands and people, most notably the conquest of the kingdoms of Israel and Judea. Jerusalem was sacked in 586 BCE, and its inhabitants were forced to move to Babylon 4 a period known in Jewish history as the Babylonian exile or captivity. Nebuchadnezzar II was also responsible for large-scale building projects in Babylon. The course of the Euphrates was changed, temples rebuilt, and monuments celebrating the wealth and prestige of the king were built 4 most notably the Hanging Gardens of Babylon (considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World). Despite this glorious period, the Neo-Babylonian Empire would succumb to a new power arising in the east 4 the Persians 4 in 539 BCE.\n\nPolytheism The peoples of Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent were polytheistic, meaning they worshipped many gods, and each city-state had its own leading god. Examples of well-respected and influential gods in the Sumerian religion included Anu, the god of heaven; Enlil, the god of air; Enki, the god of water; and Ninhursag, the mother goddess. Other peoples, such as the Babylonians and Assyrians, elevated other gods such as Marduk and Assur, kings of the gods; Shamash, the sun god; Sin, the moon god; and Ishtar, goddess of war and love. The Mesopotamian peoples built temples to honor these gods, and each temple had its own priests, who performed a host of tributary ceremonies, festivals, and sacrifices to please the gods.\n\nThe construction of ziggurats, which means \"mountain of god\" or \"hill of heaven,\" is a primary example of an honor intended to please the gods. These monumental\n\nstructures, usually pyramid-shaped and housed temples, and altars, were found at the city's center, and only pastors could enter and attend to the deities.\n\nBecause the Mesopotamians thought that the gods decided all human experiences and acts of nature, and because only the priests had access to the gods, the priest class evolved as honored and mighty. This connection between religion and authority was fueled by environmental and cultural factors.\n\nHebraic Monotheism One peculiar feature in the story and practice of religion in the ancient Near East was monotheism, the view of a single god.\n\nThe antique Hebrews/Jews were the first to promote this belief between 1200 3900 BCE, but acceptance of monotheism was a gradual process. Central to their religion was the god Yahweh, who likely originated in the Canaanite (Phoenician) religion but was embraced by peoples living further south.\n\nThey produced religious literature highlighting the act of creation, genealogies, early histories, the laws for the community, and the centrality of Yahweh.\n\nCollectively, these results are understood as the Torah (the first five books of what would later be called the Old Testament). These books characterize the relationship between Yahweh and his worshippers (the peoples of Israel and Judaea) as a contractual arrangement or \"covenant\" 4 Yahweh would receive adoration while the Jews would take land and evade destruction."
