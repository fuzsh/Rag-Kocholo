        "text": "The Neo-Babylonian empire was built on the ruins of the Assyrian empire after its defeat by the Medes. The Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II set up an alliance with the Medes and expanded the boundaries of the empire from the south of ancient Iraq to Egypt. King Nebuchadnezzar II of Neo-Babylon rebuilt much of the city of Babylon with great palaces and temples and made Babylon the capital of the empire. Babylon became the greatest city of the ancient world with a population reaching 200,000. The city was adorned with magnificent architectural marvels, such as the Ziggurat of Babylon and the northern Gate, the Ishtar Gate.\n\nThe Ziggurat of Babylon, also called Etemenanki, was one of the temples of the national god of Babylon, Marduk. It was magnificently rebuilt by king Nebuchadnezzar II who claims to have raised its top to heaven and made doors for the gates. The ancient Babylonian communities celebrated their national god, Marduk, through various representative means, rituals, and ceremonies, emphasising Marduk's role as the creator of the world and the protector of Babylon. The reconstruction of Etemenanki was the king’s appreciation for the god Marduk who has transcended great power to him. The temples and the walls of Babylon were decorated with sophisticated architectural designs and representational artworks. Marduk’s sacred animals were dragon-like dogs and horses which elegantly adorned the walls of the city. The Babylonian epic poem the “Enuma Elish”, meaning “When on high” or “when above” was recited to mark the Akitu Festival, the Babylonian New Year. The content of the poem illustrates the Babylonian creation myth; it is about the beginning of the universe and the gods’ dispute over the creation of the world and humanity and how Marduk brings order to the chaos and becomes the Lord of the gods. The Babylonian epic poem \"Enuma Elish,\" which glorifies the Babylonian god Marduk, is considered to be a reinterpretation of an earlier Sumerian text that tells the story of the creation myth. The Assyrians and the Chaldeans continue to celebrate Akitu each year on the first day of April, with parades and festivities both in Iraq and within their diasporic communities.\n\nThe city of Babylon during the Neo-Babylonian empire was fortified with a wall with eight gates. One of the most renowned gates for its magnificent construction is the Ishtar Gate, constructed in 575 BCE by king Nebuchadnezzar II. The Ishtar gate is a massive double burnt-brick entrance gate, twelve metres high, decorated with structured glazed brick reliefs, portraying dragon-like animals, lions, and bulls. It was dedicated to the Babylonian goddess of love, war and fertility, Ishtar. The gate was the main entrance to the city of Babylon and was a marvel of ancient architecture, known for its splendour and intricate decorations. Its immense size and elaborate glazed brick reliefs depicting mythological creatures showcased the wealth, power, and artistic prowess of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. As the main entryway to the city of Babylon, the Ishtar Gate was not only a functional structure but also a representation of Babylonian culture. It was a major part of the city's fortification wall and multiple gates and a testament to Babylon's prominence in the ancient world. The ruins of the city of Babylon and the gate are located in the south of Baghdad near the town of Al-Hillah in Babil Governorate."
