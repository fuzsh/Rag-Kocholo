Vanderhooft investigates Babylonian imperialism from two complementary perspectives: from native sources, which project the Babylonian imperial self-portrait, and from the writings of the biblical prophets, which provide a portrait from the perspective of a subjugated population.\n\nNotes:\n\nHarvard Semitic Monographs - HSM 59"
