        "text": "Famed Babylon was a powerful Akkadian city-state in Mesopotamia. Founded in the 3rd millennium BC, it was the capital of a short lived empire under King Hammurabi in the 18th century BCE and later the centre of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.\n\nIt was King Nebuchadnezzar II (604-561 BCE) in particular who turned Babylon into one of the wonders of the ancient world. He built the spectacular Ishtar Gate, the reconstruction of which can be seen in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, and rebuilt the Etemenanki ziggurat - the legendary \"Tower of Babel\". Nebuchadnezzar is also said to have constructed the \"Hanging Gardens\", one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.\n\nIn 539 BC, Babylon fell to Cyrus the Great, King of Persia, and later to Alexander the Great who declared it the capital of his empire. Centuries later, the \"city of cities\" slowly drifted into oblivion."
