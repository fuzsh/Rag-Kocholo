Prosecutors allege that Kim colluded with private equity fund management company OneAsia Partners to artificially inflate SM Entertainment shares above 120,000 won in February 2023, injecting 240 billion won ($174 million) into the market to hinder rival bidder HYBE's acquisition attempt. Kim was initially arrested on 23 Jul and has now been further indicted, with the probe ongoing since February of last year following a formal complaint from HYBE. Speaking at a recent meeting of Kakao affiliates, Kim said \"I believe the truth will eventually be revealed, because I have never instructed or condoned any illegal acts”. Kakao CEO Chung Shin-a addressed Kim’s indictment as the company released its quarterly earnings, saying, \"I acknowledge the shareholders' concerns and [vow] for responsible operation of all services by Kakao and its affiliates.\"\n\nNelly has been arrested at Hollywood Casino in St Charles, Missouri, reportedly for suspected drug possession and an outstanding warrant. The Missouri State Highway Patrol detained the rapper at around 4.45 a.m. on Wednesday after a routine ID check revealed a warrant for lack of insurance from 2018. Scott Rosenblum, Nelly's attorney, claims his client was \"targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer\" who conducted a search \"without probable cause\" and allegedly found ecstasy pills. The lawyer adds that his client \"was not charged with drug possession. He was arrested for 'no proof of insurance' from 2018 on a warrant issued December 2023” of which “he received no notice.\"\n\nStreaming, Digital & Broadcast\n\nKakao Corp's music business unit saw a 6% year-on-year increase in revenue to 510.9 billion won (US$371.6 million) for Q2 2024, driven by robust numbers from artists such as K-pop girl groups IVE and aespa, and boy group Riize. Overall the internet and entertainment company reported a 59.1% increase in its second-quarter net income, reaching 87.1 billion won (US$63.4 million), with total revenue for the quarter at 2 trillion won, up 4.2% year on year. CEO Chung Shin-a announced plans to release an AI communication platform in the second half of 2024, stating, \"We will prioritise developing user-friendly artificial intelligence services as our long-term growth strategy, rather than investing in costly large language models, to increase profitability.\"\n\nTwitch has announced the official launch of its new DJ category today, dubbing the launch \"8.08\" in reference to both today’s date and the iconic Roland TR-808 drum machine. The launch kicks off with a 24-hour global livestream event featuring DJs such as Aluna, BAYNK, Sam Feldt, Sofi Tukker and Zedd. The programme, made possible through partnerships with major labels Universal Music, Warner Music, Sony Music and independent labels and rightsholders represented by Merlin, provides DJs who opt-in with access to a catalogue of rights-cleared music to use in their livestreams. \"Today's DJ category launch is a major moment for Twitch, the music industry and our creators”, says Dan Clancy, CEO of Twitch. “There is something special in the way DJs on Twitch introduce music to their listeners.

CFO of the K-pop company, Jang Jeong-min, explains, \"The increase in consolidated revenue for Q2 was due to growth in album sales and concert revenue. Consolidated operating profit decreased due to an increase in produced content volume and losses from some subsidiaries.\" Album and digital music revenue surged by 32% year-on-year to 71.7 billion won ($52.3 million USD), with new album sales reaching 3.86 million copies. Standout releases included aespa's 'Armageddon' (1.17 million copies), RIIZE's 'Rising' (1.27 million copies), and NCT WISH's 'SongBird' (630,000 copies). Concert revenue skyrocketed by 86% to 37.2 billion won ($27.1 million USD), largely driven by NCT DREAM's fifteen large-scale concerts across Asia.\n\nLive\n\nThe Spanish consumer watchdog has turned its sights on ticketing and music festivals, launching a multi-pronged campaign against perceived abuses in the live entertainment sector. OCU, the Organisation Of Consumers And Users, has filed complaints against Ticketmaster for charging unjustified \"service\" and \"management\" fees on online ticket purchases, which can inflate prices by up to 13% in addition to a €2 fixed charge. The watchdog has also reported seven major music festivals, including Bilbao BBK Live, FIB and Puro Latino, for practices such as prohibiting outside food and drink, charging for re-entry, and imposing short timeframes for cashless wristband refunds. In a broader investigation of online ticket sales, OCU found that booking fees doubled the base ticket price in 28 out of 50 purchases analysed. \"Consumer protection cannot wait,\" says OCU, calling on Spain's General Directorate Of Consumer Affairs to implement strict regulations on booking fees, mandate transparency in communicating charges, and impose sanctions on platforms applying unjustified or disproportionate fees. The consumer group estimates that the festival-related abuses alone could affect up to 947,000 attendees across the reported events.\n\nLauryn Hill has confirmed that her European and UK tour will proceed as planned, despite yesterday’s cancellation of the North American leg. The singer attributed the US cancellation to low ticket sales, which she believes were affected by media \"sensationalism and clickbait headlines\" following her injury-related show postponements last year. Hill emphasised her commitment to performing, saying, \"I can assure you that no one is more disappointed about not being able to perform than I am.\"\n\nOther industry news & events\n\nThe UK’s Featured Artists Coalition and Amazon Music have revealed the ten recipients of the 2024 Step Up Fund, offering grants of up to £8000 to emerging independent artists.

The book, co-written with longtime friend Michael Feinstein, will cover her extensive career, personal struggles, and family legacy. Minnelli says her decision to write the memoir comes after growing frustrated with inaccurate portrayals of her life. \"A sabotaged appearance at the Oscars, in front of billions of people ... a film with twisted half-truths ... a recent miniseries that just didn't get it right. All made by people who didn't know my family, and don't really know me,\" she explains. \"Finally, I was mad as hell! Over dinner one night, I decided, it's my own damn story ... I'm gonna share it with you because of all the love you've given me,\" says Minnelli.\n\nKanye West has blamed alcohol for his controversial 2022 anti-Semitic social media posts, while his former Chief Of Staff has accused the rapper's dentist of supplying him with nitrous oxide for recreational use.
