        "text": "How the pioneer Coastwatchers on New Ireland became operational in WWII\n\nJames Burrowes OAM\n\nPrologue\n\nNow in July 2021, following receipt of an email from a relative of one of the Coastwatchers, I have been prompted to write another chapter for my website, which considers the role played by the original coastwatchers who became operational in World War II.\n\nWhilst their operations are covered in separate sections of Eric Feldt’s book The Coast Watchers, I believe they warrant special individual emphasis, if for no other reason than the fact that they bore the brunt of the Japanese thrust into Australian territorial waters to invade Kavieng in New Ireland and Rabaul in New Britain, and who consequently laid down the foundations of coastwatching in the jungle for those who followed.\n\nSo what follows is a brief account of their individual experiences excerpted from Feldt’s book.\n\nThe Pioneers\n\nCon Page was aged 30, and a plantation manager based on Tabar Island, east of New Ireland, when the Pacific war was declared on 7 December 1941. Con immediately took on his role as a Coastwatcher, and started reporting enemy bomber aircraft heading from Truk to Rabaul and, in late January 1942, reported the Japanese flotilla of warships headed to invade Kavieng and Rabaul. Following this, he spent the next 6 months in enemy held territory with natives, depending on locals and food drops, and reporting Japanese movements, until captured in June 1942 and killed in July.\n\nPage was Mentioned in Despatches for his efforts, to which Feldt devoted pages 69-79 of his book.\n\nBill Kyle and Greg Benham were both District Officers living in Nanatanai, south of Kavieng, when the Japanese invaded. Kyle had a boat of 10 civilian escapees, who were despatched to the Soloman Islands, but he was asked by Port Moresby HQ to remain himself. However, he wanted Benham, who was sick at the time, to also go but ‘Greg was not one to leave his friend… and he would stay’. (Greg was not to know that this loyalty would subsequently cost him his life!)\n\nLeft to their own devices and with few resources, they were joined by a bunch of 10 soldiers who had escaped from Kavieng. The coastwatchers accepted responsibility for caring for the soldiers and sent desperate messages to HQ to drop food supplies and radios. Then followed a grueling five months of jungle survival and another period of six weeks when Kyle and Benham were off the air. When H.J. Murray, a planter who had become a coastwatcher, had acquired a boat which could save 23 persons, Feldt instructed Kyle and Benham to come out, but once again they elected to stay.\n\nSubsequently, however, after the natives had given them up to the Japanese, it was planned to evacuate them by submarine on 30 May 1942. This plan was thwarted by engine trouble, with a later rendezvous arranged, but this was too late to avoid them being captured and killed. (Feldt notes the fact that their rescue submarine was not attacked proving that they had remained silent before being murdered).\n\nBill Kyle and Greg Benham were each posthumously awarded the (British) Distinguished Service Cross and, in his book on pages 80-91, Eric Feldt detailed their operations including a three-page letter from Bill Kyle to Eric.\n\nP/O Cecil Mason, L/Tel J.L. Woodroffe and Chief Yeoman S. Lamont: Mason was infiltrated by submarine onto Anir (east of New Ireland ) to rescue Woodroffe who had been stationed there since relieving Lamont soon after Rabaul had fallen. Unfortunately, however, all three were captured, then killed.\n\nFor the time being, all of the above, except Mason and Lamont, had been commissioned as officers of the Royal Australian Navy, without any naval apprenticeship, with the forlorn hope that the Japanese might treat any captive with respect. This proved to be of no avail as they were all duly murdered.\n\nIn summary, as Commander Eric Feldt stated it (on p.90): ‘Page, Kyle, Benham, Woodroffe and Cecil Mason had played the game to the finish.’\n\nConclusion\n\nHowever, the consequences of their early experiences in real-life enemy occupied jungle territory, including air drops of supplies and the infiltration and extraction of operatives by submarine, were the foundation of future successful operations of the Coastwatchers on New Guinea, New Britain, Bougainville and the Soloman Islands in general, and specifically Guadalcanal.\n\nThis resulted in the repulse and defeat of the Japanese, acknowledged by Admiral ‘Bull’ Halsey who declared that ‘The Coastwatchers saved Guadalcanal and Guadalcanal saved the South Pacific’. As a result, the US Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur was released to pursue his Northern Hemisphere strategies of island-hopping to the outskirts of Japan, and to end the war."
