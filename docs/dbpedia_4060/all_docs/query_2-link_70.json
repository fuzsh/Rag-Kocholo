        "text": "* FEATURES *\n\nTHE COAST WATCHERS-No.3\n\nBill Kyle and Greg Benham\n\nLast Letters From\n\nNew Ireland\n\nBy COLIN SIMPSON\n\nCOURAGEOUS BEYOND telling were all the Austra-\n\nlian Coast Watchers who helped so vitally to save their nation\n\nby remaining behind the Japanese lines in the jungled islands\n\nin the north in never-to-be-forgotten 1942. The story of two\n\nof them, told here to-day, is among the bravest-and most\n\nmoving.\n\nThose two men voluntarily stay-\n\ned on New Ireland, near the north-\n\neastern end of the hidden screen of\n\nwatchers whose radios warned the\n\nAllied forces of Japanese air fleets\n\nflying south and of Japanese war-\n\nships massing for new invasions.\n\nThe two men had been Govern-\n\nment officers on New Ireland. Each\n\nhad a wife named Lilian. Each\n\nsent his wife in the last Allied plane\n\nout--and never saw her again.\n\nFor seven tense months those\n\ntwo men operated in the jungle.\n\nEach was captured by the Japanese ;\n\nonly eighteen hours before the arri-\n\nval of an American submarine to\n\ntake them back to Australia.\n\nThe Australian Navy, which or-\n\nganised the Coast Watchers from\n\namong the civilians in the islands,\n\nhad not many more than a hundred\n\nof them in the field--and at any\n\none time only about 50. Twenty\n\neight of the hundred were caught\n\nand executed by the Japanese or\n\nwent down fighting.\n\nThese men were two of the 28.\n\nAs a very manly small\n\nboy at Toowoomba,\n\nQueensland, where he was\n\nborn, Alan Fairlie Kyle de-\n\ncided that a much better\n\nname for himself was \"Bill.\"\n\nSo Bill Kyle he was,\n\nthrough \"Shore\" college in\n\nSydney and through World\n\nWar 1 —he enlisted at 18.\n\nThen mainland New Guinea\n\nknew him as Patrol Officer\n\nBill Kyle, before he was ap-\n\npointed A.D.O. (Assistant\n\nDistrict Officer) in charge at\n\nNamatanai, on New Ireland.\n\nTo Lilian Frith the very\n\nattractive dark-haired girl he\n\nmet and married on leave in\n\nSydney in 1941, when he had\n\nturned 40, he was Bill. He\n\nstill is, in poignant memory.\n\nThey had only eight months\n\ntogether.\n\nNew Ireland is 200 miles\n\nlong and for most of its\n\nmountain-lined length, less\n\nthan 20 miles wide. Nothing\n\nabout it recalls old Ireland,\n\nunless it be that its shape is\n\nlike a shillelagh.\n\nNamatanai is on the top\n\ncoast where New Ireland be-\n\ngins to broaden into its cud-\n\ngel-head, at the end of a\n\npalms-sea-and-jungle road that\n\nruns down from Kavieng and\n\nis the loveliest island road I\n\nknow. Down there Bill Kyle\n\nwas the Government.\n\nLilian went with him on\n\na long patrol by canoe,\n\nrippling into beaches where\n\nthe coconut palms dreamed in\n\ncoral-coloured shallows and\n\nthe offshore islets were cut\n\nout of opal and the villagers\n\nstill grow tanket, with the\n\nleaves like red-purple spears,\n\nas a magic plant. \"At least,\"\n\nshe says, \"we had that.\"\n\nKeep One Bullet\n\nFor Himself\n\nTHEN Japan's war crashed\n\nacross the Pacific from\n\nPearl Harbour, and sounded\n\nthe certainty that the enemy\n\nwould come to all these\n\nshores, like a tidal wave.\n\nLilian Kyle was in the last\n\nplane out of New Ireland\n\nwith other evacuated women.\n\nThey had kissed good-bye,\n\nwith Lilian smiling and Bill\n\nseeing the fear behind her\n\neyes.\n\n\"Don't worry, sweet.\"\n\n\"No, Bill.\"\n\n\"You think the Nips'll grab\n\nme and have me growing rice\n\nin Japan,\" He laughed. \"Not\n\na chance.\"\n\nShe knew he had a horror\n\nof being taken prisoner and\n\n\"growing rice in Japan,\" but\n\nshe could think of something\n\nworse.\n\n\"Bill, if you have to stay on\n\nhere as a Coast Watcher you\n\nwon't be just a civilian will\n\nyou--a spy? I know what\n\nhappens when spies are\n\ncaught ...\"\n\nHe said she mustn't ever\n\nthink like that. Eric Feldt\n\nwould see to it that they got\n\nServices rank--wasn't the O.C.\n\nCoast Watchers Bill's closest\n\nfriend? As for the other thing\n\n--being taken alive and done\n\nthings to and done to death\n\nby the enemy--she had better\n\nknow that that would never\n\nhappen.\n\n\"I'd always have one bullet\n\nleft.\n\nCommander E.

Help\n\nCommander E. A. Feldt,\n\nR.A.N., who organised\n\nand controlled the Coast\n\nWatchers' operations.\n\nTHE first letter his wife re-\n\nceived was written in pen-\n\ncil, with obvious haste and\n\nwas sent out with the first of\n\ntwo parties of civilians Kyle\n\nsucceeded in evacuating (and\n\nwho, probably, owe their lives\n\nto him) from the southern-\n\nmost extremity of the island.\n\nCape St. George,\n\n2/2/42.\n\nDarling Baby,\n\nYou will have heard\n\nfrom Eric that everything\n\nis O.K.\n\n[Meaning that Lieut. Comman-\n\nder Feldt had seen to it that,\n\nas a Coast Watcher, Kyle was\n\nno longer a civilian; he had\n\nbeen given the Navy rank of\n\nLieutenant, R.A.N.V.R.]\n\nWe managed to get the\n\nparty [to be evacuated] as\n\nfar as this and I got a\n\nboat [for them] after a\n\nlot of trouble. They are\n\nall going to Tulagi. But I\n\nhave been asked to stay\n\nand radio-report ship-\n\nping, etc.\n\n[Japanese shipping en route to\n\nRabaul, which is only 40\n\nmiles away across St. George's\n\nChannel, had to pass New\n\nIreland, and Rabaul-bound\n\naircraft had to fly across it.\n\nRabaul had fallen to the\n\nenemy the week before.\n\nGreg has volunteered to\n\nstay with me — good kid.\n\nGreg was Gregory Wade Ben-\n\nham, Patrol Officer under\n\nA.D.O. Kyle at Namatanai.\n\nWe will be up in the\n\nbush a bit, and quite safe,\n\nso don't you worry. Look\n\nafter mother and don't let\n\nher worry either. Eric\n\nwill see that we don't get\n\nleft.

Without it, batteries\n\nwould be flat and could not\n\npower the teleradio, two-way\n\ntelephonic transmitter-receiver\n\nequipment Coast Watchers\n\nwere provided with by Navy:\n\nit weighed, in all, over 300lb.\n\nWe have plenty of food\n\nfor months and a good\n\nspot picked out.

Then\n\nthe great dark wave of sea\n\ninvaders — 25 warships, trans-\n\nports, minesweepers, more\n\ndestroyers, two carriers, and\n\nanother cruiser. They knew\n\nthen that Rabaul's fate would\n\nsoon be New Ireland's too:\n\nAt that stage Benham was\n\nnot a Coast Watcher. Kyle\n\nwas, but he had not been\n\nasked to remain on the be-\n\nleaguered island and report.\n\nWhat does the mountain\n\nclimber do when he knows an\n\navalanche is imminent? Bill\n\nKyle's answer was: \"Get every\n\nbody you can out of the way.\"\n\nHe and Benham set off\n\nCommander E. A.

Kyle\n\nthought the signal was from\n\nme, his closest friend, so im-\n\nmediately acceded\n\nThis decision was for him-\n\nself not for Benham, who\n\nwas sick at the time.\n\nKyle suggested that Ben-\n\nham should go (in the evacu-\n\nation launch to the Solomons),\n\nbut Greg Benham was not\n\none to leave his friend.

His\n\nheadmaster, Mr. W. I. Phil-\n\nlips, remembers well a boy he\n\ndescribes as shy, modest and\n\nsincere, who was the champion\n\nathlete of Dubbo High\n\nSchool :—\n\nMy favourite memory of\n\nGreg is of a tall, flan-\n\nnelled figure at the wicket\n\nwith a grim smile on his\n\nface, holding up an end on\n\na bad pitch at his captain's\n\nbehest; then, the danger\n\npast, opening out to play\n\nthe bowling and win the\n\nmatch.\n\nHe married his Dubbo\n\nsweetheart, Lilian Bruce. Both\n\nwives, two Lilians, were in\n\nthat last plane out of New\n\nIreland.\n\nThe Patrol Officer was tall,\n\nthe A.D.O. short and stocky.\n\nBill Kyle was the more defi-\n\nnite, less compromising per-\n\nsonality. Benham was quietly\n\nspoken, with very good man-\n\nners.\n\nWith Rabaul in enemy\n\nhands, the Coast Watchers\n\nlooking across St. George's\n\nChannel from their hideout\n\non the jungled promontory of\n\nCape St. George, were invalu-\n\nCommander E.

A Catalina\n\ndropped food and a Hudson\n\nbomber parachuted down a\n\nnew radio receiver to Kyle\n\nand Benham in March, 1942.\n\nThe Hudson dropping the\n\nradio-this had to be a day-\n\nlight job-was fired on by\n\nthree Japanese destroyers an-\n\nchored near Cape St. George.\n\nThese ships landed 50 men.\n\nA native led the Japanese to\n\nwhere Kyle and Benham were\n\non the ridge. The enemy,\n\nsplit into three parties,\n\nsneaked in past the Coast\n\nWatchers' guard.\n\nHow the Coast Watchers\n\nsurvived the attack is told in\n\nanother letter Bill Kyle got\n\nout to his wife, with the\n\nsecond, and last, party of\n\ncivilian evacuees:—\n\nNEW IRELAND,\n\n28/4/42.\n\nMY DARLING,\n\nOne more letter — I\n\nwish to God you would get\n\nme instead of it.\n\nWe are still going\n\nstrong and could get\n\naway now with another\n\ngroup we have collected,\n\nand a small boat, but the\n\nNavy has asked us to stay\n\nagain — we may be of\n\nvalue later.\n\nWe were chased out of\n\nour original place in the\n\nbush —lost everything. A\n\ntroop of Japs were led to\n\nour hideout by a treacher-\n\nous native, and they got\n\nwithin 20 feet of us.\n\nGreg saw them first,\n\nand I had to break\n\nthrough the side of the\n\nhut to get away — they\n\ncouldn't see me in time to\n\nshoot.\n\n[In a letter written at the\n\nsame time to Commander\n\nEric Feldt, Kyle says: \"I had\n\nto break through the side of\n\nthe hut and dive down the\n\nmountain. They couldn't\n\nshoot for the hut.\"]\n\nWe walked back to\n\nBopire — about 120 miles\n\n— with nothing but a\n\nshirt, shorts and shoes.\n\nBegged a bit of food on\n\nthe way.\n\nWe were only in Bopire\n\nfour days when 80 of them\n\nchased us again — got\n\nwithin 30 yards of us, but\n\ndidn't follow into the\n\nbush.\n\n[To Feldt: \"Then eighty\n\nJaps came in cars and trucks\n\nfrom Kavieng —and got right\n\non to us . . . we walked out\n\nof the back steps as they\n\ncame in the front, and that\n\nnight they again got within\n\n30 yards of us. They are mug\n\nbushmen — won't go in —or\n\nwe would never have got\n\naway.\"]\n\nWe have cleared out\n\nanother 80 miles and have\n\ngot some food, etc. to-\n\ngether, also a radio, so we\n\nmay be of some value.\n\n[To Feldt: \"We heard you\n\nhad dropped gear at Metlik.\n\nWe sent down and got the\n\nradio . . .

Of course we (you\n\nand I) have lost all our\n\nstuff, but that is better\n\nthan planting rice in\n\nJapan — we can get more.\n\nThank God all the people\n\ngot away in time.\n\nOn the same day, Greg\n\nBenham wrote to his family:\n\nStill going strong —\n\nnow as a Sub-Lieutenant\n\nR.A.N.V.R., of course-but\n\nwondering how you loved\n\nones are.\n\nI am quite well and have\n\ncome through three dark\n\nmonths since last writing\n\nto you--by Divine Guid-\n\nance — t's all been so won-\n\nderful.\n\nUp to the last message a\n\nfew hours ago I thought I\n\nwould be coming on the\n\nsmall boat that takes this\n\nand attempts to make a\n\ngetaway carrying 19 civi-\n\nlians and soldiers and cov-\n\nering 300 miles open sea\n\nbut Navy told Kyle and I\n\nto remain, hence the hurried\n\nnote.\n\nAll the thrills and esca-\n\npades will keep you going\n\nfor hours when I get down.\n\nIt's great feeling getting\n\nthe rank and being attached\n\nto Naval Intelligence. . . .\n\nAlthough we are on our\n\nknees now, it won't be for\n\nlong, as we'll burst through\n\nthese cruel Oriental swine.\n\nEverything still under\n\ncontrol.\n\nDearest love to your three\n\nloved ones — Greg.\n\nTo Commander Feldt, Kyle\n\nalso wrote:\n\nDon't worry about us\n\nwith extra food and medi-\n\ncines we can last for months\n\nunless there is more patrol\n\nactivity than there has been\n\nup to date.

The wives, Lilian Kyle and Lilian Benham, who were evacuated in the last plane out of New Ireland. Greg Benham (above) and Bill Kyle (right), Coast Watchers, caught in Japanese occupied New Ireland, and executed. Kyle broke through the side of the hut and dived down the mountain. . Help\n\na native who was wearing a\n\nJapanese armband with a ris-\n\ning sun emblem. The native\n\ndenied all knowledge of Coast\n\nWatchers, but said there was\n\na Japanese post nearby. So\n\nMason knew that Kyle and\n\nBenham would not be in that\n\nvicinity. He returned to the\n\nsubmarine.\n\nThe submarine went east\n\nto the island of Anir, where\n\nthere was a Coast Watcher\n\nnamed J. L. Woodroffe, a\n\nNavy telegraphist, whom the\n\nNavy also wanted to bring\n\nout.\n\nMason went ashore and\n\ngave a native, who said Wood-\n\nroffe was alive and in the\n\nbush, a note for him to be at\n\nthis spot at to-morrow mid-\n\nnight.\n\nA light showed from the\n\nshore the next night, but\n\nMason, who had no sleep for\n\n36 hours, was too physically\n\nspent to go in until the next\n\nnight, when he landed again\n\nabout 10 o'clock.\n\nThe submarine moved out\n\ninto the darkness, to return at\n\nmidnight. On its way in a\n\nJapanese patrol boat was\n\nspotted. The submarine sub-\n\nmerged until 2 a.m., when the\n\ncoast was clear.\n\nThere was no signal from\n\nthe shore, no sign of Mason\n\nor Woodroffe. The com-\n\nmander could not stay and\n\nlet dawn reveal his subma-\n\nrine. He slid out to sea\n\nagain.\n\nEach night for four nights\n\nthe submarine returned to the\n\nrendezvous place. No light\n\ncame from the dark jungled\n\nshore.\n\nIt was not until a year later\n\nthat a captured Japanese\n\ndocument revealed that Mason\n\nand Woodroffe had been cap-\n\ntured by the Japanese.\n\nTheir fate was unknown\n\nuntil a priest, a prisoner at\n\nRabaul, told how he had seen\n\nthe pilot officer and the Navy\n\ntelegraphist he had gallantly\n\ntried to rescue taken out of\n\nthe compound by the Japanese.\n\nThough they were Service-\n\nmen, they were killed. The\n\nmanner of their execution we\n\ndo not know.\n\nTheir clothing was brought\n\nback and thrown into the\n\ncompound, the priest said.\n\nMEANWHILE, Kyle and\n\nBenham . . .\n\nOnly from small and scat-\n\ntered pieces of information\n\ncan their tragedy be pieced\n\ntogether.\n\nTheir radio was silent, had\n\nbeen for many weeks before\n\nMason came in the American\n\nsubmarine to look for them.\n\nWhen Mason did not return,\n\nsupplies were air-dropped\n\nregularly to a native village\n\nknown to be friendly and\n\nloyal.\n\nOne of the pieces in the\n\nmosaic of their final story is\n\na Roman Catholic missionary,\n\na German, an old man, full\n\nbearded Father Neuhaus.\n\nApparently he helped them,\n\ngave them information of\n\nJapanese patrols, sent a native\n\nto them with messages and\n\nfood.\n\nThey were hiding in a cave.\n\nOn his way to the cave,\n\nwith a note from Father\n\nNeuhaus, the native was cap-\n\ntured. The Japanese made\n\nthe native lead their patrol to\n\nthe cave.\n\nIt appears that Kyle and\n\nBenham were asleep when the\n\nenemy came. There was no\n\nchance for Bill Kyle to using\n\nthe \"last bullet\" he had told,\n\nLilian he would keep for him-\n\nself.\n\n\"More than a year later,\"\n\nsays Commander Feldt, \"we\n\nfound out that Kyle and Ben-\n\nham had been captured just\n\n18 hours before they were\n\nto be picked up. That the\n\nsubmarine had not been at-\n\ntacked at the rendezvous\n\nshows that they had kept\n\nsilence in the face of ques-\n\ntioning — Jap questioning.\"\n\nThey were taken up the\n\nisland to Kavieng.\n\nOut in Kavieng's beautiful\n\nharbour, where the water on\n\na sunbright morning is like\n\nblue satin, there is a small\n\nislet with a beach of the\n\nwhitest sand, some coconut\n\npalms and a grove of casua-\n\nrina trees. It is called Naga.\n\nAlready the bones of one\n\nCoast Watcher — Sub-Lieutent-\n\nant Cornelius Lyons Page, the\n\nhero of Tabar Island, the very\n\ngallant ex-trader and planter,\n\nwhom the Japanese hunted\n\nwith dogs and natives and fin-\n\nally caught — lay on Naga.\n\nHe was brought there and\n\nexecuted about July 21, 1942.\n\nCon Page had a helper, an\n\nelderly planter named Jack\n\nTalmadge. The Japanese had\n\ncaptured him, too.\n\nKyle and Benham and Tal-\n\nmadge were taken across from\n\nKavieng to Naga Island about\n\nSeptember 1.\n\nNow In A Common\n\nGrave\n\nTHE manner of their ex-\n\necution is said to have\n\nbeen by shooting, not by be-\n\nheading as has been reported.\n\nFather Neuhaus is believed\n\nto have been executed there,\n\ntoo.\n\nWhen the tide turned and\n\nswept the Japanese from these\n\nshores, an Australian party\n\nlanded at and reoccupied\n\nKavieng. From something\n\nheard from natives, they went\n\nacross to Naga."
