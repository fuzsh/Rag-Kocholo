        "text": "The proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment has potential negative economic and health consequences. Thus, previous investigations have targeted wild animals to understand the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in diverse environmental sources. In this critical review and synthesis, we summarized important concepts learned through the sampling of wildlife for antibiotic-resistant indicator bacteria. These concepts are helpful for understanding dissemination of resistance through environmental pathways and helping to guide future research efforts. Our review begins by briefly introducing antibiotic resistance as it pertains to bacteria harbored in environmental sources such as wild animals. Next, we differentiate wildlife from other animals in the context of how diverse taxa provide different information on antibiotic resistance in the environment. In the third section of our review, we identify representative research and seminal works that illustrate important associations between the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wildlife and anthropogenic inputs into the environment. For example, we highlight numerous investigations that support the premise that anthropogenic inputs into the environment drive the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria harbored by free-ranging wildlife. Additionally, we summarize previous research demonstrating foraging as a mechanism by which wildlife may be exposed to anthropogenic antibiotic resistance contamination in the environment. In the fourth section of our review, we summarize molecular evidence for the acquisition and dissemination of resistance among bacteria harbored by wildlife. In the fifth section, we identify what we believe to be important data gaps and potential future directions that other researchers may find useful toward the development of efficient, informative, and impactful investigations of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wildlife. Finally, we conclude our review by highlighting the need to move from surveys that simply identify antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wildlife toward hypothesis-driven investigations that: 1) identify point sources of antibiotic resistance; 2) provide information on risk to human and animal health; 3) identify interventions that may interrupt environmentally mediated pathways of antibiotic resistance acquisition and transmission; and 4) evaluate whether management practices are leading to desirable outcomes.\n\nChlamydia psittaci typically infects birds and can cause outbreaks of avian chlamydiosis, but it also has the potential to cause zoonotic disease (psittacosis) in humans. To better understand the epidemiology of C. psittaci in Victoria, Australia, we conducted opportunistic sampling of more than 400 wild and captive birds presented to the Australian Wildlife Health Centre at Zoos Victoria's Healesville Sanctuary for veterinary care between December 2014 and December 2015. Samples were screened for the presence of chlamydial DNA using quantitative PCR, and positive samples were subjected to multilocus sequence typing analysis. The results showed a significantly higher prevalence of infection in captive birds (8%; 9/113) compared to wild birds (0.7%; 2/299). Multilocus sequence typing analysis revealed that C. psittaci sequence type 24 was detected in both wild and captive birds in the local region, while C. psittaci sequence type 27 was detected for the first time in an Australian avian host. The generally low prevalence of C. psittaci detection points to a generally low zoonotic risk to veterinary and support staff, although this risk may be higher when handling captive birds, where the prevalence of C. psittaci infection was almost 10-fold higher. Even with low rates of C. psittaci detection, appropriate hygiene and biosecurity practices are recommended due to the serious human health implications of infection with this pathogen.\n\nCold-stress syndrome (CSS) is one of the leading natural threats to free-ranging Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris). Cold water exposure below the species' acceptable physiologic range is a frequent occurrence for manatees during cold weather months causing CSS-induced systemic illness and significant annual mortality. Although CSS is a commonly presented condition at manatee rehabilitation facilities, the core body temperatures in CSS manatees are currently unknown due to the lack of clinically applicable and accurate temperature measurement methodologies. Our objective was to establish a clinically applicable measurement methodology of core body temperature in manatees. A novel, minimally invasive temperature technique to obtain esophageal temperature by placing a temperature sensor through an oro-gastric tube was compared to current oral and nasal methods in 20 clinically healthy manatees. Results identified the esophageal measurement as the best performing and most precise temperature methodology. The superior performance of esophageal temperature measurements differed significantly from both nasal and oral measurements, while nasal and oral measurements did not differ when compared with each other. The esophageal measurements were consistent with manatee core body temperature, facilitating generation of a reference interval for core body temperature in healthy manatees (35.0–35.8 C). Four CSS medical cases were evaluated with the newly validated esophageal temperature method, facilitating diagnosis of hypothermia. The application of this temperature measurement technique to CSS manatees in field or rehabilitation settings will help in understanding CSS pathophysiology, improve medical assessments during rehabilitation, and contribute to conservation efforts.\n\nOver 2 yr, we assessed the health of 35 lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) in the Brazilian Cerrado (CE) biome, an area that is highly affected by human activities. This involved physical examinations, hematology and blood biochemistry, urinalysis, fecal parasitologic evaluation, microbial profiling of anatomic cavities and lesions, and serologic surveys for evidence of infectious agents. Research methods closely resembled those used in previous tapir health assessments in the Atlantic Forest (AF) and Pantanal (PA) biomes, allowing for a comparison among the three populations. Although not reaching statistical significance (P>0.05), tapirs from the CE exhibited poorer body and skin condition as compared to animals from the AF and PA. Furthermore, there were higher prevalences of dental problems and traumatic lesions as compared to those from the AF and PA. Eight of the 12 hematologic parameters evaluated and 17 of the 30 biochemical parameters differed significantly (P<0.05) between the tapirs from CE and those from the AF and PA. We isolated 24 different microbiologic strains from swabs of anatomic cavities and dermal lesions, of which five taxa had not previously been found in the AF or PA. We detected serum antibodies to Leptospira interrogans, bluetongue virus, and porcine parvovirus. Overall, our results suggested that tapirs from the CE exhibited more health abnormalities than tapirs in the AF and PA, possibly due to a greater exposure to environmental disturbances in the area.\n\nDuring 2014, highly pathogenic (HP) influenza A viruses (IAVs) of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage (GsGD-HP-H5), originating from Asia, were detected in domestic poultry and wild birds in Canada and the US. These clade 2.3.4.4 GsGD-HP-H5 viruses included reassortants possessing North American lineage gene segments; were detected in wild birds in the Pacific, Central, and Mississippi flyways; and caused the largest HP IAV outbreak in poultry in US history. To determine if an antibody response indicative of previous infection with clade 2.3.4.4 GsGD-HP-H5 IAV could be detected in North American wild waterfowl sampled before, during, and after the 2014–15 outbreak, sera from 2,793 geese and 3,715 ducks were tested by blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests using both clade 2.3.4.4 GsGD-HPH5 and North American lineage low pathogenic (LP) H5 IAV antigens. We detected an antibody response meeting a comparative titer-based criteria (HI titer observed with 2.3.4.4 GsGD-HP-H5 antigens exceeded the titer observed for LP H5 antigen by two or more dilutions) for previous infection with clade 2.3.4.4 GsGD-HP-H5 IAV in only five birds, one Blue-winged Teal (Spatula discors) sampled during the outbreak and three Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and one Canada Goose (Branta canadensis) sampled during the post-outbreak period. These serologic results are consistent with the spatiotemporal extent of the outbreak in wild birds in North America during 2014 and 2015 and limited exposure of waterfowl to GsGD-HP-H5 IAV, particularly in the central and eastern US.\n\nWe determined the temporal aspects of detecting bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) in postmortem bone marrow samples of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) using molecular and in vitro cell culture techniques. Bone marrow samples from carcasses were collected and assayed on the day of death and at intervals up to 16 wk after death. We recovered BTV and EHDV from fresh bone marrow collected at day 0 by isolation in Vero and BHK-21 cell cultures. However, attempts to replicate the viruses from aged bone marrow in Vero and BHK-21 cell cultures failed. The real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) results confirmed that EHDV and BTV can be detected in aged bone marrow for up to 12 and 16 wk, respectively, after death. The RNA of BTV and EHDV could be detected by qRT-PCR in white-tailed deer bone marrow for extended periods of time postmortem. This technique will provide a useful tool for retrospective determination of BTV or EHDV infection of white-tailed deer at the time of death.\n\nDespite being the most numerous penguin species in South America, exposure of the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) to pathogens has not yet been thoroughly assessed. We collected serum from 1,058 Magellanic Penguins at 10 breeding colonies along the entire latitudinal range of this species in Argentina. The work spanned 10 breeding seasons over 15 yr (1994–2008). Sera were tested for antibodies to select infectious agents. Antibodies reacting against 16 pathogens were detected (seroprevalence): Aspergillus sp. (15.1%), Chlamydia psittaci (6.5%), Salmonella Pullorum (3.1%), Salmonella Typhimurium (81.3%), Aviadenovirus sp. (18.1%), Duck atadenovirus A (23.6%), Anatid herpesvirus 1 (0.7%), Avian orthoreovirus (3.3%), Avian coronavirus M41 (43.5%), Avian coronavirus C46 (59.8%), Avian coronavirus A99 (37.4%), Avian coronavirus JMK (40.2%), Tremovirus A (0.3%), Avian avulavirus 1 (44.0%), Avian avulavirus 2 (43.8%), and Avian avulavirus 3 (46.6%). No antibodies were detected against nine infectious agents: Gallid alphaherpesvirus 1, Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2, Infectious bursal disease virus, Avastrovirus 2, West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, and Influenza A virus. While restricted by limitations inherent to serological methods, our results provide baseline knowledge for a key species in the South Atlantic Ocean. This information is valuable for adaptive conservation management in a time of increasing environmental stressors affecting the Patagonian Sea, one of the world's richest pelagic seabird communities.\n\nDeclining population sizes of koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) in SE Queensland (QLD), Australia can partially be attributed to chlamydiosis, with the majority of epidemiological studies focusing on the prevalence of infection and associated pathology in female koalas, with lesser attention given to males. We aimed to explore the epidemiology of Chlamydia pecorum infection in the male urogenital tract from wild (hospitalized and free-ranging) koalas in SE QLD. Although 67% of male koalas were infected with C. pecorum in their urogenital tract and 55% were shedding the organism in their semen, only a third of the males sampled presented with overt signs of urogenital disease. Infection with C. pecorum was lower in populations from rural locations, compared with periurban locations, with a corresponding low association between urogenital infection and clinical disease. The presence of C. pecorum in penile urethral swabs was a good predictor of the presence of C. pecorum in semen, with a significant correlation (P=0.006) in 58% of males. In contrast, the C. pecorum load in penile urethral swabs was not a good predictor of the C. pecorum load in semen, with no significant correlation. In addition, 57% of male koalas had large numbers of bacterial copy numbers in the penile urethra (upper quartile) and 40% shedding into semen with no overt signs of disease. Investigation of the association of C. pecorum infection, body condition score, and age revealed that the highest incidence of urogenital infection occurred in males with the lowest body score (1 out of 10). Furthermore, 63% of sexually mature male koalas (>2 yr old) had urethral infections and 50% had C. pecorum in their semen. Our study suggested that the role of chlamydia in male koala infertility has been previously underestimated.\n\nThe only known outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in wildlife in the US occurred in mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in California in 1924–25. There is little recorded information on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the disease in deer in that outbreak. In this experimental study, we compared the susceptibility of mule deer to FMD virus (FMDV) serotype O to that of cattle (Bos taurus). We also determined the potential for intra- and interspecies transmission of FMDV serotype O in mule deer and cattle, and assessed conventional laboratory tests in their ability to detect FMDV in mule deer. Two mule deer and one steer were each infected by intraepithelial tongue inoculation with 10,000 bovine tongue infective doses of FMDV, strain O1 Manisa. The inoculated steer and deer were kept in the same room with contact animals of both species. Exposed contact animals were moved to rooms with unexposed animals after becoming febrile. All mule deer (n=14) and cattle (n=6) developed clinical signs and lesions consistent with FMDV infection. Deer had a high prevalence of myocarditis and high mortality. Virus was transmitted between mule deer, from cattle to mule deer, and from mule deer to cattle. Virus and antibodies against nonstructural FMDV proteins in mule deer and cattle were detected by conventional laboratory tests. Virus shedding was detected by PCR and virus isolation up to 9 d postexposure in deer.\n\nWe found the ear mite parasite (Otodectes cynotis; Acari: Psoroptidae) in two distant insular endangered fox populations in Chile. We identified O. cynotis in both the Darwin's fox (Pseudalopex fulvipes) from Chiloé and the Fuegian culpeo (Pseudalopex culpaeus lycoides) in Tierra del Fuego. These populations are approximately 2,000 km apart. Infestation rates were high for both endemic foxes: 76% (19/25) of Darwin's foxes were affected, and 73% (11/15) of Fuegian culpeos had ear mites. Two Darwin's foxes had abundant ear discharge, and one of these also exhibited secondary infections of Morganella morganii and Geotrichum sp. fungi. Mites were characterized molecularly as Otodectes spp. for the Fuegian culpeo samples. Genetic analyses of two mites found the O. cynotis genotype I, as well as what appeared to be a new allele sequence for O. cynotis. These results confirmed the hypothesis of a worldwide distribution species of ear mite. Introduced chilla foxes (Pseudalopex griseus; n=11) on Tierra del Fuego Island and domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris; n=379) from both islands were also sampled, but they showed no signs of infection. Our findings provided insight into the genetic diversity, the origins, and the possible impact of this globally distributed mite on endemic free-ranging populations of foxes.\n\nChanging climatic conditions and the northward expansion of ticks and pathogens are of immense importance to human, animal, and environmental health assessment and risk management. From 2014 through 2015, a wildlife rehabilitation center in south-central Arizona, US noted soft ticks (Argasidae) infesting 23 birds, including Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii), Gray Hawks (Buteo plagiatus), Harris's Hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus), Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus), Common Ravens (Corvus corax), and a Greater Roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus), during the late summer seasonal rainy seasons. The parasites numbered in the hundreds on individual birds. Infested birds were moribund, obtunded, or paralyzed on presentation, with no prior histories of illness or evidence of trauma. Tick and avian blood samples were collected for vector-borne pathogen analysis focusing on the molecular detection of Rickettsia and Borrelia species. Ticks were identified as the neotropical species of soft tick, Argas (Persicargas) giganteus; their occurrence in the southern US on raptors represented an expansion of host range. Pathogen testing of ticks showed that 41% of 54 ticks were infected with Rickettsia hoogstraalii and 23% of 26 ticks were infected with a relapsing fever Borrelia; both agents are associated with uncertain health consequences. Among the blood samples, one was infected with the same Borrelia spp.; this Red-tailed Hawk also had Borrelia-positive ticks. With supportive therapy, the majority of birds, 74% (17/23), recovered and were released or permanent residents. The management of soft tick–infested birds and mitigation of future disease risk will require additional characterizations of these poorly studied soft ticks and their associated pathogens.\n\nMore than 460 cases of sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) in endangered San Joaquin kit foxes (SJKF; Vulpes macrotis mutica) have been reported in Bakersfield, California, US. Because SJKF are a den-obligate species, their dens have been proposed as a route of transmission. We determined whether SJKF den temperatures and humidities could support mite off-host survival based on previously published estimates of off-host mite survival times. We monitored SJKF dens for 6 d in summer and winter of 2017 and 2018 using temperature- and humidity-sensing data loggers placed within the dens. Motion-triggered cameras monitored animal use of and entrances into the dens. Linear regression models were fitted to the published mite survival data to predict estimated mite survival time (EMST) in SJKF dens based on observed mean temperature and humidity of the den. Den covariates including irrigation, type of den, and season were then fitted to a mixed effects linear model to predict EMST. The average EMST across various habitats in Bakersfield was 4.8 d; the longest EMST was 7.1 d for dens in habitats with irrigated grass in the winter. Den climatic conditions in Bakersfield may support off-host mite survival through a timeframe adequate for revisitation by another fox. The finding that irrigation may enhance EMST suggested that risk to foxes varied with den type and that mitigation strategies may need to vary with den types.\n\nTrypanosoma cruzi is a vector-borne, protozoal parasite of mammals. Infected humans, dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), and nonhuman primates may remain asymptomatic or may develop Chagas disease, most commonly characterized by lymphoplasmacytic myocarditis with myocardial degeneration and fibrosis, ultimately resulting in heart failure. Although wildlife species have important roles as sylvatic reservoirs, investigations into the pathology of T. cruzi in wildlife are limited to a few studies documenting histologic lesions in opossums (Didelphis spp.) and raccoons (Procyon lotor). Pathology in coyotes (Canis latrans) has not, to our knowledge, been described, despite their recognition as a reservoir and close genetic relationship to domestic dogs. Our objectives were to perform a detailed, comparative cardiac pathology study of sympatric, naturally infected coyotes and raccoons, to characterize the overall T. cruzi infection prevalence in the heart and blood of each species via PCR, and to identify infecting discrete typing units (DTUs). We sampled hunter-harvested coyotes (n=120) and raccoons (n=24) in a 28 county region of central and south Texas, US. Raccoons were significantly more likely to have positive PCR results (P<0.001) with a prevalence of 62% (15/24), comprising DTU TcIV exclusively, with mild to no evidence of cardiac pathology. In contrast, coyotes had a lower infection prevalence (8%, 10/120), comprising DTU TcI exclusively, with lymphoplasmacytic myocarditis observed in four of the six PCR-positive animals. Many raccoons had PCR-positive blood and heart tissue simultaneously, supporting previous reports that raccoons maintain parasitemia into chronic stages of infection; in contrast, none of the PCR-positive coyotes were positive in both heart and blood. Our findings demonstrate marked differences in T. cruzi infection dynamics between coyotes and raccoons, with important implications for reservoir potential and their role in transmission cycles.\n\nEntanglement occurs when a marine turtle becomes trapped within anthropogenic materials such as debris or fishery gear, inducing strangulation of anatomical parts such as flippers or the neck, causing deep lacerations, maiming, amputation, or choking. Often, severely entangled flippers in captured or stranded turtles are removed surgically. Turtles with flipper impairment have difficulty in swimming, diving, and feeding. Our aim was to use color Doppler ultrasound and multi-detector computer tomography to evaluate residual vascularization or neovascularization in severely entangled flippers of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) to assess viability of flippers, even in the absence of limb sensation. We studied 12 turtles with either unilateral (n=8) or bilateral (n=4) involvement. A total of 14 flippers were severely entangled and two flippers were spontaneously amputated. Only two of the 14 entangled flippers had to be removed surgically. For 12 entangled flippers, after surgical curettage, the treatment protocol was based on the use of a plant-derived commercial dressing. The animals were monitored and treated for 1–3 mo, until the soft tissue defects were completely healed by secondary intention. Interestingly, in the treated animals the healing flippers steadily recovered motility and sensation, restoring the complete functionality of the flipper. Vascularization of the limb was found to be critical to prevent amputation of entangled flippers, preserving the flipper and its functionality with conservative therapy and avoiding amputation as much as possible. Our study showed that in cases of entanglement, amputation does not need to be performed immediately but can wait for nonviability to declare itself following conservative therapy and should be reserved as a last-resort treatment.\n\nLead and zinc are recognized as the most widespread trace metals in nature and can, at high levels, compromise the health of wildlife and their habitat. Because of their position in a higher trophic level, wild carnivores can be valuable biological indicator species of trace-metal contamination in the environment. We assessed blood lead and zinc concentrations of four small carnivore species native to Taiwan, the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata), the ferret badger (Melogale moschata), and the crab-eating mongoose (Herpestes urva), from urban and rural areas (Yangmingshan National Park, Xiuguluan River bank, and Da-an River bank). Blood samples were acquired from the anterior vena cava under general anesthesia, and lead and zinc concentrations, hematology, and serum biochemistry results were then obtained. Blood lead levels were significantly higher in ferret badgers in the Yangmingshan area. Although lead concentrations were comparable with those in humans and cats with lead toxicosis, there was no hematological or biochemical evidence that animal health was compromised. Blood zinc levels were within an acceptable range in all four species tested. Overall, we found significant differences in blood lead and zinc levels among four species of carnivores living in areas with different levels of land development in Taiwan. Anthropogenic pollution, mining history, and volcanic activities in Yangmingshan National Park may contribute to significantly high blood lead levels in ferret badgers in this area. Our results provided information about the potential impact of land development on wildlife and may be beneficial to wildlife conservation, public health, and environmental health in Taiwan.\n\nDelaware Bay, US is the only documented location where influenza A virus (IAV) is consistently detected in a shorebird species, the Ruddy Turnstone (RUTU; Arenaria interpres morinella). Although IAV in shorebirds has been well studied at this site for decades, the importance of other species in the avian community as potential sources for the IAVs that infect RUTUs each spring remains unclear. We determined the susceptibility of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and Laughing Gulls (Leucophaeus atricilla), to IAVs isolated from RUTUs in order to gain insight into the potential host range of these viruses. Captive-reared gulls were challenged with RUTU-origin H6N1, H10N7, H11N9, H12N4, and H13N6 IAV, as well as Mallard-origin H6N1 and H11N9. We challenged captive-reared Mallards with the same viruses, except for H13N6. At a biologically plausible challenge dose (104 50% embryo infective doses/0.1 mL), one of five gulls challenged with both H6N1 IAVs shed virus. The remaining gulls were resistant to infection with all viruses. In contrast, all Mallards were infected and shed virus. The H12N4 Mallard challenge group was an exception with no birds infected. These results indicated that Mallards are permissive to infection with viruses originating from a shorebird host and that interspecies transmission could occur. In contrast, host adaptation of IAVs to RUTUs may compromise their ability to be transmitted back to gulls.\n\nThe threat of predation can cause increased adrenal secretion of glucocorticoids that, if sustained, can result in chronic stress that might predispose animals to disease, reduced growth, or poor fertility. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations were measured between September 2011 and July 2012 in two Montana bison (Bison bison) herds, one herd living with and the other without wolves (Canis lupus) in their habitat. The relevance of FGM concentrations (as measured by the corticosterone enzyme immunoassay) and a confirmation of an acute adrenal response was demonstrated by transient increases (P<0.001) in FGM concentrations in bison herded through a chute system and following a wolf encounter. The FGM concentrations were higher in the herd with wolves than the herd without wolves overall (P=0.045), but the monthly differences between the herds were inconsistent (magnitude=0.3–3.5 µg/g; P=0.011 month×herd). The herd with wolves had higher FGM in April, June, July, September, and November, but the herd without wolves had higher FGM in January, February, and May. Seasonal changes in FGM concentrations (P<0.001) were measured across the year in both herds (magnitude=10.8 and 6.9 µg/g, respectively), exceeding any differences between herds potentially attributable to wolf presence. Concentrations of FGM were highest in April–July and were lowest in January–February. Evidence of a chronic stress response was not found, and increased disease susceptibility in the bison living with wolves seems unlikely.\n\nPseudaliid lungworms infect the lungs and sinuses of cetaceans. Information on the life cycle and epidemiology of pseudaliids is very scarce and mostly concerns species that infect coastal or inshore cetaceans. Available evidence indicates that some pseudaliids are vertically transmitted to the host, whereas others are acquired via infected prey. We documented pseudaliid infections in an oceanic cetacean, the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) in the western Mediterranean, and investigated the possibilities of vertical vs. horizontal transmission and the potential influence of host body size, sex, and season on infection levels. We found two species of lungworm in 87 dolphins that stranded along the Spanish Mediterranean coast between 1987 and 2018. One or two larvae of Stenurus ovatus were found in three adult dolphins. Larger numbers of larvae and adults of Skrjabinalius guevarai were collected in 51 dolphins, including unweaned calves. These observations suggested that Skrjabinalius guevarai could be vertically transmitted. The abundance of Skrjabinalius guevarai increased significantly with host size, which suggested that it could be trophically transmitted, as well, with larger hosts consuming more infected prey. Infection levels peaked in spring, outside of the calving season, which is likely a reflection of a seasonal shift in dolphin diet. In summary, results indicate that Skrjabinalius guevarai was capable of both vertical and horizontal transmission, but future research should be directed at clarifying the potential mechanics behind transmission and intermediate hosts.\n\nDisease surveillance in Neotropical primates (NP) is limited by the difficulties associated with anesthetizing NP for sample collection in remote settings. Our objective was to optimize a noninvasive method of oral sampling from semicaptive NP in Peru. We offered 40 NP at Taricaya Rescue Centre in Madre de Dios, Peru ropes coated in various attractants and measured variables (acceptance of the rope, chewing time, and volume of fluid eluted from ropes) that may affect sample acquisition and quality. We preserved samples by direct freezing in liquid nitrogen or by storing samples in RNA stabilization reagent at room temperature. Sample integrity was measured by testing for mammalian cytochrome b with the use of conventional PCR. The NP successfully chewed on a rope in 82% (125/152) of trials. Overall sample integrity was high, with 96% (44/46) of samples (both directly frozen and stored in stabilization reagent) testing positive for cytochrome b. The number of times that an individual NP was exposed to the rope procedure and NP age were associated with higher acceptance rates and the NP successfully chewing on the rope. We conclude that ropes serve as a feasible noninvasive method of obtaining oral samples from NP at rescue centers and could be used in future studies to evaluate population genetics and for pathogen surveillance for population health monitoring.\n\nAn outbreak of rabies occurred in a captive colony of wild-caught big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). Five of 27 bats exhibited signs of rabies virus infection 22–51 d after capture or 18–22 d after contact with the index case. Rabid bats showed weight loss, aggression, increased vocalization, hypersalivation, and refusal of food. Antigenic typing and virus sequencing confirmed that all five bats were infected with an identical rabies virus variant that circulates in E. fuscus in the US. Two bats with no signs of rabies virus infection were seropositive for rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies; the brains of these bats had no detectable viral proteins by the direct fluorescence antibody test. We suspect bat-to-bat transmission of rabies virus occurred among our bats because all rabies-infected bats were confined to the cage housing the index case and were infected with viruses having identical sequences of the entire rabies nucleoprotein gene. This outbreak illustrates the risk of rabies virus infection in captive bats and highlights the need for researchers using bats to assume that all wild bats could be infected with rabies virus.\n\nThe rat lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis) has emerged as an important human and animal health concern in Hawaii, US. Although the life cycle of the parasite requires both rat and gastropod hosts, other animals acting as paratenic hosts, such as frogs and centipedes, have been identified as sources of infection. We investigated the occurrence of rat lungworm infections in potential paratenic hosts in Hawaii to provide information on how they might be involved in transmission of angiostrongyliasis. We confirmed the presence of rat lungworm in 87% (21/24) of introduced Puerto Rican coqui frogs (Eleutherodactylus coqui) in Hilo, Hawaii, by real-time PCR. Additionally, four Cuban greenhouse frogs (Eleutherodactylus planirostris), two cane toads (Rhinella marina), and three centipedes (Scolopendra subspinipes) were found to be infected. In the frogs and toads, multiple tissue types were positive, including stomach and intestine, muscle, liver, heart, and brain, indicating larval migration. We identified rat lungworm infections in frogs, toads, and centipedes in Hawaii and highlighted the lack of knowledge of the role paratenic hosts may be playing in the transmission and life cycle maintenance of rat lungworm in Hawaii.\n\nThe transmission of multiple serotypes of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) between farmed and free-ranging wildlife is of interest to livestock industries and natural resource agencies. We compared the seroprevalence of EHDV-1, -2, and -6 in wild and farmed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herds in Florida, US. We compared serological prevalence, circulating serotypes, antibody titers, and viremia with the use of 171 whole-blood samples from 150 unvaccinated white-tailed deer from farm pens, a farm preserve, and wild deer on adjacent public lands between March 2016 and May 2017. Despite aggressive chemical vector control on the farm, we found higher seroprevalence and titers against the predominant EHDV serotype in farmed deer (in pens and the preserve) than in wild deer. The higher exposure to EHDV of farmed vs. wild deer may have been because of the higher densities of farmed vs. wild deer, the presence of exotic amplifying hosts such as elk (Cervus canadensis) in the preserve, or genetic factors that predisposed farmed deer to disease.\n\nRelatively little is known regarding the role of wildlife in the development of antibiotic resistance. Our aim was to assess the presence of the tetracycline resistance genes, tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), tet(D), tet(E), tet(G), tet(K), tet(L), tet(M), tet(O), tet(P), tet(Q), tet(S), and tet(X), in tissue samples of 14 hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) and 15 crested porcupines (Hystrix cristata) using PCR assays. One or more tet genes were found in all but three hedgehogs and one crested porcupine. Of the 14 tetracycline resistance genes investigated, 13 were found in at least one sample; tet(G) was not detected. We confirmed the potential role of wild animals as bioindicators, reservoirs, or vectors of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment.\n\nOral rabies vaccination is the principal strategy used to control rabies in wildlife. No oral rabies vaccine is licensed for small Indian mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus). The Ontario Rabies Vaccine Bait (ONRAB) is a human adenovirus type-5 rabies glycoprotein recombinant vaccine licensed for rabies control in striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) in Canada and is under experimental evaluation in the US. We evaluated varying doses of ONRAB vaccine by direct instillation into the oral cavity with three groups of 10 mongooses: Group 1 received 109.5 TCID50, group 2 received 108.8 TCID50, and group 3 received 108.5 TCID50 of vaccine. Six control mongooses were sham-vaccinated with culture media. We collected a serum sample prior to vaccination and on days 14 and 30 postvaccination (PV). We quantified the level of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA) from mongoose sera and compared titers among vaccinated groups and time points PV, where values greater than or equal to 0.1 IU/mL were considered positive. On day 14 PV, 87% (26 of 30, 95% confidence interval 70–95%) of vaccinates had seroconverted, whereas all vaccinates demonstrated RVNA by day 30 PV. There was a marginal effect of vaccine dose on group means of log-transformed RVNA titers at day 14 PV (F=2.5, P=0.099), but not day 30 PV. Sham-vaccinated animals were seronegative during all time points."
