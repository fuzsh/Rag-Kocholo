        "text": "A look at the experiences of Australian women in Papua New Guinea before the Japanese invasion in WWII.\n\nRobyn Williams: Papua-New Guinea is once again in transition, after a controversial election and the likely eclipse of the Prime Minister, Sir Julius Chan. All part of a nation adjusting itself to a newly-found independence.\n\nThe contrast between today's New Guinea and its colonial predecessor, could not be more complete, though memories fade fast. You may remember Tim Bowden's remarkable radio saga, Taim Blong Masta, in which imperial voices told incredible stories, almost as incredible as their attitude to the land they once occupied.\n\nJan Roberts has taken a different point of view - that of the Australian women and children in Papua-New Guinea before the Japanese invasion in World War II. She is a historian whose previous appearances on this program celebrated the work of feminist Maybanke Anderson. This time she explores the promise of oral histories.\n\nJan Roberts.\n\nJan Roberts: I was a war baby who grew up with New Guinea in Sydney. My family left New Guinea not long after the Second World War broke out. Whenever we moved house, our New Guinea possessions went with us. Thousands of people on both sides of the Torres Strait have similar artefacts and memories; we share a rich heritage.\n\nLike all children, I took my childhood things for granted. The camphorwood box, the Buka baskets, the pearl shells with schooners under sail painted by a German artist my father said was wrongly shot for being a spy. My older brother and I played with a wooden crocodile and faded mask from the Sepik, a string of dog's teeth and a huge turtle shell. We looked at photographs in books like 'Islands of Men' and 'Adam in Plumes', and from our own tiny sepia ones, we learnt the names of black and white smiling faces. Mother made all our clothes on the treadle Singer sewing machine, which was Dad's wedding present to her, bought in Rabaul's 'Bung'. We cherish these family treasures - and the sewing machine still works!\n\nMy father was a good raconteur. He practised the art of storytelling on many plantation verandahs, clubs, and BP ships. No doubt he censored them for us, but after a few beers we never knew what he would add!\n\nHe was a bachelor when he went to the wilds of New Guinea in the early 1930s to escape the Great Depression, which left strong young men like himself without works or prospects. He was fencing in Queensland when he met someone on the Brisbane wharves who offered him a job with BPs, the island trading company, Burns Philp, managing a lonely copra plantation on the coast of New Ireland. He soon found out that in the islands, BP stood for 'bloody pirates', while their competitors, WR Carpenters, were known as 'Would Rob Christ'. The play was stingy, but it was a job and he jumped at the chance.\n\nWar brought a darker set of images across all these childhood memories because like countless others, it changed our family life forever. From New Guinea in 1940, my British-born father answered his call-up, joined the Royal Air Force and went away. Eventually he came back, bringing with him a new and frightening set of photographs, of crashed planes and the graves of dead comrades. Of course he also brought home a new repertoire of stories.\n\nWe never returned to New Guinea. My mother would be busy in the kitchen while my father held the floor - she had heard all the stories many times before. We never asked her, so we never knew how she felt about leaving her large, close family and going up all alone to New Guinea to be married.\n\nLittle did I think that in my mid 50s, these New Guinea memories of childish play and white man in the tropics and the loss and dislocation of war would lead to a PhD in History, and the book 'Voices from a Lost World'.\n\nI began the work years after my father had died, one Christmas holiday when my mother was approaching 80. How natural it felt to ask her to record her own 'time before', her New Guinea life before the war. And also her war years at home with two young children. Her fears and anxieties: would her husband return? Would Australia be invaded as New Guinea had been?\n\nFrom the beginning, I was driven by the awareness that once my mother and her generation had gone, so had any chance of learning from them, or recording their voices. Sadly and inevitably, five of the 33 interviewees died in the six years it took me to research and write 'Voices'.\n\nThe 1970s second stage of the women's movement changed many people's perception of history. For the first time, women's lives and experiences were seen as a valid part of our human record. Oral history was another new methodology. Its aim is to capture social history in the memories of so-called ordinary people, whose lives were hitherto considered to be 'beneath' or inappropriate for, the historical record. The post-colonial world was reappraising colonialism too. So why not try to mix these three ingredients of the 'before' Australian-Papua-New Guinea heritage, and use oral history as the basis for studying colonial women's experiences as the Missus, or Sinabada, as they were known in Papua.\n\nWhen I started, I knew next to nothing, but I did know it was time to ask questions about more than childish things. For example, about Australia's behaviour as a colonial power; to question the stereotype of the white women in the tropics which feminist historians were scrutinising in relation to the British Raj.\n\nAs my thinking expanded, so the study expanded to include children's lives and experiences. This happened naturally, because most of the 'before' Australian women were, like my mother, of child-bearing and rearing years.\n\nMost of the people I interviewed were born in Australia. Many were brides, again like my mother and the teenager Jeanette Leahy who married the much older explorer-gold prospector, Mick Leahy. Many Australian families were then semi-nomadic, and they would all move to wherever there was work; a significant number migrated from Queensland. Some were born in Europe, others in Papua or the Mandated Territory, or in other Pacific islands.\n\nTwo were mixed-race women, whose heritage went back to the days of the famous 'Queen' Emma, who was born in Samoa. Before 1914, New Guinea was part of the German Empire. Emma, her sister Phoebe and her husband Richard Parkinson, lived at Gunantambu near Rabaul, and they mingled with the likes of 'The Baron', Rudi Wahlen. Wahlen had a beautiful illegitimate daughter, Nati, whose oral tradition reached back to the German colonial days.\n\nNati she, 'She -' (Aunt Phoebe Parkinson) - 'knew the stories of every coloured German mixed-race person in New Guinea. My mother was one of Wahlen's young virgins - all Germans did that, all the colonial white men. And they had to be virgins. It is nothing. Why do white men make so much of it? They went to the village chiefs, the lululai or kukurai, and they would buy them, usually two or three at a time, often swapped them for an axe or a gun. Those bloody Germans, they had the time of their lives, five or six women feeding them, waiting on them. And the women liked saying they belonged to 'So-and-so Master' and getting the new things.'\n\nThe interviewees came from a wide social mix: goldminers and goldminers' wives and two sons born in the Morobe goldfields; missionaries, nuns, publicans, nurses, planters, government and company wives and daughters. When I could, I interviewed two generations of the same family, both for interest and for cross-checking. For example, with Elsie Champion and her daughter Ivana, and Daphne Murcutt and her son Glenn, the well-known architect.\n\nIn the 1920s and '30s, New Guinea really was the last unknown. For a young woman to live there happily, required particular qualities: a spirit of adventure, being a bit rebellious and risk-taking, with a strong constitution and a good sense of humour. Parts of New Guinea were then still unexplored, there was cannibalism, a debilitating climate, with malaria rampant, and a particular hazard for women of child-bearing years. And it was very lonely away from townships like Rabaul and Port Moresby, with no white women neighbours, roads, shops or electricity. To own an icy ball fridge was to be truly blessed, and it was essential to be able to make tinned food look and taste edible. Adapting to the culture shock of being a white woman surrounded by black people, mostly men, with bewildering customs and languages, was very hard.\n\nPretty Daphne Powys from Manly was on 19 when she was wooed and won by a 34-year-old New Guinea gold prospector. Arthur Murcutt was down on leave, and probably wife-hunting. Daphne was the only daughter, and her parents were horrified by the idea of her going to New Guinea with a man she hardly knew.\n\n'My mother said, \"Are you sure?\" Of course I was sure. And we were married on the 24th March, 1934. I looked upon it as just an adventure, you know. It was something marvellous to do. I was doing something none of them were doing. And they thought I was overstepping a bit, they thought it was just, you know, a bit too much for a young girl. But I was out to show them!'\n\nDaphne Murcutt's new home was a hard five-mile walk along a bush track from Wau airport, on stilts of rough-sawn creosoted timber, with a galvanised roof. Upturned boxes were chairs, and the table was a width of timber balanced on more boxes. Their bed was the same. Cooking was done on two primus stoves. Lighting was a couple of kerosene Tilley lamps. Her survival test came after a couple of months when she dispersed a Kukukuku raiding party with a single gunshot over their heads - the Kukukukus were cannibals, and the most feared tribe in New Guinea.\n\nVoice alone would not have given a well-rounded picture of 'before' Papua-New Guinea; there is also the written word. For years I searched second-hand bookshops for out-of-print books about New Guinea written by women. Even more exciting than finding Judy Tudor's classic, 'Many a Green Isle', was discovering that she is still alive and well and a full-time writer at nearly 90. I scattered my book with her observations and memories from when she was miles from anywhere, prospecting for Number One gold in the Sepik River.\n\nI also searched out letters written by women like Hildur McNicoll, the Administrator's wife, and Margaret Whitlam, when she was a young student in 1940 writing home about her visit to her schoolfriend, Jeanette Leahy in the Upper Watut.\n\nLocating good unpublished manuscripts was another of the project's aims. Ida Prosser Fenn's is outstanding because she is a natural writer. Mrs Fenn was a qualified nurse when she sailed for Papua three days after marrying a London Missionary Society missionary. But she was seen as a new chum when she was called to a young woman in labour with her first baby - she was not permitted to intervene.\n\nBy then, for 36 hours the distressed woman had squatted naked on half a coconut shell, hanging onto a rope tied to a rafter, desperately screaming and pushing regardless of contractions.\n\nIda Prosser Fenn wrote: 'The room was packed with men and women sitting cross-legged, children, crying babies, dogs, small pigs, odours and noises almost overwhelming. I asked Sister McMillan what would happen if the unfortunate woman stopped pushing and was told that the husband, a lusty young man sitting quietly nearby smoking, would beat her.'\n\nEventually Ida couldn't control herself. There was a mighty noise in the packed room when she took a sterile probe from her medical kit and ruptured the woman's membrane, and there was deathly silence as she delivered a healthy baby boy. That scene was her introduction to years of unpaid, unsung health work with Papuan women and children. Mrs Fenn's manuscript makes powerful reading.\n\nMy husband was born in New Guinea. He and I went on two quick field trips there. We saw Rabaul's Japanese tunnels and war relics. We were there not long before Rabaul was destroyed by the 1994 eruption, just as it had been in 1937. We canoed part of the Sepik River to see the village where Margaret Mead had lived - the locals laughed when they pointed out where her hut once was, now near the middle of the river - the Sepik never follows the same course for long. We visited Kulili plantation on Kar Kar Island where life goes on much as it did for Alice Middleton before the war, and we saw the derelict dredges in the Bulolo goldfields.\n\nMy plan was to delay finishing the book so that I could visit Bougainville when the present civil war was over. My research indicates that the seeds of the conflict were sown in 1884 when Germany and Britain drew their boundary line between the Solomon Islands. Many 'before' women and children I interviewed had lived in Bougainville. I became particularly obsessed with its strategic role in the Pacific War, and coast watchers like Eric Feldt; then I had to keep my finger on the delete button! Somehow Bougainville does that, it's almost impossible not to be affected by the history of the place.\n\nIt was the home of the aged Marist nuns. In 1989 they had to be evacuated to Sydney for the second time because of war. So they are, or were, because two have died, sad exiles in Australia, knowing that their last resting place is here, not in their beloved North Solomon Islands. By comparison, my abandoned plans were insignificant.\n\nSo it is fortunate that I went to PNG when I did, and wrote what I could. Volcanoes and wars are part of the cycle of life in our next door neighbour's complex and fascinating world. And we can hear their voices from a lost world when we listen.\n\nRobyn Williams: The results of Jan Roberts' listening are in her book 'Voices From A Lost World' published by Millennium.
