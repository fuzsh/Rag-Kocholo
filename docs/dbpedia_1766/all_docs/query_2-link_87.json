        "text": "Introduction\n\n“[A]t the adoption of the constitution, all the States were greatly indebted; and the apprehension that these debts might be prosecuted in the federal Courts, formed a very serious objection to that instrument.”\n\n— Chief Justice Marshall, Cohens v. Virginia\n\nFor American States in 1788, the issue of whether state sovereign immunity would persist if the proposed Constitution were ratified could plausibly be reframed as a question of basic political existence. The States had accumulated vast debts during the Revolutionary War. These debts were too large to be repaid in a timely manner. But, the doctrine of sovereign immunity allowed States to invoke a common-law privilege—once possessed by the English King—not to be sued without consent. By invoking that privilege, a State could, if needed (and after the War, it was needed), refuse to consent to suit and thereby deny creditors the judicial means to force a payment. But there were grave fears that the proposed Constitution, with its Article III courts, would destroy this sovereign privilege. “Pass this government,” Patrick Henry and George Mason warned Virginia during its ratification convention, “and you will be carried to the federal court,” “arraigned like a culprit,” and “compelled to pay shilling for shilling.”\n\nFor Henry, Mason, and other Antifederalists, the threatened loss of state sovereign immunity and attendant depletion of state treasuries weighed decisively against ratification. Thankfully for our constitutional order, others managed to mollify these concerns. Alexander Hamilton assured readers of The Federalist that the Constitution, as written, would not strip States of their sovereign “privilege of paying their own debts in their own way.” John Marshall similarly promised, when addressing the Virginia ratifying convention, that the continued protection of state sovereign immunity in public-debt cases was “warranted by the words” of the Constitution itself. In the end, a supermajority of States, Virginia included, voted to ratify.\n\nDespite the shared concern across the Antifederalist-Federalist spectrum for preserving some form of state sovereign immunity, today many disbelieve Marshall’s contention that the “words” of the Constitution as originally enacted established a textual safeguard for that privilege.\n\nCount the modern Supreme Court as among the Marshall skeptics. The Court recently avowed that the Constitution protects state sovereign immunity not as a matter of text but rather as a “presupposition of our constitutional structure”; or, as Alden v. Maine 527 U.S. 706 (1999). put it, because of “fundamental postulates implicit in the constitutional design.” Justice Scalia, the late, great textualist, similarly defended the persistence of state sovereign immunity in Article III courts as a “constitutional principle beyond the immediate text.”\n\nMuch of legal scholarship shares the Court’s atextual premise. There is a general insistence that the Constitution’s accommodation of “[s]overeign immunity is not tethered to any particular constitutional . . . provision” and “lack[s] any discernable textual source.”\n\nThis Article, by way of contrast, builds on the recent scholarship of Professors Caleb Nelson, William Baude, Stephen Sachs, Anthony Bellia Jr., Bradford Clark, and other “new textualists” who claim, in accord with Marshall, that there are constitutional “words” that protect state sovereign immunity. However, this Article identifies different textual support and arrives at a rather dissimilar conclusion regarding the precise scope of that protection. Most prominently, this Article does not contend that sovereign immunity is sheltered by Article III’s requirement that legal disputes present a “case or controversy” rather than a moot issue or a request for an advisory opinion; nor does it rely on the simple fact that the Constitution employs the word “States.” Instead, this Article endeavors to show that the relevant constitutional words are the entiretyof Article III, Section 2, Clause 1:\n\nThe judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;—to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;—to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;—to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two or more States;—between a State and Citizens of another State;—between Citizens of different States;—between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.\n\nIt takes two steps to connect Article III’s distribution of “judicial Power” to “all Cases” of three kinds but merely (the textual variation suggests) to some “Controversies” of six others to what is advocated here as the Framers’ careful resolution of the sovereign immunity question.\n\nThe first step is relatively uncontroversial and involves treating judicial Power and sovereign immunity as incompatible concepts. The Supreme Court has long maintained that Article III’s grant of judicial Power implies the constitutional authority to render a final, binding judgment under the law applicable in a case in which a court has jurisdiction. In contrast, “sovereign immunity,” at the time of the founding, was viewed as a common-law practice pursuant to which “the judgment of the Courts [were] . . . only monitory, not mandatory” upon a State or other sovereign. Since a “monitory” judgment cannot be a “final and binding” judgment, the presence of sovereign immunity might be understood to imply the absence of judicial Power and vice-versa: a view that Nelson has described as “conventional academic wisdom.”\n\nThe second step involves seeing intention behind the “all Cases” and “Controversies” textual variation in Article III. As the Supreme Court observed in 1816, Article III’s text initially provides “that the judicial power shall extend to all cases” of three kinds, whereas in “the subsequent part of the clause . . . the word ‘all’ is dropped seemingly ex industria.” The Court then declared that it should “hardly . . . be presumed that [this] variation in the language could have been accidental.” The reading advanced in this Article endeavors to find the meaning behind the variation.\n\nLet’s begin with Article III’s second tier, where the judicial Power extends to certain “Controversies” and the word “all” is omitted. If that omission is meaningful, it stands to reason that some Controversies are excluded from the judicial Power’s embrace, such that the Supreme Court was correct when it stated in 1838 that where the Constitution does not “extend the judicial power to all controversies” it becomes “a question of construction, whether [a given] controversy . . . is within the grant of judicial power.”\n\nOn that logic, what sort of Controversies might be excluded from the reach of the federal judicial Power? Here, recourse might be had to the founding principle that the Federal Government can “claim no powers” over the States except those “expressly given, or given by necessary implication.” Moreover, it was similarly established that sovereign “immunity from suit [was] a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution.” By utilizing those precepts, and adopting a two-tiered reading of Article III, it is easy to see where the new textualists have got it right. Insofar as the Controversy Clauses are concerned, the constitutional text incorporates the pre-constitutional (or “antecedent”) doctrine of sovereign immunity as a background constitutional right, such that the judicial Power should not be construed to extend to Controversies that, pursuant to this antecedent doctrine, would be beyond a court’s authority to definitively adjudicate.\n\nThe very same constitutional text does not, however, support the new textualists’ position that the constitutional incorporation of this antecedent doctrine was wholesale. Instead, the first tier of Article III expressly extends the federal judicial Power to “all Cases” of federal question, ambassadorial, or admiralty jurisdiction. It is here, by textual necessity, that a federal court’s judicial Power should not be construed as limited by the antecedent law of sovereign immunity. As one of the lawyers in Cohens v. Virginia 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264 (1821). put the point, it would seem that “the term ‘all cases,’ means all, without exception; and the States of the Union cannot be excepted, by implication.” Otherwise—if States were permitted to invoke an antecedent, pre-constitutional right to make judicial judgments “only monitory, not mandatory” in these Cases—the federal courts would lack the “judicial Power” to issue final and binding judgments under the applicable law in “all” of them. Article III’s text does not permit that result; as Chief Justice Marshall observed, there cannot “be ‘a case in law or equity,’ arising under the constitution, to which the judicial power does not extend.” (Of course, this reading assumes that a compulsory lawsuit against a State can qualify as a “case,” a point which will be returned to later.)\n\nThe upshot is that where Article III extends the “judicial Power” to “all Cases,” States are not, as a constitutional matter, immune from compulsory suit, whereas in second-tier “Controversies,” they are, but only to the same extent that States held this privilege under the antecedent law of sovereign immunity.\n\nWhile this two-tiered understanding of Article III and state sovereign immunity is new to this century, it is not new to antiquity. There is ample evidence, collected in this Article, that Marshall and Hamilton advocated for precisely this reading of Article III when responding to the Antifederalists’ concerns about bankrupting state treasuries. And there is equally strong evidence that the early Supreme Court, including Chief Justice Marshall, explicitly adopted this two-tiered understanding as the law of the land.\n\nAs a precedential matter, the theory first appeared in Justice Iredell’s dissent in Chisholm v. Georgia. The majority in Chisholm had realized the Antifederalists’ nightmare: they concluded that Georgia could be sued, without consent, by a private individual who wished to collect on a Revolutionary War debt. Notably, the majority arrived at that result by incorrectly reading Article III’s grant of judicial Power as fully “unqualified” and thus extending even to all “controversies between a State and citizens of another State.” Iredell dissented on statutory grounds, but in dicta he contended that a distinction should be drawn between the portion of Article III concerning “the special objects of authority of the general government” and the portion which “uses the word ‘controversies’ only.” The upshot of Iredell’s distinction was this: if only a Controversy Clause were at issue, to include instances where private citizens sued States to compel contractual payments, then the extent of the judicial Power should be deemed qualified by what Iredell called “the antecedent law” of sovereign immunity.\n\nIredell may have lost the battle in Chisholm, but the Eleventh Amendment soon overturned the majority’s “unqualified” reading of the State-Citizen Diversity Clause and, this Article will argue, ratified Iredell’s two-tiered understanding of Article III. Most tellingly, the Supreme Court, in the wake of that Amendment, expressly adopted a two-tiered theory of sovereign immunity. First, in Cohens v. Virginia, the Court held that Virginia could not successfully invoke the antecedent law of sovereign immunity in a dispute implicating Article III’s “first class,” or first tier, because there the judicial Power extended to “all cases described, without making in its terms any exception whatever.” Then, in Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, the Court dealt with a second-tier Controversy—a boundary dispute between States—and the majority observed that, unlike the first tier of Article III, “the constitution does not, in terms, extend the judicial power to all controversies.” The Rhode Island Court proceeded to hold that in such “Controversies,” the Constitution would recognize state sovereign immunity as a limit on the judicial Power in a manner coextensive with the antecedent law, that is, “the state of things existing when [the Constitution] was framed and adopted.”\n\nChisholm, Cohens, and Rhode Island are famous cases. Nonetheless, the two-tiered reading of Article III set forth in these opinions, and its significance for the doctrine of state sovereign immunity, has been lost to history. No recent judicial decision appears to be aware of it; contemporary legal scholarship is equally silent. The result, of late, is a modern sovereign immunity jurisprudence that is predicated on an enigmatic “presupposition” that “States retain[ed] their immunity from suit” except “in limited circumstances,” without any textual explanation for either the presupposition or the seemingly haphazard list of exceptions to it (such as the exceptions carved out for bankruptcy, eminent domain, or Civil War Amendment-related litigation).\n\nThere is, by contrast, a readily apparent logic underlying the text-based, two-tiered distinction proffered by Iredell, Marshall, and the early Supreme Court. The Framers frequently remarked on “[t]he vital importance of all the cases enumerated in the first class” of Article III to national interests, given that federal question, ambassadorial, and admiralty disputes, virtually by definition, would concern federal law, foreign affairs, or fraught interstate disputes. At the Virginia ratifying convention, there was widespread agreement that such first-tier Cases “cannot with propriety” be subject to the whims of “partial” States, as their subject matter would too often be bound up with the interests of the whole. In these Cases, in other words, a federal trump card over state sovereign immunity made particular sense.\n\nThe overriding need to vindicate national interests in cases of national importance disappeared, however, when the founding generation discussed the second-tier “Controversies.” Federalists defending Article III’s Controversy Clauses did so largely on impartiality grounds: they contended that the Constitution should enable federal courts to hear the Controversies simply to prevent state courts from playing favorites between the enumerated sets of litigants. But the importance of averting possible state court bias was far less weighty than the need to vindicate the interests of the Union in matters of foreign affairs and federal law; moreover, the countervailing need to placate concerns about private debtors bankrupting state treasuries was evident. Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, it was in discussing the Controversy Clauses—but those Clauses alone—that Marshall, Hamilton, Iredell and others insisted that the “words” of the Constitution enshrined state sovereign immunity.\n\nA two-tiered understanding of Article III, in other words, is consonant with a Constitution that leaves both national interests and state treasuries unencumbered. In disputes implicating uniquely federal interests, a State’s immunity from suit becomes a matter of substantive law (i.e., what the Constitution, statute, treaty, or federal common law applicable in admiralty and ambassadorial Cases says about whether and for what a State may be sued). In Controversy Clause disputes, which would include suits by individuals seeking to compel States to cough up wartime debts (assuming that one agrees a “simple breach of contract” does not violate the Contracts Clause), the text of Article III itself provides a reason to refer to the antecedent law of sovereign immunity as a constitutional constraint on the scope of the federal judicial Power.\n\nIt should also be clear that, on this two-tiered understanding, there would be no need to resolve sovereign immunity questions by focusing exclusively on constitutional “history” and “design.” Instead, there would be a basis in text for the modern Supreme Court’s “constitutional principle” of state sovereign immunity, as well as a basis in text for some dissenting justices’ ideas of a broader congressional abrogation power.\n\nSuch a grounding in text can help to resolve not just thorny sovereign immunity questions but may also answer some enduring questions in the federal courts literature.\n\nFor one, this two-tiered reading of Article III can clarify the infamously confounding text of the Eleventh Amendment. As we will see, the two-tiered structure can help explain why the Amendment’s text—particularly its admonition “shall not be construed”—operates as an explanatory reminder that Article III, as written, never extended the judicial Power to all “Controversies . . . between a State and Citizens of another State.”\n\nIn addition, the two-tiered reading might eliminate the infamous fiction that undergirds contemporary Ex Parte Young doctrine. Rather than requiring an exercise in doublethink as to when state officials are state actors, the two-tiered readingof Article III permits a principled distinction to be drawn between (1) constitutional claims against States, for which the plenary extension of judicial Power implies that the antecedent law of sovereign immunity is not a hurdle; and (2) state-law claims against States, for which the qualified extension of judicial Power suggests that the antecedent law of sovereign immunity is a hurdle.\n\nFinally, beyond sovereign immunity, this two-tiered reading of Article III might help explain why certain “Controversies”—such as State-initiated criminal prosecutions, or particular kinds of civil disputes that do not implicate federal questions—lie beyond a federal court’s authority to adjudicate in the first instance.\n\nPart I of this Article surveys the contemporary debate over whether state sovereign immunity can be reconciled with the Constitution’s text. Part II advocates for the two-tiered reading of Article III as a matter of history and text. Part III explains why this reading also accounts for, and indeed is further justified by, the text of the Eleventh Amendment, and also discusses the early Supreme Court’s precedents adopting the two-tiered theory as the law of the land. Part IV discusses the Court’s eventual “Great Forgetting” of these precedents. Part V explores the doctrinal ramifications of reclaiming the precedential understanding, including the impact of the two-tiered reading on federal sovereign immunity.\n\nI. Sovereign Immunity and the Constitution’s Text\n\nA. The Atextual Premise\n\nThe widely held proposition that judicial Power and state sovereign immunity are incompatible concepts has pulled the contemporary legal world in two very different directions. In gross outline, the prevailing views are that the text of Article III eliminates sovereign immunity across all Cases and Controversies or in none of them. As John Manning has put the point, the question most asked is “whether Article III implicitly incorporated” the antecedent law of sovereign immunity or expressly “repudiated it by extending an unqualified federal judicial power.” There seems to be little recognition, however, that Article III might have done both.\n\nFor jurists in the “elimination everywhere” camp, many agree with Chisholm, where the majority held that Georgia had no viable sovereign immunity defense in a public debt case because the relevant Controversy Clause was assertedly “unqualified” in extending the federal judicial Power to the Controversy at hand. To be sure, most of these commentators will acknowledge that the Eleventh Amendment overruled Chisholm’s precise result, but they continue to insist that the decision’s broader reasoning survives such that in every category of Case andControversy (outside of any directly affected by the Eleventh Amendment) “[t]here simply is no constitutional principle of state sovereign immunity.”\n\nIn contrast, jurists in the “elimination nowhere” camp have tended to view the antecedent law of sovereign immunity as a tacit but similarly complete limitation on the extent of the judicial Power across all Cases and Controversies. On this account, the Framers understood that Article III did not extend the federal judicial Power to any Controversy or Case in which a State, pursuant to pre-ratification practice or under analogues in English common law, would be entitled to immunity from suit.\n\nThese competing absolutist views have produced something of a perpetual tug-of-war. One side of the debate will be chided for neglecting both the nation’s reaction to Chisholm and Marshall and Madison’s remarks during the ratification period. The other side will then receive reproach for likening States in our constitutional republic to the English King and for struggling to find original constitutional text in support of the sovereign immunity “presupposition.”\n\nB. The New Textualists\n\nSome scholars have tried to break this impasse by determining what “words” Marshall referred to during the Virginia ratifying convention. As one possibility, Professor Michael Rappaport (and, more recently, Bellia and Clark) have sought to ground modern sovereign immunity doctrine on the Constitution’s use of the word “State”; they contend that the use of that word “creates a strong inference that there must be certain state immunities.” But this reading, at least at first blush, seems to give almost no guidance on when such “immunities” might exist. Are they present in all disputes, including constitutional Cases? When another State, or even the Federal Government, is the plaintiff? As Baude has observed, the “State”-based textualist theory “requires packing a single word with an awful lot of freight.”\n\nBellia and Clark recently constructed a more robust account by interpreting the word “State” as an incorporative reference to the pre-constitutional law of nations, a body of law that contains its own doctrines of sovereign immunity. That interpretive move, in turn, has led Bellia and Clark to suggest that the Constitution’s use of “State” creates a presumption that “unless the Constitution expressly overrides the States’ preexisting sovereign rights [as determined by the law of nations], the ‘States’ necessarily retain[] such rights.” But, for those convinced by this approach, it still leads back to a fundamental question. Where, if at all, does the constitutional text expressly override such “preexisting sovereign rights[?]” Bellia and Clark’s answer, insofar as state sovereign immunity is concerned, is to disclaim that Article III’s “provisions make [any] mention—clear or ambiguous—of suits against States,” outside of those provisions that were stripped of force by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nBeyond the “State”-based account, Nelson has identified Article III’s “Case or Controversy” requirement. According to Nelson, the Framers understood that the antecedent law of sovereign immunity would operate as a background rule of personal jurisdiction, such that, unless this privilege were waived by a State, it would generally prevent a “Case or Controversy” from forming in the first place. Strong support for Nelson’s position can be found in Madison’s remarks at the Virginia ratifying convention, where Madison argued that the State-Citizen Diversity Clause would not confer “power o[n] individuals to call any State into Court” in the absence of State consent.\n\nIn a similar vein, Baude and Sachs have contended that state sovereign immunity is “a common law rule that happens to be sheltered by other [constitutional] provisions.” Baude explicitly advocated that those sheltering provisions include “the limited nature of Article III”; because “Article III’s grant of jurisdiction is defeasible,” he has argued, its text should be understood “to leave in place the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity.”\n\nAt a general level, this Article agrees with the path-breaking work of Nelson, Baude, Bellia, Clark, and other new textualists. It maintains that Article III does incorporate and shelter the so-called “antecedent law” of sovereign immunity, and it further agrees with Nelson that, where incorporated, that antecedent law of sovereign immunity operates as a defeasible rule of personal jurisdiction.\n\nThis Article departs, however, from the new textualists’ suggestion that the constitutional incorporation of this antecedent law is wholesale. Accordingly, it disagrees with Nelson that the Framers intended the antecedent law of sovereign immunity to always determine whether a justiciable “Case or Controversy” exists; similarly, it departs from Bellia and Clark’s suggestion that the purported lack of limiting language in Article III implies a “broad” form of “state sovereign immunity.” Instead, this Article marshals text, history, and precedent in support of a narrower understanding, namely, the selective incorporation of the antecedent law of sovereign immunity in just the second tier of Article III. In the first tier, by contrast, this Article argues that no incorporation takes place, such that, in federal question, admiralty, and ambassadorial Cases, the extent of the federal judicial Power is plenary and constitutionalized sovereign immunity rights simply do not persist.\n\nII. Towards a Two-Tiered Theory of Sovereign Immunity\n\nText, history, and early precedent all support this two-tiered understanding of Article III and state sovereign immunity.\n\nA. Two Tiers in Text\n\n1. Prior Attempts to Explain the Textual Variation in Article III\n\nIt seems unlikely that textual variation between “all Cases” and “Controversies” was the result of a slip of the pen. As Professor Akhil Amar has observed, Article III, Section 2, Clause 1 repeats “all Cases” not once, not twice, but three times; it then omits the word six times and speaks only of “Controversies.” Then, the word “all” appears again, as Clause 2 carefully extends the Supreme Court’s “original Jurisdiction” to “all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls” in language that precisely tracks Clause 1’s grant of “judicial Power” to “all” ambassadorial Cases. The retention of this last “all” was, moreover, no accident: when the Committee of Style deleted this “all” from Clause 2, the Philadelphia Convention responded by specifically re-inserting it.\n\nSome version of this two-tiered variation was present throughout Article III’s drafting process. The charge to the Committee of Detail instructed that federal court jurisdiction should extend “to all cases arising under the Natl. laws: And to such other questions as may involve the Natl. peace & harmony.” The committee’s first major draft reprised the “all” and “such other” variation from the charge, and its second draft replaced it with the now-familiar “all Cases” and “Controversies” language. Notably, on a copy of this second draft, committee members wrote notes intimating that there were “Controversies” to which the judicial Power would not extend.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, scholars focusing on this aspect of Article III’s text generally agree that the variation in it appears intentional, although there is disagreement about whether a coherent constitutional theory can make sense of it.\n\nAmar has theorized that the textual variation requires Congress to extend federal statutory jurisdiction to all Cases in Article III’s first tier, while leaving it to Congress’s discretion whether to extend such jurisdiction to any of the Controversies. What has come to be known as Amar’s mandatory-jurisdiction theory, however, appears to conflate the Constitution’s grant of “judicial Power” with its separate distribution of “Jurisdiction,” and it also runs up against the historical precept that Article III’s nine categories of Cases and Controversies create a jurisdictional ceiling but not a floor. Another difficult piece of evidence for Amar is the Judiciary Act of 1789, which, as Professor Daniel Meltzer has convincingly established, did not purport to extend federal statutory jurisdiction to “all” first-tier Cases and thus suggests that the first Congress did not read Article III as commanding that it do so.\n\nMeltzer, after expressing skepticism about Amar’s mandatory-jurisdiction theory, tentatively proposed reading a different intention into Article III’s textual variation. Perhaps, Meltzer observed, the term “cases” was meant to “encompass criminal and civil proceedings” whereas “controversies” was supposed to be “civil only.” To Meltzer’s eye, it is accordingly “possible that ‘all’ was meant to reinforce the breadth of ‘cases,’” even though, he noted, the presence of “all” on this understanding would be merely superficial.\n\nAmar’s and Meltzer’s proposals aside, few alternative explanations for the textual variation have been forthcoming. As a result, many scholars, lacking what they see as a plausible theory that accommodates the variation, have felt themselves constrained to ignore it.\n\nThis Article aims to fill that gap, by not only explaining the significance of Article III’s textual variation but also revealing the historical and consequential intent behind it. The reading it puts forward is relatively straightforward. It maintains that in light of the omission of the word “all,” Article III should be read to extend the judicial Power to only some Controversies. But where “all” is interposed, then the “judicial Power”—whatever it is—should be understood to extend all Cases.\n\nOn this reading, one set of excluded Controversies may well be, as Meltzer’s scholarship suggests, criminal proceedings. Such an understanding would align with the idea that the Framers did not want to provide a mechanism by which state criminal prosecutions might be heard in the first instance by federal rather than state courts. But another set of potentially excluded Controversies, in focus here, are those implicating the States’ antecedent immunity rights. To more fully understand how the variation in Article III’s text can be read to (partially) protect those rights, it helps to start by defining sovereign immunity’s antithesis: the judicial Power.\n\n2. The Judicial Power to Render Final and Binding Judgments under the Applicable Law if a Court has Jurisdiction\n\nBaude has revitalized the idea that “judicial Power” means the authority of federal courts to render final and binding judgments under the applicable law so long as they are separately possessed of jurisdiction. The same understanding can be extracted from a long line of Supreme Court precedent. For example, in 2011, the Court described “the most prototypical exercise of judicial power” as “the entry of a final, binding judgment.” And in 1792, the Justices unanimously declared a statute that gave Congress discretion over whether to pay judicial judgments “radically inconsistent with the independence of that judicial power which is vested in the court.”\n\nThis “final, binding judgment” understanding of judicial Power traces its roots to the Framers’ desired division of authority between Congress and the federal courts. The Framers disliked the English practice by which the House of Lords would sit, review, and overturn judicial decisions, effectively acting as the court of last resort. The United States endeavored to cut a different path, for reasons Hamilton detailed in The Federalist No. 81: “Every reason . . . militates against placing the judiciary power, in the last resort, in a body composed of men chosen for a limited period,” and thus under Article III such power is committed to the Judiciary alone, so that its judgments “will not be in any manner subject to the revision or correction of the legislative body.\n\nThis judicial Power to issue judgments that bind even Congress remains subject to a crucial qualification: the independent need for jurisdiction, or authority to hear a case. As Baude has put the point, “[t]he judgment power is the power to resolve controversies within a court’s jurisdiction, not elsewhere.” This is a crucial observation, as it makes it possible to speak of a Case or Controversy as being within the grant of judicial Power and yet outside a given court’s jurisdiction.\n\nViewing the judicial Power as dormant until a court independently acquires jurisdiction can be justified on a number of dimensions. The most obvious is that the Constitution employs the terms separately, distributing “judicial Power” in the first clause of Article III, Section 2 and discussing “Jurisdiction” in those that follow. Moreover, unless the terms are understood to have independent meanings, it is impossible to explain the precedential principle—initially captured in the Judiciary Act of 1789—that the grant of judicial Power is not a self-effectuating grant of jurisdiction. Thus, it seems sensible to interpret Article III’s grant of “judicial Power” as conferring the power to render final, binding judgments under the applicable law only if a court also has jurisdiction.\n\nImportantly, this understanding of judicial Power does no violence to the precedential principle that Article III establishes a constitutional ceiling on subject matter jurisdiction, such that if a Case or Controversy is not among the nine categories enumerated in Article III, no statute can authorize a federal court to hear it. The reason for this result is simple. A court bereft of judicial Power is a court that is relegated to issuing nonbinding advisory opinions. But the federal courts are constitutionally dispossessed of authority to issue such opinions, as they do not concern an Article III “Case or Controversy.”\n\nThis tangled relationship between judicial Power and jurisdiction can explain why, as Nelson has argued and as the Supreme Court has often held, “sovereign immunity [should be] considered ‘jurisdictional’ and yet [can] be waived by the state.” That is so because an appropriate invocation of sovereign immunity pursuant to the antecedent law will disable a court from exercising its judicial Power to render a final, binding judgment, and, in the absence of such judicial Power, a federal court loses jurisdiction. But, if a State consents to be sued, then this impediment to the court’s exercise of judicial Power has been removed, and the court may proceed to hear and decide the dispute (so long as it otherwise has subject matter jurisdiction).\n\nFinally, it must be observed that the judicial Power is the power to give binding effect to the applicable law, or what Marbury v. Madison 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). referred to as the “rules govern[ing] the case.” It does not permit a court to give binding effect to laws that have no bearing on the case at hand. Although this principle is self-evident, some applications of it are less apparent. For this, we will see, is why only the antecedent law of sovereign immunity—but not what scholars call statutory or substantive immunities—can conflict with Article III’s grant of judicial Power.\n\n3. Sovereign Immunity Versus Judicial Power\n\nSovereign immunity and judicial Power are dueling concepts. The reason for the tension can be traced to the American separation of powers as between Congress and the courts. The Supreme Court articulated the fundamental idea when, in 1838, it equated the common-law “principle” that “right will be administered to a subject against the king, [but only] as a matter of grace” with the rejected English practice of having “the sentence of [a] Court . . . transmitted to congress” for the legislature to determine in the last resort whether to award relief. On this understanding, the Framers’ rejection of one principle (the legislature acting as the court of last resort) by vesting the judicial Power exclusively in the federal judiciary might imply the rejection of the other (the common-law sovereign immunity principle), but only so far as this new judicial Power extends.\n\nA definitional analysis of “sovereign immunity” and “judicial Power” leads to the same understanding of the inherent conflict between these concepts. It helps to start by explaining why so-called statutory immunities usually do not usurp the constitutional grant of judicial Power.\n\nA statutory immunity might take the form of a provision that excludes federal jurisdiction over certain disputes against States. Such a statutory provision generally would not interfere with judicial Power, because, as discussed, jurisdiction is a prerequisite to the exercise of judicial Power as opposed to a corollary of its presence. Another statutory immunity might, without withdrawing jurisdiction, exempt a State from being sued on a particular cause of action or grant it a special defense. That kind of provision generally would not interfere with the judicial Power to definitively expound the applicable law because it would constitute the applicable law. So long as the authority to finally interpret and apply that law is lodged in the courts—even if the final, binding determination is simply that the applicable law does not permit a State to be sued —the judicial Power has not been infringed.\n\nBy contrast, what this Article has termed the “antecedent law” of sovereign immunity—which refers, more specifically, to immunity doctrines grounded in pre-ratification English common law or American colonial practice —uniquely interferes with a federal court’s exercise of judicial Power. And that is because the antecedent law of sovereign immunity is, simply, extralegal. English or colonial doctrines are not automatically applicable in Article III federal courts. Instead, to become part of the Marbury “rules governing the case,” these doctrines must be affirmatively incorporated into federal law or (where applicable) state law.\n\nIn a variety of instances, the Constitution and other sources of federal law do incorporate this “antecedent law.” Most notably, the early Supreme Court interpreted the implicit “some” in the second tier of Article III as reflecting that a court must look to the antecedent law of sovereign immunity to determine what kinds of Controversies the judicial Power does not extend to. But, to the extent that the antecedent law of sovereign immunity has not been incorporated, then permitting a State to invoke antecedent sovereign immunity privileges anyway is to usurp a federal court’s judicial Power to render a final and binding judgment under the applicable law in the dispute before it.\n\nThe ultimate result, as the Supreme Court recently explained, is that a successful invocation of “sovereign immunity” constitutes a “limitation on the federal judicial power.” But the inverse should also follow, as the Court observed in its earliest days: to the extent a dispute is “in the grant of judicial [P]ower,” a State’s invocation of the antecedent law of sovereign immunity must, by necessity, fail.\n\n4. Constructing the Two-Tiered Theory of Sovereign Immunity\n\nThe incompatibility of judicial Power and sovereign immunity is a familiar idea. But, since the mid-nineteenth century, no court or commentator has used that notion to explain the textual variation in Article III.\n\nThe two-tiered theory of sovereign immunity starts with the premise that “all” means all and the omission of “all” means some. Where the judicial Power extends to “all Cases,” federal courts can render final and binding judgments under the applicable law in all Cases (so long as they also have jurisdiction) in a manner that is unconstrained by the antecedent law of sovereign immunity. But since the judicial Power does not extend to “all Controversies,” someControversies should be deemed excluded from the judicial Power’s embrace, and a court should decide which Controversies by reference to (at least) the antecedent law of sovereign immunity.\n\nFor several reasons, this two-tiered theory of sovereign immunity represents a sensible reading of the constitutional text.\n\nFirst, this reading does not demand interpretive gymnastics. It begins with a founding-era definition of judicial Power, adds the meaningful variation canon, and then applies the federalism canon. If a shoe fits easily, that alone may favor wearing it.\n\nSecond, it must be stressed that this understanding of Article III is the rare one that comports with the meaningful variation canon. Unlike commentators who insist that the original text of Article III eliminates state sovereign immunity either everywhere or nowhere, it captures the early Court’s admonishment that the shift from “all Cases” to just “Controversies” “is hardly to be presumed . . . [to] have been accidental.”\n\nThird, this reading draws support from other constitutional provisions, such as the Supremacy Clause. The defining attribute of “supreme Law,” the Clause appears to say, is the capacity to bind even States. The Justices of the early Court were of that opinion. They equated “suprem[acy]” with the ability to “legitimately control all individuals or governments within the American territory,” and explained that a law “binding in moral obligation [only], but [that] could not be constitutionally carried into effect” due to a state-erected “impediment” would not “be the supreme law in the new sense provided for.” Notably, the Clause identifies as “supreme Law” the “Constitution,” “the Laws of the United States,” and “Treaties.” The idea that these three sources of law have the capability to bind even state governments comports with Article III’s extension of judicial Power to “all Cases” concerning the very same.\n\nOther constitutional provisions seem to contemplate at least some compulsory suits against States. As observed by the first U.S. Attorney General, Edmund Randolph, the Constitution seems to “announce[] to the world . . . that States may injure individuals in their property, their liberty, and their lives”; and so, for example, the Constitution forbids States from “suspend[ing] the priviledge of a writ of habeas corpus” or “pass[ing] a bill of attainder or ex post facto law.” But if States could circumvent the Constitution’s proscriptions by invoking the antecedent law of sovereign immunity, they might be rendered worthless. As Randolph contended, “Are States then to enjoy the high priviledge of acting thus eminently wrong, without controul; or does a remedy exist? . . . Government itself would be useless, if a pleasure to obey or transgress with impunity should be substituted.” (In a similar vein, Hamilton argued in The Federalist Papers that “[n]o man of sense would believe that such prohibitions [running against the States] would be scrupulously regarded, without some effectual power in the government to restrain or correct the infractions of them.” ).\n\nThe two-tiered theory of sovereign immunity advanced here comports with Randolph’s suggestion that States cannot invoke sovereign immunity against constitutional claims in federal court. But contrast the theory’s textual explanation for that result—that the judicial Power extends to “all Cases . . . arising under this Constitution”—with the modern Court’s less coherent attempt to accommodate Randolph. What has come to be known as Ex Parte Young doctrine permits individuals to sue state officials (but not States directly) for injunctions forestalling unconstitutional conduct. But the doctrine is predicated on an infamous paradox or “fiction” that (1) state action must be present in these disputes, or else the Constitution (with limited exceptions) would not apply; but (2) state action cannot be present in these disputes, lest the defendant state official be entitled to a derivative sovereign immunity defense.\n\nIn short, the two-tiered theory of sovereign immunity reaches the appropriate result—a federal court can stop a State from violating the Constitution—sans the fiction.\n\nAs a final textual point in favor of this interpretation, Part III will point to the language in the Eleventh Amendment. But to fully appreciate the significance of the Eleventh Amendment, which was a reaction to an interpretation of the original Constitution, we first must turn to how the founding generation interpreted Article III at the time of ratification.\n\nB. Two Tiers in History\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the most important discussions of sovereign immunity and Article III’s text are The Federalist Papers and the records of the Virginia ratifying convention, where the delegates, many of them Framers, discussed and debated the propriety of the nine grants of judicial Power at length. Neither the records of the Philadelphia Convention nor of the other state ratifying conventions capture similarly detailed discussions.\n\nUnfortunately, while detailed, the Virginia convention records are also indeterminate, as the delegates put forward starkly competing interpretations of Article III’s impact on state sovereign immunity. Nevertheless, there is much to gain from reviewing the competing interpretive positions, because there is reason to believe that the Eleventh Amendment was ratified in order to elevate one of them.\n\n1. The Great Virginia Debate: “Shilling for Shilling” or State Sovereign Immunity?\n\nThe delegates in Virginia honed in on one particularly contentious question: would Article III’s State-Citizen Diversity Clause permit individuals to forcibly sue States to recover on Revolutionary War debts? Patrick Henry, answering in the affirmative, warned of the dire financial consequences that would follow:\n\nThere was an immense quantity of depreciated [c]ontinental paper money in circulation at the conclusion of the war. . . The holders of this money may call for the nominal value, if this [Constitution] be adopted . . . Pass this government, and you will be carried to the federal court . . . and you will be compelled to pay shilling for shilling.\n\nTwo positions emerged during the ensuing debate. One aligned with a two-tiered reading of Article III. The other foreshadowed the Chisholm decision.\n\na. Marshall, Madison, and Hamilton’s Position: A Qualified State-Citizen Diversity Clause and a Two-Tiered Understanding of Article III\n\nMarshall, Hamilton (in The Federalist), and Madison insisted that the phrasing of the State-Citizen Diversity Clause would forestall Henry’s parade of horribles, because the Clause in fact preserved state sovereign immunity.\n\nMarshall famously contended that “the words” of the State-Citizen Diversity Clause made this so:\n\nWith respect to disputes between a state, and the citizens of another state, [federal] jurisdiction has been decried with unusual vehemence. I hope that no gentleman will think that [under this Clause] a state will be called at the bar of the federal court . . . The intent is, to enable states to recover claims of individuals residing in other states. . . . I contend this construction is warranted by the words. . . . I see a difficulty in making a state defendant, which does not prevent its being plaintiff.\n\nIn Virginia, Marshall did not pursue his point further in his recorded remarks. But which “words” in the State-Citizen Diversity Clause could he have been referring to? The words must have been the fact that Article III does not extend the judicial Power to “all” Controversies between States and diverse citizens, thereby enabling a “construction” of the Clause whereby a State could be plaintiff but not defendant.\n\nTellingly as Chief Justice, Marshall went on to declare that state sovereign immunity was nullified by Article III, but only in the first of “two classes of cases” where the judicial Power extends to “all cases described, without making in its terms any exception whatever.” Similarly, when responding to an argument that the Supreme Court lacked authority to decide disputes in which a “sovereign” State was pitted against the Federal Government or its officers, Marshall explained that “the constitution has expressly given [the Supreme Court] the [judicial] power . . . of deciding in a last resort, all questions ‘arising under the constitution and laws’ of the United States,” such that “the words are ‘all cases’ and I deny that the word ‘some’ can be substituted for ‘all,’ or that the word ‘all,’ can be satisfied if any one case can be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the court.”\n\nAlthough commentators comparing Marshall in Virginia to Chief Justice Marshall on the Supreme Court have cast him as being “inconsistent with . . . himself,” his remarks are perfectly coherent on a two-tiered understanding of Article III. Indeed, while he advocated for the elimination of state sovereign immunity in the first tier of Article III, Marshall as Chief Justice continued to echo his position from Virginia when the State-Citizen Diversity Clause was concerned. Whatever position Article III’s first tier had placed States in, Marshall wrote, federal courts still “have no jurisdiction over [an individual’s] contract” with a State; “[t]hey cannot enforce it, nor judge of its violation.”\n\nAlexander Hamilton during the build up to the Constitution’s ratification put forth similarly nuanced remarks on state sovereign immunity and the text of Article III. In The Federalist No. 81, Hamilton responded to an Antifederalist’s argument that the State-Citizen Diversity Clause would induce savvy individuals to assign their “public securities” “to the citizens of another [State]” such that the assignee could then “prosecute that State in the federal courts for the amount of those securities.” Hamilton assured his readers that this consequence would not come to pass, because the State-Citizen Diversity Clause did not divest States “of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way.” He explained in a famous passage:\n\nIt is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent . . . Unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the States, and the danger intimated must be merely ideal. The circumstances which are necessary to produce an alienation of State sovereignty were discussed in [The Federalist No. 32] . . . and need not be repeated here. A recurrence to the principles there established will satisfy us, that . . . [any] contracts between a [State] and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force.\n\nMany discussions of The Federalist No. 81 pass over Hamilton’s careful phrasing. Hamilton, like Marshall, contended that States would have sovereign immunity against “contractual” claims brought by individuals under the State-Citizen Diversity Clause. Hamilton did not, however, suggest that Article III incorporated the antecedent law of sovereign immunity wholesale across all nine categories of Cases and Controversies. Indeed, he made express reference to instances in which the Constitution permitted an “alienation of State sovereignty,” which included to his mind instances where “the Constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the Union.”\n\nIt is ultimately a matter of speculation whether Hamilton understood the first tier of Article III to be a qualifying “grant of exclusive authority to the Union.” But it is clear that many delegates in Virginia thought that it was. Marshall, Madison, and others contended that the Federal Question, Ambassadorial, and Admiralty Clauses comprising Article III’s first tier would authorize “giving the federal judiciary exclusive jurisdiction” (i.e., jurisdiction exclusive of state courts, because these three categories of Cases uniquely “affect[ed] the interest of the United States”). If Hamilton similarly viewed the first tier of Article III as conferring a form of exclusive federal authority, then his nuanced remarks in The Federalist might point towards a two-tiered theory of when federal courts can “alienat[e] . . . State sovereignty.” Reading Hamilton to be in alignment with this interpretation of Article III would also square with The Federalist No. 80, in which he intimated (much like Edmund Randolph did) that States lacked sovereign immunity as against constitutional claims.\n\nBack in Virginia, Madison, like Marshall and Hamilton, similarly advocated for a qualified reading of the State-Citizen Diversity Clause:\n\n[Federal] jurisdiction in controversies between a state and citizens of another state is much objected to, and perhaps without reason. [Under this clause] [i]t is not in the power of individuals to call any state into court. The only operation it can have, is that, if a state should wish to bring a suit against a citizen, it must be brought before the federal court. . . . [A]nd if a state should condescend to be a party, this court [also] may take cognizance of [a suit by an out-of-state citizen against a State].\n\nAs for the Foreign-State Diversity Clause, in Virginia both Madison and Marshall contended that there the Constitution would also preserve state sovereign immunity. They both insisted that the “previous consent of the [State] is necessary” for the judicial Power to extend under this Clause to litigation against a State.\n\nBut when discussing the first tier of Article III, in contrast, Madison argued that here “the judicial power should correspond with the legislative,” implying that to whatever extent Article I permitted Congress to legislate, federal courts should have judicial Power to finally and definitively adjudicate. In a similar vein, Madison at the Philadelphia Convention had contended that “states ought to be placed under the control of the general government” such that, to the extent federal power is involved, States should not be considered “sovereign” but merely “political societies.” Madison further captured the spirit of the two-tiered understanding in The Federalist No. 39, where he declared that the proposed Constitution “is partly federal and partly national” in that “its jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects only, and leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects.”\n\nThree decades later, Madison’s private correspondence reflects that his position on the merits of abrogating State sovereign immunity may have changed. He wrote that “[p]rudence enjoins” “let[ting judicial] proceedings touch individuals only” when “taking cognizance of cases arising under the Constitution” “in consideration of the impracticability of applying coercion to States.” He also wrote that “[t]he Eleventh amendment introduces exceptions if there were none before” to the extension of “[t]he Judicial power of the U.S. over cases arising under the Constitution.” The merits of Madison’s suggestion that the Eleventh Amendment cut off federal judicial Power in some constitutional disputes will be discussed later. Insofar as Madison’s remarks bear on the appropriate construction of the Constitution as ratified, it suffices for now to say that these remarks were not part of the dialogue at the time of the Virginia ratifying convention, and they further tend to reflect that, at least prior to the Eleventh Amendment’s ratification, Madison understood that Article III’s Federal Question Clause might have been unqualified.\n\nIn short, at the time of ratification, the Marshall-Hamilton-Madison triumvirate clearly regarded the grant of judicial Power in Article III’s State-Citizen and Foreign-State Diversity Clauses to be limited by state sovereign immunity and, hence, largely inoperative without a State’s consent. But, strikingly, when the Virginia delegates focused on the first tier of Article III, neither Madison nor Marshall—indeed, not a single delegate at the Virginia ratifying convention—suggested that state sovereign immunity rights persisted.\n\nTellingly, when Mason criticized the Federal Question Clause as bereft of “any limitation whatsoever,” the Federalist response (in stark contrast to the debate over the Diversity Clauses) was not to mention a background principle of sovereign immunity. Just the opposite. The Federalists rejoined, “Must not the judicial powers extend to enforce the federal laws . . . ? Must it not protect them in the proper exercise of duty, against all opposition, whether from individuals or state laws?”\n\nChief Justice Marshall later echoed these remarks when he wrote that “the judicial power . . . must be co-extensive with the legislative, and must be capable of deciding every judicial question which grows out of the constitution and laws. . . . It can, then, . . . legitimately control all individuals or governments within the American territory.” Both here and elsewhere, Marshall articulated explicitly what the Virginia delegates appeared to be saying implicitly. In Cases arising under the Federal Question Clause, constitutionalized sovereign immunity rights did not exist; however, Marshall and others still stressed, there remained other constraints on the permissible scope of federal law, such as those embedded in Article I.\n\nAs for Article III’s Ambassadorial and Admiralty Clauses, here the Virginia delegates generally agreed on the need for paramount federal authority. Proceedings in such Cases, they observed, could influence the Union’s “intercourse with foreign nations” and “involve us in [war].” Thus, Article III’s extension of the judicial Power to “all” of them was defended as necessary to protect “our national tranquility and reputation,” and even George Mason agreed that federal courts “ought to have judicial cognizance in all cases” involving ambassadors or admiralty jurisdiction.\n\nNo delegate argued that States should (or would) enjoy sovereign immunity rights in ambassadorial or admiralty disputes. That made a certain degree of sense, given that a localized veto power could impede a federal court’s ability to resolve these frequently interstate or international disputes on the merits. For the Framers, the possibility of a State improperly treating a foreign dignitary, or seizing a vessel later claimed by diverse citizens or a foreign power, was never far from mind.\n\nb. The Henry/Mason Interpretation: An Unqualified State-Citizen Diversity Clause and a Plenary Abrogation of State Sovereign Immunity\n\nThe Antifederalists in Virginia did not dispute the accuracy of the Federalists’ seemingly unqualified reading of Article III’s first tier. But they did contend that Marshall’s and Madison’s restricted reading of the State-Citizen Diversity Clause was nonsensical.\n\nPatrick Henry, while hedging his remarks by voicing some “doubt on the subject,” claimed that the reading by which “the state may be plaintiff only” under the State-Citizen Diversity Clause seemed to him “perfectly incomprehensible”:\n\nWhat says the [clause]? That [the federal courts] shall have cognizance of controversies between a state and citizens of another state, without discriminating between plaintiff [or] defendant. . . . [I]f I understand that paper right . . . [a] state may be sued in the federal court [for the nominal value of the notes] on your table.\n\nMason similarly read the State-Citizen Diversity Clause as rendering States liable to compulsory suits by citizens of other States:\n\nI cannot see the propriety of the next power, in disputes between a state and the citizens of another state. . . . Is not this disgraceful? Is this state to be brought to the bar of justice like a delinquent individual? Is the sovereignty of the state to be arraigned like a culprit, or private offender?\n\nHenry and Mason argued to the Virginia ratifying convention that the potential loss of state sovereign immunity in public debt cases warranted, at the very least, a constitutional amendment striking the offending Clause outright. Going further, Mason also criticized the Foreign-State Diversity Clause as lacking “reciprocity” because, in his view, Virginia “may be sued by a foreign State” but “[i]n a suit between Virginia and a foreign state, is the foreign state to be bound by the decision?” Mason thus disagreed with Madison and Marshall’s position that the Foreign-State Diversity Clause would extend the judicial Power only in the event of State consent.\n\nHenry and Mason’s concerns were given serious weight by the delegates in Virginia. While a majority ultimately voted to ratify the Constitution, a separate majority also voted in favor of Mason’s proposed amendment to Article III.\n\nThe structure of this amendment is striking. Mason, during the convention, argued that Article III’s grant of judicial Power was proper “in all cases” concerning “treaties,” “affecting ambassadors, foreign ministers and consuls, as well as in cases of maritime jurisdiction.” In other Controversies—including “the decision of Controversies to which the United States shall be a party”—Mason contended that the “power of the judiciary [was] also necessary [but] under some restrictions.” Finally, Mason advocated eliminating outright the State-Citizen Diversity Clause, the Foreign-State Diversity Clause, and the non-treaty portion of the Federal Question Clause. Following his comments, Mason offered the following amendment:\n\nThe judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other foreign ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states, and between parties claiming lands under the grants of different states.\n\nRead in combination with his recorded remarks, Mason’s amendment is clearly premised on the idea that the variation between “all Cases” and “Controversies” is meaningful. Where Mason advocated for striking a clause, it was struck. Where he believed that the Federal Government should have plenary authority, the amendment interposed the word “all.” And where Mason contended that the judicial Power was “necessary under some restrictions,” the word “all” was omitted.\n\nUnfortunately, Mason did not divulge precisely what “restrictions” he thought might operate under the second tier of his proposed amendment. But, in any event, the debate over sovereign immunity and Article III’s text did not end with the Virginia ratifying convention, or even when Mason’s proposed amendment to Article III—which was proposed, in turn, by the Virginia ratifying convention—died in the First Congress.\n\nC. Two Tiers in Precedent, Part I\n\nShortly after the Constitution’s ratification, the newly constituted Supreme Court confronted the same interpretive question that vexed the Virginia delegates. The Court would find itself similarly divided over how best to resolve it.\n\n1. The Road to Chisholm: Expounding the Judicial Power\n\nThe Supreme Court’s role in this history begins with the passage of the Invalid Pensions Act of 1792. The Act authorized disabled Revolutionary War veterans to apply for pensions in the new federal courts, but its procedures were constitutionally suspect. A federal judge finding an applicant eligible for a pension was supposed to certify his opinion to the Secretary of War, who, in turn, could recommend either giving or withholding Treasury funds based on his view of the merits of the applicant’s claim. Congress, under the statute, was then to be the final arbiter of whether and how much a pensioner might be paid.\n\nThe Supreme Court accepted argument on whether the Invalid Pensions Act violated Article III by effectively authorizing a veto over judicial decisions, but it never formally resolved that question as an intervening statute mooted the case. Nevertheless, by the time of argument, all five Justices had already opined on the Act while riding circuit, and all five had deemed it an unconstitutional interference with the Constitution’s vesting of judicial Power in the federal judiciary. Justice Iredell perhaps put it best, explaining that “no decision of any court of the United States can . . ., agreeable to the Constitution, be liable to a revision or even suspension by the legislature itself, in whom no judicial power of any kind appears to be vested.”\n\nThe justices’ circuit-level opinions—known collectively as Hayburn’s Case Id. at 410.—became the first precedents defining Article III “judicial Power” as the power to render final, binding judgments under the applicable law. Notably, these same opinions also reflected the principle that the absence of judicial Power implies a lack of federal jurisdiction, as all five Justices likewise determined that the Invalid Pensions Act’s constitutionally invalid procedures meant that the federal courts could not hear any pensioner’s claim, not even in an “administrative” capacity.\n\nAfter Hayburn’s Case, it was an open doctrinal question whether the Justices’ understanding of judicial Power might affect the viability of the pre-constitutional doctrine of sovereign immunity, particularly given that sovereign immunity can be viewed as conferring a similar kind of veto power over judicial decisions. The connection between sovereign Immunity and the Invalid Pensions Act was not lost on Edmund Randolph, who, as U.S. Attorney General, feared that an extension of Hayburn’s Case might lead the Court to renounce jurisdiction over all disputes in which a State invoked its antecedent sovereign immunity rights. In a letter to President Washington, Randolph observed that\n\nStates are brought into court, as defendants to the claims of land companies, and of individuals[;] British debts rankle deeply in the hearts of one part of the U.S.[;] and the [Hayburn’s Case] precedent, fixed by the condemnation of the pension-law, if not reduced to its precise principles, may justify every constable in thwarting the laws.\n\nRandolph’s fears were, however, a two-way street. True, Hayburn’s Case suggested that a federal court would lack judicial Power—and, by implication, jurisdiction—to whatever extent States retained their antecedent sovereign immunity rights. But, conversely, Article III’s express “exten[sion]” of judicial Power to nine categories of Cases and Controversies might itself be interpreted to annul those very rights. Henry and Mason had, after all, just taken the latter interpretive stance at the Virginia ratifying convention with Randolph in attendance. The Attorney General decided to make the same argument.\n\n2. Chisholm v. Georgia\n\nSix days after he sent his letter to the President, Randolph asked the Supreme Court to command the State of Georgia to defend itself in an assumpsit action instituted by Alexander Chisolm, a plaintiff who, acting as executor for a South Carolina citizen, had sued Georgia for payment on goods seized during the Revolutionary War. Chisholm after an initial dismissal had filed suit directly in the Supreme Court, but Georgia had so far refused to answer the complaint. If the default persisted, Randolph moved the Court to enter judgment “against the said State, and [to issue] a writ of enquiry of damages.”\n\nGeorgia responded to Randolph’s motion by invoking sovereign immunity and protesting “against the exercise of jurisdiction in the cause.” Randolph—echoing, in a strange twist of history, Henry and Mason’s argument against ratifying the Constitution—argued that the text of the Constitution overrode state sovereign immunity as “[t]he judicial power [extends] to controversies between a State and citizens of another State[,] . . . in no respect indicating who is to be Plaintiff or who Defendant. . . . [T]he words, unqualified, strongly tend[] at least to subject States as defendants.”\n\nRandolph’s “unqualified” reading of the State-Citizen Diversity Clause was adopted by a majority of the Court. Justice Blair put it bluntly:\n\n[T]he judicial [power] of the United States . . . is expressly extended, among other things, to controversies between a State and citizens of another State. . . . [I]f sovereignty be an exemption from suit . . . it follows that when a State, by adopting the Constitution, has agreed to be amenable to the judicial power of the United States, she has, in that respect, given up her right of sovereignty.\n\nChief Justice Jay, Justice Wilson, and Justice Cushing all agreed with this reading. Writing seriatim, each rejected Georgia’s invocation of sovereign immunity by looking to “the direct and explicit declaration of the Constitution itself” that “[t]he judicial power of the United States shall extend to controversies, between a state and citizens of another State.”\n\nJustice Iredell dissented, but, crucially, he still agreed that where the judicial Power did extend, the Constitution overrode state sovereign immunity. Iredell wrote, “[t]he Judicial power is of a peculiar kind. . . . So far as States under the Constitution can be made legally liable to this authority, . . . their individual sovereignty is in this respect limited.”\n\nIredell’s disagreement lay, instead, with the majority’s “unqualified” construction of the State-Citizen Diversity Clause. Iredell insisted that a distinction should be drawn between that part of Article III concerning what he called “the special objects of authority of the general Government” and that part which “uses the word ‘controversies’ only.” In drawing this distinction, Iredell became the first Justice to articulate the two-tiered theory of sovereign immunity, although he did so across scattered sections of his opinion (which are stitched together here) :\n\nIn the conveyance of the part of the judicial power which . . . [concerns the] authorities of the general Government . . . it must be admitted [that Congress’s powers] are full and discretionary, within the restrictions of the Constitution itself . . . . [There,] the separate sovereignties of the States are blended in one common mass of supremacy . . . and the Legislature of the United States may pass all laws necessary to give such Judicial Authority its proper effect. . . . [Y]et in whatever character this [first tier of judicial power] may place a State, this can only afford a reason for a new law, calculated to effectuate the powers of the General Government in this new case . . . .\n\n[By contrast, where the judicial] authority extends only to the decisions of controversies in which a State is a party . . . . [I doubt] the true construction of the Constitution . . . authoris[es] the Legislature to provide laws for the decision of all possible controversies in which a State may be involved with an individual, without regard to any prior exemption . . . . [Instead,] it is incumbent upon us to enquire, whether previous to the adoption of the Constitution . . . an action of the nature like this before the Court could have been maintained against one of the States in the Union upon the principles of the common law. . . . If it could, I think it is now maintainable here: If it could not, I think . . . it is not maintainable; whatever opinion may be entertained upon the construction of the Constitution, as to the power of Congress to authorize such a one.\n\nAfter setting forth this two-tiered framework, which Iredell had evidently developed while sitting on the Federal Circuit for the District of Georgia, he applied it to the dispute at hand. Because Chisholm’s assumpsit claim implicated only the State-Citizen Diversity Clause and therefore Article III’s second tier (no argument about the Contracts Clause was considered in Iredell’s opinion), Iredell reasoned that Georgia’s “antecedent” sovereign immunity rights survived and, in this Controversy, should operate to bar the suit. In describing the contours of the antecedent law, Iredell explained that “in England, certain judicial proceedings not inconsistent with the sovereignty, may take place against the Crown, but . . . an action of assumpsit will not lie”; thus, he concluded, “a contract with [the State] Legislature . . . [is] made on the public faith alone.”\n\nDespite the renown of this Iredell dissent, the legal community has overlooked the two-tiered analysis that is present within its pages. There are two probable explanations why.\n\nFirst, Iredell’s constitutional musings were dicta. He described them as his strong “present opinion” but ultimately grounded his dissent on the absence of a federal statute authorizing the relief sought by Chisholm. For Iredell, an authorizing statute was necessary before any suit could possibly go forward against a State, no matter what tier of Article III was involved.\n\nThe second reason concerns Iredell’s obfuscating claim that he was “strongly against any construction of [the Constitution], which will admit, under any circumstances, a compulsive suit against a State for the recovery of money.” This sentence in the opinion is often read as a broad endorsement of state sovereign immunity, and hence as evidence that Iredell perceived an atextual and plenary limit on the extent of Article III judicial Power. But, in truth, it is the product of Iredell’s restrictive understanding of Article I’s Necessary and Proper Clause. As his dissent explained, Congress, in legislating to give content to the federal law underlying the first tier of Article III, “may pass all laws necessary to give [the] Judicial Authority its proper effect” and State “sovereignty is in this respect limited. But it is limited no farther than the necessary execution of such authority requires.” In consequence, Iredell explained, a federal statute authorizing a compulsory monetary recovery against a State might, in theory, be constitutional, but only “upon the supposition that the judicial authority of the United States, as it respects States, cannot be effectuated, without proceeding against them in that light: a position I by no means admit.” Notably, Iredell was also careful to separate out the distinct question of damages from “the general one, viz. Whether, a State can in any instance be sued?”\n\nIn short, the impediment to federal damages actions against States was not, for Iredell, the antecedent law of sovereign immunity; it was the limited nature of Congress’s Article I powers. But the impediment to state-law damages actions like Chisholm’s was indeed sovereign immunity: where the Constitution “uses the word ‘controversies’ only” “the principles of the [antecedent] law” are controlling in determining if a suit “is not maintainable,” “whatever opinion may be entertained . . . as to the power of Congress to authorize such a one.” The upshot, Iredell wrote elsewhere, was that outside of a few important “instance[s]” the Constitution and laws of the United States would operate “upon Individuals & not States.”\n\nIf this reading of Iredell’s opinion is correct, then his two-tiered theory of sovereign immunity is nearly identical to the one advocated for in this Article, outside of two small potential differences.\n\nFirst, Iredell’s opinion suggests that, across all Cases and Controversies, a State cannot be sued sans what he called a “new law” (i.e., a statute authorizing jurisdiction and furnishing a remedy against a State). This Article’s understanding is largely the same; it views the judicial Power as no more or less than the authority to render final and binding judgments under the applicable law where a court has statutory jurisdiction. For that reason, a State necessarily cannot be adjudged liable sans an independent law conferring jurisdiction and extending a cause of action against a State. However, this Article does recognize a possible exception for constitutional claims, as will be discussed later; it is unclear from Iredell’s Chisholm opinion whether he would agree.\n\nSecond, Iredell’s restrictive understanding of the Necessary and Proper Clause conflicts with the more permissive reading adopted in McCulloch v. Maryland. If one adheres to McCulloch, then Congress would have more room than Iredell would afford it under Article I to determine whether monetary remedies against States are necessary and proper vis-à-vis giving the “Judicial Authority its proper effect.”\n\nIII. The Eleventh Amendment and the Precedential Emergence of a Two-Tiered Theory of Sovereign Immunity\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court award Chisholm his writ, the Court’s judgment went unenforced. The reaction to Chisholmappeared to be “almost uniformly hostile.” The majority had made a mockery of Marshall, Madison, and Hamilton’s assurances that the payment of public debts would remain a matter of State grace and not judicial compulsion. Proposals to overturn Chisholm appeared almost immediately but gaining the political capital necessary to amend the Constitution still took time.\n\nA. Framing the Eleventh Amendment\n\nA year would pass between Chisholm and Congress’s transmission of the Eleventh Amendment to the States. Another would go by before the Amendment reached the three-fourths ratification threshold. During the interim, pressure to overturn the Court’s reading of Article III continued to build.\n\nLegislators from Georgia hardly needed more convincing on this score, but they gained allies in Massachusetts after the filing of another politically explosive case, Vassall v. Massachusetts. Vassall v. Massachusetts, in 5 Documentary History, supra note 199, at 352; see also Lash, supra note 77, at 1554–56. For an overview of other early suits between individuals and States, which likely generated additional interest in overturning Chisholm, see Jacobs, supranote 197. William Vassall was a British subject who moved from Boston to Great Britain before the Revolutionary War. Sensing Loyalism, Massachusetts officials decided to sell Vassall’s mansion and auction off his furniture. That behavior prompted Vassall to file suit against the State in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nWhile essentially no pleadings from this lawsuit survive, correspondence between Vassall and his lawyers suggests that Vassall sued Massachusetts on state-law claims of “Detinue, or Trover & Conversion” to recover funds held in probate after the auction and possibly to also seek damages related to the sale of the home. Vassall’s lawyers also strategized about defensively invoking the Treaty of Paris, if Massachusetts attempted to rely on a state statute purporting to authorize the confiscation of Loyalist property. But, importantly, there is no evidence to suggest that in Vassall the plaintiff sought to transmogrify the Treaty of Paris into an independent cause of action; the Treaty, by its terms, did not provide a judicial remedy against a confiscatory State and, instead, merely tasked Congress with recommending to States that they make full restitution of any confiscated property.\n\nVassall’s suit against Massachusetts caused a stir. As news of the complaint began to spread, newspapers and pamphlets inveighed that the Chisholm decision would soon enable a “dirty Tory Traitor” to drag States into federal court. The general outcry prompted Governor Hancock to call a special session of the Massachusetts General Court, where, on September 18, 1793, he delivered a seemingly Iredellian message on solving the Chisholm problem. Hancock first expressed doubt as to\n\nWhether the provision in the Federal constitution for the extension of the judiciary power to states, is intended to be exercised in matters of civil contract” rather than “only . . . giv[ing] a remedy for such injuries as . . . have a tendency to destroy the peace of the Union, or involve the nation in a war with foreign powers.\n\nHancock then added that, to his mind, it was a distinct question—one not necessarily put at issue by Vassall—whether States could be held liable under “the judiciary power” if recompense were demanded of them under “the law of nations, the Constitution of the United States, and existing treaties.”\n\nThe General Court’s response to Vassall was less nuanced than Hancock’s. The legislature voted to demand a constitutional amendment removing any provision that “can be construed to imply or justify a decision that a State is compellable to answer in any suit by an individual or individuals in any Court of the United States.” As for litigating Vassall itself, the legislature sent instructions to Hancock that “no answer [will] be made” by Massachusetts in the case.\n\nBy this time there was widespread national interest in overruling Chisholm and halting proceedings in Vassall, but the question of how best to do so lingered. Two proposals had already taken hold in Congress, both introduced shortly after Chisholm was decided but before the Vassall complaint was filed. Representative Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts, a Federalist channeling sentiments similar to those later expressed by the Massachusetts General Court, called for a broad constitutional amendment prohibiting States from being “made a party defendant, in any of the judicial courts . . . at the suit of any person or persons.” Senator Caleb Strong, also a Federalist of Massachusetts, proposed an early version of what would eventually become the Eleventh Amendment: “The Judicial Power of the United States shall not extend to any Suits in Law or Equity commenced or prosecuted against any one of the United States by Citizens of another State or by Citizens or Subjects of any foreign State.” Strong’s proposal, unlike Sedgwick’s, said nothing of suits by nondiverse, in-state citizens. The legal world has long since debated the reason for that omission.\n\nAlthough determining why the Eleventh Amendment omits mention of nondiverse citizens is in a sense an impossible task, particularly given its sparse ratification record, we do know that Strong’s proposal ultimately attracted widespread support as Federalists and Antifederalists alike overwhelmingly voted for it. Given that piece of evidence, it is perhaps worth recalling propositions that delegates of all political stripes generally agreed upon during the Virginia ratifying convention. One was that Article III’s extension of judicial Power to “all” federal question, ambassadorial, and admiralty Cases was largely seen as appropriate given the intimate connection between such disputes and important national interests such as preventing war, safeguarding interstate commerce, and forestalling constitutional violations. Moreover, with respect to this first tier of Cases, not a soul during the Virginia ratifying convention contended that state sovereign immunity would persist as a potential barrier to the resolution of such disputes on the merits. At the same time, however, there was widespread agreement that the Controversy Clauses should not authorize compulsory suits against States (opinion was, of course, divided on whether they did).\n\nChisholm had been decided in spite of the general consensus with respect to the Controversy Clauses. Thus, as Clark has written, the decision weighed heavily on the minds of both parties: “Antifederalists . . . felt that Federalists had played a game of ‘bait and switch,’” while “Federalists were equally disappointed with the Court’s decision because it contradicted their earlier assurances.”\n\nIt is quite plausible, then, that a constitutional amendment restoring the Federalists’ assurances that were eroded by Chisholm but which left the first tier of Article III untouched would have attracted broad support from both Federalists and Antifederalists. There is, in contrast, less reason to believe that Federalists and Antifederalists alike would have overwhelmingly supported handicapping the federal courts’ ability to decide constitutional, treaty, ambassadorial, and admiralty disputes on the merits (i.e., the very Cases where it was seen as “so necessary and expedient that the judicial power should correspond with the legislative . . . that it has not been objected to”).\n\nAmong commentators who contend that there was, despite appearances, a political consensus in favor of a broad elimination of federal jurisdiction across even the first-tier Cases, one oft-discussed piece of evidence is an amendment to Strong’s proposal put forth by the Antifederalist Senator Albert Gallatin of Pennsylvania. Gallatin moved the Senate to insert an exception for “cases arising under treaties”:\n\nThe judicial power of the United States, except in cases arising under treaties, made under the authority of the United States, shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States, by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.\n\nThe Senate voted overwhelmingly to reject the Gallatin proposal. There are a number of ways to understand the Senate’s decision. But it is a mistake to afford any one of them much weight.\n\nSome commentators view the rejection by the Senate as decisive evidence that it intended the Eleventh Amendment, as Strong had written it, to restrict the judicial Power over Cases arising under treaties, and, by implication, other federal question disputes. But other explanations abound. Another possibility, discussed in detail below, is that Strong’s version of the Amendment was appropriately read to not affect any Cases arising under Article III’s first tier including disputes arising under treaties. And if that is how Senators understood it, then Gallatin’s express carve-out for just treaty Cases would have bungled the drafting and imperiled the continued extension of judicial Power to “all” constitutional, ambassadorial, and admiralty disputes.\n\nIndeed, it is hard to see how Gallatin’s proposal could be read to do anything besides obliterate the judicial Power over everything aside from treaty Cases. Thus, the only reason to vote for the Gallatin proposal would be if a Senator strongly felt that treaties alone should be capable of overriding state sovereign immunity. It is exceedingly dubious that any member of the founding generation held that view. Why prefer a treaty to the Constitution itself? If the concern is preserving relationships with foreign powers, why exclude ambassadorial or admiralty Cases?\n\nIn short, Gallatin’s proposal was fundamentally silly. Of course, the Senate, by an overwhelming margin, voted against it. It is thus a fool’s errand to suggest that the Senate’s rejection of Gallatin’s proposal supports any particular reading of the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nNonetheless, some commentators, citing Vassall, have speculated that those voting against Gallatin’s proposal must have affirmatively intended to qualify the judicial Power over treaty Cases given the widespread sentiment that Vassallshould not be permitted to sue Massachusetts without consent. But there are a number of holes in this account. For one, Senator Strong proposed his amendment before the Vassall complaint was filed; like Representative Sedgwick, Strong submitted his amendment soon after the Chisholm opinion came down. And even more significantly, Vassall, from all appearances, was not a dispute “arising under” a treaty. Although Vassall’s lawyers discussed defensively invoking the Treaty of Paris if Massachusetts sought to defend the action by pointing to a state statute authorizing the confiscation of Loyalist property, the Treaty of Paris, as written, gave Vassall neither a cause of action nor a federal remedy. Further, there is no evidence that the Vassall complaint purported to set forth a treaty-based cause of action (which would have been doomed to fail in any event). The real threat, instead, was that Vassall and other suspected Loyalists with confiscated property might sue States on what Governor Hancock had called “matters of civil contract,” such as the state-law claims of “Detinue, or Trover & Conversion” that were mentioned in Vassall’s correspondence with his lawyers. In short, from all appearances, a constitutional amendment addressing only the Chisholm Court’s understanding of Article III’s Diversity Clauses would have adequately protected Massachusetts against the Vassall litigation, without also risking a state of affairs whereby “treaties might be substantially frustrated by regulations of the States.”\n\nAs for the Vassall litigation itself, Massachusetts never entered an appearance, and the Supreme Court never rendered a decision, most likely because Vassall failed to prosecute the case. Once Congress voted in favor of the Eleventh Amendment, Vassall wrote an associate: “my Action falls of Course.” He was doubtless right as a legal matter—at least once the Eleventh Amendment was actually ratified—and the question, now, is precisely why the Amendment had that effect.\n\nB. Returning to Text: A Two-Tiered View of the Eleventh Amendment\n\nAs ratified, the Eleventh Amendment provides: “The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” Three interpretations of this text dominate the literature. This Article offers a fourth.\n\nThe broad interpretation. The modern Court along with scholars like Kurt Lash and Sachs (and Nelson to a certain extent) have read the Eleventh Amendment less for its text and more for its confirmation of a historical “presupposition” that the antecedent law of sovereign immunity operates as a background constitutional constraint. This is a “broad” presupposition, in the sense that the antecedent law of sovereign immunity is understood to intrude on even the first tier of Article III.\n\nThe literal reading. Some scholars as well as Justices Thomas and Gorsuch read the Eleventh Amendment as expressly barring federal courts from hearing any dispute in which a State is sued by a citizen of another State. “Any means any” on this account; it matters not if the dispute concerns a federal question, or even, in a departure from current doctrine, if the defendant State consents.\n\nThis literal reading of the Eleventh Amendment, best associated with Professor Lawrence Marshall and now more recently with Baude and Sachs, understands the Amendment as an independent and highly specific restriction on the scope of judicial Power. Whether the antecedent law of sovereign immunity constitutes another limitation is an entirely separate question, which the literal reading itself does not necessarily purport to answer. As Justice Gorsuch recently put the point, it is entirely possible for States to have both a literal “Eleventh Amendment immunity . . . derive[d] from the text of the Eleventh Amendment” and a broad “structural immunity” sounding in antecedent, common-law doctrines that one presumes to be incorporated by the Constitution as a limit on Article III judicial Power.\n\nThe diversity interpretation. A large number of scholars, and some dissenting Justices on the modern Court, read the Eleventh Amendment as an amendatory (as opposed to explanatory) one, which edits the language in the State-Citizen and Foreign-State Diversity Clauses. In Justice Brennan’s seminal formulation of the diversity interpretation, the Eleventh Amendment alters these two Clauses alone such that a State can no longer “be sued in federal court where the [sole] basis of jurisdiction [i]s that the plaintiff [i]s a citizen of another State or an alien.”\n\nThe diversity interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment, much like the literal reading, does not itself address whether States enjoy constitutionalized sovereign immunity privileges in disputes arising under other provisions in Article III. That said, many diversity theorists also maintain that the reasoning underlying Chisholm emerged largely unscathed, such that under Article III there is “no constitutional principle of state sovereign immunity.”\n\nThe two-tiered view. This Article advocates for reading the Eleventh Amendment as an explanatory reminder, coming in the wake of Chisholm and Vassall, that the second tier of Article III never extended the judicial Power to “all Controversies.” By admonishing the Court that the “Judicial Power . . . shall not be construed” to extend to some Controversies—namely, those “commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State”—the text of the Eleventh Amendment announces the precise qualification that Attorney General Randolph and the Chisholm majority wrongly thought was absent from the original Article III.\n\nIn other words, the Eleventh Amendment clarifies that under the Diversity Clauses, there always was, as Marshall, Madison, Iredell, and others had insisted, “a difficulty in making a state defendant, which does not prevent its being plaintiff.” Further, by clarifying the scope of the “some” that is impliedly present in the second tier of Article III, the Eleventh Amendment effectively ratified the two-tiered understanding effectively put forward by Marshall, Hamilton, Madison, and Iredell.\n\nFor three reasons, the two-tiered view represents a highly plausible account of the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nFirst, the two-tiered view offers a reasonable account of the events leading up to the Eleventh Amendment. Many jurists view the Amendment as an “explanatory” one, and for good reason. It seems likely that its framers meant to elevate the positions of Marshall, Madison, Hamilton, and Iredell that Article III, as originally written, preserved the ability of States to resist suits by individuals seeking to compel the payment of wartime debt. After all, Chisholm expressly rejected that quadrumvirate’s careful interpretation of the Diversity Clauses, reading them instead to be “unqualified” and “in no respect indicating who is to be Plaintiff or who Defendant.” The Eleventh Amendment responded to the Court in its own terms, and its text—“the judicial Power shall not be construed to extend” (which was chosen by the Senate over the simpler “shall not extend” )—even reflects that the error was one of misconstruction. And thus, as Justice Scalia has persuasively written, the Eleventh Amendment “reflected . . . a repudiation of the premise upon which [Chisholm] was based, namely, that Article III’s jurisdictional grants over the States are unlimited by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.”\n\nAt the same time, however, the two-tiered view arguably accommodates these same historical premises better than Scalia’s own broad interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment. Proponents of the broad interpretation attempt to derive their “presupposition” that the Constitution incorporates the antecedent law of sovereign immunity in large part from Hamilton’s The Federalist No. 81, from Marshall’s and Madison’s remarks during the Virginia ratifying convention, and from Iredell’s Chisholm dissent. But proponents of the broad interpretation appear to misinterpret these sources in contending that “the most natural reading” of them “would preclude all federal jurisdiction over an unconsenting State.” Au contraire! As we have seen, these members of the founding generation only suggested that state sovereign immunity would limit the judicial Power over second-tier Controversies. By way of contrast, Marshall remarked that in Article III’s “first class,” the judicial Power covered “all the cases described, without making in its terms any exception whatever”; Hamilton insisted that the Constitution, in limited instances, did permit an “alienation of State sovereignty”; Madison contended that States were subject to “control of the general government” and their powers “effectual only [to the extent] they are not contradictory to the general Confederation”; and Justice Iredell opined that the antecedent law of sovereign immunity was relevant only to that part of Article III which “uses the word ‘controversies’ only.”\n\nSecond, moving beyond history, the two-tiered view can accommodate the strangely limited text of the Eleventh Amendment to an extent matched only by the literal interpretation. If the Eleventh Amendment’s framers wished to solidify a broad sovereign immunity doctrine, they could have ratified Representative Sedgwick’s proposal and removed the judicial Power from “any” case by “any person” suing a State. Congress instead adopted Senator Strong’s proposal, which, of course, mentioned only suits by out-of-state citizens. And there is a near-perfect match between the two-tiered view and the text of the Amendment as ratified. The two-tiered view avers that Chisholm got it wrong in construing the judicial Power to extend to all Controversies between States and out-of-state citizens (and similarly to citizens of foreign states). The Eleventh Amendment says essentially the same thing: it directs that the judicial Power “shall not be construed to extend” to Controversies commenced by diverse citizens against States. Why not mention suits commenced by nondiverse, in-state citizens? Easy: because Article III’s second tier never extended the judicial Power to Controversies between a State and its own citizens in the first place.\n\nThe only potential textual strike against the two-tiered view is the Eleventh Amendment’s use of the phrase “any suit” as opposed to “all” or “every” suit, when declaring the appropriate construction of the judicial Power’s extent. The “any suit” phrasing might reflect that States cannot consent to lawsuits brought by diverse citizens notwithstanding that the antecedent law of sovereign immunity would generally permit these suits to go forward with consent. Even assuming, arguendo, that this reading is correct, it is important to observe that the Eleventh Amendment is suggesting that a “some” be read into the Diversity Clauses, given that the Amendment is on any account of it preserving a State’s ability to sue as plaintiff. But in any event, and contrary to the literal reading, the Framers almost certainly meant to deny the judicial Power to just some suits filed against States by diverse citizens; that is, to direct only that the judicial Power not extend to “all” such suits. Indeed, practically everyone outside of proponents of the literal interpretation has read the Eleventh Amendment that way, so as to preserve a both federal courts’ authority to hear diverse plaintiffs’ suits on matters of state law with a State’s consent as well as federal judicial authority to resolve federal question cases involving these sets of litigants.\n\nThere are a number of dimensions along which one might justify doing so. One is the textual variation in Article III. As one of the lawyers in Cohens v. Virginia put the point, it would seem that “[t]he term ‘all cases,’ means all, without exception; and the States of the Union cannot be excepted, by implication . . . . [Whereas the Eleventh] amendment to the constitution respecting the suability of States, merely applies to the other class of cases.” In a similar vein, Justice Souter has observed that the text of the Eleventh Amendment “precisely track[s] the language in Article III providing for citizen-state diversity jurisdiction,” making it odd to read it as also modifying, for example, the Federal Question Clause. Further, given that the historical record suggests that the Eleventh Amendment was enacted “primarily to protect States from being sued for their debts,” it also seems significant that this concern regarding compulsory debt collection could adequately be addressed by eliminating the judicial Power over state-law actions against nonconsenting States. After all, federal law, including the Treaty of Paris and (as will be seen) the Constitution’s Contracts Clause, did not at that time provide for any compulsory damages recoveries against States.\n\nThe literal reading, in contrast, insists that “any suit” really means “any suit,” and whenever an out-of-state citizen sues a State—even for a violation of the Constitution, or even if a State consents—federal courts cannot adjudicate the dispute. But oddly enough, the literal view also suggests that federal courts can exercise their judicial Power over such disputes when they are prosecuted by nondiverse citizens. To contend, as the literal view doe"
