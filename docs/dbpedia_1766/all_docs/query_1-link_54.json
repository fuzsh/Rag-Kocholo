        "text": "In the government, there are three main branches. These branches are known as executive, legislative, and judicial. The three branches were created to divide power in the federal government. The reasoning for the division of power is so that not one group or person would have too much power. “The delegates were afraid that if a small group received too much power, the United States would wind up under the rule of another dictator or tyrant” (Kids.gov A Safe Place to Learn and Play, 2017). Each branch has a unique job, and there are different heads of a branch. Meaning each branch is ran by a different group of people.\n\nAccording to the constitution of the United States the federal government is divided up into three branches to ensure an equal and balanced government and to make sure that no one or branch of government has too much power. The three branches are the legislative branch, executive branch, and the judicial branch. Each branch serves different purposes in the United States federal government and each branch is made up of different federal government employees. For example, the legislative branch make the laws. The legislative branch has the power to impeach the U.S. President and declare war. The legislative branch is made up of U.S. Congress which include the Senate and House of Representatives. Then there’s the executive branch which carry\n\nThe framers of the Constitution created a system that divides the power and prevents one of the three branches of government from obtaining too much control over the other branches. This system is called check and balances. This ensures that the branches must work together in order to complete the important work of the American government. The three branches of the United States government are the Legislative branch, the Executive branch, and the Judicial branch. All three of the branches have their own responsibilities, however, because of the checks and balance system, they can be put back into check if one branch begins to become more powerful than another.\n\nThe Separation of Powers formulated by the composers of the Constitution was intended to do one essential thing: to keep the greater part from ruthless control. In light of their experience, the designers shied far from giving any branch of the new government a lot of power. The separation of power gives an arrangement of shared force known as Checks and Balances. The three Branches that are created in the Constitution are the Legislatives (consisted of House and Senate), the Executive (consisted of the President, Vice President, the Departments), and the Judicial (consisted of Federal and Supreme Court). All branches come with certain powers and those powers limited or checked by another branch. This system is designed that way so that\n\nIn the Constitution of the United States, there exists a system of checks of balances that has kept the three branches of government in check. Through this system, the Constitution is able to limit the powers of government in order to protect the rights of individuals.This system keeps the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government from trying to gain more power and makes sure that each branch is balanced. The Framers believed that creating separate branches of government would help to limit the powers of the national government and to prevent tyranny in the nation. These three branches and their roles in the government are as follows: the legislative branch, which is run by Congress, includes the Senate and the House of Representatives and has the power, under the Constitution, to make laws ;the executive branch, run by the President, executes or carries out laws; and the Supreme Court, which the Constitution established to head the judicial branch, which interprets and applies the law in federal court cases.\n\nThe government of the United States consists of three branches: the legislative, judicial and executive. The legislative branch, also called Congress, makes our laws and is divided into 2 parts, one called the Senate and the other House of Representatives. The judicial branch includes the Supreme Court where judges interpret laws, according to the Constitution, and can consider if laws passed by Congress are constitutional or not. The executive branch is administered by the President of the United States and he enforces the laws that the legislative branch (Congress) makes. The way the government is set up, the three branches rely on each other to check each others powers in order to make sure that one branch does not have more power over the\n\nThe United States government broken down into three branches, Executive, Judicial, and Legislative, and reason being is to separate the powers of government so that one branch is less likely to overpower another. This method is called “separation of powers” and “ checks and balances these were created by the founders of United States. Their jobs are to enforce, interpret, and create laws to guarantee basic rights to all American citizens\n\nThe United States of America has three separate but equal branches of government: the executive branch, the legislative branch and the judicial branch. All of these branches are different and have an essential function in our government. They are all established in the first three Articles of the United States Constitution. The executive branch is responsible for seeing to it that the laws are carried out. The legislative branch is in charge of passing the laws and allocating funds. The judicial branch has the primary function of challenging legislation or interpreting such legislation. The Framer of our Constitution did not want one single entity to have more power than the others. So this never occurred, they establish a system of checks and balances. The power of the executive can be checked by the legislative, which can refuse to confirm its appointees and the power\n\nDuring the creation of the Constitution the Founding fathers then divided the powers among three different branches of government. The three branches of government are legislative, executive, and judicial. They separated branches and made them different from each other but also equal, not allowing any branch to have more power than the other. The Founding Fathers of the branches realized that in order to give the people the kind of government that they were trying to put together; they knew they needed to put a system where each branch can take responsibilities for its own decisions. Therefore, this is how the checks and balances system occurred. This is how each branch works by itself, each of them has a specific responsibility. However, each\n\nThe “checks and balances” system was created to keep the freshly established government in control and to make sure that neither of branches of the government getting too powerful but possessing power equally. The United States of America government is composed of the three main branches that separated the duty and power of the government. Each branch has different responsibilities but they work together at the same time to make the government run smoothly and guarantee the rights for citizens. The first branch is the Executive Branch, which is represented by the office of the Presidency and the President, who carries out the laws is the head of this branch. The second branch is Legislative Branch, which is represented by the House of Representative and the Senate combining into one body called Congress who makes the laws. The third branch of the U.S government is the Judicial Branch which is made up the law system and evaluates the laws, includes of judges who are nominated by the President and approved by the Senate in order to be one of nine Supreme\n\nThe purpose of the government was that the founding fathers wanted a system of checks and balances where not one branch had more power than the other, They split the United States government into three branches, they are the Executive branch, The legislative branch, and The Judicial branch. The branches are meant to be separate, but have equal power. Each branch checks over the other branches to make sure of that. This system was made to prevent tyranny, an oppressive and cruel government, to happen again like King George III. Although they’re supposed to be equal, it’s arguable that the legislative branch is the most powerful branch because they have the power of impeachment and power of the purse. They also have power to approve presidential\n\nThe Constitution provides a system of checks and balances through implementing three different branches of Government. In order to mitigate a dictatorship, the framers of the Constitution set up a system that would equally distribute the powers throughout each branch. (Kelly, Martin) While each of the three have a substantial amount of control, there are still possible restrictions that may be enforced by the others. These three are known as the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches.\n\nA study of constitutional governments shows that they are often divided into three different groups or branches. The power of government is not given to any one branch. Instead, some of the power is given to each branch. This is called separation of powers. For example, we divide our government into the following three branches: the legislative branch has the power to make laws the executive branch has the power to carry out and enforce laws the judicial branch has the power to manage conflicts about the meaning, application, and enforcement of\n\nIn the United States government there are 3 branches of government, the power given to the central government is divided among these 3 branches. Each of these branches are given powers so that they can check the powers of the other 2 branches ensuring that one branch doesn’t become to powerful One of these branches is the legislative branch this is the branch that includes congress, they are responsible for making laws. The second branch of government is the executive branch this is the branch that includes the president, they are responsible for carrying out laws. The last branch of government is the judicial branch, this branch includes the Supreme Court they are responsible for making sure laws are constitutional. There many different"
