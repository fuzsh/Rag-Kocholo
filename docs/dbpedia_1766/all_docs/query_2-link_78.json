The final rule updates and revises the regulations issued under section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act implementing the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for executive, administrative, and professional (EAP) employees. Revisions include increases to the standard salary level and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold, and a mechanism that provides for the timely and efficient updating of these earnings thresholds to reflect current earnings data.\n\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local governments. Covered nonexempt workers are entitled to a minimum wage of not less than $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009. Overtime pay at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay is required after 40 hours of work in a workweek.\n\nFLSA Minimum Wage: The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009. Many states also have minimum wage laws. In cases where an employee is subject to both state and federal minimum wage laws, the employee is entitled to the higher minimum wage.\n\nFLSA Overtime: Covered nonexempt employees must receive overtime pay for hours worked over 40 per workweek (any fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 hours – seven consecutive 24-hour periods) at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay. There is no limit on the number of hours employees 16 years or older may work in any workweek. The FLSA does not require overtime pay for work on weekends, holidays, or regular days of rest, unless overtime is worked on such days.\n\nHours Worked: Hours worked ordinarily include all the time during which an employee is required to be on the employer’s premises, on duty, or at a prescribed workplace.\n\nRecordkeeping: Employers must display an official poster outlining the requirements of the FLSA. Employers must also keep employee time and pay records.\n\nChild Labor: These provisions are designed to protect the educational opportunities of minors and prohibit their employment in jobs and under conditions detrimental to their health or well-being.\n\nOn January 10, 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor published a final rule Employee or Independent Contractor Classification Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, effective March 11, 2024, revising the Department’s guidance on how to analyze who is an employee or independent contractor under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This final rule rescinds the Independent Contractor Status Under the Fair Labor Standards Act rule (2021 IC Rule, 86 FR 1168), that was published on January 7, 2021. This guidance will be updated.\n\nGeneral Guidance\n\nHandy Reference Guide to the FLSA\n\nGuía Práctica Referente a la Ley de Normas Justas de Trabajo\n\nFact Sheets\n\nEmployment Law Guide: Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay\n\nQuestions and Answers about the FLSA\n\nInformation on Furloughs and Other Reductions in Pay\n\nBreak Time for Nursing Mothers\n\n'How to File a Complaint' Card (PDF)\n\nSpanish Version (PDF)\n\nChinese Version (PDF)\n\nKorean Version (PDF)\n\nPolish Version (PDF)\n\nTagalog Version (PDF)\n\nThai Version (PDF)\n\nRussian Version (PDF)\n\nVietnamese Version (PDF)\n\nHaitian Creole Version (PDF)\n\nFLSA Resources for Puerto Rico\n\nMisclassification of Employees as Independent Contractors\n\nMinimum Wage and Overtime Pay for Direct Care Workers\n\nHoliday Season Employment Information\n\nCOVID-19 or Other Public Health Emergencies and the FLSA\n\nPosters\n\nFLSA Minimum Wage Poster\n\nSpanish Version\n\nChinese Version (PDF)\n\nRussian Version (PDF)\n\nThai Version (PDF)\n\nHmong Version (PDF)\n\nVietnamese Version (PDF)\n\nKorean Version (PDF)\n\nPolish Version (PDF)\n\nHaitian Creole Version (PDF)\n\nAdditional FLSA Posters\n\nInterpretive Guidance\n\nAdministrator Interpretations\n\nOpinion Letters\n\nField Handbook\n\nField Bulletins\n\nE-tools\n\nThe Coverage and Employment Status Advisor helps identify which workers are employees covered by the FLSA.\n\nThe Hours Worked Advisor provides information to help determine which hours spent in work-related activities are considered FLSA “hours worked” and therefore must be paid.\n\nThe Overtime Security Advisor helps determine which employees are exempt from the FLSA minimum wage and overtime pay requirements under the Part 541 overtime regulations.\n\nThe Overtime Calculator Advisor computes the amount of overtime pay due in a sample pay period based on information from the user.\n\nThe Child Labor Rules Advisor answers questions about the FLSA’s youth employment provisions, including at what age young people can work and the jobs they can perform.\n\nThe Section 14(c) Advisor helps users understand the special minimum wage requirements for workers with disabilities.\n\nPresentations\n\nComprehensive FLSA Presentation (Microsoft PowerPoint)\n\nExecutive, Administrative, and Professional Exemption Presentation (Microsoft PowerPoint)\n\nApplicable Laws and Regulations\n\nLaw\n\nFair Labor Standards Act\n\nRegulations\n\n29 CFR Chapter V\n\nCivil Money Penalty Inflation Adjustments\n\nStarting in 2016, agencies across the federal government must adjust their penalties for inflation each year.
