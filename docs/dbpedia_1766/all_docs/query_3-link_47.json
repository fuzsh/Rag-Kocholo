        "text": "About the Court Statistics Project\n\nThe Court Statistics Project (CSP) — a joint project of the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) and the Conference of State Court Administrators (COSCA) — publishes caseload data from the courts of the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. These data are provided by the offices of the state court administrator in those jurisdictions. The data reported here conform to the definitions and case counting rules in the State Court Guide to Statistical Reporting (Guide). States publish their own data that may be more extensive, although not directly comparable to other states for a variety of reasons, including differences in court structure, case definitions and counting practices, court rules, statutes, or terminology. The experience of the CSP staff, along with adherence to the Guide's reporting framework, ensures comparability of the data reported to CSP. The support and partnership of COSCA, the Conference of Chief Justices, the National Conference of Appellate Court Clerks and NACM are an essential part of our success."
