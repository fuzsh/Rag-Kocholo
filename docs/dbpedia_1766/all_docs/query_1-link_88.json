James Madison believed that if one individual or small group held possession or control of all three branches, then he would consider that to be a tyrannical situation- a limit of citizen rights, voice, and freedom. Each branch holds a different role that affects a certain situation pertaining to which process of law development their responsibility is, as long as each branch is separated and distinct there will be liberty and rights for people. There has to many contributors of government that have different views and different ideas in order to achieve a tyranny-free society (James Madison, Federalist Paper #47, 1788). The Legislative Branch is controlled by the Congress of the United States of America, which consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Legislative Branch is in charge of making new laws or changing the existing ones. The Executive Branch is led by the President of the United States, their main power is having the ability to veto or reject a proposal for a law. The Judicial Branch consists of the Supreme Court and inferior courts. The Judicial Branch is given the responsibility to interpret laws (Constitution of the United States of America, 1787). Based on judgement of James Madison's beliefs and views on the Separation of Powers and the system of Checks and Balances, if an individual was a member of both Congress and the Supreme Court Madison would believe that they held too much power in the government and see it as a violation of federalism. James believed that each branch should be separate and distinct and when you have a crossing or correspondence with the both of them, there is a decrease in a diversity of views and opinions; there is a decrease of equal right for the\n\n“It matters enormously to a successful democratic society like ours that we have three branches of government, each with some independence and some control over the other two. That 's set out in the Constitution.”(Sandra Day O’connor). In order for a government that is for the people and by the people to survive the government has to change with its people. This is seen by the United states government. While it still has the three branches originally established, the branches have changed with themselves and with how they interact with each other.\n\nThe structure of the United States Government created by the founding fathers is a foundation that holds the country together. It has gathered the trust of the American citizens and used it to make decisions that make America a better nation. The government is made up of three main branches, the Legislative branch, the Executive branch, and the Judicial branch. The branches are vital to America 's social and political integrity and the organization is considered one of the most unique forms of government in the world today. The three branches work together to face and solve the problems that confront the nation as a whole. The government changes as\n\nThe constitution was established by men who had experienced the dictatorships of Europe and had escaped from its grasp. They sought to establish a form of government that would never allow a dictatorship or tyrant ruler to hold power over the people like in the places they had fled. With their creation of the foundation of what our government is today they created a system where 3 branches were all of equal power and each could be overruled by another which prevented any branch becoming superior of another. The separation of powers provides a system of shared power called Checks and Balances.(2) The three branches are legislative, judicial and executive and they each have specific powers to\n\nAccording to the constitution of the United States the federal government is divided up into three branches to ensure an equal and balanced government and to make sure that no one or branch of government has too much power. The three branches are the legislative branch, executive branch, and the judicial branch. Each branch serves different purposes in the United States federal government and each branch is made up of different federal government employees. For example, the legislative branch make the laws. The legislative branch has the power to impeach the U.S. President and declare war. The legislative branch is made up of U.S. Congress which include the Senate and House of Representatives. Then there’s the executive branch which carry\n\nThe government of the United States of America is a federal constitutional republic. In layman 's terms, this means that the country 's national, central government and the smaller, unitary governments of the fifty states are co-equal in their power, and that the citizens of America have a say in public policies by electing representatives who voice their respective opinions. More importantly, both the central government and the state governments are subject to the supreme law of the Constitution. Under this document, the central government is set up into three branches (the legislative, executive, and judicial) that are meant to check each other and balance out power. Their cooperation insures that the national government 's control is appropriate, and does not infringe upon the rights of the average American citizen.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is not the only person running the country. The three branches of government take a vital role in what goes on in the United States. The president and the people involved in the three branches of government are the ones pulling the strings in today’s society. In the United States, there are three branches of government. Those three branches of government are the legislative, executive, and judicial. All three branches have a specific responsibility in the government.
