        "text": "The opportunity to seek relief in court from illegal governmental action has always been deemed a virtue of our form of government. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton described the federal judiciary as “the citadel of public justice and public security.”[1] In its best known and most important opinion—Marbury v. Madison—the Supreme Court of the United States declared that it is “emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”[2] Nearly two centuries later, the Court made clear in Plaut v. Spendthrift Farms, Inc. that “the Framers crafted” Article III to give “the Federal Judiciary the power, not merely to rule on cases”—that was clear from Marbury—“but to decide them, subject to review only by superior courts in the Article III hierarchy.”[3] Over the last few years, the Court has emphasized that point, ruling that while Congress may leave some legal issues to the political branches to resolve, there is a “strong presumption” that judicial review will always be available to scrutinize allegedly illegal actions taken by executive officials.[4] That is particularly true when an official acts in an unconstitutional manner because, as Hamilton explained, an unconstitutional law or action is “void.”[5]\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States recently lost an opportunity to reaffirm the centrality of judicial review to our governmental system in the context of the review of an action taken by the regulatory state. The Court recently denied a petition for a writ of certiorari in a case entitled Kansas Natural Resources Coalition v. U.S. Department of Interior (KNRC).[6] KNRC raised the issue of whether an agency’s refusal to comply with the requirements imposed on agency rulemaking set forth in a federal statute known as the Congressional Review Act (CRA)[7] is subject to judicial review.[8] By a 2-1 vote, the Tenth Circuit ruled that the CRA forecloses judicial review of an agency’s failure—or refusal—to comply with the requirements of that statute.\n\nThat technical, humdrum description of the KNRC case, however, belies the fact that the issue it decided is of considerable legal, practical, and policy importance—and that the circuit court majority got it wrong. A ruling that judicial review is available would enable the federal courts to order federal agencies to comply with CRA in the thousands of cases where agencies use rules that are not “law” to govern private conduct and threaten enforcement actions. That consequence alone would be significant because, to date, agency compliance with the CRA has been spotty at best. The issue also has considerable policy importance because it would allow the Supreme Court to spotlight a particularly corrosive form of legal gamesmanship that the Executive Branch uses to coerce private parties to knuckle under to an agency’s unlawful demands.\n\nUnfortunately, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in KNRC, which enabled the Department of the Interior to avoid offering a legitimate justification for its willful noncompliance with the CRA. It also allowed the department to avoid a public rebuke for hiding behind an ambiguous clause in a statute whose raison d’être is to prevent the government from injuring the public unless and until Congress has had the opportunity to review an agency’s newly issued “law.”.[9] That result will only further encourage federal agencies to willfully ignore the CRA, a statute that Congress enacted to ensure that agencies can be held accountable for the rules they adopt as, in Justice Scalia’s tart description, “a sort of junior-varsity Congress.”[10]\n\nI. The Congressional Review Act\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that a properly promulgated agency rule can have the force and effect of law.[11] Because quantity has a quality all its own,[12] that principle is important because federal agencies promulgate far more rules each year than Congress passes statutes.[13] As Justice Gorsuch noted two years ago, the number of agency rules adopted yearly “dwarf[s]” the number of statutes Congress enacts during the same period.[14] Agency rulemaking has effectively replaced congressional lawmaking as the primary mode of American governance.[15]\n\nThe principal statute regulating agency rulemaking is the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Congress enacted the APA in 1946 after a more than a decade of debate over the proper role of the regulatory state.[16] The act makes virtually all “final” agency actions subject to judicial review[17] and requires the federal courts to set aside any such action that is “arbitrary and capricious” or lacking “substantial” supporting evidence.[18] The APA contemplates that the federal courts will play an important role in protecting the public against an agency that exceeds its statutory authority or that engages in arbitrary or unjustified regulatory actions.\n\nSince the New Deal, Congress has wanted to be able to review agency actions itself rather await litigation. To do so, for decades Congress used a device known as the “legislative veto.”[19] It permitted either chamber to nullify an agency rule by a simple majority vote.[20] In 1982, however, the Supreme Court in INS v. Chadha[21] held the legislative veto unconstitutional on the grounds that it nullifies the President’s role in the lawmaking process guaranteed by the Article I bicameralism and presentment provisions.[22] Congress therefore needed a new way to review agency lawmaking. The CRA was its answer.\n\nEnacted in 1996, the CRA provides that, before an agency “rule”[23] can go “into effect,” the issuing agency must submit the rule to the House of Representatives and Senate so that each chamber can review its effect and vote on a bill to nullify a particular action.[24] The text of the CRA is clear about that condition because it provides as follows: “Before a rule can take effect, the Federal agency promulgating such rule shall submit to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General a report containing—(i) a copy of the rule; (ii) a concise general statement relating to the rule, including whether it is a major rule; and (iii) the proposed effective date of the rule.”[25] As one scholar has noted:\n\nThe very first sentence of the Congressional Review Act … states that, “Before a rule can take effect, the Federal agency promulgating such rule shall submit to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General” several items… . There is nothing particularly mysterious or complicated about this mandate.[26]\n\nIf a member of Congress introduces a bill to disapprove a new agency rule, the bill will come up for a vote. The vote comes up pursuant to a “fast-track” procedure that forces a quick decision on a disapproval resolution by avoiding parliamentary delays, including a Senate filibuster. If both chambers pass the disapproval resolution, it goes to the President for his signature or veto.[27]\n\nOf course, a President is unlikely to sign into law a resolution disapproving a rule that his or her administration issued, so the CRA is likely to have its greatest effect during the early days of a new administration when both the White House and Congress have changed political hands because of the prior November election. That was true at the beginning of the Trump Administration, which made use of the CRA to nullify the Obama Administration’s midnight rules.[28] Nonetheless, Congress can use a resolution as part of a negotiating process with an administration, even when one party holds power at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Regardless, one would presume that the federal courts can prevent the government from acting unlawfully. The Tenth Circuit’s decision in KNRC raised that issue.\n\nThe dispute in KNRC hinged on the meaning of a provision in the CRA addressing judicial review. Section 805 of Title 5 provides as follows: “No determination, finding, action, or omission under this chapter shall be subject to judicial review.”[29] On its face, Section 805 appears to preclude all APA review of an agency’s noncompliance with the CRA’s submission requirements. But the text of Section 805 is just one feature of the CRA, which itself is but one component of Congress’s program for judicial review of agency actions set forth in the APA.\n\nWhen the CRA is read as a whole, along with the text and purpose of the APA, it is clear that an agency rule not submitted to Congress as required by the CRA can be challenged in a pre-enforcement lawsuit brought under the APA. The government cannot enforce a rule that the CRA declares is not “law,” and the APA empowers a private party to bring a suit to prevent an agency’s unlawful conduct before it happens.[30]\n\nII. The KNRC Case\n\nThe KNRC case stemmed from a controversy over whether a bird known as the lesser prairie chicken, a member of the pheasant and grouse family, should be listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).[31] In 2012, the Department of the Interior (DOI) proposed listing the bird as a threatened species.[32] After four years of administrative proceedings and litigation, the government entered into a consent decree in which it agreed to rely on criteria set forth in a 2003 department rule when deciding how to classify the lesser prairie chicken.[33] Importantly, the DOI never submitted that 2003 rule to Congress.[34]\n\nIn 2018, the Kansas Natural Resource Coalition, an organization of western Kansas county governments, sued the department over the listing issue, claiming that it was invalid as a matter of law because the government had never submitted it to Congress, as the CRA requires.[35] The U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas dismissed the complaint on the ground that the government’s failure to comply with the CRA is not subject to judicial review.[36] On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed by a divided vote, disagreeing whether the text of the CRA forecloses any judicial challenge to an agency’s noncompliance.[37] The KNRC plaintiffs sought review in the Supreme Court, which recently turned down their request.\n\nIII. The Importance of Judicial Review to Enforcement of the CRA\n\nLike the Tenth Circuit majority in KNRC, most courts have read Section 805 as a complete bar on judicial review, including—quite paradoxically—any review over an agency’s failure to comply with the CRA.[38] Yet, that McGuffey’s Readers approach to statutory interpretation is mistaken.[39]\n\nStart with this hypothetical. Suppose the government brings a civil or administrative action (or a criminal prosecution; it’s a fielder’s choice to you) against a private party, seeking damages or a fine (or imprisonment, if you chose a criminal prosecution) in reliance on a rule that an agency did not submit to Congress. Then, ask yourself this question: May the defendant raise as a defense the fact that the government has not submitted the rule to Congress? That is, may the defendant argue that, given the government’s failure to comply with the CRA, the rule has never gone “into effect,” and that therefore the government’s case fails as a matter of law because the rule is not a “law”? The natural conclusion should be, “Of course a defendant can assert that defense. If the CRA provides that a rule cannot go ‘into effect’ unless and until the issuing agency submits the rule to Congress and waits for Congress to do nothing or fails to pass a disapproval resolution, then the rule is not yet ‘law’.”\n\nThat conclusion should be determinative. It has been true since Magna Carta in 1215[40] that the government may not deprive someone of “life, liberty, or property” without first affording him or her, in the words of the Fifth Amendment, “due process of law.”[41] Most discussions of the Due Process Clause involve the issue whether the administrative or adjudicatory process afforded a party is fundamentally fair or whether the government can undertake some deprivations at all, regardless of the fairness of the available procedures.[42] But that does not exhaust the limitations that the Due Process Clause imposes on the government. The government also cannot punish someone unless he has broken the “law,”[43] and Article I of the Constitution defines the process by which Congress can turn a “bill” into a “law.”[44] Neither a bill passed by only one house of Congress, a bill vetoed by the President (and not overridden by Congress), nor a bill introduced into Congress but never brought up for a vote are “laws” for Article I purposes. Chadha makes that clear. The CRA creates a parallel requirement for an agency “rule” to become “law”: the rule first must be submitted to Congress for its review. Noncompliance with that requirement means that an unsubmitted agency rule has not become “law,” and, in turn, that means noncompliance with the CRA is fatal to the government’s claim that someone has violated an agency rule. And if that is true, the KNRC plaintiffs were entitled to bring this pre-enforcement action to seek invalidation of the rule. Why?—Because a private party need not wait until for the “hammer” to fall before asking a federal court to protect it against unlawful government activity, as the Supreme Court unanimously held in Sackett v. EPA.[45]\n\nIn KNRC, the Tenth Circuit misread the CRA because it failed to recognize that an unsubmitted rule is not a “law” that the government can enforce. Properly viewed, the CRA works together with the APA to protect private parties against actual, threatened, or potential lawless agency action—the very type of conduct that gave rise to the need for Magna Carta and the Due Process Clause.[46] That conclusion is important because it raises the bar that the government must overcome to deny the KNRC plaintiffs their day in court. The Supreme Court has been reluctant to construe a federal statute as precluding judicial review of a claim that the government has acted unconstitutionally. Yet that is precisely what the government would be doing were it to invoke an unsubmitted agency rule as a basis for seeking to hold a private party liable in an administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding. The Tenth Circuit failed to realize that a government action rendered “unlawful” by the CRA because the agency rule has not gone “into effect” raises a claim that the agency has acted not merely without statutory authority but also unconstitutionally.[47] At a minimum, that provides a powerful reason for not construing Section 805 of the CRA as barring judicial review of a claim that an agency has violated that statute.[48]\n\nFor that reason, only the interpretation of the CRA offered here advances the purpose of both the CRA and the parent statute—the APA—of which the CRA is but one component. It has been settled law since the Supreme Court’s 1803 decision in Marbury v. Madison that it is Article III courts have the final say on the meaning of a law.[49] The APA enforces that rule by virtue of a “strong presumption” that the potentially adverse actions of a government official are subject to judicial review in a pre-enforcement action brought by a private party under the APA.[50] Yes, Congress can foreclose judicial review of a statutory issue, and sometimes it has done so. But there ordinarily is a sensible reason for preclusion, such as the belief that agency officials possess subject matter expertise that judges lack or because Congress chose to limit judicial review to challenges by particular parties.[51] Rationales like those, however, do not apply here. The Tenth Circuit never explained why a statute designed to curb agency excesses should be left in the hands of the very officials that the act was meant to control, and no reason jumps to mind. Atop that, the Supreme Court’s Chevron doctrine does not permit an agency to force a mistaken reading of a statute on the courts.[52] Furthermore, no litigant can offer a binding interpretation of a law, not even when that litigant is the Justice Department.[53] Accordingly, CRA compliance is a classic case where judicial review is necessary.\n\nTo be sure, the evident purpose of CRA’s Section 805 is to keep the courts from second-guessing decisions made by Congress and the President.[54] But the interpretation offered here would not have that intrusive effect. Section 805 would still foreclose judicial review of all actions taken under the CRA by Congress or the President—viz., by everyone other than the responsible agency. In fact, the interpretation offered here is the only one that actually serves the purpose of the CRA because it empowers the courts to bring agencies to heel for their noncompliance with that statute. Otherwise, agencies can willfully break the law and in the process, thumb their noses at Congress and the courts. It is impossible to believe that Congress ordered the courts to “see no evil” by an agency, or that it matters whether a private party raises that claim in an answer or a complaint. When read as a whole, the CRA and the APA permit the courts to call out an agency for breaking the law.\n\nIV. Agency Compliance with the CRA Is a Recurring Issue\n\nIt should surprise no one that agencies can fail to submit new rules to Congress. People are imperfect, and people staff agencies, so some number of instances of accidental or negligent noncompliance would be expected to occur. We presume that agencies will comply with the law,[55] so we would normally anticipate that the number of agency defaults would be minimal. To use the vernacular, this issue should be no biggie.\n\nBut it is, because agencies have been repeat offenders. The number of unsubmitted rules is—at a minimum—in the thousands.[56] Could that number be in the tens of thousands? The available evidence suggests that it might.[57] Agencies have made no effort to identify (let alone remedy) them all because the government is not inclined to publicize the number of instances in which its personnel broke the law. If it did, candor could generate some testy exchanges with members of Congress at budget, appropriations, and nomination hearings. That is bad for the agency’s image (and the witness’s digestion) and creates problems for any administration. The upshot for the executive branch is that agencies have no incentive to disclose their shortcomings.\n\nIn fact, the incentives work in the other direction. The reward structure under which government agencies operate compels them to generate an ever-increasing number of enforcement actions and fines because that is how agencies justify their budgets.[58] Every budget season, agencies march up to Capitol Hill with reports, charts, and written statements explaining how they used their past inputs (e.g., appropriations, personnel) to generate past outputs (e.g., an increased number of new enforcement actions taken), rather than present or future outcomes (e.g., overall decreases in crime or improvement in public health). Why?—Because that last item is, comparatively speaking, far too difficult for an agency to measure.[59] Accordingly, agencies have a powerful incentive to threaten litigation to achieve as many out-of-court settlements as possible simply to receive the last fiscal year’s appropriations, let alone any future increases.\n\nA common government enforcement practice begins with a demand letter sent to an alleged violator, threatening fines and enforcement actions unless the recipient agrees to settle for a lesser sum. Commercial businesses exist to make a profit, and not-for-profit businesses also don’t like to wind up in the red, so the cost of litigation bears heavily on a company’s decision whether to grit its teeth and choose a comply-and-pay response, rather than a defend-and-litigate option, even when the agency action is clearly abusive.[60] The agency, of course, does not pay private counsel for litigation—agency and Justice Department lawyers handle those cases—so the agency does not feel any pinch in its budget by going to court. The result is that only private parties bear the cost of litigation, which enables the federal government to twist a private party’s arm without a lawsuit ever being filed. If the rule that is the basis for the government’s allegation was adopted without complying with the CRA, the federal government can take advantage of a private party’s litigation costs and force businesses to comply with a demand letter that should have no legal force or effect.\n\nThat practice will only increase over the next few years. In 2019, President Donald Trump issued an executive order requiring agencies to make their rules publicly available on their websites.[61] On his first day in office, however, President Joe Biden withdrew that requirement. [62] The result will be a return to a practice inimical to any reasonable understanding of government regulatory enforcement. Agencies will adopt rules that they do not submit to Congress and that remain secret until they are trotted out in an agency demand letter threatening fines for conduct that no one knew was unlawful. How do we know that will occur?—Because the government has aggressively argued, in the Tenth Circuit and everywhere else, that an agency’s willful noncompliance with the CRA is not subject to judicial review. The Biden Administration has clearly signaled that it sees no problem with the practice of “secret” agency rules, and the Justice Department has made clear that it will not let the courts intervene to stop that practice, so there is nothing to stop agencies from giving in to the darker angels of their nature.\n\nJudicial review of an agency’s noncompliance with the CRA is critical to protect private parties against the abusive government practices that will inevitably follow. Unless the courts can intervene, ignorance of the law will not be offered by a private party in defense of unlawful conduct, but it will be used by the government to extract fines from private parties lacking any knowledge that they had done anything wrong.[63] As long as the APA and CRA are on the books, that is not a way the government can lawfully run the railroad—at least not if the courts can intervene. If the courts cannot review the government’s lawbreaking, however, that game plan will play out without end. Hopefully, the Supreme Court will soon end that practice.\n\nConclusion\n\nCongress enacted the CRA to prevent the executive branch from using new rules against private parties unless and until the issuing agency submitted the rule to Congress for its review and possible nullification. The Tenth Circuit’s decision in KNRC gives the executive branch a clear path to nullify the CRA: don’t submit a rule to Congress because nothing good can come of it. If the agency submits the rule to Congress, Congress might pass a resolution of disapproval, or at least embarrass the agency during the floor debates over the rule. By contrast, if the agency sits on the rule, no court can order the agency to comply with the CRA or stop the agency from using it against private parties. That administrative law version of “heads I win, tails you lose” benefits no one except agency officials bent on disregarding the law. Properly read, the CRA does not permit an agency official to ignore the law in that manner. The Supreme Court needs to make that clear."
