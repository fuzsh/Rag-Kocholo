        "text": "Presidential Veto and Congressional Override\n\nIn order to turn a bill into law, Congress and the President must agree. The balance of power is maintained through negotiations, and the usage (or threat) of a veto, as well as the Congressional override. Any bill sent to the President and unsigned after ten days of Congressional session automatically becomes a law.\n\nAn interesting dynamic in federal legislation can occur when disagreement exists between the legislative and executive branches. When the President does not support a bill or resolution, the typical action is to send it back to Congress with an explanation. This direct veto could turn into a \"pocket veto\" if the President does not sign the legislation in the standard 10- day review period and Congress adjourns the legislative session. In this case, the bill does not become a law.\n\nWhile the pocket veto is rarely used, a more common tactic is to threaten a veto. Congress can counter with an override, although doing so required a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress. Achieving a majority consensus of this proportion is challenging in most political climates and on a broad range of issues."
