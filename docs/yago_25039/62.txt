Peter Gilmore (25 August 1931 - 3 February 2013) was an English actor most recognised for his portrayal of "Captain James Onedin" in the BBC television period drama The Onedin Line between 1971 and 1980.

Gilmore appeared in 11 Carry On films.

Early life[]

Gilmore was born in Leipzig, Germany, and was raised in Nunthorpe, North Riding of Yorkshire. At the age of 14, he left school to pursue his passion for acting. In 1952, he briefly attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art preparatory school, Parada, before being expelled.[1]

Career[]

Gilmore's career included roles in 11 Carry On films. He also appeared in various British films such as The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery, Oh! What a Lovely War, The Abominable Dr. Phibes and Warlords of Atlantis in 1978.

In addition to his film work, he performed in stage musicals, including Lock Up Your Daughters and even released a single titled "Follow That Girl" in 1960.

Gilmore received acclaim for his portrayal of Macheath in a 1968 production of The Beggar's Opera in London, where he starred opposite Jan Waters as Polly.

However, it was his role as "James Onedin" in The Onedin Line that brought him widespread recognition. Despite the success of the character, Gilmore felt typecast as the rugged sea captain and yearned for more diverse roles.[2]

He later made an appearance in the Doctor Who serial "Frontios" in 1984, portraying the character Brazen. Additionally, he featured in an episode of Heartbeat called "The Frighteners" during the Nick Berry era. His third wife, actress Anne Stallybrass, was a regular on the series.

He then married Jan Waters from 1970 to 1976 before ultimately marrying actress Anne Stallybrass in 1987, with whom he had a long-lasting relationship until his passing.

Death[]

Gilmore passed away in London on 3 February 2013 at the age of 81. He was survived by his third wife, Anne Stallybrass, and their son Jason, who was adopted during his first marriage.[3]
