        "meta_description": "Dana E. Waters of Lake Linden died peacefully in her home surrounded by her children Tuesday, December 10th, after a noble struggle with cancer and other age related illnesses. She was 77.  Born in Chassell, MI on August 2, 1931, Dana grew up on her parent's Sturgeon River Road farm, graduated from Chassell High School in 1947, attended Nursing school in Chicago and later in life graduated from Oakland University in Rochester, MI. After a very successful career as a Pontiac, MI school teacher, Dana retired in 1991 and moved with her husband Dale to Bootjack, where they enjoyed boating and entertaining the many visitors to their Portage Lake front home.   Besides being a long time member of the Grace United Methodist Church in Houghton and a former member of the board of the Calumet Theatre, Dana enjoyed her dedicated involvement with the Center for International Education at MTU and spent many afternoons hosting groups of up to 30 foreign students at her home. She was the 'Michigan mother' to many of them and highly valued the warm and lasting relationships they maintained. As a participant in the Michigan Youth for Understanding program, Dana and her family was also host to three foreign exchange students throughout the years. As a lover of books, art and foreign cultures, Dana and Dale traveled extensively throughout America and Europe and filled their home with paintings and other artifacts from their adventures, as well as maintaining close friendships with the many people they met along the way.  Dana was preceded in death by her husband of 58 years, Dale James Waters who died March 22nd of this year, her parents, Henry and Olive Uksila of Chassell and sister, Mari Lohla of Palm Beach, Florida. She is survived by her children, daughter, Jan E. Waters and husband Brian of Leicestershire, England and Calumet, MI, son, Robert D. Waters of Chassell, and son, Brian J. Waters and wife Jane of Chassell, granddaughter, Katrina Black and husband Nathan of Bangor, Maine and great grandson, Ben Black, as well as many step-grand children, in-laws, nephews, nieces, cousins and friends.  The Waters family would like to thank the caring doctors and nurses at Marquette General Hospital and Portage Health, especially Dr. Reese and Dr. Kass, along with the dedicated members of Keweenaw Home Nursing and Hospice and the Erickson-Crowley Funeral home.  A memorial service for Dana will be held during the summer of 2009.   The Erickson Crowley Funeral Home in Calumet is assisting the family.
