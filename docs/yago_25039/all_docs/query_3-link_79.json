        "text": "December 2, 1941 – July 16, 2024\n\nDennis Finnigan, Fraser Valley resident for decades, passed away peacefully surrounded by his family on July 16. Dennis was born and raised in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. He graduated from the University of Colorado and married his beloved Fran in 1965. In Littleton, they raised their 3 daughters and pursued a career in finance at Sun Financial. His love of skiing and the mountains kept calling them, and in 1998, they opened The Claddagh Inn Bed and Breakfast, Tabernash. In 2004, they opened a second business, Fraser Valley Photo. Both businesses allowed Dennis (and Fran) to exercise their formidable muscle of friendship. His daughters like to say he never met a stranger. Those years also developed a new treasure; grand-parenting. His three daughters had by this time offered Dennis and Fran seven opportunities to spoil and love their three granddaughters and four grandsons. They say the ability to do something exceptionally well with little effort is called talent. Dennis was a highly talented grandfather. With ultimate retirement, Dennis spent even more time cultivating his many skills: grill master, baker, ski instructor, fixer of whatever was broken, raconteur of family lore. His laugh was only overmatched by the twinkle in his eye. Dennis is survived by his three daughters, Patty, Stephanie and Lisa and their husbands, Gary Droll, Patrick Ward and Ted Connolly. He leaves seven grandchildren: Brendan and Bethanne Droll; Morgan and Molly Ward; Eddie, Jimmie and Finnigan Connolly. His brother Michael of Girdwood, AK also survives him, as well as his sisters-in-law, Sister Laeticia Slusser, and Rita Slusser Simonoff, as well as her children: Mark Tumbarello, Amy and Paul Simonoff, and Amy’s husband Don and her daughter, Amber. He is preceded in death by his cherished wife, Frances Slusser Finnigan, and his parents, John and Naomi Finnigan and brother in law Steven Simonoff. A Catholic funeral mass will be held at Mt. Olivet in Denver on August 16th at 9:00am. Then, on the 17th, the family is planning a Celebration of life at his home 46 Rick Road, County Rd 510, at 1:00. Please bring a chair. Donations can be made to Grand County EMS,\n\nWinter Park Competition Center Athlete support fund at GrandFoundation.com or Namaste Angels Foundation."
