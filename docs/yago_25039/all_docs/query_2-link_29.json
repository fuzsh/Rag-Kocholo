        "text": "About\n\nRichard Pillbrow and Harold Prince’s production of The Beggar’s Opera opened September 1968 at the Apollo Theatre in London. Starring Peter Gilmore, James Cossins and Jan Waters, the production was first performed at the Cambridge and Edinburgh Festivals and later for London Weekend Television. The story of Macheath and his band of beggars and thieves (and the basis for Kurt Weill’s more frequently performed The Three Penny Opera), John Gay’s classic eighteenth century ballad opera still delights audiences centuries later."
