        "text": "John Peter Gilmore (25 August 1931 – 3 February 2013), known as Peter Gilmore, was a British actor, best known for his portrayal of Captain James Onedin in 91 episodes of the BBC television period drama The Onedin Line (1971–80).\n\nBorn in Leipzig, Germany, and brought up in Nunthorpe, North Riding of Yorkshire, Gilmore left school at the age of 14. He had roles in eleven Carry on films. During his early career, he appeared in several stage musicals, including Lock Up Your Daughters, and released a single in 1960. After his fame in the role of James Onedin, Gilmore felt he had become typecast as the rugged sea captain.\n\nHe played the heroic lead in the adventure film Warlords of Atlantis (1978), and appeared in a Doctor Who serial Frontios (1984) in which he played a character called Brazen. Gilmore also appeared in a Heartbeat episode, called \"The Frighteners\", during the Nick Berry era.\n\nHe married three times: to actress Una Stubbs (1958–1969), to Jan Waters (1970–1976); and to actress, and former Onedin Line colleague, Anne Stallybrass (1987–2013), who survived him.\n\nGilmore quit school at the age of 14 and started pursuing his dream of becoming an actor. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for a short time before being expelled. When he joined the army he discovered that he had a talent for singing and after his discharge in the army he joined a singing group called the George Mitchell singers who appeared in a couple of stage plays.\n\nPeter Gilmore died in London on 3 February 2013, aged 81. He was survived by his third wife (Stallybrass), and a son, Jason, by his first marriage."
