We all became very close friends over the years and had a lot of fun. We sorely miss him.\"\n\nGilmore's agent Primie Carey said: \"On behalf of his wife Anne and Peter's family I would like to thank those who have sent their kind thoughts and condolences.\"\n\n[Peter Gilmore with Anne Stallybrass in 1996]\n\nHaving starred in the TV series Ivanhoe in the late 1950s and several stage plays in the West End, he was cast as shipping boss James Onedin in the BBC drama The Onedin Line.\n\nThe programme was set in the 19th century, and was one of the country's top dramas of the 1970s. It ran for 91 episodes from 1971.\n\nGilmore also starred in several Carry On movies, and the cult movie Warlords of Atlantis.\n\nHe appeared in the Doctor Who serial Frontios in 1984, and had roles in several TV shows including Casualty and Heartbeat.\n\nHe was first married to Sherlock actress Una Stubbs, and later actress Jan Waters.\n\nPeter Gilmore is survived by his third wife, actress Anne Stallybrass, and his son Jason from his first marriage."
