        "text": "Peter Gilmore, star of TV drama The Onedin Line, has died at a hospice in London after a long illness. He was 81.\n\nFor 10 years from 1971, Gilmore starred in 91 episodes of the BBC series, which followed the lives of shipping magnate James Onedin and his family.\n\nBorn in Germany in 1931, Gilmore came to the UK at the age of six and was raised in Yorkshire\n\nHis Onedin Line co-star, actress Jessica Benton, called him \"a gentle man and a gentleman\".\n\nShe said: \"The Onedin Line was a very happy, long-running series to be involved in and that was all credit to Peter because he made it so. We all became very close friends over the years and had a lot of fun.\n\n\"We sorely miss him.\""
