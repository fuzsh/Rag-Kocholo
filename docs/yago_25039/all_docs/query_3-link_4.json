        "text": "By Jim Shannon - bio | email\n\nBATON ROUGE, LA (WAFB) - A trial scheduled for Monday had all the makings of a made-for-TV movie, as the ex-wife of a wealthy man was accused of killing him in cold blood in their million dollar home in the Shenandoah area, but she shocked the courtroom when she pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\n\nJan Waters' walk into court was her last as a free woman for years to come. She confessed to shooting her ex-husband, Alan Waters, in the chest on May 21, 2004. As the facts of the case were read aloud in court, Waters collapsed on one of her attorneys.\n\n\"This has been a tragic story from the beginning,\" said Marci Blaize, attorney for Jan Waters. \"It started six years ago with the death of Alan Waters, two children robbed of their father and more. Based on today's plea, they will spend the next few years without their mother.\"\n\nThe victim's ex-wife had been a suspect in the slaying since the beginning. Throughout the investigation, she claimed to have been staying in a Kenner hotel with her two kids the night her husband was killed.\n\nThe case against her was largely circumstantial, since there was little physical evidence. Even so, prosecutors felt their case was solid and actually looked forward to trying the case.\n\n\"But for the hard work of these people, this would have been a murder that would have gone unfounded and would not have been prosecuted,\" said District Attorney Hillar Moore.\n\nJeanne Water, the victim's sister, is unable to speak, but her words echoed loud and clear, as the district attorney read her remarks following the plea.\n\n\"My brother was the best father, best brother,\" Moore read. \"He's still with me every day.\"\n\nLong-time family friend Doris Butt was prepared to testify in the trial. After the plea, she was glad it was resolved.\n\n\"I really felt sorry for the family,\" she said. \"More for her family than her, because what she did was wrong.\"\n\nWaters will be sentenced Thursday, Dec. 16. She faces up to 40 years in jail and must serve at least 20 years, which means she will be 63 when she is eligible for parole.\n\nTestimony in depositions show the conflict between the two was over money. Jan Waters wanted the children's money to continue while she was in prison.\n\nTheir old house in the 20 White Oak Landing Subdivision is valued at $1,372,000. The new owner has put up steel gates, which keep out the curious.\n\nIt is also surrounded by heavily-wooded brambles, a seven-foot chain linked fence and a warning about surveillance cameras.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nJan Waters pleads guilty to manslaughter in ex-husband's death\n\nWoman accused of killing ex-husband set to go to trial\n\nJudge rules against Waters to throw out evidence\n\nJudge throws out a taped police statement in Waters pre-trial hearing\n\nCopyright 2010 WAFB.
