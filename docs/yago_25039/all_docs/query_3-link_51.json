        "text": "\"This was my first visit to the Stone Oak Ophthalmology Center where I met with Dr. Waters. Dr. Waters and her staff were very efficient, investigated the issues I came in with, and I found I won't need surgery for my cataracts for (hopefully) many years in the future. It's rare to find a doctor who looks at you and listens to you when you are explaining what is wrong. Excellent job Dr. Waters!\"\n\n\"Everyone was so very professional! I drove 2 1/2 hours to see Dr. Waters and it was truly worth it! Will continue to make the trip for continue such excellent eye care!\"\n\n\"Iâ€™m always impressed by the expertise and kindness of the doctors and staff. Stone Oak Ophthalmology has taken care of my vision for 25 years. I started with Dr Held, now see Dr Young, and have been impressed by my recent visit with Dr Waters: 3 strong, brilliant and compassionate women.\""
