Back in early 2019 I think , he went to his ex girlfriends house and killed her and her mother and her new boyfriend in a fit of jealousy. Two teenagers were able to escape and call police. I knew this dude very well. He was a hotshot driver for me and was even in my house drinking a beer… he threw three lives away and his own in what the BRPD called a crime of RAGE…. He said he was to drunk to talk to police that night…. All over a piece of arse… shame……. He needs to go straight to the table and be executed……. Yet to this day there has yet to be any kind of hearing or anything involving this.\n\nPosted by theantiquetiger\n\nPaid Premium Member Plus\n\nMember since Feb 2005\n\n19601 posts\n\nto JodyPlauche\n\nquote:\n\nYes you do...you even started a Thread about me one time and you know I am good friends with your sister...who I love to death!\n\nShe actually served as my \"Wing man\" one time and got me laid :)\n\nShe did the same for me.

I hope every sex offender and child molester fears that airport and thinks about it every time they travel.\n\nThe man should be heralded as a hero.

The details are fricking crazy how she planned it out and took kids to the Kenner hotel and hurried back in middle of the night to murder him. She had a nice lil alibi lined up and all but security cameras got her diabolical arse.\n\nWAFB Article about the case\n\nquote:\n\nIn November 2012, the crew from Nightmare Next Door visited the WAFB studio to interview reporter Jim Shannon about the case. Shannon began reporting the details about the case in June of 2004 when Jan Waters, Alan Waters' ex-wife, was charged with his murder.\n\nIn October of 2010, in a surprise move from the main suspect, Jan Waters confessed to shooting her ex-husband, Alan Waters, in the chest on May 22, 2004. Jan and Alan had two children together.\n\nJan was sentenced to 20 years in prison\n\nThis post was edited on 8/24/21 at 11:34 am\n\nPosted by The Korean\n\nDenham Springs, LA\n\nMember since May 2008\n\n1620 posts\n\nto dukke v\n\nSon of a bitch, knew him in the early 2000's. Was a decent guy back then from what I can remember, but can't say I am totally surprised. He had a kid with a women who worked overnight at a hotel he had a pest control contract with, so he was spraying for more than bugs.\n\nI somewhat remember when the killings happened, but guess I never connected the name until now.\n\nPosted by TigersSEC2010\n\nWarren, Michigan\n\nMember since Jan 2010\n\n37442 posts\n\nto HeadSlash\n\nquote:\n\nNick Tullier*\n\nMight include him as well, he is just existing.
