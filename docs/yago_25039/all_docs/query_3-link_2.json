        "text": "By Jim Shannon - bio | email\n\nBATON ROUGE, LA (WAFB) - A Baton Rouge woman, who for years denied involvement in her ex-husband's death and then pleaded guilty to manslaughter in October, learned her fate Thursday morning.\n\nJan Waters was sentenced to 200 months, roughly 16 and a half years, at St. Gabriel's women's prison. She'll have to serve 85 percent of the sentence and received credit for 21 months she's already served.\n\nHer husband, Alan Waters was shot to death on May 24, 2004. She would become a suspect early on in the investigation.\n\nAt the time, the community was stunned.\n\n\"You would never, never, guessed anything like that would ever happen to either one of them, much less what they're suspecting,\" said Bill Smith at the time of the murder.\n\nSix and half years later, Jan Waters was given 20 years in prison.\n\n\"She was prepared for today,\" said defense attorney Marci Blaize. \"We knew that there was going to be a possibility that she could do a lot more than the 20 years that was handed down. It's going to be a long road ahead, but at least she can start putting it behind her and the kids as well.\"\n\nIt's been a difficult time for the kids, illustrated in court Thursday by Waters' daughter Susan, now 18. She read letters written by her and her brother. Waters was sobbing as she listened. \"I forgiver her,\" Susan said. \"Please show her mercy.\"\n\n\"I think for an 18-year-old she withstood a lot of scrutiny of people that wondered why she would be forgiving of her mother,\" added Blaize. \"It is her mother she loves her very much so does Thomas and I say for an 18-year-old, she did a fabulous job.\"\n\nThe Waters case has been a high-profile thorn in the side of the District Attorney's Office for years. The evidence is largely circumstantial and a conviction was not automatic. Things got much easier once Waters confessed.\n\n\"For the first time with her in my short history I saw some emotion with the children there,\" said District Attorney Hillar Moore. \"I had never seen this before, I didn't see it at the plea. I think it finally hit that 'this is what I caused.'\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nJan Waters pleads guilty to manslaughter in ex-husband's death\n\nWoman accused of killing ex-husband set to go to trial\n\nJudge rules against Waters to throw out evidence\n\nJudge throws out a taped police statement in Waters pre-trial hearing\n\nCopyright 2010 WAFB.
