        "text": "English actor (1931–2013)\n\nFor other people named Peter Gilmore, see Peter Gilmore (disambiguation).\n\nJohn Peter Gilmore (25 August 1931 – 3 February 2013), known as Peter Gilmore, was an English actor, known for his portrayal of Captain James Onedin in 91 episodes of the BBC television period drama The Onedin Line (1971–1980), created by Cyril Abraham.[1]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in Leipzig, Germany, and brought up in Nunthorpe, North Riding of Yorkshire, Gilmore left school at the age of 14 and started pursuing his dream of becoming an actor. In 1952, he attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art preparatory school Parada for a short time before being expelled.[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nGilmore had roles in 11 Carry On films, and appeared in many British films including The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery (1966), Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971) and Warlords of Atlantis (1978). During his early career, he appeared in several stage musicals, including Lock Up Your Daughters and released a single, \"Follow That Girl\" (HMV POP 740), in 1960. He played Macheath opposite Jan Waters as Polly in a 1968 production of the Beggar's Opera in London, in which both were praised for their portrayals.[3] After achieving notice in the role of James Onedin, Gilmore felt he had become typecast as the rugged sea captain.[4]\n\nHe later appeared in a Doctor Who serial Frontios (1984) in which he played a character called Brazen. Gilmore also appeared in a Heartbeat episode, called \"The Frighteners\", during the Nick Berry era; his third wife, actress Anne Stallybrass was a regular in the series.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHe married three times: to actress Una Stubbs (1958–1969), with whom he adopted a child; to Jan Waters (1970–1976); and to actress, and former Onedin Line colleague, Anne Stallybrass (1987–2013), who survived him.\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nPeter Gilmore died in London on 3 February 2013, aged 81. He was survived by his third wife (Stallybrass), and a son, Jason, adopted during his first marriage.[5]\n\nSelected filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
