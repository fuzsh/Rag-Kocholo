It is broadly recognized that the gut and brain are in constant bidirectional communication, of which gut microbiota and its metabolic production are a major component, and form the so-called gut microbiome–brain axis. Disturbances of microbiota homeostasis caused by imbalance in their functional composition and metabolic activities, known as dysbiosis, cause dysregulation of these pathways and trigger changes in the blood–brain barrier permeability, thereby causing pathological malfunctions, including neurological and functional gastrointestinal disorders. In turn, the brain can affect the structure and function of gut microbiota through the autonomic nervous system by regulating gut motility, intestinal transit and secretion, and gut permeability. Here, we examine data from the CAS Content Collection, the largest collection of published scientific information, and analyze the publication landscape of recent research. We review the advances in knowledge related to the human gut microbiome, its complexity and functionality, its communication with the central nervous system, and the effect of the gut microbiome–brain axis on mental and gut health. We discuss correlations between gut microbiota composition and various diseases, specifically gastrointestinal and mental disorders. We also explore gut microbiota metabolites with regard to their impact on the brain and gut function and associated diseases. Finally, we assess clinical applications of gut-microbiota-related substances and metabolites with their development pipelines. We hope this review can serve as a useful resource in understanding the current knowledge on this emerging field in an effort to further solving of the remaining challenges and fulfilling its potential.\n\nKeywords: gut, intestine, microorganism, bacteria, microbiota, brain, DGBI, metabolite, mental, dysbiosis\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Earth microbiome represents the majority of the planet’s biodiversity. Microbial life was the first to inhabit Earth.1 Microbes regulate global nutrient cycles, greenhouse gas exchange, as well as disease transmission and protection, thus providing essential life support to the planet.2 Among many other harbors, including plants, animals, soil, and entire ecosystems, a wide diversity of microorganisms colonize the human body, which are now known to play an essential role in the human host by regulating key physiological functions.\n\nThe large collection of microorganisms inhabiting the human body are predominantly bacteria, but also viruses, protozoa, fungi, and archaea. They are collectively known as the human microbiota. Those microorganisms residing in the digestive tracts are known as gut flora or gut microbiota. As a matter of fact, there are more bacterial cells in the human body than human cells—roughly 40 trillion bacterial cells versus only 30 trillion human cells. Together, they function as an extra organ in the human body—a so-called “forgotten organ”—since these microbes have a collective metabolic activity equal to a virtual organ.3 The collective genome of the gut microbes, the gut microbiome, exceeds over 100 times the amount of human genome in the body.4 Considering such enormous genetic potential of the microbiota, it is anticipated that it plays a role in virtually all physiological processes in the human body, including metabolic functions and immune homeostasis.5−11\n\nDespite being considered a relatively new field of research, the first reports of human-associated microbiota date back to the 17th century when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek described five different kinds of oral bacteria.12 In the following decades, the foundations of microbiology were laid, and knowledge of the host–microorganism interactions has accumulated ( ).13−22 Despite these early findings, rapid development of the field only started when methods to culture anaerobic organisms were set up in the mid-20th century when representatives of the microbiota were grown and studied in the laboratory.23\n\nIn the 2010s, the gut microbiome field burst into the life sciences research and industry, which prompted Forbes to declare the 2010s “The Decade of the Microbiome.”24 This growth in the field was largely related to the National Institutes of Health’s “The Human Microbiome Project”25 and the MetaHIT project funded by the European Union.26 In 2005, the International Human Microbiome Consortium (IHMC) was founded in a cooperative effort to study the microbiome in human health and disease with the ultimate goal of applying this knowledge to prevent and/or treat diseases, and the abovementioned megaprojects have contributed to fulfilling this goal. They provided significant evidence for the relationship between metabolic, neurological, and autoimmune disorders; allergies, infections, and cancers; and the microorganisms that live on and in humans. Specifically, gastrointestinal diseases/disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases that include both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD), constipation, celiac disease, and more, are attracting attention with their close relation to the gut microbiome. Because of these findings and the essential part the gut microbiome plays in drug metabolism, the microbiome has become a popular target in the biotechnology industry. In 2010, the first extensive catalogue of human intestinal microbial genes was published on the basis of the studies of 124 individuals.27 In 2011, the Human Microbiome Project published the sequences of 178 bacterial species.28\n\nAlthough DNA sequencing has been used for decades, it was only after the development of next-generation sequencing when metagenomic studies became affordable.29 The term metagenomics is used to describe genetic studies of microbial assemblies from environmental samples using sequence-based bioinformatics tools.30 The goal of these studies is to identify the taxonomic diversity of the microbiota and to differentiate the biological roles of the representatives of such samples by performing functional metagenomics.\n\nThe human microbiota plays an essential role in human physiology and pathology. It collaborates closely with the digestive tract in several important aspects: (a) it promotes digestion by assisting the absorption of nutrients by gut cells or the fermentation of some food fractions, which generate important metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids;31 (b) it supports the maturation of the digestive tract by participating in the assembly of gastrointestinal mucus and promoting the enzymatic activity of the mucosa;32 (c) it performs a barrier function against pathogens and toxins, where some bacteria release antimicrobial agents that protect from the pathogenic bacteria;33 (d) it plays a protective role in promoting the immune system development; and (e) it supports in the synthesis of essential vitamins like vitamin B: Magnúsdóttir et al. estimated that 86% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin B6, 37% of the RDA of vitamin B9, 31% of the RDA of vitamin B12, and 27% of the RDA of vitamin B3 could be provided by the human gut microbiota.34\n\nGut microbial disruption (dysbiosis) causes not only gastrointestinal disorders but also disorders in other distal organs and systems. Not long ago, it was found that gut bacteria can affect the central nervous system (CNS) functions.35−38 Indeed, the gut and brain are in constant bidirectional communication, of which the microbiota and its metabolic production are a major component. The gut and brain connect via a neuro-immuno-humoral network of signaling pathways known as the gut microbiome–brain axis, which includes the vagus nerve, the immune system, the hormonal system, and bacterial metabolites and products.39 The digestive system, including the inhabiting microbiota, was even called “the second brain”40 at the time when scientists were beginning to realize that the gut and the brain in humans were involved in constant crosstalk and significantly modulate each other’s function. During disturbance of the microbiota homeostasis caused by an imbalance in their functional composition and metabolic activities, known as dysbiosis, these routes are dysregulated and cause changes in the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), neuroinflammation, and other pathological malfunctions, including a range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.41 Disorders of the gut–brain interaction (DGBI) is the recent term proposed by Rome Foundation guidelines for a range of functional gastrointestinal disorders including but not limited to IBS, FD, and functional constipation. This highlights the central role of the miscommunication between the gut and brain in these digestive disorders.42 The gut microorganisms transform and metabolize dietary- and host-derived substances to generate a diverse set of metabolites with important local and systemic outcomes, thereby building a network of immunological, neuronal, and endocrine signaling pathways.\n\nIt is generally believed that bacterial colonization begins during birth.43 The neonatal microbiota differs depending on mode of delivery: in vaginally delivered infants, it resembles the maternal vaginal microbiota, while the microbiota in those delivered by cesarean section resembles the maternal skin microbiota.44 Premature birth, feeding method, and perinatal administration of antibiotics are also among the conditions affecting the development of the neonatal microbiome.45 Recently, a new mode of horizontal mother-to-infant microbiome transmission has been revealed where microbes in the maternal gut shared genes with microbes in the infant gut during the perinatal period, which starts shortly before birth and prolongs throughout the first few weeks after birth.46 A major factor of gut microbiota composition during adulthood is diet. Prompt changes in microbiota composition take place in response to dietary style changes. Specific patterns have been reported in plant-based versus animal-based diets.47,48 The development and modifications of the gut microbiota are influenced by multiple other factors, such as exposure to stress, environmental conditions, medications intake, lifecycle, medical disorders, and procedures.\n\nThe human gut microbiota is divided into many groups called phyla. The gut microbiota primarily comprises four main phyla, including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, with the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes representing 90% of gut microbiota.81,82 The majority of bacteria reside within the gastrointestinal tract, with most predominantly anaerobic bacteria housed in the large intestine.83\n\nIn recent years, sizable technological progress and wealth of knowledge have promoted the advancement of microbiome research, thereby enhancing our understanding of its relationship to human physiology and pathologies. In this paper, we review the advances in the knowledge related to the human gut microbiome, its complexity and functionality, its communication with the central nervous system, and the effect of the gut microbiome–brain axis on mental and digestive health. We examine data from the CAS Content Collection,15 the largest human-curated collection of published scientific information and analyze the publication landscape of recent research in order to provide insights into the scientific advances in the area. We also discuss the correlations between the gut microbiota composition and various diseases, specifically digestive system diseases, mental, and neurodegenerative disorders. We furthermore explore the gut microbiota metabolites with regard to their impact on brain, digestive functions, and their associated diseases. Subsequently, we assess the clinical applications of gut microbiota-related substances and metabolites, their development pipelines, disease categories, development stages, and publication trends. We hope this review can serve as a useful resource in understanding the current state of knowledge in the field of gut microbes and the gut microbiome–brain interactions in an effort to further solve the remaining challenges for fulfilling the potential of the field.\n\nLandscape of Gut Microbiome Research—Insights from the CAS Content Collection\n\nThe CAS Content Collection84 is the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. It is a comprehensive resource to access and remain well-informed on the world’s available scientific literature across disciplines, including chemistry, biomedical sciences, engineering, materials science, agricultural science, and many more, thus allowing quantitative analysis of global scientific publications against variables, such as time, research area, application, disease association, and chemical composition. A search in the CAS Content Collection showed an intense increase of the documents related to microbiome research in the past decade, which overcame other “omics” exploration—for example, the number of proteomics-related documents held up after the initial burst in the early 2000s and were surpassed by the microbiome documents after 2016 ( , inset). Currently, there are over 250 000 scientific publications (mainly journal articles and patents) in the CAS Content Collection related to gut/intestinal microbiome/microbiota. Nearly 15 000 of them are related to various aspects of mental and gut health. There is a steady, exponential growth of the number of journal articles over time that has been rather explosive from 2021–2022 ( ). The number of patents rapidly grew until 2004, which possibly correlated with the initial accumulation of knowledge and its transfer into patentable applications. Later on, the growth substantially slowed down, perhaps awaiting the forthcoming breakthroughs in the gut microbiome awareness ( ).\n\nThe United States, China, Japan, and Korea are the leaders in the number of published journal articles ( A) and patents ( B) related to gut microbiome research in the areas of mental and gut health.\n\npresents the flow of patent filings from different applicant locations to various patent offices. Because patent protection is territorial, and the same invention may be filed for protection in multiple jurisdictions, we looked at all relevant filings on gut microbiome research in mental and gut health. One patent family may have been counted multiple times when it was applied in multiple patent offices. There are diverse patent filing strategies: some patent assignees, such as those from China and Korea, file foremost in their home country patent offices (CN, KR), with a smaller proportion filing through other patent offices or other jurisdictions. Others, for instance United States-based applicants, have a nearly equal number of US and WO filings and a considerable number of filings at other patent offices, such as the European Patent Office (EP) and Canada (CA).\n\nIn order to better understand the advance in this research area, we examined the occurrence and trends of certain key concepts in the scientific publications relevant to the gut microbiome research in mental and gut health ( ). With respect to the cumulative number of publications, “immunity” and “gut microbiome” appear as top concepts in the area ( A), thereby reflecting the rising interest in the relationship between the gut microbiome and systemic immune response pathways and the critical role the gut microbiome plays in training and development of the host’s innate and adaptive immune system. It is noteworthy that the concept concerning the gut–brain relationship exhibits the greatest growth rate in the past two years ( B), thereby characterizing it as the trendiest concept in the field.\n\nGut-Microbiota-Participant Bacteria\n\nThe human gut microbiome, as mentioned above, is a complex mixture of microorganisms, including viruses, archaea, bacteria, yeasts, and fungi, interacting with each other and with their host in complex ways. These interactions at various times involve symbiosis, mutualism, antagonism, and even predation. Not only does the gut microbiome interact directly with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but it also interacts with the immune system that is present in the GI tract and with the neurological system through various signaling systems. Gastrointestinal signaling is mediated in part by microbial metabolites and is involved in regulating the gut–brain axis in the host.85 This section focuses on the bacterial microbiome by first discussing the techniques used to identify and study the gut microbiome. Then, we will discuss the human GI tract from an ecological viewpoint. The phyla commonly found in the gut microbiome will be defined and discussed. Finally, we will focus on probiotics and related compositions (prebiotics, postbiotics, synbiotics, and psychobiotics) and present recent examples of each class to illustrate the current state of the art.\n\nTechniques Used to Study the Gut Microbiome\n\nUntil recently, about 400 bacterial species were identified in the human microbiome using conventional culturing techniques.86 These techniques, by their nature, underestimate the actual number of species because, to culture a bacterium successfully, one needs to provide the correct nutrients, pH, and redox environment to enable growth. Conventional culture techniques favor fast-growing and nonfastidious species over those present in low concentration, which requires unusual culture conditions and/or complex nutritional requirements.86 Most isolation methods use selective agents, such as bile salts, to enrich the numbers of a desired bacterial type over others in the sample. The choice of the proper selective agent then becomes important. Some gut bacteria depend on other microorganisms in the gut to provide the nutrients they require for growth “cross-feeding.” Devising culture media for these can be a hit-or-miss proposition. Some bacteria will only grow in niches that have a narrow range of pH and/or redox potential, which may be difficult to maintain in vitro. Although there have been methodological advances in anaerobic culturing techniques, they tend to be tedious, time-consuming, and require specialized equipment.31 The successful culture of strict anaerobic bacteria requires training, experience, and careful planning. Additionally, some bacteria might be alive but unculturable. Intercellular adherence may reduce the number of organisms that can give rise to colonies.87\n\nThe development of culture-independent metagenomic approaches, such as 16S RNA gene sequencing and high-throughput sequencing, have been an enabling factor in the study of the human gut microbiome. This topic was reviewed in depth by Sankar et al. in 2015.86 The 16S rRNA gene exhibits several advantages, including its distribution in all bacterial species, its absence in eukaryotes, its stability over time, and its size (∼1500 bp), that make it suitable for bioinformatic analyses. High-throughput sequencing methods have given unprecedented access to the analysis of the microbial diversity of complex microbiotas, particularly through metagenomic approaches. Two strategies used are high-throughput sequencing of pooled PCR-amplified 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing of all DNA fragments present, which enables identification of the microorganisms present and their metabolic genes. With these molecular techniques, it is now estimated that the human GI microbiota comprises more than 2000 species using modern molecular methods.86,88\n\nRecent impressive advances in next generation sequencing technologies, along with the progress and innovations of metagenomics, metabolomics, multiomics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence tools, have provided prospects to better characterize the microbial populations and their functions and help in better correlation prediction.\n\nGastrointestinal Tract\n\nThe gut microbiome varies according to the GI anatomy, which varies in terms of physiology, pH and O2 tension, flow rates (rapid from the mouth to the cecum, slower afterward), substrate availability, and host secretions.89 presents a representation of the GI tract with some of the bacterial taxa present. The GI tract consists of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ilium, cecum, and colon, with each environment ascending in pH and growing progressively more anaerobic from stomach to colon. Each section of the GI tract presents a unique ecological niche that exerts selective pressure on the microbiome. It is an open system with nutrients entering the system intermittently and wastes also leaving intermittently. The microbiome is affected by many factors, including diet, medications (especially antibiotics), ethnicity, age, and general health.82,83\n\nThe stomach is an extreme habitat because it is highly acidic (pH = ∼1.5). Once, it was considered sterile because of its acidity until the discovery of Helicobacter pylori in this hostile environment in 1982. The microbial population in the gastric environment is low and in the range of 101–103 cells/mL.87 Investigations since this discovery have revealed that the gastric fluid is predominated by the members of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria.87 The gastric mucosa was found to have a rich diversity with bacterial members belonging to Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria. In healthy human stomach, the genera Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Rothia, and Haemophilus were found to be predominant; however, the composition of the gastric microbiota is dynamic and affected by such factors as diet, drugs, and diseases.90\n\nThe small intestine comprises the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum has a pH of 5–6.8. Bacterial numbers are 103–104 cells/mL where Firmicutes predominate.91 The jejunum and ileum have a higher pH (6–8) with a 104–108 cell/mL density that comprises strict to facultative anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The small intestine is lined with simple columnar epithelial tissue, which is covered by a mucus layer, and has a large surface area because of the villi and microvilli. When food enters the duodenum, the pH and bacterial load are low. These small intestinal mucosae are associated with members of phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Food is blended with bile, bicarbonate, and digestive enzymes in the duodenum, and when the intestinal contents reach the large intestine, the food blend has been converted to a neutral to alkaline pH. The small intestine provides a more challenging environment for microbial colonizers given the short transit times (3–5 h) and the high bile concentrations.83,91\n\nThe large intestine consists of the cecum and colon and is characterized by slow flow rates and pH varying from 6 to 7.8. It harbors by far the largest microbial community. The large intestine is strictly anaerobic, and the cell density reaches 1012 cells/mL. The large intestine is home to the most complex bacterial diversity in the GI tract because of several factors, such as its larger volume, moderate or less acidic pH, low concentration of bile salts, and the longer retention time caused by slower peristalsis. Five major phyla—Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria—covering a wide range of bacterial genera—Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroidetes, Actinomyces, and Propionibacterium—are associated with the large intestine. Other Gram-positive cocci—Micrococci, Peptococci, Peptostreptococci, and Ruminococci—have been also reported to play crucial roles in the large intestine. Food that has not been degraded in the upper GI tract reaches the large intestines and supports the microbiota with nutrients and energy. The carbohydrates present are fermented to carbon dioxide, hydrogen, methane, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) (primarily acetate, propionate, and butyrate). Most of the SCFA produced in the large intestine are absorbed by the host and provide an energy source. The amount of energy derived from SCFA accounts for 6–9% of the total energy requirement.82,88,91,92\n\nThe microbiome composition of the intestinal lumen, known as mucosal and epithelial spaces of the GI tract, is highly diverse and comprises Verrucomicrobia, Fusobacteria, Asteroplasma, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Lentisphaera, Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Bacilli, Clostridia, and Mollicutes. The predominating genera are Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Clostridium, Coprococcus, Weisella, and Lactobacillus. Other genera found include Granulicatella, Streptococcus, and Veillonella.83,91\n\nTypes of Bacteria Found in the GI Tract\n\nThe four dominant phyla residents in the human gut are Firmicutes (which contains lactobacilli), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria (which contains Bifidobacteria), and Proteobacteria. Other phyla found in lower numbers are the Fusobacteria and Verrucobacteria. presents the significant phyla, families, and genera of gut bacteria in terms of the number of records that cite them in the CAS Content Collection. This presentation reflects the relative level of research interest in each of these taxonomic groups. Most bacteria belong to the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Bifidobacterium. Other genera, such as Escherichia and Lactobacillus, are present to a much lesser extent. Twenty-three species from the genus Bacteroides, alone, constitute about 30% of all bacteria in the human gut.93\n\nBacteroidetes\n\nBacteroidetes are Gram-negative, nonspore-forming, anaerobic or aerobic, rod-shaped bacteria. Bacteroides fragilis, found in the human microbiome, is the type of species for this phylum. The majority of the Bacteroidetes species fall into three genera: Prevotella (bile-sensitive, moderately saccharolytic, with pigmented and nonpigmented species), Porphyromonas (bile-sensitive, pigmented, asaccharolytic species), and Bacteroides (bile-resistant, nonpigmented, saccharolytic species). Other genera in the phyla are Alistipes, Anaerorhabdus, Dichelobacter, Fibrobacter, Megamonas, Mitsuokella, Rikenella, Sebaldella, Tannerella, and Tissierella.94 Some members of the Bacteroides genus, although belonging to the normal gastrointestinal microbiota, can cause opportunistic infections if the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier is broken. These infections are usually polymicrobial, but B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron are the most frequent species isolated. Some members of the genera Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Tannerella are well-known pathogens of the oral cavity, where they can notably cause periodontal disease and dental caries.95 The ability of some members of the Bacteroidetes to degrade polysaccharides explains why they thrive in the GI tract.96\n\nFirmicutes\n\nThe Firmicutes phylum comprises Gram-positive bacteria with low G + C DNA content and is composed of more than 200 different genera, such as Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, and Ruminicoccus.82 They can be found in a variety of places, including soil, water, skin, and the GI tract. The phylum includes aerobes, anaerobes, spore-forming, saprophytic, and pathogenic bacteria. Notable among the latter are Clostridium difficile and Listeria monocytogenes. Firmicutes, such as Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium tetani, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, can produce proteinaceous toxins. Other important genera are Listeria, Paenibacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pediococcus, and Leuconostoc.97 Some members of Firmicutes are involved in bile acid metabolism in the gut. Accumulating evidence suggests that bile acids play pivotal roles in gut inflammation and the development of intestinal bowel disease (IBD). Patients with IBD exhibit decreased microbial diversity and abnormal microbial composition marked by the depletion of phylum Firmicutes.98\n\nActinobacteria\n\nThe Actinobacteria are Gram-positive bacteria with high G + C DNA content and constitute one of the largest bacterial phyla. They are ubiquitously distributed in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Many Actinobacteria have a mycelial lifestyle and undergo complex morphological differentiation. They also have an extensive secondary metabolism and produce about two-thirds of all naturally derived antibiotics in current clinical use, as well as many anticancer, anthelmintic, and antifungal compounds. The phylum includes pathogens (species of Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, and Propionibacterium), soil inhabitants (Micromonospora and Streptomyces species), plant commensals (Frankia spp.), and GI commensals (Bifidobacterium spp.)99 The Bifidobacteria are among the first microbial colonizers of the intestines of newborns and play key roles in the development of their physiology, including maturation of the immune system and use of dietary components. Some Bifidobacterium strains are considered probiotic microorganisms because of their beneficial effects, and they have been included as bioactive ingredients in functional foods, mainly dairy products, as well as in food supplements and pharma products, alone or together with other microbes or microbial substrates.100\n\nProteobacteria\n\nThe name Proteobacteria was first proposed by Stackebrandt et al. in 1988.101 The name was derived from Proteus the ancient Greek god of the sea capable of assuming different shapes, which reflected the high heterogeneity displayed by the bacteria belonging to this phylum. A common trait of Proteobacteria is Gram-negative staining, which indicates the presence of lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, the Proteobacteria phylum is divided into six classes (previously regarded as subclasses of the phylum): Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, and Zetaproteobacteria. Considering that the classes division is based on molecular relatedness, it is not surprising that no specific morphological or physiological trait characterizes members within each class.102 Notable genera in the Proteobacteria are Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, Desulfovibrio, and Helicobacter. Included in the phyla is the Enterobacteriaceae family, which contains several enteropathogenic bacteria, including Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, and Escherichia coli. Other enteric pathogens in this phylum are Vibrio cholerae and Helicobacter pylori.\n\nVerrucomicrobia\n\nThe phylum Verrucomicrobia, like the Proteobacteria, is defined by as a distinct phylogenetic lineage, as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequences. The phylum has been recognized as separate since 1995 but currently counts only a few cultivated microorganisms as members. Verrucomicrobia is a divergent phylum that includes members of the microbial communities of soil and fresh and marine waters. Some extremely acidophilic members from hot springs have been found to oxidize methane.103,104Akkermansia muciniphila is a mucus-degrading member of the Verrucomicrobia found in the human GI tract. A. muciniphila represents from 1 to 4% of the bacterial population in the colon.105A. muciniphila prefers to colonize in the intestinal mucus layer and specifically degrades mucins to produce short-chain fatty acids, thereby providing energy for the host and promoting colonization of the bacterium itself. The degradation of mucins prompts the host to compensate with the production of more mucins, thereby maintaining the dynamics of these proteins.106\n\nFusobacteria\n\nThe phylum Fusobacteria is made up of Gram-negative, nonmotile, facultative aerobic to obligately anaerobic, fermentative, rod-shaped bacteria, which have generally fusiform (spindle-shaped) morphology. Fusobacteria have been known for more than 100 years, but recently, phylogenetic studies have shown that they should be grouped into a distinct phylum. The bacteria from this phylum are commonly associated with the mucous membrane of humans and animals. They are also commonly present in the human and animal GI tract, particularly in the jejunum, the ileum, and the colon.83,107\n\nGut Microbiome–Disease Correlations\n\nThe human microbiome has been recognized as an essential factor for human health.108−110 Specifically, gut microbes contribute directly and/or indirectly to important physiological activities, including immunomodulation and the regulation of various neurotransmitters, hormones, and metabolites. Dysbiosis is a state characterized by distinct alterations in the microbiome that result in an imbalance in the microbiota, modifications in their functional composition and metabolic performance, or a change in their allocation. The impact of the microbiome on human physiology and pathology is so extensive that the microbiome has been considered as an essential organ of the human body.111−113 A search in the CAS Content Collection identified a large collection of studies reporting correlations between gut microbiota and a wide range of diseases, including mental, metabolic, and digestive system disorders; cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases; various cancers; and immune and autoimmune diseases ( ). Trends in the number of publications related to various diseases in the recent years (2016–2021) are depicted in . The number of documents related to dysbiosis, in general, exhibits the greatest growth rate, thereby characterizing the dominant fundamental approach of the recent studies in the field.\n\nDigestive System Diseases and Disorders\n\nAlterations to the gut microbiota composition have been associated with various digestive system disorders and diseases, specifically IBS; IBD, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis; diarrhea, and constipation ( ).114−116\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome is one of the most prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorders and is considered as the prototype of disorders of the gut–brain interaction. While alterations in gut–brain interactions have clearly been established in IBS, a causative role of the microbiome remains to be determined. Dysbiosis is one of the hallmarks in the miscommunication between gut and brain and could lead to IBS symptoms. The severity of IBS symptoms has been shown to be correlated with dysbiosis.117,118 In IBS cases, the reduction of microbiome diversity, gut barrier deficiency, gut–brain signaling disorders, and immune disorders are significantly related to the abnormal function of the GI tract.119 Modifications in the composition of the normal microbiota and perturbed colonic fermentation in IBS patients are supposed to play a role in the development of IBS, with a considerable, nearly 2-fold, increase in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes.120 Recent studies have reported well-defined distinction between gut microbiota composition in patients with IBS compared with healthy controls. IBS was typified by enhanced quantities of Firmicutes and specifically in Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and Dorea, along with a distinct decrease of beneficial microbes, such as Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium spp.121 Moreover, a decrease in probiotic species and an increase in pathogenic species have been reported in patients with IBS, including Proteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Bacteroides (Bacteroidetes).122 Fecal transplantation from super donors and microbiome modulation either by pro- or prebiotics have shown beneficial effect in reducing IBS symptoms and improving patients’ quality of life.119,123,124 To date, the guidelines on the treatment of IBS with probiotics remain controversial. The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines125 on the management of IBS, which were updated in 2021, reported that probiotics may be an effective treatment for improving global symptoms and abdominal pain in patients with IBS, which was consistent with the recommendations of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology126 and the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.127 In contrast, the guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology128 suggest against the use of probiotics for the treatment of global IBS symptoms.129\n\nLike IBS, inflammatory bowel disease-related dysbiosis is associated with a general decrease in richness, diversity, and stability of the microbiota.130 This decline in diversity is concomitant with a weakened immune response and setbacks with the cellular barrier functions that normally block bacterial entry from the gut lumen into gut tissue. These malfunctions trigger complications with antibacterial defense and consequent growth of pathogenic bacteria.131 IBD-related dysbiosis is specifically associated with a comprehensive decrease in the quantity and diversity of Firmicutes and an increase in Proteobacteria.132 The decrease in the numbers of Firmicutes is noteworthy since they produce essential short-chain fatty acids, such as acetic and butyric acids, that are known to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties.133 A common feature of the microbial dysbiosis among IBD patients, especially in Crohn’s disease, is the decreased abundance of Firmicutes bacteria belonging to two families that are important functional members of the human gut microbiota—Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae—to which most butyrate-producing bacteria in the human gut belong.134,135 Thus, depletion of these bacterial families in IBD is supposedly correlated to the detected disturbances, such as a lower butyrate-producing capacity of the IBD microbiota.136 Butyrate has a significant potential in IBD therapy because it serves as the colonocytes key energy source, enhances the epithelial barrier integrity, and inhibits inflammation. A probiotics treatment, including consumption of butyrate-producing bacteria to increase in situ butyrate production, may restore gut homeostasis.137−139 A recent study reported that an orally delivered cocktail of bacteriophages targeting an IBD-associated strain of the bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae alleviated intestinal inflammation.131\n\nA growing body of evidence shows that imbalance of the gut microbiota increases susceptibility to various pathogens and causes numerous diseases, including diarrhea.140 At present, the pathogens causing diarrhea are believed to be Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, and Aeromonas.141,142 It has been found that microbial intervention can regulate the composition of the intestinal flora to prevent and improve the occurrence of diarrhea.143 Probiotics containing nonpathogenic live bacteria preparations, such as Lactobacillus, Yeast, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Bacillus, have been demonstrated to treat pathogens-caused diarrhea by preserving or amending the balance of gut microbiota. The mechanisms of the beneficial effect are supposedly related to the inhibitory effect on the colonization of pathogenic bacteria by competing for nutrients and producing antibacterial compounds.144\n\nAccumulating evidence suggests an association between functional constipation and abnormal gut microbiota, with the relationship between gut microbiota and gut transit being likely bidirectional.145 By controlling colonic motility, water content, secretion, and absorption, gut microbiota may promote the development of functional constipation through microbial metabolites, including bile acids, SCFAs, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and methane. Currently, there is no consensus on the gut microbial composition typical for functional constipation patients and the alteration trends of the various microbial classes compared with healthy controls.146−150 However, recent studies showed that changes in the mucosal and fecal microorganisms are linked to functional idiopathic constipation. Taxonomic profiling of intestinal microbiota in constipated adults showed a higher abundance of Bacteroides and other pathogenic microorganisms than in healthy volunteers.151 The increased richness and diversity of the gut microbiomes result in slow colonic transit. In addition, intestinal microbiota in constipated adults have genes involved in pathways that lead to methane, hydrogen, and glycerol production, which can explain the symptoms seen in patients with constipation.151−153 Microbial interventions including probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics, which bring about compositional and functional changes of the gut microbiota, have frequently shown beneficial effects on functional constipation that are in favor of the concept of the significant role of gut microbiota in functional constipation.145 This concept is supported also by the reports that many risk factors of functional constipation, including age, diet, obesity, and stress, have a considerable effect on the gut microbiota.154,155\n\nMental and Neurodegenerative Disorders\n\nGut microbiota have been reported to affect neurological functions along the so-called gut–brain axis (GBA).156 Gut microbiota communicates with the brain through three major routes: the neural route (vagus nerve, enteric nervous system), the immune route (cytokines), and the endocrine route [hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, gut hormones]. Disturbances in any of these routes can result in mental disorders. Dysbiosis in common intestine microbial species of the phylum Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and the genera Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium are supposedly responsible for mental health disorders.157 Gut microbiota moderate the GBA via various ways, such as preserving gut permeability by controlling the integrity of tight junctions in gut epithelium and producing a large selection of metabolites that include neurotransmitters, SCFAs, and amino acids.\n\nA plethora of research reports have indicated the significance of microbiota in the development of neurodegenerative diseases via a variety of microbial metabolites that transmit from the gut to the brain across the GBA.158,159 Changes in the levels of gut microbial metabolites have been reported to be associated with neurological conditions like Parkinson’s disease,160 anorexia nervosa,161 Alzheimer’s disease,162 autism spectrum disorders,163 and chronic stress and depression.164 It is not clear by now, however, whether these disruptions in mental health are the cause or a result of the changes in gut microbiota. Gut dysbiosis has been associated with increased gut permeability and inflammation and it may also cause enhanced levels of circulating gut microbiota metabolites, such as the neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-l-alanine and microbial amyloids.165,166 β-N-Methylamino-l-alanine is one of the gut cyanobacteria-produced neurotoxins causing neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles.167,168 The hypothesis that Parkinson’s disease starts in the gut and spreads to the brain169 is gaining increasing support, thereby showing that the disease is associated with widespread dysbiosis.170\n\nAlterations in the microbiota composition in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with matched healthy controls included a reduction in richness and diversity of gut microbiota with decreased Firmicutes and Bifidobacterium and increased Bacteroidetes.171 Changes in Actinobacteria, Ruminococcus, Lachnospiraceae, and Selenomonadales (1686) have also been reported.172 Cognitively impaired patients exhibited alterations in Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia compared with age-matched cognitively intact individuals.173\n\nTherapeutic interventions including the administration of pre- and probiotics (psychobiotics) to manage mental disorders and/or their symptoms have been undertaken.174,175 These inventions have included probiotic combinations of lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, which has resulted in a significant drop in psychological distress,176 enhanced cognition and communication among patients with Alzheimer’s disease177 and autism spectrum disorders,178 and recovering symptoms among patients with Parkinson’s disease.179 On the basis of the promising results of psychobiotics on controlling or modulating the GBA, additional clinical trials are currently being undertaken to identify bacterial strains as promising candidates for the treatment of mental disorders.\n\nHumans are adapted to a circadian rhythm of 24 h associated with the light/dark cycle on earth. The central circadian clock is located in the hypothalamus, which synchronizes information on environmental light and dark signals to peripheral tissues to keep the body functioning in the same rhythm.180 A disruption of circadian rhythms is associated with various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, sleep, and psychiatric disorders.181,182 Recent studies have reported that gut microbiota are able to control or be controlled by the circadian clock. The mechanisms of such a relationship requires small molecule gut microbiota metabolites, such as bile acids and SCFAs, to act as intermediaries.180 Thus, the levels of butyrate and propionate show obvious daily oscillations. Moreover, these oscillations are lost under high-fat diets.183 The impacts of gut microbiota metabolites on circadian rhythm are extensive and are connected to other functions of gut microbiota metabolites, such as energy metabolism and immunity. These interconnections between different physiological functions via the link of gut microbiota metabolites are essential for understanding the functions of gut microbiota metabolites and the general role of gut microbes in human health and disease.\n\nMetabolic Disorders\n\nSystemic metabolic diseases that are believed to be strongly affected by gut microbiota status include obesity and diabetes.184 Gut microbial composition is strongly affected by dietary routines. As a result of a high-fat diet, the intestinal microbiome is modified with rising amounts of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and reduced levels of Bacteroidetes. The Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio has been correlated to body weight, which means it is larger for obese people.185Clostridium difficile infections can also trigger obesity. Generally, obesity is affected by the inflammatory status induced by gut bacteria or their metabolites, which regulate the GBA.108,185\n\nDiabetes is another metabolic disease that is strongly associated with the gut microbiome. Studies have reported an increased quantity of Villanella, Clostridium, and Bacteroides and a decreased quantity of Lactobacillus, Eubacterium rectale, Blautia coccoides, and Bifidobacterium in children with type 1 diabetes. Besides, negative correlation has been reported between plasma glucose level and Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus spp., and Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes spp., while there has been positive correlation between Clostridium and plasma glucose level. The ratios of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes were reported to exhibit a positive connection with plasma glucose levels. The Lactobacillus genus was also in lower quantity in type 2 diabetes patients, and Bifidobacterium was in higher quantity compared with control groups.108,186 Risks for the development of type 2 diabetes have been correlated to the composition of gut microbiota, as well. The alterations in the gut microbiota of individuals with type 2 diabetes have been small compared with the control group, yet a consistent decline in the metabolically beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria was reported.186 Overall, type 2 diabetes was associated with a reduced quantity of SCFAs-producing bacteria, in particular butyric acid, which has been related to insulin sensitivity.187,188 The relation between SCFAs and insulin sensitivity stems from the capacity of SCFAs to stimulate the secretion of GLP-1 by intestinal L-cells via G protein receptors, which has a significant impact on insulin release.189\n\nClose relations between the metabolic and immune systems are now largely supported, and intestinal microbiota is being progressively identified as an important factor connecting genes, environment, and the immune system.190\n\nCOVID-19\n\nRecently, correlation has been reported between gut microbiota composition and levels of cytokines and inflammatory markers in patients with COVID-19.191,192 It is suggested that the gut microbiome is involved in the magnitude of COVID-19 symptoms’ severity via modulation of the host’s immune responses. Moreover, gut microbiota dysbiosis could contribute to persistent symptoms even after disease resolution, thereby emphasizing a need to understand how gut microorganisms are involved in inflammation and COVID-19.A recent study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection indeed disrupts the gut microbiome.193 This boosts secondary bacterial infections both by facilitating pathogenic bacteria to colonize the gut and by modifying gut lining to allow these bacteria to spread from the gut to the bloodstream of COVID-19 patients. These results confirm the direct role of gut microbiome dysbiosis in facilitating grave secondary infections upon COVID-19 malady.193\n\nThe alterations to the gut microbiota composition related to digestive system diseases, mental health, and metabolic disorders are summarized in Table 1.\n\nTable 1\n\ndiseases↓ decreasing bacteria↑ increasing bacteriadigestive system diseasesirritable bowel syndrome194−199BifidobacteriumRuminococcusFaecalibacterium prausnitziiDoreaBacteroidesEnterobacteriaceaeLactobacillaceaeBacteroidesFirmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratioIBD: Crohn’s disease200,201BacteroidesFaecalibacterium prausnitziiBifidobacterium adolescentisIBD: ulcerative colitis139,200BifidobacteriaRoseburia hominisFaecalibacterium prausnitziiLachnospiraceaeRuminococcaceaemental health disordersanxiety disorder202,203BacteriodetesBacteroidaceaeRuminococcus gnavusEnterobacteriaceaeFusobacteriumBurkholderiaceaepost-traumatic stress disorder204ActinobacteriaLentisphaeraeVerrucomicrobiadepression205−207PrevotellaEggerthellaDialisterHoldemaniaTuricibacterParaprevotelladementia172ActinobacteriaEscherichiaBacteroidesBlautiaBifidobacteriumStreptococcusLactobacillusDoreametabolic disordersdiabetes type 1208,209LactobacillusClostridiumBifidobacteriumBacteroidesBlautia coccoidesVeillonellaEubacterium rectaleActinobacteriaPrevotellaProteobacteriaAkkermansiaLactococcusFirmicutesdiabetes type 2199,209,210FirmicutesBetaproteobacteriaClostridiaLactobacillusBacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratioAkkermansia muciniphiliaRoseburiaobesity199,211BacteroidetesEnterobacteriaMethanobrevibacter smithiiRuminococcus gnavusRuminococcus flavefaciensActinobacteriaBifidobacteriumPrevotellaceae\n\nGut Bacteria–Disease Correlations\n\nIn an effort to get better insight into the gut microbiota impact on well-being, we explored the correlations between the major classes of gut bacteria and certain mental and gastrointestinal disorders, as reflected in the number of records in the CAS Content Collection ( ).\n\nAs seen from , Bacteroidetes are the most studied class of gut bacteria with relation to gastrointestinal and mental health, specifically with relation to stress, depression, and anxiety. Bacteroidetes are known to have a very broad metabolic potential and are regarded as one of the most stable parts of gastrointestinal microflora that exhibits remarkable nutritional flexibility and an ability to respond to stress.212 However, the exact mechanisms underlying any possible relationship between Bacteroidetes and mental and gastrointestinal health remains unclear, and further research is needed to fully understand this complex relationship.\n\nFirmicutes are the second extensively studied class of gut bacteria with relation to gastrointestinal and mental health, especially in relation to stress and depression ( ). Many members of the Firmicutes phylum, such as Lactobacillus, are probiotic. The relationship between Firmicutes and gastrointestinal disorders may be mediated by a number of different factors, such as the production of SCFAs by Firmicutes, which are an important energy source for the gut epithelium and have anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, some Firmicutes bacteria are involved in the fermentation of complex carbohydrates and the production of beneficial metabolites, such as butyrate, which has been shown to have protective effects against colorectal cancer.213 Like with Bacteroidetes, the exact relationship between Firmicutes and mental and gastrointestinal disorders is still being studied and is not fully understood.\n\nThe interest in Fusobacteria with respect to the gastrointestinal and mental health is mainly related to diarrhea and constipation ( ). Recent evidence is emerging that this bacterium may be related to human colon cancer.214\n\nIt is noteworthy that recent meta-analysis has reinforced the genetic correlations between Alzheimer’s disease and the gut microbiome genera.215 For example, genus Actinobacterium Collinsella was confirmed to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes.215 It is also worth reiterating that the gut microbiota is a complex and diverse community of microorganisms, and changes in any one particular phylum are unlikely to fully explain the development of any particular disorder or condition. Rather, the gut microbiota as a whole are likely to play a role in shaping our physical and mental health, and further research is needed to fully understand the complex relationships between the gut microbiota and overall well-being.\n\nTherapeutic Strategies for the Treatment of Mental and Gastrointestinal Disorders\n\nImbalances within the gut microbiome–brain axis have been linked to a range of mental and gastrointestinal disorders. Assorted therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating the gut microbiome or the gut–brain axis may be effective in improving outcomes for these conditions.\n\nDietary Interventions\n\nA high-fiber diet can increase the production of SCFAs, which can help to maintain gut barrier function and reduce inflammation. SCFAs can also promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, which can outcompete pathogenic bacteria and reduce inflammation.216\n\nA diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) can reduce symptoms in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome by reducing the fermentation of certain carbohydrates in the gut, which can cause symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain. However, the low-FODMAP diet can also reduce the diversity of gut bacteria and may have negative long-term effects on gut health.217,218\n\nProbiotics and Prebiotics\n\nProbiotics can improve gut barrier function by enhancing the production of mucus and tight junction proteins, which can prevent the entry of harmful molecules and pathogens into the bloodstream. They can also reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines and modulate the activity of immune cells in the gut, thereby promoting an anti-inflammatory response.219,220\n\nPrebiotics can increase the production of metabolites, such as SCFAs, which are important energy sources for gut cells and can help to maintain gut barrier integrity. SCFAs can also activate G protein-coupled receptors on immune cells, thereby leading to the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines.221,222\n\nAntibiotics\n\nAntibiotics can kill harmful bacteria in the gut, which reduces inflammation and restores gut barrier function. However, antibiotics can also have negative effects on the gut microbiome, such as by reducing the diversity of gut bacteria and promoting the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Antibiotics should be used judiciously and only when necessary.223,224\n\nFecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT)\n\nFMT can restore the composition and function of the gut microbiome, which can reduce inflammation and improve gut–brain communication. FMT has been shown to be effective in treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and is being investigated for other conditions, such as IBD and autism.225−227\n\nPsychotherapeutic Interventions\n\nPsychotherapeutic interventions can reduce stress and improve gut–brain communication. Stress can disrupt gut microbiome composition and function, which leads to inflammation and the development of diseases related to the gut microbiome–brain axis. The reduction of stress can be an effective way to improve gut health and reduce symptoms in these conditions.228−230\n\nPharmacological Interventions\n\nDrugs that target the gut–brain axis can modulate gut microbiome composition and function and reduce inflammation. For example, certain drugs that target the serotonin system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can modulate gut–brain communication and have been shown to be effective in treating conditions, such as depression and anxiety.231,232\n\ndemonstrates the annual growth in the number of documents in the CAS Content Collection related to various therapeutic interventions applied for the treatment of mental and gastrointestinal disorders. Fecal transplant as a new therapeutic strategy exhibits the fastest growth rate recently.\n\nThe various strategies to treating diseases related to the gut microbiome–brain axis can work through multiple mechanisms, including modulating gut microbiome composition and function, reducing inflammation, and improving gut–brain communication.233 However, the underlying mechanisms are complex and require further research to fully understand.\n\nGut Microbiota Metabolites\n\nIt is estimated that the human gut microbiome contains more than 22 million microbial genes,234 which exceeds the ∼22,000 genes present in the entire human genome.235 These genes enable the gut microbiota in the host to synthesize a myriad of enzymes with versatile capabilities to ferment and degrade a variety of compounds that humans do not have the genetic machinery to metabolize. As a result, the gut microbiota can generate a battery of metabolites with a wide spectrum of bioactivities. The gut microbiota-derived metabolites can be broadly divided into three types according to their origination: (1) metabolites that are produced by gut microbiota directly from diets; (2) metabolites that are generated by the host and modified by gut microbiota; (3) metabolites that are produced de novo.236 A selection of important gut microbiota metabolites related to gut–brain communication is shown in Table 2.\n\nGut Microbiota Metabolites with Impact on Brain Function\n\nThe gut microbiota provides essential signaling metabolites that are vital for the host’s physiology. While in healthy individuals, gut microbiota metabolites are effective in maintaining the important functions of hosts, perturbations in the production of these metabolites can initiate various diseases, such as digestive system diseases, neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, and cancer.236\n\nResearch has shown that gut microbiota is crucial for normal brain development and function.237,238 For example, administration of 4-ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS), a tyrosine derivative, to mice at 3–6 weeks postnatal induced anxiety-like behavior. The biosynthetic pathway analysis and mechanisms behind the detrimental effects of 4-EPS showed that 4-EPS interfered with oligodendrocyte maturation, myelination, and brain activity patterns. p-Cresol, another tyrosine derivative and a metabolite, has also been directly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.239,240 Further, certain bacteria-related metabolites, such as trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), 5-aminovaleric acid (5-AVA), 5-AVA betaine (5-AVAB), imidazolepropionic acid, and hippuric acid have been reported to promote early-life axonogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.241 Moreover, the neurogenic properties of microbe metabolites may not be limited to early life given that indole, a tryptophan metabolite, has been reported to increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus of adult mice.242 Pilot studies using fecal microbiota transplantation in children enabled the assessment of whether early life interventions affecting the gut microbiota composition exerted long-term neurodevelopment effects.243,244 Thus, maternal fecal microbiota transplantation in cesarean-born infants was found to rapidly restore normal gut microbial development.244\n\nGut microbiota and its metabolites can affect the host metabolism of neuroactive compounds.245 The foremost examples of gut bacteria-derived neurotransmitters are aromatic amino acid derivatives dopamine and norepinephrine and glutamate derivative γ-aminobutyric acid.246,247 Microbiota have been found to extensively contribute to the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine via the activity of β-glucuronidase.248 Kynurenic acid, a tryptophan metabolite, functions as a glutamate modulator to reduce glutamate levels in the glutamatergic signaling in the hippocampus. Thus, enhanced cognitive abilities and memory in model animals have been achieved as a result of enhancing glutamate levels via limiting hippocampal kynurenic supply.249,250 Over 90% of serotonin in the body is known to be produced in the gut in a process in which gut microbes play an important regulatory role.251,252 Tyramine, deoxycholic acid, and 4-aminobenzoic acid have been reported to stimulate serotonin synthesis.252 Furthermore, microbiota-related metabolites, such as norepinephrine, indole, indole-3-aldehyde, isovaleric acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid stimulate serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells.253,254 Another gut microbiota metabolite with a likely connection to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) expression in brain is lactate.255,256 It has been shown to affect neural plasticity and has a beneficial effect on learning and memory in model animals.257 SCFAs, particularly butyric acid, may also have additional regulatory effects on the signal transduction to the brain via the vagal nerve and by inducing the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters in the CNS.258 Administration of SCFAs, such as butyric, acetic, and propionic acid, has been reported to improve stress response, anxiety, and depression.259 The presence of pipecolic acid in the CNS can be partially derived from the gut microbiota and has been also associated with GABA signaling and release.245,260,261\n\nGut microbiota has also proven vital for normal BBB function, especially during pre- and postnatal periods.262 In a mice model of traumatic brain injury typified by acute BBB disruption, sodium butyrate administration exhibited an alleviating effect on BBB integrity.263 Propionic acid, another SCFA gut microbiome metabolite, has also been shown to promote BBB integrity by mitigating oxidative and proinflammatory pathways.264 It has been suggested that the effects of SCFAs on BBB integrity may rather be brought about by peripheral signaling instead of direct uptake to the brain, as implied by animal models.258 Secondary bile acids, such as deoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid, may also modulate BBB integrity.265,266 Trimethylamine, a metabolite of dietary choline, betaine, and l-carnitine, has been reported to exert detrimental impact on the BBB integrity. It is noteworthy that physiologically appropriate doses of the oxidized form of trimethylamine, TMAO, improved the BBB integrity.267\n\nA large portion of the brain’s energy production is consumed by the neurons, the major component of the nervous tissue, in order to maintain the excitability of the synapses.268 Lactate, a major gut microbiota metabolite, is known to augment neural activity as a primary energy source.269 Modulation of brain energy metabolism in the hippocampus along the GBA is suggested to be responsible for improvement in the cognitive function after intermittent fasting in model animals.270 It has been found that fasting considerably increased plasma levels of indolepropionic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid and fecal levels of SCFAs. Administrations of indolepropionic acid or tauroursodeoxycholic acid or a SCFAs mixture including acetic, propionic, and butyric acid have been able to reproduce the effects of fasting in cognition, hippocampal mitochondrial biogenesis, and energy metabolism-related gene expression. Findings connecting microbial metabolites to brain bioenergetics are preliminary but show that certain compounds are incorporated in the neuronal energy metabolism.\n\nGut microbiota metabolites reducing oxidative stress or neurotoxic proteins aggregation are functioning as neuroprotective agents. Metabolites that reduce inflammation or promote neurodevelopment or neurotransmission can also be considered as neuroprotectants. For example, ferulic acid is known to be metabolized by gut microbes.271 It exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing neuronal cell death and recovers memory deficits in a cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury model.272 It has also ameliorated depressionlike behavior and oxidative stress.273 Dihydroferulic acid, a microbiota metabolite, has also been shown to exhibit neuroprotective antioxidative properties.274\n\nThe gut microbiome metabolites and their mechanism of action in mental health and brain development are depicted in , and their function and associated diseases are summarized in Table 3.\n\nTable 3\n\nmetabolite class/referencesspecific functionsassociated diseasesshort-chain fatty acids258,285−290– gut microbiota composition regulation– diabetes– gut barrier integrity support– obesity– energy homeostasis support– nonalcoholic fatty liver disease– gut hormone production– ulcerative colitis– circadian rhythm regulation– Crohn’s disease– proinflammatory cytokines inhibition– colorectal cancer– immunomodulation– autism spectrum disorder– water, sodium, calcium, magnesium absorption– Parkinson’s disease– regulation of intestinal pH value– diarrhea– IBS– constipation– functional dyspepsia (FD)bile acids (BAs)291−295– lipid and vitamin absorption regulation– obesity– gut microbiota composition regulation– nonalcoholic steatohepatitis– gut hormones production– ulcerative colitis– intestinal immunity– cancer– intestinal electrolyte and fluid balance– multiple sclerosis– gut motility– Alzheimer’s disease– gut barrier integrity– Parkinson’s disease– lipid homeostasis– traumatic brain injury– glucose homeostasis– stroke– amino acid homeostasis– amyotrophic lateral sclerosis– circadian rhythm– IBS– neurotransmissiontryptophan and indole derivatives296−300– gut microbial spore formation– ulcerative colitis– drug resistance– Crohn’s disease– biofilm formation– obesity– intestinal barrier function regulation– stroke– gut hormone secretion– mucosal candidiasis– gut motility– autism spectrum disorder– immunomodulation– Alzheimer’s disease– Parkinson’s disease– migraine– schizophrenia– IBScholine metabolites301−303– bile acid synthesis inhibition– nonalcoholic fatty liver disease– inflammation promotion– obesity– thrombosis– diabetes– myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis– hypertension– mitochondrial dysfunction exacerbationvitamins304−306– cellular metabolism regulation– vitamin-associated diseases– immunomodulation– schizophrenia– cell proliferation– autism– vitamins supply– dementia– IBS– IBDneurotransmitters307−309– gut motility regulation– Parkinson’s disease– memory support– autism spectrum disorder– stress response– IBD– nervous system– IBS– immune responselipids184,310,311– systemic inflammation promotion– diabetes– hyperinsulinemia regulation– obesity– immunomodulation– nonalcoholic fatty liver disease– bile acid synthesis– hyperinsulinemia– hypercholesterolemia– chronic hepatitis Cgases307,312−316– gut motility– colitis– gut inflammation– ulcer– epithelial secretion– IBS– mucosal blood flow\n\nGut Microbiota Metabolites’ Role in Digestive System\n\nGut microbiota imparts specific function in the host’s digestive system, in nutrient metabolism, xenobiotic and drug metabolism, in preservation of the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, and in protection against pathogens ( ).\n\nGut microbiota mostly get nutrients from dietary carbohydrates. Fermentation of the carbohydrates, including indigestible oligosaccharides by the microbes in the colon, such as Bacteroides, Roseburia, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Enterobacter, ends in the synthesis of SCFAs, such as butyric, propionic, and acetic acids, which are important sources of energy for the host.275 Gut microbiota have a positive role in lipid metabolism, as well, by controlling the lipoprotein lipase activity inhibition in adipocytes.31\n\nIntestinal microbiota also exhibit a resourceful protein metabolizing machinery, which operates by means of the microbial proteinases and peptidases in conjunction with the human proteinases. Examples include the conversion of l-histidine into histamine by the bacterial enzyme histamine decarboxylase and glutamate to γ-amino butyric acid by glutamate decarboxylases.276,277\n\nSCFAs can regulate the pH value in the intestine and regulate the absorption of water, sodium, calcium, and magnesium. Furthermore, SCFAs, especially butyrate, provide more than 70% of the energy for the intestinal epithelial cells on top of their abilities to inhibit the multiplication and growth of pathogenic bacteria and the activity of intestinal inflammatory mediators, thus playing an anti-inflammatory role in the intestinal tract.278\n\nLipid metabolites can affect intestinal permeability and intestinal immunity. The gut microbiota can produce lipopolysaccharides that could stimulate proinflammatory mediators, thereby disrupting the body’s immune system and inducing local and systemic inflammatory responses.279 Sphingolipids can be produced by the intestinal symbiotic bacteria Bacteroidetes and Prevotellaceae. It has been found in animal studies that sphingolipids can also aggravate intestinal inflammation.280\n\nIndole-derived metabolites are produced by fermentation via Clostridium sporogenes and Escherichia coli. Such metabolites are able to participate in the regulation of gastrointestinal disorders by influencing the gut–brain axis and protecting against stress-induced damage in the gastrointestinal tract. Tryptophan is a key monoamine neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of central neurotransmission and intestinal physiological functions, and studies have shown that the gastrointestinal microbiome can regulate the gut–brain axis through tryptophan metabolism.281,282\n\nGases can be produced by gut microbiota as a result of the fermentation process. These gases include hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and nitric oxide (NO), which can modulate the gastrointestinal physiology of hosts.236\n\nXiao et al.283 in a recent review article highlighted the important microbial metabolites in the context of host physiology in patients with different IBS subtypes. The abundance of microorganisms and their corresponding metabolites in constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) and diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) differ, thereby providing a new avenue for the diagnosis and treatment of different IBS subtypes in the future. These microbiota-derived metabolites, such as bile acids (BAs), SCFAs, vitamins, amino acids, 5-HT, and hypoxanthine, can be produced directly by bacteria, or from dietary or relevant substrates. Fluctuations and alterations in the levels of metabolites produced by the host or microbiota provide insights into their interactions during IBS. Moreover, low levels of hypoxanthine may be associated with colonic epithelial energy and capacity for mucosal repair with hypoxia. Purine starvation has been identified as a potential novel mechanism underlying IBS with lower fecal hypoxanthine abundance in IBS-C and IBS-D. Additionally, mucosal biofilms are an endoscopic feature of IBS and are associated with bacterial and BA metabolites dysbiosis. Additionally, deficiency in levels of both vitamins D and B6 have emerged as causative factors in IBS symptoms pathogenesis.283\n\nMicrobial dysbiosis and metabolites derived from interaction of the host and gut microbiota have been reported as an intermediate link contributing to the development of functional constipation via various signal pathways, including but not limited to SCFAs, BAs, and methane that occupied a more important position.153 5-HT is also involved in the modulation of gut motility and secretory, as well as sensory, transmission in patients with constipation.284 Altogether, current studies have provided us with a new conception on the microbial mechanisms and therapeutic targets of constipation.\n\nThe gut microbiome metabolites and their function and associated digestive diseases/disorders are summarized in Table 3.\n\nGut Microbiome–Brain Axis\n\nCNS and the human GI tract communicate through the gut–brain axis (GBA). This bidirectional connection involves neuronal, endocrine, and immunological mechanisms. The gut is considered as our “second brain,” because of its hosting the enteric nervous system (ENS), a neural network that allows the gut to work without instructions from the brain. The ENS maintains control of our digestive system; it plays an important role in peristalsis, secretion, and pain perception. There is mounting data that gut microbiota are the source of a number of neuroactive and immunocompetent substances, as shown above, that help to shape the structure and function of brain regions involved in the control of emotions, cognition, and physical activity and contribute to the proper maintenance of gastrointestinal homeostasis. Most GI diseases are associated with altered transmission within the GBA that are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.317\n\nFunctional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) were previously considered as purely functional disorders with no scientific confirmation of a clear pathogenetic mechanism. According to Rome IV, the phenotype of FGIDs results from an altered transmission of nerve and biochemical signals within the gut microbiome–brain axis with mechanisms controlled by both genetic and environmental factors. Consequently, FGIDs were recently renamed into disorders of gut–brain interactions.318 The overlap of DGBI and CNS disorders has been documented, and it has been demonstrated that approximately one-third of IBS patients suffer from depression. It is estimated that psychiatric symptoms occur in at least 36.5% of FGIDs patients. Stasi et al. found that the highest prevalence of mental or spectrum disorders is in patients with functional constipation (60%) compared with patients diagnosed with FD (52.4%), IBS (36.5), and/or functional bloating (47.6%). The most prevalent psychiatric disorders observed in FGIDs were general anxiety disorder and panic.319\n\nRecent advances in this field have enabled us to better understand some of the pathophysiological consequences of an aberrant reciprocal gut–brain network, including exacerbated gut inflammation disorders, altered responses to stress, as well as altered behavioral states. Therefore, the GBA presents an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutics for an ever-growing list of disorders related to mental and digestive health. Improved targeting of the gut microbiome–brain axis, for example through application of biotics, is expected to pave the way for the development of novel disease therapies and self-care products to promote and maintain heathy status.320\n\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nIBS is one of the most common DGBI worldwide and typically presents in early adulthood with symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. On the basis of the bowel habits, IBS can be classified into four subtypes: constipation-predominant, diarrhea-predominant, mixed-type (IBS-M), and undefined IBS (IBS-U). Symptom intensity varies over time and between individuals, but IBS has been reported, in severe cases to affect quality of life as much as renal impairment or diabetes.321 IBS represents up to 50% of all referrals to gastroenterologists with a prevalence rate of up to 11% globally.322 The recent consensus view is that IBS results from abnormal gut–brain interactions. Recent epidemiological data has suggested that in individuals developing both IBS and psychological features, the former preceded the latter in two-thirds of cases, and the latter preceded the former in one-third.323 IBS is associated with abnormalities of central pain processing but also increased gut permeability, mast cell activation, disordered motility, and dysbiosis.\n\nA recent genome-wide analysis study for 53 400 IBS patients and 433 201 controls highlights shared genetic pathways between IBS and mood and anxiety disorders. The study identified and confirmed six genetic susceptibility loci for IBS, and four of them are associated with mood and anxiety disorders, thereby suggesting, for example, that shared pathogenic pathways rather than anxiety cause abdominal symptoms.324\n\n5-HT signaling is one particular pathway of importance in IBS pathogenesis. It has been demonstrated that a functional GI tract involves 5-HT signaling between enterochromaffin cells acting as sensory transducers, and the majority of 5-HT is synthesized, stored, and released by these cells, which interact with intrinsic and extrinsic sensory nerve afferents in the mucosal layer of the gut.320 5-HT signaling controls many GI functions, including secretion; vasodilation; peristalsis; and sensory perception, such as pain and nausea.325−327 Moreover, serotonergic function and tryptophan metabolism are known to be altered in IBS patients.328−331\n\nIBS pathophysiology implicates altered gut microbiota composition, impaired intestinal mucosal integrity, and low-grade inflammation. In addition to pathways through the circulatory system, several of these factors may also trigger fluctuations in the activity of the ENS with subsequent effect on the brain.332 Furthermore, the vagus nerve can be modulated by diet-responsive gut microbes and metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, or endocrine factors, enzymes, and neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, and noradrenaline.333−336 Each of these factors are potentially affected by alterations in microbiota composition and are involved in IBS pathology.337\n\nIdentifying a clear IBS microbial signature is not an easy task because of the heterogeneity of the healthy gut microbiota. However, multiple studies have shown differences in the gut microbiota between IBS and healthy controls. A recent systematic review showed that IBS patients have increased levels of the bacterial families Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Bacteroidales, whereas Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Clostridiales were decreased compared with healthy controls.122 On the contrary, Hugerth et al. recently reported no distinct microbiota signature of IBS in a random Swedish population of 3556 participants.338 Interestingly, intestinal bacterial composition has been reported to be highly dependent on sample type and regional localization. Also, mucosa-associated bacterial composition of the sigmoid colon differs between patients with IBS and healthy controls.339\n\nOne of the most consistent findings in brain neuroimaging of IBS patients has been alterations in the structure and function of key regions of the somatosensory network, including the globus pallidus, putamen, and caudate, which composes the basal ganglia.340 Increased gray matter density in the hypothalamus and decreased gray matter density in the prefrontal cortex have been reported in the IBS brain.341 In rectal distention experiments, patients with IBS had a differential brain response in the pain matrix and default mode network.342 IBS patients showed increased engagement of endogenous pain faciliatory pathways and decreased levels of the endogenous pain inhibitory mechanism in the brain regions associated with visceral afferent processing and emotional arousal, including the left dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus and the bilateral anterior insulae.343 A meta-analysis of adult studies that evaluated brain response to rectal balloon distension by functional MRI (fMRI) reported differences between healthy control subjects and patients with IBS in these brain regions.344 IBS patients with a history of abuse reported increased pain and anxiety with rectal distension accompanied by similar fMRI changes.345 The stress and arousal circuit demonstrated in human subjects by fMRI shares significant homology with the stress circuit related to CRF–CRF1 receptor signaling in rodents, thereby potentially implicating the HPA axis as a facilitator of gut–brain axis communication.346\n\nRecently, evidence for disrupted subcortical and cortical regions mediated by gut microbial modulation has been emerging in IBS. An association between brain region-to-region functional connectivity and microbiota has been reported. Labus et al. found a correlation between Clostridia and Bacteroidia with connectivity of the thalamus, the basal ganglia (caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, nucleus accumbens), the superior part of the precentral gyrus, the anterior insula, and the ventral prefrontal regions in IBS patients.347 Recently, the same group also reported on fecal metabolites and resting state fMRI where the differences in histidine, cysteine, glycine, glutamate, spermidine, and anserine were significantly associated with the alteration in the left dorsal part of the posterior cingulate gyrus to the left putamen. Also, the changes in histidine, tryptophan, uracil, 2-deoxyuridine, thymidine, and succinate were differentially associated with the alteration in the right superior frontal gyrus to the right putamen. Interestingly, this interaction may be mediated by aberrant tryptophan signaling in IBS, which is important because it is a substrate for serotonin synthesis.348\n\nPrevious studies have compared brain differences between IBS-C and IBS-D. These studies have examined task states and have shown group-related differences in brain networks involved in integrating emotions [emotional arousal network, (EAN)], perception [sensorimotor network, (SMN); salience network, (SAL)], visceral functions [central autonomic network, (CAN)], and pain processing [default mode network, (DMN); central executive network, (CEN); SMN; SAL; EAN; and others).349 Prior studies comparing IBS-C, IBS-D, and healthy controls (HCs) undergoing aversive rectal stimuli have identified abnormal connectivity in the SAL350,351 and EAN343,350 in IBS-C and in the occipital network (OCC)351 in IBS-D. This may indicate a greater importance of alterations in sensory, emotional, and autonomic responses associated with the perception of visceral pain and discomfort in IBS-C. A recent study has tested the hypothesis that IBS-C exhibits bowel-habit-specific changes in the brain that reflect altered sensory and emotional regulation processing of visceral inputs from the “top-down,” while IBS-D would have widespread gut microbiome and metabolome changes (e.g., tryptophan, SCFAs), which may translate to “bottom-up” brain changes (e.g., SMN, DMN).349 Indeed, in IBS-D, the study’s findings showed a correlation between high levels of gut metabolites tryptophan and phenylalanine and aberrant connectivity in brain regions involved in processing unpleasant visceral stimuli (SMN) and self-related thoughts (DMN).349 These results suggest that increased tryptophan in the gut may lead to loosened stool, and tryptophan-related signaling may travel to the posterior insula and increase pain perception and emotional salience in IBS-D, thereby suggesting a “bottom-up” signaling direction. However, IBS-C’s microbiome and metabolome resembled HC, and the increased connectivity in the default mode (DMN) and salience (SAL) networks compared with IBS-D may indicate abnormalities in the emotional physiological processing of visceral signals.349 IBS-C’s relatively isolated brain changes may indicate a more “top-down” mechanism to produce the constipation-predominant phenome. That study by Sarnoff et al. has shown a link between the chronicity of IBS symptoms, B. stercoris and F. prausnitzii, and brain connectivity in the caudate nuclei.\n\nThus, we might be in the mere beginning of understanding how alterations in gut microbiota may lead to the disruption of the intricate host–gut–microbiota interaction: is it a cause or a result of IBS pathology? In the past decade, much knowledge has been gained from clinical microbiota-altering interventions, such as the low-FODMAP diet and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which have emerged as debatably successful treatment strategies. However, their effects on the gut microbiome–brain axis are still far from understood. It has been proposed that probiotic amelioration of IBS symptoms may be acting indirectly through an anti-inflammatory mechanism.352 Such anti-inflammatory mechanisms may also be partially responsible for the positive effects of dietary restrictions, such as those seen in the low-FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet in IBS.353−355 An alternate method for IBS treatment involves FMT from non-IBS individuals to patients with IBS.356−359\n\nFunctional Dyspepsia\n\nFunctional dyspepsia (FD) is a worldwide prevalent DGBI affecting 10%–30% of adults and 3.5%–27% of children worldwide.360 The main clinical symptoms of patients are early satiety, postprandial discomfort, epigastric pain, epigastric distension, epigastric burning, loss of appetite, belching, nausea, and vomiting, which are often accompanied by anxiety and depression.361 FD pathogenesis is linked to GI dysmotility, visceral hypersensitivity, impaired gastric tolerance, disrupted gastrointestinal mucosal integrity, abnormal function of the gut microbiome–brain axis, increased eosinophils in duodenum, dysbiosis, Helicobacter-pylori infection, postgastrointestinal infection, diet, genetics, and mental and psychological factors.278\n\nAn increasing number of studies have confirmed the close association between disturbance in the relative abundance and composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota and the occurrence and progression of FD. Actinomyces, Atopobium, Leptotrichia, Prevotella, and Veilonella counts differ between FD and control patients.362 The finding was preceded by an observation that, in FD patients, gut barrier integrity is impaired and expressed as lowered transepithelial resistance; diminished expression of proteins of tight junctions; and lastly, elevated levels of mast cells, eosinophils, and interstitial lymphocytes.363\n\nSurprisingly, FD patients not only had different gastrointestinal microbiota compared with non-FD, but also had different oral microbiota abundance and composition. Proteobacteria were the dominant bacteria in FD patients’ saliva, while Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria in healthy controls. The abundance of Spirochaetes in FD patients was higher than that in healthy controls, while the abundance of Fusobacteria, TM7, and Proteobacteria was lower than in healthy controls, and the levels of Kingella and Abiotrophia genus levels were also significantly different.364\n\nMental illness plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of FD. Anxiety at baseline has been shown to increase the risk of developing FD by almost 8 times after 10 years follow-up.365 Interestingly, multiple studies highlighted that the prevalence of anxiety and depression is significantly increased in patients with FD compared with healthy people. Furthermore, pathophysiological research indicates that psychosocial factors and mental disorders may play a role in FD by modulating both visceral signal processing in the brain366 and the effects of stress hormones on pain perception.367 Furthermore, it is known that psychosocial factors and stress hormones also affect other aspects of the GI tract, such as motility, immune system activation, permeability, and microbiota.\n\nHowever, FD symptoms are thought to induce anxiety or depression because of a cytokine response in low-grade intestinal inflammation, which plays an important role in the development of psychological distress in patients with FD.368 A growing body of evidence suggests that the gut microbiota communicates with the central nervous system, possibly neuro-immuno-humoral pathways, thereby influencing brain function.369 Furthermore, microbiota release neuroactive compounds, such as GABA, serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine, thereby acting locally on the enteric nervous system. Some of these neuroactive substances access the brain through the blood and the circumventricular organs or via the vagus nerve. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that a disturbed microbiome might affect mental health, followed by anxiety and depression. Thus, the mental disorders might be a consequence of the dysbiosis and, therefore, promote the development of FD, which may explain the findings that anxiety increases the risk of FD365 and observations indicating that psychosocial factors and mental disorders may play a role in FD by modulating visceral signal processing in the brain.366,370\n\nFunctional Constipation\n\nFunctional constipation (FC) is a common DGBI with a global prevalence ranging approximately from 10.1 to 15.3%371 and is characterized by difficult bowel movements and/or a sense of incomplete evacuation, thus influencing quality of life.372 Previous studies showed that the gastrointestinal microbiota composition of constipation is clearly distinct from that of normal individuals. The species diversity of microbiota in the patient samples was lower than that in healthy subjects; it was also accompanied by significantly reduced levels of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and an increased abundance of Desulfovibrionaceae.373 Levels of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, were significantly reduced in patients with FC.373 It has also been confirmed that the relative abundance of methanogenic bacteria is increased in patients with slow transit constipation relative to healthy subjects.373,374 In another study, Chen et al. collected 3056 fecal amplicon sequence data from five research cohorts and used machine-learning methods to construct the constipation discriminant model. The model identified 15 top-ranking biomarkers, particularly inflammation-related pathogenic bacterial genera Serratia, Dorea, and Aeromonas.375 A recent shotgun metagenomics study confirmed the results of previous studies by showing that the relative abundance of Roseburia intestinalis, a prominent butyrate-producing bacterium, was reduced in patients with constipation in comparison with healthy controls, and the microbiome corresponding to constipation was enriched for pathways implicated in methanogenesis.376 In contrast, the microbiome of healthy individuals was characterized by high levels of genes associated with carbohydrate, fatty acid, and lipid metabolism.150\n\nNotably, different intestinal sites harbor certain gut microbiomes, yet the majority of recent research has focused on the analysis of fecal-derived microbiota, which are accessible via noninvasive sampling methods. However, luminal microbiota is generally considered to be representative of the distal large intestinal content. The mucosa-associated microbiota, which live in more intimate contact with the host, cannot be fully replicated by fecal microbiota.377 In patients with constipation, there is even less similarity between fecal- and mucosa-associated microbiota compared with healthy controls and patients with diarrhea.116 These differences may be due to drier stool allowing fewer signaling molecules to enter the mucosa378 or the longer transit time providing more opportunities for the communities to diverge.116 Hence, mucosa-associated microbiota are more likely to affect the host’s epithelial and mucosal function than luminal microbiota.379 Comparative analyses between fecal and mucosal microbiota showed that the colonic mucosal microbiota composition was correlated with constipation (and was accompanied by a significant increase in Bacteroidetes), while the fecal microbial communities were correlated with colonic transit and methane production rather than constipation.380 However, more evidence is needed to prove the relationship between the mucosal profile and constipation.\n\nSlow gut transit has been associated with reduced fecal water content, higher fecal pH, higher microbial cell density and diversity, and a shift in microbial metabolism from saccharolysis toward proteolysis, as reflected by reduced levels of short-chain fatty acids and increased levels of branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA).381 It is likely that once easily accessible carbohydrate sources become scarce in the colon, the gut microbes switch to ferment dietary and mucin-derived proteins. While saccharolysis by the gut microbiota gives rise to SCFA that are beneficial for the host and a source of energy for the colonocytes, proteolysis can lead to the accumulation of compounds such as BCFA, phenols, indoles, ammonium (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) that are generally considered detrimental for health. Moreover, hydrogen (H2) with carbon dioxide (CO2) or formate can be converted into methane (CH4) by methanogenic archaea, which are also linked to slower transit time. In addition, the production and circulation of secondary bile acids and hydrolysis of host-derived glucuronides excreted via bile can also be affected by alterations in gut transit time.381\n\nFC in patients would accompany mental disorders like anxiety and varying severity of depression.382 Evidence from recent neuroimaging studies illustrated that FC patients had significant structural and functional alterations in brain regions that are involved in visceral sensorimotor, cognitive control, and emotional regulation,383−389 thereby confirming its reclassification as DGBI. Among these altered brain regions in FC patients is the anterior insula, which is generally regarded as a critical node for its essential role in processing interoceptive signals, modulating visceral activities, and regulating emotions and cognitions.383,385,389−391\n\nStress and Stress Resilience\n\nChronic stress is rapidly becoming a global societal challenge. Stress constitutes a state of threatened homeostasis triggered by intrinsic or extrinsic adverse forces (stressors) and is counteracted by an intricate repertoire of physiological and behavioral responses aiming to maintain/reestablish the optimal body equilibrium (eustasis). Stress is a nonspecific response of the body to any demand imposed upon it that disrupts the body homeostasis and manifests with symptoms such as anxiety, depression, or even headache.392 Stress can be hardly avoided in the present-day, modern, competitive life. Although eustress is important for people’s rapid reaction to threats, chronic stress is associated with detrimental effects on physical health and adverse implications on the immune, neuroendocrine, and central nervous systems.392\n\nAcute stress activates the HPA axis, thereby resulting in an immediate release of cortisol. This response prepares the individual to defend against or escape from a threat. After the threat subsides, normal homeostasis should return. However, when that fails to occur, chronic activation of the stress response results in dysregulation of the HPA axis and an increased risk of subsequent diseases/disorders.320 It also acts on the gut to increase the release of proinflammatory mediators, which leads to increased gut permeability.393 Repeated exposure to stress can initiate a vicious cycle of low-grade inflammation and negatively impacts the intestinal barrier and immune signaling within the gut.394,395\n\nA link between stress and the abundance of lactobacilli in mice was discovered for the first time more than 40 years ago.396 Several preclinical studies have documented that stress impacts gut microbial composition in a number of different hosts using different stress models ranging from water avoidance to maternal separation, heat, and acoustic stress and overcrowding.320 These results have shown clinical relevance and translated into human studies, thereby showing the influence of stress on gut microbiota and gut microbiota on stress modulation through different stressors, such as surgical intervention, academic examination, or military training, among others.397−400\n\nMaternal stress during pregnancy displays a distinct fecal microbiota profile, which has generational consequences. The maternal microbiota influences offspring microbiota and correlates with hyper-reactivity of the HPA axis, together with other perinatal factors, as a key determinant of offspring outcomes. These findings have been confirmed in humans in a population-based study whereby infants born to mothers with high cumulative stress during pregnancy exhibited an aberrant microbial composition.401\n\nThe effects of early life stress on the microbiota may extend to adulthood.49 It is, therefore, plausible that changes in the gut microbiota due to stress at least partially mediate the onset of stress-related depressive or anxious episodes. Correlational studies have shown that fecal microbiota composition in individuals with anxiety or depression differs from that in healthy controls.202,402,403 Women with a higher fecal Prevotella abundance experienced increased negative emotional response to viewing negative images and lower brain activity in the hippocampus than those with a higher Bacteroides abundance.404\n\nStress resilience is the ability to experience stressful events without the development of chronic elevated stress (psychological and/or biological) and associated changes in emotional behavior.405,406 Stress susceptibility is related to psychological factors, such as passive coping skills and high emotional reactivity, but is also associated with biological factors such as hypo- or hyper-responsiveness of the stress response system, sex hormones, central and peripheral immune activation, and glucocorticoid resistance.407 The gut microbiome is a biological factor that is emerging as a possible"
