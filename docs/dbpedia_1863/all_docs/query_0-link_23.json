        "text": "1.\n\nSweet Cheetah (feat. Oceanside85) 02:56\n\nLooks like you’re hunting me More and more I can feel your breath I hope that you’re sincere With what you want ’Cause my heart can’t Take another shred I’m feeling fine I’ve lost my mind Waiting for your love I cannot sleep ’Cause you keep waking me up Looks like you won’t give up Until I’m yours, oh my God You just need to get a grip Are you gonna love me now Don’t you play with my heart Don’t you leave me in the cold I’m feeling fine I’ve lost my mind Waiting for your love No more lies No more wasting time I’ll recover my heart No more wasted nights It’s time to say goodbye Love\n\n2.\n\nCat's Eye (feat. Swayze) 03:09\n\nYou think that I’m a hunter I think that you're right I’ve been searching for a lover And I’m hunting you tonight I can’t forget the image The thought of you excites Caught in the cat’s eye The cat’s eye, the cat’s eye There’s a killer in the city There’s a killer in the night Take cover, take shelter Just be prepared for fight or flight Keep your wits about you ’Cause it'll make you think Make you question everything You thought you knew was real Hey girl well I wanted to let you know You don't have to put on a show I see you and I feel you No matter if you try to change my mind Or if you run and hide You're caught in the cat’s eye You think that I’m a hunter I think that you're right I’ve been searching for a lover And I’m hunting you tonight I can’t forget the image The thought of you excites Caught in the cat’s eye The cat’s eye, the cat’s eye The hunt is on now Ready set go Try to spread those wings and fly But you just can’t no more I’m in your head now Inside your brain You can spend all night Just trying to shake me But I think I’ll stay You think that I’m a hunter I think that you’re right I’ve been searching for a lover And I’m hunting you tonight I can’t forget the image The thought of you excites Caught in the cat’s eye The cat’s eye, the cat’s eye\n\n3.\n\nMaybe I’m just... Just like you Your cold, cold eyes They cut right through I can’t approach When you’re in a mood I want to come close Baby it’s true You’ve got your claws out baby I can’t get anywhere near Can’t get anywhere I put it all out baby Why can’t you come here Maybe I’m kitten myself Maybe it’s not meant to be I know that your love Might draw blood Maybe...you’re just like me You’ve got your claws out baby I can’t get anywhere near Can’t get near I put it all out baby Why can’t you come here\n\n4.\n\nSurrender in your eyes Lulls me into submission I’ve let myself be compromised By your acts of contrition Your next conquest arrives Always a fresh start Running through your nine lives With an unbroken heart Your next victim arrives For you there’s no consequences Running through your nine lives Adrenaline floods your senses Strutting your stuff all over town Arching your back ready to get down Hunting your prey in the streets Leaving a trail of crumpled sheets Your next conquest arrives Always a fresh start Running through your nine lives With an unbroken heart Your next victim arrives For you there’s no consequences Running through your nine lives Adrenaline floods your senses You pay no mind To the havoc that you wreak Pleasure is all you seek Your next conquest arrives Always a fresh start Running through your nine lives With an unbroken heart Your next victim arrives For you there’s no consequences Running through your nine lives Adrenaline floods your senses\n\n5.\n\nIf I had my way with you I’d sit around and binge ya Sweep you off your feet Like a sexy lil ninja Waiting for my time to pounce Love the game of cat and mouse When I get you in my mouth I swear you won’t be wanting out Si tu me donne la lape Je serai ton chat fidele Hey look what the cat dragged in I’ll treat you like my plaything Come on let the games begin I know just what I’m chasing I get hungry when I prowl And guess who I’m prowlin’ now My paws, my jaws all over you Until you’re breathless in my jowls I’ve got you backed against the wall I want it now, I want it all Our hearts combine, this is our time Give yourself up to the night The purrfect crime feels so divine You’re purrfect when you’re mine I came out of nowhere I’ve been watching from the shadows I bet you could use some love You’re looking kinda sad though Lick you up and spit you out Show you what I’m all about Squeeze me Please me Don’t go easy Kitty cat girl soundin’ cheesy I’ve got you backed against the wall I want it now, I want it all Our hearts combine, this is our time Give yourself up to the night The purrfect crime feels so divine You’re purrfect when you’re mine Our hearts combine, this is our time It’s purrfect when you’re mine It’s purrfect So purrfect You’re purrfect when you’re mine\n\n6.\n\nOne push over the edge Is all it takes me Til I laugh until your dead It satiates me Like a bird with a severed head Meow ha-ha meow If to-meow-ow never comes My last ball of yarn has come undone So open up the cans and just pray For the next nine lives You’re my human slave Bite, scratch One bad trip on catnip Now I’m depraved With one flick of my whisker Now you’re enslaved I’m the pick of the litter And I’ve gone astray You’re my piece of human clay\n\n7.\n\nDoom Puma Killah ninja Doom Puma Killah ninja I’m Doom Puma The killah ninja Fast like lightning Night vision hunting Stealth mode frightening You won’t hear me coming As your heart is thumping There’s no escaping My claws go slashing My fangs go biting Your flesh goes ripping Your blood starts spurting In the darkness I’ll be watching I’m Doom Puma And I’m here to kill ya Doom Puma Killah ninja Doom Puma Killah ninja I’ve come to change the game My fangs are here to drain In your eyes Kitty just wants to play Don’t you mistake me For cute and cuddly I’m dark and deadly Save yourself From the misery Dangerous as can be I’m evil times three Don’t domesticate me I will eat you either way My claws go slashing My fangs go biting Your flesh goes ripping Your blood starts spurting I’ve come to change the game My fangs are here to drain In your eyes Kitty’s just here to play I am Doom Puma\n\n8.\n\nThis beast of prey was born to kill His body sleek ripped muscle and steel This jungle king stalks the night 200 pounds all brawn and might This big bad cat rules the night He’s on the prowl Search and destroy Can’t deny his instincts Obligate carnivore His body’s tense He sees his mark He’s a big bad cat with a fatal bite A big bad cat with a fatal bite Stalk and ambush He’s on the prowl Search and destroy Can’t deny his instincts He’s a carnivore His body’s tense He sees his mark This big bad cat rules the night They never see him coming Unless he wants to be found Never see him coming When he’s low to the ground They never see him coming Never see him They never see him coming Til he’s already pounced\n\n9.\n\nCats in space...the Space Catets Cats in space...the Space Catets Leaving the Earth in catapods Taking off for the stars Saving planets from evil rats Patrolling the moon to Mars Cats in space...the Space Catets Cats in space...the Space Catets Space Catets Space Catets Purring through the multiverse In crochet fluffy boots Preventing space catastrophe In golden furball suits\n\n10."
