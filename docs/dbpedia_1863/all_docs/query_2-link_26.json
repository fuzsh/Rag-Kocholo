        "text": "Signal Void Releases New Single “Road To Nowhere”\n\nThe epic instrumental storytelling of Signal Void reaches new heights on the brand new track “Road to Nowhere.” The artist’s powerful bass hits mingle easily with evocative melodies to fill a cinematic atmosphere on one of the most exciting and unpredictable tracks from the artist to date.\n\n“Road To Nowhere” is out now on all platforms from independent synthwave label FiXT Neon.\n\nStream/Purchase “Road To Nowhere”:\n\nhttps://fanlink.to/_rtn\n\nFollow/Support Signal Void\n\nSoundcloud\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nSpotify\n\nTwitter\n\nBandcamp\n\nSignal Void And King Protea Team Up Once Again On “Pull Me Like Gravity”\n\nFollowing the tremendous fan response to Signal Void’s first collaboration with King Protea on “Find You,” the artists have chosen to team up once again on “Pull Me Like Gravity.” Signal Void’s bass-heavy style provides the perfect counterpoint to King Protea’s beautiful and subtly haunting vocal delivery for a blend of creative styles unlike anything else in synthwave.\n\nStream/Purchase “Pull Me Like Gravity”:\n\nhttps://fanlink.to/pulllikegravity\n\nFollow/Support Signal Void\n\nSoundcloud\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nSpotify\n\nTwitter\n\nBandcamp\n\nSignal Void and DEADLIFE combine their visions of a dystopian future in “Turncoat”\n\nTwo of the most talented cyberpunk synthwave creators working today combine their visions of a dystopian future for a brilliant new creation on “Turncoat.” Signal Void’s unmistakable melodic sensibilities glide easily across DEADLIFE’s rhythmic grit for a piece that brings out the character of each artist with remarkable synergy. “Turncoat” is a must-hear creation for fans of synthwave’s dark side and it’s out now on all major platforms from independent synthwave label FiXT Neon.\n\nSig hit me up and wanted to do a track, he showed me what he had already and I added some bits on inspired by what he had already wrote. It grew organically from there, and with it being on Sig’s next record I thought I’d just add bits here and there, such as a few counter melodies and some of the bridge. Sig suggested the name “Turncoat” which I thought was pretty dope considering how things are at the moment, pretty on the mark.\n\n– Deadlife\n\nI’ve been a fan of DEADLIFE’s productions for some time now, and I was recently inspired to reach out to him with the prospect of potentially working on a single together. From the very beginning I knew I wanted to create a uniquely emotive cyberpunk record that told a tense story of betrayal and deception, and his creative input on this production was incredibly influential in capturing the authenticity of the story I wanted to tell.\n\n– Signal Void\n\nStream/Purchase “Turncoat”:\n\nhttps://fanlink.to/turncoat\n\nFollow/Support Signal Void\n\nSoundcloud\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nSpotify\n\nTwitter\n\nBandcamp\n\nSignal Void’s unmistakable style of atmospheric cyberpunk music reaches epic proportions on “Limbo”\n\nSignal Void’s unmistakable style of atmospheric cyberpunk music reaches epic proportions on “Limbo.” Soaring synth tones flow along a dense, methodical beat while Casey Desmond delivers a hauntingly beautiful singing effort. When the track reaches its cinematic outro, the subtle melodies and Desmond’s poignant performance combine for a stunning section likely to send chills down your spine.\n\nWhen I was approached by FiXT-Neon to work with Signal Void I was very inspired by the imagery that his skillful production conjures. His ability to harness emotion made me a true believer. For me, the track musically invokes deep yearning and paints a picture of the balancing act we perform as humans in order to achieve our true potential. It’s a delicate, beautiful dance. I added ethereal vocals to convey the mysterious sadness and simultaneously uplift the listener with a raw, dynamic sentiment.”\n\n– Casey Desmond\n\n“Limbo” maintains the intensity and immersive world-building of Signal Void’s collaboration with King Protea on “Find You,” and it points the way toward the artist’s next full-length album. “Limbo” is out now on all major platforms from independent synthwave label FiXT Neon.\n\nStream/Purchase “Limbo”:\n\nhttps://fanlink.to/_limbo\n\nFollow/Support Signal Void\n\nSoundcloud\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nSpotify\n\nTwitter\n\nBandcamp\n\nSignal Void “Find You” (feat. King Protea)\n\nSimultaneously tragic and beautiful, Signal Void and King Protea’s “Find You” is a cyberpunk synthwave creation like you’ve never heard before. This epic track tells a heartbreaking tale rooted in Signal Void’s world of the dystopian retro-future, balancing dark and heavy instrumentation with King Protea’s silvery singing performance. The result is an attractively melodic offering underscored by persistent intensity.\n\n“Find You” is the first new creation from Signal Void following the artist’s sleeper hit debut album, This Liminal Reality, and it’s the lead-off single for FiXT Neon: Altered, the upcoming compilation of cyberpunk music from independent synthwave record label FiXT Neon.\n\n“I know fans have been patiently waiting to hear the next chapter in the Signal Void story, so it’s incredibly exciting for me to finally be able to share this record with everyone. At its heart, Find You is a tragic tale between estranged lovers in a dystopian future where the lines between reality and cyberspace are blurring, so I definitely wanted to capture some of the inherent power struggles in those themes within the music itself. Coupled with King Protea’s stunning vocal performance, this record is my attempt to plant a flag of my own within the synthwave genres & give the audience a glimpse into the future of Signal Void and the direction I’m heading with this new album!\n\n– Signal Void\n\n“Find You” is a mysterious dive into the mind of Signal Void’s lover — both her confidence and insecurities. This was an exciting exploration of that dialogue and what kind of emotions she might be feeling, while at the same time trying to protect the one she cares about most. It’s dramatic and relatable at the same time.”\n\n– King Protea\n\nStream/Purchase “Find You”:\n\nhttps://fanlink.to/_findyou\n\nFollow/Support Signal Void\n\nSoundcloud\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nSpotify\n\nTwitter\n\nBandcamp\n\nSignal Void Releases ‘This Liminal Reality’\n\nWhat is the Signal Void? This is the question underpinning the gorgeously dark environments that fill Signal Void’s debut full-length album, This Liminal Reality. With unparalleled atmosphere and some of the most serenely dark melodies ever to hit the synthwave genre, Signal Void crafts an immersive audio world of the distant future. The musical contrast of light and dark on the album perfectly represents the narrative underlying This Liminal Reality, a tale of two worlds and the space where our reality and cyber-reality become one.\n\nThis Liminal Reality collects Signal Void’s impressive series of original singles and sets the stage for a powerful future for the artist with new music to follow in early 2020. This Liminal Reality is the jumping-on point for one of the most exciting and well-realized cyberpunk synthwave projects to date, and the full album is available on all platforms now through independent synthwave label FiXT Neon.\n\nStream/Purchase This Liminal Reality:\n\nhttps://fanlink.to/tlr\n\nFollow/Support Signal Void\n\nSoundcloud\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nSpotify\n\nTwitter\n\nBandcamp\n\nSignal Void brings his Liminal Reality to FiXT Neon!\n\nBy embracing the soul of ‘80s synth music and film scores and translating those ideas into a forward-thinking approach to synthwave, Canadian artist Signal Void is redefining possibilities for cyberpunk music. The artist’s unparalleled creative style and lush production techniques bring the world of his music to life, creating a compelling vision of the retro-future where daily life and cyberspace are intertwined.\n\nThe vision of this world is expressed through Signal Void’s shadowy cinematic pieces, which often lean on heavy rhythm sections and beautiful, cascading melodies. The balance of light and dark in the music reflects the artist’s conceptual interest in the liminal space between the real world and the Net, a cyber-reality that has become corrupted by the mysterious Signal Void.\n\nSignal Void released his first singles in 2018, and after finding a highly receptive audience to the music, connected with independent synthwave record label FiXT Neon for a multi-album deal. The label repackaged and re-released Signal Void’s early singles into a complete album, This Liminal Reality, at the close of 2019. The recording sets the stage for a powerful future from this visionary creator, and fans can look forward to brand new singles from Signal Void in early 2020.\n\nStream/Purchase: https://fanlink.to/tlr\n\nFollow/Support Signal Void\n\nSoundcloud\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nSpotify\n\nTwitter\n\nBandcamp"
