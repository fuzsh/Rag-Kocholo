She is a multi-award winning podcast host/producer who builds streaming platforms which center & celebrate BIPOC & QTPOC creatives. Anna was inducted into the Chicago LGBTQ Hall of Fame because of her commitment to the queer community. Anna is determined to ride media into its next era by utilizing digital media streams to tell the stories and play the music that deserves to be heard.\n\nLearn more about her work here.\n\nFamily, Happy Pride üåà This month is all about celebrating our beautiful LGBTQ+ community. We deserve to smile, laugh, and be filled with unapologetic joy. This is our time! And what better way to celebrate than by amplifying our voices? Storytelling gives us a window into someone else‚Äôs humanity and ours is under attack. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm excited to share some dope podcasts I believe do this incredibly well. I think you might just find yourself adding a few into your rotation. Enjoy!\n\nQueer News\n\nI produce and host this podcast because LGBTQ folks and our comrades deserve a brave space to hear news that centers them. I keep it relevant and I keep it short. Creating this podcast has brought me a lot of joy and I hope it can do the same for you.\n\nSecond Sunday\n\nTelling the stories of Black Queer folks who grew up in the Black Christian church has never been done this way. I‚Äôm so proud of the stories we get to tell. Being a part of this podcast is a real honor.\n\nBlack HIV in the South: How Did We Get Here?\n\nHIV is still very real and still very present in Black and Brown communities. I wanted to share that and amplify the hope that exists because of the medical advances of today. This is the first podcast we released on The Qube and was brought to life by a 100% Black woman team.\n\nBad Queers\n\nShana and Kris are just awesome and I love the Bad Queer opinion segment the most. Def get into this.\n\nTransLash Podcast with Imara Jones\n\nImara Jones is a beacon of light and her work deserves to be binged.\n\nQueue Points\n\nJay Ray & DJ Sir Daniel are the perfect tandem. Their collective musical knowledge makes this podcast a must listen.\n\nThe Spark\n\nDJ Tricey Trice has her pulse on women‚Äôs basketball and the LA Sparks in particular. If you want to stay up on The Sparks and the WNBA this is a great podcast to get into it.\n\nI‚Äôm Feeling Queer Today!\n\nFirst person storytelling is my jam and I love hearing from young queer folks about their lived experiences. I promise, you will learn something new.\n\nThe Queer Family Podcast\n\nStarting a family is hard and starting a queer family is even harder. Jaimie does a masterful job bringing queer family stories to the front.\n\nAfroQueer\n\nThis is a pod where you will hear stories you have never heard before. If that interests you definitely hit play and share it with a friend."
