        "text": "THREE WOMEN: VISIONS IN CONTRAST\n\nLinn Bae, Lindsey Fyfe, & Nan Runde\n\nAugust 28-October 9, 2015\n\nNAN RUNDE\n\nA glimmer of light in darkness, random masses coalescing into pattern, a ragged shoreline between the familiar and the formless: this is the territory Nan Runde explores in her drawings and paintings. With a visual vocabulary derived from the natural world, she strives to embody the way of nature in her own creative process, letting images evolve from within. Her work challenges viewers to enter that process—to search for what is only barely discernible.\n\nLINDSEY FYFE\n\nLindsey Fyfe’s drawings, paintings, and photo-based collages bring viewers from coast to coast, continent to continent, and back to Connecticut, from the perspective of both a local and a tourist. Highlighted works present an imaginative spin on landscape photography, through which she investigates returning to her home state, the land of unchanging habits. Hand-carved photographs of incongruent imagery combine lyrically across horizons. Each work is a meticulously crafted world that hovers between real and implausible.\n\nLINN BAE\n\nLinn Bae doesn't want her paintings to look calculated or intellectual, but rather raw and emotional. She paints with a palette knife, subconsciously, without thinking. Her goal is to create a spontaneous canvas with an immediate intense feeling. The texture and the color show her emotion. If she's lucky, the result is a good painting and a satisfying feeling. If nothing good is created, maybe tomorrow. Another day, another hope.\n\nA WALK DOWN PARK STREET\n\nJack McConnell\n\nApril 13-May 20, 2012\n\nARTIST'S STATEMENT\n\nA Walk Down Park Street represents a collection of Jack McConnell’s photographs that capture the essence of Park Street, through Frog Hollow and Parkville from Main to Prospect. It’s the exuberant commercial spine of a working class neighborhood representing 20 Latino cultures from the Caribbean, Central and South America.\n\nEach image in this exhibit represents a fraction of a second, a simple slice of life in the midst of a cultural melting pot. For 400 years, Hartford has welcomed immigrants, from Dutch adventurers who sailed up the Connecticut River in 1624, to the French, Italian, Irish, German and Scandinavians who worked in Victorian-era factories, building Pratt & Whitney machines, Colt firearms, Columbia bicycles, Remington typewriters, and Pope electric cars. The Latino population today comes for the same reason—freedom and a better life for their families.\n\nMcConnell uses 400mm and 500mm lenses to isolate details of the neighborhood, capturing the vibrant Caribbean color palette of the streetscape---filigreed iron railings, painted porch furbelows, and rambunctious after-dark activity seen through storefront windows. His digital Canon 5D enables him to focus at low light levels, shooting lampposts, traffic and nightlife.\n\nAs he concentrates on street portraits, McConnell finds residents generous about sharing their energy, letting him see their self-confidence, peace, and worries. They seem to say, “Here I am, I exist, I’m OK, or I’m not OK.” In one photo a young woman throws her hands into the air in a celebratory gesture, yelling, “Hey, Mr. Photographer, take my picture.”\n\nTHE GOOD EARTH\n\nJoy Floyd\n\nOctober 7-November 13, 2011\n\nARTIST'S STATEMENT\n\nJoseph Cornell said that collage is the work that comes from “the sacred search”; the seeking and finding of used and abandoned materials.\n\nFor example, during a recent visit with her daughter in California, Ms. Floyd found small plastic bags of Japanese kimono scraps for sale. Those cloth bits, along with odd crochet pieces, a Chinese doily, and the corner of a discarded paint drop cloth became a collage. From something old came something new. This transformation is her work.\n\nMs. Floyd’s process begins with the search, opening her eyes to see the beauty of discarded fabrics, papers, rusted metal, scraps of wood, even buttons and feathers that can be rescued and restored. Then follows the mysterious puzzle of fitting the parts together, using a background of foam core or plywood instead of canvas, and paste and polymer rather than paint.\n\nThe materials themselves are Ms. Floyd’s inspiration. She does not aim to make a realistic “picture”. Her goal is to honor the materials with a new identity while retaining the elements of their old life.\n\nCreating the collage with its bits and pieces, textures, and colors, is Ms. Floyd’s joy.\n\nAs a working artist who lived in Hartford for over 20 years, Floyd continues to work in her studio in the Arbor Art Center in Hartford.\n\nBOYS AND THEIR TOYS\n\nNancy Masters\n\nApril 8-May 22, 2011\n\nARTIST'S STATEMENT\n\nBoys and their Toys represents the realistic automotive oil paintings created by artist Nancy Masters.\n\nMasters studied with a trompe l’oeil artist for many years and that experience is reflected in the photo-realism of her paintings. There is an abstract quality to some of her work where she only paints a portion of the car or motorcycle. The artist wants the viewer’s mind to finish the painting. Masters enjoys the challenge of taking the flat surface of the canvas and turning it into something dimensional, where the cars appear to drive off the canvas with realism and bold color.\n\nCreating chrome is one of Masters’ specialties. She creates it through multiple coats of black and white paint that are blended together. Other areas of chrome are created by painting in reflections of surrounding objects. Notice the self portrait of the artist squatting down taking of a picture of the ‘1956 Chevy,’ as well as the reflection of the car parked next to it.\n\nBecause automotive painting is so demanding and needs to be accurate, Masters always has a non-automotive painting on her easel. She particularly likes painting flowers from her garden with the same bold colors as her automotive paintings. Masters’ portfolio also includes paintings of animals and landscapes.\n\nBIRTH/PLACE\n\nAdrienne Gale\n\nFebruary 4-March 20, 2011\n\nARTIST'S STATEMENT\n\nBirth/Place is an installation that examines the idea of home as a place into which we can be born and also a place that we can create for ourselves. Ms. Gale uses her art to demonstrate the choices we have (or may not have) about where those homes are located, what they are made of, or who they include.\n\nInitially drawn to eggshells for their visual appeal, Ms. Gale found them to be a natural vehicle for addressing choices. The artist uses roots, trees and seeds incorporated in a variety of media including printmaking, drawing, handmade paper and book arts to illustrate the many connections in the world that inspire her creations.\n\nMs. Gale made a specific choice to move back to Hartford where she was born to be with her family who have chosen to stay in the City and contribute to the community. Not all people who live in Hartford had the luxury of making such a choice; all too frequently, homes are created or settled on due to a lack of options. In defending her choice, Ms. Gale set out to create art that will encourage those who live in and visit Hartford to think about the people who live here and why they live in this City, and to also consider their own choices.\n\nTHE ADMIRATION SERIES\n\nKyle Andrew Phillips\n\nOctober 15, 2010-January 7, 2011\n\nARTIST'S STATEMENT\n\nThe Admiration Series is a body of work that pays homage to painters that Mr. Phillips deeply respects. He makes a point to look past bias to recognize passion and genuine depth in an artist’s work and frame of mind. From Piet Mondrian’s pre-abstracts to Wayne Thiebaud’s colorful pop art, the artists that Mr. Phillips has selected span many artistic movements and represent varying aesthetic styles.\n\nA celebration of vibrantly shimmering colors, all tightly woven together with layers of energetic brushstrokes, Mr. Phillips has taken great care not to create contrived paintings, but rather work that is fun and insightful.\n\nWhile oil on panel makes up the majority of work, Mr. Phillips branches out to canvas, linen and also watercolor and acrylic on paper. This was done intentionally so each painting was started with a fresh approach.\n\nLiving and working in the City of Hartford has played a significant role in the construction of the series. The landscapes can be seen around the City and the portraits depict people who live and work here. Mr. Phillips strongly believes that art is a result of one’s experience and that to create work with substance an artist must draw direct inspiration from his/her life.\n\nJOURNEY (2): A RENEWED CONSCIOUSNESS\n\nStanwyck Cromwell\n\nNovember 6, 2009-January 15, 2010\n\nARTIST'S STATEMENT\n\nAlthough I have spent most of my adult life in the United States, I consider myself a Guyanese born contemporary visual artist and art educator. My memories of Guyana are rich and abundant particularly the physical and aesthetic differences between the cultures of Guyana and the United States.\n\nA visual kaleidoscope from my native land is referenced in my work. These references serve as a visual footnote to my art making, by allowing me a rich palette of sights to draw from. The yellows of lemons and bananas are different, so are the oranges found in sunsets versus the hue of tangerines. Saturated colors, patterns, and textures reveal themselves in my work, whether paintings, drawings or mixed media.\n\nTo say that I am a painter, collagist, or any specific type of artist, would only limit my abilities and potential. The creative energy that inspires my work has renewed my consciousness in ways that are hard to articulate but evident in my work. Journey (2): A Renewed Consciousness displays a gradual transition from traditional to a more contemporary form of visual expression where reality and myth intersect and sometimes merge. This transition has allowed me to create visual hybrids by incorporating both natural and man-made materials into my art. Most of the symbols and materials are used metaphorically and vary in interpretation based on the context in which they are applied.\n\nThe arrangement and rearrangement of objects in my work is like an aesthetic chess game - one movement affects the other. This process allows me to stretch my imagination by dismantling cultural stereotypes and dogmas. My Guyanese heritage, including cultural and religious practices, is the foundation for my Guyanese-American experiences. Therefore my work is a total embodiment of all my experiences as a human being. I hope that you find my work visually and spiritually stimulating.\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\n\nStanwyck Cromwell is a second-generation Guyanese-born artist currently living and working in the United States. He graduated from the former British Guiana Trust High School, with high honors in art and other foreign languages. Soon after graduation he worked at Guyana Lithographic Company as a graphic artist, with noted Guyanese artist, Angold Thompson. In addition, he also studied with his cousin and mentor, Maurice Jacobs, a noted Guyanese artist.\n\nIn 1970, he migrated to the United States, in pursuit of an art career. He earned a Bachelors of Arts degree in Applied Arts, at Oak State College and also a Master of Fine Arts degree in painting from the University of Hartford. His memories of Guyana are rich and abundant, but the most striking are the physical and aesthetic distances of the Caribbean and the United States. Mr. Cromwell paints in series, incorporating a variety of themes that expresses, his ethnic, social and cultural experiences both in Guyana and the United States.\n\nSaturated colors, patterns and textures show themselves in his collages, sculptures, paintings, and drawings. The vibrancy of his colors is convincing evidence of his rich and illustrious Caribbean heritage. Despite his strong Caribbean roots, his work is non-traditional. Instead, he uses a combination of figurative, abstract, and surrealistic art forms. Mr. Cromwell uses symbols in his work as metaphors. The most frequently used are the black-eye-pea, seashell, and fish-like faces. In addition he uses repeated images as overlays in his compositions, to created depth and imaginary mindscapes. His work is very energetic and commands the attention of the viewer.\n\nRETRO:WORKS\n\nChet Kempczynski\n\nMay 1-August 31, 2009\n\nARTIST'S STATEMENT\n\nMy paintings are executed from observation and memory. I set up the objects (stones, marbles and sand) in a shadow box and light them through a small opening. This becomes the stage for the composition of all the rock and agate paintings. Early study of tromp l’oeiltechnique with Master painter Ken Davies helped me to produce some of my most dramatic hyper-realist works. Each painting could take up to a few months to complete.\n\nWhile living in Spain during the winter of 1980 – 1981, I started experimenting with the monotype process. I would paint on a glass plate in reverse and when the surface was covered with wet paint, I would place sheet of paper over the design, apply pressure to the back, and pull it off creating a unique print. This enabled me to finish a piece ala prima. On return to the USA, the images became larger and larger, up to 10 feet long and four feet in height.\n\nI always practiced plein air painting, which is evident in the recent watercolor/gouache paintings that were done in the South of France and the shores of New England. I have eliminated all objects and strictly concentrated on the space above and below the horizon line with color and content.\n\nMy new series of large oils on canvas and monotypes was initially inspired by the post 9/11 color code alerts circulating in the media. These color signals represented a visual language intended to convey a security level to the public.\n\nAlthough much of my work is referential, my focus has now changed; I moved to color field painting both from an art historical perspective, and from the viewpoint of an artist conveying an interpretation of current events. My search for pure color is not only related to my passion for abstraction, but also a representation of the meaning and usage of color in contemporary society.\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\n\nChet was born and raised in Hartford, CT. He attended Hartford Public Schools and received his art education at Paier College of Art and the Hartford Art School at the University of Hartford. He has taught painting, water color and monotype at Loomis – Chaffee School since 2000.\n\nChet is a painter’s painter, mastering a wide variety of techniques. His work ranges from small portrait canvases to seven by seven foot oil paintings.\n\nWhen a fire destroyed his studio, a portion of his home, and 121 pieces of his work in 1997, as he was preparing for a show at Westwood Gallery in New York, where he has been represented for decades, the arts community rallied to his aid and he was able not only to honor his commitments to shows previously planned, but create what some say is his strongest work.\n\nAlthough his roots run deep in Connecticut, his work shows little trace of regionalism. The exception to that is his spectacular series of oil paintings of the city as seen from his third floor studio in his home on Washington Street. His worldwide travels, especially his months-long trips to Spain, have influenced his work as much as the shores of Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York.\n\nColor and light are a recurring theme in his paintings, large and small. His color is hot, rich and emphatic, and light rebounds from every surface.\n\nHe has shown widely in both solo and group exhibitions in New England and New York, as well as in Toulon, France, Paris, France and Cadaques, Spain, and Hyeres, France. He is the recipient of a Pollack-Krasner Foundation Grant."
