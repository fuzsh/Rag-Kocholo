        "text": "The objective of RBC’s summer reading program is to provide our students with meaningful, relevant selections that will help foster their critical reading skills and vocabulary while hopefully sparking a greater curiosity and appreciation for literature. In the sections where choices are provided, students (and their parents) should choose a book that suits their individual level of comfort and ability.\n\nAll summer reading assessments, including any specific instructions, will be provided by students’ English teachers within the first weeks of school.\n\nStudents are not required to annotate the books they read over the summer, though they may find that annotating helps them comprehend and keep track of what they are reading, as well as prepare for the assessments when they return to school. For guidance on how to annotate a book, please click on the link labeled “Annotating a Book.”\n\nIf you should have any questions over the summer, please email Ms. Beth Boylan, English Department Chairperson, at bboylan@redbankcatholic.com (she will be on a summer schedule but will respond to any questions as soon as possible).\n\nFull PDF list for each grade\n\nTips for annotation\n\nHonors English I\n\nRequired Books:\n\nSalt to the Sea – Ruta Sepetys\n\nChoose 1 of the Following:\n\nWe Were Liars – E.
