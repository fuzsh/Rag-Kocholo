        "text": "When people search for information about investing in the music industry, about investing in artists, and when they are looking for information on 360 deals, my blog posts often appear within the search results. As a consequence, at least once a month, someone calls me about investing in the music industry or about investing in artists. Although this post speaks to artists, I plan to use this post and the accompanying comments as a tool to make my conversations on this topic more efficient.\n\nOne Billion True Fans - It Won’t Happen.\n\nEven with overlap, at one thousand fans per artist, one million artists cannot acquire one billion true fans. All the music lovers in the world are never going to accept and process billions of artist-initiated emails, status updates and text messages. Pushy self-promotion doesn’t scale. If everyone is doing it, nobody is going to do it effectively; the same applies to fundraising; fans are going to tune these messages out. Collectively, artists and their managers are running the risk of appearing like financial planners at a cookout…occasionally invited, but often avoided. Moreover, the sum of all the effort and capital invested in music promotion generates such a negative return, that it makes investing heavily in time travel machines appear outright attractive. Perhaps it’s time to consider jumping off of, or avoiding altogether, the self-promotion bandwagon.\n\nIn this post I am going to argue that given the career economics of the music industry, a Promotionless To Popular Strategy (theory) is a strategy that artists are compelled to pursue prior to attempting to climb the mass-exposure / fan-acquisition pyramid.\n\nFirst, some history: back in the day, to record an album in a top residential recording studio with the help of a gold-record producer and his tuned team of unkempt engineers and star-struck interns, it was commonplace to spend a small fortune to make an album. To afford a major-label dream team and a big-studio experience, you had to have an illegal drug business, a shaky investor, or a record deal. The ticket price to recording in an expensive studio on somebody else’s dime was to have long, long lines outside and crazed fans at all of your live shows. If you ask me, you should set the same bar for yourself when it comes to investing in self-promotion. Unless lines are forming out the door, down the street and around the corner, consider improving your songs and your live performances prior to doing anything else. Given the economics of the industry and what I am about to describe below, artists really don’t have many other options.\n\nA weak online pulse equals an anemic act.\n\nFor the first time in history, if fans are impressed, you should be able to find, analyze and measure fan-generated content that features you on YouTube, on Flickr, within an expanding list of Google search results, within numerous Twitter tweets, on blogs, on file sharing networks, on music social networks, and all over Facebook. If fans are not rating, mentioning and featuring you or your songs, if the pulse of your online buzz is weak, then the very real possibility exists that your songs and/or your performances are just not good enough yet. (I do acknowledge that the behavior exhibited by fans will vary (today) from genre to genre.)\n\nThe online landscape is far different today than it was twenty-four months ago. As I stated in my last post, 500,000,000 music fans have recently acquired the unprecedented capacity to capture, edit, annotate and promote for you. The creative and promotional work done by fans will be, or already is, powerful enough to build a solid fanbase upon.\n\nFan-based ad creation and social promotion is already occurring across a broad spectrum of consumer products. There isn’t a smart consumer-facing company today that is not motivating ‘fans’ (crowds) to assist in message creation and/or promotion. Given the 24/7 news cycle, fierce competition and shrinking margins, reliance upon ‘fans’ is more than a passing fad, it’s becoming necessary to compete and survive within numerous industries.\n\nThe Promotionless To Popular Strategy (theory)\n\nTheoretically speaking, if you are brave (promotion consultants will say foolish) and remarkable, you don’t really have do anything today but continually improve and consistently (weekly or monthly) show up at the same place(s) and play. Fans can almost do everything else. Give them permission and a way to capture a clean recording of your live performances, and there’s not much you can do…that fans can’t do faster, wider and better, and this includes motivating new fans (prospects) to attend your shows.\n\nEven if you are semi-famous, operating at the lowest cost structure possible has never been more important.\n\nThe economics of a Promotionless To Popular Strategy\n\nThe cost to create studio-quality recordings has plummeted; the cost to distribute music is negligible; music is nearly free; and now the cost of promotion (including effort) is rapidly approaching zero. Going forward, you will practice and improve; you will be paid for live performances; you will sell physical merchandise and digital stuff; the need for middlemen will continue to fall off; fans will play an integral part in your rise (more so than ever); and the rewards for reaching the apex of the industry will continue to be substantial. A Promotionless To Popular Strategy is really the only promotion strategy that any unknown artist can economically justify now.\n\nWhen to conclude a Promotionless To Popular Strategy\n\nThere’s a point where it makes strategic sense to invest in capitalizing on the momentum that fans have created for you; this timing would also coincide with the point where you have probably become…remarkable. I would argue that this milestone (milestone one) has been reached when the amount of online touch points, mentions and impressions has climbed into the high hundreds of thousands to low millions. This is when it makes (more) sense to seek mass-exposure placements (radio, television, film, ads, large festivals etc.); prior to this point, you are just one of the many millions (soon to be tens of millions) seeking fame and fortune via the submit-to-the-lottery-and-pray model, combined with the who-you-know-and-take-out-to-dinner method. Good luck.\n\nMoving forward, once an artist has obtained 50,000,000 impressions (multiply listeners by spins to get impressions), it makes sense to me to invest in a support organization and the offline/online effort to capitalize on 1) your efforts to date, 2) the momentum fans have already generated, and 3) the risk mitigation that has resulted from mass-exposure placement(s). Obtaining anything less than 50,000,000 impressions diminishes your organization’s chances at achieving sustainable profits.\n\nNote: there are plenty of people, including labels that gamble on investing in artists prior to achieving either of the milestones just covered above. However, artist investing is a business that nearly has a 100% failure rate. My advice is to never invest in expensive album recording projects, and to never invest in paid advertising, paid placement, or paid promotion until an artist has achieved milestone one.\n\nBuilding a team for a Promotionless To Popular Strategy\n\nDifferent times call for new thinking when it comes to ringing up obligations (paying cash or sharing percentages) to the people that work with you. Think about the YouTube videos that fans will create; the compelling images people will post on Facebook; and generally about what will be mentioned on the Internet. Strategies such as running a great party (consider a professional event planner), ensuring that your live sound quality is dialed in (use an experienced sound engineer), and seeking proven professionals to work on a single song, are more important than traditional management, Internet interns, and radio promotion consultants. You can’t afford (time and money) to keep attempting to promote yourself forward. Surround yourself with people that can help you create an unforgettable song, stage an arresting party, and deliver a stunning performance; these are the things will make your online pulse strong.\n\nPromotionless To Popular does not equate to doing nothing! Make it easy for fans to promote you, but don’t get worked up about investing time and money into promoting yourself.\n\nQuestion: My live shows are packed and I am really good, but there’s very little measurable, fan-generated activity. How come?\n\nResponse: You are just not good enough, your niche is paper thin, or you have confined yourself to a sparsely populated area. The Internet is packed with competing alternatives. Try harder and/or move to a bigger city.\n\nQuestion: I have songs that would be great on a movie soundtrack. Do I really need all those touch points, mentions and impressions to obtain a placement?\n\nResponse: If I had a dime for every time an artist said they have great soundtrack songs…I would be rich. No, perhaps you don’t need all those touch points and impressions, but they prove that your song is remarkable, and more and more song and talent buyers are using ‘remarkable’ filters to find songs and artists. Good luck.\n\nQuestion: I can name artists that are doing it differently, and artists that are building businesses on top of aggressive promotion. What do you say to that?\n\nResponse: There are exceptions to everything. It seems like some random artist dreams up a press-worthy promotion stunt every month. Good luck with that. Aggressive promotion costs time and money. Are these promotion-heavy artists truly generating consistent, family-supporting incomes?\n\nQuestion: Does fan-generated content/messages have the same reach as artist-generated content/messages?\n\nResponse: Consider the sea of friend-networks on Facebook, the ocean of hourly tweets on Twitter, billions of text/picture messages a day, fan videos, and remixes. For any random artist, which entity generates more views, clicks, rates, mentions and re-mentions - the artist, or the sum total of his or her fans?\n\nQuestion: What about the 1,000 True Fans model?\n\nResponse: Depending upon how you execute it (passively or aggressively), the 1,000 True Fans model is a subset of this model. Nobody wants to artificially stop at 1,000 fans. Keep going. If you are really starting to ‘hear’ your online buzz, leaning on 1,000 true fans to propagate your message is a great next step.\n\nQuestion: Fan-generated content is not eye-popping enough.\n\nResponse: Fan-generated content is compelling enough to drive traffic and to create a measurable buzz. Watch the example video below. You be the judge. This home video (notice the sound quality) was good enough for me (a fan) to promote it. (LuxDeluxe on MySpace)\n\nAbout Bruce Warila and on Twitter\n\nI agree with a lot of this post but disagree with a lot also.\n\nFirst of all I maintain you have to think like a major if you want people to respond to you like a major.\n\nThis means singles and radio singles at that. If the benchmark is getting a radio hit and then a download hit then you have really 2 strategies that you have to invest in.\n\n1. Record a great single.\n\n2. Promote the great single.\n\nUpon these 2 everything else is built.\n\nWe have all invested in albums and recording lots of songs, including me, BUT the game has changed and now it's about returning to the singles model and then releasing a hit single before you think about an album. This sharpens focus and you're a lot more critical about your record but more important than that, it makes you look professional too.\n\nIf you revolve around a single every other month and you send it out to radio, and stick it on Youtube then you can build the rest.\n\nTHis is where i disagree with this article. You make the assumption that without any promotion people will hear about you ? This is just not true. Without any promotion NO ONE will hear about you.\n\nMy advice is simple and this comes out of years of hard work, research etc.\n\nThe most effective way to build a buzz is to run 2 things simultaneously.\n\nRadio and Google.\n\nSend your release to radio, if you need to form a collective to do so then so be it.\n\nDon't waste your money on PR companies and pluggers. They will give you less than sticking it in the post and mailing it to the producer of the show will. Tom Robinson has an excellent post on this. Radio is a long shot but they need to have your record so that when you do step 2 and it works they can act.\n\nStep to is upload it on Youtube complete with a cover and BUY some Youtube ads. The benchmark is about 1,000. If out of 1,000 views you don't get any tracktion chances are your single is not going to be a hit. You can up it to 10,000 which should cost you at least $100.\n\nYou could try using Jango as well though I haven't used it yet. With 10,000 bought Youtube views @ 1c a click you will know if you have any comments if you have a hit.\n\nOf course, you should use Google to advertise your page and the video should play on your own site and you can monetise it and plough back the money you make into more promotion or cut your losses and record something new.\n\nOnline marketing is easy and affordable and cheap and you should use it to full effect.\n\nok DG... here we go.. i really don't want to sound like an a hole here but let's talk realism. of the over 100,000 records put out in any type of manifestation last year -- how many do you think sold over 5k?... well, not even 2k of them.\n\nOf course it is very close to impossible for a band starting out...so what do you propose - a noose or a gun?\n\ngun is faster... depending on where you shoot, i suggest the throat pointing up to the brain...\n\nRather than giving up, a COMBINATION of Bruce's suggestion to get out and PLAY GREAT LIVE SHOWS and Kehinde's template of RELEASE SINGLES and promote thru GOOGLE, YOUTUBE and RADIO seems like a winner to me.\n\nso many amazing artists play great live shows and no one will ever know about them... release singles? right... what radio station is going to play them w/out a pro indy (whio the pd has known for years) calling the pd at the exact same moment they do every week? promote on google? right, everything and everyone is on google -- how the hell is a band no one knows about going to mysteriously rise out of the billions of other bands on google. same w youtube. radio, as mentioned before - no unknown band will ever get spins on a radio station that matters.\n\nIf you REALLY have a great live show, people will come and spread the word - if they aren't - well you just DON'T have a great live show. PERIOD. Time to go write and rehearse more - possibly hundeds or even thousands more hours.\n\nreally? well unless you've been living under a rock the past 3 years, you'd know that the single hardest member of any band's team to secure these days is a good agent... even the crap agents are not only coveted -- but their rosters are way overloaded -- thereby making them even more crap as an agent.\n\nAnd if your single doesn't gain traction from Google ads AND social networking push thru everyone you can get it to AND even college level radio isn't biting - well - time to go write and rehearse more - possoibly hundreds or even thousands more hours.\n\nok...\n\nOh wait - I'm repeating myself...possibly from utter astonishment and frustration that at least 90% of artists are deluded and think their material/show is ready for prime time, when in fact most are somewher between sucking and average.\n\ndisagree w you on this too.... try 99.9999999%\n\nThe wonderful thing about today's technology is that it really WILL show where you stand - of course, if USED EFFECTIVELY (which Bruce and Kehinde point out well - just that I think they are both right and a mix of both is the most powerful).\n\nsorry -- mix all you want... did you load the gun yet?\n\nOle Jack could have been talking to most artists when he shot with... \"You can't handle the truth!!\"\n\nagreed...\n\nJuly 24 | Dg.\n\nPs. Not being ready isn't anything to be ashamed of...\n\nok\n\nwhen John Hammond \"discovered\" Count Basie and put them on tour they fizzled - they were rockin' KC but just didn't get the crowds MOVING everywhere else. So did they give up?\n\nno...\n\nNo - Hammond got them booked as resident band at a Harlem club (Famous Door?), and they soent every day rehearsing all afternoon there, then playing all night...for SIX MONTHS.\n\nok...\n\nTHEN they went back on tour - and this time they KILLED. Now remember, this was BASIE and his freaking alllstar lineup of already insanely talented players - and that's what it took.\n\ndg -- dude (presuming you are a guy and not a chick) let me shake you out of your uneducated and overly numb state. you are talking about a record biz that doesn't exist anymore. a record biz that supported their bands through 4, 5, 6 records before they developed a fan base. a record biz where the bands were fat and had lots of facial hair. dg, ol' buddy ol' pal -- those days went out when the blow and hookers that were carted into the radio stations went the way of vinyl...\n\nThe more things change, the more they stay the same...for sure in music. Deal with it.\n\nwrong again dg... the more things change -- the more they change. deal with it...\n\n@ ahh\n\nHmm...if your'e coming from a genaral troll perspective, i give you credit for some game (even laughed out loud a couple times), and it seems unlikely you actually believe all that - if so it's surprising that you would even bother reading music biz blogs.\n\nBut if you do walk your talk, then let me just say this:\n\nIf an artist is literally REMARKABLE, to use Bruce's exact term, that means people will, uh, REMARK about them. And we all know word of mouth is the most powerful form of promotion possible (if you don't agree with that at least, just ask the movie studios that spend tens of millions promoting a movie that goes nowhere after the first weekend).\n\nAnd you say \"many amazing artists have great live shows\", but then \"99.9%\" of artists are between sucking and average (and I do agree I was too generous at 90%). That seems to be contradictory - where are you seeing the 1/10th of a percent unless you travel nonstop?\n\nPersonally, I almost NEVER experience what I consider to be a great live show, generally defined as making the vast majority of the audience either:\n\n1. not only dance - but DANCE TIL THEY SWEAT. (as in, running makeup is a real issue for the woman and everyone's clothes are literally soaked thru)\n\nOR\n\n2. either actually cries or has to strenously fight back tears (y'know being macho and all)\n\nOR\n\n3. vents their pent-up frustration/anger/rage thru screaming, fist-pumping, mosh pit-flinging or other such expression\n\nOR\n\n4. feel so inspired they can't sleep afterward thinking of all they want to now accomplish\n\nOR\n\n5. get so aroused they go home (if they get that far), and fuck all night\n\nOR\n\n6. hit sensory overload from some other emotion\n\nOR\n\nnot sure it's possible but - all of the above in one show.\n\nIf you don't think music can elicit those responses - then YOU have been the one living under a rock (your whole life).\n\nAnd if a live show IS that remarkable, Bruce's suggestion that you could essentially start with ONE PERSON and do no other promotion is probably even possible.\n\nWHY? Because you are talking about things changing EXTERNALLY. I am talking about HUMAN NATURE, which at its core doesn't change at all - good thing, too, since that means we really don't have to reach for the gun...just create shows/parties that accomplish the above - and same goes for releasing singles.\n\nThat sets the bar high - right where it SHOULD BE - and most artists should accept they just ain't cuttin' it anywhere near that level, so shouldn't be surprised or upset they aren't making it professionally - and stop the fucking complaining.\n\nIf you don't get that I have nothing else to say to you, ahh, and while I wouldn't then suggest a gun, but rather some treatment...shock to the frontal lobes, perhaps, it's faster. And definitely leaving music to those who want to lift and inspire."
