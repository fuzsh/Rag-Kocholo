        "text": "Alec Snow is a multidisciplinary artist working in sculpture, drawing, collage, and sound. Their work is concerned with the material and aesthetic properties of rural environments and the way these properties act as structures or strictures that support and inhibit those who move around and through them. Alec graduated from Parsons School of Design with a BFA in Fine Arts. He currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York, and Southwick, Massachusetts.\n\nAlex Ingle is an artist from North Georgia. Her work is informed by personal, social, and regional narratives. In 2014, she received her BFA with a concentration in Ceramics and Printmaking from the University of West Georgia; in 2017, she received her MFA in Ceramics from East Carolina University. She taught as a professor at her Georgia alma mater and recently worked as an operations manager and glaze technician at New York Stoneware, a ceramic production studio located in the Bronx, New York.
