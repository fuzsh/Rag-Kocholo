        "text": "“So many companies prey on hopeful musicians for a quick cash grab. MusicGorilla is not that—they are the real deal. They provide musicians of all types opportunities that you couldn’t find anywhere else. Thanks to them, I can now add events like SXSW to my resumé, and I’ve made connections with other likeminded musicians across the country. They are the best at what they do and care about musicians!”\n\nEraina Joy – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Music Gorilla gave us the incredible opportunity to showcase ourselves to music industry professionals, it was through them that we secured a record deal with Eleven Seven and we couldn’t be any more grateful\n\nNevrlands – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Thanks so much for accepting me into your showcase, I’m excited to play!”\n\nRachel Platten – Basic Member – Signed to Columbia Records\n\n“I like Music Gorilla because it offers me an outlet for my music and gives me the chance to present my wares to various companies seeking unusual music. I look forward to working more with Music Gorilla.”\n\nElectrobuddha – Basic Artist Member\n\n“I’ve been so impressed with the opportunities that are available and pop up on MusicGorilla.com – these guys run a tight ship as well! Really easy to work with, quick to respond, a nice breath of fresh air in the music industry. I was incredibly stoked to find out I was a finalist for a full album recording opportunity at an exclusive, invite-only studio in Florida. Thanks for everything, MusicGorilla team!”\n\nLance Tingey – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Shout out and massive thank you to MusicGorilla.com! With their help, Georgetown, TX, alt rockers Tough On Fridays (http://www.toughonfridays.com) scored a terrific corporate gig in San Antonio first week in May! So appreciative! “\n\nTough On Fridays – Pro Artist Members\n\n“A great service for an up and coming independent Pop / Rock / Punk group like us here at Marnee Mayhem. We all work full time so promoting the band and getting our music out there is usually the last thing we get around to as spare time is reserved for rehearsing and jamming out new tracks. Having Music Gorilla supporting us opens new pathways where our songs can be accessed by labels and other providers in the music industry (Film, TV Productions) as well as the opportunity to be connected with brands and events all of which help push our Art and cause forward!”\n\nMarnee Mayhem – Basic Artist Members\n\n“What an amazing experience playing my first showcase for Music Gorilla was. Met some of the best people and musicians I’ve ever met in my life. The night was truly magical and it’s an experience I’ll never forget.”\n\nCharlie Millikin – Basic Artist Member\n\n“It is a pleasure working with Music Gorilla. [They’re] always very responsive to my questions, and I believe their screening process for my entries is excellent.\n\nI’m not always sure about which of my entries are going to be on target, but the ones they end up forwarding do seem to be a good fit for the ask.\n\nThe most recent submission I’m excited about is my environmental song “Do What You Do” – which Music Gorilla forwarded for a short film about the environment.”\n\n– Keith Rayburn – Pro Artist Member\n\n“I just wanted to reach out and personally thank you once again for including myself and my band in the showcase at Pianos! We were very humbled by that, and it means a whole lot. And it was nice to finally meet you in person too!”\n\nCharles Laurita and The Mischief – Basic Artist Member\n\n“I am thoroughly enjoying the Music Gorilla experience and can only describe the buzz and excitement when a new opportunity is posted, as being like a kid on Christmas morning! The fact that the postings are only done as and when a relevant opportunity arises, means that you know these are genuine briefs that you DO have a genuine chance with!”\n\nRobert Quigley – Pro Artist Member\n\n“It’s hard to know who to trust in the music business. Music Gorilla has put me in front of industry and new audiences as well as provided many opportunities. They’re also good people.”\n\nMark Newman – Pro Artist Member\n\n“The MusicGorilla.com Showcase has always been a big highlight for my band, with rockin crowds right in the heart of SXSW. Alexia and Lawrence are both badasses and I’m honored to have been a part of what they do!”\n\nJamie Kent – Basic Artist Member\n\n“Big thanks to Music Gorilla for having us play at one of their A&R showcases. We got to play a great show in a professional and friendly atmosphere and have one on one conversations with some major talent scouts. Doing so directly resulted in the opportunity to make a record with multi-platinum producer Matt Squire. We couldn’t have done it without Music Gorilla and it was exactly what 3PM needed!”\n\n3PM – Basic Artist Members\n\n“Our MusicGorilla showcase during the 2016 SXSW Fest was unbelievable! Every year gets better and MusicGorilla is always at the top of their game. Thank you for showing us such an amazing time!”\n\nBristol To Memory – Basic Artist Members\n\n“Music Gorilla’s SXSW showcase in Austin is hands down the best showcase we’ve been a part of 2 years in a row now. Not only is the venue the best on 6th st, but we’ve received amazing opportunities each time. Last year we were written about in Vibe Magazine as “One of the Top 7 Acts You Need To Know Right Now” and this year we were offered to tour in China! Also, Alexia and Lawrence who run it are completely awesome to work with. We highly recommend it.”\n\nj and the 9s – Basic Artist Members\n\n“From SXSW to A&R showcases, Music Gorilla has a unique mom-and-pop foundation that directly supports hard working DIY artists all over the [world]. They’ve certainly been a prominent tool for us when connecting with industry professionals.”\n\nRyan Sloan of Wyland – Basic Artist Members\n\n“Music Gorilla provides opportunity. That’s their mission. That’s their purpose. They do so because they have the same passion in music as the artists they represent. Alexia and Lawrence are industry pros who have spent a lot of time and effort building relationships in the business so they can open doors for their clients. We have thoroughly enjoyed showcasing at Music Gorilla Live 2015 & 2016 in Austin, and not only was the night a blast, but we performed in front of Radio Station Program Directors who are now interested in playing our music.”\n\nWhite Label Analog – Basic Artist Members\n\n“Thanks to Music Gorilla, “Back 2 Roots” coming from first double Martino CD was chosen as the soundtrack for party scenes in the film produced by Gemelli Film Inc. in N.Y. USA!”\n\n– Martino – Basic Artist Member\n\n“We had a really great time playing the Music Gorilla show at Burnside’s. The gig was right in the middle of all the musical madness and had a great vibe. Thank you so much for this opportunity to be a part of the fun down in Austin, Texas. We are already planning next year’s trip!”\n\nBig Little Lions – Basic Artist Members\n\n“I performed for Music Gorilla’s SXSW 2016 Showcase at Burnside’s Tavern, and I have to say it was one of my favorite shows that I did this year in Austin! There was a great positive energy about the place and about Music Gorilla, the sound guy was incredibly helpful and great to work with, and the audience was really responsive and fun. Thanks so much to the team that put this great event together; looking forward to doing it again soon!”\n\nShani Rose – Basic Member\n\n“Music Gorilla is one of our favorite partners in promoting our music and having the right ears listening to it. Our showcase during SXSW 2015 was preceded and followed by great bands and the whole gig was one of the most successful ones we’ve played that week. We look forward to more collaboration with Music Gorilla, thank you guys!”\n\nPiqued Jacks – Basic Artist Members\n\n“Our band, Lost In Atlantis, were approached by Music Gorilla for the opportunity to perform at a NYC showcase for Columbia Records. We were surprised to see how many fans believed in us to get us all the way to and from NYC. Once we arrived to the famous Bitter End, we were greeted by a friendly personnel from MG. We received amazing feedback from Columbia Records, we’re looking forward on letting our relationship grow with them. MG has opened up a lot of doors! They’re a company that’s truly for the artist!”\n\nLost In Atlantis – Pro Artist Members\n\n“MusicGorilla Showcase was the highlight of our experience during Austin in March. The venue was PACKED, the staff was top notch, and Alexia and Lawrence were the most professional and friendly people we met all week. Most well put together unofficial showcase happening, hands down!”\n\nLovebettie – Pro Artist Member\n\n“First of all, I’m a classical composer, and for me and my kind of music it’s really hard to find good opportunities around the world, so, I would like to thank Music Gorilla for the professional level of opportunities they present. I think that Music Gorilla it’s a serious service that keeps musician in mind.”\n\nFabrizio Zilli – Basic Artist Member\n\n“Falling Through April had no idea what to expect from the Music Gorilla A&R showcase but we were blown away. After our performance we had the opportunity to meet directly with Columbia Records A&R. We were really pleased that he was so detailed and thorough with his immediate feedback. Most bands struggle every day trying to get an opportunity to perform their music in front of even the smallest of labels…Music Gorilla put us in the lap of a Major label. Music Gorilla obviously takes a lot of pride in what they do because the quality of what they offer is priceless. We would perform EVERY Music Gorilla showcase if possible! Thank you!”\n\nFalling Through April – Pro Artist Members\n\n“Our SXSW MusicGorilla Showcase was really incredible. There was a big crowd at a really kick ass venue.

We greatly appreciate the people at Music Gorilla for recognizing this and helping to spread the work of independent artists. We’re looking forward to fostering a lasting and successful relationship.”\n\nWe Were Astronauts – Basic Artist Members\n\n“You were very helpful and the service was wonderful. Thank you. I would recommend you guys to other filmmakers. Awesome.”\n\nJake Smith – Filmmaker – Industry Member\n\n“MusicGorilla has been a consistently helpful tool for me for over a year now. I’ll never miss a Music Gorilla showcase as I know I’m always going to be seeing some top notch talent every time. Two thumbs up.”\n\nJim Edmunds – RCA Music Group A&R Coordinator – Industry Member\n\n“I’ve been pleasantly surprised and very impressed by the wealth of information and viable career opportunities that MusicGorilla makes accessible to new artists. It was a lot of fun to participate in the Austin showcase this past March. Showcasing various bands in such a short period of time is quite a feat, but the MG team were efficient, calm, and helpful…and there was a great crowd in attendance! I’m really looking forward to performing for an A&R rep from A&M/Octone at The Bitter End in NYC tomorrow night and I’m grateful to MusicGorilla for the chance to do so!”\n\nLara Johnston – Basic Artist Member\n\n“We were happy to play the show at Burnside’s during SXSW. We did a non-stop set which finished with an audience requested encore! We were literally done and the sound guy left the table to unplug us from the stage but the crowd raised their voice asking for one more song! Sound guy went back to the table for us to play one more. It was awesome!\n\nIt was a lot of fun for us and we appreciate the opportunity to play for you guys.”\n\nAlphabetics – Basic Artist Members\n\n“Thank You for letting Light the Rocket be a part of the Music Gorilla Showcase during SXSW. It is tough for independent bands to get heard, and Music Gorilla helped us reach new fans and industry contacts that are tough to get as an independent band. Music Gorilla has a great ear for talent and works with the best of upcoming bands. We are honored to be working with such a great group!”\n\nLight The Rocket – Basic Artist Members\n\n“Thank you so much for your support and inviting me to be a part of your Austin showcase #goodtimes!!”\n\nBean – Basic Artist Member\n\n“Our Music Gorilla showcase was by far our best experience at SXSW. The staff and support was excellent and the acts on the bill with us were absolutely awesome to watch and work with. 10/10 would recommend working with Music Gorilla again!“\n\nNo Blitz – Basic Artist Members\n\n“First off my name is Illinoisboy from N.Chicago and I would like to thank Music Gorilla for the professional level of opportunities they present. Two of my songs recently have been signed to a T.V./movie licensing company and I’m ecstatic!!! That’s great motivation for a indie artist/songwriter like me. Thanks again.”\n\nIllinoisboy – Basic Artist Member\n\n“We want to thank MusicGorilla…for affording opportunities for unsigned artists to gain valuable exposure and constructive criticism with the aim towards helping bands to succeed. We are excited to have been selected for this once in a lifetime opportunity. We are original artists who have been striving and working hard to break into the music industry. The fact that we can meet an A&R from A&M Octone Records, perform our music and get written feedback on our performance makes this truly an outstanding experience. This feedback will help us grow and give us the needed direction to accomplish our goals.”\n\nThe Como Bros – Pro Artist Members\n\n“The Great SOCIO love love loves you! Our showcase with you was quite possibly our most memorable show in Austin that week. The lead up was thorough and professional, the staff and sound engineer handled the mass amounts of bands incredibly well, our sound was great, the fans were amped, the drinks were flowing. The result of such a perfect storm of awesomeness: We rocked the house. Thanks for working so hard doing what you do and creating opportunities like these for artists from all over the country. Can’t wait till next year!”\n\nThe Great SOCIO – Basic Artist Member\n\n“I’ve been using Music Gorilla on and off for the last five or six years to help connect my songs with those in the industry who are able to make use of them. This site, unlike many I’ve tried, does for the artist exactly what it says it will. They’re open, transparent and their pitch listings tell the artist everything he or she needs to know in relation to whether or not their songs are suitable for that listing. Music Gorilla – well worth the investment.\n\nDavid McMullen – Constellation J – Basic Artis Member\n\n“…You guys have outstanding opportunities. Indie artists should def use the site it is one of the best in the biz. Thank you so much again and I hope you have a blessed day!!!”\n\nREM N’ NISCE – Pro Artist Members\n\n“Any artists, such as Telling on Trixie, that values exposure and growth, will find an invaluable partner in Music Gorilla. We gained a ton fans from our showcase as well as constructive, thoughtful, written feedback from the industry representative. Because MusicGorilla has a solid reputation for carefully selecting artists, the people on the other side of the business value and respect them. As a consequence, industry people treat MusicGorilla artists as a step above the rest.”\n\nDerek Nicoletto – Telling On Trixie – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Thank you so much for having us, Flux Minor, to play in the showcase for Virgin Records during SXSW. We appreciate all the hard work it takes to make the showcase a success that it was. This showcase for Virgin Records was the best and most professional we have attended. From the sound to the promotions and being greeted with a hug, we felt right at home, which made it easier for us to perform at our highest level! Thanks again!”\n\nMatt – Flux Minor – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Unlike many independent music sites that “claim” to put you in touch with industry reps, MusicGorilla, they’re legit! They really looked out for us when NBC needed a hip-hop video to play in an episode of “Friday Night Lights”. Music Gorilla suggested we submit our video and VERY QUICKLY it was approved by NBC. That opportunity came out of nowhere and we thank MusicGorilla for puttin’ that together. Good job!”\n\nKevin Walters – 857 – Pro Artist Member\n\n“MG has made a huge difference in our band’s career. We were invited to play MusicGorilla’s Live Major Label Showcase. It was there that we connected with a producer/A&R rep from Capital Records. Several months later we’re excited to announce the release of our new CD, produced, recorded and mixed by Jimmy Landry! Many doors have opened. Thanks for taking a chance on a bunch of 16 year olds! You guys are amazing!”\n\nNed, Steve, Collin & Koz – Comic Book Heroes – Pro Artist Members\n\n“Thank you so much for accepting Zoe Ann and her band to play at the MusicGorilla showcase. Your staff was extremely professional and very informative!\n\nThey had a blast and really appreciated the opportunity!”\n\nDara Easley Manager for Zoe Ann – Basic Artist Member\n\n“GCN wants to express gratitude, to Music Gorilla for giving us this Amazing opportunity. Allowing us to showcase for the SXSW crowd at Burnside’s Tavern in Austin Texas will never be forgotten. On behalf of GCN, I would like to personally thank Music Gorilla and our hosts for an exceptional job. It was a great showcase and magnificent opportunity to play our music on such a grand scale. GCN is a fast, rising Hip/Hop, R&B group from Dallas TX that is rapidly becoming the who’s who of independent music. Most of all we hope we represented Music Gorilla well.”\n\nGCN – Pro Artist Members\n\n“For those of you out there who think that 57 is too old to get anything done in the music world. Wow! Music Gorilla is a great place to find opportunities. Just a few weeks ago, I receive an inquiry, sent off my CD and received a contract in only a few days for my music to appear on up to 5 new kids Christian DVDs. It has also gotten me the option on a film with Sony… I am very elated to have found Music Gorilla, thank you.”\n\nLes LaMotte – Pro Artist Member\n\n“I was not only approached by a member of Sony Music Group at the showcase, but have been speaking with him on a regular basis now over two months. He is very interested in the band, and he saw us because of Music Gorilla. Are you promised a deal??? No, but will doors open….Yes!!”\n\nAaron – Backlit Revolver – Pro Artist Member\n\n“MG is awesome! I’ve had several inquiries from Industry reps since joining, and recently was featured on a syndicated radio program for Indie Country musicians. Two of my songs were also selected for placement on their current compilation CD, which will soon begin receiving air-play at those same stations. That kind of exposure is phenomenal to an Indie writer like myself, and it is totally due to my Music Gorilla membership. Thank you MG for making this happen for me!!”\n\nAnne Abercrombie – Pro Artist Member\n\n“We (Grown Up Avenger Stuff) played 9 shows during SXSW 2013 and we loved every one of them. The one that stands out as the best, most fun, most valuable was the Music Gorilla showcase. While popular press coverage spreads the sad news that SXSW is not really an indie focused event anymore, Music Gorilla is truly keeping the indie spirit alive and healthy. We are so glad they are and we are deeply thankful and honored to have been included this year.”\n\nGrown Up Avenger Stuff – Basic Artist Member\n\n“As an agent and manager, my first priority is to get my bands signed up for Music Gorilla Artist Membership! I don’t know what I would do without Alexia and Lawrence and shudder to think of it!”\n\nKelly Sherrill – Artist Manager – The Sherrill Agency\n\n“MusicGorilla.com makes sure that each artist’s showcase is a priority. Alexia and Larry care about their artists and it definitely shows; we’ll always come back to work with MG!”\n\nJune Divided – Basic Artist Member\n\n“Just wanted to say thanks again for having me at the SXSW Music Gorilla showcase! I had a blast and it was so great getting to meet you in person and hang with all my Texan alumni.”\n\nCaroline Brooks – Basic Artist Member\n\n“Just wanted to say thanks once again for putting Jeff into the showcase. You did a great job – I was there for a few of the other acts and really enjoyed it!”\n\nAK – Manager for Jeff Campbell – Basic Artist Member\n\n“New Sweden had the opportunity to not only showcase for a Columbia Records representative, but also receive priceless feedback directly from the source. We honestly weren’t sure what to expect as we hit the road to NYC, but we certainly weren’t disappointed. We hope we have the chance to work with Music Gorilla in the near future and would highly recommend them to any band looking to further their career!”\n\nNew Sweden – Basic Artist Member\n\n“Just wanted to give a big thanks for putting The Noise FM on the MusicGorilla 2013 Austin showcase. We had a blast playing at Burnside’s Tavern and the show went over really well. We were pumped to be a part of MusicGorilla again this year and look forward to SXSW 2014. Thanks again!”\n\nThe Noise FM – Basic Artist Member\n\n“Preachers Son joined Music Gorilla, slightly skeptical we must admit, there are so many sites out there promising opportunities, however within a couple of months Music Gorilla delivered, one of our songs “Heaven For the Moment” was chosen to feature in the film “A Guy Called Dad”. Since the beginning, Alexia from Music Gorilla has been so helpful and enthusiastic; we would recommend anyone with doubts to cast them aside!!!”\n\nSmooches from the Preachers Son team – Pro Artist Members\n\n“I cannot say enough good things about Musicgorilla.com. My film wouldn’t be the same without it. Their artists are many and varied and most of all, talented! I was able to not only score most of my movie, but to really drive scenes home thanks to these amazing artists. If you’re a filmmaker (big or small budget) you can’t afford not to try out musicgorilla. It’s not just immediate gratification, it’s guaranteed satisfaction.”\n\nKacey Arnold – Producer/Director “A Guy Called Dad”\n\n“Music Gorilla has helped our band tremendously, just the whole thing is a great way to be heard. Just the fact that the great people At Music Gorilla have really put something together to help bands, and not just for labels but tv shows, Movies, video games you name it. Recently our band did a a clip of our music and a few of our band members even get to be on TV, for a show called Friday Night Lights and ever since then our crowd has grown.”\n\nDonna Mea – Pro Artist Member\n\n“My first live solo performance was the Industry Showcase at Fontana’s in New York City. The bands and artists that performed were amazing and it was an honor to be a part of the lineup, especially as an electronic artist.

Many thanks to Music Gorilla and Lawrence Erlichman for the opportunity!”\n\nJulie Weiss Pro Artist Member\n\n“Music Gorilla rocks. They gave us the opportunity to play in a foreign country for the first time ever. They sorted out everything for us so all we had to do was turn up and play. We truly owe them lots and I hope we can achieve what we want through them!! Keep rocking!”\n\nWayne – Void – Pro Artist Member\n\n“I am excited to have found Music Gorilla! I am a new songwriter and it is difficult to know how to get my work out there and heard. I found Music Gorilla and immediately signed up for pro membership. I was excited (and somewhat skeptical) but happy I was actually able to submit my songs to producers. I submitted and a few weeks later actually got a request to send The Band Perry’s producer the MP3 for one of my songs! This is the best venue I have found to help me move forward with my goals.“\n\nTracie Hanson – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Working with Music Gorilla was a blast and their showcase was a great networking opportunity.

A special shout-out to the staff at musicgorilla.com for providing a simple, honest and reputable service to us working musicians.”\n\nMathew Stegner – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Just wanted to say thanks.

I feel it is designed for the serious Artist, Band, or Songwriter who is looking to reach the A&R Reps in the Music Industry who are looking for great songs and talented Artists. I have had several songs considered for both Movies and other Famous Artists to consider recording. Music Gorilla has given our Band the opportunity to develop it’s Identity and to Discover where we’re going.”\n\nSunset and THE SPACE PIRATES – Pro Artist Member\n\n“We just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to play at the showcase in Austin.

So, I can’t recommend the site enough, they certainly bring in the opportunities and don’t hang about!

Awesome!”\n\nJohanna Stahley – Pro Artist Member\n\n“In this Business they say “it’s not how good you are, it’s who you know” Well the people from MusicGorilla.com is who “you” should know.

For those of us who are actively making money off of our music, this really is a treasure. I have already received interest for one of my songs through MG, and I know more are on the horizon. If you believe in the songs you write, why not send them in? You really have nothing to lose and EVERYTHING to gain by sending out a simple email!”\n\nDennis Fallon – Pro Artist Member\n\n“As a manager for national recording artist Shelley Laine, I have tremendous appreciation for resources that promote the Independent Artist’s career. MG gives the artist access to opportunities that would otherwise not exist. Recently one of Shelley’s tracks was selected for a film. As a result of that she is getting significant national exposure. That would not have been possible without MG. Thanks for being there for the Indies!”\n\nSenior Partner, Shelley Laine Management Group, LTD – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Lucid Fly loves Music Gorilla! We heard from a friend that MG was for real, and that we need to check it out. After reading the mission, we instantly got the impression that we wouldn’t be another nameless band who can never be found after the first week (like many other unsigned band sites) Next thing we know, we’re on our way to Austin, TX in the heart of SXSW 2006 on the MG stage at Coyote Ugly. Much props to Lawrence, Alexia and everyone at MG!!”\n\nLucid Fly – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Kudos to [Music Gorilla] for organizing such a super showcase! The event was meticulously planned and the bands were kept on schedule. Thanks for creating the opportunity to showcase for the industry – keep up the great work!!”\n\nCody Coe – Libra’s Rib – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Well I just wanted to drop a line and say thank you for the show. It was awesome, and it went better than I could have hoped. All the labels and other companies who came to see us were very impressed, so hopefully it will lead somewhere. Thank you”\n\nChris Pate – Linus – Pro Artist Member\n\n“There are a lot of companies out there today trying to make money off of independent musicians by offering products and services that promise the world but in the end provide no real value. Music Gorilla is NOT one of those companies. From their professional staff to their unique approach to artist development, Music Gorilla is a class act from top-to-bottom worth every penny.”\n\nBrendan Hall – Sucka Brown – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Finally there is a service that keeps the musician in mind. If you are serious about your music career, you need to have the right people listen to it. Music Gorilla not only does that, but stands behind it.”\n\nRob Rapiti, BLR Entertainment\n\n“With the enormous amount of artists out there vying for attention, it’s great to have Music Gorilla sorting through it all and presenting the cream of the crop. A much valued service.”\n\nAntony Bland, American Recordings (Universal)\n\nIndustry Member\n\n“It’s a tool for NOONER, a resource for “industry people”. If used intelligently, the site could pay for itself…. Musicgorilla.com ROCKS!”\n\nChris Telles – NOONER – Pro Artist Member\n\n“I can’t tell you how happy I am. For the price of what I could buy a CD for a month, I’ve already confirmed three paying gigs strictly from MG. In less than a week on MG we have accomplished things I thought were never possible. This is one company that truly has the musician as the main priority. To date, joining MG has been the BEST move our band has made. Period.”\n\nShawn Fussell and Day 4 – Pro Artist Member\n\n“My name is Jorge Lan and I´m a musician from Mexico. I signed up with music gorilla a few months ago. Shortly after I was contacted by a company named PC Treasures offering me a distribution deal. I signed an agreement with them and some time later started producing some other cds for this company. For me, Music gorilla opened a lot of work opportunities.”\n\nJorge Lan – Pro Artist Member\n\n“…I had been on the site about 3 weeks when I received my first email from a Rep. at a record company. I was blown away! I never expected a response that quickly. I LOVE MG! For all you skeptics out there, Music Gorilla does everything they say they will do. The only thing you have to lose is the record label that never heard your music. Blessings to everyone who takes a chance on MG.”\n\nBridgett Huffhines – Pro Artist Member\n\n“I want to thank you for the opportunity of singing at your showcase.\n\nMy set with Music Gorilla was my favorite performance moment of the whole week.”\n\nRachel Pearl – Basic Artist Member\n\n“Getting the news to play such an amazing showcase was nerve-wracking. When we arrived at the showcase, we were greeted by the Gorilla Crew, the Venue employees, Sound Crew, Other bands and A&R. We have played many shows over the past year and this was the smoothest run and friendliest operation I have seen so far. Thank you to Music Gorilla for all you do for artists.”\n\nJon Masters Lion in The Mane – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Music Gorilla totally rocks… they hooked up one of my artists with a major coffee company a few years ago and it opened a lot of doors for us. Placement opportunities, charts, showcases, they do it all. I recommend Music Gorilla to all bands looking for exposure and a break!”\n\nHal B Selzer, HBS Music Mgt.- Pro Artist Member\n\n“…My band has been heard by A&R approximately a dozen times in 3 months. I have yet to find any other website who can provide the opportunity for you to showcase your music live to the industry. As an artist you get personal attention from Music Gorilla personnel. The service is unbeatable and in my opinion there is no better method out there to promote your band.”\n\nTish Meeks – 3 KISSES – Pro Artist Member\n\n“Hey guys once again thank you for the opportunity to play on your showcase we had a blast and we hope you enjoyed our set!…Thank you again and we hope to hear from you soon…Scoundrels”\n\nSmall Town Scoundrels – Basic Artist Member\n\n“Music Gorilla has been absolutely wonderful for our band. By having us play their New York City showcase at Piano’s, we were able to generate interest from some labels and A&R that are currently waiting on our new recordings. We were also able to get some much needed feedback from Epic Records. Music Gorilla truly helps you figure out where you stand with information you need to get to the next level. Thanks for everything Music Gorilla!!”\n\n2nd Day Crush – Pro Artist Member\n\n“We had a great show. Music Gorilla ran an excellent event. Our backline was solid and so was the front of house sound. That is something you don’t always get at a festival showcase.”\n\nSquint – Basic Artist Member\n\n“We’ve had an awesome time getting to know the team at MusicGorilla. Over the past few years, MusicGorilla has given us a number of great opportunities that have put us in front of music lovers and industry folk alike. We look forward to seeing what other avenues will open in the future with MusicGorilla’s help.\n\nCody Beebe and the Crooks – Basic Artist Member\n\n“Music Gorilla was the best festival I’ve played so far. Great people and pro sound.\n\nThanks for including me this year.”\n\nMark Newman – Basic Artist Member\n\n“We want to thank Lawrence [and Music Gorilla] for inviting us to perform at the showcase and for putting together a great event. We had a blast! Thanks so much.”\n\nThe Assembly Line – Basic Artist Members\n\n“MG.com gave us the opportunity to actually play in front of a real living, breathing A&R rep which is MG living up to its promise of being able to “play it for the labels”. The fact that the CEO’s of the site are always nice, personable and always reachable by phone is a plus, the fact that they will take the time to talk to you for as long as you need them is going above and beyond the call of duty, which most other websites promise, but never deliver. 3 Cheers for MusicGorilla.com!”\n\nOren – Finespun – Artist Member"
