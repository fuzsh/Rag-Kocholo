        "text": "Q: Tell us about a project you worked on you are especially proud of and why. What was your role?\n\nA: Rising from Ashes, a documentary about a cyclist who goes to Rwanda and starts a national cycling team. It was a highly inspirational and moving story, told by Forest Whitaker, and was on a topic very, very close to my heart - cycling.\n\nQ: Is there anyone on SoundBetter you know and would recommend to your clients?\n\nA: Jonathan Warman\n\nQ: What's the biggest misconception about what you do?\n\nA: That I only write advertising music.\n\nQ: What questions do you ask prospective clients?\n\nA: What is the story? What is the time frame? What is the budget for music?\n\nQ: What advice do you have for a customer looking to hire a provider like you?\n\nA: You can find some stock music for your production that may fit fairly well, but remember that anyone in your shoes can also license that same music for something completely different. Why not hire a custom composer to write something that is a direct fit to what you need?\n\nQ: If you were on a desert island and could take just 5 pieces of gear, what would they be?\n\nA: Ukulele (for good feeling vibes), drumset (to wail on and alert passing ships), acoustic guitar (to work on my guitar chops and write songs), double bass (because it's awesome), and a satellite phone (to call someone to get me).\n\nQ: How would you describe your style?\n\nA: Soundtrack composer with indie rock crossover elements.\n\nQ: Which artist would you like to work with and why?\n\nA: Keith White. A sound engineer based in Vancouver who works on nearly all of the mountain bike and extreme sports video content put out by riders and companies.\n\nQ: Can you share one music production tip?\n\nA: Listen on many devices to make sure your mix is even and clean from a $5 USB speaker set to your car to your phone (most importantly nowadays) to your full studio set up.\n\nQ: What's your typical work process?\n\nA: Composing music to a locked Quicktime video, with a brief or temp track of what inspired you, is ideal. However, I can work off a script, some adjectives or moods you'd like to achieve, or solely based on what I feel would work for your production.\n\nQ: What other musicians or music production professionals inspire you?\n\nA: Olafur Arnalds, Johann Johannsson, Thomas Newman, Michael Giacchino, The Jezabels, The National, St. Vincent, Sufjan Stevens, Deadmau5, Living Sacrifice\n\nQ: Describe the most common type of work you do for your clients."
