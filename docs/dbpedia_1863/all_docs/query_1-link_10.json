        "text": "Strange as it seems, it doesn't appear that this ever had its own dedicated thread. At least a search didn't bring anything up.\n\nThe whole concept never appealed to me, as it seemed that record company A&R people must not be doing their jobs to discover new talent. Plus, the shows seems contrived, and AI especially places heavy emphasis on appearance.\n\nAnyhow, there have actually been examples of singers, from these shows, who've done things that at least sounded good on the radio.\n\nKimberly Locke, who wasn't the winner from her season on AI, has a catchy tune, called \"Eighth World Wonder.\"\n\nThe Francophone station on Sirius would often play songs by Annie Villeneuve. Some research was required to discover that she was from a French-Canadian version of one of these shows. Phenomenal talent.\n\nFor English-speaking Canada, there was Carly Rae Jepsen. She did an excellent song, called \"Tug of War\" a few years back, and is currently charting in the U.S. She's got a future in this game.\n\nYet another Canadian, JD Fortune, seemed to fit in with INXS, even if it should've only been a one-shot deal. Somebody else might know, but didn't the Rock Star show only last 3 seasons? Interesting idea and it seemed entertaining, while it lasted.\n\nSo, who's caught your attention from any of these programs?\n\nHaley Reinhart for sure. I'm a little disappointed that her new album doesn't seem to have much along the lines of her wonderful \"What Is And What Should Never Be\" Led Zep cover from A.I., but I love her voice what ever she sings.\n\nThe Muggs from The Next Great American Band--fantastic and beyond anyone famous these days.\n\nMarty Casey the runner-up from RockStar:INXS (glad he didn't win, he was too good for them). His CDs with Lovehammers are very good.\n\nThose are by far the top 3 (not in order) who caught my attention and kept it over time.\n\nIt's a shame, but most of the folks that I enjoy from American Idol usually don't make it past the top 10 or so...\n\nI remember Casey Abrams from a few seasons ago. Very, very, very talented individual who got caught up with \"trying to be different\" for the Idol crowd and was eliminated. His version of \"Georgia On My Mind\" was wonderful vocally and musically. Just him and an upright bass. He also played a melodica which I enjoyed, haha.\n\nCasey James also from Idol a few seasons ago. I know he has a cd out but I haven't given it a listen. He played guitar very well and had a pretty decent voice.\n\nTo gripe a little bit, it's a shame these artists aren't picked up by smaller labels and given the chance to truly shine. Most of them are given songs to sing (with HORRIBLE uber-compressed production) and you never hear from them again, . Maybe in the future someone will change the way that works...\n\nWho knows? It is nice to see some of them do well and achieve success outside of the reality TV world!\n\nI found singer Fantasia Barrino when she sang a duet with Sam Moore on his \"Overnight Sensational\" album, not knowing she had come through the ranks of a TV talent show. Then, I listened to some clips from her albums because I liked her voice but the production style was too hip hop for my liking.\n\nI got to know the name Daniel Powter when I read on allmusic that one of my favourite producers, Mitchell Froom, had worked with him. But \"Bad Day\" is probably the most boring song Froom has ever worked on.\n\nGerman group No Angels who came out of a talent show where said band was cast, recorded a single in the early 00s co-headlined by Mousse T, another of my favourite producers. I got that one but nothing else from the group."
