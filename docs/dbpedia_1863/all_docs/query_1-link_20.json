        "text": "Thursday | 11.02\n\nWhat: Chat Pile w/Agriculture\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Like its self-professed biggest influence Big Black, Chat Pile didn’t really fit in with the underground music scene of its home town of Oklahoma City as a noise rock band that even critics often describe as sludge metal. But its sound even early on captured the ambient anxiety of anyone that’s been paying attention to what’s been happening in America and the world in terms of politics and its failure to adequately address the challenges of the current era like the climate change effects we were told were decades off and the market would come up with something to make the proper adjustments along the way. Except that fascism is on the rise which is the opposite political ideology to take on global challenges and one that seems to think bellicose international policy is the answer in a time of great tensions and unfurling conflicts. Chat Pile’s fracturing guitar rock and soundscaping embodies that milieu with lyrics that make very personal experiences that can seem abstract unless you’re not too distracted to notice. The group’s monumental 2022 debut full length album God’s Country expressed all the aforementioned and even had moments of heartbreaking storytelling that ring as true as the bleakest documentaries as cast in stories about real life with gritty details of being in the working class with no hope for the future and eking out what existence you can with the small shred of dubious joy to be garnered. And yet live Chat Pile’s shows are a joyous catharsis of civilizational anxiety in a way those of few other bands ever are. You also get to see Los Angeles-based, ecstatic black metal band Agriculture which released its own, self-titled, debut full-length. Agriculture is definitely not the typical black metal band and on the record avant-garde musician Patrick Shiroishi contributes saxophone and there is an experimental and improvisational aspect to the songwriting that feels more wide open than a lot of black metal.\n\nFriday | 11.03\n\nWhat: Genesis Owusu w/The Deep Faith\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: If Ghanaian-Australian singer Genesis Owusu is a hip-hop artist he’s equally steeped in post-punk and synth pop. His albums from his 2021 debut album Smiling with No Teeth to his new release Struggler from 2023 are a fusion of the aforementioned and futuristic funk with a masterful command of lyrical flow. Owusu’s eclectic style is both accessible and avant-garde and crafted with a clearly playfully spirit that keeps his songs fresh and inviting. In the live setting Owusu’s commanding presence and theatrical presentation of the music like he’s a late night lounge MC who kicks things up a notch when the song calls for it but never lacking for the smooth dance moves. Cobranoid sounds like it has a leg in both thrash and power metal.\n\nFriday | 11.03\n\nWhat: Lost Relics w/Messiahvore, Cobranoid, Voideater and Burning Sister\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: This show features some of the best sludge metal-oriented bands from Denver but all also have elements of noise rock rendering them a little different than any standard metal act. Lost Relics released its new album Die + Cry + Loathe in June 2023 and a quick listen reveals what should have been obvious all along but there’s a touch of Melvins from the Big Business period in there but with a drive and menace reminiscent of Unsane. Messiahvore has a little more groove and doom psychedelia in its sound but possessed of a seething heaviness as well. Voideater is like if a metalcore band stripped away everything but a stark and colossal sound that feels like it could collapse at any moment under its own heaviness. Burning Sister is a “downer rock trio” that sounds like it used to be a garage rock band that got bored with that and got into trippy music and absorbed the entire Sleep and Captain Beyond catalog and then got a little weird with those influences.\n\nSaturday | 11.04\n\nWhat: Margaret Glaspy w/Cat Clyde\n\nWhen: 6 doors, 9 show\n\nWhere: Ophelia’s Electric Soap Box\n\nWhy: Throughout her prolific career Margaret Glaspy has garnered critical accolades for the immediacy of her poetic songwriting. Her new album 2023’s Echo the Diamond is a consistently refreshing and earnest offering of songs that hits with strong emotional resonance with fairly minimal elements. Singles like “Get Back” and “Act Natural” sound like they could have come out of the early 90s alternative rock era with some wonderfully roughened edges in the guitar work and eschewing excess in favor of essentials and putting the focus on Glaspy’s gift for expressing personal insight with resonant life details that always seem to transcend specific context without glossing over the human experience.\n\nSunday | 11.05\n\nWhat: Barns Courtney\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Barns Courtney is challenging to describe using simple genre designations. His style seems informed by the blues rock the triumphant sound of a single like his recently released “Young in America” is triumphant and expansive, rich in stirring atmospheric melodies like an Arctic Monkeys song. In 2022 and 2023 Barns has been dropping a single here and there to hint at what he might have in store for a future album since he hasn’t had released a new record since the pandemic so for this show you may get to a see a showcase of what you might expect to see more of in 2024 delivered in his usual spirited and engaging fashion.\n\nMonday | 11.06\n\nWhat: Subhumans w/Cheap Perfume and Poison Tribe\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Subhumans are the influential and foundational anarcho-punk band from the UK. Forming in 1980 the group’s creative presentation of humanist anarchism and a left critique of politics and culture in an era when the right was on the ascent globally including in the UK and the USA proved to have an enduring appeal. Partly because the music while very steeped in punk and hardcore aesthetics made that rebellion seem fun and attainable, even a collective endeavor not led by the band so much as the band provided some incisive observations and a sense of play that embodied Emma Goldman’s words about how she didn’t want to be a part of someone’s revolution if there was no dancing. Though the group originally split in 1985 it reunited briefly a couple of times in the 90s but has been back to being active and touring since 2004.\n\nMonday and Tuesday | 11.06 and 11.07\n\nWhat: Periphery w/Mike Dawes\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Periphery is a progressive metal band that formed in Washington D.C. with roots in guitarist Misha Mansoor’s home audio experiments. But over the years the group has evolved with various lineups until its current quintet. In 2023 the group released its first album in four years with Periphery V: Djent Is Not a Genre. The title is a clear and wryly humorous nod to a style of guitar sound that became the defining feature for a whole swath of modern metal with the sharp, clipped riffing. But that’s just one sound in Periphery’s broad range of expression and the new record is more imaginative than that with even elements of electronic composition and creative pinch harmonics making Periphery V not just arguably the band’s most fully-realized record but a high water mark in the progressive metal genre. Witness for yourself at one or both of these shows at a small theater like The Bluebird.\n\nTuesday | 11.07\n\nWhat: Dale Hollow w/Sarah Adams and Peter Stone\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: Dale Hollow got his start in music in his hometown Nashville, Tennessee but is now based out of New York City. Hollow refers to himself as THE Country Music Superstar (“Trademark Pending”) and his stage persona larger than life, his mystique as a fully-formed artist when his earliest released dropped in terms of songwriting and musicianship and the quality of his output supports a case for that designation regardless of that dubious claim on purely verifiable commercial grounds by the likes of Luke Bryan, Loretta Lynn, Jessica Simpson, Darius Rucker or Kenny Chesney. There is a thrilling earnestness to Hollow’s performance on recording and on stage that is commanding even when there’s an element of humor and playfulness to many aspects of Hollow’s craft. His new record Hack of the Year beats critics to the punch with the title and yet it speaks to the spirit of the underdog and the performative humility rampant in much of country music. Hollow takes on the tropes of the genre and and both embraces their virtues and upends the pretensions. Hollow’s use of humor doesn’t mean his songwriting is a joke or satire rather it plays the same role humor does in approaching life and putting everything into the proper perspective and injecting a little joy into some of the most downbeat moments we might experience. The songs of Hack of the Year are very much unalloyed country performed with a grace, elegance and passion one might hope for out of any record or any genre. Listen to our interview with Dale Hollow here.\n\nTuesday | 11.07\n\nWhat: Tallies w/Cherished and Pill Joy\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: Tallies are the shoegaze band from Toronto, Ontario, Canada whose guitar jangle and shimmer are reminiscent of an era of music in the early 90s when a band like Sky Cries Mary wouldn’t be considered shoegaze but more psychedelic rock even though its musical ideas were resonant with a broad range of atmospheric guitar rock. Tallies’ excellent 2019 self-titled album is a bit like if The Sundays and a Sarah records band fused with a more modern shoegaze band that has benefited from developments in the sound of guitar music in the past decade and the shedding of genre adherence. Cherished is the Denver dream pop and shoegaze band whose lush and entrancing guitar work fronted by an emotionally charged frontperson in Chloe Madonna who is also the vocalist for hardcore band Destiny Bond.\n\nWednesday | 11.08\n\nWhat: Mass of the Fermenting Dregs w/Replica City and The Sickly Hecks\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Mass of the Fermenting Dregs is a Japanese trio whose musical style traverses post-hardcore, shoegaze and progressive rock. Formed in Kobe in 2002. After a break in 2012 the group reunited in 2015 and currently touring in support of its 2022 album Awakening: Sleeping. What Boris is for metal and psychedelic rock and noise, this group is sort of for post-hardcore/shoegaze and psychedelia in that its songs seem to have a creative coherence but its presentation can be unpredictable in ways that transcend expectation.\n\nWednesday | 11.08\n\nWhat: Slaughter Beach, Dog w/Bonnie Doon\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Slaughter Beach, Dog started as a solo side project of Jake Ewald of emo/indie rock legends Modern Baseball. But since that band’s 2017 indefinite hiatus Ewald has made Slaughter Beach, Dog his main songwriting outlet. The group’s 2023 record Crying, Laughing, Waving, Smiling has a gentle sound with guitar and percussion flowing like a gentle creek. The introspection is one of looking far afield and assessing both the past and looking to the future while trying to remain emotionally present and striking a Zen-like balance. Musically it’s like a pastoral Luna or a more countrified Low. There is an elegance to the sound and Ewald’s vocal phrasing akin to Steve Kilbey in more tranquil moments. Which seems like a flavor of the season when the world seems on the brink of deep existential turmoil.\n\nWednesday | 11.08\n\nWhat: Bell Witch w/Spirit Possession and Paul Riedl\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Marquis Theater\n\nWhy: Seattle’s funeral doom duo Bell Witch released one of its typically hypnotic, crushing, epic, concept albums in 2023 with Future’s Shadow Part 1: The Clandestine Gate. Anyone that has seen Bell Witch knows the bone rattling reputation of its low end is much deserved. But the new record begins with the sound of spectral organs evoking the mood of some kind of cosmic transition that Dylan Desmond and Jesse Shreibman are going to guide us through for the duration of the album and if you go to the show the range of frequencies generated will render that experience if not literal definitely not fully abstract.\n\nWednesday | 11.08\n\nWhat: Kim Petras: Feed the Beast World Tour w/Alex Chapman\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Fillmore Auditorium\n\nWhy: After some time struggling with the release of her two most recent albums Feed the Beast (released in June 2023) and Problématique (released September 2023), pop singer Kim Petras is finally able to share that music on a headlining tour with a stop in Denver. The latter album got delayed despite completion and was headed for being scrapped with a mass leak of the songs in 2022. But now the EDM-infused hyperpop can be experienced with Petras’ orchestrated, richly multimedia, theatrical production. Petras has been releasing singles and mixtapes and has worked with the likes of Sam Smith, Nicki Minaj, Charli XCX and Banks and is in many ways a veteran and yet this tour is a bit of an introduction of her energetic, sex positive songs of love, hedonism and heartbreak to a wider public.\n\nThursday | 11.09\n\nWhat: Devil Master, Fuming Mouth, Final Gasp and Victim of Fire\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Devil Master is a black metal band from Philadelphia whose 2022 album Ecstasies of Never Ending Night is a blend of the aforementioned and Goth-y hardcore. Fuming Mouth is a death metal band from Massachusetts that just released its new album Last Day of Sun with its contorted vocals and expansively grindy guitar work. Victim of Fire is one of the best Denver-based hardcore bands in that more metallic vein and at times will unexpectedly cover an older and more obscure Iron Maiden song and the like. Final Gasp dropped its debut full length Mourning Moon via Relapse on September 22, 2023. It’s the perfect amalgam of hardcore, thrash and deathrock. Anyone that caught the band at Seventh Circle Music Collective over the summer of 2023 knows that these guys have a furiously intense live show and yet their music has great mood flowing through the fiery performances. The new record is reminiscent of if Testament, Fields of the Nephilim and Rozz Williams-era Christian Death collaborated on an album and made something that seemed completely out of step with its time but would seem prophetic decades later.\n\nFriday | 11.09\n\nWhat: Pussy Riot w/Sloppy Jane\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Pussy Riot is the legendary punk and performance art group from Russia that courted controversy and experienced imprisonment for their unapologetic critiques of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Vladimir Putin regime. Those antics might not translate so well to a touring band that continues to challenge the authoritarianism of its home country and others but if you’ve managed to catch a Pussy Riot show in the past half decade and more you know that the band actually delivers an exuberant and visually compelling live performance.\n\nFriday | 11.10\n\nWhat: Cindy Lee, Freak Heat Waves, Bobby Amulet and Tepid\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Cindy Lee is the solo project of former Women singer Patrick Flegel. The music Flegel has released under this moniker has been well far afield of the experimental guitar rock of women and according to the Cindy Lee Wiki page, it’s a “drag queen ‘confrontation pop’ project.” Flegel was inspired by Karen Carpenter in her appearance and style and how her life was a kind of cautionary tale about the way stardom and the music industry can and will chew you up and dispose of you when you’re no longer getting the spotlight or if your human frailty becomes anything resembling a liability that isn’t readily marketable. The project’s fifth album What’s Tonight to Eternity is like a pure fusion of classic pop and experimental electronic music that fans of modern darkwave will appreciate with a theatrical live presentation to go along with it. Also on the bill is the solo electronic project of Nick Salmon of local shoegaze/post-punk luminaries Voight.\n\nFriday | 11.10\n\nWhat: Fever Ray w/CHRISTEENE\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Fillmore Auditorium\n\nWhy: Fever Ray really created a rich body of content in terms of composition and paired presentation for their 2023 album Radical Romantics. From science fiction noir style music videos, a broad spectrum of promotional photography depicting the singer and songwriter as an androgynous every person like a modern day David Bowie free associating and blurring the lines of gender while commenting incisively about state of the world and culture. It’s clearly one of the most ambitious creative endeavors by a musical artist who has always had a vision for the visual presentation of the music and how it will be experienced by those who show up. To call it arty synth pop is inadequate but a starting point like calling Bowie’s output glam or art rock or pop and the live show is likely to be a dazzling affair that invites participation. CHRISTEENE is the legendary synth punk and art pop artist originally from Brooklyn, NY but these days based out of Austin, TX and really an ideal opening act for Fever Ray.\n\nFriday and Saturday | 11.10 and 11.11\n\nWhat: Huerco S, Pontiac Streator, Dull Tusk, Polly Urethane, Sleepdial, Goo Age live show on 11.10, Huerco S. (DJ), Pontiac Streator, Loudmen and Aalala.One on 11.11.\n\nWhen: 8:30 (11.10) and 11 (11.11)\n\nWhere: Glob\n\nWhy: Huerco S. is making an extremely rare live appearance at Glob with a live music set on 11.10 and a more DJ-oriented set on 11.11 for the late night rave crowd. Brian Leeds aka Huerco S. has had a diverse and prolific career of experimenting with the form and compositional elements of minimal electronic and musique concrète, perhaps even utilizing aspects of plunderphonics in crafting imaginative ambient and minimal house songs while genre bending at will. Pontiac Streator is a likeminded producer from Philadelphia whose own work operates in similar musical realms but with some more seeming roots in deep house and left field pop. Dull Tusk blends glitchcore production style with ambient for something markedly different from both. With Polly Urethane you don’t know what you’re going to get except that it will be something creatively different than what she’s done before as a live artist whether or not it includes bits of her work in noise, art pop, industrial punk beatmaking, classical or the unclassifiable stuff that really is part of her oeuvre. But it won’t be boring and on her own worth the price of admission. Sleepdial is the ambient project of Luke Thinnes who rarely performs this side of his music live and is perhaps more well known for his visionary futuristic retro pop and New Wave glam project French Kettle Station. Goo Age is post-glitchcore and New Age ambient soundscaping in abstract threading together of tone, texture and rhythm.\n\nSaturday | 11.11\n\nWhat: Baroness w/Wayfarer\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: Sludge rock legends Baroness reinvented themselves with the 2019 album Gold & Grey with contributions of new lead guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Gina Gleason. It not only expanded the horizons of what the group had already done and bringing a new creative edge to the band’s songwriting but set a new high water mark for progressive metal. With the band’s new album Stone (2023) Baroness has reached another level with its incorporating the driving and heavy guitar attack that established it as one of the more significant artists in modern heavy music with a more keen ear for atmosphere and nuanced emotional resonance. Yes, the people in the band are all ace practitioners of their craft who can show off aplenty and do on the album but it’s the kind of record that people who aren’t as dazzled by chops alone can appreciate much more fully as a set of songs that engage with an appeal beyond simple rocking out.\n\nSaturday | 11.11\n\nWhat: The Bright Light Social Hour w/Demob Happy\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: Bright Light Social Hour is the popular Austin-based psychedelic rock band that recently released its new album Emergency Leisure, which is a great title for a record at a time when we’re all encouraged to grind and strive beyond reasonable human capacity. This time there’s perhaps an extra element of lounge vibe to its finely crafted psych pop. But get there early to catch Demob Happy who are touring in support of their own new album Divine Machines. The group based out of Newcastle upon Tyne, England some how play fuzzy, bombastic rock and roll but in the mix one imagines one hears the atmospheric alien dystopian stylings of Gary Numan and the mutant pop sensibilities of Sparks. Especially on the new record. If Demob Happy could ever be considered “stoner rock” at any point in its career at this point it has evolved into maybe a hard rock, psychedelic art glam band whose creative vision broke out of any instincts for reinventing classic rock.\n\nSaturday | 11.11\n\nWhat: Baby Baby album release w/RDFM and Deth Rali\n\nWhen: 8 doors/9 show $10\n\nWhere: 715 Club\n\nWhy: Lily Conrad is known for her contributions to the likes of indie rock band Rose Variety but her solo project Baby Baby has always had this earnest, indie/bedroom pop charm and she’s releasing her new album for this show with some assist from electronic pop soundscaper RDFM and dream pop band Deth Rali.\n\nSaturday | 11.11\n\nWhat: Cherry Spit w/Moon Pussy, Watch Yourself Die and Caged Grave\n\nWhen: 7pm, $10-15\n\nWhere: D3 Arts\n\nWhy: This is the debut Cherry Spit show. The band might include former Antibroth bassist Dan Witalski. But these rumors cannot be confirmed and you’ll have to see for yourself. But you also get to see hardcore/extreme metal heroes Caged Grave, Denver death rock super group Watch Yourself Die and one of the best noise rock bands of all time and fortunately based out of the Mile High City with Moon Pussy and maybe, if you’re lucky, Crissy Cuellar will have a bevy of her signature between song stage banter dad jokes.\n\nSunday | 11.12\n\nWhat: The Holy Ghost Tabernacle Choir, Edith Pike and Fainting Dreams\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: The Holy Ghost Tabernale Choir from Savannah, Georgia is rooted in various branches of post-hardcore but its 2022 album Slow Murder expanded on what one might expect from the band if your only exposure to it was previous releases. It includes samples and its songs sound like a thrilling blend of hardcore and the noisy heavy rock of the likes of Melvins or even the more punk end of Boredoms. Opening the show is post-hardcore/dream pop hybrid band from Denver Fainting Dreams whose emotional range is broad and expressed with an intense poignancy and vulnerability. Edith Pike traverses a similarly diverse territory while exuding the raw emotional expressions in its noisy yet atmospheric songs. Like the more punk side of Unwound had that band come up during the era of power violence with sharp angles and hanging chords that drift into sharply amplified feeling.\n\nSunday | 11.12\n\nWhat: Chat Pile w/Agriculture\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Vultures\n\nWhy: This is your next chance to see Chat Pile and Agriculture on this tour. See above on November 2 for more information.\n\nMonday | 11.13\n\nWhat: SDH (Semiotics Department of Heteronyms) w/MVTANT, Church Fire and Sell Farm\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: SDH is an italo-disco/darkwave band from Barcelona, Spain. Like a gloomier version of early Ladytron and cast more in dance music style. Its 2023 album Fake is Real sounds like the soundtrack to an ultra hip retro-futurist espionage thriller. San Antonio’s MVTANT is also on the bill with his own brand of hazy, gloomy dance music that live comes off more as a hard hitting industrial band with irresistible momentum. Church Fire always brings a joyful, emotionally charged energy to its own presentation of industrial dance music that brings a sense of fun to taking down the patriarchy and authoritarianism. Sell Farm is a one-man force of early EBM and industrial soundsculpting.\n\nTuesday | 11.14\n\nWhat: We Are Scientists w/Sean McVerry\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: We Are Scientists formed in 1999 after guitarist/vocalist Keith Murray and bassist Chris Cain met two years prior while attending Pomona College. From early on the group adopted something like a fusion of David Bowie-esque glam rock and post-punk. Its earliest releases reflected a more punk spirit in its songwriting. But over the intervening years the group of course honed and developed and reinvented its sound and its 2023 album Lobes is brimming with melodic atmospheres, funkier rhythms and sophisticated pop songcraft akin to where Phoenix has been going in recent years with more nuanced lyrical content and a series of fantastic promotional music videos featuring a car driving through a city nightscape.\n\nWednesday | 11.15\n\nWhat: Harm’s Way w/Fleshwater and Ingrown Jivebomb\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Harm’s Way is a hardcore band from Chicago whose particular style of sonic aggression has evolved over the years from its early powerviolence roots to what we got to hear on its 2023 record Common Suffering. Featuring a guest appearance by King Woman on “Undertow,” the album seethes with the struggle with mental health issues, turmoil in society and within one’s own relationships and the corrosive effects of political corruption and the impact of creeping authoritarianism. To meet the challenge of expressing the sorts of anxieties and frustrations most of us have felt for the past several years Harm’s Way injected its core sounds with industrial beats and caustic atmospheric elements that give the music a little more bite than previous releases which is no mean feat.\n\nWednesday and Thursday | 11.15 and 11.16\n\nWhat: Allison Russell\n\nWhen: 7 (both nights)\n\nWhere: Boulder Theater (11.15) and Bluebird Theater (11.16)\n\nWhy: Allison Russell some may know for her masterful turns in the great folk Americana duo Birds of Chicago. When that project when on hiatus in 2021 Russell released her debut solo album Outside Child and told some of the most raw and intense personal stories put to record that year. It also featured a more soul-infused sound to which her versatile and emotionally vibrant voice seemed well suited. In 2023 Russell released her new album The Returner. Rather than the seemingly autobiographical exploration of her first solo outing the new record seems uplifting and explicitly points to a spirit of transcending the demons that haunted her and perhaps held her back emotionally and as an artist. Whether this album reflects recent personal discoveries or a lifetime of overcoming childhood and not so childhood trauma matters less than its lush and entrancing sound that is informed by the soul and gospel sounds of her earlier work but also comes across as ambitious art pop akin to the likes of Kate Bush and Caroline Polacek.\n\nThursday | 11.16\n\nWhat: Speedy Ortiz w/Space Moth and Mr. Atomic\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: Speedy Ortiz started as a solo project for guitarist/singer Sadie Dupuis but expanded to a full band in 2011 that has gone on to release three EPs and four full-length albums including 2023’s Rabbit Rabbit. From the beginning Dupuis, also a visual artist, has done a most of the artwork for the band including its album covers and thus one gets a unique and personal aesthetic and perspective from the band’s music that has thankfully made its music challenging to pigeonhole outside of the umbrella term of indie rock. But there is also something immediately accessible about the pop songcraft and poetically and often cleverly observed lyrics that has set the project apart from artists more content with following an established style popular at any given moment. In October 2023 Rolling Stone magazine released a list of “The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time” where Dupuis charted at 176. And a quick listen to any of the band’s records reveals that Dupuis while an imaginative artist in her songwriting is also technically gifted musician who channels that talent into songs that come from the heart. Rabbit Rabbit is an album that explores various themes including survival mechanisms, those behaviors many of us undertake to get us through challenging times in our lives some of which we may not be consciously aware of adopting and which can affect us for much of the rest of our lives. And becoming aware of these patterns gives us some ability to guide our lives in ways we really want so that we can live instead of settling for mere survival. Its a complex and emotionally rich album that is also not short on humor and cultural Easter eggs for the perceptive listener that enrich the full meaning of the songs. Listen to our interview with Sadie Dupuis on Bandcamp.\n\nFriday | 11.17\n\nWhat: Eventually It Will Kill You 6 Year Anniversary: Light Asylum, Human Leather, Ortrotasce, CXCXCX and Teller\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: This anniversary show celebrating the Denver-based darkwave label Eventually It Will Kill You lead by Brian Castillo features a headlining set with legendary darkwave band Light Asylum. The latter is at this point more or less the solo project of Shannon Funchess and we haven’t heard much new music released on an album or EP since 2012 but in 2022 Funchess performed a couple of new songd at the Cold Waves festival in Chicago that year. Light Asylum’s music is a bit like a post-punk synth pop band with Funchess’ commanding vocals and dance prowess to lend the performance some visceral intensity. This marks the first time Light Asylum is performing in Denver. Also on the bill are Salt Lake City synth pop group Human Leather, modular synth noise project CXCXCX, Floridian industrial darkwave project Ortotasce and Denver synth pop solo act Teller.\n\nSaturday | 11.18\n\nWhat: Cory Hanson w/Slowhand and Supreme Joy\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Some may know Cory Hanson better for having been in Wand. But his solo works are psychedelic in a slightly different way as exemplified by his 2023 album Western Cum and its equal facility with waxing freak folk and cosmic country as bombastic psych akin to early Meat Puppets. Also on the bill is Supreme Joy which blurs the line between countrified psych and angular post-punk to fascinating effect.\n\nSaturday | 11.18\n\nWhat: Yard Art, Moonlight Bloom, Totem Pocket, Fly Amanita\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: Thankfully the Denver psyche scene of the 2010s is basically over and you get something in that realm but more in the vein of shoegaze and post-punk with indie pop in the mix with this entire bill of some of the better bands of that vintage.\n\nSaturday | 11.18\n\nWhat: FRENSHIP w/Torine and Bizzy\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: The Marquis Theater\n\nWhy: Los Angeles-based electropop duo FRENSHIP new singles “Love or an Enemy” and “Copenhagen” from their October 13, 2023 EP Base Camp. Weaving together a smooth R&B aesthetic with its signature synthpop sound, songwriters James Sunderland and Brett Hite seem to be using the new set of songs to express a vulnerability that both felt in their travels outside the US and now living apart with one living in Los Angeles and the other in Washington State and able to see their home country from different perspectives and the fragmented nature of the culture and its politics. Rather than rendering judgment the duo speak to the unease and feelings of uncertainty that seem to be a shared experience not just among Americans but internationally for what seem like similar reasons or at least for causes that are interconnected. In typical fashion FRENSHIP approaches the subject matter with nuance and sensitivity.\n\nSunday | 11.19\n\nWhat: Eventually It Will Kill You 6 Year Anniversary: Buzz Kull, Normal Bias, Many Blessings, Terravault and Verhoffst\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: For this second night of the Eventually It Will Kill You 6-year anniversary celebration, Australian coldwave artist Buzz Kull will perform bringing his melodic and dark fusion of EBM and post-punk to the stage. And a good deal of the rest of the show will feature prominent local noise artists like Many Blessings and Verhoffst as well as the industrial synth duo Terravault as well as NYC-based synthwave/industrial funk project Normal Bias.\n\nFriday | 11.24\n\nWhat: Quicksand w/Hotline TNT and Abrams\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Quicksand is the influential post-hardcore band from New York City that included then and now members of renowned hardcore groups Gorilla Biscuits, Youth of Today, Beyond, Bold and Burn. Quicksand’s sound was sludgier, slower, heavier and thus fit in well with the nascent alternative rock milieu of the early 1990s. It’s angular, foreboding sound was a new kind of heavy that wasn’t metal so much and not grunge and you could hear in its songs’ clear roots in punk. After a couple of breaks in the 90s Quicksand reconvened in 2012 to critical acclaim with live shows a reminder that its heavy sound was also a soundtrack to getting through life’s struggles and triumph over everyday adversities. This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the release of its debut full-length Slip which was reissued early in 2023 with an extensive companion booklet. Along for this tour is Hotline TNT also from New York led by Will Anderson formerly of the Canadian band Weed. This project released its new album Cartwheel on November 3, 2023 and for this show the group will provide a good deal of the joyous, atmospheric sonics with its expansively melodic songs. Often lumped in with shoegaze and indie rock the band’s music resists easy categories because its guitar swirl is definitely within the realm of more pop-oriented shoegaze bands but it has enough of and edge to delivery densely glittery moody soundscapes that fit in well with a show with heavier acts. If its music videos are any gauge, Hotline TNT has a healthy and irreverently self-deprecating sense of humor that gives its uplifting melancholia some grounding. Abrams is came out of the more doomy and stoner rock world of Denver metal but its own songs might be described as heavy psych and its own shoegazing instincts have always set the band apart from a more predictable musical path.\n\nFriday | 11.24\n\nWhat: Shadows Tranquil album release w/Polly Urethane and Julian St. Nightmare\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Marquis Theater\n\nWhy: Shadows Tranquil is finally officially releasing its album Downward Flowers and celebrating with this release show. The quartet has some diverse roots in shoegaze, post-punk, emo, psychedelia and noise rock with finely tuned tonal details in the songwriting that emerge with repeated listens to its songs and a bit of a live mystique that isn’t something that’s easily imitated. So the band invited a couple of Denver’s most interesting artists in the world of local experimental and post-punk music. Julian St. Nighmare is secretly one of the best bands from Denver with its alchemical blend of post-punk, surf rock and psychedelia and a charismatic and passionate live show. Polly Urethan is simply someone whose shows you can’t fully predict because she changes up the type of set she does with every performance whether that’s noise, ambient pop, modern classical, noise rock psych or performance art or whatever. But never boring and rote which is not something many artists can claim with validity.\n\nSunday | 11.26\n\nWhat: Teenage Halloween w/Elway (solo), Broken Record and Plasma Canvas\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Asbury Park, New Jersey’s Teenage Halloween has given us an outstanding and heartfelt emo and power pop album with its new album Till You Return. Its a record that dives deep into exploring issues of identity, the heavy legacy of trying to survive and find a place in the world we’re all trying to navigate now but the whole record feels like a big journey of a concept album that doesn’t offer pat answers or solutions but plenty of solidarity and a catharsis of collective trauma. Broken Record from Denver offers its own fusion of melancholic yet vital power pop and modern emo and live comes across as though it absorbed plenty of the influence of Dinosaur Jr and Hüsker Dü. It too released a solid 2023 album with Nothing Moves Me. Assuming its still on for the gig this may or may not be one of your last times getting to see the legendary emocore band Plasma Canvas from Fort Collins. Its sound and chops are steeped in a more radio rock and classic rock vein but delivered with a spirited punk attitude with lyrics that mince no words about struggling with issues of class, gender and sexuality and how that all intersects with a culture and people that are hostile to one’s own unique overlapping identities.\n\nTuesday | 11.28\n\nWhat: The Japanese House w/quinnie\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: The Japanese House is the musical project of Amber Bain who has been developing her sound and songwriting for several years with a leg up from being signed to The 1975’s label Dirty Hit early on and being thusly championed. Bain’s style in some ways anticipated the strain of yacht rock and soft pop that has become a feature of certain branches of indie rock. A great deal of Bain’s output has been on singles and EPs and so In the End It Always Does releasing in 2023 as her second album can give the impression of the musical sophistication and lush and imaginative arrangements as having come out of nowhere. And for Bain it does seem like a lateral leap into experimenting with textures, tones and unorthodox arrangements in crafting her typically well composed pop songs. Adele Julia of Gigwise in a June 28, 2023 review spoke to the album’s candid “discussions surrounding queerness and sexuality.” The album’s rich array of melodies and moods provide a comfortable place within which to have those discussions and the vital yet gentle quality of the album invites the listener along for those discussions regardless of one’s own specific sexual or gender identification.\n\nMonday | 08.01\n\nWhat: Horse Jumper of Love w/Cryogeyser, Cherished and Fainting Dreams\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Boston’s Horse Jumper of Love is that rare band that can somehow be simultaneously a post-punk band and a psychedelic Americana band. Its new album Natural Part has a haunted grittiness that is at times reminiscent of Big Star at its gloomiest and Built to Spill in an introspective mood. Cryogeyser might be considered a bit of a slowcore band even though plenty of its songs aren’t so slow and employ jangly guitar in the way Lush did in its more pop songwriting. Cherished used to be called Lowfaith and thus an intense deathrock band with knack for moody atmospherics. Fainting Dreams is a Denver-based slowcore duo whose introspective/melancholic songs shimmer and incandesce and bloom with lingering moods.\n\nTuesday | 08.02\n\nWhat: The Psychedelic Furs w/X\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Mission Ballroom\n\nWhy: The Psychedelic Furs and X probably need no introduction as bands who in the first case popularized post-punk for a mainstream audience and in the second made arty, literary punk that didn’t shy away from its own roots in country and rockabilly while embracing the ferocious energy of the scene in which it found itself. Both began in 1977. The Furs in London, X in Los Angeles. The former had songs on movie soundtracks most notably the title track, as it were, of the 1986 John Hughes film. The latter were stars of the first underground punk movie of long lasting influence and notoriety, 1981’s The Decline of Western Civilization. Both wrote some of the most memorable songs of their time and genre. Both had many years off between their heyday and their most recent albums but with the most recent albums being among their best. And both still put on a compelling and powerful live show that will sound good in a place like Mission Ballroom.\n\nFriday | 08.05\n\nWhat: Florist w/Marc Merza\n\nWhen: 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: Florist returns with a full band album with 2022’s self-titled album. Though the band is often dubbed with the indie folk label, fair enough, its gently atmospheric music sounds like it was written while contemplating deep feelings and thoughts while having the time to let the mind stretch out in a calm place and replicating that mood in the songwriting. The textural elements of the instrumentation, even when Emily Sprague has composed with her analog synths, are part of the appeal of the band’s music as it establishes a tactile as well as sonic intimacy that sets the band well apart from many other artists whose work is described as indie folk and on the new album there are parts that sound like musique concrète and field recordings used both in the mix and recreated with instruments. It makes for a different kind of listen than the usual pop arrangements that inform the music of most bands. Fans of Mega Bog will appreciate the unconventional style yet immediate accessibility of what Florist has to offer.\n\nFriday | 08.05\n\nWhat: The Derelicts w/Cyclo Sonic and Cease Fire\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: The Derelicts are a punk/garage rock band from Seattle that formed in 1986 around the same time as Mudhoney who had similar musical roots and sensibilities. Maybe they both listened to a lot of The Saints and Radio Birdman. Known for bombastic performances and frontman Duane Bodenheimer’s irreverent stage banter, The Derelicts have remained a bit of an underground legend known among connoisseurs of late 80s and early 90s punk. Chances are The Derelicts encountered The Fluid during that late 80s period when the Denver-based band toured to the Pacific Northwest and played shows with like-minded groups among bands that would go on to form the core of grunge because The Fluid too was a band influenced heavily by the Stooges, garage rock and the like and arguably the most influential punk/post-punk band out of Denver in the 80s and 90s whether other bands know it or not. Matt Bischoff was the bass player for The Fluid but he’d also been in an earlier punk great Frantix from Aurora, Colorado whose single “My Dad’s a Fuckin’ Alcoholic” definitely strikes an immediate chord. These days Bischoff plays guitar in Cyclo Sonic. Sure musically it’s not a big leap from his other bands but fortunately for us Bischoff and his bandmates including Arnie and AJ Beckman formerly of garage punk band The Choosey Mothers and Jif Jipers of punk legends Rok Tots have written a some vital slabs of incredibly catchy punk which can be heard on their 2020 album Candied Rats and the earlier EPs. Cease Fire is a street punk band from Denver that includes former members of The Purple Fluid including Richard Kulwicki, one of the sons of the late great Fluid guitarist the senior Richard “Ricky” Kulwicki.\n\nSunday | 08.07\n\nWhat: The Wild Hearts Tour: Sharon Van Etten, Julien Baker and Angel Olsen w/Quinn Christopherson\n\nWhen: 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: Mission Ballroom\n\nWhy: The Wild Hearts Tour is a showcase of three of the greatest songwriters to have emerged in the past fifteen years. Sharon Van Etten, Julien Baker and Angel Olsen are all artists who earned their reputations with strong songwriting and an inventive take on their specific musicianship styles establishing their own artistic voice early on in their respective careers. And each has gone on to push the boundaries of expectation for what they would do creatively with a body of work that is inventive and emotionally rich. As performers all three women have an openness and freshness of presentation that lends the show an air of the spontaneous that is consistently strikingly compelling. Van Etten’s 2022 album We’ve Been Going About This All Wrong is a bit of a departure from some of her earlier work with a sound that’s so spare it might throw off older fans but it also has an intimacy that has always been a part of her appeal as a songwriter but this one feels so very up close and direct. Julien Baker’s early releases proved she is a gifted songwriter able to take a very stripped down presentation of the music and letting her powerful and emotive voice speak for itself with wit and perceptive observations of self and of being a human navigating a life often fraught with challenges and discouragement. Her 2021 album Little Oblivions greatly expanded her sonic palette as a songwriter with extensive use of electronics and deep atmospheric elements and yet none of it hid and rather enhanced the expression of a startling and thrillingly raw lyrics that just hit so powerfully with an urgent and honest exploration of conflicted feelings and working through emotional trauma in a way that felt maybe a little too real for some listeners. Angel Olsen has been refining and reinventing her songwriting style and sound since her 2011 debut EP Strange Cacti and with her first full-band release 2014’s Burn Your Fire For No Witness her career seemed to take off. Her creatively expressive vocals lent itself well to stories drawn from her own life and observational songs about the impact of culture and one’s own history on the psyche. Her evocative and pastoral guitar work and voice have worked powerfully in tandem across her career as she freely incorporated aesthetics and musical ideas into her work but always somehow being able to speak to underlying emotions that often defy cogent expression but which Olsen has been able to bring forth across six albums including the classic country flavored 2022 album Big Time which does draw upon an older aesthetic but is fully modern in execution which is no mean feat. Won’t be a subpar moment of music on stage for this show.\n\nSunday | 08.07\n\nWhat: Telekinetic Yeti w/White Hills and Hashtronaut\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: When one thinks of gloriously epic psychedelic metal Dubuque, Iowa is probably not where you’d expect a band like Telekinetic Yeti to come from though the state has long been home to many musical surprises over the years. The duo’s new album Primordial released July 8 on Tee Pee Records, home to some of the cooler heavy psychedelic and doom bands of recent years. “Stoner rock” started getting super stale around 18 years ago but fortunately some of those musicians evolved in to doom metal and then the weirder musicians recognized that Black Sabbath and Sleep both didn’t bother with splitting up heaviness and psychedelia and in fact saw how they could complement each other well in creating mind-altering music. Telekinetic Yeti is of that vintage. White Hills has long been one of the best heavy psychedelic bands going since forming in 2003. Also a duo, White Hills has fortunately been impossible to pigeonhole because yes there are elements of metal, krautrock, space rock, post-punk, ambient, noise and the avant-garde in the group’s music the entirety of its career and each record has been an attempt to do something different in terms of sonics, songwriting, structure, emotional colorings and the potential for performance that goes beyond simple songwriting. The forthcoming The Revenge Of Heads On Fire out September 16 on Cargo Records UK is definitely a stretch into the kind of space rock territory fans of Hawkwind will appreciate. Denver’s Hashtronaut are also fellow travelers of the tripped out, slow burn, heavy psychedelia.\n\nSunday | 08.07\n\nWhat: Death Bells w/Pendant and Candy Apple\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Death Bells formed in Sydney, Australia in 2015 but moved to Los Angeles in 2018 in search of greater horizons of developing and sharing its unique brand of post-punk. The sophomore album New Signs of Life was a refreshingly spare and stark set of songs with hushed moods and strong melodies. Its new album Between Here & Everywhere seems to have incorporated even more synths and electronic drums for an album that has even further refined the band’s use of repetition as an emotional mnemonic element that has an effect like connecting with ripples of water in the mind all while one hears in the arrangements an element of haunted folk. But one thing is for certain, Death Bells is not really making music in line with the more trendy sounds of modern darkwave and post-punk.\n\nSunday | 08.07\n\nWhat: Machine Gun Kelly w/Travis Barker and WILLOW\n\nWhen: 6:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ball Arena\n\nWhy: Machine Gun Kelly is someone whose blend of hip hop and rock you either like or find odd but one thing he has done outside of providing fodder for tabloid news is champion up and coming artists of promise in the realm of pop by bringing them on to his recordings and/or on tour. This time that artist is WILLOW. The latter for sure had a leg up in the realm of entertainment as the daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. But not all children of famous, wealthy people end up doing anything of interest beyond casual curiosity. Fortunately Willow Smith isn’t just skating by on those connections even though they have certainly helped her out along the way. Her musical career thus far has been one of reinvention and exploration from early, teenage pop music to her 2021 album lately I feel EVERYTHING in which she debuted a knack for writing pop-punk songs that really do articulate the overloaded feelings of adolescence well and with lyrics that go beyond tropes of the genre. Look for WILLOW’s new album <COPINGMECHANISM> due out later in the summer, the early singles of which find the songwriter evolving further in her fusion of styles and incorporating them into her own sound.\n\nMonday | 08.08\n\nWhat: Marissa Nadler w/Bluebook\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Marissa Nadler is one of the most distinctive voices in modern music. Her musical style that may default to comparisons to folk, Gothic Americana, dream pop and what might be described as pastoral metal has an emotional vibrant and intense yet expansive quality that has rendered her music probably too dark for even the psychedelic and freak folk scene and not hard rock enough for heavy music purists. And yet there’s something compellingly otherworldly about Nadler’s songwriting that has rendered all of her albums and collaborations unique and requiring the listener to enter the songwriter’s emotional universe, one which has direct resonance in a universal sense as Nadler’s mezzo-soprano vocals and intimacy with the roots of her own psychology translates well into a personal myth making and storytelling that is instantly captivating. Her latest album The Path of the Clouds may be her finest yet as she was forced to compose the songs during the depths of the first phase of the pandemic and its companion EP the The Wrath of the Clouds reveals a broad range of emotion and an attempt to move through the anxiety and anomy the ongoing crisis is visiting upon everyone with any level of sensitivity. Bluebook these days is very much in sync with the broodingly brilliant energy of Nadler’s own work especially in the band’s current arrangement like a darkwave-flavored chamber folk band.\n\nTuesday | 08.09\n\nWhat: Church of the Cosmic Skull w/Lord Buffalo and Keefduster\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Church of the Cosmic Skull sounds like it listened to a lot of Ya Ho Wha 13 along the line of arriving at its unusual brand of psychedelic chamber pop. Lord Buffalo has a vibe like the guys in the band went out into the desert and tried to find signs of the Great Spirit in the dark and forgotten places of the landscape and returned a little haunted, a little mad and a little inspired to make expansive, psychedelic rock to reflect those kinds of journeys outside mundane pursuits.\n\nThursday | 08.11\n\nWhat: Ian Sweet w/BNNY\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: When Ian Sweet released its album Show Me How You Disappear on March 5, 2021 it was right before an extended period of great uncertainty for live music and music careers in general and the industry surrounding all of that. Perhaps it’s a bit too ironic but also oddly good timing for that record to have come out as its psychedelic pop was an exploration of anxiety, the traumas that fuel it and working through the paralyzing guilt that crashes into your brain when you take on the responsibility for the trauma inflicted and overthinking what could have been and what could be in an endless spiral of self-reinforcing, internalized punishment and turmoil. The album’s songs feel like both a realistic depiction of the feelings of processing the aforementioned and a salve on the psychic turmoil that can feel like an inescapable trap. In 2022 Ian Sweet issued the Star Stuff EP which deals with similar emotional territory as Show Me How You Disappear but feels more at peace in its exquisite atmospherics even when it hits some deep melancholic notes. Chicago’s BNNY has been writing similarly emotionally tender material but its own music is more in the realm of slowcore and dream pop. Singer Jess Viscius sounds like she’s singing out of a book of private thoughts and writings drawn from extensive self-examination and deep observation. He group’s 2021 album Everything is reminiscent of both Mazzy Star and Galaxie 500 in its beautifully billowing tonal aesthetic.\n\nThursday | 08.11\n\nWhat: Red Fang w/Bell Witch & Aerial Ruin: Stygian Bough and HELP https://www.bluebirdtheater.net/events/detail/436500\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Red Fang is the sludge/doom metal band based out of Portland, Oregon who have managed to carve out of a niche for themselves in a crowded field with imaginative music videos, a healthy sense of humor and songwriting that goes beyond simply making melodic heavy music paired with superior tone sculpting. Bell Witch and Aerial Ruin are playing a collaborative set with a performance of the 2020 album Stygian Bough Volume I. In typical fashion there is a lot of delicacy and nuance in the crushing and transporting heaviness of the music like a mini-metal orchestra but without the cheesiness of some of the more melodic death metal bands, just mystical, haunting soundscapes that feel like a heroic journey through dark places. Opener HELP is a noise rock band also from Portland whose songs seethe with a rage against the power structures that have been increasingly making life more challenging and unsustainable for most people and in the end all life on earth as well. Unabashedly political that sensibility can be heard in its clashing, twisting, angular assault of drums, guitar, bass and vocals with a triumphant spirit we don’t hear often enough and the 2022 album 2053 is worthy of Killing Joke at its most righteously caustic.\n\nFriday | 08.12\n\nWhat: Local Natives w/Jordana\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: Local Natives have thus far made a pretty good career out of writing the modern equivalent of yacht rock but with undeniably great vocal harmonies that incorporate superbly executed falsetto which isn’t easy to pull off. Opening artist Jordana released her latest album Face The Wall. Jordana Nye played all the instruments and did much of the production for the record. It’s a deeply introspective, confessional set of songs that feel open and gently but strikingly honest. What is perhaps most striking about the songwriting is Jordana’s mastery of transitions and orchestrating the layers of atmosphere. A lot of pop music has solid production or it wouldn’t work but Jordana’s work on the album draws you in and while very real about issues of anxiety and uncomfortable truths makes it all seem like something you can survive even if you may or may not overcome your life’s struggles for good or in the ways you had anticipated.\n\nFriday | 08.12\n\nWhat: DUG, Moon Pussy, Quits and Almanac Man\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: DUG is comprised of former members of the great noise rock band Buildings from Minneapolis. Noise rock can be a generic term so in the case of DUG it sounded like they took some inspiration from Laughing Hyenas and The Jesus Lizard/Scratch Acid in equal measure. Moon Pussy from Denver has a catharsis embedded in its eruptive and sometimes caustic but also angularly mind-altering riffs. Quits somehow sounds colossal and on the verge of breakdown and breaking out at the same time making its own sonic barrage exciting and engrossing. Almanac Man somehow splices together an unhinged sludge rock with math-y posthardcore. Like if Clutch and Neurosis had a baby.\n\nSaturday | 08.13\n\nWhat: Lost 80s Live A Flock of Seagulls, Wang Chung, The English Beat, Naked Eyes, Missing Persons, Stacey Q, Animotion, Dramarama, Tommy Tutone and Musical Youth\n\nWhen: 5:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Fiddler’s Green\n\nWhy: Could be kind of a mess, this many bands on one bill but of course all the acts will get limited stage time to play their 80s hits. But it may also be one of the only opportunities you get to see the legendary and pioneering New Wave band Missing Persons who were always different from its peers and still a compelling live band. Also Flock of Seagulls wrote plenty of evocative, moody synth pop beyond its own hits but will they play songs like “Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)” or “The More You Live, the More You Love”? Wang Chung is most well known for hits like “Dance Hall Days” and “Everybody Have Fun Tonight” but its score for the 1985 film To Live and Die in L.A. proved that the group was capable of crafting enduring art pop of urgency and intensity. Hope if you see their set they’ll indulge a track or two from the soundtrack.\n\nSunday and Monday | 08.14 and 08.15\n\nWhat: Hoveriii (with Moose and The Crooked Rugs on 08.14 and with Nolan Potter and Petite Amie on 08.15)\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge 08.14 and Vultures 08.15\n\nWhy: Los Angeles-based psychedelic rock band Hooveriii (pronounced “Hoover Three”) recently released its new record A Round of Applause. The record is only eleven tracks and all roughly the length of a radio friendly pop song but it feels like a sprawling yet progressive affair of kaleidoscopic tones and a strong streak of experimentation in what sounds and structures the group was willing to indulge as it took the time to explore what it could do in the studio in shaping and crafting a sound that was fairly different from the jam band stylings of its 2021 album Water For Frogs. Urgent yet playful, the new album finds Hooveriii operating with a focus and economy of style without skimping on imaginative sonic excursions outside the established songwriting lines.\n\nMonday | 08.15\n\nWhat: Bodega w/The Sickly Hecks and Flora de la Luna\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Bodega is a Brooklyn-based art punk/post-punk band whose offbeat sense of humor and fascinating fusion of New Wave rock and the kind of pop band Brian Eno might have started had he not attached himself to Talking Heads and U2 for several years. Its sharply observed lyrics cast modern life in sharp contrast to its historical roots and the legacy thereof at least on its 2022 album Broken Equipment—a title that is such a great metaphor for the tools we’re given to navigate and make sense of the world handed down to us and making do the best we can.\n\nTuesday | 08.16\n\nWhat: Spaceface w/Petite Amie and Pleasure Prince\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: For the past decade Spaceface has been crafting otherworldly, psychedelic pop and its 2022 album Anemoia is a genre swapping, colorful sonic collage of sounds and ideas that seems to free associate styles from across decades. A core of fuzzy guitar and ethereal melodies evoke 70s R&B and funk while the songs often sound like summertime music for a place the band !!! might vacation after being woken from cryogenic slumber in 100 years after a generation as yet unborn has dismantled the foundations of our dysfunctional civilization in favor of something more nurturing and fun for everyone. But really its just gorgeous, retro-furturist psychedelic music that somehow sounds hedonistic without coming off corny. Petite Amie is a similarly-minded band from Mexico City whose own music has lush, downtempo funky vibes like they absorbed the entire ABBA catalog along with heapings of Broadcast, Daft Punk and taking in the films of Sofia Coppola. It has that dreamlike quality that exudes benevolence and mystery like few bands do. It’s the kind of music those of us who remember going to roller skating rinks in the 1970s and 1980s wish we could have been listening to instead of the too often tepid pop hits of the day. The band’s 2021 self-titled album is grand showcase of transporting sounds and soothing soundscapes.\n\nTuesday | 08.16\n\nWhat: …And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead w/New Candys https://www.eventbrite.com/e/and-you-will-know-us-by-the-trail-of-dead-with-new-candys-tickets-356700158777?aff=odwdwdspacecraft\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Forming in Austin, Texas in 1994, …And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead has been one of the more interesting guitar rock bands out of the underground that somehow both exerted an influence on modern indie rock while remaining a bit of a cult band. Its 2002 album Source Tags & Codes defied easy classification with its eclectic and inventive range of sounds, a pattern the band maintains up to and including its 2020 album X: The Godless Void and Other Stories. Known for its incendiary live shows contrasted with thoughtful and often high concept lyrics, Trail of Dead may be underrated but always surprisingly vital. New Candys from Venice, Italy released Vyvyd in 2021 and it proved to be one of the best psychedelic rock albums of the year with its hybrid of krautrock and shoegaze.\n\nWednesday | 08.17\n\nWhat: The Teaches of Peaches Anniversary Tour\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: Canadian electroclash pioneer and producer Peaches is touring for the anniversary of the release of her genre landmark album The Teaches of Peaches (2000). The album broke Peaches aka Merrill Nisker to a more mainstream audience despite its playfully profane and unabashedly sexual lyrics. Perhaps its biggest hit “Fuck the Pain Away” is a classic of modern electronic music and Peaches’ confrontational and genre bending live show blurs the boundaries between hip-hop, electronic dance music and punk in a way that both challenges preconceptions and welcomes listeners and those who are there for the show to open up to new ways of thinking about subjects you thought you already knew your thinking about.\n\nThursday | 08.18\n\nWhat: The Weeknd\n\nWhen: 6:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Empower Field at Mile High\n\nWhy: Abel Tesfaye aka The Weeknd has spent the last decade and a half building a career as one of the most compelling songwriters and producers in popular music. Whether he lends his imaginative soundscaping to R&B, hip-hop, pop or his unique and powerful interpretation of synth pop or lending his skills to the works of other artists, Tesfaye seems to bring a creative sensibility that finds and brings forth the hidden potential in the music and helps that to highlight and enhance the work overall. His new album Dawn FM (2022) bridges all his musical worlds while also being one of the great darkwave records of the past decade. Expect a spectacle for this show especially given the of necessity large format venue as the songwriter seems the type to want to give people something extra for the trouble of showing up and following his music in general.\n\nThursday | 08.18\n\nWhat: The KVB w/M!R!M\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: UK duo The KVB caught the attention of shoegaze and post-punk heads with its early releases starting a decade ago and garnering a bit of a cult following for its highly stylized multimedia aesthetics and seamless synthesis of electronic music and the aforementioned styles. Its 2021 album Unity is a further exploration of the techno production that has informed the band’s music since its early days as fused to downtempo pop in hazy melodies shot through with a forceful energy. M!R!M is the solo project of Jack Milwaukee whose 2022 album Time Traitor recalls a strange blend of early TR/ST and mid-80s synth pop and thus darkwave style but with some R&B sensibility in the beat making.\n\nFriday – Sunday | 08.19 – 08.21\n\nWhat: Down In Denver Fest\n\nWhen: 6 p.m. – 1 a.m. on Friday, 12 p.m. – 1 a.m. on Saturday, 12 p.m. – 12 a.m. on Sunday\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: In the decay of local culture curation born of a robust local media covering music and the arts in a systematic and interested rather than neglectful manner local music coverage and festivals seemingly lack an awareness of the history of the community of the arts and the context in which new artists emerge. This festival was conceived of when in 2021 the UMS, which had been an actively communitarian endeavor in years prior, seemed to have lost its mooring and sense of mission and musicians representing a swath of local music cut out of that sprawling event realized they could put something together that was very much about the local scene and the people who make it up. Assembled in about a month to six weeks the 2021 edition of Down in Denver was a well orchestrated showcase of some of the best local music at any festival all year. This year the event is slightly bigger but in the same format of two stages and now the first day is a free pre-party featuring some prime local talent as well. No skimping. Look for our extended coverage with interviews throughout this week with some of the artists performing and photographic shares on the Queen City Sounds IG account throughout the weekend. To purchase tickets and for the detailed and most up to date lineup and schedule check the link above or here.\n\nSaturday | 08.20\n\nWhat: Barstool Messiah album release show for Whiskey Baptismal featuring Erica Brown w/Cyclo Sonic and Dust Beneath Dirt\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Herman’s Hideaway\n\nWhy: Barstool Messiah is celebrating the release of its thunderous and soulful new album Whiskey Baptismal with a performance including legendary soul, blues and R&B singer Erica Brown whose vocals in her own music are reason enough to go see the show but whose talents have graced numerous records including the aforementioned and artists one might think well outside her realm of musical expertise. Also on the bill is the exceptional garage punk band Cyclo Sonic comprised of former members of the Fluid, Frantix, Rok Tots and Choosey Mothers.\n\nSaturday | 08.20\n\nWhat: Punk in Drublic Craft Beer & Music Festival Feat. NOFX w/Pennywise, Circle Jerks, The Suicide Machines, Adolescents, T.S.O.L., Dwarves, The Bridge City Sinners, Bad Cop/Bad Cop, PKEW PKEW PKEW, Cheap Perfume and All Waffle Trick https://www.fiddlersgreenamp.com/events/detail/429519\n\nWhen: 11 a.m.\n\nWhere: Fiddler’s Green\n\nWhy: Until this tour one would have said that the Jawbreaker tour was the punk tour of 2022. But there’s no need for competition in punk or music and this event happening at Fiddler’s Green includes some of punk’s most important bands of both the pop-punk and hardcore era. And also the great Colorado Springs, feminist punk band Cheap Perfume whose powerful and irreverent songs dismantling patriarchal behavior and human cruelty in general are always worth a gander. It would be facile to list off why every band on the bill matters but Circle Jerks, this might be the last time you get to see them on some kind of national tour. The group began after singer Keith Morris departed Black Flag and his combination of deep contempt for vested authority and surreal and pointed sense of humor found a vital outlet in a new band Circle Jerks which produced a body of work so potent and creative beyond simply being foundational to hardcore that its early records still sound fresh and telling it like it is. 2022 marks the 40th anniversary of the release of the group’s Wild in the Streets album and thus the setlist might lean a little heavy in that direction. The tour earlier in the year proved the Jerks still have the fire so maybe, just maybe, they’ll tour in 2023 for the 40 year anniversary of its 1983 classic Golden Shower of Hits.\n\nTuesday and Wednesday | 08.23 and 08.24\n\nWhat: Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats w/Caroline Rose\n\nWhen: 6:30\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: Nathaniel Rateliff first made waves in Denver with his alternative rock band Born in the Flood. The atmospheric, heartfelt music that came out of that project garnered the songwriter and his bandmates fans far and wide and was poised for at least indie fame when it was invited to be on a live music program Matt Pinfield was helming, recording one of the pilot episodes. The show never aired. Rateliff went on to do some solo music as The Wheel which became a band with local musical luminaries and long time collaborators and friends and it too seemed poised for success in the kind of indie success most bands never quite achieve and that didn’t happen either. Nevermind the quality of the material, the music world is fickle and people just as worthy out of Denver have been overlooked for decades. But then Rateliff got together some friends for a band called Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats. The name probably came along after the music, as these things go, but the 2015 self-titled debut album yielded a left field and unfortunately locally ubiquitous hit in “S.O.B..” But even if you got sick of hearing it in Denver it finally propelled Rateliff into mainstream success and he took some friends along for that ride that one can tell from interviews he knows can end at any time so now the band is simply enjoying that success while it lasts and is now touring in support of its “COVID” album The Future which is the blues, Americana rock blend that has kept the band in the musical mainstream but there is an interesting spaciousness and stark production at points that point to an acute awareness of the fragility and tentative nature of life and what we take for granted when we allow ourselves to get too comfortable. It’s also the band’s best record of its three thus far.\n\nWednesday| 08.24\n\nWhat: Mizmor w/Heretical Sect, Spiritual Poison, Cronos Compulsion\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Mizmor’s 2022 album Wit’s End is a meditation on the caustic effect of superstition gone wrong and the extolling of destructive irrationality above compassion and intelligence. In the language of colossal, atmospheric blackened doom it seeks a path through a time of civilizational darkness. Heretical Sect is a blackened death metal outfit from Santa Fe whose spooky atmospherics are driving and not really cartoonishly menacing and the content of shows 2020 album Rapturous Flesh Consumed shares some thematic sentiments as the new Mizmor record. Spiritual Poison you won’t get to see too often and it’s one of Ethan McCarthy’s always interesting noise projects, this one more ambient and enigmatic than even Many Blessings.\n\nFriday | 08.26\n\nWhat: Extra Kool album release w/DJ Jon Blaze and Calm.\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Englewood Tavern\n\nWhy: Extra Kool almost never performs live anymore but Danny Vincennie aka Extra Kool has been writing some of the most heartbreaking, hilarious, thought-provoking and creative raps of the past two decades and more. This night he’s releasing his latest album Not A Ghost…But Dead Inside and it’s proof that if you do something with integrity for your entire career everything you put out will have artistic merit and this album is on par with his entire catalog. Also playing this night is the political and also intensely creative hip-hop duo Calm. with their own literary raps and some of the most colorful, moving and beautiful beats in the Colorado rap game and beyond.\n\nSaturday | 08.27\n\nWhat: Madeline Peyroux and Joan Osborne\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Arvada Center For the Arts and Humanities\n\nWhy: Joan Osborne burst onto the national music scene with her hit album 1996 Relish and the single “One of Us.” One might be excused to not being into the single so much and perhaps misjudging Osborne’s other music based on the ubiquity of the single in the year or three after its release. But anyone that got to see Osborne around that time whether on one of her own tours or her appearances on the Lilith Tour in 1997 and 1998 witnessed a passionate performer with a raw, authentic style that couldn’t fail to leave a strong impression of the singer/songwriter as a performer and human capable of projecting her feelings and connecting with the audience in a seemingly direct way. For this show, Osborne will performs Relish in its entirety. Madeline released her own noteworthy debut album Dreamland in 1996 as well. The record garnered her a bit of a following but her 2004 follow-up albums Careless Love marked the beginning of her prolific subsequent career as one of the most popular jazz singers of the past couple of decades.\n\nMonday | 08.29\n\nWhat: Marissa Nadler w/Seance\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Vultures\n\nWhy: See above on 08.08 for Marissa Nadler.\n\nTuesday | 08.30\n\nWhat: Cults w/Reptaliens and DJ Boyhollow\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: HQ\n\nWhy: Reptaliens from Portland, Oregon may at initial contact seem like a cool, fairly downtempo, psychedelic indie pop band with earworm vocal melodies. But the more you delve into its lyrics and the subject matter of its albums something far stranger emerges with songs inspired by left field science fiction, bizarre pop culture artifacts and esoteric knowledge. After all who names an album VALIS after the 1981 science fiction novel by Philip K. Dick based on true events with possibly metaphysical experiences with an alien intelligence. Headliners Cults enjoyed real indie buzz in the early 2010s when its self-titled debut was released on Columbia. Fortunately the hype wasn’t overblown and Cults’ dream pop offerings had some vitality as evidenced by its often spirited live shows.\n\nTuesday | 08.30\n\nWhat: Black Flak and the Nightmare Fighters w/Totem Pocket, Innerspace, Abandons and Brother Saturn\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: This is an all post-rock/post-metal show featuring Salt Lake City’s Black Flak and the Nightmare Fighters who might more rightly be considered a shoegaze band with Kate Hoffmeister’s dusky vocals. Abandons is the kind of band who maybe came out of an early interest in progressive metal and art rock that evolved into a skillful crafting of soundscapes and textures in broad, dynamic strokes without writing music aimed at fitting in with a genre or subgenre which is why it’s difficult to make comparisons except to describe the music except partially as sculpted waves of mood. Brother Saturn is Drew Miller’s post-rock project which means some blissed out guitar tonal compositions and electronics that are the more visceral side of his other projects in ambient music.\n\nWednesday | 08.31\n\nWhat: Elder w/Belzebong and Dreadnought\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: ELDOVAR – A Story of Darkness & Light (2021) pretty much established former Massachusetts-based progressive metal band Elder and German psychedelic band Kadavar as purveyors of a heavy art rock that is as creatively ambitious as it is compelling beyond any ability to appreciate the technical skill going into it or the theory. It’s cinematic in the way that mid-70s Genesis was and the delicate touches in the composition give context to heavier passages and the album doesn’t get stuck in the tropes of any genre. Yes, we’ve heard epic, science fiction flavored hard psychedelic rock before but this album feels like something different and worthy of a listen to anyone with an interest in psychedelic rock and where doom can go when it’s not stuck in its familiar habits. Dreadnought is a band whose tribal, heavy pagan psychedelia is a good fit for a bill like this where there isn’t a tired formula guiding anyone’s music.\n\nWednesday | 08.31\n\nWhat: Hiatus Kaiyote\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Boulder Theater\n\nWhy: Melbourne, Australia’s Hiatus Kaiyote is refreshingly difficult to pin down without sounding like they’re trying too many things. Their unique style of soul and R&B is so idiosyncratic it sounds like the kind of band J. Dilla would have wanted to have started or at least produced because the avant-garde jazz flourishes in the songwriting almost sound like well-produced samples. Its 2021 album Mood Valient is the group’s most coherent offering to date and its organic and evolving rhythms so fresh and unusual it sounds like an improv session developed until the rhythms are tight but never stale.\n\nThursday | July 12, 2018\n\nWho: Yob, Bell Witch and Primitive Man\n\nWhen: Thursday, 07.12, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Yob’s sludgy doom has always been accompanied with a healthy sense of play. Yes, the crushing heaviness of the band’s music is undeniable but so is the group’s obvious self-awareness. It’s latest record, 2018’s Our Raw Heart subverts doom conventions with almost buoyant melodies and dynamics and a layering of conventionally pretty sounds and gritty, deeply textured atmospherics. It’s only fitting that the trio is touring with fellow Pacific Northwesterners in the duo Bell Witch from Seattle. The latter has crafted majestic and minimalist soundscapes since its 2010 founding. With the tragic death of former drummer/vocalist Adrian Guerra in 2016, bassist/vocalist Dylan Desmond recruited Jesse Shreibman to continue with the project. The first album with Desmond and Shreibman, 2017’s Mirror Reaper, is both a continuation of the colossal sonics of the band’s first two albums but also a step further into a powerful and moving expression of grief and despair as well as an evocation of cosmic time and our place in it. Conceived of as a single track at over eighty minutes, Mirror Reaper may move slowly and employ repetitive dynamics but it never seems to overstay its welcome. Opening the show is Denver’s own juggernaut of death metal and doom, Primitive Man.\n\nWhat: Musical Mayhem: Spyderland, Enji and Snaggletoothe\n\nWhen: Thursday, 07.12, 8:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lion’s Lair\n\nWhy: Musical Mayhem had a home for quite some time at The Skylark Lounge. But now the night curated by Claudia Woodman is happening at Lion’s Lair. Spyderland is a weirdo music duo including Marie Litton of Pretty Mouth and Drew McClellan of Archipelaghost. Enji is TripLip bassist Kevin Schultz doing solo material that sounds like Hella doing music for an 8-bit video game. Snaggletoothe is a noisy, improvisational rock guitar and drum duo.\n\nWhat: Glasss Presents The Speakeasy Series Season 2: Fringe Class and Dorian\n\nWhen: Thursday, 07.12, 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hooked On Colfax\n\nWhy: How Portland, Oregon’s synth pop dance band Fringe Class is going to play at Hooked On Colfax is anyone’s guess. But paired with the more ambient Denver project Dorian maybe the group will do a more stripped down set than it will do in other rooms during its trip through Denver.\n\nWhat: Lou Barlow\n\nWhen: Thursday, 07.12, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bruz Beers\n\nWhy: Lou Barlow of Dinosaur Jr and Sebadoh playing a solo set at Bruz Beers? Given Barlow’s love of brilliantly unusual guitar styles like those of Joni Mitchell, it could be a chance to see something unlike anything you’ll see from Barlow in Denver again.\n\nWhat: The Dandy Warhols w/Uni\n\nWhen: Thursday, 07.12 and Friday, 07.13, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ophelia’s Electric Soap Box\n\nWhy: The Dandy Warhols are still kicking along and remain one of the great live bands that came out of the alternative rock milieu that’s still around and not milking some nostalgia circuit. Normally the band plays much larger venues making this string of shows at Ophelia’s a rare chance to catch the band in an intimate environment.\n\nFriday | July 13, 2018\n\nWhat: A$AP Ferg w/IDK and Buddy\n\nWhen: Friday, 07.13, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: For a guy that did visual art and fashion before doing music, realms in which he excelled, A$AP Ferg has done well for himself. While not a pioneer of trap, which had its roots in music that came out before he was born, Ferg nevertheless became one of the genre’s most skilled practitioners in the 2010s. Having the nerve to name his 2013 album Trap Lord, Ferg could at least back-up the bravado and embody the claim. What has kept the rapper interesting is the fact that there’s an unmistakable unusual quality to his beats and wordplay. Perhaps grittier than the work of his A$AP Mob cohort A$AP Rocky, Ferg nevertheless shares a sensibility that aims beyond genre and beyond hip-hop. Even when he engages in lyrics rife with hip-hop tropes, Ferg uses them as elements rendering them meta and more like musical elements than anything to be taken at face value. 2017’s Still Striving showcases the artist’s ever-evolving incorporation of musical elements that give his songs a layered dimensionality.\n\nWhat: Sarah Shook and the Disarmers w/Timmy The Teeth\n\nWhen: Friday, 07.13, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Sarah Shook’s country songs of survival and struggle reflect her upbringing in a fundamentalist Christian family that made the town elders in the movie Footloose seem open-minded by comparison. The video for “New Ways to Fail” (doesn’t the title tell a lot already) shows some everyday urban rebels skateboarding as Shook lays out immediately relatable, self-deprecating lyrics. But every song on the band’s 2018 album Years is, as Henry Rollins once said of early Black Flag records, a direct line to what the fuck it’s all about in America for anyone that can’t expect much out of a society and a culture built on getting us to neglect ourselves and each other on a rat race to nowhere. But there’s an inherent hope in Shook’s music because she’s out there touring and expressing so eloquently and understanding of the everyday lives of anyone that might come to catch one of the band’s shows.\n\nWhat: Compost Heap Day 1\n\nWhen: Friday, 07.13, 4 p.m.\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: The first day of a festival that is to some extent a celebration of the more folk end of punk and bands within that general realm of music. Schedule for today: Real Lyin’ Rohr 4, Just Hanging Out (TX) 4:40, Violet Valentine 5:20, Fire Ant Season (TX) 6, Marissa 6:35, Paul Ski & The James Joyce Letters 7:15, Bird Teeth (WA) 7:55, Long Sought Rest (WA) 8:35, JSR 9:15, Whistlepig (AZ), Crow Cavalier 10:35\n\nWhat: Quintron & Miss Pussycat w/Phallic Meditation\n\nWhen: Friday, 07.13, 8:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Quintron & Miss Pussycat from New Orleans somehow combine a high energy weirdo cabaret/psychedelic rockabilly show with a mind-altering puppet theater performance. Always entertaining and it will transport you outside your everyday life if you let it.\n\nSaturday | July 14, 2018\n\nWho: Great American House Fire\n\nWhen: Saturday, 07.14, 10:30 a.m.\n\nWhere: Ross Cherry Creek Library\n\nWhy: Someday more bands will figure out that the emotional rawness of emo, the diverse songwriting methodology of 2000s indie rock bands, Americana’s textures and warmth and soulful vocals are completely complementary elements for a band. But for now you can catch a group that excelled at that going back to the days of Denver’s Spokeshaver, from which Great American House Fire draws some of its membership. Now presented on a Saturday morning at the Cherry Creek branch of Denver Public Library,\n\nWho: Rowboat, Wild Call and Grass\n\nWhen: Saturday, 07.14, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: Sam McNitt’s roots in folk music and literature probably account for some of the sophistication and poetic sensibility to his music. When he was writing music with his old space rock band Blue Million Miles he met the challenge of amplifying his expressive and emotionally taut vocals. Rowboat is more an expression of McNitt’s more sonically gentle work but the emotional colorings are still vibrant and complex. Wild Call is one of Denver’s best psychedelic rock bands because it’s gone beyond the whole psychedelic bandwagon of the past decade with grittier sounds and lyrics that tap into psychological spaces that can’t be reduced to a celebration of mind altering chemicals and partying. Grass is a noisy shoegaze band from Boulder whose 2016 album Dragwire is pleasantly reminiscent of Night Beats and the more dirty dream pop acts on the Siltbreeze label.\n\nWhat: Compost Heap 3 Day 2\n\nWhen: Saturday, 07.14, 3 p.m.\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: Schedule for day 2 of Compost Heap 3, a kind of folk punk festival (Sliver isn’t folk punk unless someone wishing they were Bad Brains is folk punk–the argument could be made) featuring artists from Colorado and far beyond: open mic 3, Murder Person For Hire (IL) 4, Sliver 4:40, Old Fox Road (IL) 5:20, Rascal Mikes (OR) 6, Chatterbox and the Latter Day Satanists 6:35, Hello Darkness 7:55, Human Behavior 8:35, Shooting Tsars (TX) 9:15, Fun Abuse (CA) 9:55, Suspicious Activity 10:35.\n\nWho: Modern Leisure album release w/Down Time and shark dreams\n\nWhen: Saturday, 07.14, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Syntax Physic Opera\n\nWhy: Indie pop band Modern Leisure is celebrating the release of its new album, Super Sad Rom-Com. As usual, Casey Banker’s songs are well crafted pop gems with lyrics that are self-deprecating but never maudlin. This time around Banker seems to have a chuckle at the excesses and absurdities of life in America now and navigating interpersonal hurdles while finding it all a bit wearisome. Banker’s employment of melancholic tones has always been good but with Super Sad Rom-Com he’s taken it to places he hasn’t before with his keen ear for emotional and tonal nuance. Also on the bill is Down Time who have quietly been one of the most interesting pop bands out of Denver since its inception two or three years ago combining the intimacy of folk, rock and an experimental streak born of needing to do things in your own way with available equipment and personnel like a drummer/bassist at one point. Not unlike a Young Marble Giants but one that could only have happened in the Twenty-First century.\n\nWho: SPELLS (album release) w/Cheap Perfume, Future Perfect, People Corrupting People\n\nWhen: Saturday, 07.14, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: SPELLS is putting out its odds and sods album Loose Change, Vol. 1 at this show. The band’s joke, and song, is “80% is Good Enough” and isn’t it really? Forget that oh so American overpromising, boastful nonsense that seems to be an angstrom of our president’s ego and narcissism. Trying too hard without adequate compensation makes chumps of everyone. At any rate, the Denver-based punk band is releasing the compilation through guitarist Chuck Coffey’s scrappy little label Snappy Little Numbers as well as Chicago imprint Anxious and Angry. On red vinyl. So get them while you can. The other bands on the bill are pretty alright too including Colorado Springs’ unabashedly fun feminist punk band Cheap Perfume. At this point having to say a band is feminist seems redundant and regressive because it’s a perspective that should be the part of the thinking and ethos of anyone in America in this century and if not, do some catching up. Maybe start slow and check out some bell hooks, Betty Friedan, Adrienne Rich, Clarissa Pinkola Estés and Inga Muscio. It could happen.\n\nSunday | July 15, 2018\n\nWho: Jackie Cohen w/Jobless and Hillary Susz\n\nWhen: Sunday, 07.15, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Jackie Cohen just put out her first proper music EP, 2018’s Tacoma Night Terror Part 1. If you’ve spent any time in Tacoma this might be a truthfully humorous exaggeration of a memory from time spent there. For a Colorado specific reference, big stretches of Tacoma are a lot like Commerce City and Thornton but even more worn out with blocks of dubious legitimacy. Cohen’s songs may have some connection to that vibe on some level. The recordings sound older like finding a well-listened to pop cassette from the 70s including the hiss. But none of these songs could really have come out back then. It’s the post-jaded self-discovery vibe that Cohen nails that makes the best Fleetwood Mac songs worth listening to after enduring repeated broadcast of those songs on the radio or friends who never had to experience that music the first time getting obsessed with entire too much music that came out of artists who were entirely too familiar with cocaine and quaaludes. Cohen’s performance isn’t jaded and that’s what makes the difference. She sounds like she’s been through it, man, but finds that dulled emotions don’t work for her and that life must go on even if you’re not over the pain of a bad experience in relationships and other disappointments in life. That you get to see Denver’s great folky, experimental indie rock trio Jobless is more than a bonus, it would be reason enough to go.\n\nWhat: Compost Heap 3 Day 3\n\nWhen: Sunrday, 07.15, 3 p.m.\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: This is the third and final day of Compost Heap. Less on the folk punk side this day with the likes of hip-hop artist Adam Selene, noise punks Plasma Canvas and hard rock band The Velveteers but the ethos is one shared between the artists. Today’s schedule (all times being p.m.): open mic 3, Patrick the Pirate 4, Adam Selene 4:40, Queen Ren Faire Dance Party (TX) 5:20, Davey Dynamite (IL) 6, Bert Olsen 7:15, Wayfairy 7:55, Ludlow 8:35, Dandelion Massacre (CA) 9:15, Plasma Canvas 9:55, The Velveteers 10:35\n\nWhat: Final Show at The Climax Lounge\n\nWhen: Sunrday, 07.15, 4 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Climax Lounge\n\nWhy: A Taste of Denver to most 80s punks, The Raven to punks in the 90s and in the 2000s mostly The Climax Lounge (its original name), this building at 2217 Welton Street was one of the most important venues for a real underground music world in Denver. It will be knocked down to build yet another shitty, cheaply built condo that downtown doesn’t need or maybe yet another brewery or some other Nü Denver crap that has become the inevitable for all the cool, historic buildings that made Denver a worthwhile and interesting place to live and make art and music for decades. It’s not the nail in the coffin by any means and it hasn’t been a terrible active music venue in years but for many it’s like seeing your favorite high school hangout get the axe. The bands playing on such short notice include the following: Sputnik Slovenia, Scooter James, The Narrow Down, Bourbon Brawlers, Dangerous Friends and National Blues Arsenal.\n\nMonday | July 16, 2018\n\nWho: Marisa Anderson w/Howling Hex and Cuckoo\n\nWhen: Monday, 07.16, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Marisa Anderson’s masterful, expressive, guitarwork, on mostly instrumental songs, evokes moods, landscapes and memories in a way more vivid and emotionally immediate than many artists. One might consider her music in the realm of folk but in the more experimental vein of a John Fahey or Michael Hurley. Her 2018 album Cloud Corner finds Anderson sketching in different ways with her guitar, more impressionistic than solid, if intricate, lines. She shares the bill with Colorado-based Howling Hex whose music is a hypnotic, for lack of a better word, avant-garde Mariachi/norteño band led by Neil Michael Hagerty whose legacy of experimental guitar music includes his stints with influential bands like Pussy Galore and Royal Trux as well as noise super group Dan’l Boone. Cuckoo pretty much blurs the line between noise rock, punk and mathy-folk.\n\nWho: Unknown Mortal Orchestra w/Shamir\n\nWhen: Monday, 07.16, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Ruban Nielson probably could have enjoyed a respectable career in music in his home country playing in his Flying Nun-signed band The Mint Chicks. But New Zealand is a small place and Nielson relocated to Portland, Oregon as he and his brother Kody have dual citizenship with their mom having been a hula dancer from Hawaii. Their new band Unknown Mortal Orchestra, formed in 2010, had that quality of just off of standard guitar rock that seems to be the hallmark of all New Zealand Bands but it also introduced a kind of psychedelic flavor that wasn’t basically following what would become a popular musical trend in America and elsewhere. UMO had crafted its own flavor of transporting music that suggested a parallel dimension where pop music could reconcile atonality, unusual shifts in rhythm the likes of which one might expect out of one of the weirder prog bands like Can or Faust. UMO has done well enough and produced a solid body of work up to and including the 2018 album Sex & Food. Lead single “Hunnybee” with its yacht rock leanings probably confused some fans because it sounds a bit like an old Foxygen track but the whole album has plenty of UMO’s wonderful weirdness.\n\nWednesday | July 18, 2018\n\nWho: Neurosis w/Converge and Birds in Row\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 07.18, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: The Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: Neurosis evolved out of the San Francisco Bay area’s post-punk/hardcore scene and its earliest albums have more in common with the likes of English anarcho punk bands like Amebix and Crass than perhaps some of their hometown’s well-known punk luminaries. Yet by 1992 the group had garnered the interest of former Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra who mixed that year’s Neurosis record, the decidedly more metal Souls at Zero. Neurosis has since then established itself firmly as a powerful live act whose records have pushed the boundaries of metal, hardcore and psychedelic music more than almost another other single band. Most of the truly interesting and innovative modern extreme metal bands can trace a strand of influence to Neurosis. Tourmates Converge were pioneering their own form of metal and hardcore crossover in Salem, Massachusetts. By 2001, the group had developed a particularly savage and precise form of posthardcore whose sound and aesthetic permeates a good deal of the extreme metal of today as well as any hardcore band that wants to taken seriously. Its live shows are legendarily intense and be prepared for the cascade of would-be stage divers and crowd surfers.\n\nWho: Greg Hill presents the Zebra Skin Shirt release\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 07.18, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Tattered Cover – Colfax location\n\nWhy: Former Six Months to Live and current Manotaur frontman Greg Hill will present the release of his latest novel, Zebra Skin Shirt, the third and final installment in the Stratford County trilogy all set in Colorado (including 2012’s East of Denver and 2015’s The Lonesome Trials of Johnny Riles). Hill’s gift for incorporating the supernatural and even science fiction concepts into deeply personal novels about people struggling with their personal shortcomings in life and in their relationships or attempts thereof are always incredibly engaging and entertaining brimming with Hill’s vivid descriptions, sense of humor and attention to detail whether that’s in recreating past Denver and Joes, Colorado locations or intricacies of plot. Zebra Skin Shirt may be Hill’s most unusual novel to date and his best. If you have to miss the release it’s easy to find the book online including at Amazon.\n\nWho: Chief White Lightning w/Keef Duster\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 07.18, 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Josh Logan may be cultivating that look somewhere between Elvis, Zach Galifianakis and Joaquin Phoenix from I’m Still Here, but seeing as he is a member of Austin stoner rock band Blind Pets, his music pleasantly flies in the face of the expectations one might have just looking at his stage persona. The band’s fuzzy, poppy punk and country mix shouldn’t work and the kitsch should render it difficult to take seriously but the group’s new self-titled album is impossible to dismiss as anything but a great rock and roll album with more diversity of sound and songwriting style than a lot of bands who have delved into modern rock and roll.\n\nOctober continues to be the busiest live music month for Denver but one with few if any festivals, thank goodness. As usual here are several offerings worthy of your attention.\n\nThursday: October 19, 2017\n\nWho: Din Virulent & MGNLP w/Rasmussen and Juice Up\n\nWhen: Thursday, 10.19, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: 7th Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: This is basically a harsh noise show but one thing lost on people that either actively despise it or don’t get it at all is that most noise artists are completely unlike every other noise artist. Juice Up has some disorienting arrangements of samples and sounds that’s something like a completely unconventional rhythm but there is a humorous playfulness there. Rasmussen is John Rasmussen of Denver noise legends Page 27. Rasmussen’s solo output is so diverse in texture and tone that even his “harsh” noise sets tend to have a subtlety and nuance that suggests the serious composition and planning that undergirds sounds that aren’t trying to fit at all into a pop song format. Din Virulent sounds like what happens when you chain a few delay pedals together and have them feed back off each other while manipulating the signal for an effect like watching white noise on TV if that image was sound and occasionally felt like it was aggressively charging out at you.\n\nFriday: October 20, 2017\n\nWho: Tera Melos w/Speedy Ortiz, Holophrase and Meet Me In Montauk\n\nWhen: Friday, 10.20, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: Tera Melos might be one of the more misunderstood bands of the last several years because it sounds like its member spent some time playing in one of Trey Spruance’s projects: lots of unusual rhythms and dynamics requiring a precise musicianship while not sounding too in the pocket; heavy guitars, disorienting tones and an alternating driving and and hanging melodies. Its 2017 album, Trash Generator, is like a math rock shoegaze album with a touch of brutal psychedelia. In that way Tera Melos could be said to be a bit of a musical cousin to noise rock phenoms Deerhoof. Speedy Ortiz sounds like it picked up where The Breeders and Throwing Muses left off in the mid-to-late 90s with captivating, fuzzy melodic songs that take a walk out of every day mundane life while commenting on that life with with and sensitivity. Holophrase is a Denver band that has come out of being a guitar-based indie rock band (albeit one that didn’t sound much like anything contemporary and only slightly like Magazine) into being a mostly electronics-based band with deep atmospheres and Malgorzata Stacha’s layered vocal melodies serving as an emotional and sonic locus for the group’s hypnotic, chilly soundscapes.\n\nWho: Thurston Moore w/The Diary of Ic Explura\n\nWhen: Friday, 10.20, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: It is indeed Thurston Moore of influential No-Wave-and-punk-inflected rock band Sonic Youth. His new album, Rock and Roll Consciousness, showcases Moore’s gift for writing moody pop songs bolstered by dynamic and complex yet tasteful guitar work. It’s melancholy stuff but much of Moore’s best material is yet he also manages to lend his songwriting a thoughtfulness not mired by despair. He can create a gritty image and imbue it with some future hopefulness not yet obvious in the moment he documents in his words—being in the moment but knowing that you can never fully get stuck there unless you try really hard. The Diary of Ic Explura is Toni Oswald’s ambient, sound collage experiments that she sculpts into coherent songs by adding instrumentation to elements that aren’t necessarily inherently musical. Like musique concrète with a soundtrack. Which is nothing new in the world of avant-garde music but Oswald’s vibrant and transporting music demonstrates well how noise and composition can work together.\n\nWho: The Juan MacLean\n\nWhen: Friday, 10.20, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bar Standard\n\nWhy: Deep Club 3rd Fridays brings The Juan MacLean to a relatively small venue. John MacLean’s first chapter in influential music came with his tenure as a guitarist for Providence, Rhode Island-based, experimental post-hardcore band Six Finger Satellite. The band was an early practitioner of fusing electronic elements with the usual punk rock instrumentation and operating in the same musical realm as bands like Arab On Radar, Lightning Bolt and Mindflayer—though predating them all. When SFS split near the turn of the century, MacLean left music for a few years before Six Finger Satellite’s sound engineer, James Murphy (who some may know"
