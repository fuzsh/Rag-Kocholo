        "text": "\"Kat McGivern-\"Kamikaze Heart\"\"\n\nHere's another great voice which was recently brought to my attention by LaFamos (thank you Sarah), the marketing agents behind so many independent music artists and when they serve up artists such as today's, it brings a huge smile to my dial.\n\nKat McGivern - who the hell is that, I hear you asking. Well - let me assure you that after you listen to this young lady, you'll be telling others about her. She has just released her new seven track EP, which isn't her first musical release, and I was really disappointed with it. Why have I just built her up and then told you that I was disappointed with her album? Because there were supposed to be seven songs in my kit, but there were only five - and after listening to them several times, I wanted more.*\n\nOn to Kat's music, which really is the furtherest thing from being disappointing - if you're American, and you're a New York Yankees fan, then you'll be disturbed to learn that Kat is based in Boston - but let's leave sport aside and concentrate on her music. When her voice started leaving my speakers, I immediately thought I was listening to a modern day Doloros O'Riordan, of The Cranberries fame - those lilting notes amongst all that sweet music sounded so much like Doloros it wasn't funny. Whilst the music was playing, I commenced reading up on this talented singer and I saw that she counts the Cranberries amongst her influences - she certainly should, as you'll see when you start listening (if you haven't already). Another person whom she reminds me of is Danielle Spencer, whom I blogged back in February of this year.\n\nApart from being quite a talented songwriter and singer, Kat has also decided to branch out and launch her own line of jewelry and other non-musical things, but she says that music will always remain her passion.\n\nOkay - after all that, my advice would be to get over to one of her sites and check her out some more - and to save you looking all over the place for her links, I've included a couple of them below.\n\n- Stonefish's music blog\n\n\"Kat McGivern\"\n\nWhen we ask an artist the question, “what else would you be doing if it weren’t for music?” we often get answers like “nothing – music is all I know.” The artist knows what it wants to do with his/her life, to be sure. But Boston native Kat McGivern let us know that music is her purpose, without the aforementioned question. She says, “I’m not sure if I am onto something now, but music is a compulsion. Everything I do ends up being a song. I write a couple of songs a week and I can’t imagine not doing it.” Kat takes her devotion a step further – she isn’t involved in music because that’s all she’s good at – she’s in it because she has no choice. She needs to do it. It’s wired from her brain to vocal chords to her fingertips.\n\nMcGivern has a new EP out titled “Kamikaze Heart”, the follow-up to “Armor” and “Alice Lost”. We asked the New Englander to get into it: “’Kamikaze Heart’ is about my life. Being young I have chosen to love with reckless abandon, and to live my life with no regrets and it’s given me a lot of material to work with. Anthony Resta of Bopnique Musique produced the album and we were able to carve out a very cool unique sonic landscape to tell those stories.” Check out the record – it’s pure listening. And look into Kat’s jewelry line “Labeled” as well as the next release, “Kandy Pop”. Before all of this though, keep reading for all the answers to the XXQ’s.\n\nXXQs: Kat McGivern\n\nPEV: How would you describe your sound and what do you feel makes you stand out over the others in your genre?\n\nKat McGivern (KM): I started out as a singer songwriter and I feel like I still am. I just use synths, drum machines and loud guitars. The mix of sounds in my music is definitely unique.\n\nPEV: Calling Boston, Massachusetts home, what kind of music where you into growing up? Was anyone your main influence?\n\nKM: When I was growing up I sang Celtic music and classical music in church. I started at five years old. In junior high school I began to get into rock music and play in coffee houses. I worshiped Bob Dylan and Ani Difranco and I still do. I am fascinated by the ways in which they can turn a phrase so that it sounds so familiar yet completely fresh.\n\nPEV: You quit college to start your own musical career. What went through your head to make that decision?\n\nKM: I think I had to stop using my head to make that decision. I was miserable trying to be something I am not, and working on a “career” that I didn’t want. I just wanted to play music.\n\nPEV: Do you remember the first time you thought to yourself – “I am really onto something!”\n\nKM: I’m not sure if I am onto something now, but music is a compulsion. Everything I do ends up being a song. I write a couple of songs a week and I can’t imagine not doing it. I just hope that people can relate to the things I am writing about because at the end of the day it’s really about reaching the fans and giving them insight into their own emotions.\n\nPEV: What can fans expect from a live Kat McGivern show?\n\nKM: Coming out of the coffee house circuit I love to talk about the songs as I play them. So at shows you can expect to hear stories about where the song came from. Also I love to throw out new songs at all of my shows. So in addition to the Album material you can usually expect to hear something new.\n\nPEV: What is the first thing that comes to mind when you step on stage?\n\nKM: Let’s get this party started!!! Playing shows is just fun, you can’t think about anything too serious when you are playing.\n\nPEV: Tell us about your line of jewelry and even photography you’ve taken up.\n\nKM: The Jewelry line is called Labeled. I am really excited about it. It’s a lot of plastic and industrial materials; sort of steam punk meets disco queen. I really love big clunky jewelry so it’s a lot of that. I recently got my first camera and I am becoming an armature shutterbug. I love being able to take pictures and actually have a hobby. When I am stressed I stay up all night and play with photo shop, it’s great!\n\nPEV: What was the underlining inspiration for your music? Where do get your best ideas for songs?\n\nKM: Most of my songs are from things I have gone through personally. One of the songs on Kamikaze Heart everyone thinks is a love song but it’s actually about an old boss I had who was really cruel to his staff. At the time I thought I could make being around him more bearable if I wrote a song about him. I wrote Napoleon on Thursday and quit the following Wednesday. Some of my other songs are about friend’s relationships, or relationship themes we have discussed.\n\nPEV: Tell us about your latest release, \"Kamikaze Heart”. What can fans expect from this work?\n\nKM: Kamikaze Heart is about my life. Being young I have chosen to love with reckless abandon, and to live my life with no regrets and it’s given me a lot of material to work with. Anthony Resta of Bopnique Musique produced the album and we were able to carve out a very cool unique sonic landscape to tell those stories.\n\nPEV: Do you ever find yourself getting writer’s block and if so, how do you get over that?\n\nKM: Someday that might happen and Ill probably get more sleep. As I have learned more and more about structuring songs the song ideas come more frequently. The last song I wrote I had a dream about the song title and the next day I wrote it.\n\nPEV: What’s one thing we’d be surprised to hear about Kat McGivern?\n\nKM: I was a super dork growing up; I was very into science and classical music. Now I am still a dork but I am into very different things.\n\nPEV: Was there a certain point in your life when you knew that music was going to be a career for you?\n\nKM: I was 11 and it was the first time I played guitar and sang for a group of people. It was at a school function and I was very scared. My mother’s best friend told me, “Don’t be afraid because you have a gift to give the world and it’s not about you”. Ever since then I knew that this was what I need to do with my life. From that moment on I realized that music is not about the person making it, it’s about the person listening to it.\n\nPEV: What one word best describes Kat McGivern?\n\nKM: Quirky.\n\nPEV: How is life on the road for you in the music world? Best and worst parts?\n\nKM: The best part is being able to write songs all the time. The worst part is sometimes missing things with the people you love. Music keeps you very busy.\n\nPEV: Is there one area you wish you could travel around and play that you have not yet?\n\nKM: I want to travel the world. I am dying to get to the point where I have a world tour but as of yet I have not left the country.\n\nPEV: How have all your friends and family reacted to your career? What’s it like when you get to play at your hometown?\n\nKM: Some of my friends ask me when I am getting a “real job” and some of them show up to shows really angry that they haven’t seen me in awhile. But I still have so many of my hometown friends that they are usually backstage with me. My family is great. My little brother is in a band called the sign off and when he’s not in school he even comes and plays with me.\n\nPEV: What can we find you doing in your spare time, aside from playing/writing music?\n\nKM: I have spare time? Where? Just kidding! I love spending time with my family and I am a shop-a-holic so I tend to be out looking for new fashions when I have spare time.\n\nPEV: Is there an up and coming band or artist you think we should all be looking out for now?\n\nKM: There are tons of great bands coming out of Boston right now. Small Talk, The Sign Off, the Cinnamon Fuzz, Casey Desmond, and Naked on Roller-skates just to name a few.\n\nPEV: If you weren’t playing music now what do you think you would be doing as your career?\n\nKM: I would be a professional mental patient. Music is really the only career I have.\n\nPEV: So, what is next for Kat McGivern?\n\nKM: Well right now I am working a new album called Kandy pop. It’s an upbeat pop rock project that I started with my friend Andy Tats. When we started writing the songs for KAndy pop I kept thinking to myself, this is bubble gum pop! I love it. Then we got the idea of KAndy pop.\n\nFor more on Kat McGivern, check out: www.katmcgivern.com - Pens Eye View\n\n\"Kat McGivern review & giveaway\"\n\nlove music, I listen to it while at the grocery store, driving in the car and often times when I am cleaning house! When you hear an artist that you love, what do you usually do? I share!\n\nKat McGivern is a sassy, spunky, fun and talented musician. She not only sings, plays guitar and the keyboard, she is an awesome songwriter too. She is Boston based and started her career at 13, performing at local mic nights. Kat taught herself traditional Gaelic ballads and shortly after started classical training. She eventually abandoned classical music and college to record her first album. She then quit music for two years to go back to school and realized that it was music she loved.\n\n'Kamikaze Heart' was released November 23, 2010 along with 7 other songs. 'Kamikaze Heart' is about her inability to walk away from the things she loves. It reached the Top 10 on FMQB's AC Top 40 chart.\n\nKat said, 'I see myself a bohemian Judy Jetson with a bad attitude,' and that's how I would describe her and her music. Bohemian but with a good attitude! Her unique sound is what makes me love her and her music. - Ma21Cuteboy\n\n\"Kat McGivern- My Kamikaze Heart Album Review\"\n\nKat McGivern's newest album, My Kamikaze Heart, was released November 23, 2010.\n\nI was given the opportunity to review the album and I love it! There are 7 songs on the album\n\nand I loved them all.\n\nTracks:\n\n1. Kamikaze Heart\n\n2. Dance with the Devil\n\n3. Label Me\n\n4. We're Just Keystrokes\n\n5. Fall to Pieces\n\n6. Decorated\n\n7. Napoleon\n\nKamikaze Heart has reached the Top 10 on FMQB's AC Top 40 chart. I can sure believe this as I\n\nfind myself humming it all day long.\n\nKat McGiven is not afraid to tell you what she thinks, and you'll definitely want to listen.\n\nThis is included in my info sheet that came with the album. I do believe this is true by\n\nlistening to the lyrics on the album. I love a line in the song \"We're Just Keystrokes\" that\n\nsays \"forget it boy, this bootie don't call\".\n\nKat McGivern says, \"I see myself as a bohemian Judy Jetson with a bad attitude.\" In a sea of\n\ncookie-cutter pop stars, this is one girl who's not afraid to stand out. (as I stated before,\n\nI can see just how true this is by the lyrics of the songs on this album)\n\nHere are some places you will find Kat McGivern online:\n\nhttp://www.katmcgivern.com (join the mailing list to listen to tracks free!)\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/katmcgivern (submit email to get the full version of the song Kamikaze\n\nHeart)\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/KatMcGivernMusic?v=app_2405167945 (here you can listen to the song\n\n\"Label Me\" as well as find lyrics to some of her other song. Well worth the look see and to\n\nfan!)\n\nI will close by saying again how much I enjoyed listening to this album. I've listened to it\n\nseveral times, in fact, over the past few days. And, I will have it as a regular cd to listen\n\nto. I've not seen this before, but when I play the CD in my car, it shows the title of each\n\nsong before it starts playing. I thought this was cool, and it may not be new, but I've not\n\nseen that it before with any other cd's I've played.\n\nThe beat to the songs is great. If you like pop music, I highly recommend this album. - Marsha's Blog Spot\n\n\"Kat McGivern\"\n\nKat McGivern is not afraid to tell you what she thinks, and you’ll definitely want to listen.\n\nThe Boston-based firecracker began her music career at age 13, performing at a local open mic night. Growing up in a family of musicians, Kat initially taught herself traditional Gaelic ballads and started classical training shortly after. Eventually her influences shifted to Bob Dylan, The Cranberries and the ultimate image chameleon, Madonna.\n\nAbandoning classical music in college, she released her first album Armor followed by the more rock-influenced Alice Lost. Her overwhelming passion for what matters to her became a running theme in her songwriting when it came time to pen tracks for her latest EP.\n\n“I dropped out of college so I could record my first album. Then I quit music for two years to bartend and go back to school,” Kat explains. “I realized that I couldn’t walk away from music. So I recorded My Kamikaze Heart, about my inability to walk away from the things I love.”\n\nReleased on November 23, 2010, the 7-song EP was produced by Anthony J. Resta and features the brass, assertive title track, which reached the Top 10 on FMQB’s AC Top 40 chart.\n\nAlready a multi-instrumentalist, tackling everything from vocals to guitar and keyboards, and a prolific songwriter, Kat is always looking for new outlets for her boundless creativity. She’s finalizing the launch of her own line of jewelry and trying her hand at photography. But music will always be her passion.\n\n“I see myself a bohemian Judy Jetson with a bad attitude,” boasts Kat McGivern. In a sea of cookie-cutter pop stars, this is one girl who’s not afraid to stand out. - Flip Side To Music\n\n\"in which a kamikaze heart is a straight up piece of guilty pleasure pop\"\n\nin which a kamikaze heart is a straight up piece of guilty pleasure pop\n\nso, a number of years ago now, i used to torture the husband with mandy moore's candy. being the hipster music snob he is, he would give me these deep, long looks of despair and disapproval and mutter things like, \"i thought you had taste,\" and \"my respect for you has slipped some.\"\n\nhe was mostly kidding.\n\nbut the plain truth of it is, candy was so cheesy it was FUN. it wasn't going to win a pulitzer for deep thoughts (not that music wins, but you know what i mean), but it made me happy to listen to it. it made me feel bouncy and want to laugh and enjoy myself.\n\nso, i couldn't help but remember that song when i first heard kamikaze heart by kat mcgivern. the two songs sound nothing alike - don't misunderstand me here - but they both give that sort of feeling of fizzy drink in your tummy, car windows open, singing it loud with your best friends while having a great afternoon kind of vibe.\n\nhere's what mcgivern, a self-described \"bohemian judy jetson with a bad attitude\" (HELLO, who can resist that description?), has to say about the song: “I dropped out of college so I could record my first album.

On Songs: Kat McGivern - “Kamikaze Heart\"\"\n\nA common criticism of pop music is that it is polished and airbrushed and manipulated to the point of soullessness. Kat McGivern has a nice voice. She is pretty. We bet she smells nice too. The thing about McGivern is that while she has nice makeup; we bet she puts it on herself and does her own stunts as well. Listening to McGivern’s vocal performance is like watching a skilled gymnast work all sorts of impossible moves with uncanny grace, but the gymnast has a tattoo and curses occasionally.\n\nThe focal point of “Kamikaze Heart” is obviously McGivern’s liquid-golden vocal performance. Her voice is sweetly strong, landing on any note she chooses like an exceptionally well-balanced cat that would never, ever end up on America’s Funniest Home Videos for falling off the television set. McGivern rides the mix of “Kamikaze Heart” like a skateboard, expertly leaning her melodies this way and that to turn the corners of the melody and keep the song moving. Her Celtic influences also shine through from time to time, in a lilt that breaks gently upward into the stratosphere of the song’s register.\n\nThe melody serves as an able vehicle for the vocal, making sure that the hook sets in the proper spot (that would be the title of the song as the recurring phrase in the chorus). The chorus displays a sense of style, with a slight rest in the second half that lets the song pause and then catch up with itself. The tempo is crisp and mobile, adding an extra bit of zing to an already peppy track.\n\n- Boston Band Crush\n\n\"INTERVIEW: Kat McGivern\"\n\nBekka Collins: For those who don’t know, could you introduce yourself and tell us how you got started in music?\n\nKat McGivern: My name is Kat and I make music. I started playing music in church when I was five years old, and I never stopped. I can’t remember when I first started writing songs; I think maybe I was seven.\n\nBC: What made you abandon your classical roots to focus on more pop / rock music?\n\nKMG: Classical music is so much about the pursuit of perfection where as pop music embraces the imperfect. I like making noise. Sometimes I like playing things that aren’t perfect and because they’re not perfect they make you feel something.\n\nBC: You dropped out of college to create your first album Amor, how do you think your sound has changed from then to now?\n\nKMG: When I left school I had no idea about song writing, or production. It was my first time in a recording studio, and I had no clue what I was doing. Since then I’ve spent all of my time honing my craft.\n\nBC: Musically and lyrically, where does your inspiration come from?\n\nKMG: My songs are about my life and the people I love. Most of my songs are experiences I have had but some of them are experiences the people closest to me have had.\n\nBC: How do you think fans have responded to your latest album, My Kamikaze Heart?\n\nKMG: I think some people are shocked that it’s so much more pop and less rock. My last album was extremely dark and this album is extremely optimistic so I think that’s a lot different than what my fans were used to. Most of my fans seem to have really embraced the new record but at the end of the day you have to write what’s in your heart, I’m just not that pessimistic anymore.\n\nBC: For someone who has never listened to you before, what tracks of yours would you suggest to them?\n\nKMG: Personally ‘Dance With The Devil’ is my favorite. I wrote it after reading a Cosmo article about how many sexual partners women have had. Out of 10 women only one woman didn’t apologize for her number being too low or high. She said “13, so what! I met my husband”. I found it to be really profound that as women we are expected to apologize for the choices we make no matter what those choices are. So I wrote ‘Dance With The Devil’ about how sometimes you have to be absolutely wrong before you figure out what is right for you.\n\nBC: What are three things we can expect from a Kat McGivern live show?\n\nKMG: 1. I almost always bust out my guitar and play an acoustic song. Often it’s a brand new song too. 2. I like to tell stories about where the songs come from. 3. Fans can expect to dance, laugh, cry, and have a good time!\n\nBC: What makes you different to the other female artists within the industry?\n\nKMG: I write all of my songs, and I have a huge role in the production of my songs/images/shows.\n\nBC: What can you tell us about your own line of jewelry?\n\nKMG: I’m a clothes and accessories hound! Whenever I play live or go out people ask me where they can get my accessories so I am going to be selling them. The line is called labeled and it’s a mix of steam punk and disco pieces.\n\nBC: Is there anything else you would like to add?\n\nKMG: I have a new record coming out this summer called KAndy pop and I am planning to hit the road soon so check www.katmcgivern.com for updates. Thank you so very much The Sound Alarm for talking with me today and helping to get the word out - The Sound Alarm\n\n\"KAT MCGIVERN REPRESENTS WHAT STOLI LOVES ABOUT POP MUSIC\"\n\nKAT MCGIVERN REPRESENTS WHAT STOLI LOVES ABOUT POP MUSIC\n\nApril 12, 2011 | by Skope\n\nI will admit that I can be pretty tough on pop artists. Its not that I do not like pop music, I just don’t like when it sounds forced & manufactured. That being said, some of my favorite songs have come from the pop genre for their authentic & genuine sound. My guest today, Kat McGivern, is a pop artist from Boston who released her newest EP ‘My Kamikaze Heart’ and it is packed with songs that are catchy & show her potential to reach the masses. Just listen to her song “Label Me.” Join us as Kat talks about living in Boston, what is a kamikaze heart, working with Anthony Resta, and much more!\n\nStoli: Where are we talking from today and are you excited for spring in Boston?\n\nKat Mcgivern: Today I am writing you from old folks home recording where I am working on my next record. I can’t tell you how excited I am for spring! It has been one snowy winter in Boston! So I am looking forward to some sunshine and the summer release of my next ep.\n\nStoli: Are you from Boston and if not how did you end up in this wonderful city?\n\nKat Mcgivern: I moved here from Texas with my family when I was three. My mother’s family is all from Texas and my father’s family is primarily in Boston. It was a really cool place to grow up there is always a lot of music going on in the city.\n\nStoli: What are two favorite music venues that you play & attend in Boston?\n\nKat Mcgivern: I recently had a CD release party at the Magic Room in Brighton which is a really awesome one of a kind venue. I’m also a really big fan of TT The Bears and the Middle East in Cambridge.\n\nStoli: What does the title of your EP ‘My Kamikaze Heart’ as the EP title & song, mean?\n\nKat Mcgivern: I quit playing music between this album and my last one. My life just got too complicated and I felt like it made more sense to try and carve out a “normal” existence. I got the 9-5 job, went back to school, and was miserable. My kamikaze heart is about my inability to walk away from something I truly love. It’s about that internal conflict with what you really want and what’s best for you. At the end of the day the heart wants what the heart wants.\n\n“Kamikaze Heart” MP3:\n\nSKOPE IT HERE!\n\nStoli: What did you want to show fans new & old with this EP about what Kat is all about musically?\n\nKat Mcgivern: To me music has always been about story telling and it still is. But with this ep I really got to experiment with new sounds, it was a great experience.\n\nStoli: What song on the EP is most personal and was written based on your real life?\n\nKat Mcgivern: All of the songs on this ep are based on my real life but, I would have to say decorated is probably the most personal. I went through a traumatic event and my friends did their absolute best to be there for me. Every night we would all go out and they would freeze up and not know what to say to me. It’s like my best friends thought I was a different person. Around that time alot of people we knew started to come back from Iraq and I noticed that their friends gave them the same weird treatment. I really wanted to shake my friends and tell them that I am the same person. In the military when someone sees action they become “decorated” these experiences make them stronger. Decorated is about surviving life’s battles and being stronger for it hence the line “we’re not damaged we’re only decorated”.\n\nStoli: How was working with Anthony Resta and how did he enhance your sound & vision?\n\nKat Mcgivern: Working with Anthony was amazing!!! I learned so much from him and I will never look at music the same way again. Anthony’s studio, Bopnique musique has every cool, strange synth or instrument you can imagine. When we worked on the album we spent the days on the floor playing with toy pianos and omnichords until the sonic landscape was just right.\n\nStoli: Do you work a regular job and where would you like to be in five years?\n\nKat Mcgivern: Right now I don’t have a regular job I just graduated from Full Sail where I’ve been a full time student for the last 2 years. In five years, I would like to be still playing music. My life goal is to win a Grammy, hopefully some day I will!\n\nStoli: The world is so crazy right now. How do you stay upbeat and make such positive & high energy music?\n\nKat Mcgivern: The world is really what you make of it and I choose to believe that I can make it a better place.\n\nStoli: Do you get concerned the industry will make you corrupt your morals as a sexy female pop star?\n\nKat Mcgivern: What morals? Just kidding! I think I have a strong enough sense of who I am and where I stand so not much can change me.\n\nStoli: What is coming up for you & where are you online?\n\nKat Mcgivern: Right now I am trying to get plans together to get out on the road. My next ep is coming out in the early summer and it’s called KAndy pop. KAndy pop is a really poppy danceable project that I wrote with my good friend Andy Tats.

The crystalline beauty and emotional force of McGivern’s Celtic-tinged vocals, reminiscent of the Cranberries or Beth Orton, is backed with a winning balance of anthemic, guitar-driven production (“Burn it Down”) and lush electronic beats and keys (“Alice Lost”). Of course it would be nothing without McGivern’s solid, powerful songwriting.\n\nAlice Lost tells the story of a young woman’s odyssey into the adult world, with its realities, illusions, and inevitable heartbreaks. “I’ve always been interested in storytelling,” explains McGivern. “Our lives are really just a series of stories, they’re how we learn about the world and try to make sense of our own experiences.”\n\nKat McGivern began hitting the Boston-area singer songwriter circuit in 2004 at the young age of 19. In the fall of that year she released her debut album, the self-produced “Armor.” The album created a considerable buzz on Garageband.com, with the track “Buttons and Zippers” becoming a featured Track of the Day and earning awards for Best Female Vocals, Best Guitars, Best Lyrics, Most Original, Best Melody, and Best Bitter Break-Up Song. A steady performing schedule coupled with aggressive Internet promotion through sites like Garageband and and MySpace have already earned this relative newcomer an incredibly loyal and far-flung fanbase.\n\nMcGivern is currently booking a busy summer schedule of performance dates to promote Alice Lost.\n\nFor tour updates, contact information and media downloads, please visit www.katmcgivern.com ###\n\n- PRESS RELEASE\n\n\"Kat McGivern\"\n\nShe has a sweet face and feminine charm, making Kat McGivern proof that you can't judge a book by its cover. Looking at Kat, one might expect her musical style to be of the light and airy variety, but that thought could not be more off base.\n\nHer music is powerful, melodic and it lures you in with its magnetic, often dark undertones. For someone just 22 years of age, Kat McGivern will blow you away with the craft and maturity of both her lyrics and vocal style. Her voice shifts in pitch like Dido's, has the dramatic flair of Amy Lee's, and can morph into a Shakira-style holler at the drop of a hat.\n\nShe seems to favor a poppy, active rock flavor of backing music, with slight electronic twists, and incorporates her personal, coming-of-age struggles and triumphs into her poetic lyrics. In the title track off her latest EP, Alice Lost, McGivern masterfully spins aspects of stories about the adventurous women found in classic fantasy stories, (Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, and Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz) into a journey from the innocence of youth to the perils of adulthood.\n\nRemnants of Joni Mitchell, Alanis Morissette, and Dolores O'Riordan can be heard throughout the bulk of McGivern's library of music, but not in a copycat fashion. She has a delivery and style all her own, one that will stand up strong when compared to such venerable female vocalists.\n\nKat McGivern is certainly following in the footsteps of greatness, with her innovative lyrics and passionate vocals. If she keeps on this path, which we assume she will, her full-length will no doubt make for a rewarding listen, one that BTR can't wait to hear.\n\nListen up for Kat's music, right here on BTR and check her out online!\n\nLink to this article:\n\nhttp://www.breakthruradio.com/index.php?b=artist.php?id=121\n\n- Emily Smith - Emily Smith Break Thru Radio"
