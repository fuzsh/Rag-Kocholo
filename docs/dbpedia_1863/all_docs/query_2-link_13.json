        "text": "Of all the Boston bands that ever played dense, polyrhythmic music while spraying their crowd with sticky goo and shaving audience members’ heads, the Bentmen were clearly the best.\n\nAfter a decade on ice, the Bentmen’s unholy cross of progressive rock, guerrilla theater and punk attitude will rise again tonight at Once in Somerville.\n\n“Our agitators will create mayhem while the band makes its maelstrom of sound,” promised mastermind William “Des” Desmond. “It’s loud, it’s messy, and at times, it’s progressive. We’re going to pack everything we can into an hour and 20 minutes, which is usually as long as people can stand it.”\n\nThe reunion show will feature a dozen of the players who were part of the Bentmen’s orbit going back to 1982, including three drummers and two guitarists (among the returning members are drummer Paul Robicheau and “human prop” Tracey Stark, respectively better known in town as a music journalist and college-radio DJ).\n\nIt’s also a family affair, as the Bentmen, including Desmond’s wife, Kathy, on keyboards, will be joined by their daughter, electronic pop artist Casey Desmond, whose band CMB also includes her sister Mary Lee on vocals. It will be the first gig the family’s done together.\n\n“Growing up around the Bentmen and (Des’ Brighton-based recording studio) the Sound Museum definitely influenced me,” Casey said. “It taught me about approaching things theatrically. And sometimes I’ll hear something in a melody I write that sounds like something my parents would like. I’d have to say they’re my biggest inspirations.”\n\nCMB will open the show, and with Casey guesting during the Bentmen’s set. “That means I have to adjust to having someone onstage with that many more octaves in her range,” Des said.\n\nAccording to Kathy Desmond, the band’s hardcore fans get the political context behind the onstage mayhem.\n\n“A lot is derived from Des’ personality, his outlook on humanity and the material that he chooses to write about. It becomes a cathartic and therapeutic thing for all of us, a good way of getting it all out.”\n\nAs an example, Des cited a song called “Lobster Bib,” which was written when a stage artist threw him that title.\n\n“He painted a freakshow-type backdrop with a lobster bib, and said I could only keep it if I wrote a song to match. That took me 10 years, because what can you really say about a lobster bib? Nothing even rhymes with it. Then the anniversary of Chappaquiddick came around, and I realized that’s what it needed to be about — with the lobster bib representing Cape Cod and the Kennedy image.”\n\nThough the band members lead normal lives offstage, Kathy Desmond said that being a Bentman can catch up with you. She learned this recently in her day job, as an executive in the agriculture industry.\n\n“I’ve just started a new job and someone in a corporate meeting showed a Bentmen video. Now people are flying up from North Carolina to see what their new hire really does. I’m looking forward to blowing their minds.”\n\nThe Bentmen and CMB with Casey Desmond, at Once, 156 Highland Ave., Somerville, tonight. Tickets: $15-$18; ticketfly.com."
