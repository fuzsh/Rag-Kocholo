Her stories have been published in Midwest Review and the Rosebud Literary Magazine. She lives in southeastern Wisconsin.\n\n​Reach Her in This Light​​​​​\n\n​Jane Curtis\n\nEleanor, a strong woman who pours disastrous relationships into writing stories; Amy, radicalized by racist interactions directed toward her daughter; Maddy, taken to writing the lyrics to her own sad songs; and Louise, who is saved from despondency by her vegetable garden. Four women living in Madison, Wisconsin. Four lives woven together by Jane Curtis, in her vibrant and explorative debut. Told with flashes of song, sensuality, and sincerity, Reach Her in This Light unfolds as a fiery and empathetic mosaic of lives lived, as four women each search for their own kind of freedom.\n\n​To ​order directly from the press, email cornerstone.press@uwsp.edu​\n\n​Praise for Reach Her in This Light\n\n“Like fragments of colored glass, these brief pieces present glimmering shards of happening, moments of connection in the lives of an intriguing cast of characters who blink in and out of each other’s stories, gradually accumulating to combine into a colorfully vivid mosaic of coming of age in the Midwest in the 1960s.”\n\n—Christopher Chambers, author of Kind of Blue and Delta 88\n\n“These spare, linked, beautifully written stories rise like bread into a poetic and moving whole. Whole lives, notably less affluent women’s lives, are revealed and celebrated in their telling.”\n\n—Jeffrey D. Boldt, author of Blue Lake\n\n“Despite upheaval, these women are centered and true, never bitter or jaded. They endure husbands dying, lovers who wander in and slip off, a child’s untimely passing, adolescent rebellion and skids into poverty. Still, they reach one another, and others in the light.”\n\n—Ruth Holladay, The Indianapolis Star​\n\n​​\n\n​​Reviews & Interviews\n\nMadison Magazine ​\n\n​​\n\n$24.95 | October ​2023 | 234 pp\n\nPaperback | 979-1-960329-07-3\n\n​\n\nJODY HOBBS HESLER lives and writes in the Blue Ridge Mountain foothills. Her stories and other work have appeared in Los Angeles Review, Valparaiso Fiction Review, Necessary Fiction, CRAFT, Pithead Chapel, and elsewhere. She teaches at WriterHouse in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n​​What​ Mak​es You Think You're Supposed to Feel Better\n\nJody Hobbs Hesler​​​\n\n​The grisly death of the hermit outsider in a tight-knit neighborhood prompts a young mom to yearn for solitude. A man wrestles with regrets from a 30-year-old affair while his wife hovers toward death in the ICU. An older, childless woman aches to rescue the seemingly mistreated child she observes in the grocery store. And a girl's desire to avoid the party her father dragged her to nearly gets her abducted. Told with restraint and deep compassion against the backdrop of Virginia back streets and small towns, Jody Hobbs Hesler's debut collection shines with its portraits of longing, disconnection, and the ache for renewal and redemption that comes from our own frailties.​\n\n​​\n\nTo order directly from the press, email cornerstone.press@uwsp.edu​\n\n​Praise for What Makes You Think You're Supposed to Feel Better\n\n\"Thoughtfully crafted and skillfully realized...the collection explores surprising moments that do offer a possibility of feeling better.\"\n\n—Necessary Fiction\n\n\"If you ever met Jody Hobbs Hesler, you might find it strange that she writes about alienation, loneliness, and the tragic way people so often misunderstand each other—she is so warm and emotionally intelligent herself. It must be these qualities that give her such preternatural insight into the troubled characters of the stories in her debut collection, What Makes You Think You’re Supposed to Feel Better. These colorful figures include a repentant ex-con, a defensive hotel housekeeper, and an entitled developer with a thing for life-size candy mascots and a knack for choosing the exact wrong gifts, but what they all have in common is the struggle to empathize and see beyond their own preconceptions.\"\n\n—Rain Taxi\n\n\"Hesler's writing is carefully crafted, with plots that create suspense and often a surprising twist at the end. Although potential for horror lurks in some of the plots, it is an uplifting book that speaks about the ways people can help make each other's lives better.\"\n\n—Rivanna Review\n\n\"In this brilliant debut...Hesler demonstrates the ironic understanding of humanity, the deep compassion, and the literary skill of a serious, new fiction writer.\"\n\n—Exacting Clam​\n\n\"Eloquent, articulate, original, memorable, deftly crafted, What Makes You Think You're Supposed to Feel Better: Stories by author Jody Hobbs Hesler is a literary treat throughout and an especially and unreservedly recommended pick for personal reading lists, as well as community, and college/university library Literary Fiction & Short Story Anthology collections.\"\n\n—Midwest Book Review\n\nThere’s a loneliness running through this collection, a recognition that no matter how many people we may have in our circle, we can never fully connect with another, never quite shake that sense of detachment that comes with being an individual.\n\n—Heavy Feather Review​\n\n​​Reviews, Interviews, & Media\n\nHypertext​​Electric Literature​​​The Writer's Story​​\n\nMidwest Book Review​​​Vol. 1 Brooklyn​​Writer's Digest​​​\n\n​​BloomThe Cavalier Daily (VA)​​​​CRAFT\n\n​​Cambridge Common Writers Heavy Feather Review Exacting Clam\n\nDaily Progress Necessary Fiction GSMC Book Review\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​$21.95 | September 2024 | 98 pp\n\nPaperback | 978-1-960329-60-8​\n\nELLEN KOMBIYIL is the author of Histories of the Future Perfect (2015), and a micro chapbook, Avalanche Tunnel (2016). Recent work has appeared or is forthcoming in New Ohio Review, Nimrod, Pleiades, and Ploughshares.\n\n​She is a 2022 recipient of a BRIO Award (Bronx Recognizes Its Own) from the Bronx Council on the Arts, a two-time winner of the Mary M. Fay Poetry Award from Hunter College, a recipient of an Academy of American Poets college prize, and was awarded the Nancy Dean Medieval Prize for an essay on the acoustic quality of Chaucer’s poetics. A graduate of the University of Chicago and Hunter’s MFA program, she currently teaches writing at Hunter College.\n\n​\n\n​​Love as Invasive Species\n\nEllen Kombiyil\n\n​​​ ​\n\n​Praise for Love as Invasive Species\n\n“Ellen Kombiyil writes out of the unsettling complexity of how we see ourselves and others changing from generation to generation. From grandmother to mother to poet daughter, Kombiyil voices the shifting manners and morals of working class women as they struggle to come to terms with their own sexuality, child-rearing, domestic life, the world of work, aging, illness, physical debility, and death. Everything is put to the test in these poems, particularly the poet’s own ethical understandings as refracted through her memories of childhood and adolescence. But her ambition doesn’t stop there: she’s like Keats in her desire to live in a world of unmediated experience, in which verbally realized sensations deliver reality whole.”\n\n—Tom Sleigh, author of The King’s Touch, winner of the 2023 Paterson Poetry Prize\n\n“Ellen Kombiyil’s Love as Invasive Species follows the shames and silences through matrilineal lines. From primers on girlhood, to a coming of age’s commandments on what not to do to stay safe, Kombiyil explores the familial lessons on gender, class, and power. These inheritances sit like ghosts on the tongue until the needed prayers can be spoken and the unwritten stories given language. The poems excavate the layers of memory to discover if love is taught, inherited, or something invasive.”\n\n—Traci Brimhall, Poet Laureate of Kansas (2023-2026)\n\n“Ellen Kombiyil’s Love as Invasive Species offers absolution in the subtlest of moments: a wallet with only a nickel in it, a lover’s yakety yak, incidents from a vanished world accessorized by lo-riders and johnny gowns, made meaningful by the weight of memory and the poet’s keen, rigorous attention. Consider this a double album of anti-nostalgia: the story and the flip side/s of the story, together making up a memoir in verse that skillfully blends the narrative and the lyric. Kombiyil’s gorgeous language is a tribute to the flawed workaday heroines of a lineage: ‘Those lilies you nearly crushed,’ who endure near-biblical proportions of suffering and awe, and whose ecstasies reverberate through the generations ‘like knuckles.’”\n\n—Minal Hajratwala, author of Bountiful Instructions for Enlightenment\n\n​“The poems in Love as Invasive Species take on generations of women, the traumas they inherit, and the traumas they pass down. One can feel the collection’s speaker willing through words a correction to this pattern while also honoring from where she came, all the while staying brilliantly open-eyed and open-hearted. Designed in two sections that speak back to one another across generations, this collection does what we always hope poetry will do, which is to leave us both companioned and changed. Ellen Kombiyil has written a gorgeous book of resilience, hope, and love—especially love.”\n\n—Lynn Melnick, author of Refusenik\n\n​​​$19.95 | Septemeber 2024 | 86 pp\n\nPaperback | 978-1-960329-59-2​\n\nSARAH PAPE's award-winning poetry and prose have appeared in The New York Times, New England Review, Fourth Genre, Ecotone, Crab Orchard Review, DIAGRAM, Passages North, The Superstition Review, and many others.

In the way the cubist painters were compelled to break apart a subject in order to observe its component parts anew, Forgive the Animal alters the known shapes of rage and love, deprivation and abundance, grief and joy. With ferocious compassion for all that is overlooked and undervalued, Pape sings us toward an authentic vision of recovery.”\n\n—Lia Purpura, author of It Shouldn’t Have Been Beautiful\n\n“An origin story as painful as it is exquisite, Forgive the Animal manifests a self who has reckoned with the calamities of the past and arrived at a place of poised, tough lyricism. In poems that are candid about the brutalities of class, addiction, and desire, Sarah Pape brings together the ‘wild net’ of memory and the ‘knit stitch’ of craft to show what it means to go from wreckage to illumination, despair to sweetness. This beautiful book is ultimately about the idea of home—the home of the body, the home of family, the home of a place—and how home must be incessantly fought-for, earned, and saved.”\n\n—Rick Barot, author of Moving the Bones\n\n“In Forgive the Animal, Sarah Pape’s disarmingly beautiful new collection of poetry, we humans, and our collected experiences are allowed a fresh rebirth from the crotches of bewilderingly conjoined entities: fish scales and pigs’ feet; a bag of citrus and the tantrums of gravity; death and a tattooed rabbit; a father’s bygone hopscotch square glimpsed through the brine of amber and filth, memory and machine. What exhilarating suspensions Pape fashions! What unlikely ornaments are drowned in them, before being resurrected, a little kinked for the journey, sure, but brighter than before. Pape’s poems testify to the kind of light that—if we dare to be loyal to that which it illuminates—can stretch itself into a strange halo—sometimes fragile, sometimes badass, ever the thing through which incantation can finally pass. What an earth-shattering and awesome book.”\n\n—Matthew Gavin Frank, author of Flight of the Diamond Smugglers​\n\n​\n\n$21.95 | May 2024 | 100 pp\n\n978-1-960329-29-5 (2nd Ed.

Testimonial to human endurance and love song to the human spirit, this gem of a book, retrieved from the deep by a poet at the height of her prowess, is as wide as a ‘cavalcade of blue sky’ and as deep as ‘the blue damask of morning.’ Hold these poems up to the light to see the wide blue world (and the world in you) changed, for good.”\n\n—Robert Fanning, author of Severance\n\n“Both a tourist and an inhabitant everywhere: whether in Warsaw, Cleveland, Sarajevo, New York City, Geneva, Poughkeepsie, Oahu, or Ypsilanti, Linda Nemec Foster finds the stuff of poetry and makes it real and tangible. From ‘the thin line of horizon,’ she reminds us that ‘everything/everything is connected. Whether/we can dare to believe it or not.’”\n\n—​Laurel Blossom, author of ​Degrees of Latitude\n\n“I love the restlessness…the urgency of the poems in The Blue Divide, and their deep seriousness—how they peer into the present through layers of history, and peer into history through the lens of the personal; how they're on intimate terms with both public and private violence—and can we tell the difference, after all? Tender, brutal, unflinching, magical—these poems [are] infused with the holiness of the real and the mystery of transcendence: ‘face becoming\n\nblossom becoming starburst becoming sea.’”\n\n—Cecilia Woloch, author of Carpathia and Earth\n\nReviews, Interviews, & Media\n\nPublishers Weekly Behind the Book DMQ SalonNorth of Oxford ​South Florida Poetry Journal Kelly Fordon A Little Too Quiet\n\n​\n\n$21.95 | May 2024 | 118 pp Paperback | 978-1-960329-47-9\n\n​Margaret Rozga is a life-long Wisconsin resident and the Wisconsin Poet Laureate from 2019–2020.

I’m reminded of this fact by Rae Gouirand’s long poem The Velvet Book, whose indirect engagement with subjects yields true vision. Love, death, the past, what might yet be possible, what a self is and is not—all are strung together here like sumptuous, light-shot gems, and the couplets that carry them flow easily as brook water, page into page into page. This book is a beautiful experience.\"\n\n—Christopher Nelson\n\n\"By turns measured, sharp, slippery, and ecstatic, Rae Gouirand’s The Velvet Book is a stunning achievement. With a studious, prismatic eye (and ear), Gouirand attends to the sumptuous and mysterious folds of velvet, of the space between what we wear and who we are, of the overlap between interior and exterior. Ultimately, this book is a learned, generous, and queer meditation on commitment, on 'the question of how to stay/and then how to allow for drift,' on the marriage between the self and the other that finds itself in language and the body of the beloved.\"\n\n—Brent Armendinger\n\n\"The Velvet Book is restless, it refuses to settle. Under the cover of velvet, dreaming velvet, it feels its edges and disorientations, its zones of endlessness. Here, thought rustles and deepens, velvet-tongued, and moves us to impossibly dizzying places where everything touches. The Velvet Book is heartfelt, questing, sumptuous—a meditation on grief and love and their textures, on what is and isn’t possible to promise, on what it means to be a fully available living self.\"\n\n—Richard Siken\n\nReviews, Interviews, & Media\n\nBellingham Review\n\n​\n\n​\n\n$21.95 | April 2024 | 106 pp\n\nPaperback | 978-1-960329-38-7\n\n​\n\nJulia Paul is the author of Staring Down the Tracks (2020) and Shook (2015).

Grieving the loss of her son to opioid addiction and eventual overdose, Julia Paul questions how to move forward in the face of unspeakable loss. Poems speak to God, the coroner, and death itself. But more so, they confront death, absence, the importance, or lack thereof, of the body, and imagine the afterlife. Yet, as Paul reminds us, everyone knows grief, and sharing grief gives us the courage to live in the madness and beauty of the world, no matter the circumstance.​\n\n​​​​​\n\n​Praise for Table with Burning Candle\n\n\"Deeply moving, this requiem, this elegy chronicling the stages of grief through multiple lyric modes, these pages are as musical as they are heartbreaking.\"\n\n—Ilya Kaminsky, author of Deaf Republic\n\n\"Paul’s emotionally complex rendering of suffering and love knows, finally, that 'death creates a space that only love/can fill' and only love can give a voice.\"\n\n—Robert Cording, author of In the Unwalled City\n\n\"Inventive and beautiful.\"\n\n—Pat Hale, author of Seeing Them with My Eyes Closed\n\n\"Julia Paul’s intimate conversation with death over the loss of her son to heroin addiction presents as many answers as questions. The only question that remains is—are we too afraid of the answers? Are we too afraid to grieve? In a room of her own, Paul locks the door, dims the light, nestles into her chair and maternally awaits the affirmation within.\"\n\n—Frederick Douglass Knowles II, author of Sinking in Moonlight Alone\n\n\"Vilomah—the Sanskrit word for 'against a natural order'—is used to describe a parent who has lost a child. In Table with Burning Candle, poet Julia Paul journals that aberrant, out-of-kilter state. The mother of an adult son who died of an overdose, Paul offers us a seat at her table of grief, serving poems that vacillate between anguished and angry, hopeless and consumed with magical thinking.\"\n\n—B.

She serves as Director of International Programs and Chair of Creative Writing for Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp in Twin Lakes, Michigan.\n\n​\n\nHappy Everything\n\nCaitlin Cowan\n\nThe urge to create beauty and be beautiful haunts Happy Everything, Caitlin Cowan’s powerful celebration of feminine resilience. The materiality of marriage and divorce abound in the postnuptial ghost stories Cowan tells with no-nonsense, Midwestern frankness and the intimacy of an afterparty conversation in a corner booth. Happy Everything is a deranged wedding registry of various poetic forms which highlight the perverse tenacity of ancestral traumas and the paradoxes inherent to women’s relationships with men. These poems are a collage of traditions from a past that women are continually attempting to escape.\n\n​\n\n​Praise for Happy Everything\n\n“Caitlin Cowan has written the kind of book women poets were once warned against. Plathian in its ferocious truth-telling, it refuses to be shushed, spinning narratives of cheating fathers and husbands, of men with ‘rabbit-rattlesnake / risotto’ on their breath. Cowan brilliantly frames the poems via epigraphs from a cooking and etiquette manual, and offers a sequence of prose poems titled after relics of material culture, as in ‘Leifheit Perle Handheld Crumb Sweeper,’ in which the crumber is ‘a tiny metal cog in / a creaking old machine, an industry as old as I do.’ The underlying reality of the book is the excruciating ache of containment in that creaking machine, and the lyric mode as a powerful mechanism of liberation.”\n\n—Diane Seuss, author of frank: sonnets, winner of the Pulitzer Prize​\n\n“Caitlin Cowan’s Happy Everything takes on birthdays, anniversaries, Easter, Mother’s Day, the New Year, Halloween—all the markers that insist upon celebration, whether or not the speaker feels joy. Happy Everything is the antidote to Hallmark cards, to the Hallmark channel, to forced gaiety as it is thrust upon women to perform happiness and beauty no matter their real life events. Cowan subverts what we think we know about marriage and divorce and the traumas of childhood in a witty, heartbreaking voice all her own. This is a terrific debut!”\n\n—Denise Duhamel, author of Second Story\n\n“Pulsing with a deft balance of wisdom and righteous rage, the masterful, lyrical, and gut-punching poems of Happy Everything look the staid picture of domestic ‘happiness’ square in the face and say, for all our sakes, ‘not good enough.’ Cowan’s poems sear with wit, precision, and a steadfast allegiance to the underground sisterhood that keeps us human.”\n\n—Jenny Molberg, author of The Court of No Record​\n\n“What a rare and welcome surprise it is to come upon a young poet who possesses enough ambition and talent to illuminate—unforgettably, I think, in the case of Caitlin Cowan—what might be called the too muchness of life, to celebrate that nameless mortal abundance variously ending in ecstasy, despair, hope, grief, prayer, emotional collapse, or silent acceptance. I passionately recommend Happy Everything to any member of the human species who somehow missed the train and hungers to know exactly what it is like to live on planet Earth.”\n\n—B. H. Fairchild, author of An Ordinary Life ​\n\n“At the center of Happy Everything lies a stunning examination of what could too easily be dismissed as a ‘failed marriage,’ brought vividly into focus by Caitlin Cowan’s uncommon gift for rendering even the bleakest scenes with lush particularity and eviscerating wit.\"\n\n—Mark Bibbins, author of 13th Balloon\n\n\"A deeply moving collection.”\n\n—Bruce Bond, author of Patmos\n\n\"I’ve been waiting for this poet’s first book for a long time. I am left gutted by its brilliance, by its brakelines and linebreaks, by its manifolds and musicality, by its movement between demolition and rebirth, and by the healing it flowers forth.”\n\n—Matt W.
