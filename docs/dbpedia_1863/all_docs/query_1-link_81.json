After making their debut with the ‘Triumph of the Ignoroids’ EP in 1979, the ‘Something Better Change’ (1980) and ‘Hardcore ’81’ (1981) albums established D.O.A.’s dynamic formula of fast, rousing political. The ‘War on 45’ EP won the group new converts in Europe, before they moved to The Dead Kennedys’ label Alternative Tentacles. By this time the personnel had shuffled, with Dave Gregg now on guitar, Gregg James on drums and Brian Goble on bass joining Keithley. After the career anthology ‘Bloodied but Unbowed’ (1984), 1985’s ‘Let’s Wreck The Party’ caught them at a peak, both in popularity and form. Arguably the hardest touring hardcore band in the world went on the road for the 174th time in 1986 across Canada. They played a sold out show at the Edge in Vancouver and a surprise visit by Randy Bachman for a duet on D.O.A.’s “Takin’ Care of Business” remake. Also that year they helped secure a 5 year deal from Profile Records. ‘True (North) Strong And Free’ (1987) was almost as good, and royalties from songs such as “Ready To Explode” were donated to the ANC. Topics broached included the domestic growth of fascism (“Nazi Training Camp”) and Canada’s cultural domination by the USA (“51st State”). Long-standing guitarist Dave Gregg made way for Chris Prohom on ‘Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors’ (1988) – which was a collaboration with Jello Biafra – and on ‘Murder’ (1990). ‘Talk – Action = Zero’ (1991) brought D.O.A. back into the limelight as did their major label outing of 1993’s ‘The 13 Flavours of Doom’. John Wright (No Means No) drummed for the band following Ken Jensen’s death in 1995. After Wright played drums on ‘The Black Spot’,’ the drums went to Brian O’Brien, and then to The Great Baldini. Chuck Biscuits has been hardcore’s best-known drummer and would subsequently work with the Circle Jerks, Black Flag and Danzig; Ken Jensen died in a house fire January 29, 1995; Dave Gregg died of a heart attack March 30, 2014; Wimp Roy Goble died December 7, 2014; Randy Rampage died August 14, 2018; Jon Card died April 8, 2024. with notes from Robert Gutman.\n\nSingles\n\n1978 Disco Sucks [4 song EP] (Sudden Death) SD-001\n\n1978 The Prisoner/13 (Quintessence) QS-102\n\n1979 Disco Sucks [4 song EP] [re-issue] (Quintessence) QEP-002\n\n1979 World War III/Watcha Gonna Do (Sudden Death/Quintessence] QD-206\n\n1981 Positively DOA [5 song EP] (Alternative Tentacles/Virus 7 – UK) VIRUS-7\n\n1983 Right To Be Wild [2 song 7″] [Ltd.

They produced material throughout the 1990s by Ghetto Concept (including their 1993 JUNO Award winning album ‘Certified’ and 1995 JUNO Award winning album ‘E-Z on the Motion’), Demien X, and Red Life. In 1995 they ventured into releasing their own single, “Drama”, featuring Elemental. In 1999 they produced an entire Da Grassroots album entitled “Passage Through Time’ which spawned three singles – “Price of Living”, “Thematic” and “Body Language” featuring Choclair and Saukrates. Following the success of the album the individual members branched out and began solo projects and other collaborative efforts. Mr. Attic co-founded Choice Cut Records, Mr. Murray produced for LAL, and Swiff produced for artists on Da Grassroots’ own label.\n\nSingles\n\n1995 Drama [w/ELEMENTAL]/Living Underwater [5-song 12″] (Black Employed) BER-53891\n\n1999 Price of Livin’ [w/MR.ROAM]/Last Days [6-song 12″] (Black Employed/Conception – US) CON-016\n\n1999 Thematics [w/ARCEE]/Price Of Livin’ [6-song 12″] (Black Employed/Conception – US) CON-017\n\n2000 Body Language [w/CHOCLAIR & SAUKRATES]/Postal Work (Black Employed/Conception – US) CON-020\n\n2017 Drama/Dramapella [7″] (Chuku) CHUKU-0003\n\nAlbums\n\n1999 Passage Through Time (Black Employed/Conception – US) CON-018\n\nDA SLYME\n\nDead Beat (drums) / Goohaw Groon (keyboards) / No Moniker (sax, bass) / Roscoe Santiago (vocals, harmonica) / Snotty Slyme (vocals, jawbone d’ass) / Kirt Sic-o-via (lead guitar, bass) / Stig Stiletto (bass, guitar) / Pasquali Neutron (occasional vocals, writing)\n\nDa Slyme is Newfoundland’s first punk band. Formed in December 1977 at Memorial University of Newfoundland under ever changing names like The Piss-Eyed Sleazoids, The Assholes, Bagelmania, The Bagels, The Blushing Sleazoid Lizards, they finally chose Tooloose and Da Slyme (and later just Da Slyme), the band played around St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada, for a number of years. In 1980, Da Slyme released their self-titled debut double album by a Canadian punk band. It featured live and studio material recorded throughout 1978-79. After the records were pressed the band ran out of money to complete the project so it packaged the vinyl in remaindered album jackets from other artists (that it bought for $0.25 each), and spray painted Da Slyme over the front covers. When work and travel commitments spread the members across North America they took a hiatus. In 1989 Da Slyme returned for a memorable reunion, The Skeletons out of the Closet Tour in Newfoundland. In 2000, Da Slyme released its first CD, ‘The 20 Year Scam’. The song “Crazy Glue” was featured on the 2005 release ‘Punk History Canada Presents: Only in Canada, Eh!’. The band has never folded and when circumstances allow, the members get together to continue what is their life project. with notes from Peter S.

They soon signed with Passe-Temps Records and released their debut single, “J’en Ai Assez”, that same year. The record allowed them to appear on several Quebéc TV shows. In 1967 the switched to the Sonore label for the “La liberté” single. Tragically, Denis Beaudet died in 1968 and was replaced by Dioro. Smith and Normand would eventually leave and be replaced by Asselin and Boudreau.

She was in her Master’s program in Theatre when she decided to go professional. Dahlquist traveled with Hagood Hardy and The Montage in 1970/71, including an appearance in New York City’s Playboy Club and the National Arts Centre as a warm-up act for Carmen MacCrae. After hearing her voice on a television ad for the YWCA in 1975, Columbia Records A & R man Bob Gallo signed Dahlquist. She recorded disco songs for Columbia Records and Epic which were released as part of the ‘This is Patricia Dahlquist’ album in 1975. She also released a self-titled adult contemporary album for Radio Canada in 1982. From there she has sang in show rooms with her sisters in a group called The Frames of Mind, sung with players from the Toronto Symphony and the Boss Brass, worked with Jimmy Dale, musical director of the Sonny and Cher show, worked as a warm-up act for Gino Vannelli’s cross-Canada tour, appeared in a concert with Larry Gatlin at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, appeared on stage at Ontario Place between sets at the Prince Hotel in Toronto, and appeared in a show written for performances at the Imperial Room at the Royal York Hotel. Dahlquist studied directing and since that time has spent many years directing musical revues, teaching scene study and acting-on-camera. Her film credits include ‘The Commish’, two episodes of ‘The X-Files’, ‘Outer Limits’, ‘Super Dave’s All Stars’, Shari Lewis’ ‘Musical Pizza’, ‘Cold Squad’, and ‘First Wave’ among others. From her training at UBC she has extensive stage experience and, since 1982, has been producing and teaching her own ‘Stepping Out Performance Class’ in Toronto, Vancouver and the Yukon. with notes from Patricia Dahlquist.\n\nSingles\n\n1975 Keep Our Love Alive/Broken Hearted And Free (Columbia/CBS) C4-4095\n\n1975 Mr. Fascination/Bang A Boomerang (Columbia/CBS) C4-4105\n\n1976 I Just Want To Keep It Together (Columbia/CBS) C4-4133\n\n1977 Nothing But Heartaches/Simple Man (Columbia/CBS) C4-4167\n\n1978 Give Me More/Freedom Is Today (Epic/CBS) E4-8304\n\nAlbums\n\n1975 This Is Patricia Dahlquist (Epic) KE-33937\n\n1982 Patricia Dahlquist (Radio Canada) RCI-516\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1975 “Keep Our Love Alive” on ‘Music Express’ (K-Tel) TC-228\n\nDAHMS, Gail\n\nBorn: June 27, 1957 in Kitchener, Ontario\n\nSinger Gail Dahms (now Dahms-Bonine) from Kitchener, Ontario was an actress working in theatre — including the French language version of South Pacific — and television work. She became instantly recognizable as the Marilyn Monroe-like character in the Smiles & Chuckles Turtles chocolate commercial who dances with turtles in formal wear and sings the line “Oooo, I love Turtles”. David Lodge, of Major Hooples Boarding House, brought her to the attention of Axe Records and signed her to a 5 year recording contract with the label. Label owner/producer Greg Hambleton produced two singles for her: “Can’t We Somehow” and “Rescue Me” which both charted on the RPM Top100 singles charts in 1976. However, her recording career was short lived and she continued in acting. Her on-screen roles include ‘The Silent Partner’ (1978), ‘Stone Cold Dead’ (1979), ‘Killing ’em Softly’ (1982), the made-for-TV film ‘984: Prisoner Of The Future’ (1982), and the television shows ‘In Good Company’ (1975) and ‘Flappers’ (1979-1981). She was also the singing coach in the 1994 big-screen version of ‘The Little Rascals’. It is believed that she has been the Worship Pastor at First Baptist Church of Boise, Idaho since 2002.\n\nSingles\n\n1976 Can’t We Somehow Get Us Back Together/I May Never See You Again (Axe) AXE-31\n\n1976 This Song Reminds Me Of You/Here It Comes Again (Axe) AXE-35\n\n1976 Rescue Me/If I Fell (Axe) AXE-38\n\nDAIGLE, Ted\n\nBorn: January 16,1937 in Jacquet River, New Brunswick\n\nDaigle began his career on radio station CKBC in Bathurst in 1956. Daigle was a proficient singer and guitarist and it was at the station’s studios that his very first recording session took place. He took those recordings around to record labels and was signed to Rodeo Records in 1958. As his touring act, Daigle would work with Bathurst, Nova Scotia band The Tremolos featuring Gilbert Glazier (lead guitar), Arthur Chiasson (drums), Léo Chiasson (bass), and Raymond Picot (organ) who would also record several singles on Rodeo. Following this, he formed Ted Daigle & His Westerners while he was doing a radio show in the Maritimes. They recorded two albums for Masterseal Records.

Wes Dakus & the Club 93 Rebels formed in 1958 and often interchanged personnel with Edmonton’s Nomads. They were signed to Quality Records in 1959 and released “Pink Canary” in November that year. Touring as the backing act for several other prominent artists, including Buddy Knox, which established the band as seasoned professionals allowing them to record material as Wes Dakus & The Rebels with famed producer Norm Petty (Buddy Holly & The Crickets, The Fireballs) starting in 1962. Later sessions in 1964 also produced recordings for Dakus himself and erstwhile member Barry Allen’s side project as a solo artist. There were also singles released under the name The Dundeeville Players featuring guitarist George Tomsco and Violet Petty (producer Norman Petty’s wife). In 1965 ‘The Wes Dakus Album – With The Rebels’ was released on Capitol and spawned several singles including “Hobo” and “Come On Down”. In 1966 a second album was issued on KAPP in the US as “Wes Dakus’s Rebels”. In Canada the album was not released but split into several individual singles as solo recordings for the bands’ various members including Wes Dakus, Stu Mitchell, Barry Allen and Dennis Paul. RPM Magazine voted Wes Dakus & The Rebels Canada’s ‘Top Instrumental Group’ in 1964 and 1965. Dakus opened a recording studio in the 1970s called Sundown Recorders; Dakus succumbed to a brain tumour on August 18, 2013. with notes from Shawn Nagy, Gord Baker, Eric Brand, Norm Bright.\n\nSingles\n\n1964 Pedro’s Pad/Sidewinder (Quality) 1631X\n\n1964 Las Vegas Scene/Sour Biscuits (Quality) 1660X\n\n1965 Hoochi Coochi Coo/Feel Good (Capitol) 72305\n\n1966 She Ain’t No Angel/Snooper (Capitol) 72350\n\n1966 We’ve Got A Groovy Thing Going/Bach’s Back (Capitol) 72396\n\n1967 Mama’s Boy/Midnight Hour (Capitol) 72442\n\n1967 Shotgun/Lobo, The Ferocious Dog (Capitol) 72457\n\nwith WES DAKUS AND CLUB 93 REBELS\n\n1959 Pink Canary/Road Block (Quality) 1982X\n\n1960 Taboo/Remind Me (Quality) 1023X\n\n1960 El Ringo/Creepy (Quality) 1250X\n\n1962 Cavalier Twist/Walk Down (Quality) 1408X\n\nwith THE DUNDEEVILLE PLAYERS\n\n1964 Wheels/Woodpecker (DOT) 16744\n\n1964 Replica/Sunday (DOT) 16787\n\nwith WES DAKUS & THE REBELS\n\n1965 Hobo/Rolling Back (Capitol) 72213\n\n1965 Come On Down/Honeybun (Capitol) 72259\n\n1967 Manipulator/Come On In (Capitol) 72484\n\nwith THE NEW SOUNDS OF WES DAKUS\n\n1968 Organized/The Chaser (Capitol) 72532\n\nwith WES DAKUS’ REBELS\n\n1968 Casting My Spell/Mission Bell (Artone – NL) RM-25-777\n\nAlbums\n\n1965 The Wes Dakus Album – With The Rebels (Capitol) T-6120\n\n1966 Wes Dakus’s Rebels (Kapp) KS-3536\n\n2006 Wes Dakus & The Rebels – Volume 1 (Super Oldies) SOCD-3\n\n2007 Wes Dakus & The Rebels – Volume 2 (Super Oldies) SOCD-5\n\n2012 Wes Dakus & The Rebels – Volume 3 (Super Oldies) SOCD-12\n\nDAL BELLO, Lisa\n\nBorn: 1958 in Woodbridge, Ontario\n\nDalbello, originally from Woodbridge, Ontario, began her professional career at the age of 13 touring Ontario with the “Summer Sounds ’71” revue. After appearing in commercials and on CBC-TV’s ‘Singalong Jubilee’, ‘Keith Hampshire’s Music Machine’, and ‘The Bobby Vinton Show’, she secured a contract with MCA. She released her first album of dance styled pop songs, ‘Lisa Dal Bello’, in 1977 which won her a Most Promising Female Vocalist JUNO. ‘Pretty Girls’ (1978) followed with a Best New Female Vocalist JUNO as well. ‘Drastic Measures’ came in 1981 at which time she took a break from recording and instead focused on her poetry and attending York University. During this period former David Bowie guitarist Mike Ronson saw a CBC-TV documentary on her and convinced her to get back into recording. In 1984, they co-produced the album “Whomanfoursays”, at which time she change her professional name to Dalbello. With this, she made the transformation complete by redefining her appearance and her sound — burying the disco queen and introducing the avant garde artiste. Ronson and Dalbello continued working together to record a second album, but Ronson’s ongoing feud with Dalbello’s label caused him to pull out. Instead, Dalbello continued working on her own at her new home in England, and released the album “She” in 1987 after nearly a year’s delay. Dalbello soon parted with her manager, Roger Davies, and Capitol Records. With Capitol Records out of the picture, Ronson and Dalbello began working together again in 1991. Ronson was enthusiastic enough with Dalbello’s cutting edge material he wanted to play guitar for her in a Scandinavian club tour scheduled for November ’91. However, due to Ronson’s ongoing poor health, the tour was pushed back to April 1992. His health continued to slide forcing the tour to be cancelled and recording post-poned. Ronson would eventually succumb to cancer April 29, 1993. Dalbello seemingly disappeared for good but what she was doing was working with her brother Stefano to record 1997’s “whore” in Toronto. She kissed and made up with manager Roger Davies and re-signed with EMI. During these serious recording periods, Dalbello blew off steam writing and recording material for dozens of other artists including Maxus, Julie Masse, Dan Lucas, Sheree Jeacocke, Nena, Patti Labelle, Heart, Helix, Helen Arnesen, Maria Gundersen. She also did radio and TV jingles and provided the voice of ‘Monster of the Day’ in the TV cartoon ‘Sailor Moon’. with notes from Will Jackson and Dale Primonato.\n\nSingles\n\n1974 Mourning In The Morning/The Old Man//Come Sun Days/Human (CBC Radio Canada) LM-230\n\n1977 (Don’t Want To) Stand In Your Way/Day Dream (MCA) MCA-40806\n\n1977 Talk It Over (Even Thought My Body’s Cold)/Day Dream (MCA – JAPAN) VIM-1336\n\n1977 My Mind’s Made Up/Snow White (MCA) MCA-40848\n\n1978 Pretty Girls/Miracle Maker (Talisman/London) TALX-100\n\n1978 Pretty Girls/Pretty Girls (Radio Version) [12″] (Talisman/London) TAL1\n\n1978 Pretty Girls/Dreams Are For Lovers (Talisman – US) TALI-UF-NV-5\n\n1978 Pretty Girls (Rock Disco Mix – Long Version)/Pretty Girls (Rock Disco Mix – Short Version) [12″ (Talisman – US) TALI-US-RD-1/RD-2\n\n1978 Still In Love/Hollywood (Talisman/London) TAL-101\n\n1981 Never Get To Heaven/Dr. Noble (Capitol-EMI) 72853\n\n1981 Just Like You/What Your Mama Don’t Know (Capitol-EMI) 72868\n\n1981 She Wants To Know/Bad Timing (Capitol-EMI) B-5006\n\nas DALBELLO\n\n1984 Gonna Get Close To You/Guilty By Association (Capitol-EMI) 72942\n\n1984 Gonna Get Close To You [3 mixes] [12″] (Capitol – GERMANY) (Capitol) 1C-K-062-20 0204-6\n\n1984 Gonna Get Close To You (Extended Version)//Gonna Get Close To You/Guilt By Association [12″ (Capitol – UK) 12CL-332\n\n1984 Animal/Target (My Eyes Are Aimed At You) (Capitol) B72954\n\n1984 Animal(Jungle Mix) (7:30)/Animal (Tribal Mix) (5:38)/Animal (Dub Mix) (7:16) [12″] (Capitol) B75074\n\n1984 Animal/Animal (Extended Mix)/Cardinal Sin [12″] (Capitol – NETHERLANDS) 1C-K-060-20-0470-6\n\n1985 Black On Black (Extended Version)/Baby Doll [12″ (Capitol – GERMANY) 1C-K-060-20-0830-6\n\n1985 Black On Black/Baby Doll (Capitol – EUROPE) 1C-006-20-0829-7\n\n1987 Tango (LP Version)/Why Stand Alone (Capitol-EMI) B-73074\n\n1987 Tango (Dance Mix)//Tango (7″ Mix)/Tango (Dub Mix) [12″] (Capitol) C1-75242\n\n1987 Tango (LP Version)/Tango (Dance Mix) (Capitol) CDPRO-381\n\n1987 Talk To Me/Imagination (Capitol-EMI) B-73083\n\n1987 Talk To Me (12″ Remix)//Talk To Me (7″ Version)/Imagination [12″] (EMI Electrola – EUROPE) 1C-K-060-20-2330-6\n\n1987 Talk To Me (12″ Remix)/Tango (Dance Mix) [12″] (Capitol – AUSTRALIA) ED-351\n\n1987 Immaculate Eyes (Capitol) DPRO-404\n\n1995 eLeVeN/whore/whore (remix) (Spin/Capitol – NETHERLANDS) 72438-62199-2-3\n\n1995 eLeVeN (Radio Edit)/Whore (Remix) (Spin/Capitol – NETHERLANDS) 72438-62199-2-4 1996 Heavy Boots (Clawfinger Remix 1)/Heavy Boots (Clawfinger Remix 2)/Heavy Boots (Album Version) (Spin/EMI – NETHERLANDS) 72438-62286-2-8\n\n1996 O L’il Boy (Uncle Moon’s Big Boy Mix)/O L’il Boy (Uncle Moon’s Long Big Boy Mix)/O L’il Boy (Album Version) (Spin – GERMANY) 72438-62285-2-9\n\n2003 Always (Thinking Of You) [DigiFile]\n\nAlbums\n\n1977 Lisa Dal Bello (MCA) MCA-2249\n\n1979 Pretty Girls (Talisman/London) TALI-1000\n\n1981 EP For AOR (Just For You) [3-song EP (Capitol – US) SPRO-9642/9643\n\n1981 Drastic Measures (Capitol) ST-12140\n\nas DALBELLO\n\n1984 Whōmănfoursāys (Capitol) ST-12318\n\n1987 She (Capitol) C1-48286\n\n1995 Whore (Spin/EMI) 72438-37985-2-0\n\n2015 Live At Rockpalast [CD + DVD (Repertoire – UK) REPUK-1268\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1975 “Mourning In The Morning,” “The Old Man,” “Come Sun Days,” and “Human” on ‘CBC Radio Canada Broadcast Recording” (CBC Radio Canada) LM-417\n\n1981 “Pretty Girls” on ‘Superstars Salute New Massey Hall’ (CBS/CRIA) CRIA-2\n\nas DALBELLO\n\n1985 “Got To Get Close To You” on ‘Chartbusters’ (Quality) QRSP-1010\n\n1987 “Black On Black (alternate version)” on ‘9 1/2 Week’s Soundtrack’\n\nDALA\n\nSheila Carabine (guitar, vocals) / Amanda Walther (guitar, vocals)\n\nCarabine and Walther met at Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School in Scarborough, Ontario at band practice in 2002.

Laurel Records was interested in him as a young songwriter and performer in the late 1950s which led to the release of the 1959 single “Havin’ A Party” b/w “Rockin’ Baby” under the name Dickie Damron. In 1960 he recorded two albums on his own imprint – Holiday Records – and then headed to Nashville where he aligned himself with some of that city’s biggest session players resulting in a distribution deal with Starday Records stateside. With several songs recorded the songs were licensed to Quality Records back in Canada starting in 1960 through 1961. He was then picked up exclusively in Canada by RCA Canada International where he had his first Canadian #1 hit, “Hitch Hikin'” in 1964. He continued releasing singles with RCA Canada International before moving to Apex in 1970 which saw his next hit “Countryfied” storm the charts. He moved to MCA briefly later that year before going to Columbia for a string of early 1970s singles including “Rise ‘n’ Shine,”The Long Green Line,” ‘Going Home To Country’, “The Locket,” “The Prophet,” and “Bitter Sweet Songs”. Damron was prolific and despite ending his deal with Columbia, was still able to dominate the Canadian Country charts with singles on Marathon, Condor, and Broadland Records. Through this period he toured in the US (with a stop at the Grand Ole Opry in 1972) and Europe which raised his international profile considerably. Finally, Damron found a permanent musical home with RCA Victor in Canada beginning in 1978 as a renowned singer-songwriter in the Outlaw Country musical style. He would stay with RCA through the next decade releasing seven studio albums and several compilations of older material. In the 1980s he performed at the Wembley International Country Music Festival in London, England. He spent six seasons as the resident artist at Howard Hughes’ Desert Inn in Las Vegas, Nevada (1985 – 1991). Damron had a stroke in 2001 but continued performing on and off between resting at his second home in Mazatlan, Mexico during cold Canadian winters.\n\nSingles\n\n1960 That’s What I Call Livin’/Julie

The group toured extensively for the first two years as a live act opening for acts such as Blonde Redhead, New Bomb Turks and Nashville Pussy. Soon they were getting requests for CDs at shows and finally went into the studio to record a self-titled EP in 1998. A steady regimen of touring and recording resulted in a series of EPs from 1998 through 2000. The ‘My Love is Bold’ EP from 1999 featured the massive Rock Radio hit “Bounce” and led to a JUNO Award nomination in 2000 for ‘Best Alternative Album’. Bad Taste Records signed the act and decided to gather the EPs together into a full-length CD entitled ‘I’m Alive and On Fire’. Danko Jones would head to Europe to promote the release on successive return trips in 2001. The Bill Bell produced full-length album ‘Born a Lion’ followed in 2002. Several European tours and two Canadian tours followed including a return to Roskilde and Hultsfred Festivals as well as appearances at Belgium’s Pukkelpop and The Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands. They also opened the Palais Royale Toronto stop on The Rolling Stones ’40 Licks World Tour’ in August 2002. They garnered them JUNO Awards for ‘Best Rock Album’ and ‘Best Video’ for “Lovercall”. In 2003, Danko Jones worked with producer Matt DeMatteo on the next album ‘We Sweat Blood’. They toured Europe and Japan on the back of the release. The album earned them another 2004JUNO Award nomination for ‘Best Rock Album’. They also took a trip to play Australia and another round of shows in Europe and England (where they played the Reading Festival). Despite the success, Danko Jones was dropped by their distributor, Universal, in Canada. As the band rolled into 2005 they were touring in Europe and South Africa and the United States on the heels of Razor & Tie Records issuing ‘We Sweat Blood’ stateside. Their schedule was so full they moved the release of their next album, ‘Sleep is the Enemy’, to 2006. Following the US tour drummer Richardson left the band and was replaced by Dan Cornelius. In early 2006 Danko Jones signed to Aquarius Records domestically. With the Matt DeMatteo produced ‘Sleep Is the Enemy’ finally released they toured Canada with Nickelback then returned to the US and headlined a club tour in Europe. They would play large festivals in Netherlands, Sweden, Finland and Norway to round out the year. In 2007 frontman Danko Jones appeared on the Annihilator album ‘Metal’. In 2008 the band released the Nick Rasculinecz produced ‘Never Too Loud’ which spawned three singles and a whirlwind of return tour dates in Europe including gigs with Motörhead. Two compilation packages emerged in 2009 – the European only ‘B-Sides’ which yielded two new singles for that market and ‘This Is Danko Jones’ which was a ‘best of’ package assembled by Universal for Canada only. The group played several European festivals including Hungary’s Sziget Festival where they shared a stage with Faith No More and The Offspring. In 2010 the band toured Canada with Guns ‘n Roses and Sebastian Bach. In the spring of that year they toured the US with Clutch. The fifth studio album entitled ‘Below the Belt’ – again produced by Matt DeMatteo – was released in May 2010 and featured the single “Full of Regret”. The video for the song had cameos by Lemmy (of Motörhead), actor Elijah Wood, and actress Selma Blair. The song peaked at No.36 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The follow-up single was “Had Enough” and featured actor Ralph Macchio in the accompanying video. Drummer Cornelius was replaced by Atom Willard in 2011.\n\nSingles\n\n2000 Bounce (Bad Taste) BTR-48\n\n2002 Sound of Love (Bad Taste) BTR-56\n\n2002 Lovercall (Bad Taste) BTR-60\n\n2002 Play the Blues/Fucked Up/Mango Kid (Bad Taste) BTR-69\n\n2002 Dance (Bad Taste) BTR-71\n\n2003 I Want You (Bad Taste) BTR-72\n\n2003 Woogie Boogie/Take Me Out On a Stretcher (Bad Taste) BTR-74\n\n2006 Baby Hates Me (Bad Taste) BTR-95\n\n2006 First Date (Bad Taste) BTR-99\n\n2008 Code of the Road (Bad Taste) BTR-COTR\n\n2008 Take Me Home (Bad Taste)\n\n2008 King of Magazines (Bad Taste)\n\n2009 Sugar High\n\n2009 My Problems (Are Your Problems Now)\n\n2010 Full of Regret (Bad Taste) BTR-135\n\n2010 Active Volcanoes\n\n2010 Had Enough\n\n2011 I Think Bad Thoughts\n\nAlbums\n\n1998 Danko Jones [EP] (Sonic Unyon) SS-042\n\n1999 Gun Girl [EP]\n\n2000 My Love Is Bold [EP]\n\n2001 I’m Alive and On Fire (Bad Taste) BTR-49\n\n2002 Born a Lion (Bad Taste) BTR-58\n\n2003 We Sweat Blood (Bad Taste) BTR-73\n\n2004 The Magical World of Rock (Bad Taste) BTR-85\n\n2006 Sleep Is the Enemy (Bad Taste) BTR-96\n\n2008 Never Too Loud (Bad Taste) BTR-119\n\n2009 B-sides\n\n2009 This Is Danko Jones (Universal)\n\n2010 Below the Belt (Bad Taste) BTR-136\n\n2011 Mouth to Mouth [10” EP] (no label)\n\n2012 Rock and Roll Is Black and Blue (Bad Taste) BTR-145\n\n2014 Fire Music (New Damage) NDRV-015\n\n2016 Live At Wacken (UDR – Europe) UDR-061\n\n2017 Wild Cat (AFM – Germany) AFM-628\n\n2019 A Rock Supreme (Indica) INDCD-175\n\n2021 Power Trio (Sonic Unyon) SUNCD-1852\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n2009 ‘Code of the Road’ on ‘Saw VI [O.S.T.] (Trust Kill) TK-0128\n\nDANKO, Rick\n\nBorn: Richard Clare Danko on December 29, 1942 in Simcoe, Ontario\n\nDied: December 10, 1999 in Woodstock, New York\n\nHailing from the tiny rural town of Simcoe, Ontario, Danko was born into a musical family. Both of his parents and his three brothers played and/or sang, and music was a way of life for him from the beginning. He listened to Hank Williams and Sam Cooke as a small child, and was ready to go to Nashville by the age of seven. With his oldest brother, Maurice (Junior), Rick sang and performed at family get-togethers and made his public debut on four-string tenor banjo before an audience of his first-grade classmates. He quit school at 14 to purse music full-time and in 1960, when he was 17, he joined rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins’ group, the Hawks, initially as rhythm guitarist. He soon moved to bass and, with the help of the Hawks’ piano player Stan Szelest. Under Ronnie Hawkins’ tutelage, Danko began a three-year tenure of non-stop gigging and rigorous rehearsals that fellow Band-mate Richard Manuel once likened to ‘boot camp.’ By the time he was 20, he was a seasoned pro, having spent most of his teenage years playing in bars that you were supposed to be 21 to play in. By the early 60s, Rick and the other Hawks had outgrown the limited roadhouse and honky-tonk circuit and left Hawkins to pursue greener pastures. Bob Dylan saw them perform in the mid-60s and was so impressed that he signed the Hawks to accompany him on his 1965-66 world tour. The Band’s collaboration with Dylan, initially greeted with boos and catcalls around the globe, changed the course of popular music by spawning one of the most significant musical hybrids of the rock era, ‘Folk Rock.’ After the tumultuous world tours with Dylan (the European leg of which was documented in the obscure film, Eat the Document), Danko relocated from Manhattan to upstate New York, along with Dylan and the other members of the still un-named Band. He rented a big pink house in West Saugerties, near Woodstock, and with Dylan and The Band began recording songs which soon surfaced on bootlegs and were officially released in 1975 as The Basement Tapes. In 1968, after toying with a host of politically incorrect names, like the Crackers and the Honkies, The Band made its official debut with ‘Music from Big Pink’. The album shot The Band into folklore. A succession of albums and tours followed, and, The Band, now a firm fixture in the rock aristocracy, played virtually every major festival from Woodstock to Watkins Glen. In 1976, on Thanksgiving day, The Band officially called it quits with a farewell concert at San Francisco’s Winterland Ballroom. The concert, which featured an unprecedented all-star lineup to which The Band graciously played back-up, was documented in Martin Scorsese’s much lauded film, ‘The Last Waltz’, regarded by many as the finest concert film of all time. Following ‘The Last Waltz’, Danko continued to perform and record as a solo artist. His 1978 self-titled debut, overshadowed at first by The Band, later gained critical and popular acclaim. During the early 1980s, he maintained a low profile, and in 1983, reunited with The Band (minus Robbie Robertson, who pursued a solo career). During that period, he began playing acoustic guitar as well as bass on-stage, and his unique style of tuning and playing (revealing the bass player in his soul), has become another of his signature sounds. Throughout the 80s, never one to ‘sit at home’, Rick continued to play solo, with The Band, in pairings with Richard Manuel, Levon Helm, Paul Butterfield, Jorma Kaukonen and others. In 1985, he appeared (with Manuel, Helm and Hudson) in a feature film, Man Outside, and in 1987 he released an instructional video, ‘Rick Danko’s Electric Bass Techniques’ (Homespun). In 1989, he and Band drummer/vocalist Levon Helm toured as part of Ringo Starr’s All-Starr Band. That same year, The Band was inducted into the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Hall Of Fame. In 1990, Danko, along with Helm, Hudson, Sinead O’Connor, Van Morrison and others, appeared in Roger Waters’ ‘The Wall’ concert in Berlin. Danko began recording with Folk legend Eric Andersen and Norwegian singer/songwriter Jonas Fjeld in 1991 and one sidebar of the trio’s collaboration was an award-winning album, Danko Fjeld Andersen (Stageway), which was honored in Norway with a Spellemans Pris (the Norwegian Grammy) for ‘Record of the Year’ and was released in late 1993 by Rykodisc. It was honored by AFIM (formerly NAIRD) the following year. In October, 1992 he performed with The Band at the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary tribute at Madison Square Garden and, in January 1994, he and The Band were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by Eric Clapton. 1993 saw The Band record their first studio album in 17 years, ‘Jericho’, which featured a radically extended line-up of members including Richard Bell. They followed this up with another album, ‘High On The Hog’, in 1996. In February, 1997, Rykodisc released ‘Ridin’ On The Blinds’, the follow-up to Danko Fjeld Andersen, which was recorded in Norway in 1994; ‘Jubilation’, The Band’s third album in five years, was released on River North Records in September, 1998. In September 1999, Danko returned with an 11-song collection of inspired performances called ‘Live On Breeze Hill’. He was joined on this mostly live outing by some of the finest musicians in the business, including Band-mate Garth Hudson and long-time collaborator and Band co-producer Aaron Hurwitz. Danko began actively promoting the CD, as well as laying down tracks for a new album which would be released, posthumously, in August 2000 as ‘Times Like These’ following his untimely passing in his upstate New York home on Friday, December 10, 1999.

Though a natural performer and musician, Terry Danko’s first love has always been songwriting and, in 1967, together with guitarist and fellow songwriter Jim Atkinson, they formed the group Tin Pan Alley, whose name was taken from the collection of New York City-based music publishers and songwriters who dominated US popular music in the late 19th/early 20th century. It was that year at The Graham Bell Hotel in Brantford, where Tin Pan Alley was playing to full houses and drawing a university crowd, that Ronnie Hawkins, who had recruited Danko’s brother Rick for his band, The Hawks, seven years earlier, spotted Terry and his band. Lured by Hawkins’ built-in audience and the promise of being able to play their own songs, Danko and Atkinson joined Ronnie Hawkins And The Hawks. After less than two grueling years of non-stop, rigorous playing—and with little time or energy left to write songs, Danko began to feel creatively stifled, and left Hawkins. Together with Atkinson and keyboardist Dwayne Ford, he formed Atkinson, Danko and Ford and, in 1972, signed with Columbia Records, which released the group’s eponymous debut album and the single ‘Right On’. In 1973, the group changed its name to Bearfoot and released the album Friends with Bearfoot. In the mid 70s, Danko moved to California, where he continued to write, perform, and record, and became a sought-after session musician, working with everyone from Eric Clapton to George Harrison to Stephen Stills to the Rolling Stones. He played on Clapton’s star-studded ‘No Reason To Cry’ in 1976, on his brother Rick’s acclaimed self-titled debut album in 1977, and on numerous other releases in the ensuing years. He toured with Rick Danko in 1978. In 1980 Danko teamed up with Marty Grebb (The Buckinghams/Chicago) and together they wrote, recorded and produced an album together in California. The cast of players on the album were guitarist Chris Pinnick (Chicago), drummer Ricky Fataar, brass player James Pankow (Chicago), and percussionist Joe LaLa. Most of the tracks were recorded at the Beach Boys’ Studio in Van Nuys, California and engineered by by Earle Mankey. One additional song, “First Love Affair” was recorded at The Band’s Shangri La Studio and included Terry Danko, Marty Grebb, Michael DeTemple, Eric Clapton (guitar), Rick Belky (guitar), ex-Wings drummer Denny Seiwell and ex-Tractors piano player Walt Richmond. Danko was, unfortunately, in a serious car accident, and the album was shelved. Worse still, a fire later destroyed the master tapes. Having recovered from his injuries, he rejoined Ronnie Hawkins in 1983, with whom he toured and performed for several years. In 1985 he took a break to reform Bearfoot with Jim Atkinson and Gerry Baird before returning to work with Ronnie Hawkins. In 1999 Danko released the solo album ‘The Fossils’. And after a self-imposed, multi-year hiatus from the music business, Terry began writing again in 2006. In 2008 Danko found a cassette mix of the California album with Marty Grebb from 1980 and has re-issued it on CD through his Cobalt Blue label. Since then, he has amassed a collection of 50 new songs. An album is expected in Spring 2010 with Danko and Jim Atkinson playing all the instruments. With notes from Carol Caffin and Terry Danko.

The family moved to Burlington, Ontario shortly after his birth. He grew up a typical suburban teen and took an interest in rock and roll early on. By the 1970s he had joined the band Darwin made up of friends from high school. They would win studio time which allowed them to record and release an independent 7″ single in 1976. The band dissolved shortly after that. One of the band members, Tim Clément began to work with Danna as a duo. The two 19 year-olds released their self-titled ambient music album independently in 1977. Meanwhile, the duo played in bands to finance their work including a stint in the reunited version of Darwin, called The Oh No’s, in 1978 who toured Southern Ontario. The band managed to place one of their songs on radio station Q107’s annual ‘Homegrown’ contest in 1979. Following the break up of The Oh No’s in 1980, Danna and bandmate Tim Clément continued their work as duo – ultimately releasing another six albums together (plus a ‘best of’) over the next three decades. During the 1980s Danna studied music composition at the University of Toronto which earned him the Glenn Gould Composition Scholarship in 1985. He would then serve as composer-in-residence at the now defunct McLaughlin Planetarium in Toronto from 1987 until its closing in 1992. During this period he also begun scoring film soundtracks beginning with Atom Egoyan’s ‘Family Viewing’ (earning him a Genie Award nomination). Over the past four decades he has continued working with other composers (including his brother Jeff Danna) and with such directors as Marc Webb, Deepa Mehta, Terry Gilliam, Dan Scanlon, Scott Hicks, Gillies MacKinnon, James Mangold, Mira Nair, Billy Ray, Mimi Leder, Nora Twomey, Joel Schumacher, Bennett Miller, and Denzel Washington. His score for Ang Lee’s ‘Life of Pi’ earned Danna two Academy Award nominations for ‘Best Original Score’ and ‘Best Original Song’ for his composition “Pi’s Lullaby.” In other ventures, Danna has also scored works for stage dance which includes the Carbone Quatorze Dance Company’s production of ‘Dead Souls’ in 1996, and scoring the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s ‘Gita Govinda’ in 2001.In 2012, Danna won an Emmy Award for ‘Outstanding Music Composition for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special (Original Dramatic Score) for his scoring on the miniseries ‘World Without End.’ In June 2014, Mychael Danna was awarded an Honorary Doctorate for career achievements in music by the University of Toronto, and on September 30, 2021, he received the Career Achievement Award from the Zurich Film Festival.

They soon attracted the attention of Warner Music who sent the band back to Sundowner with owner/producer Wes Dakus, and new bassist Jeff Schmidt, to rework songs from the EP and add six new tunes which became their debut album ‘San Paku’ in 1983. Though the title track and “In Dim Light” failed to make the charts, Darkroom found an audience on College/University radio while doing a national tour. The band then went to Toronto to record their follow up album, ‘A Test of Time’, with producer Tom Treumuth and new keyboardists Barry Lindal. The album was released in the summer of 1985. A North American and European tour followed, but the band was still unable to reach critical mass with the public or radio. Warners dropped the group in the Spring of 1986. Darkroom pressed on but failed to land another recording contract, and finally split up in 1989; singer Jim Gray starred in the TV series ‘Little Vampires’. Following the split of the band he formed a 1950s retro act with Lindal called Cheatin’ ‘N’ Hurtin’ before making his way to Hollywood in the 1990s where he eventually went behind the scenes as a set designer. Gray currently lives in Toronto doing session work; Wolfe Radke has played in the Shake Masters and the Hardline Blues Band.

They were determined to get their original material (mostly written by Chipman) out to the masses. This meant expanding their audience and playing the Ontario bar scene as well as trips into the Northern U.S.A. While in New York in 1976 to play some gigs, they met producer and songwriter Art Munson who was impressed with their live act and music. They agreed to record some of his songs and so, through a deal with the Cashman & West label Lifesong Records, they released two singles – “Holy Roller” and “Sweet Delight.” Neither single made a splash and the band returned to Canada determined to have better success, and to control their output. This included forming Ariel Records. It would become home to Darkstar and their alias The Foxrun Band as well Diane Page, Essence, Joey Barnett, Lindy Hearne, The Play, and Timothy Chipman’s post Darkstar act Sierra Blue. Darkstar’s debut album, ‘Into The Heartland’ was released in mid-1978 which contained two singles – “Hit & Run Lover” and the title track. The album and singles didn’t move the needle on their career at all. They decided to re-invent themselves and changed their name to The Foxrun Band in 1979. They headed into Kinck Sound in Scarborough, Ontario to record new songs and album ‘You’re Invited” which was released in early 1979.The gambit did not pay off and they changed their name back to Darkstar in 1980 to record a true follow-up album entitled ‘Escape Routines.’ Thinking about more mainstream musical positioning, the first single, “Postcard From Jamaica” would achieve some attention on local charts, allowing them to book some higher profile live gigs around the Greater Toronto area. Unfortunately, the follow-up single, “Won’t Be Disappointed,” didn’t receive the same success. In 1981 they would again wear The Foxrun Band moniker and released a follow-up to ‘You’re Invited’ entitled ‘Embrace.’ As with the first album, they brought in Margo Davidson (Parachute Club) to play saxophone. Two singles were released – “Such Delight” and the title track which did not chart once again. Disheartened the band spent the next few years only performing live while Timothy Chipman would form Sierra Blue as a side project. They released three singles on the band’s label. The Foxrun Band would release their final two singles with the original line-up in 1984 – “River Of Tears” followed up with “What The Hell” to a disappointing reception. The Cassar Brothers would leave the band shortly afterwards. The brothers would continue working with s Arial recording artists Joey Barnett, Essence, and Diane Page. Timothy Chipman would continue with his band The Play in 1985 and releasing three singles to little success.

His father would occasionally play harmonica for the boy but Davies musical upbringing started when he would sing at Cub Scouts and Life Boy camps. At the age of fourteen he admired a new guitar his school friend owned, and he soon was using money from his paper route to purchase his own guitar. He soon taught himself how to play by ear from his favourite records. He left school in Grade 10 and was soon working at the Montréal stock market. He put his first band together in 1953 called The Down Yonder Boys. Next, he and a friend, Norman “Curly” Robertson, joined the Blue Sky Revue troupe as a country and western comedy duo called Slim & Curly. After auditioning at the Hale Hakala Club in 1954, they began playing there weekends and broadened their scope to playing around Quebéc at social clubs. The duo managed to get on a local radio program called ‘Opportunity Knocks’ and came in second place in a talent contest featuring opera singers, classical acts and jazz. They later met another musician, lead guitarist Rick Munro, in 1955 and hit it off so well they became a trio – changing their name to The Rhythm Jesters. They did the club circuit around Montréal performing rock and roll material (usually Elvis Presley songs) and appeared regularly on Montréal station CFCF’s ‘The Hometown Jamboree’ show. By the summer of 1956 they had met drummer Emmett McGoogan who was tutoring a young Verdun singer named Little Billy Mason. The five musicians teamed up as Little Billy Mason & The Rhythm Jesters and attracted the attention of Rama Records in the US. After some unsatisfactory demos were recorded at RCA Studio in Montréal, they reconvened in New York City where Rama booked them into Bell Studios to cut four ‘sides’. Two of the tracks – “I Love My Baby” and “Make Me Your Own” – were issued under the name Little Billy Mason while the other two tracks – “Rock to the Music” and “Hole in My Bucket” – were issued under the name The Rhythm Jesters. Mason’s single was released in Canada on Apex and in the US on Rama Records. Meanwhile, the group’s single was only in the US on Rama Records. Little Billy Mason and the Rhythm Jesters repeated their solo and group duties for Allen Freed’s Rock And Roll Revue at the Apollo Theatre with many of that era’s doo-wop acts, crooners and rockabilly artists. The Rhythm Jesters were noticed by Frank Sinatra’s agent who invited them to back the legendary singer in Australia. The band left their "
