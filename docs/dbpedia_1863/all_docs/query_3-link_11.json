        "text": "Darlin' Corey\n\nFrom the northern reach of the Appalachian Trail comes the musical trio Darlin’ Corey. Drawing on the many threads of North American folk music, their elegant harmonies are the beating heart of their sound, in both their original music and the traditional Folk, Old Time, and Bluegrass music they regularly showcase. In Darlin’ Corey’s singing and playing, you can feel the many years of dedication to these celebrated musical traditions.\n\nErica Brown’s fiddle-playing is at turns virtuosic and completely unpretentious. Matt Shipman is an ideal counterpart as his versatility on a dizzying array of stringed instruments (guitar, Irish bouzouki, 5-string banjo, mandolin) blend seamlessly, never timid or overpowering. Add to that Kris Day’s steady and tasteful bass playing and together they create an engaging performance of thoughtful originals and traditional songs and tunes that have influenced them along the way.\n\nTICKETS AVAILABLE HERE! Doors open at 6:30pm, show begins at 7:30pm. $20 general admission / $25 day-of door price (if available). The Barn is stocked with a bar, but no food - we recommend making a reservation at our restaurant adjacent to the venue beforehand!\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Mallett Brothers Trio\n\nThe Mallett Brothers Band is an independent rock and roll / Americana / country band from Maine. Their busy tour schedule since forming in 2009 has helped them to build a dedicated fanbase across the U.S. and beyond while still calling the state of Maine their home. With a style that ranges from alt-country to Americana, country, jam and roots rock, theirs is a musical melting pot that's influenced equally by the singer/songwriter tradition as by harder rock, classic country and psychedelic sounds.\n\nTexas Hill Country Explore Magazine calls them “New England’s wildly eclectic crew of genre rebels.” Bill Copeland Music News says “Combining their authentic roots rock sound with a reflective lyrical style that perceives stories on the level of epic myth, it’s like William Faulkner has been resurrected with an electric guitar in hand..\"\n\nTICKETS AVAILABLE HERE!

We're known for our high-energy live act and avid improvisation — we never play songs the same way twice. We met as students at New York University, and first came together playing college parties on NYC rooftops. Our goal then was the same as it is now: to make every gig feel like a party, and to keep people dancing.\n\n– Jackson, Evan, Will, Josh and Sawyer”\n\nTHIS EVENT IS SOLD OUT. Doors open at 6:30pm, show begins at 7:30pm. $25 general admission / $30 day-of door price (if available).

They will be performing a combination of Jazz Standards from the Great American Songbook, selections from Duke Ellington & Billy Strayhorn, as well as songs associated with Billie Holiday, songs written by Abbey Lincoln, and some original compositions! This will be an exhilarating evening of music not to be missed. Their interplay is spontaneous and flawless, with a variety of music that will take you on a memorable musical journey!\n\n“Teri has an intuitive laid-back sense of time reminiscent of Abbey Lincoln and Betty Carter but with her own uniqueness.” Jack DeJohnette (legendary jazz drummer & 2012 NEA Jazz Master)\n\n\"Roiger is one of the great though unheralded vocal artists and lyricists of her generation, a living link to giants like Billie Holiday, Carmen McRae, Betty Carter and Abbey Lincoln.\" Thomas Staudter (Music Journalist | Downbeat)\n\nBill Ware has “…the touch of a resilient, serpentine stylist, a master of quiet spectacle.” All About Jazz\n\n“New York bassist John Menegon is in the line of George Mraz and Michael Moore; a harmonically sophisticated bassist with technical facility who swings hard when it’s called for.” -- Kirk Silsbee | Downbeat\n\nteriroiger.com\n\nbillwarevibes.com\n\njohnmenegon.com\n\nTICKETS AVAILABLE HERE!

They’ve been playing and writing music together for as long as they can remember and ‘The Clements Brothers’ marks their first project together since playing in the internationally touring grass-roots band, ‘The Lonely Heartstring Band’ with whom they put out two albums on Rounder Records. With roots, rock, bluegrass, jazz, and classical influences, George (on guitar) and Charles (on bass) aim to capture their singer-songwriter sensibilities in a unique blended voice, at once enthralling and intimate, groovy and serene. The duo is a fusion of each brother's unique musical journey, and the result is a music all its own, filled with vocal harmonies, instrumental virtuosity, and a genuine love of song.\n\nTICKETS AVAILABLE HERE!

A prolific road warrior since the late 90s, Neill tours throughout the USA, Japan, and Europe, performing at venues such as Town Hall in New York, San Francisco's Great American Music Hall, and the Newport Folk Festival. Two new albums of his songs are out in 2023 - one by his band Casey Neill & The Norway Rats (Sending Up Flares) and a solo CD of acoustic songs titled time zero land. A self-produced collection of bedroom recordings, time zero land leans into the American folk and traditional Scots/Irish influences that have often underscored his songwriting craft and guitar work. The songs on Sending Up Flares and time zero land offer a lifeline to a world in need of balance, shot through with stories about resolve, resilience, and wonder.\n\nCritic Marco Rivera described it best for music blog Splendid: “Be it through raucous rockers, fragile acoustic ballads, soulful touches of Irish folk, Neill's narrative talent and concern for real people's struggles stand out. The results are so evocative, you'll be tempted to steep further in these memories, the better to share Casey Neill's particular blend of personal and historical experience.”\n\nLearn more at www.caseyneill.com\n\nTICKETS AVAILABLE HERE!

(The Barn is stocked with a bar, but no food)\n\nCasey Neill is a songwriter from Portland, Oregon performing high energy indie folk, infused with haunting melodies and weather beaten narratives. A prolific road warrior since the late 90s, Neill tours throughout the USA, Japan, and Europe, performing at venues such as Town Hall in New York, San Francisco's Great American Music Hall, and the Newport Folk Festival. Two new albums of his songs are out in 2023 - one by his band Casey Neill & The Norway Rats (Sending Up Flares) and a solo CD of acoustic songs titled time zero land. A self-produced collection of bedroom recordings, time zero land leans into the American folk and traditional Scots/Irish influences that have often underscored his songwriting craft and guitar work. The songs on Sending Up Flares and time zero land offer a lifeline to a world in need of balance, shot through with stories about resolve, resilience, and wonder.\n\nCritic Marco Rivera described it best for music blog Splendid: “Be it through raucous rockers, fragile acoustic ballads, soulful touches of Irish folk, Neill's narrative talent and concern for real people's struggles stand out. The results are so evocative, you'll be tempted to steep further in these memories, the better to share Casey Neill's particular blend of personal and historical experience.”\n\nIn 1997 Casey Neill began a run of three songwriter albums for acoustic label Appleseed Recordings as well as contributing tracks to their Pete Seeger Tribute along with Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, and Bonnie Raitt. A compilation of his material entitled Memory Against Forgetting was released by Indigo Girl Amy Ray's Daemon imprint in 2005. Following a few years treading the boards in New York City, Neill moved back to the thriving music community in Portland, Oregon. In 2007, a far more electric record Brooklyn Bridge was released and The Norway Rats were formed to support it with members of The Decemberists and Eels. Neill is a frequent member of power pop band The Minus 5 along with Scott McCaughey and Peter Buck of R.E.M. Casey Neill & The Norway Rats recorded three records across the 2010's - the dreamy Americana of Goodbye to the Rank and File the art rock collection All You Pretty Vandals and the electro-folk and pop explorations of Subterrene. It’s been five years since their last album and Sending Up Flares is the sound of a band rallying together, turning the genre-bending range of its influences into the group's most cohesive, cathartic album yet.\n\n\"(Neill's) songs mask their complexities beneath a simple, singalong-worthy surface... these swimming waters have serious depth.\" - Rolling Stone\n\n\"These are songs with stories well told\" - Steve Earle\n\nLearn more at www.caseyneill.com\n\nView Event →\n\nSorcha Cribben-Merrill with Special Guests, Live! at the Barn at Barncastle\n\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE!\n\nDoors open at 6:00pm, show begins at 6:30pm. $15 general admission / $20 day-of door price (if available).
