        "text": "Many musical voices went silent in 2014. We lost singers, instrumentalists, composers, conductors, producers, DJs and other visionaries. Explore their musical legacies here.\n\nClaudio Abbado\n\nJune 26, 1933 — Jan. 20, 2014\n\nDirecting the premiere orchestras and opera companies of the world, including the Berlin Philharmonic and La Scala, Abbado was a self-effacing conductor whose inspired interpretations breathed freshness into music from Mozart to modernists. His devoted fans called themselves \"Abbadiani.\"\n\nClaudio Abbado - Mahler: Symphony No. 7 - III. Scherzo\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nRobert Ashley\n\nMarch 28, 1930 — March 3, 2014\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, this trailblazing composer wrote his idiosyncratic works not for opera houses, but for television. His intricate song-like recitations mused on everything from Renaissance philosophy to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nRobert Ashley: The Park\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nAmiri Baraka\n\nOct. 7, 1934 — Jan. 9, 2014\n\nThis controversial poet, author and essayist wasn't the first African-American to write seriously about black music, but he made it sing of history, community, struggle — that is, the blues.\n\nAmiri Baraka: 'Obama Poem'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nCarlo Bergonzi\n\nJuly 13, 1924 — July 25, 2014\n\nWith its robust blend of velvet and bronze, the voice of this durable Italian tenor was perfectly suited to heroic roles in Verdi's operas. Bergonzi's power and elegance were on display at New York's Metropolitan Opera for more than 30 years.\n\nCarlo Bergonzi - Verdi: Il Trovatore - 'Ah, si ben mio'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nDave Brockie\n\nAug. 30, 1963 — March 23, 2014\n\nWith buckets of fake blood at the ready the GWAR frontman (known onstage as Oderus Urungus) was a gleefully obscene, shock-rock satirist with a foam latex phallus.\n\nDave Brockie: 'Sick Of You'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nJack Bruce\n\nMay 14, 1943 — Oct. 25, 2014\n\nOne of rock's greatest bassists, he was also a singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who worked as a solo artist.

When that music gave way to harder-edged bebop, he made a brilliant transition to the new sound, always playing with a rich tone and lyrical style with a broad range of artists from Art Blakey to Billie Holiday.\n\nBuddy DeFranco: 'Gone With The Wind'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nPaco De Lucia\n\nDec. 21, 1947 — Feb. 26, 2014\n\nBy blending jazz and other strains of music into his playing, the forward-thinking Spanish guitarist pushed flamenco to places it had never been, while always remembering its roots.\n\nPaco de Lucia: 'Patio Custodio'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nPhil Everly\n\nJan. 19, 1939 — Jan. 3, 2014\n\nTaking the high parts in duets with his brother Don, Phil Everly (left), a harmonizer beyond compare, blended country, blues and pop in stories of young love, loss and ambition, pioneering a sound that became a basic building block of rock and roll.\n\nPhil Everly: 'All I Have To Do Is Dream'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nCheo Feliciano\n\nJul. 3, 1935 — Apr. 17, 2014\n\nThe velvety-voiced salsa pioneer from Puerto Rico trained with New York's Latin dance orchestras in the 1950s and became one of his generation's most recognizable voices. After bouts with addiction and homelessness, Feliciano roared back in the '70s as a superstar in the Fania Records stable.\n\nCheo Feliciano: 'Esto Es El Guaguanco'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nJuan Formell\n\nAug. 2, 1942 — May 1, 2014\n\nModern Cuban music sounds the way it does largely because of Formell's contributions as bandleader of the legendary Los Van Van — an enduring group with violins, trombones and a deep catalog of transcendently sensual songs.\n\nJuan Formell: 'Permiso Que Llego Van Van'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nCharlie Haden\n\nAug. 6, 1937 — July 11, 2014\n\nThe adventurous bassist and composer is well remembered as the low end of Ornette Coleman's free jazz revolution.

But he's perhaps best known for ethereal flute solos recorded in the Taj Mahal in 1968. The resulting album, Inside, made him a New Age music pioneer.\n\nPaul Horn: 'Mumtaz Mahal'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nCasey Kasem\n\nApril 27, 1932 — June 15, 2014\n\nFor 39 years, Kasem was the voice in America's ear, the disc jockey with the cheerfully mellow tone hosting American Top 40 and his own Casey's Top 40. He counted down the hits, fielded dedications and made pop music a warm and winning part of millions of lives.\n\nCasey Kasem: American Top 40\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nFrankie Knuckles\n\nJan. 8, 1955 — March 31, 2014\n\nThere was no such thing as house music when the DJ and producer born Francis Nicholls Jr. first put his needle on the record.

He had a modest string of solo hits for Motown in the late 1960s and early '70s, including one immortal classic, \"What Becomes Of The Brokenhearted.\"\n\nJimmy Ruffin: 'What Becomes Of The Brokenhearted'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nSabah\n\nNov. 9, 1927 — Nov. 28, 2014\n\nBlessed with a vivacious smile and an unbelievable voice, a struggling Christian girl from a very small town in Lebanon became the sultry toast of the entire Middle East for decades as a singer and actress, with more than 90 films and 50 albums under her sparkly belt.\n\nSabah: 'Yana Yana'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nJoe Sample\n\nFeb. 1, 1939 — Sept. 12, 2014\n\nMore than the \"smooth jazz\" label thrust upon him, the pianist was a melodic force in jazz from his earliest days as a member of the Jazz Crusaders to his days as a festival headliner.\n\nJoe Sample: 'Nite Crawler'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\n\"Little\" Jimmy Scott\n\nJuly 17, 1925 — June 12, 2014\n\nOne of the most distinctive voices in jazz was coupled with a story of bad breaks at the wrong times in his life.

Srinivas\n\nFeb. 28, 1969 — Sept. 19, 2014\n\nThe Indian virtuoso took the unlikeliest of instruments — the mandolin — and made it sound like honey. His remarkable musicianship spans traditional recordings of South Indian classical music to Remember Shakti, his supergroup with jazz guitarist John McLaughlin, tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain and percussionist V. Selvaganesh.\n\nU Srinivas: 'Gajavadhana'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nElaine Stritch\n\nFeb. 2, 1925 — July 17, 2014\n\nBetween post-World War II Broadway and 30 Rock, the fresh-faced bit player became a battle-scarred star — a Broadway legend and barstool sage. While she could have been a lady who lunched, she stayed onstage, defying time to preach a gospel of Sondheim and survival.\n\nElaine Stritch: 'Ladies Who Lunch'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nKenny Wheeler\n\nJan. 14, 1930 — Sept. 18, 2014\n\nWhether with the freest of free improvisers, or devising intricate melodies for large ensembles, the composer and trumpeter spoke with a singular and influential voice.\n\nKenny Wheeler: 'After All'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nGerald Wilson\n\nSept. 4, 1918 — Sept. 8, 2014\n\nThe jazz composer and bandleader mastered colorful, extended orchestration, which kept him employed arranging in the studios. He also deployed those skills toward his true love: leading his own big bands for more than half a century.\n\nGerald Wilson: 'Viva Tirado'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nJohnny Winter\n\nFeb. 23, 1944 — July 16, 2014\n\nThe best-selling blues-rock guitarist produced Grammy-winning late-career albums for Muddy Waters, but by then he'd already enjoyed a vast, decades-long career in his own right, both solo and with his brother Edgar.\n\nJohnny Winter: 'Be Careful With A Fool'\n\n0:30\n\nBack To Top\n\nBobby Womack\n\nMarch 4, 1944 — June 27, 2014\n\nThe gritty-voiced soul man and controversial Sam Cooke collaborator gifted us with 50 years of hard-livin' tunes that later influenced a generation of hip-hop era crooners, like Jaheim and K-Ci Hailey of Jodeci.\n\nBobby Womack: 'You're Welcome, Stop On By'\n\n0:30"
