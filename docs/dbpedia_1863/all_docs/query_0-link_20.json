        "text": "Aeon Rings (EP Release)\n\nFrom meeting in their Bushwick apartment for the first time in 2011; Davey Partain and Chuck Flores soon became fast musical accomplices in what soon became Aeon Rings The love for 80's synth new/darkwave and more modern hard hitting electro anthems fueled their passion to create the freshest dark electro music out today.\n\nMelody and intensity are the primary factors that set the mood for Aeon Rings outstanding live performances with imagery reminiscent of Blade Runner,Tron, and the soundscapes to match. All while giving a big nod to sounds that reflect Clan of xymox, Depeche mode as well as Ladytron and other electronic pioneers.\n\nWith a seamless blend of hooks, melodies and dark intensity. They've been welcomed by a vast range of audiences as well as great response by Internet radio.\n\nAndre Obin\n\nBased in Cambridge, Massachusetts, André Obin debuted in 2008 with a pair of digital download releases — the buzzing, predominantly instrumental \"Colorwheel\" single and five-track Premonition EP — for the Moodgadget label. Touring, along with additional short-form digital releases for Moodgadget, Trouw, Klopfgeist, and Mina, followed. At the 2012 Boston Music Awards, he was named Performer of the Year. The next year, he released his first proper album, The Arsonist, on Sky Council. The follow up, Ways of Escape (2014), show how Obin's sound has undergone a significant refinement with a gradual shift into a moody, tautly crafted, and modern form of synth pop.\n\nTeeel\n\nInspired by italo, electro and the 80s new wave movement, Teeel aka Jim Smith credits his sound to marathon movie watching and being an obsessive gear head. Crammed in a 10x10 teal painted room, stacked with synthesizers and walls covered with vintage Moog ads, Jim creates music that is perhaps best described as hypnotic soft-vocal, synthpop.\n\nCasey Desmond\n\nMy name is Casey Desmond.. I am a musician and artist, who sings, produces, writes, plays many instruments and also does artwork, photography and clothing designs. I went to school to learn some of these things and the rest I learned along the way. I think I am probably the poster child for the DIY generation of musicians since when you can't afford to hire anyone you need to \"Do It Yourself\". My latest video \"Talking to God\" (Watch it here) is a prime example of the DIY in action. I made the costumes, painted backgrounds and sets (with the help of my sister and any friends I could get to come over) and ended up working for a few months to get it all done. I'm very 'hands on\" and so (truth be told) and I love to be in the middle of the production process. My musical tastes are quite expansive and I like writing in many different genres. My preferred music for performance is electronic / dance oriented though I am delighted to sit down and do an acoustic set with a guitar and piano if anybody asks. I started out as more of a singer/songwriter before moving into the dance/electronic world. I've recorded with some great producers like Anthony Resta but all the songs start in my own studio where I can now record and mix an entire record from start to finish. I've had the opportunity to write a lot of material with hit songwriter Robert Ellis Orrall. Over the years I've amassed quite a studio set-up with more than a few keyboards:) As much as I like writing and recording, performing is where I have the most fun. I've done hundreds of shows in and around New England and have made many friends along the way. I really want to expand on that. I was in the middle of preparing the release of my EP when producers from the NBC TV's 'The Voice' called and asked me to come to California for two months and perform on the show. What an amazing and interesting offer! I put the EP on hold jumped on a plane. I learned a lot during my time there and made some great friends. There's no doubt that I was the one girl in the bunch no one knew exactly what to do with and it was a lot of fun confusing everyone while it lasted. While in Los Angeles I used the little free time I had to meet producers and performers who are huge in the cutting edge dance/electronica world, many of them play festivals like Electric Daisy, Nocturnal, Lightning in a Bottle, Ultra, Boom and Burning Man. New England has only echoes of that scene but to meet the folks making it happen was very inspiring. Now that my obligations to \"The Voice\" are over, I am focused again on the EP; collaborating with producers, DJ's and working on getting remixes of my songs while doing remixes of theirs. The collaborative environment of the electronic world is great for artistic experimentation right now. There are also powerful tools and softwares that will allow me to go out and perform and I am creating lighting cues, wardrobe and visuals for my next shows. I listen to a lot of Yeasayer, Black Moth, Super Rainbow, Cut Copy and as much strange pop and electro music as I can. People often compare me to Madonna, David Bowie, Annie Lennox, Cyndi Lauper, Dragonette, Marina and the Diamonds and pretty much any performer who wears fun make up and sings, which is very flattering but in the end I am most happy being myself and that can change at any moment!"
