        "text": "Interreality, curated by artist and former Night Gallery co-owner Mieke Marple, bridges the traditional and digital art worlds through the presentation of works that span the physical-to-digital spectrum. The exhibition is produced by Steven Sacks, founder and director of bitforms gallery, and Aubrie Wienholt, founder of PR for Artists, and is on view October 14 – November 25, 2023.\n\nFollowing LACMA’s exhibition Coded: Art Enters the Computer Age, 1952–1982, earlier this summer, conversations around technology’s influence on art-making have never been more pressing and relevant. Interreality enters this discourse with an expansive 35 artist group exhibition in a 15,000 square feet space at Desmond Tower, only a few blocks away from LACMA, to examine how the physical and digital, once perceived as separate realities, have in fact always been and will continue to be entangled.\n\nInterreality includes renowned digital artists such as pioneering artificial intelligence artist Refik Anadol (whose very popular solo show at the MoMA NY has been extended until October 2023) and established traditional artists such as Mark Flood (whose paintings respond to internet culture and whose work is in the collection of MOMA Fort Worth). The exhibition also features work by artists whose practices are heavily analog, such as Cindy Phenix, and primarily digital, such as Alida Sun in order to capture the entire physical-to-digital spectrum."
