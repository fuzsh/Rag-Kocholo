        "text": "Four weeks, 16 cut contestants, and countless melismas later, The Voice‘s battle rounds are finally over. Farewell, Stage 2 of NBC’s singing savior! You were occasionally exhilarating, occasionally infuriating, and altogether a pretty worthy successor to the blind auditions that made us fall in love with this show. Next week, we’ll find out how the series will operate as an American Idol-style live competition; I can’t wait, mainly because over the past month, I’ve gotten awfully sick of Christina’s boob-bearing, polka dotted dress and Cee Lo’s Crayola-inspired red ensemble. If there’s any justice, in the live rounds, each coach will make up for the battle rounds’ sartorial monotony by undergoing four costume changes per episode. A girl can dream, can’t she?\n\nTeam Adam started us off tonight. Maroon 5’s frontman asked his two remaining mentees, babyfaced Jeff Jenkins and “glam rocker” Casey Desmond, to sing a duet of Elton John’s “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me.” Casey must have somehow anticipated the assignment, because during rehearsals, she was wearing a garish purple and turquoise capri-length romper that Elton himself probably would approve of. (Somehow, though, this wasn’t the worst outfit of the episode. That (dis)honor goes to Lily Elise’s getup, which I discuss in detail on the next page.) In retrospect, I’m sort of thankful that Casey isn’t sticking around; my puny human eyes could barely handle the contrasting, multicolored spectacle of her. Looking at Casey feels like staring directly at an isolated neon sign.\n\nBut I digress. As that delightfully cheesy theme music reminds us each time we return from a commercial break, this is The Voice — not The Look. And, in terms of vocal ability, Casey and Jeff weren’t as mismatched as some of the other pairs we’ve seen pitted against one another…or, at least, they didn’t seem to be during rehearsals. In an interview, Jeff even confessed that he was nervous about singing with Casey, because she’s “such an incredible talent.”\n\nBut when it came time for the couple’s final performance, it was easy to see why Adam had remarked that this battle would be Jeff’s to lose. The country boy with the golden pipes absolutely killed, though his impassioned, jerky movements were a little distracting. (Someone call the Soul Patrol!) As soon as he opened his mouth, Jeff had Blake mouthing “Wow” and girls in the audience squealing. From the start of the duet, then, poor Casey didn’t really stand a chance. At least she can always fall back on her fashion designing!\n\nBlake followed Jeff’s triumph with a pairing that was bound to make for scintillating television: the Battle of the Shy Girls. Step right up, folks, to watch two reserved, brunette teenagers struggle to appear interesting! At least their bashfulness doesn’t ring as false as Dia Frampton’s supposed music biz naivete. The coach had Xenia No-Last-Name and Sara Oromchi sing “I’ll Stand By You,” a song they both probably know best as a Carrie Underwood single. During rehearsals, we learned that Sara has a much larger range than Xenia, while Xenia’s raspy tone is much more unique than Sara’s more conventional sound. Drama! Conflict! Kinda.\n\nNEXT: A grey hood made of sweatshirt material, connected directly to the shorts via suspenders.\n\nBoth shy gals started off a little shakily during the final performance, and neither one recovered fully by the end of the song. Xenia sounded cool and smokey, but her limited range really stood out in a bad way whenever Sara sang. And while Sara definitely doesn’t have the strongest voice in the competition, she was having a lot more success hitting different notes than Xenia. In going for those notes, though, Sara also went flat and sharp a lot more often than her competitor. The girls weren’t totally to blame for their lackluster performances; as Adam astutely observed, the song itself just wasn’t a great fit for either of their voices. (After this, Blake defended his choice with this lame comeback: “It is a tough song. But the music industry is tough.”)\n\nSo why, then, did Blake end up giving Xenia the win? The decision really puzzled me; he couldn’t have made it based solely on the duet. Neither Xenia nor Sara was blew it out of the park, but the latter definitely sounded stronger overall on “I’ll Stand By You.” Could it be that the voice isn’t necessarily the be all and end all on The Voice? Say it ain’t so, Carson!\n\nChristina’s remaining two teammates, Cherie Oakley and Lily Elise, were up next. I knew I’d love their battle as soon as Xtina announced what they’d be singing: Kelly Clarkson’s “Since U Been Gone,” a.k.a. “You Outta Know” for the millenial generation. The coach cautioned her subjects that they’d need some serious lung power to do the song justice. Then, in rehearsal, Lily somehow impressed Christina by interpreting “lung power” to mean “sharp yelling.” Such is Team Christina, I suppose — “I’m not looking for perfection,” the coach later explained during the one-on-ones. “I’m looking for passion and emotion.” Be careful what you wish for, my little diva.\n\nThe only thing less pleasant than Lily’s big bum note was the shiny, chartreuse bomber jacket she wore while emitting said note. And then, during the performance, things took a turn for the hideous. Here is what Lily elected to wear while singing for her life on national television:\n\n– A black and grey zebra-striped shirt\n\n– Tiny black hot pants that may or may not have been made of satin\n\n– Xtina-tall red open-toed heels\n\n– Giant, matching red hoop earrings\n\n– A necklace with a large, splashy “Lily” pendant\n\n– And, the piece de resistance, a grey hood made of sweatshirt material, connected directly to the shorts via suspenders.\n\nThat’s all I have to say about that. Oh, except for this: Christina loved the outfit.\n\nNEXT: What’s that you say? This is a singing competition? Fine, we can talk about the performance itself.\n\nAs the duet progressed, Lily and Cherie both tried to stay on key while doing their best scorned woman impressions. Both had a few truly impressive moments throughout the performance. But overall, Lily had a lot more stage presence than her competition; her confident strutting more than made up for the few notes she missed. When they were done, Cee Lo told the pair that while Cherie was more controlled, he liked Lily’s attitude — and in the end, Christina decided that swag was a more valuable asset than restraint. At least Cherie got a chance to meet Reba McEntire, the woman who turned her song “On the Radio” into a hit.\n\nReally, Alison Haislip? Your “Twitter traffic is bumper to bumper with questions about the judges’ personal style”? I find that hard to believe, particularly because we’ve watched these people wear the same damn outfits since May 10.\n\nTeam Cee Lo closed the night with a duet between two best friends who seem to be following an example set by Ashton and Natalie (or Justin and Mila, if they’re more your speed). Tattooed ex-Idol contestant Emily Valentine and Curtis Grimes, another smooth-voiced country dude, were tasked with singing “Need You Now,” Lady Antebellum’s plaintive ode to drunken booty calls. The choice of song was a little too perfect — Curtis told us that he’d formed a tight bond with Emily throughout the first three weeks of the competition, and Emily later confessed that she had a crush on her duet partner.\n\nCurtis and Emily’s close relationship and their obvious chemistry definitely had a positive effect on their duet. As they performed, their voices complemented each other beautifully; their performance was the night’s most balanced and harmonious. I thought Emily made a stronger impression overall, though maybe that was just because Curtis supported her so well when she took the lead.\n\nThe pair eventually shocked everyone — especially Cee Lo, whose jaw may have actually touched the floor at one point — when they sealed their song with a passionate kiss. “One of you is going home. Not alone, I guess!” Carson quipped when Curtis and Emily came up for air. Blake followed that with another witticism: “Cee Lo probably told y’all that he wanted y’all to duet. Not do it.”\n\nAnd then the moment was over, and Cee Lo had to make a tough decision. He elected to keep Curtis and cut Emily, though he didn’t really elect to explain this decision. Maybe he wanted to keep his team — which already included Vicci Martinez, the Thompson sisters, and Nakia — from getting too female-heavy. Regardless, I was disappointed; Emily deserved to stay. Maybe she, Tje Austin, and Niki Dawson can form an all-star “Rejected By Cee Lo” group. Their first single? A cover of “F— You,” of course.\n\nAnd with that, we bid the battle rounds adieu. Next week, The Voice will move back to its 9pm time slot, and it’ll also be two hours long once again. How pumped are you for the live shows? What song do you think the judges will perform together? (Fingers crossed for something from Mi Reflejo!) Which rejected singers do you wish had made it to the final round of the competition? And which member of the Sweet 16 are you rooting for the most?"
