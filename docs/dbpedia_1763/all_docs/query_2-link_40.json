Duke's three primary outfielders all had a fielding percentage of .975 or higher in 2011.\n\nPrior to coming to Duke, Thompson spent two seasons as head coach at Bates and led the Bobcats to a 25-11 record in 2010 in only his second season. Bates' school-record 25 wins under Thompson marked the first 20-win season in the program's 138-year history and the first winning season since 1992. Five Bates players earned All-NESCAC honors in Thompson's second year while the team led the conference in home runs, stolen bases and fielding percentage and ranked second in batting average and slugging percentage. Thompson's 2010 squad had the fewest errors in the nation in Division III and finished seventh in the country with a .970 fielding percentage that season. That 2010 team also finished 19th in the country in hitting with a .354 average.\n\nPrior to his two-year stint at Bates, Thompson served as an associate head coach and recruiting coordinator at the University of Maine at Farmington. At UMF, Thompson oversaw the pitching staff and recruited and coached eight players who went on to earn all-conference honors.\n\nThompson began his collegiate career at Howard University where he was named the team's offensive rookie of the year. He then spent one season at Maryland where he appeared in 34 games for the Terrapins and hit .250 with eight doubles and one home run. Thompson then played his last two seasons at Webber University where he led the team to an NAIA top-25 ranking and played in the Florida Sun Conference All-Star Game.\n\nThompson also spent one year in professional baseball playing for the independent-league Bangor Lumberjacks in 2003 where he led all Lumberjack rookies in extra-base hits."
