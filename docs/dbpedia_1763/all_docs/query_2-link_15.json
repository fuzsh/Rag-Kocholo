        "text": "Career record of 927-549-6 over 29 seasons\n\nFour FCSAA state championships (1997, 1998, 2022, 2023)\n\nOne NJCAA National Championship - 2023\n\nFour-time FCSAA Coach of the Year\n\nEight-time Mid-Florida Conference Coach of the Year\n\nHead coach Marty Smith enters his 30th season for the Patriots and second year as the Manager of Athletics for the College of Central Florida. In 2023 Smith became one of only two active coaches in the state to reach 900 wins in the FCSAA.\n\nSmith led the Patriots to the 2023 NJCAA Division 1 National Championship with a school record 56-7 mark in 2023, with the Pats shattering many records including wins and home runs in a season (119).\n\nSmith led the program to its second consecutive Mid-Florida Conference Championship and second consecutive FCSAA State and South-Atlantic District Championship.\n\nSmith's 2023 squad garnered four 1st Team All-State selections and Two 2nd Team All-State selections. The 2023 Patriot team produced One 1st Team All-American (John Marant), One 2nd Team All-American selection (Edwin Toribio) and one Honorable Mention All-American (Cam Schuelke). The 2023 Patriot National Championship Team saw all 10 graduating Patriots move on to NCAA Division 1 schools to continue playing. Bradke Lohry (U. Tenn), Cam Schuelke (Miss. State U), John Marant (U. Georgia), JD Smith (Ga. Tech), Carson Bayne (UNC-Charlotte), Thad Ector (UNC-Charlotte), Juan Correa (UNC-Charlotte), Brian Holiday (Oklahoma State), Andrew Herrmann (La. Monroe), and Keller Eberly (Texas State).\n\nIn 2017, Smith had the highest draft pick come out of his program to-date in RHP Nate Pearson, who was selected 28th overall (Rd. 1) by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2017 MLB Draft. Pearson, Rawlings JUCO National Pitcher of the Year, and a Golden Spikes Award finalist, was the second highest JUCO player drafted in 2017.\n\nA Jacksonville native, Smith has been a fixture of Florida baseball since his high school playing days at Terry Parker High School. He joined the Patriots in 1984, playing two seasons under coach Dr. Roger \"Marty\" Martinsen and earning All-Mid-Florida Conference honors as a sophomore, then completed his playing career at St. Thomas University in Miami, where he played for ABCA and NCAA Hall of Fame skipper Paul Mainieri. Smith launched his coaching career immediately after college, joining the staff of NJCAA Hall of Fame coach Demie Mainieri at Miami Dade College. There he helped lead a squad led by future Major League Baseball star Mike Piazza to an FCSAA State Tournament berth. He followed a two-year stint at Miami Dade with a season at FSC-Jacksonville, where he assisted Howard Roey, another NJCAA Hall of Famer, in guiding the Stars to the 1990 FCCAA championship.\n\nSmith returned to his alma mater in 1991 as an assistant to Dr. Martinsen, and ultimately succeeded his retiring mentor as Patriots head coach in 1994. Three years into his tenure, Smith won the first of two consecutive FCSAA state championships, taking the Patriots to the Juco World Series in 1997 and 1998. In addition, Smith's teams have won eight MFC championships (1996, 1997, 2001, 2004 2007, 2019, 2022, 2023) and finished as state runner-up on two occasions (2004 and 2007).\n\nOver the years, Smith has moved-on hundreds of players to the Div. I, II, III and NAIA levels. He has also had many players taken in the Major League Baseball Draft over the course of his career.

In 2004, Smith served as head coach of the NJCAA's All-Star entry in the NJCAA-China Friendship Series, leading his team to four wins in five games at Beijing.
