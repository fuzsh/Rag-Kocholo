        "text": "AFCA Coach Of The Year\n\nLynn “Pappy” Waldorf, then of North­western, was named as the first AFCA Coach of the Year in 1935. One national winner was selected from 1935 through 1959. From 1960 through 1982, two national winners were selected —\n\none representing the University Division and one from the College Division. From 1983-2005, four national winners were chosen.\n\nIn 2006, the AFCA started honoring an NAIA Coach of the Year, bringing the total to the five honorees we have today. Prior to 2006, the NAIA was a part of the AFCA’s Division II membership category.\n\nVoting Process\n\nThe current balloting procedure involves selection of 25 regional winners: five regional winners in each of the five divisions – FBS, FCS, Division II, Division III and NAIA, who become finalist for national coach of the year. Following regional voting, five national winners – one from each division – are chosen.\n\nPast Award Winners\n\nFootball Bowl Subdivision\n\n1935 Lynn Waldorf, Northwestern\n\n1936 Dick Harlow, Harvard\n\n1937 Edward E.

The AFCA has been overseeing the selection of the teams since 1997, taking over from the College Football Association (now defunct), which originated the concept in Division I-A in 1992. The AFCA expanded the program to include all four-year collegiate divisions.\n\nNominations are submitted early in the summer by sports information directors around the country. Nominees must be actively involved and committed to working with a charitable organization, service group or community service and maintain good grades.\n\nCandidates must display sincere concern and reliability, while also having made a favorable impression on the organizations with which they are involved. Athletic ability is not a criterion.\n\nLearn More About the 2023 Allstate AFCA Good Works Team\n\nThe AFCA Coaches Trophy Presented by US LBM\n\nSince 1986, the winner of the UPI or Coaches Poll has received the AFCA Coaches’ Trophy. The trophy features a football made of Waterford crystal and an ebony base. After its presentation, the original trophy is displayed on the campus of the winning school.\n\nThe trophy will be awarded to the No. 1-ranked team, and national champion, in the Coaches Poll following the conclusion of the college football season.\n\nThe Coaches’ Trophy was first presented to the winner of the UPI Coaches’ Poll in 1986, when it was sponsored by the Gerrits/Pepsi Cola Foundation. McDonalds presented the trophy from 1991 to 1993. From 1994 to 2001, the trophy was presented by Sears as part of its Collegiate Champions program. Circuit City was the sponsor of the trophy in 2002, then ADT Security Services took over the sponsorship from 2003 to 2005, followed by Dr. Pepper from 2009-13, and Amway from 2004-2020. US LBM became the presenting sponsor in 2023.\n\nThe AFCA also awards trophies to the national champions in NCAA Divisions FCS, II, III, and the NAIA, along with plaques to all AFCA-member coaches whose teams win conference championships, or for those not affiliated with a conference and qualify for the playoffs in their respective NCAA or NAIA divisions.\n\nTuss McLaughry Award\n\nThe Tuss McLaughry Award is given to a distinguished American (or Americans) for the highest distinction in service to others. It is named in honor of DeOrmond “Tuss” McLaughry, the first full-time secretary-treasurer of the AFCA and one of the most dedicated and influential members in the history of the Association.\n\nThe award was established in 1964. The recipient is endorsed by the AFCA Board of Trustees after being nominated by the McLaughry Award Committee.\n\nMcLaughry played a leading role in the development of the AFCA while at the same time establishing a reputation as a successful head coach at some of the most prestigious academic schools in the East. He worked diligently throughout his lifetime to advance the best interests of the football coaching profession.\n\nPast Award Winners\n\n1964 Gen.

Since this award is so prestigious, we ask state high school coaches associations to nominate the most deserving head football coach in their organization.\n\nThe AFCA and The Foundation take great pride in nationally recognizing a high school football head coach who, for a lifetime, has had a powerful influence on his staff, players, and his community.\n\nPast Award Winners\n\n2002 Larry Dippel, Amarillo (Texas) H.S.\n\n2003 John McKissick, Summerville (S.C.)

The award recognized the CFA-member FBS institution with the highest graduation rate among members of its football team.\n\nWith the disintegration of the CFA, the American Football Coaches Association stepped in to continue to present the award, along with long-time partner, the Memphis Touchdown Club. The criteria for the AFCA’s Academic Achievement Award is based on the highest NCAA Graduation Success Rate, at least 15 students in the GSR Cohort, and a Federal Graduation Rate of 75 percent or better.\n\nFor more information on the Memphis Touchdown Club, visit www.tdcmemphis.com\n\nTrailblazer Award\n\nThe AFCA Trailblazer Award was created to honor early leaders in the football coaching profession who coached at historically black colleges and universities. For a five-year period, the Trailblazer Award will be given to an individual who coached in a certain decade. The inaugural winner coached in the decade from 1920 to 1929, with the five-year cycle ending in 2008 and a winner coming from the 1960-1969 decade. In 2009, the cycle started over with a winner coming from the decade between 1920 and 1929.\n\nPast Award Winners\n\n2004 Charles Williams, Hampton\n\n2005 Cleve Abbott, Tuskegee\n\n2006 Arnett Mumford, Southern\n\n2007 Billy Nicks, Prairie View A&M\n\n2008 Alonzo “Jake” Gaither, Florida A&M\n\n2009 Fred “Pops” Long, Wiley\n\n2010 Harry R. “Big Jeff” Jefferson, Bluefield State\n\n2011 Edward P.

In 2000, the AFCA invited the organizations to meet at the AFCA Convention. Three national goals were set: to form a national community college football coaches¹ association, to study the possibility of a national championship game between the two organizations and to select a yearly National Coach of the Year who would be recognized by the AFCA. Their initial goal, to create an umbrella coaches association, has been accomplished. In 2002, the American Community College Football Coaches Association selected its first national coach of the year, Michael White of Reedley College.\n\nPast Award Winners\n\n2003 Troy Morrell, Butler Community College\n\n2004 Tim Hatten, Pearl River Community\n\nCollege\n\n2005 Don Dillon, American River College\n\n2006 John Featherstone, El Camino College\n\n2007 Jeff Chudy, Bakersfield College\n\n2008 Jeff Jordan, Butte College\n\n2009 Brad Franchione, Blinn College\n\n2010 Bob Jastrab, Mt.

What makes this team special is that it is the only one selected exclusively by the men who know the most about the players, the coaches themselves.\n\nThe AFCA currently selects an All-America team in five divisions: Football Bowl Subdivision, Football Championship Subdivision, Division II, Division III and NAIA. Starting in 2016, there are now two 25-player teams is chosen in each division.\n\nFour of the five AFCA divisions have an All-America Selection Committee consisting of a committee chairman, a district representative head coach from each of the AFCA districts in each division and two committeemen in each district who are also head coaches. The FBS Coaches’ All-America Team is currently selected by an on-line vote and does not have a selection committee.\n\nThe selection committees in each division conduct a conference call to select the team. The committee chairman and the district representatives are on the call. The district committeemen are not. Prior to the call, the district chairmen and his committeemen are responsible for gathering information on worthy players in their districts.\n\n2023 All-America Teams\n\nFBS Coaches’ All-America Teams\n\nFCS Coaches All-America Teams\n\nDII Coaches’ All-America Teams\n\nDIII Coaches’ All-America Teams\n\nNAIA Coaches’ All-America Teams"
