Cameren’s research interests focus on athletic career transition/sport retirement, athletic transition psychoeducation/programming, and student athlete mental health.\n\nLindsay Ross-Stewart: Dr. Ross-Stewart is an Associate Professor in the Department of Applied Health at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Dr. Ross-Stewart’s research is grounded in Bandura’s concept of self- efficacy and its role in behavior change. Dr. Ross-Stewart is an Association for Applied Sport Psychology Certified Mental Performance Consultant (CMPC®) and a Canadian Sport Psychology Association Mental Performance Consultant (MPC).\n\nPerceptions of Former Collegiate Athletes on Career Transition Programs in the NCAA\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMany student athletes experience feelings of grief, sadness, loss of motivation, and depressive symptoms due to improperly preparing for sport retirement (1). Past literature encourages practitioners to incorporate psychoeducational programming into NCAA athletic programs that better prepare athletes for transition. However, it has been found that there is a lack of consensus on when and what is being advised to student athletes about the transition process (2). Additionally, little research has investigated the overall effectiveness of NCAA collegiate career transitioning programs through the perceptions of student athletes. The purpose of this study was to investigate if current career transition programs in NCAA Athletic Departments were using best practices, as defined by the current research in the field, based on former collegiate athlete’s perceptions of their experience with career transition programming. A secondary and equally important purpose was to investigate the overall impact athletic career transition had on former collegiate athletes’ current lives. Former collegiate student athletes completed semi – structured interviews via Zoom to assess their experience with career transition programming during their time as an athlete and the level of effectiveness they felt the program offered. The findings of this study suggest that NCAA athletic departments need to implement effective athletic career transition programming that better prepares student athletes to transition from collegiate sport.\n\nKeywords: career transition, qualitative research, sport psychology\n\nCollege student athletes dedicate approximately 70 hours per week to athletic and academic demands (3). With less than two percent of National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) student athletes competing on the professional level (4), most student athletes will transition out of athletics when they graduate from university. This transition time led to increased feelings of grief, sadness, loss of motivation, and depressive symptoms for some athletes (1). To prevent these negative experiences, career transition researchers have encouraged athletic departments to implement psychoeducational programming that better prepares student athletes for the psychological, behavioral, and social outcomes of sport retirement (5). However, it has been found that there is a lack of consensus on when and what is being advised to student athletes about the transition process (2). Additionally, little research has investigated the overall effectiveness of NCAA collegiate career transitioning programs through the perceptions of student athletes.\n\nA recent literature review of career transition research (6) found there were very few studies conducted in the United States concerning athletic transition, with the limited findings highlighting retirement planning, identity loss, coping skills and support systems as the core areas that have been investigated. They reiterated the importance of psychoeducational interventions; however, they acknowledged that more research is needed to better understand the transition process and how to effectively implement career transition programing.\n\nPast research has also highlighted the findings that career transitions appear through social, developmental, and psychological factors (5) and the importance of starting career transition education at the earliest stages of sports participation. The importance of social support has been supported by the work of Adams et al. (7) who found participants experienced a more positive transition if they felt cared for by the people that they believed understood them and what they were going through. Thus, a sense of closeness and trust between the recipient and the person providing support appeared to be crucial for support during career transitions. Of importance was the finding that athletes perceived coaches to provide more social support than parents and teammates indicating coaches should be a central part of career transition programming. Cummins and O’Boyle (8) found that athletes perceived their universities as unable to support them during the transition process with support, career advice and information on the professional role and guidance from past student athletes. Thus, the lack of career control was shown by all participants. Cummins and O’Boyle (8) recommended implementing mentoring into university programs from former student athletes to current student athletes on the transition process and potential career opportunities.\n\nAlong with social support, one’s athletic identity has been highlighted as impacting an athlete’s experience with career transition. Specifically, the more an athlete identifies with their athletic role, the less likely they are to have a well-defined career plan (9) and therefore struggle during career transition. Furthering this finding, researchers found that athletic identity was positively correlated to retirement outcomes and negatively correlated with decreased self-esteem, feelings of uncontrollability and ‘vagueness’ about the future (10). It has also been shown that athletes who retired due to injury have greater adjustment difficulties (10). Furthermore, researchers found that the strength and exclusivity of the athletic role during sport participation increased an athlete’s potential vulnerability to psychiatric distress after leaving sport (11), and higher levels of emotional adjustment difficulties (12). In contrast to these negative connections to athletic identity, Cabrita et. al, (13) found that athletes with higher athletic identity have higher levels of career decision making self- efficacy. They suggested this may be due to the efficacy they gain from sport transferring to their career decision making efficacy. Further research is needed to better understand these potentially conflicting findings on the relationship between athletic identity and career transition.\n\nMenke and Germany (14), identified consistent themes athletes identified when discussing their feelings and thoughts related to coping with transition out of sport including the positive of gains or strength of transferable skills as well as the negative experiences of a loss of identity, feelings of loss, sadness, anxiety, loss of motivation and depressive symptoms. It has been shown that global self-esteem and physical self-perceptions decreased during the transition out of elite sport (15). Additionally, it was found that retired athletes that experience difficulties with their bodies have decreased feelings of pride, satisfaction, happiness, and confidence regarding their physical selves. These experiences can contribute to stressful reactions to retiring out of sport. Of extra importance is the finding that sport individuals that experience bodily changes accompanied with high athletic identity can experience increased psychiatric distress and self-esteem issues when transitioning (15).\n\nTaken together, the above information highlights the need for career transition programming and combining a plan for post-sport retirement with talking about the emotions experienced during the transition process. Past researchers have suggested that sport psychology practitioners and mental health professionals work with athletic teams to encourage the development of the student athlete by consistently speaking to them about career related topics and encouraging student athletes to explore and engage in expanding their interests outside of sport as well as supporting the use of health care resources for former high-level athletes (16).\n\nDuring sport retirement, many athletes cognitively make the decision to grieve the loss of their sport by participating in healthy and unhealthy coping behaviors for extra support. Acceptance, account making, positive reinterpretation, planning, active coping, mental disengagement and seeking social support for emotional reasons are all strategies that have been reported (12). Account-making (the construction of a story about a traumatic event (i.e., it’s nature, what happened, how one feel’s about it, and what it means for the future; citation) and confiding (portions of one’s account, are revealed to others) has also been shown to be an effective tool as it helps athletes to understand their retirement experience, understand their emotions and to acknowledge an identity that is outside of sport.\n\nRecent literature reviews have encouraged viewing transition from a lifespan perspective involving pre-career, post-career, and other domains of an athlete’s life (17), and preparing for retirement before it happens, creating a strong alliance with trust (client and counselor), exploring the emotions accompanied with the transition, interventions, and knowledge of transferable skills, addressing athlete’s overall competency of transferable skills, developing a support network, and evaluating the effectiveness of the athletes transitions out of sport and the effectiveness of counseling interventions. Based on the literature review, the researchers recommended that counselors may be effective in assisting athletes to plan for life after sport by helping them understand and realize that the skills they have acquired through sport can help them be successful in other areas of life (18).\n\nFurthering our understanding of best practice, researchers have recommended empathy and attentive listening need to be utilized to help athletes make sense of their experiences and it has been recommended that programming should look at the development of interventions from different psychological perspectives for athletes in transition (5). Overall, researchers suggest the need to examine the effectiveness of these models and devote attention to interventions from different psychological perspectives. Lastly, they highlight the finding that helping athletes become aware of the transferrable skills can help facilitate successful career planning.\n\nResearchers have continuously suggested the need for psychoeducational interventions that address the psychological, behavioral, social effects and the loss of athletic identity has on a sport individual when transitioning from sport and the need to start this programming early in an athlete’s college career (e.g., 5). Being that there is a lack of consensus on when and how to speak to athletes about career transition, and a lack of connection between research suggested guidelines and applied programming at the college level, further understanding of this area is needed. Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to investigate former NCAA athlete’s perceptions of current career transition programs in NCAA Athletic Departments. A secondary purpose was to investigate former collegiate athlete’s perceptions of their experience transitioning from sport and how these experiences affected their current lives.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nMethods\n\nSetting, Recruiting, Sampling, and Consent\n\nAll participants were recruited via social media. Posts were made on both researchers’ Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter pages, as well as shared on their program social media sites. People were encouraged to share the posts with people they may have known who would be interested. Potential participants were instructed on how to reach the primary researcher if they were interested in participation. The primary researcher then spoke with each potential participant to make sure they were a former NCAA athlete who finished their career within the last five years but did not suffer a career ending injury or quit their college career (which were the exclusion criteria). Those that qualified were interviewed over zoom for this study. Zoom was chosen as it allowed for participants from across the United States and increased the accessibility of the study to participants. Prior to the interview the participants were sent the informed consent form and gave consent to participate. They then gave verbal consent on zoom while the session was being recorded. Participants were also given the opportunity to ask any clarification questions about the study they may have had after reading the informed consent.\n\nParticipants\n\nThe participants of this study were six retired collegiate student athletes who previously competed in NCAA athletic programs and completed their athletic careers in the five years. The participants were two males and four females. Participants were represented from various sports consisting of basketball, track & field, softball, baseball, and golf. The athletes were from Division I (n=four), Division II (n=one), and Division III (n=one).\n\nData Collection Tools\n\nCareer Transition Interview\n\nAs there is a lack of set tools for assessing the psychological impact of career transition for college athletes, and to hear the voices of those who have experiences career transition, – semi structured, questions (some open and some closed based on need) were developed for this study. The goal was to allow the participants to reflect on their personal experiences with career transition programming at the universities they competed in and their overall transition experience. The important themes recognized in previous athletic career transition literature were used to develop questions for the interviews focused on their career transition program experience and their experiences post-tradition career. A specific focus was made to keep the questions neutral in language so as not to lead the participants in any direction. During the interviews, based on the participant’s comments, follow up questions were asked, and discussion was encouraged with the athlete to gain their views outside of the predetermined questions, as needed the closed questions were aimed at understanding the organization of any career transition programing they may have had during their athletic career (e.g., “Did your university have an athletic career transition program or workshop? And “How often did this program occur at your university?”) as well as understanding their demographics (e.g., “What is your age” “What sport did you play”). year were you when you participated in this program?). To better understand their experiences and truly give the participants a chance to process their experiences in their own words, open-ended questions were used. Example questions included “What was your athletic career transition experience like?,” “How did transitioning from sport make you feel?” and “During your transition experience, what did you do/not do to cope?\n\nProcedures\n\nData Analyses\n\nA six phase Reflexive thematic approach was used with the essentialist/realist method for qualitative data (19-22). This method is used to identify, analyze, and report patterns (themes) within a given data set. Additionally, it is used to describe and interpret the meaning and importance of the patterns (themes) found. The Essentialist/Realist method is used to report experiences, meanings, and the reality of participants (19), which was used to analyze the perceptions and personalized experiences from former collegiate athletes. Of importance for this approach is to acknowledge that we all perceive the environment and impact it through those perceptions. Therefore, giving as much room for the exact voice of the participants is needed to minimize the participants experiences being reported through the researcher’s lens alone. Therefore, this paper gives significant space to each participant’s voice, which is possible due to the sample size of six people. Utilizing the ‘top-down approach’ also known as deductive approach (23), this study analyzed semantic themes that are suggested within previous career transition literature to implement into athletic career transition programming for student athletes However, ideas that emerged that did not fit within current literature were also noted and coded to add to the already existing literature. In qualitative research, the researchers and coders must assess their biases and perceptions as it relates to the research topic. In this study, the data was coded by two coders, the primary researcher, a former collegiate athlete whose career ended two years before data analysis recognized that her own experiences were a potential bias to the study. Therefore, several methods of checking trustworthiness were used (See Trustworthiness section below). The second coder was not involved in the study at all and was not a former collegiate athlete, nor were they familiar with the literature in the area.\n\nFollowing the guidelines of Braun and Clarke (19-23) both coders followed a six-step process. Prior to coding all interviews were electronically transcribed using zoom transcription services, and all transcriptions were checked for accuracy against the recorded interviews. To start the coding process both coders familiarized themselves with the data by reading all the transcripts. The coders then independently recorded points of interest in the transcripts as they began to generate the initial codes, making sure to code each piece of data available. Data could be an individual word (e.g., the answer “yes” to a closed question) or as long as a few sentences (e.g., “Even though I did not struggle a lot, I think it still would have been nice to have a transition program in those later years of college just to learn how to be an adult on your own without sports ruling your life”). Focusing on the context of a comment opposed to the length when deciding on a code was done in line with the recommendations of past researchers (e.g., 20). Next, coders began to develop themes with past research in career transition in mind. Again, this deductive approach did not mean discarding data that did not fit in a prior identified theme, but instead recognized past information while new themes that emerged were also identified and titled with this new information being an addition to our current understanding of the career transition experience in the field. The coders then compared their codes and themes and when in disagreement engaged in thoughtful discourse explaining their rationale for their coding choice, while being cognizant of their potential biases. This process led to agreement between the coders in the few places where there was initial disagreement. Finally, the overall themes and codes are explained in detail in this manuscript as is noted as an important step in thematic analysis.\n\nTrustworthiness\n\nTrustworthiness was assessed in multiple ways to increase the credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability of the study (19-22;24, 25). In addition to an acknowledgement of the researcher’s viewpoint and the reality that all researcher’s perspective’s impact their analysis, both coders of the data assessed their own views and were systematic in assessing the impact of these views throughout the research. Furthermore, as the lead researcher of this study was a former NCAA athlete, and as such recognized that this may have led to potential biases peer debriefing was used to increase credibility. Furthermore, a third coder, who was familiar with the research in the field but did not conduct the interviews or participate in the original data analysis was brought in to engaged in negative case analysis to assess any divergent data and discuss these findings to make sure they were appropriately accounted for in the data coding. Internal auditing was also done by two researchers who were not a part of this study, nor familiar with the research on career transition in sport, to highlight and address any potentially biased interpretations of the data. The detailed documentation of the procedures used for this study at each stage following the guidelines of the APA Journal Article Reporting Standards for Qualitative Research (2018), along with using thick description in this manuscript was done to increase dependability and transferability.\n\nResults\n\nThe major themes that emerged throughout the data were lack of athletic career transition programming, high athletic identity, lack of psychological support, social support, coping mechanisms and the Covid-19 pandemic. Note that participants’ names have been changed to maintain confidentiality. Pseudonyms given are representative of names that match the self- reported gender and race of each participant.\n\nLack of Athletic Career Transition Programming\n\nIt was found that four out of six participants experienced a positive overall career transition from athletics and described their experience as ‘easy’ and ‘smooth sailing.’ However, two of the participants in this study experienced a negative overall career transition from athletics. When it came to access to career transition programming, only two of the participants had access to transition programs from their universities. Example comments related to this are included Leah commenting, ‘I don’t even know where to begin, I felt so unprepared to go out into the world.’ and Andrea stating, ‘My transition experience was a little rocky and it had an effect on how I was mentally.’ Mary said, ‘Even though I did not struggle a lot, I think it still would have been nice to have a transition program in those later years of college just to learn how to be an adult on your own without sports ruling your life.’ Two participants recalled their athletic departments referring them to their on-campus career center for career assistance. For example, Kelly noted, ‘The programs that were available to me via the career center were focused on interviewing skills, portfolio/resume building and career fairs; none of these events catered to my athletic experience.’ Andrea who did have access to career transition programming, indicated that their school had the NCAA Life Skills Program (NCAA, 1994). She stated, ‘I definitely found this program to be helpful and I felt as though I needed those skills to be able to transition from college into the outside world.’ Although Andrea spoke highly of the Life skill program at her previous university, she still reported a negative transition due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Chance recalled his previous athletic department hosting optional career transition programming that he did not attend due to the programs conflicting with his schedule. ‘I felt like it would have been helpful, I just did not feel like I had the time to do it with athletics and my class schedule.’ When looking at the differences between programming across the three different division levels present in this study, both Andrea and Chance were in Division I programs. Chelsea, who participated within Division III stated, ‘We weren’t provided with a lot of resources being the lower level and I think it had to do with finances as well as compliance.’\n\nWhen asked what participants would value within athletic career transition programming, participants noted the importance of programming on financial topics (budgeting, taxes, financing vehicles and homes), programs for juniors and seniors on resources for transition. For example, Chelsea stated, I think a big topic that needs to be talked about in depth is financials because as an athlete, you spend a lot of your time on the road, and you don’t necessarily go out all of the time to spend money because you are giving per- diem and gear etc. When you are not an athlete, you are not provided with those things anymore.\n\nAs well as making programming more accessible,\n\nI think it would be helpful to make the programs more available for everybody else. I wasn’t able to attend some of the programs because I had night classes during the times, they had the events. ‘I also think having programs that teach athletes about finances could be helpful; specifically on financing things, insurance and buying a home. (Chance)\n\nImplementing mentorship programming was noted by the athletes with this quote by Kelly being a good representation of the athletes’ comments ‘I think having talks that help athletes learn how to speak about their skills and how to speak about that when interviewing for jobs.’ ‘I also think it would be great to bring back sport alumni and have them speak to current athletes about their careers.’ Additionally, it was also recommended that athletic departments speak to athletes about degrees and course choices that suit that athletes’ interests. Leah noted ‘I wish my academic advisor helped me more with what I could do with my degree after I graduated.’ ‘I feel like the focus was for me to get classes that worked around my practice schedule mostly.’\n\nHigh athletic identity\n\nWith years devoted to excelling within sport, many athletes find themselves identifying as an athletic individual even when their sport career ends (9). This finding was supported by the reflections from the participants in this study. Five out of six participants indicated they still identify as an athlete and considered themselves athletic. Chelsea noted, ‘I still try to live an athletic style similar to how I was when I was a competitive athlete’, while Chance noted ‘I still identify as a former athlete who still does athletic things.’ – and Leah said, ‘I still resemble as an athlete just because I’m still in shape and I’m still basically active.’ Of note, half of the participants in this study transitioned out of sport and into a career within or surrounding athletics. These participants openly discussed how this allowed them to stay identified within sport culture. For example, Kelly said ‘I now identify as a coach, which gives me sport identity; making it easier to take away the athlete part of me, but that identity is still very much part of who I am.’ Chelsea commented ‘I work within an athletic department and am still around sport every day. I enjoy that part of my job’ and Mary said,\n\nAfter college I became a graduate assistant for an athletic department and it’s nice to still being in the sports world because I am still constantly around athletics.’ ‘The best thing about being a college athlete is you definitely have like a foot up; I feel like in a lot of the career world.\n\nTwo participants discussed the transferability of the skills they learned as athletes, and how these gave them an advantage throughout the job search process. For example, Chance said ‘Just from my experience playing in college athletics, it helped me in terms of interviews and getting in the position to get a job.’ When asked what skills from sport helped him get his current position, he discussed leadership, communication, teamwork/collaboration, and confidence. He commented, ‘Leadership and communication; these were big for coming out of college athletes. I think it helped. As well as just like you get the confidence for like playing in front of people, so that helped with confidence and interviews and everything like that.’ ‘Being able to do team work as well; a lot of jobs like that as you obviously have to work in teams and collaborate with other people within your company.’\n\nLack of Psychological support\n\nAlthough the strength and exclusivity of the athletic role during sport participation may increase an athlete’s potential vulnerability to psychiatric distress after leaving sport (11), none of the participants reported experiencing athletic career transition programming that addressed the psychological effects that a transition can have on a sport individual. Although only one participant expressed experiencing mental health difficulties during her transition, five out of six participants spoke on the need for mental health to be addressed in athletic career transition programming. For example, Kelly noted,\n\n“I think having a mental health professional to provide tools and be real with athletes, like hey it is not going to be a smooth sailing process once you finally hang up the cleats, here are some tools to help you cope with this process better.”\n\nLeah on the other hand focused on the importance of wellness checks, ‘I do believe that for athletes who will transition, psychologists should come in and do a wellness check or just be an ear for somebody would be an amazing thing because college athletics is a mental trip.’\n\nCoping\n\nCoping strategies are used to help student athletes better adjust to sport retirement. Participants in this study reported that they coped with their transition out of sport by finding ways to get their mind off this process. Chelsea said, ‘I definitely did try to find ways to get my mind off of the fact that I’m not going to practice.’ Mary noted, ‘You try and find outlets you know, to still be competitive and find other ways to use your talents but it takes a little bit of time to find those things’ while Andrea stated, ‘I exercised to relieve the stress I had and that helped a lot.’ Although some of the participants found positive ways to cope with their transition, one participant utilized negative ways to cope with their transition. Leah said, ‘I was being real nonchalant. I was trying to like mask it with everything will work out fine, but I was panicking.’ During this time, she mentioned that she participated in drinking alcohol and smoking. She said, ‘another way that I coped truthfully during that time in all honesty; was drinking and smoking. I was like a spiral, like I did not know what to do.’ None of the participants indicated experiencing programming that spoke on positive ways to cope with transitioning out of athletics. By implementing this in programming, negative coping mechanisms during transitions can be prevented.\n\nSocial Support\n\nDuring athletic transitions, the participants utilized social support and informal information given to them about the transition process before and during their journey. It was found that the participants recalled receiving support from coaches, athletic advisors, family, and friends. Although the participants in the study did not receive as much support within their athletic departments, it was noted that they all utilized their social networks as support systems during their transitions. Andrea said, ‘I definitely needed some social support and I talked to my coach. He would hit me and just ask me if I was doing okay and stuff like that.’ Kelly stated, ‘I connected with my coaches a lot about the transition process as a player and my plans to pursue coaching as a career’ and ‘My coaches had a good grasp on what transitioning was like especially when they have played sport for so long.’ Kelly also noted the importance of friends and family, ‘My friends and family were also a good support system.’ The role of professors was also noted, ‘The professors I interacted with were very helpful to prepare me for what comes next, and I had an older sibling that played college sports, so I definitely relied on help from him.’\n\nCovid-19 Pandemic\n\nThe final theme that emerged from the data and affected two out of six participants in the year 2020 was the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic for the year 2020 ended college sports prematurely causing more athletes to experience a traumatic end to their athletic season and for some, a traumatic end to their athletic careers. The participants in this study who experienced this expressed not being supported by their athletic departments which increased their feelings of not being prepared for what was next for them. For example, Leah stated, ‘We were told that we weren’t going to get our season and that was it; our season was stripped away.’ When asked if there were any resources or emotional support provided for her, she said she could not recall any. She did reflect on being offered an extra season, which would grant her a fifth year of eligibility. She said she declined this opportunity in hopes of being able to put more time towards starting her career. Andrea, whose transition experience was also affected by the pandemic described her athletic career as ending suddenly, which took a toll on her mental health. She stated, ‘I never had anybody to talk to about how to move forward or continue on with the degree I earned.’ ‘I just remember thinking, what am I going to do next?’ ‘We never had a good closing statement.’ When asked if there were any resources or emotional support available to her, she recalled her athletic advisor reaching out to her via email and text message but decided to not respond due to feeling overwhelmed.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study examined athletic career transition programming within the NCAA through the perceptions of former student athletes. Additionally, the impact of an athletic career transition was further explored. The results from this study provide evidence that athletic departments may not be using best practices to better support student athletes in their transition out of collegiate athletics (2). From these findings, participants received little to no programming specific to how retiring from sport affects an individual psychologically, emotionally, behaviorally, and socially as well as how it affects their overall identity (5,7,8,9). The data further shows that athletic departments may not be listening to what the research says (5) should be implemented into programming; thus, demonstrating that athletic departments may not be prioritizing the overall well-being of student athletes. Past literature has continuously encouraged practitioners within athletic departments to include programming to provide student athletes the tools to adjust to sport retirement (4) and with the lack thereof, student athletes can potentially experience more negative reactions to retiring from collegiate sport (1,11,12).\n\nThe findings of this study were consistent with previous research with there still being a lack of consensus of what is told to student athletes about the transition process (2) shown throughout the perceptions of the former student athletes in this study. The themes (i.e., athletic career transition programming, athletic identity, psychological impact, and coping) from past research re-emerged when the participants were asked to reflect on their overall transition experience. Two additional themes that emerged were social support and the Covid-19 pandemic. Social support was not surprising as past literature has suggested it to be a positive coping mechanism for athletes in transition (7). However, the Covid-19 pandemic was a unique theme that has not often been discussed regarding athletic retirement. This provides a unique perspective to the overall findings. The perceptions of participants personal athletic transition experiences from collegiate sport were also consistent with previous literature in that most participants still resonated with the athletic role (athletic identity) (e.g., 9, 11,12), experienced mixed feelings about transitioning support and would have appreciated psychological support (8,12); utilizing positive and negative coping mechanisms and used social support networks that were available to them (7,8). With the difficulties and challenges of the unprecedented pandemic, this may have further exacerbated the lack of proper resources for student athletes transitioning from collegiate sport. This further provides evidence that proper exit strategies must be implemented within athletic departments for collegiate student athletes (5).\n\nLimitations & Future Research\n\nThere were limitations to this study that should be discussed. The findings were derived from a participant sample consisting primarily of women or individuals that competed within the Division I level. The lack of participants from other divisions did not allow for comparison across divisions. Furthermore, although interviewing only six participants led to the ability to give each participant a voice in this paper, it was a small sample making it impossible to make set inferences on this data alone. Instead, these results should be seen as an additional piece of information, along with past research findings, that can be used for best practice in career transition. With the structured interviews conducted primarily over zoom, this may have impacted the participants openness to disclose sensitive information due to the interview format. This was demonstrated by one participant disclosing confidential information related to their mental health after the interview process was completed, and the recording of the zoom appointment stopped. Future research should consider replicating this study with an in-person structured interview, with a more diverse and larger participant sample. Future studies should consider looking at the differences in athletic career transition programming implemented within all division levels of the NCAA qualitatively.\n\nConclusions Implications for Practice\n\nThe purpose of this present study was to investigate if current career transition programs in NCAA Athletic Departments are using best practices, as defined by the current research in the field, based on former collegiate athlete’s perceptions of their experience with career transition programming. A secondary and equally important purpose was to investigate the overall impact athletic career transition has on former collegiate athletes’ lives. The findings of this study provided evidence on the overall impact transitioning from collegiate sport has on an athletic individual and along with past research highlight the lack of athletic career transition programming implementation into athletic departments. These findings add to the evidence that suggests that professionals should be creating programs and psychoeducational interventions that include how the transition affects an athlete psychologically, socially, emotionally, behaviorally, and how it affects their overall athletic identity, per previous athletic career transition literature. Furthermore, professionals should implement psychological support for athletic career transitions from qualified staff, programming that gives student athletes tools on mental health resources, programming on positive coping mechanisms, programming to student athletes on financial topics (e.g., budgeting, financing, housing, taxes) and implementing mentorship programs that feature student athlete alumni. Additionally, these findings support the recommendation that practitioners should consider making programming accessible to all student athletes with various schedules by having programming for student athletes in person and virtually if possible. Lastly, practitioners within athletic departments should consider receiving feedback from former student athletes like this study, to ensure that the programming implemented is using best practices to better support student athletes. It is with hope that the findings of this study encourage practitioners within NCAA athletic departments to implement effective athletic career transition programming that will provide student athletes the tools to properly prepare for the transition out of collegiate athletics.\n\nReferences\n\nWeigand, S., Cohen, J., & Merenstein, D.

One uses visual, auditory, kinesthetic (touch), smell, and taste to create a picture simulating real world environments and scenarios. Imagery can be used to enhance various aspects of performance by mentally preparing someone for an upcoming competition or helping an athlete focus specifically on a task (19). Virtual reality, understood in this study as a first-person filmed, computer presented, immersive simulation of a real environment (32), has become increasingly more utilized in sport performance settings (7, 37, 44). Combing these two elements, the purpose of this study was to investigate an applied Imagery Assisted Virtual Reality (IAVR) intervention on imagery ability and pitch recognition in a sample of eleven National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division One softball players at a Midwestern University. This study’s results indicated a significant increase in global imagery ability as well as in four of the five functions of imagery (CS, CG, MG-A, MG-A) and in pitch type recognition. Practically, the results from this study suggest that the IAVR intervention can create an impactful experience to assist athletes in improving their performance and psychological skills.\n\nKeywords: Psychological Skills, Pitching Ability, Softball, Virtual Reality, Collegiate Sport\n\nVirtual reality technology has become an increasingly common tool used in sport (e.g., 3 – 4, 7, 14, 17, 24, 26; 28, 31, 37, 44) with application in areas such as injury rehabilitation (31), and performance enhancement (2, 27, Wood et al., 2020). In fact, virtual reality has been labeled the next step forward for athletic training (47) and has been the subject of several states of the field (e.g., 7, 26).\n\nVirtual reality was originally defined as a computer-generated, artificial, or simulated environment created by technological software (38). Within sport, it has been defined as instances when individuals are engaged in a sport that is represented in a computer-simulated environment which aims to induce a sense of being mentally or physically present and enables interactivity with the environment (28). One important aspect that virtual reality training is lacking is a focus on how virtual reality can assist in increasing an athlete’s psychological skill development (32). While virtual reality can impressively replicate environments and simulate real-world reactions; it still lacks the ability to capture an emotional response to the environment (32). As we know that how one feels and their perceptions of the sporting environment are necessary for performance, past research has shown this to be a challenge in traditional VR interventions (11) Research on the incorporation of imagery into a virtual reality training program has shown it to be a promising way to gain the advantages of VR and to overcome this potential challenge (32, 33; 34).\n\nIn the context of sport, White and Hardy (45) defined mental imagery as: an experience that mimics real experience. We can be aware of “seeing” an image, feeling movements as an image, or experiencing an image of smell, tastes, or sounds without actually experiencing the real thing (23). One approach to the application of imagery in sport is the revised applied model of imagery, which states that athletes may use it to achieve different outcomes (10). To achieve desired outcomes, imagery type, what athlete’s images and imagery function, the why or the purpose of an athlete’s image should be considered (29). Imagery type is split into two categories, cognitive and motivational, with each operating at specific and general levels (43). Cognitive refers to performance enhancement while motivational focuses on confidence enhancement (5). Imagery types and functions have been defined as: Cognitive specific (CS) helps an athlete to work on skill learning, development, and execution. Cognitive general (CG) affords the athlete the ability to image different strategies and routines. Motivational specific (MS) imagery focuses on enhancing motivation through goal setting and goal achievement. Motivational general arousal (MGA) imagery focuses on somatic and emotional experiences such as regulating stress and arousal. Motivational general mastery (MGM) imagery concentrates on coping, gaining, and maintaining self-confidence, and staying focused (10, 18) identify. Athletes might use each of the imagery types alone or in combination with one another, depending on the meaning an athlete applies to the image (29). For example, an athlete can use cognitive specific imagery (CS type) to image themselves executing a skill successfully (CS function), but this image may also increase their confidence, which would be for the function type MG-M (10).\n\nFocusing on the way in which Imagery and Virtual Reality could be used together, Ross-Stewart and colleagues developed Imagery Assisted Virtual Reality (IAVR), a training protocol that involves an immersive virtual reality experience for users in which kinesthetic awareness is incorporated with users being able to see a first-person simulated scenario coupled with an individualized imagery script aimed at enhancing psychological skills and performance (32). IAVR entailed a first-person filmed batting environment from an on-deck position all the way up to batting and taking swings. This video was then followed by a blank screen with an individualized guided imagery script tailored to each individual player that was either audio recorded in the video itself or written down. In their initial study they found that participants who completed an IAVR intervention increased their skills imagery (CS), goal imagery (MS) and mastery imagery (MG-M) as measured by the Sport Imagery Ability Questionnaire (SIAQ; 43). Furthermore, results suggested an increase in overall imagery use, positive self-talk and automaticity in both practice and competition through the length of the study. Additionally, negative thinking during competition decreased, as measured by the Test of Performance Strategies (TOPS; 39). The finding that imagery and virtual reality used together can impact psychological constructs was supported by Frank et al (2022) who found self-efficacy to increase in a physical activity task using imagery and virtual reality. Furthering the support for IAVR, a recent study on the impact of VR on imagery ability and emotional affect found that VR can “induce emotional arousal and affect the mental imagery skills and positive affect of athletes” (46).\n\nBaseball hall of famer Ted Williams referred to batting as “the hardest thing to do in sports” (35). If a softball pitcher throws a 60-mph fastball, it will reach Homeplate in .45 seconds. However, if she throws a changeup at 50 mph, it will reach Homeplate in .55 seconds. Batters have a brief window of opportunity in which they must recognize the pitch and decide to swing or not swing (20). Pitch recognition is the batter’s ability to recognize which way the seams on the ball are spinning/rotating and the trajectory of the ball (20). These two components can be categorized by pitch type (fastball, change-up, drop ball, rise ball) and prediction of eventual location of the pitch (strike, ball, inside, outside) (13). Being able to recognize pitches is an essential aspect of batting. However, there exists little agreement on what the skill of pitch recognition consists of and how to improve it (13).\n\nEach pitch is comprised of different combinations of velocity, rotation, and trajectory cues. Outside of rotation and trajectory cues, there are other sources of information a batter might be receiving information from without being aware of it. These cues include knowledge of the pitcher, game situation, and batter’s count (20). A batter’s ability to recognize which pitch is being thrown will allow them to conduct their swing accordingly and increase performance. This recognition will allow a batter to make more solid hits and recognize the difference between a ball and strike. This recognition will also allow them to either look for pitches they want to hit or draw more walks. Therefore, pitch recognition is a pivotal skill for softball players to obtain if they want to achieve top performance.\n\nThe use of VR has been shown to be an effective tool for the increase of strike zone and pitch recognition (16). Virtual reality training has also been shown to lead to a greater sensitivity to visual information provided by the ball trajectory, seam rotation, and improved ability to use monocular cues to determine whether a pitch would cross the plate in the strike zone or not (16). Furthermore, Ranganathan and Carlton (30) found that VR was effective when baseball players had visual information of an entire pitch in their VR environment and ball trajectory yielded a higher prediction accuracy.\n\nBased on both past research in VR and IAVR, merging imagery and virtual reality may enhance the psychological skill and strategy development of athletes more than if they are used alone. Taken with recent suggestions for more research on the effectiveness of VR on both skill acquisition and psychological change in sport (e.g., 7 17, 26, 28 31, 41), specifically, Cotterill’s assertion that “there is also a need for more applied case studies that outline the procedures adopted and reflect on the outcomes obtained using VR in sport psychology–relevant ways”(7, p.22). The purpose of this paper is to highlight an applied Imagery Assisted Virtual Reality intervention that was used with a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I softball team. Specifically, hitters were given the opportunity to participate in an intervention that designed individualized imagery assisted virtual reality video for them and then they were assessed to see how it impacted their imagery ability, and pitch recognition. Based on past research, it was hypothesized that both global imagery ability and pitch recognition would increase from baseline to post intervention. Furthermore, based on past research on IAVR (32) it was hypothesized that CS, CG, and MG-M imagery would significantly increase from baseline to post intervention. No hypothesis was made related to MS and MG-A imagery due to lack of past research, at the time of data collection, supporting the use of this imagery increasing using IAVR.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nMethods\n\nParticipants\n\nParticipants were 11 NCAA Division One female softball players at a Midwestern University. Of the 11 participants five were right-handed batters and six were left-handed batters. Their ages ranged from 18-24 years old.\n\nMeasures\n\nSport Imagery Ability Questionnaire (43; SIAQ): The SIAQ was designed to measure an athlete’s ability to image different content (i.e., strategies, skills, feelings, and goals) and the frequency that an athlete images. The questionnaire has 15 questions rated from 1 (very hard to image) to 7 (very easy to image). The questions are divided into five different subscales; skill imagery ability (e.g., defining a specific skill), strategy imagery ability (e.g., making/executing strategies), goal imagery ability (e.g., winning the game), affect imagery ability (e.g., positive emotions connected with the sport), and mastery imagery ability (e.g., positive outlook when things are not going well). An overall sport imagery ability score and all subscales were calculated separately. To score each of the five subscales, questions for the subscale were summed and divided by the number of questions for each source. The SIAQ has been found to have good validity and reliability (43)\n\nPitch recognition test: A Pitch Recognition test was designed for this study to assess a participant’s ability to recognize a pitch type (fastball. change-up, etc.) and pitch location (strike/ball). Participants viewed twelve pitches via GoPro film from a pitcher. The film the participants viewed was from the same film they viewed in their IAVR. There were five seconds between each pitch allowing for the participants to circle both the pitch type and pitch location of the previously viewed pitch. The pitch recognition test had twelve different pitches for the baseline testing and the post intervention testing. The number of pitches they correctly identified for both type and location divided by twelve was their total pitch recognition scores. Both pitch type and pitch location were scored as subscale.\n\nProcedure\n\nInstitution IRB was obtained. Players were recruited from an NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) Division I softball team. Eleven players signed up to participate in the intervention. Participants who gave consent were assigned a time to film their first-person VR film. Filming was done both on the players’ field and in their indoor hitting facility to make sure it properly mimicked where they were currently practicing. During filming, participants wore dual mounted GoPro headsets on top of their batting helmets to gain first person filming perspectives. Participants were instructed to go through their whole routine starting with preparation for the on-deck circle by stepping into the batter’s box. Filming was also done to gain a third person perspective using a dual mounted GoPro headset strapped to a tripod and placed in the batter’s box. For this film day, three pitchers from the same team, who volunteered to help with the study were filmed pitching from the mound (one left-handed, two right-handed). All three of the pitchers threw their pitches (fastball, change-up, rise ball, etc.) for both right-handed batter and left-handed batter viewpoints. Ninety-six pitches were filmed to allow for a variety of options for the pitching videos.\n\nAfter the filming was complete the research team used Shotcut to edit the film into two pitch recognition videos, and an individualized VR video for each participant. Videos of the pitches were made to assess pitch recognition at baseline and time 2. To make these videos, the third-person video was edited by clipping each pitcher’s pitch into its own. This allowed the researchers to integrate all three pitchers’ pitches into a specific order. Researchers then went through and selected twelve pitches out of the right-handed batter’s film and a separate twelve out of the left-handed batter’s film. These clips were arranged to simulate two full at bats, with a five second black screen between each pitch. This method was replicated to make the pitch recognition video that would be used for the post test.\n\nTo make the IAVR videos, first-person perspective film was edited to start when participants start their pre-at bat routine. The clip ended when the batter received a pitch from the pitcher while they were in the batter’s box. In these videos pitch clips were aligned to simulate a real world at bat, including timing between bats. To develop the guided imagery scripts that would be recorded as audio into the Virtual Reality videos, participants individually met with the research team to discuss their experiences at bat. The imagery scripts were written according to the guidelines suggested by (42) making sure to incorporate both stimulus and response propositions (8, 22) to the imagery scripts. The imagery scripts were broken down and recorded into two audio files. The first recording consisted of each participant’s rituals and routines starting when they are “in the hole” all the way to being in the batter’s box. This included getting equipment on (batting gloves, elbow guard, etc.), walking to the on-deck circle, on deck circle rituals, walking to the batter’s box, and pre at bat rituals. Some participants opted to have their walk-up song playing in the background during their imagery script when walking from the on-deck circle to the batter’s box.\n\nThe second recording started when each participant was in the batter’s box. Depending on how the participant wanted their imagery script written, they might receive a ball or strike first. Then, hitting to a designated spot of their choosing. Participants then had a choice of running through first, running to second, or sliding into second. The scenarios and cues they picked up from the first base coach were all individualized to each participant. These individual imagery scripts were turned into audio files and then embedded into the participants corresponding virtual reality film to make the Imagery Assisted Virtual Reality interventions for each participant. The IAVR was set up as the following: imagery script of preparation for an at bat, 3rd person pitch film, first person film from the dugout to the batter’s box, and then imagery script of hitting the ball and making it to a base safe.\n\nBefore being given their IAVR film, participants watched the baseline pitch recognition video and marked the pitch type and location of each video. Each player was provided with a pair of virtual reality goggles and a locked cell phone loaded with their individualized video. Instructions were also provided to participants on how to download the videos onto their personal phone if they preferred to have it on their own phone. Participants were instructed to watch their IAVR video at least once a day using virtual reality goggles. Participants were also informed that if they requested any changes to their IAVR (i.e., imagery speed, tone, pitch order) the research team would make the changes at any time during the intervention.\n\nAfter participants had the IAVR video for six weeks they completed a post intervention pitch recognition test where they watched the second pitching video that had been made and once again recorded what type and location, they believed they saw for each pitch. They also completed the SIAQ at this time.\n\nResults\n\nReview of the data indicated that two participants had missed one question each. The means for each question were used as a replacement so the participants data could still be used in the analysis, as deemed appropriate in inferential statistics (21). Next descriptive statistics for baseline and post intervention were calculated for each of the five imagery ability subscales and global imagery ability score, as well as total pitch recognition, pitch type and pitch location. Paired samples t-tests were run to assess mean changes from baseline to post intervention for all imagery ability subscales and total imagery score as well as for the three pitch assessments. As the data were expected to increase from baseline to post intervention across all variables a one tailed test was employed with an alpha level of 0.05. Cohens d were calculated for all pairs with 0.21 – 0.59 considered a small effect .60 – .79 a medium effect and 0.80 to 100 a large effect (6).\n\nImagery\n\nParticipants’ global imagery ability was higher at post-testing (m = 5.69, sd = 0.79) as opposed to baseline (m = 5.02, sd = 0.69), which was found to be a statistically significant difference, t(10) = -2.70, p = .01, d = 0.91). Skill imagery ability change from baseline to post intervention was also significant (t(10) = -2.51, p = 0.02, d = 0.73), indicating that the participants increased their skill imagery ability from baseline (m = 4.79, sd = 1.12) to post intervention (m = 5.63, sd = 1.20). Strategy imagery ability was found to have a statistically significant change (t(10) = -2.05, p = .03, d = 0.63). Means indicated an increase from 4.73 (sd =0.94) at baseline to 5.30 (sd =0.88) at post intervention. The affect imagery ability increase was statistically significant (t(10) = -2.07 p = 0.03, d = 0.81). Means indicated a change from 5.55 (sd = 0.83) at baseline to 6.22 at post intervention (sd = 0.79). Mastery imagery ability from baseline (m = 4.88, sd = 0.86) to post test (m = 5.60, sd = 0.79) was also statistically significant (t(10) = -2.05, p = 0.02, d = 0.88). Goal imagery did not have a statistically significant change from baseline (m = 5.15, sd = 1.02) to post intervention (m = 5.70, sd = 1.03, (p = 0.07, d = 0.53).\n\nPitch Statistics\n\nPitch type recognition was found to be statistically significant from baseline (m = 6.60, sd = 3.13) to post intervention (m = 9.10, sd = 2.08), t(10) = -2.28, p = .04) with a large effect size (d = 0.94). Pitch location recognition and total pitch recognition both increased, however neither were statistically significant changes (p >0.05). Percentage change was also recorded for pitch type as that is the common way to assess these statistics in applied softball scenarios. See Table 1 for full statistics for Pitch.\n\nTable 1. Average Number and percentage of pitches accurately identified at baseline and Post Intervention\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study investigated the effect of an applied Imagery Assisted Virtual Reality intervention on NCAA Division I softball players’ imagery ability and pitch recognition. This study hypothesized an increase in global imagery ability, pitch recognition as well as increases in skill (CS), strategy (CG), and Confidence (MG-M) imagery. Overall, the hypotheses were supported by the findings of this study.\n\nThis study’s results indicated a significant increase in the participants’ global imagery ability with this change indicating a large effect size. Furthermore, of the five imagery subscales all showed increases from baseline to post intervention, with Skill, Strategy, Mastery and Affect imagery ability increasing from baseline to post intervention. The increase in global imagery ability and subscale increases equates to the athlete’s ability to image being easier in real sport situations (49). This is of applied significance as this increase in global imagery could assist athletes in mental preparation before engaging in sport specific performance endeavors. It is also of importance as we have few studies demonstrating how to increase imagery ability even though we know the ability to image is important for athletes who want to use imagery to increase their sport performance. As imagery has been shown over and over again to increase sport performance (e.g., 9), knowing how to increase imagery ability is an important step in pursuit of maximizing the benefits of this psychological strategy.\n\nThis study demonstrates how virtual reality can assist a person’s imagery ability when showing real world video in correlation to their imagery script. We can postulate that global imagery ability increased in part due to the IAVR increasing the functional equivalency of the intervention (32). These results align with research on functional equivalence (22 and the PETTLEP model of imagery which states that all senses need to be engaged to be fully immersed in an imagery script (e.g., 1, 19; 36, 40).\n\nThe results indicated significant increases in confidence (MG-M) and affect (MG-A) imagery ability which equates to an athlete’s ability to image and be in control and cope during difficult sporting situations, and image positive content withing their sport (43). It may be that these motivational imagery subscales had a significant increase due to cue words (e.g., calm, focus, confidently) that were inserted into each participants imagery script to stimulate an emotional response. These cue words, chosen by each participant, were combined with repeated phrases such as “take a deep breath,” “feel yourself,” and “you are confident” were also used to stimulate an emotional response from participants. Some participants also opted to have their walk-up song play during their imagery assisted virtual reality. This auditory connection between virtual reality film and real-world stimulus may have allowed participants to emotionally connect to the IAVR and use it to regulate arousal. It should be noted that although it was not hypothesized that affect imagery (MG-A) would increase due to lack of research at the time of study, this finding is supported by recent research that has come out since data was collected for this study (46). The increase in MG-A imagery ability indicates that athletes experienced some type of realistic emotion within the imagery experience. This finding coincides with previous research (25, 27) that posits increases in affect imagery within virtual reality films may be attributed to social presence within these virtual reality films. Lee and colleagues (25) believed that responses to social presence within virtual environments may be due to the players’ expectations of interactions during an actual game. Within this study, social presence was maintained throughout virtual reality film by incorporating the presence of teammates in the videos. Finally, there were significant increases in skill (CS), and strategy (CG) imagery ability, which supported the hypothesis and is in line with past research (32). This makes sense as the IAVR gave the players extra opportunities to see themselves engaging in the skill of hitting and through imagery incorporated their individual strategies for how they were going to hit the ball.\n\nPitch Statistics\n\nThe hypothesis that pitch recognition would increase was partially supported. Pitch type recognition was found to be significantly increased from pre to post intervention. However, although pitch location recognition and total pitch recognition both increased, neither change was statistically significant. Percentage change was also recorded for pitch type as that is the common way to assess these statistics in applied softball scenarios and gave real world application information when it came to pitch recognition change. Of particular importance in this study was the finding that pitch type recognition increased by over 20% (from recognizing 6.6/12 – 9.1/12) from baseline to post intervention. Although not statistically significant the change in total pitch recognition increased by two pitches (4.1/12 to 5.9/12, 15%) which in an applied setting is a noteworthy performance increase. As the IAVR in this study was not filmed with 360-degree cameras it may be that this affected the batter’s sense of where the pitch was over the base, leading to a lack of pitch location increase. However, the IAVR focus on first person perspective of the pitch coming at them just as it would in a real game essentially gave them more reps “reading” the pitch where they did not have to think about anything else (what they were going to do), which may be part of why their pitch type recognition increased. These findings are important for those within the softball world as we know that recognizing a pitch can predict accuracy of an at bat (e.g., 30, 16). Although it is noted that pitch recognition is an essential aspect to batting, there is little agreement on how to improve it (13). This study’s results demonstrate the effectiveness of IAVR on increasing pitch type recognition and could therefore be a low-cost tool used by teams to increase the skill of pitch recognition, and therefore batting percentages.\n\nWhile this study is an important addition to the new area of Imagery Assisted Virtual Reality, there are limitations to consider. The first limitation of this study was the sample size. Although the small sample size is acknowledged as a limitation it should be noted that even with this small sample size, the effect sizes in this study were medium to high indicating that with a larger sample these findings may be even more pronounced. As this was an applied study using players who were in season, it was considered unethical to make some of them a control group. Specifically, having some players given an advantage over others, an advantage that is not shown to disappear over time, would be unfair to those in the control group, impacting both individual athletes and the team as a whole. Therefore, not having a control group, although a deliberate decision, does lead to the lack of knowledge as to whether another unexpected variable may have impacted these results.\n\nAs IAVR is a new strategy for increasing imagery ability and sport performance, there are several areas future researchers should consider. Current research on IAVR has focused on the effect of IAVR on imagery ability it may be useful to focus on imagery use (facilitative and debilitative) as the ability to image is of importance only in that it effects imagery use effectiveness (12). Therefore, future research should focus specifically on the effect of IAVR on amount of deliberate imagery use both during and after they complete the IAVR protocol. To that point, future applied research on IAVR would benefit from tracking season performance post intervention, or by athletes who use IAVR throughout a season. Additionally, the impact of IAVR on pitch recognition during in game would be a worthy pursuit. At this time, we do not know what the optimal length of an IAVR protocol would be for athlete imagery, psychological skill, or athletic performance. All these areas are ripe for future research to investigate.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, the results of this study further support the value of an Imagery Assisted Virtual Reality protocol being used in sport. Specifically, this study showed that IAVR can increase performance statistics (pitch recognition) and imagery ability.\n\nApplications in Sport\n\nThese findings have practical significance as they lend support for IAVR to be used by softball players to further both their in-game skills and psychological skills development. Furthermore, these findings add to the existing literature that indicates IAVR may be a cost effective and impactful tool for athletes in various sports.\n\nReferences\n\nAnuar, N., Cumming, J., & Williams, S.

The NCAA rules/guidelines for incorporating volunteer coaches into various sports range from the previously specific, but no longer allowed, (Division I, particularly football and basketball) to the more general (Division II and III). Using the emerging NCAA sport of women’s triathlon as the case study, this project asked the coaches of the 40 institutions presently sponsoring women’s intercollegiate triathlon about their perceptions regarding volunteer coaches.\n\nMethods: A qualitative interpretive research approach was used to allow each respondent to make sense of their individual situation. A web based open-ended questionnaire was sent to all NCAA women’s triathlon head coaches and paid assistants and selected coaches were also interviewed (representing all three NCAA divisions).\n\nResults: Twelve (30%) coaches responded to the survey. Results indicated that four main themes were derived from the data: gratitude, caution, acceptance, and personal traits.\n\nConclusions: The perceptions of existing NCAA coaches regarding volunteer coaches may become a gateway or a barrier. A volunteer coach might complement the head coach and fill in the gaps in other areas such as sport specific expertise, fundraising, and social functions. Implications of the study include that volunteering can serve as the apprenticeship before becoming a paid coach.\n\nApplication in Sport: USA Triathlon, as the National Governing Body for the sport, has a personal stake in creating highly trained, experienced, and specialized draft legal coaches for its juniors, developmental and Olympic programs. The NCAA emerging sport of women’s draft legal triathlon is one way in which to accomplish these goals.\n\nKeywords: sport coach, college sport, National Governing Body, emerging sport\n\n“There is nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer.”\n\nJimmy Doolittle\n\nIn January 2014, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) approved women’s triathlon as an emerging sport (36). An emerging sport must reach 40 institutions before the NCAA recognizes the sport (and then provides funding for national championships) (14). In 2022, USA Triathlon, as the National Governing Body (NGB) of the sport, reported that 40 schools had adopted women’s triathlon and that the process for full NCAA recognition could begin (T. Yount, personal communication, 8 February 2023). USA Triathlon (USAT) is the driving force behind this initiative (both politically and financially) (36). USA Triathlon has an organizational stake in this because it needs to identify triathletes who can compete on an international level and eventually contend in the Olympic Games as well as developing future high performance coaches. USAT also offers a coaching education and certification program.\n\nUnder the USA sports system, colleges and universities are often the training grounds for Olympic athletes (7). Prior to the 2014 initiative by USAT, this training ground did not exist. USAT also wanted to develop the international style of racing domestically. At the Olympic level, triathlons are draft legal, meaning during the cycle portion of the triathlon competitors are allowed to ride behind one another just like bicycle racing. This is different from a traditional non-drafting event where cyclists must be separated from one another by several meters. The NCAA draft legal format is a 750-meter swim, followed by a 20-kilometer bike and ending with a 5-kilometer run, which is the sprint distance under World Triathlon rules (59). World Triathlon is the International Federation for the sport of triathlon.\n\nAs the USA had been slow in the adoption of the draft legal format for competitors compared to other countries (38), it also is behind much of the world with triathlon coaches who have draft legal experience. So much so, that USA Triathlon started recruiting interested existing coaches in 2014 to specialize in this format of racing (55). Additionally, the NGB also is developing a mentorship program for college coaches (56). Head coaches may have come from a swimming or running background, have Ironman™ coaching certifications and/or have experience of their own as age group triathletes. Furthermore, college and university athletic departments might only want to pay for a head coach to keep overhead down until full recognition by the NCAA is obtained. Enter the volunteer coach. Volunteer coaches may allow for simple division of labor and tap into expertise or particular skill sets. They may be able to manage administrative duties such as scheduling, team uniforms and/or trouble shooting. Volunteer coaches may allow head coaches to “fill in the gaps” in terms of content expertise (i.e., swim, bike, run, organization, fundraising) as the sport works towards full NCAA recognition as well as operating under the present rules of that organization (33-35).\n\nIn November of 2021, USAT presented to the Collegiate Triathlon Coaches Association the “current state of the sport.” At that time, 70% of the institutions sponsoring women’s triathlon used at least one volunteer coach in 2021 (62). A further breakdown showed 50% of volunteer coaches assisted with the swim, 57% assisted with the bike and 47% assisted with the run. “Indicating that some volunteers help with more than one sport” (62). USAT also found that volunteer coaches also assisted “with race management, transportation, bike maintenance, physical therapy and recruiting” (62). This information provided a starting point for the project. Thus, the research question is: what are the perceptions of head coaches as to the purpose and role of volunteer coaches in the emerging NCAA sport of women’s triathlon?\n\nCollege sports in the USA has long used the apprenticeship-approach to training and educating future coaches. If not a student-athlete, one becomes a manager or intern as an undergraduate, then becomes a graduate assistant, then an assistant coach and, finally, a head coach. Since triathlon is new and classified as an emerging sport, this traditional pathway does not yet formally exist. While it is a time-honored tradition to use playing experience at the beginning of a coaching career rather than specific education pertinent to coaching in general and sport specific (44), draft legal experience for existing triathlon coaches in the USA is still rare. Triathlon is not a high school sport and does not have as structured and formalized club system as USA Swimming or USA Gymnastics. The incorporation of volunteer coaches, particularly those with draft legal experience, might be one way to increase the pool of knowledgeable coaches that then possibly become available to new NCAA programs. Head coaches can be “instrumental in the career development of their head assistant coach, indirectly preparing them for future head coaching positions” (40, p. 11). Volunteering could become the apprenticeship and help train future coaches. Until more student-athletes graduate from the sport, and move into coaching through those traditional pathways, volunteer coaches may be an untapped resource.\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\nBefore proceeding, it is important to provide operational definitions of the terms volunteer and perceptions. These definitions are the operational “guardrails” for the study. Volunteers are people, who for a variety of motives, decide to donate their time and, often, their money to a particular group or cause (39). Perception is the “process of integrating, organizing, and interpreting sensations” (26, p. 80) and “…the way you think about or understand someone or something” (51).\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (53), about 62.6 million people volunteered between September of 2014 and September of 2015. These same statistics showed the more education one has, the more likely that person is to volunteer. Other statistics included those volunteers provided a median of 52 hours annually and those men and women volunteered at near the same rate (52 hours vs. 50 hours, respectively). Volunteers were “most likely to volunteer for religious organizations, followed by education or youth service organizations,” and those individuals who possessed a bachelor’s degree or higher “were more likely to provide professional or management assistance or to tutor or teach than volunteers with less education” (53). Volunteers can provide an economic benefit for nonprofit organizations (4) by taking on “staff-like roles to control costs” (24, p. 201). Volunteer sports coaches through their social interactions and engagement could become “community assets” (23, p. 322).\n\nWithin the academic literature, the topic of volunteering, in general, regarding motivation, meaning, sense of community, and perceptions have been significantly studied (10, 42, 43, 49, 58). Youth sports have also been extensively study: from training (15, 22, 45), education (28), motivation (3), behavior (18, 27, 31), relationships/wellbeing (25, 46, 52) and efficacy (6, 8, 16, 50). Organizations such as the National Alliance of Youth Sports, Positive Coaching Alliance, Good Sports and TrueSport focus on youth sports, youth coaches, and parents. To coach under the auspices of the US National Governing Body system, a coaching certification program is required to include SafeSport certification (54). However, for any coach at the college/university level, there may be no certification requirements. While focusing on career and job coaching, Schimdt-Lellek and Fietze (47) could just as well have been discussing intercollegiate sport coaches as “coaching…is not protected by state laws; there is no state license and no public mandate and thus no defined monopoly for this professional activity” (p.746). Thus, there is no formal governance structure mandating certain education requirements or certifications to become a college coach.\n\nFinally, research focused on assistant coaches is also scarce and not systematic in nature (19, 20). Rathwell et al. (40) looked at the perceptions Canadian university head football coaches had when hiring assistant coaches. Their findings showed that head coaches hired “loyal assistants who possessed extensive football knowledge that complimented their own skill sets” (p. 5). Additionally, they also discovered that head coaches looked at the experience an assistant coach had both as an athlete and as an assistant coach. These head coaches also wanted assistant coaches who “cared about their athletes’ personal growth and development” (p. 12). This finding echoes previous research regarding university head coaches (5, 12, 57).\n\nMETHOD\n\nThis project is a basic interpretative qualitative study (32) in that the researcher is “interested in understanding how participants make meaning of a situation or phenomenon, this meaning is mediated through the researcher as instrument, the strategy is inductive, and the outcome is descriptive” (p. 6). The project is designed to “hear the voices of the people, analyse the themes and present a thoughtful overview of the results…[it] describes and interprets, but has no theoretical underpinnings” (48, p. 5). It is also interpretive in nature because it is:\n\nshaped by human experiences and social contexts (ontology), and is therefore best studied within its socio-historic context by reconciling the subjective interpretations of its various participants (epistemology). Because interpretive researchers view social reality as being embedded within and impossible to abstract from their social settings, they “interpret” the reality though a “sense-making” process rather than a hypothesis testing process. (41) This differs from a traditional positivist approach where theories are evaluated and verified, incorporating closed-ended questions using pre-determined approaches and involving some sort of statistical analysis (1).\n\nUsing a case study format allows for “an empirical method that investigates a contemporary phenomenon (the ‘case’) in depth and within its real-life context” (61, p. 15). A case study is a research technique “used in sport management to examine (e.g., observe, explore) certain factors of a sport industry subject (e.g., event, person, group, company, organization, system) for a certain time period” (1, p. 139). Simply put, the technique allows for a detailed analysis of a specific activity, situation, or practice (1). The case is NCAA women’s triathlon coaches’ perceptions of the purpose of volunteer coaches.\n\nUSA Triathlon has a list on its website of all the NCAA schools presently competing in women’s triathlon as an emerging sport. Each of those institutions has an athletic department website that has triathlon information available in the public doma"
