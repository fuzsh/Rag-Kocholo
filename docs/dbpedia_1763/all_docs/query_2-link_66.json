        "text": "Common Core State Standards - Effective July 7, 2010, the Connecticut State Board of Education adopted the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in English language arts and mathematics (Common Core State Standards). These standards establish what Connecticutâ€™s students should know and be able to do as they progress through Grades K-12.\n\nThere are documents available intended to assist districts in CCSS-based curriculum revision and development are available. In 2013, Connecticut renamed the CCSS as the Connecticut Core Standards (CCS). The CCS is the CCSS in its entirety with no changes.\n\nCT Mathematics Unit Planning Organizers are designed to be a resource for developers of curriculum. The documents feature standards organized in units with key concepts and skills identified, and a suggested pacing guide for the unit. The standards for Mathematical Practice are an integral component of CT Standards (CCSS) and are evident highlighted accordingly in the units.\n\nThe information in the unit planning organizers can easily be placed into the curriculum model in used at the local level during the revision process. It is expected that local and/or regional curriculum development teams determine the \"Big Ideas\" and accompanying \"Essential Questions\" as they complete the units with critical vocabulary, suggested instructional strategies, activities and resources."
