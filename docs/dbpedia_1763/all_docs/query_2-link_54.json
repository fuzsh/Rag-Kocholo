During his previous 17 seasons at the helm, Heefner has guided the DBU Baseball program to the NCAA postseason 13 times, including 12 of the last 13 years. The Patriots are also one of just five teams in college baseball to reach the NCAA Regionals each of the past 10 years.\n\nHeefner has been a four-time Conference Coach of the Year during his career, garnering the Keith LeClair Conference USA Coach of the Year in 2022 and 2023 and the Missouri Valley Conference Dan Callahan Coach of the Year in 2016 and 2021. Heefner is also a two-time American Baseball Coaches Association Midwest Region Coach of the Year (2008 & 2011).\n\nIn 17 seasons at DBU, Heefner owns a career record of 652-326-1, and his .667 win percentage ranks as the eighth-highest in the nation among active NCAA Division I coaches. Dating back to the 2015 season when the Patriots hosted the Dallas Regional, Heefner has guided DBU to 396 wins, which ranks as the ninth-highest win total among the nation’s 305 NCAA Division I baseball programs.\n\nTOP 10 PROGRAMS BY WINS SINCE 2015\n\n1. Florida (425)\n\n2. LSU (416)\n\n3. Vanderbilt (405)\n\n4. Arkansas (399)\n\n4. Southern Miss (399)\n\n6. Texas A&M (398)\n\n7. East Carolina (397)\n\n7. Oregon State (397)\n\n9. DBU (396)\n\n10. Louisville (392)\n\nIn the postseason, Heefner has led DBU to a pair of trips to the Super Regionals. In 2021, the Patriots won the Fort Worth Regional to advance to the Columbia Super Regional. Ten years prior, in 2011, DBU clinched the Fort Worth Regional to punch their ticket to the Santa Clara Super Regional. The Patriots have also reached the regional finals in seven of the last nine years, dating back to 2015 when DBU hosted the Dallas Regional.\n\nPlayer development has been a hallmark of Dan Heefner’s coaching career. During his tenure as the head coach at DBU, Heefner has produced 24 All-Americans, a mark that ranks as the eighth-highest total in college baseball dating back to 2009, as well as 16 Freshman All-Americans since 2008. Heefner has also coached 73 players selected in the Major League Baseball Draft, including 10 that have reached the Big Leagues. Since 2015, the Patriots’ 49 draft picks rank as the ninth-most selections from any program in the nation.\n\nYEAR-BY-YEAR\n\nThe Patriots are coming off a 2024 season in which they won the Conference USA Tournament and advanced as the No. 2 seed to the Tucson Regional. DBU stormed out of the gates to their best start in the program’s Division I era by winning their first nine games and improved to 11-1 after defeating No. 15 Alabama in 12 innings to win the Frisco College Classic. DBU eventually earned its highest ranking in school history, reaching as high as No. 7 on March 25, and was a consensus top 10 team in all five major college baseball polls on the week of April 1. DBU finished the season with a 45-15 record, posting their third-highest win total in program history.\n\nThe 2023 season saw DBU win the Conference USA regular season title in their first year in the league and earn the No. 2 seed at the Stillwater Regional, where they would reach their seventh regional final in the last eight years. The Patriots joined the likes of Florida, LSU, Oklahoma State, and Vanderbilt as one of only five teams in the nation to reach the NCAA postseason each of the last nine years. During the 2023 season, the Patriots set a school record for most consecutive wins, winning 14 straight games from April 1-22.\n\nIn 2022, DBU reached the NCAA Tournament as the No. 3 seed at the Austin Regional. The Patriots capped off their season with a 34-24-1 record and fell six wins shy of posting their eighth consecutive 40-win season.\n\n2021 will be remembered as one of the all-time great seasons in program history as DBU won three championships and reached the Columbia Super Regionals, where they faced Virginia. The Patriots’ three titles included the Missouri Valley Conference regular-season and tournament titles before winning the Fort Worth Regional over a field that included the No. 6 national seed TCU, a three-time national champion in Oregon State, and McNeese State. DBU finished with a 41-18 record, making them the only team in college baseball to have seven consecutive 40-win seasons. The Patriots also earned their highest end-of-season ranking when all five national polls tabbed DBU at No. 14.\n\nIn 2020, the Patriots posted a 12-4 record before college baseball witnessed the cancellation of the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 2020 season, DBU was ranked in the Top 25 all five weeks, winning all four of their weekend series, including a key series win on the road at then-ranked No. 13 North Carolina.\n\nPrior to the 2020 season, the Patriots were coming off their sixth consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament after earning an at-large bid to the postseason in 2019. As the No. 2 seed at the Lubbock Regional, DBU advanced to the regional finals for the fifth consecutive year, where they eventually fell to then-ranked No. 6 Texas Tech, capping off the 2019 season with a 43-20 record. At season’s end, the Patriots were ranked No. 24 in the nation by D1Baseball.\n\nThe 2018 season saw the Patriots reach the postseason as the No. 3 seed at the Fayetteville Regional. After a first-round loss to Southern Miss, DBU bounced back with victories over Oral Roberts and Southern Miss before falling to then-ranked No. 4 Arkansas, 4-3, capping off their 2018 campaign with a 42-21 record.\n\nIn 2017, DBU won the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament to earn the league's automatic bid. It marked the third time since DBU joined The Valley in 2014, in which the Patriots clinched the MVC Tournament title. DBU advanced to the Fort Worth Regional as the No. 3 seed and reached the regional finals for the third straight year. The Patriots finished 2017 with a 42-21 record and won 22 of their final 26 games leading up to the NCAA postseason, which was the second-best record in the nation over that span. Following the 2017 season, DBU was ranked No. 20 in the nation by Collegiate Baseball, marking the third straight year that the Patriots finished the season nationally ranked.\n\nIn 2016, DBU won both the Missouri Valley Conference regular-season and tournament titles and advanced to the Lubbock Regional as the No. 2 seed. The Patriots finished the 2016 season with a 44-19 record, reaching the regional final for the fourth time in the last six years and finishing just two wins shy of matching a school record for the most victories in a single season. Following their 2016 campaign, DBU was tabbed No. 24 in the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association and Collegiate Baseball polls.\n\nHeefner guided the Patriots to a historic season in 2015, as DBU won a school-record 46 games and hosted the program’s first-ever NCAA Regional Tournament. The Patriots also held the No. 1 RPI in the nation for eight of the last nine weeks of the regular season and finished the year ranked No. 15 in the country by Perfect Game, a mark that ranks as the highest end-of-season ranking in school history.\n\nIn 2014, DBU competed in its inaugural season as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference. Heefner’s club burst onto the scene by winning the MVC Tournament in Terre Haute, Indiana, and received an automatic bid to the NCAA Regional Tournament. The Patriots earned the No. 2 seed at the Fort Worth Regional and finished the season with a 40-21 record, making it the third time in the past four years in which DBU reached 40 wins.\n\nHeefner and the Patriots made their second consecutive trip to the postseason in 2012, as DBU earned a trip to the Waco Regional. The Patriots advanced to the Regional Championship game for the second straight year and finished the year with a 41-19 record.\n\nIn 2011, Heefner guided the Patriots to even more national recognition, winning the NCAA Fort Worth Regional in a field that included TCU, Oklahoma, and Oral Roberts. Heefner was again named the ABCA Midwest Region Coach of the Year as his team competed in the Santa Clara Super Regional against the University of California-Berkley. The Patriots finished the year with a 42-20 record, marking the 33rd consecutive winning season for the program, and finished as high as No. 16 in the nation at season’s end by Collegiate Baseball. DBU’s high-powered offense in 2011 ranked in the Top 25 nationally in several different categories, and Jason Krizan set a new NCAA record for doubles in a season.\n\nHeefner took little time to make his mark at DBU after being named the sixth head coach in Dallas Baptist University history in July 2007. In his first year at the helm, Heefner led the Patriots to several historic milestones. In 2008, DBU earned its first-ever NCAA Tournament appearance by receiving a No. 2 seed in the College Station Regional after finishing the regular season with the 29th-best RPI in the nation.\n\nDBU’s at-large bid marked the first time since 1992 that an NCAA Division I Independent team, other than Miami, made the NCAA Tournament and earned Heefner the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Midwest Region Coach of the Year Award. Heefner was also named the Independent Coach of the Year, which he received again following the 2009 season. In 2009, the Patriots went 38-17 and finished the regular season with the 36th best RPI in the nation.\n\nDBU’S SEASON RECORDS UNDER HEEFNER\n\n2008: 37-19 (College Station Regional)\n\n2009: 38-17\n\n2010: 28-27\n\n2011: 42-20 (Santa Clara Super Regional)\n\n2012: 41-19 (Waco Regional Finals)\n\n2013: 30-30\n\n2014: 40-21 (Fort Worth Regional)\n\n2015: 46-15 (Dallas Regional Finals)\n\n2016: 44-19 (Lubbock Regional Finals)\n\n2017: 42-21 (Fort Worth Regional Finals)\n\n2018: 42-21 (Fayetteville Regional Finals)\n\n2019: 43-20 (Lubbock Regional Finals)\n\n2020: 12-4 *Season canceled due to COVID-19\n\n2021: 41-18 (Columbia Super Regional)\n\n2022: 34-24-1 (Austin Regional)\n\n2023: 47-16 (Stillwater Regional Finals)\n\n2024: 45-15 (Tucson Regional)\n\nTOTAL: 652-326-1 (.667)\n\nCONFERENCE TITLES UNDER HEEFNER\n\n2014: MVC Tournament\n\n2016: MVC Regular-Season\n\n2016: MVC Tournament\n\n2017: MVC Tournament\n\n2019: MVC Regular-Season\n\n2021: MVC Regular-Season\n\n2021: MVC Tournament\n\n2023: CUSA Regular-Season\n\n2024: CUSA Tournament\n\nDuring Heefner’s 17 seasons as head coach at DBU, the Patriots have seen numerous players receive individual awards for their success on and off the field. Since 2008, DBU has produced 24 All-Americans, 16 Freshman All-Americans, and three Academic All-Americans, including the 2018 Academic All-America Player of the Year in Devlin Granberg.\n\nDating back to the 2013 season when DBU transitioned from an Independent to the Western Athletic Conference, Heefner has coached 106 All-Conference selections. DBU has also shined in the classroom under Heefner’s leadership as 31 Patriots have been named First Team All-MVC Scholar Athletes and DBU has been awarded the CUSA Sport Academic Award in 2023 and 2024.\n\nCONFERENCE PLAYER OF THE YEAR AWARDS DURING HEEFNER’S TENURE\n\nPLAYER OF THE YEAR:\n\n2016 - Darick Hall (MVC)\n\n2018 - Devlin Granberg (MVC)\n\n2021 - Jackson Glenn (MVC)\n\nPITCHER OF THE YEAR:\n\n2016 - Colin Poche (MVC)\n\n2018 - Trevor Conn (MVC)\n\n2024 - Ryan Johnson (CUSA)\n\nDEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR:\n\n2017 - Camden Duzenack (MVC)\n\n2018 - Jimmy Glowenke (MVC)\n\n2023 - Nathan Humphreys (CUSA)\n\nFRESHMAN OF THE YEAR:\n\n2016 - Jameson Hannah (MVC)\n\n2018 - Jimmy Glowenke (MVC)\n\n2022 - Luke Heefner (MVC)\n\n2023 - Grant Jay (CUSA)\n\n2024 - Luke Pettitte (CUSA)\n\nNEWCOMER OF THE YEAR:\n\n2016 - Darick Hall (MVC)\n\n2018 - Kody Funderburk (MVC)\n\n2023 - Ethan Mann (CUSA)\n\n2024 - Michael Dattalo (CUSA)\n\nDBU IN THE DRAFT UNDER HEEFNER\n\nDeveloping players to advance their careers to the professional ranks has become a staple of the DBU Baseball program under Heefner's guidance. During Heefner’s 17-year career as the head coach at DBU, 73 players have been selected in the Major League Draft, including 27 taken in the top 10 rounds. Dating back to the 2015 MLB Draft, DBU's 49 draft selections are the ninth-highest total in college baseball. Since Heefner arrived at DBU as an assistant coach in 2005, 89 players have pursued professional baseball careers.\n\nThe DBU Baseball program set a school record in 2023 when eight players were selected in the Major League Draft. The Patriots eight draft picks were also tied for the fourth-most selections from any college program in the country. Three pitchers were taken in the top 10 rounds, including Braxton Bragg in the eighth round by the Baltimore Orioles, followed by Kyle Amendt and Zane Russell going to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the ninth and 10th rounds, respectively. The Atlanta Braves nabbed Jace Grady in the 11th round before Bryson Hammer went to the Colorado Rockies, and Brady Rose was taken by the New York in the 12th round. Nate Rombach was an 18th-round selection by the Washington Nationals, and 10 picks later; Alec Baker became the eighth Patriot to go in the draft when the Diamondbacks chose him in the 18th round.\n\nIn 2022, three players from DBU were selected in the MLB Draft, led by right-handed pitcher Jacob Meador, whose name was called in the 12th round by the Los Angeles Dodgers. One round later, fellow righty Chandler Arnold was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals. Utility player Ryan Wrobleski rounded out the Patriots’ draft selections when he was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 20th round.\n\nThe 2021 MLB Draft saw five Patriots selected, including a pair in the top 10 rounds: Dominic Hamel went to the New York Mets in the third round, and Jackson Glenn was chosen by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the fifth round. DBU’s five draft picks ranked as the sixth-highest total in the nation.\n\nIn 2020, DBU was one of only nine programs in the nation with two or more players selected in the first two rounds of the Major League Draft, and Burl Carraway and Jimmy Glowenke were each selected in the second round. Carraway became the third-highest draft pick in school history when the Chicago Cubs selected him with the 51st overall pick, while Glowenke matched Jake Johansen as the program’s fourth-highest pick after going 68th overall to the San Francisco Giants.\n\nFollowing the 2019 season, six Patriots were taken in the MLB Draft. A pair of senior pitchers were the top two picks from DBU: MD Johnson went to the Miami Marlins in the sixth round, and Jordan Martinson was taken by the New York Mets in the 11th round.\n\nIn 2018, seven players were selected from DBU in the draft, a total that ranked as the sixth-most draft picks from one school among the 297 NCAA Division I programs in the nation. Headlining the 2018 draft class for DBU was junior outfielder Jameson Hannah, who became the program's second-highest draft pick when he went in the second round with the 50th overall pick to the Oakland Athletics. Following Hannah was the 2018 Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year, Devlin Granberg, who the Boston Red Sox selected in the sixth round. Rounding out the Patriots' third pick in the top 10 rounds was senior catcher Matt Duce, a ninth-round pick of the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThe Patriots saw six players drafted in 2017, ranked as the fifth-most selection in college baseball. All six players that were selected in the 2017 MLB Draft were taken in the first 17 rounds, highlighted by Seth Elledge, who the Seattle Mariners picked in the fourth round. The New York Yankees took Dalton Higgins in the seventh round, while the Arizona Diamondbacks selected Camden Duzenack in round nine. The program’s all-time home run leader, Austin Listi, was taken in the 17th round by the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nIn 2016, five players from DBU were selected in the Major League Draft, headlined by junior outfielder David Martinelli, a sixth-round selection of the Philadelphia Phillies. Both Darick Hall and Colin Poche were selected in the 14th rounds, as Hall was taken by the Phillies, and Poche went to the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nIn 2015, DBU saw seven players selected in the MLB Draft, matching the previous high set in 2006. Drew Smith was the highest draft selection from DBU in 2015, as the Detroit Tigers took the junior right-hand pitcher in the third round. With the selection of Smith in round three, DBU became the only school from the state of Texas and one of only nine programs in the nation to have a player taken in the top three rounds from 2013-2015. Joining Smith on that elite list of players from DBU taken in the first three rounds are Cy Sneed, a third round selection of the Milwaukee Brewers in 2014, and Jake Johansen, who went in the second round to the Washington Nationals in 2013.\n\nIn total, DBU saw five junior pitchers taken in the first 12 rounds of the 2015 Major League Draft, including Drew Smith (3rd round - Detroit Tigers), Brandon Koch (4th round - Tampa Bay Rays), Chance Adams (5th round - New York Yankees), Cory Taylor (8th round - San Francisco Giants), and Joseph Shaw (12th round - New York Mets), making it the first time in school history in which five pitchers have been selected from a single draft class.\n\nAlso selected in the 2015 draft class were two position players, catcher Daniel Salters, and second baseman Drew Turbin. Salters, who was one of 20 finalists in 2015 for the Johnny Bench Award, given to the nation's top catcher, went in the 13th round to the Cleveland Indians. It marked the second consecutive year in which Salters' name had been called in the draft, as he was a 22nd-round selection of the Washington Nationals in 2014. Turbin on the other hand, who was a First Team All-Missouri Valley Conference selection in 2015 and ranked No. 21 in the nation in on-base percentage, went in the 14th round to the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nIn 2013, DBU saw six players selected in the draft, the most from any school in the state of Texas. Three Patriots also made their Major League debuts in 2013, including Brandon Bantz (Seattle Mariners), Vic Black (Pittsburgh Pirates), and Ryan Goins (Toronto Blue Jays). All three players were selected out of DBU in the 2009 Major League Draft.\n\nIn 2009, Vic Black became the highest draft pick in school history when the Pittsburgh Pirates selected him in the first round with the 49th overall pick. Black would make his Major League debut just four years later.\n\n27 TOP 10 ROUND PICKS IN MLB DRAFT UNDER HEEFNER\n\n1st: Victor Black (2009 - Pittsburgh Pirates)\n\n2nd: Burl Carraway (2021 - Chicago Cubs)\n\n2nd: Jimmy Glowenke (2021 - San Francisco Giants)\n\n2nd: Jameson Hannah (2018 - Oakland Athletics)\n\n2nd: Jake Johansen (2013 - Washington Nationals)\n\n3rd: Dominic Hamel (2021 - New York Mets)\n\n3rd: Drew Smith (2015 - Detroit Tigers)\n\n3rd: Cy Sneed (2014 - Milwaukee Brewers)\n\n4th: Seth Elledge (2017 - Seattle Mariners)\n\n4th: Brandon Koch (2015 - Tampa Bay Rays)\n\n4th: Ryan Goins (2009 - Toronto Blue Jays)\n\n5th: Jackson Glenn (2021 - Pittsburgh Pirates)\n\n5th: Chance Adams (2015 - New York Yankees)\n\n6th: MD Johnson (2019 - Miami Marlins)\n\n6th: Devlin Granberg (2018 - Boston Red Sox)\n\n6th: David Martinelli (2016 - Philadelphia Phillies)\n\n7th: Dalton Higgins (2017 - New York Yankees)\n\n8th: Braxton Bragg (2023 - Baltimore Orioles)\n\n8th: Cory Taylor (2015 - San Francisco Giants)\n\n8th: Jason Krizan (2011 - San Francisco Giants)\n\n9th: Kyle Amendt (2023 - Arizona Diamonbacks)\n\n9th: Matt Duce (2018 - St. Louis Cardinals)\n\n9th: Camden Duzenack (2017 - Arizona Diamondbacks)\n\n10th: Zane Russell (2023 - Arizona Diamondbacks)\n\n10th: Paul Voelker (2014 - Detroit Tigers)\n\n10th: Joel Hutter (2012 - Baltimore Orioles)\n\n10th: Evan Bigley (2008 - Minnesota Twins)\n\nUnder Heefner's direction, the Patriots' skipper has developed DBU into one of the most potent offensive teams in the nation. As a result of his leadership, DBU has inserted itself into the college baseball spotlight by ranking in the top 25 nationally in 110 offensive categories since 2005.

The Patriot Baseball Team has also embraced DBU’s mission of developing servant leaders by participating in numerous service activities in the community and even internationally.\n\nOver the past 17 years, the Patriots have served in the San Gabriel Orphanage and conducted baseball clinics while on mission trips to the Dominican Republic (2023 & 2011), Cuba (2019), Curacao (2015), and Guatemala (2007). The Patriots have also volunteered at the North Texas Food Bank, Habitat for Humanity, the Special Olympics of Texas Track and Field Championship, and conducted numerous free baseball clinics in and around Dallas. The team has also excelled in the classroom, posting a team GPA average of 3.21 since Heefner became head coach.\n\nBefore coming to DBU, Heefner was an assistant coach at Creighton University and the University of Northern Iowa. While at Creighton, he was the hitting and catching coach. Under his guidance in 2004, the Bluejay hitters saw an improvement in nearly every statistical category from the 2003 season, including a 24-point increase in batting average. Defensively, the Bluejay catchers contributed to Creighton’s nation-leading .982 fielding percentage, which at the time was the second-best in NCAA history.\n\nWhile working with the University of Northern Iowa hitters, his 2003 team led the Missouri Valley Conference in 10 offensive categories in conference play. His 2002 squad also posted the highest batting average of any team in conference play.\n\nAs a player, Heefner was named an All-American in his junior and senior seasons at Olivet Nazarene University, an NAIA school in Kankakee, Illinois. In 2000, he led the nation in both home runs (22) and RBIs (102). Before transferring to Olivet Nazarene University, Heefner played for two years at the University of Northern Iowa.\n\nHeefner received his bachelor’s degree from Olivet Nazarene University and his master’s from the University of Northern Iowa. Heefner and his wife, Liz, reside in Cedar Hill, Texas, with their five sons: Luke (22), David (19), Zachariah (18), Titus (16) and Jacob (10). The Heefners attend Midlothian Bible Church."
