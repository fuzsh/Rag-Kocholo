        "text": "By STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nBrennan Laird trains hitters and wants them to swing with conviction.\n\nThe former Earlham College (Richmond, Ind.) player and current Canes Indiana travel coach just started a training business called Own The Box Hitting, LLC. The tag line on the logo is “Confidence is Contagious.”\n\nLaird’s five pillars of hitting:\n\n1. Mindset.\n\n2. Timing.\n\n3. Approach (correlates with ball-strike counts).\n\n4. Mechanics.\n\n5. Situational hitting (baserunners and outs more than counts).\n\nLaird, who was at the University of Cincinnati for two years (2013-14 with a redshirt season) and played three at Earlham (2015-17) for Quakers head coach Steve Sakosits while hitting .323 (151-of-467) with eight home runs and 118 runs batted in over 125 games, says college and pro hitters tend to be confident because they have a plan in the batter’s box.\n\nAs an instructor, Laird looks to help high school and youth players develop a plan and mindset.\n\n“I know it’s impossible to prove it but I’d love to see statistical data of confident hitters with a plan vs. non-confident hitters that go up there just hoping to make contact.”\n\nLaird says a hitter with confidence and conviction are usually on-time.\n\n“Trying to get the barrel to the baseball is so hard especially with these pitchers that have this technology,” says Laird. “People are throwing hard than they ever have in the history of baseball.\n\n“The ultimate goal is to hit the baseball hard and if you do that, you win. You want to find ways to consistently barrel up baseballs.”\n\nLaird has studied many hitting methods and considers his methods as a hybrid and he is not tied to one philosophy though he incorporates many ideas from Eugene Bleecker (108 Performance).\n\n“I’m a huge believer in how the body moves,” says Laird. “There’s so much stuff out there for hitters to be successful. “You’ve just got to be able to research and find the right things based off body movements, biomechanics, kinesiology and all that stuff.\n\n“I do my best to put hitters in a better situation.”\n\nLaird, who resides in Greenwood, Ind., graduated from Earlham with a Business degree in 2017 and began giving hitting lessons to the Indiana Twins in 2018. Through a merger, the organization became Canes Indiana.\n\nFormer Canes Indiana president Jason Clymore is now with Baseball Academics Midwest and BAM and has the indoor training complex in Martinsville.\n\nCanes Indiana is under new leadership. Former Roncalli High School head coach Aaron Kroll now leads the organization. The group now rents space in Mooresville and a Mojo Up Sports Complex and plans to build a facility in the Mooresville/Martinsville area.\n\nTryouts for 2024-25 are expected to be complete by the beginning of August with Canes Indiana planning to field 12 teams next season. Laird will lead a 16U squad, the core of which comes from the 2023-24 15U BAM team.\n\nThere was also a stint as assistant coach at Indiana University Purdue University-Columbus (now IU Columbus).\n\nLaird, 30, became a father in late January. His son is Lincoln Laird.\n\n“It’s probably the best thing that ever happened to me,” says Laird. “I love that little dude to death.”\n\nThe rest of his immediate family lives in the Cleveland area. Laird is a 2012 graduate of Olmsted Falls (Ohio) High School, where he the starting quarterback for the Bulldogs football team in addition to his talents as a baseball outfielder for teams coached by Dan Largent.\n\nBY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nJustin Glass grew up in Fort Wayne, Ind., serious about baseball.\n\nWith few local resources, he found himself traveling to central Indiana for instruction.\n\nGlass was an all-state lefty swinger and righty thrower who helped Carroll High School to an IHSAA Class 4A state championship in 2010 then enjoyed a successful run at the University of Cincinnati (2011-14).\n\nWhen college was done, he had little to do with the game.\n\nWhile living in Westfield, Ind., and working as director of sales for the Indianapolis Colts, he found people asking him to share his expertise. He began giving lessons and Glass Sports Performance was begun in September 2020 with the help of Crossfit Westfield.\n\nJustin and wife Andrea (Newbauer) Glass, who helped Concordia Lutheran High School in Fort Wayne win its first state girls basketball title in 2010 then played at Indiana University, moved back to Fort Wayne in November 2023.\n\nWhile working full-time in medical sales, Justin continued to pursue his passion at a GSP Hitting building at 5520 Distribution Drive, near where I-69 and S.R. 3/U.S. 27 meet.\n\n“It’s not in a big facility but we’re making some waves,” says Glass.\n\nHe sees 40-plus baseball and softball hitters a week. About half that number get remote training and travel to Fort Wayne a few times a month.\n\n“I want to give back to the community and that next generation of players,” says Glass, 32.\n\nNot only is athletic knowledge imparted, two annual GSP fundraisers are apparel sales that raise money to buy toys for patients at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis and Christmas gifts for less-fortunate local kids.\n\nOn the hitting side, Glass is selective about whom he trains. They are usually at least in the eighth grade and they have to have college baseball or softball as their goal.\n\n“The talent level of our players is very high,” says Glass. “There are nine kids that we’ve helped in some form or fashion to get into college.\n\n“Our mission is to help the next generation of players reaching their goals. We work with players not only on the physical side of hitting but more importantly the mental side. We pride ourselves on making decisions based upon what is best for each player.”\n\nGlass talks with hitters about the mental side as well as their approach in the batter’s box.\n\n“If you have a bad round in the cage how do you mentally come back?,” says Glass. “One miss-hit can role into the next swing and the next swing. It snow-balls.\n\n“We have them step out, take a deep breath and using the tools to re-set your mind.”\n\nGlass does not look to batting average to as the ultimate gauge of success. Quality At-Bats is more important.\n\nHit-by-pitch, walk, sacrifice bunt, sacrifice fly, six-plus at-bat and hard-hit balls all go into QAB.\n\nWhat about approach?\n\n“In high school and college, it’s very situational,” says Glass. “We work a lot with our hitters on what pitches are we looking for on 0-0 counts? Or a green-light count? Or a red-light count?”\n\nThe pitching machine is delivering fastballs, breaking balls and change-ups and hitters are identifying those and putting their bodies into position to do damage.\n\n“We compete a lot in the cage so when they get int he (batter’s) box it’s almost we’ve already gone through the gauntlet,” says Glass. “I feel a little more comfortable and confident coming into the game.”\n\nGlass says a hitters’ talent might draw a coach to see him or her play, but do they also want to see the right approach.\n\n“Are they running things out?,” says Glass. “Are they having Quality At-Bats? Are they competition in the box? Or did the kid get out and threw his helmet and the world’s going to end?\n\n“Quality At-Bats builds a lot of confidence in hitters.”\n\nGlass emphasize the process for long-term success versus the short-term flash-in-the-pan result.\n\nGSP in built upon the concepts of honesty, accountability and relationships.\n\n“We hold kids accountable,” says Glass. “There’s a certain standard and we expect kids to adhere to that standard every single time.\n\n“If the kid is not working outside of lessons we can tell. We put a lot of energy and passion into each lesson. We have to make sure we’re getting it back on the other end. Maybe we’re not the best fit for them?”\n\nHe lets them know about work ethic it takes to play college ball and creates relationships with players and their parents, helping them through the recruiting process and reaching out to college coaches on their behalf.\n\nHe points them toward the people that can help them improve their strength, speed and nutrition.\n\nWhile Justin does much of the training, he is helped my father and former college player Brad Glass and former Fort Wayne Dwenger High School, Glen Oaks Community College and Purdue Fort Wayne player and current Indiana Tech assistant coach Sean Herberger.\n\nAs part of his travel ball experience, Glass was with the 17U Indiana Bulls coached by Quinn Moore and Dan Held. He maintains a relationship with both.\n\nAt Carroll, Glass played for Dave Ginder, who is now in the Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association and Northeast Indiana Baseball Association halls of fame.\n\n“Discipline, doing the little things correct whether it’s cleaning up the field or making sure our cleats were all cleaned up to things like baserunning and dirt-ball reads, getting proper lead-offs, cuts and relays, bunting and things like that, Dave did a really, really good job of teaching us,” says Glass. “That prepared me to have success at the (NCAA) Division I level.”\n\nGlass encountered two head coaches at Cincinnati — Brian Cleary for the first three seasons and Ty Neal for the last one.\n\n“Ty Neal was very similar to Ginder,” says Glass of the current Carmel (Ind.) High School head coach. “It was a very blue-collar work ethic, roll your sleeves up and hard-working environment. I actually liked that a lot.\n\n“We were very much holding each other accountable and trying to do the little things correctly. I learned a lot of those things from him.”\n\nAll 222 of Glass’ games with the Bearcats were starts. He hit .327 (287-of-877) with 17 home runs, three triples, 56 doubles, 141 runs batted in, 155 runs scored and 45 stolen bases.\n\nHe battled through a torn shoulder labrum as a freshman and still made the Big East/Big Ten Challenge all-tournament team and was named Joe Nuxhall Classic MVP, second-team all-Big East and Louisville Slugger Freshman All-America Team before surgery.\n\nGlass earned first-team all-Big East and second-team ABCA/Rawlings Mideast Region honors in 2012.\n\nCoaches and fellow players made him team captain for 2013.\n\nHow did he lead?\n\n“It was my work ethic and showing how hard we work in the weight room and taking practice very seriously,” says Glass. “Also, finding the right mix of people who could help us out.”\n\nIn 2014, Glass was chosen third-team all-American Athletic Conference.\n\nOne of his Cincinnati teammates in 2013 and 2014 was future Chicago Cubs outfielder Ian Happ.\n\n“He’s probably the smartest baseball player I ever played against or with,” says Glass of Happ. “There were a couple of situations when he was a freshman and I was a junior and I’d go, ‘how come you’re picking up on that and I’m not picking up on that yet?’\n\n“I was blown away by his knowledge of the game. And — knock on wood — he’s been able to stay healthy his entire career.”\n\nSome of the players Glass competed against in college include the University of Connecticut’s George Springer (now a Toronto Blue Jays outfielder), Matt Barnes (Washington Nationals pitcher) and Nick Ahmed (San Francisco Giants shortstop) and Indiana University’s Kyle Schwarber (Philadelphia Phillies designated hitter).\n\nBY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nA daily improvement mindset.\n\nThat’s what Luke Jaksich wants to see from the players who train with PRP Baseball at Mojo Up Sports Complex in Noblesville, Ind.\n\n“Our goal is to make sure that each day they’re progressing whether it’s mechanical or mindset,” says Jaksich, a former collegiate pitcher who is now helping others. “It’s not just looking at the end goal, it’s looking to the daily goal. What are you focusing on that day to get better?\n\n“The guys that come in consistently get the best results.”\n\nJaksich, who graduated from Andrean High School in Merrillville, Ind., in 2016 and Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., in 2021, was hired nearly three years ago as a performance coach and is now Assistant Director of Pitching.\n\nMunster (Ind.) High School graduate Anthony Gomez, who is a bullpen coach for the Buffalo Bisons, Triple-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, is PRP’s Director of Pitching. Carmel (Ind.) High School alum Greg Vogt, who is rehab pitching coach for the Blue Jays organization, is PRP’s Founder/Director.\n\nJaksich, 26, and the staff work with 8-year-olds and big leaguers, including Cleveland Guardians left-hander Timmy Herrin and Miami Marlins right-hander Bryan Hoeing. There were upwards of 20 professional pitchers at PRP this winter. The place operates seven days a week November until early March with in-person and remote clients.\n\nDuring the peak times, many weeks culminate with bullpens and pitchers going live against batters.\n\n“Friday Compete Day is fun,” says Jaksich. “Those are always a good time.”\n\nIt’s slower now, but it will pick back up again at the end of May as college and high school seasons wind down.\n\n“We’re attacking the little things with those older guys,” says Jaksich. “They might have one thing that needs to click from everything to get better.”\n\nJaksich notes that high schoolers and younger are still in the development stage.\n\n“We do a couple of things at a time and make sure we’re really in-depth with what we’re working on,” says Jaksich. “We make sure they’re staying consistent with their work.\n\n“Attention to detail is big. That is the biggest separator. Pro guys come in and get all their work done. High schoolers forget. We have to keep reminding them.”\n\nAmong those on the PRP staff working with pitchers besides Jaksich, Gomez and Vogt are Joey Romence, Nick Slone, Seth Story and Max McKee.\n\nTo ensure quality time with athletes, no more than about 25 come in during a block of time and they are helped by five or six coaches. Jacob Douglass leads the PRP hitting department.\n\n“We have to balance it out to make sure we are very attentive on the floor when we’re coaching,” says Jaksich. “We try to find the factors that are going to benefit them. It’s not going to be the same thing for each guy. There’s no one way to do it. If there was, it would be a lot easier.\n\n“As coaches, we have to keep gaining knowledge.”\n\nCommunication is key.\n\n“The more an athlete can communicate with us about certain things they’re doing it’s more beneficial for them,” says Jaksich. “That proves that they’re learning and trying to get the best out of everything instead of them looking for answers from us. We want to get answers from them.”\n\n“We talk with each person each day. We create that relationship where they can trust us for their development.”\n\nJaksich was born on the south side of Chicago and lived there until the eighth grade then moved to northwest Indiana.\n\nHe was with several travel ball teams including the Indiana Playmakers. He also played for the Northwest Indiana Oilmen of the Midwest Collegiate League (now Northern League).\n\nJaksich played for Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Famer Dave Pishkur at Andrean. Pishkur led the 59ers to Class 3A state championships in 2014 and 2015.\n\nHis high school pitching coach was Joe Plesac.\n\n“Joe’s an awesome guy,” says Jaksich. “I stay in-touch with him.”\n\nA member of the program in 2014, left-hander Jaksich started on the mound for Andrean in the 2015 championship game and pitched into the fifth inning before moving to first base.\n\nFrom Andrean, Jaksich went to Saint Joseph’s College in Rensselaer, Ind. As a freshman in 2017, he started in 11 games and won three. That turned out to be the NCAA Division II Pumas’ final season as the school shut down and long-time head coach Rick O’Dette headed to Florida to guide the program at Saint Leo University.\n\nJaksich transferred to Ball State and hurled for the Rich Maloney-coached Cardinals 2018-21. At BSU, he made 65 mound appearances (51 in relief) with nine victories and one save and also earned General Studies degree with a Psychology minor.\n\nHe then pitched in six games with the 2021 independent American Association’s Sioux City (Iowa) Explorers before joining the coaching staff at Alderson-Broaddus University in Philippi, W.Va., where 2011 Westview High School graduate and former Saint Joseph’s assistant Zac Mishler was Battlers head coach. ABU closed in 2023.\n\nJaksich reflects back on his career.\n\n“The minute I stopped caring about the result is when I started getting better,” says Jaksich. “That’s the way to go about this game. You’re going to fail. I stopped caring about being perfect out there.\n\n“I wish I had more training like this when I played,” says Jaksich. “The private sector training has really taken off.”\n\nBY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nJustin Kamm built a career in Information Technology.\n\nAt one point, Indiana University had Kamm running the internet for all its campuses across the state. That led to positions are software companies ExactTarget and Sales Force.\n\nA former baseball coach at Park Tudor School in Indianapolis, Kamm opted to retire early from the IT industry.\n\n“I decided to dedicate my time to teaching the game of baseball,” says Kamm, who took over the Indy Titans and became president of the travel organization which now fields 36 teams from 8U to 17U and founded Indiana Baseball Academy in Westfield, Ind. “I felt it led me to success in my life and I wanted to give that back to folks and the only way I knew how to do that was through coaching.”\n\nKamm is a 1992 graduate of North Central High School in Indianapolis, where Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Hall of Famer Tom Bradley was Panthers head coach his freshmen and sophomore years and Rick Shadiow his junior and senior seasons. Current Brownsburg (Ind.) High School head coach Dan Roman was a Shadiow assistant.\n\nAt Vincennes (Ind.) University, Kamm did not play baseball at the school he formed a relationship with the Trailblazers head coach Jerry Blemker, who went into the National Junior College Athletic Association Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\n“There are lots of lessons learned from all those coaches,” says Kamm, who also went to Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis and Indiana Wesleyan University and earned a Business Management degree. “I learned to care about players as individuals and teach life lessons.”\n\nAt the end of January 2024, Kamm added head baseball coach at Warren Central High School on Indy’s east side to his diamond duties.\n\nWarren Central (enrollment around 3,500) is a member of the Metropolitan Interscholastic Conference (with Ben Davis, Indianapolis North Central, Lawrence Central, Lawrence North and Pike).\n\nMIC games are home-and-home series on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.\n\nThe Warriors are part of an IHSAA Class 4A sectional grouping in 2024 with Arsenal Tech, Franklin Central, Perry Meridian, Roncalli and Southport. Warren Central has won nine sectional titles — the last in 1991.\n\nOther teams on the schedule, which includes the May 11 Warrior Invitational as well as the first round of the Marion County Tournament, include Brebeuf Jesuit, Danville Community, Greenfield-Central, Greenwood Community, Indianapolis Bishop Chatard, Indianapolis Kings, Indianapolis Scecina Memorial, Indianapolis Shortridge, New Palestine, Shelbyville, Speedway and Whiteland Community.\n\nEli Shaw (Class of 2023) is a right-handed pitcher at Indiana University. The team took a field trip March 28 to see him hurl at Butler University.\n\nCollege baseball commits in the Class of 2024 include Justin Concepcion to the University of Northwestern Ohio and Jackson Hobbs and Lucas Hobbs both to Marian University’s Ancilla College.\n\nKamm’s Warren Central coaching staff features three returnees and three newcomers.\n\n“I think it’s important to keep continuity,” says Kamm.\n\nJeff Cardenas, Todd Wellman and Josh Ott are back with the varsity. New to the program as coaches are varsity coach Jordan Hamsley and junior varsity coaches Zach Summeier and Aaron Betts.\n\nFort Wayne Bishop Luers High School graduate Cardenas played at the University of Northwestern Ohio and independent pro ball.\n\nFloyd Central High School graduate Hamsley played at Indiana Wesleyan and was a strength and conditioning coach in the Atlanta Braves organization.

My swing would be too slow or constricted. I was a half step slow to a grounder or started tripping over my own feet because I was too nervous to play.\n\n“There were times as a pitcher when the hitter scared the heck out of me. I don’t know if I can get this guy out.”\n\nAs a fan, Mancini became intrigued by the psychological side of sports.\n\n“This guy is so good. Why does he not come through in this clutch situation?,” says Mancini. “This team is physically better and should be beating this particular opponent and they’re not doing it.”\n\nFrom studying mental performance, Mancini has learned how to help athletes — and business professionals — deal with the stress and unlock the capability within themselves.\n\n“As an athlete what you want to do is come away from a competition, season or career and say that was the best I could do,” says Mancini. “Once you know you’ve expended 100 percent of your talent out there to be the best you can, it’s fun.”\n\nThe result is irrelevant because the person has done as much as their aptitude allows.\n\nAs a youth baseball coach, Mancini saw players beating themselves up and lacking in confidence.\n\nThe player trying to hit .300 got caught up in a slump and started doing the math and thinking about future at-bats instead of staying in the moment.\n\n“How do you have a good at-bat right now?,” says Mancini. “Any particular situation, just get the best experience you can.”\n\nMancini began working with travel baseball and hockey teams and that expanded to individual high school athletes and teams and the opportunity to work with college teams, including IUSB and Bethel University.\n\n“These are skills that can translate into other aspects of their lives,” says Mancini. “I’ve had many student-athletes after they’ve worked with me for a little bit tell me that they’re able to use it in the classroom.”\n\nIt’s concepts like staying in the present moment, calming themselves down and tapping into confidence that’s lowered stress and raised performance.\n\nMancini emphasizes that mental performance training is not just for the elite athlete bound for big-time college, professional or Olympic glory.\n\nWhile most college and all pro teams have a mental performance department, it’s not just for them.\n\n“This is about just trying to be the best version of yourself that you can be,” says Mancini. “If that means you’re the next Tiger Woods, Kobe Bryant or Mike Trout, fantastic.\n\n“Most of the time when an athlete gets frustrated it’s when they know they could have done better.”\n\nSometimes thoughts of avoiding mistakes and focusing on the outcome get in that way.\n\nMancini imparts his knowledge to groups and goes one-on-one.\n\nAn assessment consisting of several questions about how they feel about their mental game helps Mancini craft a strategy that is unique to the individual.\n\nJust like the mechanics of hitting, throwing and fielding, mental skills are techniques that can be employed to improve performance.\n\n“There is a tangible skill set that you can use to help you with your mental game,” says Mancini. “If you can help yourself with the mental game, it provides you with the opportunity to get even more out of your physical talent.”\n\nPlayers like New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge use what the mental performance world calls the “Three R’s” — Recognition, Re-group and Re-focus.\n\nJudge recognizes when a bad umpire call, cold weather, an error or strikeout with the bases loaded is starting to get the best of him.\n\nFrom that, he re-groups. It’s a physical routine to help put the distraction away and focus on the task at-hand.\n\nOne Major League Baseball player has been known to flush the dugout toilet after a mistake and move on.\n\n“We talked present moment a lot in the mental performance field,” says Mancini. “We re-focus on what is important right now. It’s a process to do away with the distraction.\n\nAnd a way to be the best they can be.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nBaseball training for Ed Schlueter is not about being the best today as much as it is achieving big gains over the days, weeks, months and years to come.\n\n“I’m trying to grow the youth programs in our area to be more successful in the long run and not the short term,” says Schlueter, the founder of Baseball Directive in northwest Indiana and a full-time instructor for about five years (he is a former teacher, Rensselaer, Ind., Central High School head baseball coach and painter). “I want players to swing the bat fast and hit the ball hard.\n\n“We might swing and miss more at 8 (years old) with a pitching machine but when we hit the ball, we hit it hard.”\n\nThat’s more important to Schlueter than winning games in those young age groups.\n\n“I don’t even know why we keep score at 7 and 8. It just drives me nuts,” says Schlueter. “I’m trying to get more to the development piece of this.”\n\nSchlueter, a 2011 graduate of Saint Joseph’s College in Rensselaer, who majored in History and Secondary Education and pitched for the Rick O’Dette-coached Pumas, currently instructs players at private pole barns in DeMotte (Jasper County) and Francesville (Pulaski County).\n\nHe spends at least an hour everyday doing something to become a better instructor. He takes online courses and does lots of reading — always something related to his business.\n\nHe attended the 2024 American Baseball Coaches Association Convention in Dallas and soaked in knowledge that he can impart to his clients.\n\nSchlueter, who has served as president of Wheatfield (Ind.) Little League, has been focusing on development and is seeing methods he’s culled from places like Driveline Baseball, 108 Performance and Tread Athletics begin to pay dividends.\n\n“I’m trying to blend what I think is right from all of them instead of just trying to stay on one track,” says Schlueter.\n\nMany of his students are in elementary school or junior high.\n\n“I’m finally getting players who have been through my system for a longer period of time,” says Schlueter. “Now we’re seeing the ultimate picture where they get to play at the next level — high school or beyond.”\n\nOne of his long-time pupils just began his college baseball career. He started going to Schlueter at 13.\n\n“He was tall, lanky, underweight and couldn’t hit the ball very hard,” says Schlueter. “All we did was maximize for hitting the ball hard.\n\n“After one fall of junior college and focusing on development he’s getting a lot of attention from bigger four-year schools — both (NCAA) Division I and Division II.\n\n“People told him he couldn’t because he was too skinny and too small. It’s gratifying for me, but he’s also the one that put in the work. I’m not trying to take any part of success for any of my players and what they do. I’m just trying to point them in the right direction. If you do these things it’s going to give you a better opportunity further on (down the road).”\n\nDepending on the time of year, Schlueter trains 40 to 60 players.\n\n“I’m just trying to get kids more athletic with their swing and their pitching,” says Schlueter. “I’ve gotten more away from the lesson model.\n\n“We’ll do mechanical things. But, especially with the younger kids, I want them to learn how to be athletic through their movements.”\n\nLucas Schlueter — Ed and Meagan’s 11-year-old son — has been learning the game from his father since he was in T-ball.\n\n“He’s very, very invested in baseball,” says Ed of Lucas. “I’ve always used him as a my guinea pig.\n\n“I’ve seen his growth in the game.”\n\nFather and son are involved with the North Central Cyclones travel organization. The season tends to go from April to mid-July with 30 to 40 games.\n\n“We try to practice two days a week between weekend tournaments and not schedule schedule more than two tournaments in a row,” says Schlueter. “We’re trying to create balance. We let the kids have higher competition but not burn them out.”\n\nThe weekend, Schleuter and Ethan Duensing (Calumet Christian Class of 2023) begin leading a 12-week preparation camp. It’s the third year for the program with two-hour hitting and pitching sessions each Saturday.\n\n“We’re trying to get them ready for their season and ingraining hitting the ball hard, throwing the ball hard and let’s keep you healthy,” says Schlueter. “Let’s be athletic and let things fly.”\n\nPlayers who attend the camp can go onto to their teams at the start of April having already seen pitches at game speed.\n\n“Young kids just need a lot of reps,” says Schlueter. “We use Rapsodo and to measure everything we can.”\n\nThose numbers are displayed on a screen that players can see.\n\nThey will get in the cage and be told things like: “This round of 10 you’re just trying to smoke the ball. I don’t care where they go right now. You’re trying to swing as hard as you can and hit the ball as hard as you can.”\n\nA 10-year-old might set a goal of achieving 60 mph for an exit velo.\n\nThe next time he can go for 65 and so on.\n\nSchlueter uses the analogy of an elevator.\n\n“If you continue to raise your ceiling your floor is going to come with it,” says Schlueter.\n\nWhat often happens is that as the max goes up so does the average.\n\n“Improvements are not linear,” says Schlueter. “It’s going to go up and down a little bit. But over a long period we’re seeing a lot more improvement.”\n\nTo promote bat speed and EV, Schleuter incorporates plyoballs, overload and underload bats.\n\n“We get some good outcomes when we go back to our regular bat,” says Schlueter. “It’s not a magic silver bullet. They are just more tools in the toolbox.\n\n“We’re trying to find what works for each player. What is the player going to buy into that clicks with them? We have our standardized ideas of what we want to do, but how do we individualize it to that player?”\n\nBaseball Directive is on social media: X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and YouTube.\n\nBY STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nTyler Beck has accumulated a vast body of baseball knowledge.\n\nHe has excelled on the diamond with the traveling Indiana Chargers and Michiana Scrappers, South Bend (Ind.) Saint Joseph High School, Pasco-Hernando State College (New Port Richey, Fla.) and the University of Tampa (after starting his college career at Purdue University) and is currently a free agent after pitching for the Minnesota Twins and Washington Nationals organizations (2019, 2021-23), making it to Triple-A with each.\n\nIn 2023, the 6-foot-1 right-hander made a combined 26 mound appearances (25 in relief) and went 5-0 with a 5.71 earned run average, 44 strikeouts and 25 walks in 41 innings.\n\nTyler and wife Melanie, who are eloped and are planning a Dec. 31 wedding, have a daughter born in November — Bella Marie.\n\nBeck, 28, has an Exercise Science degree from Tampa and has worked as many human performance labs and training facilities.\n\nAs he gets ready for his next move as a player, Beck is starting his own player development service based in South Bend — Beck Performance — and is operating out of the 1st Source Bank Performance Center at Four Winds Field in South Bend, where Mark Haley is general manager and South Bend Cubs Foundation executive director. “I’m trying to provide a product I wish I had in this area. Ultimately, I want to offer an all-inclusive environment for baseball players to challenge themselves and become the best athlete they can possibly be.\n\n“From a baseball perspective that includes a place you can show up to get your lifting, throwing, speed and recovery work done all at the same facility. It’s a one-stop shop.”\n\nBeck recently made a presentation on a 12-week throwing program to the South Bend Cubs Foundation Cubbies Coaches Club.\n\nHe talked about things like acute and chronic workload and injury risk and spelled out a training cycle.\n\nBeck explained overuse and underdevelopment.\n\nThe program for high schoolers is open to pitchers and position players and runs from Jan. 8-March 31 with two group workouts each week — 9 a.m. Sundays and at a time to be determined Thursdays.\n\nThe program includes the following:\n\n* A mapped-out throwing progression leading into the high school season (constraint throws, long toss, plyo throws, med ball throws, bullpens, pitch design and Live ABs).\n\n* Two throwing sessions per week on high-intent days.\n\n* Velo recording with Stalker Pro II to track continuous progress for med ball, plyo and constraint throwing.\n\n* Rapsodo Pitching 2.0 for bullpens and pitch design.\n\n* Other Modalities: Core Velo Belt, Water Bags, Weight Balls and Plyo Balls.\n\n* Weight room workouts, mobility correctives and arm care.\n\n* Four lifts per week (2 Upper and 2 Lower).\n\n* Individual mobility exercises.\n\n* Post throw and pre throw routines.\n\nAll of this is programmed through the TrainHeroic App, where you will have access to videos and descriptions of the exercises. This allows the athlete to do their workouts at their most convenient gym, if they cannot use 1st Source Bank Performance Center.\n\nEach athlete will have access to the weight room at the Performance Center.\n\nIf there is enough interest, Beck is willing to have morning lifts at the Performance Center before school.\n\nThere will also be video analysis to look for clear movement deficiencies and tailor throwing/weight room progressions towards those weaknesses.\n\n“I want to get these guys prepped for the season,” says Beck.\n\nCost is three payments of $320 (Jan. 8, Feb. 5 and March 4).\n\nContact Beck at 574-303-2189 or tylerb755@gmail.com.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nThere’s a family legacy tied to baseball and northeast Indiana that is still going strong today and aiding another generation of ballplayers.\n\nBill Jones came from Ohio to DeKalb High School in Auburn, Ind., and became a founding member of the Indiana High School Baseball Coaches Association (1971) and won 15 sectionals, three regionals, two semi-states and an IHSAA state championship (1980).\n\nCombining his coaching victories at Vaughnsville and Hicksville in Ohio with DeKalb and Canterbury in Indiana, hard-nosed Jones emphasized fundamentals and amassed 751 victories. He shared his knowledge by offering lessons and establishing a fall instructional league. He went into the IHSBCA Hall of Fame in 1982 and was the association’s executive director for many years. He passed away in 2015.\n\nBrad Jones, Bill and Mildred’s oldest son, played at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., and coached high school baseball in Ohio.\n\nKen Jones, Bill’s second son, graduated from DeKalb in 1990 and participated in the IHSBCA North/South All-Star Series that year. He played at Western Michigan University, spent two years in the San Diego Padres organization then coached for more than two decades at the NCAA Division I and high school levels. He was an assistant at Ball State (1997-98), WMU 1999-2004), Purdue Fort Wayne (2020-23).\n\nThe first grandson, Chris Menzie (son of Pat and Laura), played at Huntington (Ind.) University.\n\nTyler Jones, son of Brad and Stacie, pitched at the University of Dayton.\n\nHayden Jones, son of Ken and Jennifer, graduated from Carroll High School in Fort Wayne where he represented the Chargers in the 2018 IHSBCA North/South All-Star Series, played at Mississippi State University and Illinois State University and completed his third season as a catcher in the Cincinnati Reds system in 2023.\n\nSince 2004, Ken Jones has been offering private baseball instruction for individuals and groups. More than 30 clients have advanced to D-I programs with more than 80 going on to NAIA, D-II or D-III. More than 15 have played pro ball.\n\nAfter operating out of numerous area facilities, Jones established 260 Baseball Club in his own building north of downtown Fort Wayne at 1629 Beach Street. The doors were opened in August 2023.\n\nThe converted industrial building has cages for batting and space for throwing. Plans call for a display saluting the legacy of Bill Jones.\n\nInstructors at 260 Baseball Club include Ken Jones, Hayden Jones and Garrett Schoenle. Hayden is the off-season catcher for Chicago White Sox minor league pitcher Schoenle.\n\nBetween 80 and 100 individuals come for lessons each year.\n\n“I’m not going to have a mass of people come in here day-in and day-out,” says Ken Jones, 52. “I’m going to try to keep it more manageable and give them the best information and instruction we can give them.”\n\nWhat about teaching the game gives Ken Jones satisfaction?\n\n“It’s enjoyable when you see guys that can take some of the information you give them, put it to use and have more success than they were beforehand,” says Ken Jones. “You see them grow in confidence and excited about things again. Something clicks and they end up having good high school seasons or even be able to play high school ball for some of them. Hopefully, they get into college ball from there.”\n\nJones stresses that baseball can be a tool to continue education.\n\n“Most of them will not be playing professional ball but if they continue it into college that’s a nice experience,” says Ken Jones. “I’ll get a lot of cards and text messages (from parents) and it’s not always about the baseball aspect of it all the time. We really appreciate how you mentored (the player) outside of baseball whether it’s academics or life lessons. The kids will respond that way also.”\n\nCoaching is more than just the skill he’s teaching for Jones.\n\n“To me to do any instruction well you have to talk with them during the lessons and you’ve got to find out what’s going on in their lives,” says Ken Jones. “It could be that they had a grandparent pass away or they had something going on in school.\n\n“You build that relationship with the kid and sometimes even with the parents.\n\n“You try to mentor as much as you can.”\n\nHayden Jones, 23, tells what he gains as an instructor.\n\n“It’s mainly giving back to the kids what I had growing up at my fingertips,” says Hayden Jones. “What we’re learning at the professional level is not what some random guy on social media is teaching. We’re actually going through it at the highest level.\n\n“Kids enjoy being around guys who are at the professional level.”\n\nJones says he wants to get the big leagues while also sharing his know-how with those having diamond goals.\n\n“I want to make them as good as they can be and go as far in the game as they can,” says Hayden Jones. “I don’t expect them to pick up on everything the first time they come in.\n\n“It’s the little improvements each time they come in. It might be mentally. It might be baseball-wise. It might just be growing up as a guy or a girl that comes in here.”\n\nBill Jones was not shy about getting on a player if he thought it was necessary. Hayden Jones has come to appreciate that.\n\n“If your coach stops yelling at you he’s given up on you,” says Hayden Jones. “That’s something my grandpa always lived by. It’s true.\n\n“A college coach that comes in and says we’re going to give you a scholarship. We’re not going to get on you. It’s all going to be rainbows and flowers. It’s not like that. It’s just life. You deserve it. Live and learn.”\n\nWhile 260 Baseball Club does have a social media presence, many players come to Ken Jones and son based on reputation and word-of-mouth.\n\n“That’s the best thing we have going for us,” says Ken Jones. “My dad would be shocked at how much the world of private instruction and baseball facilities have grown in the last 10 years.”\n\nThe last IHSBCA State Clinic in Indianapolis that Bill Jones attended, Ken took him past what was then a new Grand Park in Westfield, Ind.\n\n“He was just amazed at seeing that space and fields,” says Ken Jones.\n\nMany training facilities are in pole barns or tucked into industrial parks. Jones’ building is in the middle of a residential neighborhood.\n\nHayden Jones, who married the former Savannah Shinn (who he met freshman year at Mississippi State) Nov. 11 in Gulf Shores, Ala., has been helping at 260 Baseball Club while preparing to report Goodyear, Ariz. A check-in is slated for early January with minor league spring training beginning in late February.\n\nHayden Jones does hitting and catching work at 260 Baseball Club and his strength and conditioning at Carroll High School.\n\nS&C coach Dan Jones (no relation) writes Hayden’s training program and is in communication with the Reds strength staff.\n\nDave Ginder, Jones’ head coach at Carroll, is to enter the IHSBCA Hall of Fame in January.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nManny Lopez played professional baseball for the Fort Wayne (Ind.) Wizards. He was a righty-swinging outfielder for the Minnesota Twins affiliate 1998-2000.\n\nThe native of Santo Domingo, D.R., enjoyed the Summit City and its baseball community so much that he made it his home.\n\nLopez, 45, wears many hats. He is owner, senior baseball instructor and director of player development at The Diamond Baseball and Softball Academy, a 12,800 square-foot training facility at 3203 Saint Joe Center Road, and coaches for the Fort Wayne Diamondbacks travel organization.\n\n“Why do I do it? I love it,” says Lopez. “I got the opportunity to stay in the game. It gives me an opportunity to make a living.\n\n“But the main thing is it’s allowed me to help a lot of people who probably couldn’t do it in a different way.”\n\nWhen Lopez was coming up in the Dominican, he met and began working with strength and conditioning coach Angel Presinal.\n\n“I couldn’t really afford it,” says Lopez. “The way he did things is that you didn’t really pay him until you made it to the big leagues. So the big leaguers were the ones paying for the program. In the same way (The Diamond and the Fort Wayne Diamondbacks) to do some of that. I’m able to take care of some people that might have fallen into hard times.”\n\nLopez has received offers to join bigger travel organizations, but that’s not for him.\n\n“When I’m in the cages and I’m on the field I’m in my element,” says Lopez. “I have a son (Manuel Lopez) who played college ball over at Rose-Hulman (in Terre Haute). But I just enjoy it.”\n\nBaseball is such a big part of life for Lopez, who is divorced.\n\nWhen he goes on vacation it’s often to see academies in the Dominican or to spring training to see how friends are coaching the game and keeping himself up-to-date on the latest training methods and drills.\n\n“I love it,” says Lopez. “I live for it.”\n\nAs a player, Lopez was in the Twins organization for four years, hitting .256 with 19 home runs and 134 runs batted in 322 games, and then played four more years in independent ball with the Rio Grande Valley White Wings, San Angelo Colts, Fort Worth Cats, Winnipeg Goldeyes and Edinburg Roadrunners, hitting .327 with 29 homers and 190 RBIs in 291 games.\n\nIn 2000, Lopez got married and moved to Fort Wayne.\n\nManny concluded his playing career in the fall of 2003 and went to give instruction in Warsaw, Ind., at the request of Gary and Cindy Witt. In 2004, he coached the Warsaw Sluggers.\n\nJavier DeJesus, who played for the Wizards in 1994 and was a pro pitcher 1992-2001 and local radio personality Charly Butcher started the Fort Wayne Cubs in 2004 and that fall DeJesus invited Lopez to join him and the Cubs had two teams 16U and 18U.\n\nAlong the way, the Cubs became the Diamondbacks.\n\nThe Diamond was on Keystone Drive for 11 1/2 years in a space that had been Extra Innings and changed locations in 2022.\n\nBesides Lopez instructors are DeJesus, Glen McClain, Seamus Brazill and Wayne McCoy (softball).\n\nThrough the years, there have been between 175 and 225 on the travel teams and hundreds more come to camps and clinics or take lessons.\n\nIt’s common to have a whole team come in to practice.\n\n“Our facility is open for all our players to come in and utilize it any way they want,” says Lopez.\n\nStrength and conditioning means body weight movements at 13 or younger. Weight training is introduced at 14.\n\nThe plan is to field about a dozen teams ranging from 9U to 17U in 2024.\n\nCoaches include Lopez, DeJesus, Christopher Clabaugh, Keith Deck, Justin Faw, Maxwell Foster, Derek Gordon, Shane Graft, Donnie Haire, Weston Hanks, Brad Knipp, Henry Lopez, Josh Loucks, Brian Maxey, Alexander McKinstry, Thomas Newhard, Brett Oribello, Jason Ott, Adam Robinson, Mike Ryan, Todd Taylor, Brian Thomas, Leaf Vanover and Doug Werling.\n\nThe Diamondbacks regularly play in events at Grand Park in Westfield, Ind., and Championship Park in Kokomo, Ind., plus the Worthington Wood Bat Tournament in Ohio and events put on by the Cincy Flames. There’s also home games at the ASH Centre in Fort Wayne or diamonds in Decatur, Ind., or Kendallville, Ind., and fall showcases for the older players.\n\nThe younger players have a season that goes for about 15 weekends plus weekday games starting with the end of spring break. Older players go for up to nine weekends plus weekday contest beginning around the time of high school sectionals.\n\nNot counting recent college commits, the organization has had about 275 players go on to college over the years.\n\nThe Fort Wayne Cubs/Diamondbacks have two players currently in the majors — outfielder Kevin Kiermaier and outfielder/infielder Zach McKinstry.\n\nBy STEVE KRAH\n\nhttp://www.IndianaRBI.com\n\nFor the past decade the Indiana Braves have been making an impact on the travel baseball scene.\n\nThe organization established in 2014 held tryouts a few weeks ago and head into 2023-24 with seven baseball teams: 10U, 13U, 14U, 15U, 16U and two 17U/18U squads.\n\nJoe Coughlan is Indiana Braves president and recruiting coordinator. A former varsity assistant to Pioneers head coach Eric McGaha at Mooresville High School who has coached for the Indiana Bulls and in the Prep Baseball Report Future Games, he also serves as a hitting/pitching instructor.\n\nIndiana Braves vice president Koby Hennessy played for Coughlan at Mooresville High School. He graduated from there in 2019 and went on to earn a Kinesiology degree at the University of Indianapolis and is now studying at Indiana State University to become a Doctor of Physical Therapy. He coaches the 15U team and is strength and conditioning coach.\n\nAnthony Rossok, who played at Anderson (Ind.) University, is head coach of one 17U/18U team and Caden Oliver (Vincennes, Ind., University) leads the other.\n\nKameron Leach (University of Indianapolis) is pitching director. Caden Bradley (Marian University in Indianapolis) and Craig Perry (Indiana University Purdue University-Columbus) are assistant coaches.\n\nCoughlan took over the 12,000-square foot training space that houses Players Performance Factory, 740 S. Indiana St., Mooresville (on the back side of The Village Shopping Center), in November 2019.\n\nPlayers Performance Factory with areas for throwing, hitting and strength training and the development-focused Indiana Braves are two separate entities. PPF is a business and the Indiana Braves call it home. Coughlan is the president of both.\n\nBeing part of the Indiana Braves — or for those who are not — word of mouth is how most come to the facility to work out and take lessons. While many are local, some come from as far as 80 miles one-way.\n\n“We’re really helping the community and area baseball and softball players,” says Coughlan. “I don’t use this as my main source of income. That’s why we don’t have 30 teams. This isn’t my full-time job.\n\n“We use this more for the program and for the kids.”\n\nWhile it may not be shiny and new, the facility is a place to get better.\n\n“I feel like we get it done with grit and hard work more than anything,” says Coughlan. “Guys know they can’t come in here and mess around.”\n\nHennessy sees players at 14 and seven 17 or 18 that are newcomers to strength training.\n\n“We’re getting guys to fall in love with the weight room,” says Hennessy. “Getting your swings in is important but being physically ready to go out and play baseball is as important as anything else.”\n\nHennessy wants players have have an attacking mindset and a drive to improve.\n\n“I like to see the growth that guys have while they’re here in the weight room along with the baseball stuff,” says Hennessy. “Seeing those guys find themselves in here is super fun.”\n\nWith limited space to do top speed work, Hennessy has players concentrating on acceleration — so they can quickly get out of the (batter’s) box and run down fly balls in the outfield etc.\n\n“It’s a good mix of agility, strength, acceleration, change of direction and all that stuff,” says Hennessy. “One of the big buzzwords in the baseball strength and conditioning world is rotational power. How fast and how strong can you rotate? Rotational power is kind of our baseline of what we try to focus on.”\n\nThis is done with things like a rotational medicine ball throw, barbell presses with a Landmine Jack plus other jumping and throwing motions with rotation.\n\nCoughlan does his best to get players a place to play at the next level.\n\n“One of the biggest holes I’ve noticed in travel baseball is when leave big programs at 17 they’re still not signed,” says Coughlan. “Ninety percent of college players aren’t signed until the fall or spring or their senior year.\n\n“So what we’ve been doing the past couple of years is picking up on the 18U guys and really helping them get signed.\n\n“It’s just helping those guys figure out what fits them education-wise and then honing in on a school where they’re a good fit.”\n\nOver the years, Coughlan has cultivated good relationships with college coaches.\n\nThe 17U/18U Indiana Braves will scrimmage at a college for additional exposure and it often results in multiple offers.\n\nIndiana University-Purdue University Columbus and Vincennes University are on this fall’s schedule and it’s hoped a date can be set with Indiana University-Kokomo. The team has visited Lincoln Trail College in Robinson, Ill., and Olney (Ill.) Central College.\n\nCoughlan expects to see plenty more signings from the Class of 2024 while they play and train with the Indiana Braves.\n\n“We kind of owe them this,” says Coughlan of those who have yet to commit. “They need that mentorship and that help. Having a facility gives them a home to come to and work out all the time.”\n\nRight-handed pitcher Bradley Brehmer (Decatur Central Class of 2018/Wright State) is now with Delmarva in the Baltimore Orioles organization.\n\nFrom the Class of 2023, there’s Kaden Barr (Decatur Central/IU-Kokomo), Brayden Coffey (Decatur Central/IU-Kokomo), Darius Compton (Monrovia/IUPU-Columbus), Judah Hennessy (Mooresville/IU-Kokomo), Grant Kessler (Morristown/Mount St. Joseph), Will Lewis (Pike/IUPU-Columbus), Cooper Martin (Plainfield/Pepperdine), Alec Murphy (Brownsburg/IU-Kokomo), Bryce Pax (Plainfield/Eastern Florida State), Matt Ritter (Avon/DePauw), Pryce Rucker (Franklin Community/Clark State CC), Jaren Sanders (Greenwood Community/Community Christian College), Nate Simpson (Avon/Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne), Zach Warrum (Speedway/IUPU-Columbus), Donovin Woodall (Whiteland/Lincoln Trail) and Andrew Youmans (Southport/IU-Kokomo).\n\nThere’s also baseball players Miles Alexander (Avon/Frontier CC), Chase Alford (Beech Grove/Kaskaskia), Erik Brandow (Center Grove/Franklin College), Eric Braughton (Indian Creek/Northwest Florida State), Charez Butcher (Kokomo/IMG Academy/Tennessee), Nick Caplinger (Monrovia/Goshen College), Austin Carr (Franklin Central/Grace), Connor Christopher (Jeffersonville/Olney Central), Brady Coram (Mooresville/Danville Area CC), Andrew Coughlan (Mooresville/Lincoln Trail), Cameron Crick (Greenwood Community/Asbury), Jaylen Decker (Mooresville/Danville Area CC), Brayden DeMier (Bloomington South/Southern Indiana), Chris Dobbs (Roncalli/Rose-Hulman), Conner Dove (Eastside/Trine), Braden Feltner (Plainfield/Indiana Wesleyan), Jalen Frais (Indianapolis North Central/IU South Bend), Cole Graverson (Hamilton Southeastern/Butler) and Parker Gryskevich (Brownsburg/Wittenberg);\n\nIn addition to Brian Harding (Kokomo/Rock Valley), Cooper Harrington (Decatur Central/Earlham), Jack Hart (Avon/Earlham), Tanner Haston (Mooresville/Purdue), Luke Helton (Whiteland/Morehead State), Kaden Hill (Zionsville/Montevallo), Jake Holzhausen (Whiteland/Ancilla), Luke Houin (South Bend St. Joseph/Purdue), Jordan Kistler (Avon/Olney Central), Jackson Kurrasch (Mooresville/IUPU-Columbus), Tarron Lawson (Danville Community/Eastern Illinois), Bryce Lewman (Decatur Central/Frontier CC), Corbin Maddox (Daleville/Anderson U), Jeren Maxwell (Monrovia/Olney Central), Riley Mertl (Westfield/Frontier CC), Andrew Miles (Cascade/Knox College), Blake Mills (Danville Community/Ancilla), Alex Mitchell (Decatur Central/Indiana Tech), Austin Mitchell (Decatur Central/Indiana Tech), Brennan Moran (Covenant Christian/Spring Arbor) and Wendell Mosteller (Avon/Concordia University Chicago);\n\nPlus Andrew Neff (Mooresville/Cincinnati), Cooper Noel (Monrovia/Kankakee CC), Brenden Oliver (Mooresville/Cincinnati), Caden Oliver (Mooresville/Vincennes U), Conner Jelley (Monrovia/Piedmont), Braedon Payne (Avon/Olivet Nazarene), Garison Poteet (Ben Davis/Indiana Purdue-Fort Wayne), Kyren Power (Avon/Heartland CC), Dawson Read (Indian Creek/Kalamazoo College), Ethan Reed (Brebeuf/Finlandia), Tyler Rhoades (Hamilton Southeastern/Hanover), Bryce Robbins (Mt. Vernon-Fortville/Indiana Wesleyan) and Jack Robinson (Mooresville/Vincennes U);\n\nAlso, Ethan Shafer (Danville Community/Indiana Wesleyan), Carson Shelton (Monrovia/Rend Lake), Brandon Smalling (Mooresville/Earlham), Krae Sparks (Greenwood Christian/Indiana Wesleyan), Dylan Sprong (Indian Creek/Wabash College), Spencer Strobel (Avon/Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne), Keenan Taylor (Guerin Catholic/Butler), Cooper Thacker (Edgewood/Southern Indiana), Mason Thomas (Fishers/Fayetteville Tech), Riley Weston (Danville Community/Clark State CC), Jackson White (Eastside/Franklin College), Jackson Wynn (Danville Community/Parkland), Jacob Young (Bloomington South/Dallas Baptist) and Sy Zickler (Brownstown Central/Clark State CC).\n\nBaseball players from outside the state include Mitch Duncan, Nik Johnson, Brendan Killeen and Logan Smith.\n\nSoftball player Madi Kammer (Franklin County/Hanover) is another Class of 2023 commit. Because so many players have moved on, the Indiana Braves will not field a softball team in 2024, but softballers still train at PPF.\n\nCollege players come back and train at the facility free of charge. Before Jonathan Miles Jr. (Indianapolis Cardinal Ritter/Ivy Tech Northeast/Dillard University) moved to Florida he worked out at PPF. Sometimes former Indiana Braves players are asked to talk to younger teams to give their perspective on baseball.\n\n“The young guys really look up the old guys,” says Coughlan.\n\nIn July, the Indiana Braves went 2-1 in the 18U Perfect Game National Challenge in Florida.\n\nMany players come back to coach or contribute to the organization.\n\nTommy O’Connor, who Coughlan coached at Mooresville and now plays for the University of Cincinnati, came during winter break last year to help direct Driveline training.\n\n“Developing those guys into respectable young men has been our biggest thing,” says Coughlan.\n\nThe Indiana Braves mission statement is on the team’s website (indianabraves.com). In part, it says: “Teams will work hard to win games, but winning will never become more important than player development. The Braves will ask players to work toward excellence, not perfection.\n\n“Baseball is a fun and challenging game that requires players to develop the ability to overcome mistakes and to look forward to their next opportunity.”"
