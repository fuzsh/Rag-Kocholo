        "text": "Choose a Staff Member:\n\nEdwin Thompson\n\nTitle\n\nHead Coach\n\nEmail\n\nbaseball@georgetown.edu\n\nPhone\n\n202-687-2462\n\nGeorgetown University Francis X. Rienzo Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Lee Reed named Edwin Thompson as the new head coach of the baseball program on Sept. 1, 2020. Thompson came to the Hilltop after spending five seasons as the head coach at Eastern Kentucky University and has 16 years of collegiate coaching experience as well as four years working with USA Baseball. He has recruited and coached 24 All-Americans and 43 players who went on to play professional baseball.\n\nThompson guided the Hoyas into a historic 2022 season that featured the program's first BIG EAST Baseball Championship appearance since 2018, the first BIG EAST Freshman of the Year Owen Carapellotti and the first BIG EAST Coaching Staff of the year following a six-win campaign in 2021. Three Hoyas earned all-conference recognition with Nolan McCarthy earning a unanimous selection to the league's first team while Ethan Stern and Jake Hyde also picked up ABCA / Rawlings All-East Region Team honors on top of their respective first and second team All-BIG EAST selections. Thompson's 2022 team broke the program records for wins (32), home runs (98), total bases (925) and end of season RPI (137) while setting second-best marks in win percentage (.571), runs (400), RBIs (367) and slugging percentage (.480). He also mentored new single-season home run leaders Hyde (19) and Ubaldo Lopez (19) as well as freshman Carapellotti, who garnered Second Team All-America status by D1Baseball.com in his first season with the Hoyas.\n\nThompson guided the Colonels to a 122-123 record over his five seasons, including five wins over top-30 ranked teams. The Hoyas' skipper registered 74 wins over the past two-plus years, including a 12-2 start to 2020 campaign before the season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He led EKU to consecutive 30-win seasons (2018-19) and the Colonels qualified for two-straight Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) Tournaments.\n\nA pair of Colonels earned All-America honors in 2020 and Nick Howie became just the fourth person in OVC history to be chosen as an Academic All-American of the Year in any sport. As a team, EKU was 12th in the nation in batting average (.314) and 15th in scoring (8.4 runs/game).\n\nEastern Kentucky registered 16 conference wins in 2019, the program’s most since 2013. The pitching staff broke the EKU mark for strikeouts in a season for the third straight year and recorded the best team ERA since 2008. Aaron Ochsenbein broke the school’s single-season ERA record with a 0.83 mark and was chosen as an All-American and a finalist for the NCBWA Stopper of the Year Award. He was drafted in the sixth round of the Major League Draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers, the highest-drafted EKU player since 2008.\n\nThe Colonels won 30 games in 2018, finishing five spots higher in the OVC than predicted. Alex Holderbach was selected as an All-American and was the first OVC player ever to be chosen as a finalist for the Johnny Bench Award, given to the nation’s top catcher. He was a semifinalist for the Dick Howser Trophy, given to the best player in the nation.\n\nIn 2017, Thompson helped Ben Fisher earn multiple All-America honors and the OVC Co-Player of the Year Award. Along the way, Fisher broke the program record for home runs in a season, was named national player of the week multiple times and ranked among the top three in the nation in home runs, runs and slugging. He was named the 2017 Academic All-America of the Year, the first EKU student-athlete selected as the Academic All-American for any sport. In Thompson’s first season in 2016, Mandy Alvarez led the nation in hits per game and was named OVC Co-Player of the Year, while Kyle Nowlin broke the program record for home runs and walks in a season.\n\nAcademically, EKU is one of only 13 NCAA Division I baseball programs to earn the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Team Academic Excellence Award each of the last five years. In order to qualify for the award, programs must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. The team won the 2017 OVC Team Academic Achievement Award and the Colonels have had six Academic All-Americans under Thompson. The program has also been active in the community, working closely with Habitat for Humanity, the Cincinnati Reds Urban Youth Academy and Samaritan’s Feet, providing more than 1,000 pairs of shoes for children in need over the past four years.\n\nThompson spent four years working with USA Baseball. His roles included evaluating players for the USA 18U National Team, serving as the pitching coach in 2015 and coaching the 17U National Development Program. In the summer of 2016, he served as the manager of the Stripes team during the USA Baseball 2016 Tournament of Stars.\n\nBefore arriving at Eastern Kentucky, Thompson spent three seasons at Georgia State University, where he served as the pitching coach for the Panthers in 2013 and 2014 before being promoted to recruiting coordinator/defensive coordinator before the 2015 season. His 2015 recruiting class was ranked by Perfect Game as one of the top-100 recruiting classes in the country. The Panthers won at least 30 games in two of his three seasons.\n\nThompson spent the 2011 and 2012 seasons at Duke University as the assistant coach and recruiting coordinator. Following the 2012 campaign, Thompson served as the interim head coach for one month. While working with the Blue Devils, his 2012 recruiting class was recognized by Baseball America as one of the incoming classes in the South and rated among the top-35 in the nation by Perfect Game. The group included four future Major League Baseball draft picks. Thompson worked with a total of 18 players at Duke who would go on to play professional baseball, including current New York Mets All-Star pitcher Marcus Stroman.\n\nPrior to joining the Duke coaching staff, Thompson compiled a 37-33 record in two seasons (2009-10) as the head coach at NCAA Division III Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. His 2010 team went 25-11, setting the school record for wins in a season. Thompson’s coaching career began at the University of Maine at Farmington where he served four seasons (2005-08) as the associate head coach and recruiting coordinator.\n\nThe Jay, Maine native played collegiately at Howard University and the University of Maryland before concluding his career at Webber University in Babson Park, Florida, where he helped the team to a school-record 37 wins and its first-ever regional appearance. He earned a bachelor’s of science degree in general business at Webber in 2003.\n\nThompson played one year for the Bangor Lumberjacks in the independent Northeast League before starting his coaching career. He and his wife have a child together."
