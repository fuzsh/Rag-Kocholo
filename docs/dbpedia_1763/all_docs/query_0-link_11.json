        "text": "Not to be confused with DePaul University.\n\nDePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, USA, is a private, national liberal arts college and School of Music with an enrollment of approximately 2,400 students. The school has a Methodist heritage and was originally known as Indiana Asbury University. DePauw is a member of both the Great Lakes Colleges Association and the North Coast Athletic Conference. The Society of Professional Journalists was founded at DePauw. DePauw is home to both the first modern-day sorority and the two longest continuously-running fraternities in the world.\n\nHistory[]\n\nHistory at a glance Indiana Asbury University Incorporated 1837 Opened 1838 Type co-ed Type changed 1867 Type\n\nco-ed\n\nDePauw University Renamed 1884\n\nIndiana Asbury University was founded in 1837 in Greencastle, Indiana, and was named after Francis Asbury, the first American bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The people of Greencastle raised $25,000, equivalent to around $500,000 in 2007 terms, to entice the Methodists to found the college in Greencastle, which was little more than a village at the time. It was originally established as an all men's school, but began admitting women in 1867.\n\nIn 1884 Indiana Asbury University changed its name to DePauw University in honor of Washington C. DePauw, who made a sequence of substantial donations throughout the 1870s, which culminated in his largest single donation that established the School of Music during 1884.[5] Before his death in 1887, Mr. DePauw donated over $600,000 to Indiana Asbury, equal to around $13 million in 2007. In 2002, the school received the largest-ever gift to a liberal arts college, $128 million by the Holton family. Sigma Delta Chi, known today as the Society of Professional Journalists, was founded at the university in 1909 by a group of student journalists, including Eugene C. Pulliam. The world's first Greek-letter sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, was also founded at DePauw in 1870. DePauw is home to the two longest continually running fraternity chapters in the world, the Delta Chapter of Beta Theta Pi and the Lambda Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta.[6] DePauw is home to Indiana's first chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nDePauw and Liberal Arts Today[]\n\nDePauw University has an enrollment of about 2,400 students. Students hail from 42 states and 32 countries with a 20.4% multicultural enrollment. DePauw's liberal arts education gives students a chance to gain general knowledge outside of their direct area of study. Students are able to do this by taking classes outside of their degrees and engaging in Winter Term classes and trips.\n\nAcademics[]\n\nNational rankings[]\n\nDePauw is ranked in the top tier of national liberal art colleges by U.S. News & World Report as #53 in the United States, and is listed as one of the publication's \"Best Schools, Best Prices.\"[7] The December 2009 issue of Kiplinger's Personal Finance puts DePauw #36 among the \"best values\" in American liberal arts colleges, the only Indiana school so listed. Rankings by the Center for College Affordability & Productivity (CCAP), released in August 2011 by Forbes magazine, place DePauw at #50 among \"America's Best Colleges,\"[8] which includes all universities in the United States. DePauw has consistently ranked as the number one college for Greek life in the nation and for having one of the top-ranked college radio stations in the nation, according to the annual books on \"America's Best Colleges\" published by Princeton Review. DePauw has also been ranked highly for producing Fortune 500 CEOs and doctoral graduates as a percent of total graduates.\n\nAcademic Calendar and Winter Term[]\n\nDePauw University's schedule is divided into a 4-1-4 calendar: besides the 15-week Autumn and Spring Semesters, there is also a 4-week Winter Term. Students take one course during the Winter Term, which is either used as a period for students to explore a subject of interest on campus or participate in off-campus domestic or international internship programs, service trips, or international trips and field studies. One survey of DePauw students found that over 80% of DePauw graduates studied abroad.[9] Past internships for Winter Term include ABC News, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Riley Hospital for Children, and Eli Lily and Company. Past off campus study and service projects include \"The Galapagos: Natural Laboratories for Evolution,\" \"Ghost Ranch: Abiquiu, New Mexico,\" and A Winter-Term In Service Trip that builds an Internet Facility in El Salvador while learning about public health and health care.\n\nFaculty[]\n\nDePauw University has a student-faculty ratio of 10:1 and has no classes with more than 35 students. The average class size is 17. All courses are taught by professors; there are no teaching assistants.\n\nProminent faculty members include:\n\nSunil Sahu, professor of political science and author of Technology Transfer, Dependence, and Self-Reliant Development in the Third World: The Pharmaceutical and Machine Tool Industries in India;\n\nErik Wielenberg, professor of philosophy and author of Value and Virtue in a Godless Universe and God and the Reach of Reason: C. S. Lewis, David Hume, and Bertrand Russell;\n\nSchool of Music[]\n\nDePauw University has one of the oldest private institutions for post-secondary music instructions in the country. Founded in 1884, the school boasts about 170 students who take a rigorous course load toward achieving their goals. Students have the four options for their degrees: a Bachelor of Music in Performance, a selective five-year program that offers a double degree program with a Bachelor of Music Performance and Bachelor of Arts, a Bachelor of Music Education, and a Bachelor of Musical Arts. The teacher to student ratio is 5:1 with an average class size of 13 students. Students in the School of Music interact with their professors through applied lessons, classes, and ensembles.[10]\n\nPrograms of Distinction[]\n\nDePauw students can apply for entry to five Programs of Distinction. They are the Honor Scholars and Information Technology Associates programs and three fellowships in Management, Media, and Science Research.\n\nThe Honor Scholar Program is an interdisciplinary journey for talented students who want the highest level of intellectual rigor. The program includes 5 interdisciplinary seminars and a 80-120 page honor thesis the student's senior year.\n\nManagement Fellows are the top students interested in business and economics. The program includes special seminars, speakers and a paid, semester-long internship during the junior year. Students have interned in private, public, and non-profit sectors. Past internship sites include: Goldman, Sachs & Co., Chicago; Partners in Housing Development Corp., Indianapolis; Ernst & Young Global, New York; Cummins Inc. in India; Independent Purchasing Cooperative, Miami, Florida, and Brunswick Group, an international PR firm based in London.\n\nMedia Fellows benefit from DePauw's media tradition. In addition to interacting with leading contemporary media figures - such as documentary filmmaker Ken Burns and Jane Pauley, who presented Ubben Lectures on campus - students have hands-on access to sophisticated media equipment.[11]\n\nScience Research Fellows use state-of-the-art equipment, work one-on-one with faculty members, participate in internships, make presentations at scientific meetings, publish in scientific journals and, in essence, have graduate-level science opportunities as undergraduates.[11]\n\nStudents participating in the Information Technology Associates Program (ITAP) enjoy an opportunity to link their liberal arts education with technology know-how through on-campus apprenticeships and on- and off-campus internships.[11]\n\nTechnology[]\n\nDePauw University ranked third among the \"Top 50 Most Unwired College Campuses,\"[12] according to a survey which evaluated all institutions of higher learning and their use of wireless technology. The survey was sponsored by Intel Corporation and was printed in the October 17, 2005 edition of U.S. News & World Report. DePauw was also ranked the 3rd most connected school in the United States in a 2004 Princeton Review analysis.\n\nMedia Outlets on Campus[]\n\nThe student radio station (WGRE), was ranked as the #1 college radio station' in 2010 by Princeton Reviews book, \"America's Best Colleges\".\n\nThe student newspaper (The DePauw) is Indiana's oldest college newspaper.\n\n(D3TV) is the campus television station and broadcasts newscasts and student productions.\n\nThe Pulliam Center for Contemporary Media houses all the media facilities and is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nEvery student can be involved in any of the media programs their first semester on campus. The programs at DePauw provide opportunities for all students to learn journalism, production and presentation and management of media outlets.\n\nCampus[]\n\nDePauw University consists of 36 major buildings spread out over a 695 acre (2.7 km²) campus that includes a 520 acre (2.06 km²) nature park, and is located approximately 45 miles (72 km) to the west of Indianapolis, Indiana. There are 11 residence halls, 4 theme houses, and 31 University-owned houses and apartments spread throughout the campus. The oldest building on campus, East College, was built in 1877 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. DePauw also owns McKim Observatory.\n\nEast College[]\n\nA historic structure located at the center of campus, East College is known to many as the architectural symbol of DePauw's tradition of excellence and learning. The cornerstone for the building was laid on October 20, 1871. The building hosted commencement exercises in June 1874, and in September 1875 all college classes were moved to the building, according to the book, DePauw Through the Years. But work on East College continued until 1882, when the building's basement was completed. East College was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\n\nLibraries[]\n\nDePauw has 4 main libraries including Roy O. West Library (main library), Prevo Science Library (located in the Julian Science Center), Visual Resource Center (located in the Peeler Art Center), and Music Library (located in the Green Center for Performing Arts). Library holdings include approximately 350,000 books; 22,000 videos; 1,000 print periodical titles; access to over 20,000 electronic titles; 450,000 government documents; newspapers; and online databases.\n\nJudson and Joyce Green Center for the Performing Arts[]\n\nThe School of Music is housed in the Judson and Joyce Green Center for the Performing Arts, a newly renovated building that was completed in 2008 with a $29 million dollar gift. Also in the building is the Communication and Theater Department. The GCPA has 29 soundproof practice rooms, three performing venues, a music library, teaching studios for large and small ensembles, multiple recording studios, Cafe Allegro, and a $750,000 organ on which students practice and play. Kresge Auditorium seats 1,400 and has a balcony to host big events, speakers, and ensembles. Moore Theater seats 400 and is the stage for musicals and theater productions. Thompson Recital Hall seats 200 and is for small ensembles and chamber music concerts.\n\nCampus life[]\n\nThere are more than 100 organizations on the DePauw campus that students can be involved in. DePauw students also participate in on-campus intramurals, university and student sponsored musical and theatrical productions, and create local chapters of national organizations such as Circle K.\n\nApproximately 70% of DePauw students engage in community service and other volunteer activities[citation needed]. Putnam County Relay For Life, which is organized by students, and brings together the college and community. In May 2006, the Putnam County Relay for Life raised more than $215,000 for the American Cancer Society, and is consistently ranked among the top college-run Relays in the United States[citation needed].\n\nDePauw was named one of The 50 Best Colleges for young women by CosmoGirl magazine in October 2006. This ranking was based upon such factors as small class size, quality of professor instruction, and the strength of alumni networks.\n\nOn August 2, 2010, Princeton Review ranked DePauw as the #10 party school in the US for the 2010-2011 school year, which includes all colleges and universities.[13]\n\nGreek organizations[]\n\nMain article: DePauw University Greek organizations\n\nDePauw's Greek system began just eight years after the founding of Indiana Asbury College in 1837. The Delta Chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity was established here in 1845, Phi Gamma Delta (commonly known as Fiji) in 1856, Sigma Chi in 1859, Phi Kappa Psi in 1865, Delta Kappa Episilon in 1866, Phi Delta Theta in 1868, Delta Tau Delta in 1871, and Delta Upsilon in 1887.\n\nWomen were first admitted to Indiana Asbury in 1867. The first Greek letter fraternity for women soon followed. In January 1870, Kappa Alpha Theta was founded at DePauw as the world's first Greek letter fraternity known among women. Kappa Kapa Gamma established a chapter at DePauw in 1875. Notably, Alpha Chi Omega became the second Alpha Chapter established at DePauw, after Theta, when it was founded here in 1885.\n\nSince their founding, DePauw's Greek organizations have placed a strong emphasis on scholarship and philanthropy, while providing important opportunities to socialize and interact with members of DePauw's diverse community through scheduled projects and social gatherings.\n\nNationally, DePauw's Greek community makes up one of the largest percentages of a college student body.\n\nGreek Life[]\n\nFrom 2003-2008, DePauw University was ranked #1 in \"major fraternity and sorority scene\" by the Princeton Review and has since remained in the top ten. In 2009, U.S. News & World Report ranked DePauw as fourth in the nation for highest percentage of Sorority members (75 percent).[14]\n\nThe Greek community consists of fourteen national social fraternities (eleven of which have houses on campus) and ten sororities (six of which have houses on campus). DePauw has an extensive and substantial Greek history, with both Kappa Alpha Theta, the first Greek-letter organization for women, and Alpha Chi Omega being founded at the school. The Lambda Chapter is the longest continuing chapter of Phi Gamma Delta.\n\nFormal IfC (North-American Interfraternity Conference) and Panhel (National Panhellenic Conference) recruitment for women is held early second semester. Membership intake for National Pan-Hellenic Council organizations (historically black Greek-lettered organizations) usually occurs in the fall and/or the spring. First-year students are not permitted onto fraternity or sorority property for a period of time at the beginning of each school year.\n\nFraternities[]\n\nPhi Gamma Delta\n\nDelta Tau Delta\n\nDelta Upsilon\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha\n\nOmega Psi Phi\n\nKappa Alpha Psi\n\nPhi Beta Sigma\n\nLambda Sigma Upsilon\n\nPhi Delta Theta\n\nBeta Theta Pi\n\nPhi Kappa Psi\n\nSigma Alpha Epsilon\n\nSigma Chi\n\nSigma Nu\n\nAlpha Tau Omega\n\nSororities[]\n\nAlpha Chi Omega\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha\n\nAlpha Phi\n\nDelta Gamma\n\nDelta Sigma Theta\n\nKappa Alpha Theta\n\nKappa Kappa Gamma\n\nOmega Phi Beta\n\nPi Beta Phi\n\nPsi Lambda Xi\n\nSigma Lambda Gamma\n\nZeta Phi Beta\n\nGreek-letter organizations that formerly maintained chapters on DePauw's campus include the fraternities Delta Chi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, and Lambda Chi Alpha, and the sororities Delta Zeta, Delta Delta Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi and Alpha Gamma Delta.\n\nControversy[]\n\nMain article: DePauw University Delta Zeta controversy\n\nIn 2006, the national organization of the Delta Zeta sorority reorganized the DePauw chapter, reducing twenty-three of its thirty-five current members (including the chapter president) to alumna status and giving them six weeks to vacate the sorority house. Of the twelve remaining members, six chose to take alumna status. The Delta Zeta national organization explained that its decisions were based on member commitment, but the evicted members said that they were forced to take alumna status because the chapter members were perceived as physically unattractive and \"brainy\".[15] Subsequently, on Monday, March 12, 2007, DePauw President Robert G. Bottoms announced that the University would sever its ties with Delta Zeta's national organization, effective at the end of the 2006-2007 academic year. President Bottoms was quoted as saying, \"I came to the conclusion that our approaches to these issues are just incompatible.\"[16]\n\nAthletics[]\n\nMain article: DePauw Tigers\n\nThe DePauw Tigers compete in the NCAA Division III North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC). Every year since 1890, DePauw University has competed in American football against its rival Wabash College in what has become the Monon Bell Classic. The traveling trophy, a 300-pound train bell from the Monon Railroad, made its debut in the rivalry in 1932. The DePauw-Wabash series is one of the nation's oldest college football rivalries[citation needed].\n\nIn 1933, head coach Ray \"Gaumey\" Neal led the DePauw Tigers football team to an unbeaten, untied, and unscored opening season. The Tigers compiled a 7-0-0 record and outscored their opponents 136-0. Neal nearly duplicated this feat in 1943, but DePauw, 5-0-1, finished the season with one scoreless tie and six points allowed in a different game. The only points surrendered that season were in a 39-6 victory over Indiana State and the only non-win was a 0-0 tie against Oberlin. The Tigers outscored their opponents, 206-6.\n\nDePauw had been a member of the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference from 1997 to 2011, and won numerous conference championships, most notably in women's basketball, where the school is a Division III power. DePauw's program had also won the conference's overall \"President's Trophy\" seven times in that span, including six consecutive President's Trophies from 2005-06 to 2010-11.[17] In 2007, the Tigers defeated Washington University in St. Louis to win the Division III title in women's basketball. The women's softball team won the regional title, advancing to the Division III College World Series for the first time in school history.\n\nDePauw University's women's golf program is the best of any NCAA Division III college in the nation for students seeking a \"balanced\" experience, according to Golf Digest's third annual College Golf Guide, which appears in the September 2007 issue.\n\nThe DePauw University women's basketball team won the Division III National Championship for the 2006-07 year. They defeated Washington University in Springfield, MA to win the first team national championship in the school's history.\n\nIn 2012-2013, the women's basketball team won its second Division III National Championship with a 69 to 51 victory over the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater, in the title game in Holland, Michigan. The Tigers finished 34-0 on the season, which is the winningest basketball season at the Division III level for men's or women's basketball.\n\nOver the years, DePauw has sent several players to the NFL, including Dave Finzer '82, a punter for the Chicago Bears and Seattle Seahawks, and Greg Werner '89, a tight end for the New York Jets.\n\nTraditions[]\n\nMusic[]\n\nThe DePauw University School of Music, founded in 1884, is one of the oldest in America. The School of Music is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music and it offers various areas of study, including: Woodwinds, Brass, Percussion, Piano/Organ, Strings, Voice, Music Education, and Jazz Studies. A variety of courses and music lessons are made available to students in the College of Liberal Arts.\n\nIt presents regular recitals by students and faculty and concerts by visiting artists, most of which are free and open to the public.\n\nDePauw students also organize concerts for the campus community. Performers in recent years have included Dave Matthews, Train, The Black Eyed Peas, Ben Folds, Rufus Wainwright, and Guster. Past guests have included Billy Joel, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, The Carpenters, America, and Harry Chapin.\n\nSociety of Professional Journalists[]\n\nOn May 6, 1909, Sigma Delta Chi was founded by a group of DePauw University student journalists. The organization officially changed its name to the Society of Professional Journalists in 1988. Today it is the nation's most broad-based journalism organization, encouraging the free practice of journalism and stimulating high standards of ethical behavior. SPJ promotes the free flow of information vital to a well-informed citizenry; works to inspire and educate the next generation of journalists; and protects First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and press. In 2012, SPJ returned to the DePauw campus with the assistance of Eugene S. Pulliam Distinguished Visiting Professor of Journalism Mark Tatge \"[18] \".\n\nDePauw's strong tradition of graduating leaders in the field of journalism continues. Alumni include: \"business journalist of the century\" Bernard Kilgore and his Wall Street Journal colleague Kenneth C. Hogate; Eugene C. Pulliam and Eugene S. Pulliam of the Indianapolis Star and Central Newspapers chain; Donald Maxwell, former editor of the Chicago Tribune; WCVB-TV/Boston news anchor Heather Unruh;[19] Robert Giles, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University and former editor of the Detroit News; John McWethy, ABC News national security correspondent; James B. Stewart, Pulitzer Prize-winning former front page editor of the Wall Street Journal, best-selling author, and currently editor-at-large of SmartMoney magazine; Aaron Lucchetti, staff reporter for the Wall Street Journal; Stephen F. Hayes, senior writer at the Weekly Standard and author of \"Cheney: The Untold Story of America's Most Powerful and Controversial Vice President\"; Meg Kissinger, a reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; and Bret Baier, anchor for Fox News.\n\nRector Scholarships[]\n\nSince 1919, the Rector Scholar Program has recognized DePauw students of exceptional scholarship and character. To be named a Rector Scholar is to join a prestigious tradition more than 4,000 graduates strong. Rector Scholarships are offered to the top academic applicants offered admission to DePauw. A limited number of full tuition Presidential Rector Scholarships are available.\n\nUbben Lecture series[]\n\nEndowed by a gift from Timothy H. and Sharon (Williams) Ubben, both 1958 graduates of DePauw, the speakers' series \"brings the world to Greencastle.\" Begun in 1986 and presented free of charge and open to all, Ubben Lecturers have included Bill Clinton, Benazir Bhutto, Margaret Thatcher, Jane Goodall, Tony Blair, Mikhail Gorbachev, Spike Lee, Paul Bremer, Ralph Nader, Willy Brandt, Robert Gates, Mike Krzyzewski, Harry Belafonte, Carl Bernstein, Gen. Colin Powell, Eric Schlosser, PostSecret founder Frank Warren, John Major, Ross Perot, Shimon Peres, Sister Helen Prejean, Elie Wiesel, F.W. de Klerk, Julian Bond, Peyton Manning, Naomi Wolf, Gen. Wesley Clark, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Ben and Jerry, Greg Mortenson, Bob Woodward, Jim Lovell, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Paul Volcker, David McCullough, Eric Schlosser, Barbara Bush, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Ken Burns, Paul Rusesabagina (the real-life hero of Hotel Rwanda), William Bennett, Alan Simpson, biologist E.O. Wilson, director and screenwriter Jason Reitman, author Mitch Albom, Barack Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, musician and innovator Todd Rundgren, Liz Murray (Homeless to Harvard), a debate between Howard Dean and Karl Rove, veteran journalist Jane Pauley, Nobel laureate Oscar Arias, author Rebecca Skloot (The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks), journalist Candy Crowley, veteran statesman Lee H. Hamilton (a 1952 DePauw graduate), 2011 Nobel Peace Prize winner Leymah Gbowee, and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and technology critic Nicholas Carr, who engaged in a debate on the impact of technology. The Ubben Series has hosted nearly 100 speakers in its 27-year history.\n\nMonon Bell Classic[]\n\nSee also: Monon Bell Classic\n\nVoted \"Indiana's Best College Sports Rivalry\" by viewers of ESPN in 2005, DePauw University and Wabash College play each November—in the last regular season football game of the year for both teams—for the right to keep or reclaim the Monon Bell. The two teams first met in 1890. In 1932, the Monon Railroad donated its approximately 300-pound locomotive bell to be offered as the prize to the winning team each year. The series is as close as a historic rivalry can be: by virtue of winning the 116th game on November 14, 2009, Wabash leads the all-time series, 57-53-9; since the Monon Bell was introduced, Wabash leads 38-37-6. The game routinely sells out (up to 11,000 seats, depending upon the venue and seating arrangement) and has been televised by ABC, ESPN2, and HDNet (where it has appeared for the past seven years, 2006–2012). Each year, alumni from both schools gather at more than 60 locations around the United States for telecast parties, and a commemorative DVD (including historic clips known as \"Monon Memories\") is produced (there are discs of the 1977, 1994 and 2000-2012 games).\n\nIn 1999, GQ listed the Monon Bell game as reason #3 on its \"50 Reasons Why College Football is Better Than Pro Football\" list.\n\nLittle 5 Bike Race[]\n\nHeld in late April every year, DePauw's Little 5 bike race has been a campus tradition since the first race in 1956. The first race was sponsored by Union Board as a fund raiser for the American Cancer Fund. Fourteen teams of male riders from various living units competed. The race has changed some since 1956 as a criterium style scoring system has been put into effect. Individual cyclists compete in a week-long series of events, including Time Trials, Street Sprints, and the actual Little 5 Bicycle race. Composite scores for each individual rider and their respective teams determine individual, as well as team champions. Today, in addition to the men's events, women compete in the same series of competitive events. As recently as 2010, the race was held at Blackstock Stadium. However, in 2011 Little 5 events have shifted focus campus. The race is currently held on DePauw University's streets encircling the GCPA and Julian Science and Mathematics Center.\n\nBoulder Run[]\n\nThe Boulder Run has become a tradition at DePauw University. Students, streaking from their respective residences, run to and from the Columbia Boulder, located in the center of the campus near the East College building. Students today perform the Boulder Run for a variety of reasons, though it was originally performed on the day or night of the first snowfall on campus by Phi Kappa Psi, the Greek house nearest the boulder. This tradition was mentioned in Playboy magazine's September 1972 issue. The DePauw police are usually tolerant of the tradition, but students have been ticketed when caught.\n\nCampus Golf[]\n\nIt is not unusual to see students playing a game of Campus Golf when the weather is nice. The game of campus golf requires a golf club and a tennis ball. Players attempt to hit their golf ball against various targets on campus within a number of strokes. The game is similar to frisbee golf, where players attempt to hit targets ranging from trees to buildings with a frisbee.\n\nWhile playing campus golf, students often wear traditional golf attire, including plaid pants, shirts and sweaters. Many living units have established \"courses\" which are played by residents.\n\nMarvin's[]\n\nMarvin's is a small restaurant serving mainly American food such as hamburgers and fries.
