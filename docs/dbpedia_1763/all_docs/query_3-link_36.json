Smith came to Statesboro after a season in the highly competitive Southeastern Conference as Auburn’s director of player personnel.\n\nBefore his time at Auburn, Smith had stints working under Mack Brown at North Carolina in the Atlantic Coast Conference and Gus Malzahn at Auburn in the SEC. He was an offensive recruiting analyst with the Tar Heels for two seasons and spent the 2018 season as a personnel and operations assistant at Auburn.\n\nDuring his time at UNC, Smith assisted in the recruiting needs of the Tar Heels’ offensive coaching staff, helping manage film, evaluations and information on prospects. He also helped with on-campus visits and arranged recruiting travel plans for UNC’s offensive assistants. While on staff, the Tar Heels landed back-to-back top-15 signing classes. UNC’s 2020 class ranked 13th nationally in the 247Sports Composite rankings, while the 2021 group finished 14th.\n\nA 2015 graduate of Baylor, Smith began his career in 2017 at Angelo State, a Division II program, as an offensive quality control coach while also assisting with the program’s quarterbacks. He then joined Malzahn’s staff at Auburn the following season."
