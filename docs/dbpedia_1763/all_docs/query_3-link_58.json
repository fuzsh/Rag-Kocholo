        "text": "1964-68\n\nBasketball\n\n‘68\n\nHe has made his mark both as a player and coach in basketball. From 1964 through 1968, “Sumthin” Smith, as he was known to Akron basketball fans, finished his career with a total of 1,437 points ranking him fourth, at the time, among all-time UA cage greats. The 5-9 guard, who was a starter all four years, helped the Zips compile a 79-28 record during his career. Smith set a scoring record of 371 points as a freshman and was instrumental in guiding UA to Ohio Conference and NCAA Mideast Regional Championships and subsequent trips to the NCAA College Division Championship in 1965 and ’66. He became the third player off those two teams to become Hall of Famers—joining Bill Turner and Don Williams to both the UA and Summit County Sports Hall of Fames. He capped off his athletic career by being named UA’s co-Athlete of the Year for 1967-68. After graduating, Smith became head coach at Norton High School where his teams won 38 and lost 21. It was, however, at Akron South where Bobby had his greatest success—winning two City Championships and earning regional runner-up honors twice while compiling 112-42 record. In 1976 he was the Northeast Ohio Coach-of-the-Year honors. He also coached at Akron East."
