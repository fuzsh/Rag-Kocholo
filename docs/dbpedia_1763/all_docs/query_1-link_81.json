        "text": "Golden Bears Honor Convocation 2024\n\nOn Thursday, May 16th, Catholic High School hosted its annual Golden Bear Honors Convocation to recognize many of the students who have honored Catholic High School through their outstanding performance during the past four or five years. Characteristics of such performance are determined by diligence in the classroom, perseverance on the field of play, fellowship among classmates charity through serving those in need, and integrity and kindness in all that they do. We gave special recognition to those students who have contributed so much toward making this year a memorable one.\n\nWe are honored to announce that Luke Dawson earned the title of Valedictorian for the Class of 2024. Jackson Whitlow is the Salutatorian.\n\nAdler Rice is the Outstanding Graduate for the Class of 2024. Adler also received The American Legion Award.\n\nWilliam Busenlener was the Service Award Recipient.\n\nBrooks Wright received the Student-Athlete Award.\n\nEighty-five members of the CHS Class of 2024 are graduating with the Louisiana Seal of Biliteracy! This is an award given out by the state of Louisiana to students who have completed four years of foreign language and have achieved a minimum ACT score in both English and reading. Seniors were presented certificates by their foreign language teachers. We are very proud of the seniors who qualified for this award."
