        "text": "Follow @JonScheyer\n\nBio updated June 2024\n\nFormer Duke All-American and two-time team captain Jon Scheyer was named the 20th head coach in Duke University’s storied basketball history on June 4, 2021. He succeeded Hall of Fame head coach Mike Krzyzewski, who announced in June 2021 his plan to retire following the 2021-22 season.\n\nScheyer, who enters his third season as head coach in 2024-25, has vast experience on the Duke bench, having served on Krzyzewski’s staff since the 2013-14 season. His previous roles with the Blue Devils include special assistant, assistant coach and the previous three years as associate head coach. Scheyer and Duke agreed to a new six-year contract in October of 2023, extending him through the 2028-29 season.\n\nThe 35-year-old Scheyer was among the youngest head coaches in Division-I men’s basketball, and the youngest at a power conference institution, at the time of his hire. He was named to The Athletic’s 40 Under 40 in college sports in 2022 and was previously touted as one of the best assistant coaches in college basketball.\n\nRecord-Setting Debut Season as Head Coach\n\nLeading the Blue Devils to a 27-9 mark in his first season, Duke captured the ACC Tournament title and went undefeated at home as Scheyer became the first coach in the conference’s storied history to post an undefeated home record in a debut season and the first to lead a team to an ACC title as both a player (2009, 2010) and as a head coach (2023).\n\nHe is just the fourth major conference coach all-time to win 27 or more games at age 50 or younger in a debut season and the first to do so at 35 or younger. In Division I history, only seven other coaches younger than 35 years old have won more games in a debut season.\n\nPlaying its best basketball as the season progressed, Scheyer’s first squad carried a nine-game winning streak into the program’s 45th NCAA Tournament, the fourth longest winning streak entering the NCAA Tournament in program history. The Blue Devils stretched the winning streak to 10 with a dominant first-round win.\n\nOvercoming a season plagued by injuries and with one of the nation’s youngest teams that returned just one starter from the 2022 Final Four run, Scheyer’s squad was 19-1 with its full roster available. With an emphasis on defense and rebounding, the Blue Devils ranked top-20 in nearly every rebounding statistic and were top 30 defensively.\n\nScheyer was named a finalist for the Joe B. Hall Coach of the Year Award, presented annually to the best first-year coach in college basketball.\n\nIn his 14 seasons as player and coach at Duke, Scheyer has been part of two National Championships (2010, 2015), three Final Fours (2010, 2015, 2022), five ACC Tournament crowns (2009, 2010, 2017, 2019, 2023), while averaging 27.6 wins per season with a winning percentage of .780 (387-109).\n\nContinuing to Make History in Second Season\n\nIn his second campaign as Duke men's basketball head coach, Scheyer continued to build upon his historic debut, guiding the 2023-24 Blue Devils to a 27-9 record for the second consecutive year, finishing second in the ACC standings with a 15-5 league mark and advancing to the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight. Duke was ranked inside the top-25 for the entirety of the 2023-24 season, concluding at No. 9 in the final Associated Press poll.\n\nScheyer led the team to three victories over opponents ranked in the top-25, with wins over No. 18 Michigan State, No. 10 Baylor and No. 2 Houston, and advanced to the NCAA Tournament as a top-five seed for the second straight season. Competing as a No. 5 seed during the 2023 postseason, the Blue Devils secured a No. 4 seed for this year's March Madness. On March 29, Duke defeated Houston, 54-51, in the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 for the Blue Devils' 10th all-time win over a No. 1 seed and their first since beating Wisconsin, 68-63, in the 2015 national championship game, during Scheyer's nine-year tenure as an assistant coach.\n\nThe win over Houston, ranked No. 2 in the AP poll at the time, propelled the Blue Devils to their 24th trip to the Elite Eight and marked Duke's first win over a top-5 team since defeating No. 1 Gonzaga, 84-81, on Nov. 26, 2021, in Las Vegas.\n\nAmong Duke head coaches in their first two seasons, Scheyer posted the most overall wins (54), most conference wins (29) and the most NCAA Tournament wins (4). Scheyer's overall win percentage (.750) through his first two seasons is the best since Eddie Cameron in 1928-30 (.750/30-10), and his conference win percentage (.725) is the best since Harold Bradley in 1950-52 (.743).\n\nScheyer also became Duke's fastest head coach to reach the 50-win milestone, doing so in 65 games, bettering the standard set by Vic Bubas, who hit 50 wins in 69 contests from 1959-62.\n\nIn addition, Scheyer is just the third men's basketball head coach in ACC history to lead his program to a conference tournament title and an NCAA Elite Eight appearance in his first two seasons, joining Bill Guthridge (North Carolina, 1998) and fellow Blue Devils coach, Vic Bubas (1960).\n\nRecruiting and Developing the Nation’s Best\n\nThe Northbrook, Ill., native has been integral in the recruiting and development of several young Duke stars since joining the staff. In accepting Duke’s head-coaching position a year before taking the helm, Scheyer was able to fully recruit the nation’s No. 1-ranked freshman class for the 2022-23 campaign -- highlighted by the top two-ranked players -- Dereck Lively II and Dariq Whitehead. He followed that by landing the No. 2 overall class in 2023-24 class with four top-25 signees, then moved back to the top of the rankings in 2024 with six recruits inside the top 30, including the No. 1 overall prospect, Cooper Flagg.\n\nDuke has finished top three in ESPN.com’s class recruiting rankings every season with Scheyer on the staff, including the No. 1 class six times (2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2022, 2024).\n\nA total of 30 Duke players have been drafted, including 23 first-rounders, with Scheyer on the staff, highlighted by overall No. 1 selections Zion Williamson in 2019 and Paolo Banchero in 2022. Williamson was the consensus National Player of the Year in 2019, while Banchero was an All-American and ACC Rookie of the Year in 2022. His first draftees as a head coach -- Lively and Whitehead -- were each first-round picks in 2023, followed by first-round selection Jared McCain in 2024.\n\nWilliamson and Banchero join six other Scheyer-coached Blue Devils to be named ACC Rookie of the Year, including Kyle Filipowski in 2022-23 – Scheyer’s first commitment in the 2022-23 class, who chose to wear the No. 30 in honor of his first-year head coach.\n\nScheyer helped mentor Tyus Jones to Final Four Most Outstanding Player honors and an NBA first-round pick in 2015. Five years later, Tyus’ brother Tre was named both the ACC Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year after a remarkable 2020 campaign.\n\nTre is one of 12 to earn All-America recognition with Scheyer on staff – a list that also includes Quinn Cook, Grayson Allen, Luke Kennard, RJ Barrett, Williamson, Banchero and Filipowski.\n\nAllen finished his remarkable four-year career in 2018 as the 12th-leading scorer in Duke history with 1,996 points and joined Scheyer as two of just five Blue Devils in history with 1,900 or more points, 400 or more rebounds and 400 or more assists (Grant Hill, Danny Ferry, Johnny Dawkins).\n\nAmong Duke’s Winningest Players\n\nAs a player, Scheyer was one of the most versatile and reliable Blue Devils all-time, concluding his career as the only player in school history to record at least 2,000 points, 500 rebounds, 400 assists, 250 three-point field goals and 200 steals. He averaged 14.4 points per game while scoring in double figures 114 times (sixth-most in Duke history) and leading the Blue Devils to a 115-29 (.799) record.\n\nA two-time team captain, Scheyer scored 2,077-career points and still ranks 10th on Duke’s all-time scoring list. He ranks third in Duke history in free throws made (608), fourth in free throw percentage (.861; 10th in ACC history) and three-point field goals made (297; 13th in ACC history) and sixth in free throw attempts (706). He played in 144 consecutive games, tied for the second-longest streak in Duke history, while his 4,459 minutes played rank fourth in ACC history.\n\nAs a senior in 2010, Scheyer averaged 18.2 points, 4.9 assists and 1.6 steals per game from the point guard position to spark Duke to a 35-5 record and its fourth national championship. He was a consensus second-team All-American and a first-team All-ACC pick in his final season after starting all 40 contests and scoring in double figures in all but two games on the year. His 1,470 minutes played as a senior remains the ACC single-season record.\n\nScheyer was named MVP of the ACC Tournament as a junior in 2009, averaging 21.7 points and 4.0 rebounds as Duke took home the title.\n\nBefore Duke\n\nHe was a McDonald’s and Parade All-American as a senior at Glenbrook North High School in 2006. Already recognized as an elite scorer, his legend grew when he scored 21 points in 75 seconds at the Proviso West Holiday Tournament as a senior. He closed his career as the fourth-leading scorer in Illinois high school basketball history with 3,034 points. He is the only player in Illinois history to rank in the state’s career top 10 in points, assists and steals.\n\nA two-time Gatorade Illinois Player of the Year, Scheyer was named to the 100 Legends of Illinois Basketball in 2007.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Duke in 2010, Scheyer played professionally with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers in the NBA D League and overseas with Maccabi Tel Aviv and Gran Canaria.\n\nPersonal\n\nScheyer married his wife Marcelle in May 2017. The couple have three young children, a girl named Noa (born January 2018), and boys Jett (August 2019) and James (May 2022).\n\nTaking an active role in the Durham community, he and Marcelle began the Scheyer Kid Captain program in 2022-23. The program provides a connection between the Duke Basketball program and the life-saving work performed daily at Duke Children’s – one of the nation’s leading children’s hospitals – by inviting a patient and family from Duke Children’s to spend a game day with the team, attend practice and sit behind the bench.\n\nJON SCHEYER FACTS\n\nBirthdate: August 24, 1987\n\nHigh School: Glenbrook North, Northbrook, Ill.\n\nCollege Career: Four-year letterman, Duke, 2007-2010\n\nCollege Degree: B.A., History, Duke, 2010\n\nCollege Honors: Co-captain, 2009, 2010; Consensus Second Team All-America, 2010; All-NCAA Final Four Team, 2010; First Team All-ACC, 2010; NCAA Tournament All-South Region, 2010; ACC Tournament MVP, 2009; All-Preseason NIT, 2009; First Team ACC All-Tournament, 2009, 2010\n\nCoaching Career: Special Assistant, Duke, 2013-14; Assistant Coach, Duke, 2014-18; Associate Head Coach, Duke, 2018-22; Head Coach, Duke, 2022-present\n\nFamily: Wife, Marcelle (married May 2017); Children, Noa (born January 2018), Jett (born August 2019) and James (born May 2022)\n\nWHAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT JON SCHEYER\n\n“I’ve said many times that Jon Scheyer is one of the smartest coaches in the country.
