        "text": "Coach,\n\nEven though I’ve never been on a football field for a single snap, somehow I got an invitation to participate in this football tribute. I wouldn’t ever pass up the opportunity to let you know of the immense impact you’ve had in my life. So, I’m grateful for the chance.\n\nAside from my parents, nobody has had a more profound influence than you. You got my dad the job at East Catholic before I was even born for God’s sakes! Seriously, you’ve been there for me every step of the way. I wouldn’t be the head coach at UConn without you. I wouldn’t have played at UConn either. You are responsible for much of my success professionally.\n\nMore poignantly, you’re responsible in large part for the man I’ve become. Your lessons remain prevalent in my life…\n\n“If you see something you don’t agree with, and you don’t acknowledge it, that means you accept it.”\n\n“When you cut somebody remember, he is somebody’s son. Treat him as such.”\n\n“Nice try vs. nice play.”\n\n“Debits and credits.”\n\n“Can’t worry about what you can’t control.”\n\n“Third and one is the same as 3 and 2, bases loaded.”\n\nThere isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about how you would handle a situation. And, I truly want to honor you with all I do as your successor. You really do have big shoes to fill!\n\nI pray that I will have half as positive an impact that you’ve had in your life. The number of people you’ve positively touched is impossible to equal. I once thought an effective person must make enemies. I no longer believe that, because you’ve never made one.\n\nI’m grateful you are still in my life and so happy your football family is appropriately honoring you. All those whom you’ve touched owe you a debt of gratitude. You’ve given us a model of a man whose faith and family are at the center of his life and the golden rule is how you lead. We are all proud to follow. God bless you Coach Baylock.\n\nLove,\n\nJim Penders\n\nDear Coach Baylock,\n\nYou can’t say UConn without thinking about YOU! As a former Husky softball student-athlete and assistant coach I cherished our interactions. Your humor, kindness and welcoming smile were always present. Your wisdom and anecdotes were always appreciated and I learned so much from you as a young assistant coach.\n\nThank you for your loyalty, dedication and unwavering support of UConn and all of the people that have been lucky enough to be a part of your life.\n\nLove, Pat Conlan\n\nCoach B!\n\nYou are the definition of consistency. The way you find ways to connect with everyone you come in contact with is amazing to see. You’ve always been supportive and an outstanding ambassador for our entire sports performance department. I have so much respect for you and appreciate all of your support over the years. Our student-athletes and coaches are so fortunate to have you as a resource. Your wisdom and dedication is unmatched in college athletics. Thank you for all you do, Coach Baylock!\n\n-Matt King\n\nCoach you are one of a kind.\n\nWe could search the world and never find an individual that represents so many roles with the class, character, humility, humor, and loyalty that you display.\n\nYou treated me, Karen and my children with love, respect and true friendship and you will forever be a very special part of our family. UConn will always hold a special place in our heart.\n\nThanks, Coach for making it an honor to ever be a part of the Husky nation.\n\n-TJ Weist\n\nAndy Baylock, not just the pride of UConn Football and Baseball, not just the pride of UConn…the pride of the entire STATE OF CONNECTICUT!\n\nForever on the Mount Rushmore of UConn!\n\nI am proud to know you and honored to be your friend.\n\nCongratulations on a lifetime of hard work and success.\n\n-Dan Toscano\n\n“We all appreciate the commitment and contributions Andy has made and continues to make to this University and all of the Student-Athletes…he’s something very, very special. I am so happy we are finally honoring him, now we need to win for him! “\n\nJim Mora\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nAs I sit back and think about how I could honor you, I know that words cannot express how grateful I am to have you in my life. When I came to UConn in 2007, you showed me what it meant to be a UConn Husky. From having dinner with your family and the players that made the 3.0 gpa list my freshman year (unfortunately that was my only time haha), to riding with you to go speak at local elementary schools, I will never forget our conversations. Anywhere you go around the country everyone knows Coach Baylock! It speaks volumes to who you are as a person and the impact you’ve made and will continue to make on many people.\n\nThank you for inspiring me and showing me how to be a real Coach/Leader. See you soon!\n\nLove you,\n\nKashif Moore\n\nCoach,\n\nNot for nothing but I’ve known you for 40 years and safe to say you’re the same guy today that you were then. Generous with your time, considerate of others, a teacher extraordinaire and the kindest human being in the state of Connecticut.\n\nBaseball was your sport but life is what you’re best suited for and no one loves life more than you. I wish I had taken your advice and thrown batting practice and taken some swings. I would’ve learned more from you on how to teach, coach, touch and love people.\n\nThank you Andy, for making UConn special.\n\nYour friend, Geno Auriemma\n\nAndy Baylock,\n\nYou are Mr. Connecticut. From the teams you coached, to all the others you supported, you are the enduring face of UConn Athletics. Your love and connection to so many student athletes is something I have always marveled at. You represent the best of all us Huskies and we are so lucky to have you.\n\n-Jim Calhoun\n\nDear Andy,\n\nI’m so glad they’re taking the time to honor you at the football game. You have impacted so many lives and helped carve a path for so many. When I first arrived at UConn at the age of 25, you immediately became a father figure to me. It was an intimidating time, and you always had a nice pep talk to keep me on track. I remember our many talks in my office, it was nice to know I could always turn to you for guidance, no matter what the situation was! You supported me as a Head Coach who was also raising a family and for that I am forever grateful. I smile every time I get to see and talk to you at an event. You truly are a legend and UConn is so lucky to have you.\n\nLove you! Enjoy your special day!\n\n-Jen Sanford\n\nI worked with Andy for 37 years, and the first thing that comes to my mind is that he has been the “Mentor of Mentors”. I didn’t ask to talk to Andy when I first came to UConn to coach the Track and Cross Country teams, he basically told me to come to his office the first week I was on the job as a 29 year old Head Coach. When I left his office that day, I had a friend for life, a confidant, a cheerleader and an inspirational character who never let me down. A MENTOR. Open and honest, he always shared his thoughts, his coaching techniques and his feelings. Over the years I can’t even imagine how many other “Mentors” he has impacted. I just know that this Mentor could never have been the Coach that I became without the friendship and guidance provided by the Master of the Mentors, Coach Baylock!!\n\nGreg Roy\n\nHead Coach(retired)\n\nUConn Track and Field/XC\n\nDear Coach Baylock,\n\nYou have been a great blessing in my life. Your guidance, mentoring and support through the years has meant the world to me. You were always in my corner sharing your ideas, wisdom and a friendly hug when things were challenging. Thank you for the “grand slam” influence you have had in my life!\n\n-K. Mullins\n\nNobody bleeds blue more than you, Coach Baylock. Your constant presence and contributions behind the scenes for the football program did not go unnoticed. Your positive attitude and the ability to make everyone feel welcome are just a few of the qualities that make you special.\n\nEvery team needs a guy like you, Coach Baylock – we were fortunate to have you.\n\nRandy Edsall\n\nNo doubt who “Mr. UCONN” is. Congrats on an impactful, storied, impressive and renowned career with many years ahead. It has been a joy to know you Andy.\n\nWish you the best of everything!\n\n-Bob and Alyce Goldberg\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nYou are in the same category with Jim Calhoun, Geno Auriemma, and Joe Morrone. Your fingerprints are all over the UConn baseball and football programs. You have touched countless student-athletes lives and many, many coaches. Coach Baylock, thank you for all you’ve done for UCONN.\n\n-Ray Reid\n\nCoach,\n\nCongratulations to you for your OUTSTANDING Career at UConn! You have been so much to me as a mentor, a colleague, but most importantly you have been a good friend.\n\nThank you for your commitment and dedication to UConn Athletics, and the entire University of Connecticut community. You make it family!\n\nGo Huskies! Jim Donohue\n\nCoach B,\n\nOver the last 15 years of me working with football, you have always checked in and offered to help. You have helped so many of the guys with internship opportunities and guidance that I know they will look back one day and be grateful. I have always enjoyed our quick chats and appreciate the support you have given to SASP each year with new incoming students and those graduating. UCONN is lucky to have you around for all the years with your knowledge and wisdom.\n\nBest,\n\nKelli Kozaryn\n\nSASP Football Counselor\n\nCoach,\n\nFor the last 24 years I have had the opportunity to watch your commitment and impact on your student athletes, alumni, the athletics staff and the local community. You bleed blue through and through and it’s inspiring. I am so thankful for your willingness to stop, say hi and share a story. As a student you spoke in one of my classes and it has left a lasting impression on me for the standards and passion for the coaching profession and always giving back. Thank you for all you have done not only as a coach, but as a great human being. “Not bad for an old guy”.\n\nWith much respect,\n\nMoe Butler ’03\n\nSports Performance\n\nDear Coach,\n\nWhile the entirety of sport is amazing and fills life with memories, there are a few special moments that stand out differently from the rest.\n\nSometime around April of 2007 or so, you pulled me aside after a CPIA awards dinner in the Rome ballroom after I had the opportunity to present a couple of awards to student-athletes in my cohort. You complimented my messaging and emphasized the importance of showing genuine care for our student-athletes.\n\nThat may have been the first time we spoke. I was early in my career, still holding onto my 20s for dear life, and I didn’t know much about anything. I knew immediately, however, that your words would stay with me forever.\n\nYou didn’t have to take time out of your night to do that, and I was genuinely honored… and a little starstruck. We hadn’t really interacted before, and you were THE Coach Andy Baylock everyone talked about; the one everyone respected, the one everyone knew cared about them.\n\nYour endless value of people, education, growth, kindness, and sending these young Huskies into the world one day ready to bring good is all that is fundamentally right about college sport.\n\nI am grateful beyond measure that our paths have crossed so many times over the last nearly 17 years. When I see you, I instantly remember what’s really important. I know it’s about the people, about the kids, about sincerity, about love for what you do and love for the folks around you. I know that it’s about family, and honor, and authenticity….. and then celebrating the victories along the way isn’t so bad either.\n\nCoach, thank you for everything you bring to every seemingly little moment. I promise you, those moments are huge.\n\nLove,\n\nAlana Butler\n\nUConn (Field Hockey) ‘01 & Student Athlete Success Program\n\nAndy,\n\nThanks for everything you have meant to me over the years and everything you have done for UConn during your career. From being your baseball SID back in the 80s and 90s, to your work in football now, you have always been there for me. You are a trusted mentor and friend.\n\n-Mike Enright ’88\n\nWhen I first got to UConn ten years ago after 18 years at Boston College, there were two people who made my transition seamless: Dee Rowe and Andy Baylock. I will never forget how Andy made me feel welcome & wanted. I’ve always been impressed with how he’s not only committed to seeing me succeed, but every sport be successful at UConn.\n\nThank you Coach for being a great mentor and I’m still waiting to take batting practice off you!\n\n-Mike Cavanaugh\n\nDear Coach,\n\nI am so blessed that you and I once had offices next door to each other, I loved the many talks we used to have. You have impacted so many lives including mine and you always have such a positive outlook and attitude on life! I know you don’t like attention brought to you, I am so happy you are going to be honored at the football game. You so deserve it. We are so lucky to have you as part of UConn Athletics. You are truly a LEGEND Coach….Love you!\n\nKim Gedney\n\nCoach Bayls ….. I’m pleased to be one of sooo many others that get to honor you today with a very loud message of respect, caring, love and enduring faith that your many marks at UConn will live on forever…..starting way back when in your career with UCONN Football as an able Assistant Coach….then onto UCONN Baseball as an Assistant and then many years as that sport’s Head Coach, then back to Football as the rallying Assistant for getting the Alumni to be present and active in the growth of a program that has a rich history and is now rebuilding for a future of success…but all of these Athletic moments are properly underscored with well earned Academic success, the equal of very few in the entire NCAA….Bayls, you ARE UConn, and UConn is YOU….Enough said….I love you, my brother.\n\nRespectfully submitted by former UCONN Athletics Director, Paul Pendergast\n\nHi Coach.\n\nCongratulations on being honored by UConn at tonight’s football game. You are absolutely amazing! Along with your long-time buddy, Coach Rowe, there is no one that has been as terrific an ambassador for UConn Athletics as you. For 60 years you have represented Husky Nation with CLASS and INTEGRITY, and have influenced thousands of student athletes along the way, from UConn Football, UConn Baseball, the Cape Cod League, the U.S. Baseball teams, the Detroit Tigers’ minor league team in Norwich, and still to this day, the baseball student-athletes at Eastern. Along with your “rubber arm” you have a heart of gold, always caring about the young men and their families you come in contact with, and continue to be part of their lives.\n\nPersonally, thank you being that buffer, that sounding board, for me and others during our years in Storrs. Your encouragement and that arm around the shoulder got many of us through some tough times….and you were always there.\n\nYou are so deserving of this and any honor you receive. Your hard work, commitment to excellence, and unwavering loyalty to UConn has without question stood the test of time. Thank you, and God Bless.\n\n-Randy LaVigne\n\nIt is hard to imagine someone making their mark on a school and its student/athletes more than you, Coach. It’s not just what you did with the football and baseball programs, it’s how you did it.\n\nYou were always classy, genuine, and present. I greatly enjoyed your company on the UConn Football bus rides and road trips. I could listen to your stories all day long.\n\nThanks for your friendship and all that you’ve done to make the people around you feel special. You are a Connecticut treasure!\n\nAll my Best,\n\nKevin Nathan\n\n(Former UConn Football reporter)\n\nNo one deserves to be honored more than Coach B. A legend at UConn but more importantly a legendary person. Congrats Coach!\n\n-Joe D’Ambrosio\n\nAndy\n\nMany thanks for a terrific Husky career, from a guy who has bled UConn Blue for a long time, to one who has bled Husky Blue even longer.\n\nWayne Norman\n\nUConn Sports Network and morning host on WILI-AM\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nYou are truly a gem. Since meeting you, you’ve made Ja’Miya and I feel right at home. You welcomed us and it felt like we’d known you forever. You have such a kind and selfless spirit and it’s no wonder everyone speaks so highly of you. I want to take this time to say thank you for the work you’ve done both on and off the field. Job well done.\n\n-With Love,\n\nDaneisha and Ja’Miya\n\nDear Coach Baylock,\n\nHaving attended an American high school in Germany, I met you first on campus when the freshman team reported in 1969. Aside from your reassuring ways, what I remember most was your no-nonsense approach to academics. You helped me register for the same kinds of classes as all incoming students, implicitly emphasizing that I was there to be educated. Your letter to the parents of incoming players bespoke a commitment to education and the ideals of sport: to develop character through shared sacrifice and self-discipline in order to prepare for life. While my athletic contributions were limited, the discipline I learned by facing adversity and by finishing what I started has helped me greatly in achieving other goals over the years.\n\nEvery time I see you, I remind you that I feel like an imposter on alumni rolls because I only played freshman ball and scarcely saw the field, yet you always make me feel a part of the team.\n\nAs a college professor for more than four decades at a university that invests heavily in its football program, I have long lamented the absence of those values that you first instilled in us. A letter from a football coach to his players extolling the virtues of reading would simply be unheard of on campuses today. We were lucky to be under your tutelage, Coach. Many thanks for the lessons you taught.\n\nDonald Dickson ’73 (freshman team, ’69), Ph.D., FRHistS\n\nProfessor of English, Texas A&M University\n\nCoach,\n\nI can never thank you for all you have done for me and my family over the years. In August of 1970 I entered into your freshman program along with 120 other players. At that time I had no idea how much you would do for me over the next 50 plus years. You have been a coach, teacher, mentor, colleague, advisor, and most of all a valued friend. You have been an inspiration to so many and helped guide me into the person I am today. There are so many memories and so many values you have given to me. I have been so blessed to have you in my life and my family, and I love you for enriching our lives.\n\nLove, Brian, Kathy, Brian Jr and Beth Usher\n\nCoach,\n\nYou have been a great inspiration from my first days with you as a “Husky Pup,” through my varsity career. Your ability to remember all former players and keep in contact is truly amazing, as is your dedication to the UConn football program. It’s always a pleasure to hear from you!\n\nThe University of Connecticut, and all players who have experienced playing for you, are extremely fortunate to have had you as a coach, friend, and loving, caring person. Thank you, Coach!\n\nWith utmost respect,\n\nGeorge Kupfrian, 1968\n\nWhen I arrived on campus in Storrs in the fall of 2006 it was only the second time I’d ever been to the State of Connecticut. The first was during freshman orientation. While I visited the football facilities and met some of the coaches and staff during orientation, I didn’t earn a roster spot as a walk-on until a few weeks later. When I did, Rasool Ahmed made sure that I knew who you were. As a walk-on from Kansas City, Missouri, there wasn’t a ton of incentive for you to be so engaged in my experience as a football player at the University of Connecticut, but you were. Whether it was chatting about Rasool, Kansas City bbq, or even my girlfriend at Seton Hall who you’d heard about because one of your friends was in their athletic department and she worked for the basketball team, you managed to maintain a relationship with a young man who wasn’t on scholarship, from halfway across the country. The lesson in your experience at UConn is that people and relationships are the most valuable things we can possess. I took the lesson to heart, and my career in government affairs and lobbying has been the direct result of valuing people and fostering those relationships. For that, I say, “Thank you.” The last time we were able to catch up, you gave me a tour of the new UConn campus with a developed downtown, bus depot, and more restaurants during my era. When I see you again, it will be to congratulate you on all your achievements at the home opener on August 31st. I’ll end this letter with a couple of quotes that apply to your impact on me and the University of Connecticut.\n\n“You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him.” – Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\n“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” – Maya Angelou\n\nCongratulations. You’ve done well. You deserve all the recognition you receive.\n\nBleed Blue,\n\nJoss Tillard-Gates\n\nFootball 06\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nThank you for all that you have done and still do for UConn nation. Your commitment to serving the UConn family is admirable, and for me personally, it has changed my life.\n\nThe career-oriented networking event you organized over 6 years ago opened a door for me to intern with and learn from another UConn alum. That internship provided me with an opportunity when I needed it most, and I will forever be grateful. Your wisdom, good-faith, commitment to UConn, and consistent positivity has been a blessing to all who’ve been fortunate enough to cross paths with you. I commit to paying it forward to the best of my ability.\n\nThank you, Coach. We are all lucky to have you in our lives.\n\nGo Huskies!\n\n-Bryant Sheriffs, 2015-2017\n\nDear Coach Baylock,\n\nThank you for the support and the endless love during my time at UConn. You always knew what to say. Even after my departure you stayed in touch and always made it feel like home when I came back to visit.\n\nWith appreciation,\n\nHergy Mayala, 2015-2018\n\nGreetings Coach Baylock,\n\nThank you for being a great man and a great motivator. You are truly God sent!\n\nRespect and Love,\n\nMaurice “Moe” Lloyd, 2001-2004\n\nDear Coach,\n\nGreetings from the fastest player to ever wear UConn gear. Andy Baylock, you could possibly be the greatest man to ever walk the earth. You have done so much for the maturation of a lot of us former UConn players, and continue to keep us in the loop after 20 years. You are a great person, friend and a legend!\n\n-Jason Williams, ’05\n\nIt was August 27,1973, about ten a.m.. It was double session football, first day in pads. It was already 98 degrees on the way to 103. Humidity hung in the air like artillery smoke. We were a bunch of scrubs in the huddle, waiting for instructions.\n\nWhistles and hollering, grunting and the sounds of helmets hitting pads.\n\nSweat and heat like a sauna, we were silent, hot and miserable, just hanging on.\n\nYou came to our huddle and asked us, “Who wants to have fun?”\n\n“We do !” We replied in one voice, hopeful of some respite or reprieve.\n\n“BE THE FUN !” you said with a smile and left us to ponder that thought.\n\nIn that moment I learned a life lesson I never relinquished. Best advice I ever heard in my entire life. Be the fun!\n\nThank, Coach for all the encouragement, dedication and inspiration. You made it fun, and you always had our back. We have been blessed with you in our lives, then and now.\n\nCoach Andy ‘Bear’ Baylock, the best there is.\n\nAl MacLellan 73-75 Co-Capt.\n\nCoach:\n\nI have been organizing this event for some time.\n\nNow it’s my time to tell you why. It’s not about UCONN, football, or baseball, but about feelings. Everyone has feelings that change over the years. Every one of us has had our highs and lows. We have all had challenges, but anyone that has been fortunate enough to have had contact with you has been in receipt of something special – unconditional friendship and love. The coolest thing about it is, I did not know when it was going to happen. It could have been a dreary Saturday and I went out to my mailbox and there is a hand-written postcard with a “Hi Kenny” at the top. Or maybe, it would be mid-morning and I am in my cellar/office working at my computer and my cellphone rings and I glance at it and see “Andy”. Or it could be a sunny day and I get the mail. I open an envelope to see a picture of my 18-year-old self in my UCONN uniform. Suddenly, I forget my aches and pains and the current issues in the world and remember what a blessed life I’ve had. There may be other great people in the world like you, but they haven’t crossed my path yet. Thank you for being in my life.\n\nLove,\n\nKenny Demers 1970\n\nCoach B,\n\nI don’t think there will ever be a way to get across how much you mean to the University of Connecticut and our football team. During a time of so much change and growth for all of us, you were always there to lend a hand, share your wealth of knowledge, and point us in the right direction.\n\nThank you for everything!\n\nSteve Brown\n\nClass of ‘14\n\nDear Andy,\n\nI am so proud to call you Coach!\n\nI clearly recall your commitment to the football program and the players when I played for you back in the ’60’s, the era of the “Spear Tackle.”\n\nYour kindness and caring is what struck me and to no one’s surprise you have never wavered. I still marvel at you hand-writing all of those messages and notes to us over the years.\n\nYou are an amazing human being Coach, and I want to thank you for all you’ve done for me and all of the players you have coached over the years. I am so sorry I can’t attend your celebration, but know that you occupy a very special place in my heart.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn “Beau” Billingslea (1962-1965)\n\nCoach,\n\nI can’t thank you enough from the beginning of our freshman FB team for believing in me, mentoring me to believe in myself, and staying in touch with your continued mentoring throughout my entire life journey.\n\nYou live the definition of true friendship.\n\nForever grateful\n\nAl Akowitz\n\nCoach,\n\nMy first recollection of you was in 1964 when he became a member of the UConn football staff. It was during preseason practice. Andy was working with me as I was learning to play a new position – offensive center. He showed me the correct stance to play center. He indicated that I’d know I was over the ball correctly when the sweat rolled off my nose and it landed right in the middle of the football.\n\nWhen I graduated, Andy played a major role in my future. Andy recommendation that East Catholic High School hire me as a physical education instructor and assistant football coach. For that, I am forever grateful.\n\nOver the years, it was impossible to attend a UConn football game, or many men’s or women’s basketball games without seeing Andy in attendance. Recently I was fortunate enough to go out to lunch with Andy in Narragansett R.I. We reminisced about UConn and East Catholic High School where Andy started the football program. I had to chuckle as Andy still remembered the words to the school song (4 years together on the hill where fir trees meet the sky).\n\nI feel blessed that Andy was so instrumental in my life. He truly is a State Treasure.\n\nCliff Demers 1965\n\nDear Coach Andy,\n\nStill do not feel comfortable calling you Andy, in my mind you will always be “Coach”. Sorry I will not be able to make Thursday night as I will be on a family vacation. The event is well deserved and long overdue. Other than my parents, wife, children and brothers, I can’t think of any person that has had a more profound positive affect on my life. Eighteen years old, freshman year, my father is dying and then dies, I would not have made it but for you. Throughout my life, I have often reflected on how fortunate I was to have you as a mentor and still attempt to follow the examples you set so many years ago.\n\nCongratulations and God’s Speed.\n\nPaul Gruner\n\nDear Coach Baylock,\n\nI think of you not just as a coach but as an outstanding friend, individual and representative of the University of Connecticut. While you coached the team you were always concerned with players as individuals. You made it a point to keep in touch with former athletes and have done so with me for more than 55 years. I am proud to know you, Andy Baylock.\n\n-Victor Kinon (Class of ’68)\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nYou have been a great inspiration to me since I first met you when you recruited me back in 1966. I was called out of class to meet with you and my high school coach/teacher. I’ll never forget your enthusiasm for UConn and how you bled blue even then. I was sold. You have led a charmed life and influenced 1000’s of kids …. and are still able to name them all, along with a little insightful story about them. Amazing! My favorite is Coach Toner buying you the best steak you ever had on your way back to Storrs after you guys came to my house. That was 57 years ago. I can’t remember what I did yesterday. I am thankful for you being in my life, have and will continue to cherish our friendship.\n\nBobby Nichols ’67-’70\n\nDear Coach B,\n\nAlways ready with a smile, you were one of the very first people I met when I started my UConn career in the Football Office back in 2004. You continuously were willing to share your vast knowledge of UConn Athletics, Baseball, Football, etc., and that helped me more than you know. Listening to your legendary stories made me the happiest and they stick with me still. Your stories are legendary, and so are YOU. Your kindness and generosity extend well beyond UConn. I can only imagine the thousands of lives you’ve touched. But I want you to know that you ARE UConn Athletics for me. The one constant in my past and present happy thoughts of UConn Football. Love you Coach – keep pitching,\n\n-Joanne Fazio\n\nCoach B,\n\nYou are a true inspiration to us all with your dedication and commitment to UConn.\n\nLove you,\n\nKappy\n\nCoach. I have always been astounded how great a coach you have been to so many for so long. No doubt you remember all the baseball and football players you had over the years. Your toughness and kindness know no bounds. You always seemed to get the most out of players by providing encouragement and excellent challenges. I never ever witnessed you belittle any player, anyone – ever. About eight years ago I happened to be at UConn, and I thought of visiting you. I had not seen you in many decades. The building was locked but a person let me in, and I went up to a secretary and asked if Coach Baylock was in. Instantly, down the hall you bellowed: “Is that Brian Hermes?” You jumped out of your room, we hugged, and then you took me on a grand tour of the new facilities.\n\nYou are the best.\n\nBrian Hermes – 1971\n\nCoach,\n\nYou have been one of the most inspirational and influential people in my life. I will always cherish our friendship.\n\nI can remember the first time I met you in 1964, you were bigger than life itself. You have continued to be a bigger than life role model for all those that were fortunate enough to come into contact with you. You have been responsible for many things in my life from talking me into staying with the program, telling me about my first Head Coaching job at Plainfield High School when I returned from the Service, to teaching me how to study and live by a simple “To Do” list every day. However, the most important take away from you was learning how to treat people with respect, loyalty and a never-ending work ethic.\n\nWe are all better people because of you, and we thank you for being the glue that holds the Football Alumni together.\n\nTonight, is our way of showing our love for you.\n\nLove,\n\nVin Iovino 1968\n\nMy Guy!!! Coach Baylock, you offered nothing but love to me since I met you for the first time ever at the age of 12 during goaline, the program you ran that was major in my school and had a positive impact on my peers. Being blessed enough to follow my dreams and play for UConn through the years of 2018-2022 you were there side by side everyday pouring nothing but positivity and wisdom on me every time we spoke. You lectured me on life, advice on my game and how to continue growing as a young man, and you told me things about East Hartford back in the day that I knew nothing about which was always funny to hear. I can’t thank you enough Coach, you are the epitome of UConn football. I love you and I’m grateful to have you as a resource in my life.\n\nThank you coach,\n\nKK\n\nKevon Jones, ’18-22\n\nCoach,\n\nI remember meeting for the first time and thinking, “wow this coach really does care about me. Can’t let this guy down”… I am confident you’ve had a direct impact on my success and can guarantee you’ve enlightened and enriched my life thoroughly in ways you may not realize.\n\nYour goal of molding young men on and off the field into men of character and work ethic was a triumph. I draw on lessons you’ve taught me daily and I still strive to never let you down!\n\nWe are all Huskies and you are the lead dog Coach!\n\nThank you for all your time and efforts. I know you don’t do anything for thanks but out of love for us as men; you deserve to know we love you too!\n\nRyan Griffin, ’08\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nI’d like to say that you are a true trail blazer of man. True man of your word, you are truly the intricate key piece to the longevity of our brother hood. Living legend!!!\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJustin “Perk” Perkins, 2001-2004\n\nDear Coach B,\n\nI have never had an individual pour as much positive energy as you, and for that I am eternally grateful. I look at you as a father figure whose influence was unmatched through my time at UConn. I hope you know you are loved deeply by the UConn community and alumni. Thank you for your dedication to our success from mentorship to setting up career fairs.\n\nLove,\n\nPoughkeepsie Popper(Reuben Frank) 2010-2014\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nThank you for the love you always shown me and all the players. You are one of the most genuine people that I have ever met and everyone you have touched at UConn has benefited so greatly from it. You treat every player like we are one of your sons.\n\nThank you and we love you Coach B!\n\n-Taber Small\n\n“Nothing in this world is accomplished without passion”\n\nAs a member of Coach Baylock’s first freshman football team in 1964, one thing hasn’t changed much for Coach B over the years. The 105 freshmen players probably were among the first entries into Coach B’s legendary “database”, a paper rolodex file that must have thousands of entries today.\n\nFast forward to today and certainly automation helps Coach B. with his football duties. But that personal touch is still there as he continues to use his rolodex file to keep in touch with all of us.\n\nUntil recently, Coach mailed us the newsletter and always included a hand written greeting on the front page.\n\nToday, the football news letter is electronically emailed to us. But the Coach Baylock personal connection with all of us still happens in different ways. It can be at the football alumni tent on a game day. Another can be a piece of mail with a note and picture with you and teammates pulled out of his files. Or sometimes Coach makes an off-season phone call which will usually include a few Husky football stories.\n\nOn Thursday, August 31, 2023, we will have a chance to publicly show our appreciation for all that Coach Baylock has done for the University of Connecticut and Husky football.\n\nHis tireless effort to keep football alumni and today’s football team members connected is so appreciated. We’ll have a chance to express our gratitude for his connection to all of us during his special game night and I know that appreciation will continue well beyond.\n\nThank you, Coach Andy Baylock for your friendship from that freshman season in 1964. All the best in the future as you provide a link to Husky football – past and present.\n\nCarmen and Marlene Ammirato\n\nClass of 1968\n\nTo Uncle Gramps,\n\nMan, where do I start? Coach, you are the epitome of man who has experienced true happiness in his life. This comes from the amount of people you’ve influenced, mentored, and uplifted with just a mere smile or 2-minute convo that has created a ripple effect and impact far beyond the football field and UConn campus.\n\nEvery time I asked how you were doing, you would swiftly reply, “You know, not so bad for an old man. But I can still kick your ass!” I’ll hand it to you coach, the way you approached every day with a positive mindset sometimes made me actually believe you could. Haha\n\nSince day 1, you commented on the fact that I am always smiling. “We don’t want no pickle puss’s around here,” as you would say. Well coach, the reason for me smiling when I saw you was because I truly saw your superpower which was your heart and spirit.\n\nI am honored to have walked the hallways with you and shared a couple of laughs. Love you man and thank you.\n\nBest,\n\nOmar Fortt\n\nClass of 2021\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nCourtney Robinson, incoming freshman class by the way of Florida back in ’05. I want to take a second just to say, “Thank You”. Even as a transfer you’ve always been a standup guy and over the years we still stayed in contact and getting as many youth on campus as possible here in the state.\n\nForever Thank you! -CR9\n\nCoach,\n\nYou granted my wish 50 years ago to be a part of UConn football. If you were ambivalent about it, you never showed it. I learned a lot about the game, about discipline, about showing up from you. You cut me no slack, but treated me with kindness and respect. When I remember my years at UConn, I think of football first and the lifelong friends I made because of football. You taught us all life lessons, made us accountable, encouraged us when we needed it and reminded us to make our parents proud. You made me feel like a part of the family. No visit to UConn is complete without a hug from you. It was an experience that I will never forget and will always cherish. Enjoy your special day. ❤️\n\nWith love,\n\nMartha\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nCongratulations and thank you for the positive impact and lifelong lessons you given to generations of Huskies!!\n\nAs a 18 year old out of state kid who tore up his knee 45 days into his college career, your help and guidance made a huge difference in my ability to move forward. Being told I may not be able to play again, my sole purpose for going to school, you taught me early life lessons. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday you would show up in the station wagon at 7:45 to make sure I would get to class on time. This along with your study hall put me on a different path than when I showed up in August. You helped give me a different perspective and purpose in life. I know you have had a similar impact on hundreds of us over the years. You are truly a special person.\n\nThank you,\n\nKen Donlon ‘77\n\nHey Coach,\n\nI appreciate you being the face of UConn athletics alum. Knowing you’re there with open arms always makes me feel good about coming home.\n\nMuch love, Coach,\n\nRazul Wallace, 1999-2002\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nThank you for the impact you have had on my life and the lives of hundreds of young men like me. Your contributions are immeasurable. The particulars of the games (or the plays we ran on the scout team 😊) have long faded from memory. However, the life lessons you taught and the example you set, have remained with me all of my life. I will be forever appreciative. Congratulations on the very well-deserved recognition.\n\nTerry Ramsey ’74 – ’77\n\nCoach!!\n\nMan, you are the very definition of Bleed Blue! You’re truly an inspiration to me with your tenacity, perseverance, and integrity! You’re someone that I looked up to from the day we met, and then I became your bodyguard, (I took that job seriously, LOL). You have a long life ahead of you and I assume you will still be at UConn, one way or another. They can’t get rid of you that easily. I know I speak for everyone in my class, before and after when I say that you hold a place in my heart where it can never be extinguished.\n\nThank you for being you! Love you!\n\nRich Levy, ’16\n\nCoach B,\n\nLove and appreciate all you have done for me and every UConn student athlete. Bless you and your family today and every day!\n\nBest wishes and a well-deserved honor.\n\nButch Parmalee 98’\n\nAndy, You have been a great part of my career at UConn! You have been so supportive way beyond my years at UConn! I hope you enjoy this honor, Love you man! ”\n\nJoe Corbo 1974\n\nCoach Baylock, you are only one of two people I call coach with a capital C. When you call your former players all snap to attention and say “Yes Coach”.\n\nThanks You\n\nDrew Bickel 1972\n\nDear Coach Baylock,\n\nI cannot even begin to find the right words to express how thankful I am for you. From the first day I stepped on campus and became a member of the UConn Football Family, you offered me advice and gave me the tools to help me become the best student-athlete I possibly could. From watching over my countless snaps during practice, to giving me words of encouragement to help me become a better leader, you were always there for me. After five years, two degrees, and the opportunity to accomplish my dream of becoming a UConn Husky, I am eternally grateful for your kindness and positivity. Thank you for all that I have done and will continue to do for UConn Football and UConn Athletics.\n\nThank you,\n\nBrian Keating\n\n#53\n\nClass of 2021 / 22\n\nCoach Baylock isn’t just the kindest and most joyful man in UConn history… he’s one of the toughest too. One of my earliest UConn Football memories was when we got our first day off from summer camp back in ‘06, and Coach B was pitcher for the softball game we played. He took a softball right off the shin bone and it swelled up as big as the softball that hit him! But he shrugged it off like it was nothing and kept pitching, with, somehow, and even bigger smile than he normally sports.\n\nA tough and a heartwarming gentleman, that I admire endlessly.\n\nThank you, Coach Baylock.\n\nBest,\n\nAlex Molina 2006-2009\n\nCoach Baylock has been one of the most influential people in my life. I consider him to be in the top five people of all time for me. From the time I stepped on the field in 1971 until now, he has always been there for me. I can remember a few years ago, speaking with him and he could remember a play that I made against the University of Maine on the end sweep. I can’t remember what I had for lunch yesterday! I have 11 grand-kids and all I want for them is to be decent humans. Coach Baylock is one of the most decent humans I have ever met.\n\nLove you Coach!\n\nGary Calvino\n\nThank you for everything Coach B!\n\nAs a young inner-city guy coming from New Jersey, it was good to have that guy that loved you no matter what you look like, where you came from, or what your background was. As long as you bled blue, you welcomed us. You will always hold a special place in my heart because of the HUGE heart you have. You would give rides to players that were injured to make sure they got to places on time. You would hold steak dinners at your house for guys that made the honor role. That’s the type of heart you have. Poppa Bear, you will forever be my favorite all time person from the UConn staff. Love you Coach Baylock. I know you can still kick some ass if needed. Haha!\n\nAndre Dixon, 2005-2009\n\nCoach B,\n\nI just wanted to take a moment to say thank you. Thank you for giving everything you have every day. We appreciate all that you’ve done for us. One thing I truly find impressive is that I’ve never run into anyone who can say a negative thing about you. You treat everyone with the perfect mix of respect and tough love. You go out of your way for people even when you don’t have to. You’ve withstood the test of time. And I pray you continue to do so. You’re a pillar in the UConn sports community and I’m honored to say I know you. Keep being great!\n\nMuch Love,\n\nJerome Williams, 2008-2011\n\nDear Coach Baylock,\n\nI know if my parents were alive they would want me to personally thank you for taking me under your wing as a Freshman Husky, and not just being a Coach, but guiding me, and mentoring me and my teammates through our years at UConn. I was one of the fortunate players who got to be with you not only in Football, but 4 years in Baseball, culminating with our trip to the College World Series in 1972. I have such wonderful memories and I’m glad you are finally being recognized by the University. You are one of a kind, a great person and a wonderful friend to us all. Thank you for all you have done. With utmost respect……..\n\nKeith Kraham 1972\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nThank you for teaching us the importance of giving back. A lot of my favorite memories from my time at UConn was going down to Hartford to speak to the youth. All that was made possible because of you. Love you, Coach!\n\nEmmanuel Omokaro, ’11\n\nThanks coach B for all that you have done and still are doing for UCONN. It has been a pleasure getting to know you while at UCONN and learning even more about you after graduating. Your personal letters and messages are very much appreciated. I am so excited to see you being honored coach. Enjoy!!!\n\nCarl Bond 98\n\nDear Coach Baylock,\n\nI can never thank you enough for all that you’ve done for me during my time at UConn. Your genuine concern and love for everyone who has come through the program will never be forgotten.\n\nAll the best,\n\nDhameer Bradley, 2013-2018\n\nHey coach!\n\nI just wanted to tell you how appreciative I am to have you in my life. As a young Husky you showed me the values of life both on the football field and off. I remember you advising all of the young pups, pushing us to be promising future leaders, helping us achieve and focus on not only being great football players, but college graduates as well. The best quality that Coach Bear brings to the UConn family would be all of his hard work with the alumni. Keeping the UConn family together by emails, phone calls, and invites to football games. It’s amazing what Coach Baylock brings to the UConn nation and we love him dearly, and thank him for all of his dedication to the husky family!\n\n-Best,\n\nIsiah Moore, UConn Football 2012\n\nCoach Baylock!\n\nI will always appreciate the words of wisdom you have given me. It was a blessing to have learned from you. Thank you for everything, Coach!\n\nZavior Scott, ’17-19\n\nCoach Baylock –\n\nYou are a tremendous leader and have been such a positive influence on so many young adults throughout your career, me included. Enjoy this night, and you better still be throwing out BP!\n\nNoah Iden, ’18-’22\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nYou Greeted Me Upon Arrival. Stayed Throughout My Journey and Now I Humbly Thank You For All Your Generosity and Passion for Making Others Better.\n\nDan Rose\n\nCoach\n\nI remember the first time that we meant when you sat in my house with the train rumbling by outside. Although I have never found my baseball glove, I am fortunate to have found a mentor, a great coach and friend, and someone that will always be dear to my heart. Finally thank you for all the thousands of people that you have helped that feel the same way that I do.\n\nAlways,\n\nLou Allen Jr. – Class of 74\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nWhere to even start? Your presence and the way you cared is invaluable. For a lot of players, it was the first time they have been on their own and your presence made countless young men feel more comfortable and surer that they belonged. Thank you for all the encouraging words and just always being available to talk when needed. I cannot begin to explain the impact you have had on me and all the players over the tremendous amount of years with the program. The University is so lucky to have you.\n\nLove you Coach!\n\nRyan Wirth, 2008-2012\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nI wanted to thank you for your dedication and hard work to keep the UConn Football Family Alumni together. Your constant updates and messages to alumni keep us all informed how the program is doing even though we may not be close geographically. I remember you always said to make connections outside of football because not everyone will go Pro. I have taken that advice in my career and still network and meet new people. Thank you for all you do and always being supportive of the “Kicksquad” (Desi, Teggart, Me).\n\nChad Christen – UConn Kicker (2009 – 2013)\n\nTo Coach Baylock,\n\nYou are an indispensable figure in the world of UCONN football, an architect of success, and a beacon of inspiration. Your role in shaping the program’s triumphs cannot be overstated. Through your leadership and guidance, UCONN football has soared to new heights, achieving remarkable success both on and off the field.\n\nYour unwavering commitment to excellence has instilled a winning culture within the program, fostering a legacy of achievement and resilience. Your ability to connect people, build strong bonds, and keep them engaged has been instrumental in the team’s triumphs.\n\nUCONN football owes a great deal of its triumphs to your tireless efforts, strategic brilliance, and unwavering passion. Your contributions have elevated the program to unprecedented levels of greatness.\n\nAs we reflect upon your remarkable tenure, it is evident that your impact extends far beyond wins and losses. You have shaped the lives of countless players, instilling in them the values of discipline, perseverance, and teamwork that will serve them far beyond the football field.\n\nCoach Baylock, you are a true legend, and your influence on UCONN football will forever be enshrined in its storied history. Thank you for your unwavering dedication, leadership, and timeless impact on the program’s success.\n\nWith utmost respect and gratitude,\n\nGerrard Sheppard, ’08-’10\n\nCoach B!\n\nComing to you from the west coast and wish I could be there on the 31st to see us beat the wolfpack. I’ll be there in spirit, and with my dad spread all over the rent, there will always be an “Irwin” there. One of these years in the near future the family and I will get back to UConn and be able to catch up on everything. You truly have been and continue to be the glue that holds so many generations of UConn Football together.\n\nMuch love and please continue to stay forever “young”.\n\nBilly Irwin #58, 2000-2004\n\nCoach Baylock –\n\n“You are a great leader and a tremendous part of the UCONN Football Organization. You were/are a great mentor to me especially throughout my tenure at UCONN and continue to shape the lives of the young men that walk the halls today”\n\nMathieu Olivier\n\nCoach B –\n\nThank you for starting the idea of the movement for UConn football Alumni. As a Floridian Alumni it used to be easy to feel “out of the loop” but because of you, not only myself…but my family feel like “part of the family” again. It will mean more than you know, for the rest of our lives. thank you!\n\nBrian Hoffman\n\nDear Coach Baylock,\n\nI am honored to have a lifelong relationship with a man of your caliber, expertise, and prestige. The impact you have made on many people over many years, close and far, can not go unnoticed. You’re a stand-up man who I have the utmost respect and honor for. The love you had for all of us has always been genuine and special. Through your words and actions, you showed all of this through your commitment. Sincerely, thank you for your continued hard work and dedication serving countless people over time. I appreciate everything you have done and honored to have you as a life long coach and father figure. It’s all love Coach B. Papa Bear!\n\nWith Great Respect and Honor\n\nLove,\n\nTwyon Martin Jr. (’07-’11) and Twyon III\n\nTo Coach B …. The One and Only !\n\nYOU have stood the test of time for all of us …. As young people YOU believed in us and have stayed with us the whole way !!!\n\nWith thanks and appreciation,\n\nRick Robustelli – 1971\n\nAndy, thank you for being you: one tough, honest and dedicated man, who changed my life. If it wasn’t for Andy, I would not be a UCONN graduate and 4 year player. It would have been easy to quit my freshman year, for a variety of reasons.\n\nAndy, you have been a consistent mentor and guide throughout my life. You are one of the best people I have ever met, always helping, encouraging, totally unselfish. You deserve every accolade you receive.\n\nYou have made an impact on so many players. You are truly one of a kind! Thanks again, Coach\n\nPaul Scaffidi (Scaffer)\n\nUCONN 1974\n\n434-962-0682\n\nJust a short message to you Coach because you need to know that anyone who was touched by your leadership emerged as a better person. 1964 is 59 years behind us and the warm feelings of your enthusiasm, encouragement and kindness live on in me, probably the least qualified guy ever to have the opportunity to play for you. Coach, your reach, while centered in Storrs, goes far and deep into the character of your players. You are, and always have been, a class act.\n\nEd Jasudowich (aka The Kielbasa Kid)\n\nDear Coach Baylock,\n\nI want to thank you for all you have done for me during my time at UConn and as an alumnus. The establishment of this foundation could not go to a more deserving man. Kenny has done a superb job of getting it off the ground. Personally, my time playing for you was my best and helped me countless times in my life. There were some very talented players at UC, of which I probably was not one. But, to this day, you always treated me as one. In retrospect, you treated us all as stars. I have coached many sports from youth to juco level baseball and always made it a point to treat all players and families as you did us. I’ll never forget the afternoon of your time you gave me a few years ago when I came up for a visit. It really brought me to tears and reinforced the kind of man you are. Congratulations and enjoy your most deserved honor.\n\nPete LaVenia\n\nAndy:\n\nI am so grateful for all that you did for us our freshman year, helping us acclimate to college football, college academics and living away from home for the first time. It provided the foundation for success over the remainder of my college experience, and for a work ethic that has served me well in the years since.\n\nYou are deserving of all the honor and accolades you will receive on your special day. Thank you Coach Baylock!\n\nJohn G Salek\n\nUConn Football 1969 – 1972\n\nCoach B.\n\n“4th and 1, what are you going to do?” Your last year coaching football in 1978 was my first and you were my position coach for part of the season. I also had you as a teacher for one of my first classes in PE. Fast forward to 2003 when you were reengaged with the football program which has been a wonderful run getting former players involved in the program to mentor future Huskies, solidifying bonds with former players and creating a community which did not exist before. Your dedication to the university and most importantly the former players (whether star players, or like me, having a short career) has been stellar. You are truly one of a kind!\n\nJim Kern – 1983\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nWe are so excited you are getting a well deserved recognition by the football program. Knowing you throughout the years has been a blessing for us and our family. Having you as a coach, Sue as a teacher, Eric as a mentor then me coaching with you has been so much fun. We always look forward to seeing you. I liked working with your kids at Edwin O. Smith and your wife. You guys did great raising your kids even while being so involved with UConn Athletics. I hope you enjoy your day and we look forward to seeing you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nOne of the Three Amigos and the best Slider you had in your class, Sue and Mike McCarthy\n\nPS The Vineyard is still a great place to live, much better than your cape. Ha Ha\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nthe legend himself!! The amount of life lessons I’ve learned from you over the years are countless. Must be all those homemade chocolate chip cookies my mom made you while at Dodd, and up in Storrs. Everywhere you go, you light up a room with your smile! I hope all is well and look forward to catching up soon!\n\n-Kenny Dutton ’14\n\nCoach,\n\nYou have done so much for me and the UCONN Community. You had such a profound impact on my development as a young coach and continue to inspire and mentor those around you. I will always appreciate your guidance and generosity.\n\nShane Fogarty\n\nClass of 2006\n\nFootball GA 2010/2011\n\nAssistant Coach 2013\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nWords can’t express the level of appreciation I have for you, and I know I speak for all the players that have crossed your path in your journey that your impact is profound. For me specifically, you have allowed me to feel like the UCONN football experience is a true brotherhood and family. Your legacy will last forever across multiple sports and that is a testament to the genuine love that you bring to work with you every day. I’m forever grateful for everything that you are and the role you have played in my life. Thank you!\n\nSincerely,\n\n“JJ” – Jonathan Jean-Louis, 2007-2011\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nI remember the day that we met on my official visit and the energy that you shared with the players. It was contagious and a major reason why I decided to attend UConn. Your passion for the game and the players was none that I’ve ever seen from my college visits. It’s been 16 years since I was a part of the football program. You continue to share that same energy whenever I bring my family to visit! You are a rare breed Coach B and appreciated by all! Thank you for being a huge part of my life! Go Huskies!\n\n-Marvin Taylor, 2003-2007\n\nDear Coach Baylock’\n\nSorry I am unable to attend your ceremony at the game this week due to the fact that I am still fighting this terrible case of leukemia which has plagued me for some time.\n\nI just want to thank you for all the assistance you provided me during my days at UConn, especially the early years.\n\nI am very lucky to have been associated with you and my teammates who won two Yankee conference titles. UConn and all of its players and coaches have been lucky have you on its staff.\n\nSincerely\n\nBob Warren\n\nCoach!\n\nNo one means more to the UCONN athletics program than you. I always enjoyed our talks about Suffield Academy as we walked from Shenkman to the bookstore. I could always count on you to check in with me about family, school and life and I always appreciated it!\n\nNothing but love!\n\nBrice McAllister, 2014-2017\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nYou are one of, if not the best, coaches of all time! You gave me jewels that I still live by today. You are a wise man with nothing but love and care for other people!\n\nThanks Coach!\n\nTyree Clark, ’11-’13\n\nThank you Coach Baylock for your selfless service to UCONN athletics. Your commitment and dedication to the students of UCONN Baseball and Football teams through many decades is inspiring. For me, it is pretty cool to know you coached my Uncle Andre Thompson of Louisiana in the late 70s along with his brother. During my tenure of ’04-’07 I appreciate you allowing me to speak to the kids from my hometown of Hartford, CT. It meant the world to me. May peace be upon you.\n\n– Stanley Williams “Stack”, ’07-’08\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nCongratulations! Coach, you have been an outstanding ambassador\n\nfor UConn athletics. I am glad you are being so honored. Your\n\ncoaching style was wonderful. You acknowledged positive effort,\n\nwhile at the same time pointing out the possibility of a more impactful\n\noutcome. It has been a model for me. It is always a pleasure to\n\nreceive your correspondence, notes, and photos. It is not lost to me\n\nthat you care enough to personally initial them. Thank you for your\n\nmany years of commitment to UConn. You are the embodiment of\n\n“Bleed Blue”\n\nDavid Sorrell ‘74\n\nCoach B,\n\nCan’t thank you enough for all of the wise words and support over the years. Whenever I was down, I could always rely on you to pick me up with a “you’re a tough Irishman, Murph. You got this.”\n\nYou would always take the time to say hello to my family and that would often make their trip. My Pop loved reminiscing with you about your match-up up with him at Nova and the old Big East.\n\nNothing is ever too much of a hassle for you, Coach. You are the epitome of what it means to be a leader of men. You have changed and impacted so many lives throughout your career and I speak for us all in saying that it is an honor and a privilege to have you in our lives. Thank you for all that you have done and continue to do, Coach!\n\nBest,\n\n-Kevin Murphy “Murph” #94 Class of 2018\n\nCoach,\n\nThank you for all the time and advice you gave me while at UConn.\n\nAs a transfer from Army/West Point, arriving on the UConn campus was quite a change.\n\nYou and your dedication to young football players have been invaluable my entire life.\n\nI remember meeting you at your field house office, study halls, and scout teams, and you always made time for your players.\n\nYour experience and expert advice for the young men that have been fortunate enough to have met you, lives on forever as does your legacy.\n\nSincerely,\n\nArt Christiani 1979\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nThird down and long from your own 5 yard line…what do you do?

Thank u for being you!\n\nWe love you!\n\nDanny Sullivan, class of ‘71.\n\nCoach B is a legend! During my time at UConn Andy would often come up to me and tell me stories about my family history from New Britain. Stories that I didn’t even know! He was always there to support the guys and the coaching staff. Congrats Andy!\n\nChris Pavasaris\n\nDear Coach Baylock, Having left Coach Naviaux’s office during my recruiting visit, my grandmother said to me, “Anthony, I want you to come here. That man is the only one to have spoken about you graduating.” Graduation, was a hope and a prayer; however, with the study hall lectures that fall, along with you monitoring my stadium stairs reminders for penalties after practice, (lol,) I was on the road to eventually learning how to learn. I sincerely want to know that through the years, all I have tried to do is to pay your fine example forward during my career teaching and coaching. You have been a very special blessing in my life, and I love you for that. God bless you, Coach.\n\nTony Catapano 1975-78\n\nAndy\n\nYou guided us during our early days at UConn to make sure we would get the most out of our UConn experience. And once we left to go out to the real world, you kept in touch to help maintain our Husky connection with your newsletter and special notes from time to time. The fact that you still remember our names and hometowns when we meet at the football game day tent is amazing. You are the epitome of bleeding blue and we are thankful to have your mentorship and happy that UConn football is honoring you. Thanks for all you’ve done for us. Go Huskies!!\n\nBest wishes\n\nRalph Tiner 66-69\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nCongratulations on your amazing UConn career. I feel privileged to know you and to have played for you. You’re a special person who makes everyone feel special when they’re with you. Thank you for all you have done and continue to do. You are truly a UConn treasure.\n\nCongrats,\n\nDick McRedmond\n\nThank you Coach for all you have done for me and so many others.\n\nYou have been selfless and dedicated in helping all to be a better student, athlete and person.\n\nYour legacy is solid. Thank you.\n\nJim Pisciottano\n\n1971 Football Co-Captain\n\nCOACH-\n\nNo one is more deserving of that title. Beginning with those study halls with you and Mama Bear in 1966 ( yes even student managers had to attend) to allowing my son to help with baseball in the early 2000’s, you have been a teacher of life lessons, a friend to all , and inspiration to countless professional- on and off the playing fields of Storrs. If we bleed blue it is because of you.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nBill DeGrazia UConn Basketball “71\n\nBilly DeGrazia ’04, ’05\n\nCoach,\n\nCongratulations on a long overdue honor!

Truly appreciate all you have done for me and my family. Thank you for your dedication to the University of Connecticut and fellow student-athletes and their families. We are fortunate that we have had you in our lives. If there is anyone that truly bleeds UConn Blue (Football, Baseball, Family, Friendships), it is you. Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChris Spelman\n\nUConn Forever\n\nBA 93, MA 95\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nYou are the rock of UConn sports and the glue to UConn football.

Your kindness, commitment and love shines through in everything you do, and everyone you encounter.

We love you!\n\nLisa and Dan Lowry\n\nCoach B,\n\nIt is 50 years since we first met! Your guidance and friendship over those years has had a tremendous impact on my life and that of so many others.

Yes, Coach you truly Bleed Blue!\n\nGo Huskies!\n\nPaul Mariano 77\n\nWhen we finally find a slab of stone big enough to carve the Mount Rushmore for the University of Connecticut Division of Athletics, your name and face will be one of the first on there. Thank you for all you have done for past, current, and what your legacy will do for future athletes. I am not certain that the word ‘legend’ even captures what you mean to the institution.\n\nWe ALL appreciate you, Coach.\n\nDr. Uyi Osunde (Captain 2003)\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nI can never thank you enough for all of your support while I was at UConn, and after graduating when you helped me look for job opportunities. Your care will never be forgotten.\n\n-Denzel Allen, 2011-2012\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nYou’re an amazing coach and an even better person. I thank God I met you during my time at UConn. Your smile and enthusiasm is something I looked forward to seeing. Going to Burton every morning and seeing you have the same energy was a lesson I learned and took with me.\n\n“No matter how hard life gets, You should smile because God is never done working on you”\n\nYour legacy will never leave UConn. Love you Coach!\n\nBest,\n\nKevin Mensah, ’21\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nThank you for all you do and have done for our program. You are a true living legend. Forever grateful!!\n\nDanny Lansanah, ’09\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nI remember coming in wide eyed and naive with nothing but an eagerness to prove I belonged on the team and a smile. You reminded me daily to keep smiling and assured me that being a pleasure to be around would always give me a place as a both a teammate and player. As we celebrate you and an amazing career, I just want to thank you for all of your dedication to making sure players were heard and for reminding me that the tough days are just a part of the journey. Smile through it, embrace it, and push through- you’ll come out whole.\n\nAll the best,\n\nTyrae Sims, #87 2014-2016\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nThanks Coach for being a mentor. I’m grateful that I met you.

You have been a guiding light to us all.\n\nLove Warren Nesteruk 1976, 77, 78\n\nCoach Baylock:\n\nCertain people you meet in life have a special impact on your development as a man and you certainly fit this criteria. I appreciate all that you have done for me as well as the UConn program.\n\nKen Miller. (1978-81)\n\nCoach B,\n\nYou are truly an all-time UConn great because of the positive impact you have had upon so many people throughout your career. You have been a leader and an ambassador for both the baseball and football programs at UConn, as well as the University at large. So much of the wit and wisdom you imparted upon us on the field or in the freshmen study halls still rings true today. That’s impactful!!!\n\nI wonder if while watching a practice you still say, “Good try, but make the play.” Throughout your career you taught us “to make the play.” You did it by being respectful, responsible, truthful, compassionate, and committed and instilling those traits into your players.\n\nYou’ve been “making the plays” for countless individuals and the University for over a half a century. We are forever grateful.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nPhil Pomposi\n\nClass of 1979\n\nCoach B,\n\nGrabber here, just wanting to say congratulations! I cannot put into words how much of an impact you’ve had on my life, both on and off the field. All the stories going back to my time in high school, throughout my three years at UConn, are memories I have and will continue to cherish. Thank you for not only for bringing me to UConn, but for being such a great man and friend. Congrats again!!\n\nJason Grabowski\n\nCoach B,\n\nI wanted to send this message to let you know how much of a big influence you were in my life and how much being part of the UConn baseball program helped to shape my life. First of all, I wanted to thank you for always believing in me as a person. With my struggles my first two years, coming from a small town to a division 1 program, it would’ve been easy to give up on me. However, you never did and despite thinking my playing days at UConn might be over, you suggested I change my delivery and become the Side-Arm pitcher, which I embraced, and ultimately ended up having a successful UConn career. Coach, I credit you for having that belief in me and thinking out of the box and just wanted to thank you for that opportunity.\n\nSecondly, I wanted to also thank you for instilling the ethics of hard work, being on time, and the importance of education. To this day, I still use some of your techniques that you taught us, including reading techniques involving reading the first and last sentence of a paragraph when reading a book, etc. Your instruction in time management, and your focus on our academic success really helped me to be able to concurrently manage both playing baseball and successfully completing a physical therapy degree, as well as leading to a successful career in physical therapy after school.\n\nThanks again for everything and congratulations!\n\n-Chris Hayes “Haze-man”\n\nCoach B ,\n\nYou are an amazing Man and an amazing Coach .\n\nScott Sweitzer\n\nAndy,\n\nIt has been a pleasure and honor knowing you. Your dedication is unsurpassed. You did not only coach football but gave us wisdom in life. We learned how to be successful, good and humble people. The friends I made during my days at UConn are the best friends in my life. Thank you for being part of our lives and sharing yours with us. I think I speak for all UConn Alumni in saying we are better people for having known you and UConn Football would not be what it is without you. You have been the heart and soul of UConn Football and our Alumni. Thank you for all you have done.\n\nAllan Burghardt , #82, 78-81.\n\nPS: Can I stop running laps now ???\n\nSince having finished my playing days in 1998, I have gotten to know Coach Baylock and wholeheartedly appreciate all he has done for the UConn Football program/Football Alumni programs as well as the university. Although I did not play for Coach Baylock, I have been in his presence enough over the years and have had stories related to me concerning the positive impact he has had on countless young men, in the various positions he has served. Peace and love Coach; congratulations on your being celebrated for all your accomplishments and service!\n\n-Ernest Lowe 1994 – 1998\n\nCoach “B”\n\nThere is never enough space nor time to truly reflect and describe what you mean to everyone that you have come in contact with over the years. Only YOU have the ability to retain and recall all of the events and relationships you have fostered. The term “Bleed Blue” was created for you. May you continue to model to us all on how to live in this world.\n\nThanks for being you.\n\nMark Svencer\n\nCoach”B”\n\nI want to thank you for ALL you have done for me throughout the years. YOU made UCONN a special place.\n\nBrian Jones “81\n\nDear Coach,\n\nEvery student I have taught and every athlete I have coached has a little Andy Baylock in them. You came into my life in 1966 as My Freshman Football and Baseball Coach and helped me build a strong foundation of leadership and academic skill. For the next three years on the varsity level, I continued to observe firsthand how well you treated people with respect and love. You have always been a great role model and I wanted, and still want, to be like you.\n\nI will always remember the day you called me into your office and asked me “Where did the quiet Italian kid from Newton Go?” You took great pride in checking up on us all and fixing situations before they went off the rails. One of the greatest compliments I ever received is when you asked me to babysit your children. I was honored that I had won your trust. In addition, you and Mrs. Baylock provided a Study Hall program that improved our study skills and grades. Also, your reference letter to the University of Michigan helped me secure a Fellowship. Receiving a copy of that letter from you, 53 years later, nearly brought me to tears.\n\nI feel honored to join the many former athletes, families and friends, whose lives you have touched and enriched. I take great joy telling “Coach Baylock” stories to the Coaching Classes I teach, and to the Football Players and Wrestler’s I have coached. Above all, I appreciate the outpouring of interest and love you continue to give us all.\n\nThank You Coach.\n\nI love you,\n\nJohn R. Passarini #33\n\n(That quiet Italian Kid from Newton)\n\nCoach, you are an incredible person with the sharpest mind. A true wonder. I utilized many of your sayings raising my kids. Thank you for all you have done for UCONN!\n\nMark Flood\n\nAndy,you are a Friend, Mentor,and Coach. The Ings family would like to Thank you\n\nfor the great experience we shared with you and the Uconn Family for\n\n–the last 40 yrs.\n\nEllis Ings 86,87 Roger Ings 1974-77 Capt 77\n\nCell: 203-901-8325 E-Mail: ellisings0@gmail.com\n\nCoach Baylock –\n\nI have known you since my high school days at NFA. I remember wanting to play both football and baseball at UConn and you told me I couldn’t hit a curve ball- stick to football. I’m glad I did ! You have been the ONE constant with our program over the years. The true blue glue that has kept the brotherhood alive and well. I thank you for that. You also inspire me with your constant urge to stay active as life moves on. I aspire to this – thank you for all that you do for us\n\nWe love you Bill Cholawa\n\nCoach B\n\nYou’ve been an inspiration to me from the moment I stepped foot on campus back in 2004. The countless meetings over the years just to see how I’m doing helped me make it through being homesick. Speaking to you and finding out the knowledge you had about my hometown blew me away. You’ve traveled all walks of life with sports. Your welcoming nature and caring attitude left a long lasting impression on anyone that crossed paths with you. UConn has been blessed to have you apart of their University. You are one of a kind. Thank you for everything my guy.\n\nEllis Gaulden\n\nTallahassee Native\n\nFormer UConn Football/Track&Field Athlete 2004 – 2009\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nCongrats on an incredible career and your continued to commitment to the development of us student athletes. One of my fondest memories of my time at UConn was being invited over for steak dinners. You are an incredible influence on so many of us. Thank you for everything!\n\n-Steve Greene\n\n2009-2013\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nThank you for the effort and dedication that you have brought to the university and especially towards the athletes. I am grateful for the drive and passion you have shown to keep us all in loops of each others lives from our time at the university and years after. Thankful for the news letters that you work so hard with providing to the former players . Looking forward to seeing you soon Coach. Thank you for everything!\n\nTyler Samra, 2012-2015\n\nThank you Coach Baylock for all that you’ve done for the UConn community! You’ve left a remarkable impact and you will never be forgotten. I’m more than thankful we’ve crossed paths the past five years and I’m very grateful for the positive energy you’ve brought every single day!\n\n-Jordan Morrison, ’18-’22\n\nTo Coach:\n\nThanks for your mandatory 3 hours of study hall our Freshman year. It helped me get my degree. Many thanks.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJoe Torre\n\nCoach,\n\nYou could receive all of the honors in the world and it still wouldn’t be nearly enough to recognize all you have done for UConn football, the entire athletic program, and the school in general. UConn football is truly a brotherhood, and you are the glue that holds it all together. My family and I love coming up to campus and visiting, one of the highlights is when we see you and ask you how you are doing, you enthusiastically reply “not too bad for an old guy!” Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for all you have done for me, my UConn football brothers, and the entire program. Many things have changed over the years, but you have been the one thing that has remained steady. I look forward to many more years of coming to campus and taking tours around the facilities. Go Huskies!\n\nTim Willman, 09-’13\n\nMy last season at UConn was in 2006, and many things have changed since then. The one thing that remains the same with UConn Football is Coach Baylock’s presence. It’s impossible to put into words how valuable he is to the program & adequately thank him for the positive impact he’s had on thousands of athletes while at UConn and their lives after their athletic careers end. One of many things I admire about Coach Baylock is that he treats the All-American Running Back with the same level of respect as the walk-on trying to earn a spot on the team. Coach Baylock’s memory is second to none. He will remember the high school you went to and will inevitably have a story about that school/town/head football coach. Periodically Coach Baylock will leave me a voicemail. The most recent one was from January of ‘22. It is just over 2 minutes long. This message is an update on how things are with the program. The passion, energy, and excitement in his voice are incredible. I have the message saved and listen to it periodically. He embodies everything right with college sports. Coach B, thank you for selflessly giving your time to the program- keep it up, we need you & appreciate you!\n\nMatt Nuzie\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nI wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude and admiration for your remarkable contributions. Your name, Coach Andy Baylock, stands as a beacon of dedication, unwavering belief, and a lasting legacy that extends well beyond the world of sports.\n\nYour unique ability to inspire teamwork, foster strong character, and ignite individual potential has left an indelible mark on all those who have had the privilege of learning from you. Your mentorship has not only impacted athletes on the field but has also resonated deeply with individuals from all walks of life.\n\nCoach Baylock, your guidance and mentorship are truly a privilege. Your wisdom and encouragement continue to resonate in moments of challenge, motivating us to persevere and exceed our own expectations.\n\nAs we gather to honor you, it is with the utmost respect that we recognize your ongoing legacy as a genuine UConn Legend. Your unwavering dedication and inspirational leadership continue to shape our collective aspirations.\n\nCoach B, your belief in the potential of every individual, coupled with the principles of teamwork and mentorship you have championed, will undoubtedly leave an indomitable legacy that carries forward, enriching the lives of countless others.\n\nYou are the BEST – MOF (Marc Mofsowitz)\n\nAloha from Hawai’i, Coach B!\n\nI am glad that you are getting the recognition you deserve for everything you have done and have given to the program for all of these years! Your genuine personality and ability to care for anyone you came across truly embodies the aloha spirit in the middle of Connecticut. You have impacted countless lives and made immeasurable contributions to UCONN over the years, but I want to thank you for making a kid from Hawai’i feel right at home! I will always remember the fun facts or trivia we’d go back and forth with.\n\nThank you for everything you’ve done!\n\nMark Hinkley (08-12)\n\nCoach Andrew “Andy” Baylock, my eternal brother!\n\nI am honored and blessed to have you in my life! You are always in my prayers & thoughts due to your heavenly works! I remember during my unfortunate life changing trials and tribulations at UConn you saw me at the Co-Op and said to me “Christopher You are and will always be family no matter what, once a Husky always a Husky”, that left an everlasting impression with me and is the main reason why I proudly chose to graduate from UConn in 2013 with my Bachelor’s of Art in Communications. Andrew “Andy” Baylock , Jerry Martin, Randy Edsall, Darrell Perkins and The Lowry’s (Dan Lowry & Lisa Leary-Lowry) will always be the valuable UConn Family members to me and that will never change! I hope I can make it to see you on August 31st! If not sometime soon in 2023!\n\nI LOVE YOU TO THE MAXIMUM ANDY! GOD BLESS YOU WITH MORE LIFE, STAY BLESSED WITH SUCCESS! UNTIL I SEE YOU AGAIN! #SUPER #ANGEL #KING #ANYTHINGISPOSSIBLE #HOLYTRINITYVICTORY #BLEEDBLUE #GOHUSKIES #LOVEYOU\n\nChristopher J. Andrade-Lopes\n\n(Jim Previously Sent This Message to Coach – As Many Of Us Have Done Through The Years)\n\nCoach Baylock, May 15, 2018\n\nI’m turning 68 this year and with it comes the anniversary of my high school graduation 50 years ago but more importantly, it is the 50-year anniversary of my arrival at UCONN.\n\nI was selected to be in the “early arrival” group of freshman Husky Pups. That meant my first exposure to UCONN was with 14 freshman teammates from all over the Northeast. I think this was a 2-week program before the rest of the freshman footballers and the rest of the freshman class joined us.\n\nWhat I would like to express to you is that becoming part of the UCONN freshman football team was one of the greatest and most memorable life experiences for me.\n\nTeams normally are remembered for, and celebrate, winning. I was part of a state championship high school baseball team and I cherished that experience. We still have team reunions and celebrate our success. In high school, especially in a small town, everyone has shared and common experiences in growing up together. Most of the guys on our high school team played Little League, and Babe Ruth on the same fields. We knew each other.\n\nGetting to UCONN to meet and team with 49 guys from different backgrounds, different cities and states was exposure to a new and different dynamic. Very few of us knew one another. Pulling the various personalities and characters together into a cohesive unit was a great credit to the coaching staff. That process got us all to know one other, support each other and find a way to get along with each other. That time and experience was not only memorable but was invaluable in my maturation into adulthood.\n\nCoach, you have dedicated your career to UCONN and continue to support the program. What I am trying to say is that, for me, even without lettering or finishing in the program, there are great memories of those times and especially my teammates and coaches.\n\nThank you for reaching out to me to become a Husky and all the support you gave to me in the program and continue to give, to every Husky, today.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nJim Briggs\n\n480.319.4727 jimbriggsaz@gmail.com\n\nAndy:\n\nMany thanks for all you have done for me and many others at UConn. I couldn’t have achieved much without the guidance of folks like you. You gave all of us the confidence and determination to strive and grow through football and throughout life. Many thanks to you and your family for all your support.\n\nBill Miller\n\nHey Andy,\n\nThanks so much for being you! You have been a support and friend since my days playing for you as a frosh! Am eternally grateful for all you have done! I never forgot my Soph year when you knew I was on crutches and cast. You personally picked me up at McMahon and drove me to my Anatomy Lab class as you knew I had to get there studying to be a Physical Therapist. The snow and ice was beyond belief! I truly can say, I love you man! This is a well deserved honor and I will be flying from Wisconsin to celebrate you!\n\nJoe Corbo\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nCongratulations on such a successful career at UCONN! You have touched so many lives in a heartfelt and down to earth way! For me personally, anytime I’ve ever needed anything you have always done whatever you could. Thank you for all your years of service to UCONN athletics!\n\nMost Respectfully,\n\nScott Vibberts\n\nDear Coach Baylock,\n\nI want to extend my sincere appreciation for all the memories you have provided all of us over the years. Your tireless efforts to build a UConn football community over the last fifty years is being recognized today in ways that only express the “tip of the iceberg” in emotions we collectively share with you. We all have been blessed to have had you in our life when it counted the most and for that I am eternally grateful.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\nJim Sproul\n\nCoach Andy\n\nThank you for all the things that you’ve done for us. I appreciate all your hard work very much. You are the best. Looking forward to seeing you soon.\n\nScott Branning – 1973\n\nSome words that I thought describes Andy\n\nAndy Baylock: one of the finest human beings one is fortunate to come in contact with. He is a man of integrity, passion, humility, generosity, compassion, selflessness, and giving. Those are just some of the words that aptly describe Coach. Not only was Andy our Coach but he is a friend to all of us in every sense of the word. Coach, thanks for being you!\n\nGene Massa – 1972\n\nWalter Anderson III\n\n299 Cutty Sark Way\n\nAlpharetta, Georgia 30005\n\nAugust 15th, 2023\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nThroughout your life, you have demonstrated how much you truly love your players. We thank you for your patience and continued support. You’ve always been available to help us in our time of need. Your former players appreciate your thoughtfulness and are delighted to learn that Governor Lamont will be issuing you a proclamation from the State of Connecticut thanking you for your years of devoted and unselfish service to the students, faculty and administration of the University of Connecticut.\n\nWhat a truly awesome honor and accomplishment !!!\n\nI want to extend my hearty gratitude to you, as my mentor and coach. I appreciate how much you’ve taught me and how you’ve helped further my education in Life. You are one of three people who made a profound impact on my life.\n\nWhen I arrived at UConn during the Fall of 1966, I was a young, socially unsophisticated youth from Danielson, Connecticut. Danielson, certainly, was not known as the cradle for the birthing of college football players. All the players who proceeded me from Killingly High School, with the exception of Norm Chartier, became academically ineligible and their football careers ended. When I arrived on campus, I was determined to prove that I could become an academically sound and credible football player.\n\nWhen I met you, Coach Baylock, I learned the true definition of a “Coach”. You were an inspiration and a mentor to us as young men. You were the first coach I ever met who wasn’t just interested in how each player could contribute to the team’s success on the football field. You were interested in our success in becoming honorable, responsible and committed young men. For many of us, you were the first Christian man we met who “walked the talk”. You taught us the importance of a college education. Though we had the privilege to play football; we had an even greater opportunity and responsibility to earn an education that would determine our success in life as businessmen, husbands, fathers and grandfathers.\n\nYou taught us how to study and properly allocate time during our busy days to prepare for our classroom responsibilities. During our first week, you gave us a mimeographed chart exhibiting all 24 hours in a day. I remember saying to myself, “WOW, there is a lot of time in a day. I can and will find the time I need to succeed in my studies.” You also encouraged us to attend all our classes on a regular basis and to sit in the front row so all the professors knew who we were — that we were attentive and in attendance.\n\nI was a freshman player who never made it to the finish line — or should I say “goal line”. I was injured during our first freshman game at Boston University. As a result, I was never able to complete my aspirations to become a UCONN Huskie Football Player.\n\nThough I did not meet my goals in becoming an accomplished football player during my college career, I used your lessons to become the President of the Class of 1970, President of ARCHONS Leadership Honor Society, President of the Yankee Conference Student Government Council, recipient of the University of Connecticut U.S. Congress Intern Scholarship and received the honor of being the 1970 Killingly High School Commencement Speaker. (The high school I graduated from four years earlier.)\n\nI also thank you for submitting a letter of recommendation for me to attend law school after my UCONN college career.\n\nI am now retired; but enjoyed a successful business career. The highlight being an expert witness for a U.S. Presidential National Leadership Commission on Health Care. Though I was a player for only a short period of time, I couldn’t have come this far without your mentoring and fine example. You emphasized incorporating courage, sacrifice and humility into our character. I attempted to follow your teachings not only during college; but, throughout my adult life.\n\nYou not only positively impacted the lives of thousands of players; I am confident you also positively impacted the lives of many other non-players like me. These are the qualities of a true “COACH”.\n\nI thank you, Coach Baylock, for all you have done for me !!!\n\nBlessings to you and your Family !!!\n\nWith Respect & Admiration,\n\nWally Anderson\n\nClass of 1970\n\nCongratulations, Coach Baylock!\n\nThank you for always supporting me throughout my time at UConn and after.

As loving and kind and selfless a person as I have been fortunate to be around. What do you need? How can I help you? How great is this life? Who has it better than me/us? Those were the things that always came from Coach Baylock and they always resonated with me because they always brought positivity in any and all situations. The story telling could change any mood you’re in and brought smiles and laughter to rooms always. Appreciate you Coach Baylock, you’re a great man and a great UConn Ambassador!”\n\nDan Orlovsky 2004\n\nAndy, your impact on my life and countless others, who have played football at the University of Connecticut, is immeasurable!\n\nThank you.\n\nRasool Ahmed 1976\n\nDear Andy, Coach, Friend:\n\nCongrats to you!……..When I first arrived at UCONN it was overwhelming for me: Big Stadium, complicated plays, both on offense as well as defense, discipline to be on time, don’t be a moment late! Study Hall, plus being away from home. Make no mistake, you had to UP your game! But no matter how frustrated I got, there was always one person I could rely on to get me back on track, both, mentally and physically. Yes it was you, Andy, with your smile, pat on the back and your winning, get organized attitude! I thought of you often when I was in Viet Nam and how great it would be to get home to UCONN and ANDY B”s winning ways.\n\nTHANK YOU COACH B’ for all you have contributed to my intermittent and, yet ,prolonged stay at UCONN.\n\nVictor J Radzevich\n\nCoach B-\n\nThank you for your on-going support over the years, including your dedication to maintaining the camaraderie amongst the football alumni. There is no doubt that you are amongst the greatest in UConn athletics based on your achievements and continuous leadership. You deserve all the recognition coming your way!\n\nDan Cudgma\n\nCoach Baylock!\n\nThe G.O.A.T. There is no UConn football without you. Thank you for all you have done over the years keeping the family connected. I always look forward to your phone calls and newsletters. You are the best! Thank you for everything!\n\nLove you, Coach!\n\nLou Allen III, ’08\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nI Got a lot of Love for you and you are very appreciated. Ever since I stepped foot on this campus you have been nothing but great to me. You are truly our Husky Football Grandfather.\n\nANewsome22\n\nArkeel Newsome, 2014-2017\n\n“ Andy Baylock was a key mentor and guide for me personally. At my most trying time, after a tragic accident I can remember Andy saying, “Scaffer, you don’t have to play tonight, but I think it might do you good and I think Ralph (our Captain who was in the accident) would want you to play.” I did and we won and I was able to bring the football to Ralph who was in the hospital. I have never met a better man than Andy Baylock, period!\n\nPaul B. Scaffidi 1975\n\nVery simply, Andy genuinely cares about me and the players. Always stays in touch with his players. During my time at UConn Andy was always there for me especially when life got tough for me. It was Andy who said that I will be successful in life no matter what I endeavor to do. In this case, I joined the Marine Corps.\n\nTom Szarzynski 1976\n\nDear Coach Baylock,\n\nNo words can come close to capturing your longstanding devotion to the UConn football program and the university as a whole. I do not think the program would be where it is today without your relentless commitment to the players. Seeing you on the field and around Burton meant that someone always had our back. As a walk-on that was especially reassuring. Go Huskies.\n\nJJ Bivona – Class of 2016\n\nCoach,\n\nI just wanted to say I appreciate all that you do. Having you in your position has allowed former players like myself to stay in tune with UConn Football. With all the changes, you have been a model of consistency.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nAlfred Fincher, 2001-2004\n\nCoach, thank you for having taken an interest in all of the players at UConn and for having not wavered in your support through the years. You have had and will always have my respect and love for who you are.\n\nBlessings and Peace\n\nAndré Pastor\n\nI would be honored to attend Coach Baylock Day. Fond memories of coach. I remember as a Freshman on varsity, we would also have to play JV games. The first game, we did a double reverse on a kick off return. Last time I was involved in one of those, I was a kid playing in Fulton Park. That was Andy. He made the game fun and interesting. And no,it didn’t work. The other coach must have known Andy also.\n\nJohn Palomba 1977\n\nI will be there in person as we celebrate a foundational figure in modern UConn sports.\n\nChuck Goode 1971\n\nAndy as no surprise, was instrumental to my growing up while at UCONN under his tutelage. He was always a voice of reason and had a perspective on the “Big Picture”. Throughout the years up to and including now, he has remembered details about my profile and been receptive with open arms like it was yesterday. No-one shows how much he cares about his boys as much as Andy. He deserves everything that is planned for him and more.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJim “Zack” Olzacki\n\nI played from 1970-73. I coached as a Grad Assistant in 1974 with Andy as the Head Freshman Coach. I was the varsity receivers coach and head scout 1975. Then was a part time varsity assistant coach, receivers then outside linebackers 1982-1987. I have also had all three of Andy’s children as their guidance counselor at Edwin O. Smith High School. I knew his wife quite well. I plan on attending with my wife, Susan, who also knows Andy well. He is quite deserving of this wonderful honor.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael McCarthy 1973\n\nHey Coach,\n\nIt was always great seeing that big smile on your face walking into the facility! Thanks for all the wisdom you have shared over the years.\n\nThanks for everything!\n\nMatt McBride\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nI want to take the time to thank you for everything you have done. There are times when us older guys go through life and get so caught up with day to day activity it’s hard to think about the good ole days of winning and playing in the Rent. However Coach, you always make it a point to continue to reach out to us and let us know we are still part of of the family,\n\nLove you Coach Baylock!!\n\n– Ernest Cole, 2003-2006\n\nCoach Baylock,\n\nAppreciation for everything you’ve done for UConn. From the toughest guy in FBS history.\n\n-Kyle Williams, 2016-2019\n\nAloha – Coach Baylock, You have been an outstanding Football & Baseball coach at UConn, for many hundreds of athletes, for over 50 years.\n\nAs my 1967 Freshman football coach & then as my Varsity football coach for 3 years, You supported our teams, on & off the field. Myself & many of my teammates visit you each year at UConn. You always Remember Everyone & give us a great tour of the Football Complex. Then we watch the indoor football practice with you, at the Training Center..\n\nYou also mail out hand written cards each year, to each of us! Thank you, for your believe in us & your inspiration & friendship.\n\nAll the Best\n\nMatt Hogan, 1971\n\nPlease include me for Andy’s honoring.\n\nHe is the best of the best. Andy was an inspiration, to me, in my Coaching career. He never forgets you and is always available. He was responsible for getting me and my roommates back together. His love for his players is always strong.\n\nThank you Coach\n\nLove,\n\nRich Albonizio 68-71\n\nCoach Baylock was one of the greatest influences in my life!\n\nWes Spears\n\nAndy ‘s been such a mentor to me over the years. I’m honored to be able to attend. I played at UConn, 1975 through 78.\n\nThanks again,\n\nTony Catapano\n\nI can’t think of any better way to honor Andy who has been such a huge part of UCONN FOOTBALL as well as a man who has made impact in so many players lives over the years.\n\nLou Abare\n\nI played from 1961-63. As a student coach in ’64 (Andy’s 1st year at UCONN) I first met and worked with Andy. He was passionate about coaching and very committed to winning and it paid off. That ’64 team defeated Yale for the first time in UConn’s history. Andy came back into my life when he became the Football Alumni Coordinator. His dedication towards keeping us informed with his newsletter kept us all part o"
