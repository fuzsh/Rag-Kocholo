        "text": "Hi, I am Lori Peek. I have lived in Colorado since I was three years old and have always loved living here. I can’t imagine being anywhere else. From hiking and camping in the mountains to having beautiful changes of the seasons, it has always been a gorgeous place to live. I have been married for 32 years and have two children, a boy and a girl, whom I am very proud of. My son has blessed me with one grandchild. My Flower gardens and walks with the dogs on our farm are my happy places. Living in the country is such a blessing that I am so thankful for every day.\n\nI have been working in the school districts since 2005 in the elementary schools with children that have special needs. The joy and love comes back tenfold from these sweet children is extraordinary. Over the years they have touched my heart in so many ways that I will never be able to repay. Unfortunately, my body was telling me I needed to step back this last year and be a general education paraprofessional which has shown to be hilarious. From working one on one to watching and listening to an entire classroom of students has brought me to tears of laughter at times with how smart, clever, and funny they can be. I hope I am blessed to do this for many years to come.\n\nHello! My name is Donia Martinez. I have worked for Deer Trail School for the past 5 years. In my time at Deer Trail, I’ve worked as a Kindergarten Paraprofessional, 1st Grade Teacher and finally Kindergarten Teacher.\n\nI truly love Kindergarten and seeing the amazing growth and progress that is made.\n\nMy favorite subject to teach is Reading and I love being creative with different crafts throughout the year.\n\nIn my spare time I enjoy spending time with my husband and 3 children. When we aren’t attending our children’s sporting events we enjoy traveling and camping.\n\nI look forward to teaching your child and getting to know your family.\n\nMy family and I moved to Deer Trail in September of 2014. At the time I was working from home. When my son was about to start school full-time, I decided to look for a job outside of the home, but wanted to stay as close to Deer Trail as possible. I was told about a new position that would be available when the new school opened, I applied, was interviewed and here I am! I started working at Deer Trail Schools when we moved into the new building for the 2019-2020 school year. I absolutely love my job and the interactions that I have with the students, parents and staff. I am very gratefully that I have been given the opportunity to be a part of this organization.\n\nMy name is Amanda Clayton. I have three children, two boys and one girl: Raylan, Evelyn, and Tristan. I grew up in Byers, CO in a large family of seven siblings. My parents had a few animals, and my grandfather owned a large farm, which was family operated, raising wheat and buffalo. I spent a lot of time on the farm and developed a passion for agriculture. I spent every summer as a combine operator for wheat harvest in my younger years and still try to get out to the farm as much as possible.\n\nI graduated Byers High School in 2007 with both my high school diploma and an associate degree from Morgan Community College. I continued my education at Colorado State University where I dabbled in several majors before I found my interest in Agriculture Education. I graduated from CSU in 2011. In 2018, I received my endorsement for elementary education. I received my master’s degree from CSU Global in Teaching Leadership in 2022. I began teaching in 2018. I spent two years teaching 6th Grade, then moved into my current position as the agriculture teacher and FFA advisor. Deer Trail offers three different pathways in Agriculture Education: animal systems, plant systems, and power, structure, and technical systems. I love all of the pathways but my favorite pathway to teach is animal systems, which, like many of the pathways, is relevant to all students because we all have pets. Other pathways are relevant as well; plant systems include landscape design and greenhouse and PSTS includes basic skills in electrical, engines, plumbing, and metals.\n\nHello, my name is Krista Rector, I have been teaching at Deer Trail High School since the Fall of 1995. I am currently teaching high school business and computer education classes, LifeSkills/Home Economics, Yearbook, as well as middle school computers. I also teach Introduction to PC Applications for Morgan Community College, allowing our students to gain not only their high school credit, but also their college credit for this class. I am the Deer Trail Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) Advisor. I have had many other jobs over the course of the years here at Deer Trail.\n\nI graduated from the University of Wyoming in the Fall of 1994 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Education at the secondary level. I currently hold a valid Professional Teacher License in the State of Colorado – Endorsed in: Secondary Business Education and Secondary – CTE Business Pathways and CTE Information Technology. I also have a Masters in Education – Integrating Technology in the Classroom from Walden University, received April 2006.\n\nHello, my name is Jo Sickendick but my favorite people call me Mrs. S. I am starting my fifth year in fourth grade at Deer Trail Elementary. I am also the data coordinator for our district and love seeing our students’ academic growth! I have a master’s degree in Teaching and Learning with a specialization in English language learning. My favorite subject is Math but I really enjoy teaching Colorado History.\n\nMy husband and I have a hobby farm where we tend bees and pretend to grow things. He is a professor and teaches criminal justice at the Community College of Denver. Our children- Gillian and Gage- are both in college. I’m the only one still in elementary school!\n\nI’m very excited to get to know this year’s Fantastic Fourth Graders!\n\nI came from Ketchikan, Alaska to the Denver area in July of 1999 with my family. While living at the KOA and looking for housing (because I refused to live in a big city again after growing up in Houston, TX), I interviewed in Strasburg for their advertised Third Grade position. However, in true I-70 Corridor tradition, they chose to go with their hometown girl and steal her away from Deer Trail’s Third Grade the few weeks before the start of school. Thank you, Mr. Rasp for forwarding my application information to Deer Trail Schools, because it is here that I have found my place in a fantastic educational family!\n\nThis August is the beginning of my 25th year (I know I’m not Mr. Dille or Mrs. Rector) teaching in Deer Trail Schools. Since that blessed August in the last century, I have filled many spaces within our system. I taught third grade for a while. Then I started my specializing in Reading Interventions for Title I and Accelerated Reader (AR) Librarian for a few years. When the AR Library passed away to make room for another service, I started my Title I /Art combination. After spending a few years in MS Math and Science, I am now back in the Title I / Art position. I have taken many students that are now elementary parents on their Senior Trips out of state and once out of country. Talk about exciting!\n\nMy four wonderful “home kids” grew up and graduated from Deer Trail. I am so proud of my successful Line Tech Supervisor at Colorado Air and Space Port, my adventurous Frontier flight attendant, my Mr. Fix-it Mechanical Engineer and home mechanic, and my RN Night Charge Nurse. They got their good foundation for success from DTHS! DT ALL DAY!\n\nNow my home is full of puppies as I Doodle in Doodles (pun intended)! I have been looking at retiring from education for a while now, but each year I haven’t been ready to say good-bye to all the wonderful adults that I work with here, but mostly it’s been the precious kids in our school that I don’t want to leave. Thank you for sharing them with us!\n\nHello and welcome to science! I have been a science teacher with Deer Trail school district since 2018, teaching many subjects for grades 7-12 science. I currently teach biology I and II, chemistry, earth science, physical science and middle school STEM. My educational journey began by completing a BS in Animal Science, and minor in German at Colorado State University in 1996. I then completed my MS in Cell and Molecular Biology at CSU in 1999. Following graduation, I worked for 10+ years as a laboratory manager in a University of Colorado research laboratory and then 8 years as a biology instructor at Colorado Community Colleges Online. My primary goal in teaching science at Deer Trail is to help students learn the fundamental concepts of science and understand how they apply to everyday issues and to their daily lives. Outside of school, I spend most of my time with my husband and five children working on gardening, canning, raising various animals (chickens, turkeys, and honeybees), and attending school academic or athletics events. I also volunteer as a 4H leader in Arapahoe County.\n\nI started teaching at the Deer Trail School in 1975. I started teaching Science and PE. I continued to teach both but for many years it was mostly science.\n\nI have coached every sport except volleyball through the years with football being the one that I spent the most years at. I ran and took care of the school swimming pool from the time it was built until it was torn down. I enjoyed teaching hundreds of kids from the I-70 corridor to swim.\n\nI retired some years ago but have either substituted or taught full-time since that time. I enjoy interacting with the students and the school staff and I love teaching.\n\nOut of school I enjoy spending time with my family. I have 6 kids who all graduated from Deer Trail and received an excellent education. I enjoy all kinds of sports and outdoor activities and I enjoy spending time with a good book. I have served as a fireman and EMT with the Deer Trail Fire Department for 40 years and am still active with the department.\n\nI will be teaching middle school science this year and I hope I am up to the challenge. It is always my goal to help my students become interested in learning how the world around them works and wanting to know more.\n\nThe classes will study Earth, life and physical science at different levels depending on the class they are in.\n\nMy name is Coach Lindsay McBean. I have been coaching youth basketball for 22 years. I began playing basketball in fourth grade and have been in love with the game ever since. Unfortunately, I was injured in high school repeatedly and ended up having 5 surgeries on my right knee, ruining my college basketball aspirations. After working for my masters degree in physical education, I went back to earn additional credits and played college basketball at Nassau Community College. There, I became the number #9 three-point shooter in the country and gained invaluable experience training with a semi-pro team in Costa Rica. I have since continued to coach club AAU teams and train young athletes to help them accomplish their dreams. I believe basketball is a wonderful game and can be used as a tool to get into excellent colleges and develop various soft skills that are essential to all responsible working adults.\n\nPlease reach out to me to see how I may assist your athlete become the best they can be.\n\nMy journey towards becoming an elementary educator started at Air Academy High school when I was accepted into the Teacher Cadet program licensed by the Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention, and Advancement (CERRA). 4 years later, I graduated from UCCS in May of 2023 with a bachelor’s in inclusive elementary education; in addition, I earned my Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Education (CLDE) endorsement through my university program. Currently, I am working to enhance my qualifications by applying for a supplementary endorsement in special education. While in college, I student-taught 5th grade and developed a multitude of foundational skills that have helped me transition into my first year teaching 1st grade here at Deer Trail. I was born in Monument, Colorado and grew up in a very woodsy area where I spent a lot of time outdoors and fell in love with our beautiful state. In 2014, I moved to the city of Colorado Springs and remained there while I attended college.\n\nRecently, I have moved to Deer Trail and couldn’t be more at home thanks to the wonderful community of people that reside here. Re-locating to teach at Deer Trail has been the step in my life that I have been looking forward to ever since I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in education.\n\nHi DT Families!

I have been working in education for a year. I am new to teaching but I am extremely dedicated to this position and ensuring my students have an amazing year!

Go eagles!\n\n7 Years basketball\n\n· 6 years coaching MS basketball in Japan\n\no My basketball coaching career started the first year I moved to Japan in 2012. I took over a middle program that had no idea what success looked like until we went to the city-wide tournament for the first time in a decade. I stayed at that school for 3 years, then moved to a different city where again I became a basketball coach for a middle school that had struggled for years. That same year we made the final four in the biggest city tournament, which had not been done for quite some time. Although the culture between America and Japan are completely different, basketball is basketball wherever you go. It was a learning experience for me that I will never take for granted, and one that I plan on using for my vision for our basketball program here at Deer Trail.\n\n1 Year Track and Field for HS\n\n– I am very proud of all of the work the athletes have put in for this program. Their hard work and dedication to our collective vision for where we want track and field at Deer Trail to be goes unnoticed on a daily basis. Our culture for this team has been set and will only continue to grow as we grow in numbers as a team and mature as young men and women. Our program has strong connections to those outside of this school that can help our athletes achieve the greatness that this community deserves.\n\n· 1 Year as HS Head Coach and MS Assistant\n\nMicheal Jobman graduated from the University of Nebraska at Kearney with his Bachelor of Arts degree in Physical Education and Health and his Master of Arts degree in Educational Administration from Hamline University in St. Paul Minnesota. He has over 25 years of coaching experience in basketball track, cross country, and baseball at schools in 3 different states. Mike is the 2023 1A Athletic Director of the year and currently serves as the region 10 representative on the CHSAA board of directors. His wide range of experience has taught him valuable lessons that shaped him into the leader he is. One of his goals for the Deer Trail Athletic Department is to continue to foster competitive excellence across each program. He aims to continue to improve our facilities and give athletes a transformative and impactful experience as they grow into future leaders."
