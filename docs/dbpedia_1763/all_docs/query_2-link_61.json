The select few who are elected for induction represents the very best the University of Oregon has to offer and who have brought honor to themselves and teammates. Each spring the selection committee reviews the candidates, with all nominees' eligibility for induction commencing 10 years following their departure from the University.\n\nPlaques honoring each of the inductees and their achievements are permanently displayed as part of the University's Hall of Champions, located on the second floor of the Len Casanova Athletic Center.\n\nThe athletic showcase is open to the public free of charge weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nTwenty-seven individuals and three teams were included among the Hall of Fame's inaugural class of inductees in 1992.\n\nHall of Fame at a Glance\n\nAddress: 2727 Leo Harris Pkwy. Eugene, OR\n\nLocation: Second floor of the Casanova Center\n\nOpened: 1992\n\nTrivia: The Hall of Fame houses the oldest known duck mascot costume in existence."
