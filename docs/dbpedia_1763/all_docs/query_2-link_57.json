        "text": "Edwin Ortiz starts his first season as an assistant coach on the Georgia State volleyball staff. Ortiz was born in Manhattan, N.Y., and grew up in Miami, Fla. He became one of the first students to accept a men’s volleyball scholarship at Mater Academy Charter in Hialeah Gardens, Fla. In 2009, he started his collegiate career at Warner University. In 2011, Ortiz transitioned to collegiate coaching at Emmanuel College as the recruiting coordinator and the assistant coach for the fi rst ever women’s volleyball program. During his time at Emmanuel the lions tallied up 64 wins to only 40 losses.\n\nWhile at Emmanuel, Ortiz also helped start the fi rst men’s volleyball program in the state of Georgia. During his two seasons with the men’s program he helped with recruiting and operations. In only their second season the Lions were able to climb into the top 10 poll of the NAIA. Besides coaching at Emmanuel, Ortiz coached club volleyball at A5 south for 2 years.\n\nThanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"
