        "text": "Final Bio (PDF)\n\nAfter a storied 13 seasons as head coach of the Michigan State football program, Mark Dantonio announced his retirement on Feb. 4, 2020. Dantonio finished his career with a record of 114-57 in East Lansing, 132-74 in 16 seasons overall. During his time at the helm of the Spartan program, Dantonio compiled an impressive list of accomplishments including three Big Ten Championships, two victories in the Big Ten Championship Game, victories in the 2014 Rose Bowl and the 2015 Cotton Bowl, and an appearance in the 2015 College Football Playoff, finishing his career as the winningest football coach in Michigan State history.\n\nDantonio was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2024.\n\nBeyond his record for most victories at MSU, Dantonio won more Big Ten Championships (three) and bowl games (six) than any other coach in school history, while also ranking first with 12 bowl appearances. His .639 (69-39) winning percentage in Big Ten games is a school record, while he stands tied for first in AP Top 25 finishes (seven) and second in Big Ten wins (69), home wins (67) and AP Top 25 wins (21).\n\nDantonio’s tenure also placed him among the best football coaches in Big Ten history. He retired as one of just seven Big Ten coaches to have at least six 10-win seasons on their resume (Bo Schembechler, Michigan; Jim Tressel, Ohio State; Joe Paterno, Penn State; Lloyd Carr, Michigan; Urban Meyer, Ohio State; Kirk Ferentz, Iowa) and one of four to have at least five 11-win seasons (Tressel, Paterno, Meyer). Dantonio finished his career ranked No. 11 in the Big Ten record books in both overall wins (114) and Big Ten wins (69). With MSU’s win in the 2019 Pinstripe Bowl, Dantonio secured his sixth bowl victory, tying him for fourth most in Big Ten history (Joe Paterno, 10; Barry Alvarez and Kirk Ferentz, 9; Hayden Fry and Lloyd Carr, 6).\n\nA two-time Big Ten Coach of the Year (2010, 2013), Dantonio led Michigan State to Top 25 finishes seven times (2008: No. 24 in both polls; 2010: No. 14 in both polls; 2011: No. 10 USA TODAY/No. 11 AP; 2013: No. 3 in both polls; 2014: No. 5 in both polls; 2015: No. 6 in both polls; 2017: No. 15 AP/No. 16 USA TODAY). Dantonio’s seven AP Top-25 finishes tied for first in school history (Daugherty’s teams posted seven Top-25 finishes during his 19-year tenure from 1954-72). MSU was the only school to finish in the top-six of the national polls from 2013-15 (No. 3 in 2013, No. 5 in 2014, No. 6 in 2015) and the 36 wins from 2013-15 marked the winningest three-year stretch in the history of the program.\n\nThe 2010s decade was the greatest in Michigan State history based on total wins, as the Spartans posted a 92-40 (.697) record from 2010-19. During that span, MSU won six bowl games (2012 Outback, 2012 Buffalo Wild Wings, 2014 Rose, 2015 Cotton, 2017 Holiday, 2019 Pinstripe), three Big Ten Championships (2010, 2013, 2015) and three Big Ten Division titles (2011, 2013, 2015). The 92 wins were the seventh-most ever by any Big Ten team in a decade and the six bowl wins tied for second most by any Big Ten program in a decade.\n\nDantonio made history by becoming the first Big Ten coach to record five 11-win seasons in a six-year span following MSU’s 12-win campaign in 2015 (11 in 2010; 11 in 2011; school-record 13 in 2013; 11 in 2014; 12 in 2015). His five 11-win seasons were tied for third most in Big Ten history during the time of his retirement. Prior to Dantonio’s arrival, MSU had not recorded an 11-win season in its history, and had just two 10-win seasons (1965, 1999).\n\nMichigan State played in a school-record nine consecutive bowl games from 2007-15 (2007 Champs Sports Bowl, 2009 Capital One Bowl, 2010 Alamo Bowl, 2011 Capital One Bowl, 2012 Outback Bowl, 2012 Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl, 2014 Rose Bowl, 2015 Cotton Bowl, 2015 College Football Playoff Semifinal at Cotton Bowl). Dantonio extended his school record with his 12th bowl game appearance in 2019 in the Pinstripe Bowl; he finished 6-6 in bowl games at Michigan State, including a school-record four-game winning streak (2012 Outback, 2012 Buffalo Wild Wings, 2014 Rose, 2015 Cotton).\n\nDantonio helped develop 10 different first-team All-Americans and 12 selections overall: RB Javon Ringer (2008); LB Greg Jones (2009-10); DT Jerel Worthy (2011); RB Le’Veon Bell (2012); CB Darqueze Dennard and P Mike Sadler (2013); S Kurtis Drummond (2014); C Jack Allen (2014-15); OT Jack Conklin (2015); and DE Kenny Willekes (2018). In addition, Dantonio helped produce 41 first-team All-Big Ten selections.\n\nThirty-one Spartans were chosen in the NFL Draft under Dantonio’s watch, including three consecutive first-round selections from 2014-16. Dennard was a 2013 unanimous All-America selection and also won the Jim Thorpe Award, which is given annually to the nation’s best defensive back. He was selected in the first round of the 2014 NFL Draft (No. 24 overall) by the Cincinnati Bengals to become the first Spartan under Dantonio to be chosen in the first round. Cornerback Trae Waynes was selected in the first round by the Minnesota Vikings at No. 11 overall in 2015. Michigan State became just the sixth school to have cornerbacks selected in the first round of the NFL Draft in consecutive years, joining Alabama (2012-13), LSU (2011-12), Miami-Florida (2005-06), Ohio State (1999-2001) and Notre Dame (1993-94). In 2016, offensive tackle Jack Conklin became the highest Spartan drafted under Dantonio as he was chosen No. 8 overall by the Tennessee Titans, and went on earn AP All-Pro honors as a rookie. The Spartans had six players drafted in 2012, the most in the Dantonio era, and five in 2016.\n\nDantonio won his 110th game as head coach at Michigan State with a 31-10 victory over Northwestern on Sept. 21, 2019, surpassing Hall of Fame Coach Duffy Daugherty for the most wins in school history. Dantonio had 11 winning seasons in his 13 years in East Lansing, tying Daugherty for the most winning seasons by a Spartan head coach.\n\nA Zanesville, Ohio, native with Midwest ties, Dantonio spent 40 years in collegiate coaching, including 16 seasons as a head coach and 19 seasons in East Lansing (served as the Spartan secondary coach from 1995-2000). Dantonio won his school-record third Big Ten Championship in 2015 with a 16-13 victory over previously undefeated and fourth-ranked Iowa that sent Michigan State to the College Football Playoff. He became MSU’s second all-time winningest coach with his 71st victory on Oct. 25, 2014, against Michigan. He won his 100th career game as a head coach in dramatic fashion on Oct. 17, 2015, at Michigan Stadium as the Spartans rallied to defeat the Wolverines, 27-23, on a 38-yard fumble return as time expired. Dantonio coached the second-most games of any Spartan head coach in school history (Daugherty: 183; Dantonio: 171).\n\nFrom the moment he stepped on campus, Dantonio was equally committed to success in the classroom. In his 13 seasons, a total of 238 players earned their undergraduate degrees. In addition, 219 Spartans earned Academic All-Big Ten honors, including nine Academic All-America selections (Blair White, 2009 second team; Mike Sadler, 2014 first team, 2013 first team, 2012 second team, 2011 second team; Max Bullough, 2013 first team, 2012 second team; Cole Chewins, 2017 first team, 2018 second team). In addition, the football program posted its all-time high GSR (graduation success rate) of 90 percent in the NCAA figures that were released in October 2019 (graduation rates for classes 2009-12).\n\nIn addition to Dantonio’s numerous accomplishments as head football coach at Michigan State, he was an active member of the Mid-Michigan community. Dantonio and his wife, Becky, hosted a women’s football clinic nearly every year of his tenure, with proceeds going to local charities. The Dantonios hosted an excellence clinic held in April 2018 to benefit Lansing Promise, a scholarship program offering tuition assistance for post-secondary (college or skilled trade) education to all eligible high school graduates within the Lansing School District boundaries. Dantonio was named honorary chairman of the Children’s Miracle Network at the Sparrow Children Center’s in Lansing in 2009 and played an integral role in helping children throughout the Mid-Michigan region get the medical care they needed. Dantonio and his staff also hosted CMN telethons that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. He also played a role in getting the Spartans to visit elementary and middle schools throughout Lansing as part of the city’s Lansing Promise campaign.\n\nFor his work in the community, Dantonio received the 2016 Gene Stallings Award, which is given annually to college football head coaches who are also humanitarians and strive to promote healthy, vibrant communities through charitable and community service efforts. Dantonio was also named a 2015 finalist for the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, which annually honors the coach of a team with a successful season on the field and equally as important, stresses the importance of academic excellence and desire to give back to the community.\n\nUnder Dantonio, Spartan teams produced some of the longest winning streaks in school history. MSU’s 13-game Big Ten winning streak from 2012-14 was its second-longest conference run, while MSU’s 12-game winning streak that began on Nov. 15, 2014, and ended on Nov. 7, 2015, was tied for the third longest in school history. Dantonio also had an 11-game winning streak during the 2013-14 seasons. In addition, Michigan State produced a 67-24 record (.736) in home games from 2007-19, including four undefeated home seasons (2010, 2011, 2013, 2015).\n\nThe Spartans consistently produced victories against highly ranked teams under Dantonio. MSU defeated 21 AP Top-25 teams in his tenure, including 10 in the Top 10. The Spartans twice stopped the two longest winning streaks in Ohio State history (snapped school-record 24-game winning streak over the No. 2 Buckeyes in the 2013 Big Ten Championship Game; snapped 23-game winning streak over the defending National Champion and second-ranked Buckeyes on Nov. 21, 2015, in Ohio Stadium). MSU also had AP Top 10 wins over No. 4 Iowa (2015 season), No. 4 Baylor (2014), No. 4 Wisconsin (2011), No. 5 Stanford (2013), No. 7 Oregon (2015), No. 7 Michigan (2017), No. 7 Penn State (2017) and No. 8 Penn State (2018) under Dantonio.\n\nDantonio finished 8-5 overall (.615) vs. Michigan, the highest winning percentage of any Spartan coach against the Wolverines (previous: Daugherty at .579 with 10-7-2 record). The Spartans defeated Michigan eight times during a 10-game span from 2008 to 2017, the best 10-game stretch in program history.\n\nKnown as one of the top defensive minds in the country, Dantonio and his staff assembled one of the most consistently productive defenses in the FBS, year in and year out. The Spartans finished in the FBS Top 10 in total defense six times under Dantonio (2011-14, 2017-18) and were the only team to rank in the NCAA FBS Top 10 in total defense from 2011-14 (No. 6 in 2011, No. 4 in 2012, No. 2 in 2013, No. 8 in 2014).\n\nStopping the run was the main theme for MSU, and it led to ranking No. 1 in the FBS in rushing defense in 2018, allowing just 77.9 yards per game. It marked the second time MSU led the nation in rushing defense under Dantonio (2014, 81.3 ypg.) and the sixth time in the top 10 (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018). Since the Big Ten began awarding stat champions in all games in 1985, Michigan State (2011-14) became only the second team in conference history to lead the league in rushing defense four years in a row. The Spartans were ranked in the FBS Top 25 in rushing defense nine times in Dantonio’s last 11 seasons, including a run of five straight years in the top 11 (2011-15) and back-to-back in the top-two (No. 2 in 2017 at 95.3 ypg.; No. 1 in 2018 at 77.9 ypg.). MSU led the Big Ten in rushing defense six times, and total defense and scoring defense three times in the Dantonio era.\n\nBrief year-by-year look at Dantonio's career at MSU:\n\n2019: 7-6 (Pinstripe Bowl Champions)\n\nMichigan State closed the 2019 season on a three-game winning streak and finished the decade and Dantonio era with a 27-21 victory over Wake Forest in the New Era Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium. It marked Dantonio’s sixth bowl win, tying him for fourth all-time in Big Ten history.\n\nDantonio became MSU’s all-time winningest coach on Sept. 21 at Northwestern with his 110th victory, surpassing Duffy Daugherty. Dantonio tied Daugherty on Sept. 7 after defeating Western Michigan in Spartan Stadium.\n\nThe Spartans finished ranked among the FBS Top 20 leaders in rushing defense (16th, 113.8 ypg) and total defense (18th, 321.6 ypg). Senior defensive end Kenny Willekes won the 2019 Burlsworth Trophy, which is presented to the nation’s most outstanding player who began his career as a walk-on, and earned first-team All-Big Ten honors for the second year in a row. Willekes also picked up second-team All-America accolades from the Walter Camp Football Foundation. Quarterback Brian Lewerke set single-season (3,442 yards) and career records for total offense (9,548 yards) and was named the MVP of the Pinstripe Bowl.\n\n2018: 7-6 (Redbox Bowl)\n\nThe Spartans posted a winning record (7-6) for the 10th time under Dantonio and earned the program’s 11th bowl invitation in the past 12 seasons with a trip to the Redbox Bowl in Santa Clara, California. MSU went 5-4 in Big Ten play, including a victory at No. 8 Penn State, and claimed the program’s 700th all-time win by topping Maryland in College Park on Nov. 3.\n\nMichigan State featured one of the best defenses in the nation, finishing No. 1 in the FBS in rushing defense (77.9 ypg.), No. 8 in scoring defense (17.2 ppg.) and No. 10 in total defense (303.2 ypg.). The Spartans led the Big Ten in both rushing defense and scoring defense. It marked the fourth time Michigan State has ranked in the FBS Top 10 in total defense, scoring defense and rushing defense in the same season under Dantonio (2011, 2012, 2013, 2018). Junior defensive end Kenny Willekes earned first-team All-America honors and was named the Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year after leading the Big Ten with 20.5 tackles for loss. Two Spartans were selected in the 2019 NFL Draft: CB Justin Layne (Pittsburgh, third round) and S Khari Willis (Indianapolis, fourth round).\n\n2017: 10-3, 7-2 Big Ten (Holiday Bowl Champions, Final Ranking: No. 15/16)\n\nMichigan State, which finished the 2017 season with a 10-3 record and a 42-17 victory in the Holiday Bowl over No. 18 Washington State, was ranked No. 15 in the final Associated Press Poll and No. 16 in the final Amway Coaches Poll. MSU's seven-game win improvement from 2016 established a school record for the biggest turnaround in program history. It marked the seventh time Michigan State finished in the national rankings under Dantonio.\n\nFor the fourth time in his career, Dantonio was named a semifinalist for the George Munger Coach of the Year Award in 2017. The Spartans recorded double-digit wins for just the eighth time in school history -- and the sixth time under Dantonio -- after thrashing Washington State in the Holiday Bowl for their 10th win of the season, which was also Dantonio's 100th victory as head coach of the Spartans. MSU also defeated two AP Top 10 teams (No. 7 Michigan on Oct. 7; No. 7 Penn State on Nov. 4) and finished 7-2 in Big Ten play, tied for second in the East Division standings. According to the NCAA, the Spartans played the 13th toughest schedule in the Football Bowl Subdivision, as their opponents had a combined record of 86-59 (.593). Dantonio and his staff accomplished all of this despite having one of the youngest teams in the nation, with nearly 80 underclassmen on the roster.\n\nThe resurgent Spartans were led by one of the best defenses in the country. Michigan State closed out 2017 ranked among the FBS leaders in rushing defense (No. 2 at 95.3 ypg), total defense (No. 7 at 297.6 ypg), first-downs defense (No. 9 at 206), pass efficiency defense (No. 17 with 113.5 rating), third-down defense (No. 18 at .328) and scoring defense (No. 19 at 20.0 ppg).\n\nMichigan State finished No. 7 in the FBS in total defense (297.6), marking the fifth time the Spartans have finished in the FBS Top 10 in total defense under Dantonio (No. 6 in 2011, No. 4 in 2012, No. 2 in 2013, No. 8 in 2014, No. 7 in 2017). The Spartans also led the Big Ten in rushing defense for the fifth time in the Dantonio era (2011-14, 2017) and ranked No. 2 in the FBS, allowing just 95.3 yards per game. Michigan State has finished in the FBS Top 10 in rushing defense five times under Dantonio and seven times in the Top 25.\n\nA total of 18 Michigan State players earned All-Big Ten recognition in 2017, including sophomore safety David Dowell, who was named first-team All-Big Ten by the media. Eleven of MSU's 18 honorees were underclassmen (seven sophomores, two redshirt freshman, two true freshmen). Sophomore quarterback Brian Lewerke, who was named the Offensive MVP of the Holiday Bowl, set school sophomore records for total offense (3,352 yards), passing yards (2,793), passing attempts (417) and passing completions (246). Fellow sophomore linebacker Joe Bachie was named the team's MVP (Governor's Award) after leading the team with 100 tackles, becoming the first Spartan sophomore to win the award since Drew Stanton in 2004. Senior center Brian Allen, who anchored Michigan State's offensive line, was selected in the fourth round of the 2018 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams, keeping MSU's 78-year draft streak alive.\n\n2016: 3-9\n\nFeaturing one of the youngest teams in the nation, Michigan State finished the 2016 season with a 3-9 overall record. Due to a combination of youth and injuries, MSU had a different starting lineup in every game of the season on both offense and defense. Several Spartans stepped into new and expanded roles, as the offense and defense combined to feature 26 players who either started for the first time or were in their first full-time starting role. In addition, MSU's 21 first-time starters ranked tied for 10th most in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision in 2016.\n\nMSU had nine players receive All-Big Ten recognition in 2016, including second-team selections DE Malik McDowell and WR R.J. Shelton. McDowell was chosen in the second round of the NFL Draft by Seattle (No. 35 overall); Michigan State is the only Big Ten school to have a player selected in the top 35 picks of the NFL Draft the past four years. Junior safety Montae Nicholson was drafted in the fourth round by Washington.\n\n2015: 12-2, 7-1 Big Ten (2015 Big Ten Champions, College Football Playoff, Final Ranking: No. 6)\n\nMichigan State, which finished the 2015 season with the second-most wins in school history (12-2 record), won the Big Ten Championship for the second time in three years and reached the College Football Playoff, closed the season ranked No. 6 in the final Associated Press and USA TODAY/Amway Coaches Polls, marking its third straight Top 10 finish -- a program first since 1955-57 (No. 2 in 1955; No. 9 in 1956; No. 3 in 1957).\n\nMichigan State won its second Big Ten Championship in three years and ninth in school history with a 16-13 victory over No. 4 Iowa on Dec. 5. It marked Dantonio's third Big Ten Championship (2010, 2013, 2015), establishing a school record.\n\nMSU defeated nine bowl teams, including four wins over AP Top 25 teams (No. 7 Oregon on Sept. 12, No. 12 Michigan on Oct. 17, No. 2 Ohio State on Nov. 21, No. 4 Iowa on Dec. 5). It marked the first time in school history the Spartans beat three AP Top-10 teams (No. 7 Oregon, No. 2 Ohio State, No. 4 Iowa) in the same season. MSU also topped Western Michigan, Air Force, Central Michigan, Indiana and Penn State, who all played in the postseason. In the final AP rankings, MSU defeated four Top 25 teams (No. 4 Ohio State, No. 9 Iowa, No. 12 Michigan, No. 19 Oregon).\n\nFor the third year in a row, MSU led the Big Ten in turnover margin (+1.00), which also ranked fourth best in the FBS. The Spartans also ranked among the FBS Top 25 in rushing defense (11th at 116.0 ypg.), sacks (23rd at 2.64 pg.) and scoring defense (25th at 21.7 ppg.).\n\nMichigan State had its school-record four-game bowl winning streak snapped with a loss to National Champion Alabama in the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic on Dec. 31.\n\nDantonio was named a finalist for three major national coach of the year awards in 2015 (Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year: Bobby Dodd Foundation and Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl; George Munger Award: Maxwell Football Club; Eddie Robinson Award: Football Writers Association of America).\n\nWith a 43-11 record, the 2015 senior class finished their careers as the winningest senior class in school history (previous record: 42 wins in 2013 and 2014). The 23-member 2015 senior class was a part of three bowl wins (2012 Buffalo Wild Wings, 2014 Rose, 2015 Cotton), two Big Ten division titles (2013, 2015) and two Big Ten Championships (2013, 2015).\n\nFive Michigan State players were named to the All-Big Ten First Team in 2015 and a total of 16 Spartans received all-conference recognition. The five first-team selections by the coaches matched Ohio State for the most of any school in the conference, and the four first-team honorees on offense were the most in the league. The five first-team All-Big Ten selections tied for the second most first-team All-Big Ten selections under Dantonio (six in 2013; five in 2014 and 2012).\n\nTwo Spartans took home individual awards, as senior Aaron Burbridge was named the Richter-Howard Big Ten Receiver of the Year and fifth-year senior Connor Cook was selected the Griese-Brees Quarterback of the Year. It marked the second year in a row a Spartan has won the Receiver of the Year (Tony Lippett, 2014). Cook also was named recipient of the 2015 Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, which has been given to the nation's top college quarterback annually since 1987, and became the first player to win the Big Ten Championship Game MVP twice. He finished his career as the winningest quarterback in school history (34-5 record) and set program records for most TD passes (71), passing yards (9,194) and total offense (9,403 yards).\n\nAllen, Burbridge, Conklin, Cook and fifth-year defensive end Shilique Calhoun were first-team All-Big Ten selections by both the coaches and media. Calhoun became the first Spartan defensive lineman in school history to earn first-team honors three times and just the eighth player at MSU to garner first-team accolades on at least three occasions.\n\nIn addition, Allen (Associated Press, CBS Sports, SI.com) and Conklin (Sporting News, USA TODAY) were named first-team All-Americans, while Calhoun earned second-team honors for the third year in a row from numerous organizations.\n\n2014: 11-2, 7-1 Big Ten (2015 Cotton Bowl Champions, Final Ranking: No. 5)\n\nMichigan State, which capped off an 11-2 season with a dramatic comeback win over fourth-ranked Baylor in the 2015 Cotton Bowl Classic, finished the 2014 season ranked No. 5 in the final Associated Press and USA TODAY/Amway Coaches Polls. MSU's 20-point comeback win over Baylor (trailed 41-21 entering the fourth quarter) in the 2015 Cotton Bowl Classic was the biggest in Spartan postseason history (previous: down 16-0 at halftime to Georgia in the 2012 Outback Bowl). In addition, it marked the second-largest comeback win in Cotton Bowl Classic history (22 points by Notre Dame in 1979; the Irish trailed 34-12 with 7:37 left in the fourth quarter and rallied to defeat Houston, 35-34).\n\nThe 2014 Spartans featured the most prolific offense in school history to go along with another Top 10 defense. Michigan State set school single-season records for points (559), total offense (6,510 yards; 500.8 yards per game), offensive touchdowns (70), rushing touchdowns (44), scoring average (43.0 points per game), rushing yards (3,057) and first downs (321). MSU ranked second in the Big Ten and seventh in the FBS in scoring, averaging a school-record 43.0 points per game, and also ranked second in the Big Ten and 11th in the FBS in total offense, averaging a program-best 500.8 yards per game. The Spartans were balanced offensively, ranking No. 1 in the Big Ten in passing offense (265.6 ypg.) and fifth in the Big Ten and 19th in the FBS in rushing offense (235.3 ypg.).\n\nIn addition to leading the FBS in rushing defense (88.5 ypg.) and ranking eighth in total defense (315.8 ypg.), MSU also ranked No. 1 in the nation in time of possession (35:21) and No. 2 in turnover margin (+1.46).\n\nMichigan State defeated five bowl-bound teams in 2014, with victories over No. 19 Nebraska, Maryland, Rutgers, Penn State and No. 4 Baylor, and beat Michigan for the sixth time in the past seven seasons. MSU's only two losses were against the two teams in the inaugural College Football Playoff Championship Game (Oregon and Ohio State). The Spartans continued their impressive run in Big Ten games, finishing 7-1 in conference play and second in the Big Ten East Division.\n\nFive Michigan State players were named to the All-Big Ten First Team and a total of 14 Spartans received all-conference recognition. The five first-team selections by the coaches were the most of any school in the conference.\n\nTwo Spartans took home individual awards, as Drummond was named the Tatum-Woodson Big Ten Defensive Back of the Year, while Lippett was selected the Richter-Howard Big Ten Receiver of the Year. It marked the second straight year a Spartan has won the Big Ten Defensive Back of the Year Award (Dennard, 2013).\n\nAllen, Calhoun, Drummond, Lippett and Waynes were first-team selections by both the coaches and media. Michigan State has had two defensive backs on the All-Big Ten First Team each year the past four seasons (Johnny Adams and Trenton Robinson in 2011; Adams and Dennard in 2012; Dennard and Drummond in 2013).\n\nFour Spartans were selected in the 2015 NFL Draft: Waynes (Minnesota, first round), running back Jeremy Langford (Chicago, fourth round), Lippett (Miami, fifth round), and wide receiver Keith Mumphery (Houston, fifth round).\n\n2013: 13-1, 8-0 Big Ten (2014 Rose Bowl Champions, Big Ten Champions, Final Ranking: No. 3)\n\nMichigan State had a record-setting season in 2013, winning a school-record 13 games, defeating No. 5 Stanford in the 100th Rose Bowl Game, beating No. 2 Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game for the school's eighth Big Ten title, and finishing No. 3 in both national polls, the highest ranking for the Spartans since 1966. Michigan State (13-1) became just the third team in Big Ten history to win 13 games in a season.\n\nDantonio earned 2013 Big Ten Coach of the Year honors from both the media and coaches, as the Spartans finished their conference schedule with a perfect 8-0 record for the first time in school history. Michigan State became the 14th Big Ten team to post an 8-0 mark in league play. The Spartans were the first Big Ten team to win all eight of their conference games by double-digit points since the league went to an eight-game schedule in 1971, and also defeated the Buckeyes by double figures in the championship game. In addition, MSU became the first undefeated Big Ten team to win all of its league games by double-figure points since Michigan in 1943 (6-0 record).\n\nDantonio also was named a finalist for the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year, Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Coach of the Year, Bobby Bowden Coach of the Year and Liberty Mutual Coach of the Year. In addition, he was named one of 16 semifinalists for the Maxwell Football Club Coach of the Year and was tabbed Big Ten Coach of the Year by Sporting News and CollegeFootballNews.com.\n\nDantonio and his staff assembled the No. 1 defense in the Big Ten for the third straight season in 2013. The Spartans led the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision in total defense for 13 straight weeks and finished the season ranked No. 2 in the FBS, allowing just 252.2 yards per game. MSU was the only school to rank in the top three in the four major defensive stat categories: No. 2 in total defense, No. 2 in rushing defense (86.6 ypg.), No. 3 in scoring defense (13.2 ppg.) and No. 3 in pass defense (165.6 ypg.). In addition, the Spartans led the FBS in pass efficiency defense (92.3 rating) and ranked No. 2 in opponent third-down conversions (.279) and No. 5 in first-downs defense (14.3 pg). MSU's defense allowed just 4.04 yards per play, which also ranked No. 1 in the FBS.\n\nThe Spartans also led the Big Ten in nine defensive categories (total defense, scoring defense, rushing defense, pass defense, pass efficiency defense, turnover margin, opponent third-down conversions, opponent fourth-down conversions, first downs defense). MSU became the first team to rank first in total defense and rushing defense three years in a row since the Big Ten awarded conference stat champions in 1985 for overall games.\n\nOffensively, the Spartans evolved into championship form as the season progressed, culminating with strong performances against Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game and Stanford in the Rose Bowl Game. The Spartans produced 438 yards of total offense against the Buckeyes and nearly 400 yards (397) against Stanford, which entered the game No. 14 in the FBS in total defense. Cook, a sophomore, was named the Most Outstanding Player in the Big Ten Championship Game after throwing for 304 yards and three touchdowns, and he topped that performance by racking up 332 passing yards and two touchdowns against the Cardinal while being named the Rose Bowl Game's Offensive MVP.\n\nMSU ranked among the Big Ten leaders in conference games in passing efficiency (third with 139.5 rating), scoring offense (fifth with 29.8 ppg.) and rushing offense (fifth with 185.8 ypg.). The offensive line allowed just 17 sacks - the second fewest in the Big Ten and 15th fewest in the FBS. In addition, Michigan State ranked seventh in the FBS in time of possession (33:19 per game).\n\nAnother key reason for MSU's success was creating turnovers on defense and limiting mistakes on offense, as Michigan State ranked first in the Big Ten and tied for 10th in the FBS in turnover margin (+13, 0.9 per game). The Spartans forced a total of 28 turnovers (11 fumbles, 17 interceptions), including five for touchdowns (three fumble recoveries, two interception returns). MSU forced the most turnovers in the Big Ten (28) and also turned the ball over the least amount of times (15) in the conference. MSU's seven interceptions were also tied for fewest in the Big Ten and tied for 11th fewest in the FBS.\n\nMichigan State was rewarded for winning the Legends Division by three games, as six Spartans were named to the All-Big Ten First Team and a total of 16 players received all-conference recognition. The six first-team selections were the most for Michigan State since 1990, and the 16 honorees overall equaled the second most under Dantonio (19 in 2011, 16 in 2010). Two Spartans took home individual awards, as Dennard was named the Tatum-Woodson Big Ten Defensive Back of the Year, while Calhoun was named the Smith-Brown Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year.\n\nDennard, Calhoun and Bullough were first-team selections by both the coaches and media. Drummond, Sadler and senior safety Isaiah Lewis were named first-team All-Big Ten by the coaches. The five first-team selections on defense tied for the most in school history (1966).\n\nMichigan State defeated five bowl-bound teams in 2013, including victories over Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Minnesota and Ohio State. The Spartans snapped Ohio State's school-record 24-game winning streak in the Big Ten Championship.\n\n2012: 7-6, 3-5 Big Ten (2012 Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl Champions)\n\nMichigan State secured its third straight winning campaign (7-6) in 2012 with a thrilling 13-point second-half comeback victory over TCU in the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl, defeating the Horned Frogs, 17-16.\n\nThe Spartans placed five players on the All-Big Ten First Team in 2012, the most first-team selections for the program since 1999. A total of 11 Spartans received All-Big Ten recognition, including junior running back Le'Veon Bell, who garnered consensus first-team honors after leading the Big Ten and ranking No. 3 in the NCAA FBS in rushing with 137.9 yards per game.\n\nThe Spartan defense ranked among the NCAA FBS Top 10 in eight categories: touchdowns allowed (second with 16), pass efficiency defense (third at 98.8), total defense (fourth at 274.4 ypg.), pass break-ups (tied for eighth at 4.8 pg.), rushing defense (eighth at 98.6 ypg.), third-down defense (eighth at .305), pass defense (ninth at 175.8 ypg.) and scoring defense (ninth at 16.3 ppg.). In addition, MSU also led the Big Ten in six defensive categories (touchdowns allowed, total defense, scoring defense, pass efficiency defense, rushing defense and third-down defense). Seven starters, including first-team choices Johnny Adams (cornerback), Max Bullough (linebacker) and Darqueze Dennard (cornerback), earned All-Big Ten accolades.\n\nMichigan State defeated four bowl-bound teams in 2012, with victories over No. 24 Boise State, Central Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The Spartans snapped Wisconsin's 21-game home winning streak at Camp Randall Stadium on Oct. 27 with a 16-13 overtime victory against the Badgers. Michigan State became bowl eligible for a school-record sixth-straight season while playing the toughest schedule in the Big Ten and the fourth hardest in the FBS, according to NCAA figures, as MSU's opponents compiled a 78-48 (.619) record during the regular season.\n\nThree Spartans were selected in the 2013 National Football League Draft: Bell (Pittsburgh Steelers, second round), Dion Sims (Miami Dolphins, fourth round) and William Gholston (Tampa Bay Buccaneers, fourth round).\n\n2011: 11-3, 7-1 Big Ten (2012 Outback Bowl Champions, Big Ten Legends Division Champions, Final Ranking: No. 11/10)\n\nIn 2011, thanks to its 33-30 triple-overtime victory over Georgia in the 2012 Outback Bowl, Michigan State (11-3) finished No. 10 in the final USA TODAY Coaches Poll and No. 11 in the final Associated Press Poll. It marked MSU's third Top 10 finish in the history of the USA TODAY Coaches Poll and its first since 1999 (No. 7 with a 10-2 record).\n\nMichigan State's 11 wins in 2011 tied a then-school record, as the Spartans became bowl eligible for a school-record fifth consecutive year. MSU won the Big Ten Legends Division title outright with a 7-1 conference record, improving to 14-2 in Big Ten play during the 2010 and 2011 seasons. The Spartans came up just short of their first Rose Bowl appearance since 1988, falling to Wisconsin, 42-39, in the inaugural Big Ten Championship Game.\n\nMichigan State defeated five bowl-bound teams, including a victory over the Badgers earlier in the season on Oct. 22 in Spartan Stadium, 37-31, on a last-second, 44-yard touchdown pass from Kirk Cousins to Keith Nichol. MSU also beat No. 11 Michigan for the fourth straight year on Oct. 15 in Spartan Stadium, 28-14, a first for the program since 1959-62. Other landmark victories included a 10-7 win at Ohio State on Oct. 1, MSU's first win in Ohio Stadium since 1998, and a 37-21 victory at Iowa on Nov. 12, the Spartans' first triumph in Kinnick Stadium since 1989.\n\nThe Spartans claimed the Legends Division outright with a 31-17 victory at Northwestern on Nov. 26 and closed the regular season with a 4-0 record in November.

Cunningham re-wrote the Michigan State record book. Cousins, the second-winningest quarterback in school history with 27 victories as a starter, finished his career as MSU's all-time leader in touchdown passes (66), passing yards (9,131), completions (723), passing efficiency (146.1 rating), 200-yard passing games (26) and total offense (9,004 yards). He also set a single-season MSU record with 25 passing TDs in 2011. Cousins' favorite target was Cunningham, who left East Lansing as Michigan State's career leader in both receptions (218) and receiving yards (3,316). In his senior year, Cunningham tied a then-school record with 79 receptions and posted eight 100-yard receiving games, the most in an MSU single-season.\n\nThe Spartans were rewarded for their excellent season as 19 players received All-Big Ten recognition on the first team, second team or honorable mention, including a school-record 11 on defense. The Spartans had four first-team All-Big Ten selections: Adams (coaches), offensive guard Joel Foreman (coaches and media), safety Trenton Robinson (media) and defensive tackle Jerel Worthy (coaches and media).\n\nWorthy also earned consensus first-team All-America honors, marking the fourth straight year Michigan State had a consensus first-team All-American (Javon Ringer: 2008; Greg Jones: 2009, 2010), establishing school record.\n\nFollowing the successful 2011 campaign, six Spartans were selected in the 2012 National Football League Draft, the most since 2000: Worthy (Green Bay Packers, second round); Cousins (Washington Redskins, fourth round); Keshawn Martin (Houston Texans, fourth round); Robinson (San Francisco 49ers, sixth round); Cunningham (Miami Dolphins, sixth round); and Edwin Baker (San Diego, seventh round).\n\n2010: 11-2, 7-1 Big Ten (Big Ten Champions, Capital One Bowl, Final Ranking: No. 14/14)\n\nDantonio, who led Michigan State to a then-school record 11 wins in 2010 and a share of its first Big Ten Championship since 1990, was named the Dave McClain Big Ten Coach of the Year, as selected by the conference's media panel. A finalist for the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, Eddie Robinson and Liberty Mutual National Coach of the Year Awards, Dantonio helped manage the third-biggest turnaround among NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision teams during the regular season, as the Spartans improved from 6-7 in 2009 to 11-1 in 2010. He was also named the AFCA (American Football Coaches Association) Region 3 Coach of the Year, and earned National Coach of the Year honors from CBSSports.com, Scout.com and Rivals.com.\n\nThanks to its 28-22 victory at Penn State in the regular-season finale, Michigan State recorded its first win in State College since 1965 and finished in a tie with Wisconsin for the 2010 Big Ten Championship.

The Spartans finished the season ranked No. 14 in both The Associated Press and USA TODAY/ Coaches' Polls.\n\nA total of 16 Spartans received All-Big Ten recognition on the first team, second team or honorable mention, including senior linebacker Greg Jones, senior punter Aaron Bates, sophomore running back Edwin Baker and sophomore placekicker Dan Conroy, who each earned All-Big Ten first-team honors from the media. One of the top linebackers in school history, Jones was named a first-team consensus All-American for the second straight season, becoming only the third Spartan to accomplish the feat. He also became just the seventh player in program history to receive first-team All-Big Ten honors three times. Jones (New York Giants) and cornerback Chris L. Rucker (Indianapolis Colts) were selected in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL Draft.\n\n2009: 6-7, 4-4 Big Ten (Alamo Bowl)\n\nLed by Jones and one of the most explosive offenses in the Big Ten, the Spartans earned their third consecutive bowl bid in 2009.\n\nA consensus first-team All-American, Jones became the first Spartan to win Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year accolades after recording 154 tackles, finishing first in the conference and third nationally in 2009. He also led the team and ranked among the national leaders in tackles for loss (14 for 69 yards) and sacks (9 for 53 yards). Jones was rated the No. 1 linebacker in the nation by CollegeFootballNews.com and earned the Linebacker Trophy (Linebacker of the Year) by the College Football Performance Awards.\n\nIn addition, Worthy was named a Freshman All-American, marking the third straight year a Spartan landed on a Freshman All-America Team, and cornerback Jeremy Ware was chosen by the Oakland Raiders in the seventh round of the 2010 NFL Draft.\n\nOffensively, Michigan State featured the No. 2 passing attack in the Big Ten, averaging nearly 270 yards per game.

Dantonio became just the third first-year coach in Michigan State history to earn a postseason bowl bid, joining Saban (1995 Independence Bowl vs. LSU) and John L. Smith (2003 Alamo Bowl vs. Nebraska).\n\nMichigan State (7-6 overall) produced seven victories despite playing one of the nation's most demanding schedules, as the Spartans' 2007 opponents had a combined record of 75-57 (.568) during the regular season.

He previously spent six years as an assistant coach at Michigan State from 1995-2000.\n\nCincinnati (2004-06)\n\nDantonio established himself as one of the nation's up-and-coming coaches during his three-year tenure at Cincinnati, where he compiled an 18-17 overall record and led the program in its transition from Conference USA to the BIG EAST Conference.\n\nIn 2006, Dantonio led the Bearcats to a 7-5 overall record and a 4-3 BIG EAST mark, making Cincinnati bowl eligible for the second time in three years. Dantonio accomplished the feat against the second-toughest schedule in the country, as UC's opponents compiled a 69-42 record. His Bearcats upset then-No. 7 Rutgers, 30-11, on Nov. 18, handing the Scarlet Knights their first loss of the season and marking the highest-ranked opponent ever defeated by UC.\n\nHighly respected as one of the top defensive coaches in the country, Dantonio's Bearcats finished the 2006 regular season ranked among the NCAA leaders in six statistical categories: No. 21 in tackles for loss (6.8 per game), No. 23 in pass efficiency defense (109.3 rating), No. 27 in rushing defense (107.5 ypg.), No. 31 in total defense (304.3 ypg.), No. 34 in scoring defense (19.3 ppg.) and No. 34 in sacks (2.4 per game).

Three UC players received second-team all-conference honors, including offensive guard Trevor Canfield, tight end Brent Celek and cornerback Mike Mickens. Celek, who set UC career records for receptions, receiving yards and TDs by a tight end, was taken by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL Draft.\n\nIn 2005, Dantonio brought together one of the nation's youngest teams, with the Bearcats starting as many as five first-year freshmen on defense and posted a competitive 4-7 record in the program's first season in the BIG EAST.\n\nIn 2004, he became the first head coach in 23 years to direct a team to a winning season in his first year at UC. Dantonio also became only the second head coach in Cincinnati history (along with Sid Gillman) to take the Bearcats to a bowl game in his first season. The Bearcats' went 7-5 in 2004, including a 5-3 mark in Conference USA to finish second in the league standings, and defeated Marshall (32-14) in the Fort Worth Bowl.\n\nCincinnati led C-USA and ranked No. 26 in the NCAA in pass defense, allowing 194.2 yards per game.

In back-to-back years (2006-07), Cincinnati's program was presented the American Football Coaches Association Academic Achievement Award for attaining a graduation rate of at least 70 percent for its student-athletes.\n\nAssistant Coaching Positions\n\nPrior to his appointment at Cincinnati, Dantonio served as the defensive coordinator at Ohio State for three seasons, where his defensive unit helped the Buckeyes to a combined record of 32-6.\n\nIn 2003, Ohio State's defense was the second toughest against the run, allowing 62.3 yards per game, and was ranked No. 10 in total defense (296.9 ypg.) and No. 16 in scoring defense (17.6 ppg.). Those efforts helped the Buckeyes post an 11-2 record and finish No. 4 in the final polls.\n\nDantonio assembled the defense which led Ohio State to the 2002 National Championship, as the Buckeyes ranked second in the NCAA in scoring defense (13.1 ppg) and third in rushing defense (77.7 ypg.). Six Buckeye defenders were named first-team All-Big Ten during his tenure and 13 were drafted by the pros, including a pair of first-round selections in 2004 (defensive end Will Smith and cornerback Chris Gamble).\n\nDantonio spent six years (1995-2000) as Michigan State's secondary coach, including five seasons under Saban and one under Bobby Williams. He was promoted to associate head coach in 2000. During his six-year tenure as an assistant, the Spartans compiled a 39-30-1 record.\n\nUnder his supervision, the Spartan secondary ranked among the NCAA leaders in pass efficiency defense three of his last four years, finishing No. 10 (101.6) in 1998, No. 16 (103.9) in 1997 and No. 22 (104.5) in 2000. In his last season as secondary coach, the Spartans only allowed 164.1 yards a game through the air, ranking seventh in the country in 2000.\n\nDantonio contributed to Michigan State's successful 1999 season, during which the Spartans went 10-2, won the Florida Citrus Bowl, led the Big Ten in total defense and ranked No. 7 in the final polls. He tutored cornerback Amp Campbell, who earned third-team All-America honors from the Associated Press.\n\nDantonio came to Michigan State following four seasons under Glen Mason at Kansas (1991-94) where he coached the defensive secondary. In 1992, the Jayhawks produced an 8-4 record and defeated BYU, 23-20, in the Aloha Bowl.\n\nDantonio previously spent five years at Youngstown State under Tressel, helping the Penguins to three trips to the NCAA I-AA playoffs. While serving as defensive coordinator in 1990, Youngstown State posted a perfect 11-0 regular-season record and ranked second nationally.\n\nHis coaching credits also including stops at Akron (defensive secondary, 1985), Ohio State (graduate assistant, 1983-84), Butler (Kan.) Junior College (defensive coordinator, 1982), Purdue (graduate assistant, 1981) and Ohio University (graduate assistant, 1980).\n\nCollege/High School\n\nDantonio earned three letters as a defensive back for Coach Jim Carlen at South Carolina (1976-78). He earned a bachelor's degree in education from South Carolina in 1979. Dantonio later earned a master's degree in education from Ohio U. in 1980.\n\nHe picked up all-state and all-league honors as a prep football player at Zanesville (Ohio) High School and was selected to play in the Ohio North-South All-Star Game.\n\nTHE DANTONIO FILE\n\nPERSONAL DATA:\n\nBorn Mark Dantonio in El Paso, Texas, on March 9, 1956.\n\nCOACHING EXPERIENCE: College - Graduate assistant at Ohio U.
