        "text": "I am Coach Tremaine Edwards, originally from Montgomery, Alabama and have been in the Huntsville area since college in 2001 while attending Alabama A&M University. I am an accomplished middle school football and basketball coach with over 15 years of experience. Prior to Liberty, I held the various positions of Head Coach, Assistant Coach, and Offensive Coordinator at Chapman Middle School with a record of 23-2 with 1 City Championship. I held the Defensive Line Coaching position the last two years at Liberty Middle School. I have been married for 14 years to my wife, Shaundrika Edwards, and we have two daughters, Makenzie (11), and Laiyah (7).\n\nThis will be my fifth season coaching the offensive line at Liberty Middle School. I gained experience of being a lineman in high school, playing offensive line at Carver High School (Montgomery, AL). After high school, I played defensive line at Alabama A&M University. I've had the pleasure of playing alongside some great teammates and excellent coaches, which resulted in me increasing my knowledge of the game of football. I have over fifteen years of experience coaching youth sports in Madison County. I'm honored for the opportunity to be a part of the Lions Football Program.\n\nThis will be my sixth year at Liberty Middle School. I have 11 years of coaching experience, previously at Discovery Middle School and Williams Middle School before coming to LMS. I look forward to fostering a relationship beyond the football field with all the players and working closely with the linebackers this season.\n\nThis will be my third year working with the LMS Football Team. I graduated from Auburn University with a Kinesiology Degree in 2021. Looking forward to working with the Defensive Backs this year at Liberty."
