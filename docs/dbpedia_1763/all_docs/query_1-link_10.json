Livingston\n\nHarvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard University\n\nAbstract: This paper explores the significance of metaphor usage in executive coaching conversations. Although metaphor has been cited as a coaching skill, little has been written about how coaches systematically attend to and work with metaphor in client language. The paper asserts that metaphor is an important and powerful language act that represents a client’s way(s) of making meaning and is therefore a component of coaching conversations that merits intentional focus. Drawing from literature in cognitive linguistics, constructivist psychology, psychotherapy, neurobiology, cultural anthropology and executive coaching, this paper looks at the role metaphor plays in a client’s narrative and how coaches can identify and effectively explore metaphorical language to deepen client understanding. The paper also explores the trade-offs of coaches introducing their own metaphors into the dialogue and self-management factors to consider when doing so. Finally, the paper proposes that coaches reflect on their own thinking style and the implications it has for their practice when working with clients who use metaphor to varying degrees.\n\nKeywords: Metaphor, Executive coaching, Meaning making, Constructivism\n\nScience of Positive Psychology in Leadership and Executive Coaching\n\nLeland W.

The output of this project would be recommended curricula and/or tools deepen the development of coaches relative to their inner work. In its current stage of maturation, the Executive Coaching profession requires its practitioners to grow beyond techniques and embrace internal work.

This paper and research began as an exploration of cross-cultural coaching through a global lens. As I dug deeper into the literature and began a self exploration of my own level of cultural intelligence, the research and subsequent paper took a turn. With Hofstede’s work on culture as the foundation, I began to explore how developing cultural intelligence and expanding the knowledge of a client’s cultural worldview would impact the coaching relationship and process. I then began to explore how a greater use of the Developmental Frames component in Phase 1 of the CCCP Coaching Process supports the coaching relationship and process by building the coach’s cultural intelligence. The paper concludes with an answer and recap of personal experience with my opening question.\n\nKeywords: Culture, Cross-cultural coaching, Cultural Intelligence, Cultural Orientation\n\nThe Art and Science of Goal-Setting: Helping Clients Go Beyond SMART\n\nJoseph E.

Yet law firms have not adopted coaching as part of their professional development culture in the same way as many more traditional corporations and professional firms. In fact, professional development in law firms often focuses exclusively on content knowledge, rather than managerial and emotional competency skills. We set out to understand what makes coaching lawyers different from coaching in a corporate context, and how those differences can help us design a tailored coaching program that can succeed in bringing coaching to law firms. Our focus is on the five elements that make coaching lawyers different from coaching executives.\n\nKey Words: Personality types of lawyers, Legal education, Law firm organization structure, Law firm compensation structure, Culture and values.\n\nA Coaching Assignment in the Corporate World: Getting Off to a Good Start\n\nKaren L.

How can the coach help the client(s) both the organization and the person to be coached to discover what role, responsibilities and realistic outcomes they can expect as a partner in this relationship? What preliminary questions do the client(s) and the coach need to answer before they begin?\n\nKeywords: Entry and Contracting, Action Learning, Ethics, Contributing\n\nThe Consultant-Coach: Implications of Playing the Role of Both Consultant and Coach for the Same Client\n\nRobert L.
