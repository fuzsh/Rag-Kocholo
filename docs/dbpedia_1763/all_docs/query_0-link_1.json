Our standard (and possibly consensus?) is to list it as Michigan–Michigan State as it also matches the other UofM articles. I'm requesting help to tackle this issue with the user (IP and user are the same person). Thanks, Corky\n\nAs it is not a UM article, but an MSU and UM article, wouldn’t the order UM articles exclusively use not matter? It was originally called the Paul Bunyan trophy, a more neutral name. Is the order really that important? Shouldn’t users just be able to add content or create edits in whichever order they see fit? There is no team that inherently requires being said first, and with only two, it is not confusing in any order. It seems overkill/petty to insist one school is always first, or always second. Users should edit freely and unambiguously in any order.\n\n-Friendly Accountless User — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2600:1007:B111:8327:FC3E:8804:6870:6DB4 (talk)\n\nEvery single football rivalry article on Wikipedia without a common name (e. g. Red River Rivalry) orders the teams on alphabetical order. See List of NCAA college football rivalry games. It's just easier to find the articles when they follow this predictable pattern. And the article is cleaner when all the references are in the same order. Ostealthy (talk)\n\nThat makes sense. It just seems of minor importance/more effort than it’s worth to police. It is not a hill I would want to die on. People will still find the article easily regardless of order. The order isn’t that big of a deal one way or the other. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 68.188.143.151 (talk)\n\nRight, so why are you hell bent on changing it? Ostealthy (talk)\n\nNow we’ve got sock puppetry going from the IP/user. They’ll be reported soon. Thanks for your help, I appreciate it! Corky\n\nJust saw. Already reverted and have requested PP. UW Dawgs (talk)\n\nI've recently become aware that USAToday's website is no longer a reliable source for Coaches Poll results from 2008 to 2013. For each week's results in that period, there are several ballots missing from the results, resulting in teams that are out of order from their original position. For example, for 2013 Week 9 the USA Today website implies (from FPV totals) that there are 54 ballots in the count, while an archive of the page from 2014 lists the full results from 62 voters. This results in discrepancies like Missouri and Miami being flipped. Every single week from 2008 to 2013 is like this, and the further you go back the fewer ballots are counted. So just keep this in mind if you see anyone changing ranking information based on these incomplete results, as I've seen at least one person doing. I've contacted USAToday and they seem completely uninterested in fixing their records, so please consult archived versions from now on, or default to ESPN, who have the correct results. Ostealthy (talk)\n\nThis issue appears to have been fixed on USAToday's website. The site now features accurate results going back to 1992. Ostealthy (talk)\n\nI'm under the impression that the sports' WikiProjects have all drawn a hard line in the sand regarding over-categorization for high school sports, such as Category:Hillsborough High Terriers football coaches and Category:Montgomery Bell Academy Big Red football coaches. Or am I mistaken? SportsGuy789 (talk)\n\nYeah, these should probably be up-merged to Category:High school football coaches in the United States. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nAll – I've nominated these two for upmerging (CfM discussion here). Pinging @MisterCake:, the creator of these subcats, so he is aware. SportsGuy789 (talk)\n\nPlease see Template talk:Infobox NCAA team season#Cleaning up field names for discussion. Thanks, Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nHey, guys, this is kind of off topic, but I didn't know exactly where else to bring it up. So, there's this AfD. Some background info here: it's an ice hockey AfD. The subject involved was national player of the year in Canadian college ice hockey (CIS), which doesn't meet any of the points of WP:NHOCKEY, but people are now bringing up WP:NCOLLATH. The broader question I see here is whether or not WP:NCOLLATH ought to be applied to CIS athletes as well, or whether it's for NCAA athletes only. Thanks!! Ejgreen77 (talk)\n\nHey y'all. There is a discussion at Talk:Red River Showdown#Remove Championship Game result from Red River Rivalry that some editors may be interested in contributing.-UCO2009bluejay (talk)\n\nJust FYI it's still going on.-UCO2009bluejay (talk)\n\nProposal to delete all portals\n\nThe discussion is at Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)#Proposal to delete Portal space. Voceditenore (talk)\n\nYou are invited to join the discussion at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject American football#Meaning of \"field goal attempt\". -- Marchjuly (talk)\n\nJust want to update that the above-mentioned discussion is closed and the issue appears to have been resolved (at least for the moment). -- Marchjuly (talk)\n\nJust an FYI to this project that this inexperienced user is creating college football list articles of questionable quality, and could probably use a patient mentor to help him improve. At the very minimum I wanted to bring these new articles to your attention. SportsGuy789 (talk)\n\nThe articles at issue are lists of football seasons, including Richmond Spiders, Villanova Wildcats, Rhode Island Rams, Northeastern Huskies], UMass Minutemen, and Hofstra Pride, Maine Black Bears (draft), New Hampshire Wildcats (draft), Elon Phoenix (draft), Presbyterian Blue Hose (draft), Stony Brook Seawolves (draft), Portland State Vikings (draft), Sacramento State Hornets (draft), and others. Can someone familiar with our best practices for such lists take a look and offer any needed input and encouragement to User:Dragonash1974? Cbl62 (talk)\n\nThese lists display yet another \"style fork\", if you will. See List of Michigan Wolverines football seasons vs. List of Alabama Crimson Tide football seasons. There's been discussion in the past about applying a uniform format for these lists, but the issue has never been resolved. @Dragonash1974:, welcome. Perhaps you'd like to take that on that project? Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nI would be open to trying to apply a uniform format for these lists. If anyone would want to share some opinions on which format seems best. One that I like is List of William & Mary Tribe football seasons. Dragonash1974 (talk)\n\nI know a few of us are standardization wonks, and as such I've found two glaring discrepancies between styles on season article pages.\n\nThe first of which is rosters one example the 2013 Oklahoma Sooners football team page uses Template:American football roster, while 2018 Alabama Crimson Tide football team uses some sort of wikitable and has it broke down by position.\n\nThe second is how we record game summaries within season articles. This is even just for 2019 like this for Oklahoma, compared to this for Kansas State. Of course, this doesn't even begin to describe all of the historical articles.\n\nI honestly don't care which way we go on the roster as far as we're consistent. I do care more about the game summaries (I prefer the first example, but it's about consensus not what I like). IMO this is the most obvious overlooked thing on the project, (especially considering all of the work over two seemingly similar schedule tables styles).-UCO2009bluejay (talk)\n\nUCO2009bluejay, thanks for bringing this up. I've noticed these style discrepancies as well. For the rosters, a template-based solution seems preferable. The 2018 Alabama table include heights and weights for each player. Do we need to include that? Note that articles such as 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team have roster tables that include, heights, weights, hometowns, high schools, and previous colleges. As for the game summary sections, there's also a third scheme, exemplified by 2017 Michigan Wolverines football team, which employs Template:AFB game box start, Template:AFB Game Box Scoring Entry, and Template:AFB game box end. I think that's the best version of the three, as it's more comprehensive than the 2019 Kansas State scheme (using Template:Linescore Amfootball) and much cleaner and less obtrusive than the 2019 Oklahoma scheme (using Template:Americanfootballbox). And what about those tables that show \"Overall record\", \"Last meeting\", \"Result\"? Do we need those? Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nIn regards to last point it sounds like WP:Fancruft or stuff that typically gets mentioned in run of the mill coverage.-UCO2009bluejay (talk)\n\nAgree on the \"Overall record/Last meeting/Result\" tables. Seems like trivial clutter that doesn't have lasting value. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nI do not believe we should be slaves to consistency where such practice would result in deletion of useful information. In particular, where editors have gone to the trouble to develop rosters with player height, weight, and hometown, as found at 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team#Full roster (a Good Article), we should not eliminate that useful information for the sake of \"consistency\". We should not all be bound to the lowest common denominator. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nCbl, any information that is deemed useful and non-trivial should be supported by the preferred format/templates. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nFWIW, I also think the format used at 2018 Alabama Crimson Tide football team#Roster is terrific in that it allows for inclusion of player height and weight. These fields are far from trivial. Could the template be modified to include these fields (also hometown) as options? Cbl62 (talk)\n\nYes, the template could be modified to include these fields. That's going to require some considerations about layout. As for the the 2018 Alabama Crimson Tide football team roster, its got some basic formatting problems in that it misuses capitalization, italics, and hyphens. It's probably makes the most sense to start with Template:American football roster, already in use on over 2,000, articles, and play with a sandbox version of it to cover the additional fields. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nThanks. I suggest that the height, weight, and hometown fields be created only as optional fields. We can then see how it looks. Cbl62 (talk)\n\n@Mack2700:\n\nMany team articles have a \"Current coaching Staff\" section (Ex USC Trojans football#Current coaching staff). Current NCAA rules limit the assistant coaching staff to 10 individuals (or such) with that same article noting the Alabama media guide lists \"41 photos of people with a numbing array of titles.\" and similar examples of non-coaching staff largess.\n\nSo I recently updated 15 team articles to remove non-coaches from the \"Current coaching staff\" section as these longtail non-coach, staff members are a better fit for the YYYY/2019 team season articles (Ex 2019 USC Trojans football team). The general result was a limited display of 10~11 actual coaches on these articles and no reverts until today.\n\nToday, Mack270 reverted on Army Black Knights football#Current coaching staff which restored 15 non-coaching staff members (who are already included on 2019 Army Black Knights football team#Coaching staff). The Army article is scoped to 130 years of Army football, but now also conveys 15 additional staff such as \"Michael Zeol, Assistant Director of Video Operations, 2017, 2017, William Paterson\" which seems dramatically misaligned from the article topic. The content doesn't even seem to rise to WP:FANCRUFT. So am looking for some general consensus that the team articles should directionally attempt to restrict the \"Current coaching staff\" section to only actual coaches. UW Dawgs (talk)\n\nI think we ought to remove current coaching staff sections from main team articles. That's detail that belongs on the relevant team season page. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nI agree in full with Jweiss11. That stuff belongs on the season page. PCN02WPS (talk | contribs)\n\nI think it's fine to include current coaching staffs on the main team articles. It's information relevant to the current state of the program, after all. But I think non-coaching staff should be removed, on both main team articles and season articles. The director of video production, etc. is pure fancruft. Ostealthy (talk)\n\nHello football enthusiasts. There is a draft waiting for review at WP:AFC about a coach with an award named after him.

Walkerma (talk)\n\nA current AfD at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2018 Saint John's Johnnies football team raises interesting questions about where we should draw the line on season articles. Saint John's (MN) is a small-college program that won a local conference championship in Minnesota and lost in the quarterfinals of the Division III playoffs. I am a supporter of season articles for Division I (FBS and FCS) programs, but I have serious reservations about proliferation of articles about Division III programs. The current AfD presents an opportunity to explore the question. Feel free to offer your views one way or the other. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nSee also Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2018 Olivet Comets football team and Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2016 Chicago Maroons football team further dealing with the notability of non-championship Division III seasons. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nPer the above discussion (in #\"Current coaching staff\" section on team articles), the success of the Season articles campaign in creating YYYY/2019 season articles, and many team articles already exceeding wiki's 100 kB size guidelines (WP:TOOBIG, Articles to be split), lets revisit the purpose of including \"Current coaching staff\" sections (Ex USC Trojans football#Current coaching staff) as seen in some but not all FBS team articles.\n\nThe assistant coaching staff content already has a natural home in each YYYY (2019 USC Trojans football) season article, but does it deserve its own section in the full team article (Ex USC Trojans football team) which are covering 100+ years of team history?\n\nQ1. Should we remove \"Current coaching staff\" sections from all FBS team articles.\n\nRelated, WP:INFOBOXPURPOSE says When considering any aspect of infobox design, keep in mind the purpose of an infobox: to summarize (and not supplant) key facts that appear in the article. ... The less information it contains, the more effectively it serves that purpose, allowing readers to identify key facts at a glance. The team article infoboxes also render various non-head coach staff (OC, DC, ST, AHC/TEs, etc), such as Nevada Wolf Pack football:\n\nAngus McClure (AHC/OL)\n\nMatt Mumme (OC/QB)\n\nJeff Casteel (DC/LB)\n\nJackie Shipp (DL)\n\nQ2. If removal of the \"Current coaching staff\" section removes the names of all ~10 assistant coaches from the team articles, should the \"OtherStaff\" (assistant coaches) parameter of Template:Infobox NCAA football school be deprecated per INFOBOXPURPOSE? UW Dawgs (talk)\n\nYes 1 and 2. UW Dawgs (talk)\n\nSupport removal of both \"Current coaching staff\" sections from main program articles and \"OtherStaff\" parameter from Template:Infobox NCAA football school. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nUW Dawgs, that was a quick consensus. Anyway, I'm all for it, and I'm all for pruning more. You just tackled Tennessee_Volunteers_football--\"Past and present NFL players\" can be handled by a link to a category, an all-time list of all-time history against all opponents is...well, a bit over the top, and that list of captains should be cut as well. How about it? ;) Drmies (talk)\n\nThere is a discussion in which you might be interested at Talk:Florida Gators football#rearranging sections about an editor's aesthetic preference[1] to elevate the \"Uniforms\" and \"Current coaching staff\" sections above more traditional content. UW Dawgs (talk)\n\nUm, that's not at all what I proposed to do. I suggested moving sections with lots of text to the top half of the article and moving long lists to the bottom, basically arranging it into a text/appendix format for easier readability. I'd actually forgotten about it, and though I still think it'd be a much better arrangement, it's probably an idea best revisited after the season. Zeng8r (talk)\n\nThree FBS articles display the all-time records for \"every\" (100+) opponent series.\n\nNebraska Cornhuskers football#Series records\n\nIowa Hawkeyes football#Division I opponents\n\nTennessee Volunteers football#History against all opponents\n\nAll three team articles currently fail WP:TOOBIG. These serires sections are 5-15kB, where TOOBIG begins to flag at >50kB. So the sections are inherently problematic.\n\nDo we have consensus around either 1) outright removal, or 2) merging to a new \"List of Team Nickname all-time series records\" type article convention to support this content? Observationally, this content is not consistently maintained and diverges from sourcing. My view is remove, but a new stand-alone article type is also reasonable. UW Dawgs (talk)\n\nThe concept of separate, stand-alone series record articles was soundly rejected by the community in this AfD (and others) back in 2016. Dumping the same data into the main program article looks like an attempt to end-run around that process. FWIW, I have no objection to all time record table in program articles on a limited basis where it makes sense (such as conference or in-state opponents). But, listing every single team they've ever played a single game against seems like overkill to me. Ejgreen77 (talk)\n\nRemoved x3 per prior consensus (on stand alone article format). UW Dawgs (talk)\n\nI removed again from Nebraska after they were re-added.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nI would like to see the series records remain on Nebraska Cornhuskers football. I maintain the records and keep them current after every weekend. Wscsuperfan (talk)\n\nFound a neat article that can be used as a source for historical games ESPN: The 150 greatest games in college football's 150-year history.--Paul McDonald (talk)\n\nPaul, saw this article earlier today. Seven Michigan games from my tenure as a fan made it—all tragic losses! :( Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nThere has been good discussion in recent days about when, if ever, we should have season articles about college football teams that play at levels below Division I. See these AfDs: 1973 San Diego, 2016 Saint John's, and 2018 Olivet. As of now, we have not adopted any formal guidance, leaving the matter to be debated endlessly under WP:GNG. With 450 D3 schools, 251 NAIA schools, and 314 D2 schools, opening the door to articles on all such seasons means we could eventually face 50,000 stubs (1,015 lower level schools x 48 seasons since the multi-division system was adopted in 1973). To me, and particularly when we have not even come close to building quality season articles on all D1 programs, this would be a misdirection of limited resources and an ongoing maintenance problem. I'm not sure where consensus is on this, but I think it would be reasonable for us as a project to formulate guidance. I initially thought that we might limit such season articles to lower level teams that have won their divisional national championship. Consensus did not seem to support that. In an attempt to establish some consensus, I'm offering a few alternatives below. Please offer your view. @Jweiss11: @Bagumba: @SportingFlyer: @Paulmcdonald: @Ejgreen77: @Eagles247: @Lizard the Wizard: @Smartyllama: @Ocfootballknut: @Strikehold: @MisterCake: @Patriarca12: @PCN02WPS: @UCO2009bluejay: @Corkythehornetfan: @UW Dawgs: @Ostealthy: @SportsGuy789: @GPL93: @Pvmoutside: @Zeng8r: @JohnInDC: @Bsuorangecrush: @Rikster2: @Hoof Hearted: @TonyTheTiger: @Clarityfiend: @Dirtlawyer1: @BD2412: @Edge3: @Metropolitan90: Cbl62 (talk)\n\nScope note: This vote is not intended to apply to articles from the era before the multi-division system was created. Teams in the older era often shifted between periods of greater or lesser significance, and I believe that these seasons should remain governed by WP:GNG. But the development of the divisions in 1973 provides a clear framework for assessing notability from that point forward, and we should make use of that framework. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nOption 1: Leave everything as is, governed by GNG\n\nSupport I gotta say--every time I try to come up with some kind of rule or guideline that's better than GNG I fail. I'm not saying that GNG is perfect by any stretch, but it's already in place and it seems to work well. When things \"don't\" work well is when an individual or group of editors argue against the well-established General Notability Guideline. \"Look at season article for XXXX team in the year 19XX -- it's just a small team/school/Div III/NAIA/whatever, they don't deserve an article\": Well, what does the coverage about that topic say? If there is enough coverage to surpass GNG, then any argument against it based on size or whatever is really just WP:IDONTLIKEIT. If the article doesn't have the coverage to pass GNG, then no amount of arguing if favor of keeping the article can overcome that. GNG works.--Paul McDonald (talk)\n\nSupport If it passes GNG, it should have an article, whether it's DI, DII, DIII, NAIA, middle school, or a team of goats. Some of those are more likely to pass GNG than others, but that should be the standard. Smartyllama (talk)\n\nSupport after some thought and after reading User:Paulmcdonald's argument. If the season passes GNG then it should be kept. Best, GPL93 (talk)\n\nSupport at least for now. I'm open to the possibility of a categorical restriction here, but I don't see a satisfactory one among the other options, as yet proposed. Specifically, none of the options proposed address the the run of historical seasons as we cross the introduction of tiers by the NCAA in 1956 and 1973. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nSupport There doesn't seem to be any rush to create all these small college season articles, so I really don't see the need to devise any special notability rules. The main difficulty in writing them is that there's often little documentation, and since a lack of coverage would fail GNG, the potential problem takes care of itself. Zeng8r (talk)\n\nSupport – though it may seem disorganized now, I think it's definitely better than the two extremes (create and maintain all the stubs, which would be a pain and indeed a mismanagement of resources, or ban them completely, not leaving room for any exceptions) and I think we can leave it to the community and our editors to determine whether the lower-level articles pass GNG and any other notability guidelines. PCN02WPS (talk | contribs)\n\nSupport Honestly, I think this is the only way. I don’t think it is appropriate to presume notability below D1. But there are some power programs at D2, NAIA and even D3 that get covered at the level of D1 programs so there needs to be some leeway here. It’s not always just the team that wins a title or goes to the final four - other factors exist. GNG is the only way to determine these in my opinion. Rikster2 (talk)\n\nSupport GNG is the best way to handle a case-by-case basis and I support case-by-case basis for this issue.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nSupport GNG is probably the best way. I've done a few lower level articles, but only when they make sense in terms of a larger project (for example, to have a record of all intercollegiate football played by all campuses of the University of California). Ocfootballknut (talk)\n\nComment I think this is the obvious answer, but it doesn't solve the problem - what sort of coverage qualifies a season for WP:GNG? As I've noted in a couple recent AfDs, my local amateur team receives press coverage - we have a bunch of clippings hanging all over the clubhouse - but in no way would we consider this notable. Furthermore, many teams, especially at the lower levels of football, receive a similar and sometimes often lesser amount of press coverage than high school football, which is clearly non-notable. I don't think the issue here is WP:GNG as such but rather being able to distinguish which types of articles demonstrate notability for the season - for instance in the San Diego Toreros article, consensus is GNG is met even though there's only two feature articles on the team, both from local newspapers, and most game coverages are either box scores or brief two-to-five sentence recaps. I would exclude this type of coverage myself. SportingFlyer T·C\n\nThere's a difference between rootine game coverage for a bio vs for a team. For a bio, it's often just passing mentions. The same coverage is routine if trying to establish notability for an article on a single game. But consistent routine coverge for many games of a season for a single team may be sufficient for an article on that entire season. Think of WP:WHYN: We require \"significant coverage\" in reliable sources so that we can actually write a whole article, rather than half a paragraph or a definition of that topic. If only a few sentences could be written and supported by sources about the subject, that subject does not qualify for a separate page, but should instead be merged into an article about a larger topic or relevant list. If the only sources we have are stat lines, there's really not much interesting to write about.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nAlso, generally speaking two such feature articles are often considered enough for an article on any topic--not just college football.--Paul McDonald (talk)\n\nOption 2: Ban lower level season articles completely\n\nOppose A complete unconditional ban like this doesn't make sense. Some programs in the \"lower-levels\" actually have (or at least could have) notable seasons and even games. Such a hard line like this does not need to be drawn.--Paul McDonald (talk)\n\nOppose. Doing so would conflict with Wikipedia-wide GNG criteria, if specific lower level seasons happen to be notable for any number of reasons. SportsGuy789 (talk)\n\nOppose per the two above. PCN02WPS (talk | contribs)\n\nOption 3: Limit lower level season articles to national championship seasons\n\nSupport I think we can presume notability for D2, D3, and NAIA national championship seasons, but anything less than that should rely on GNG. Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nOppose A blanket ban is inappropriate - if they pass GNG, they should have an article. Smartyllama (talk)\n\nOption 4: Limit lower level seasons to final four in each division\n\nSupport. This seems like a reasonable compromise and provides some bright-line guidance to deter proliferation of masses of stub articles. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nOption 5: Limit to playoff teams\n\nLeaning Support and extended to any conference championships for teams that win a conference but who's leagues bar postseason play. Best, GPL93 (talk)\n\nOppose sometimes teams and organizations can gain notability through the news not because they are great but because they are so bad at what they do they generate press. Ours is not to judge the press, ours is to build an encyclopedia from the results of that press.--Paul McDonald (talk)\n\nOption 6: Limit to conference championships\n\nOption 7: Require regional or national coverage for lower level teams\n\nSupport per WP:GNG. Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nOppose 1: what's a \"lower-level\" team? That's determined by opinion. What's a regional or national coverage? That's also determined by opinion. It leaves too much open to strength of argumentation.--Paul McDonald (talk)\n\nComment I think the presumed definition of \"lower-level\" here is any Division II team or lower, based on the opening paragraph in this consensus-building discussion; I disagree that it's subjective. I do agree that regional coverage is subjective and should be avoided as a criterion, but on the other side I don't think national coverage is a debatable topic (for instance, if USA Today wrote an article on the 1972 Millsaps College squad, are you going to argue that's not considered national coverage?). SportsGuy789 (talk)\n\nWhat I was going for there (and now I see that isn't clear) is that the definition of \"lower-level\" can change over time.--Paul McDonald (talk)\n\nOption 8: Omit D2 from the guidance as it represents a higher level of play\n\nOppose Division II season articles should not be presumed notable, GNG should be required for inclusion of these articles. Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nOppose per Eagles247. Each DII article should be judged on a case by case basis. SportsGuy789 (talk)\n\nOption 9: Limits are fine for D2 and D3, but ban NAIA season articles altogether\n\nOppose the NAIA was the first college level play to have a national championship and the organization was once much bigger than it is now. Many current Division II schools were once NAIA schools. Drawing a hard-limiting line like this creates trouble down the road.--Paul McDonald (talk)\n\nOppose per largely what PaulMcDonald states, but to add: there are a number of present-day FCS and FBS teams that began as NAIA programs. To be pedantic about banning NAIA seasons would be in direct conflict with the established guideline that FCS and FBS programs' articles are deemed notable. SportsGuy789 (talk)\n\nI'm not sure why \"Option 7: Require regional or national coverage for lower level teams\" needs to be discussed. A WikiProject would not be able to override a website-wide guideline (WP:GNG). Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nCouple general comments. First, for the sake of simplicity, I think we can treat NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, and NAIA identically as one bucket named \"lower division\" or \"sub Division I\". There's no need to stratify our treatment among these. Second, if there's going to be a policy other than Option 1 above, it needs to deal with the introduction of tiers in college sports, first in 1956 with the NCAA's creation of University of College Division, and then in 1973 with the introduction of Division I, II, and III. It's unclear to me when exactly teams became \"NAIA\". Take DePauw Tigers football, now an NCAA Division III, for example. Would some limitation on \"lower division\" seasons articles only apply to DePauw starting in 1956 or 1973? Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nI'm not sure what you would propose. Many teams that are now Division III were formerly major or at least mid-level programs. Chicago, Sewanee, Saint Mary's, Oberlin, Case Western come to mind. Prior to the divisional separation, there was much more cross-over and less stratification. So it would IMO be fatally flawed to say that because a team is Division III in 1973, all of its historical seasons before 1973 should be treated as though they were playing at a Division III level. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nSewanee, Chicago, Saint Mary's, and many others were clearly major programs at one time or another, so I'm certainly not proposing that all historical seasons be treated by the current status of the program. But enforcing some sort of bright-line cutoff at 1956 or 1973 would create some weird situations. For example, how does 1955 DePauw Tigers football team compare to 1956 DePauw Tigers football team or 1973 DePauw Tigers football team? Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nIn the era before the creation of divisions, there was no official, verifiable demarcation of notability, and so WP:GNG appears to be the best (perhaps only legitimate) way to determine notability. It seems like you're saying that unless we can develop a bright-line rule for the old, non-divisional era, we ought not to have one for the modern era where stratification is official and verifiable? I just don't get the logic of that. Cbl62 (talk)\n\n{{{Ping|Cbl62) It's just seems funny to me what we could have an article for every year of DePauw football up through 1955 and then suddenly in 1956 or 1973, because DePauw is then NCAA College Division or NCAA Division III, the individual season no long warrant articles, even though the level of competition and the degree of media coverage is more or less the same as it is for 1955. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nEnd goal? Are these proposals intended to be advice for project members, essays to be cited at AfDs, or as a change to NSPORTS to supercede GNG?—Bagumba (talk)\n\nThe first two. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nHopefully, if project members are creating these articles, they have a good track record on notability, and we can even convince then to cite 3-4 pieces of significan coverage, even if it's just on the article talk page. For those with a bad track record on notability, proj member or not, a WP:TBAN on team season creations can be a last resort option.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nDI teams = automatic notability? Is the corollary of this argument \"Division I seasons are automatically notable\" because they represent competition at the top division of the sport? (Receiving press coverage simply by virtue of playing in the top level?) I'm not challenging this notion, just verifying this is the policy as it would apply to perennial basement teams like 2018 Kent State, 2018 Texas State, or 2018 New Mexico State that other than their division status, don't seem very notable. Hoof Hearted (talk) (On a side note, I just read the Family of WikiProjects section on this project page and must give kudos to the author(s)!)\n\nComment Could I potentially add an option, it would be \"In addition to articles that pass WP:GNG, conference championship seasons, and/or playoff appearances are notable.\" This seems like a good compromise, we don't have articles for a season that a team goes 0-11, but can for teams that win their conference, or make the playoffs as auto-bids aren't always granted to conference champs. This way we have a common sense approach for keeping articles that meet WP:GNG and can have a clear cut guideline for everything else. In addition, this also would provide justification to keep the standings templates and conference championship team navboxes that have become recently created. My only question is will this apply to FCS teams, or do they automatically pass notability?-UCO2009bluejay (talk)\n\nThe problem is that if it is a conference championship or a playoff appearance, it's likely going to generate the press required to pass GNG. And if it doesn't generate the press to pass GNG then we shouldn't say \"oh, and this one too even though it doesn't pass GNG\" --00:03, 3 November 2019 (UTC)\n\n@UCO2009bluejay: Teams that go winless are frequently more notable than middling .500 teams due to the historically bad season they just completed. I know what you're getting at, I just wanted to be devil's advocate that winless teams are more interesting / notable than 6–6 squads. SportsGuy789 (talk)\n\n@Bagumba: Responding to you above which says \"If the only sources we have are stat lines...\" The 1973 San Diego Toreros football team article, which consensus states clearly passes WP:GNG in the AfD so far, is primarily sourced to the team's media guide. this is four sentences and a box score, [2] four sentences and a box score, [3] eight sentences and no box score, [4] two sentences no box score, [5] three sentences and a box score, [6] three sentences and a box score, [7] seven sentences no box score. This last one is interesting considering the page it's on actually features a full feature story about Palomar College's game against Riverside, a community college - should those seasons also be considered wiki-notable? Likewise here - the community college football game actually ran on the front page! I'm not trying to litigate the AfD here - there's a couple feature stories I've left out here (though a WP:AUD would show they're pretty local) and I don't really care that much - but I think the context is very important here, and I think we're doing a terrible job at the moment at differentiating between routine stories and stories which actually demonstrate notable seasons per WP:GNG. SportingFlyer T·C\n\n@SportingFlyer: I don't judge the article on it's current state, but instead on what it potentially could be (WP:SURMOUNTABLE). While I'm usually concerned about whether stats cited to stats sites or media guides are really significant or trivial WP:OR, the ones listed there at least conceivably could be mentioned by some (yet undiscovered) independent source. The fact that there is WP:SUSTAINED coverage on the season by multiple sources makes the season (not the individual games) notable.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nSo if I wrote an article called 1973 Palomar College Football Season, you'd be a keep? SportingFlyer T·C\n\nI'd have to judge the multiple sources (i.e. different publishers) you find for it.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nNo worries, I'm mostly trying to prove a point here. Most sports have a firm cutoff for what sorts of seasons are notable - see Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2017–18 Leyton Orient F.C. season (note I'm a keep !vote there, and that is at a national level of the English structure where every match is covered by BBC - one of the top 116 teams that year, so within the range of D-I college football.) 2002–03 St. Vincent-St. Mary Fighting Irish men's basketball team is probably the best example I can find for basketball - certainly that team's season had significant coverage? And Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2009 Portland Beavers season was a AAA team which a quick Newspapers.com search showed received coverage in multiple newspapers (though the Portland newspaper is missing that year) and that was still deleted. SportingFlyer T·C\n\nMy cutoff is based on the sources, not based on any particular threshhold I have for a sport. For LeBron's HS team, IIRC, that was pretty much all about coverage because of LeBron that devolved into WP:NOTDIARY. Sometimes the outcome is a result of who shows up (or doesn't) at a given discussion.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nThere is a discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Troy–UAB football rivalry (3rd nomination) in which you might be interested. UW Dawgs (talk)\n\nIs that really supposed to be a rivalry? I guess it doesn't take much for something to be one--South Alabama–Troy football rivalry is six years old. Drmies (talk)\n\nDo we use AP rankings or CFP rankings for FBS games played after November 5 (when the first CFP poll was released). I edit PSU and looked back on previous years where it appeared that we continued to use the AP rankings for whole season, even after the CFP poll was released. Was there a consensus to switch to the CFP and I missed weighing in on the discussion? Just wondering as I see many FBS articles being switched to the CFP tonight. Bob305 (talk)\n\nAre you talking about the schedule tables? Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nI've seen this in both the schedule tables and on at least the Big Ten conference's standings box. I reverted the changes on the pages that I'm actively involved in editing as it seems detrimental to me to have rankings flip part way through the season, both in terms of understanding context for the progression of a team during the season and when comparing a team's performance year over year.Gopherdan (talk)\n\nYes, I'm seeing it scheduling tables. Some diffs like [8] and [9], as well as [10] and [11]. Also here is an example in a game summary box: [12]. (Thanks, GDan for your reverts. Looking forward to a great game this weekend.) Bob305 (talk)\n\nI'm not a fan of the \"CFP after November 5\" model either. Just keep it consistent with the AP throughout the year. Ostealthy (talk)\n\nI'd prefer the switch to CFP after November 5 since that's what TV broadcasts use in their score bugs. Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nI never noticed that. Perhaps it's time for a change. It still seems a little odd to switch polls mid-season on the schedules (only because the CFP starts in the latter half). Even though it's noted in the footnote, how would we feel about a symbol or superscript notation after the rank number to indicate a change in poll? Hoof Hearted (talk)\n\nI think switching to CFP makes sense as it is the most meaningful poll. I think denoting it in the schedule beside the rank is a must. Either way it can cause confusion. KD0710 (talk)\n\nIn places where we only show one poll, we should go with AP only for consistency. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nIn the final AP poll of 2014 before the playoffs and bowl games were announced, Baylor was #4. However, Baylor was #5 in the CFP ranking and was not included in the playoffs. Wouldn't it be confusing for a reader to see Baylor ranked #4 on our schedule and yet not play in the semi-finals? Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\ncomment I have both feet firmly planted in \"you guys decide and tell me what you figured out.\"--Paul McDonald (talk)\n\n@Eagles247:, less confusing than switching polls mid-table, and the confusion will be inherent in the subject itself (which we can't control), not in our presentation (which we can). There should also be sufficient description in the prose of the relevant articles about playoff selection. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nIt should not even be a question. Per WP:RS, wikipedia goes with what reliable sources use. If the NCAA and the media switch over to the CFP ranking, then the articles should reflect that as well. It doesn't matter if someone finds it confusing, it's what the sources reflect so we go with that.--JOJ Hutton\n\nIt should be noted that the NCAA officially recognizes both polls, the CFP is not affiliated with the NCAA. The media does switch over to CFP so I have no problem with also doing so as long as it is noted in the footer of the schedule tables as it currently is.Mjs32193 (talk)\n\nWell if the media switches then they would be considered a Reliable Source, and WP:RS is a core content policy, which should not be ignored.--JOJ Hutton\n\nAP. Flipping to a different ranking system mid-season is unnecessary, period. Additionally, the current Template:CFB schedule and its predecessor have trained editors to supply AP Poll rankings (is the thought to add a qualifier to the help text to the schdule, such as \"AP Poll until CFP Rankings are active\"?) The Template:CFB Standings End (\"2019 SEC standings\") defaults to AP Poll and I'm unaware of any FBS instances which diverge from AP Poll (from 1936 inception to present). So \"2019 Alabama Crimson Tide football team might be #2 in the current \"CFP row\" in the schedule, while the article concurrently displays #3 via the embedded Template:2019 SEC football standings. We also have related display locations such as Category:Lists of college football seasons, Category:Lists of college bowl games by team, and Category:Lists of college football head coaches which display AP (and Coaches). So another foreseeable downside of mid-season reversal to CFP appears to editor/reader confusion and spill-through between article types when the AP differs with CFP. Lastly, CFP is a seeding poll and has no post-bowl, final ranking. So there are some interesting consequences such as \"Consensus national champion, AP #1, Coaches #1 and CFP #4 2017 Alabama Crimson Tide football team.\" UW Dawgs (talk)\n\nWhat about adding a second column (when applicable) for CFP rankings? Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nI assume you're talking about the schedule tables here? That's an interesting idea. Are CFP rankings presented for the opponent too? Do you need separate columns? What about something like the table at 1950 Michigan Wolverines football team, which shows both AP and Coaches Poll rankings? Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nYes, I'm referring to the schedule tables, and I suppose CFP rankings would need to be shown for opponents as well in this case. I'm not really a fan of how the 1950 Michigan table looks, but it could just be because I'm so used to the other layout. I'm also not sure about adding at least two more columns to these. Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nPart of me wonders, is this simply a case of trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist? There's already a section of the standard CFB team wiki that displays rankings from the CFP, AP, and Coaches Poll. So the rankings are already present and available for tracking. My vote is also AP, this historical relevance and consistency are most important to me, and trying to capture the nuance of the changing source of rankings in footnotes just doesn't feel satisfactory to me to prevent confusion.Gopherdan (talk)\n\nHas anyone done a survey to see which poll the major sports networks and web sites use? Seems like that should be the starting point. If most of those sources use AP throughout the season, we ought to follow that. If they switch part-way through the season when CFP becomes available, we ought to follow that. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nFrom what Ive seen, they switch as well.JOJ Hutton\n\nI think it's worth being a bit cautious about referencing the rankings on various media networks, as they aren't objective in this instance. Go to USA Today, for example, and you'll see them use the coaches poll as that's run/sponsored by them, and similarly all AP news stories use the AP rankings. As for the CFP rankings, ESPN switches to the CFP rankings because they pay millions of dollars for the rights to broadcast the rankings shows and have a vested interest in legitimizing them. I recall that when they first came out, there was viewer confusion because of the differences in rankings from one network to another. Given ESPN's dominance, eventually the TV networks switched over to using the CFP rankings as well. In terms of a reliable source to reference, I'm more inclined to follow Sports-References' lead as a historical source for information without any sort of financial entanglement with a given ranking, and that site has chosen to use the AP poll when referencing rankings.Gopherdan (talk)\n\nWhen the Penn State radio broadcast came on the air for the pre-game show this morning, they made no mention of the CFP ranking, but rather announced it was a game between #5 Penn State and #13 Minnesota (which are their AP rankings). I'm more inclined to use AP throughout the page(s). Bob305 (talk)\n\nLooks like the networks are using the CFP rankings. They are reliable sources.JOJ Hutton\n\nThere is a discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Miami–South Florida football rivalry in which you may be interested.

Ejgreen77 (talk)\n\nWhat does everyone think about these coaching tree list sections that keep cropping up on more and more coach bio articles, e.g. Tom Gorman (American football)? Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nI think they are appropriate if limited just to head coaches (as opposed to other notable assistants or administrators or a list of players coached). They've existed on countless NFL and CFB head coach articles since almost the beginning of Wikipedia.108.21.182.146 (talk) 20:13, 23 January 2020 (UTC). Also, there was a thread here, and the consensus as per User:Tarl N. on 21:35, 29 January 2017 (UTC) was to limit it to head coaches. Granted, the Belichick article lists non-head coaches as well, but that's questionable and likely limited to him due to his unique role in modern football. I don't think that should be the norm.108.21.182.146 (talk)\n\n108.21.182.146, thanks for commenting here. Well, these certainly haven't existed in their current numbers \"since almost the beginning of Wikipedia\". There has indeed been substantial coverage of several coaches with particularly well-noted coaching trees going back several years, e.g. Bill Walsh (American football coach), Sid Gillman, and Fielding H. Yost. But the sorts of sections like the one you added to Tom Gorman (American football), have seemed to mostly crop up in the last year or so. As a side note, such section are often rife with formatting issues (before I clean them up). More importantly, I wonder if they mostly constitute undue fancruft, as we're unlikely to find reliable third-parties sources that talk about Tom Gorman's coaching tree. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nYou're welcome. As for Tom Gorman, see this, from the Andy Pilney article: https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/02/13/85259393.pdf. I apologize for formatting issues (entirely unintentional). As for the coaching trees, I don't think its a problem. Its a recency bias. Older coaches don't get the same depth of info on their pages because they coached so long ago. Modern day coaches articles have coaching trees in them, even less prominent ones. Should Mike Pettine have a coaching tree? Nothing more than recency bias distinguishes him from some of the coaches we're talking about here. Should Mike Locksley? Or Bobby Williams? Denny Stolz? My point is simply that what is good for more recent coaches is good for older ones, with the same level of sourcing (ie, only in rare circumstances have I seen sourcing in a coaching tree section). Also I recall seeing coaching trees on random articles for a long time now. Lastly, please don't judge me for being an IP user. My edits are in good faith.108.21.182.146 (talk) .\n\nAlso, the conversation here is quite instructive to this one. I agree with one of the commenters there, its not fluff or trivia, its a curated, formatted, and selective list based on objective criteria (ie, being a head coach) that shows relationships, coaching styles, connections, and history.108.21.182.146 (talk)\n\n108.21.182.146, certainly no bad faith detected here. I don't think these coaching tree sections are any more or less appropriate for coaches of different eras, although \"coaching tree\" seems to be a neologism that has come in use in the past maybe three or four decades. I know it's common for sources about a coach to mention other coaches they worked with. It's just far less common to find sources talking about a group of coaches who are all descended from one coach's \"tree\". Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nThis was discussed over at the NFL project back in 2017 here. Ejgreen77 (talk)\n\nWell, User:Lizard the Wizard's final comment in that discussion proved to be prescient. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nHeh, I don't even remember making that comment. I'd say they're fine since if the sources are there. They can be a good illustration of a coach's legacy. Lizard (talk)\n\nI continue to think a \"coaching tree\" should be the exception rather than the rule. It makes sense for long-time notable coaches who have actually generated a \"tree\". In the case of an ordinary coach who simply has a couple assistants that go on to become head coaches, that's really just routine ... and amounts to more of a \"coaching twig\" rather than a tree. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nI have nominated Template:1925 NCAA independents football records and six other similar templates for deletion.

I've been working on building out the standings for the 1934 college football season from the 1935 Spalding guide I recently acquired. You can see how big Template:1934 Eastern college football independents records is already, and I haven't even added a bunch of schools from Pennsylvania yet. The now-D3 schools in PA that are now mostly a part of Centennial Conference or the Middle Atlantic Conference as well as the now-D2 schools are now part of Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference were all independent at the time, joining the Ivies, the smaller New England schools that are in the New England Small College Athletic Conference now, as well as the traditional eastern independent powers like Penn State, Syracuse, Pitt, etc. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nNot sure about further subdivisions beyond the four regions, but jealous that you own the 1935 Spalding guide.

If someone could either take a look at these and review them themselves or give your opinion on what would happen at AfD, I'll go ahead and accept/decline them. SportingFlyer T·C\n\nMumme is offensive coordinator for a Division I FBS team and as such would most likely pass WP:GNG, though I have not searched for sources. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nMumme coverage includes: this, this part 1/part 2, and this part 1/part 2. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nEh, it's all coverage of the local coordinator at a less important school. Would it pass at AfD? SportingFlyer T·C\n\nI believe so. The coverage has depth and extends to multiple, reliable sources. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nThank you. Just G6'd the redirect and will accept Mumme when able. SportingFlyer T·C\n\n@SportingFlyer: I've deleted the redirect. After you accept the AFC, I need to do a histmerge as it appears some of the revisions I've deleted were reused in the creation of the draft article. Please let me know when this is completed. Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\n@Eagles247: Mumme is done. Any guidance on McClure would be appreciated. Over to you for the histmerge, thanks. SportingFlyer T·C\n\nLooks like someone already closed McClure. If someone wants to dig deeper, any additional sources could be added to the draft to support a re-review. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nAre we having school-by-school rushing leaders templates now? I just saw Template:Michigan Wolverines football rushing leaders navbox, created by Cbl62 and edited by Jweiss11. I have never seen such a template. Is this the next wave?--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nI think its WP:TCREEP for the many accomplished NFL backs that will get yet another nav. Lists are fine for major programs—throw them in a \"see also\".—Bagumba (talk)\n\nHow many schools have this template type?-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nI created them for USC, Alabama, and Michigan -- all schools with long histories of great running backs. I have long believed we need some tool to allow us to navigate between a major program's running backs. We have navboxes for quarterbacks, and the argument for doing it for running backs is IMO equally strong. The QB and the RB are the driving forces of an offense and the glory positions filled with great and notable players. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nThe navboxes can be seen here: Template:Michigan Wolverines football rushing leaders navbox, Template:USC Trojans football rushing leaders navbox, Template:Alabama Crimson Tide football rushing leaders navbox. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nFor players like Ted Kress, Tony Branoff, Fred Baer, Russell Davis, Harlan Huckleby, Lawrence Ricks, Rick Rogers, Tony Boles, Jon Vaughn, Ricky Powers, B. J. Askew, Brandon Minor, and dozens more, being a major program's lead rusher is a career-defining characteristic -- and results in absolutely no navbox clutter. Moreover, I've never really understood the argument that a \"See also\" section linking to a \"List of Team X rushing leaders\" creates any less clutter than a collapsible navbox. Cbl62 (talk)\n\n\"See also\" is a worst-case scenario. Ideally, just link directly in the article where it says \"led the Roadrunners in rushing\". Moreover, if the link was important and not already in the article, you'd want it in \"see also\" because the 50+% (and growing) of readers using mobile devices don't even see navboxes.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nTony, thanks for opening the discussion here. I’m not a fan of these navboxes and voiced my concern about them with Cbl when he created them last week. I’m with Bagumba here on the navbox creep. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nI also believe that it is a case of navbox creep and unnecessary clutter. Best, GPL93 (talk)\n\nI posted about this on Talk:2019 College Football All-America Team a while back but it solicited no response. Tere were two ties this year in first-team selections for consensus: Zack Baun and Micah Parsons for the third linebacker spot and Wyatt Davis and Tristan Wirfs for offensive line. Davis has the edge over Wirfs as Davis was named to three 2nd teams (AFCA, FWAA, WCFF) to Wirfs' two (AFCA, AP) so that's it was clear-cut on who was a consensus pick for the final Offensive Line spot. However, Baun and Parsons are in a dead tie with two 1st teams and 3 second teams apiece. In these situations do we include both of them as Consensus All-Americans or neither of them? Best, GPL93 (talk)\n\nHas this happened in the past, and if so, how was it resolved? If it hasn't, I'd vote for including both.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\nHello all. I’m in a discussion regarding what Infobox to use for Steve Spurrier on the talk page. I would like for some input on the discussion if anyone is able to! Talk:Steve Spurrier#Infobox format.

Please see the discussion at Template talk:Infobox NCAA football school#Requested move 3 February 2020. Thanks, Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nWe have a bit of looming issue regarding tables, particularly those standardized with templates (e.g. Template:CFB schedule, Template:CFB schedule). User:Koavf has begun an effort to add captions to many table likes these; see: Template:CBB yearly record start, Andy Reid#Head coaching record, Template:NFL roster, Template:Football squad start. His justification is to service accessibility for screen readers for the visually impaired, citing Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility/Data tables tutorial#Proper table captions and summaries. The result is that his effort is creating redundant table headings that simply don't make sense give how we've structured thousands of articles; see Ralph Jones#Head coaching record where the \"Coaching statistics\" heading for the college basketball record table is redundant and non-sensible clutter. User:Jonesey95, User:S.A. Julio, User:Penepi, User:Eagles247 have been involved in this issue elsewhere. We need to have unified discussion about this somewhere now. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nThere has already been significant discussion at Template talk:Football squad start and at Template talk:CBB yearly record start, but since this affects multiple sports' templates, Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Accessibility is probably the best place to have a discussion. I recommend putting a notice at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Football and at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject American football and at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College Basketball with a link to that discussion. – Jonesey95 (talk)\n\nTo be clear, this is not redundant to the level three headings in articles. Headings provide a different semantic meaning and structure to a document than the caption on a table. Note that captions are a high-priority and easy-to-implement accessibility feature and we are obliged to make this change. ―Justin (koavf)❤T☮C☺M☯\n\nJust a heads up, the issues with Template:NFL roster have now been resolved per the discussion here. Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nWe are obliged to make a change, but some of the changes that Koavf has been making have been inaccurate, unaesthetic, or both. As shown at {{NFL roster}}, it is possible to meet multiple goals through consensus discussions and teamwork. Hence my suggestion that a wider discussion, and experiments in template sandboxes, may lead to proposed changes that meet accessibility, accuracy, and aesthetic concerns. – Jonesey95 (talk)\n\nFootball coaching bio article currently up for AfD. If you have a view one way or the other, you may weigh in at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eugene Messler. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nCbl62, Jweiss11, Editorofthewiki you guys did a very nice job, great work on this one. Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nMaybe I'm being a grumpy old man, but the proliferation of \"coaching trees\" in the last few days is noteworthy. A coaching tree in appropriate circumstances is a measure of the legacy of highly influential coaches such as Tom Landry, Bill Bellichick, Bill Walsh, etc. But in recent days, there's been a proliferation of such \"coaching trees\" to ordinary coaches where, as a matter of simple routine, a couple of assistants go on to become head coaches. Just in the last couple days, a new user, User:FlaviusFunderburke, has added trees to dozens of coaching bios, including Rudy Hubbard (1 twig), Steve Sebo (1 twig), Carl Selmer] (1 twig), Lloyd Eaton (1 twig), Tony Knap (1 twig), Homer Rice (2 twigs), Jack Christiansen (2 twigs), Tony Mason (3 twigs), Tim Brewster (3 twigs)Foge Fazio (3 twigs), Don Read (3 twigs), Mike Gottfried (4 twigs), and Warren Powers (4 twigs). In my opinion, such coaching twigs add no real value and simply add clutter. While I appreciate Flavius' dedication, I think greater discretion should be used in selecting coaching bios where a \"coaching tree\" actually reflects a lasting legacy. I know this was raised by Jweiss11 just last week, but the recent proliferation leads me to raise it again. Should we impose some sort of guideline limiting the use of such trees? A numeric limit of, say, five branches? Ten branches? Other ideas? Cbl62 (talk)\n\nI think I'm in favor of always including coaching trees, no matter how trivial. The concept of coaching trees is something coaches and media care a great deal about. The Mike Leach Air Raid tree, the Rich Rod spread option tree, these are concepts that are considered an important narrative of the coaching profession. A coaches' history coaching with or under other coaches is also heavily discussed. It is therefore notable what coaches spawned off every coaching tree, and a lack of \"branches\" is itself notable. I fail to see how including this information is clutter. Ostealthy (talk)\n\n@Cbl62, thank you for reaching out. The problem is its also recency bias. Why should, say, Tim Brewster have a coaching tree and not older coaches? (Btw, I didn't create Brewster's tree, I reformatted it and added additional coaches). Denny Stolz? Hue Jackson? Its also a living project, with coaches added upon discovery. Discretion is also arbitrary, and I'm not a fan of arbitrary standards. Coaching trees limited to assistants who became head coaches is clear, firm, and will not generate debates (like say, including \"prominent assistants\" on a tree like on the Belichick page, which is entirely subjective and arbitrary). Coaching trees are uniquely limited to football due to the size of the staffs, historical connections, and such, but I absolutely believe they belong, and every coach page I have added a tree to would have already had one had they coached within the last 20-25 years (like Danny Hope and Tim Beckman. There's no reason those should have trees but not Fazio or Powers (which are still being researched and will have more additions). However, I'm not personally a fan of listing \"People Coach X has coached under\" but I will not remove that absent any consensus to, and I don't feel strongly enough about it to raise it as an issue.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\nFlavius: Thanks for your well expressed views. Ostealthy: I used the term \"clutter\" in the sense that it adds a whole extra section for a reader to navigate, which in some cases is warranted. My view may be the minority, and if there's a consensus that coaching trees are appropriate in all cases, so be it. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nCbl62 You're welcome. You also said something interesting, about the coaching trees adding a whole extra section for someone to navigate. I'll respond with this--I have no personal preference where on a page they should go, or if they should be a whole separate section or a subsection of a Coaching Career section (like in John Madden, though that's probably a unique situation because of that article and the extent of his post-coaching career). I'm interested more in the content. If there's a consensus as to placement within a page, I'm open to ideas and happy to abide by any such consensus. I'm putting them at the bottom of pages partly to avoid the cluttering that you mentioned and partly because conceptually a tree belongs at the bottom because its more about the legacy of the specific coach and that doesn't necessarily belong higher up in the page.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\nI feel largely the same way as Cbl62 here. In the case of particularly influential coaches like Walsh, Landry, Sid Gillman, Belichick, etc, where you have reliable sources explicitly discussing the \"Bill Walsh coaching tree\" or the like, some sort of coverage of that tree is well-warranted. But for more run-of-the-mill coaches like Carl Selmer or Tim Brewster, it strikes me a rather crufty to have a \"coaching tree\" section. I would expect that a large portion of coaches who served as a head coach for more than a year or two, particularly since the middle of the 20th century, when football staffs got much larger, are going to have at least two or three assistants or players who went on to become head coaches. I don't think anyone is arguing that these sections are okay for more contemporary coaches, but not okay for guys who coached 50 or more years ago. It's just that these coaching tree sections seem to have largely started with more complementary coaches and are now working themselves into more and more bio articles for coaches from yesteryear. Since Cbl62 tends to work more on historical stuff than most other editors, he may just be noticing this trend now. I've been aware of this happening for at least a year now. But as Cbl62, notes, it seems to be accelerating of late, due to the efforts of FlaviusFunderburke and others. Whatever we choose to do here, we should work toward a unified policy with Wikipedia:WikiProject National Football League. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nJweiss11, the problem is the concept of a football coaching tree really stretches back to the founding of the game. For example, in the context of Knute Rockne, schools couldn't wait to hire former Rockne players to coach their programs (you should know this, JWeiss11, as you've created or edited a fair number of those wiki pages). Its how football spreads, and its how the game grows (like the joke in the NFL the last few seasons is teams wanting to hire anyone who has ever shaken hands with Sean McVay, let alone coached for him). Also, I thought that Wikipedia:WikiProject National Football League already discussed it and determined that assistants who later became head coaches were fine for the trees. The real problem is the idea of a reliable sourced coaching tree vs. more \"run of the mill\" types tends to be code for \"if its been recent enough to have a reliable source on the internet refer to it as a coaching tree, then its ok; otherwise, bad.\" Well, Ralph Jordan and Wallace Wade have stadiums named for them, and have a coaching tree that would rock your world, but looking at wikipedia, they are just another name on the server. Its shouldn't be up to us to determine who is worthy and who is not. There's a standard, its been applied for more recent coaches, and it should apply equally for older ones. And that there are \"stubs\" is just part of that. Basically, as long as it's ok for Hue Jackson to have a coaching tree, then Carl Selmer can have one, too (especially when Selmer's overall coaching career is far more impactful than Hue Jackson's, but since he coached pre-internet, Hue's is many times longer. And basically, if these older coaches are entitled to have a page in the first place, then let's put the appropriate content on there.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\nI don't know many times I have to say this, but, yes, I agree we should have the same set of standards, irrespective of when the subject coached, in 1880, 1950, or 2020. The Ralph Jordan article isn't suffering from a lack of a coaching tree section, so much it is lacking development of the prose and has almost no sourcing. But the lead of article clearly identifies him as a Hall of Famer, national title-winner, and the winningest coach in Auburn history, not just another \"name of the server\". The infobox and head coaching record tables look solid there. I've spent the good portion of the last decade standardizing and fleshing those out across thousands of articles. Haven't had time to write a GA-class body for those yet! The Wallace Wade article is much more developed (largely due to User:MisterCake), has good sourcing, and does, in fact, include an extensive coaching tree. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nMy bad on the Wade article. I got it confused with Frank Thomas. Though the Wade tree isn't fully formed and has on it former players (something which is more appropriate for that era of football than the modern day). Jweiss11 It came across that you were taking another whack at the insertion of coaching trees on pages and seemed you would just as soon standardize it by striking coaching trees from most articles, which I strongly disagree with. I am quite familiar with Ralph Jordan beyond his wiki page, but if he were coaching today he'd have a beautiful tree. That was my point, and lesser coaches would too, and that's ok. Anyways, I would like to confirm consensus on coaching trees is to keep them as they are now so we can move forward. If anyone wants to help me tackle larger coaching tree projects, like Bear Bryant (has only a paragraph that is begging for more names) or Woody Hayes (facially incomplete), I'd be happy to talk.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\nCoaching trees are trivial and don't belong in bios unless there is adequate coverage that shows that it's a notable topic for that subject. Unconditionally including these for each coach is somewhat akin to a team article exhaustively including head-to-head \"rivalry\" records for the all-time opponents of a team.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nAgree with above - some coaching trees will be notable and be written about in reliable sources, and we can include these then. As a whole, though, I would consider them original research if they're not sourced to anything, and I would caution against sourcing them to a directory website. SportingFlyer T·C\n\nSo far we have four users (Cbl62, Jweiss11, Bagumba, SportingFlyer) opposing the rollout of coaching trees in routine coaching bios and two users (Ostealthy and Flavius) supporting same. Further opinions welcome. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nCbl62, thanks for your input. However there are users in the chat initiated by JWeiss11 above from last week on topic who weighed in in favor of coaching trees and there’s the consensus reached in 2017 about keeping them on the NFL page. Counting those votes there are more in favor of trees. Also, this discussion would need to be cross posted on the NFL page because any consensus needs to be standard. Further, this is the second chat in 8 days about this topic, which seems less than appropriate when there’s already an established consensus. Further, you called his “the rollout of coaching trees in routine coaching bios” which is wildly incorrect. They’ve already been rolled out in routines bios—it’s that those bios are of more recent coaches like Roger Theder. I am aapplying accepted consensus to other coaching bios that are older. The opposition comes across as regency bias, the implicit assumption that somethings less noteworthy because it’s older. Lastly; I default to good faith but I’d be lying if I didn’t say I’m a little concerned about some WP:CANVASSING going on here by editors who don’t like coaching trees and deem them trivial on older bios but haven’t raised these concerns all that much previously relative to their long time existence on coaching bio pages. Lastly, my reading of WP:CON requires much more than a half dozen of us discussing changing something that’s been in place in CFB and NFL coaching articles overall for at least a decade (in some form). See WP:CCC (“ Editors may propose a change to current consensus, especially to raise previously unconsidered arguments or circumstances. On the other hand, proposing to change a recently established consensus can be disruptive.”) I welcome continued discussion on this point and will abide by a fairly achieved consensus. As for sourcing, I’m applying the same sourcing that already exists on existing coaching tree pages, and I don’t see any issue with sourcing them to reference pages.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\nWhat canvassing are you referring to? And there was no consensus in 2017 to permit coaching trees on every ordinary coaching bio. The discussion there related to the Bill Belichick tree, which is anything but an ordinary case. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nCanvassing in the sense of the appearance in consecutive comments only of those oppose. Again, that’s not an accusation, I was just voicing a suspicion. As for the Belichick page, that’s been cited as the standard to be applied to all coaches (per the link above). I agree Belichick is an unusual case but let’s be honest here, coaching trees have been de facto prevalent on coaching bio pages for a long time now, both on notable coach pages and on random ones like Hue Jackson]] and it’s not yet clear what has changed or what new arguments exist to challenge them. I don’t think it’s realistic to imply that they exist in violation of consensus, and my reading of WP:CCC is that while consensus is not permanent, it’s incumbent on those seeking to change consensus to raise previously unconsidered arguments or show a change in circumstance. Here, the only changed circumstance seems to boil down to “new guy adding coaching trees to pages of coaches I’ve never heard of and I don’t like it, even if more recent random coaches like Tim Beckman and Adam Gase have them.” That subjective recency bias is not in my view appropriate grounds to challenge them. I’m happy to listen to further arguments and the input of the NFL page folks because what applies here will surely apply there.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\n@FlaviusFunderburke: Please redact your canvassing concerns. Even bringing in a suspicion of canvassing may be considered a personal attack, but you have absolutely no evidence considering all of us who oppose at least watch the college football talk page. I don't always agree with Cbl62, but I do respect them as an editor, and I trust they wouldn't canvass individuals just to \"win\" this discussion. SportingFlyer T·C\n\n@SportingFlyer:, based on your representation and trust that the other would not canvass, as a sign of ,y good faith, I retract expressing my concern about potential canvassing. Once I figure out how to edit with strikehroughs, I will amend those sentences accordingly. Thanks.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\nYou can use the strikethrough code tag (like I've done here.) SportingFlyer T·C\n\nWe'd need to source every single branch/limb for these coaching trees first and foremost. Many of the college coaching trees are likely original research and wouldn't be supported by independent third-party sources without doing some synthesis. I oppose the mass addition of these trees while their significance to specific coaches is not readily known. As far as the canvassing concerns, all of the editors who have weighed in to this discussion so far are regulars on this talk page and I see no reason to be skeptical of their intentions. Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nI've just notified WikiProject NFL about this discussion. I was planning to do that anyway before FlaviusFunderburke suggested it above. As I mentioned above, we should aim here to build a consensus on this topic that spans the two projects. I think it's generally good practice in the body of a coach bio article to discuss the other notable coaches the subject worked with, ideally with sourcing that explicitly makes the various connections. I did this a few months back in building out the article for the relatively obscure Harold Mayo. The coaching career section there mentions his relationships with Jim Hess, Bo Hagan, and Dean Slayton. But I doubt any of these four have an influence that rises of the level of warranting a coaching tree section/list, and I think you're unlikely to find any sourcing that explicitly refers such trees. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nThank you, and I genuinely appreciate the neutral way you posted the chat on there.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\n‘’’’Thanks [[User:Eagles247|<font face=\"Verdana\" color=\"003B48\", sourcing is a fair concern and something I’ve wondered myself, but sourcing standards should be consistent across all coaching articles. There are no sources on a vast majority of the coaching trees on coaching pages and those may run up against original research issues. I was and am simply applying what’s been done. I’m happy to have a discussion on sourcing and clarify when it is and is not original research both in the coaching tree and navbox contest. For example, assistant coaches are listed in championship team banners/navboxes. An example is the navbox for some of the Michigan State national champion teams in the 1950s and 1960s. Those aren’t sourced but they absolutely belong and deserve to be listed. But a consistent sourcing standard is something that should definitely be decided on. However how do you propose to assess the significance to specific coaches? What specific coaches? We run into very tricky territory there being subjective like that.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\n‘’’’’’’I also want to highlight this discussion page from 2018: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ryan_Day_(American_football)#Coaching_tree. Very relevant and an excellent statement why trees are acceptable, standard, and not trivia.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\nI added/expanded coaching trees for articles I've just worked on, such as Chris Creighton, Sam Pittman, and Brad McCaslin. I did that because I'd seen them elsewhere, but I don't know that they add all the much. Ideally all the coaches listed are name-checked somewhere in the article. I've seen some discussion of Creighton's coaching tree (in the context of McCaslin and I think Steve Ryan), but sources don't address it in any depth. I'd be on board with restricting such sections, perhaps with the guidance that they be rendered as prose, not lists. Mackensen (talk)\n\nMy issue with the lists on the articles you've just mentioned, as I've noted above, is that I would be well with my right to remove all of these lists for being unsourced and WP:OR, and these coaches would not have been necessarily considered part of the coaching \"tree\" anyways. I think a coaching tree article or section would be fine for coaches like Belichick or Andy Reid or Saban or Urban Meyer, whose trees have been well documented, but I don't think it should necessarily \"flow\" upstream unless the coach is a \"branch\" for a notable coach, and then it should be sourced and in prose. SportingFlyer T·C\n\nI agree with you in general on sourcing (even if I dispute that you’d be well within your rights to just revert something as being unsourced and possible OR as opposed to tagging it and giving the editor a chance to fix it). But the lack of sourcing isn’t limited there. For example, the tree on the Bill Parcells page isn’t sourced (but obviously could be in five minutes). But it isn’t right now. Now why would it be seemingly acceptable on the Parcells page, or for most of the head coach entries on the Belichick tree page, but on other pages it’s a problem? Is it because we’ve lived it? That we’ve experienced it? Not sure that’s appropriate (and reeks of recency bias) And why is it routine on the vast majority of coaching tree pages that there aren’t sourced? Where are the sources for the assistants listed in navboxes like this? It’s ok in a navbox but an OR violation in an article? Above all, I want to see standardization and consistency. What’s good for some coaching trees and navboxes should be good for all. If that means sourcing everything then that’s ok with me, but right now it’s undefined and a selectively raised issue. That leads to the class of coaches you believe would merit a coaching tree-Reid, Meyer, Saban, BB. Now I agree those coaches need tree sections. But how would you define that standard objectively? It’s not hall of fame coaches because I don’t believe any of those coaches are in a hall of fame yet (barring something crazy they all will be, but then again I’d have said the same about Barry Bonds in 1998, so that’s out as a potential standard). Number of wins? it can’t be championships because as of this writing Reid doesn’t have any. Number of years coaching? That would rule out one for Sean McVay. The uncertainty leads to an amorphous undefined standard that’s ripe for constant debate, struggle, and potentially edit warring (not from me though) of who is worthy. And it leads to the recency bias issues I have of sources will only be good if readily accessible (ie the internet) which will deprive fans and students and the curious of tracking the evolution of coaches, their connections, inspirations , and so forth. Overall, I just don’t see the issue with providing this information to a reader and allow them to see another connection to a name of the past.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\nA point by point response to your questions:\n\nYou are generally allowed to remove unsourced information, even if it can be contentious.\n\nA Parcells coaching tree article/section should be fine as a simple search brought up two articles immediately. A search for \"Chris Creighton\" \"Coaching Tree\" brings up only a single statistical database, a website called \"Coaching Tree Hot Seat.\" Our WP:OR policy means we need someone else to do the research for us, i.e. requires sources, not compile the information ourselves and put it here.\n\nI'm not entirely convinced the 1952 Michigan State template would pass a TfD, but templates are meant to be navigational and separate from article space. It's not WP:OR to look at a roster and then create a navigation box full of links. The 1952 Michigan State Spartans football team article desperately needs improvement, but it should be easy to see if those assistant coaches were actually the coaches for that team, since the point of the navigation box is to help the reader easily find other related articles. Creating a list of coaches that a coach has worked with isn't typically readily compiled in the same way and it would take research to compile this list. SportingFlyer T·C\n\nApplying Wikipedia rules, the objective standard is actually very simple: have secondary sources written about their coaching trees to a point where we can source them? SportingFlyer T·C\n\n@SportingFlyer:My responses:\n\n1) I thought unsourced information should be tagged as such and not just removed.\n\n2) I think we're talking past each other, as I am talking about a list of assistants who later became head coaches, and it seems like you're focusing on if others have termed that a \"tree\"\n\n3) I'm very confused, if its not WP:OR to look at a roster and create a navbox, how is it OR to list those assistant coaches on the head coaches tree? ]}Dan Devine]] is listed as an assistant coach for that team, but listing him on Biggie Munn's coaching tree would WP:OR? That seems like a distinction without a difference. Despite its name as a navbox, they are absolutely relied on as accurate, authoritative lists of rosters and coaches.\n\n4) Again, I think we may actually be talking about different, yet related things. I'm talking about a sourced listing of those assistants of a coach who later became a head coach, but I am not necessarily talking about a defined \"tree\" in the conceptual sense as used to discuss Paul Brown and others. However, if I were, I would point to this feature from the Wall Street Journal in 2015 as evidence that coaching trees have become a mainstream concept that no longer limited to some coaches. From the article: \"The select crew of 32 NFL coaches is more like a family tree than anything. Fans can study a coach’s pedigree by analyzing who he’s worked under, how those coaches have influenced his own schemes and strategy, and ultimately how his successors have fared when they move on to head coaching gigs of their own. Trying to make a clear picture of this intertwined network of coaches can be more confusing than trying to understand the complex schemes they use on Sundays. It’s a rabbit hole where one coach leads to another, and to another, and by the end it can be difficult to make sense of who’s really connected to whom. So the Wall Street Journal presents the official NFL coaching tree, detailing the sprawling web of head coaching relationships. Clicking on a coach will highlight every coach he worked under, until his first head coaching gig, and any coaches that worked for him and went on to become a head coach themselves, dating back to 1960.\" Granted this applied only to the NFL, but I think it sets forth the idea quite well that coaching \"trees\" have expanded beyond a select few influential coaches and is now a matter of encyclopedic interest for fans in general. There's also the coaching tree page, which was created in 2007 (and which survived deletion in 2011), and to me shows that there is general awareness and acceptance of the concept. I'll also point you to the arguments made here in defense of trees. Of particular, I want to emphasize this statement: \" I have always thought of coaching trees as standard, or at least widely accepted, content. I don't believe WP:TRIVIA applies at all to lists like this, but is instead intended for much more random, fluff type of information, often presented essentially as fun facts or entertainment. In other words, true trivia as in trivial information. I see a coaching tree as important, noteworthy information for coaches. It helps readers understand a coach's history in terms of the types of coaching styles and systems he was a part of as he worked his way up the coaching ladder.\" I would add it also helps us a coaches impact on the game through his disciples and coaching descendants.\n\nSurely we can reach some consensus on this point. I am a strong proponent that the information belongs, and my reading of the wikipedia standards is that they to not prevent or mandate exclusion of coaching trees. And I think that the long time presence of this information on decidedly non-legendary coach pages should not be discounted as a form of silent consensus (even if such consensus is the weakest form). However, scope, formatting and placement within articles is an area I would be happy to work out a consensus. I don't have a personal preference for how the information is presented (list at bottom, list elsewhere, narrative/paragraph(s) within the body of the bio, coaching tree navbox at the bottom of a page, something else). If that is of interest, I'd be happy to work with you on some potential templates/examples of how they can be done going forward. Thanks.

Lastly, my reading of that 2017 conversation was it was limited to BB because the actual talk spilled over from the BB talk page. Has there been a governing consensus about other pages? Because since that 2017 talk, the proliferation of coaching trees (before i started contributing) was extensive, appearing on just about every page for a current or recent coach. That consensus by silence is still consensus. Lastly, for the newbie, can you explain how WP:DUE applies here? That seems to be more for points of view; weighing sources, and balance, which to me doesn’t really apply here since this isn’t a balance issue. Thanks.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\nI'm not familiar with Day, so won't specifically comment. Silence is the weakest form of consensus. In any event, consensus can change, even if one existed for inclusion. My interpretation of WP:DUE is that if sources don't talk much about one's coaching tree, it's undue to take up much if any article space on the topic. There's also WP:ONUS: not everything that is true necessarily gets included. Regards.—Bagumba (talk)\n\n@Bagumba: Day is the Ohio State head coach, but I was more interested in your thoughts on the arguments made re: coaching trees than anything about Day in specific. I agree consensus can change, but my reading of that is there has to be new reasons or previously unconsidered argu,Mets or a change in circumstances (“ Editors may propose a change to current consensus, especially to raise previously unconsidered arguments or circumstances. On the other hand, proposing to change a recently established consensus can be disruptive.”). As for WP:ONUS, that’s a subjective consensus that needs to be researched, but I’d argue the longtime existence and widespread nature of coaching trees in articles deserves its own consideration and weight. Thanks.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\n@FlaviusFunderburke: I read your reply above and given that you admit you had no basis for it, I respectfully echo SportingFlyer's suggestion that you withdraw your allegation that \"I’m a little concerned about some WP:CANVASSING going on here by editors who don’t like coaching trees.\" Cbl62 (talk)\n\n@Cbl62:I replied to SportingFlyer that I was retracting my statement expressing concern about canvassing. I assume good faith and if he trusts there wasn’t any I accept that in good faith. Please accept my apologies.FlaviusFunderburke (talk)\n\nProposal\n\nI propose that we adopt a new standard for coaching tree list sections to cover all gridiron football coaches (perhaps with expansion to all sports coaches). In order to include a coaching tree list or section on a bio article, we must show that there are multiple, reliable third-party sources that specifically discuss, in a substantive manner, the given subject's \"coaching tree\" or legacy in terms of disciples becoming head coaches. While a source that simply notes that coach X was assistant for coach Y (e.g. [13], [14], [15]) could be used to build such a coaching tree section or list, it would not by itself show due-ness. Thoughts? Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nOn one point, I definitely agree: there should, in all situations, be links to sources showing, at a minimum, that Coach X is actually a member of/coached under Tree Y. Several questions I have off the top of my head: 1) How do we set the starting point of a \"tree\"? For example, it took me a few minutes to figure out that Bill Parcells is a branch of the Fielding Yost tree (Yost>George Little>Red Blaik>Paul Dietzel>Tom Cahill>Parcells). I wouldn't necessarily defend the idea that Parcells is a branch of the Yost tree, but its legitimate. Somewhat more seriously, are Landry and Lombardi their own trees or from the Steve Owens>Jim Lee Howell tree? That's a much closer call in my opinion. 2) Coverage of coaching trees is, as you've previously stated, a more modern concept in terms of something reporters and others have written about (even if the idea of hiring people who played for/coached under legends is as old as football itself). We may run into sourcing issues for some of those bigger coaches. On the flip side, there are modern sources for the, among other things, the Dick MacPherson coaching tree [1] and Kyle Whittingham [2] and an older name (on whose tree I worked on) John Ralston[3]. As a result, this could end up filled with a recency bias, which is something that I was trying to counter by working on older coach pages. As for formatting, I was looking at the Red Blaik page, and that casual, narrative form of his coaching tree worked very well there, and merits consideration for the template of future tree sections/paragraphs. 3) For older coaches like Rockne, he didn't have a coaching tree per se, but that was a time when schools across America were hiring star players to start/build programs. How should we deal with those situations? I am very much not a fan of listing tree members based on playing under a coach in the modern era, but historically (pre-WWII especially), that was far more common.[4] (Only one or two of those coaches listed \"coached\" under Rockne--they played for him). That's something that would have to be addressed. On the broader point, I don't think WP:DUE comes into play here; that to me applies more to viewpoints, balance, and weighing impartiality.
