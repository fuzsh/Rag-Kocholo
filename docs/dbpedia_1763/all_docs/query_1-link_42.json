        "text": "Hall of Fame & Jersey Retirement\n\nThe DePaul University Athletics Hall of Fame was established by the DePaul University Department of Athletics in 1976. Its purpose is to recognize and honor those individuals who have made exceptional contributions to the achievements and distinction of DePaul University in athletics, and who have continued to demonstrate in their lives the values learned by their participation in intercollegiate athletics. Selection criteria was revised in 2022 and the jersey retirement process was added to the Hall of Fame nomination process.\n\nHall of Fame Nomination Process\n\nAll former DePaul student-athletes, coaches, sportscasters, and athletics staff are eligible.**\n\nAnnually, nominations for enshrinement will be solicited from current Hall of Fame Members, Athletics Alumni (D Club Members), and Hall of Fame Committee members.\n\nThe 12-person Hall of Fame Committee will narrow the list to a top 20 list.\n\nBallots with these 20 names will be sent to current, living Hall of Fame members to prioritize their consideration by the Hall of Fame Committee.\n\nAfter reviewing the final ballot, the Hall of Fame Committee will vote on enshrinement. The top six voted nominations will be selected for induction into the Hall of Fame. The enshrinement total must not exceed six new Hall of Fame inductees annually. Team inductions count as only one induction of the six.\n\nJersey Retirement Nomination Process\n\nAny member of the Hall of Fame is eligible for the retired jersey honor.**\n\nThe Hall of Fame Committee will consider accomplishments of worthy jersey retirement honorees annually.\n\nAthletes that are named NCAA recognized National Player of the Year will automatically earn jersey and number retirement. Outside of this instance, specific numbers are not retired.\n\nA Hall of Fame member receiving nine or more votes (from the 12-person committee) will earn the honor of having their jersey retired. Each Hall of Fame Committee member can vote for up to four people annually.\n\nThe total number of jerseys retired must not exceed four annually, collectively across all sports.\n\n** Waiting Period\n\nStudent-athletes must wait a minimum of 10 years after the end of their eligibility to enter the Hall of Fame; a total of 15 years to have their jersey retired. This will be waived only for an athlete that is named NCAA recognized National Player of the Year.\n\nCoaches and DePaul Athletics staff members must wait five years after leaving DePaul Athletics to enter the Hall of Fame and/or have their jersey retired. Once a coach/staff member reaches 65 years of age, they are eligible to earn enshrinement into the Hall of Fame with no waiting period.\n\nSelection Criteria\n\nThe 12-member Hall of Fame Committee are encouraged to judge the merits of prospective Hall of Fame members based on the following criteria:\n\nPrimary\n\nAthletic accomplishments while at DePaul (All-American; All-Conference; Records; etc.)\n\nSecondary\n\nCharacter and other intangibles (Academic; Community Service; etc.)\n\nPost-DePaul accomplishments (Professional Careers; Olympic Participation; Other Endeavors; etc.)"
