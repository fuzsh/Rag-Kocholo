I also would like to thank Mr. J.A. Kinsaul, Principal of Swainsboro Elementary School (during my years teaching there), the parents of my chorus members, and the community for their encouragement and support, for without it, we could have never achieved the level of success that we did. I was blessed to have spent my teaching career in a small town, in a loving and safe community, to rear our four children. Most of all, I thank the Lord for the gift of music and that he allowed me to pass it on to my students.” Photo courtesy of the Forest-Blade\n\nMs. Mae Goddard\n\nMs. Mae Goddard was recognized as the May recipient of the OurTown Hero award at the May 3, 2010 Swainsboro City Council Meeting.
