        "text": "Dutch Smith of the Los Angeles AC made his Olympic debut in 1928 when he placed fourth in the springboard. Although his Olympic title was off the platform, all his AAU titles were in the springboard event, winning the 1m in 1928 and 1930 and the 3m crown in 1930 and 1931. After his Olympic successes he turned pro and appeared in various aquacades in addition to coaching at the New York AC and Yale. He was also appointed coach to the 1936 German Olympic diving team. After serving as a captain in the marines in World War II, Smith worked for a time as a pool manager at luxury hotels in Palm Springs and Santa Barbara."
