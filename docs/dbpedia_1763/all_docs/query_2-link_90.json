        "text": "The College of Central Florida is a dominant force in junior college baseball. The Patriots have earned bragging rights after racking up a program high 51 wins and back-to-back state championships.\n\nThe Patriots (51-6) also stamped their ticket to the NJCAA World Series in Grand Junction, Colorado, with a 3-0 record during the recent state tournament. Despite taking a lead in the third inning, Northwest Florida State College (34-19-1) couldn’t stop Central Florida from rallying for a 7-2 comeback win.\n\n“We have really good bats, and pitching stepped up during the tournament,” head coach Marty Smith said. “We just played really good baseball.”\n\nFuture Patriot breaks home run record High school baseball: 4 storylines that fueled North Marion's first state championship\n\nSmith joins exclusive 900 win club College of Central Florida Baseball Coach Marty Smith wins 900th game\n\nPatriots 2022 World Series run College of Central Florida baseball opens NJCAA Division I World Series with victory\n\nThe top-seeded Patriots open play in the national tournament on Saturday at 2 p.m. EDT, taking on 10th-seed Andrew College (Georgia). The game - and all games from the tournament in - can be seen live on ESPN+.Winning back-to-back state championships in Florida is a rare feat. Chipola College is the last school to repeat titles, winning three in a row from 2017 to 2019.\n\nThe Patriots are one of six Florida junior colleges to repeat at the state level. They’re also part of a more exclusive group of schools that have won back-to-back titles multiple times. Their 1997 and 1998 titles were the first in school history.\n\nSmith believed his team was national tournament-bound early in the season. Players such as Edwin Toribio, who broke the school’s home record with 20 deep balls, showed him that with consistency, the Patriots could be one of the best teams in the country.\n\nUnfortunately for Central Florida’s World Series' hopes, Toribio, who also batted .409 and knocked in 72 runs, will be sidelined. Days before their state tournament run, a pitch hit him in an inter-squad game that put him in a cast for six weeks. With some luck, he could play again when his cast is removed during the fourth week.\n\nMichael Guilliams, one of two catchers on the roster, replaced Toribio at third base. While Toribio may be one of the best hitters in the country, the Patriots believe in a next-man-up mentality, and it’s helped them taste success.\n\n“We have more talent than we did last year, so we thought we had a chance this year,” Smith said. “We’re excited. Can’t wait to get out there.”\n\nSmith was right. Not only are the Patriots going to the NJCAA World Series, they’ll be the top seed. Having a lineup that includes outfielder John Marant (.444, 13 HRs, 59 RBI) and first baseman Juan Correa (.366, 19 HR, 60 RBI) helps. As does having pitchers such as sophomore right-hander Brian Holiday (9-0, 2.75 ERA) and freshman left-hander Isaac Sewell (9-2, 3.57 ERA).\n\nDespite playing with a target on their back all season, the Patriots held the top JUCO college baseball ranking most of the year and had the best record of any team. There was little to no bend or break for the most hunted team in the nation.\n\n“We’ve had the regional pressure and state pressure on us, and they’ve withheld that,” Smith said. “They’re going to be confident going in, and you want them to be going to a certain extent. They know if they play decent baseball, we can beat anybody.”"
