Hello,

My name is Coach Edwin Watson. This will be my seventh school year as a Special Education teacher at Liberty Middle School. One of my biggest accomplishments as a teacher, I was voted the 2024 Liberty Middle School Teacher of the Year by my colleagues and administrators. I also serve as the co-lead for the special education department. I am the head 7th grade boys basketball coach and an assistant coach for the Liberty Lions football team. Since I have been coaching at Liberty, I have had the pleasure of winning 3 county championships in football (2019, 2022, 2023) and 2 county championships in basketball (2019 and 2023). I was born and raised in Montgomery, AL, where I attended Carver High School. During my high school years, I was the captain of the football team and participated in track & field. After high school, I attended Alabama A&M University and was a part of the football team. I've always had a passion for working with kids and helping others. I have over thirteen years of experience coaching youth sports in Madison County.

My family consists of my wife, Soniqua Davison-Watson and 3 kids, Edgerrin, Zion, and Emory.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching sports, traveling, officiating sporting events, and spending time with my family.

I am looking forward to an exciting year. I'm delighted to work with my students. I can not express how amazing it is to wake up every morning with the opportunity to make a difference in my community, one child at a time.

Go Lions!!!
