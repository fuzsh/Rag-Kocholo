        "text": "MODERN HISTORY - WWII TO 1993: In Dec. 1961 France granted Comoros internal self government and in 1974 Anjouan, Grande Comore and Moheli voted for complete independence. Mayotte a neighboring island voted to remain under French protection. France recognized the independence of the three islands but continued to rule Mayotte as a overseas territory, after another referendum in 1976. In 1975 Comoros joined the UN while several Comoran governments held power for short periods after independence was declared. In 1978 voters approved a new constitution that established an Islamic republic headed by a President. In the same year the former head of state Ahmed Abdallah was restored to power after a French mercenary coup overthrew Ali Soilih who was the leader of the coup that ousted Abdallah 3 years earlier. French relations were reestablished, party politics were banned and the government reshuffled in 1980. In Sept. 1984 as the sole candidate, Abdallah was returned to office taking over as the head of state after modifying the constitution and removing the Prime Minister's office. In Nov. 1989 Abdallah was assassinated which resulted in the return of a democracy in Mar. 1990 when Said Mohammed Djohar was elected as President. On Aug. 3, 1991 there was an unsuccessful coup attempt by Hassan Halidi, the son of the Supreme Court's president, after the Supreme Court invoked an article of the constitution and proclaimed that Pres. Djohar was unfit to rule, although Pres. Djohar with the backing of the army and France returned to resume power. Halidi was subsequently placed under house arrest. On Nov. 19, 1991 the Comoran Union of Progress (Udzima) withdrew its support for Pres. Djohar alleging he had witch-hunt following the coup attempt. On Jan. 6, 1992 Pres. Djohar appointed an new coalition government following the signing of a national reconciliation pact that recognized his presidency, although Udzima was not represented in the government. On April 8, 1992 the National Conference agreed on a new constitution and electoral schedule with a referendum on the constitution set for May 24, 1992 while on May 8, 1992 Pres. Djohar announced a new transitional coalition government that strengthened his son-in-law, Mohamed Said Abdallah Mchangama, position within it. On June 7, 1992 the referendum resulted in support for the new constitution and on July 10, 1992 due to a breakdown in relations the transitional government was dissolved. On Sept. 26, 1992 there was a failed coup attempt by junior officers while Pres. Djohar was out of the country. In Nov. 1992 the country's first multiparty elections were the results in two areas were canceled after being marred by violence. On Jan. 1, 1993 as a result of a stalemate in the Federal Assembly Pres. Djohar appointed Ibrahim Adberamane Halidi as prime minister. On April 25, 1993 the death sentence was imposed on 9 people who had taken part in the coup attempt of Sept. 1992, although the sentences were latter commuted to prison terms. In May 1993 following a vote of no confidence Pres. Djohar appointed Said Ali Mohamed as prime minister who formed a new government. In June 1993, another political crisis resulted when Djohar dissolved the Federal Assembly and appointed a new interim prime minister. In Dec. 1993 elections were held amid rule changes, irregularities and violence."
