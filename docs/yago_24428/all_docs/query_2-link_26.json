        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nThe archipelago of the Comoros in the Indian Ocean, composed of the islands of Anjouan, Mayotte, Moheli, and Grande Comore, declared independence from France on 6 July 1975. Residents of Mayotte, however, voted to remain in France, and the French Government now has classified it as a department of France. Since independence, Comoros has endured political instability through realized and attempted coups. In 1997, the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999, military chief Col. AZALI Assoumani seized power of the entire government in a bloodless coup; he initiated the 2000 Fomboni Accords, a power-sharing agreement in which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands, and each island maintains its local government. AZALI won the 2002 federal presidential election as president of the Union of the Comoros from Grande Comore Island, which held the first four-year term. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed SAMBI was elected as president from Anjouan. In 2007, Mohamed BACAR effected Anjouan's de-facto secession from the Union of the Comoros, refusing to step down when Comoros' other islands held legitimate elections in July. The African Union (AU) initially attempted to resolve the political crisis by applying sanctions and a naval blockade to Anjouan, but in March 2008 the AU and Comoran soldiers seized the island. The island's inhabitants generally welcomed the move. In 2009, the Comorian population approved a constitutional referendum extending the term of the president from four years to five years. In May 2011, Ikililou DHOININE won the presidency in peaceful elections widely deemed to be free and fair. In closely contested elections in 2016, former President AZALI Assoumani won a second term, when the rotating presidency returned to Grande Comore. A referendum held in July 2018 - boycotted by the opposition parties - overwhelmingly approved a new constitution removing presidential term limits and the requirement for the presidency to rotate between the three main islands. In August 2018, President AZALI formed a new government and subsequently ran and was elected president in March 2019.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nSouthern Africa, group of islands at the northern mouth of the Mozambique Channel, about two-thirds of the way between northern Madagascar and northern Mozambique\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n12 10 S, 44 15 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 2,235 sq km\n\nland: 2,235 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 179\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly more than 12 times the size of Washington, DC\n\nArea comparison map\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 0 km\n\nCoastline\n\n340 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200 nm\n\nClimate\n\ntropical marine; rainy season (November to May)\n\nTerrain\n\nvolcanic islands, interiors vary from steep mountains to low hills\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Karthala 2,360 m\n\nlowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nfish\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 84.4% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 46.7% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 29.6% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 8.1% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 1.4% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 14.2% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n1.3 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe capital city of Maroni, located on the western side of the island of Grande Comore, is the country's largest city; however, of the three islands that comprise Comoros, it is Anjouan that is the most densely populated as shown in this population distribution map\n\nNatural hazards\n\ncyclones possible during rainy season (December to April); volcanic activity on Grand Comore\n\nvolcanism: Karthala (2,361 m) on Grand Comore Island last erupted in 2007; a 2005 eruption forced thousands of people to be evacuated and produced a large ash cloud\n\nGeography - note\n\nimportant location at northern end of Mozambique Channel; the only Arab League country that lies entirely in the Southern Hemisphere\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n876,437 (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 164\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Comoran(s)\n\nadjective: Comoran\n\nEthnic groups\n\nAntalote, Cafre, Makoa, Oimatsaha, Sakalava\n\nLanguages\n\nArabic (official), French (official), Shikomoro (official; similar to Swahili) (Comorian)\n\nReligions\n\nSunni Muslim 98%, other (including Shia Muslim, Roman Catholic, Jehovah's Witness, Protestant) 2%\n\nnote: Sunni Islam is the state religion\n\nDemographic profile\n\nComorosâ population is a melange of Arabs, Persians, Indonesians, Africans, and Indians, and the much smaller number of Europeans that settled on the islands between the 8th and 19th centuries, when they served as a regional trade hub. The Arab and Persian influence is most evident in the islandsâ overwhelmingly Muslim majority â about 98% of Comorans are Sunni Muslims. The country is densely populated, averaging nearly 350 people per square mile, although this varies widely among the islands, with Anjouan being the most densely populated.\n\nGiven the large share of land dedicated to agriculture and Comorosâ growing population, habitable land is becoming increasingly crowded. The combination of increasing population pressure on limited land and resources, widespread poverty, and poor job prospects motivates thousands of Comorans each year to attempt to illegally migrate using small fishing boats to the neighboring island of Mayotte, which is a French territory. The majority of legal Comoran migration to France came after Comorosâ independence from France in 1975, with the flow peaking in the mid-1980s.\n\nAt least 150,000 to 200,000 people of Comoran citizenship or descent live abroad, mainly in France, where they have gone seeking a better quality of life, job opportunities, higher education (Comoros has no universities), advanced health care, and to finance elaborate traditional wedding ceremonies (aada). Remittances from the diaspora are an economic mainstay, in 2013 representing approximately 25% of Comorosâ GDP and significantly more than the value of its exports of goods and services (only 15% of GDP). Grand Comore, Comorosâ most populous island, is both the primary source of emigrants and the main recipient of remittances. Most remittances are spent on private consumption, but this often goes toward luxury goods and the aada and does not contribute to economic development or poverty reduction. Although the majority of the diaspora is now French-born with more distant ties to Comoros, it is unclear whether they will sustain the current level of remittances.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 36.68% (male 154,853/female 155,602)\n\n15-24 years: 20.75% (male 85,208/female 90,422)\n\n25-54 years: 33.99% (male 136,484/female 151,178)\n\n55-64 years: 4.49% (male 17,237/female 20,781)\n\n65 years and over: 4.08% (male 15,437/female 19,079) (2020 est.)\n\n2022 population pyramid\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 74.1\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 66.6\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 7.5\n\npotential support ratio: 13.3 (2021 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 20.9 years\n\nmale: 20.2 years\n\nfemale: 21.5 years (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 188\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n1.37% (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 70\n\nBirth rate\n\n22.52 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 55\n\nDeath rate\n\n6.55 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 135\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-2.25 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 172\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe capital city of Maroni, located on the western side of the island of Grande Comore, is the country's largest city;

The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, accounts for about 50% of GDP, employs a majority of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. Export income is heavily reliant on the three main crops of vanilla, cloves, and ylang ylang (perfume essence); and the Comoros' export earnings are easily disrupted by disasters such as fires and extreme weather. Despite agricultureâs importance to the economy, the country imports roughly 70% of its food; rice, the main staple, and other dried vegetables account for more than 25% of imports. Remittances from about 300,000 Comorans contribute about 25% of the countryâs GDP. France, Comorosâs colonial power, remains a key trading partner and bilateral donor.\n\nÂ\n\nComoros faces an education system in need of upgrades, limited opportunities for private commercial and industrial enterprises, poor health services, limited exports, and a high population growth rate. Recurring political instability, sometimes initiated from outside the country, and an ongoing electricity crisis have inhibited growth. The government, elected in mid-2016, has moved to improve revenue mobilization, reduce expenditures, and improve electricity access, although the public sector wage bill remains one of the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. In mid-2017, Comoros joined the Southern African Development Community with 15 other regional member states.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$2.73 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$2.6 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$2.55 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 189\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n2.7% (2017 est.)\n\n2.2% (2016 est.)\n\n1% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 106\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$3,100 (2020 est.)\n\n$3,100 (2019 est.)\n\n$3,100 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 196\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$1.186 billion (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n1% (2017 est.)\n\n1.8% (2016 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 63\n\nGDP -
