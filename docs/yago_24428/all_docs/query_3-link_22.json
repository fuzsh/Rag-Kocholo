        "text": "With its pristine natural beauty, cultural tranquility, healthy and vibrant coral reefs and variety of wildlife, Mohéli is the smallest of the four Comorian islands with an area of 290 km2. At 790m, the highest point on the island is Mount Mze Koukoulé.\n\nMohéli, also known as Mwali, is one of the three islands which make up the Union of Comoros. Mohéli is located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa. It is the smallest of the Comoros islands. Its population is about 38,500. Its capital city is Fomboni. Its main ethnic group, as on the other Comoros islands Grande Comore, Anjouan and Mayotte, is the Comorian ethnic group, a synthesis of Bantu, Arab, Malay and Malagasy culture.\n\nIn Nioumachoua, a sanctuary of regional biodiversity, beaches and natural beauty can be found at the Mohéli Marine Park, the first national park in the Comoros. It covers an area of 404 km2 and extends over 40 km long. A true tropical Eden, the park is part of a community based project for the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development. This island chain is not just magnificent ecologically, but also aesthetically and therefore is very important scientifically and recreationally."
