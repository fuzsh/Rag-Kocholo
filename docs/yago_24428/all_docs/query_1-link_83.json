        "text": "Africa in my kitchen\n\nListen to the podcast: Link\n\nReposted from @234Pantry on Instagram\n\nComorian Proverb: A chicken with beautiful plumage does not sit in a corner.\n\nWe love this proverb and we are excited to bring you Mkatra Foutra from Comoros.\n\nThe Comoro Islands (or Comoros) is made up of a cluster of islands off the south-east coast of Africa. It is located to the east of Mozambique and north-west of Madagascar. It is made up of multiple islands, but the three major ones are Grand Comore (Ngazidja), Mohéli (Mwali), and Anjouan (Ndzuani). A fourth island is Mayotte, but it is an overseas French department.\n\nIn the 19th century, Comoros became a French colony. In 1975, three of the islands became independent as the Union of the Comoros. Mayotte voted to remain under French sovereignty. The island-by-island vote was honoured, and Mayotte stayed with France. Currently, Mayotte remains an overseas French Department.\n\nComoros has three official languages – French, Arabic, and Shikomori (or Comorian). Shikomori is actually a collective name of four local languages spoken in the country. Each island has a different Comorian language – Shindzuani is spoken on Ndzuani. Shimaore is spoken on Mayotte (which as we’ve mentioned may be geographically Comorian, but is politically French, because, you know, Africa has drama…). Shimwali is spoken on the island of Mwali and Shingazija is spoken on Ngazidja.\n\nFun facts about Comoros\n\nComoros is the world’s leading producer of ylang ylang and the second largest producer of vanilla. If you’re into essential oils, you might find that tidbit interesting\n\nThe major religion is Islam and alcohol is not commonly found here, but restaurants or bars may stock some for tourists\n\nThere are two types of marriage celebrations – The legal marriage (Mna daho) and the customary marriage (ada or harusi). Mna daho is usually simple and inexpensive. Ada is more elaborate, a lot more expensive, and can be so expensive for some that in some cases, it will take many years to save for. Because of this, in some cases a couple’s Ada might be attended by their adult children\n\nComorian cuisine is a mix of French, Arabic, and more typically found African foods (like manioc and plantain). Indian influences are also present. As an island country, Comorian cuisine has a lot of seafood in and fish is prevalent. (One out of this AIMK duo is very happy about that.) In addition, the island is rich with spices like cloves, vanilla, cardamom, coriander, nutmeg, and cinnamon. It also has a variety of fresh fruit, jackfruit being one of the most popular.\n\nWell-known dishes in Comoro include:\n\nLangouste a la vanilla – lobster boiled in a vanilla sauce that has shallots, butter, white wine, vinegar, and spinach\n\nPilaou – a spicy rice and meat dish\n\nMshakiki – skewered meat flavoured with a myriad of spices, including chilli, turmeric, garlic and papaya\n\nM’tsolola – green plantain with fish cooked in coconut milk\n\nAmbrevades au curry – pigeon pea curry\n\nLadu – spiced and sweetened ground rice balls\n\nNtrovi ya nazi – fried or steamed fish with coconut stew and “cooking bananas” (we suspect this might be plantain; we have never heard of “cooking bananas”)\n\nAnother prevalent is coconut and coconut milk is a very popular drink in the country. This brings us to our feature dish.\n\nMkatra Foutra is a kind of bread made with flour and coconut milk and fried and topped with sesame seeds. We kind of forgot about the sesame seeds until it was too late, but we loved the creamy buttery taste of this bread.\n\nWe found multiple recipes, but went with Travel by Stove. We also enjoyed this video but did not use this recipe because we were not clear on the measurements for ghee and milk.\n\nMkatra Foutra is not a flat bread. Based on our results and pictures online, Mkatra Foutra is thick and bulky (and still fluffy somehow). We don’t know how many you should eat in one sitting, but we were a little stuffed after one.\n\nWord of advice: use a good pan for this, preferably a cast iron one if you have it. If you have a good one, you may not need to fry with so much oil / butter. In fact, multiple videos we found on YouTube showed the cook just sprinkling some water in the pan before pouring in the thick batter. We started with an old pan that had some “burning issues”. The first piece was NOT pretty.\n\nAfter that, we wised up and changed pans. We were rewarded with a stack of buttery, fluffy, coconutty bread.\n\nIngredients for Mkatra foutra\n\nFlour\n\nCoconut milk\n\nYeast\n\nSalt\n\nButter (recipe may vary and use ghee / clarified butter)\n\nSesame seeds (I can’t believe we forgot this)\n\neggs\n\nOther recipes we found\n\nYouTube video of Mkatra Foutra by Ms Tchiba\n\nAll those in flavor\n\nSources\n\n“Mkatra Foutra” – Travel by Stove\n\n“Comoros” – African proverbs in African literature: Comoros\n\n“Top 3 Most Popular Comorian Dishes” – Taste Atlas\n\n“Our journey to Comoros” – International Cuisine\n\n“Comoros – Food and Restaurants” – iExplore\n\n“Meal 38: Comoros” – United Noshes\n\n“Food, eating habits, and cuisine of Comoros” – Study Country\n\n“Comoros” – Wikipedia\n\n“Comoros” – Britannica\n\nWritten by @234Pantry\n\n© 2020 TunukaMedia"
