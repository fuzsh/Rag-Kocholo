        "text": "Comoros\n\nComoros, an independent state comprising three of the Comoro Islands in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Africa. A fourth island of the Comorian archipelago, Mayotte, is claimed by the country of Comoros but administered by France.\n\nAudio File: National anthem of Comoros\n\nHead Of State And Government:\n\nPresident: Azali Assoumani\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 860,6004\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nrepublic2 with one legislative house (Assembly of the Union [333])\n\nOfficial Languages:\n\nComorian (Shikomor); Arabic; French\n\nThe volcanic islands of the Comorian archipelago have been called the “perfumed islands” for their fragrant plant life and are known for their great scenic beauty. The four main islands of the archipelago—“four small effervescent stones, wedged between the nearby large red island [Madagascar] and the Mozambican coast,” in the words of the Comorian writer Sitti Saïd Youssouf—combine African, Arabic, Malagasy, and French influences and were once important in the significant Indian Ocean trade between East Africa and Asian ports such as India and Japan.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 19, 2024, 3:09 AM ET (The Point)\n\nGambia, Comoros 2025 AFCON qualifier appetizer set for September 4\n\nAug. 7, 2024, 4:02 AM ET (Reuters)\n\nComoros president grants sweeping new powers to his son\n\nJuly 25, 2024, 2:05 AM ET (The Standard)\n\nEnda sportswear unveils kits for Comoros, Djibouti and Gabon\n\nAlthough the early history of the islands is uncertain, they are thought to have been explored by Arab and Persian traders in antiquity and, like Madagascar, settled by small numbers of Malayo-Indonesian peoples, gaining a sizable population only when Bantu-speaking peoples from the African mainland settled there. Shīrāzi Persians are thought to have arrived later, establishing Sunni Islam as the dominant religion. The ensuing Shīrāzi sultanates established trade relations with other countries along the Indian Ocean and developed a thriving economy based on the sale of spices and slaves. The opening of the Suez Canal substantially lessened the islands’ importance as an entrepôt, though not their strategic value. European colonial powers agreed that the Comorian archipelago would come under French rule in 1886–87, and it became an overseas territory of France in 1947. Three of the islands gained independence in 1975.\n\nComoros is poor, witnessing an ongoing exodus of educated and skilled workers to France and a steady decline in gross domestic product. The capital, Moroni, located on the island of Grande Comore (N’gazidja), has most of the modern commercial and manufacturing facilities located in the country; in the absence of other possibilities, most islanders must rely on subsistence farming. With miles of beautiful beaches, tourists have always been drawn to Comoros. The islands’ history of political unrest, however, has hampered efforts to promote tourism.\n\nLand\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGuess the Country by Its Neighbors Quiz\n\nThe Comoros are a group of islands at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel of the Indian Ocean, between Madagascar and the southeast African mainland, about 180 miles (290 km) off the eastern coast of Africa. The islands from northwest to southeast include Grande Comore (N’gazidja), Mohéli (Mwali), Anjouan (Ndzuwani), and Mayotte (Mahore).\n\nRelief, drainage, and soils\n\nThe islands emerged from the floor of the Indian Ocean as a result of volcanic activity. Coral reefs provide occasional barriers to the rolling seas of the Indian Ocean, and breakers mark some of the world’s best diving areas. Along the seashore, broad expanses of open sandy beaches are interrupted by isolated groups of coconut palms or mangrove trees. A few coastal areas are distinguished by the harsh dark tangle of recent lava flows, while others are covered by smoothly rounded rocks, eroded reminders of ancient volcanic activity.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

It rises near its southern end in an active volcano, Mount Karthala, which, at 7,746 feet (2,361 metres), is the country’s highest point. Karthala has erupted more than a dozen times in the past two centuries. The capital, Moroni, lies in the shadow of the volcano along the island’s west coast; the town of Mitsamiouli lies on the north coast. North of Mount Karthala is a wide plateau averaging 2,000 feet (600 metres) in elevation. The surface is generally rocky and the soils shallow. There are no perennial streams, and the coast, without large inlets, is ill suited for shipping.\n\nMohéli is the smallest island of the group. Composed largely of a plateau that averages about 1,000 feet (300 metres) in elevation, the island ends in the west in a ridge reaching more than 2,600 feet (790 metres) above sea level. The valleys are generally fertile, and the hillsides are covered with thick forests. A strong sea swell hampers shipping. Mohéli’s chief towns are Fomboni on the northern coast and Nioumachoua in the southwest.\n\nAnjouan is a triangular island rising centrally in a volcanic massif (Mount Ntingui) that reaches an elevation of about 5,200 feet (1,580 metres). Although the soil cover is good, much erosion has occurred, and many areas are no longer arable. There are no good natural harbours. Moutsamoudou, on the northwest coast, is the chief town; its port facilities were modernized in the mid-1980s.\n\nSoutheast of Anjouan lies Mayotte, the oldest of the four islands. It is claimed by Comoros (a claim recognized by the United Nations General Assembly), but its status is unsettled, and it continues to be administered by France.\n\nClimate\n\nThe tropical climate has two clearly marked seasons: a cooler, dry period between May and October and a warmer, humid season between November and April. In November the summer monsoon (kashkazi) brings the highest afternoon temperatures—about 91 °F (33 °C). The highest monthly rainfall occurs in January with about 11–15 inches (275–375 mm), and the rainy season is the season of greatest tropical cyclone frequency. Dry season daily maximum temperatures fall to their lowest, about 84 °F (29 °C), in July. The average annual rainfall varies between 43 and 114 inches (1,100 and 2,900 mm), being highest on the windward northeast sides of the islands.\n\nRain sinks so deeply into the hardened lava and porous rocks of Grande Comore that wells are difficult to drill. Traditionally, most of Grande Comore’s water supply has come from reservoirs filled in the rainy season and from freshwater springs along the coasts (foumbous).\n\nPlant and animal life\n\nLess than one-sixth of the land remains covered with forest, and rapid deforestation caused mainly by domestic firewood consumption threatens to reduce the islands’ forested land still more. A coastal zone of mangroves is followed inland by one of coconut palms, mangoes, and bananas up to about 1,300 feet (400 metres), above which a forest zone rises to about 5,900 feet (1,800 metres). Mahogany trees and orchids are primarily limited to the rugged slopes of the mountains. On the highest peaks only broom, heather, and lichens grow. Additional aromatic plants such as frangipani (Plumeria), jasmine, and lemongrass lend a delightful fragrance to the islands.\n\nAnimal life, which is similar to that of Madagascar, includes land birds (guinea fowl and egrets) and species of both lemurs and fruit bats that are peculiar to the islands. Turtles abound along the coasts and are exported. The Comorian waters are one of the habitats of the coelacanth, a rare fish once thought to be extinct, the fossil remains of which date to about 400 million years ago. Besides these unique species, the islands are also home to civets, small lizards, and giant land crabs. The expanding human population has put a number of wildlife species under threat of extinction."
