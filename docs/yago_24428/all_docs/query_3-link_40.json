        "text": "When in 1500 the Portuguese captain Vasco de Gama, in search of the route to India, crossing the boundaries of the African continent discovered the Indian Ocean, he did not land in an uninhabited world. Located in the Indian Ocean, The Comoro Islands or Comoros form an archipelago of volcanic islands situated off the south-east coast of Africa, to the east of Mozambique and north-west of Madagascar.\n\nThe population of the Comoros is estimated at 875,000 inhabitants divided as follows: Grande Comoros with 50,000 inhabitants, Anjouan with 300,000 inhabitants, Moheli with 40,000 inhabitants and finally Mayotte with only 185,000 inhabitants.\n\nTheir geographical position has made Comoros the crossroad between the Arab world and black Africa and the rest of the Indian Ocean. The Comoros are original Bantu people of East Africa. Immigration, over the centuries, has brought many other nationalities in the country such as the Malagasy, the Arabs, and melanin-Chiraziens to Indonesian islands. This explains the diversity of the culture and the different languages.\n\nContrary to the other islands of the archipelago, Mayotte, the fourth island is not a member of the Union of Comoros, because it is still part of the French Republic as a territorial collectivity of overseas territories. Comoros became a member of the Francophonie in 1977 and member of the League of Arab States in 1993.\n\nThe settlement of the archipelago of the Comoros is formed from the fusion of African populations, Arab and Malagasy. The Comorian belongs to the subfamily of the Eastern Bantu, which also includes Swahili. Some 33 percent of its vocabulary is derived from Arabic. French is the official language and that is used for external relations, but classical Arabic is the “religious language”. Malagasy and Swahili are spoken by a small minority of the population.\n\nIn Grande Comoros, the Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport is located 20 km from the capital Moroni. Taxi drivers usually charge a 20 € fee for the trip. If you’re lucky, you’ll find a bush taxi that will accept to race for a much cheaper fare. The two high-end hotels staff, on the Island, comes directly get their clients from the airport. Know that you can spend a week in the upscale hotel (the Galawa Beach) on the north coast of Grande Comore, without even worrying about anything else.\n\nIn recent years, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs advised against traveling to the breakaway island of Anjouan, plagued by sporadic and subject conditions, since March 2000, with some restrictions on air services and the supply of hydrocarbons.\n\nSince March 2004, following the seismic activity of the volcano Khartala (on Grande Comore), it is forbidden to drive on the slopes of the volcano.\n\nThe local currency is the Comorian franc (KMF). Cash in Euros are also widely accepted when it comes to large sums like hotel bills. However, travelers must use local currency for everyday living expenses and the purchases of gifts on the market. Banks are located only in Moroni (Grande Comore) and Mutsamudu (Anjouan) and this must be taken into account when traveling"
