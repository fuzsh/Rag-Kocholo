The balance can be settled by bank transfer, latest 2 weeks before your arrival, and otherwise you can pay this locally but only in cash or with a VISA card.\n\nWhen we are booking and purchasing your tickets for your local flights, the total amount for the tickets must be paid in advance. Most of our guests prefer to pay the total expected cost in advance, including excursions and extras, in order not to have to travel with cash.\n\nAt the lodge we accept cash payments either in Euros or Comorian Francs (KMF). There is no reliable ATM in MohÃ©li. It is possible to pay the balance at the lodge with your VISA card (no other card types work) + 3.5% processing fee. You can change euros in the hotel or in small shops in Moheli for EUR1=KMF490. The rate of the Comorian Franc is fixed to the euro.\n\nAdvance payment for accommodation and activities at Laka Lodge will be reimbursed by us, minus bank transfer charges, in cases of âforce majeureâ (cancellation of flight, serious illness, etc.). Unfortunately, domestic flight tickets are theoretically not reimbursable nor modifiable. We will also try our best to help you with the local airlines.\n\nThe Comoros islands experience two seasons that do not differ too much from each other, a warmer and rainier season from November to May and a fresher and drier one from June to October.\n\nAll year-round temperatures vary between 25Â°C and 32Â°C. During the rainy season rains may appear but generally do not last more than an hour. February is generally rainier.\n\nBy clicking on the image below, you can check the current weather in Nioumachoua.\n\nThe currency in the Comoros is the Comorian Franc (KMF) which is linked to the euro at a fixed rate of EUR1=KMF491.968. You can easily change cash euros (up to EUR100 bills) in shops at a rate of EUR1=KMF490. In Moheli, it is not possible to use credit cards, get money at an ATM or pay by bank check. At the lodge we accept payments with a valid VISA card (+3.5% processing fee) or cash euro. Payments in US Dollars are possible too however the exchange rate can differ from daily bank rates. We cannot accept payments in other currencies.\n\nSummer clothes are recommended all year round. Outside of the hotel area it is advised to wear adapted clothing in accordance to local customs. For men and well as women it would be expected to wear pants or a longer skirt and cover shoulders. Short sleeves are accepted.\n\nMohÃ©li is home to a colourful, vibrant, and conservative traditional culture. In order to show respect to our local hosts, and to earn their respect in return, when travelling in the Comoros please avoid public displays of affection and dress in conservative manner.\n\nLaka Lodge is home to one of the only private beaches in the Comoros, therefore on our private beach and in the boat for marine excursions, wearing bikinis and western-style swimwear is possible. When walking in the village or on the public beach, please wear at least a shirt with sleeves and trousers, a skirt, or a wrap. Local women usually wear a shawl or scarf to cover their head or wrap around their shoulders.\n\nDemonstrating respect for their traditions is a fun component of your ecotourism experience and will earn you a deeper level of trust and connection during your interactions with the wonderful Comorian people."
