        "text": "Post by Beryllium Guy on\n\nIn the thread on stamps of the Comoros, Xavier (hrdoktorx) mentioned that the four main islands of the Comoros each had issued stamps at various times. Mohéli is the smallest of the four main islands, and only briefly had its own stamps, from 1906-1912. The stamps are of the classic Navigation & Commerce design. These shown below are Scott #2-3.\n\nThe good news for Xavier is that I have a duplicate of #2, which I will now save for him. These are the only two stamps I have from the island at the moment, but Xavier's revival of the Comoros thread has inspired me to shop for more and expand my holdings here, so hopefully I will be able to add to this thread in the future.\n\nPost by greaden on\n\nMost postmarked stamps of Moheli were actually used in Madagascar after the colonies in the region were merged, and the stamps of each were valid throughout Madagascar and the Comoros.\n\nHere are stamps actually postmarked on the island, on a cover sent to the neighboring island of Anjouan. The cover was returned, as the recipient was deceased.\n\nAs far as I can figure out, the inscription is in Ajami, a variant of Arabic script adapted to African languages. Here, it must be one of the Swahili dialects spoken in the Comoro islands."
