These are the Grande Comore (Njazidja), Mohéli (Mwali), Anjouan (Nzwani), and Mayotte (Mahoré).\n\nThe Grande Comore is the largest among the four. The national capital of Grande Comore has been Moroni since 1962.\n\nMohéli is the smallest of the four islands in the Comoros. The capital of Mohéli is Fomboni.\n\nAnjouan is a triangular-shaped island. Its capital is Mutsamudu which is also considered as its main port.\n\nMayotte is considered as the oldest of the four islands of the Comoros. Mayotte’s capital is Dzaoudzi.\n\nGEOGRAPHY\n\nThe climate in the Comoros is generally marine tropical and mild.\n\nThere are two (2) seasons in the Comoros: hot and humid from the northeastern monsoon, and a cooler and drier season for the rest of the year.\n\nListed below are the extreme points of the Comoros:\n\nThe northernmost point is at an unnamed headland found in the northwestern part of Bangoua Kouni in Grande Comore.\n\nThe easternmost point is at an unnamed peninsula at the east of Domoni in Anjouan.\n\nThe southernmost point is at an unnamed headland on Ile Canzouni in Mohéli.\n\nThe westernmost point is at an unnamed headland located on the western area of Iconi in Grande Comore.\n\nBIODIVERSITY\n\nThe waters of the Comoros are the habitat of a rare fish with limb-like fins and a cartilaginous skeleton called coelacanth.\n\nThere are also several mammals that are unique to the islands themselves.\n\nLivingstone’s fruit bat can be found in Anjouan.\n\nThe jet-black Livingstone fruit bat is considered as the world’s largest bat.\n\nFound in Mayotte is the hybrid of the common brown lemur which is originally found in Madagascar.\n\nThe mongoose lemur, which was also introduced from Madagascar by humans, can also be found on the islands of Mohéli and Anjouan.\n\n22 species of bird are unique to the archipelago and 17 of these are restricted to the Comoros, which include Karthala scops-owl, Anjouan scops-owl, and Humblot’s flycatcher.\n\nCULTURE\n\nThe islands in the Comoros share mostly African-Arab origins.\n\nThe most common languages used in the Comoros are the Comorian languages which are collectively known as Shikomori.\n\nShikomori is related to Swahili, and there are four (4) variants: Shingazidja, Shimwali, Shindzuani, and Shimaore.\n\nArabic is widely used as a second language and also the language of Quranic teaching.\n\nFrench is considered as the administrative language and also the language used for most non-Quranic forms of education.\n\nSunni Islam is the dominant religion in the Comoros.\n\nECONOMY\n\nAgriculture, which includes fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the economy in the Comoros.\n\nSome of the major export crops or products of the Comoros include vanilla, cloves, perfume essences, and copra.\n\nThe Comoros is considered as the world’s second-largest producer of vanilla.\n\nOther principal food crops include coconuts, bananas, and cassava.\n\nThe Comoros is also considered as the world’s leading producer of essence of ylang-ylang (the flower of the Cananga odorata which is also known as cananga tree). The essence is used in perfumes.\n\nIn 1988, the government of Comoros signed a three-year agreement by which forty French and Spanish vessels would be permitted to fish in Comoran waters, primarily for tuna. In return, the Comoros would receive payment, and would receive a certain amount which would be invested in fisheries research.\n\nNumerous fruit trees and tropical hardwoods can be found in the islands of Comoros.
