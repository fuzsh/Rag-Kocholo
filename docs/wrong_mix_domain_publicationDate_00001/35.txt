Skylark

by E. E. "Doc" Smith

Series Description

Skylark is a four book Science Fiction Space Opera which describes the conflicts between protagonists Seaton and Crane, and antagonist DuQuesne. It tells the story of the progressively increasing scales of conflict (equalled by progressively-increased technology) between themselves, individually and collectively, and a series of non-humans bent on universal conquest. When forced to co-operate against an alien species, which had conquered one galaxy and was expanding into others, the characters conclude that the universe is large enough to allow peace.
