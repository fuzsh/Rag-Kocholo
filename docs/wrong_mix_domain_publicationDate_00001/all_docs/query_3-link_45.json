        "text": "CMU-SFFS Distributed Virtual Library\n\nThe sprite branch\n\nThis web page represents a branch of the Distributed Virtual Library of the CMU Science Fiction & Fantasy Society, a new (unrecognized) organization for Carnegie-Mellon-affiliated-people who like to read works of science fiction and/or fantasy.\n\nFinally went through the piles I collected this summer. I also made up a dorky gif; not that you care when I acquired something, but actually I do since the \"new\" ones are mostly in one or more bureau drawers (ran out of shelves) so it really means \"sprite, maybe you should get around to dealing with those even though the piles are not out where you trip over them anymore.\"\n\nThe comments were generally added around 3 am, from memory, so I won't vouch for either accuracy or usefulness. I'll probably disown half of them if I ever read right through the page again.\n\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z misc\n\nAdams, Douglas\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - a fun book, which we obsessed over a bit in junior high. You've probably read it. SF comedy. Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency - SF mystery with funny bits, which it would maybe spoil to indicate the Secret Origin of. The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul - Another Dirk Gently mystery, somewhat more obscure than the first (at least, it gives me the feeling of a jigsaw puzzle that the cat ate a couple of pieces from.) Last Chance to See - entertaining nonfiction.\n\nAdams, Richard\n\nWatership Down - you've probably read it, or at least you should. An epic saga starring hrair rabbits. Tales From Watership Down - for the completeist. The Plague Dogs - wah.\n\nAnderson, Poul\n\nThree Hearts and Three Lions - fantasy, but at the moment I can't recall more than that.\n\n(and Anderson, Karen) The King of Ys - fantasy, thick, trying to intimidate the other books in the \"unread\" pile.\n\nApuleius\n\nThe Golden Ass - Fantasy. I recommend it, but of course your mileage may vary.\n\nAsimov, Isaac\n\nAnnotated Gilbert & Sullivan - certainly one of the coolest presents I've ever gotten. Foundation - oh, you've all read it, right? ha ha.\n\nAusten, Jane\n\nMansfield Park - It's, you know, Jane Austen. I don't have the rest because I borrowed them from my sister and people. Not that my sister isn't people. You know. Northanger Abbey - fine, I bought another one.\n\nBall, Margaret\n\nMathemagics - Fantasy. Variation on \"normal mom enters fantasy realm\" (see Minerva Wakes and/or The Interior Life.) Heh.\n\nBanks, Iain M.\n\nExcession - Really-high-tech space opera. Consider Phlebas - Same universe. For me this was one of those books that I suddenly realized I had already read.\n\nBear, Greg\n\n/ - SF. I didn't think much of it.\n\nBellairs, John\n\nThe House With a Clock in its Walls - Juvie spooky fantasy. *nostalgia fit* The Face in the Frost - Non-juvie fantasy. Cool.\n\nBenford, Gregory\n\nMatter's End - SF, darned if I can remember what it's about.\n\nbes shahar, eluki\n\nDarktraders - Hellflower 2 - I've probably got the author's alphabetization wrong (figured there was a 50/50 chance.) This is apparently the middle book in a trilogy but it made some kind of sense anyway (a lot more than reading The Whim of the Dragon without The Hidden Land anyway.) SF.\n\nBester, Alfred\n\nThe Stars My Destination - SF. Everyone should read it, along with The Demolished Man which I don't seem to have a copy of here.\n\nBlake, Katherine\n\nThe Interior Life - Fantasy. This is a cool book. I'm torn between attempting to loan it promiscuously and attempting to maintain its mind-bogglingly pristine condition (rec.arts.sf.written++)\n\nBlish, James\n\nA Case of Conscience - SF. Religion and alien contact (but otherwise unlike The Sparrow, by what's her name, which has the dubious honor of being A Book I Did Not Keep.) The Devil's Day - Fantasy duology. Religion and, hm, the end of the world. Hm, I think the ending is the opposite of another literary work somewhere on this page, but maybe I am on crack.\n\n(Hey. Only two months later and I have no idea what I'm talking about. Good luck.) Cities in Flight - SF. Like spindizzies and stuff.\n\nBoyett, Steven R.\n\nThe Architect of Sleep - SF. Raccoons. No sequels.\n\nBradbury, Ray\n\nThe Golden Apples of the Sun - Collection. It's, like, Bradbury, you know. R is for Rocket - Collection. Something Wicked This Way Comes - you've read this, right?\n\nBradley, Marion Zimmer\n\nThe House Between the Worlds - er, I forget. Stormqueen - Fantasy (Darkover. I'm not attempting to list this series in \"order\".) Thendara House - Fantasy (Darkover.) Hawkmistress! - Fantasy (Darkover.) Sharra's Exile - Fantasy (Darkover.) Star of Danger - Fantasy (Darkover.) The Spell Sword - Fantasy (Darkover.) The Heritage of Hastur - Fantasy (Darkover.) The Shattered Chain - Fantasy (Darkover.) The Mists of Avalon - Arthurian neopaganish fantasy, which some people find inherently irritating,\n\nBrin, David\n\nSundiver - SF / mystery, in a space opera universe that has More Aliens Than You Can Shake A Stick At. #1 in the Uplift series, some consider it the weakest of the first three (jury still out on the rest.) Startide Rising - SF, #2 in the Uplift series. All that and dolphins too! This book can be read independently of the others. The Uplift War - SF, #3 in the Uplift series. This time, chimps! This book can be read independently of the others. Brightness Reef - SF. First in the basically-a-book-in-three-parts trilogy whose-name-I-forget that I would designate #4 in the Uplift series. Aliens that actually get along with each other. This trilogy will make more sense if you read Startide Rising first (the other two are not strictly necessary.) The Practice Effect - er, I forget. Glory Season - SF. A quite interesting world, and there is even sort of a plot to go with it.\n\nBrock, Betty\n\nNo Flying in the House - Fantasy. Juvie. Exactly as I remembered it from (second?, third?) grade, except of course much shorter.\n\nBrowm, Mary\n\nPigs Don't Fly - Fantasy. Fluffy.\n\nBrunner, John\n\nThe Traveler in Black - insert entry here. Stand On Zanzibar - Extrapolative SF. Perhaps a bit depressing. The Sheep Look Up - Extrapolative SF. A few people consider it to have a happy ending.\n\nBrust, Steven\n\nTaltos - Fantasy. Swashbuckling (at least, I think we all agreed at Confluence that it was swashbuckling, despite the utter lack to date of any rope-swinging.) Vlad Taltos the Assassin. Actually, it's a Good series, and even has Character Development for people who like That Sort Of Thing. Teckla - Fantasy. Vlad Taltos. I probably have these listed in the wrong order; they should be read \"in order of publication\". Jhereg - Fantasy. Vlad Taltos. Yendi - Fantasy. Vlad Taltos. Phoenix - Fantasy. Vlad Taltos. Athyra - Fantasy. Vlad Taltos. Orca - Fantasy. Vlad Taltos. Agyar - Fantasy. Interesting. Not Vlad Taltos. The Gypsy - Fantasy. (coauthored with.. someone.. where'd I put it? Megan Lindholm.) When I found out what process was used to create the book, I was enlightened. I also have the album. The Phoenix Guards - Fantasy / Dumas homage, which some people are allergic to. Set lo these many years prior to Vlad Taltos's doings, though I suppose you don't need to know that. Caused me to read the originals. Five Hundred Years After - Fantasy / Dumas homage. Set, um, 500 years after the previous one. Brokedown Palace - Fantasy. Interesting. Set mostly lo a few years prior to Vlad Taltos's doings, but you don't actually need to know that. The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars - Fantasy, although I could not say why. Collect the whole set.\n\nBrust and Bull\n\nFreedom and Necessity - This is either fantasy, or SF where the \"S\" is, um, Hegelian something or other. (Fantasy, if you ask me, but not all of the characters would agree to that.) There is a one-dollar word for \"composed of letters and diary entries\" which you can imagine that I'm using here. This book would probably be fabulously cool to me if I had any interest in or knowledge of dialectics (that's the word. Actually andrej explained the latter to me in words of one sentence, but I was not what you might call enlightened with respect to the book. Now if it were category theory.) Failing that, it's semi-cool.\n\nBujold, Lois McMaster\n\nShards of Honor - SF / romance, although I hesitate to use the \"R\" word and maybe put people off it. Early in the Vorkosigan universe. (I think someone has argued that, if you had a sufficiently warped mind, you could map every book in this series to a romance formula. I got lost somewhere around the \"Gregor as traditional heroine\" one.) Falling Free - SF, earlier in the same universe but can be read alone. Some consider it the weakest. Ethan of Athos - SF. Sorta cute. (Newt nuggets! Oh, suddenly I'm having a \"what if Bujold wrote Downbelow Station\" moment.) In the same universe but could probably be read alone. The Warrior's Apprentice - SF. Vorkosigan. Some people love this series, and some people hate it. Some people love one half of it and hate the other half. I will not attempt to predict. The Vor Game - SF. Vorkosigan. Mirror Dance - SF. Vorkosigan. Cetaganda - SF. Vorkosigan. Memory - SF. Vorkosigan. Komarr - SF. Vorkosigan.\n\nBull, Emma\n\nFalcon - SF. It's not really two books stapled together, although it might seem that way. Finder - Fantasy. Actual worth-reading \"elves on motorcycles\" no kidding. Bone Dance - SF, was it? Interesting protagonist at any rate.\n\nCabell, James Branch\n\nThe High Place - Fantasy.\n\nCallin, Grant\n\nA Lion on Tharthee - SF but not particularly memorable at the moment.\n\nCeram, C.W.\n\nGods, Graves, and Scholars - Entertaining (to me) nonfiction (I suppose.)\n\nChambers, Robert W.\n\nThe King in Yellow - Fantasy, sorta, stories. Don't blame me if you go mad or whatever.\n\nChant, Joy\n\nRed Moon and Black Mountain - Juvie? fantasy.\n\nCherryh, C.J.\n\nWave Without a Shore - SF. Interesting to (re)read in the context of Cyteen, or vice versa. Fortress in the Eye of Time - Fantasy. There are three books to follow it (Fortress of Eagles and, um, two others.) The end made more sense after I read the introduction to the next one. Heh. Fortress of Eagles - Fantasy. The next one. Tripoint - SF in the merchanter/union/alliance universe. No aliens. Finity's End - SF, same universe. No aliens. Downbelow Station - SF, same universe. Some aliens. Forty Thousand in Gehenna - SF, same universe. Weirder aliens. Sometimes I think the cat ate a few pieces of the jigsaw puzzle here too. Cyteen - SF, still in the same universe, Union perspective. (Also found in separate books as a trilogy.) I like this book. I wonder if I saved the filk about sandwiches somewhere. Chanur's Venture - Sorry, the first book is The Pride of Chanur, but I mailed it to my sister a while ago and haven't bought another yet. (I think I also mailed her A College of Magics.) It is SF, tangentially in the same universe, but \"far far away\" so you don't particularly need to know that. A bunch of aliens (any way you slice it.) Chanur's Venture is the first book in a one-book-in-three-parts trilogy that follows The Pride of Chanur. The Kif Strike Back - Second book in that trilogy. Somewhere, cats are laughing at this title. Chanur's Homecoming - Third book in that trilogy. Chanur's Legacy - A book that follows that trilogy. (It has a lighter tone than the rest. The Preciousness. Hee hee.) The Faded Sun: Kesrith - SF. First book in a cool trilogy that might be in Still The Same Universe, Much Later but there's no particular reason to care. The Faded Sun: Shon'jir - Second book in the cool trilogy. The Faded Sun: Kutath - Third book in the cool trilogy. The Faded Sun: Kutath - Random spare copy that was going cheap. The Book of Morgaine - Hardcover collection of the (first) three Morgaine novels. SF, actually (and it might be in Still The Same Universe, Much Earlier, Or Is It Much Later?) Exile's Gate - A fourth Morgaine. Foreigner - SF. \"Likeable\" Yet Alien aliens. Set on a world sufficiently far from anything above that this series is in its own universe despite what anyone may argue to the contrary. First in a trilogy. Invader - Second in said trilogy. Inheritor - Third in said trilogy. The Dreamstone - Fantasy. Celtic. The Tree of Swords and Jewels - Fantasy. Celtic. Sequel. Somewhere on a Technical Difficulties tape I have the very cool filksong that caused me to read this. Rider at the Gate - SF/Fantasy. If you have developed an allergy to McCaffrey and Lackey, I will also issue you an Evil Chortle to be used, while rubbing one's hands together gleefully, at appropriate points in this reading experience. Cloud's Rider - Sequel. Visible Light - Collection. Festival Moon: Merovingen Nights #1 - Fantasy. Legions of Hell - Fantasy set in some kind of afterlife which enables the use of various dead people. Haven't decided whether to admit to owning it. Cuckoo's Egg - SF. Aliens, or an alien, depending on your perspective. And assassins, I guess.\n\nClement, Hal\n\nMission of Gravity - SF. have I read this?\n\nCook, Glen\n\nCold Copper Tears - Hardboiled fantasy? Bleak Seasons: the Return of the Black Company - I guess you have to read these \"in order\" to like/understand them, although it's not clear that I would even then. The Tower of Fear - Fantasy. I wasn't particularly thrilled by it.\n\nCrichton, Michael\n\nThe Andromeda Strain - SF, or \"mainstream SF\" anyway. It was fun to read when I didn't know any better (whether I do now is also arguable.)\n\nCross, Amanda\n\nIn the Last Analysis - Mystery. Protagonist is an English prof who leads a normal prof life sprinkled with occasional murders and/or feminism. Might like if you run out of Sayers. The James Joyce Murder - Mystery. Same. Poetic Justice - Mystery. Same. The Theban Mysteries - Mystery. Same. The Question of Max - Mystery. Same. Death in a Tenured Position - Mystery. Same. Sweet Death, Kind Death - Mystery. Same. No Word from Winifred - Mystery. Same. A Trap for Fools - Mystery. Same. The Players Come Again - Mystery. Same.\n\nDann, Jack (ed.)\n\nWandering Stars - collection, SF, Judaism (?)\n\n(and Dozois, Gardner) Magicats! - collection, fantasy, cats (um, whee.)\n\nDean, Pamela\n\nThe Secret Country - Juvie fantasy, tragically out of print. First in a trilogy. I like it a great deal. The Secret Country - auxiliary back-up copy. The Hidden Land - Second in trilogy. The Whim of the Dragon - Third in trilogy. The Dubious Hills - Juvie fantasy. Set in another part of the Secret Country / Hidden Land universe. Very interestingly weird (apply intensifier to whichever.) Tam Lin - Fantasy. FANTASY. Apparently contains too much college nostalgia for some people. Based on Tam Lin, naturally. (While I'm on the topic, I also liked The Perilous Gard, which I don't seem to have a copy of here; \"juvie fantasy\".) Caused me to read The Lady's Not For Burning. Juniper, Gentian, and Rosemary [on loan] - Fantasy. FANTASY. This is also based on a song, but not one I was familiar with. Caused me to buy a telescope.\n\nDe_Camp and Pratt\n\nThe Compleat Enchanter - Somewhere I had a copy of The Complete Compleat Enchanter. Fantasy. Cute.\n\nDe_Lint, Charles\n\nJack of Kinrowan - A duology (Jack the Giant Killer and Drink Down the Moon? Something like that.) Fantasy. I liked it.\n\nDickson, Gordon\n\nAncient, My Enemy - Story collection. Three To Dorsai - SF. The first three Dorsai novels. You probably have to be in the right mood. The Dorsai Companion - Dorsai story collection. Soldier, Ask Not - SF. Dorsai. (Hm. I think this was the first one I read, and again due to a filksong.) The Final Encyclopedia - Around this time I started to wonder how long the series was. The Chantry Guild - But they're sort of like Pringles, you know? Young Bleys - You eat one. Then you eat another. Other - And then you feel like you have to find out what happens at the end of the can.\n\nDonaldson, Stephen\n\nDaughter of Regals & Other Tales - Fantasy story collection. Ok, for this one I have The strangest reason to have read it. At some point I possessed, though I no longer recall why, a pack of Michael Whelan cover-art trading cards, and this was the only one that I both didn't recognize and was intrigued by the description of (the main character of the title story is \"plain\".) The Mirror of Her Dreams - Fantasy, first in a duology (Mordant's Need.) Ok, maybe an interesting world, but PLEASE can I slap some sense into the main character (and something else into two or three other characters)? A Man Rides Through - Fantasy, second in the duology. The revelation of why some people acted like such idiots in the first book would have redeemed the latter, had I considered that possible.\n\nDowner, Ann\n\nThe Spellkey Trilogy - Fantasy. I like it.\n\nDrake, David\n\nLord of the Isles - Fantasy. Remaindered hardcover in pile of unread same.\n\nDurgin, Doranna\n\nDun Lady's Jess - Fantasy. Horses, sort of.\n\nDuane, Diane\n\nSupport Your Local Wizard - Juvie fantasy. Hardcover collection of the first three Wizard novels. Well worth reading. There's a fourth set in Ireland that didn't impress me so much. Deep Wizardry - spare copy. The Book of Night With Moon - Fantasy. Same Wizard universe, but from a cat's viewpoint. (Misleading title; doesn't actually have anything to do with the Book.) To Visit the Queen - Fantasy. Another cat wizard book. The Door Into Fire - Fantasy. First book in the Door Into Foo series, which is SUPPOSED to have four books. Anyway, cool. The Door Into Shadow - Fantasy. Same series. Door Into Sunset - (no The?) Fantasy. Same series. Spider-Man: The Venom Factor - Heh.\n\nDumas\n\nThe Three Musketeers Twenty Years After The Vicomte De Bragelonne Louise De Lavalliere The Man In The Iron Mask The Count Of Monte Cristo\n\nDunnett, Dorothy\n\nThe Game of Kings - Historical fiction. I ran out of O'Brian. This is also a good series, but, um, less frolicsome. I read the first one and said \"eh.\" Queens' Play - I read the second one and said \"hm.\" The Disorderly Knights - I read the third one, Pawn in Frankincense - immediately read the other three, The Ringed Castle - you have been warned. Checkmate - I suppose that if you are feeling down about graduate school, these books might cheer you up. But probably not unless The Sheep Look Up also did. Niccolo Rising - start of another but different historical series (got this to read on a plane.)\n\nEddison, E.R.\n\nZimiamvia: a Trilogy - Fantasy, more or less. I made it halfway through about, um, four years ago. The Worm Ouroboros - Fantasy. Pretty cool, if you ask me, but then I like that sort of thing.\n\nEffinger, George Alec\n\nMaureen Birnbaum, Barbarian Swordsperson - (8 stories). Fantasy. Amusing.\n\nEgan, Greg\n\nPermutation City - SF. I think I hit a Singularity partway through.\n\nElgin, Suzette Haden\n\nNative Tongue - SF. Um. Aliens. Women. Languages. Stuff. The Judas Rose: Native Tongue II - SF. Earthsong: Native Tongue III - Fantasy. Er, I mean SF. Like pass the crack pipe or something. Communipath Worlds - Collection. Yonder Comes the Other End of Time - on the unread pile, looking intimidated by the other books\n\nEllison, Harlan\n\nMedea - SF. One interesting world with stories from several variable authors set in it.\n\nFeynman, Richard\n\nSurely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman - Entertaining nonfiction. What Do You Care What Other People Think? - Entertaining nonfiction.\n\nFord, John M.\n\nWeb of Angels - SF. Cool. Growing Up Weightless - Juvie(?) SF. Cool. The Dragon Waiting - Fantasy. Alternate history. I think I need to know more history to appreciate it.\n\nForester, C.S.\n\nThe African Queen - Fiction. I got my brother to read some O'Brian and he got me to read some Forester. We agreed that the former is much more like Austen than it is like the latter. Ship of the Line - Sort of thing Honor Harrington reads, yes?\n\nGaiman, Neil\n\nDon't Panic - Entertaining nonfiction. Heh.\n\nGarner, Alan\n\nThe Weirdstone of Brisingamen - Fantasy. Juvie. Haven't read it yet. All I remember is that there is a Claustrophobia Moment in there somewhere.\n\nGarrett, Randall\n\nLord Darcy - Collection of fantasy mysteries. Cool. Too Many Magicians - (Redundant.)\n\nGilbreth and Carey\n\nBelles on Their Toes - sequel to Cheaper By The Dozen\n\nGoldman, William\n\nThe Silent Gondoliers: a fable by S. Morgenstern - Fantasy. Nothing to write home about if you ask me.\n\nGreeley, Andrew M.\n\nThe Final Planet - SF, I presume. On the unread cheap hardcovers heap.\n\nGould, Steven\n\nJumper - SF. Teleportation. REVENGE. I think that sums it up.\n\nGibson, William\n\nNeuromancer - Cyberpunk. I read this a while ago when we all thought it was very cool (like, high school.) Count Zero - Ditto.\n\nGraves, Robert\n\nI, Claudius - Historical fiction. Highly recommended but I suppose maybe not everyone would like it (obviously there'd be something wrong with them, though.) Claudius the God - Historical fiction. I still like mushrooms, but then hobbits were a much earlier influence. Lawrence of Arabia - Biography.\n\nHaldeman, Joe\n\nDealing in Futures - SF collection which I own for the \"tangled web\" story. (Oh, the embarrassment.)\n\nHarrison, Harry\n\nThe Adventures of the Stainless Steel Rat - SF. At some point we also thought this book was very cool (probably still entertaining, but I suppose I would stop much earlier in the series now.)\n\nHenderson, Zenna\n\nThe People: No Different Flesh - SF (psionics). One of the People collections.\n\nHeyerdahl, Thor\n\nKon-Tiki - Entertaining nonfiction. I read this, I think, about a million years ago.\n\nHodgell, P.C.\n\nGodstalk - Fantasy. (This series is soon to be reprinted by Meisha Merlin. Hm, they have Hellspark also.) Cool. It's not every series that has an avatar of destruction kicking about (and probably a good thing too.) Godstalk - uninterruptable fantasy supply Dark of the Moon - Second in the series. Dark of the Moon - hey, you can never have too many. Seeker's Mask - Third in the series.\n\nHofstadter\n\nGoedel, Escher, Bach - An eternally growing book. I don't think *I'll* ever finish it. Maybe I need more drugs.\n\nHoldstock, Robert\n\nThe Hollowing - Fantasy. I read Mythago Wood and didn't like it. I read this book also and I didn't much like it either, although at least I understood more of it.\n\nHoover, H.M.\n\nThe Delikon - SF. Juvie.\n\nHuff, Tanya\n\nSing the Four Quarters - Fantasy. Eh. Summon the Keeper - Fantasy. As fluffy and cute and funny as people have been saying.\n\nHughart, Barry\n\nBridge of Birds - Fantasy. Lovely. Bridge of Birds - It was going cheap. The Story of the Stone - Fantasy. Sequel. I don't like it quite as much (one of the characters needed a good smacking, but would probably just have enjoyed it or something.) Eight Skilled Gentlemen - Fantasy. Sequel. The Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox - novels of an Ancient China that never was - This is just the lot of them collected (then I found an ESG kicking around next month.)\n\nIpcar, Dahlov\n\nA Dark Horn Blowing - Fantasy. Way cool.\n\nJansson, Tove\n\nFinn Family Moomintroll - Juvie. Um. Fantasy. pause for a nostalgia moment.\n\nJoyce, James\n\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man - Fiction, more or less.\n\nKagan, Janet\n\nUhura's Song - Star Trek. Cat people! Whee! Mirabile - SF. Biology. Sorta. Hellspark - SF. Mystery sorta. Some people need more Personal Space than others (I have a little anecdote about that which ends \"oo, sorry! --why didn't you tell me she's from mit?\")\n\nKarr, Phyllis\n\nThe Idylls of the Queen - Arthurian mystery. Eh.\n\nKemelman, Harry\n\nFriday the Rabbi Slept Late - Mystery. Library sale. Pile. Yeah. Saturday the Rabbi Went Hungry - Mystery. Same.\n\nKerr, Katharine\n\nDaggerspell - Fantasy. Watch out what you promise, I guess. Darkspell - Same series. The Bristling Wood - Same series. (Actually it goes on for quite a while more, but I didn't feel compelled to own the others.)\n\nKipling, Rudyard\n\nKim - Fiction. whee The Jungle Books and Just So Stories - I have a friend who has NOT READ e.g. the Elephant's Child. I hope that you are not in the same sad position.\n\nKurtz, Katherine\n\nThe Chronicles of the Deryni - Fantasy. Hardback collection of the first three Deryni novels. For a while we had some degree of respect for the author killing characters at whim, in contrast to the \"i love my characters and cannot bear to hurt them\" sort (or I suppose the \"main characters shall be raped strictly on schedule, then get over it and live cheerfully ever after\" sort, which probably falls on a different axis entirely), but I've lost interest somewhere in the nth earlier-in-the-same-history trilogy. The King's Justice - Another Deryni novel.\n\nKuttner, Henry\n\nRobots Have No Tails - SF. Cute. Robots Have No Tails - backup. The Proud Robot - actually, another backup The Best of Henry Kuttner - I forget how good best is.\n\nLackey, Mercedes\n\nQueen's Own - Fantasy / wish fulfilment. (if this irritates you, proceed directly to Rider at the Gate (Cherryh), do not pass 'Go' etc.) Valdemar trilogy 1 (hardcover collection of the three Arrows.. books.) Magic's Pawn - Valdemar trilogy 2.1 (set long prior to 1.) Magic's Promise - Valdemar trilogy 2.2 Magic's Price - Valdemar trilogy 2.3 By the Sword - Valdemar item 3 (set prior to 1.) Winds of Change - Valdemar trilogy 4.1 Winds of Fate - Valdemar trilogy 4.2 Winds of Fury - Valdemar trilogy 4.3 Storm Rising - Valdemar trilogy 5.1 Storm Breaking - Valdemar trilogy 5.3\n\nLawrence, T.E.\n\nSeven Pillars of Wisdom - Nonfiction. This is a good book to read if it is August and you have just moved into an apartment that needs to be sprayed for roaches. It will cheer you right up. Things could be oh so much ickier.\n\nLe_Guin, Ursula K.\n\nA Wizard of Earthsea - Fantasy. First in the Earthsea trilogy. Cool. The Tombs of Atuan - Second. The Farthest Shore - Third. There's a fourth but I wasn't particularly thrilled by it. The Dispossessed - SF. Yeah. The Lathe of Heaven - Something or other. Cool. Five Complete Novels: The Left Hand of Darkness, Rocannon's World, Planet of Exile, City of Illusions, The Word for World is Forest The Wind's Twelve Quarters - Collection.\n\nL'Engle, Madeleine\n\nA Wrinkle in Time - Juvie fantasy. I assume everyone has read this. A Swiftly Tilting Planet - Juvie fantasy. I like this one best in the trilogy, but I can't explain why.\n\nLee, John\n\nThe Unicorn Quest - Unmemorable.\n\nLeinster, Murray\n\nDoctor to the Stars - SF.\n\nLevy, Steven\n\nHackers - Entertaining non?fiction.\n\nLewis, C.S.\n\nPrince Caspian - everyone's read the Narnia series, right? This set is incomplete. The Voyage of the \"Dawn Treader\" The Horse and His Boy The Magician's Nephew The Last Battle Out of the Silent Planet - SF. First in a trilogy (in the sense of three related books.) Perelandra - Second in the \"space\" trilogy. Mere Christianity - Nonfiction. Essays, I suppose they're called. The Great Divorce - Fantasy. Religion (well, this is Lewis, so it goes without saying.) Till We Have Faces - Interesting. The Dark Tower and other stories\n\nLindholm, Megan\n\nWizard of the Pigeons - Fantasy. Urban. Cool. Cloven Hooves - Fantasy. Un-urban. Possibly deserving of a \"parents of young children strongly cautioned\" movie-style rating. Harpy's Flight - Fantasy, presumably. On a pile somewhere. The Limbreth Gate - Same. Possibly a sequel.\n\nLisle, Holly\n\nMinerva Wakes - Fantasy. Fluffy. Has its moments. Mind of the Magic - Fantasy. Fluffy. Some random part of a series.\n\nLovecraft, H.P.\n\nThe Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath - Fantasy. I am fond of it.\n\nMacaulay, David\n\nMotel of the Mysteries - Everyone should read this. Heh.\n\nMacAvoy, R.A.\n\nTea with the Black Dragon - Fantasy. Cool. Oolong. Yeah. Twisting the Rope - Sequel. A Trio for Lute - Fantasy. (Trilogy collected in a hardcover.) Um, interesting. The Book of Kells - Fantasy. Lens of the World - Shrug.\n\nMartin, George R.R.\n\nA Game of Thrones - Fantasy. Remaindered tome sneering at pile of unluckier unread fellows.\n\nMcCaffrey, Anne\n\nDragonsong - Juvie fantasy (SF if you haul in the rest of the series.) First in trilogy. Dragonsinger - Juvie fantasy (SF if you haul in the rest of the series.) Second in trilogy.\n\nMcIntyre, Vonda\n\nThe Moon and the Sun - Fantasy. History. Romance. Ugly mermaids. Whatever.\n\nMcKillip, Patricia\n\nThe Riddle-Master of Hed - Juvie fantasy trilogy which some people consider Very Cool, but I guess I haven't read it enough times. Heir of Sea and Fire - Second. Harpist in the Wind - Third. Fool's Run - SF. Winter Rose - Fantasy. Ow. The Book of Atrix Wolfe - Fantasy. The Forgotten Beasts of Eld - Fantasy. Cool. Moon Flash - Fantasy. Unread.\n\nMcKinley, Robin\n\nThe Blue Sword - Juvie fantasy. Cool. The Hero and the Crown - Juvie fantasy. Same place, different time. Cool. Deerskin - Fantasy. Based on a, um, fairy tale.\n\nMcLoughlin, John\n\nToolmaker Koan - have I read this?\n\nMeyer, Nicholas\n\nThe Seven-Per-Cent Solution - \"a posthumous memoir of John H. Watson, M.D., as edited by\" The West End Horror - Same. Hey! Gilbert and Sullivan!\n\nMiller_jr, Walter M.\n\nA Canticle for Leibowitz - SF. Religion. Cool. (I guess it's now in an alternate universe where Vatican 2 didn't happen.) The Best of Walter M. Miller, Jr. - Collection.\n\nMilne, A.A.\n\nThe Red House Mystery - \"Silly old ass\". You were expecting \"bear\" too, weren't you? Mystery. Like the title says.\n\nMoon, Elizabeth\n\nThe Deed of Paksenarrion - Fantasy. (Also found in separate books as a trilogy.) RPG-type paladins portrayed *believably*, more or less. Phases - Collection Hunting Party - SF.\n\nMoorcock, Michael\n\nThe Elric Saga: Part I - Fantasy. N books collected in hardcover. The Elric Saga: Part II - Ditto. \"Blood and souls for my lord Scheme!\" Better not ask me to explain that.\n\nMontgomery, L.M.\n\nAnne of Green Gables - Fiction. Series recommended to some degree by same brother (not to imply that it's particularly similar to Forester, C.S.)\n\nMoran, Daniel Keyes\n\nEmerald Eyes - SF. first in a series. Cool. The Long Run - Second. Very cool. The Last Dancer - Third. Weird, but cool, I suppose.\n\nMorrow, James\n\nBible Stories for Adults - Eh.\n\nMyers, John Myers\n\nSilverlock - Fantasy, on unread pile. Why do I have a strange urge to say \"Bond. James Bond.\"?\n\nNiven, Larry\n\nThe Long ARM of Gil Hamilton - SF / mystery. World of Ptavvs - SF. Protector - SF. A Gift From Earth - SF. Ringworld - SF. Cool world. The Ringworld Engineers - sequel. I've also read Ringworld Throne just to confirm it wasn't worth the trees. Neutron Star - SF collection. Tales of Known Space - SF collection. Tales of Known Space - they have different covers, ok? Mote (w/ Pournelle) - SF. Cool. However, the sequel was lame (and unnecessary.) The Gripping Hand (w/ Pournelle) - The lame and unnecessary sequel. In hardcover, yet. All the Myriad Ways - Collection. Convergent Series - Collection. The Flight of the Horse - Fantasy? collection. A Hole in Space - Collection. The Magic Goes Away - Fantasy. The Integral Trees - SF. Cool world. The Smoke Ring - Sequel. Playgrounds of the Mind - Collection Dream Park (w/ Steven Barnes) - SF. Mystery. And the technology exists to be \"sufficiently advanced\" to produce fantasy, sort of. Collect the whole set. The California Voodoo Game (w/ Steven Barnes) - The second of two sequels. Beowulf's Children (w/ Pournelle and Barnes) - SF. Sequel to, um, whatever that book was. I got it for FREE. And it was almost worth every penny.\n\nO'Brian, Patrick\n\nMaster and Commander - First in the Aubrey/Maturin series. Historical fiction. Napoleonic sea battles or whatever. Do you like Jane Austen? Post Captain - If the first one didn't grab you, stick around for one or two more. Some people have started here. HMS Surprise The Mauritius Command Desolation Island The Fortune of War The Surgeon's Mate The Ionian Mission Treason's Harbour The Far Side of the World The Reverse of the Medal The Letter of Marque The Thirteen-Gun Salute The Nutmeg of Consolation The Truelove The Wine-Dark Sea The Commodore The Yellow Admiral The Rendezvous [short stories]\n\nKing & Hattendorf\n\nHarbors and High Seas: an Atlas and Geographical Guide to the Aubrey-Maturin Novels of Patrick O'Brian\n\nGrossman & Thomas\n\nLobscouse and Spotted Dog: Which it's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels - the most entertaining, and least likely to be used, cookbook *I've* ever owned. (Remind me to add the two cookbooks edited by McCaffrey which are only distant runners-up.)\n\nPanshin, Alexei\n\nRite of Passage - Juvie SF.\n\nPowell, Anthony\n\nA Dance to the Music of Time (A Question of Upbringing; A Buyer's Market; The Acceptance World) - Fiction. At Lady Molly's - Same dance, unread.\n\nPeake, Mervyn\n\nGormenghast - Haven't read it. It was very cheap. Titus Alone - Ditto. I think I'm missing one.\n\nPierce, Meredith Ann\n\nA Gathering of Gargoyles - Second in an apparently fantasy, but possibly SF, trilogy. I read the first one (second) at some point and eventually found the third but would have preferred not to have read it after all. It was a cool and poetically logical world up until then.\n\nPiper, H. Beam\n\nParatime - SF...\n\nPowers, Tim\n\nLast Call - Eh.\n\nPullman, Philip\n\nThe Golden Compass - Fantasy. I don't care where they shelve it, this is not a juvenile. The Subtle Knife - Second in the series.\n\n(I seem to have missed out on \"Q\".)\n\nRaskin, Ellen\n\nThe Mysterious Disappearance of Leon (I Mean Noel) The Westing Game The Tattooed Potato and other clues - Have not (re)read this yet, wonder if it is the same book I am thinking of.\n\nRenault, Mary\n\nThe Last of the Wine - Read half on a plane, have not finished it yet. Interesting depiction of an alien society. Er, I mean \"Historical fiction.\" Sorry. I kept having these Left Hand of Darkness, almost, moments.\n\nRobinson, Kim Stanley\n\nRed Mars - SF. I hope you like rocks. And politics. Green Mars - Second in the trilogy. Blue Mars - Yes, eventually I did buy it. Maybe I'll even read it. Later.\n\nRobinson, Spider\n\nTime Travelers Strictly Cash - Callahan stories. Callahan's Crosstime Saloon - Callahan stories.\n\nRosenberg, Joel\n\nHour of the Octopus - Fantasy mystery or something. Apparently it's the sequel to something I've never seen. D'Shai - Oh, well, that's what it's the sequel to. Have not got around to actually reading it now that I have it though.\n\nRostand, Edmond\n\nCyrano De Bergerac\n\nSayers, Dorothy\n\nWhose Body? - Mystery. Lord Peter Wimsey. Clouds of Witness Unnatural Death Strong Poison Five Red Herrings Have His Carcase Murder Must Advertise The Nine Tailors Gaudy Night - It would be a good idea to read Strong Poison and so forth before this one and the next one. Busman's Honeymoon Hangman's Holiday (short stories) Lord Peter (short stories) The Documents in the Case (w/ Robert Eustace) - Mystery. Not Lord Peter Wimsey.\n\nScarborough, Elizabeth\n\nPhantom Banjo - The Songkiller Saga I - Fantasy. Strum Again? - The Songkiller Saga III - Fantasy. Don't ask me what whoever sold them to the used-book store did with the middle one. Ate it perhaps.\n\nSchmitz, James H.\n\nThe Demon Breed - SF. Schmitz is known for strong female leads. The Witches of Karres - SF. Whee! The Telzey Toy - SF. Not the first Telzey book.\n\nSendak, Maurice\n\nChicken Soup With Rice - Everyone should own this book. Yes, I am strange.\n\nShakespeare, William\n\nHamlet\n\nShea, Michael\n\nNifft the Lean - Fantasy. Not ringing any bells at the moment.\n\nSheffield, Charles\n\nThe McAndrew Chronicles - SF.\n\nShetterly, Will\n\nElsewhere - Fantasy Nevernever - Fantasy\n\nShwartz, Susan and Greenberg, Martin H. (ed.s)\n\nSisters in Fantasy 2 - Fantasy. Collection. Has a Pamela Dean story (standalone). You know you want it.\n\nSilverberg, Robert\n\nTower of Glass - SF. This is where the Cube came from, except it is better in real life.\n\nSleator, William\n\nFingers - I'm not sure why this is the only one I have here. (Ok not anymore.) The Green Futures of Tycho Interstellar Pig Singularity\n\nSmith, E.E. \"Doc\"\n\nGalactic Patrol - Space opera. I think I am obliged to use the phrase \"rip roaring\" here somewhere, or possibly \"yarn\". These are good to read at the beach, although I hope you will be more thorough with the sunblock than I was. Gray Lensman - real Lensmen tan, I bet Second Stage Lensmen - whereas I blister Children of the Lens - though probably they don't tend to go to the beach much either. First Lensman - have I read this one yet? The Skylark of Space - First in the Skylark series. Skylark Duquesne - Not second, so I have not read it yet.\n\nStasheff, Christopher\n\nThe Warlock in Spite of Himself - Looks like fantasy. Have not been inspired actually to read it yet.\n\nStephenson, Neal\n\nSnow Crash - SF. Cyberfoo. The Diamond Age - SF. Nanofoo.\n\nStevermer, Caroline\n\nA College of Magics - Fantasy. College. Read if Tam Lin (Dean) gave you a warm fuzzy feeling in spite of all, I suppose.\n\nStewart, Mary\n\nThe Crystal Cave - Arthurian interesting Merlin viewpoint. First in a trilogy. The Crystal Cave - Hm. The Hollow Hills - Second.\n\nStewart, Sean\n\nNobody's Son - Fantasy. Eh. Cloud's End - Fantasy. I could have done without that last reference though. Resurrection Man - SF. Wasn't thrilled.\n\nStirling, S.M.\n\nMarching Through Georgia - Military SF. Having seen the fellow post so much on rasfw, I had to investigate. Not my cuppa.\n\nSwanwich, Michael\n\nVacuum Flowers - SF. The Iron Dragon's Daughter - Fantasy. I have yet to encounter someone who understood this book enough to explain it.\n\nTan, Amy\n\nThe Joy Luck Club - Bestseller languishing in library 35-cent rack.\n\nTarr, Judith\n\nAvaryan Rising - Fantasy. (collection of The Hall of the Mountain King, The Lady of Han-Gilen, A Fall of Princes.)\n\nTepper, Sheri\n\nMarianne, the Magus, and the Manticore - Fantasy. First in a trilogy. Cool. Marianne, the Madame, and the Momentary Gods - Second. Haven't got the third (malachite mouse, or something.) Marianne, the Matchbox, and the Malachite Mouse - found it The Song of Mavin Manyshaped - The second True Game trilogy. (At least, I think that's the publication order.) Fantasy, I reckon. (1) The Flight of Mavin Manyshaped - (2) The Search of Mavin Manyshaped - (3) King's Blood Four - The first True Game trilogy (1) Necromancer Nine - (2) Wizard's Eleven - (3) Jinian Footseer - A bit of the third True Game trilogy. Revises matters somewhat? The Revenants - Fantasy or something.\n\nThurber, James\n\nThe Thirteen Clocks - Juvie fantasy. \"Strike a light, or light a lantern.\" Everyone should read this book too.\n\nTiptree_jr, James\n\nBrightness Falls From the Air - Tiptree is Tiptree. Warm Worlds and Otherwise Up the Walls of the World\n\nTolkien, J.R.R.\n\nThe Tolkien Reader - I must have first read Leaf By Niggle before discovering such concepts as Allegory. I keep A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (which we read in high school) around to remind me of the word \"epiphany\". The Hobbit - I used to have a hobbit hole (neither sandy nor filled with the ends of worms.) With a round door. The Fellowship of the Ring The Two Towers The Return of the King The Silmarillion Unfinished Tales\n\nUnknown\n\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight\n\nVinge, Joan D.\n\nPsion - SF/psionics. Cat's Paw - Sequel. Maybe you can tell that Cyberpunk was In then. Dreamfall - Another Cat book.\n\nVinge, Vernor\n\nGrimm's World - SF. Eh. Across Realtime - SF. Marooned in Realtime - SF.\n\nWangerin_jr, Walter\n\nThe Book of the Dun Cow - Fantasy. Funky.\n\nWatt-Evans, Lawrence\n\nWith a Single Spell - Fantasy. Sometimes you can judge a book from its cover.\n\nWeber, David\n\nOn Basilisk Station - SF. Napoleonic-type naval battles translated into space. I just like saying \"a ship of the wall\". The Honor of the Queen - Same series... The Short Victorious War Field of Dishonor Flag in Exile Honor Among Enemies In Enemy Hands\n\nWhite, James\n\nFutures Past - SF collection. Hospital Station - SF/medical. \"Station General\". Star Surgeon - same. Major Operation - same.\n\nWhite, T.H.\n\nThe Once and Future King - Fantasy. Wart!\n\nWilhelm, Kate\n\nWhere Late the Sweet Birds Sang - SF. Cloning.\n\nWilley, Elizabeth\n\nA Sorcerer and a Gentleman - Fantasy. I really liked it in almost a Zelaznyesque way until a Certain Gratuitous Event and how it was dealt with. Way to spoil the mood or something.\n\nWilliams, Michael\n\nWeasel's Luck: Dragonlance Heroes Volume Three - Fantasy/RPG. Yes. I like this book. So there.\n\nWillis, Connie\n\nDoomsday Book - SF. Time travel. Oh the embarassment. Impossible Things - Collection containing \"Even the Queen\". Fire Watch To Say Nothing of the Dog - SF. Time travel. Messing about in boats. Maybe you should read Gaudy Night first.\n\nWodehouse, P.G.\n\nLeave it to Psmith Something Fresh\n\nWolfe, Gene\n\nSoldier of the Mist - Fantasy. Interesting.\n\nWrede, Patricia\n\nShadow Magic - Fantasy. Mairelon the Magician - Fantasy. Regencyfoo. Cute. Caught in Crystal - Fantasy (haven't read yet)\n\nWhy no Y?\n\nZahn, Timothy\n\nStar Wars: Dark Force Rising - Space opera. Heh.\n\nZelazny, Roger\n\nNine Princes in Amber - Fantasy series. Cool. The Guns of Avalon Sign of the Unicorn The Hand of Oberon The Courts of Chaos Trumps of Doom - Second Amber series, considered weaker. (Certainly more frustrating, since I read it as it was coming out.) Blood of Amber Sign of Chaos Knight of Shadows Prince of Chaos A Dark Travelling - Juvie SF. Doorways in the Sand - SF. Been on a roof or two myself. To Die in Italbar - Actually, I think this is Dave's. The Last Defender of Camelot - Collection. Lord of Light - SF. Cool.\n\n\"Graphic Novels\"\n\nThe Tick omnibus vol. 1 - Spoon. The Tick omnibus vol. 2 - Pockets! The Books of Magic: Bindings The Books of Magic: Summonings Sandman: Preludes and Nocturnes Sandman Sandman: Season of Mists Sandman: Fables and Reflections Sandman: A Game of You Sandman: Brief Lives Sandman: The Kindly Ones Usagi Yojimbo book one - Usagi Yojimbo is very cool. Usagi Yojimbo book two Usagi Yojimbo book three Usagi Yojimbo book four Usagi Yojimbo book five Usagi Yojimbo book six Watchmen - Yeah, probably everyone should read this one as well. Add it to your list.\n\nSuetonius\n\nThe Twelve Caesars\n\nPlutarch\n\nMakers of Rome\n\nTacitus\n\nThe Annals of Imperial Rome\n\nCicero\n\nSelected Political Speeches\n\nCool. I didn't know I had that many books. Now I just have to strip the html and install this on my palmpilot. \"I die. I stand in the used-book store, unable to remember whether I own the book I'm holding. ...\"\n\nBridget Spitznagel\n\nLast modified: Wed Aug 25 14:17:07 EDT 1999"
