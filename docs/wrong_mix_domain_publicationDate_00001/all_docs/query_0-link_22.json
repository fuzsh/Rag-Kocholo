S. THE CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY. Chicago, January ist, 1898. PREFACE. The plan of this catalogue is that of a single alphabet of authors and titles. It is a consolidation of all previously printed catalogues, supplements and bulletins of English Prose Fiction and Juvenile Books, and includes all accessions to January I, 1898. Authors are entered under their real names when known, and under the pseu- donym, or assumed name, when not known. Where only the initials of an author are given, the last initial is put first. A cross reference is made from the pseudonym to the real name, and the pseudonym is given in italics after the real name. Anonymous books are entered under the title only. Books especially suitable for young people are indicated by the case letter H. Under the author's name are given the titles of his or her books in alphabetical order, except in the case of series, which are arranged as the books should be read. Contents of volumes of short stories are given under the author's name. Works having a historical basis, and descriptive novels, are so indicated by a note appended to the title under the author's name only. When this information forms no part of the title it is enclosed in brackets. Titles are entered under the first word not an article, and also under an important, 3r catch- word, when such occurs in a title, followed by the author's surname. For the benefit of those who wish to plan a systematic course of reading in fic- tion, the list of bibliographical aids which follows has been compiled. Many of the t>ooks mentioned in this list, especially the catalogues of fiction in various libraries, liave been freely used in the preparation of this catalogue. The titles of all new accessions to the library, since January i, 1898, will be Eound on the bulletin boards in the Delivery Room, in the quarterly bulletins, and in the public card catalogue.
