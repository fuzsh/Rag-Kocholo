        "text": "Science fiction/space opera book series\n\nSkylark is a science fiction/space opera series by American writer E. E. Smith. In the first book, The Skylark of Space (first published in Amazing Stories in 1928), a scientist discovers/accidentally invents a space-drive, builds a starship, and flies off with three companions to encounter alien civilizations and fight a larger-than-life villain.\n\nThe Skylark of Space was the first of a series which continued through three subsequent books—Skylark Three and Skylark of Valeron written during the 1930s, and Skylark DuQuesne, written in 1963. R. D. Mullen declared that \"The great success of the stories was surely due first of all to the skill with which Smith mixed elements of the spy thriller and the western story (our hero is the fastest gun in space, our villain the second fastest) with those of the traditional cosmic voyage.\"[1] The series influenced the design of the early video game Spacewar!.[2]\n\nThe 2019 album All Aboard the Skylark by Hawkwind is named after the stories.\n\nSummary\n\n[edit]\n\nThe entire series describes the conflicts between protagonists Seaton and Crane, and antagonist DuQuesne, which often break into open warfare. It also includes depictions of progressively increasing scales of conflict (equalled by progressively-increased technology) between themselves, individually and collectively, and a series of non-humans bent on universal conquest. When forced to cooperate against an alien species which had conquered one galaxy and was expanding into others, the characters conclude that the universe is large enough to allow peace.\n\nNovels\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Skylark of Space (written 1915–1921, serialized 1928, published in book form 1946)\n\nSkylark Three (serialized 1930, published in book form 1948)\n\nSkylark of Valeron (serialized 1934, published in book form 1949)\n\nSkylark DuQuesne (serialized 1965, published in book form 1966)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Skylark of Space at Project Gutenberg (Transcribed from Amazing Stories 1928 publication.)"
