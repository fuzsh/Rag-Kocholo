        "text": "I feel like people just really like the idea of Frank Grillo. I mean, he’s a good-looking, charismatic, athletic guy who moves well and acts very naturally when he’s yelling. People like the idea of Frank Grillo being the person who yells at them to keep to the left, hey hey hey I said left! when evacuating a stopped subway train during an alien invasion (or when there’s anarchists attacking), or being the person who takes point during the we-are-slinking-down-a-suspiciously-deserted-street-all-stealthy-like, because, again, he moves well and handles his gun that never runs out of bullets with movie-star-like stylishness. And, mark this: people LOVE Frank Grillo sleeveless, shirtless, in a disheveled and tattered shirt, or in a clinging, wet, easily-seen-through-shirt. And it’s not like the guy doesn’t have range! He gets to whisper-yell encouragement to young kids and frightened women, and yell-coach a pregnant woman through labor (not kidding) even though she’s not due for another six months. WHAT.\n\nSo.\n\nThe movie starts like most Frank Grillo movies do, with the backstory and character trappings of our protagonist briskly illustrated by having him roll up to the station and drink something we know is futuristic because it’s sparkly and blue. He’s there to (unwillingly) bail out his son, who needs to be bailed out because this is a third strike and Grillo’s ex-partner doesn’t want to book him if he doesn’t need to. The family relationship has been strained since the wife/mother unit died; but father and son still do share a bond. All of this takes roughly thirteen minutes, and then the aliens start zapping people with blue light and beaming them onto their ship, which is hovering over LA.\n\n(This is where the “Hey hey hey stay on the right!” “Watch the rails!” “I SAID KEEP UP!”) part of Frank Grillo yelling at people comes in, and the gun that never runs out of bullets makes its first appearance shortly after the aliens do. And start ripping people’s brains out. Ugh.\n\nThis part lasts until Grillo and the group he is trying to protect (including his mesmerized son), all get beamed into the ship. He happens to escape (no, seriously, how come he’s still got ammo?), and, helped by one of the aliens, bumps into the pregnant woman. She explains that the stolen brains are running the alien….machines…and that the one helping is actually her husband and her child’s father. When the aliens get ahold of children…Such as the one who just arrived…damn that was fast…and the mother dies.\n\nAnd thus we get, which is also always a thing people like: badass guy protecting a child, because one thing people like is Frank Grillo, minimally shirt-clad, holding a baby. Meanwhile, Son and the Cute train Conductor are somehow not having their brains ripped out, and the mission is on to rescue them.\n\nI am just along for the ride at this point.\n\nThere’s a bit of yelling and thrashing around and Son gets his brain ripped out in front of Frank. What the actually meaningful part of this story is right now is a fight between the head alien, and the alien who was the baby’s father, who stayed behind to cover their exit….and had a grenade palmed.\n\nIn grand and traditional fashion, one explosive, no matter how tiny, in the right place, is enough to bring the entire ship crashing down. It’s somewhere…tropical…and the locals have by this point apparently figured out that GIANT MOTORCYCLE HELMETS PROTECT YOUR BRAINS. Lol. Also there’s a guy with a flamethrower. He gets a close-up for mysterious reasons.\n\nAnd then there is an ENTIRELY RANDOM kung fu fight. What?\n\nThe plot-relevant part of these guys is that they collect a crystal egg-like thing that fell on the ground. I’m guessing it’s a grenade or a computer or something. Our heroes make it out of the ship, with the visibly-larger baby. Also, it might bear mentioning that Cute Conductor is now also shirtless. Well, in a camisole. Heroes plus baby but soon minus blind guy bump into the motorcycle-helmeted duo. Also, the baby is about two years old now with a nice head of hair.\n\nHEY, THAT’S IKO UWAIS UNDER THE HELMET! (That explains the kung fu, LOL.) THIS MOVIE, SERIOUSLY. You could get an entire TV series out of the plot and genre shifts just this far and we’re only fifty-seven minutes in. (Lol at the motorcycle-helmet girl whaling on Cute Conductor Girl. That’s just unnecessary.) I mean, sheesh, they’re FIGHTING IN A MUD PIT WITH CLINIGING WET RIPPED SHIRTS ON. The guys are, that is. BUT THEN! Other guys arrive, necessitating the guys stopping fighting and joining ranks. Well, that was easy.\n\nHEY I RECOGNIZE THAT GUY HE IS THE OTHER INDONESIAN KUNG FU GUY (and had a flamethrower a few scenes ago.) More to the point, he also has a gun in Frank Grillo’s face. But they get the drop on him and decide to shoot him and then take him along. At this point the kid is about four years old and violence isn’t good for Baby Girl to watch.\n\nAnd our heroes march through Ankor Wat, or at least a nice CGI version of it to an underground base where they are met by a white guy with a British accent (a chemist by trade), and there is also a dedicated prison space for Other Kung Fu Guy. We are now one hundred and four minutes into the movie. (Wait, hang on, is this Cambodia or Thailand?)\n\nThis movie, seriously.\n\nAnyhow, the chemist guy sciences Baby Girl’s blood a little and gets freaked out. This leads to an unconvincing scene where Grank….yeah I’m leaving that typo…explains that SHE IS OUR HOPE! But also she’s running out of blood and her system is shutting down due to the demands of constant growth. Grillo volunteers for the transfusion, since he had stuff happen to him on the alien ship blah blah blah. And Ms. Motorcycle Helmet mellows out a little bit seeing Cute Conductor and Baby Girl cuddling up.\n\nSo we cut to…some random woman (who died in the intro) waking up in a hospital bed…\n\n…wait…noooooooooo….she has a wedding ring like the one Grillo has been playing with periodically, around her neck…\n\nNo, now I’m really confused.\n\nSo cut back to the science guy sciencing a little bit more, blah blah. Did he really just say, “Scientifically speaking”–? Sure did. Heh. And then at minute one hundred and thirteen, it turns out that using Baby Girl’s blood plus one of their canons will free all of the machine-soldier-brains. (“You sure he’s not doing the drugs?”) And thus the world will be saved. Suuuuuuuuuuure, and I believe you guys are going to do that all on your motorcycle-helmeted own, even if you do have a Vietnam-war era base with a punji stick trapdoor.\n\nAnyhow, our peaceful interlude is interrupted by brain-stealing aliens attacking the girls. Ms. Motorcycle Helmet runs into a minefield, drawing the brainstealing thing after her….but steps on something that goes click. It blows her up and destroys the Stealer. Cute Conductor flees back to base, horrified (and we get some more Reassuring Frank Grillo action, also getting Baby Girl somewhere safe. D’awww, he gives her a headbutt.)\n\nBut then (have I mentioned we are one hundred and nineteen minutes into this movie?) the Indothaibodians prepare to DEFEND THE BASE while Grillo heads out with the magical blood syringe to rescue the brainwashed (literally? Ew) machines. (“Fucking Americans.” Hah.)\n\nThe aliens start to move down into the underground base (which has been lavishly booby-trapped) while Grillo slinks around topside, action-movie-star-style. He makes it back up to the ship, but the civilians are forced to also flee the safety of the base. But it’s OK, because Iko Uwais launches a grenade at the glowing blue thingy and it blows up. BUT IT’S NOT OKAY BECAUSE THE ALIEN LEADER IS ACTUALLY THERE IN HIS ALIEN GIANT MECHA SUIT OH NOES.\n\nI think that’s about as much as I’m going to be bothered with. They’re fighting in the ruins of Ankor Wat and then the good mecha piloted by the Son who’s been rescued by the power of seeing his dad’s wedding ring shows up and lets just say Ankor Wat is going to be a little bit more ruined than it was before. Baby Girl arms the torpedo canon and then it gets fired off by Son and the alien machines’ eyes turn from blue (evil) to red (good). The family unit reforms….they’re gonna name Baby Girl after Grank’s dead wife Rose…and…\n\nCut to the woman from the beginning….Rose, all grown up, I assume…and despite the fact that she’s dressed in street clothes….look, SERIOUSLY, YOU GUYS COULDN’T HAVE STUCK HER IN A BODYSUIT OR SOMETHING? HELLO SHE IS A SEMIALIEN WEAPON IN COMMAND OF A SHIP ABOUT TO TAKE THE WAR TO THE ENEMY WHY IS SHE DRESSED UP LIKE SHE JUST HIT FOREVER 21? She gets hailed with “Captain on deck!” YEAH RIGHT but whatever because they’re taking the fight to THEM NOW.\n\n(GUITAR RIFFS)\n\n(Things blowing up spacey)\n\nHah, there’s a blooper reel over the credits.\n\nOverall, I feel a sense of impatience and pity for this movie. It tries so hard, and it has such energy and promise, and Iko Uwais fighting alien soldiers with dual knives and no sleeves and Frank Grillo fighting alien soldiers a tight wet shirt, and whatshisface, the other Indonesian guy, fighting alien soldiers with a machete and no shirt, and yet still it falls so short. I think it honestly could have worked really well as a series. With this budget (…per episode…) and cast, and enough time to flesh everyone out and make us care that Motorcycle Helmet Girl just got blown up and her chemist boyfriend is sad? With more time to watch Frank Grillo running around yelling at people? With a little more explanation of what the heck Baby Girl is? And then at least half an episode to follow up on the whole we-are-taking-the-fight-back-to-them? Absolutely this could have been a masterpiece. As it is, though…\n\nRated: This movie, seriously.\n\nTLDR: it’s just good stuff.\n\nThere are a lot of writing advice that has reached the point of ignored cliche simply because they are so well-known and commonly cited. Show, don’t tell. Brevity is the soul of wit. When in doubt, nuke it from orbit. Thing is, these things are so commonly cited because it’s so common that everyone ignores them and shouldn’t.\n\nMy paperback copy of this book is a trim 188 pages, and that’s counting the table of contents, author bio, and the publishing data. It’s a lean, swift story that is all one thing: high adventure on a far-off world and a young man coming into his own. There’s no digressions–no romance subplots dragging attention away from the main focus–no authorial indulgences sliding off into metaphysical musings or social commentary. Instead, there’s the formation of friendships, respect, and familial bonding of young men with each other; and there is the explanation of a simple and simply-delineated religion and theme, used in service of the plot and nothing else.\n\nThe art of telling a simple, self-contained story, in a single stand-alone novel that is no longer than it needs to be, is a lost one today. Every damn story has to be stretched out into a trilogy (and if it’s a four-part trilogy, so much the better). Every novel has to come with either its own separate encyclopedia of worldbuilding miscellanea, or has to have the equivalent of it stuffed awkwardly into its pages as the author desperately tries to show off and/or justify the work they’ve put in and are doubtless quite proud of. Now, worldbuilding is a good thing: but if one is not John Ronald Ruel Tolkien, it ought to be kept in the background. It should be used to infuse the main story with a sense of verisimilitude, and to enhance the current plot by offering a solid in-universe explanation for, for instance, why the Dead Men are hanging around waiting for the heir of Gondor. If absolutely necessary, characters can also lean on it to explain their actions, but while it’s cute to know that Aragorn mistook Arwen for Luthien Tinuviel on their first meeting and called her that, it’s also irrelevant to the greater scope of LOTR itself. (Although also kinda funny to imagine that calling your crush “Tinuviel” might be regarded as something as a bad pick-up line in Middle-Earth. One imagines Arwen has heard that one before….)\n\nAaand back to the novel I am actually reviewing: there is a lot of verisimilitude in this book, and it’s based on things like Kincar taking the time to stable, rub down, and feed his tired and sweaty larng before he himself takes food or rest. Other touches come just from the quality of the writing, like the simple but entirely unexplained differences in custom between Garthian and Star customs–and between those of the Earth of that current-day reader. There is no intricate history to be revealed and the mysteries of the Three who guard and oversee their Gorthian worshipper’s fates, remain mysteries even to the one selected as their tool and weapon. There doesn’t need to be a dramatic and detailed history of the past when it’s the present that concerns everyone and things are happening with smooth, logical rapidity now and the plot follows the actions–not reactions–of characters with ambitions, goals, and power.\n\nOkay, so, since it’s important: the plot.\n\nThe novel follows young Kincar s’Rud, Daughter’s Son to Hold Styr and therefore legitimate heir when his grandfather and chieftain dies, a fact which his uncle appears to hold some resentment over. Since this is an adventure novel, Kincar’s world is disrupted immediately. He is sent from the Hold with no more than the clothes and armor on his back, a map that will lead him to join his father’s kin, and–buried in his pack–a sacred talisman of his people. Kincar, who is normal-sized, blue-haired and ivory-skinned like all his people, had no knowledge of his parentage before now. He is, however, half of the blood of the Star Lords, the great ones who centuries before came down to Gorth in shining ships, lived on that world, raised its people from their barbarian wanderings, and united with them in culture and kin. The Star Lords, however, have decided to leave Gorth, fearing that their intervention in its culture and history has been harmful rather than good. Most have returned to the stars, but there are some among them whose love for the world is such that they refuse to leave it, instead seeking among all the worlds that are and have ever been, for the Gorth where they can fairly make their home.\n\nKincar soon finds himself among this group of exiles, and they soon to a new Gorth. But they soon find that this is also a world where the Star Lords landed–and here, the Star Lords are not settlers, neighbors, or kinsmen. Here, they are conquerors who demand to be worshipped as gods. And though it is easy indeed for a free man to stand up against a tyrant, it is harder indeed for a man to face one who wears the face–the form–the name–of his own brother, or his father–or himself.\n\nAnd I’m finding it increasingly difficult to write about this critically, so I’m going to just talk about stuff I liked. So there’s the use of animals. Kincar leaves Styr Hold with his riding larng, Cim, and his mord, Vorken. Cim is a beast unlike a horse but which must be cared for in similar manner, and who behaves in a vaguely similar manner when ridden by a person who can’t control him….which, lest we forget that Andre Norton was a grandmaster of the genre, succinctly and deftly leads right back to the plot. Vorken is a flying beast of known intelligence but alien mind, who saves the day more than once but who is also written, convincingly, as an intelligent yet alien creature with loyalty but also her own mind.\n\nThere’s the description of the Star Lords (and Lady) as slightly strange, slightly distant, very human, and very competent. Kincar, having been raised fully-Gorthian, has no real context for these people who are near-giants to him and his society; and he’s slightly wary and very watchful around them….only for his watchfulness to show their very human, very heroic natures. I like reading about heroes. I like reading about heroes who are heroic, kind, mature, and wise. I really liked the characters. Kincar himself is an excellent hero: competent enough through his own training, outsider enough to need things explained to him at times, and active enough to keep himself in the thick of things. He’s honest, honorable, and strong-willed, but still young and aware that he still has much to learn.\n\nThere’s also the darkness, seen, but lightly-described, of the second Gorth. Unlike, say, George R. R. Martin, an actually competent and talented author doesn’t need to dwell on, highlight out, and lingeringly describe the cruelties, torments, corruption, and excesses of this world that is ruled by evil gods. Andre Norton portrays the situation calmly and bleakly–showing a slave woman so broken she can’t bring herself to eat and who dies despite being freed; showing the despair and hatred of a young warrior who believes himself trapped and determines to go down fighting; and the bestial nature of a guardsman who has fully given himself over to the worship of his evil gods in the only way he can exercise it: through cruelty to those under his own power. And, because Norton isn’t a sick weirdo, she also portrays how this world escapes this fate and can–perhaps, with hard work and guidance–rise above it.\n\nThe difference between wholesomeness and unwholesomeness in literature is redemption. Is there a path that the heroes can take that will lead them to a better life, a better place, a better world? Or is there nothing but sludge, blood, lust, treachery, and despair? Is this a world written by an author that looks no higher than the top of the heap, that sees no meaning to anything more or better, imagines no improvement, sees no future? Or is there a way, no matter how hard, that leads to the stars?\n\nRated: Man still dreams–\n\nSo because I occasionally remember that this is supposed to be a scifi review blog and my muse is the all but forgotten Grandmaster of science fiction, noir, and the classic western, Leigh Brackett, when I spotted this one it was a natural buy. (Even if it was overpriced. The only bookstore in a small town, sigh.)\n\n[Ohh, I wonder if the stupid jumping the cursor around thing is wordpress trying to force people not to use the classic editor. That would make a lot of sense. May they live interesting lives and even more interesting afterlives.]\n\nI’ve read and reviewed this before: The Nemesis from Terra was Leigh Brackett’s first published SF story, published in 1944 as Shadow Over Mars. There’s an experience gap that definitely shows–not in the wordsmithing, or the worldbuilding, but in the gritty mechanics of the A to B to And Then It All Went Woosh plotting.\n\nNemesis from Terra / Shadow Over Mars is a simple and somewhat simplified tale of oppression, rebellion, and attaining heroic stature on a Mars that is old beyond memory–old, and time-worn, ground down to dust and yet alive and willing to live and grow young again, should opportunity come that it may grasp. Opportunity provided, perhaps, by an infusion of young, strong, virile energy from Terra, the world to which all worlds will look. However, this opportunity will definitely not come from the Terran Exploitations Company. The Company is quite transparently evil–if its name didn’t tip you off, they press-gang starfarers for their mining crews, hunting them down through the native quarter with Venusian anthropoids and enforcer thugs. Although there is a political organization of civilized Martians and Terrans trying to expose and defang the Company, their efforts are weak because (frankly) they aren’t our protagonists, which I think is kind of a raw deal for the cool, lawfare-minded Hugh St. John the utterly ruthless Eran Mak. And although there are still many on Mars who swear allegiance to their rightful king, and though they serve him with their strength and their whole loyalty, well, they aren’t the heroes either and thus are doomed to fail.\n\nWhich makes it a dicey proposition for absolutely everyone when a half-crazed old seeress foretells Richard Gunn Urquhart’s shadow over Mars. Rick, though, Rick isn’t really a hero….\n\nAs mentioned, plotting is the weak point of this novel(la). Its short length necessitates a level of time compression that doesn’t really help to strengthen the idea that either the villains or the hero/protagonists are particularly smart or good at planning, and there’s a weakness to the parts that don’t involve headlong action which could have been helped with a critical eye and a rewrite. The majority of Rick’s grand plan (one which, we are assured, no one else could have pulled off) is….rile everybody up with a couple of speeches and throw them at the Company headquarters. (But he keeps this plan secret in case they’re being spied on.)\n\nAnd–as I complained about before–both Rick and the author don’t really take any efforts to provide any clever twists, outwit or surprise their opponent or the audience. Rick’s best effort out outthinking Jaffa Storm is “crash a spaceship into the fort;” and the last-minute, last-gasp twist by Brackett is that Rick (wait for it) left-handed, which allows him to take the mind-reading Storm by surprise even though Storm is currently reading Rick’s mind. (I, having not read the book in several years, was expecting there to be some sort of automatic defense field over the Thinkers’ coffins, which Rick could take advantage of.) Unfortunately for Jaffa Storm, he is not left-handed, and thus falls Storm. Again, I think this is just because the brevity of the story doesn’t allow for any of the cat-and-mouse moves that would make a more satisfying plot.\n\nNevertheless. This one is still well worth reading simply because it’s by a Grandmaster of the field who was just coming into her own. Brackett’s Old Mars is there, and lacking her later elegaic* sensibilities, while it is a place old beyond time and full of dust, sins, and shadows, it is also a place where there is life that is young and eager to live.–if it can only find a clear way out. Her secondary characters absolutely steal the show–from the fighting man Beudach, a wolf to men but a dog to his king, who locks the Iron Collar on Rick and pledges him to the future of Mars, and the cold, cunning Eran Mak, who melts it to get it off Rick again–and then there’s the young king Haral himself, who despite his limited pagetime is a leader of men and his people, worthy of the loyalty he is given, undeserving of the death he gains.\n\nJaffa Storm is an interesting antagonist because of the lengths Brackett goes to show that he in fact outmatches Rick in almost every way. He’s bigger than Rick, stronger than him, a better fighter than him, smarter than him (although not smart enough to not monologue.) He’ll throw a trapped man a pack of cigarettes and give him enough time for a last smoke before lighting up the tunnel with a Banning shocker. And he’ll work for someone else only so long as he knows they’re stronger than him. He and Rick have developed quite strong personal reasons for hating each other by the end of the book, and their initial physical confrontation (which Rick loses) is savagely fought and written.\n\nSo it’s quite disappointing, to me, that Rick wins mostly by luck and the author’s intervention, rather than a) skill, b) intelligence, c) overloading Storm’s mind-reading with raw fury and going berserk, but, ah well.\n\nOverall, highly enjoyable, highly recommended.\n\nRated: The wind is rising–\n\nOverall, this is an excellent first draft of what would have been a rippin’ good scifi yarn if it had, y’know, actually had a second draft and some serious critical revision before it was published. It’s not quite a failure-its pulp-SF roots are too sturdy and its outline is, after all, tried and true (“man saves the day by solving A Problem”, done in the Dickensian fashion where 90% of that problem is “Understanding Myself”)–but it’s still not quite a success.\n\nThe plot is simple, despite dollops of philosophical and quasi-scientific musings: Johnny Joya, leader of the 3rd-generation of Sea People, comes out of retirement to fulfill his office at a dangerous fork in the crossroads of time. One way leads to the destruction of life on Earth. One way leads to the stars. Naturally, per ardua ad astra; and thus relations between Sea and Land have deteriorated to the point of hunting for sport and Mutually Assured Destruction by way of bioweapons and continent-killing nukes buried at the Ring of Fire Mohorovic Discontinuity. (C.f. The Eve of RUMOKO.) The Land People are corrupt–leadership-wise–and culturally and evolutionarily stagnant. The Sea People are stunted and restrained. And, Johnny Joya realizes abruptly (around the time the plot arrives at his polar hideaway), someone among the various players in this game has already pushed the Armageddon button….\n\n…the question is: who?\n\nWell, actually, the question is: what do the Space Swimmers have to do with all this, because it doesn’t seem like a lot, really.\n\nOr does it? Johnny Joya entered exile to protect his now-10 year old son. Tomi Joya is 4th-gen: the first to develop the instinctive extra-sensory perceptions all Sea People have into….something more, something that allows him to communicate with life of other species–to sympathize and identify with them totally, and gain their trust and help. OK, so the kid can talk to the Space Swimmers. But even if they know the answers–what makes you think that they would give them to children like–\n\n–us?\n\nSo.\n\nThis novel is interesting, evocative, imaginative, and also highly uneven. Some characters–Johnny and Tomi mostly–are well-fleshed out, but almost no one else is: not the Landsman scientist Leif (who unfortunately mostly remains Exposition Man), and not–sadly and vitally–the villains. Not having particularly well-portrayed villains is a distinct theme with Dickson, it is true; but in this book he also compounds the weakness by a) making a theme of their power over society and the resulting weakness and decay of said society, b) not actually showing the decay. And Dickson is fully capable of doing so. Sleepwalker’s World, disappointing as that novel was, drew a haunting picture of a planet in complete, somnolent collapse; whereas I’m not even sure what flavor of -punk dystopia this particular Earth is.\n\nOh, and: c) just purely not giving them enough screentime at all. There are two main antagonists in this novel, but they operate in similar (heavy-handed and antagonistic) ways, and since neither of them has a very defined ultimate goal beyond “Landsman; selfish, power-hungry,” it’s hard to tell them apart, and also hard to tell what they want and why–and why it’s a bad thing. Which is important when you’re framing your novel as “philosophical examination of the human condition + IN SPACE!” rather than, “hey I just had an neat idea about, get this, why don’t we evolve people who can SWIM IN SPACE, isn’t that neat? And so there are these bad guys who want to stop them so–“\n\nThe parts which work best are the fast-moving, pulpy, men-of-action-and-daring bits. The (shall we say science fictional) musings on evolutionary theory, duty, society, maturity, etc, are interwoven quite tightly–but I say that the whole thing needed to still be reworked once or twice more to make the garment fit. Clarifying the theme, simplifying and focusing the plot, and using plot and theme together to showcase the hero’s victorious habits and the villains’ lack of the same–would have helped.\n\nJohnny Joya is a strong enough character that I bought his storyline and its conclusion: that his parenthood gave him the understanding and the maturity to break through to the Swimmers and access their insight. I’m just….not sold on how that means the Council of Barons is going to be similarly impressed and also agree to a total societal overhaul in accordance to what is in effect an interesting perspective to bring up in an argument about Kids These Days.–or how this societal Sea (ahaha) change is to be effected, anyway.\n\nA slight change in theme: making it more about parenthood/fatherhood, showing the transfer of knowledge, personality, and mores from the older generation to the newer one and the satisfaction of seeing those things implemented with new strength and ideas–and drawing a contrast between the virility of the Sea People and the aging, childless Barons whose only ability to preserve their ideas or personalities is through their iron–but failing–grasp on society’s reins is, I think, a simpler but better expression of what Dickson was going for.\n\nThis is a lot of criticism, but, being said, is this a hit or a miss?\n\nI’d rate it 3/5: it’s solid enough where it matters, and it’s flights of navel-gazing are completely, if imperfectly, justified in-universe. The characters who are well-drawn are clean-cut heroes (even the love interest is solidly, if lightly, sketched), and if they’re slightly larger than life, it’s because they deal with problems that require greatness to solve. The themes are interesting, even if the solutions are unconvincing.\n\nAnd who, just who, doesn’t want a companion dolphin or killer whale?\n\nRated: The beaches of Lukannon shall know their sons no more!\n\nAlso rated: Ohhhhh it’s book 2, that does explain some of it. Oh well.\n\nSo throughout the existence of the science fiction genre, it’s been a maxim that the future contains present-day technology, or something that’s a little more advanced. In the 50s, spaceships were guided by windable tapes and refuelled by pipelines; expeditions were heropowered the men were dangerous and capable; fisticuffs, trebuchets and fire were just as prominently featured and expected as slide rules and bombs. Nowadays, everything is done via the internet (in this universe, “the feed”) and satellite, neural linkages and computers. Expeditions aren’t done by drone and remote, and the protagonists (male, female, or android) spend chunks of their time passed out and being rescued.\n\nI prefer the old stuff, because it isn’t a thinly thought-out extrapolation of current day technology applied to the distant future in spite of the fact that a) distant futures don’t really exist, b) the odds of technology in the distant future closely resembling present-day technology is nil. Even if Classic Era SF is, well, a thinly thought-out extrapolation of past-day technology applied to the future, it’s still a product of a different world, and it describes a different world, and it thinks different thoughts and dreams different dreams. In short, what I want in my escapist fiction: a different world, not this one slightly expanded.\n\nThat being said, The Murderbot Diaries are quite entertaining and after reading Network Effect I backtracked and downloaded All Systems Red, the first (?) novella in the series.\n\nOur hero, Murderbot in his private thoughts alone, is a security android who has hacked his governor module and is a free agent. He’s still pretending to be a mindless puppet, however, since he doesn’t want to be disassembled for parts. His job is protecting a group of humans who are surveying a newly optioned planet, seemingly only against aggressive unknown fauna but soon enough (naturally enough) also against the other survey groups on the world, who want its resources for themselves and are willing to let nothing like a little murder stand in their way. Even worse, some of the humans are trying to talk to him about his feelings…\n\nThis novella is: good. It’s not great–Murderbot, whose first-person POV we follow, is a strong enough character to carry the story. Murderbot is competent, solves problems, shoots aggressive fauna, fights bad guys, saves humans, and saves the day, while discussing it all in a snarkily detatched narrative voice and wishing he could just watch trashy soap operas instead. Unfortunately, the human cast of characters is too large to be similarly differentiated, and remain mostly only notable due to their distinctive names; a short infodump by Murderbot explaining that there are several couples, one potential couple, one quiet guy, etc., and that he likes this group because they are all nice people, falls flat. (Admittedly, giving everyone a distinctive name is a good trick, though.) Dr. Mensah, the expedition leader, and Gurathin (the quiet guy) are the only ones who do stand out, mostly because Dr. Mensah has the characterization of “leader” and Gurathin “the quiet one.” Focusing on a smaller cast (or leaving everyone extraneous behind at the base) would have helped.\n\nAnd–it needs to be said–for a story focused on a cyborg/android Murderbot with built-in energy weapons in each arm, a “large projectile weapon” and armor….the fight scenes are abrupt and moderately uninspired. Worse–and this something that annoyed me immediately–said armor is utterly useless. I mean, if your security unit is losing 20% of its bodymass while armored and fighting something equipped only with teeth and/or cilia, you are doing things entirely wrong in your story and in your universe. Nevertheless.\n\n(And Murderbot does spend a large chunk of its time passing out because it’s armor is useless and it ends up being perforated during the fight scenes. But on reflection, this is something that happens to heroes in general and so can’t really be complained about too much.)\n\nAll Systems Red isn’t half-bad scifi; not that I plan to read it again, but I do plan to read the rest of the series.\n\nRated: All systems….yellow.\n\nBack in the day when the scifi community handed out awards they meant something (for instance, the competition that Lord of Light beat out in the 1967 Hugos running was Dune, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, and Skylark Duquesne, oh and might I mention And Call Me Conrad —Zelazny was competing against himself), this won many of them.\n\nIt’s also really, really good.\n\nThe plot is simple: on a distant planet, the technologically-advanced members of the original crew and their favored descendants have set themselves up as the gods of the Hindu pantheon, using both technology and their personally-developed psychic powers to support this pose. All other technology–and technological progress itself–on that world is harshly suppressed. Against this, one day, the one called Mahasamatman (he prefers Sam) comes to re-invent the saffron robe and the teachings of the Enlightened One as one weapon among many that he raises against the gods…\n\n…and there are many other weapons, and many battles, betrayals, alliances, dalliances, schemes and strategems. Not easily will the gates of Heaven be broken, even by the great-souled Sam.\n\nAnd despite the story being told in one of those artistically anachronic ways that Zelazny seemed to be fond of, that’s it. It’s a straightforward tale of a man who has a goal and sets out to accomplish it. That the goal is the death of the gods–his peers, friends, and lovers of old–and that needless to say they do not tamely accept this goal, makes it more compelling, but that’s still basically it. Or is it?\n\nWhat else gives this story its strength, then? The characters? Yes.\n\nThat’s almost all I’m going to say: yes. Read for yourself of Candi the Fierce, of Tak of the Bright Spear, of Lord Kubera the Fat and of Agni, Brahma (once nee Madeline), of Nirriti and Yama, and Ratri, and Rild.\n\nThe other factor is of course Zelazny’s unmatched wordsmithing. Chunks of this book read with the vivid flow of (quality) poetry, and I only just noticed that he also casually drops allusions and lines of known poems in the flow of the prose (although these, though absolutely played straight in-story get fairly punny as well: cf “the Vasty Hall of Death, i.e., Yama’s workshop and laboratory. It gets referred to that once, in which case it seems like a reference the character is making….until it turns out that it is in fact the formal name of the place. Pwah).\n\nBut back to the characters: by the end of the story each of these, well, at least each of these that are still alive, are drawn so well to the mind’s eye that Zelazny doesn’t even need to flourish his pen. The most heart-wrending scene in the book (IMO) is written almost entirely through blank dialogue–and by the time you get to “Help me, Kubera.” you do not at all need any additional exposition to hear emotion in Yama’s voice.\n\nNot bad for a book written specifically for the sake of a pun, huh.\n\n(I’m out of time.)\n\nRated: The Lokapalas are never defeated.\n\nWhenever James H. Schmitz’s name is brought up, it’s usually in connection with the phrase “strong female characters.”–which, although true and we’ll get to it, is far from the only noteworthy thing about his work.\n\nSchmitz imagines a distinctive future: one where a balanced and peaceful society is maintained by ruthless and competent work at the underbelly and on the borders; where the most dangerous human beings alive are the scholars who count the cost and blink not an eye though their own very lives be counted of it. It’s a place where leaders are confident, capable, intelligent; where leadership is active, or, if not active, actively planning for the future.\n\nAnother of his trademarks is the heavy use of psi–psychic powers of one sort or another–by characters and in-universe institutions. Psi is treated with a casual verisimilitude in Schmitz’s works: its capabilities left more disturbing in their implications than in their on-screen uses….because a distracted and hungry psi is, after all, just another a human being who salivates over a delicious sandwich…\n\nThe other distinctive thing about Schmitz’s future is that it’s open-carry. There’s hardly a hero or heroine who doesn’t go about equipped and superbly capable of the use of an elegant little energy pistol or three.–and they usually need it, for his heroes are the ones who keep the merchant and the housewife, the children and the bureaucrats, safe. (He has an oddly positive view of bureaucrats.)\n\nOkay, so anyway: a lot of the Usual Suspects like to trumpet how science fiction is a boy’s genre, lacking in any kind of female influence. Before the Current Day, there were no women writing SF; there were certainly no women Grandmasters or editors; and there were no heroines. So, there would really have been no reason for the Father of Skaith (in, what I suspect was a desperate attempt to keep me out of the romance novel section of our local library after I’d read all the pony-girl books) to search out and buy me certain SF novels by certain authors. By that same logic, he should have had no memories whatsoever of “Telzey Amberdon and her telepathic tiger,” or Trigger Argee, the talking otters whose presence makes the decisive factor for Dr. Nile Etland to make real the legends of the ghostly Tuvela in the minds of invading alien species.–and I would never have read about Pagadan, whose life as High Queen of Lar-Sancaya remains a fondly remembered footnote to her ongoing career as a Zone Agent of Vega; or the Witches of Karres, or–\n\nOf course, Schmitz didn’t exclusively write about female protagonists; and they usually don’t hold positions of high authority–merely high responsibility and independence. Pagadan answers to the utterly devious, and totally dedicated Third Co-Ordinator of the Galactic Zones, but at the, well, galactic distances involved she is on her own to save the day–or get in over her head. Trigger Argee is a government employee, and her direct supervisor is the cool and ruthless Commander Holati Tate. Goth of Karres is a ten year old girl, who adventures out together with her protector-slash-sidekick Captain Pausert. In no way are the female characters’ agency subordinated to their male counterparts; and at no point are the male characters diminished in comparison to the female.\n\nAnd therein lies the secret. If the plot and action is compelling and the characters–no matter their sex–act and react compellingly to that plot, then there doesn’t need to be any artificial weaknesses or fake conflicts added. Readers can and will sympathize even more with a strong character who takes action during a crisis, than they would with a complex and conflicted one who does nothing, while nothing happens.\n\nThis is most evident in The Eternal Frontiers, the longest and second-most impressively creepy of the stories collected in this volume. The action begins by following Commander Crowell and his sidekick, Lieutenant Ilken Tegelen, and their efforts to–primarily, at first survive–expose and defeat a fairly-deadly political takeover attempt by the Swimmer faction of the Star Union, of the new mining colony on Kulkoor. Meanwhile, a group of scientists and explorers from the other existing galactic power, the Galestral League, are trying to support their lead investigator in finding out what happened to the wildcatters’ base found already abandoned on the planet’s surface. Their lives are complicated by the apparent fact that their leader is a loner who wants absolutely nothing to do with them. So Crowell and Ilken are making definite inroads on the conspiracy in their ranks; and Hastings and Gage are chasing down their investigator, when the Kulkoor Problem starts to loom forward as a very big problem indeed. There is something else on this planet, and it doesn’t want humans there.\n\nThings move very rapidly from thence.\n\nDoes it matter that Lt. Tegelen and Dr. Hastings are female, as is the chief conspiracist/initial primary antagonist, Public Servant Betheny? No, because as the plot unfolds, the only thing that really matters is what they can do. And Ilken Tegelen is a survivor and veteran of a vicious guerilla war that devastated her planet and people, just as Crowell Witter is the Ranger Captain and strategist who brought that war to a negotiated end that also benefited the Walker faction of the Star Union league and temporarily checked Swimmer ambitions. It doesn’t matter because we are too busy watch Ilken fight to stay alive, to protect Crowell from shots in the dark and stabs in the back while he is untangling a vicious conspiracy that could divide the Star Union further–or simply trying to keep as many people alive as possible. And we’re too busy holding our breaths as Jill Hastings walk out into the open with nothing but her Suesvant multi-rifle to act as bait for a deadly being which has already murdered multiple humans. Because everyone in this book is capable, intelligent, and actively engaged in important and/or cool stuff at every on-page appearance, their capabilities are shown and not told, there’s simply no time for anyone who isn’t. Because the pacing is relentlessly swift and never lets up, there’s also no place for useless or incompetent characters.\n\nAlso, did we mention that Schmitz was really good at adding evocative worldbuilding through context and flashback? Because he was really quite good at that, too.\n\nAnyhow, back to the rest of the book review:\n\nThis is an anthology gathering up most of the random stories Schmitz wrote which weren’t set in one of his established universes, such as the Federation of the Hub, or the Confederacy of Vega. They range in length, depth, and scifiness; a few are basically just crime stories, albeit mostly with a lurking, fantastic slant. (“Faddist” in particular has no bizarre elements and only the succinct nastiness of the twist at the end could really identify it as a Schmitz work.) And, as an anthology, some of the stories are stronger than others. Also: titles don’t seem to be Schmitz’s strong suit, because while he specializes in quick, hard-hitting tales with a strong hook and an often-devastating twist, that’s rarely reflected in titles such as “Ham Sandwich” or “Incident on Route 12,” which I find vaguely unfortunate.\n\nAnyhow, to briefly review my standouts:\n\n“Just Curious” is one of them, and because it’s quite short just about any synopsis will spoil it. It’s also the most impressively creepy story in this anthology, one which I remembered for years after its first reading. When the king-beast is angry, there is something to fear; when the king-beast is afraid, all the jungle goes still…\n\n“Left Hand, Right Hand” is a story of the Danger: Human genre. A scholar is the most deadly foe you can make, particularly if this scholar is a biologist and you are an alien species preparing to genocide his planet. Likewise, “Spacemaster” posits that no matter how degraded the genetic stock, the human spirit persists and seeks knowledge.\n\n“Crime Buff” is an entry in the “small girl, LARGE danger” genre seemingly forgotten by Western authors. Jeff Clary is a dangerous and desperate criminal at large who happens on a young girl in her family’s mostly-empty house just before the reunion. Jeff Clary really should have kept on walking….\n\n“Swift Completion” is one of those stories that follows when everyone–from the wife who believes her husband is plotting to kill her, to the husband himself, who definitely is–is just a little too clever for their own good, and what happens thereafter once everyone gets their way.\n\nAnd then there’s “Faddist,” which made me giggle because I have been on both sides of the argument and currently have a large box of highly-processed and extremely delicious sugar and cream filled cookies in my fridge right next to a bag of spinach. But I swear I wouldn’t force anyone to eat one in preference to the other…..\n\nAnyhow, if you see Schmitz’s name pop up, it’s well worth your time to read his stuff, because it’s top-notch scifi of the kind they don’t make any more.\n\nRated: And I thought you were soft….I thought you were weak and soft…"
