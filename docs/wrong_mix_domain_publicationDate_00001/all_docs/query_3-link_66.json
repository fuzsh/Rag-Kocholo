        "text": "Voorloper – Andre Norton – so one of the strengths of a good scifi / fantasy novel is the title. A good title should draw the eye, invoke curiousity, hint at mystery, danger, adventure, and a complex plot and/or worldbuilding. Old-school scifi had quite a number of bangers. Anyhow, the general rule of thumb is: either make your title such that it doesn’t require in-depth prior knowledge of the book/series/world for general audience benefit; or, if you are referencing something–person, concept, item, in-story, that requires a made-up word or words, make those words be aesthetically pleasing and/or fairly straightforward. Voorloper scores a 5/10: it’s ambiguous enough up front that I checked the book to make sure it was English and not, say, some kind of misplaced German translation or something.\n\nAnd things don’t improve tremendously once we get into the meaning of it, either. What is a Voorloper? A Voorloper is someone who–wait for it–lopes across Voor: a long-distance muleteer or hauler on the recently-colonized planet Voor. Such is the occupation of Mac Turley s’Ban. Mac was not always a traveler without a home: it only became his life after the Shadow Plague wiped out Mungo Town, killing every living soul there….save one. His son, Bart s’Lorn, our protagonist and narrator, is one of the few who ever survived the unknown and mysterious [kinda spoiled by calling it a “Shadow”-with-capital-S] death that has struck many towns. The only survivors, if any, of the Shadow Plagues are infants too young to speak or remember, or a single adult who was left babblingly mad and who destroyed herself at the first opportunity. Mac has made it his life to investigate the Shadow-stricken [kinda spoiled it by assuming/proving agency to the Shadow-with-capital-S] towns and probe the mystery [it’s the original native inhabitants and their Science Gone Wrong] of the plague. They are joined on their quest by Illo, another survivor, who has psychic gifts and healing ability and who….kind of doesn’t do very much with either of them, honestly.\n\nAnyway. Despite my scoffing, it’s a moderately engaging mystery, albeit with a heavily-foreshadowed, slightly cliche solution; Norton handles her tropes, timing, plotting, and characters deftly with a grandmaster’s expertise. She even largely keeps the action above-ground (underground nightmare realms are a favorite Norton trope and I cordially hate it.)\n\nIt’s not a bad book: it’s just one not destined for very much.\n\nLift – a 2024 heist movie starring Kevin “Wow he’s short. Poor dude.” Hart and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, whose name I know and can spell because, c’mon, Gugu Mbatha-Raw. It’s hella fun to say. No idea which person he/she/xir was, but w/e. And also there’s “Hey is that that guy [Vince Vaughn]?” “Who?” “Nahhh. Never mind” who turned out to be Vincent Donofrio anyway. And also “Argh, who is that dude? He’s that dude in everything!”–who turned out to be an aged like the good marmite scraping on scrumptious buttered toast Sam Worthington, damn. Dude is fine now that he’s not trying to be the action hero heartthrob of the month. It’s not a bad movie, despite the stunning diversity of the cast (including vertical diversity, heh). It even has a direct swipe taken at what used to be called political correctness and is now called wokeness via the one character who does lean on it being a total asshole doing it for his own benefit and also some humor. It’s extremely lightweight and could have been improved with additional well-written humor; but it’s not bad.\n\nWe also watched about half of Baahubali 2: the Conclusion. So if you’ve ever wondered why people curse the demise of Hollywood, here is one reason: Hollywood no longer makes movies that can keep a hyperactive nine year old entertained with the pretty colors and pretty people (and random slow-mo), even when she can’t understand what they’re saying and has zero reading comprehension. It was a quite entertaining movie, partly because I’m a sucker for the kind of goofy romance where the hero’s buddies spend their time alternately mocking and wingmanning him; and there are quite a few cool sequences and overall it was just fun and pretty. Not sure how / if there’s going to be a happy ending but hey. Pretty.\n\nSo I have been able to get some reading done this week. Spoiler: it’s all pretty meh.\n\nFirst up was Lord Darcy, a three-in-one omnibus by Randall Garrett including short story collections Murder and Magic, Lord Darcy Investigates, and short novel Too Many Magicians.\n\nThe Lord Darcy stories are set in an alternate history where a) magic is real and the study of magic has replaced the development of technology, b) Richard Plantagenet survived the crossbow wound in France and settled down to become a brilliant, wise, and wonderful monarch whose dynasty continues into the present day and whose English/French monarchy considers itself master of the world. Even though, when you think about it, it ain’t half as successful as our British Empire once was. But anyhow. England in our universe, like the Eldar, has faded; but this England is still doing well. It’s a quasi-Victorian age (albeit there is a Richard and not a Victoria on the throne), and Lord Darcy is our Sherlock Holmes expy. He is accompanied by a his friend and partner Not-Watson, a licensed forensic magician.\n\nAs you may be able to tell by the titles and this description, the genre is vaguely otherworlds-fantasy-mystery and there are bucketloads of allusions to other, better genres and stories. Most of which, I will admit, I didn’t get until Wiki explained them to me. And while it is pretty funny that James le Lien gets decidedly miffed about Lord Darcy getting to sleep with the hot enemy spy, my utter lack of enthusiasm for the Hercule Poirot (or whoever Bontriumphe is supposed to be? Did Mycroft Homes have an assistant? Whatever.)-expies made chunks of Too Many Magicians fall flat to me.\n\nI read a few of the Lord Darcy stories some years ago and wasn’t impressed. I continue to be unimpressed, but they aren’t all that bad if you like mysteries, otherworlds, investigative fiction that may or may not include magic but definitely includes plot points stolen from other, better works. Yeah.\n\nRated: Eh.\n\nMirkheim – Poul Anderson (a David Falkayn/Nicholas van Rijn story)\n\nDespite Poul Anderson’s old-school SF Grandmaster’s ability to conjure and create evocative titles for his stories (it’s a lost and very important art), whenever I do find myself reading his works I remember why I never had the urge to seek them out in the first place. There’s nothing particularly terrible, or great about this book; it simply has a jerky and yet overly simplistic setup, and an overly simplistic (almost Hollywoodesque) solution and denouement. On the other hand, the prose is clean, lean, and clear; the action scenes, though few and far between, are slashing, grim, exciting, and expertly blocked out. A fan of the character, author, or series might have more to say about it; I’m going to go with “Eh.”\n\nRated: Anderson could have done better on the title, too, I’m sure.\n\nDragonhaven – Robin McKinley\n\nSo sometimes it’s good not to try and read your favorite author’s blog. You might learn something you didn’t want to know, and it might put you off reading even their good stuff. For instance, they might be viciously partisan political and they might be voting for the other lizards. Or perhaps they just don’t ever shut up about politics. They might have religious differences to you. Oooooor, in the case of Ms. McKinley, they might write in an incomprehensible and very rambling, incohesive and tangential stream-of-consciousness style with random punctuation and capitalization errors that really, really, tremendously lowers your respect for them as sapient and/or sentient, intelligent human lifeforms.\n\nGuess what style and genre this book is written in?\n\nI do have to give her props, though, because even though I disliked this book heartily, it’s actually a technical success. McKinley pulled off something impressive and stuck the landing: this book is not actually about dragons, it is about BABIES and MOTHERHOOD. McKinley uses every tool in her storyteller’s toolbox to make that one, single, point very, very clear; and this book is the result.\n\nSo instead of, for instance, a science-hero type situation where a clear-headed (more or less) brave scientist hero or heroine gets involved in a situation, has their skepticism challenged, logics out a solution / communication method, etc, and saves the day, preferably in under 200 pages, we get…well. (There are so many ways this book could have been written and so many different subgenres you could put it into. Straightforward scifi/fantasy. Pseudodocumentary. Metatextual with Jake and his beta readers arguing with the editors. Epistolary correspondence between lawyers and the foundation. Etc.)\n\nAnyhow. What we get is a narrator who starts out as a fourteen-year-old boy who has been entirely raised in one of the only three dragon preserves in the world, who is as self-centered as a fidget spinner and about as tolerable after twenty minutes’ exposure. Jake isn’t particularly smart, particularly perceptive, doesn’t keep good notes, doesn’t describe things well, keeps wandering off on tangents, and in fact is out of his mind for a good chunk of the book (because caring for BABY makes you tired.) Since it’s narrated by Jake (the literary conceit is that he starts writing it at about seventeen and finishes the last few chapters when he’s in his early twenties), and since Jake is a) as self-centered as a gyroscope, b) not very perceptive, c) entirely engrossed with BABY dragon, the plot is almost non-existent. Even when other characters are not deliberately excluding Jake from discussions about THE LOOMING THREAT OF THE DISSOLUTION OF THE SANCTUARY AND THE EXTERMINATION OF ALL DRAGONS (because he’s busy with BABY), Jake kind of….just doesn’t care in the slightest. Because once BABY nothing else matters to parent.\n\nWhich, I mean, fair.\n\nBut for there to be 300+ pages of BABY BABY BABY (DRAGON) BABY BABY BABY (HUMAN!) when fifty would have sufficed, is just bad writing. McKinley gets her point across quite well and the dragons in and of themselves are almost cool enough for you to not start thinking about the logistical ramifications until, for instance, writing the review afterwards.\n\nI still enjoy her Damar work, and whatever else I’ve stumbled across of her stuff here and there. But ye gods.\n\nRated: BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY DO YOU GET THE PICTURE YET? BABY.\n\nAlso rated: okay, hang on, so dad-dragon had time to fly six-odd hours to fetch Jake for the second litter, but original mom-dragon somehow got caught with her scales down and was able to summon Jake while her kits were being born but not to call for help from another dragon, even though it’s usual for there to be other dragons present when baby dragons are being born? Hang on….\n\nTLDR: it’s just good stuff.\n\nThere are a lot of writing advice that has reached the point of ignored cliche simply because they are so well-known and commonly cited. Show, don’t tell. Brevity is the soul of wit. When in doubt, nuke it from orbit. Thing is, these things are so commonly cited because it’s so common that everyone ignores them and shouldn’t.\n\nMy paperback copy of this book is a trim 188 pages, and that’s counting the table of contents, author bio, and the publishing data. It’s a lean, swift story that is all one thing: high adventure on a far-off world and a young man coming into his own. There’s no digressions–no romance subplots dragging attention away from the main focus–no authorial indulgences sliding off into metaphysical musings or social commentary. Instead, there’s the formation of friendships, respect, and familial bonding of young men with each other; and there is the explanation of a simple and simply-delineated religion and theme, used in service of the plot and nothing else.\n\nThe art of telling a simple, self-contained story, in a single stand-alone novel that is no longer than it needs to be, is a lost one today. Every damn story has to be stretched out into a trilogy (and if it’s a four-part trilogy, so much the better). Every novel has to come with either its own separate encyclopedia of worldbuilding miscellanea, or has to have the equivalent of it stuffed awkwardly into its pages as the author desperately tries to show off and/or justify the work they’ve put in and are doubtless quite proud of. Now, worldbuilding is a good thing: but if one is not John Ronald Ruel Tolkien, it ought to be kept in the background. It should be used to infuse the main story with a sense of verisimilitude, and to enhance the current plot by offering a solid in-universe explanation for, for instance, why the Dead Men are hanging around waiting for the heir of Gondor. If absolutely necessary, characters can also lean on it to explain their actions, but while it’s cute to know that Aragorn mistook Arwen for Luthien Tinuviel on their first meeting and called her that, it’s also irrelevant to the greater scope of LOTR itself. (Although also kinda funny to imagine that calling your crush “Tinuviel” might be regarded as something as a bad pick-up line in Middle-Earth. One imagines Arwen has heard that one before….)\n\nAaand back to the novel I am actually reviewing: there is a lot of verisimilitude in this book, and it’s based on things like Kincar taking the time to stable, rub down, and feed his tired and sweaty larng before he himself takes food or rest. Other touches come just from the quality of the writing, like the simple but entirely unexplained differences in custom between Garthian and Star customs–and between those of the Earth of that current-day reader. There is no intricate history to be revealed and the mysteries of the Three who guard and oversee their Gorthian worshipper’s fates, remain mysteries even to the one selected as their tool and weapon. There doesn’t need to be a dramatic and detailed history of the past when it’s the present that concerns everyone and things are happening with smooth, logical rapidity now and the plot follows the actions–not reactions–of characters with ambitions, goals, and power.\n\nOkay, so, since it’s important: the plot.\n\nThe novel follows young Kincar s’Rud, Daughter’s Son to Hold Styr and therefore legitimate heir when his grandfather and chieftain dies, a fact which his uncle appears to hold some resentment over. Since this is an adventure novel, Kincar’s world is disrupted immediately. He is sent from the Hold with no more than the clothes and armor on his back, a map that will lead him to join his father’s kin, and–buried in his pack–a sacred talisman of his people. Kincar, who is normal-sized, blue-haired and ivory-skinned like all his people, had no knowledge of his parentage before now. He is, however, half of the blood of the Star Lords, the great ones who centuries before came down to Gorth in shining ships, lived on that world, raised its people from their barbarian wanderings, and united with them in culture and kin. The Star Lords, however, have decided to leave Gorth, fearing that their intervention in its culture and history has been harmful rather than good. Most have returned to the stars, but there are some among them whose love for the world is such that they refuse to leave it, instead seeking among all the worlds that are and have ever been, for the Gorth where they can fairly make their home.\n\nKincar soon finds himself among this group of exiles, and they soon to a new Gorth. But they soon find that this is also a world where the Star Lords landed–and here, the Star Lords are not settlers, neighbors, or kinsmen. Here, they are conquerors who demand to be worshipped as gods. And though it is easy indeed for a free man to stand up against a tyrant, it is harder indeed for a man to face one who wears the face–the form–the name–of his own brother, or his father–or himself.\n\nAnd I’m finding it increasingly difficult to write about this critically, so I’m going to just talk about stuff I liked. So there’s the use of animals. Kincar leaves Styr Hold with his riding larng, Cim, and his mord, Vorken. Cim is a beast unlike a horse but which must be cared for in similar manner, and who behaves in a vaguely similar manner when ridden by a person who can’t control him….which, lest we forget that Andre Norton was a grandmaster of the genre, succinctly and deftly leads right back to the plot. Vorken is a flying beast of known intelligence but alien mind, who saves the day more than once but who is also written, convincingly, as an intelligent yet alien creature with loyalty but also her own mind.\n\nThere’s the description of the Star Lords (and Lady) as slightly strange, slightly distant, very human, and very competent. Kincar, having been raised fully-Gorthian, has no real context for these people who are near-giants to him and his society; and he’s slightly wary and very watchful around them….only for his watchfulness to show their very human, very heroic natures. I like reading about heroes. I like reading about heroes who are heroic, kind, mature, and wise. I really liked the characters. Kincar himself is an excellent hero: competent enough through his own training, outsider enough to need things explained to him at times, and active enough to keep himself in the thick of things. He’s honest, honorable, and strong-willed, but still young and aware that he still has much to learn.\n\nThere’s also the darkness, seen, but lightly-described, of the second Gorth. Unlike, say, George R. R. Martin, an actually competent and talented author doesn’t need to dwell on, highlight out, and lingeringly describe the cruelties, torments, corruption, and excesses of this world that is ruled by evil gods. Andre Norton portrays the situation calmly and bleakly–showing a slave woman so broken she can’t bring herself to eat and who dies despite being freed; showing the despair and hatred of a young warrior who believes himself trapped and determines to go down fighting; and the bestial nature of a guardsman who has fully given himself over to the worship of his evil gods in the only way he can exercise it: through cruelty to those under his own power. And, because Norton isn’t a sick weirdo, she also portrays how this world escapes this fate and can–perhaps, with hard work and guidance–rise above it.\n\nThe difference between wholesomeness and unwholesomeness in literature is redemption. Is there a path that the heroes can take that will lead them to a better life, a better place, a better world? Or is there nothing but sludge, blood, lust, treachery, and despair? Is this a world written by an author that looks no higher than the top of the heap, that sees no meaning to anything more or better, imagines no improvement, sees no future? Or is there a way, no matter how hard, that leads to the stars?\n\nRated: Man still dreams–\n\nSo one half of the The Nemesis From Terra / Battle for the Stars double novel having been reviewed, the other half needs must be also. I also read and reviewed this one several years ago, and on reread it absolutely holds up.\n\nBattle for the Stars was published in 1961, and is the work of a polished, mature, and experienced author. Every part of it is welded together with absolute precision, every scene and character supports the overall plot and theme, there is a thrilling battle and victorious conclusion, a vicious twist, and a hopeful denouement. It’s really good stuff by the World Wrecker himself.\n\nSo, plot:\n\nCommander Jay Birrel of the Fifth Lyran Fleet is used to border skirmishes and hit-and-run raids by the stellar powers (ostensibly there are a handful, but practically, the main power struggle is between Lyra, headed by the cunning but tyranical Ferdias and Orion, lead by the unseen Solleremos). A professional military man, he’s an expert at it, in fact. But when he’s informed of the potential for all-out war, war for control of an innocent and unaligned planet, he’s horrified. The Fifth Lyran Fleet is ordered to this planet in order to protect it from the rapacious Orionids — who planned to strike first themselves in order to prevent Lyra from taking it over.\n\nThe planet, needless to say, is the half-forgotten motherworld, Earth. And though Earth is virtually powerless on a galactic scale, still it holds an undefinable power over its far-strayed children, and still its inhabitants are not without pride and do not take lightly to the thought of outsiders deciding their fate….and though Birrel’s orders are to protect Earth, are those truly his leader’s intentions?\n\nEverything about this book is perfectly balanced and utterly satisfying. The plot runs, twists, flashes into space opera action, and I never once had a bored thought or a worry that it wasn’t going to resolve itself correctly as well as satisfyingly. Speaking of space opera action: there’s quite a lot of it, and although I suppose some of it might be dated…it seemed pretty comparable to the last space opera battle I read, which was one of the Lost Fleet books. But I am easy to please as long as there are missiles, lasers, some frantic maneuvering, and for a cherry on top, radio chatter. Man I love me some radio chatter. Anyway, the space battle scenes are very well done in a simple, more visual than technical way that read just fine to my eye. (Does anyone know how space battles are really going to be fought?)\n\nThe novel tightly follows our main character’s POV. Birrel is an everyman hero, rather than an iconic or charismatic one. He’s only average height. He’s a worrier. His wife isn’t happy about coming to Earth with him. He’s a professional naval officer who has spent practically his entire life aboard ships; not a diplomat. He’s loyal, careful, diligent, and completely lacking in duplicity….which, given that he’s been placed directly into the eye of a diplomatic and political firestorm, means that he’s a permanent half-step behind everyone else in the Great Game and miserably aware of it. And he’s a superbly competent leader of men or ships in battle.\n\nOne of the things that a lot of modern media lacks is competence–especially when it comes to leaders and leadership. This stems from a lot of reasons, from an overreliance on being the “underdog” to gain audience sympathy, to a widespread breakdown of trust in social mechanisms, to simple incompetence on the writers’ parts; and whatever the cause, the result is more constrained and cliched stories. For the most part, writers use this as a way of introducing a conflict which they can at length easily solve without exerting themselves or making their characters step outside of comfortable, well-known behavior patterns. They stick to the tried (trite) and true formula of “hero wants to do heroics! Authority forbids, believing it will be unsuccessful! Hero defiantly does heroics, successfully! Authority accepts because successful and congratulates Hero because Hero Is Cool.” Notice that this is a one-note pattern that only requires each party to act in one single way: the way they always have and always will.\n\nHamilton, being an old Grandmaster, doesn’t do that here. Although he sets his hero up at a distinct disadvantage (aka: underdog), Birrel responds to the unusual challenges presented him by changing his method of approach. This pattern requires an author who can present a character and personality with defined preferences, and then present a scenario in which that character would act in a manner different to their own preferences that is still an intelligent manner, because it is consistent with their personality to be intelligent.–and then, the hero having succeeded despite being actually an underdog, out of his depths and preferred sphere, the hero is able to return to his own preferred ground and lead a triumphant (as if that’s a spoiler) battle.\n\nThis is a very good trick. It’s almost as good as the trick where someone ends up manning the antiaircraft guns whilst scantily clad, which Hamilton was also good at.\n\n[wordpress, blessings be upon it, deleted my two summary paragraphs. I can assure you they were brilliant, though.] Anyhow, besides making Birrel step outside his comfort zone, Hamilton also presents us with a quick–but vivid–view of Ferdias, the man Birrel defers to, who understands power and ambition and psychology, but not…quite…emotions. Grandmaster of Scifi, remember? Also: if thou art a tyrant, thou canst not have friends.\n\nGoddamn it wordpress, those were brilliant paragraphs and now I can’t remember them.\n\nAnyhow. There’s also a kitty, which is another automatic win.\n\nRated: The stars are ours!\n\nSo because I occasionally remember that this is supposed to be a scifi review blog and my muse is the all but forgotten Grandmaster of science fiction, noir, and the classic western, Leigh Brackett, when I spotted this one it was a natural buy. (Even if it was overpriced. The only bookstore in a small town, sigh.)\n\n[Ohh, I wonder if the stupid jumping the cursor around thing is wordpress trying to force people not to use the classic editor. That would make a lot of sense. May they live interesting lives and even more interesting afterlives.]\n\nI’ve read and reviewed this before: The Nemesis from Terra was Leigh Brackett’s first published SF story, published in 1944 as Shadow Over Mars. There’s an experience gap that definitely shows–not in the wordsmithing, or the worldbuilding, but in the gritty mechanics of the A to B to And Then It All Went Woosh plotting.\n\nNemesis from Terra / Shadow Over Mars is a simple and somewhat simplified tale of oppression, rebellion, and attaining heroic stature on a Mars that is old beyond memory–old, and time-worn, ground down to dust and yet alive and willing to live and grow young again, should opportunity come that it may grasp. Opportunity provided, perhaps, by an infusion of young, strong, virile energy from Terra, the world to which all worlds will look. However, this opportunity will definitely not come from the Terran Exploitations Company. The Company is quite transparently evil–if its name didn’t tip you off, they press-gang starfarers for their mining crews, hunting them down through the native quarter with Venusian anthropoids and enforcer thugs. Although there is a political organization of civilized Martians and Terrans trying to expose and defang the Company, their efforts are weak because (frankly) they aren’t our protagonists, which I think is kind of a raw deal for the cool, lawfare-minded Hugh St. John the utterly ruthless Eran Mak. And although there are still many on Mars who swear allegiance to their rightful king, and though they serve him with their strength and their whole loyalty, well, they aren’t the heroes either and thus are doomed to fail.\n\nWhich makes it a dicey proposition for absolutely everyone when a half-crazed old seeress foretells Richard Gunn Urquhart’s shadow over Mars. Rick, though, Rick isn’t really a hero….\n\nAs mentioned, plotting is the weak point of this novel(la). Its short length necessitates a level of time compression that doesn’t really help to strengthen the idea that either the villains or the hero/protagonists are particularly smart or good at planning, and there’s a weakness to the parts that don’t involve headlong action which could have been helped with a critical eye and a rewrite. The majority of Rick’s grand plan (one which, we are assured, no one else could have pulled off) is….rile everybody up with a couple of speeches and throw them at the Company headquarters. (But he keeps this plan secret in case they’re being spied on.)\n\nAnd–as I complained about before–both Rick and the author don’t really take any efforts to provide any clever twists, outwit or surprise their opponent or the audience. Rick’s best effort out outthinking Jaffa Storm is “crash a spaceship into the fort;” and the last-minute, last-gasp twist by Brackett is that Rick (wait for it) left-handed, which allows him to take the mind-reading Storm by surprise even though Storm is currently reading Rick’s mind. (I, having not read the book in several years, was expecting there to be some sort of automatic defense field over the Thinkers’ coffins, which Rick could take advantage of.) Unfortunately for Jaffa Storm, he is not left-handed, and thus falls Storm. Again, I think this is just because the brevity of the story doesn’t allow for any of the cat-and-mouse moves that would make a more satisfying plot.\n\nNevertheless. This one is still well worth reading simply because it’s by a Grandmaster of the field who was just coming into her own. Brackett’s Old Mars is there, and lacking her later elegaic* sensibilities, while it is a place old beyond time and full of dust, sins, and shadows, it is also a place where there is life that is young and eager to live.–if it can only find a clear way out. Her secondary characters absolutely steal the show–from the fighting man Beudach, a wolf to men but a dog to his king, who locks the Iron Collar on Rick and pledges him to the future of Mars, and the cold, cunning Eran Mak, who melts it to get it off Rick again–and then there’s the young king Haral himself, who despite his limited pagetime is a leader of men and his people, worthy of the loyalty he is given, undeserving of the death he gains.\n\nJaffa Storm is an interesting antagonist because of the lengths Brackett goes to show that he in fact outmatches Rick in almost every way. He’s bigger than Rick, stronger than him, a better fighter than him, smarter than him (although not smart enough to not monologue.) He’ll throw a trapped man a pack of cigarettes and give him enough time for a last smoke before lighting up the tunnel with a Banning shocker. And he’ll work for someone else only so long as he knows they’re stronger than him. He and Rick have developed quite strong personal reasons for hating each other by the end of the book, and their initial physical confrontation (which Rick loses) is savagely fought and written.\n\nSo it’s quite disappointing, to me, that Rick wins mostly by luck and the author’s intervention, rather than a) skill, b) intelligence, c) overloading Storm’s mind-reading with raw fury and going berserk, but, ah well.\n\nOverall, highly enjoyable, highly recommended.\n\nRated: The wind is rising–\n\nSo in the interests of rendering my office workdesk (AKA the kitchen table) actually usable as either a desk or, y’know, a table, I was doing some clearing up. Still not sure what to do with the pile of hats, but mostly I removed the 23 (I counted) random books which were, uh, accumulated there.\n\nNaturally this meant that four more random books ended up there, but they will soon be making the long, one-way journey to the library donation pile, so here’s to them:\n\n– Exiles of the Stars – Slightly later-stage Andre Norton bravely smushes one short story’s worth of plot and effects into a 200+page novel. It doesn’t really work at any level, and the shock and awe of the alien body-swapping twist is negated by the fact that the two main lead characters are….body swapped. Even more so when one of them–a humanoid female–has previously been swapped to the body of a furry, catlike thing, and a conveniently empty humanoid female body turns up. I didn’t DNF it, but I did skip enormous chunks.\n\n– The Metal Monsters – A. Merritt – This book starts off promisingly enough, in a vein we’ve seen Talbot Mundy, Robert E. Howard, and Doc Savage’s whats-his-face display: with an intrepid scientist narrator off somewhere in the exotic Oriental wilds, bumping into a) a rugged heroic type, b) a love-interest type along with her brother (what exactly Love Interest Girl is doing in the Exotic Oriental Wilds, I never found out); and then encountering A Mystery.–what are the strange, armored men who are lurking about, doing, and why do they speak Ancient Persian? So far so good (we’re about ten pages in, featuring quite a lot of unnecessarily florid descriptions but still moving briskly along.) Aaaaand then at about the thirty-page mark (and trust me, it worked hard enough to get to there) everything starts moving with absolutely glacial, grinding, brutal, torpid slowness and I’m pretty sure nothing else whatsoever happens in the entire rest of the novel, but I’m not going to try and find out.\n\n[WHAT THE FUCK IS WORDPRESS’S PROBLEM NOW? It keeps jumping my text line to the bottom of the screen if I press the back key and refusing to let me scroll down. OH OK AND IT ALSO jumps the text to the TOP of the screen if I press the up key. GOD this website is annoying. Keep it up and I’ll move to X so help me.]\n\n– Hag’s Nook – John Dickson Carr – Sometimes old pulp noir stories are unfairly forgotten. Sometimes they aren’t.\n\n– The Chaos Weapon – Colin Kapp is the author of the similarly named but apparently completely distinct novel Patterns of Chaos. PoC is a mediocre to middling SF novel redeemed by the fact that I really like amnesia plots, and this one includes a twist the likes of which I have seen no where else in SF or F (and which I mean to steal/emulate one of these days). Anyhow, on the strength of that association, I purchased The Chaos Weapon some while ago. Unfortunately, it’s nowhere as good, and it’s nowhere redeemed by any similar flash of brilliance. In fact, although it does have a grand reveal, the reveal…has zero consequence and in fact provides source of further criticism. (I.e., “so what if they are those Nephilim….this has zero cultural relevance and they are in fact MORONS, so what did that actually do?”) Furthermore, it relies heavily on the particularly despicable plot/trope of making its plot progress from easily-avoidable pitfall to easily-avoidable pitfall into which the heroes directly blunder into because they (although supposedly competent agents / rangers / starfarers) are idiots. Not a recommend.\n\n(But Patterns of Chaos is.)\n\nYeah, that’s a reasonable approximation of Space Marshal Jym Wildheit and the telepathic heroine….not pictured: egg on their faces.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent first draft of what would have been a rippin’ good scifi yarn if it had, y’know, actually had a second draft and some serious critical revision before it was published. It’s not quite a failure-its pulp-SF roots are too sturdy and its outline is, after all, tried and true (“man saves the day by solving A Problem”, done in the Dickensian fashion where 90% of that problem is “Understanding Myself”)–but it’s still not quite a success.\n\nThe plot is simple, despite dollops of philosophical and quasi-scientific musings: Johnny Joya, leader of the 3rd-generation of Sea People, comes out of retirement to fulfill his office at a dangerous fork in the crossroads of time. One way leads to the destruction of life on Earth. One way leads to the stars. Naturally, per ardua ad astra; and thus relations between Sea and Land have deteriorated to the point of hunting for sport and Mutually Assured Destruction by way of bioweapons and continent-killing nukes buried at the Ring of Fire Mohorovic Discontinuity. (C.f. The Eve of RUMOKO.) The Land People are corrupt–leadership-wise–and culturally and evolutionarily stagnant. The Sea People are stunted and restrained. And, Johnny Joya realizes abruptly (around the time the plot arrives at his polar hideaway), someone among the various players in this game has already pushed the Armageddon button….\n\n…the question is: who?\n\nWell, actually, the question is: what do the Space Swimmers have to do with all this, because it doesn’t seem like a lot, really.\n\nOr does it? Johnny Joya entered exile to protect his now-10 year old son. Tomi Joya is 4th-gen: the first to develop the instinctive extra-sensory perceptions all Sea People have into….something more, something that allows him to communicate with life of other species–to sympathize and identify with them totally, and gain their trust and help. OK, so the kid can talk to the Space Swimmers. But even if they know the answers–what makes you think that they would give them to children like–\n\n–us?\n\nSo.\n\nThis novel is interesting, evocative, imaginative, and also highly uneven. Some characters–Johnny and Tomi mostly–are well-fleshed out, but almost no one else is: not the Landsman scientist Leif (who unfortunately mostly remains Exposition Man), and not–sadly and vitally–the villains. Not having particularly well-portrayed villains is a distinct theme with Dickson, it is true; but in this book he also compounds the weakness by a) making a theme of their power over society and the resulting weakness and decay of said society, b) not actually showing the decay. And Dickson is fully capable of doing so. Sleepwalker’s World, disappointing as that novel was, drew a haunting picture of a planet in complete, somnolent collapse; whereas I’m not even sure what flavor of -punk dystopia this particular Earth is.\n\nOh, and: c) just purely not giving them enough screentime at all. There are two main antagonists in this novel, but they operate in similar (heavy-handed and antagonistic) ways, and since neither of them has a very defined ultimate goal beyond “Landsman; selfish, power-hungry,” it’s hard to tell them apart, and also hard to tell what they want and why–and why it’s a bad thing. Which is important when you’re framing your novel as “philosophical examination of the human condition + IN SPACE!” rather than, “hey I just had an neat idea about, get this, why don’t we evolve people who can SWIM IN SPACE, isn’t that neat? And so there are these bad guys who want to stop them so–“\n\nThe parts which work best are the fast-moving, pulpy, men-of-action-and-daring bits. The (shall we say science fictional) musings on evolutionary theory, duty, society, maturity, etc, are interwoven quite tightly–but I say that the whole thing needed to still be reworked once or twice more to make the garment fit. Clarifying the theme, simplifying and focusing the plot, and using plot and theme together to showcase the hero’s victorious habits and the villains’ lack of the same–would have helped.\n\nJohnny Joya is a strong enough character that I bought his storyline and its conclusion: that his parenthood gave him the understanding and the maturity to break through to the Swimmers and access their insight. I’m just….not sold on how that means the Council of Barons is going to be similarly impressed and also agree to a total societal overhaul in accordance to what is in effect an interesting perspective to bring up in an argument about Kids These Days.–or how this societal Sea (ahaha) change is to be effected, anyway.\n\nA slight change in theme: making it more about parenthood/fatherhood, showing the transfer of knowledge, personality, and mores from the older generation to the newer one and the satisfaction of seeing those things implemented with new strength and ideas–and drawing a contrast between the virility of the Sea People and the aging, childless Barons whose only ability to preserve their ideas or personalities is through their iron–but failing–grasp on society’s reins is, I think, a simpler but better expression of what Dickson was going for.\n\nThis is a lot of criticism, but, being said, is this a hit or a miss?\n\nI’d rate it 3/5: it’s solid enough where it matters, and it’s flights of navel-gazing are completely, if imperfectly, justified in-universe. The characters who are well-drawn are clean-cut heroes (even the love interest is solidly, if lightly, sketched), and if they’re slightly larger than life, it’s because they deal with problems that require greatness to solve. The themes are interesting, even if the solutions are unconvincing.\n\nAnd who, just who, doesn’t want a companion dolphin or killer whale?\n\nRated: The beaches of Lukannon shall know their sons no more!\n\nAlso rated: Ohhhhh it’s book 2, that does explain some of it. Oh well.\n\nSo throughout the existence of the science fiction genre, it’s been a maxim that the future contains present-day technology, or something that’s a little more advanced. In the 50s, spaceships were guided by windable tapes and refuelled by pipelines; expeditions were heropowered the men were dangerous and capable; fisticuffs, trebuchets and fire were just as prominently featured and expected as slide rules and bombs. Nowadays, everything is done via the internet (in this universe, “the feed”) and satellite, neural linkages and computers. Expeditions aren’t done by drone and remote, and the protagonists (male, female, or android) spend chunks of their time passed out and being rescued.\n\nI prefer the old stuff, because it isn’t a thinly thought-out extrapolation of current day technology applied to the distant future in spite of the fact that a) distant futures don’t really exist, b) the odds of technology in the distant future closely resembling present-day technology is nil. Even if Classic Era SF is, well, a thinly thought-out extrapolation of past-day technology applied to the future, it’s still a product of a different world, and it describes a different world, and it thinks different thoughts and dreams different dreams. In short, what I want in my escapist fiction: a different world, not this one slightly expanded.\n\nThat being said, The Murderbot Diaries are quite entertaining and after reading Network Effect I backtracked and downloaded All Systems Red, the first (?) novella in the series.\n\nOur hero, Murderbot in his private thoughts alone, is a security android who has hacked his governor module and is a free agent. He’s still pretending to be a mindless puppet, however, since he doesn’t want to be disassembled for parts. His job is protecting a group of humans who are surveying a newly optioned planet, seemingly only against aggressive unknown fauna but soon enough (naturally enough) also against the other survey groups on the world, who want its resources for themselves and are willing to let nothing like a little murder stand in their way. Even worse, some of the humans are trying to talk to him about his feelings…\n\nThis novella is: good. It’s not great–Murderbot, whose first-person POV we follow, is a strong enough character to carry the story. Murderbot is competent, solves problems, shoots aggressive fauna, fights bad guys, saves humans, and saves the day, while discussing it all in a snarkily detatched narrative voice and wishing he could just watch trashy soap operas instead. Unfortunately, the human cast of characters is too large to be similarly differentiated, and remain mostly only notable due to their distinctive names; a short infodump by Murderbot explaining that there are several couples, one potential couple, one quiet guy, etc., and that he likes this group because they are all nice people, falls flat. (Admittedly, giving everyone a distinctive name is a good trick, though.) Dr. Mensah, the expedition leader, and Gurathin (the quiet guy) are the only ones who do stand out, mostly because Dr. Mensah has the characterization of “leader” and Gurathin “the quiet one.” Focusing on a smaller cast (or leaving everyone extraneous behind at the base) would have helped.\n\nAnd–it needs to be said–for a story focused on a cyborg/android Murderbot with built-in energy weapons in each arm, a “large projectile weapon” and armor….the fight scenes are abrupt and moderately uninspired. Worse–and this something that annoyed me immediately–said armor is utterly useless. I mean, if your security unit is losing 20% of its bodymass while armored and fighting something equipped only with teeth and/or cilia, you are doing things entirely wrong in your story and in your universe. Nevertheless.\n\n(And Murderbot does spend a large chunk of its time passing out because it’s armor is useless and it ends up being perforated during the fight scenes. But on reflection, this is something that happens to heroes in general and so can’t really be complained about too much.)\n\nAll Systems Red isn’t half-bad scifi; not that I plan to read it again, but I do plan to read the rest of the series.\n\nRated: All systems….yellow.\n\nBack in the day when the scifi community handed out awards they meant something (for instance, the competition that Lord of Light beat out in the 1967 Hugos running was Dune, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, and Skylark Duquesne, oh and might I mention And Call Me Conrad —Zelazny was competing against himself), this won many of them.\n\nIt’s also really, really good.\n\nThe plot is simple: on a distant planet, the technologically-advanced members of the original crew and their favored descendants have set themselves up as the gods of the Hindu pantheon, using both technology and their personally-developed psychic powers to support this pose. All other technology–and technological progress itself–on that world is harshly suppressed. Against this, one day, the one called Mahasamatman (he prefers Sam) comes to re-invent the saffron robe and the teachings of the Enlightened One as one weapon among many that he raises against the gods…\n\n…and there are many other weapons, and many battles, betrayals, alliances, dalliances, schemes and strategems. Not easily will the gates of Heaven be broken, even by the great-souled Sam.\n\nAnd despite the story being told in one of those artistically anachronic ways that Zelazny seemed to be fond of, that’s it. It’s a straightforward tale of a man who has a goal and sets out to accomplish it. That the goal is the death of the gods–his peers, friends, and lovers of old–and that needless to say they do not tamely accept this goal, makes it more compelling, but that’s still basically it. Or is it?\n\nWhat else gives this story its strength, then? The characters? Yes.\n\nThat’s almost all I’m going to say: yes. Read for yourself of Candi the Fierce, of Tak of the Bright Spear, of Lord Kubera the Fat and of Agni, Brahma (once nee Madeline), of Nirriti and Yama, and Ratri, and Rild.\n\nThe other factor is of course Zelazny’s unmatched wordsmithing. Chunks of this book read with the vivid flow of (quality) poetry, and I only just noticed that he also casually drops allusions and lines of known poems in the flow of the prose (although these, though absolutely played straight in-story get fairly punny as well: cf “the Vasty Hall of Death, i.e., Yama’s workshop and laboratory. It gets referred to that once, in which case it seems like a reference the character is making….until it turns out that it is in fact the formal name of the place. Pwah).\n\nBut back to the characters: by the end of the story each of these, well, at least each of these that are still alive, are drawn so well to the mind’s eye that Zelazny doesn’t even need to flourish his pen. The most heart-wrending scene in the book (IMO) is written almost entirely through blank dialogue–and by the time you get to “Help me, Kubera.” you do not at all need any additional exposition to hear emotion in Yama’s voice.\n\nNot bad for a book written specifically for the sake of a pun, huh.\n\n(I’m out of time.)\n\nRated: The Lokapalas are never defeated."
