It is concerned with the mystery of the universe, man’s place in it, and man’s ultimate destiny: the continuation of humankind in its basic nature and humanity. Science fiction expresses faith in human ingenuity, human intelligence, and the human spirit. Technology is considered in terms of service to mankind and the natural world. The biological sciences are considered as they might heighten or increase the capacity and quality of the human mind. Religion is viewed as a means of salvation. The end is to augment the quality of life. Science fiction has been labeled a fiction of questions: What if . . . ? If only . . . ? If this goes on . . .\n\nSo stated the late Betty Rosenberg in her first edition of Genreflecting, published nearly two decades ago. Some might challenge specific points of this description, but the essence of Rosenberg’s comments remains true. Science fiction could certainly be described as the literature of “what if?” What if there were life on other planets? What if someone were to travel faster than light? What if there were people who lived inside a world rather than on its surface? What if all the men on a planet were to die off? What if one could enter a world created by a computer program? What if . . . ? The possibilities of science fiction are as endless as the human imagination. Indeed, it is a literature of possibilities. But what really is science fiction? What or who defines it, and what factors help determine whether a particular title is labeled “science fiction”? Is SF merely a marketing device of the publishing industry? Do SF writers determine what the genre encompasses? Or is it ultimately up to readers and fans? Perhaps it is not really a genre at all. Certainly a case could be made for each of these possibilities. But our purpose here is one of practicality. So, rather than entering the philosophical and scholarly debate about what defines SF, let’s try to achieve a general understanding of the genre and its readers. Science fiction is a thoroughly discussed and highly analyzed genre, and definitions abound. Stanley Schmidt, the editor of Analog, defines science fiction stories as those “in which some aspect of future science or technology is so integral to the plot that, if that aspect were removed, the story would collapse.” And John Clute, in Science Fiction: The Illustrated Encyclopedia (DK Publishing, 1995), says that SF (the accepted acronym for the genre) “is any story that argues the case for a changed world that has not yet come into being. SF is about worlds. . . and is a literature of possible world-changes, however unlikely they may appear; possible continuations of history over the sand-reefs of the Millennium, into brave new centuries.” In the essay “On Science and Science Fiction” in The Ascent of\n\nNE\n\nxii Introduction\n\nWonder: The Evolution of Hard SF (Tor, 1994), Kathryn Cramer explains that “SF allows us to understand and experience our past, present, and future in terms of an imagined future.” Peter Nichols, in his article on the history of SF in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, elaborates: “SF proper requires a consciousness of the scientific outlook, and it probably also requires a sense of the possibilities of change.” A broader and simpler definition can be found in Webster’s Dictionary, which states that science fiction is “fiction dealing principally with the impact of actual or imagined science on a society or individuals or having a scientific factor as an essential component” (Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, 10th ed., 1994). In this genre just about anything can happen—as long as science or technology rather than magic or the fantastic is involved. In science fiction we can fly on the backs of fire-breathing dragons—but only if they are genetically created. This is the genre that explores the inner space of psi powers and such superhuman abilities as mental telepathy, teleportation, and telekinesis; it also explores the outer space of other planets and other galaxies, taking the reader to the far reaches of the imagination. Science fiction takes us backward and forward in time as well as across barriers between our world and alternate worlds. It investigates the world of computers from the outside—through the programs that are created, through the activities of hackers, and through the consequences of our dependence on them—and from the inside, where virtual reality experiences may become all-too-frighteningly real. Science fiction can be optimistic, depicting utopia and irresistible realms of wonder, or it can be pessimistic, drawing us into dire worlds of social and ecological disaster. In science fiction stories BEMs, or bug-eyed monsters (the term applied to aliens in the early days of science fiction) may loom threateningly on the horizon, or aliens might travel to Earth on a mission of hope. Then again, extraterrestrials may come and treat humankind with much the same regard as uncaring gods. First contact can bring us infinite rewards or the horrors of invasion and destruction (if there’s anything left after what we do to ourselves and our ecosystem). In terms of content, science fiction can be “hard”—probing the ramifications of scientific theories and practical applications of quantum physics, bioengineering, or mathematics, or it can be “soft”—concentrating on psychology and social sciences and exploring relationships, the underpinnings of society, or even what it means to be human. The characters, settings, and topics covered in science fiction are equally diverse. Stories may focus on a human hero or on a race of extraterrestrial creatures. Some stories are set in a near future, with highly plausible scenarios. Others are set so far in the future or in the past that they seem well-nigh impossible. Romance, mystery, war, plagues, robots, ecology—all provide springboards into the worlds of science fiction. Some claim that science fiction is merely a subgenre of fantasy fiction. It is not our intention to argue the finer and philosophical points of the definition or to defend our treatment of SF as a genre. The purpose of this work is practical, and in terms of practicability, a separate treatment is warranted for readers’ advisors. After all, taken to the extreme, one could argue that all fiction is fantasy. For the purposes of this guide, we adhere to Clute’s definition of science fiction, but we exclude the closely allied genres of straight fantasy and horror. It is important to note that these three genres are often grouped together as “literature of the imagination,” “literature of the strange,” “speculative fiction,” or “fantastic literature.” Indeed, many authors write across these genres, and it is frequently difficult to pigeonhole a title into one of the genres. Often a specific title fits just as well in horror as it\n\nWhy This Book? xiii\n\ndoes in science fiction, and often a novel will incorporate aspects of horror or fantasy into the science fiction milieu. Then again, to readers not sophisticated in the realms of science and technology, science may seem like magic. The ability to construct a computer from scratch can appear as mysterious and unlikely as the ability to transmute lead into gold. Another reason that SF, fantasy, and horror are so closely entwined is that organizations, journals, publishers, award committees, and even bookstores treat them as a cohesive group. For example, Locus magazine, “the newspaper of the science fiction field” covers all three genres; the Nebula award for best novel has been bestowed on books in all three genres; and bookstores often shelve SF and fantasy together. Science fiction, a combination of science and fiction, can be seen as a marriage between knowledge and the imagination. The progenies of this union are seemingly endless— even without its companion genres of horror and fantasy. This book seeks to examine a number of the diverse titles contained within the parameters of the genre.\n\nWhy This Book? As stated, science fiction is a much-discussed and highly analyzed genre. There are numerous guides to science fiction, including print journals, online resources, databases, encyclopedias, and bibliographies. Many of these guides are thoroughly researched and informative. Some of the resources that are more helpful to readers’ advisors are listed in Chapter 8, “Resources for Librarians and Readers.” These guides go into great depth on the history and evolution of the genre, categorizing titles into a multitude of subjects and types and discussing the literary abilities and accomplishments of particular SF authors. But in terms of finding an enjoyable book for a specific reading taste, these guides fall short. They fall short because they are not organized in a way that reflects or caters to reader interests. This volume endeavors to fill that need. Its purpose is to put readers together with the books they want to read. It seeks to map the genre, grouping titles with similar qualities and appeal together so that readers (and those who advise readers) can easily locate books that are similar to others they have enjoyed. Thus, readers’ advisors in libraries and bookstores can respond appropriately to the ubiquitous “what do you have that’s similar to . . . ?” The arrangement helps the reader to find a starting place, and the annotations and icons help the user zero in on particular books. Because of the organization of titles and the detailed indexes, this book may also be useful with readers who recall a single element of a book—e.g., a character type or “what it was about”—but not other details. Collection development specialists will find this approach helpful in ensuring breadth of coverage and locating important authors and their works. Those who are developing curriculum for science fiction literature classes may wish to refer to the guide for similar reasons. Finally, the book can be used by individuals who want to build their knowledge of the genre by sampling diverse titles. Thus, readers’ advisory librarians, booksellers, collection development librarians, teachers, students, and science fiction aficionados will all hopefully find something of value in this resource. The more than 900 titles described in this guide span the entire history of the genre—from Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s 1818 Frankenstein to Lois McMaster Bujold’s Diplomatic Immunity published in 2002. Our focus is on books that are currently in print or likely to be in library collections. The majority of the titles have been published in the past\n\nxiv Introduction\n\nten years, but popular older and classic works are also included. Publication dates listed with the titles are the dates of first publication. Because so many titles are re-issued in different formats and at different times, it should not be assumed that an older publication date indicates that a book is no longer available for purchase. (Nor should it be assumed that older titles are no longer of interest to SF readers.) In determining which titles to cover, we consulted a number of library catalogs. Several were examined in detail, including Princeton Public Library, Albuquerque Public Library, San Antonio Public Library, and Prospector: The Colorado Unified Catalog. We also based our selections on our experiences as frontline readers’ advisors and devoted SF fans.\n\nOrganization It is, perhaps, ironic that the genre of science fiction eludes scientific classification and that, unlike other genres, science fiction does not easily fall into neat subgenres, each appealing to a particular subset of readers. True, a good deal of classic science fiction has grown out of the heroic adventure tradition, and much of science fiction today can be cast as variations on the adventure story. However, the development of the genre over time has resulted in so many variations that appeal to such a diversity of readers that for readers’ advisors, other approaches and access points are necessary. Many readers are enticed by the adventurous aspects of science fiction—compelling stories with a fast pace and thrilling action—while others revel in situations and solutions, or scientific and technological possibilities. Some readers are enthralled by interactions between people, whether human or extraterrestrial. The conundrums posed by changing events through traveling in time or the “what ifs?” had historical events occurred differently are the unifying theme that others look for in SF. This guide begins with a chapter based on the popular SF subgenre “Action Adventure.” In this chapter you’ll find the important sub-subgenre “space opera,” as well as a number of type-, motif-, or theme-based sections, and finally a section on the SF format “shared worlds.” From there we move into chapters based on other important types and themes for readers: technology, strange worlds, and “Us and Them” (Chapters 2 through 4). We have included Chapter 5 on “Genreblending,” which covers SF titles with strong elements of other genres: romance, mystery, fantasy, horror, and so forth. We have also created a chapter (Chapter 7) that focuses on formats (short stories), and still another (Chapter 6) that highlights titles for a specific audience (young adults). These chapters reflect groups of readers and their preferences, and they group titles together in ways that readers most often approach the literature. We have placed titles according to what we have determined to be their dominant features. Naturally, many SF titles fit into more than one of these overlapping categories. Therefore they are cross-referenced, and users should also consult the indexes to locate specific titles and authors. Of course, as each reader is an individual, not all groupings will work equally well for all readers, but we believe most science fiction fans will find appealing categories and groups of titles specific to their tastes. Some categories of science fiction, such as hard science fiction or cyberpunk, do not appear as entire chapters, but can be accessed through the keyword tagging or the subject index.\n\nWho Is the Science Fiction Reader? xv\n\nTo further inform readers and readers’ advisors, we have given brief annotations for most titles. In addition, we have created icons that identify important features of the books—e.g., classics, titles made into movies, award winners, and various other themes and qualities. The purpose of the icons is to give users “at-a-glance” information about the titles. The icons are as follows: = Award winner = Classic = Film = Young adult The appendixes list award winners as well as a compilation of generally recognized “best of” titles. Further access is provided through author/title and subject indexes. It is always important for readers’ advisors to listen to their readers, ask questions, and familiarize themselves with the literature. In the case of science fiction, this point cannot be stressed enough. Because of its thematic approach, we strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with this book’s various themes, types, and organizational components. We also suggest that you read a sampling of SF titles from diverse categories. One way to accomplish this is by reading anthologies or short stories from collections. (Refer to Chapter 7 for short story collections.) It is also important for readers’ advisors, in particular, to customize their services to individual reading tastes. To successfully accomplish this, it is important to get to know the reader.\n\nWho Is the Science Fiction Reader?\n\nFiction Reader?\n\nThe stereotype of the SF reader is a brainy but nerdish young male. In reality, today’s SF readers (like today’s SF writers) can be either gender or any age. A readers’ advisor is just as likely to work with a grandmother who reads (or writes) SF as with an SF reader who is the president of the local high school computer club. All it takes to enjoy reading science fiction is an ability and willingness to suspend disbelief and a questioning mind. From our experience in working with readers, we might say that most science fiction readers are intelligent and informed. We can also say that like romance readers, they tend to fall into two camps: purists who are experts in the genre and general readers who welcome advice. Through purists, the readers’ advisor can often discover new authors and titles, since this type of reader tends to be very knowledgeable about the genre and will often readily provide a wealth of information. Although unlikely to seek assistance in selecting books, purists will often place reserves on new titles or place interlibrary loan requests. They will notice and may comment on gaps in the collection. They are usually best served by passive readers’ advisory resources, including book displays and bibliographies. On the other hand, the general reader who enjoys science fiction will usually benefit more from interaction with a readers’ advisor. Some SF readers latch onto a single author and wish to read every book written by that person. Others may resonate with particular characters, worlds, or themes. Science fiction readers generally thrive on sequels, trilogies, and series, a fact that is reflected in SF publishing. And it is important to note that although SF generally\n\nxvi Introduction\n\nfocuses on the future, its readers treasure the history of the genre. So it should not be assumed that older titles are passé. Readers’ advisory is more of an art than a science. It is possibly the best way librarians can cement the importance of libraries in the hearts of taxpayers and the community served by the library. For decades readers’ advisory has taken a back seat in the realm of library services, but in the twenty-first century it is moving into the forefront. Several library schools have added coursework, and many consortia and library organizations have featured workshops and programs on the topic. Joyce Saricks and Nancy Brown’s Readers’ Advisory in the Public Library (American Library Association, 1997), now in its second edition, should be required reading for all readers’ advisors. The Readers’ Advisor’s Companion (Libraries Unlimited, 2002), edited by Kenneth Shearer and Robert Burgin, features sixteen timely and insightful articles on the subject by leaders in the field. Kenneth Shearer also edited Guiding the Reader to the Next Book (Neal-Schuman, 1996), which offers a wealth of information on the topic. Duncan Smith, the creator of NoveList, is another active advocate who gives readers’ advisory workshops and training nationwide. One thing all these experts agree upon is the importance of listening to the reader and familiarizing yourself with the literature.\n\nA Brief History of Science Fiction\n\nScience Fiction\n\nScience fiction has been the subject of many scholarly studies. Many of the critical works delve into the history of the genre. John Clute’s Science Fiction: The Illustrated Encyclopedia (DK Publishing, 1995) depicts the history of science fiction in relation to the surrounding world situation. The decade-by-decade charts relate important events in science fiction, film, radio, television, magazines, and world events, making it one of the most accessible historical treatments available. In Chapter 8 of this book you will find a list of some of the more important and useful titles for learning about the history of SF. Although this guide in no way intends to serve as a history of science fiction, the origins and evolution of the genre do shed some light on its appeal and readership. The brief summary that follows is an encapsulated history; its purpose is to give readers’ advisors a glimpse of the origins and development of the genre. Although there were precursors of science fiction in the eighteenth century and even earlier, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley has been identified by many as “the mother of science fiction” for her creation of Frankenstein, written when she was still in her teens and published in 1818. Later in the nineteenth century, other pioneering works were written by Edgar Allan Poe, Jules Verne, and H. G. Wells, although at the time they were not called “science fiction.” Some historians draw a connection between the birth of SF and the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Certainly scientific breakthroughs in transportation, weaponry, and factory production inspired many of the early SF writers. Darwin’s theory of evolution and social revolutions also informed early works. In the early part of the twentieth century, popular magazines featured serialized SF novels and short stories, and science fiction became a mainstay, although the term was still not widely used. Most early science fiction focused on the mechanical and on how machines would change the world. Technology was the essence, with characterization and plot taking a back seat. This was the era that brought the works of Stapledon, van Vogt, and Williamson to popularity. It was also the time when the early works of Heinlein, Asimov, and Clarke were published.\n\nA Brief History of Science Fiction xvii\n\nIn the 1950s, as space exploration began and people began to wonder who was “out there,” an interest in alien contact developed. This gave rise to the now mostly forgotten BEM (bug-eyed monster) stories that appeared regularly in the magazines of the era. In the 1960s science fiction began to delve into non-mechanical sciences, and many of the novels written in that era dealt with psychology, sociology, and how humans relate to their world and to change, heralding what was called a “New Wave” of science fiction. Philip K. Dick, Brian Aldiss, Frank Herbert, Samuel R. Delaney, and Kate Wilhelm made their mark. The women’s movement heralded the entry of females into SF’s ranks, both as writers and as strong characters. Joanna Russ, Anne McCaffrey, and Ursula K. Le Guin did not have to hide behind the pseudonyms, androgynous names, or initials that disguised the gender of earlier women writers. Along with the rise of female authors, female and ethnically diverse protagonists began to be more prominently featured in 1970s SF. Gay, lesbian, physically disabled, and senior heroes have also appeared. But then, so have beings that change their sex entirely. The tremendous wave of popularity of science fiction’s sister genre, fantasy, in the 1970s was reflected in SF with a number of epic tales set in such a distant time or place that Earth was all but forgotten and abilities forged by science in a distant past acquired seemingly magical attributes. C. J. Cherryh, Alan Dean Foster, Octavia E. Butler, and John Varley rose to popularity. Cyberpunk, in which technology was portrayed as being perhaps not all that it had been cracked up to be, began to appear in the 1980s. William Gibson was probably the best known of the cyberpunk authors, but Bruce Sterling emerged as the spokesman for the subgenre. In the 1990s scientific advances in nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and bioengineering became a visible force in the field. Authors such as Greg Bear, Nancy Kress, Kathleen Ann Goonan, Neal Stephenson, and Kim Stanley Robinson were writing on these topics. It is hard to predict the trends that will prevail in the current decade. Ventus, by Karl Schroeder, continues exploring the nanotechnology and artificial intelligence popular at the end of the 1990s. Wheelers, by Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen, introduces aliens so different that they never conceived the idea that life could evolve on a planet as obviously inimical to it as Earth. Authors to watch include Nalo Hopkinson, Jack McDevitt, Catherine Asaro, and Robert J. Sawyer. It is interesting to note that SF was one of the first genres to spawn a devoted and organized fan presence. One might even go so far as to say that there is a SF subculture. Fans attend conventions, publish newsletters, and even write stories set in worlds created by favorite authors. (Sharyn McCrumb portrays the world of SF fandom in two wry tongue-in-cheek mysteries, Bimbos of the Death Sun and Zombies of the Gene Pool.) Contemporary fandom is an obvious presence on the World Wide Web, with newsgroups such as rec.arts.sfwritten providing a busy forum for fans, authors, editors, and publishers to discuss the genre on a daily basis. Science fiction fans read SF magazines and watch SF on television and at the movies. In fact, throughout its history, science fiction has remained as inextricably rooted in popular culture and mass media as it is in scientific development. The immense popularity of SF films (e.g., Star Wars, E.T., Jurassic Park) is matched by the devotion of thousands of “trekkies” or “trekkers” to the television Star Trek series in all of its iterations. Science fiction remains popular today—not only in the thousands of novels published annually but also in comics, graphic novels, games, television, and film. Readers of the\n\nxviii Introduction\n\ngenre seem to welcome new technologies, a fact that is now boosting audio book and e-book sales. In whatever shape or form it will take, it seems that SF is a genre that is here to stay.\n\nA Word About Diversity in SF\n\nersity in SF\n\nIn the world of science fiction, the term diversity takes on new dimensions. The major divisions between humans and alien life forms render insignificant such minor differences as skin color. Planet of origin becomes the point of identification, and just as people of all races came together in the United States after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, in science fiction the common bond of humanity holds people together in light of alien intrusions and interstellar explorations. We all remember the globally integrated crew of Star Trek’s U.S.S. Enterprise; that scenario captures the spirit of many SF stories. But issues of race and gender are not unknown in science fiction. Ursula K. Le Guin explored race issues (among others) in The Lathe of Heaven, and the James Tiptree Jr. Award is given to works that explore gender issues. In science fiction, only the approach to these issues is different. Problems of race, sex, physical disability, and age are approached with solutions—scientific, technological solutions. Science fiction readers are often unaware of an author’s race, ethnicity, and even gender. However, there are a number of minority authors, among them Octavia E. Butler, Stephen Barnes, Nalo Hopkinson, and Samuel L. Delany. An anthology of authors of the African diaspora, Dark Matter, edited by Sheree R. Thomas, was published in 2000.\n\nClassic Science Fiction\n\ntion\n\nMuch of science fiction’s history is distilled in the classic novels of the genre. Groundbreaking titles often invite mimicry and may even spawn whole movements or new subgenres. Within the classics, readers can also easily find “quality” or “literary” works because they are the titles that have withstood the test of time in a genre rich with memorable books. Orb and British publisher Orion have recently begun releasing classic reprints, bringing many long-out-of-print titles back into availability. Although SF usually focuses on the future, its readers prize the history of the genre, as can be seen by perusing lists of favorites like those at “The Internet Top 100 SF/Fantasy List” (http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Cavern/6113/top100.html) and the “Locus All Time Best SF Poll from 1987” (http://www.sff.net/locus/poll/list87.html#ALLT1), where decades-old and out-of-print titles still linger.

We have refrained from declaring publications of the last decade to be classics, although there are undoubtedly classics among them, because it is simply too early to tell which of the newer titles will withstand the test of time. But now let us take a closer look at the literature.\n\nChapter 1 Chapter 1—Action Adventure\n\nAction Adventure\n\nScience fiction is rooted in the traditions of the heroic adventure story, or “the hero’s journey,” and many of the early classics clearly fall within these parameters. The works of Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, and Edgar Rice Burroughs contain all the elements of a good adventure story. These are compelling tales with clearly defined conflicts between forces of good and evil. Action, usually physical and often fast-paced, must be taken to meet a challenge, overcome an obstacle, or accomplish a mission. In science fiction (SF) adventure, this action usually takes place in an alien setting or on a somehow threatening terrain. Those who dare to fight or fly are the characters who venture forth in adventure science fiction. In many of the stories, a single hero figures prominently. In others, a group of characters—a team or military contingent—may be involved. Philosophical implications and ponderings are put aside in this subgenre, and endings will likely provide tangible resolution to the conflict. Science fiction adventure is the largest and probably the most popular subgenre of SF, as demonstrated by the success of such films as Star Trek and Star Wars. In its many variations, it is also the subgenre that snares young readers, creating many lifelong fans of science fiction. Readers who enjoy adventure science fiction and want to explore other genres may also enjoy political espionage novels and techno-thrillers. This chapter begins with a list of general SF adventure stories, then covers the many titles in the ever-popular “space opera” sub-subgenre. Following that, titles are arranged thematically, according to broad areas of interest. Concluding the chapter is a list of titles that represent a distinct format, that of “shared worlds.” As all of these titles are adventures, readers who enjoy one section may also be interested in others.\n\n2 Chapter 1—Action Adventure\n\nScience Fiction Adventure Subgenres\n\nventure Subgenres\n\nGeneral Science Fiction Adventure Aldiss, Brian. Helliconia Trilogy. Life on a planet where winter lasts for centuries, a year lasts a thousand Earth years, and humanity cycles through emergence to decline, is replete with adventures. Helliconia Spring. 1982. With the end of winter, civilization reawakens on the planet Helliconia. Helliconia Summer. 1983. Because a season on Helliconia lasts approximately 200 years, so much time has passed since the events in the first book that they have become the stuff of legends, if they are remembered at all. Court intrigue, suspense, and the slow heating of the planet are the backdrop for what happens to one group of people over a period of ten years now that summer has come. Helliconia Winter. 1985. The trilogy began with everything waking up because spring had come. Now, with the approach of winter, it is time for this world to return to its somnolent state. Anthony, Piers. Killobyte. 1993.

The Postman. 1985. After surviving the wars that destroyed civilization, Gordon leaves the shattered East behind and heads West, hoping to make a new life for himself. Attacked by bandits, he flees and comes across an abandoned jeep with a dead postman in it. Relieving the skeleton of its coat, hat, and leather bag, which are still serviceable after all these years, he continues his journey through what has become a wilderness of despair. Gordon has become “The Postman” and he must ultimately live up to this legend by carrying messages between previously isolated communities and spreading hope in a Restored United States to everyone. Bujold, Lois McMaster. Falling Free. 1988. Created by Galtech to work in free fall, Quaddies, genetically altered mutants with an extra pair of arms instead of legs, are considered property of the company. After being hired to train Quaddies, Leo Graf becomes horrified at how they are mistreated and abused. Now a new Betan gravity device that allows anyone to work in space has made the Quaddies obsolete. When Leo learns the administration is deciding on the best way to get rid of the Quaddies, he realizes he is the only one who can save them. Nebula Award. Burroughs, Edgar Rice. Mars Series. A Princess of Mars. 1917. John Carter, a Confederate Army officer, suddenly finds himself transported to the red planet. There he encounters a red-skinned princess and is faced with one adventure after another involving the members of the planet’s warlike society. The man who created Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, also gave us John Carter of Mars, or in this case Barsoom, as the red planet is called. (Originally published in 1912 in All-Story Magazine with the title “Under the Moons of Mars.”) The Gods of Mars. 1918. Carter’s adventures on the red planet continued as a five-part serial in All-Story Magazine in 1913, and were eventually published in book form. The Warlord of Mars. 1919.

Doona Series. (Note: The first volume, published in 1969, was written solely by McCaffrey, and the last two were co-authored by Jody Lynn Nye.) Decision at Doona. 1969. Todd Reeve, a young boy among the human colonists on the planet Doona, discovers that the humans are not alone on the planet. The catlike Hrrubans have also settled there, and Todd becomes best friends with a young Hrruban boy, Hrriss. The problem is that Earth has passed a law forbidding all contact among alien species. One group or the other must leave the planet—or must they? Crisis on Doona. 1992. Twenty-five years ago a treaty was drawn up between the humans and the catlike Hrrubans living on the planet Doona. That treaty is now up for renewal. Unfortunately, conservative isolationists among both the humans and the Hrrubans would rather see the treaty canceled. Once again Todd Reeve and his Hrruban best friend and blood brother, Hrriss, find themselves caught in the middle of a complex conspiracy. Treaty at Doona. 1994. Nine years after the events in Crisis on Doona, Todd and Hrriss are on opposite sides of an important issue, the question of turning the Treaty Island subcontinent into a free trade and spaceport facility. In Todd’s opinion this would drastically alter the ecology of the subcontinent. But Todd’s old friend, the First Speaker of the Hrrubans, has died, and the Second Speaker seems to be more interested in economic issues than the good of the planet, a point of view that Hrriss seems to share. Into this mix comes a new alien species, the Gringgs, and once again it is the young, this time of three species, who have a lot to teach their elders. McDevitt, Jack. Moonfall. 1998.

With no way back to the future, Sam observes dinosaur behavior carefully and leaves a record, chiseled onto stone slabs, for future scientists to decipher, thereby settling some of the major controversies of modern times about dinosaur behavior and appearance.

A Civil War researcher and a young woman try to unravel the puzzle of how she seems to be living Robert E.

They feature almost everything a reader could want: action, adventure, intrigue, and romance. Although war is often an element in space operas, the emphasis is on the broader picture. They tend to be sweeping tales, involving multiple characters and locales. The prime example (both because almost everyone has seen it and because it exhibits all the classic characteristics of space opera) is the Star Wars movie series. Space opera always features a heroic individual going up against some evil or diabolical enemy. Politics almost always plays an important role. Stalwart companions and romantic liaisons are a staple. Space operas are set in a time when galactic empires spanning multiple worlds have become a reality. Although some serious SF fans turn up their noses at it, space opera is probably the most popular and widely read type of SF. Sometimes maligned as simplistic or sophomoric, it is home to many of the great adventure stories. The following titles deal adventurously with galactic empires and views of communities and worlds of humans and aliens in a variety of political and sociological relationships. Many of the shared worlds of science fiction fall into this category as well (Star Wars, for example), so for read-alikes, that category should also be checked. Other categories contain elements of space opera, so readers may also want to check the subject index for more related titles.\n\nScience Fiction Adventure Subgenres 11\n\nBanks, Iain M. Consider Phlebas. 1988. Set in his “Culture” universe, this is an account of the struggle between the artificially intelligent “Minds” that rule the universe and the alien Idirans, religious fanatics who are all too willing to fight. It is also the account of a mission to recover something that both sides of the conflict are desperate to capture. But it’s Horza and his rag-tag company who have the best chance of succeeding because they are willing to undertake an odyssey that could lead to certain death. Banks, Iain M. Inversions. 2000. This is the story of a healer whom no one trusts except her patient, and an assassin, who trusts no one except the one he shouldn’t. In a triumph of misdirection, subterfuge, and clever surprise endings, Banks gives us two stories in one. An assistant to a female doctor is writing an account of the doctor’s activities for his unknown master. And an unknown narrator relates the adventures of DeWar, bodyguard to General UrLeyn, Prime Protector of the Tassasen Protectorate, and self-proclaimed assassin’s assassin. DeWar’s tale is interwoven with that of the Protector’s favorite concubine Perrund, who saved the Protector’s life from an assassin and was left with a withered arm as a result of her heroic sacrifice. And the female doctor has won the favor of the king, scandalizing the court because she is a traveler, a foreigner from Drezen. Banks, Iain M. Look to Windward. 2001. This “Culture” novel is set 800 years after the Twin Novae battle that ended the Idiran War. Unfortunately, the war ended with exploding suns and the destruction of entire worlds.

Also on Masaq’ is an emissary from a war-ravaged world. Is he bent on assassination — or something much worse? Bradley, Marion Zimmer. Darkover.

Believing her son dead, Ermine goes to Thendara, where she is employed to work in a Tower because of her powerful mental laran. For the next twenty years she teaches Alistair to long for the day he can return to Hammerfell and avenge himself for the deaths of his father and brother.

Annotated on page 31.\n\nOther Science Fiction Adventure Themes and Types\n\non Adventure Themes and Types\n\nMilitaristic and War Stories centering on a variety of military themes—from mercenaries and war to antimilitary stories and parody—are common in science fiction. Although this type of story does not contain enough features to qualify it as a subgenre, there are many fans of books with war themes. Militaristic and war SF features military discipline, strategies, and armament, and the stories are often full of masterfully described battle scenes, fleet deployments, and the forces of right prevailing in the end. In recent years women have been just as likely as men to be featured. The adventure is there—waiting for those willing to risk it. We may face friendship, guidance, and a mentoring relationship—if and when we find that we are not alone in space. We may need to become warriors, soldiers in the fight against an alien enemy that may be the BEMs (Bug-Eyed Monsters) of the early days of science fiction,\n\nOther Science Fiction Adventure Themes and Types 21\n\narachnids like the opponents in Robert A. Heinlein’s Starship Troopers, amoeba-like aliens that torment Nicholas Seafort in David Feintuch’s multi-book Seafort Saga, or any other foe imaginable. Militaristic themes are often present in space opera, so readers of this type may also enjoy space opera. Likewise, these readers may enjoy historical and contemporary militaristic adventure. Parallels can also be drawn between the heroes of yesterday, such as C. S. Forester’s seafaring Horatio Hornblower or Bernard Cornwell’s nineteenth-century soldier Richard Sharpe, and the warriors of tomorrow who are found in militaristic SF. W. E. B. Griffith adventures featuring military exploits during World War II also have much in common with some of the SF militaristic adventures. Many of the shared world novels (e.g., Star Wars) take place on military vessels or in military settings, and readers of militaristic SF should not forget to check the section on shared worlds for more SF military adventures of a specific kind. These are just a few of the many novels that demonstrate that when battle lines are drawn and the enemy is poised to attack, we can do what we’ve done for untold generations: send in the Marines and hope that once again military expertise will save us. Anderson, Kevin J. has written several novels in the Jedi Academy series. See page 59. Asprin, Robert. Phule Series. Phule’s Company. 1990. Willard Phule, the son of a megamillionaire munitions supplier, joins the Legion after a fight with his father.

Accompanied by his ever-present butler, Beeker (the narrator of his employer’s adventures), Phule comes to the swamp planet where Omega Company is located, takes charge, and transforms this collection of misfits into a force to be reckoned with—able to hold their own even when challenged by the army’s elite Red Eagle Unit. First contact with an alien race could have been a disaster, except for Phule’s ability to turn almost anything into a financial windfall. Phule’s Paradise. 1992.

Only six years old, Andrew “Ender” Wiggins appears to offer the world its best hope to stop an invasion by the insectoid aliens called buggers.

In the null-gravity battle room (where battles are fought in special suits that freeze when hit by the light-firing guns the kids are armed with), Ender proves himself to be a genius at tactics and strategy. After graduating from Battle School to Command School at age eleven, he works and plays on what he thinks are battle simulators that adapt and change in response to everything he learns and tries. In 1978, Card wrote a short story titled “Ender’s Game.” That story was expanded into this award-winning novel in 1985. Hugo and Nebula Awards. Speaker for the Dead. 1986.

What was the secret that the xenologist Libo discovered before he too was left staked out in much the same way? Ender is called to speak Pipo’s death and gets involved in the strange ecology of the Piggies and the tragedies going on in a human family. This philosophical and lyrical work, like its predecessor, won the Hugo and the Nebula. Hugo, Nebula, and Locus Awards. Companion Novels.
