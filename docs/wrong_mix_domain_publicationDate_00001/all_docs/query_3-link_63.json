        "text": "I've seen books butchered\n\nI know that Hollywood butchers about every book they base a movie on. But I've never seen any author treated as consistently shabby as Ernest Hemingway. \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" was pretty good. But two, \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\" and \"Islands In the Stream\" had two potentially fantastic endings truncated into nothing.\n\nIn the story, Kiliimanjaro's ending is one of the most beautiful pieces of writing I've ever encountered, but in the movie when the pilot arrives to fly him out, he has a dark face and the movie ends.\n\n'Islands In the Stream\" book had what was potentially a very exciting ending with the lead character and his crew chasing survivors from a German U-boat sinking around Caribbean islands over the course of several days with one hell of a climax. The first part of the movie was GREAT and the whole thing could have been much greater. But the movie people decided to turn the chase and final battle into a five minute scene of transferring Jewish refugees to the mainland.\n\nI really feel cheated.\n\nHonorable mention - \"The Grapes of Wrath\". A well done movie but they had to make the ending upbeat because the American people required a happy ending with Ma Joad making a speech about 'they can't keep us down because \"We're the people\". The book ended with a man floating the body of a still-born baby down a flooded street into town to demonstrate the conditions that they were living under to people that had avoided much of the suffering brought about by the Depression and the Dust Bowl.\n\nI thought that they did a passible job on the first big-screen Narnia installment with The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, staying reasonably close to the original story.\n\nUnfortunately, they ran off the tracks with Prince Caspian, and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was a total train wreck. I understand \"why\" they did it, and a friend who worked on them confirmed my suspicions, but I know darned well that I could have written better screenplays. (I offered. I suspect that the 2nd Star Trek movie had been much better than the first because I had a chance to talk with the president of Paramount over dinner about the problems... )\n\nAnother friend who actually knew C.S. Lewis made the comment that he thought Lewis was probably spinning in his grave...\n\nPeter Jackson did a fairly good job with The Lord of the Rings, and I can understand leaving out Tom Bombadil for run-length problems, but I'd really hoped that this part could have been added in with the DVD/BluRay releases. However, I CAN NOT excuse leaving out \"The Scouring of the Shire\" chapter. This was a key part of the story and lesson. Filming The Hobbit would have presented a great opportunity to add it in. (And incidentally, added another major round of sales for the trilogy at relatively little expense. )\n\nThe first installment of The Hobbit was well done, even with the additional elements used to set up more conflict and battle/action scenes to meet the perceived requirements for the current viewing public. However, some of it suffered from being too drawn-out, probably to meet the new target run-time once the decision was made to turn it into a trilogy. At least the main thread of the tale stayed almost on-track.\n\nUnfortunately, the second installment wanders needlessly off the path in Mirkwood, and suffers even more from \"excessively drawn-out\" action sequences that feel like they are there for \"padding.\" Oh, the visuals are great, but they don't add to the story. I also do not care for the end credit music. It doesn't \"fit\" properly, and gives the impression that it was added late in the process with the trilogy decision.\n\nSo, now we have another long wait to see The End.\n\nLast edited by Robotech; 12-17-2013 at 04:04 AM.\n\nCompared to the books, \"John Carter of Mars\" wasn't BAD, just underfunded and DEFINITELY underpublicized.\n\nThey'd been trying to make a movie of the Burroughs' John Carter since my grandmother was a young woman (I'm 55), always without success. Max Fleischer did some interesting animated test scenes that didn't turn into anything. From then on for something like eighty years, every five years or so, somebody would look at making a movie and quit. Admittedly, they really couldn't do it in any meaningful way until CGI matured to the point that it has today.\n\nThey combined at least a couple of the books to make the movie. Instead, they should have done it as a series of movies like \"Lord of the Rings\". Peter Jackson could have made probably the best fantasy films ever produced if he'd been in charge... and had the money.\n\nThe guy who played John Carter wasn't awful, but Carter is a Virginia cavalryman. The actor who played him in the movie sounded like any Manhattan ad exec who kills his wife on \"Law & Order\". The actress who played Dejah Thoris on the other hand was amazing.\n\nThey played around with the story somewhat, but not enough to ruin it. Some of the villains turned from con men who were also getting conned, into super villains, almost like the \"Observers\" on \"Fringe\".\n\nI don't think the budget allowed you to really see Barsoom (Mars) the way you saw Middle Earth in \"Lord of the Rings\". What there was was pretty good.\n\nThey redid \"Spiderman\", \"Superman\" and \"Batman\" multiple times (the latter, actually BETTER), so I suppose there's hope...\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by BillK01\n\nI think the Game of Thrones books have been ported over to television fairly well.\n\nI agree. I started reading the books after I started to watch the series, and overall they are pretty close. Some things are left out of course, and things might night occur in exactly the right order some times, but a far closer adaptation that many.\n\nI thought 'No Country for Old Men' and 'The Road' (with one important scene omitted) were very close also. I am not sure if I am eager or afraid to see what a movie of 'Blood Meridian' would turn out like!\n\nI was profoundly disappointed to see what they did to 'World War Z'. It could have been a TV series, mini series, maybe even a couple movies. I particularly like the audiobook version of it where different actors are telling their experiences. I have not been able to bring myself to watch the movie yet.\n\nLast edited by revolvergeek; 12-17-2013 at 11:29 AM."
