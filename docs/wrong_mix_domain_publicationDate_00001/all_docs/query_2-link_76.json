        "text": "I'm about half way through the 2nd book right now. Does it get any better??\n\nIt seems somewhat boring and slow.\n\nI read the Lensman series by E.E. Doc Smith and I couldn't put it down. 1st book was kinda slow but after that it was awesome.\n\nWell, Skylark Duquesne is the next one in line. I already have all the books so I guess I might as well read them anyway.\n\ni'm kind of itching to get started on my Conan books but i hate to stop reading a series in the middle of it.\n\nThe Skylark of Valeron is actually the third book in the series.\n\n1. The Skylark of Space\n\n2. Skylark Three\n\n3. The Skylark of Valeron\n\n4. Skylark DuQuesne"
