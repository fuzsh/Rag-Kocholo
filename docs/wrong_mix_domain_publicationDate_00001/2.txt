I'm about half way through the 2nd book right now. Does it get any better??

It seems somewhat boring and slow.

I read the Lensman series by E.E. Doc Smith and I couldn't put it down. 1st book was kinda slow but after that it was awesome.

Well, Skylark Duquesne is the next one in line. I already have all the books so I guess I might as well read them anyway.

i'm kind of itching to get started on my Conan books but i hate to stop reading a series in the middle of it.

The Skylark of Valeron is actually the third book in the series.

1. The Skylark of Space

2. Skylark Three

3. The Skylark of Valeron

4. Skylark DuQuesne
