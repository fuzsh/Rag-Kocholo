        "text": "[This is the online-first version of the essay that is part of the special issue on Urban Cartographies for the journal Television and New Media, edited by Heidi Rae Cooley, Nanna Verhoeff and Heather Zwicker (forthcoming 2017)] This article analyzes the way media technologies provide interfaces for the complexity of cities as historically layered, continuously changing, and intricately connected spaces. Following Branden Hookway and Alexander Galloway, I understand media interfaces as processes rather than objects. An interface is not something; it does something. I propose to focus on the way in which often temporary, mobile, and connected interfaces produce urban cartographies in the very act and process of navigation. This navigation constitutes a performative cartography of ambulant presence, fluid connectivity, and an inherent multiplicity of connections between locations and other subjects. In what follows, I examine a small collection of urban art projects that speak to this description and suggest that the interface's pursuits of connectivity, and the stakes and claims inseparable from these pursuits, produce and structure urban cartographies. The article then questions in what ways interfaces can create, not a threshold between two dimensions, but spatial transformations of a third kind.\n\ninaugural lecture spoken on September 23, 2022 Screens on (the) Streets We encounter more and more screens and other media on the street. They address us and reflect on urban, public space and our position within it. Verhoeff introduces a conceptual framework that provides insight into how screens as media architecture both shape and set public space in motion. It also helps us to see and understand how screens as interfaces create relationships between the city and its inhabitants or visitors, and between those people themselves. By considering screens as media architectures and interfaces, we can gain insights into how they can play a productive role in processes of change within our society. Media for the open city What can screen media do for the open city? According to Verhoeff, the 'open city' is first and foremost an inclusive city that moves with, and responds to, the developments in the world. The open city is also a city full of contradictions that are part of processes of change. Screen media can both make an important contribution to the public debate about these difficult, sometimes painful processes, and help develop proposals for an inclusive city.\n\nLocative Media as \" spatial interfaces \"-Unraveling the different types of spatial awareness involved in Locative Media Locative Media can be thought of as spatial interfaces, initiating a series of interlacing spatial practices and activities that define their use as everyday media. The spatial character of Locative Media is twofold. In a more general sense, the use of any medium is essentially spatial, by virtue of being part of everyday life practices. Technological, discursive and symbolic artifacts represent and contribute to the shaping of the socio-cultural realities of individuals and communities. These everyday realities are presuppositionally and ontologically spatial (Soja, 1996: 46). In other words, the use of any medium is always situational and contextual and its meaning is contingent upon the specific space-temporal conditions in which it unfolds. In a more specific sense, Locative Media afford a series of highly spatialized activities that set them apart from other types of media. By enabling the execution of location-based activities, Locative Media create new zones of technosocial action and appropriation, each reflecting different types of spatial awareness. Below, we are proposing a taxonomy of these different, yet inextricably related and mutually defined, types of spatial awareness of Locative Media users and the spatial practices they encompass. We suggest that this taxonomy may be used as a theoretical model for different levels of research into the spatial aspect of Locative Media. In proposing this model, we subscribe to Graham's (2004) \" recombinant approach \" which supports a fully relational view of the links between technology, time, space and social life. a) Performative space We call the first zone of Locative Media the \" performative space \" and propose that I may be approached through the narrative paradigm according to which the modern city is a \" text \" on which a variety of textual practices are performed. The environment or landscape always gives meaning to places, and urban landscapes reflect contemporaneous trends (Zeitgeist). The signs and symbols of the city are read as an urban biography. Today these signs include New Media which in their turn become part of a new urban symbolology. For the prominent French philosopher of everyday life, Michel De Certeau, the modern city has become a \" concept \" (a \" concept-city \"), by producing its own space through rational organization. This is how the city is being created as a universal and anonymous subject. The \" concept-city \" functions as a space of metamorphoses and appropriations, as an object of various interventions and at the same time as a subject which is continuously reinforced with new elements. Schematically, the city today is a structured complex, within which the subversive human practices are functioning in an overt or covert way. These are essentially spatial practices \" ways of operating or acting \" which take place and evolve in space.\n\nThis article establishes three main arguments centred on these themes. First, we propose that the analysis of media artworks, installations and other locative-based media projects bring different conceptual and theoretical tools to the already growing fields of software studies (Manovich, 2013) and the relationship of code and algorithms to cities and the built environment (Kitchin and Dodge, 2011). As multi- screen, site-specific, social and participatory ecosystems, which work according to the dual principles of physical touch and, what Verhoeff and Cooley (2014) have called elsewhere, haptic, gestural “looking”, Saving Face specifically and other artworks more generally offer a context for reflecting on the movements of people and the circulation of data and images across platforms, the urban context as living and layered archive, and the activity and gestures that are elicited by a variety of screen-based, cultural interfaces. Because it allows the mobile subject in public space to engage in the process of creation and dissemination of images, the artwork enables us to consider the specificities of current uses of mobile, interactive, and networked media. It presents these as a process, an operation, and a working-with technology on the one hand, and as a communal, collaborative, and public engagement on the other. As such, the work is what it does, or, if you prefer, it does what it is. Second, the concerns of software studies and the programmable city are reflected back into media artworks themselves, as they offer potential to test the limitations of affordances, play with possibilities and engage embodiment and performativity at a stage of temporary reflexive impasse – wherein the artwork occupies a theoretical as well as material space. In this way, as a theoretical object – or object to “think with”, Saving Face can be used to interrogate how urban projects can be understood as (curatorial) laboratories for embodied criticality. It is an allegorical example of design, and an example of theoretical analysis. Indeed, the work is reflexive. It proposes itself as embodied thought, not only on interactive screen media, but also on a cultural understanding of the physical or material, as well as networked connectivity. It experiments with its technological affordances (Gibson 1979). It conducts such an experiment in that it works to critically expose how these affordances operate in the act of working with them. At the same time Saving Face experiments with ways of addressing the social questions about subjectivity and visibility within a connected and participatory framework raised by the potential of its individual affordances. Thus, Saving Face can also be considered as performative and experimental, in the sense that it makes that which it analyzes. This performative potential is the “message”, one could say, in McLuhan’s terms – or, arguably: the medium is the method (Verhoeff, 2013).1 Thirdly, this article addresses some theoretical underpinnings of an analytical approach to understanding how location-based media, or urban interfaces, layer urban spaces. It sketches some thoughts about a potentially critical-analytical approach to the \"cultural interfaces\" (Manovich, 2001) of current urban projects that use location-based media, and it offers an approach to understanding these projects as curatorial machines for cultural data. To do this, we zoom in on efforts such as Saving Face to provide access to data and their collections – whether or not instigated by museal and archival institutions or whether more bottom-up, civic collaborative projects. These works, as theoretical objects allow us to investigate layering as a design-principle for urban interfaces as navigational laboratories."
