        "text": "In a world where the offence comes naturally to us, I think there should be more movies that are alarming to the senses. A good movie is all about the experience of it, how you feel once you have stepped out of the theatre or shut off the laptop reveals how the movie impacted you. One of the most amazing things in this experience, the cinematic revelation, is that it is personal and belongs to the movie watcher, beyond reviews, much like this one. Yet, I am writing the review or I write reviews because I pen down my thoughts and feelings about movies or series. With Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios in Spanish), a film released in 1988, directed by Pedro Almodóvar, I felt alarmed, and surprised, and was asked to think about a black comedy Spanish movie about the world we live in and how we see our species as conformists, even though we hate the mere idea of it. With Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, I was asked to let go of my “woke” self and accept humans for who they are, completely and utterly, even beautifully flawed as f**k human beings.\n\nCarmen Maura as Peppa\n\nThe film starts with the main protagonist, Peppa, played by the rather enigmatic Carmen Maura, talking about how she has failed to save her relationship with Ivan (Fernando Guillén Gallego), even though she considers and sees herself as quite the moral saviour of people, as is seen throughout the film. From the beginning, we know that we are in Peppa’s world, in that we see things she makes us see, from her perspective. And so we hate the people she hates and feel remorse for her when Ivan does not call her back, or only sends through messages, telling her that he is regretful of their failed companionship. The story revolves around Peppa, depressed that Ivan, her lover, has left her and throughout the movie, she is trying to reach out to him because she wants to tell him something. Ivan is the larger-than-life lover that is presented to us through her morphed and imagined version of him. He is fantastical, his voice dipped in honey and he is projected as the life or death of Peppa. Then we are introduced to more characters, each having a distinct personality of their own and not in service of the lead character. All of them could have movies of their own, such is their strong character sketch. Each character is given a background, a reason to be in the movie and yet even after being really interesting side characters, they do not overpower the main narrative of Peppa and her desperate need to catch hold of Ivan before he goes away from her forever.\n\nIn the movie, Peppa is a voice-over artist as well as a television actor and so when we step into her worldview, we are presented with a similar likeness. Her world is loud and colourful. There seriously was not a frame where the colours did not speak. There were hues and shades, bold colours and light. Even though the story of Peppa may not have been a happy one, in contrast to it was the background which was colourful and lively. In fact, all the characters were in trouble. Whether it was Peppa’s friend Candela (María de los Remedios Barranco García) who had unfortunately stepped into some shady business with terrorists or Ivan’s son, Carlos (Antonio Banderas) who is rather a hen-pecked fiance to his girlfriend, Marissa (Rossy de Palma), who herself is miserable. The contrast is poetic, like the world does not stop just because these few have lives which are not rose-tinted, which I think says a lot about reality itself. A lot of movies try to bleed the character’s tragedy into their surroundings as well which did not happen for Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown‘s characters and it is simply brilliant and very intelligent.\n\nThe fun of the film also comes with the fact that stereotypes have weirdly been accepted and celebrated in the film. The title of the movie is the first indication of this and in continuing this, in the film, characters act as expected of them according to their gender. Peppa is hysterical after she cannot reach Ivan, Carlos is smitten by Candela because she is interesting to him, Marissa is snobbish but insecure and even Ivan’s former lover and Carolos’ mother Lucia (Julieta Serrano Romero) is declared insane in the film, hating the “other woman”. The stereotypes play so well into this fantasy of a film that it adds to the comedy genre that the film is characterised as.\n\nThe cinematography teases the comic part of the film as there are scenes where shots have been used at random. Where there is symmetry used in someplace, some scenes have close-ups and mid shots. Colours as aforementioned have been also used to mark the protagonist and her feelings. Peppa wears shades of red that symbolise her love, lust and anger, the shades of the emotions that she goes through. She wears red to show the violence in loving someone. The movie was happening outside my borders of perception. I was an outsider watching a bizarre dream. In fact, that thought translates into the climax scene when Marissa wakes up and tells Peppa about a dream and how now she is not a virgin. We were put into a dream-like state with the film and with the climax, when we finally awoke to reality, something had changed in us, we were more open to strange experiences perhaps, more open to the unexpected. I have only seen this kind of bizarre adventure in Kaalakaandi (Akshat Verma, 2018), an underrated gem in my opinion of Indian cinema that stars Saif Ali Khan in the lead.\n\nIn the end, the movie does shock your senses because of the random things that keep happening. Peppa is the most spontaneous character I have seen onscreen, you cannot predict at any point in time what her next move is going to be. The brilliance of the film is also brought on by the dialogues and how it weaves into the screenplay. There is one particular dialogue I love when Peppa is in a car chase following Lucia on a bike by the end of the film in which she says “learning mechanics is easier than learning male psychology. You can figure out a bike but you can never figure out a man”, which is such a subversion on the “oh women cannot be understood” trope. Here, in the movie, even though the women are on the verge of a nervous breakdown, the men are also shown to be as flawed and a good reason for the breakdown. Also, needless to say, the film’s cast is brilliant and all have done very well to portray their skin. The only thing that caught up to me was that it was a little too long, things could have been cut short but still, undoubtedly, no scene would leave you bored, which amounts to a good and entertaining movie.\n\nThe film is not available on any streaming platforms. The movie is based off of a play of the same name.\n\nMovies are a powerful medium and storytellers have time and again proved their prowess as behind the camera so on the screen through their films. The theme of Liberation of women under a patriarchal setup has been explored in Indian Cinema quite extensively, even though it did not get the spotlight it deserved and only remain in the shadows of it being termed as “art cinema” or “parallel cinema”. Movies such as Mirch Masala, The Dirty Picture and quite recently Lipstick Under My Burkha have told stories of women who take control of their bodies and their minds even under a patriarchal and controlling setup. Abhishek Shah’s 2019 directorial debut Hellaro that earned him a National Film Award for Best Feature Film but got lost in the noise of commercialism. Thanks to the boom of OTT platforms since the unfortunate pandemic and subsequent lockdown in 2020, Hellaro found a spot within the library of the Indian OTT platform MX Player and if you have not yet watched it, you should.\n\nThe story is about a village in the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat. Thirsty for a drop of rain that has not blessed their barren land for years, the men in the village have taken it upon themselves to please the goddess and thus dance the traditional Gujarati dance of “Garba” almost every night. Women are not allowed to partake in this worship and so they remain in their houses, only glimpsing at the men behind curtains and half closed doors. One day a new bride is welcomed to the village. Manjhri (Shraddha Dangar) is from the city and does not understand the shackles that the women are bound by. One day, while going to fetch water, the only time they are free from under the piercing surveillance of the village, they find a man dying of thirst. After quenching his thirst as the women start to go back to the village, the man, who is actually a drummer called Mulji (Jayesh More) starts playing his drum. Thus, the women find a secret to keep that will liberate their desire to dance and play garba but events soon turn sour.\n\nSet in the era of Emergency, the film narrates the tale of oppression on women quite ironically when India is under the oppressive governance of a woman in power, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Simple to understand and contemplate upon, Hellaro tells the story of a village and its residents that are untouched by 70s India. When Bhaglo, the resident comic release of the film and the village’s only connection to the city tells his friends about women wearing short skirts in films (Bobby) and singing and dancing in front of gangsters (Basanti in Sholay) the men find it titillating. Yet, these stories are not told to the populace of the village, (more so the women in the village) but in the shadowy corners that these men sit in, enjoying a fantasy that only encourages their lust and desire which they take out upon their wives behind the farce of closed doors. The theme of the film resides in these small but significant episodes where the women have to bear the brunt of being called “the lesser gender”. In fact the idea of sin is indoctrinated into the people of the village, more so the women who think that if any harm befalls their family or their village, it is because they wanted to live and do freely as most men in the village anyway do. The idea that women are not and have not been equal to the men is already established in the first scene of the film where a daughter asks her father why she is not allowed to play garba along with the men and the father tells the mother to “control” her child, perhaps as he himself controls the wife.\n\nThe film also speaks in metaphors and irony. As I mentioned before the film is set in the year 1975, the beginning of the dark ages of Emergency in India, where a woman had the country in her fist of power. Yet, the village speaks of the men who control their wives to uphold a facade of tradition and honour. The second more on the nose irony is the fact that the men worship a woman, a goddess but on the other hand disrespect their wives and treat their wives only as a commodity and not a human being. Cinematographer Tribhuvan Babu Sadineni has done a fantabulous job of capturing Shah’s vision. Shots have been taken in such a way that they beautified the desert lands of Rann of Kutch. Certain shots defined the cinematographers love for giving freedom to each of the characters to express themselves. The climactic shot at the end of the film is spine chilling and worthy of being praised by cinema lovers.\n\nRed has been used extensively in the film, both as a tool of power as well as a tool of freedom. Lust for power and love for freedom has been depicted through the red of clothes, the most visual part of the film. The clothing department has done a brilliant job in encapturing the spirit of the film while also giving it a very distinct regional flavour. Poet Saumya Joshi’s lyrics expressed the emotions of the characters through the melodious and foot tapping composition of Mehul Surti.\n\nShraddha Dangar has performed exceptionally well in bringing life to Manjhri. Being the catayst of the events that unfolded in the film, she became the anchor for the women to express themselves through dance which has been choreographed brilliantly. Dangar’s performance and they beauty of it resided in the expressions of her eyes. Jayesh More as the drummer was heart felt and emotional. The other actors in the film carried the narrative on their back and so half the credit of the film being so well done goes to the performers.\n\nThe only drawback that I thought of Hellaro was the fact that the film is not socio-politically sound, looking at the present circumstances especially. Perhaps the village setup was to impress upon the fact that India is a country of villages and that the system of oppression on women ring true for many of the country but that may not be a theme to which many Indians would react to or perhaps connect with. Yet for the cinematic brilliance of the film and also for the arresting performance of the actors, one should definitely give Hellaro a watch!\n\nHellaro is streaming for fee on MX Player.\n\nIs our life made up of choices or fate? If it is choices, then how do we take full responsibility of it without accounting for the other person’s actions and decisions that made us conclude into making that choice? If it is fate, then how do we blindly submit our whole life to an unseen force or power, how do we estimate their responsibility in giving us a good life? Perhaps there are things in this universe that is better left unquestioned and yet, are we brave enough to be kind to ourselves when things do not go as we want it to? Life has always been mysterious, but even more mysterious than life itself is what keeps us moving forward, despite our fallacies. This and a lot more is questioned in the film The Cowards Who Looked to the Sky (Yuki Tanada, 2012), where the director intertwines the lives of four characters in one fabric of a story. An insight into what creates life, the film tells us its okay to make mistakes, as long as you have the strength to be alive.\n\nBased on a book of the same name by Misumi Kubo, creating four short stories into one narrative, the film begins with Takumi Saito (Kento Nagayama) who shares a sexual relationship with a married housewife, Satomi ‘Anzu’ Okamoto (Tomoko Tabata). Takumi is a high school student and met Anzu at a cosplay event. Anzu is burdened with giving her mother-in-law a grandchild with her husband but she is infertile and so is her husband. Yet, her mother-in-law, Machiko Okamoto (Gin Pun Chou) only blames Anzu for the absence of a child in their married life. Takumi’s mother, Sumiko Saito (Mieko Harada) is a mid-wife and she is the sole bread earner of the family after Takumi’s irresponsible father left them. Sumiko also helps feed Takumi’s school friend Ryota Fukuda (Masataka Kubota) as he lives in the slums with his mentally unstable grandmother as his mother and father lead separate lives, not caring for the lives of their son or mother. The story that unfolds in the film is a glimpse into a life-changing event of their lives.\n\nWhile I have watched movies that are of the slice of life genre, mostly filmmakers tend to romanticize the lives of the characters in order to give the audience a happier version of the life that they live or watch and read about. There are also films that tend to give a brooding atmosphere to the lives of the characters in the film and that becomes a tragedy or a drama. In this film, the director does not glorify their lives but gives us a glimpse into the lives of four strangers. It shows us that shame, regret and pain are all a part of the lives that we lead but what is important is finding pockets of happiness within our tragedy. The film is an insight into the consequences of our actions or the actions of others and what they mean for the life that we will lead. Does it become a guiding force or an afterthought? Do we use those actions and make something out of the consequences or gulp the aftertaste down with sweetened water? The filmmaker leaves the decision to be human up to the human psyche and lets it decide for itself. Subtle comment has also been passed upon the societal judgement and its impact upon how we are perceived by the societal standards or how we then perceive ourselves through the eyes of ‘others’. Do we let the society be a mirror or do we decide how we should be perceived? There is no escaping the fact that from the time that we are born we become a part of the societal code of existence, but within that code, what is important, is standing up for ourselves, our choices, and carving our individuality out of our experiences.\n\nThe cinematography of this film is dignified and perceptive of the characters. It lets them breathe within the space that they have been confined in. Each of the character has depth, has emotional needs that is fulfilled through the plot narratives. A lot of the times you may find the flow of the narrative to be deceptive, in the sense that it may confuse you as to the flow of the stories but you will slowly get the hang of it. The film demands your attention to detail and so, in a way if you don’t pay attention, you will lose the story. What I really loved about the film was that we saw all of the major characters be the protagonists of their own story within a wider picture. I really loved the fact that they divided the narratives with quotes that the characters are thinking. This seemed to me as a semi colon in their lives, like we are invited to watch only a glimpse of their lives.\n\nI loved the performance of the two major female characters in the film, Anzu, played by Tomoko Tabata and Takumi’s mother, Sumiko, played by, Mieko Harada. Both of these actors displayed intense emotions and really put on the skin of the characters to suit themselves. They were very aligned with what the character wanted to portray and were wise in their depictions. All other actors were brilliant as well and really gave fineness to the story of the film. They became the storytellers of their characters.\n\nA deep and moving film, The Cowards Who Looked to the Sky is intimate, in the way it is able to teach the audience life lessons even without the knowledge of who they are or where they come from. Going beyond the context of culture, it is an honest portrayal of the society and the humans living in it as it successfully portrayed the trials and errors of being human.\n\nThe Cowards Who Looked to the Sky is streaming on Netflix.\n\nMany a times people forget that a woman is, first and foremost, a woman. Most of the times we try to confine her within prescribed gender roles, anything to ‘understand her mystery’ where there isn’t one. At the core of it, women are trying to be human and achieve their dreams, much like any other gender. Whether it be a ten year old, a thirty year old or a fifty, people need to stop teaching them how to lead their own lives and let them be the protagonist of their own stories for once. Masaba Masaba (Sonam Nair, 2020) is a series that owns up to the faus pax that comes with the responsibilities of being an adult. This is not only the story of Masaba, the protagonist of the story, but every woman who has ever been lonely, ever felt exhausted and ever felt the burdens of adulting. A refreshing take on what its like to balance business and pleasure, here is Masaba Masaba.\n\nThis is the story of Masaba Gupta (Masaba Gupta), one of India’s premier fashion designers in a fictional retelling of her life. It begins when we see Masaba getting divorced from her husband Vinay (Satyadeep Mishra) and recuperating with its aftermath. Soon after separation, she moves in with her mother Neena Gupta (Neena Gupta) in hopes of finding the serenity of home but to no avail. Neena is also troubled as she hardly gets any work, owing to her being an actress. Masaba has a lot on her plate already what with the social media frenzy behind her divorce and on top of it, her premier investor, Dhairya Rana (Neil Bhoopalam) wants to present the rest of the investors with her new collection. With her life in a frenzy, she has an argument with her mother and leaves the nest. After a long search, she finally gets an apartment with a little help from Dhairya. At a chance meeting in an art exhibition, she meets Jogi (Smaran Sahu), an artist himself who she also has the hots for. She decides to collaborate with him for her new collection and her creative juices start flowing (quite literally too). She is ready with a fashion show for her new collection but things don’t turn out as she had expected it to be.\n\nAt the core of it, the series is about the relationships that Masaba shares with people and how the right crowd and help you see a better version of yourself. Quite literally on the trials and travails of being a human being as well as a businesswoman, the series tells us its okay to not have the reins of your life in your hand all the time. Two of the most heartwarming relationships that she shared were with her mother and her best friend. On a personal anecdote, I watched the series with my mother, a first of a kind Netflix series for her and we enjoyed the mother daughter bond the series depicted through our laughter and tears. Of course being a real life mother daughter duo, the intimacy is real and the words exchanged between them do not feel strange of tv-ish at all. In fact, every conversation that transpired between them felt like home. I absolutely loved Rytasha Rathore as Gia Irani, Masaba’s onscreen best friend. Their friendship did not feel scripted and their love for each other reminded me of my friends. As humans, we are social animals. We live and survive off of the bonds we create with people. This need for people is shown in a very insightful way through the spaces she inhabits. While at home with her mother, she feels claustrophobic and wants space to think but on the same hand when she gets her own house and is stranded on the carpet with a wine bottle in her hand, the emptiness feels overwhelming. This need for people is not a dependency but a support mechanism that helps Masaba turn herself into a new woman, with ownership of her mind and body.\n\nOf course there are things that can irk the viewer. The series tries a lot to normalize Masaba’s life and make it relatable to women and people from all backgrounds and yet it remains the story of a celebrity with first-class problems. The most irritating of all things privileged is when Pax, Dhairya Rana’s step daughter who calls him “D”, gets an internship at The Masaba House, not on any qualifications but if you consider being the daughter of a lead investor, a qualification. Masaba’s dialogues have been scripted to the tune of a millenial Mumbaikar which is also stressed upon by having other celebrities around her talk in a very heavy western accent. Its like the series is trying very hard to mirror a normal person’s life within her. The makers need to understand that its okay if Masaba is a celebrity, because she is. They do not need to pull a Gully Boy (Zoya Akhtar, 2019) to show us a completely different perspective when it comes to her life. We appreciate where she comes from and her hard work. Shhh just let her be!\n\nIf anyone would tell me that this is Masaba’s 10th acting venture, I would probably believe it because she was an absolute stunner in the series. Every facial expression, every tone in the way she spoke her dialogues were so natural that I felt as if I was watching the actual Masaba, not the character of the series. I believe I have already, in a way, mentioned the acting brilliance of both Neena Gupta and Rytasha Rathore. The other actors that fell under the glimmer of the spotlight was Smaran Sahu as Jogi and Nayan Shukla as Gehna. Both of them owned the character skins and I cannot imagine anyone else reprising their role. The concept of internal monologue alongwith having Amairah Awatanye represent Masaba’s younger self was the cherry on the cake.\n\nAlthough headlining it, this series is not only Masaba’s story, it is also the people she surrounds herself with, foremostly her mother, Neena Gupta. Both the women shine in their resilience against the world and define like mother like daughter. An entertaining and feel good watch, Masaba Masaba is for everyone who yearn for a pat on the back or a caress on the forehead. It is a congratulations to all of us who are adulting, or are at the brink of it, in short a ‘Hot Mess’. OH NETFLIX GODS!!!! SEASON 2 LAUKARI AA (Bring Season 2 faster).\n\nMasaba Masaba is streaming on Netflix.\n\nThe lock down has proven useful to film and series enthusiasts who did not have the time to indulge in their desires. With ease of access to a plethora of movies and series online and on OTT platforms, it does not come as much of a surprise to open Netflix and find its Pandora’s box waiting for us. Recently I have been watching quite a handful of series based on historical events that shaped our world. It is quite interesting to notice the kind of butterfly effect certain events have on the present day, things we are still talking about and dealing with. It also helped as it transported me out of my home to a completely different era, country or even dynasty and my wallet did not complain. So, here are five different series based in history that I offer you as my condolence as we enter another month of (relaxed?) quarantine.\n\nRoman Empire (Richard Lopez and John Ealer, 2016- )\n\nSpanning three seasons, this series is based upon the ancient Roman Dynasty and the travails of being the ruler of the megalithic Roman empire. The series not only is a fictional re-telling of historical events but also has professors and authors who are scholars in the subject, come in and give their inputs upon the story that unfolds. Narrated by Sean Bean (Season 1) and Steve West (Seasons 2 and 3), the seasons tell the story of Emperor Commodus (Commodus: Reign of Blood), Julius Ceaser (Julius Caesar: Master of Rome), and King Caligula (Caligula: The Mad Emperor). With impressive set designs and accurate portrayal of the clothes that people wore, the series has done much to be interesting and hold the attention of the audience, not to mention the brilliance in acting on part of those who played these historical characters. The cinematography is used to show the glory and magnificence of the empire, as it had been and creates a space for the audience to be imaginative, with its additional use of CGI. The audience might find themselves being interested in the Roman history and culture after watching this series, more than if they read about it in the book. The series comes very close to an accurate portrayal of Rome and her Kings and balances both the fictional and non-fictional elements of the stories.\n\nSeasons: 3\n\nEpisodes: 15\n\nIMDB: 6.9/10\n\nThe Last Czars (Adrian McDowall and Gareth Tunley, 2019)\n\nBased upon the unfortunate events that befall the Romanov royal family, ruin Czar Nicholas the second’s reign and ultimately result in the last days of monarchy in Russia, The Last Czars is, at the core of it, the story of Russia’s greatest moment in history, the time when the people rose up against oppression by powerful people to take back the reins of their life in their own hands. When I watched the series, it was emotional for me because the show has been sculpted in such a way that it shows the naivety of the royal household and the evilness of the outside world yet, in fact, if you go through the pages of the history books, you will find that the Romanov family had blood on their hands and that is because of Nicholas the second’s gullibility. Apparently there was a running joke in the country that the most powerful people in Russia were the Czar and whoever he had spoken to last. The creators of the show have tilted the narrative towards the story of Nicholas and his family, which changes the perspective that you develop when you read the history of Nicholas The Bloody. It makes them human, when you experience their story, go through what they went through. I love the cinematography of the series as they have achieved the replication of the Romanov era not only through history’s perspective but the filmmakers too, putting creative liberty into action. Not only scholars, but old footage also helps in the narration of the story and that is really interesting, looking at actual footage of the bygone days. The actors have done an exceptional job in recreating history, especially Ben Cartwright who plays Rasputin in the series.\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nEpisodes: 6\n\nIMDB: 7.3/10\n\nTokyo Trial (Pieter Verhoeff and Rob W. King, 2016)\n\nWhen it comes to something as less known as the Tokyo Trial, you forego mentions of it in the history books. When I watched the series, I got to know why it is the lesser known of the two war criminal trials that were held after World War 2, the first and famous one being the Nuremberg trials where they tried Nazi war criminals. The prior reason being that history is written by victors and so no one raises the question of trying US politicians and soldiers when they dropped the nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki but will try Japanese war criminals who acted under the guise of being in war, however horrible those crimes may have been. This and a lot many questions are asked in this pertinent historical series. In fact I found the Tokyo Trial to come as close to replicating history onscreen as possible. With a Netherlands POV, it did not cancel out or put an emotional fine tuning to all that that transpired in the court during the trials. All perspectives were told as was the perspective of dissent and assent. Of course if we go into debate about whether the trials were at all justified, we need to have a longer discussion but the series was based on what happened during the Tokyo Trials and not why it should or should not have happened. The smooth transitioning of the narrative of the series was helped by actual news and radio footage as it guided the audience towards the unfolding of the events. Although not as exciting as watching a battle unravel or an assassination take place, but it is interesting to see the way law was perceived by the colonisers and by those colonised, seeing how most Asian countries were on the brink of attaining freedom. The actors too were par excellence and it was a delight to watch Mr. Irrfan Khan’s brilliance on screen once again.\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nEpisodes: 4\n\nIMDB: 7.4/10\n\nWhen They See Us (Ava DuVernay, 2019)\n\nWhile an American web series based on the 1989 case of The Central Park Five, what the series is based on is more than only an American problem. Racial profiling and discrimination is something that plagues societies globally and continues to do so through acts of hatred and aggression. What happened in 1989 still echoes through today and in the early months of 2020 we saw a major revolutionary and political change take to the streets in the name of the Black Lives Matter Movement. Irrespective of country, I think the audience will resonate with the boys who went through the trying times of being accused of rape and murder, only for the color of their skin and their fear of the police. With actual news broadcasts being telecasted within the tv show, the narrative did not feel much different than what is happening now. My heart broke watching the stories unfold, watching five innocent children being forced to grow up at a young age. Not only the five children who were accused, the spotlight falls on the families of these children too and the lengths they go to, to prove their children’s innocence. If you haven’t already watched it, I suggest you do not do much haste in watching this masterpiece which also carries the feathers of brilliant actors on its hat.\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nEpisodes: 4\n\nIMDB: 8.9/10\n\nThe Salisbury Poisonings (Saul Dibb, 2020)\n\nWhile it happened quite recently, in 2018, I think terrorism is something that has been defined by the 21st century as the ultimate act of aggression and so, I chose to count this series also to be a part of the list. What is really scary about this series when you watch it, is your fear of the event happening in your country, in your town or city. You may also find some similarities between the current situation and the situation that is shown in the series when a nerve gas attack on two British Russian spies endangers the city of Salisbury of mass contagion. The series unfolds from the attack on the two people and does not beat around the bush a lot. Stories run parallelly but are connected in one way or the other. The series put the spotlight on the frontline workers, the health care workers and the policemen who are affected by this and this also kind of puts the conversation about the medical staff and policemen today, in a Covid-19 world, who are fighting against a global disease to save people. While it is a marketing gimmick and a clever one at that, but releasing the series now also makes people aware about their current situation and how to not do anything that could put their life in danger. You feel empathetic for the characters and their stories touch you. The shots of the city from above are beautiful and it really makes you see how everything can look so beautiful from the outside without the knowledge of what is really going on inside. A compelling watch, The Salisbury Poisonings should be on your weekend binge list.\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nEpisodes: 4\n\nIMDB: 7.2/10\n\nWhenever I have watched films, I have always been able to confine it within a genre or theme. Movies usually prescribe to a genre or theme as it makes it easier for the audience to understand what they are delving into and it is easy for filmmakers because they know how the audience will react to it. Although I mostly watch a movie with a blank slate, I can guess what it would be like, through posters or the OTT description. With Kappela (Muhammad Musthafa, 2020) I had to renew my perception of the film every time something new happened. After watching the film I realized, you cannot put Kappela into a genre. Whatever you put it into, it redefines it and gives it a completely new meaning.\n\nThe story is about Jessy (Anna Ben), who lives with her parents and sister in the village of Poovaranmala, Wayanad. She dropped out of school after she failed her 12th exams and now helps her mother with household chores and tailoring. One day Jessy’s mother asks her to call a client and ask for her measurements regarding a blouse. She dials the wrong number and ends up calling Vishnu (Roshan Mathew), an auto driver in Mallappuram. Even after apologizing for the call, Jessy keeps getting calls from Vishnu. One day Vishnu helps her solve a riddle asked of her by her friend. Gradually they start talking and soon develop a relationship, without ever having seen each other. With a marriage prospect knocking at Jessy’s door, Vishnu invites her to Kozhikode to meet but misfortune awaits the lovebirds at the city’s bus terminal by the name of Roy (Sreenath Bhasi).\n\nThe film is a master manipulator, or rather I should say that the filmmaker, Muhammad Musthafa is a master manipulator. At the beginning you are in a completely different mindset, and almost able to predict what is going to happen as the film progresses but you are completely thrown off by the climax. I was actually laughing at myself and my predictions by the end of the movie, a feeling that I shared with the protagonist, Jessy. The film’s incredibly brilliant use of the trope of red herring is what makes it more interesting as you think it will go one way, the film makes you believe that it will and then takes the off route and you’re stranded on a completely unfamiliar path. I loved the way the filmmaker pushed us into complete oblivion after giving us so much information in the beginning. Kappela also manages to make you laugh, worry, fear and get angry and does not confine to one emotion throughout. In fact even the characters in the film do not have one particular typecast that they prescribe too. The good guys turn out to be bad and the bad turn out to be good and you turn out shocked. The film’s theme deals with the proverb, all that glitters is not gold and makes you think about your judgmental persona when it comes to actual people in your life. While you may frown at Jessy’s father beating his younger daughter because she rode behind a random guy’s bicycle, you come to realize that the father has good intentions and worries for her. You cannot impress your first world complaints upon a father who is brought up on the same principles he is teaching his daughters in the village. Sometimes, you need to get out of that mindset to understand the intentions behind people’s actions, and this theme runs deep in the movie.\n\nThe film explores the demographic mindsets that people living in the rural or urban areas prescribe to. While the village of Poovaranmala is a close knit community, and the mindset of people is not corrupted by deceit and hypocrisy, the city is shown to be bigger, accommodating the lives of thousands of people but small minded or money minded. These spaces are explored not by the geography but by the people, represented by the three characters of Jessy, Vishnu and Roy. Jessy view towards life and its travails are very different than Vishnu or Roy’s and that comes from the spaces they inhabit. We achieve an understanding of why they are who they are through the places they come from. Jessy’s worldview is smaller than Vishnu or Roy’s. For her, the ideas of love and marriage are the same and her life revolves around simpler things in life like embroidery, visiting the chapel to pray, helping her parents in their work and her one dream in life is to see the beach. For Roy and Vishnu, life defines hard work and money making, they don’t prescribe to Jessy’s view of life and rather scoff at it. Yet, this does not mean that any is lesser than the other, but, the film only tries to make the audience understand the perspectives of the characters, to better understand them. In this, we experience a different kind of character sketching and understand that no one can be truly villainized or made to be a hero, if we understand where they come from.\n\nI loved the filmmaker’s vision of the film and the way the camera shaped the story. In a lot of ways there was subtle handicraft in trying to explain to the audience what was happening in a particular scene. In one scene when Jessy climbs aboard the bus to go to Kozhikode and meet Vishnu, we see that due to the rains, the tube light stops working and Jessy is asked to close the shutter of the window because the rain water is coming inside. This is one of the first scenes of the movie and in a way it tells a lot. One, that we, as the audience are now in a state of darkness, we do not know what is going to happen, secondly, Jessy is also, like the audience, completely blind to the things that are going to happen once she reaches the city. This puts the whole film under a microscope and the film thereafter becomes much more interesting. The only thing that disrupted the flow of the movie was Roy’s story and it left me confused for a bit. Maybe it was done on purpose to throw the audience off the flow yet, I think if they would’ve edited it a little more smoothly, things would’ve felt different. As for the acting in the film, I commend all three protagonists for giving such brilliant performances and the movie really shined because of them, especially Roshan Mathew, with his charming smile and persona.\n\nKappela is a film that would ask you to redefine your expectations and not typecast it or box it within the boundaries of a given genre. This movie makes you realize things in a way that you had not expected. You think the film is of a certain theme, the songs, the background music helps in creating that facade but it is at the end only an illusion and that is what makes this movie a good watch.\n\nKappela is streaming on Netflix.\n\nMaking a film which belongs to the genre of comedy is a difficult task, solely because it is much more harder to make people laugh than it is to make them cry. Many films have tried and tested this genre and failed miserably. They either resort to slap stick comedy, sexual comedy or worse sexist comedy which fails to make an impact and drowns in ratings. Thus, when treading the waters of comedy, one needs to be very careful and heed to the audience’s perception of the theme under which the film is to be made. Uma Maheswara Ugra Roopasya (Venkatesh Maha, 2020), the official Telugu remake of the Malayalam movie Maheshinthe Prathikaaram (Dileesh Pothan, 2016) comes very close to perfect comedy. It does not poke into your stomach to make you laugh but the situations present themselves as such that you cannot help but laugh.\n\nThe film revolves around Uma Maheswara ‘Mahesh’ Rao (Satyadev Kancharana), a photographer who lives with his widowed father in the village of Araku. He owns a photo studio, the only one in his village. His life is surrounded with bliss and serenity. The villagers know him and his father well and he is regularly called to click pictures at family occasions. The people know him as a soft hearted person, someone who is selfless and kind. One day he gets into an ugly fight while trying to save his friend, Babji (Naresh), from a couple of goons. After getting hit repeatedly, he is shamed in front of the village when the goons remove his pants. From that day, he vows revenge and promises himself that he will not wear his footwear until the day he pays back the goons in kind.\n\nSet in an unpretentious setting, the film does not disrespect the village setting by showing the people as naive and not well versed in the ways of the world. In fact, there are two sides of the coin- one character cannot grasp the pronunciation of a name and another character spills wisdom like water but his wisdom is taken as a symptom of insanity by the villagers. The village life is not romanticized by the makers, instead it is shown as having the qualities of both banes and boons. While a girl decides to marry a guy living in America only to get out of the village, there are people like the protagonist who will do everything in their power to restore the village’s dignity and honor. Simplicity is at the core of the film’s theme and while people are shown as being innocent, they are not simple-minded. Although quiet, the life of the villagers is not lacking hard work. Not everybody seeks a life in the city and that has been explained very well in the movie. As said before, one of the things the film achieves in doing is that there is subtle comedy present in the narrative. The script has been written in a way that makes us laugh and does not force us to laugh. While the title of the film tells the viewers about the story of an angry man, there is much more to it than simply that. One inference could be that Uma Maheswara the protagonist, is a soft spoken, well mannered person and Ugra Roopasya means angry avatar and so the title becomes an oxymoron, a self contradictory statement. The other that could be understood from the title is that the protagonist, like the Hindu gods Uma (Parvati) and Maheswara (Shiva) takes on an angry avatar. In both cases, the audience gets some idea of what the movie will be like and yet, the film sometimes loses its plot line and deviates from the actual narrative. It takes time in showing a lot many narratives in a single story and perhaps because of that, the film also stretches beyond the patience of the modern viewer.\n\nA lot of naturalness in the film is brought on by the way the characters have been sketched and then portrayed onscreen. The make up used in the film is sublime and emphasis has been given on the natural look of the people, whether it be man or woman. Clothes of the protagonist or his girlfriend and friends are not exaggerated only because they lead the film, they wear faded clothes, much like a normal person would. The film presents its dramatis personae as real people that the audience can relate to. Even during fight sequences, a refreshing take was the fact that there was no slow motion used when the hero kicked the villain or no exaggerated background score when the hero fell to the ground after getting beat up. Everything was kept at a very neutral setting and the audience was invited to be spectators to the life of Uma Maheswara. Color palettes in the film have also been used in specific frames to highlight the scene and the characters. Otherwise the whole film uses natural lighting, perhaps to impress upon the viewers a normal reality. For example, in one scene when Mahesh is sitting underneath the tree and pondering upon his father’s advice the setting sun colors his face a rosy red. This highlights inspiration in the protagonist as he is evoked by his father’s words. A lot of times movies take color palettes too seriously and that overwhelms the frames of the movie but Venkatesh Maha, as the director of the film, chose to look at frames with a creative eye.\n\nThe cinematography in the film is effortless and it is accompanied by the setting of the beautiful and scenic Araku Valley along with melodious songs. The camera guides the characters in the film and shows the viewers the premise of what is going to happen. This does not mean that the movie becomes predictable but only that we, as the audience, become an active part in the making of the scenes in the movie. If anything it keeps us engaged throughout till the end. A format that I found really interesting is the use of retro frames when showing the past. The past of the characters in the film actually felt like we were watching an old film and this was a very creative way of depicting memories of days long gone. Satyadev Kancharana performed beautifully onscreen enough to make you fall in love with his character. His charm and innocence won over my heart. Roopa Koduvayur as Jyothi, shined onscreen. Her facial expressions were on the spot and spoke more than her words did.\n\nUma Maheswara Ugra Roopasya is a light hearted film but with cinematic excellence of a well directed, well scripted film. It stands as an example of impeccable direction, acting and comic timing. There are few movies that make me laugh whole heartedly and this one certainly did, I hope it will for you too.\n\nUma Maheswara Ugra Roopasya is streaming on Netflix.\n\nSometimes there are films that provoke discomfort in the viewing experience. This discomfort springs from perhaps our inability to help the characters in the film or from how realistically things have been portrayed. Liar’s Dice (Geetu Mohandas, 2013) is a film that disrupts the privileged sense of reality and pulls at the threads of this distortion. It is a film that questions the viewers’ sense of a make-believe paradise where everything is alright with the world and bad things only happen to bad people. Everything from its cinematography to costumes to acting, Liar’s Dice is a film that paints the world in different shades than La vie en rose.\n\nThe story revolves around Kamala (Geetanjali Thapa) who lives in the village of Chitkul with her daughter Manya (Manya Gupta). Her husband had gone to Shimla to search for means of a livelihood and she hasn’t heard from him since. Worried about their fate, Kamala embarks on a journey with her daughter and her pet goat to search for her husband. On the way she meets Nawazuddin (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) who is dubious but helps Kamala reach her destination. In the end, a disastrous outcome welcomes the unlikely travelers into the belly of the industrious city of Delhi.\n\nAlthough at the surface level, the story is about a woman’s search for her husband, when you read between the lines of the film, you find that there are hidden layers that unknowingly alarms the viewer. From the onset, the film portrays the characters within a confined space of their reality and with them, traps the audience as well. Although a ‘road trip’ kinda film, it is not as glossy as an Imtiaz Ali direction. It is the romance between the characters and the spaces they inhibit that shines through the film. From the pure whiteness of the mountains where our protagonists come from to the gloomy undertones of a city deafened by the sound of traffic, the director has not only commented on the life of migrant laborers in the film but also the places they come from and the places they reach, where their identity is erased away by the soot of the factories and construction areas they work in. The film does not shy away from being harsh like the terrains it is based in. A lot of the subtleness in depicting the personality of the characters has been intelligently shown through the choice of clothes that they wear in the film. Kamala, who comes from the mountains, is not naive but innocent when it comes to the ways of the world and identifies herself as a mother, her clothes are dipped in shades of the earth, with brown pastels shading her sense of self as well. On the other hand is Nawazuddin who wears clothes that are colored a dirty shade of green, depicting the wildness of the forests and in turn coloring him as well. He does not follow rules, manipulates the people around him to follow his ways and portrays himself as a spectator but is more than that. Then comes the child Manya, who wears pink clothes and is full of wonder and innocence.\n\nThe whole atmosphere of the film is made to feel uncomfortable. The first instance of this is when Kamala takes the goat with her to search for her husband. Although the lamb is representative of home, it is still very odd that she lets it tag along as she goes in search for her husband in a far away city. Other instances are the fact that she asks for help from a complete stranger and he helps her, with no ulterior motive. There are smaller things, little details that give the film an awkward feel. The glances that Nawazuddin takes at leisure when talking to or looking at Kamala, a scene where he has to stitch an open wound, clothes hanging outside when it is snowing, the absence of any background story when it comes to Nawazuddin’s character or even the fact that the climax is an open ending, left to the audience to interpret. All of these elements combined together present the viewers a dark outlook on the lives of the protagonists. In fact the way the camera has been handled, in jerky motions, also contributes to the uneasiness. The film making does not confine itself to conventional styles but adapts its own style as per the story of the film. All actors in the film have done commendable work and the three protagonists- Kamala, Manya and Nawazuddin shine in their respective skins. Manya, played by Manya Gupta, especially stole my heart because of her effortless acting. Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Geetanjali Thapa were brilliant without fail.\n\nWhile the film’s premise is a comment on the capitalization of identities lost in labor it is also a way to bring to the fore a truth that is hidden by the facade built by the privileged to cultivate a culture of forced blindness like that of Gandhari from Mahabharata. After all, the title of the film suggests deception, something that Gandhari’s brother, Shakuni was famous for and which ultimately contributed to Indian mythology’s greatest war, The Mahabharata. Liar’s Dice, the title can also signify Shakuni’s way of cheating through the game of chaucer, a game that is seen to be played by Nawazuddin in the film. It is a film that shakes the viewer to the core and makes them realize a world that is not within their periphery of reality.\n\nLiar’s Dice is streaming on Netflix.\n\nA film, seldom becomes a kind of document that narrates the tales and trials of human beings. Thus, it becomes important for filmmakers to create images that impact an audience’s mind and tell them stories of people from all walks of life. So they experience, through sight and sound at least if not touch, what it means to be a part of someone’s narrative. A movie should invoke an empathetic response in its viewers, so that they are able to connect to the story, the characters and the filmmaker. Maj Rati Keteki (Santwana Bardoloi, 2017) tells the story of a man and the lives he has touched unknowingly, even if it is only through his relation to certain characters. A narration of stories weaved into the life of one man, the film is a narrative of a multi fold of stories depicted through the past of one man.\n\nThe story begins with Priyendu Hazarika (Adil Hussain) a renowned author, whose book has won the national award. He returns to his home state of Assam, in Guwahati, where he meets Sumona (Sulakshana Baruah) who is his guide for the events that he has to attend in his city. Priyendu has memories attached to Guwahati, many of which spring from his past, in his childhood days spent in his village. Sumona is an aspiring writer but whose publisher is using her as a mistress and not giving her the due credit of publishing her work. Priyendu’s childhood memories cut in between his present where we see a worried mother, an abused child, the budding of young love, the destruction of innocence, all of which are weaved into his past. A tale of truth and lies, Priyendu has to face the music of his life and come to terms with his truth, even if it is but a perception of it.\n\nThe film is a chronicle that weaves the past and the present together. Scenes drift between the past and present which can confuse the viewer in the beginning but if one concentrates and engages themselves with the characters in the film, the audience is able to follow the sequence of the scenes and its relation to each other. While the present introduces us to one main protagonist, Priyendu Hazarika, it is actually the story of many others who are the protagonist in their own stories. Priyendu’s younger self becomes a sort of narrator for these characters who come to life on the screen through him. We are but stifling through periods of memory that are alive in Priyendu’s mind. The theme of the film is based on the concept of truth and lies and while one can guess it from the scene where Priyendu discusses on this matter with Sumona and a few students during a reading of his book, if you look at the title, it gives away the theme. The Keteki flower is cursed in Indian mythology, to be not used in the worship of any god except Brahma. This is because the flower aided Brahma in lying to Shiva. Maj raati means midnight which is the darkest time of night, where the lines between truth and lies blur and people can mistaken one for another. The film also revolves around the lies that people tell each other in the film but there is a catch to it. All the lies are perceived truths. When a mother tells her child to not say bad words, that is her truth, but the same bad words come handy for the daughter when she raises an alarm against her perpetrator. A girl sings for a boy, makes promises to study together in college, but when she finds a more capable guy, one who can make her into a star, she leaves him and his perceived truth about her love is broken. Caste and religion is also a lie that is explored in the film through human behavior and how nobody can get away with being cruel against someone, only because society deems them as superior. In the current socio-politico-cultural scenario of India’s society, this concept within the theme of truth, lies and deception in the film, sets a gloomy and harsh tone to the film, one that is supposed to leave a sour after taste in the viewer’s mind. The film deals with the grey areas between the two extremes and gives the audience a refreshing outlook on such a complex concept.\n\nThe film tells its stories through frames and each frame is painted in the color pallet of green, yellow, blue and red. A film often uses colors to depict what is going on in a scene by impacting the emotions of the audience non-verbally. In the film, yellow has been used in abundance and sometimes it overwhelms the frame. The color has been used as a primary color that serves as a connector between the protagonist’s past and present. A brilliant example is a cut away shot that takes place in the beginning of the film, when Priyendu is reading an excerpt from his book in front of an audience. He is bathed in yellow spotlight and he talks about the sunlight in his childhood, which cuts away to his younger self, lying on a boat as the sunlight caresses his face. Blue is a color that prominently colors Priyendu’s childhood. Blue is usually used as a sad color and that is the role it performs in the film as well. Green is symbolic of love and hope in the film. In Priyendu’s present, we can see glimpses of it, scattered around in scenes but in Priyendu’s childhood, there is an abundance of it. Red has been used as the color of loss and evanescence and used scarcely to represent only bits and pieces of the protagonist’s memory. Due to its brightness, it also weighs upon the viewer’s mind as the color of deception. Priyendu’s childhood friend, Bhola wears a red shirt, Priyendu’s sister Akoni loves red nail polish and Sumona wears a red sari when she gets to know of her publisher’s deception. The use of colors, although done meticulously, does not obstruct the viewer’s attention, but rather adds to the stories.\n\nThe film seems to adapt to Satyajit Ray’s style of film making with full shots depicting a character’s relation to the chosen frame. The cinematography has been done keeping in mind the emotive aspects of characters. Body language of characters has been given importance to as the medium of communication to the audience. Little details of a character’s behavior has been captured, making the movie come alive onscreen, like the way Sumona pours tea in the saucer for it to cool or the way Akoni paints her nails red. Although, the camera work falters sometimes in some parts where there are forceful edits that seem amateur and wavers the attention of the viewer for a bit. The pace of the film as well as the narrative technique of sifting though two periods in time may frustrate some audiences and so the film kind of gains the ‘underrated’ status. The actors have performed exceptionally well. The spotlight goes to Mahendra Rabha who played Bhola in the film. The effortless way in which he made us believe in his story is something that many actors strive for and are yet unable to achieve. His facial expressions were timely and very natural, as if he was Bhola in the flesh.\n\nThere is a mood that you need to be in to watch this film. It caters to a specific type of audience, someone who is patient and accepting of its story line. The film is only brilliant when you are in the right mind to seep into it. If you watch the movie, treat it like a book, get lost in its characters, only then will you get a taste of its narrative.\n\nMaj Rati Keteki is streaming on Netflix."
