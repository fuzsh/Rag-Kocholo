        "text": "This blog post isn’t about the West-Frisian writer Hendrik Jan Marsman (1937-2012), whose pen name was Bernlef. Nor is this blog post about the student association F.F.J. Bernlef in the town of Groningen in the Netherlands. No, this is all about the original bard and harp player Bernlef, who lived in Frisia somewhere between 760 and 840. And if you put faith in the circles of history and life, this blog post offers more than a few.\n\nThô gifragn ic\n\nWith these words, early-medieval bards used to begin when telling or singing a tale in front of an audience. Similar to the Old High German song of Hildebrand, which starts with “Ik gihôrta ðat seggen“. Both are part of an ancient oral tradition. Thô gifragn ic is Old Saxon, meaning ‘so I heard’. That’s how we will start this blog post too.\n\n1. So I heard\n\nEfforts to convert the heathen Frisians started with the Franks. It was in the year 630 that the Frankish king Dagobert I took the initiative to build a small church in Trajectum, the modern city of Utrecht, in the center of what is today the Netherlands. Possibly for the sake of the Frankish soldiers stationed there. Soon after, King Dagobert instructed Bishop Cunibert of Cologne to use this little church as an outpost to convert the uncivilized Frisians. However, they did not achieve any lasting results among the Frisians. From then on, Anglo-Saxon clergymen stepped in, notably monk Ecgberht of Ripon from the monastery Rath Melsigi, also written as Rathmelsigi, in Ireland. This was at the end of the seventh century. Read our blog post The Abbey of Egmond and the Rise of the Gerulfing Dynasty to understand more about the conversion of the Frisians by the Anglo-Saxon monks.\n\nOne of the many Anglo-Saxons who gave it a try to convert the Frisians to Christendom was the monk Winfrid or Wynfreth, better known as Saint Boniface (ca. 673-754). However, he was murdered by the Frisians with a blow of an axe on June 5, 754. Boniface tried to fend off the axe with the Holy Bible, but, somewhat surprisingly, in vain. The supposedly original damaged Bible is being kept in the town of Dokkum. Perhaps the Frisians had a sense of irony. Near the town of Geismar in Thuringia in the year 723 or 724, Boniface had also felled the holy Donar Oak of their cousins, the heathen Saxons, with an axe. What goes around, comes around.\n\nAfter subsequently encountering Frankish and Anglo-Saxon missionaries, it was time for the Frisians to convert Frisia themselves. Three decades after Boniface found his peace in savage Frisia, Frisian missionary Ludger (742-809) went to northern Frisia. His mission was to convert his still predominantly heathen countrymen. His Dutch nickname is De Voltooier ‘the finisher,’ which refers to finishing the work of his predecessor Wilibrod in converting the heathen Frisians Sierksma 1995). Ludger was a Frisian by birth, from the pagus ‘territory’ of Nifterlake. Pagus Nifterlake is the area where the River Stichtse Vecht flows, which is more or less the present-day region of ‘t Gooi in the Central Netherlands. Ludger belonged to the influential Wurssing clan. Check out our blog post Attingahem Bridge NY to read more about pagus Niterlake and the Frisian elite belonging to the genus Atte.\n\nLudger wisely avoided the inland sea Bordine, where his colleague Boniface refused to defend himself but with a bible. No, Ludger didn’t accept prompt martyrdom. He, therefore, tried his luck somewhere else in Frisia, namely on the muddy shores of the Wadden Sea coast of the present-day region of Ommelanden in the province of Groningen. Give or take fifty kilometres as the crow flies to the east from where Boniface was murdered. Here, at the village of Helewyret, he met the beloved blind and pagan bard named Bernlef. Helewyret or Heleuuwyrð, what the hamlet of Helwerd is today. The name Helewyret is often explained as ‘holy wierde/Wurt‘. Thus the holy terp, with terp being an artificial dwelling mound.\n\nMonk Ludger was welcomed by a women by the name Meinsuit. She invited him and his followers into her home to drink, and to give the men shelter for the night. Meinsuit had the bard Bernlef come to her hall to sing for her guests about the great deeds of the kings of Frisia (Mulder-Bakker & Bremmer 2021). The singer-of-tales Bernlef had become completely blind three years before. Ludger gave him back the light in his eyes. Together they walked from Helewyret via the village of Werfhem, present-day Warffum, to the village of Wyscwyrd, present-day Usquert.\n\nThe enlightenment of Bernlef was thus both physical and spiritual. Both literally and metaphorical. For a change, it wasn’t achieved by sitting for a long time below a bodhi tree in the hot, mountainous and landlocked country of Nepal. Quite the opposite. It was achieved by walking through the mud in a cold, flat and treeless landscape near the sea, And only for half a day or so. Very efficient.\n\nWe can only guess as to how the pagan beliefs and heathen shrines looked like. We have the description of the Roman historian Tacitus of the first century, about the Germanic believe. He comments on the search of omens, the casting of lots, and the role of women as holy and gifted with the talent of prophecy. Holy places were woods and groves, and the Germanic people didn’t portray idols in human likeness.\n\nFurthermore, there is the Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum which translates as ‘small index of superstitions and paganism’. A text dated to mid eighth century. The Indiculus is carefully being kept in the Vatican. Unfortunately, the Indiculus is mere the index of a work that has been lost. The Indiculus sums up thirty, we think, fascinating heathen practices of the northern Germanic tribes, i.e. the Saxons and the Frisians. Because the work itself has been lost, the rituals and practices are difficult to interpret and understand by the index alone. Again, the casting of lots is one of the practices, but many more. Check out our blog post Groove is in the Hearth to learn more about the pagan rituals of the old Frisians, and about the Indiculus.\n\nAlso part of the same codex in which the Indiculus has been preserved, is a baptismal vow; the so-called Utrecht Vow. There’s much discussion about the origin of the text since it contains elements of the Old Saxon, Old Frisian, Old English, and Old Low Franconian (Old Dutch) languages. Be that as it may, the baptismal vow the missionaries Boniface and Ludger used, and who knows Bernlef too, was more or less as follows:\n\nDo you forsake the Devil? And he should reply: I forsake the Devil\n\nAnd all Devil’s money [offerings]? He should reply: And I forsake all Devil’s money\n\nAnd all Devil’s works? He should reply: And I forsake all Devil’s works and words, Donar and Woden and Seaxnot and all those demons who are their followers\n\nDo you believe in God the Almighty Father? I believe in God the Almighty Father\n\nDo you believe in Christ, God’s Son? I believe in Christ, God’s Son\n\nDo you believe in the Holy Spirit? I believe in the Holy Spirit\n\nLet’s return to the historic hike of Saint Ludger and Bernlef.\n\nIt must have been a twelve kilometers, probably, circular walk. Circular, since from the village of Helewyret they first reached Werfhem, which is located to the west of Helewyret, and then reached Wyscwyrd, which is situated east of Werfhem and north of Helewyret. Also, take into account they must have been chatting a lot, and Bernlef’s eyes and brain were still recovering from his former blindness of three years. It must have given him a headache, at least. Lastly, Ludger was in his fifties, and Bernlef probably even older. Their pace was maybe a bit slow. Taking all this into account, it must have been a walk of roughly five hours. Besides regaining his eyesight, Bernlef also was converted to Christendom during this stroll, and together they prayed at a chapel in Wyscwyrd. An efficient, short walk it was, indeed.\n\nOet zien mond stekt n schaarp sweerd om volken der mit te trevven.\n\nEt de ore eius procedit gladius ex utraque parte acutus: ut in ipso percutiat gentes.\n\nBook of Revelation 19: 15\n\nComing out of his mouth is a sharp sword which to strike down the nations/heathens.\n\nIf not convinced by the new faith, Bernlef for sure was indebted to Ludger for the rest of his life anyway because of regaining his eyesight. Quid pro quo, was the deal Ludger made, giving away the merchant mentality of the Frisians. Bernlef became the missionary’s strong ally in converting his own people in the years that would follow. Conversion by proxy. This strategy was a silver buckshot. Bernlef, popular under his people and a non-clergy, would baptize infants and small children during the insecure periods caused by the fierce and extremely brutal wars between the Saxons and the Franks. Times when it wasn’t even safe for brave men like Ludger to travel through rough Frisia anyway. The fact that the Northumbrian missionary Willehad, who was preaching in the lower reaches of the River Weser, had the flee to Utrecht in the year 780 in order to save his life, is illustrative for the unsecure situation.\n\nKnow that (temporarily) blindness could also be a punishment of God. Like in the Irish legend of Saint Mochuda. It was during spring when a druid challenged Mochuda to give a dead apple tree leaves again, so it could bear fruit again. When the tree had grown apples indeed, the druid said they tasted sour and were of no use. Now Saint Mochuda and God were really fed up, and the druid went blind. A year later, Saint Mochuda returned and cured the druid from his blindness. Subsequently the druid had himself baptized (Clerinx 2023).\n\nLudger’s efforts, with the help of Bernlef, made the Frisians finally turn their back to their gods Foseti, Seaxnot, Freya and Woden. In the year 790, Alcuin of York, under whom Ludger had studied before, writes in a letter to the Irish scholar Colcu Ua Duinechda at the monastery of Clonmacnoise in Ireland, that both the Old Saxon and the Frisian tribes have been converted to Christendom. For Ludger’s achievement, he was later declared a saint. We’re still waiting for the Vatican’s plans with Bernlef. Waiting for the apotheosis of the Frisian singer-of-tales, who did most of the hard field work when things were too hot and too risky for holy, noble clergymen. Of course, that the Frisian journalist and priest Titus Brandsma (1881-1942) was canonized in 2022, is highly appreciated, but Bernlef stays on our list.\n\nThe whole story of Bernlef and Ludger has been documented by Altifridus episcopus Mimigardefordensis, or simply Altfried von Münster for intimates. Altfried (ca. 800-849) was a career monk who made it to bishop of Münster, and family of Ludger. The manuscript is called Vita sancti Liudgeri and provides an account of, needless to say, the exemplary life and wonders of Ludger. The full story of the hike somewhere between 787 and 793 (Mol 2007), can be found at the end of this blog post; in the original Latin language together with an English translation. Three, at least, observations from this text can be made.\n\nA first observation is, that Ludger is welcomed by a distinguished woman in the village of Helewyret. Not by a male person. She would also donate part of her possessions to the church (Mol 2007). Since a visit of a monk of such a stature and from a noble Frisian family from afar, cannot have been your regular thing up north, this is an interesting fact. The woman by the name matrona Meinsuit isn’t described as a relative of Bernlef either. It’s tempting to think bards and poets were the rock singers of the past, loved by women regardless of their social status. Like the poets François Villon in France and Karacaoğlan in Turkey.\n\nA second observation is, that although Bernlef was still heathen and he would convert many of his folk himself later on, apparently some progress had been made already by the Franks in converting the Frisians in this isolated part of Frisia, since at the village of Wyscwyrd a chapel existed already. A third observation is, the parallel with the also blind singer Homer of ancient Greece who lived around 800 BC. A difference with Homer is, no single syllabus of Bernlef’s oeuvre has been saved. The poet without a poem, as Bernlef is sometimes called.\n\nThe first churches in Frisia between the River Vlie and the River Ems, were built around 900 in the terp villages of Bolsward, Dokkum, Farmsum, Ferwerd, Garnwerd, Franeker, Holwerd, Leens, Leeuwarden, Loppersum, Winsum, Tzum and Usquert. Some were built on existing terps ‘artificial dwelling mound‘, and for other churches a new terp was erected.\n\nThe reason for the gap in time between the submission of gentes (i.e. non-Christian people) of Frisia by the populus (i.e. Christian people) of Francia, and the moment the first churches were built, had to do with the still ongoing resistance of their heathen neighbours the Saxons (see further below). But also due to the fact the Franks made an alliance with Viking warlords during the second half of the ninth century, to let them govern most of Frisia. Parts of western Frisia (more precisely, the regions of Holland and Zeeland, and most of the central river lands) were given in fief to the Viking warlords Rorik of Dorestad and after his death to Godfrid Haraldsson the Sea-King. The latter in folklore known for his cruelty. The region of Ostfriesland, Frisia east of the River Ems, was given as beneficium to Viking warlord Harald Klak. Leaving the part of Frisia of what are the current provinces of Friesland and of Groningen stuck in the middle, for some reason.\n\nThe de facto Viking Rule meant that the conversion of most of Frisia came to a halt in practice. Only after these elegant dukes annex warlords were gone at the end of the ninth century, Christianization of the Frisians could resume, or repeated. Historians sometimes call it the period of the second conversion, or the depth-conversion. It was for example Bishop Adalbold of Utrecht who complained at the beginning of the eleventh century that Frisians in coastal areas criticized Christendom, and nearly nobody appeared during Easter to receive communion. Also in the eleventh century, Archbishop Unwan of Hamburg-Bremen was compelled to cut down ‘holy hedges’ on the tidal marshlands which were still being worshiped, apparently. In sum, the Christianisation process of Frisia started in the early seventh century and lasted until the early-thirteenth century, before the Christian message became truly internalized (Groenewoudt, et al 2016).\n\nThe present-day province of Zeeland, part of West Frisia too back then, was ruled by Northmen as well. This was, however, more of a free enterprise. Especially the island of Walcheren. Read our blog post Walcheren Island: once Sodom and Gomorrah of the North Sea. Here too, the mid-eleventh Passio Friderici notes that the people of Zeeland were still prone to paganism.\n\nThe Bernlefgate\n\nRegarding the third observation, namely no texts have been preserved of Bernlef, leads to another controversial topic: the Bernlefgate. This serious gate started in the ’60s of the last century and, no kidding, is still going on. Frisian scholars suggest that the monumental Old Saxon manuscript Heliand, meaning ‘Healer’ or ‘Savior’, of which the author is unknown, was actually written by Bernlef. It is Van Weringh, Veenbaas and Quispel who make the “revolutionary claim” (Porck 2017) that Bernlef is the author of the Heliand.\n\nThe Heliand is a rhymed version of the Diatessaron of Tatian; the gospel harmony of the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, dating from the second century AD. When looking at the size of things, the Heliand with exactly 5,983 long-line verses is comparable with the works of the blind bard Homer. Homer’s famous Iliad consists of ca. 7,000 verses, and the Odyssey of ca. 5,500 verses. And yes, size does matter. The Heliand was written sixteen centuries after Homer’s works, namely at the beginning of the ninth century. A time slot that could fit, or doesn’t dismiss, the revolutionary theory Bernlef being the author of the Heliand. However, the Heliand is dated between 825-850, making Bernlef a very old man.\n\nIn any case, the critics from German historians are merciless, and dismiss the Frisian scholars for being unscientific romantics. And that’s saying it friendly and diplomatic. Also, the Anglo-Saxon scholars degrade the Frisian scholars, and say the writer of the Heliand wasn’t a layman, but most certainly a theologically trained cleric (Green 2003).\n\nWe’ll await, if ever, the outcome of this identity scientific debate with interest. For now we cannot help to be reminded to the book title of the aforementioned West-Frisian writer Marsman alias Bernlef(!), namely Hersenschimmen meaning something like ‘phantasms’ or ‘hjernespind‘.\n\nIt’s because of the Vita sancti Liudgeri we know that Frisia too had a culture of bards, singing about the heroic deeds of great ancestors. Just like it’s described in the Old-English epic poem Beowulf. Where bards recite and sing during gatherings in halls and longhouses. For example singing the tale that recounts how the Frisian warrior Hengist betrayed Finn, king of the Frisians. Read our blog post Tolkien pleaded in favour of King Finn. Also, the Lex Frisionum, codified customary law of Frisia at the end of the eighth century, includes a specific, high sanction on assaulting a harp player. Below the text of the Lex Frisionum which apparently still knew the value of craft and art:\n\nQui harpatorem, qui cum circulo harpare potest, in manum percusserit, componat illud quarta parte maiore compositione, quam alteri eiusdem conditionis homini.\n\nWho hits the hand of a harp player, who can play harp in a circle (audience), pays with a fourth bigger fine, as with another man of the same status.\n\nNot only do these contemporary texts of Altfried and the Lex Frisionum give away the existence of bards and an oral culture, but archaeological research in the terp region in the northwest of Germany and in the north of the Netherlands has shown that musical instruments existed, including harps and flutes. Excavated pieces of harp reveal a model similar to the early-seventh-century harp or lyre found at Sutton Hoo in East Anglia.\n\n2. More blind poets and Bernlefs\n\nSometimes lines are being drawn through history that are of an almost divine nature. The famous modern Frisian poet Tsjêbbe Hettinga (1949-2013) was, believe it or not, blind. And just like his colleague Bernlef 1,200 years earlier, he too became blind at older age. The amazement doesn’t end here.\n\nIn the film documentary of the international, Frisian filmmaker Pieter Verhoeff about poet Tsjêbbe Hettinga, Tsjêbbe visits his parents’ old farmstead, where his brother still lives. By the way, his brother is also going blind. Besides all the impressive implicit silent suffering you can hear in their voices, read on their faces and near-blind eyes, Tsjêbbe Hettinga and his younger brother tell with great passion and admiration about a beautiful horse both had known when they were kids. This was the end of the ’60s. Indeed, a shining black Friesian. It was a magnificent horse in character, in gait, and in appearance, the brothers explain. Still, their father had tried to sell the animal on five different occasions. Each time their father felt remorse afterward and bought back the horse from the new owner. Of course, for more money than he had sold the animal. The end of the story was that the horse carried their deceased father to the graveyard. Like it was inevitable and predestined. When you watch the fragment of the documentary (see link below) observe the intense silence when they have told this part of their lives.\n\nThe name of the horse? Indeed, Bernlef. We didn’t make it up…\n\nPlease watch the short impressive fragment of this documentary titled Yn dat sykjen sûnder finen ‘within that searching without finding’, a strophe of one of Tsjêbbe Hettinga’s well-known poems. With the above in mind, try to keep your own seeing eyes dry. We haven’t succeeded.\n\n3. Vertigo years\n\nWe leave the blind poets Homer and Hettinga behind us, and turn back to the other blind poet where this blog post is about: Bernlef. Where did he and Saint Ludger hike? We mean, what did the world look like back then?\n\nienst den salta se ende ienst den wilda witzenges floed\n\nSchoutenrecht; Old Frisian law\n\nagainst the salty sea and against the wild Vikings’ flood\n\nIt weren’t the most quiet years. The Frisians had battled against the imperialistic Franks for a century or so, but had lost the emporium Dorestat (present-day town of Wijk bij Duurstede) and their freedom in the first half of the eighth century, at the decisive battle at the River Boorne. Read our blog post The Boarn Supremacy for more information about this lost battle. Successively, the Franks tried to convert the gentes of Frisia. That came with much violence and struggle, of which the famous murder of Saint Boniface in 754 was likely a part. It wasn’t without reason the Frankish poet Ermoldus Nigellus described King Charles Martel as Frisonum Marte magister meaning ‘with Mars’ help master of the Frisians’.\n\nThe neighbouring Saxons, with whom the Frisians were closely akin (Flierman 2021), still put up the toughest fight against the Franks. During their incursions in the early 750s, the Saxons burned thirty churches. In response, maior domo Pepin the Short ravaged Saxonia in 753. However, it was his son, the famous Charlemagne, who was utterly ruthless. In the year 772, he destroyed the sacred tree Irminsul of the Saxons, and carried off the gold and silver of this sanctuary. Just as Ludger would do a bit later when he ruined the Frisian pagan temples of the idol Fosite on, probably, the island of Heligoland around the year 785 (read our blog post Liudger, thefirst Frisian apostle). The gold and silver carried off from island Heligoland was divided between Charlemagne and Saint Ludger. Two-third for Charlemagne and the rest, still nice to have and worth the efforts, for Ludger. Before we forget, in 782 Charlemagne beheaded no less than 4,500 Saxons at Verden, located upstream the River Weser.\n\nNotwithstanding, or because of, all these genuine war crimes, the Westphalian (Saxon) nobleman Widukind revolted against the Franks during the period between 782 and 785. Typically, the Frisians east of the River Vlie joined this heathen commander in a final attempt to shake off Frankish domination and the new religion. Earlier, between 783 and 784, the Frisians were up in arms (Mol 2007). Widukind is said to have the Frisians to rebel against the Franks by urging them to relinquish the Christian faith and sacrifice to their former idols. But the Franks were victorious against both tribes. In the year 785, Widukind agreed a peace with the Franks and let himself be baptized.\n\nThe Saxons, however, continued to rebel against the Franks. Also the Frisians continued to be jumpy. In 793, the Frisians west of the River Weser revolted a second time under the leadership of the principes Unno and Eilrad from Rüstringen (Mol 2007, Flierman 2021). Several years later in 797, Charlemagne “crossed the swamps and impenetrable places” to confront a combined rebellion force of Saxons and Frisians in the Elbe-Weser region. In the year 798, the Saxons of the region of Nordalbingia, meaning ‘north of Elbe’, were defeated in the Battle of Bornhöved, also Schlacht auf dem Sventanafeld, by prince Thrasco of the Obrodites, a West-Slavic people, in an alliance with the Franks. During this battle, between 3,000 and 4,000 Saxons lost their lives. The submission of the last Saxon, and thus Frisian too, tribe is commonly fixed at 804. In this year Charlemagne deported and dispersed the Nordliudi ‘north people’ from north of the River Elbe. Indeed, ethnic cleansing is of all times.\n\nInterestingly, the military cooperation between Frisians and Saxons was not limited to this rebellion against Charlemagne. Not long after the uprising of Widukind, Frisians and Saxons were fighting together on the side of Charlemagne against the Slavs in the year 789. And, in the year 791 Frisians and Saxons were also fighting together in service of the Franks against the Avars all the way in modern Hungary. In 850, emperor Lothar I wrote about the “gens Saxonum et Fresonum commixta“, describing the people of the northern area of his empire. Expressing there wasn’t much difference between the two tribes.\n\nIn 885, it was again a combined force of Frisians and Saxons, under command of Everhard Saxo count of Hamaland, that defeated the Viking army of Godfrid the Sea-King at Herispich, near modern Spijk in the Netherlands.

Lastly, also the early-medieval scholae in the city of Rome attest of the close relationship between the two peoples. Frisian pilgrims stayed, at first, at the schola Saxonum. Only later, Frisians established their own schola Frisonum. Read our blog post Magnus’ Choice: The Origins of the Frisian Freedom to learn more about Frisians and their presence in the Vatican and Rome. Yes, even the Church of the Frisians can be visited in the Vatican.\n\nAll these examples illustrate that early-medieval Frisians and Saxons were very closely akin.\n\nNot only the armies of the Franks were a threat for the Frisian people. Also, the nearby Danes became a threat. The Scandinavian tribes had just started their infamous Viking campaign that would last for two centuries. Notably the Viking attack on Frisia in the year 810, in this very coastal area where Bernlef lived, would stir things up. The Norsemen made the inhabitants pay a tribute of a two-hundred pound of silver, which would be equivalent to the weregild ‘man-price’ of thirty-six freemen. Probably, the Danes tried to push back the Franks, and made a statement about whose sphere of influence Frisia really was. Comparable to statements still being made in the twenty-first century in the Kaukasus and near the Black Sea.\n\nPresence of the Danes in East Frisia continued until 884, after the Battle of Norditi, also called the Slacht bei Nordendi, when the Frisians were victorious and pushed the Vikings out of East Frisia for good. According to Adam of Bremen’s Gesta hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum, no less than 10,377 Vikings lost their lives during this battle. Read our blog post A Theel Acht. What a great idea! to learn more about this disastrous battle for the Vikings.\n\nAround the time of all these troubles, and without a doubt well aware of the massive bloodshed in the wider region, Ludger and Bernlef were having their pleasant stroll on the coast of the muddy Wadden Sea. Maybe they even discussed the political situation. Pleading, perhaps, for a better and new administrative culture placing the citizens first. Anyhow, it’s the same region that would be exploited in second half of the twentieth century because of its massive gas fields.\n\nThe natural landscape was just as tumultuous as were politics then. Herewyret, Wyscwyrd and Werfhem were small villages at the very edge of land in the pagus ‘territory’ called Hunsingo in the present-day province of Groningen. It’s the coastal zone between the estuaries of the River Lauwers and the River Ems. Even more precise, the area between the River Hunze and the (former) River Fivel. Pagus Hunsingo owes its name to the River Hunze, flowing out in the Wadden Sea at the present-day village of Pieterburen. Pagus Fivelingo, east of Hunsingo, owes its name to the River Fivel that flowed via the present-day of village of Westeremden to the River Ems.\n\nMuch of the coastal brim of Frisia consisted of vast salt marshes. Clay soils that were flooded by the sea regularly. An area that was intersected with numerous meandering sea creeks, estuaries, rivulets, countless inlets, bays and small rivers carrying sweet water from peaty inlands to the sea. The flat land was regularly flooded since big dikes didn’t exist yet around the year 800. The construction of more ‘heavy’ dikes would take almost another two centuries. Thus, imagine flat, wet, treeless grasslands filled with mainly white sheep and small brown cows.\n\nFor protection against the sea and the collection of sweet water, people built terps. Terps, although the term wierde would be more appropriate for the province of Groningen, are artificial settlement mounds, and already existed for nearly a millennium in the area when Bernlef and Ludger made their hike. Read our DIY manual Making a Terp in 12 Steps to learn more. Werfhem was one of the bigger terps of the region and, together with Wyscwyrd, situated on a salt-marsh ridge. Only on top of these settlement mounds, out of reach of the salty sea, some trees and bushes could grow, like hazel, elder and willow. Also, some crops and herbs were grown, like hulled barley, gold-of-pleasure, flax, hemp, field mustard and celery, and even emmer wheat. These were grown on the higher parts of the salt marsh and on the slopes of terps. Rye was probably cultivated on higher sandy salt-marsh ridges\n\nSo, when Bernlef saw the trees of Werfhem, know that trees were actually very scarce in this salty coastal environment, and it likely must have been one of these species mentioned. In the villages, many big (war) dogs, some hogs and chickens walked around, to make the picture more complete. Dogs had a special place in Frisian society. Read our blog post How to bury your mother-in-law and be amazed of all the different Frisian dog types and their roles. From little fancy dogs for on your lap, to war dogs during battle.\n\nWe assume the walk took place during summer, or just before or after. Only this time of year weather would permit travelling through this wet sea area. Avoiding the storms and floods in late autumn, winter and early spring. Frisians were sea traders as well, with a strong supra-regional trading network covering most of northwestern Europe. If it was indeed summer when Bernlef and Ludger had their walk, these Frisian free-traders must have been away, because that was the sailing season. So, near the terps there must have been landing platforms for boats, although the bigger ships were at sea in southern Scandinavia or East England making a profit. Perhaps explaining why the woman called Meinsuit introduced Bernelf to Ludger. Her husband was simply away at sea.\n\nMaybe Ludger and Bernlef also saw men and families preparing their ships to leave for what is now the region of Nordfriesland, just south of the Danish-German border. It was a period colonists from Frisia (re)populated the islands of Amrum, Föhr, Sylt, Utholm, Westerhever and of Everschop. Find more information about the phases and origins of the colonization of Nordfriesland in our blog post Burn Beacon Burn. A coastal Inferno – Nordfriesland. The thing that receives little attention of scholars is that this migration to the north took place amidst the turbulent Viking Age, and toward and very close to the heartland of the Danes. How can this be explained?\n\nMore inland behind the salt-marsh area, were immense peat areas, like everywhere else in Frisia. Archaeological research shows that already in the ninth century commercial and systematic extraction of sea salt from peat soil had started. Salt was mined from the region of Westfriesland, around the present-day town of Medemblik in the province of Noord Holland, to the estuary of the River Jade in the region of Ostfriesland. This activity has had a profound impact on the coastal landscape, even as we know it today. The land inland shrunk and declined, becoming very vulnerable for the grasp of the waterwolf. Around the year 800, the sea washed away a lot of land at the mouth of the River Lauwers, not far from where Bernlef lived. Significantly accelerating enlargement of the inland sea. A process that already had started in the seventh century. Probably the continuous mining of salt in this region contributed to this increasing loss of land.\n\nThe great flood in the winter of 838 on Saint Stephan’s Day, would fundamentally reshape much of the land of Frisia. According to the ninth-century Annals of Saint Bertin, a very specific 2,437 people drowned during this flood. However, this new tragedy was yet to come when Ludger and Bernlef had their peaceful walk and talk.\n\n4. Epilogue\n\nWe enjoyed telling you this remarkable continuum in history of Bernlefs and blind bards. Enjoyed telling you a new tale about tale-makers. A story also, of two Frisians who made a pact to convert their fellow countrymen, in the midst of the storm of war and bloodshed that was going on. We placed their stroll of reflection between the heathen harp player and the monk within a natural ànd social environment that was truly vertigo.\n\nLook at it this walk any way you like, because many different angles are possible. Sing your own tale! At the very least, we hope this blog post gives you a sense of place when re-hiking the hike of these two historic gents as part of the Frisia Coast Trail.\n\nIf you’re anxious to learn more about Bishop and Saint Ludger, and the different faces that can be attributed to him, read our blog post Liudger, the first Frisian apostle. Ludger was in a way an anomaly during the conversion of the Frisians, since they were mainly Ango-Saxon missionaries who, as explained above, were doing the job of converting Frisians. It was the Anglo-Saxon monk Ecgberht of Ripon from the monastery of Rath Melsigi in Ireland, who was the primary driving force behind this conversion.\n\nThe interest of the Anglo-Saxons in Frisia was because of the old kinship between the Frisians and the Anglo-Saxons, at least according to the Northumbrian Venerable Bede (672-735). Of all the missionaries from the British Isles we mention Adalbert, Engelmund, Jerome, Lebuinus (also known as Liafwin, and patron of the town of Deventer), Suitbert of Kaiserswerth (also written as Swithberht), Werenfrith (also written as Werenfridus), Wigbert, Wihtbert, Wilfrith of York, Willehad, Willibrord from Northumbria, Wulfram of Sens, and Wynfreth or Wynfrith from Crediton (also known as Boniface). But there were many, many more (Van Eijnatten, 2006).\n\nNote 1 – The oldest attestations of the terp of Helewyret, the modern hamlet of Helwerd in the province of Groningen are Heleuuwyrð, Heileguurð and Helaguurð. Most probable explanation is that it means hailaga werd, thus ‘holy terp’ (Van Berkel & Samplonius 2018). In the region of Land Wursten the saga of Die hillige Wurt was being told. According to the saga the current place name Ihlienworth means heilige Wurt ‘holy terp’ too. At Ihlienwurth it was Saint Willehad who built the first church to convert the heathen Frisians of Land Wursten; the Wurstfriesen.\n\nNote 2 – The Miracle at Leer, Ostfriesland\n\nSaint Ludger performed more miracles, like the fishing miracle at Leer in Frisia east of the River Ems, the modern region of Ostfriesland. Back then, Leer was just a small fishing village at the confluence of the River Ems and the River Leda. One day, when Ludger had told about the Gospel, fishermen wanted to bring Ludger some fish as a gift. Ludger, however, declined the offer and asked to men to catch a big sturgeon. The fishermen said: “Och, ‘t will Winter worden, dann lett sück kien Stör mehr fangen” (‘oh, winter is coming, and sturgeon no longer can be caught’). Ludger replied with: “Doot, wat ik jo seggt hebb! Bi unse Heer is alls mögelk” (‘do as I told you!’ With our Lord everything is possible’).\n\nAs soon as the men were in their boat on the River Ems, when of a sudden something fell from the sky into the river. “Wat was dat? En Vögel of en Fiß? (‘what was that? A bird or a fish?’). The fishermen threw their nets and when they brought the net in, it was very heavy. Indeed, they caught a mighty sturgeon. Filled with happiness because of this miracle, they brought the fish to Ludger (Siefkes 1963).\n\nNote 3 – Featured image ‘Ludger predikt in de Groninger gouwen, 785‘ (Ludger preaches in the Groningen gaue’) by J.H. Isings (1884-1977). Notice the different emotions among the gathered. The man in the front with his hand on his sword, the man sitting to right neutrally interested, women more close hanging on Ludger’s words and Bernlef’s music, at the back near the holy oak, pagan priests observing everything with clear disapproval.\n\nSuggested music\n\nAC/DC, Let There Be Rock (1977)\n\nCarlos Santana & John Lee Hooker, The Healer (1995)\n\nI Took Your Name, Hell On A Hill (2017)\n\nFurther reading"
