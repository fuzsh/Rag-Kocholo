The dying knight gives him a special ring as a proof that he was sent by Edwinem.\n\nDuring his journey, he passes to the land of Grey Knights where bandits rove there. He looses his horse from the bandits and continue to his travel without it but keeps the Important thing, the special ring that was given to him by Edwinem.\n\nIn the Mistrinaut castle Tiuri is put in prison and is fighting with the so-called gray knights who suspect him for the murder of Edwinem. The maiden Lavinia saves him by convincing her father that Tiuri is innocent. Then, her father helps Tiuri on his mission by sending him some gray knights to accompany him towards on his next journey.\n\nTiuri met someone who is on pilgrimage without knowing that it is actually a red rider spy. But when the time that this red rider's life is in danger, Tiuri saves him. And because of this the red rider is in change of heart.\n\nTiuri goes to a hermit named Menaures. Menaures send his boy Piak as Tiuri's guide.\n\nWhen the time that Tiuri and Piak is on a struggle with the letter which is threatens to be fall from the wrong hands, Tiuri opens the letter and memorise on what is written there and then after that he burns the letter so that no one can read the letter. He memorise the letter without knowing the meaning of the message because the message is written in different language. Piak helps him to remember it by making it into a song.\n\nThey have to cross the bridge but before that they must have to pay the toll in order to pass that bridge. They don't have the money to pay for that toll. So they make a way by passing the side of the bridge. Piak is accidentally falls from the Rainbow river, but Tiuri saves him from drowning. They are caught by the tolheer and they explain to the tolheer on what is their mission. The special ring helps their explanation by showing it to the operatives.\n\nTiuri fortunately completed his mission. The content of the letter is that the country is in danger because the enemy Eviellan with his red riders has a bad plan for the country. Tiuri is honoured by the king for making the message to be successfully brought to him.\n\nAwards\n\nThe film was awarded as the best film at the thirteenth International Film Festival for Children and Young Audience in both the international jury and the youth jury in October 2008.
