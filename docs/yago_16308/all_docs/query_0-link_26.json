        "text": "Bridges 2024 Program\n\nThe conference program will only be available online. If you would like to have a paper copy of any pages of the program you will need to print them yourself.\n\nThe conference takes place on the Monroe campus of Virginia Commonwealth University (map).\n\nThe morning plenary talks are in the Singleton Center for the Performing Arts Concert Hall at 922 Park Avenue.\n\nThe afternoon regular, short and JMA paper presentations will take place in the STEM Building at 817 West Franklin Street. Workshops will be held in the Academic Learning Commons (ALC) at 1000 Floyd Avenue.\n\nThe Exhibition of Mathematical Art, Craft, and Design will be held in the Math Exchange in the STEM Building.\n\nAll talk and workshop rooms have a projector, a desktop PC with Power Point and Acrobat Reader, HDMI and USB (old style) connections for personal laptops, a document camera, and speakers for sound. If you can access your talk online or on a memory stick in a format compatible with Power Point or Acrobat Reader, you can use the desktop PC and do not need to bring your own laptop. If you want to use your own computer you will need to bring adaptors to connect to an HDMI or USB port.\n\nThe last speaker in each paper session is marked (Chair) and is responsible for running that session. The chair must make sure talks begin at the precise time in the schedule. Short paper presenters have 10 minutes to speak and 2 minutes for questions. Regular paper presenters have 20 minutes to speak and 5 minutes for questions. The chair should introduce each speaker by name and give them a hand signal when they are 2, 1, and 0 minutes from the end of their allotted time.\n\nWorkshops have participation limits due to the supply of materials the presenter can provide or close supervision required for the activity. Please arrive early to be sure there is space for you to participate. It is not possible to sign up or reserve a place for a workshop. If you arrive to a full workshop you may observe the workshop without participating.\n\nClicking on an underlined talk title will take you to the corresponding paper in the Bridges Archive. JMA Paper talks are based on articles published in Journal of Mathematics and the Arts in 2022 or 2023.\n\nClicking on an underlined event title will take you to a page with more information on that event. If you would like to be a runway model for the Math+Fashion Show on August 3, please fill out this form. If you would like to volunteer to help an activity presenter during Family Day, please fill out this form. If you are interested in contributing your talents onstage or off to the theater production, reading a mathematical poem during the open mic part of the Poetry Reading on August 4, or performing at Informal Music and Performance Night on August 5, please contact the organizers using the information on the pages for those events.\n\nSessions and Events are color-coded as follows:\n\nPlenary Sessions, Singleton Center Concert Hall, conference registration required.\n\nRegular and JMA Paper Sessions, STEM Building, conference registration required.\n\nShort Paper Sessions, STEM Building, conference registration required.\n\nWorkshop Sessions, Academic Learning Commons, conference registration required.\n\nSocial Events, conference or companion registration required.\n\nFree Public Events, no registration required.\n\nOptional Full Day Excursion, separate registration and additional fee required.\n\nWednesday, 31 July\n\n09:00–18:00: Hand delivery of Art Exhibition pieces, STEM Building, Math Exchange.\n\n14:00–18:00: Registration, STEM Building, Math Exchange.\n\n16:00–18:00: Music and Dancing, STEM Building, Math Exchange.\n\nEnjoy some trad dance tunes by The Trapezium Centroids (aka The Parallelepipeds) while dropping off your art or picking up your conference badge.
