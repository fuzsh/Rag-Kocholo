        "text": "AMSTERDAM — The Intl. Film Festival Rotterdam’s Hubert Bals Fund has announced its first round of awards for 2002 for promising film projects by non-Western filmmakers.\n\nThe fund hands out modest grants for script and project development, post-production or distribution twice a year.\n\nThis year 10 IFFR-backed films that got funding are being screened at Cannes.\n\n“The selections reflects a resurgence in Latin American filmmaking, as well as increased interest from Iranian filmmakers, among others,” said IFFR co-director Simon Field.\n\nAmong the films selected this year for a distribution grant are “Abouna” (Our Father), from director Mahamat Saleh Haroun of Chad. Pic is screening in the Directors Fortnight at Cannes.\n\nThe fund, which last year handed out x508,000 ($460,205), was launched in 1988 with the aim of providing modest grants to enable filmmakers from less privileged non-Western countries to finish their projects.\n\nThe selection takes place twice a year, in March and November.\n\nThe fund is supported by a bevy of Dutch orgs, including the ministry of foreign affairs and pubcaster NPS.\n\nAlso on the Dutch fest scene, “Nynke” director Pieter Verhoeff has been selected as guest of the year for the 22nd Netherlands Film Festival, unspooling Sept. 25-Oct. 4.\n\n“Nynke” won Holland’s Golden Calf for best pic at the fest last year. The veteran film, television and documentary lenser’s latest doc, a portrait of artist Leon Adriaans, will premiere at this year’s event. Verhoeff also will hold a series of master classes and discussions on his works."
