Our Lord did not answer the first part of the question as to the date when the temple was going to be destroyed, but He went on to discuss the other two parts of the three-fold question, â the signs o f thy coming, and the end o f the age.â Further on in the 24th chapter of Matthewâs Gospel account, in verse 15, He described the speÂ­ cific sign that would appear at the end of the age, namely the appearance of â the abomination o f desolation,â or as this person is referred to in other portions of the Word, the initial appearÂ­ ance of the Antichrist. The Lord explained that general signs which prior to the appearance of the Antichrist more or less characterize the entire age or dispensation in which we are livÂ­ ing. In other places we read that these will increase as the end o f the age approaches. Among these general signs He included â Ye shall hear of wars and rumours [reports] of warsâ (24:6). He continues, âNation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrowsâ (24:7-8). A rather significant article appeared in the August 26, 1968 issue o f U.S. News & World Report entitled â A World of Wars and Conflict.â The author tells, â The story of a world continuÂ­ ously at war in this century.â Research was done in London, England. Among other things in the article, the question is asked: âAt the rate things are going, will the world blow itself up by the end o f the century?â He is cautiously hopeful that this will not prove to be the case, but his conclusions are most significant none-the-less. In the decade from 1898 to 1907, he says there were nine significant wars; in the decade 1926-1937 there were only 8, but in the following 10 years, ending 1947, there were 12, in the 10 years following 1947 there were 28, in the ten years 1958 to 1967 there have been 45. Of course, these include wars between and among the emerging nations, particuÂ­ larly in Africa and also in Asia. Of the 128 wars since 1898, he has figured that 73 have taken place since the start o f World War II, and as noted above, the numbers have escalated in each of the past four 10-year periods. The author observed that â Peacemaking forces such as the United Nations have proved to be largely ineffective.â One might conclude that such peaceÂ­ making forces have been practically totally ineffective.- The only significance of the United Nations, and this significance is certainly of doubtful value, has been to serve as a place where many, many of the other nations of the world, including those THE KING'S BUSINESS\n\nouters to cimsLâ BILLY GRAHAM\n\nTHE SOUL WINNER Charles Haddon Spurgeon\n\nAn inspiring spiritual experience by one of the most exciting and persuasive ChrisÂ­ tians who ever lived.

Grand Rapids, Michigan\n\nemerging nations, have been able to sound off in their denunciaÂ­ tion of the United States. The popular thing to do in these United Nations meetings has been for individuals who have requested and received financial help from the United States to bite viciousÂ­ ly the hand that is feeding them and to berate this country most vehemently for not doing even more. There has been no sense of appreciation whatever for what has been done, only loud complaints because more has not been done. This writer cites such statistics as that in the Viet Nam War to date 60,000 Americans have been killed. In the Korean War, 33,000 Americans were killed. In World War II, 292,000 AmeriÂ­ cans were killed, and in World War I, 126,000 Americans were killed. Of course, World War II had far and away the largest number of military personnel killed among both the allies and the enemy, namely almost 17 million. This was in the military alone; there were over 34 million civilians killed in World War II. Beginning with the Civil War, the United States has been enÂ­ gaged in a major conflict approximately every 25 years. FollowÂ­ ing the Civil War came the Spanish-American War of 1898. World War I concluded in 1918. World War II ended in 1945. We are now approximately 23 years beyond World War II. The question remains: Will history repeat itself once again? There are those who would have us believe that under the influence of Christianity the world is becoming more and more civilized, more and more Christianized, until finally we will move away from the concept of war altogether and will settle disputes by peaceful means â if indeed there are any disputes to settle. Rather, people will be living at peace one with another. IncidentÂ­ ally, it is interesting to note that these same visionaries who conceive o f such a world of peace and good will are in large measure the same ones who are promoting the cause of Civil Rights and marching with the rioters. They themselves are fomenting all kinds o f disturbances, even to the point of openly and flagrantly violating the laws of the land. Thus they are becoming willful rebels against all law which does not happen to suit their fancy. They proceed to loot, prowl, rob, steal, destroy anything or anyone who gets in their way. At the same time they openly boast of their Civil Rights as though no one else had any Civil Rights at all. This is but another form o f war in which our beloved land is engaged in right now. Itâs not military war, but itâs civilian war just as vicious, just as destructive, and just as stupid as many of the military wars which have been carried on in other countries during the past decades. The simple facts of the case are that all the education that has been developed during the centuries and particularly during recent years has not changed the inner man in the least. The heart o f man is still desperately wicked, totally selfish and completely ruthless. The natural man is well-nigh brainless. The Lord says, â Come now, let us reason together . . . though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow.ââ A man with a normal intellect is one who will sit down and reason out things. The man with a minimum o f brains is the one who only knows of resorting to brute strength in order to gain his ends. The only way to deal with this type is to suppress him by meeting force with greater force. This is the way of the natural man. Our Lord says it will continue this way until the end o f the age. Only the Prince of Peace can bring peace to the world for He alone can put His peace into the hearts o f men.

The crusade climaxed a year-long evangelism in depth program sponsored by Latin America Mission. Originally planned for one week, the reÂ­ sponse caused directors of the crusade to extend it to a two-week period. For the first time in the cityâs history, three local radio stations sold time for the crusade to be aired from the coliseum. Nearly 700 decisions for Christ were reÂ­ ported. North American Indian Mission reÂ­ ceived a gift of 32 acres of land on the North coastal area of British Columbia in 1968. The mission is developing the grounds and buildings, and has launched Camp Kla-How-Ya North for Indian boys and girls. Some 92 children were in atÂ­ tendance during this past summer.

In response to an invitation from churches in Nairobi, Kenya, they are leading the Nairobi churchesâ mission âCrossroads,â which finishes after Easter, 1969. Early in DeÂ­ cember the leader of the Africa EnterÂ­ prise Team, MICHAEL CASSIDY, left to\n\nassist with this program and to address a number of pastors' seminars. During the month of February a series of large meetings was arranged by the Nairobi churches. The speakers were Michael Cassidy (right) and FESTO KIVENGERE, of Uganda. Radio Station HCJB, in Quito, EcuaÂ­ dor, recently celebrated its 37th anniÂ­ versary. Highlighting the occasion was a three and one-half hour television proÂ­ gram on HCJBâs Channel 4 which feaÂ­ tured high-ranking government and civic figures, musical groups and interviews with the stationâs leaders. Other special observances included an extended radio presentation under the direction of HCÂ­ JB âs completely indigenous Spanish DeÂ­ partment.

Where can I find this and what does it include ? Answer: The list appears on page 235 of The Harp o f God, published in 1921 by the Watch Tower of Brooklyn and reads as follows: Adding machines, aeroplanes, aluminum, antiseptic surgery, arÂ­ tificial dyes, automatic couplers, automobiles, b a r b e d wire, biÂ­ cycles, carborundum, cash regisÂ­ ters, ce llu lo id , correspondence schools, cream separators, DarkÂ­ est Africa, disk ploughs, Divine Plan of the Ages (R u s s e llâ s books), dynamite, electric railÂ­ ways, electric welding, escalators, fireless cookers, gas engines, harÂ­ vesting machines, illum ina ting gas, induction motors, linotypes, match machines, monotypes, moÂ­ tion pictures, North Pole, Panama Canal, Pasteurization, ra ilway signals, Roentgen rays, shoe sewÂ­ ing machines, smokeless powder, South Pole, submarines, radium, sky scrapers, subways, talking machines, telephones, typewriters, vacuum cleaners and wireless teleÂ­ graphy. When Russellâs predictions that Christ would return in October 1914 did not come to pass, and Russell himself died in 1916, the new head of the cult, â Judgeâ Joseph F. RuthÂ­ erford, was faced with a dilemma which he â solvedâ with this explanaÂ­ tion: â In 1914 Jehovah set His Anointed One upon his th rone; therefore at that time Christ Jesus took his authority as King. Three and one-half years thereafter, to wit in 1918, the Lord came to his temÂ­ ple, which is the temple of Godâ (Prophecy, pp. 73, 77, 82ff.). Absurd as is this theory, it is a fulfillment of Matthew 24:26: âWherefore, if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: beÂ­ hold, he is in secret chambers; beÂ­ lieve it not.â Jehovahâs Witnesses is but one of the cults which teaches that Christ is already here.\n\nA surgeon must be proficient with his scalpel.

To this date we have heard from approximately 30 of our subscribers and friends who are interested in participatÂ­ ing in this project. Mr. Gerald Gooden, reference research libraÂ­ rian for Biola College, has been kind enough to prepare a card file on those who are interested. Included on the reference is inÂ­ formation as to their special colÂ­ lections. Names and addresses of other Christian Stamp Club memÂ­ bers are available upon request. We would suggest that members write to one another to arrange for potential trading. Several of the potential C h r is t ian Stamp Club members are missionaries and would be willing to assist in securing new issues from the countries in which they are laÂ­ boring. The largest number o f stamp club members are making a speÂ­ cialty of United States collections, while the next larger numbers are specializing in Israel stamps. OthÂ­ er fields of special interest include Canada, Great Britain including the British Colonies, as well as Africa, Central America, ColomÂ­ bia, India, Japan, Mexico, PhilipÂ­ pines and the United Nations. Fields of special interest include the Bible, Christmas, Freedom from Hunger, hunting stamps, post cards, religion, special due stamps, and transportation. Any who have an interest in stamp collections but have not as yet notified THE KINGâS BUSIÂ­ NESS C h r is t ian Stamp Club should do so as soon as possible that you may receive information relative to other members.\n\nare\n\neveryday,\n\nharder.â The commentary\n\nTHOT: Just as a certain degree of solar heat is necessaiy to bring the finest fruit to perÂ­ fection, so is fiery trial indispensable for ripening the inner man.\n\nThe above is selected from Our Daily Bread, the devotional guide published monthly by Radio Bible Class.

The Los Angeles Times reports, â StandÂ­ ing on chairs on opposite sides o f the open door, the couple placed the rope, which was tied around their necks, over the top of the door and then kicked the chairs away.â An 18-year-old girl says, â I tried to commit suiÂ­ cide last October. Iâve tried to face reality, but I'm not facing it too well. I slashed my wrists, drank 2 bottles o f paregoric and a bottle of laundry bleach. I bled for ten hours before I told anybody I did it.â â Bring a tube of glue to the funeral. O.K.?â This pathetic epitaph, five empty tubes o f glue, a rifle and three notes were left by two high school boys who agreed to a suicide pact and then carried it out in a motel room. When police arrived, there lay on the floor, in a pool o f blood, two bullet-ridÂ­ den bodies, a pair o f glue-soaked rags and the dreams o f a lifetime. A police report described the scene: â His head and face were covered with gauze, like a mummy. A plastic bag covered the gauze and was taped around his neck. A scuba diverâs mask covered the bag and a rubber hose ran from a gas jet beneath all of it. There were two stab wounds, one on the right side of his throat and another under his right arm. A surgical scalpel was found in another room. A roll of masking tape lay near the body. Written on the side o f the tape in blue ink were the words, T shall return.â Official listing of the death: asÂ­ phyxiation.â A mother called to say she had just come home to find her 15-year-old son stark naked hanging by a chain from a tree in the back yard. THE BIG HANGUP! Suicide is now the fourth leading cause o f death among high school students and the second leading killer on the college campus. It has become THE BIG HANGUP! The real issue lies at the point o f motivation. What causes young people to become so fed up, so despondent, so confused, so hopeless, or whatever it is in each case, that self-destruction is the only answert Why is the snicide rate for 15-19-year- olds up 48 percent? Perhaps the answers lie in the following four pressure points that are smacking youth right in the face. I . PURPOSELESSNESS ____________________ The Psalmist said that the ungodly are like the â chaff which the wind drives away.â\n\nPeople today are having an almost futile battle trying to discover what life is really all about. There is a pervading vagueness and vapidity about life. A constant search for the meaning of existence goes on. A sense o f purposelessness and meaningÂ­ lessness grips at the throbbing heart of the will to live and enjoy it. It is a grave problem. Modem literature and film-making, certainly the chroniclers of the times, are plagued by futility and cynicism. Says Dr. P. A. Sorokin, former proÂ­ fessor o f Sociology at Harvard University: âThere has been a growing preoccupation of our writers with the social sewers, the broken homes of disÂ­ loyal parents and unloved children, the bedroom of the prostitute, a cannery row brothel, a den of criminals, a ward of the insane, a club o f dishonest politicians, a street corner gang of teenage delinÂ­ quents, a hate-laden prison, a crime-ridden waterÂ­ front, the courtroom of a dishonest judge, the sex adventures o f urbanized cavemen and rapists, the lures of adulterers and fornicators, o f masochists, sadists, prostitutes, mistresses, playboys . . .â With a list like that as a historical analysis of the existential 20th century, is there any wonder that man is pounded by the pressure o f the meanÂ­ inglessness and futility of life? Everything, to be rational, must have a purpose. Nobody plays basÂ­ ketball on a court with no baskets just because they get a charge out of dribbling up and down. The basket is the thing! And the agonizing question looms, what is the â thingâ o f life? Young people today are faced with the purposeÂ­ lessness of life as they view their elders, beginning in the microcosm o f the home and stretching to the macrocosm of the world. In America we have an overabundance o f everythingâbut mostly an overÂ­ abundance of nothingnessâ and â hell seems often more bearable than nothingness,â according to one writer. Behind the wild music, brilliant lights and blinding colors o f their mad, mod, mini world, there is an almost eerie isolation and loneliness. Jack Fox, UPI writer, commenting on current youth attitudes, has said, âA new disillusionment is spreading in the second half of the 1960s, growÂ­ ing out of the earlier one but far more serious, more cynical, more hopeless.â The adult world is just as nonplused about the meaning o f life and provides no real helpâin many cases not even the faintest attempt at communication. An 18-year-old Atlanta boy said, â I donât think adults value and seek anything. They just live. They donât have any real goals.â An 18-year-old Washington girl believes that adults â seek the security o f believing there is a Good and a Bad, and that there is a set order to life.â 79% of the teenagers surveyed by Look MagaÂ­ zine say their parents annoy them, and 57% would leave home if they could. Dave Hull, a Pasadena,\n\n11\n\nMARCH, 1969\n\nDr. Bob Jones, Sr., used to tell the story o f the young boy who was told that he was to hammer a nail into the bam door each time he did something wrong. He did, and after several years, the door was full of nails. Then he was instructed to pull one out every time he did something right and good. More years passed and finally the nails were all out. In dismay, the boy approached his father and made the most truthful observation, âDad, it bothers me that the scars are still there.â Sin is like that. It produces scars. Many adults have had their consciences â searedâ and sin has become such a pattern that they are past the point of suffering much from guilt. But youths, in their tender years, times of sensitivity and responsiveÂ­ ness are scarred by sin and guilt is a serious emoÂ­ tional pressure. Early adolescents and older teens are a large part o f the psychiatric clientele â and sin and guilt have brought them to this, and often to the BIG HANGUP! I I I . PASSION n, The Bible reveals that it is a characteristic of unregenerate man that he is a victim o f passionâ evil desire (I Thess. 4:3) and is guided by the lust of his physical body (Eph. 2 :3 ). Man is literally â guided by his glands.â Perhaps, in the midst of the 20th century sexÂ­ ual revolution, we are able to see this as clearly as at any time in history. We live in the â sexy sixÂ­ ties.â Passion is open and advocated. Like Israel of old, we have gone â a-whoring!â We are obÂ­ sessed with sex. Hugh Hefner, vocal propagandist of a barnyard morality set for the gratification of passion at all costs, says, â Sex is a function o f the body, a drive which man shares with animals like eating, drinking and sleeping; it is a physical deÂ­ mand that must be satisfied. I f you donât satisfy it, you will have all sorts of neuroses and repression psychoses. Sex is here to stay. Letâs forget the pruÂ­ dery that makes us hide from itâthrow away those inhibitions, find a girl who is like-minded and let yourself go.â Young people today are on the experimental jag. They are living in a liberated society trying to find answers and because o f the lack o f reÂ­ straints, the confusion around morality and the search to belong and know fulfillment and meaning in life, have turned to sex. Movies, dirtier than ever, and magazines, as well as TV, are emerging as sexual propaganda media, and the youth of toÂ­ day are buying what is being sold. But sex is a one-way street to nowhere. IllegitiÂ­ mate births (101,800 known to unmarried girls 15-19 in 1964, the latest year for figures, and 5,400 known to girls 14 and under) have increased to a scale where teenagers account for 40% o f them. Venereal disease reaps its harvest. According to the American Social Health Association, 1 out of\n\nCalifornia, disc jockey, gets as many as 10,000 calls an hour from teenagers. Some telephone just to talk because they say no one at home talks to them. The emptiness of the economic world, â dad either hates his job or spends all his time at it in a mad race to make more money, while isolating his children; the emptiness of the marital world â quarreling parents, lack of love in the home, divorce, insecurity; the emptiness o f the political worldâthe constant inability to find peace, quell discontents, meet the needs of people and tell the truthâall these characteristics of society bear hard on the aura of purposelessness that pervades our day. Everything seems pointless. Some learn to adjust and join the mass, the mainstream of society, which goes on searching for purpose and meaning. Others are secret â cop- outs.â On the public side they conform, but there is an unknown dimension to their life. As far as most people know, they are standard stuff, but seÂ­ cretly they may be involved in sexual activity, freÂ­ quent or infrequent use of drugs or some criminal adventures. The blatant â cop-outâ is the BoheÂ­ mian, the â hippie,â the social rebel who breaks all social mores and blasts free of all institutions in a final escapistâs search for reality and purpose. Or maybe he just gives up searching and seeks the oblivion o f drugs and free love and perhaps, ultiÂ­ mately, the BIG HANGUP! I I . PAST .. --------- The past poses a treacherous threat to the health o f the present. Paul says, in Romans 3, âThere is none righteous, no not one . . . there is none that doeth good, no not one.â As a result, he says, in verse 19, every one bears the guilt of his sin before God. Sin produces guilt and guilt is an intolerable burden. Psychologists indicate that the most common denominator in all emotional and reÂ­ lated problems is guilt, though some have a differÂ­ ent name for it. The Bible tells us that it is the common denominator in 100% o f all problems. Man cannot live with guilt. Todayâs society is trying to shed guilt by elimiÂ­ nating its causeâsin. Everything is relative; there is no right or wrong. Sin is, at best, a prenatal preÂ­ dilection, an idiosyncrasy of individuality or, perÂ­ haps even poor secretion of the endocrine glands. But the attempt has failed. There is no escape and man still has to live with sin and guilt: everything from the rash to psychosis results. Young people donât escape guilt. I cannot numÂ­ ber the times young people have approached me in a school, camp or at my office and tearfully unburÂ­ dened a heart crying for relief from the guilt proÂ­ duced by the sin of some tragic moment. Sexual inÂ­ volvement, cheating, lies to parents, narcotic habits, acts of crime and a multitude of other things have left unbearable imprints that make life miserable.\n\nTHE KING'S BUSINESS\n\n12\n\nevery 250 teenagers was infected in 1966; 15-19 year-olds have more incidence of gonorrhea and syphilis than all other age groups combined and doubled. Heartache, depression, anxiety, guilt, soÂ­ cial disease, condemnation by peers are high prices to pay for a moment of sexual liberty. The words o f the ruined Oscar Wilde are apÂ­ propriateââ I forgot that what one does in secret, he has one day to cry aloud from the housetop.â Passion is a cruel master and often leads to the BIG HANGUP! IV . POTENTIAL___________________________ Solomon, the Preacher in Ecclesiastes, comes to the human conclusion that all manâs effort is vanÂ­ ityâempty, without value and leading to frustraÂ­ tion. He takes great pains to point out that all the dreams and plans of men are folly. Young people today are faced with the prosÂ­ pects of their dreams being shattered. The crumÂ­ bling of the future strikes a bruising blow. A mother cries, âHe killed himself because he was drafted and it ruined all his plans.â The threat o f war, war itself, the draft, comÂ­ petition, vying for grades, girls and the first string can produce either victory or defeat. Setting goals and hopes and plans and finding out that they just wonât be fulfilled can arid does produce tragedy. Everyday teenage dreams come true, while, at the same time, other teenage worlds are shattered. Young people with potential in varying proportions to their dreams are building a glorious world for themselves and often watch it eaten away bit by bit. Even when potential is realized and dreams are fulfilled, the nothingness and vacuum o f success indicate that the reality never matches the dream. I recently stood by the hospital bed of a boy, permanently crippled, whose body was crushed beÂ­ cause he liked a girl and she dropped him for anÂ­ other guy. He jumped off the roof of the gym at lunch hour. Teenagers still dream, but the world is too real to make all those dreams come true, and the potenÂ­ tial o f so many is never realized. They seldom beÂ­ come what they could have been and, if some do, they find it isnât what they thought it would be. It is frustration because o f what they are not, or cannot be. Purposelessness, the past, passion and potenÂ­ tial . . . These general areas simply stated, yet in almost immeasurable complexity, are the factors within varying degrees of mixture that so often result in the BIG HANGUP! The facts indicated in connection with each one o f the cases o f suicide in the introduction o f this article reveal that each o f the four problems is represented by at least one o f the cases. But, climactically, it is at this precise point that\n\nthe message o f the person o f Jesus Christ comes with the solution for each area. Purposelessness becomes divine purpose when we see what Paul wrote to Timothy (II Tim. 1 : 9 ) ; â God, who has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.â Through the person, Jesus Christ, comes purÂ­ poseâdivine purpose, as every redeemed child of God becomes an integral part o f Godâs divine masÂ­ terplan. God made us for a distinct purpose in His eternal plan; without that there is no fulfillment. The person who knows Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour has no problem finding purpose. He is a part of Godâs glorious eternal purpose. He has a sense of eternity and indispensability in the operation o f a holy blueprint. And beyond that he has an awareness of absolute success in that purÂ­ pose as he proclaims with Paul, â And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose .â In Jesus Christ, the past bears no consequences. God has removed our sin âas far as the east is from the west,â buried it in the â deepest sea,â and even God â remembers it no more.â This coupled with the continual cleansing of I John 1 :9 and the promise of âno judgmentâ in Romans 8:1 makes guilt a foreign element. God is in the business of forgiving the past. It is Jesus Christ, â in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness o f sins according to the riches of His graceâ (Ephesians 1:7). Then comes the promise â If any man be in Christ Jesus, he is a new creation; old things are passed away; behold all things are become newâ (II Cor. 5:17). Passion and evil desire are replaced in the new man by a desire for that which is spirit- itual and godly. I Corinthians 2:14-16 shows the contrast between the natural man who cannot unÂ­ derstand the things of God and the spiritual man, the new creation who has, literally, the mind of Christ. It is through life in Christ that he is able to think on things â true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report,â and continually â set his affecÂ­ tions on things above, not on things on the earth.â As far as potential is concerned, the promise of Ephesians 3:20 is enough to challenge the most creative imagination. Paul says âNow unto Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we can ask or think [did you get that?], according to the power that worketh in us.â By Christâs power working through us we can do not only what we dream, but beyond what we dream. Absolute fulfillment is in Christ. Thus, in every area, Jesus Christ becomes the answer to the BIG HANGUP! Â¡ Â¡ b \\\n\nMARCH, 1969\n\n13\n\nT h e r e l a t i o n between church and state was of immediate and practical concern to ChrisÂ­ tians from the very first. Jesus handed down the basic canon to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesarâs and to God the things that are Godâs (Matthew 22:21). Peter admonished the beÂ­ lievers to be subject for the Lordâs sake, to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right (I Peter 2:13, 14). Paul, writing to Rome, the political capital of the world, explained that every person should be subject to the governing authorities: âThere is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore he who reÂ­ sists the authorities resists what God has apÂ­ pointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct but to bad. Would you have no fear o f him who is in auÂ­ thority? Then do what is good, and you will reÂ­ ceive his approval, for he is Godâs servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain; he is the servant of God to execute His wrath on the wrongdoer. ThereÂ­ fore one must be subject, not only to avoid God's wrath, but also for the sake o f conscience. For the same reason, you also pay taxes, for the authorities\n\nare ministers of God, attending to this very thingâ (Romans 13:1-6). According to Scripture, governmental authority is not based on a social contract but on the will of God. It is God who wills the existence o f governÂ­ ments for the happiness o f mankind. Therefore a government is agreeable to Godâs will as long as it promotes that happiness. These biblical principles inform both governments and subjects o f their reÂ­ spective duties. Starting from a philosophical vantage point, Karl Jaspers expressed his conviction that the basic ideals o f law can only be secured effectively in our lives if force is available for their realization. The idea of law as such can only prevail by allying itself with force. The law is morally based, but its effecÂ­ tiveness is due to force. Although the rights o f men have been proÂ­ claimed ever since the eighteenth century, it has been impossible to give them historical reality. Rights can be made secure only when they command force. An individual can rely only on the rights he possesses by virtue o f his nationality; in other words, by virtue of a power that commands force. He who would rely on the rights of man and tries to do so as a stateless person â and this has been the experience o f the author â will find out that he has actually no rights at all.\n\n14\n\nTHE KINO'S BUSINESS\n\nPage 1 Page 2 Page 3 Page 4 Page 5 Page 6 Page 7 Page 8 Page 9 Page 10 Page 11 Page 12 Page 13 Page 14 Page 15 Page 16 Page 17 Page 18 Page 19 Page 20 Page 21 Page 22 Page 23 Page 24 Page 25 Page 26 Page 27 Page 28 Page 29 Page 30 Page 31 Page 32 Page 33 Page 34 Page 35 Page 36 Page 37 Page 38 Page 39 Page 40 Page 41 Page 42 Page 43 Page 44 Page 45 Page 46"
