        "text": "As we've seen, Carcassonne lends itself to a playful approach. Film buffs and fans of armour and cloak-and-dagger movies will enjoy reliving in their heads the action scenes seen in films shot here.\n\nSome twenty films have been shot, in whole or in part, in the citadel of Carcassonne, of which a small half are set in the Middle Ages, but have nothing to do with the city. In 1991, for example, the remarkable \"Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves\" starred Kevin Costner as Robin Hood, a worldwide success that marked the actor's career as one of his last blockbusters. The other half of the films have nothing to do with the Middle Ages, and their action seems to be set in the medieval city for purely aesthetic reasons, a laudable intention. This is the case, for example, with the film \"Le Corniaud\", starring Bourvil and Louis de Funès, one of France's favourite films, two of whose three memorable scenes take place here (scenes in the church, Place de l'Eglise and Hôtel de la Cité)."
