        "text": "UTRECHT, Netherlands — “Nynke,” a historical drama about children’s writer Nynke van Hichtum, who worked at a time when politics were radical but women were very much tied to hearth and home, took home Golden Calf awards — Holland’s version of the Oscars — for best feature film and actress.\n\n“It’s a touching love story with wonderful direction, production design and actors,” says Staccato Films producer Emjay Rechsteiner, chairman of the all-Dutch fest jury at the Sept. 28 closing ceremonies of the 21st version of the Dutch Film Festival in this city located in the heart of the Netherlands.\n\nDirected by Pieter Verhoeff, and produced by Egmond Film & Television, pic saw Monic Hendrickx nab actress honors. Egmond’s Hans de Weers, producer of the film along with Hans de Wolfe, produced “Antonia’s Line,” the foreign feature Oscar winner in 1995. Both De Weers and De Wolfe run Egmond.\n\nDirector Martin Koolhoven, whose film “The Cave” opened the fest Sept. 19, walked away with a Golden Calf for best director.\n\nFedja van Huet (“Character”) took the award for best actor for his role in “Amnesia,” and Monic Hendrickx nabbed actress honors for her role in “Nynka.” Van Huet played the lead role in the 1998 Oscar-winning pic “Character.”\n\nThe fest unspooled some 65 feature films, with 21 in competition, and another 242 short films, documentaries and TV dramas. It drew more than 75,000 visitors — up from 70,000 last year — and more than 1,000 professionals, along with handing out 65,000 guilders ($28,000) in prizes.\n\nCommercial sidebar the Holland Film Meeting was one of the feistiest in recent years, as Dutch producers and directors demanded clarifications to the Dutch tax incentive scheme in a panel with Dutch minister of culture, education and health’s Rick van de Ploeg, and Jeltje Van Nieuwenhoven, chairwoman of Holland’s most powerful parliamentary body, the Second Chamber. The tax scheme has been responsible for giving the commercial film industry in Holland a major shot in the arm in the last two years.\n\nDuring the Film Meeting, a slate of new films in the making that are seeking funding included futuristic comedy Halcyon by award-winning “Polish Bride” director Karim Traidia."
