        "text": "AMSTERDAM — The Dutch Film Fund has granted nine local film projects a total of €8.6 million ($11.6 million) in subsidies as part of a new support system.\n\nProducers who have secured more than 65% of their budgets can apply to obtain the remaining balance from the fund. The new fund, which replaces governmental support through a complicated system of tax incentives, has an annual budget of €13 million ($17.5 million).\n\nOne of the highest payouts — €2.4 million ($3.2 million) — will go to “Bride Flight,” an epic drama directed by Ben Sombogaart. The film, produced by IdtV Film, follows three young Dutch women who escape post-war Holland to build a new future in New Zealand.\n\nOther productions supported by the new fund are Pieter Verhoeff’s children’s adventure “The Letter to the King,” the political drama “Vox Populi” from Eddy Terstall, documentary “J’accuse” by Peter Greenaway, black comedy “The Botox Method” by Dick Maas and “Amsterdam,” the feature debut by Belgian stage director Ivo van Hove.\n\nTwo further projects are still awaiting a funding decision: the horror-comedy “Spy for Orange” and “1-900,” the third English-language remake of a Theo van Gogh film. John Turturro is directing."
