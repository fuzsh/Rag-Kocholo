        "text": "A deterministic reaction-diffusion simulator is a software designed to approximate the dynamics of a system governed by the diffusion and interaction of species within or across domains in a deterministic fashion.\n\nIn a neural tissue, much physiological activity is governed or moderated by diffusion and interaction of many types of molecules and ions. Intracellularly, signaling molecules and ions such as cAMP, G-proteins, and calcium diffuse and moderate the activity of ion channels and other proteins. They also interact with receptors on organelles, as seen with calcium-induced calcium release. Extracellularly, bulk diffusion of glutamate, calcium, sodium, and potassium has both pathological and physiological effects. In addition to diffusion through the aqueous media of intracellular and extracellular space, there is also diffusion of signaling molecules and of ion-channel-forming proteins within the membrane. Modeling and simulating such complex..."
