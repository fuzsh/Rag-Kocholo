        "text": "Hi Darke,\n\nThis is a bug in how SimBiology imports reaction modifiers. The model is imported incorrectly if either the name of a species modifier is not a valid MATLAB identifier or the model has multiple compartments (or both). I will work on fixing this bug.\n\nIn the meatime, the best workaround is probably to replace the modifiers in the SBML file by instead adding each modifier species as both a reactant and a product. I am attached an updated version of the SBML file that does this.\n\nAlso, I noticed that this SBML file makes use of piecewise. This is not a function that ships with SimBiology. However, there is a version available on the File Exchange. For your convenience, I am also attaching that file here. If you download both files, you should be able to import and simulate the model using SimBiology."
