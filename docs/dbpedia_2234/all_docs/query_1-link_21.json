        "text": "Prof Margaret Johnson from John Hopkins University and Michael Blinov are hosting the Special Interest Subgroup session on Biophysical Modeling of the Cell at Cell Bio 2023 – an ASCB/EMBO (https://www.ascb.org/cellbio2023/) meeting in Boston, MA, December 2-6. The session will take place on Wednesday, December 6, 8:30 AM – 11:00 AM (https://www.ascb.org/cellbio2023/program/subgroups/).\n\nNuclear lamina strain states revealed by intermolecular force biosensor.\n\nDanielsson, B.E., George Abraham, B., Mäntylä, E., Cabe, J.I., Mayer, C.R., Rekonen, A., Ek, F., Conway, D.E. and Ihalainen, T.O.\n\nNat Commun. 2023 Jun 30;14(1):3867\n\nPUBMED:37391402\n\ndoi: 10.1038/s41467-023-39563-6\n\n2023-06-28. The 24th Annual Computational Cell Biology (CCB) workshop took place at the Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling (CCAM) on June 26-28th. 11 participants from all over the US (from Maryland to Illinois) came to Farmington to work on developing their modeling projects using VCell and COPASI software tools, designed and maintained at CCAM. The students were helped by a CCAM team consisting of Michael Blinov, Ann Cowan, Leslie Loew, Pedro Mendes, Ion Moraru, […]\n\nBeyond analytic solution: Analysis of FRAP experiments by spatial simulation of the forward problem.\n\nCowan, A.E. & Loew, L.M.\n\nBiophys J. 2023 Jun 23;S0006-3495(23)00401-0\n\nPUBMED:37353932/\n\ndoi: 10.1016/j.bpj.2023.06.013\n\nVCell BioModels referenced in publication\n\nuser: les\n\nbiomodel name: FRAP_Membrane_Rel\n\nbiomodel name: FRAP_Cyt\n\nbiomodel name: FRAP_Cyt_Membrane_Binding\n\nbiomodel name: FRAP Condensate Droplet\n\n2023-05-04. The interdisciplinary team consisting of CCAM modelers Drs. Blinov and Moraru and researchers from the Center on Aging Drs. Kuchel and Kositsawat, together with former undergrad students Schaumburger and Pally published a manuscript theoretically explaining the bistability of clinical outcomes: the likelihood of an individual remaining mobile over time either increases to almost 100% or decreases to almost zero. The VCell software was extensively used for parameter scans and fitting.\n\nSchaumburger, N., Pally, J., Moraru, […]\n\n2023-05-01. VCell 7.5 has been released. It features parameter estimation from the latest version of COPASI; model exchange via multiple standards, including, SBML, SEDML and OMEX; parameter scans in local client simulations; and hardening of unit handling including automatic unit transformations.
