The bidirectional character of synaptic plasticity may result at least in part from an increased or decreased responsiveness of the glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPA-R) due to the modification of conductance and/or channel number, and controlled by the balance between the activities of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation pathways. AMPA-R depression can be induced by a long-lived Ca2+ signal of moderate amplitude favouring the activation of the dephosphorylation pathway, whereas a shorter but higher Ca2+ signal would induce AMPA-R potentiation resulting from the preferential activation of the phosphorylation pathway. Within the framework of a model involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), calcineurin (PP2B) and type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), we aimed at delineating the conditions allowing a biphasic U-shaped relationship between AMPA-R and Ca2+ signal amplitude, and thus bidirectional plasticity. Our theoretical analysis shows that such a property may be observed if the phosphorylation pathway: (i) displays higher cooperativity in its Ca2+-dependence than the dephosphorylation pathway; (ii) displays a basal Ca2+-independent activity; or (iii) is directly inhibited by the dephosphorylation pathway. Because the experimentally observed inactivation of CaMKII by PP1 accounts for this latter characteristic, we aimed at verifying whether a realistic model using reported parameters values can simulate the induction of either LTP or LTD, depending on the time and amplitude characteristics of the Ca2+ signal. Our simulations demonstrate that the experimentally observed bidirectional nature of Ca2+-dependent synaptic plasticity could be the consequence of the PP1-mediated inactivation of CaMKII. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/12823459\n\nDallaMan2007_MealModel_GlucoseInsulinSystem: BIOMD0000000379 â v0.0.1\n\nThis a model from the article: Meal simulation model of the glucose-insulin system. Dalla Man C, Rizza RA, Cobelliâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nA simulation model of the glucose-insulin system in the postprandial state can be useful in several circumstances, including testing of glucose sensors, insulin infusion algorithms and decision support systems for diabetes. Here, we present a new simulation model in normal humans that describes the physiological events that occur after a meal, by employing the quantitative knowledge that has become available in recent years. Model parameters were set to fit the mean data of a large normal subject database that underwent a triple tracer meal protocol which provided quasi-model-independent estimates of major glucose and insulin fluxes, e.g., meal rate of appearance, endogenous glucose production, utilization of glucose, insulin secretion. By decomposing the system into subsystems, we have developed parametric models of each subsystem by using a forcing function strategy. Model results are shown in describing both a single meal and normal daily life (breakfast, lunch, dinner) in normal. The same strategy is also applied on a smaller database for extending the model to type 2 diabetes. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/17926672\n\nParameters:\n\nNameDescriptionk_2 = 0.079; U_id = 0.748772844504839; k_1 = 0.065Reaction: G_t = ((-U_id)+k_1*G_p)-k_2*G_t, Rate Law: ((-U_id)+k_1*G_p)-k_2*G_tk_empt = 0.0554800817258192; k_gri = 0.0558Reaction: Q_sto2 = (-k_empt)*Q_sto2+k_gri*Q_sto1, Rate Law: (-k_empt)*Q_sto2+k_gri*Q_sto1m_4 = 0.194; m_1 = 0.19; m_2 = 0.484Reaction: I_p = ((-m_2)*I_p-m_4*I_p)+m_1*I_l, Rate Law: ((-m_2)*I_p-m_4*I_p)+m_1*I_lS = 1.8; m_1 = 0.19; m_3 = 0.276120406260733; m_2 = 0.484Reaction: I_l = ((-m_1)*I_l-m_3*I_l)+m_2*I_p+S, Rate Law: ((-m_1)*I_l-m_3*I_l)+m_2*I_p+SI = 25.0; k_i = 0.0079Reaction: I_1 = (-k_i)*(I_1-I), Rate Law: (-k_i)*(I_1-I)beta = 0.11; G_b = 95.0; G = 94.6808510638298; alpha = 0.05Reaction: Y = (-alpha)*(Y-beta*(G-G_b)), Rate Law: (-alpha)*(Y-beta*(G-G_b))k_gri = 0.0558Reaction: Q_sto1 = (-k_gri)*Q_sto1, Rate Law: (-k_gri)*Q_sto1k_abs = 0.057; k_empt = 0.0554800817258192Reaction: Q_gut = (-k_abs)*Q_gut+k_empt*Q_sto2, Rate Law: (-k_abs)*Q_gut+k_empt*Q_sto2k_2 = 0.079; E = 0.0; EGP = 1.87872; Ra = 0.0; k_1 = 0.065; U_ii = 1.0Reaction: G_p = ((((EGP+Ra)-E)-U_ii)-k_1*G_p)+k_2*G_t, Rate Law: ((((EGP+Ra)-E)-U_ii)-k_1*G_p)+k_2*G_tk_i = 0.0079Reaction: I_d = (-k_i)*(I_d-I_1), Rate Law: (-k_i)*(I_d-I_1)gamma = 0.5; S_po = 1.76784893617021Reaction: I_po = (-gamma)*I_po+S_po, Rate Law: (-gamma)*I_po+S_poI = 25.0; p_2U = 0.0331; I_b = 25.0Reaction: X = (-p_2U)*X+p_2U*(I-I_b), Rate Law: (-p_2U)*X+p_2U*(I-I_b)\n\nStates:\n\nNameDescriptionX[Insulin]I po[Insulin]G p[glucose]Q sto1[glucose]I p[Insulin]I 1[Insulin]Q gut[glucose]YYQ sto2[glucose]G t[glucose]I l[Insulin]I dI_d\n\nDallePezze2012 - TSC-independent mTORC2 regulation: BIOMD0000000581 â v0.0.1\n\nDallePezze2012 - TSC-independent mTORC2 regulationThis model is described in the article: [A dynamic network model of mâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nThe kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) exists in two multiprotein complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) and is a central regulator of growth and metabolism. Insulin activation of mTORC1, mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and the inhibitory tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1-TSC2), initiates a negative feedback loop that ultimately inhibits PI3K. We present a data-driven dynamic insulin-mTOR network model that integrates the entire core network and used this model to investigate the less well understood mechanisms by which insulin regulates mTORC2. By analyzing the effects of perturbations targeting several levels within the network in silico and experimentally, we found that, in contrast to current hypotheses, the TSC1-TSC2 complex was not a direct or indirect (acting through the negative feedback loop) regulator of mTORC2. Although mTORC2 activation required active PI3K, this was not affected by the negative feedback loop. Therefore, we propose an mTORC2 activation pathway through a PI3K variant that is insensitive to the negative feedback loop that regulates mTORC1. This putative pathway predicts that mTORC2 would be refractory to Akt, which inhibits TSC1-TSC2, and, indeed, we found that mTORC2 was insensitive to constitutive Akt activation in several cell types. Our results suggest that a previously unknown network structure connects mTORC2 to its upstream cues and clarifies which molecular connectors contribute to mTORC2 activation. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/22457331\n\nParameters:\n\nNameDescriptionk1=0.999989Reaction: species_2 + species_6 => species_11 + species_6;

The changes which occur in senescence are controlled by networks of multiple signalling and feedback pathways at the cellular level, and the interplay between these is difficult to predict and understand. To unravel the intrinsic challenges of understanding such a highly networked system, we have taken a systems biology approach to cellular senescence. We report a detailed analysis of senescence signalling via DNA damage, insulin-TOR, FoxO3a transcription factors, oxidative stress response, mitochondrial regulation and mitophagy. We show in silico and in vitro that inhibition of reactive oxygen species can prevent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, whilst inhibition of mTOR shows a partial rescue of mitochondrial mass changes during establishment of senescence. Dual inhibition of ROS and mTOR in vitro confirmed computational model predictions that it was possible to further reduce senescence-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA double-strand breaks. However, these interventions were unable to abrogate the senescence-induced mitochondrial dysfunction completely, and we identified decreased mitochondrial fission as the potential driving force for increased mitochondrial mass via prevention of mitophagy. Dynamic sensitivity analysis of the model showed the network stabilised at a new late state of cellular senescence. This was characterised by poor network sensitivity, high signalling noise, low cellular energy, high inflammation and permanent cell cycle arrest suggesting an unsatisfactory outcome for treatments aiming to delay or reverse cellular senescence at late time points. Combinatorial targeted interventions are therefore possible for intervening in the cellular pathway to senescence, but in the cases identified here, are only capable of delaying senescence onset. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/25166345\n\nParameters:\n\nNameDescriptionscale_Mito_Membr_Pot_obs = 1.0Reaction: Mito_Membr_Pot_obs = scale_Mito_Membr_Pot_obs*(Mito_membr_pot_new+Mito_membr_pot_old), Rate Law: missingDNA_damaged_by_irradiation = 9237.72311545872Reaction: => DNA_damage;

We report that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are acutely activated by aa-readdition in an mTORC1-independent manner. AMPK activation by aa is mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase Î² (CaMKKÎ²). In response, AMPK impinges on the autophagy regulators Unc-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) and c-Jun. AMPK is widely recognized as an mTORC1 antagonist that is activated by starvation. We find that aa acutely activate AMPK concurrently with mTOR. We show that AMPK under aa sufficiency acts to sustain autophagy. This may be required to maintain protein homoeostasis and deliver metabolite intermediates for biosynthetic processes. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/27869123\n\nDanÃ¸2006_Glycolysis_Reduction: MODEL5952308332 â v0.0.1\n\nThis model originates from BioModels Database: A Database of Annotated Published Models. It is copyright (c) 2005-2011 Tâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nThe complexity of full-scale metabolic models is a major obstacle for their effective use in computational systems biology. The aim of model reduction is to circumvent this problem by eliminating parts of a model that are unimportant for the properties of interest. The choice of reduction method is influenced both by the type of model complexity and by the objective of the reduction; therefore, no single method is superior in all cases. In this study we present a comparative study of two different methods applied to a 20D model of yeast glycolytic oscillations. Our objective is to obtain biochemically meaningful reduced models, which reproduce the dynamic properties of the 20D model. The first method uses lumping and subsequent constrained parameter optimization. The second method is a novel approach that eliminates variables not essential for the dynamics. The applications of the two methods result in models of eight (lumping), six (elimination) and three (lumping followed by elimination) dimensions. All models have similar dynamic properties and pin-point the same interactions as being crucial for generation of the oscillations. The advantage of the novel method is that it is algorithmic, and does not require input in the form of biochemical knowledge. The lumping approach, however, is better at preserving biochemical properties, as we show through extensive analyses of the models. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/17010168\n\nDas2010 - Effect of a gamma-secretase inhibitor on Amyloid-beta dynamics: BIOMD0000000551 â v0.0.1\n\nDas2010 - Effect of a gamma-secretase inhibitor on Amyloid-beta dynamicsThis model is described in the article: [Modeliâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nAggregation of the small peptide amyloid beta (AÎ²) into oligomers and fibrils in the brain is believed to be a precursor to Alzheimer's disease. AÎ² is produced via multiple proteolytic cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP), mediated by the enzymes Î²- and Î³-secretase. In this study, we examine the temporal dynamics of soluble (unaggregated) AÎ² in the plasma and cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) of rhesus monkeys treated with different oral doses of a Î³-secretase inhibitor. A dose-dependent reduction of AÎ² concentration was observed within hours of drug ingestion, for all doses tested. AÎ² concentration in the CSF returned to its predrug level over the monitoring period. In contrast, AÎ² concentration in the plasma exhibited an unexpected overshoot to as high as 200% of the predrug concentration, and this overshoot persisted as late as 72 hours post-drug ingestion. To account for these observations, we proposed and analyzed a minimal physiological model for AÎ² dynamics that could fit the data. Our analysis suggests that the overshoot arises from the attenuation of an AÎ² clearance mechanism, possibly due to the inhibitor. Our model predicts that the efficacy of AÎ² clearance recovers to its basal (pretreatment) value with a characteristic time of >48 hours, matching the time-scale of the overshoot. These results point to the need for a more detailed investigation of soluble AÎ² clearance mechanisms and their interaction with AÎ²-reducing drugs. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/20411345\n\nParameters:\n\nNameDescriptionk1 = 1.13; r = 0.43; deltap = 0.55; J = 0.0; l = 1.0Reaction: P = (k1*r*C-J*r)-deltap*P*l, Rate Law: (k1*r*C-J*r)-deltap*P*lKi = 0.0232; k1 = 1.13; Sc = 1.16; g_t = 0.0; J = 0.0Reaction: C = (Sc/(1+g_t/Ki)-k1*C)+J, Rate Law: (Sc/(1+g_t/Ki)-k1*C)+J\n\nStates:\n\nNameDescriptionC[Amyloid beta A4 protein]P[Amyloid beta A4 protein]\n\nDasgupta2020 - Reduced model of receptor clusturing and aggregation: BIOMD0000000973 â v0.0.1\n\na simple kinetic mass-action-law-based model could be utilized to adequately describe clustering in response to activatâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nThe process of clustering of plasma membrane receptors in response to their agonist is the first step in signal transduction. The rate of the clustering process and the size of the clusters determine further cell responses. Here we aim to demonstrate that a simple 2-differential equation mathematical model is capable of quantitative description of the kinetics of 2D or 3D cluster formation in various processes. Three mathematical models based on mass action kinetics were considered and compared with each other by their ability to describe experimental data on GPVI or CR3 receptor clustering (2D) and albumin or platelet aggregation (3D) in response to activation. The models were able to successfully describe experimental data without losing accuracy after switching between complex and simple models. However, additional restrictions on parameter values are required to match a single set of parameters for the given experimental data. The extended clustering model captured several properties of the kinetics of cluster formation, such as the existence of only three typical steady states for this system: unclustered receptors, receptor dimers, and clusters. Therefore, a simple kinetic mass-action-law-based model could be utilized to adequately describe clustering in response to activation both in 2D and in 3D. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/32604803\n\nDavid2008 - Genome-scale metabolic network of Aspergillus nidulans (iHD666): MODEL1507180016 â v0.0.1\n\nDavid2008 - Genome-scale metabolic network of Aspergillus nidulans (iHD666)This model is described in the article: [Anaâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nBACKGROUND: Aspergillus nidulans is a member of a diverse group of filamentous fungi, sharing many of the properties of its close relatives with significance in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry. Furthermore, A. nidulans has been a classical model organism for studies of development biology and gene regulation, and thus it has become one of the best-characterized filamentous fungi. It was the first Aspergillus species to have its genome sequenced, and automated gene prediction tools predicted 9,451 open reading frames (ORFs) in the genome, of which less than 10% were assigned a function. RESULTS: In this work, we have manually assigned functions to 472 orphan genes in the metabolism of A. nidulans, by using a pathway-driven approach and by employing comparative genomics tools based on sequence similarity. The central metabolism of A. nidulans, as well as biosynthetic pathways of relevant secondary metabolites, was reconstructed based on detailed metabolic reconstructions available for A. niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and information on the genetics, biochemistry and physiology of A. nidulans. Thereby, it was possible to identify metabolic functions without a gene associated, and to look for candidate ORFs in the genome of A. nidulans by comparing its sequence to sequences of well-characterized genes in other species encoding the function of interest. A classification system, based on defined criteria, was developed for evaluating and selecting the ORFs among the candidates, in an objective and systematic manner. The functional assignments served as a basis to develop a mathematical model, linking 666 genes (both previously and newly annotated) to metabolic roles. The model was used to simulate metabolic behavior and additionally to integrate, analyze and interpret large-scale gene expression data concerning a study on glucose repression, thereby providing a means of upgrading the information content of experimental data and getting further insight into this phenomenon in A. nidulans. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate how pathway modeling of A. nidulans can be used as an approach to improve the functional annotation of the genome of this organism. Furthermore we show how the metabolic model establishes functional links between genes, enabling the upgrade of the information content of transcriptome data. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/18405346\n\nDay2015 - Early cellular innate and adaptive immune responses to ischemia/reperfusion injury and solid organ allotransplantation: MODEL1911190001 â v0.0.1\n\nThis is an ordinary differential equation model of the early inflammatory response during transplantion. Descriptions arâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nA mathematical model of the early inflammatory response in transplantation is formulated with ordinary differential equations. We first consider the inflammatory events associated only with the initial surgical procedure and the subsequent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) events that cause tissue damage to the host as well as the donor graft. These events release damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), thereby initiating an acute inflammatory response. In simulations of this model, resolution of inflammation depends on the severity of the tissue damage caused by these events and the patient's (co)-morbidities. We augment a portion of a previously published mathematical model of acute inflammation with the inflammatory effects of T cells in the absence of antigenic allograft mismatch (but with DAMP release proportional to the degree of graft damage prior to transplant). Finally, we include the antigenic mismatch of the graft, which leads to the stimulation of potent memory T cell responses, leading to further DAMP release from the graft and concomitant increase in allograft damage. Regulatory mechanisms are also included at the final stage. Our simulations suggest that surgical injury and I/R-induced graft damage can be well-tolerated by the recipient when each is present alone, but that their combination (along with antigenic mismatch) may lead to acute rejection, as seen clinically in a subset of patients. An emergent phenomenon from our simulations is that low-level DAMP release can tolerize the recipient to a mismatched allograft, whereas different restimulation regimens resulted in an exaggerated rejection response, in agreement with published studies. We suggest that mechanistic mathematical models might serve as an adjunct for patient- or sub-group-specific predictions, simulated clinical studies, and rational design of immunosuppression. link: http://identifiers.org/doi/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00484\n\ndeBack2012 - Lineage Specification in Pancreas Development: BIOMD0000000435 â v0.0.1\n\ndeBack2012 - Lineage Specification in Pancreas DevelopmentThis model of two neighbouring pancreas precursor cells, descrâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nThe cell fate decision of multi-potent pancreatic progenitor cells between the exocrine and endocrine lineages is regulated by Notch signalling, mediated by cell-cell interactions. However, canonical models of Notch-mediated lateral inhibition cannot explain the scattered spatial distribution of endocrine cells and the cell-type ratio in the developing pancreas. Based on evidence from acinar-to-islet cell transdifferentiation in vitro, we propose that lateral stabilization, i.e. positive feedback between adjacent progenitor cells, acts in parallel with lateral inhibition to regulate pattern formation in the pancreas. A simple mathematical model of transcriptional regulation and cell-cell interaction reveals the existence of multi-stability of spatial patterns whose simultaneous occurrence causes scattering of endocrine cells in the presence of noise. The scattering pattern allows for control of the endocrine-to-exocrine cell-type ratio by modulation of lateral stabilization strength. These theoretical results suggest a previously unrecognized role for lateral stabilization in lineage specification, spatial patterning and cell-type ratio control in organ development. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/23193107\n\nParameters:\n\nNameDescriptionk1=1.0Reaction: species_4 => ; species_4, Rate Law: compartment_1*k1*species_4b=21.0; theta=1.0E-4; c=1.0; n=4.0Reaction: => species_2; species_2, species_4, species_1, species_2, species_4, species_1, Rate Law: compartment_1*(theta+b*(species_2*species_4)^n)/(theta+c*species_1^n+b*(species_2*species_4)^n)a=1.0; theta=1.0E-4; n=4.0Reaction: => species_3; species_1, species_1, Rate Law: compartment_1*theta/(theta+a*species_1^n)\n\nStates:\n\nNameDescriptionspecies 2[Pancreas transcription factor 1 subunit alpha]species 3[Neurogenin-3]species 1[Neurogenin-3]species 4[Pancreas transcription factor 1 subunit alpha]\n\nDeCaluwe2016 - Circadian Clock: BIOMD0000000631 â v0.0.1\n\nDeCaluwÃ©2016 - Circadian ClockThis model is described in the article: [A Compact Model for the Complex Plant Circadianâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nThe circadian clock is an endogenous timekeeper that allows organisms to anticipate and adapt to the daily variations of their environment. The plant clock is an intricate network of interlocked feedback loops, in which transcription factors regulate each other to generate oscillations with expression peaks at specific times of the day. Over the last decade, mathematical modeling approaches have been used to understand the inner workings of the clock in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Those efforts have produced a number of models of ever increasing complexity. Here, we present an alternative model that combines a low number of equations and parameters, similar to the very earliest models, with the complex network structure found in more recent ones. This simple model describes the temporal evolution of the abundance of eight clock gene mRNA/protein and captures key features of the clock on a qualitative level, namely the entrained and free-running behaviors of the wild type clock, as well as the defects found in knockout mutants (such as altered free-running periods, lack of entrainment, or changes in the expression of other clock genes). Additionally, our model produces complex responses to various light cues, such as extreme photoperiods and non-24 h environmental cycles, and can describe the control of hypocotyl growth by the clock. Our model constitutes a useful tool to probe dynamical properties of the core clock as well as clock-dependent processes. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/26904049\n\nParameters:\n\nNameDescriptionK12 = 0.56; g2 = 0.12Reaction: => hypocotyl; PIF_p, Rate Law: g2*PIF_p^2/(K12^2+PIF_p^2)k3 = 0.56Reaction: P51_m =>, Rate Law: k3*P51_mK5 = 0.3; K4 = 0.23; v2A = 1.27Reaction: => P97_m; P51_p, EL_p, Rate Law: v2A/(1+(P51_p/K4)^2+(EL_p/K5)^2)d3D = 0.48; D = 0.0Reaction: P51_p =>, Rate Law: d3D*D*P51_pp5 = 0.62Reaction: => PIF_p; PIF_m, Rate Law: p5*PIF_mp1 = 0.76Reaction: => CL_p; CL_m, Rate Law: p1*CL_mk1D = 0.21; D = 0.0Reaction: CL_m =>, Rate Law: k1D*D*CL_mp3 = 0.64Reaction: => P51_p; P51_m, Rate Law: p3*P51_mK2 = 1.18; v1 = 4.58; K1 = 0.16Reaction: => CL_m; P51_p, P97_p, Rate Law: v1/(1+(P97_p/K1)^2+(P51_p/K2)^2)d5D = 0.52; D = 0.0Reaction: PIF_p =>, Rate Law: d5D*D*PIF_pd2D = 0.5; D = 0.0Reaction: P97_p =>, Rate Law: d2D*D*P97_pk4 = 0.57Reaction: EL_m =>, Rate Law: k4*EL_mL = 1.0; d2L = 0.29Reaction: P97_p =>, Rate Law: d2L*L*P97_pL = 1.0; d5L = 4.0Reaction: PIF_p =>, Rate Law: d5L*L*PIF_pK2 = 1.18; L = 1.0; v1L = 3.0; K1 = 0.16Reaction: => CL_m; P51_p, P97_p, P, Rate Law: v1L*L*P/(1+(P97_p/K1)^2+(P51_p/K2)^2)K8 = 0.36; L = 1.0; v4 = 1.47; K10 = 1.9; K9 = 1.9Reaction: => EL_m; P51_p, CL_p, EL_p, Rate Law: L*v4/(1+(CL_p/K8)^2+(P51_p/K9)^2+(EL_p/K10)^2)v3 = 1.0; K7 = 2.0; K6 = 0.46Reaction: => P51_m; P51_p, CL_p, Rate Law: v3/(1+(CL_p/K6)^2+(P51_p/K7)^2)d4D = 1.21; D = 0.0Reaction: EL_p =>, Rate Law: d4D*D*EL_pd4L = 0.38; L = 1.0Reaction: EL_p =>, Rate Law: d4L*L*EL_pp2 = 1.01Reaction: => P97_p; P97_m, Rate Law: p2*P97_mD = 0.0Reaction: => P, Rate Law: 0.3*(1-P)*DL = 1.0; p1L = 0.42Reaction: => CL_p; CL_m, Rate Law: p1L*L*CL_mp4 = 1.01Reaction: => EL_p; EL_m, Rate Law: p4*EL_mL = 1.0Reaction: P =>, Rate Law: P*Lv5 = 0.1; K11 = 0.21Reaction: => PIF_m; EL_p, Rate Law: v5/(1+(EL_p/K11)^2)d3L = 0.78; L = 1.0Reaction: P51_p =>, Rate Law: d3L*L*P51_pv2L = 5.0; L = 1.0; K5 = 0.3; K4 = 0.23Reaction: => P97_m; P51_p, EL_p, P, Rate Law: v2L*L*P/(1+(P51_p/K4)^2+(EL_p/K5)^2)d1 = 0.68Reaction: CL_p =>, Rate Law: d1*CL_pg1 = 0.01Reaction: => hypocotyl, Rate Law: g1k2 = 0.35Reaction: P97_m =>, Rate Law: k2*P97_mv2B = 1.48; K5 = 0.3; K3 = 0.24; K4 = 0.23Reaction: => P97_m; P51_p, CL_p, EL_p, Rate Law: v2B*CL_p^2/(K3^2+CL_p^2)/(1+(P51_p/K4)^2+(EL_p/K5)^2)k5 = 0.14Reaction: PIF_m =>, Rate Law: k5*PIF_mL = 1.0; k1L = 0.53Reaction: CL_m =>, Rate Law: k1L*L*CL_m\n\nStates:\n\nNameDescriptionCL p[Protein LHY; Protein CCA1]P97 p[Two-component response regulator-like APRR9; Two-component response regulator-like APRR7]EL p[Transcription factor LUX; Protein EARLY FLOWERING 4]EL m[823817; 818596]P[Transcription factor PIF3; Transcription factor PIL1]PIF m[825075; 818903]PIF p[Transcription factor PIF5; Transcription factor PIF4]P51 m[836259; 832518]hypocotyl[hypocotyl]P51 p[Two-component response regulator-like APRR1; Two-component response regulator-like APRR5]P97 m[831793; 819292]CL m[839341; 819296]\n\nDecroly1982_Enzymatic_Oscillator: BIOMD0000000319 â v0.0.1\n\nThis is the scaled model described in the article: **Birhythmicity, chaos, and other patterns of temporal self-organizaâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nWe analyze on a model biochemical system the effect of a coupling between two instability-generating mechanisms. The system considered is that of two allosteric enzymes coupled in series and activated by their respective products. In addition to simple periodic oscillations, the system can exhibit a variety of new modes of dynamic behavior; coexistence between two stable periodic regimes (birhythmicity), random oscillations (chaos), and coexistence of a stable periodic regime with a stable steady state (hard excitation) or with chaos. The relationship between these patterns of temporal self-organization is analyzed as a function of the control parameters of the model. Chaos and birhythmicity appear to be rare events in comparison with simple periodic behavior.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the system of cell-cycle control based on the transcriptional regulation of the expression of specific genes is responsible for the transition between programs. These groups of functionally connected genes from so-called gene networks characterized by numerous feedbacks and a complex behavioral dynamics. Computer simulation methods have been applied to studying the dynamics of gene networks regulating the cell cycle of vertebrates. The data on the regulation of the key genes obtained from the CYCLE-TRRD database have been used as a basis to construct gene networks of different degrees of complexity controlling the G1/S transition, one of the most important stages of the cell cycle. The behavior dynamics of the model constructed has been analyzed. Two qualitatively different functional modes of the system has been obtained. It has also been shown that the transition between these modes depends on the duration of the proliferation signal. It has also been demonstrated that the additional feedback from factor E2F to genes c-fos and c-jun, which was predicted earlier based on the computer analysis of promoters, plays an important role in the transition of the cell to the S phase. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/14582399\n\nParameters:\n\nNameDescriptionphi6 = 0.1Reaction: y6 =>, Rate Law: phi6*y6phi1 = 0.1Reaction: y1 =>, Rate Law: phi1*y1k4i = 1.0Reaction: y4 => y5, Rate Law: k4i*y4*y5emax = 2.0; k1 = 1.0; k1_prime = 1.0; k1_double_prime = 10.0Reaction: => y1; y2, Rate Law: emax*k1*y1/(k1*y1+(k1_prime+k1_double_prime*y1)*y2)k4 = 0.09Reaction: => y4; y1, Rate Law: k4*y1k4_double_prime = 0.1Reaction: => y4; y6, Rate Law: k4_double_prime*y6k4a = 2.0Reaction: y5 => y4, Rate Law: k4a*y5phi2 = 0.01Reaction: y2 =>, Rate Law: phi2*y2F6 = 0.044Reaction: => y6, Rate Law: F6k6 = 0.0Reaction: => y6; y1, Rate Law: k6*y1phi4a = 0.01Reaction: y5 =>, Rate Law: phi4a*y5k2 = 1.0Reaction: => y2; y1, Rate Law: k2*y1k3 = 0.4Reaction: y2 => y3; y5, Rate Law: k3*y2*y5phi4i = 0.01Reaction: y4 =>, Rate Law: phi4i*y4phi3 = 0.1Reaction: y3 =>, Rate Law: phi3*y3\n\nStates:\n\nNameDescriptiony3[Retinoblastoma-associated protein]y1[Transcription factor E2F1]y4[Cyclin-dependent kinase 2; G1/S-specific cyclin-E1]y2[Retinoblastoma-associated protein]y6[Transcription factor AP-1]y5[Cyclin-dependent kinase 2; G1/S-specific cyclin-E1]\n\nDel_Conte_Zerial2008_Rab5_Rab7_cut_out_switch: BIOMD0000000174 â v0.0.1\n\nKey cellular functions and developmental processes rely on cascades of GTPases.

Thanks go to Barbara Szomolay and Lutz Brusch for finding and clarifying this. According to Dr. Brusch this model represents the mechanism identified by the qualitative analysis in the article in the scenario deemed most useful by the authors. For the time-course simulations it was necessary to add a time dependency to one of the parameters, which is only verbally described in the article.\n\nAs argued in the publication the switch between early and late endosomes can be triggered by a parameter change. While with fixed parameter values each switch just converges to one steady state from its initial conditions and stays there, endosomes should switch between two different states. These changes would in reality of course depend on many different factors, such as cargo composition and amount in the specific endosome, its location and some additional cellular control mechanisms and encompass many different parameters. To keep the model simple the authors chose to add a time dependency to only one reaction - ke in the activation of RAB5 is multiplied with a term monotonously increasing over time from 0 to 1. They also hard coded a time dependence in this term, 100 minutes, to make the switch occur after several hundred minutes. As long as this modulating term remains monotonic all resulting time courses should look similar, with the switching behavior depending on the initial conditions and whether the term is increasing or decreasing. Monotonic increase is a reasonable assumption for the described mechanism of cargo accumulation.\n\nNot explicitly described in the article:\n\nactivation of Rab5 (time): $r*ke*time/(100+time)/(1+e_{(kg-R)*kf})$ instead of $r*ke/(1+e_{(kg-R)*kf})$\n\nThis model originates from BioModels Database: A Database of Annotated Published Models.

Incorporating this biomass function into a stoichiometric metabolic model of the human lung cell and applying metabolic flux balance analysis, we identified host-based metabolic perturbations inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 reproduction. Our results highlight reactions in the central metabolism, as well as amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways. By incorporating host cellular maintenance into the model based on available protein expression data from human lung cells, we find that only few of these metabolic perturbations are able to selectively inhibit virus reproduction. Some of the catalysing enzymes of such reactions have demonstrated interactions with existing drugs, which can be used for experimental testing of the presented predictions using gene knockouts and RNA interference techniques. In summary, the developed computational approach offers a platform for rapid, experimentally testable generation of drug predictions against existing and emerging viruses based on their biomass requirements.t only few of these metabolic perturbations are able to selectively inhibit virus reproduction.

In this study, we employed a systems biology approach to develop a dynamic model of vertebrate rod phototransduction that accounts for the details of the underlying biochemistry. Following a bottom-up strategy, we first reproduced the results of a robust model developed by Hamer et al. (Vis. Neurosci., 2005, 22(4), 417), and then added a number of additional cascade reactions including: (a) explicit reactions to simulate the interaction between the activated effector and the regulator of G-protein signalling (RGS); (b) a reaction for the reformation of the G-protein from separate subunits; (c) a reaction for rhodopsin (R) reconstitution from the association of the opsin apoprotein with the 11-cis-retinal chromophore; (d) reactions for the slow activation of the cascade by opsin. The extended network structure successfully reproduced a number of experimental conditions that were inaccessible to prior models. With a single set of parameters the model was able to predict qualitative and quantitative features of rod photoresponses to light stimuli ranging over five orders of magnitude, in normal and altered conditions, including genetic manipulations of the cascade components. In particular, the model reproduced the salient dynamic features of the rod from Rpe65(-/-) animals, a well established model for Leber congenital amaurosis and vitamin A deficiency. The results of this study suggest that a systems-level approach can help to unravel the adaptation mechanisms in normal and in disease-associated conditions on a molecular basis. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/19756313\n\nParameters:\n\nNameDescriptionkGshutoff = 0.05Reaction: Ga_GTP => Ga_GDP, Rate Law: kGshutoff*Ga_GTPkGrecyc = 2.0Reaction: Ga_GDP + Gbg => Gt, Rate Law: kGrecyc*Gbg*Ga_GDPkRec3 = 9.68777;

Available clinical data indicate a lack of dose-bronchodilatory response during initial treatment, with a dose response developing after ~1-2 weeks. We developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model to understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon. The model described the release, maturation, and trafficking of eosinophils into the airways, leukotriene synthesis by the 5LO enzyme, leukotriene signaling and bronchodilation, and the PK of zileuton. The model provided a plausible explanation for the two-phase bronchodilatory effect of zileuton-the short-term bronchodilation was due to leukotriene inhibition and the long-term bronchodilation was due to inflammatory cell infiltration blockade. The model also indicated that the theoretical maximum bronchodilation of both 5LO inhibition and leukotriene receptor blockade is likely similar. QSP modeling provided interesting insights into the effects of leukotriene modulation.CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology (2013) 2, e74; doi:10.1038/psp.2013.49; advance online publication 11 September 2013. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/24026253\n\nParameters:\n\nNameDescriptionFLO3_b = 0.0;

Demir SS, Clark JW, Murphey CRâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nA mathematical model for the electrophysiological responses of a rabbit sinoatrial node cell that is based on whole cell recordings from enzymatically isolated single pacemaker cells at 37 degrees C has been developed. The ion channels, Na(+)-K+ and Ca2+ pumps, and Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger in the surface membrane (sarcolemma) are described using equations for these known currents in mammalian pacemaker cells. The extracellular environment is treated as a diffusion-limited space, and the myoplasm contains Ca(2+)-binding proteins (calmodulin and troponin). Original features of this model include 1) new equations for the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, 2) assessment of the role of the transient-type Ca2+ current during pacemaker depolarization, 3) inclusion of an Na+ current based on recent experimental data, and 4) demonstration of the possible influence of pump and exchanger currents and background currents on the pacemaker rate. This model provides acceptable fits to voltage-clamp and action potential data and can be used to seek biophysically based explanations of the electrophysiological activity in the rabbit sinoatrial node cell. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/8166247\n\nDemir1999_SinoatrialNodeActivity_Heart: MODEL0912940495 â v0.0.1\n\nThis a model from the article: Parasympathetic modulation of sinoatrial node pacemaker activity in rabbit heart: a uniâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nWe have extended our compartmental model [Am. J. Physiol. 266 (Cell Physiol. 35): C832-C852, 1994] of the single rabbit sinoatrial node (SAN) cell so that it can simulate cellular responses to bath applications of ACh and isoprenaline as well as the effects of neuronally released ACh. The model employs three different types of muscarinic receptors to explain the variety of responses observed in mammalian cardiac pacemaking cells subjected to vagal stimulation. The response of greatest interest is the ACh-sensitive change in cycle length that is not accompanied by a change in action potential duration or repolarization or hyperpolarization of the maximum diastolic potential. In this case, an ACh-sensitive K+ current is not involved. Membrane hyperpolarization occurs in response to much higher levels of vagal stimulation, and this response is also mimicked by the model. Here, an ACh-sensitive K+ current is involved. The well-known phase-resetting response of the SAN cell to single and periodically applied vagal bursts of impulses is also simulated in the presence and absence of the beta-agonist isoprenaline. Finally, the responses of the SAN cell to longer continuous trains of periodic vagal stimulation are simulated, and this can result in the complete cessation of pacemaking. Therefore, this model is 1) applicable over the full range of intensity and pattern of vagal input and 2) can offer biophysically based explanations for many of the phenomena associated with the autonomic control of cardiac pacemaking. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/10362707\n\nDempsher1984_ACTH_CortisolSecretion: MODEL0912835813 â v0.0.1\n\nThis a model from the article: A mechanistic model of ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion. Dempsher DP, Gann DS, Phaiâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nAdrenal secretory rates of cortisol and arterial concentrations of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) were measured in conscious trained dogs subjected to intravenous infusion of ACTH. To investigate the causal relation of ACTH to the secretion of cortisol, a mechanistic mathematical model based on current hypotheses of adrenocortical function was constructed and tested. It is widely believed that ACTH stimulates cortisol secretion through adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), which provides substrate cholesterol by activating cholesterol ester hydrolase and facilitating transport of cholesterol to the side-chain cleavage enzyme. In addition, cholesterol modulates its own synthesis by inhibiting beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase in the adrenocortical cell. These and other steps in the biosynthetic reaction sequence were described using differential equations subject to the additional constraints imposed by available measurements of intracellular quantities. The resulting model is consistent with many of the known characteristics of the canine adrenal response to ACTH. In this model, steady-state nonlinearities arise from cooperative binding of cAMP to its receptor protein and saturation of mitochondrial pregnenolone transport. The transient response is dominated by a depletable pool of intracellular free cholesterol. Other inferences based on the model are presented, and a quantifiable cellular basis for increased adrenal sensitivity to ACTH is proposed. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/6326602\n\nden Breems2015 - macrophage in cancer: BIOMD0000000759 â v0.0.1\n\nThe paper describes a model of re-polarisation of M2 and M1 macrophages and its role on cancer outcomes. Created by COPâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nThe anti-tumour and pro-tumour roles of Th1/Th2 immune cells and M1/M2 macrophages have been documented by numerous experimental studies. However, it is still unknown how these immune cells interact with each other to control tumour dynamics. Here, we use a mathematical model for the interactions between mouse melanoma cells, Th2/Th1 cells and M2/M1 macrophages, to investigate the unknown role of the re-polarisation between M1 and M2 macrophages on tumour growth. The results show that tumour growth is associated with a type-II immune response described by large numbers of Th2 and M2 cells. Moreover, we show that (i) the ratio k of the transition rates k12 (for the re-polarisation M1âM2) and k21 (for the re-polarisation M2âM1) is important in reducing tumour population, and (ii) the particular values of these transition rates control the delay in tumour growth and the final tumour size. We also perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of various model parameters on changes in the tumour cell population, and confirm that the ratio k alone and the ratio of M2 and M1 macrophage populations at earlier times (e.g., day 7) cannot always predict the final tumour size. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/26551154\n\nParameters:\n\nNameDescriptionrh2 = 9.0E-6 1/d; bth = 1.0E8 1Reaction: => Th2; M2, Th1, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*rh2*M2*Th2*(1-(Th2+Th1)/bth)ah2 = 0.008 1/dReaction: => Th2; M2, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*ah2*M2dh1 = 0.05 1/dReaction: Th1 =>, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*dh1*Th1dm2 = 0.2 1/dReaction: M2 =>, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*dm2*M2ah1 = 0.008 1/dReaction: => Th1; M1, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*ah1*M1as = 1.0E-6 1/d; am1 = 5.0E-8 1/d; bm = 100000.0 1Reaction: => M1; Ts, Th1, M2, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*(as*Ts+am1*Th1)*M1*(1-(M1+M2)/bm)rh1 = 9.0E-6 1/d; bth = 1.0E8 1Reaction: => Th1; M1, Th2, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*rh1*M1*Th1*(1-(Th1+Th2)/bth)k21 = 4.0E-5 1/dReaction: M2 => M1, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*k21*M2*M1dmn = 2.0E-6 1/dReaction: Tn => ; M1, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*dmn*M1*Tnr = 0.565 1/d; bt = 2.0E9 1Reaction: => Tn; Ts, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*r*Tn*(1-(Tn+Ts)/bt)rmn = 1.0E-7 1/dReaction: => Tn; M2, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*rmn*Tn*M2dh2 = 0.05 1/dReaction: Th2 =>, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*dh2*Th2dm1 = 0.2 1/dReaction: M1 =>, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*dm1*M1an = 5.0E-8 1/d; bm = 100000.0 1; am2 = 5.0E-8 1/dReaction: => M2; Tn, Th2, M1, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*(an*Tn+am2*Th2)*M2*(1-(M2+M1)/bm)dms = 2.0E-6 1/dReaction: Ts => ; M1, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*dms*M1*Tsdts = 5.3E-8 1/dReaction: Ts => ; Th1, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*dts*Th1*Tsk12 = 5.0E-5 1/dReaction: M1 => M2, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*k12*M1*M2ksn = 0.1 1/dReaction: Ts => Tn, Rate Law: tumor_microenvironment*ksn*Ts\n\nStates:\n\nNameDescriptionM2[M2 Macrophage]M1[M1 Macrophage]Ts[malignant cell]Tn[malignant cell]Th2[T-helper 2 cell]Th1[T-helper 1 cell]\n\ndeOliveiraDalMolin2010 - Genome-scale metabolic network of Arabidopsis thaliana (AraGEM): MODEL1507180028 â v0.0.1\n\ndeOliveiraDalMolin2010 - Genome-scale metabolic network of Arabidopsis thaliana (AraGEM)This model is described in the aâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nGenome-scale metabolic network models have been successfully used to describe metabolism in a variety of microbial organisms as well as specific mammalian cell types and organelles. This systems-based framework enables the exploration of global phenotypic effects of gene knockouts, gene insertion, and up-regulation of gene expression. We have developed a genome-scale metabolic network model (AraGEM) covering primary metabolism for a compartmentalized plant cell based on the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome. AraGEM is a comprehensive literature-based, genome-scale metabolic reconstruction that accounts for the functions of 1,419 unique open reading frames, 1,748 metabolites, 5,253 gene-enzyme reaction-association entries, and 1,567 unique reactions compartmentalized into the cytoplasm, mitochondrion, plastid, peroxisome, and vacuole. The curation process identified 75 essential reactions with respective enzyme associations not assigned to any particular gene in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes or AraCyc. With the addition of these reactions, AraGEM describes a functional primary metabolism of Arabidopsis. The reconstructed network was transformed into an in silico metabolic flux model of plant metabolism and validated through the simulation of plant metabolic functions inferred from the literature. Using efficient resource utilization as the optimality criterion, AraGEM predicted the classical photorespiratory cycle as well as known key differences between redox metabolism in photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic plant cells. AraGEM is a viable framework for in silico functional analysis and can be used to derive new, nontrivial hypotheses for exploring plant metabolism. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/20044452\n\nDePaor1986_CirculatoryAutoregulation: MODEL1172940336 â v0.0.1\n\nThis a model from the article: A feedback oscillator model for circulatory autoregulation Annraoi M.

We prove that all orbits are bounded and must converge to one of several possible equilibrium points. Therefore, the long-term behavior of an orbit is classified according to the basin of attraction in which it starts. The addition of a drug term to the system can move the solution trajectory into a desirable basin of attraction. We show that the solutions of the model with a time-varying drug term approach the solutions of the system without the drug once traatment has stopped. We present numerical experiments in which optimal control therapy is able to drive the system into a desirable basin of attraction, whereas traditional pulsed chemotherapy is not.\n\nVolume 37, Issue 11, June 2003, Pages 1221-1244 link: http://identifiers.org/doi/10.1016/S0895-7177(03)00133-X\n\nParameters:\n\nNameDescriptiond2 = 1.0Reaction: u =>, Rate Law: compartment*d2*uv = 0.0Reaction: => u, Rate Law: compartment*valpha = 0.3; s = 0.33; p = 0.01Reaction: => I; T, Rate Law: compartment*(s+p*I*T/(alpha+T))b1 = 1.0; r1 = 1.5Reaction: => T, Rate Law: compartment*r1*T*(1-b1*T)c2 = 0.5; c3 = 1.0; a2 = 0.3Reaction: T => ; I, N, u, Rate Law: compartment*(c2*I*T+c3*T*N+a2*(1-exp(-u))*T)d1 = 0.2; c1 = 1.0; a1 = 0.2Reaction: I => ; T, u, Rate Law: compartment*(c1*I*T+d1*I+a1*(1-exp(-u))*I)b2 = 1.0; r2 = 1.0Reaction: => N, Rate Law: compartment*r2*N*(1-b2*N)a3 = 0.1; c4 = 1.0Reaction: N => ; T, u, Rate Law: compartment*(c4*T*N+a3*(1-exp(-u))*N)\n\nStates:\n\nNameDescriptionI[C12735]T[Neoplastic Cell]NNu[C2252]\n\ndePillis2005 - A validated mathematical model of cell-mediated immune response to tumor growth: MODEL1907260001 â v0.0.1\n\nThis model describes interactions between a tumour and the immune system, with specific emphasis on the role of naturalâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nMathematical models of tumor-immune interactions provide an analytic framework in which to address specific questions about tumor-immune dynamics. We present a new mathematical model that describes tumor-immune interactions, focusing on the role of natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells in tumor surveillance, with the goal of understanding the dynamics of immune-mediated tumor rejection. The model describes tumor-immune cell interactions using a system of differential equations. The functions describing tumor-immune growth, response, and interaction rates, as well as associated variables, are developed using a least-squares method combined with a numerical differential equations solver. Parameter estimates and model validations use data from published mouse and human studies. Specifically, CD8+ T-tumor and NK-tumor lysis data from chromium release assays as well as in vivo tumor growth data are used. A variable sensitivity analysis is done on the model. The new functional forms developed show that there is a clear distinction between the dynamics of NK and CD8+ T cells. Simulations of tumor growth using different levels of immune stimulating ligands, effector cells, and tumor challenge are able to reproduce data from the published studies. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the variable to which the model is most sensitive is patient specific, and can be measured with a chromium release assay. The variable sensitivity analysis suggests that the model can predict which patients may positively respond to treatment. Computer simulations highlight the importance of CD8+ T-cell activation in cancer therapy. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/16140967\n\ndePillis2007 - Chemotherapy for tumors An analysis of the dynamics and a study of quadratic and linear optimal controls: MODEL2001160001 â v0.0.1\n\nAbstract We investigate a mathematical model of tumorâimmune interactions with chemotherapy, and strategies for optimaâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nWe investigate a mathematical model of tumor-immune interactions with chemotherapy, and strategies for optimally administering treatment. In this paper we analyze the dynamics of this model, characterize the optimal controls related to drug therapy, and discuss numerical results of the optimal strategies. The form of the model allows us to test and compare various optimal control strategies, including a quadratic control, a linear control, and a state-constraint. We establish the existence of the optimal control, and solve for the control in both the quadratic and linear case. In the linear control case, we show that we cannot rule out the possibility of a singular control. An interesting aspect of this paper is that we provide a graphical representation of regions on which the singular control is optimal. link: http://identifiers.org/pubmed/17306310\n\nParameters:\n\nNameDescriptiona = 0.002; b = 1.02E-9Reaction: => T, Rate Law: compartment*a*T*(1-b*T)K_L = 0.6; q = 3.42E-10; u = 3.0; m = 0.02Reaction: L => ; T, M, Rate Law: compartment*(m*L+q*L*T+u*L*L+K_L*M*L)gamma = 0.9Reaction: M =>, Rate Law: compartment*gamma*Malpha_1 = 13000.0; h = 600.0; g = 0.025; eta = 1.0Reaction: => N; T, Rate Law: compartment*(alpha_1+g*T^eta/(h+T^eta)*N)mu_I = 10.0Reaction: I =>, Rate Law: compartment*mu_I*Ip = 1.0E-7; f = 0.0412; K_N = 0.6Reaction: N => ; T, M, Rate Law: compartment*(f*N+p*N*T+K_N*M*N)V_M=0.0Reaction: => M, Rate Law: compartment*V_Malpha_2 = 5.0E8Reaction: => C, Rate Law: compartment*alpha_2beta = 0.012; K_C = 0.6Reaction: C => ; M, Rate Law: compartment*(beta*C+K_C*M*C)r2 = 3.0E-11; p_I = 0.125; V_L=0.0; g_I = 2.0E7Reaction: => L; C, T, I, Rate Law: compartment*(r2*C*T+p_I*L*I/(g_I+I)+V_L)V_I=0.0; w = 2.0E-4; g_T = 100000.0; p_T = 0.6Reaction: => I; T, L, Rate Law: compartment*(p_T*T/(g_T+T)*L+w*L*I+V_I)D = 6.6666657777779E-7; K_T = 0.8; c1 = 3.23E-7Reaction: T => ; N, M, Rate Law: compartment*(c1*N*T+D*T+K_T*M*T)\n\nStates:\n\nNameDescriptionI[Interleukin-2]T[neoplasm]M[Combination Chemotherapy]N[Immune Cell]C[C120462]L[cytotoxic T-lymphocyte]\n\ndePillis2007 - Seeking Bang Bang Solutions of Mixed ImmunoChemotherapy of Tumors: MODEL2003060001 â v0.0.1\n\nSEEKING BANG-BANG SOLUTIONS OF MIXED IMMUNO-CHEMOTHERAPY OF TUMORS LISETTE G. DE PILLIS, K. RENEE FISTER, WEIQING GU, CRâ¦\n\nDetails\n\nIt is known that a beneficial cancer treatment approach for a single patient often involves the administration of more than one type of therapy. The question of how best to combine multiple cancer therapies, however, is still open. In this study, we investigate the theoretical interaction of three treatment types (two biological therapies and one chemotherapy) with a growing cancer, and present an analysis of an optimal control strategy for administering all three therapies in combination. In the situations with controls introduced linearly, we find that there are conditions on which the controls exist singularly. Although bang-bang controls (on-off) reflect the drug treatment approach that is often implemented clinically, we have demonstrated, in the context of our mathematical model, that there can exist regions on which this may not be the best strategy for minimizing a tumor burden. We characterize the controls in singular regions by taking time derivatives of the switching functions. We will examine these representations and the conditions necessary for the controls to be minimizing in the singular region. We begin by assuming only one of the controls is singular on a given interval. Then we analyze the conditions on which a pair and then all three controls are singular. link: https://scholarship.claremont.edu/hmcfacpub/439/\n\ndePillis200"
