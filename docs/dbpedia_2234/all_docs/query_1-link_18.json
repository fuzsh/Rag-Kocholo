        "text": "2.1. Graph-Theoretical Representation of Reactions\n\nIn a given list of reactions (see Section 3 for details on their exploration), each reaction corresponds to a subgraph of the graph representation of the whole CRN. Therefore, the whole CRN is built by sequentially adding (parts) of such a subgraph. Two “reaction vertices” represent the TS structure of the reaction with the additional information from which side of the reaction the reactants approached the TS. Accordingly, they are labeled as “left-hand-side” (LHS) reaction vertex in case one starts from the reactants and “right-hand-side” (RHS) reaction vertex in case one starts from the products, although such an assignment is to a certain degree arbitrary and solely serves the purpose to allow for directional distinction. In our context, the way a reaction is formulated depends on how our reactions exploration software Chemoton stored the reaction in the database. The assignment itself does not alter the graph as reaction vertices are only connected to reactants and products of a reaction.\n\nNext, the reactants and products will be added to the graph as vertices if they have not already been included in the CRN yet. The added vertices are connected with directional edges where reactants are linked to the LHS reaction vertex and the LHS reaction vertex then to the products. In turn, the products are connected to the RHS reaction vertex and the RHS reaction vertex then to the reactants. The edges are directional to enforce the traversal from one side to the other as shown in .\n\nFurthermore, all edges contain an edge weight (measuring how costly it is to traverse this edge) and a list of required compounds. This list allows us to encode the information that, for instance, for a bimolecular reaction of the type A + A ⇌ B 2 equiv of A are required without altering the directed graph structure or introducing parallel edges. Additionally, edges toward reaction vertices contain the sum over the compound costs of the reagents in the required compounds list. Strictly speaking, the resulting graph contains two types of edges. However, the difference is a mere technicality and has no effect on the performance of the presented algorithms.\n\nAll of these terms are explained in detail in Section 2.2. A schematic representation of this architecture is shown in . This architecture allows us to encode any kind of reaction from the CRN in the graph, regardless of the number of involved reactants or emerging products.\n\nThe size of the graph measured in terms of the numbers of vertices and edges grows with each reaction added. At least two vertices will be added to the graph per reaction, if all occurring compounds are already part of the graph. The maximum number of added vertices per reaction is given by two plus the number of compounds of the reaction which are yet to be included in the existing graph. Concerning the number of edges per reaction, the reaction vertices have incoming edges equal to the reacting compounds and outgoing edges equal to the number of product compounds. Hence, the number of edges per added reaction is the number of compounds of the reaction times two.\n\nThe problem at hand is a shortest path problem; hence, a long edge indicates that the traversal via this edge is unfavorable. The length of an edge, i.e., the edge weight, is added as information to the edge when connecting the vertices as shown in . An edge with a large edge weight would therefore correspond to a long edge in a graphical representation. Furthermore, the list of compounds required for this reaction is added. This list will be key for the second step of our algorithm to determine the costs for consuming compounds during a shortest path search. In the final step of the Pathfinder pipeline to convert a CRN to a graph containing kinetic as well as stoichiometric information, the sum over all compound costs of the compounds in the list of required compounds is written to the edge as compound costs. This sum is then added to the existing edge weight and allows us to consider the cost of consuming the required compounds of each reaction when querying the resulting graph directly.\n\n2.2. Kinetic Weights\n\nThe initial weights for edges from compound vertices to reaction vertices, C/D → R and A/B → L, are based on the free activation energies, ΔGTS-LHS or ΔGTS-RHS, of the reaction. The free activation energies themselves are not suitable as edge weights as they are not reflecting the exponential character considering kinetics. Hence, the free activation energy is turned into a rate constant. The rate constant ki, denoting kLHS and kRHS of reaction i in a simplified notation, can be obtained according to Eyring’s absolute rate theory\n\n1\n\nwhere T is the temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant, h is Planck’s constant, and R is the ideal gas constant (accordingly, the energy difference is then to be given in energy units per mole substance).\n\nNote that the edge weights from reaction vertices to product vertices (e.g., L → C/D and R → A/B in ) are set to zero throughout this work as the reaction progress from the TS to the product is energetically downhill in an elementary step.\n\nSince rate constants are not directly suitable as edge weights in a shortest path problem (owing to the anticorrelation that large rates would correspond to short paths), we consider a few additional steps. Moreover, we note that rate constants can cover a large range of magnitudes, e.g., from 1 × 10–12 to 1 × 1012 s–1. Hence, when adding edge weights, very small weights will hardly affect the total sum if a large edge weight is already part of the path. A large range of weights is therefore disadvantageous for the rigorous assessment of the shortest path problem because paths going via different reactions besides one with a large edge weight would end up with the same length.\n\nThe correspondence of low reaction barrier to low edge weight as required for the shortest path problem could be solved by taking the inverse of ki, 1/ki [s]. A low barrier would then correspond to a short time (low weight) to traverse an edge, but the problem of a large spread for the edge weights remains. Hence, to minimize the spread we normalize each rate constant ki by the sum over all rate constants in the CRN to obtain the relative rate constant pi with\n\n2\n\nThis definition can be rationalized by recalling that the rate vi of a reaction i is given by\n\n3\n\nwhere cj are the (time-dependent) concentrations of the reactants. If all concentrations of all reactants are considered equal to 1 mol/L and time-independent, the rate vi will be simply given by the rate constant ki. This assumption may also be understood literally as a short-time approximation to a case, in which all compounds (also the stable intermediates usually produced only later in the course of a reaction starting from one or two reactants) are already available right from the start and at a concentration of 1 mol/L. This assumption is necessary to avoid explicit propagation of concentration flows through microkinetic modeling because this would be far too time-consuming. Under this short-time all-species-present assumption, the relative rate constant pi in a CRN is equal to the relative rate and can be interpreted as a measure for the likelihood or probability of the reaction step i to occur relative to all other reaction steps in the CRN. The probability of a sequence of reaction steps is the product of the individual reaction probabilities, assuming that each reaction is independent of all other reactions (cf. eq 2).\n\nSince a high probability of a path corresponds to a high likelihood that the path’s product is formed through this reaction sequence, it still contradicts the requirement of a low edge weight for a favorable shortest path. Therefore, we introduce a cost function f(pi)\n\n4\n\nwhich possesses the salient feature that it results in weights wi, which are additive to yield a total weight (instead of multiplicative probabilities that yield a total probability)\n\n5\n\nwhere wtot is the total weight or length of a path and ptot is its total probability. Note in this context that shortest-path algorithms typically sum over the weight of edges to determine a shortest path.36 The edge weights wi are given in arbitrary units abbreviated as a.u. throughout this work. We call these weights derived from activation barriers entering our definition of the cost function kinetic weights.\n\n2.3. Compound Costs\n\nIf a compound can only be reached through reactions with high barriers, it may be unlikely that it can be formed under certain reaction conditions. This fact must be considered when consuming the compound in another reaction, for which it will simply not be available. Hence, querying a CRN which encodes only the kinetic weights as edge weights would lack information about the stoichiometric requirement that compound C produced from compound A requires compound B as reactant in our example in . To take this into account, we introduce a compound costci in arbitrary units (a.u.) for every compound i in the graph. For one edge from a compound vertex to a reaction vertex, the additional costs caused by consuming the required compounds are encoded as the sum over the compound costs of all compounds required for a reaction. This sum of costs added to the edge weight wi\n\n6\n\nresults in wi′. wi′ of an edge i is calculated on-the-fly when searching for the shortest path for determining the compound costs, the graph itself is not altered yet. A compound cost ci is defined as the shortest path from one of the starting compounds to compound i, considering the kinetic weight and the sum of compound costs of the required compounds\n\n7\n\nwhere cstart corresponds to the compound cost of the path’s starting compound. As the determination of the compound cost ci requires other compound costs, the costs must be determined iteratively, given the CRN and the starting conditions, to obtain self-consistent compound costs, ci,sc. Hence, eq 7 is rewritten as\n\n8\n\nwhere n indicates the current iteration step.\n\nThe algorithm to determine the compound costs is outlined in . To determine the required compound costs for all compounds in the CRN, we define starting conditions by assigning compound costs to selected starting compounds. These compounds are those compounds available at the initialization of a reactive system under consideration, similar to reactants present in a flask at the beginning of a reaction in an experiment.\n\nWhen calculating costs of all other compounds, denoted here as “unknown compounds”, the results will depend on the chosen starting compounds and their costs. Hence, one can end up with different compound costs by choosing different starting conditions. Before starting the first iteration, all unknown compounds are assigned an infinite positive cost\n\n9\n\nand with the compound costs for the starting compounds, all compounds have a ci,0 in arbitrary units (a.u.) assigned. Then, the algorithm starts an outer loop over the set of starting compounds, the first iteration (n = 1), and an inner loop over all unknown compounds.\n\nThe shortest path from a starting compound to a target compound is found with Dijkstra’s algorithm.21 In principle, any other algorithm to determine the shortest path between the two compounds could be employed.\n\nIf compounds of infinite costs would need to be consumed along the shortest path to a target compound, the algorithm stops any further analysis of this path and instead continues to find a path for the next target compound. If the shortest path does not require consumption of compounds with infinite cost, the compound cost of the starting compound is added to the current total path weight (see eq 8) resulting in ci,n′ for the target compound i. The current total weight ci,n′ is calculated as stated in eq 8. Employing compound costs of the previous iteration ensures that the order of compounds analyzed is not relevant during an iteration over all compounds. The current total weight ci,n′ for the target compound i will be defined as ci,n ≔ ci,n′ if ci,n′ < ci,n–1 and, if ci,n has been previously defined, ci,n′ < ci,n.\n\nAfter iterating over all starting compounds, the compound costs of the current iteration are completed with ci,n–1 for all compounds where the condition ci,n′ < ci,n–1 was not met. This guarantees that all compounds have a cost assigned for a possible subsequent iteration step.\n\nFinally, it is inquired whether the costs of the compounds have converged. Convergence will be achieved if all compounds have costs smaller than the assigned infinite value and self-consistency in the costs is reached. Self-consistency is achieved if none of the compound costs were altered in the current iteration. The loop over the starting compounds is restarted until convergence. Upon convergence, all compounds have costs assigned characterizing the length of the shortest paths from a starting compound to them and we achieve convergence, i.e.\n\n10\n\nfor all compounds i, i ∈ unknown compounds.\n\n4.2. Exploration of I2 with H2O\n\nWe now turn to a CRN produced with our Chemoton exploration software. The underlying raw data of the CRN was obtained from quantum mechanical calculations whose details are given in Section 3. The Chemoton-driven first-principles exploration was guided on-the-fly by the ranking of compounds provided by Pathfinder. The initial starting reagents were chosen to be iodine and water only. The initial elementary-step trials were set up with only these two molecules, namely, combinations of either one iodine molecule and one water molecule, two iodine molecules, or two water molecules. In a setting, in which Chemoton reacts each emerging molecule with all existing molecules in the network, iodine compounds with more than one or two iodine atoms can be formed. I2 was assigned a compound cost of 1.0 a.u., H2O a compound cost of 0.45 a.u. This corresponded approximately to a I2/H2O ratio of 1:2 and hence to a probability of 36% (e–1.0) for I2 and 64% (e–0.45) for H2O at the start of the reaction. During the guided exploration, a total of 49,710 structures as well as 15,519 elementary steps from 100,997 elementary-step trials were found by Chemoton.\n\nThe structures and elementary steps found were aggregated into a total of 1157 compounds and 4540 reactions. Given the simplicity and small size of our starting molecules, this number of compounds is astonishing. However, as an iodine atom is able to form up to seven bonds, quite similar to transition metals, the first coordination sphere of iodine can vary significantly. For instance, orthoperiodic acid and diperiodate species coordinate six oxygen atoms per iodine atom.56 Accordingly, the surprisingly large number of compounds is produced by a varying number of atoms bound to I and by their different types (and environments)—similar to ligands in transition-metal complexes. In addition, stereoisomers (cis/trans, fac/mer) come into play. As two iodine atoms can bind either directly or be bonded via a bridging oxygen atom, the number of theoretically possible compounds grows even more. These compounds might be high in energy and, hence, meta-stable; nevertheless, they are minima on the investigated potential energy surface. However, we emphasize that all species found in our network are, by construction, uncharged species in the gas phase. Hence, important solvation effects are absent, and therefore, charged species are not present.\n\nDuring the exploration, the growing CRN was repeatedly analyzed with Pathfinder to determine the compound costs of all other compounds found. When starting from I2 and H2O, all compounds with a compound cost below 100 a.u. (six compounds in total) were allowed in unimolecular and bimolecular elementary-step trials in the CRN exploration process. Compounds with a compound cost 100 a.u. < ci,sc < 200 a.u. were only reacted with each other and with the six cheapest compounds, elementary-step trials with themselves were not permitted in the exploration process. For all compounds with costs above 200 a.u., only trials with the six cheapest compounds were probed to limit the total number of trials.6 The rationale behind these choices is that the likeliest encounter of compounds with a high cost is with compounds of low cost. The six compounds with costs below 100 a.u. are shown in , including the starting materials H2O and I2. All compounds with a cost below the one of HIO3 and including HIO3 were probed for trials in the exploration with Chemoton.\n\nAfter completion of these trials, the CRN was analyzed with different starting conditions to investigate the reactivity of HIO3 with H2O and the resulting products; namely, HIO3 and H2O with compound costs set to 1.0 a.u. and 0.45 a.u.. H2O had the same cost assigned as in the Pathfinder analyses before, the compound cost of HIO3 equaled the cost of I2 of the preceding exploration round. Due to the different starting conditions, compound costs were different compared to the analysis with I2 instead of HIO3 as starting conditions. Compounds with costs up to 34 a.u. were only combined with H2O in elementary-step trials as we were solely interested in reactions with H2O at this point.\n\nThe graph of the CRN was built from 3916 of the 4540 found reactions. A total of 624 reactions were not considered because either the forward or the backward reaction barriers were below 4.5 kJ/mol. Reactions with barriers below this threshold were considered technical failures and therefore not included in the graph. Hence, the resulting graph consisted of 1046 compound vertices and 7832 reaction vertices (LHS vertices and RHS vertices) with 29,212 edges. On a single core of an Intel Xeon E-2176G (3.70 GHz) central processing unit with a Python 3.8.13 interpreter, the construction of the graph took about 2 min and the determination of all compound costs took about 10 min.\n\nAmong the discovered compounds were hydrogen iodide HI, hypoiodous acid HIO, iodous acid HIO2, and iodic acid HIO3. These cover the oxidation states of iodine from −I to V. The disproportionation of I2 to HI and HIO3 should therefore be included in the CRN as HI and HIO3 were discovered starting from I2 and H2O:\n\nR13\n\nThe overall reaction equation of the disproportionation starting from I2 and H2O is given in reaction R13. Mechanistic models for the formation of HIO3 have been discussed in the literature. Early attempts to describe the formation focused on the dissociation of iodine33 and proposed I2OH, “invented ad hoc”,32 as an intermediate to react with 2 equiv of hypoiodous acid. In a more recent investigation, a kinetic model containing 10 proposed reactions was fitted successfully to the experimental observations.34 This model proposed I2OH– as an intermediate to be crucial for fitting the experimental results. Iodate, IO3–, was proposed to be formed from 2 equiv of IO2–. As a caveat, we emphasize that our exploration was performed in the gas phase (see Section 3). Hence, reactions leading to charged compounds, such as deprotonation reactions, are too high in energy in our setting that precludes dielectric stabilization effects and are therefore not observed in this work.\n\nWe chose a kinetic model proposed in the literature57,58 as our reference model and slightly modified it. The kinetic reference model for the disproportionation is part of a more complex kinetic model of the Bray–Liebhafsky reaction.59,60 The original kinetic model was postulated based on experimental observations and simulation attempts. Our kinetic reference model is represented in reactions R14−R17. We neglected any dissociation reactions proposed in the original kinetic model in the literature due to the fact that solvent effects were not considered in our exploration. The proposed elementary steps for this kinetic reference model are then:\n\nR14\n\nTo illustrate the operation of Pathfinder, we evaluated the literature path starting from I2 and H2O (left-hand side of reaction R14) to HIO3 (right-hand side of reaction R17). This corresponds to the disproportionation of I2. Exchanging start and end of the path yields the comproportionation of HI and HIO3. We compare the literature path and its length to the shortest path found by Pathfinder for both directions, shown in , in the following sections. More detailed Pathfinder output on all paths is given in the SI.\n\n4.2.1. Disproportionation of I2\n\nAn elementary step is defined as a chemical reaction in which the LHS and the RHS are connected by a single transition state. Reactions R14, R15, and R17 were found in the CRN with elementary steps with one transition state (TS). However, reaction R16 turned out to be not an elementary step in our CRN, as there was not one single TS connection between the left-hand side and right-hand side of (R16). Instead, the shortest path Pathfinder proposed to obtain HIO2 from I2O under the given disproportionation conditions traversed via compound H2I2O2, which has an HO–I–OH motive (compare ). The reactions traversed for the formation of compound HIO2 from I2O included the highest free activation barrier along the literature path, as can be seen in . The added path lengths are shown in . There were other possible paths with similar lengths.\n\nThe total length of the reference path via the intermediate of H2I2O2 summed up to 420 a.u., as shown in . Overall, 2 equiv of HIO were consumed along this reference path, namely, at reaction number two and five of the literature path. As the compound cost of HIO was 75 a.u. (compare ) under the stated starting conditions, the total cost of the consumption of the 2 equiv of HIO summed up to 150 a.u. The consumption of 2 equiv of HIO therefore was responsible for 36% of the weight of the path’s total length.\n\nThe shortest path found by Pathfinder differed at the second reaction step from the reference path. Instead of forming I2O and consuming one equivalent of HIO, the path traversed via H2I2O2, which has an IO–I–OH motive (compare ), and H3IO3 to form iodous acid HIO2. The final steps to iodic acid differed as well, as it was more economical to react with equivalents of the starting compounds I2 and H2O compared to HIO in the reference path. This can be seen in , as reactions five and six of the path by Pathfinder elongate the total path by a length of 99 a.u., whereas the direct formation via reaction five of the literature path extends the total path by a length of 111 a.u. Hence, despite the reactions with higher activation barriers (compare ), the path from HIO2 to HIO3 by Pathfinder was favorable in terms of path length because of the availability of the required compounds and consequently the lower compound costs. The overall total path length of the Pathfinder path was 321 a.u. and thereby about 100 a.u. lower than that for the literature path. The cost was reduced by avoiding the consumption of 2 equiv of HIO which were required in reactions R15 and R17 of the literature path.\n\nThe interpretation of a CRN by Pathfinder depends on the choices made for the exploration such as the underlying electronic structure theory, the modeling of the environment (gas phase vs solvation), and the starting conditions for determining the compound costs. Given the limitations of the performed exploration, especially the simplification to exclude any solvation effects, the difference in the reference and Pathfinder path is not surprising. The compounds along the Pathfinder path must also be considered with care as some have not been observed experimentally. However, the crucial point of considering the stoichiometric constraints for reactions is clearly covered by the Pathfinder analysis of a CRN as the reactions of the shortest path for the disproportionation are not consuming any reactants besides the starting materials I2 and H2O.\n\n4.2.2. Comproportionation of HIO3 and HI\n\nFor the comproportionation, only HIO3 and HI were considered as starting compounds. HIO3 was assigned a compound cost of 1.0 a.u., HI a compound cost of 0.45 a.u.. This corresponded to a probability of 36% (e–1.0) for HIO3 and 64% (e–0.45) for HI, respectively, being available at the start. As we were analyzing the same CRN as for the disproportionation, the same reactions as discussed before were present. However, a path to form I2O from HIO2 was still needed as reaction R16 is not an elementary step in our network. Due to the different starting conditions, the shortest path to form HIO2 varied from the one found under the disproportionation conditions. Pathfinder identified a direct formation of I2O from the reaction of HIO2 with 2 equiv of HIO as the shortest option. The steps found and discussed under disproportionation conditions for reaction R16 were the second best option, only 0.1 a.u. more expensive.\n\nWith the starting conditions set for the comproportionation, the resulting compound cost for HIO was 17 a.u. instead of the 74 a.u. determined under the disproportionation conditions. This illustrates the dependency of the determined compound costs on the chosen starting conditions. The easier formation of HIO was due to the lower reaction barrier of 30.9 kJ/mol from HIO3 to HIO2 (compare reaction R17), as shown in , compared to the barrier of 174.4 kJ/mol from I2 to HIO (compare reaction R14).\n\nThe highest reaction barrier in the literature path was the formation of HIO from I2O, reaction three of the path, corresponding to reaction R15. The overall cost of this reference path accumulated to 159 a.u. with reaction three of this path elongating it by 67 a.u.\n\nFinding the shortest path to iodine under the given starting conditions according to Pathfinder required only two reactions, as shown in and . First, compound H2I2O3 (compare ) was formed from HIO3 and HI. This intermediate then reacted again with one equivalent of HI, a cheap starting compound, to form I2. The overall length of this path was 24.7 a.u., more than 100 a.u. lower than the literature path. The key feature distinguishing it from the reference path was that only starting compounds were consumed.\n\nAs the reference model was based on experimental studies of the disproportionation, its validity for the comproportionation reaction has to be carefully considered. The fact that the shortest path according to Pathfinder was not overlapping with the literature path indicated that there might be other steps involved. Pathfinder allows for an almost unbiased approach, with the exception of the choice of the starting conditions."
