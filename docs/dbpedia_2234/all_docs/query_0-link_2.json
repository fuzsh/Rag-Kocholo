        "text": "Version 4.16.104\n\nRelease Date: August 19, 2015\n\nNew Features since COPASI 4.15 (Build 95)\n\nGraphical User Interface (CopasiUI)\n\nThe copy to next feature in the Experimental data description dialog is now able to handle the situation were the target experiment has less columns than the copied one.\n\nSimulation Engine\n\nThe Gamma distribution and the Poisson distribution are now accessible in mathematical expressions and exported to SBML.\n\nSBML\n\nCOPASI now exports the SBML L1V1 legacy format.\n\nBug Fixes since COPASI 4.15 (Build 95)\n\nGraphical User Interface (CopasiUI)\n\nThe tool \"Create Events For Time-series Experiment\" does now handle ignored columns correctly.\n\nFix issue where deleting a reaction and running a parameter estimation afterward could cause the initial values to be corrupted.\n\nFixed problem in the tool \"Convert to irreversible\" which could lead to crashes if a reaction parameter of a reversible reaction was referenced out side the reaction.\n\nFixed handling of HTML entities like &mdash; in notes.\n\nImproved performance of the \"Update MIRIAM\" tool.\n\nWarning about unknown MIRIAM resources are now only issued when the resource is accessed.\n\nAll available tasks are now selectable as sub-tasks for the Optimization task.\n\nFixed issue where copying a compartment could lead to a crash in COPASI.\n\nSimulation Engine\n\nFixed problem in the Linear Noise Approximation task which occasionally lead to crashes in COPASI.\n\nFixed issue in the Parameter Estimation Task where the un-normalized weight would not be calculated correctly.\n\nThe recently introduced Persistent Trigger flag for events was not correctly read from files causing the default value to be used.\n\nNumerical instability issues in the Metabolic Control Analysis task result in a warning reported to the user.\n\nRemoved erroneous error messages caused by a premature function compile during when loading a file.\n\nFixed issue were HTML notes not save correctly when the user added the name space manually to the top level element.\n\nRenaming an object triggers now an immediate update of the infix of all mathematical expression where the object is referenced.\n\nImproved handling of experimental data files for parameter estimation which are not in the same directory as the the COPASI file.\n\nFixed issue where incorrect numerical values for parameter bounds in Optimization or Parameter Estimation would lead to an occasional crash.\n\nSBML\n\nThe import of SBML files previously exported from COPASI does no longer create any warnings.\n\nCOPASI handles the export of log10 correctly.\n\nThe import of n-ary relational operators is now correctly handled.\n\nImproved handling of incorrect SBML documents on import.\n\nFixed issue where COPASI could crash when loading and SBML file, which contains the same model name as the currently loaded model in COPASI.\n\nSource package\n\nThe python example files are now also compatible with Python 3.x\n\nFixed problems compiling COPASI for the arm architecture."
