        "text": "Modeling biochemical systems can provide insights into behaviors that are difficult to observe or understand. It requires software, programming, and understanding of the system to build a model and study it. Softwares exist for systems biology modeling, but most support only certain types of modeling tasks. Desirable features including ease in preparing input, symbolic or analytical computation, parameter estimation, graphical user interface, and systems biology markup language (SBML) support are not seen concurrently in one software package. In this study, we developed a python-based software that supports these features, with both deterministic and stochastic propagations. The software can be used by graphical user interface, command line, or as a python import. We also developed a semi-programmable and intuitively easy topology input method for the biochemical reactions. We tested the software with semantic and stochastic SBML test cases. Tests on symbolic solution and parameter ...\n\nIntrinsic fluctuations due to the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions can have large effects on the response of biochemical networks. This is particularly true for pathways that involve transcriptional regulation, where generally there are two copies of each gene and the number of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules can be small. Therefore, there is a need for computational tools for developing and investigating stochastic models of biochemical networks. We have developed the software package Biochemical Network Stochastic Simulator (BioNetS) for efficiently and accurately simulating stochastic models of biochemical networks. BioNetS has a graphical user interface that allows models to be entered in a straightforward manner, and allows the user to specify the type of random variable (discrete or continuous) for each chemical species in the network. The discrete variables are simulated using an efficient implementation of the Gillespie algorithm. For the continuous random variables...\n\nStochastic simulation of complex biochemical networks is a topic of current interest, in spite of the importance of the Gillespie algorithm it requires substantial amount of computational effort to simulate a complex system, Many algorithms are available now to control the two most important parameters in simulation: speed and accuracy. It can be proved that the stochastic modelling approach provide a conceptual bridge between stochastic chemical kinetics (the CME and SSA) and conventional deterministic chemical kinetics (the RRE).\n\nWe present StochSS: Stochastic Simulation as a Service, an integrated development environment for modeling and simulation of both deterministic and discrete stochastic biochemical systems in up to three dimensions. An easy to use graphical user interface enables researchers to quickly develop and simulate a biological model on a desktop or laptop, which can then be expanded to incorporate increasing levels of complexity. StochSS features state-of-the-art simulation engines. As the demand for computational power increases, StochSS can seamlessly scale computing resources in the cloud. In addition, StochSS can be deployed as a multi-user software environment where collaborators share computational resources and exchange models via a public model repository. We demonstrate the capabilities and ease of use of StochSS with an example of model development and simulation at increasing levels of complexity.\n\nAs the scope and complexity of bioinformatic research widens, the need for a practical simulator for biochemical systems has grown considerably. The influx of experimental data begs the need for analytical tools; however, current implementations exhibit limitations with user-interactivity. We present CASS (Computational Adaptable Stochastic Simulator), an analytical modeling tool with a focus on a clean user-interface and malleable terms. Through adaptations of the Gillespie algorithm, our program accepts a broad range of user-specific input and simulates network interactions across time according to chemical propensity functions. CASS offers users a layout of parameter and plotting preferences in order to maximize compatibility for experimental models. This versatile tool shows promise for applications across the board in small-scale research."
