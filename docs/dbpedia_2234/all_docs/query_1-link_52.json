This allows the user to develop elaborate scripts and workflows for analyses that would require a great deal of tedious manual work otherwise. These scripts can then be run interactively or be sent to cluster or cloud facilities for more demanding calculations.\n\nDetails\n\nCoRC features:\n\n* high-level API for COPASI in the R language. * Immediate access to R's data analysis capabilities and publication-ready plotting. * Reproducible workflows from data generation to analysis and plotting (R scripts and notebooks). * Rule-based modification of model structure to test structural variations or create large models. * Scaling up assays, e.g. from 3 models to 3000. * Handling of multiple models at once. * Parallelization on multi-core machines or computing clusters.\n\nIt is based on a current development version of COPASI but is expected to closely follow official COPASI releases in the future."
