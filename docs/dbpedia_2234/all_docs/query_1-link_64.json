        "text": "BacDive pages now contain links to the new PhageDive database for information on prokaryotic viruses..\n\n5308 new 16S rRNA gene sequences were automatically matched to BacDive strains.\n\nAdditionally, several small bugs were fixed to improve the BacDive user experience.\n\nWe are happy to announce that the traditional Christmas BacDive release is now online.\n\nThis update features the integration of a large set of phenotypic and metabolic data generously shared by the Biological Resource Center (CRBIP) of the Institut Pasteur. BacDive now provides data on 97,334 strains, 4080 of which were newly added. The number of total filled data fields grew by almost 30% to 2,675,988 entries.\n\nA careful curation of the genome sequences listed in BacDive resulted in the removal of links to low-quality assemblies and the consolidation of listings of single contigs of WGS projects in assembly accession. The number of sequence entries therefore decreased, while the quality of displayed genomes increased.\n\nBacDive strain pages now contain links to the newly revived StrainInfo database for strain identity information and the resolution of strain identifiers.\n\nGenome-based predictions from the Diaspora project can now be accessed using the API using an optional parameter.\n\nWe want to thank all of our users who have sent in suggestions and corrections over the last year, many of which were accepted and become visible with this release.\n\nBacDive Section Release 2021 Release 2022 Release 2023 2022-2023 increase Name and taxonomic classification* 132,839 137,332 154,525 11% Morphology* 42,756 62,766 74,683 16% Culture and growth conditions* 157,622 159,833 193,351 17% Physiology and metabolism* 1,063,988 1,112,931 1,691,087 34% Isolation, sampling and environmental information* 156,065 175,521 187,071 6% Application and interaction* 22,077 23,221 36,338 36% Sequence data* 106,070 122,022 109,572 -11% References* 68,145 128,540 229,361 44% overall entries* 1,749,562 1,922,166 2,675,988 28%\n\nBacDive is ELIXIR Core Data Resource\n\nWe are proud that after an extensive review and evaluation process, BacDive has been selected as a new ELIXIR Core Data Resource, joining a list of now 32 renowned European life science data resources that are important to biological and biomedical research and long-term preservation of biological data.\n\nA new BacDive release is online, providing now data on 93,254 strains!\n\nThis update includes a major update for data from DSMZ database, including 637 new strains.\n\nWe also integrated comprehensive data on 267 strains for the Wink compendium of Actinobacteria, which now comprises data on 1576 strains and is now finalized!\n\nAn exiting new feature are our new taxonmaps: for 15.655 strains we could match 16S sequence data with the database MicrobeAtlas and now provide integrated overviews over the global distribution of a taxon.\n\nFind the overall statistics in the table (below).\n\nBacDive Section Release 2020 Release 2021 Release 2022 2021-2022 increase Name and taxonomic classification* 110,587 132,839 137,332 3% Morphology* 36,689 42,756 62,766 47% Culture and growth conditions* 136,586 157,622 159,833 1% Physiology and metabolism* 332,303 1,063,988 1,112,931 5% Isolation, sampling and environmental information* 143,496 156,065 175,521 12% Application and interaction* 21,710 22,077 23,221 5% Sequence data* 295,734 106,070 122,022 15% References* 66,571 68,145 128,540 89% overall entries* 1,143,676 1,749,562 1,922,166 10%\n\nA new BacDive release is online. 2604 new type strains from LPSN with their corresponding 2447 sequence accession numbers (16S) and risk assessment information have been integrated in our database.\n\nCurrently we offer metadata on 92,150 strains, including 18,710 type strains. An 16% type strains increase since the last update\n\nSome suggestions from our users were included in this update as well. Thank you for making BacDive better!\n\nTo find even more information about our strains, we added 56,017 extra literature resources to allow you to dig even deeper into the strains of your interest.\n\nWe are also very proud of our new feature, the Smartsearch. Using a google like search now you can search our database for taxonomy, culture collection numbers, NCBI taxid, sequence accession numbers, motility, cell shape and much more."
