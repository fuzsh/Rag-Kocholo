        "meta_description": "COPASI is a popular application for simulation and analysis of biochemical networks and their dynamics. While this software is widely used, it works as a standalone application and until now it was not possible for users to interact with its models through the web. We built ShinyCOPASI, a web-based application that allows COPASI models to be explored through a web browser. ShinyCOPASI was written in R with the CoRC package, which provides a high-level R API for COPASI, and the Shiny package to expose it as a web application. The web view provided by ShinyCOPASI follows a similar interface to the standalone COPASI and allows users to explore the details of a model, as well as running a subset of the tasks available in COPASI from within a browser. A generic version allows users to load model files from their computer, while another one pre-loads a specific model from the server and may be useful to provide web access to published models. The application is available at: http://shiny.copasi.org/; and the source code is at: https://github.com/copasi/shinyCOPASI.",
