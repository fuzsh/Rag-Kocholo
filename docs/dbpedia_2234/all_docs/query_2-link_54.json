        "text": "-s, --save string value This option is used to specify the name file where COPASI should store a model. This is useful if you intend to convert some SBML files to COPASI files in a batch job. This also makes sense only for the commandline version and will be ignored by the GUI version. -i, --importSBML string value This options lets you specify an SBML file that COPASI shall import. -e, --exportSBML string value With this option you can specify a name for the SBML file COPASI should export. This is useful if you want to export some COPASI files to SBML in a batch job. This only makes sense for the commandline version and it will be ignored by the GUI version. --SBMLSchema L1V2, L2V1, L2V2, L2V3, L2V4, L3V1 This switch works in combination with the --exportSBML switch and determines which SBML level and version is going to be used for SBML export. Currently the following schemas are supported SBML Level 1 Version 2 (L1V2), SBML Level 2 Version 1 (L2V1), SBML Level 2 Version 2 (L2V2), SBML Level 2 Version 3 (L2V3), SBML Level 2 Version 4 (L2V4), and SBML Level 3 Version 1 (L3V1).\n\nIf no schema is given, the export creates SBML Level 2 Version 4 files. --importSEDML string value This options lets you specify an SEDML file that COPASI shall import. --exportSEDML string value With this option you can specify a name for the SEDML file COPASI should export. --importCA string value This options lets you specify a COMBINE archive file that COPASI shall import. --exportCA string value With this option you can specify a name for the COMBINE archive file COPASI should export. --exportBerkeleyMadonna string value With this option you can specify a name for the Berkeley Madonna file COPASI should export. This is useful if you want to export some COPASI files to Berkeley Madonna file format in a batch job. This only makes sense for the commandline version and it will be ignored by the GUI version. --exportC string value With this option you can specify a name for the C source file COPASI should export. This is useful if you want to export some COPASI files to C source code in a batch job. This only makes sense for the commandline version and it will be ignored by the GUI version. --exportXPPAUT string value With this option you can specify a name for the XPPAUT file COPASI should export. This is useful if you want to export some COPASI files to XPPAUTs ODE file format in a batch job. This only makes sense for the commandline version and it will be ignored by the GUI version. -c, --copasidir string value This specifies the directory where COPASI has been installed. It is needed to find e.g. help files. On Windows and Mac OS X this is set automatically. On Linux it has to be specified if you want to use certain features. The GUI version of COPASI will issue a warning on startup if this has not been set. The commandline version does not need this directory to be specified and therefore ignores this option. --exportIni string value export the parameterization of the model as INI file for use with the --reparameterize option. -r, --reparameterize string value Before any task is run, the model is reparameterized with the values specified in the provided INI file. --configdir string value This can be used to specify the directory where COPASI stores its configuration files. Normally this is called .copasi and is located in the users home directory. But if you want COPASI to use a different one, you can specify it with this switch. --configfile string value This can be used to specify the filename where COPASI loads and stores its configuration. Normally this is called COPASI and is located in the directory specified with --configdir. But if you want COPASI to use a different filename, you can specify it with this switch. --home string value This can be used to tell COPASI where your home directory is located. Normally you don't have to use this. -t, --tmp string value This option can be used to specify a temporary directory where COPASI will auto-save some data periodically. Normally COPASI uses the systems temporary directory (e.g. /tmp/ under Linux). --report-file string value Override report file name to be used except for the one defined in the scheduled task. --scheduled-task string value Override the task marked as executable. --sedmlTask string value For specifying the task id to import (and execute) when importing SED-ML or importing a COMBINE archive. For a list of all SED-ML tasks use `--printSedMLTasks`. --convert-to-irreversible Converts reversible reactions to irreversible ones before running Task. --maxTime seconds The maximal time CopasiSE may run in seconds. --license With this commandline option, COPASI will print its license and exit. --nologo This option suppresses the output of the \"Logo\" when CopasiSE is run. The \"Logo\" usually consist of the version of COPASI and some license statement. --printSedMLTasks Only print the SED-ML tasks when importing SED-ML or COMBINE archives. --validate This commandline option can be used to validate the given file. The file can either be a COPASI file or an SBML file."
