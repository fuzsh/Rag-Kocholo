Please visit our free download page to retrieve this latest development release. Please note this version is released under the Artistic License 2.0, which is an OSI approved license. This license allows non-commercial and commercial use free of charge.\n\nRelease Date: May 31, 2023\n\nNew Features\n\nThe is a bug fix release and does not include new features\n\nBug Fixes\n\nGraphical User Interface (CopasiUI)\n\nFixed issue where loading a parameter estimation protocol in which the values had been sorted externally lead to incorrect parameter mapping.\n\nShow both modification and creation time entities in local time.\n\nFixed plot for parameter estimation results for steady state experiments to properly map the independent data.\n\nThe parameter estimation result now includes a counter for failed constraints.\n\nFixed crash when deleting all global quantities.\n\nSimulation Engine\n\nFixed temporary directory for export of Combine and Shiny archives to address security restrictions on MacOS X.\n\nStochastic simulation methods now correctly report whether they support events and thus whether they can be used for the simulation of model with events.\n\nStandards\n\nSBML import: Fixed issue where it was not possible to change the delay of an imported event.\n\nSBML import: Fixed crash caused by particular unit definitions during importing.\n\nSBML import: Fixed import of reaction kinetics which occasionally lost the parameter mapping.\n\nSBML import: Handle references to missing modifier species in reactions gracefully.\n\nSBML export: Reduced warnings about Model History not being exported to only check the model itself and not all model components."
