        "text": "pyABC - distributed, likelihood-free inference\n\nRelease:\n\n0.12.13\n\nSource code:\n\nhttps://github.com/icb-dcm/pyabc\n\npyABC is a framework for distributed, likelihood-free inference. That means, if you have a model and some data and want to know the posterior distribution over the model parameters, i.e. you want to know with which probability which parameters explain the observed data, then pyABC might be for you.\n\nAll you need is some way to numerically draw samples from the model, given the model parameters. pyABC “inverts” the model for you and tells you which parameters were well matching and which ones not. You do not need to analytically calculate the likelihood function.\n\npyABC runs efficiently on multi-core machines and distributed cluster setups. It is easy to use and flexibly extensible.\n\nIndices and tables\n\nIndex\n\nModule Index\n\nSearch Page"
