        "text": "The COPASI team announces a scientific conference on applications of computational modelling with COPASI. May 12-13, 2016 at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, UK.\n\n2016 Conference on Computational Modelling with COPASI\n\nMay 12-13, 2016 at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology,\n\nManchester, UK\n\nhttp://www.copasi.org/Events/CMC16\n\nAnnouncing a Conference dedicated to computational modelling research carried out with the software COPASI. This is a forum where you can present your work and hear the latest research in modelling and simulation carried out with the software COPASI. The conference features 3 invited speakers, several oral presentations selected from submitted abstracts, and posters. Registration for this conference is free.\n\nWe solicit abstracts on computational analysis and simulation of biological and chemical systems carried out with COPASI. The conference brings together researchers from all areas of biology and chemistry who are interested in computational modelling of reaction networks. The abstracts should focus mainly on the scientific objectives of the work; they should only focus on methodology if that is the main goal of the work. Abstracts must be less than 500 words long and with no figures.\n\nAbstract submission deadline: 12 April, 2016.\n\nINVITED SPEAKERS\n\nInes Heiland, The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø: “Tissue specific models of Trp- and NAD-metabolism — insights into metabolic crosstalk”\n\nCarole Proctor, Newcastle University: “Computational modelling of musculoskeletal ageing”\n\nNicolas le Novère, Babraham Institute, Cambridge: “Calcium Signalling”\n\nSCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE\n\nFrank Bergmann, Heidelberg\n\nJoseph Dada, Ado-Ekiti\n\nStefan Hoops, Blacksburg\n\nDouglas B. Kell, Manchester,\n\nBrian Klahn, Blacksburg\n\nUrsula Kummer, Heidelberg\n\nPedro Mendes, Manchester and Farmington\n\nJürgen Pahle, Heidelberg\n\nNorman Paton, Manchester\n\nChris Redfern, Newcastle\n\nSven Sahle, Heidelberg\n\nHans V.
