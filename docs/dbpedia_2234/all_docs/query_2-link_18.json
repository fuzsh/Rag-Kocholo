        "text": "Version 4.5.31 (development)\n\nRelease Date: March 18, 2010\n\nNew Features\n\nSupport of conditional events, which are discrete changes to the model.\n\nNew stochastic simulation algorithm, which implements the direct Gillespie algorithm.\n\nSorting and filtering in tables, which eases handling of large models.\n\nEnhanced result representation of elementary flux mode analysis.\n\nImport and export of SBML Level 2 Version 4.\n\nFull support for SBML event import/export\n\nCOPASI now passes all test of the SBML testsuite for all version of SBML up to L2V4 save for the tests including algebraic rules or 'fast' reactions\n\nBug Fixes\n\nGraphical User Interface (CopasiUI)\n\nUsing a slider before committing changes to a task no longer reverts the changes.\n\nIt is no possible to select multiple objects simultaneously when creating sliders.\n\nImproved error message which occurred when the MIRIAM web service connection was interrupted during update.\n\nPlot and layout windows can now be closed with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+W (Cmd+W on Mac OS X).\n\nInvalid mathematical expression no longer cause the GUI to crash.\n\nFixed handling of deprecated URIs in the MIRIAM annotation which may be present in older SBML or COPASI file.\n\nFixed display of random and normal distribution function in MathML and LaTeX.\n\nThe warning message that the calculation of a Steady-State is not meaningful during parameter estimation is now only shown if the Newton method is used and Steady-State data is provided.\n\nCompleted renaming from metabolites to species in the GUI.\n\nFixed progress dialog for a scan of of parameter estimations, which continued to grow for each parameter estimation completed.\n\nPrevent closing of COPASI while as task is running which could lead to a crash report.\n\nFixed crash caused by the MIRIAM relation 'occursIn'.\n\nRandomizing parameter start values takes now into consideration the latest updates to the boundaries. This problem occurred when switching between infinity and a finite value.\n\nThe scan task indicates now the overall progress correctly.\n\nSimulation Engine\n\nImproved Steady-State criterion which estimates the distance of the current state from a Steady-State.\n\nScan of Steady-States may have lead to incorrect results when COPASI was unable to find any Steady-State. In this case scan values after the unsuccessful attempt would have used incorrect parameters.\n\nOn Windows COPASI is now able to deal with file names starting with '\\', i.e., are relative to the current drive.\n\nEFM no longer fails for models which only have reversible reactions.\n\nFixed the Simulated Annealing optimization method which failed when a parameter started with value '0'.\n\nFixed Praxis optimization method which did not terminate for problems containing only 1 parameter.\n\nFixed the behavior of the Slider Dialog which would stay on top of all other Windows covering open and save dialogs.\n\nIn rare situations on Linux COPASI does not recognize the application font chosen by the user. This can now correct by selecting an application font in COPASI.\n\nThe MathML rendering will recognize now the application font setting of the user.\n\nSBML\n\nIn rare circumstance COPASI could have created two identical SIds leading to invalid SBML files.\n\nCOPASI identifies itself in an XML comment as the creator of the SBML file.\n\nImplemented export of the modulo '%' operator which is available in COPASI's mathematical expressions.\n\nCOPASI supports now round trip of models containing the delay symbol.\n\nIf a model was directly loaded from an SBML file, the default level and version for the export are the same as in the original file. Otherwise export to SBML is now done as SBML Level 2 Version 4 per default.\n\nadditional bugfixes which would lead to incorrectly imported and/or exported SBML models in certain situations"
