Use COPASI instead.\n\nDownload\n\nInstallation\n\nNews\n\nScreen shots\n\nGepasi in research\n\nGepasi in education\n\nGepasi and SBML\n\nTutorials\n\nF.A.Q.\n\nKnown bugs\n\nMEG\n\nFuture developments\n\nLink to these pages!\n\nNEWS\n\nThe widely used COPASI software simulates Gepasi models\n\nThere will be no more releases of Gepasi.\n\nGepasi 3.30 can run in Linux under the Wine emulator! Download a tarball for this purpose here\n\nUpdated release of version 3.30, with missing file and improved SBML import\n\nGepasi supports SBML!\n\nVersion 3.30 released September 4, 2002\n\nMore news...\n\nGepasi has not been updated since 2002. It has been superseded by COPASI which you should use instead.\n\nThis web page is being kept alive for historical purposes only.\n\nYou are encouraged to use COPASI.\n\nWhat is Gepasi?\n\nGepasi is an old software package for modeling biochemical systems in Microsoft Windows. It simulates the kinetics of systems of biochemical reactions and provides a number of tools to fit models to data, optimize any function of the model, perform metabolic control analysis and linear stability analysis.\n\nGepasi simplifies the task of model building by assisting the user in translating the language of chemistry (reactions) to mathematics (matrices and differential equations) in a transparent way. This is combined with a set of sophisticated numerical algorithms that assure the results are obtained fast and accurate.\n\nGepasi is intended primarily for research purposes but because of its user-friendly interface it is equally good for education.\n\nLatest version is 3.30, released on September 2002, added SBML support and other features. But please note that this software has not been updated since 2002. Use COPASI which is the software that succeeded Gepasi.\n\nFeatures\n\nGepasi is free software (user license)\n\nGepasi runs under Microsoft Windows (95 and above).\n\nModels in Gepasi v. 3 can be composed of many compartments with different volumes\n\nThe number of reactions and metabolites in each model is only limited by available memory.\n\nSimulations can be followed interactively (including adding perturbations to a time course)\n\nGepasi characterises steady states using Metabolic Control Analysis and linear stability analysis.\n\nGepasi's scan utility provides a way for advanced exploration of a model's behaviour in multi-dimensional parameter space\n\nGepasi is capable of doing data fitting (parameter estimation) with experimental data.\n\nGepasi is capable of finding maxima or minima of any model variables with any number of adjustable model parameters.\n\nThe results of simulations can be plotted in 2D and 3D directly from the program (Gepasi uses the excellent Gnuplot package).\n\nGepasi supports SBML level 1 for model interchange with other systems biology modeling software.\n\nBibliography\n\nA description of the program was published in the journal Cabios:\n\nMendes, P. (1993) GEPASI: A software package for modelling the dynamics, steady states and control of biochemical and other systems. Comput. Applic. Biosci. 9, 563-571.\n\nand more recently in Trends in Biochemical Sciences (Sept 1997):\n\nMendes, P. (1997) Biochemistry by numbers: simulation of biochemical pathways with Gepasi 3. Trends Biochem. Sci. 22, 361-363.\n\nA paper in Bioinformatics describes the application of optimisation methods in bio/chemical modelling with examples carried out in Gepasi:\n\nMendes, P. & Kell, D.B. (1998) Non-linear optimization of biochemical pathways: applications to metabolic engineering and parameter estimation. Bioinformatics 14, 869-883.\n\nWho's talking about Gepasi?\n\nHMS Beagle's Software Alert\n\nRated 4 star product by ZDNet's Software Library\n\nReviewed by the CTI centre for Chemistry"
