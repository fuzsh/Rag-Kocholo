        "text": "For Windows 10 installation If you have a trouble launching CellDesigner after installation,\n\n* Copy \"msvcp110.dll\" and \"msvcr100.dll\" which is located under\n\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\CellDesigner4.4\\Microsoft.CV110.CRT\"\n\nto \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\CellDesigner4.4\\\"\n\nFor MacOSX Users (El Capitan above) Please use Java 6 above 1.6.0_65-b14-466, which is downloadable from http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572\n\nFor Garuda users\n\nCellDesigner 4.4 is available on Garuda platform as Ver4.4.1 Win / Mac.\n\n4.4.2 will be available on Garuda website shortly.\n\n* (Windows) We have tested 32bit version on Windows XP, and 64bit version on Windows 7 Pro and Windows 10 Pro.\n\n** (macOS) We have tested 64bit version on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 and Mojave 10.14.3.\n\n*** (Linux) We have tested 32bit version on Ubuntu 14.04, and 64bit version on CentOS 6.10, Fedora Workstation 28, 30, Ubuntu 14.04 and 18.04.2.\n\n*** On Linux platform, due to the version of native libraries, Ubuntu 14.04 or later is recommended; some problems will arise if you use other than these.\n\nThe installer for Windows and Linux includes JRE (Java Runtime Environment 1.6), so you do not have to install Java before your installation.\n\nJRE is not included in Mac OS X Mavericks, so CellDesigner will ask you to install JRE (or JDK) on your system. Please follow the instruction from CellDesigner.\n\nIf SBW and its modules have already been installed, these modules will be available from CellDesigner. Especially time evolving simulation of the model being edited can be performed.\n\nIf you want to use Copasi (http://www.copasi.org) as an alternative solver on Windows, please download \"Visual Studio 2010 runtime (Visual C++ 2010 runtime)\" to use Copasi from CellDesigner.\n\nIf you are interested in time evolving simulation and analysis on biochemical networks, we recommend you to install the Systems Biology Workbench (SBW) and SBW-powered software before you install CellDesigner.\n\nTo install SBW and SBW-powered software, follow their installation instructions.\n\nIf you would like to use CellDesigner alone right now, you can postpone this step until you need simulation and/or analysis.\n\n(*) As of Feb 2012, SBW 2.9.0 is available for Windows, MacOSX and Linux. For details on SBW information: http://sbw.sourceforge.net/\n\n(**) Note: In case you have installed SBW 2.7.6 or later, and you encounter an error while installing CellDesigner, there might be a possibility that the C++ Broker is up which prevents CellDesigner to start. Please try to kill the broker using the Task Manager, or restart your system before you resume the CellDesigner installation."
