        "text": "Analytics algorithms good or great are nothing without reliable data from which models can be built. Ask AI developers that are running out of data mined from the internet from which to build accurate models. Well, we’ve just built a Universal Glycosyltransferase Continuous (UGC) Assay that provides a solid platform on which to generate uniform glycoenzyme kinetics and inhibition data and databases through multi laboratory collaboration. The large network dynamic models are possible by combining individual laboratory enzymatic data that use UGC assay standardised protocols. Building consistent and complimentary enzyme-metabolite data sets make possible discoveries in glycobiology, chemical glycobiology, and metabolomics. These databases will make sound chemical glycobiological models possible when fed into Systems Algorithms such as Copasi. This follows hot on the heels of CytoCopasi, our recently developed Visual Analytics Systems Chemical Biology Platform. Together these experimental and computational tools contribute to making big data analytics possible hopefully bringing similar success as has been seen in genomics and proteomics highlighted in the Society for Glycobiology.\n\nUnderstanding the chemistry of how life on earth came to be just took a big step forward. The discovery of the path to synthetically produce Pantetheine, a molecule central to metabolism and most likely an original structure in the family of prebiotic components is impressive. The door to how these basic building blocks were made from simple organic and inorganic precursors has been opened. A wow discovery illustrating chemistry central role in understanding how we were built.\n\nOur newest computational tool CytoCopasi provides Visual Analytics tools for #bigdataanalytics Systems Chemical Biology by combining the versatile #Cytoscape platform with the rigorous systems machinery of #Copasi. The networks of biochemical reactions underpinning #metabolic pathways are mindboggling. The data analytics required to discover mechanistic patterns, #drugdiscovery #drugtargets, and evaluate the effectiveness of drugs to restore healthy biochemistry in human health is often too vast to manage. As in all big data problems visual analytics seeds intuition and opens the door to solutions. Have a read of Cytoscape our #Scientificomputingresearchunit latest work published in Bioinformatics.\n\nI agree Win. What is more impressive is Katalin Kariko's story of being sidelined, publications rejected, job losses lab space taken away yet she persisted against established thought to drive what allows the our own bodies to fight and correct invaders and NCD's such as cancer. A truly heroic and inspirational story and life.\n\nThank you Reno for invaluable service to the University of Cape Town. Your work for, and dedication to the institution will be remembered for many years to come. All the best in your new adventure of pioneering a path to enhance health care in South Africa.\n\nI am proud to present the Growing Hierarchical Self-Organising Representation Map (GHSORM) our new unsupervised machine learning method to discover subclasses in complex data. GHSORM demonstrates robust capabilities to cluster and sub-cluster the different classes and subclasses of cancer, where the results are superior to both linear methods, currently in use, as well as the methods of its constituent algorithms. GHSORM is a model fusing the denoising autoencoder, used to better represent a dataset, and the Growing Hierarchical Self-Organising Map, used for organizing and projecting the input data in clusters of varying detail. This is an important step forward in our programme to understand the underlying genomic layout of tumours and build biomarkers from them."
