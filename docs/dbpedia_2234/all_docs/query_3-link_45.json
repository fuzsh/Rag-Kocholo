        "text": "I'm a molecular biologist with extensive experience in bioinformatics. Currently, my research focuses primarily on the identification and development of new enzymes for industrial applications. This activity adresses the needs of a growing Norwegian biotechnology sector.\n\nIn addition, a main research activity since 2009 has been the development of a vaccine component targeting childhood and traveller's diarrhoea. This work focused on detoxifying the heat-stable toxin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and making it immunogenic by coupling it to a protein carrier. This work has resulted in several publications and two patents.\n\nMy core competence is the study of protein structure and function. Over the years, I have gained solid experience in the experimental study of proteins and enzymes, which includes recombinant expression and purification, peptide/protein/enzyme engineering, and functional studies. My career in bioinformatics started by contributing to the development of a bioinformatics resource for short linear motifs that provide a wide range of functionality to proteins. As member of the service group of the Computational Biology Unit in Bergen, I expanded my competence in several directions and headed a project on the development of an e-infrastructure for the life sciences."
