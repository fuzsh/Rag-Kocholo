        "text": "Leslie Caromile\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nCenter for Vascular Biology\n\nCaromile Lab Website\n\nResearch Interests: My lab investigates the role of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in prostate cancer tumor growth and metastasis, and I currently have two federally funded projects:\n\nProject 1: Recently, my lab has developed a novel multi-cell type, scaffold-free, 3D bioprinted prostatic tumor model that accurately represents the human PSMA (+) primary tumor vasculature and the primary tumor microenvironment. This model provides the laboratory with a unique system for interrogating novel PSMA small molecule inhibitors on multiple tumorigenic endpoints.\n\nProject 2: We are investigating if germ-line SNPs within specific components of the PSMA signaling pathway might contribute to the increased risk of prostate cancer in African American men vs. that of men of European descent. Investigation into these molecular mechanisms not only has the potential to improve the outcomes of all men with lethal prostate cancer but also can reduce prostate cancer disparities by improving detection, morbidity, and mortality of lethal prostate cancer in African American and other at-risk populations through the identification of unique, tailored treatment and prevention strategies for each patient.\n\nAbhijit (Abhi) Deb Roy\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nCenter for Cell Analysis and Modeling\n\nRoy Lab Website\n\nResearch Interests: We are an experimental cell biology lab interested in both hypothesis-based and curiosity-driven questions, broadly within the realm of biomedical sciences. Our ongoing research projects are focused on investigating molecular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics involved in mechanobiology and cell migration. Directional cell migration plays critical roles during physiological processes such as development, angiogenesis and immune response, whereas dysregulation of cell migration is observed in pathologies such as cancer metastasis and atherosclerosis. We are interested in understanding how spatiotemporal regulation of signaling pathways modulates cytoskeletal dynamics to coordinate cell migration through diverse mechanical and biochemical environments. We employ live cell microscopy with biosensors and synthetic-biology based molecular actuators (optogenetic or chemical-inducible) to examine spatial and temporal relationships between molecular signaling pathways and cell behavior in a quantitative manner. We also collaborate with theoretical and computational biologists to develop predictive models bridging experimental observations to gain better understanding of complex biological systems.\n\nOngoing projects:\n\n–Deciphering how post-translational modifications of microtubules, often called ‘the tubulin code’, affect their crosstalk with the actin cytoskeleton or with intermediate filaments.\n\n–Investigating how spatial modulation of intracellular forces affect directional cell motility.\n\nPaul Epstein\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nEpstein Lab Website\n\nResearch Interests: Research in the Epstein laboratory centers on second messengers and signal transduction. Particular focus has been on cyclic nucleotide metabolism and protein phosphorylation, with emphasis on analysis of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). It has become apparent, in recent years, that PDE is a superfamily of enzymes encoded by 21 different genes, grouped into 11 gene families, based on sequence similarity, mode of regulation and preference for cAMP or cGMP as substrate. With the existence of multiple transcription initiation sites, as well as alternatively spliced forms of many of these genes, more than 100 different forms of PDE have been identified and cloned to date, and many of these PDE forms are localized to different cells and different subcellular compartments as part of complexes or signalosomes composed of scaffolding proteins, cAMP effectors, and distinct PDEs, thus achieving targeted cAMP degradation and the creation of localized intracellular cAMP gradients and allowing the control of specific cellular functions by specific PDE isoforms during cellular signaling. Hence, by inhibiting or altering the expression of specific forms of PDE, cAMP levels in specific cell types can be altered, and fundamental physiological processes in one cell type can be changed, without affecting others. Thus, a main research goal in this laboratory is to examine the tissue distribution of different forms of PDE and regulation of their expression during development and in different pathophysiological states so that specific PDE isoforms can be targeted to treat a number of different diseases. The focus of our research has been to identify and inhibit specific PDE isoforms as novel treatment methods for leukemia, breast cancer and autoimmune and inflammatory illnesses.\n\nGuo-Hua Fong\n\nProfessor\n\nCenter for Vascular Biology\n\nFong Lab Website\n\nResearch Interests: Angiogenesis, or growth of blood vessels, is often suboptimal in many injured tissues such as ischemic tissues following heart attack or diabetic wounds. The healing and regeneration of such tissues critically depend on proper angiogenesis. On the other hand, uncontrolled neovascularization underlies many diseases such as tumor growth, diabetic retinopathy (DR), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In addition, capillary destruction is a significant pathological contributor to such diseases as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of the prematurity (ROP). At the current state of the knowledge, the molecular mechanisms controlling angiogenesis and vascular integrity are only partially understood, which handicaps efforts to develop effective therapies. In our laboratory, we use both developmental and disease models to understand how these processes are controlled, and explore potential therapeutic approaches.\n\nMayu Inaba\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nInaba Website\n\nInaba Lab Website\n\nResearch Interests: Asymmetric stem cell division is a mechanism that balances stem cell self-renewal and differentiation through the production of one stem cell and one differentiating cell. It is a simple way of maintaining the stem cell population without increasing it and is thus thought to be a vital mechanism for tissue homeostasis and tumor suppression. My research goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism as to how two daughter cells of different fates are made after only one cell division. My lab primarily uses Drosophila gonads, in which we can monitor asymmetric division in vivo. Owning to the simple anatomy and abundant imaging tools, this system allows us to discover previously unrecognized regulatory mechanisms Our research findings should lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches for cancers and degenerative diseases.\n\nLeslie Loew\n\nBoard of Trustees Distinguished Professor\n\nCenter for Cell Analysis and Modeling\n\nResearch Interests: My lab is focused on the development of new experimental and computational technologies to help us understand the mechanisms underlying cell function. We have a longstanding effort aimed at developing and characterizing fluorescent probes of membrane potential. This effort is continuing, using organic chemical design and synthesis to develop better more sensitive voltage indicators. This work has led to a continual interest in the organization of signaling pathways along the cell membrane and within the cytoplasm. We are interested in the very general question of how the intricate spatial organization of molecules in cells is used to control cell function. This is especially true of neuronal cells and we are actively investigating the cell biology of dendritic spines in brain tissue. This motivated us to develop a very general computational modeling software platform called the “Virtual Cell”, in which we have created a framework for using computer simulation to explore cell biological mechanisms. The models are built naturally from experimental images of cellular and subcellular structures combined with biochemical and electrophysiological data. We have used the “Virtual Cell” system to explain the pattern of electrical and signaling activity in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Most recently, we have developed new software called SpringSaLaD that can model molecular interactions at the sub-cellular scale. This allows us to explore how the shape of individual molecules control their interactions, leading ultimately to cell-level responses.\n\nPedro Mendes\n\nProfessor and Director\n\nCenter for Quantitative Medicine and Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling\n\nMendes Group Website\n\nResearch Interests: My research is in the area of computational systems biology, which aims to better understand biological systems through the use of computer models. My active areas of research include the development of modeling and simulation software as the author of the popular simulator Gepasi and leader of the COPASI simulator (with U. Kummer) and have been actively involved in the development of SBML, the systems biology markup language, and the MIRIAM proposal for model annotation. My group also constructs biochemical models, currently, this involves models of iron metabolism, eukaryotic translation, and microbial central metabolism. Through this work, I have pioneered the application of numerical global optimization in biochemical kinetic modeling and I am interested in using formal systems identification techniques in systems biology, particularly for reverse engineering models from data. My research requires a broad interdisciplinary approach and I work with people from most areas of science, either in my own research group or as collaborators.\n\nIon Moraru\n\nProfessor\n\nCenter for Cell Analysis and Modeling\n\nResearch Interests: My general research relates to the theoretical understanding of cellular processes, and developing tools for mathematical modeling in cell biology. Current work focuses on interfacing pathway/logic models and –omics data with kinetic quantitative models and dynamic simulations, both on new technology developments and the application to complex modeling of signaling pathways in normal and malignant cells. I am also the current lead developer of the Virtual Cell software platform for mathematical modeling and direct development of both the user interface and computational infrastructure. In addition, my interest in model reproducibility has led to a powerful new web platform that provides a central portal for simulating a broad range of models of biological systems. I have been involved in community standards for a long time, contributing to the development of both Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML).\n\nRebecca Page\n\nProfessor\n\nPage Lab Website\n\nResearch Interests: How we sense and react to our environment is communicated in the cell by vast networks of highly dynamic, interacting proteins. These interactions are regulated in both space and time, and it is this tight regulation that allows signals from outside of the cell to be rapidly and precisely transmitted to the nucleus leading to the appropriate, and healthy, cellular response. We integrate structural biology, cell biology, genetics and biochemistry in order to understand how these signals in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are communicated in the cell at atomic resolution.\n\nAnnabelle Rodriguez-Oquendo\n\nProfessor\n\nCenter for Vascular Biology\n\nRodriguez-Oquendo Lab Website\n\nResearch Interests: High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are thought to protect against cardiovascular disease. This may or may not be true in certain populations. The Rodriguez-Oquendo lab is studying the genetic link between healthy HDL cholesterol, heart disease, and infertility in women. This work suggests that variations within the SCARB1 (scavenger receptor class B type I) gene, connected to increased HDL levels, are associated with heart disease risk as well as hormonal and fertility problems in women. The goal of the research discoveries is the development of methods to diagnose and, ultimately, treat heart disease and improve a woman’s ability to conceive.\n\nSarvenaz Sarabipour\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nCenter for Cell Analysis and Modeling\n\nSarabipour Lab Website\n\nResearch Interests. Our group is interested in understanding the mechanisms of signal transduction in cells and tissue. To do so, we combine techniques in multiple quantitative biological disciplines including biophysics, molecular biology, biochemistry and computational systems biology from single molecule measurements to multi-scale models of physiology and pathophysiology. We build multi-scale models of cells from their molecular interactions to their function in tissue to identify signal transduction mechanisms that contribute to cellular proliferation and migration in vascular and neuronal cells. The knowledge we gain is key in finding ways to modulate these critical signaling pathways for therapeutic potential for disease.\n\nLinda Shapiro\n\nProfessor and Director Center for Vascular Biology\n\nShapiro Lab Website\n\nResearch Interests: Research in the Shapiro Laboratory is focused on understanding the physiological and pathological regulation and function of two M1 family cell surface peptidases CD13/aminopeptidase N and PSMA/glutamate carboxy-peptidase II. This interest is the result of the striking upregulation of numerous cell surface peptidases on endothelial cells in response to both angiogenic land inflammatory signals, leading to the hypothesis that these may functionally cooperate in enzymatic cascades to regulate angiogenesis, inflammation and endothelial cell function. While the angiogenic significance of proteases that cleave large proteins (such as the matrix metalloproteases) is well documented, increasing evidence supports a role for peptidases (metAP2, CD13, APA, PSMA) as angiogenic regulators as well. The fact that these enzymes metabolize small peptide substrates suggests that small molecule regulators of angiogenesis exist which have yet to be identified and whose mechanisms are unknown. Indeed, we have shown that CD13 and PSMA are potent regulators of angiogenesis individually and our investigation of their regulatory mechanisms and their possible interaction is a current focus of the laboratory. However, our investigations have identified a variety of additional functions for these multifunctional molecules, leading our studies into the areas of molecular biology, immunology, cell biology, nephrology, transplant biology, stem cell biology, biomarkers and oncology in addition to angiogenesis using mouse models of myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, stroke, peritonitis, diabetic nephropathy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction and prostate cancer. Our strong relationship with clinician-scientists from the Connecticut Children’s Medical Center Departments of Surgery, Urology and Nephrology has fostered a high degree of translational research by providing clinical insights and remarkable access to patient samples, allowing us to identify, investigate and potentially treat truly clinically relevant questions."
