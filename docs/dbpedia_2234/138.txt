Bug Fixes

Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)

Fixed issue where loading a parameter estimation protocol in which the values had been sorted externally lead to incorrect parameter mapping.

Show both modification and creation time entities in local time.

Fixed plot for parameter estimation results for steady state experiments to properly map the independent data.

The parameter estimation result now includes a counter for failed constraints.

Fixed crash when deleting all global quantities.

Simulation Engine

Fixed temporary directory for export of Combine and Shiny archives to address security restrictions on MacOS X.

Stochastic simulation methods now correctly report whether they support events and thus whether they can be used for the simulation of model with events.

Standards

SBML import: Fixed issue where it was not possible to change the delay of an imported event.

SBML import: Fixed crash caused by particular unit definitions during importing.

SBML import: Fixed import of reaction kinetics which occasionally lost the parameter mapping.

SBML import: Handle references to missing modifier species in reactions gracefully.

SBML export: Reduced warnings about Model History not being exported to only check the model itself and not all model components.
