The Cry (Czech: Křik) is a 1964 Czechoslovak drama film directed by Jaromil Jireš. It was entered into the 1964 Cannes Film Festival. It is often described as the first film of the Czechoslovak New Wave, a movement known for its dark humor, use of non-professional actors, and "art-cinema realism". The film's events are ambiguous, leaving it to the viewer to determine whether the telling is objective or from a character's point of view (and if so, whose).
