        "text": "Perhaps you’ve opted out of Valentine’s Day, or are struggling against winter’s long slog—but really there’s no need for an excuse to seek out movies that will make you cry. Per the inimitable Nicole Kidman, movies have a unique power to provoke intense emotions, and frankly that may be all that’s separating us from the looming robots at this point. Plus shedding emotional tears is scientifically proven to release oxytocin and endorphins. (That’s why you sometimes feel refreshed or calmer after a good cry.) So whether you’re in the mood to get a little misty-eyed or are looking for a nice cathartic chest sob, enjoy below our all-time favorite movies for when you need a good cry.\n\nAll of Us Strangers (2023)\n\nIn Andrew Haigh’s wrenching fantasy-tinged drama, a reclusive screenwriter (Andrew Scott, in an Oscar-snubbed performance) embarks on an affair with a mysterious younger neighbor (Paul Mescal) while also encountering visions of his long-deceased parents (Jamie Bell and Claire Foy).\n\nAftersun (2022)\n\nBill Nighy earned an Oscar nomination for best actor for his moving portrayal of a bureaucrat in 1953 London who, facing a terminal illness, searches for meaning in life; also nominated was Nobel Prize–winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, who adapted the script from Akira Kurosawa’s 1952 film Ikiru.\n\nPieces of a Woman (2021)\n\nThis film, which follows a young married woman (Vanessa Kirby) as she struggles with the devastating death of her baby during childbirth, isn’t for the faint of heart, but Kirby’s restrained yet heartbreaking performance adds a new layer of texture to the cultural conversation about miscarriage and pregnancy loss.\n\nLittle Women (2019)\n\nThis moody and unabashedly queer love story from director Céline Sciamma is, in a way, all the more beautiful for the brevity of its central affair. In the film, Adèle Haenel plays Héloïse, a sullen 18th-century French daughter of privilege, and Noémie Merlant plays Marianne, the adventurous artist hired to paint her. A star-crossed romance ensues.\n\nA Ghost Story (2017)\n\nA rumination on time and grief, love and loss, David Lowery’s supernatural drama involves the sheet-bedecked ghost of a recently deceased man (Casey Affleck) who must observe in silence what happens in his house after his death.\n\nIngrid Goes West (2017)\n\nOkay, this movie is billed as more of a social-media romp than a tearjerker, and it’s easy to clock its quick pans through the Los Angeles of influencer culture and think of it as a comedy. At its heart, though, Matt Spicer’s film is about the devastating loneliness that propels one young woman to craft a fake identity around a friend crush, and without spoiling anything... let’s just say the ending is pretty painful to watch.\n\nManchester by the Sea (2016)\n\nThis Kenneth Lonergan film, which revolves around a depressed man taking care of his nephew after his brother dies, is practically a monument to depression. The bleary East Coast landscape only heightens the aura of despair in Manchester by the Sea, leaving you with a portrait of a family that’s guaranteed to make you call your mom and cry.\n\nInside Out (2015)\n\nRyan Gosling and Michelle Williams star as a troubled couple in this romantic drama, and they each brought enough pathos to their respective roles to be nominated for Oscars and Golden Globes. Rewatch the film, whose nonlinear narrative makes the emotional component all the more effective, and you’ll see exactly why.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)\n\nOkay, all the Harry Potter movies contain some element of sob-worthiness, but this one stands apart because it’s the one where, well, a certain beloved character dies. Are we just supposed to get through that scene without weeping?\n\nWendy and Lucy (2008)\n\nYes, it’s well-worn territory for musical-theater nerds, but the script for this filmic adaptation of the 1996 Broadway show is absolutely heartrending, with tunes like “One Song Glory,” “Without You,” and “I’ll Cover You” absolutely firing up the tear ducts. We will always love you, Angel!\n\nThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005)\n\nThis aughts classic has a reputation for being a sickly-sweet girl-power film, and it’s deserved. But the movie based on the Ann Brashares novel also gets into some incredibly sad territory, from the loss of Bridget’s mom to Carmen’s pain over her dad’s remarriage to...Bailey. (No spoilers, but that particular plotline is guaranteed to make you sob.)\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)\n\nThe all-too-real heartbreak of forgetting is explored metaphorically in this Michel Gondry–directed, Charlie Kaufman–penned movie about an estranged couple who opt to erase one another from their memories (but at what cost?).\n\nHotel Rwanda (2004)\n\nThis film about the Hutu-Tutsi conflict in Rwanda in the mid-1990s is guaranteed to have you full-on sobbing (when you’re not marveling at Don Cheadle’s acting chops, that is).\n\nThe Notebook (2004)\n\nEveryone’s favorite actor, Tom Hanks, is majorly tear inducing as the lovable hero of this film who navigates his way through an escalating series of wild situations only to find himself losing the love of his life.\n\nPhiladelphia (1993)\n\nOne of the first Hollywood films to explicitly address HIV/AIDS and portray homosexuality in a positive light, Jonathan Demme’s powerful legal drama stars Tom Hanks, in an Oscar-winning performance, as a lawyer who sues his employers for firing him after discovering he’s gay and living with HIV.\n\nMy Girl (1991)\n\nMeryl Streep delivers once again as a young Polish woman forced to make a morally impossible decision at Auschwitz and live with the consequences for the rest of her life.\n\nThe Way We Were (1973)\n\nFive words: “Your girl is lovely, Hubbell.” Do you really need to hear anything more to burst into tears? This 1970s Barbra Streisand classic set in the wild world of pre-WWII McCarthyism more than holds up as a study of two people who...just aren’t right for each other, no matter how much they want to be. (Sob.)\n\nBambi (1942)"
