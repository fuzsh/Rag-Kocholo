        "text": "Feature | English | USA\n\n​\n\nProduction Status: In Development\n\n​\n\nGenre: Horror | Sci-Fiction Thriller\n\n​\n\nTagline: A journey to the pits of Hell and back.\n\nAbout Curse of the Cry Baby:\n\nCurse of the Cry Baby, a Native American Horror/Sci-Fiction mixed media film about a town ravaged by the apocalypse. After her town is besieged by locusts and other plagues, DANIELLE discovers that one of her buddies is missing. She finds the “hellhole” where he is held captive and needs to convince the townspeople to face their fears and rescue him. Based on a Native Coharie legend, combining live-action and state-of-the-art animation, the film spotlights Native Americans in front, as well as behind the camera.\n\nFrom Emmy award-winning director, Keith Carter, and veteran award-winning producer, Carol Bidault de l'Isle comes Curse of the Cry Baby, a Horror/ Sci-Fi based on a Coharie Native American legend that shows the powers found within us and our tribe, combining live-action and state-of-the-art animation. The style of the production is similar to that of Robert Rodriguez's Sin City, and the narrative of The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Curse of the Cry Baby is a metaphysical journey that literally drags our protagonist through the deepest pits of Hell and back.\n\n​\n\nSTORY:\n\nDANIELLE, a 19-year-old, local native of Swamp Ridge, North Carolina, a member of the Coharie Tribe, attends the annual Powwow, where she, along with the rest of the townspeople witness a meteor fall from the sky nearby. Everyone feels the impact it causes.\n\nLater that night, AMOS and SARAH PICKER, Coharie villagers, are awakened by a haunting commotion coming from their barnyard. Amos goes to investigate and discovers that one of his prized cows has just given birth to a red heifer that is being eaten alive by a swarm of ravenous locusts. Unbeknownst to Amos, this grisly encounter is part of a series of apocalyptic events that are about to unfold, including an opening of a 'Hell Hole' which will release an ancient diabolical entity, the gatekeeper to the bottomless pit. This evil spirit captures JOHN, a troubled 20 year old of the village. The community comes together to beat the dark forces that engulf their land.\n\n​\n\nAbout the Coharie Tribe:\n\nThe present population of the Coharie Indian Tribe is located in the southeastern region of North Carolina, with the current tribal roll having 3,032 members. One of the nine Native American tribes of North Carolina, the Coharies descend from the aboriginal tribe of the Neusiok Indians and moved to their present location between 1729 and 1746 due to American colonial hostilities. Since this date, they have lived continuously as a Native American Tribe around the Little Coharie River.\n\nAbout the Coharie Myth of the Cry Baby:\n\nAccording to the legend, when Coharie mothers heard strangers approaching their village, they gathered their children, hid and softly whispered, “Shhh,” to quiet them until the strangers passed. You can hear the same sound today as the wind blows through the whispering pines of the forest.\n\nAbout the filmmakers:\n\n- Live-Action Director: Jerry Mosemak (IMDB link)\n\nJerry Mosemak a Native American of the Coherie tribe, has over 20 years of experience in interactive design, illustration, branding, animation, and storytelling on web, mobile, and print platforms.
