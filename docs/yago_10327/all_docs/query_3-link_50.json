        "text": "Most critics and audiences dislike Cry Macho, and I can’t really blame them. Its script has been through a lot: it was written in the 70s and got rejected by several studios before Fox bought it in the late 80s. At first, Eastwood turned it down and did another movie instead. Then it went through the hands of Roy Scheider, Pierce Brosnan, Burt Lancaster and ended up in Schwarzenegger’s. That’s right: In 2003, he was about to play the role but then became governor and stepped back from the project.\n\nIn 2020, Eastwood got on board again to direct, produce, and star in the melancholy western.\n\nI’m not exaggerating when I say that he’s simply become too old to do it by now. Thirteen years ago, he starred in Gran Torino with conviction and a threatening presence at 78. But Cry Macho at 91 is a bit of a stretch."
