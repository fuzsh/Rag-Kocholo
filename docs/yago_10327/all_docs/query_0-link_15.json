        "text": "Czech New Wave directors including Vera Chytilova (center), Milos Forman (second from right), Evald Schorm (to his left), and Jiri Menzel (far right).\n\nThe Czechoslovak New Wave was a movement in cinema beginning in 1963 and lasting until the end of the Prague Spring reforms of 1968. Led by students of the Film and Television School of the Academy of the Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU), the arrival of this new wave of cinema came about largely as a result of new directions in the arts generally and the pressure for social and political reform that developed both inside and outside of the Communist Party in the 1960s â a collective pressure that led to the abolition of censorship and the movement towards increased democratisation.\n\nThe three films that launched the wave were the debut features of Milos Forman (Black Peter), Vera ChytilovÃ¡ (Something Different), and Jaromil Jires (The Cry). They were followed by the work of a whole range of debut directors, among them Jan Nemec, Evald Schorm, Pavel JurÃ¡cek, Jan Schmidt, Ivan Passer, Jiri Menzel, Hynek Bocan, Juraj Jakubiso, Dusan HanÃ¡k, Elo Havetta, and Drahomira VihanovÃ¡. Each tended to go in different creative directions and find their own individual approaches, although their films often shared a common sense of humour, absurdity, pathos, and sometimes startling surrealism.\n\nWhile the attack on tradition and the falsifications of Socialist Realism was spearheaded by the younger generation, an older generation who had paved the way for the New Wave, joined in with the new freedoms of the 1960s and began producing some of their best and most groundbreaking work. Among them were Frantisek VlÃ¡cil, Stefan Uher, Vojtech Jasny, Karel Kacyna and the directing team of JÃ¡n KadÃ¡r and Elmar Klos who won the first Czechoslovak Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965 for their film A Shop on the High Street.\n\nDaisies, directed by VÄra ChytilovÃ¡ (1966)\n\nTaking advantage of the movementâs international success, some of its leading figures, such as Milos Forman and Vera ChytilovÃ¡, began making bolder attacks on the communist authorities. Formanâs The Firemanâs Ball (1967), set at the annual ball of a small townâs volunteer fire department, portrayed the corruption and incompetence at every level of society, while ChytilovÃ¡âs irreverent Daisies (1968) ridiculed the establishment through the anarchic pranks of two young girls who refuse to take any of it seriously. Other directors took their inspiration from Czech literature, most notably Jiri Menzel whose adaptation Bohumil Hrabalâs Closely Observed Trains won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1966, and Jaromil Jiresâs, whose adaptation of Milan Kunderaâs The Joke (1968) was described by Amos Vogel as âpossibly the most shattering indictment of totalitarianism to come out of a Communist countryâ.\n\nThe climate of liberalisation in Czechoslovakia that had allowed such creativity to flourish culminated in the 1968 Prague Spring when new leader Alexander Dubcek came to power. His plans to bring âsocialism with a human faceâ to Czechoslovakia through reform was quickly crushed, however, when Soviet and Warsaw Pact tanks rolled into the country and reinstalled the most hard-line communist government in the country since the Stalinist era. The intervention brought the Czechoslovak New Wave to an abrupt end and resulted in Milos Forman, Jan Nemec and others, fleeing the country to resume their career abroad. Others who remained faced censorship of their work or were, for some years, prevented from working in cinema at all.\n\nKEY DIRECTORS\n\nVÄra ChytilovÃ¡ Juraj Herz MiloÅ¡ Forman Jan NÄmec Dusan HanÃ¡k AntonÃ­n MÃ¡Å¡a VojtÄch JasnÃ½ JiÅÃ­ Menzel Jaromil JireÅ¡ Ivan Passer Pavel JurÃ¡Äek Evald Schorm Karel KachyÅa FrantiÅ¡ek VlÃ¡Äil\n\nKEY FILMS\n\nThe Sun in a Net by Å tefan Uher (1962)\n\nBlack Peter by MiloÅ¡ Forman (1963)\n\nLoves of a Blonde by MiloÅ¡ Forman (1965)\n\nThe Shop on Main Street by JÃ¡n KadÃ¡r and Elmar Klos (1965)\n\nIntimate Lighting by Ivan Passer (1965)\n\nPearls of the Deep by JiÅÃ­ Menzel, Jan NÄmec, Evald Schorm, VÄra ChytilovÃ¡, Jaromil JireÅ¡ (1966)\n\nClosely Watched Trains by JiÅÃ­ Menzel (1966)\n\nA Report on the Party and Guests by Jan NÄmec (1966)\n\nDaisies by VÄra ChytilovÃ¡ (1966)\n\nThe Firemen's Ball by MiloÅ¡ Forman (1967)\n\nMarketa Lazarova by FrantiÅ¡ek VlÃ¡Äil (1967)\n\nThe Joke by Jaromil JireÅ¡ (1968)\n\nThe Cremator by Juraj Herz (1969)\n\nThe Ear by Karel KachyÅa (1970)\n\nValerie and Her Week of Wonders by Jaromil JireÅ¡ (1971)\n\nOTHER FILMS OF NOTE\n\nThe White Dove by Frantisek VlÃ¡cil (1960)\n\nSomething Different by VÄra ChytilovÃ¡ (1963)\n\nThe Cassandra Cat by VojtÄch JasnÃ½ (1963)\n\nThe Cryby Jaromil JireÅ¡ (1963)\n\nThe Fifth Horseman is Fear by Zbynek Brynych (1964)\n\nKonkurs by MiloÅ¡ Forman (1964)\n\nDiamonds of the Night by Jan Nemec (1964)\n\nThe Hand (Ruka) by JirrÃ­ Trnka (1966)\n\nCoach to Vienna by Karel KachyÅa (1966)\n\nReturn of the Prodigal Son by Evald Schorm (1967)\n\nDeserters and Pilgrims (aka The Deserter and the Nomads) by Juraj Jakubisko (1968)\n\nAll My Compatriots by VojtÄch JasnÃ½ (1968)\n\nCapricious Summer by JiÅÃ­ Menzel (1968)\n\nOratorio for Prague by Jan NemÄc (1968)\n\nValley of the Bees by Frantisek VlÃ¡cil (1968)\n\nAdelheid by Frantisek VlÃ¡cil (1969)\n\nBirds, Orphans and Fools by Juraj Jakubisko (1969)\n\nBehold Homolka by Jaroslav PapouÅ¡ek (1969)\n\nThe Gala in the Botanical Garden by Elo Havetta (1969)\n\nLarks on a String by JiÅÃ­ Menzel (1969)\n\nA Ridiculous Gentleman by Karel KachyÅa (1969)\n\nFruit of Paradise by VÄra ChytilovÃ¡ (1970)\n\nCase for a Rookie Hangman by Pavel JurÃ¡Äek (1970)\n\nmany others!\n\nThis article is a brief overview.
