        "text": "Czech New Wave directors including Vera Chytilova (center), Milos Forman (second from right), Evald Schorm (to his left), and Jiri Menzel (far right).\n\n“The Czechoslovak New Wave was a movement in cinema beginning in 1963 and lasting until the end of the Prague Spring reforms of 1968. Led by students of the Film and Television School of the Academy of the Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU), the arrival of this new wave of cinema came about largely as a result of new directions in the arts generally and the pressure for social and political reform that developed both inside and outside of the Communist Party in the 1960s – a collective pressure that led to the abolition of censorship and the movement towards increased democratisation. The three films that launched the wave were the debut features of Milos Forman (Black Peter), Vera Chytilová (Something Different), and Jaromil Jires (The Cry). They were followed by the work of a whole range of debut directors, among them Jan Nemec, Evald Schorm, Pavel Jurácek, Jan Schmidt, Ivan Passer, Jiri Menzel, Hynek Bocan, Juraj Jakubiso, Dusan Hanák, Elo Havetta, and Drahomira Vihanová. Each tended to go in different creative directions and find their own individual approaches, although their films often shared a common sense of humour, absurdity, pathos, and sometimes startling surrealism. While the attack on tradition and the falsifications of Socialist Realism was spearheaded by the younger generation, an older generation who had paved the way for the New Wave, joined in with the new freedoms of the 1960s and began producing some of their best and most groundbreaking work. Among them were Frantisek Vlácil, Stefan Uher, Vojtech Jasny, Karel Kacyna and the directing team of Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos who won the first Czechoslovak Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965 for their film A Shop on the High Street. Taking advantage of the movement’s international success, some of its leading figures, such as Milos Forman and Vera Chytilová, began making bolder attacks on the communist authorities. Forman’s The Fireman’s Ball (1967), set at the annual ball of a small town’s volunteer fire department, portrayed the corruption and incompetence at every level of society, while Chytilová’s irreverent Daisies (1968) ridiculed the establishment through the anarchic pranks of two young girls who refuse to take any of it seriously. …”\n\nNew Wave Film\n\nW – Czechoslovak New Wave\n\n10 Essential Films From The Czech New Wave\n\nDiscover one of the hidden gems of the Czech New Wave\n\nCzech New Wave Cinema: The Children of Marx and Kafka\n\nCzech New Wave Cinema and Věra Chytilová\n\n[PDF] Surrealism In and Out of the Czechoslovak New Wave\n\nCriterion: The Eclipse Viewer – Episode 31 – Pearls of the Czech New Wave [Part 1] (Audio)\n\nYouTube: Czech New Wave Video Essay, Understanding Experimentalism in the Czech New Wave"
