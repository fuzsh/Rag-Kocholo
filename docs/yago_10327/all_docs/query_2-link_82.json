She feels the first stirring of sexual awareness when a carnival parade comes to town and a man presents her with a pair of magic earrings. When her fantasy adventures begin, the line between dreams and reality starts blurring.\n\nMUBI's take\n\nInspired by fairy tales such as Alice in Wonderland, this surreal movie from Czech director Jaromil Jire≈° is a subtle, evocative exploration of the grotesque. Banned by the pro-Soviet regime of the time, Valerie and Her Week of Wonders daringly breaks the many rules of conventional narrative.\n\nNot showing in your country\n\nGet access to this film plus 2159 more films showing in other countries via a VPN subscription.\n\nWe've partnered with NordVPN to get you 70% off on your subscription.
