In one of these flashbacks, her Australian fiancé, Alistair, receives word that his ex-wife in Australia is preparing a custody battle over his teenage daughter Chloe. Reluctantly Joanna decides to travel with him, bringing their infant son Noah. On the flight to Australia, Joanna lashes out at a passenger when complaints of Noah’s crying get out of hand. After landing, Alistair and Joanna continue their journey by car, stopping at a shop to buy supplies. When they return to the car Noah has mysteriously disappeared.\n\n2Episode 2Glendyn IvinJacquelin Perske7 October 2018 ( )6.52\n\nDetectives Peter Alexiades and Lorna Jones arrive to lead the investigation. They treat Noah's disappearance as a kidnapping for ransom and focus on Alexandra's movements. Joanna suffers nightmares about a boy in a field after a bushfire. Alistair is concerned that her odd behaviour will turn the public against them and begins coaching her in how to handle the media. She ignores Peter's advice and uses a mobile phone to follow the case on social media. Alexandra lies to the police about her movements but admits to creating a fake Facebook profile to stalk Joanna. She is arrested when one of Noah's bootees is found in her home. A witness claims to have seen Joanna and Alistair fighting hours before Noah's disappearance. A flashback reveals that Noah was not in the car when Joanna and Alistair stopped to buy supplies.\n\n3Episode 3Glendyn IvinJacquelin Perske14 October 2018 ( )6.68\n\nIn the hours after arriving in Australia, Joanna discovers that Noah died in the back seat of the car. He is apparently a victim of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, but Alistair convinces Joanna that she will be charged with manslaughter. He comes up with a plan to cover up Noah's death, parking outside the shop because he knows it is near the route Alexandra uses when running. He later takes Noah's body and buries it. Alexandra is released and the charges dropped; Alistair confronts her and it is implied that he was violent toward her when they were married. Joanna continues to obsess over social media coverage of the case, but realises that Alistair's handling of the media is making her look guilty. She concludes that he will sacrifice her to save himself. In the present Joanna is about to be sentenced; not for Noah's death, but for Alistair's murder.\n\n4Episode 4Glendyn IvinJacquelin Perske21 October 2018 ( )7.35\n\nFour months after Noah's death, Joanna and Alistair return to Scotland where they struggle to move on with their lives. Joanna receives a message from a passenger on the flight to Australia, which triggers a memory: after arriving in Melbourne, Alistair gave Noah medicine not realising that it had been prescribed to Joanna and causing Noah to overdose. Realising what had happened, he let Joanna believe she was responsible. Joanna begins to suspect Alistair has been lying and the two go for a drive. She accelerates recklessly, causing him to lose his temper and admit his role in Noah's death. Joanna releases Alistair's seatbelt and deliberately drives off the road, killing him. Joanna is found not guilty of his murder, but it is a hollow victory as many people—including Chloe—believe that she is still responsible for Noah's death. She returns to Australia to be close to his memory. Noah's body is never found. But Joanna realises Alistair buried Noah under the concrete pad of a new house which she has bought.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Cry is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Helen FitzGerald.
