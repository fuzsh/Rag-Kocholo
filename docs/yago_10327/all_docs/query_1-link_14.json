        "text": "A year before the psychedelic Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (1970), Jaromil Jires constructed a tremendously masterful, politically charged, anti-Communist statement that works both as a collage of a multi-faceted, folkloric society, and as a fragmentary tale of unclichéd love and payback.\n\nAs it is notorious in the New Wave movement, The Joke questions the validity of Czechoslovak politics in a context of modernity, encompassing the army, art, intellectualism, and with negative nods to certain trends such as Cubism, Marxism, and consequently Trotskyism, the major school of direct Marxist heritage. This is the subtext that pervades the story about a man that was expelled from his University by a seemingly unanimous vote after a handwritten joke by him directed…\n\nI think if The Joke was actually a joke it would go a little something like this:\n\n\"Why did the chicken cross the road?\"\n\n\"To escape the crushing physical and mental subjugation by communist Russia that gradually washed over Eastern Europe in the decades after World War 2, and the deeply ingrained national guilt that followed the initial exuberance in adopting a seemingly beneficial-for-the-common-folk system of government.\"\n\nYeah, those Czechs were a barrel of laughs.\n\nThe Joke is interesting in that it takes a much less allegorical stance as opposed to others of the movement I've seen, yet also benefits by being more direct in its criticism, letting a rube like myself become more involved in the story at hand.…\n\nThe Joke, directed by Jaromil Jireš, is one of the most scathing indictments of Communism to come out of the Czechoslovak New Wave film movement. It was also one of the Czechoslovak New Waves’ last films. The films centers around a man name Ludvik Jahn, a cynical scientific researcher who goes to visit his hometown to conduct an interview with a reporter there. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn of Jahn’s past life and how, as a student, he was kicked out of the Communist party for a joke he played on his girlfriend. In the flashbacks that are sprinkled throughout the movie, we learn why Jahn is trying to seek out revenge on an old friend in the…\n\nQuite unlike Jaromil Jires more notable feature Valerie and Her Week of Wonders whereas that film being steeped in fantastical surrealism, The Joke is a realist account of an oppressive political atmosphere and the yearning for revenge due to the damage it has caused.\n\nWhile the plot seems fairly straightforward, Jires structures the film in non-linear format with paralleled editing that slowly reveals the reason behind the protagonist's cold nature and desire for vengeance from an incident during his college years. The movie is impeccably crafted itself and even without fantasy content to film like with Valerie and Her Week of Wonders and lack of color to boot, Jires was able to make this film every bit as visually stunning…\n\nBut a world where nobody is forgiven; such a world is hell.\n\nLudvik has returned to his hometown after a decades-long absence. Unable to enjoy any of the places and things he used to love, he is consumed with memories of the betrayal he endured at the hands of friends, and of the subsequent years he spent doing hard labor and being “re-educated” at a military camp - all for offending communist party officials with a thoughtless joke.\n\nBut as fate would have it, he ends up meeting the wife of one of those friends, and a plan begins to form in his mind…\n\nThough billed as a black comedy, I didn’t find the film to be funny at all.…\n\n“It’s not you I wanted to beat up”...\n\nI suppose nothing is new in life. Although unlike the present day squalls of (social media) censorship and faux-indignation, there was actually something to react against in Czechoslovakia, or at least work out of.\n\nThis tale makes the point in caustic extremis: expulsion from University and the Communist Party into hard army labour for taking a modest anti-party line.\n\nYet nowadays across the West the pious scourge of ‘Cancel Culture’ wrings life out of many a truthful or even anodyne situation where tact, discretion or common sense should prevail. Instead a pariah-like tail is pinned on too many a donkey for speaking their mind, in anger or jest.\n\nIt’d be crass and…"
