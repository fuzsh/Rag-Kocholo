        "text": "Asher Keddie in ‘The Cry.’\n\nAsher Keddie and Alex Dimitriades have joined the cast of The Cry, the four-part psychological thriller commissioned by the BBC.\n\nNow shooting in Melbourne, the drama directed by Glendyn Ivin stars Ewen Leslie as Alistair, an Australian political adviser working for the British Labour Party, with Jenna Coleman (Victoria, Doctor Who) as his wife Joanna.\n\nWith their baby the Scotland-based couple go to Australia to see Alistair’s mother Elizabeth (Stella Gonet) and to fight for custody of Alistair’s daughter Chloe (Markella Kavenagh).\n\nKeddie plays Alistair’s former wife Alexandra. Joanna and Alistair are forced to face an unthinkable tragedy when their baby is abducted.\n\nKavenagh recently starred in Romper Stomper and Picnic at Hanging Rock. The cast also includes Shareena Clanton (Wentworth, Nowhere Boys).\n\nJacquelin Perske (Seven Types of Ambiguity, Spirited) wrote the screenplay based on Aussie author Helen FitzGerald’s eponymous 2013 novel.\n\nIt is the first scripted TV commission for Scottish-based production company Synchronicity Films headed by creative director Claire Mundell, supported by Film Victoria and Creative Scotland.\n\nThe ABC will screen the series, which will also shoot in Glasgow, later this year. ABC head of distribution, entertainment and specialist Rebecca Heap said: “With the amazingly talented and popular Asher and Alex joining the cast, this is truly a first class international production.\n\n“I was completely drawn to The Cry’s universal themes coupled with its unique and distinctive Australian elements and we are thrilled to be able to share this gripping drama with our audiences later in the year.”\n\nSynchronicity produced several feature films including Andrew Haigh’s Weekend, Justin Molotnikov’s Crying with Laughter and John McKay’s Not Another Happy Ending."
