Of course it's very dated now, and shoehorning gags and songs for the Bygraves character doesn't help matters, but it nevertheless remains an interesting document of its time.\n\nThe film largely concerns itself with three storylines; a trio of young siblings headed up by the self sufficient Barbie who become orphans when their father murders their mother during a drunken fight, Georgie, a young harmonica playing boy who believes his mother is a successful cabaret artiste touring…\n\nThis got a BAFTA nod for Best British Screenplay and you can easily see why.

Ann quickly forms an add-on to the kids, who come from terrible backgrounds. Ann is also taken with Bill Lowther (Max Bygraves) as well.\n\nBarbara Murray gives a good performance in her role as the woman who acts like she is determined to look after the children and make their lives…"
