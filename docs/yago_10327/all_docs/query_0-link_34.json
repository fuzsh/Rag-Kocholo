        "text": "A manifesto for a new generation of young filmmakers, Pearls of the Deep is one of the delights of the Czechoslovak New Wave. Based on stories by Bohumil Hrabal, the film is a compendium of five films each demonstrating the differing styles of five emerging filmmakers: JiÅÃ­ Menzel (The Death of Mr Batazar), Jan NÄmec (The Imposters), Evald Schorm (The House of Joy), VÄra ChytilovÃ¡ (At the World Cafeteria), and Jaromil JireÅ¡ (Romance).\n\nEach vignette displays unique approaches to Hrabal's multi-faceted tales of ordinary people and odd obsessions. Ranging from the surreal to the satirical and the romantic, the films capture the essence and spirit of Hrabal's work, and emerge as a joyous rallying cry for subversion and artistic expression.\n\nSecond Run present the world Blu-ray premiere of Pearls of the Deep from a brand new 4K restoration. Our region-free Blu-ray also includes Ivan Passer's A Boring Afternoon and Juraj Herz's The Junk Shop, two additional films based on stories by Hrabal that were originally intended to be included in the film, a 1967 short film interview with Hrabal, plus a booklet with new writing on the films by author and Czechoslovak cinema expert Peter Hames.\n\nâGenerally anarchist and scaldingly farcical, the films look totalitarian life square in the eye, but theyâre also living testaments to the eraâs lovable, grungy Euro-slacker esprit...\n\nall five films are compelling time capsules of defiance and loveâ Village Voice\n\n“Fascinating... lucid and hallucinatory”\n\nPenelope Houston, The Spectator\n\n“Effectively representing the ambition and freewheeling disregard which would come to mark the entirety of the Czech New Wave” Jordan Cronk, Slant Magazine\n\nâA turning point for the young New Wave... all of the filmâs directors would immediately go on to make major, internationally recognized worksâ Michael Koresky\n\nâHrabalâs darkly comic, allegorical stories made him an inspiration to the New Wave directors. In his writing, one can find elements that they all used in their films, notably his dry absurdist sense of humor mixed with moments of surrealism and his satiric jabs at the Communist government disguised as a critique of corrupt and inept power in generalâ Pop Matters\n\nâSuch was the variety in aesthetic and narrative approaches, indicative of the breadth of directions the New Wave filmmakers would pursue overall, that Pearls of the Deep came to be regarded ipso facto as a manifesto of the Czechoslovak New Waveâ Senses of Cinema\n\nâUniformly excellent. Each director revels in the possibilities of CinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ©-style filmmaking, making great use of evocative natural lighting and real-world locations... they display a rich and energetic interest in the lives of ordinary people, and all the joys and woes that come with themâ Czech Film Review\n\n“Pearls in the Deep, was in a certain sense, the Manifesto of the New Wave. With the exception of MiloÅ¡ Forman, who was at the time working on A Blonde in Love, all the major representatives of the movement took part in the filmâ\n\nJosef Å kvoreckÃ½"
