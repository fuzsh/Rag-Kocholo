        "text": "The Criterion Collection is a distribution company that specializes in “important” classic and contemporary films. Through Hulu, many of these films are made available to stream. Once a week, I like to illuminate a Criterion movie — to deepen one’s understanding of filmmaking and film history. This week’s movie: “Valerie and Her Week of Wonders” (1970)\n\nIf F For Fake was the hardest film I have watched, Valerie and Her Week of Wonders ranks high on the list. In this case, I come away with a few more positives.\n\nAs my deeper plunge into the Criterion Collection continues, I look to watch as complete of a pool of films as I can. Though many chose to study and watch a director’s or actor’s complete cannon of films, I like to mix it up. A Russian film one week. A French New Wave film another. This week I chose a Czechoslovakia film — a country which has not existed since 1992.\n\nValerie and Her Week Of Wonders is a 1970 films from director Jaromil Jireš. Based on the 1932 novel of the same name written by Vítězslav Nezval, the film depicts the story of a 13-year-old girl living in a dream-like world, filled with vampires, sadistic priests and other elements that blend the fantasy and horror genre. It stars Jaroslava Schallerová as Valerie, the 13-year-old trying to survive in this horrific dream world. The film is described as a “surrealist” film, which gives you quite an idea about how this film is going to go.\n\nI am always open to giving a film a chance, especially one that dabs into the world of horror. Visually, this film is incredible. It is shot beautifully, where the camera seems to be perfectly place to create suspense and glides when moving. I truly appreciated the folk-y look this film showcases. The film was shot in the Czech town of Slavonice. Filming on location gives the film a depth and “realness” to this world that is completely ridden with make believe characters and events. In the film, the town is a small, European town. Despite the fantasy elements running around, the town felt very of the era. While watching, I felt like I was in a time machine, going back and experiencing life in this small town. I credit that to shooting on location and the masterful direction by Jaromil Jireš.\n\nAdding to the folksy charm of this film is the music. The composition of the orchestra is sublime, with chorus arrangements that are beautiful. The music fits the visual style the film has, which deepens the connection to the film’s setting and characters.\n\nIn terms of characters, this film has plenty to appreciate. Jaroslava Schallerová is perfect as Valerie. She’s sweet, innocent, but also smarter than she looks. As she learns and experiences this world she lives in, her knowledge of the fanatical characters around her grows. She uses that to her advantage. You really she a growth in the young girl from beginning to the end of the film.\n\nThe other characters stick out visually. Valerie’s grandmother is pale, and has white makeup all over her face. She looks ghastly. The horror characters — most notably a demonic looking hooded figure — are striking and horrific. They creep you out and stick with you long after the film ends. I always appreciate successful world bolding, and Valerie and Her Weeks Of Wonders is a dreamy, folk, European world that I really enjoyed watching.\n\nI just had no idea what the hell was going on.\n\nReading some comments on Hulu and other reviews, this film is ranked high on “WTF happened in this film” lists. Like the style the film creates, the plot takes on a dreamy life of its own. Scenes float from one to another, with no real transition or purpose. Characters come and go, and things are not explained. A perfect example is early in the film Valerie meets a guy willing to offer some help. They are in the town square; the man is atop a fountain. Suddenly, he is chased away by shirtless men with whips, as musical chanting is heard in the background. The scene cuts to a new one, with little explanation of the previous one. This is incredibly common throughout the film, and hindered my overall enjoyment of the film.\n\nI am always a plot first guy. We see with movies like The Neon Demon, ones that are incredibly beautiful but with little plot, garner attention but quickly fade away. With the religious connection of the priest and fantasy elements, there is a larger message being relayed in Valerie and Her Week of Wonders. However, when stripped down to its core, it fails to deliver on its beautiful production. The style, music and world creating in this film is top quality. Its story and plot fail on mostly all levels.\n\nWithout a doubt, I loved coming across this film and being a part of Valerie’s world. I am glad to have this experience stored away. This film will stick with you. However, when all said and done, I can not rate this movie to recommend. I can say there is enough here to grab and enjoy. Give it a whirl!\n\nWant more from CineNation?"
