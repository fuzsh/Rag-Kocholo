        "text": "The editing technique “cutting for continuity” is among the oldest and most common in motion pictures, condensing time while preserving fluidity in the telling of an event.\n\nThis essential modus operandi is comprehensively reconsidered – and at times thrown out of the window entirely – in the ABC’s terrific, twitchy, gasp-inducing four-part series The Cry, which airs its first episode on Sunday night and is an early contender for 2019’s best Australian show.\n\nThe series – a co-production with the BBC, where it premiered to acclaim and 6 million viewers last year – is directed by Glendyn Ivin, who helmed the best Australian television production of 2018: SBS’s intensely gripping and morally complex asylum seeker drama Safe Harbour.\n\nIvin and the screenwriters (Helen FitzGerald and Jacquelin Perske, adapting FitzGerald’s novel) emphasise the rearranging of sequences in ways that must have made the role of editor Alastair Reid either refreshingly straightforward or hellishly complicated. I suspect the latter.\n\nIn any event the results are extraordinary, in a production that’s thrillingly impressive across the board – with a great script, great acting, classy cinematography (from Sam Chiplin) and a philosophically chewy premise.\n\nThe show, filmed in Australia and Glasgow with a majority Australian cast, is part confessional drama, part abduction thriller, part whodunit, part portrait of a marriage skidding off the rails. Joanna (Jenna Coleman, from Dr Who) and her husband Alistair (Ewen Leslie, who recently starred in Safe Harbour and The Butterfly Tree) grapple with the sudden loss of their baby boy Noah. On the street one night, they return to their car from the supermarket to discover he is missing from his baby seat. Who took him, and why?\n\nThe couple are naturally suspects themselves, including – and especially – in the court of public opinion. Alistair has professional skills he can put to use to shape the media narrative, gleaned from his experience as a spin doctor for a British politician. But the detectives (Alex Dimitriades and Shareena Clanton) are also interested in Alistair’s ex-wife Alexandra (Asher Keddie), who is fighting him for the custody of their teenage daughter Chloe (Markella Kavenagh).\n\nIt is a tangled web we weave, as the old saying goes – an expression the show’s visual structure, even its raison d’être, seems to be infused with, acknowledging that life’s ethical conundrums are easily encountered and difficult to solve. In the first scene in episode one, Joanna exits a house where a media scrum are waiting outside. She turns the door handle, wearing a beautiful red dress, but by the time she is on the other side of it her outfit is blue. An impossible costume change – or it would be, if these smoothly integrated images belonged to the same time and place.\n\nAcross four twisty episodes we grapple with big questions (“What happened to the baby?”) while contemplating smaller ones (“When did what we’re seeing occur, and why have disparate events been weaved together?”). Armed with new information, viewers are then returned to scenes previously cut short, and encouraged to re-evaluate them; we learn more not just more about who the characters are, but who they were, in a nonlinear structure that feels as though it’s living, evolving, mutating.\n\nFrom an early point there are suggestions that certain parties are suspect, in one way or another, with question marks placed over their behaviour and also over the fragmented window with which we view them. Yet the revelations still surprise us, chill us, move us, thrill us. Ivin and co give us information while taking it away, mixing red herrings and fake-outs, tricking us into believing things are becoming clearer as certain aspects of the experience are increasingly obscured.\n\nColeman is a hugely captivating performer, oscillating between extreme vulnerability and strength, from grief to confusion, courage to cowardice. Keddie also goes through the wringer emotionally: a thoroughly distraught and opaque, difficult to read performance. And the always excellent Ewen Leslie packs a hell of a punch, very skilfully navigating a terribly complex network of emotions.\n\nThe actors are supported by the script’s penetrative grasp of human behaviour: the surprising ways people respond to difficult situations; the emotions and instincts competing inside ourselves; the things that make us reach out and the things that make us close off.\n\nThe Cry is a brilliant, gobsmacking drama, empowering the audience by taking away the liberation of perspective, balancing our natural response to emotionally feel the tragedy by forcing us to rationalise it. This extraordinary, moving production is sure to be one of television events of the year."
