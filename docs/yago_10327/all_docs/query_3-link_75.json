        "text": "Congratulations! Why did you make your film?\n\nSHANE: I came up with and wrote the whole script in 15 minutes at 4 AM one night when I couldn't sleep. Three months later, we were all done with it. No time to really think about the \"why\". I guess I should dedicate the film to my sleep-paralysis demon.\n\nCELINA: Shane's idea also came at a time when we were ready to get out there and make something again. He and I had just finished writing our first feature together, and the idea of diving head first into an impulsive fever-dream short was exciting!\n\nImagine I’m a member of the audience. Why should I watch this film?\n\nCELINA: It's short, tense, and twisty! Also, if you're a fan of the 1976 Mercedes 230s, you're gonna have a ball!\n\nHow do personal and universal themes work in your film?\n\nSHANE: A lot of horrors is about finding the monstrous in everyday things. A beach, a clown, the dark. I'm interested in finding humanity in the grotesque. In my life, I try to be a forgiving and open-minded person whenever possible, and I believe I am happier for it. My work comes out of that perspective.\n\nHow have the script and film evolved over the course of their development?\n\nSHANE: We went into production so quickly after the story's conception that we didn't have much time to tweak anything. Particularly with shorts, I tend to think through the sequence of shots as I'm first writing. The movie is surprisingly close to that initial idea I had in my head.\n\nCELINA: The entire team was aligned with Shane's vision. That's part of the magic of working with trusted collaborators: you already have a common language that allows you to achieve what might otherwise be impossible.\n\nWhat type of feedback have you received so far?\n\nCELINA: Dances With Films is our World Premiere, so we're excited to finally invite in an audience and all of their thoughts!\n\nBut feedback is also an important part of the creative process. Especially during post-production, it can be necessary to see your work through a fresh pair of eyes. In our case, it helped us refine the film's pacing. But you also have to remember that you can never please everyone. At the end of the day, you have to trust yourself and your vision as a filmmaker.\n\nHas the feedback surprised or challenged your point of view?\n\nSHANE: As our DP (Matt Kleppner) and I were creating the shot list, he really pushed me to get specific in describing the film's emotional turning point. I'm very driven by instinct, but when I take the time to translate my intuition into something I can communicate to my collaborators we're all able to do our best work.\n\nWhat are you looking to achieve by having your film more visible on www.wearemovingstories.com?\n\nCELINA: We want people to get psyched to see our little movie! In all seriousness, we're very proud of The Perfect Place to Cry. It can be so hard to make work that is creatively fulfilling, especially as an actor. This is an opportunity for us to show the world who we are, what we can do, and what we care about.\n\nWho do you need to come on board (producers, sales agents, buyers, distributors, film festival directors, journalists) to amplify this film’s message?\n\nSHANE: We're at the very beginning of our film festival run, and would love to connect with more festivals that might be interested in our empathetic horror short. Speaking with journalists will allow us to showcase our film and ourselves, presenting it as a calling card for everyone involved. Our goal is always to make genuine connections with like-minded people, whether they be producers, festival directors, journalists, or representatives.\n\nWhat type of impact and/or reception would you like this film to have?\n\nCELINA: We just hope that it finds its audience! We love to create a community with everything we do, so meeting people who appreciate our vision is incredibly important.\n\nWhat’s a key question that will help spark a debate or begin a conversation about this film?\n\nSHANE: Does horror still work when it comes from a perspective that aims to empathize with all parties involved? I'm always curious about this question. For that reason, I've long had a hard time categorizing my shorts as horror. But as I've been told many times, if there's blood, it counts!\n\nWhat other projects are the key creatives developing or working on now?\n\nCELINA: Right now we're really focussed on writing. Shane and I co-wrote our first feature screenplay in 2022. It was a huge (and wonderful) surprise to both of us when it won first place at Filmquest 2022. Now we're waiting to hear back from more competitions, writing our next scripts, and slowly working towards producing our first feature."
