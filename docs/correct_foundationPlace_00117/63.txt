You don't say if you're looking at existing pre-owned houses, existing

new houses, or having a house built, so my comments may or may not apply.

In January '92 we closed on a house we had Brian Homes build for us.

Mike Lawson (owner) was very friendly and seemed helpful at first,

but once we signed a contract and construction started, it was very

difficult to actually get in touch with him and his employees tended

to give us the runaround.

We ended up having to send a threatening letter (mentioning a lawyer)

before they would fix a problem we had with water coming into the

garage. Before sending the letter, we had hasseled with them for

about six months during which they kept telling us that they would

have to regrade part of our lot to fix the problem. Everytime men

came out for the work, they "sealed" the foundation instead of

regrading. The work was completed within a couple of weeks of the

letter.

Their workers (or subcontractors) rarely did more than a barely adequate

job. They slopped over simple details frequently, especially the paint.

We finally gave up on getting them to finish a couple of minor items

on the punch list when we realized that they wouldn't (or couldn't)

do it right.

It may sound like I'm being harsh on Brian Homes, but there are

plenty of builders around who are worse. Still, if we build another

house we won't use Brian Homes because they're too difficult to deal

with.

My advice for dealing with Brian Homes is to get an inspection done

(don't use anyone recommended by Brian Homes) and refuse to close

until every little detail on the punchlist is completely fixed.

Don't move in before closing unless they agree to let you live there

rent free until closing. (Once you start paying rent, you're covering

their interest expenses on their building loan for the house.)

I can share more details by email if you're interested.

Has anyone put a few thousand dollars in a trust account that gets paid

to the builder at the end of the first year? This would (hopefully)

guarantee that the builder would fix any problems that came up. If they

weren't fixed, the owner could use the money in trust to fix the problem

and give the remainder (if any) to the builder at the end of the year.

Another thing I just thought of would be to pay the builder $X/12 each

month from the trust account to give some incentive to fix any problems

within a month or risk not getting their monthly "payment".

I have never heard of this, and wonder if this sort of arrangement could

be done? Of course, if you mention the "l" word (as Jim did), you can

usually get some action, and I suspect the BBB would help too.

In the terms we used, we set up an escrow account upon closing on the house.

We put a $ value on all the items on our punch list and arranged with our

builder and mortgage company to put this money in an escrow account. If

we were satisfied that after so many days the items were suitably fixed, then

we would sign over the money to the builder. If after so many days the

builder did not fix these things the mortgage company would return the

escrow money to us so we could pay for the repairs ourselves. As it turned

out, our builder went bankrupt (thankfully after our house was adequately

finished; our items on our 'escrow list' were not potentially hazardous or

damaging) we got the money by default.

Be aware that your builder should be made aware of this escrow deal before

closing, and in fact, the builder has to sign an agreement of understanding

of this escrow account, otherwise the builder's going to expect full payment

at closing.

This is a common arrangement, and should be considered by all new homebuyers.

BTW, there are lots of books about homebuying and I learned a great deal

from one by Peter Miller (I think it was called "Buy Your First Home Now!").

If you're a first-time homebuyer, I highly recommend gaining as much

practical education as possible on the subject prior to even looking for a

house.

I will echo Jim's assesment of Brian Homes. Last spring I thought they were

building me a custom house, but they really built their standard house with

any upgrades I specified. The plumber put the outside faucets where he wanted

to, not where I specified on the blueprint. The electrician put telephone

connections where he wanted them, not where I wanted them. Also, the electrician forgot to install the cable TV outlets, and I had to threaten to

delay closing before he put them in. In hindsight, I really should have

delayed closing until everything was fixed, or broke the sales contract.

Before closing, Mike kept talking about his one year warranty, but I have

found it is easier to get a budget through Congress than to get Brian Homes

to do any warranty work.

I could list my many problems with my house, but will follow Jim's example

and give details by email if you want them.

/**********************************************************************/

Talking about builder, we bought a house in Chadrick from a builder

(who lived in the house) in late 1991. Our offer was accepted by the

builder subject to a satisfactory inspection by a home inspector hired

by buyer (us).

The inspector found some damaged wood among some other things that

need replacement since the builder has been living in the house himself

with his family for 3 years.

We have it in the contract that then that these damaged wood need to

be replaced and painted before closing.

Above from never showing up to do any of the unfinished list that was

listed down during the closing.

We have a bad leaks in August 1992 (less than 1 year after we closed).

We have someone from Sears Home Improvement came over, the guy quickly

detected that there were some damage woods that were cover and painted

over and the cracks now are causing the leaks. The leaks had resulted

in an area of damage in our ceiling.

I called the original home inspector to take another look, he came

and recognize the same situation. He wrote us a witness statement, stating

that these are the same piece of woods he listed that needs replacement

and his best estimate for the replacement.

We go ahead and have the Sears Home Improvement Subcontractor (not the

home inspector) do the repair, took picture before they started on the job.

The builder refused to reimburse us of the full amount of repair cost.

Being a matter of principle, I take this matter to small claim court with

my husband.

The judge award us a judgement against this builder for the total amount

of repairment cost in our receipt plus the cost of court fees. We have

not recover the money, but if he dare to refuse to pay, we can put a judgement

lien on all his real property on sale. Since a judgement lien is a general

lien not a specific lien. We actually spend a lot more time and money than

what we can recover from this builder, but it is the principle that counts.

We only sue for the repair cost and the court fees anyway.

Neither side had any lawyer, we did do our research well, I even attended

real estate licensing class to analyze the inside-out of law of contract.

We even attended some other court hearings prior to our scheduled hearing.

My advice to home buyer, don't penny pinched and pound foolish. I am very

thanksful that we spend $125 on the home inspector before we buy the house.

We got his name through recommendation of a friend. His witness statement

plus the photos taken were our strongest material of evidence. The builder

try to say that there was a hail storm in August last year. But the photos

shows clearly that it is not holes or peels problem, but rather you can

see a thick layer of caucks on wood and paint over it.

If you are interested with the name of this builder, write me or my

husband, we will be more than happy to tell you his name. He does not have

a company name, so there is not much help to check him with Better Business

Bureau. His phone number changes as well everytime he moves to one of his

unsold house.

P.S. "caveat emptor"

In Alabama law, it is 'buyers beware' policy. So when a builder

recommended that an inspector is just a waste of money and that his

every step of construction is approved by the city inspector. Think

twice before you decide. Ask around, how many buyer you know

have build a new house and have a leaking roof after the first big

storm. Did that builder came to fix it quickly before further damage

occur ? Will he fix the damage resulted from the leaks as well ?

Ofcourse, having an inspector is useless unless it is specified in

your offer that it is subject to a satisfactory inspection by a

home inspector of the buyer.
