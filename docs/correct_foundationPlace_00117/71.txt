Directa is a document-centric application set combining numerous capabilities to deliver a comprehensive solution for common industry problems. Focused on the company's area of domain expertise, Directa addresses problems overlooked by conventional document management products, solving specific issues such as transmittals (controlled distribution of documents), plant structures (relating tags, assets, documents), and design tool integration (import of 2D schematics, connectivity, classifications), to mention a few of the many capabilities.

It provides management, distribution, control, update, audit, and automation of all the tasks required within a document-centric environment.

Additional modules such as AIM/Workflow with standard features such as event notification (notify specific users of specific actions, such as document deletion, revision, or update) and a comprehensive revision management capability means that Directa offers the most wide-ranging, secure mechanisms for controlling and managing change within an organization.

It is in use today within leading EPCs and owner/operators solving their day-to-day document-centric problems, but also providing a firm foundation to migrate into a more data-focused environment if necessary.
