        "text": "City in Alabama, United States\n\nCity in Alabama, United States\n\nMadison is a city located primarily in Madison County, near the northern border of the U.S. state of Alabama. Madison extends west into neighboring Limestone County. The city is included in the Huntsville Metropolitan Area, the second-largest in the state, and is also included in the merged Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area. The population was 56,933 at the 2020 census.[4] Madison is bordered by Huntsville on nearly all sides with some small unincorporated lands within Madison in Madison and Limestone counties.\n\nMadison was mostly a small city for many years, with its population being around 400-500 for much of its history until the Redstone Arsenal was established to the southeast, which attracted many people to the area for jobs. This rapidly increased the city's population and stimulated economic growth. Many of Madison's residents work in Research Park or the Redstone Arsenal. Madison has been one of the fastest-growing cities in Alabama, as well as one of the wealthiest in the state.[citation needed] In 2022 census estimates, Madison was the 9th largest city in Alabama, The 8th densest city in Alabama, and the second largest city in North Alabama After Huntsville.[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area was occupied historically by the Koasati (also known as Coushatta), a Muskogean-speaking people. Before them were thousands of years of indigenous cultures.\n\nMadison's first European-American resident was John Cartwright, who settled in the area in 1818. The city was originally known as \"Madison Station\", as it developed in the 1850s around a stop of the Memphis & Charleston Railroad. Textile mills were built in the area in the late 19th century for processing and manufacture of cotton products.\n\nMadison was the site of a battle in the American Civil War. On May 17, 1864, Col. Josiah Patterson's 5th Alabama Cavalry, supported by Col. James H. Stuart's cavalry battalion and a section of horse artillery, drove Col. Adam G. Gorgas's 13th Illinois Infantry Regiment from the city. Patterson's men captured the 13th Illinois Regiment's wagon train, taking 66 prisoners. They also burned Union supplies and tore up the railroad tracks before retreating. Portions of the 5th Ohio Cavalry, the 59th Indiana Infantry, and the 5th Iowa Infantry were sent in pursuit from Huntsville. They skirmished with Patterson's rear guard that evening at Fletcher's Ferry on the Tennessee River south of Madison.\n\nThe town was incorporated on December 2, 1869.[7] From 1880 to 1950, rural Madison had a population of some 400-500 residents.\n\nIn the World War II and postwar period, military and NASA operations were moved to Huntsville, stimulating an increase in population in the region. Subsidized highways stimulated suburbanization, attracting residents to outlying areas where new homes were built. By 1980, Madison's population was 4,057. In the late 20th century, Madison's population increased rapidly as it developed as a suburb of Huntsville. In 1986, Madison voters overwhelmingly voted to remain independent by not merging with Huntsville.[8] By 2010 its population had grown to 42,938, and over the following ten years it grew to a population of 56,933.[9]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 30.694 square miles (79.50 km2), of which 30.563 square miles (79.16 km2) is land and 0.131 square miles (0.34 km2), is water.[2]\n\nMadison is located at (34.711236, -86.731024),[10] primarily within Madison County, while extending west into Limestone County. Downtown Huntsville is 11 miles (18 km) east of the center of Madison, although Huntsville also borders Madison to the south and west. Athens is 17 miles (27 km) to the northwest, and Decatur is 16 miles (26 km) to the southwest, across the Tennessee River.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1880410—1900412—19104263.4%19204352.1%1930431−0.9%19404555.6%195053016.5%19601,435170.8%19703,086115.1%19804,05731.5%199014,904267.4%200029,32996.8%201042,93846.4%202056,93332.6%2023 (est.)60,854[5]6.9%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nMadison racial composition[12] Race Number Percent White (non-Hispanic) 37,194 65.33% Black or African American (non-Hispanic) 8,367 14.7% Native American 175 0.31% Asian 4,426 7.77% Pacific Islander 73 0.13% Other/Mixed 3,410 5.99% Hispanic or Latino 3,288 5.78%\n\nAs of the 2020 census, there were 56,933 people, 20,787 households, and 15,540 families residing in the city.[13] The population density was 1,875.1 inhabitants per square mile (724/km2) There were 21,980 housing units.\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 42,938 people, 16,111 households and 11,770 families residing in the city.

Currently, they are working on a streetlight maintenance program for Madison. Thousands of Madison residents commute to jobs at Cummings Research Park and Redstone Arsenal in nearby Huntsville, about 12 miles away. The high-tech and academic positions in the area have attracted numerous highly educated, professional residents.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Madison City School System, formed in 1998, serves over 10,000 students from the city of Madison and town of Triana.[15] It has consistently been rated as one of the best school systems in the state. The current superintendent is Dr. Ed Nichols. Nationally, it ranks in the top 5 best school systems.[citation needed]\n\nThe school system currently has seven elementary schools serving grades K-5 (Columbia Elementary School, Heritage Elementary School, Horizon Elementary School, Madison Elementary School, Mill Creek Elementary School, Rainbow Elementary School, and Midtown Elementary School), three middle schools serving grades 6-8 (Discovery Middle School, Journey Middle School, and Liberty Middle School), and two high schools serving grades 9-12 (Bob Jones High School and James Clemens High School). There was formerly an additional elementary school, West Madison Elementary; however, it is permanently closed and planned to be adapted as a pre-K center.[16] Madison Elementary, built about 1936, is the oldest school in the system while Journey is the newest, opening in 2023.\n\nIn 2019, Madison residents approved a voluntary property tax increase in order to fund school growth and expansion. These funds were used to build Midtown Elementary School (completed in 2020)[17] and were also used to construct Journey Middle School, opening for the 2023–2024 school year.[18]\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Madison Record[19] and the Madison County Record[20] have been newspapers for the city since 1967.
