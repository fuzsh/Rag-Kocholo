        "text": "This automated engineering solution helps reduce document search and validation time, extract intelligence from unstructured data from contractors, and discover inconsistencies during project execution.\n\nTrustworthy engineering data and documentation is essential to both effective project delivery and safe, efficient operations. EPCs and owner operators alike struggle to manage large volumes of unstructured, unintelligent information –documents, drawings, models, lists, and datasheets, which exist in multiple formats and are found scattered in various locations.\n\nSmartPlant® Fusion is a breakthrough solution to help you find, capture, organize, link, and visualize large volumes of engineering data and documents through a simple web portal. SmartPlant Fusion is the fastest way to establish a single point of access to all your engineering information."
