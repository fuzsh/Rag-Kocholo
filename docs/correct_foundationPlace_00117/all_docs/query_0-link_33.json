Upon the authority of thecharter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has amandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientificand technical matters. Dr. Bruce Alberts is president of the NationalAcademy of Sciences.\n\nThe National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, underthe charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organizationof outstanding engineers. It is autonomous in its administrationand in the selection of its members, sharing with the National Academyof Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government.The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineering programsaimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research,and recognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. RobertM.

The Institute acts under the responsibilitygiven to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charterto be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own initiative,to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr.Kenneth I. Shine is president of the Institute of Medicine.\n\nThe National Research Council was organized by the National Academyof Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad community of science andtechnology with the Academy’s purposes of furthering knowledge andof advising the federal government. Functioning in accordance withgeneral policies determined by the Academy, the Council has becomethe principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciencesand the National Academy of Engineering in providing services tothe government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities.The Council is administered jointly by both Academies and the Instituteof Medicine. Dr. Bruce Alberts and Dr. Robert M. White are chairmanand vice chairman, respectively, of the National Research Council.\n\nPREFACE\n\nThe Mapping Science Committee serves as a focus for external adviceto the federal agencies on scientific and technical matters relatedto spatial data handling and analysis. The purpose of the committeeis to provide advice on the development of a robust national spatialdata infrastructure for making informed decisions at all levels ofgovernment and throughout society in general.\n\nWithin the context of the above mission statement, the committeeissued a report in 1993, Toward a Coordinated Spatial Data Infrastructure for the Nation, that articulated its vision on how spatial information handlingmight best be approached from an organizational perspective. Thereare, of course, many specific issues that are raised when examiningwhat a national spatial data infrastructure (NSDI) encompasses. Thecommittee, with liaison from the Federal Geographic Data Committee(FGDC; operating under the aegis of the Office of Management andBudget), is undertaking a series of focused studies to examine individualcomponents of the NSDI. The need for this study was discussed ata joint meeting of the FGDC and the Mapping Science Committee onFebruary 2, 1993. One purpose of the study was to initiate a discussionaimed at identifying activities and data products that would supportthe NSDI. During the course of its study, the committee became convincedthat a solid foundation of spatial data could enable (with the appropriatestandards) the sharing and exchange of spatial information amongthe entire user community and alleviate many of the problems of spatialdata integration.\n\nIn assembling the present report the committee struggled with a varietyof concepts, competing priorities for spatial data production anddata management, accuracies and resolution, and definitions. Thecommittee did not think that it was within the scope of this studyto suggest specific mechanisms for how such a foundation and frameworkdata should be produced; these will reflect a variety of governmentaland private sector priorities and will be market driven. In addition,the committee recognized early in its study that questions of resolutionand accuracy were highly dependent on the specific applications.As such, the purpose of this report is to discuss general principlesand guidelines that would help make the NSDI more robust.\n\nThrough five committee meetings and several ad hoc meetings of portionsof the committee (meetings of opportunity), the present committeereached agreement on the content of the report. Those members ofthe committee whose terms ended in December 1993 were active participantsand contributors to these meetings but were not present at the June1994 meeting when agreement was finally reached; they did, however,have the opportunity to review and comment on the report.\n\nOne of the factors that influenced the committee in reaching itsapproach to the report was Executive Order. 12906 (“CoordinatingGeographic Data Acquisition and Access: The National Spatial DataInfrastructure,” signed by President Clinton on April 11, 1994).This order identifies three specific framework data categories thatshould be available by 1998 for support of the decennial census inthe year 2000. These three categories were prominent in the committee’s deliberations from the outset of our study. In late 1993 the FGDCassembled a working group of its own on framework geospatial data,with its report to be ready near the end of 1994. Several membersof the Mapping Science Committee met with this working group in May1994 to discuss various concepts related to the FGDC working group’s task. There was a fairly high degree of coincidence among manyof the concepts in this report and those being developed by the FGDCworking group."
