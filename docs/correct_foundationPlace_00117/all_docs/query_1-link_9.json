        "text": "Structural objects are imported and exported from Smart 3D using the CIMsteel Integration Standards 2.0 (CIS/2).\n\nYou can export only concrete objects such as slabs, walls, structural systems, openings on slabs and walls, footings, equipment foundations, members, trenches, and designed equipment to the Industry Foundation Class (IFC) format. The designed equipment must have an equipment classification of civil elements or structural elements and must consist of designed solids and shapes. Equipment shapes and equipment components under designed equipment are not exported to IFC.\n\nSteel members can be exported only through the CIS/2 format. You can also export objects to IGES, ACIS, and neutral XML formats using File > Export commands available when in the Molded Forms or Structural Detailing tasks.\n\nImporting and Undo\n\nBecause of the system resources required to support Undo, it is possible for you to import a file where you cannot undo the import. The ability to undo is driven by the number objects in each object type being imported. The undo limit can be calculated with this formula:\n\nroundUp(members/100) + roundUp(slabs/100) + … + roundUp(stairs/100) £ 10\n\nwhere:\n\nmembers, slabs, stairs, and so forth are the number of objects in the import file segregated into these object types:\n\nroundUp - Round up the result of (members / 100) to the next whole number. For example, if you have 45 members in the import file, 45 / 100 = .45, so members count as 1. However, if you have 367 members in the import file, 367 / 100 = 3.67 so members count as 4.\n\nThe sum total of all object types must be 10 or less for Undo to be available.\n\nExample: Your import file has 432 members, 25 slabs, 15 ladders, 69 openings.\n\nroundUp(432/100) + roundUp(25/100) + roundUp(15/100) + roundUp(69/100)\n\nroundUp(4.32) + roundUp (.25) + roundUp (.15) + roundUp(.69)\n\n5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8\n\n8 is less than 10 so you will be able to Undo your import if needed.\n\nIndustry Foundation Class\n\nIndustry Foundation Class (IFC) was developed by buildingSMART (International Alliance for Interoperability, IAI) to facilitate interoperability in the building industry. For more information about IFC, go to http://www.buildingsmart.com.\n\nSmart 3D provides limited support for IFC by exporting only concrete slabs, walls, structural systems, openings on slabs and walls, footings, equipment foundations, and design equipment (with an equipment classification of civil elements or structural elements) to the Industry Foundation Class (IFC) format. Linear and curved concrete members cannot be exported to IFC. We recommend the CIS/2 format for transferring linear and curved members.\n\nCIS/2 Import and Export\n\nCIS/2 was authored by The Steel Construction Institute and the Computer Aided Engineering Group School of Civil Engineering at the University of Leeds to facilitate a more integrated method of working through the sharing and management of information within and between companies involved in the planning, design, analysis, and construction of steel framed building and similar structures. For more information about CIS/2 in general, go to CIS/2 web site.\n\nSmart 3D provides limited support for:\n\nimporting of manufacturing models\n\npartial importing and exporting the analytical model (available only in the Structural Analysis task)\n\nimporting and exporting the design model\n\nCIS/2 Limitations\n\nThere are some limitations when importing and exporting the design model and analysis model through CIS/2:\n\nMembers imported from a design model CIS/2 file are standard or designed Smart 3D members depending on the cross-section specified in the CIS/2 file. Frame connections are created during import and are set to Axis-Along with X, Y, and Z offsets defined if the connection information is provided in the CIS/2 import file. Assembly connections are created during import if the connection information is provided in the CIS/2 import file.\n\nAccording to the LPM/6 schema, both the AXIS2_PLACEMENT_3D and its associated location (CARTESIAN_POINT) are GEOMETRIC_REPRESENTATION_ITEM entities. As such, either or both can be assigned a unit through the REPRESENTATION entity. Smart 3D first attempts to retrieve the units assigned to the AXIS2_PLACEMENT_3D entity. If none are found, Smart 3D uses the units assigned to its associated CARTESIAN_POINT entity. If units are not assigned to either entity, then the units are considered to be in standard MKSAR (meters) units. If units are assigned to the AXIS2_PLACEMENT_3D entity, any units assigned to CARTESIAN_POINT are not used.\n\nWhen importing members from a CIS/2 file exported from FrameWorks Plus,® tapered members are ignored. Members with workpoint offsets are read in at the physical location of the workpoint offset, but no analytical information is retained. In addition, all member end releases are set to User defined - Free. However, the FrameWorks Plus member name is assigned to the Smart 3D member, and the rotation and reflection settings of the member are maintained.\n\nFrameWorks Plus solids are ignored. FrameWorks Plus slabs are imported with bottom face orientation regardless of the face setting in FrameWorks Plus.\n\nOnly member section size changes can be imported from an analytical model CIS/2 file.\n\nThe software exports only the operation geometry for handrails, stairs, and ladders to the design model.\n\nThe path of curved members that are exported and then re-imported lose any constraints that may have been applied to the original path.\n\nSlabs are always read into the model using a sketch 3-D path. You can edit the slab path after the import, if needed. No grid lines associated with the slab are imported, and there are no constraints assigned to the slab.\n\nThe assembly_design_structural_member_planar entity is used to represent a slab or plate if it’s planar_member_type is “plate” (and Smart 3D is installed); otherwise, it is imported as a slab. Plate Systems are bounded by a single, continuous and closed 2-D curve\n\nDesigned members (members composed of individual plates) are not exported to CIS/2 using the individual plates. However, the designed members are exported to CIS/2 as standard members of the same size.\n\nBased-on CIS/2 Statement for Import\n\nThe translators for this application have been implemented in accordance with the second release of the CIMsteel Integration Standards (CIS/2.0) for the following (combination of) Conformance Classes:\n\nCC312+CC110+CC118+CC249, CC312+CC111+CC118+CC259, CC278\n\nThe vendor places the following riders on the operation of the translators:\n\nNo riders.\n\nBased-on CIS/2 Statement for Export\n\nThe translators for this application have been implemented in accordance with the second release of the CIMsteel Integration Standards (CIS/2.0) for the following (combination of) Conformance Classes:\n\nCC312, CC110, CC118, CC255, CC331, CC100, CC308\n\nThe vendor places the following riders on the operation of the translators:\n\nmanaged_data_deleted, managed_data_creation, and managed_data_transaction are not exported.\n\nIf you have any questions about using this translator, please contact customer support.
