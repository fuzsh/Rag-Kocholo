I can certainly see a good argument for Intergraph putting the\n\nCLIX baseline and bootfloppy images up for download since they are of no use\n\nto anyone without a CLIPPER machine, and anybody with one should be entitled\n\nto access to these things that were bundled with the machine.\n\n>\n\n> Once thing, though, that a source release would expose is whether\n\n> CLIX uses the AT&T or BSD date routines.

Along with most vendors (other than Sun/AT&T) nobody wanted to do SVR4\n\nin the late 80's because it was so controlled by Sun (can anybody say Java\n\n:-). As a result the big effort to produce a unified UNIX created a new\n\nschism with the formation of the Open Software Foundation and its b*****d\n\nchild OSF/1 (cries of \"splitters\" a-la The Life Brian sprung to mind.)\n\nIntergraph was on the OSF/1 side of the schism.\n\nWe did actually start working on a OSF/1 port for CLIPPER, but it never got\n\nvery far as the OSF was collapsing under it's own wieght by the time it had\n\nanything approaching a kernel source tree to port. The big OSF/1\n\nannouncement was made a IGUG in 1992, I know because I did the technical\n\npresentation to the Systems and Networking SIG. What they didn't know at the\n\ntime (and I did :-) was that Intergraph's commitment to an OSF/1 port was\n\nall but dead in the water as we were in advanced stages of negotiating the\n\nNT deal with Microsoft. Infact, by the fall of 1992 I had to stand up in\n\nfront of much the same audience at FALLGUG and tell them that everything\n\nthey heard in my presentation at Spring GUG was a crock :-)\n\n> Actually, AIX is to this day an SVR3 derivative, but IBM made some\n\n> really massive changes to its innards, adding things like long\n\n> filenames, infinite inodes, volume management, their own TCP/IP stack,\n\n> and so on.

Saying that\n\nAIX is a SVR3 derivative is like admiring the longevitiy of the proverbial\n\nHillbilly's axe, it's had the blade replaced twice and the handle three\n\ntimes :-)\n\n--\n\nNik Simpson\n\nJust my two cents here, but other than the lawsuit with Intel over the\n\nclipper technology, why would Intergraph NOT release the programming\n\ninfo into the public domain? At one time, field service was basically\n\nsupporting Intergraph through maintenance contracts.

At least it\n\nwas *possible*...Microsoft had ordained that NT would only be ported to\n\nbig-endian processor architectures. That excluded Sun but left the\n\nRS6000, the MIPS chip (SGI), the DEC Alpha, and presumably the Clipper.\n\nAt the time, Microsoft didn't want the world to think that NT was meant\n\n\"only for PC's\". Since then, as the Intel chips have gotten faster and\n\nthe marketplace has come to accept hardware as a commodity, they've\n\npulled the plug on the other ports one at a time.\n\nActually, at the time Intergraph made public their intention to move\n\neverything to NT, there was a plan put in motion have Howard Sachs and\n\nthe rest of the Clipper processor group go to work for Sun (they just\n\nmoved to a Sun facility across the parking lot from their old digs in\n\nPalo ALto) and take with them some design stuff to go into the\n\nUltraSparc, one of which was a \"byte-sex switch\". This would have\n\nallowed the next generation of Sun hardware to handle an NT port.\n\nSomewhare along the way, that fell by the wayside.\n\nJust think, even\n\n> the source for even a start at porting Winnt for CLIX would help out\n\n> TONS for the porting of LINUX to CLIX.\n\nThat's probably even less likely than releasing CLIX for free.\n\nMicrosoft has retained proprietary rights to each and every detail of\n\nNT's design.

Part of the original deal between Ingr\n\nand MS was that Ingr could put NT on a CLIPPER platform. The platform it\n\nwould run on, bore no resemblance to any CLIX machine ever shipped. The\n\nprototypes of the CLIPPER/NT platform were publically demonstrated at AEC\n\ntradeshow in Atlanta in 1993. They were very \"alpha\", NT 3.5 didn't so much\n\nrun on them as stumble drunkenly from BSOD to BSOD. That was about as\n\nadvanced as the port ever got. The hardware had a PC bus structure (EISA)\n\nand was packaged inside a 2xxx series chassis. There were a number of issues\n\nthat were never satisfactorily resolved, these included:\n\n1. Hardware paging management, the low level paging algorithms of NT at that\n\ntime matched quite closely the hardware architecture of the MIPS 3000/4000\n\nCPU, this was radically different to CLIPPER and lead to serious performance\n\nissues.\n\n2. Microsoft had no intention of porting any of its applications to the\n\nCLIPPER/NT platform (just like they didn't for other RISC platforms)\n\n3. Intergraph by that time had recognised that it did not make financial\n\nsense to continue throwing money at CPU development for a platform that\n\nwould, in a good year, sell maybe 20K CPUs.\n\n4. The CLIPPER C400 was rapidly being overtaken in performance by Intel x86\n\nprocessors like the 66MHz Pentium launched in 1993.\n\nWith these and other issues in mind, the CLIPPER/NT port was inevitably\n\nstillborn. However at the time the need for a RISC based platform was still\n\nsomething that seemed important. So when the CLIPPER development on C500\n\narchitectures was canned, the engineers from APD (Intergraph's Advanced\n\nprocessor Division) were effectively sold to Sun. The original intent was to\n\ndevelop a byte sex switchable SPARC architecture that could host a SPARC/NT\n\nport. As part of the deal Intergraph would then sell these SPARC/NT boxes.\n\nThe problems with this included:\n\n1. Doing anything at Sun with NT was a political minefield, a situation that\n\ndidn't improve with time.\n\n2. The work was being done on a 32bit SPARC architecture that was rapidly\n\nbeing abandoned in favor of the 64bit UltraSPARC by Sun.\n\n3. Assuming everything went perfectly, at least problems 2&3 from the\n\nCLIPPER/NT port still existed and arguably problem 4 was still an issue,\n\nparticularly for a 32bit SPARC platform.\n\n4. By the time anything started to happen on this, Intergraph Computer\n\nSystems was aggressively pursuing the idea of x86 based workstation\n\nproducts.\n\nWith both Sun and Intergraph lukewarm about the whole thing, it came as no\n\ngreat surprise when Sun canned the project before it even got as far as the\n\nCLIPPER/NT platform.\n\n>Does anyone here have more info on this?
