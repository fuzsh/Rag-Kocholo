        "text": "MADISON – Fair, and possibly some food fare, take on new meanings when the Rocket City Trash Pandas return home Tuesday to their second homestand of the season.\n\nWhen the baseball team returns, an actual “rides-games-and-cotton-candy-and-funnel cake fair” will begin and overlap the last four games of a six-game series at Toyota Field. The Trash Pandas host the Knoxville Smokies all next week, and The Big Ol’ Ballpark Fair will is back in town April 25-May 5.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n“It’s definitely a unique scenario since the fair hasn’t overlapped with games before, but it’s something that all of us as a staff here are very excited about,” Logan Bourandas, media relations associate for the Trash Pandas, told 256 Today. “We have a good plan put in place regarding parking, a shuttle system and just the overall partnership we have with the fair.”\n\nThe Trash Pandas ran their record to 7-5 as pitcher Michael Darrell-Hicks picked up his third win of the young season Thursday in a 5-3 victory over Pensacola. It was Rocket City’s third-straight win. Last week, the Trash Pandas took their first series of the season by defeating Birmingham four games to two.\n\n“The opening homestand went really well,” Bourandas said. “The first few days had its challenges with the weather but once we got through that, things went really smoothly, especially for a first homestand of the season.”\n\nFree parking for the Big Ol’ Ballpark Fair for April 25-28 will be available at Hexagon on Intergraph Way in Madison, less than two miles away from Toyota Field. Guests who are only attending the fair should park there, where there will be shuttle buses running continuously back and forth for pickup and dropoff.\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE PARKING MAP FOR APRIL 25-28.\n\nFor guests being dropped off and picked up directly at the fair via car, that spot will be at the intersection of Town Madison Blvd and Stadium Way. For the remainder of the dates (April 29 to May 5), fair parking is $10 per vehicle on-site at Toyota Field. There will not be any parking at Hexagon on those days.\n\nFans with tickets to a Trash Pandas game on those nights will also receive free admission to the fair on that same day. However, guests at the fair do not automatically have admission into the baseball games. Trash Pandas tickets can be purchased at the Wicks Family Foundation Box Office.\n\nALL DETAILS ABOUT THE FAIR CAN BE FOUND HERE.\n\nTRASH PANDAS HOMESTAND VS.
