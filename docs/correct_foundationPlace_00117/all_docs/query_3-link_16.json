        "text": "Allan Van Horn\n\nAllan Van Horn\n\nSPID Administrator and SME at Motiva\n\nPublished Mar 15, 2016\n\nSmartPlant Implementation/Integration Overview\n\nI am always being asked by SmartPlant System Developers how to develop a SmartPlant System to do the things they wish to do with it. My question back is always, how much money do you plan to spend, and how much do you wish to change the default set-up?\n\nIn raw cost SmartPlant is a killer when compared to tools such as ACAD, Microstation, Visio, and Paint. And there is always some 3rd party knock off claiming to do what SmartPlant does for 1/2 the cost. (Until you buy it and install it and realize nothing works and you became the development guinea pig)\n\nWhich in the end will cause you to can the cheep version and go buy the actual SmartPlant tool, so you might as well save the time and money and just get SmartPlant.\n\nSmartPlant has two set up options, one costs way less but you will have to have more staff and allot of development.\n\nSmartPlant Integration using Foundation - If you want Intergraph to be nice and do everything you ever wanted them too, this is the path you have to take. The only thing is you CANNOT make any modifications from the system Intergraph installs. If you do, then Intergraph will charge you for all the extra work you create, where as if you had left it alone Intergraph will fully support it as is.\n\nSmartPlant Integration Using Import/Export - This is not recommended my Intergraph, but it is what most Owners and EPC's are doing. This option treats each tool as an island, and the import/export reports are the ships that sale between them. You are free to customize everything to death, but you run the rick of breaking automation and neglecting any free help from Intergraph.\n\nFoundation:\n\nIt is as it is named, the foundation for the integrated SmartPlant system. All data/Metadata/documentation flows inside this tool and is sent effortlessly to the tools that need it.\n\nExample: V-1234 normal fluid level needs to change from 12' to 14', the process engineer makes the change in the data on the PFD, this in turn sets off a chain reaction. (V-1234 Datasheet ->PFD -> MSD -> PID -> 3D) But not just in the tools, alerts are sent to the affected departments to agree with the change. (Process Engineer -> Lead Process Engineer -> Mechanical Engineer -> CAD -> Piping Manager -> Estimating -> Procurement -> Project Controls -> Document Control -> Project Management -> Client)\n\nDepending on the project completion level (Revision) and the severity of the change, the ripple can be quite large, but this allows for items being changed ONLY if they are true, not just someones like/want/midnight dream revelation.\n\nOperating in a Foundation environment will create the need for a Foundation Team which works very closely with all departments but is partnered with Document Control. Yes, the little ladies everyone is always crapping on is now in charge of the data flow of the whole project, and engineers just can't toss things at them and say fix it. Foundation has VERY strict rules which ALL users must follow, no exceptions. So yes, a Document Controller CAN reject your work and refuse it until it is done correctly.\n\nSmartPlant Import/Export (Stand Alone)\n\nIf you have been doing engineering since the 1800's and you never want to change a darn thing because it has always worked this way...this is your best option as it has the most flexibility. I said most, you can still brake it being stubborn and not following the rules in place by Intergraph.\n\nIntergraph will not refuse you, they will build every tool exactly how you want it, for a few million, oh but guess what, good luck keeping it working once Intergraph moves on form it and upgrades the tools to the 2020 versions, and your still stuck in 4.3 because you spent 6 million making SmartPlant exactly as you want it and now your tech teams cannot upgrade the versions. And Intergraph stopped supporting your version 3 years ago. So you can either get on board and do it as the tools are intended, stay old, or buy new and spend another 5 million having Intergraph modify it again.\n\nCurrently SmartPlant has all inclusive tools except Process Engineering tools, but by 2018 Intergraph should have those also. In the mean time here is an overview of the tools needed.\n\nAspen One for Process Engineering and Aspen Icarus for Estimating\n\nSmartPlant PID/S3D/SPI/SPEL/SPRD, etc. (SmartPlant Suite, see web page)\n\nSmartPlant functionality in its raw form works perfectly out of the box, but it is set-up to be integrated via Foundation. If you do not wish to use Foundation due to the cost and upkeep, then each tool will need to be slightly modified to send the desired data to the tool users and departments.\n\nHow it works, The data base data is entered using a document interface, either a datasheet or a drawing. This data is then reported/extracted from the document into excel. That excel file is specially formatted for the tool it will be uploaded into. The Excel file is then imported by the desired tool and the data auto populates the fields provides/linked. Foundation does this live as items change as long as the other end exists. (Yes for data to flow, the object must exist and be named the same on both ends) Tools that talk directly using a single command is called automation. Some tools have internal automation due to the fact that data was already imported and rules were defined. (SmartPlant Reference Data - Pipe Specs, Commodity Codes) (Others - PIP Instrument Details, Aspen Equipment Data, etc)\n\nTo do the above you need to hire an Implementation Team to just get it done, if you try to do this internally you will take a year or two just training your users, then another 2 years using trial and error on how to make things work. By then you have tossed your hands in the air, and either pulled the plug saying SmartPlant is crap, or you had to go pay millions to Intergraph to fix your mess. If you would have hired a SmartPlant Implementation Team you and your users could be in the tools working in less than a year, and a fully working and work practice documented rule system by 2 years. Like the trend so far, that is when you would dissolve the SmartPlant implementation team. (Stinks for the Imp Team, but saves the company years of effort and millions in cost)\n\nFor the above Imp Team to work, ALL work practices and \"THIS IS HOW WE DO IT!!!\" has to end, the new system MUST be the new standard and cannot be deviated from.\n\nIf more information is desired on this subject, fee free to contact myself or my fellow SmartPlant Implementation Team members from my friends list. (SK) A simple lunch and learn might save your company a huge mess. Also, please listen to the SmartPlant Tool Owners/SME's, they really do know what they are talking about. Engineers do not know everything, but they do know allot.\n\nHelp improve contributions\n\nMark contributions as unhelpful if you find them irrelevant or not valuable to the article.
