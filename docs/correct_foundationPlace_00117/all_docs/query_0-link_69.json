CITY MANAGER'S REPORT (6.1) Mr. Bassett reported on a Resolution Amending Fee Schedule for Park Forestry, Recreational Activities and Facilities. Mr. Bassett stated that on March 14, 1988 the City Council adopted a Resolution Establishing the Fee Schedule for Park and Forestry Recreational Activities and Facility; however, the parking fee at Hiniker Pond was not included in the fee schedule. Mr. Bassett stated that staff is recommending to charge $.75 per car at Hiniker Pond. Mr. Knapp asked Mr. Bassett if the City presently allows parking from the highway to the gate. Mr. Bassett stated that the City does City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 133 not allow parking from the highway to the gate. Ms. Lofy stated that Hiniker Pond has become quite a recreational location; however, she has also been approached about the parking problems. Mr. Knapp asked if there could be a bus that would stop at Hiniker Pond. Mr. Bassett stated that if there was a bus, it wouldn't stop at the right hours or even on the weekend when Hiniker Pond is heavily used. Mr. Faust asked Mr. Bassett if there would be a person on duty every hour that the Hiniker Pond is open to collect the parking fee. Mr. Bassett stated that there would be an employee on duty every hour that the facility is open. Ms. Sheran asked Mr. Bassett if there is a capacity limitation at Tourtellotte Pool. Mr. Bassett stated that there is a capacity limitation at Tourtellotte Pool and the limitation is set by State law. Mr. Bassett stated that the entire water area is used to determine capacity. Therefore, Hiniker Pond is a unique situation in that the entire water area can not be used. Ms. Sheran stated that since there is no capacity limitation, this should be one area in which staff should review especially for the safety perspective. Ms. Lofy stated that the traffic problem at Hiniker Pond is an indication as to how many people can be there. Ms. Lofy suggested that staff give people a two week notice about the parking fee before enforcing it. Mr. Knapp asked how close does the bus system get to Hiniker Pond. Ms. Sheran stated that the bus system goes as far as the Best Western Garden Inn which would be less than one- half of a mile for people to walk to Hiniker Pond. Mr. Knapp stated that he is concerned that there is another means of transportation for people to get to Hiniker Pond instead of driving their personal vehicles. Ms. Sheran suggested that perhaps there would be some way to connect the summer youth pass program for the bus system with this parking problem at Hiniker Pond, and encourage youths to use the bus system and avoid paying the $.75 per car fee. Mr. Bassett agreed, and stated that Mr. Ewert, Mass Transit Director, could be in charge of this concept. Ms. Lofy suggested that the parking fee be posted at Hiniker Pond. Ms. Sheran agreed, and she recommended that a sign be posted which stated where the bus stops for access to Hiniker Pond. Mr. Just asked if there could be an option of a seasonal pass available to citizens. Mr. Bassett stated that the option of a seasonal pass for $10 could be provided. Ms. Lofy moved and Mr. Knapp seconded a motion to adopt a RESOLUTION AMENDING FEE SCHEDULE FOR PARK AND FORESTRY RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND FACILITIES, and to include an option of a seasonal parking pass for $10. With all members voting in favor, the Resolution was adopted. (6.2) Mr. Bassett reported on the increase of County landfill closure fees.

Mr. Bassett stated that the notice of opening will be published for two weeks with an application deadline of Friday, June 24, 1988.

Mr. Bassett stated that the list should be amended to include the Mankato East High School's Girls Softball Team. APPEARANCES (8.1) Ann Christenson, coordinator of the Blue Earth County Historical Society, appeared before the Council to report on the Historical Society's fundraising. Ms. Christenson stated that the Blue Earth County Historical Society is proposing to have the City restore the Hubbard House as Mankato's 1990 project. Ms. Christenson stated that approximately $700,000 has been allocated in State Legislature for proposed Minnesota 1990 projects, and the Historical Society is requesting that the City apply for funds for the restoration of the Hubbard House. Ms. Christenson stated that the Historical Society is requesting that the City commit the Hubbard House as their 1990 project, and that the City commit funds for the project whether the State funds are received or not. Ms. Christenson stated that when the project is completed, it will be a tourist attraction for visitors and conventions. Mr. Knapp asked Ms. Christenson how much the Historical Society is requesting from the City. Ms. Christenson stated they are requesting not less than $50,000 over a three-year period. Ms. Christenson stated that they are requesting the City's participation due to its track record and the writing of grants. Ms. Sheran stated that the City doesn't necessarily have to partake in this as far as providing funds; the request is to have the City designate the Hubbard House as its 1990 project. Ms. Lofy stated that the City is to match the State's contribution. Ms. Lofy stated that personally she likes the idea of a 1990 project; however, this should be discussed in budget sessions and perhaps put in 1989's budget. Mr. Faust asked Ms. Christenson if there is a deadline for commitment in order to write the proposal. Ms. Christenson stated that she is unaware of any deadlines as they have not received the guidelines from the State. Mr. Faust suggested that Ms. Christenson contact the City when the guidelines are received. Ms. Sheran suggested that a method be looked at for giving of charitable dollars. Ms. Sheran suggested that perhaps the 10 percent designated tax received from charitable gambling could be used for projects and requests such as these as it would be one source of funds that would be available without increasing tax dollars. Ms. Christenson stated that restoration of the Hubbard House would be an investment for the City in that would attract people, and Mankato needs a tourist attraction. Ms. Christenson stated that it would be an economic asset. Mayor Carstensen questioned how this project would be a revenue producer or an economic asset as it would not produce revenue for the City of Mankato. Ms. Christenson stated that the tourist attraction would help the business community. Mayor City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 137 Carstensen stated that the restoration is only a boost to the business community if it attracts business to the City; if the City is to support the project, it must find funds to assist without increasing the mill rate. Mr. Just and Mr. Faust commented that they would like to see the State guidelines for the 1990 project. Mr. Knapp commented that he feels that the project is a good idea, and by restoring the house, it will be a great asset to the community. Ms. Christenson stated that currently the City owns the Hubbard House, and the funds that are being requested will be used for maintenance and remodeling of the house. Ms. Christenson stated that the inside of the house needs to be fixed which would cost approximately $270,000. Ms. Christenson stated that currently there is a task force established for the restoration of the Hubbard House. Ms. Sheran stated that by restoring the Hubbard House, it will give the community a feeling of dignity and heritage; however, this proposal will have to be discussed at budget sessions. Ms. Christenson thanked the Council for their time, and she stated that she will contact them when the State guidelines are received. (8.2) Shirley Lieske, 214 S 4th Street, appeared before the Council to request that a bench be placed at the end of Center Street. Ms. Lieske stated that the Campfire organization is requesting that a bench be placed at the end of Center Street to commemorate the books by Maud Hart Lovelace as the bench is a central part of Lovelace's stories. Ms. Lieske stated that currently they have a bench from the Park Department which is 15 to 20 years old and is built of stone. Ms. Lieske stated that there is a guest book at the library for Betsy Tacy visitors, and 75 percent of the visitors would like to know if there really was a bench. Ms. Lieske stated that the Campfire girls are interested in this project because they are a service organization. Ms. Lieske stated that the new owners of the property where it is proposed to put the bench, are willing to give the City the land to put the bench there. Ms. Lieske stated that the Campfire organization is requesting that the City purchase the property, maintain the bench and property, and provide liability insurance. Ms. Lieske stated that the only upkeep that would be necessary is the clearing of grass around the bench. Ms. Lieske concluded by stating that the Campfire girls can't assume the upkeep forever. Mr. Bassett recommended that there be a three-way partnership for the bench. Mr. Bassett suggested that the property owners grant an easement to the Campfire organization, the Campfire organization maintain the bench and area, and the City provide the liability insurance. Ms. Lofy stated that she is a fan of Maud Hart Lovelace, and she likes the idea of having a three-way partnership in which the City would only provide the liability insurance, and the Campfire organization provide the upkeep. Ms. Lofy suggested that Ms. Lieske take this proposal back to the Campfire organization for their decision. City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 138 Mr. Knapp asked Ms. Lieske if she foresees any problems with the proposed agreement. Ms. Lieske stated that it is very hard to speak on a long-term basis as membership and leaders change within the Campfire organization. Ms. Lofy stated that the City currently has more than enough areas to maintain, and perhaps if the Campfire is unable to maintain the area, there would be other organizations that could maintain the area. Ms. Lieske stated that the upkeep would either be performed by herself using her weed eater or by the property owners or neighbors; therefore, she would be willing to make a commitment for a few years. Mr. Faust asked Ms. Lieske if it would be possible for the Campfire organization to put a plaque or sign near the bench explaining the significance of the bench. Ms. Lieske replied that that could be accomplished. Ms. Sheran stated that the maintenance issue of the bench and surrounding area should be resolved between the property owners and the Campfire organization; the City would only be providing the liability insurance. Ms. Sheran moved and Ms. Lofy seconded a motion to provide liability insurance for a bench to be placed at the end of Center Street. With all members voting in favor, the motion carried. HEARINGS (9.1) Mayor Carstensen opened the assessment hearing on Improvement No. 82033, supplemental special assessment for the reconstruction of West Eleventh Street from Carney Avenue to Tile Street. With no one appearing to give testimony, Mayor Carstensen closed the public hearing. Mr. Bassett stated that all assessments for this improvement are a reduction except for those property owners requesting the replacement of water and sewer services. Mr. Just moved and Mr. Knapp seconded a motion to adopt a RESOLUTION ADOPTING FINAL ASSESSMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENT NO. 82033. With all members voting in favor, the Resolution was adopted. (9.2) Mayor Carstensen opened the assessment hearing on Improvement No. 87040, extension of a 10\" sanitary sewer main and a 10\" watermain from existing to the Trunk Highway 22 right of way adjacent to Lot 4, Block 1, J T Dalton Addition (American Linen Supply Co.). Mr. Jim Dalton, 151 Fifteen Place, appeared before the Council on behalf of his mother, Mrs. Joanne Dalton, concerning her deferred assessment of $5,575.00. Mr. Dalton stated that currently Ms. Dalton has water and sewer services as his father built a water line which is connected to the City's system in 1970. Mr. Faust asked Mr. Dalton how many lots are served by that line. Mr. Dalton stated that lots two through five are serviced by that line. Mr. Bassett suggested to the Council to continue the hearing for the Dalton property until the June 27, 1988 meeting so staff may review this. With no one else appearing to give testimony, Mayor Carstensen closed the public hearing. City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 139 Ms. Lofy moved and Ms. Sheran seconded a motion to adopt a RESOLUTION ADOPTING ESTIMATED ASSESSMENT FOR IMPROVEMENT NO. 87040, and to continue the hearing for the Dalton property to June 27, 1988. With all members voting in favor, the motion carried.

BIDS (10.1) Mr. Bassett reported on the consideration of bids for Project No. 88028, construction of a 60 foot by 180 foot metal building for Central Garage. Mr. Bassett stated that the low bid from Farm and City Construction, Inc. was in the amount of $92,998. Mr. Bassett stated that the construction of this building was budgeted in the 1988 budget in an amount of $75,000. Mr. Bassett stated that staff had discussed this increase with Mr. Surprenant of I & S Engineers, and Mr. Surprenant stated that the building construction bids coming in this season are higher than what was anticipated. Mr. Bassett stated that Mr. Mohr, Financial Director, has stated that there is sufficient money available in the Central Garage building depreciation fund to accommodate the increase. Mr. Faust moved and Mr. Knapp seconded a motion to approve the lowest bidder, Farm and City Construction, Inc., in the amount of $92,998 for Project No. 88028, construction of a 60 foot by 180 foot metal building for Central Garage. With all members voting in favor, the motion carried. (10.2) Mr. Bassett reported on the consideration of bids for Project No. 87032, curb and gutter and concrete surfacing on Mohr Drive from Third Avenue to east. Mr. Bassett stated that the two low bids for Project No. 87032 which is extending a permanent street to privately owned lots and one City owned development lot in Lime Valley Second Addition are less than $2,000 apart. Mr. Bassett stated that both contractors are currently working for the City of Mankato; therefore, they have much lower mobilization costs than the third lowest bidder. Mr. Bassett stated that staff is recommending the award of the surfacing contract to Hoffman Concrete, Inc. in the amount of $189,025.15. Mr. Bassett concluded by stating that this project is being funded by a combination of Lime Valley Industrial held tax increment funds and assessments to the City's and the developer's lots. Mr. Knapp referred to Mr. Forsythe's memo to Mr. Bassett, item No. 4, which states that \"the annual TIF proceeds will first be used City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 140 to reduce the developer's assessments and secondly be used to reduce the City's assessments.\" Mr. Knapp asked Mr. Bassett if this is a unique situation. Mr. Bassett stated that it is not a unique situation. Mr. Bassett stated that the developers who will plat the subdivision are encouraged through tax increment funding to construct the road. Mr. Bassett stated that tax increment financing will reduce the developer's assessments as they will have developments with the property, and the City's property isn't likely to develop. Ms. Lofy moved and Ms. Sheran seconded a motion to approve the low bidder, Hoffman Concrete, Inc., in the amount of $189,025.15, for Project No. 87032, curb and gutter and concrete surfacing on Mohr Drive from Third Avenue to east. With all members voting in favor, the motion carried. (10.3) Mr. Bassett reported on the consideration of bids for Intergraph Computer System. Mr. Bassett stated that previously bids were solicited and were rejected due to them not meeting the bid specifications. Mr. Bassett stated that bids were advertised again, and staff is recommending the lowest bidder, Intergraph Corporation, in the amount of $60,930 for the purchase of the Intergraph Computer System. Mr. Faust asked Mr. Bassett if the amount bid fits within the guidelines of the budget. Mr. Bassett stated the amount bid is within the budget guidelines. Mr. Knapp asked Mr. Bassett why there was only one bidder. Mr. Bassett stated that when Blue Earth County designed the system, Intergraph Corporation was the only company that could interface with the system. Mr. Just moved and Mr. Faust seconded a motion to approve the low bidder, Intergraph Corporation, in the amount of $60,930, for the purchase of the Intergraph Computer System. With all members voting in favor, the motion carried. PLANNING COMMISSION (11.1) Mr. Bassett reported on a Resolution of the City of Mankato Granting a Conditional Use Permit for Restaurant Expansion (Mexican Village, 1630 Madison Ave.). Mr. Bassett, through overhead projector, illustrated that the porch in front of the building will be expanded, and handicapped parking will be installed in the first two stalls on the west side of the building. Mr. Faust moved and Mr. Knapp seconded a motion to adopt a RESOLUTION OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF MANKATO GRANTING A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT TO ALLOW A RESTAURANT EXPANSION IN A B-2 ZONING DISTRICT. With all members voting in favor, the Resolution was adopted. (11.2)Mr. Bassett reported on a Resolution of Intent to Extend the Corporate Limits of the City of Mankato to Include Certain Unincorporated Property which is Bordered by Property within the City. (part of E 1/2 of NW 1/4 of Section 30, Mankato Township). Mr. Bassett, through overhead projector, illustrated that this is a five City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 141 acre site located northwest of Kensington Heights and south of Viking Terrace. Mr. Brad Gohla and Ms. Mary Adams, 206 Bermuda Drive, appeared before the Council to voice their opposition to the proposed annexation. Mr. Gohla stated that before he and Ms. Adams purchased the property, they had consulted with City staff to make sure that this area wouldn't be annexed. Mr. Gohla stated that he had been told verbally that it would be several years before this area would be annexed as long as it remained single family. Mr. Gohla stated that their property has a water system and a new septic system. Mr. Gohla stated that he has repaired the outbuildings, and he stated that it would be no big advantage for the City to annex this property. Mr. Gohla concluded by stating that he has cleaned up the property, he intends to keep it as a single family dwelling, and he can not afford to have City water and sewer services. Mr. Knapp asked Mr. Gohla who had told him that this area wouldn't be annexed. Mr. Gohla stated that the planning department and Mr. Jerry Eken, City Engineer, told him that this property wouldn't be annexed unless it was subdivided. Mr. Gohla stated that this information received from City staff was a deciding factor in the purchase of the property. Mr. Bassett stated that it is very unfortunate for one to assume whether or not the City will annex property. Mr. Bassett stated that this area has become eligible to be served by City services, and Mr. Bassett suggested that the Council table this Resolution until June 27, 1988. Ms. Sheran asked if the assessment for water and sewer services could be deferred until hookup. Mr. Bassett stated that perhaps it could be deferred in an annexation agreement. Mr. Bassett stated to Mr. Gohla that staff will meet with him before the meeting on June 27, 1988. Ms. Lofy moved and Mr. Faust seconded a motion to table the Resolution of Intent to Extend the Corporate Limits of the City of Mankato to Include Certain Unincorporated Property which is Bordered by Property within the City until June 27, 1988.

With all members voting in favor, the Resolution was adopted. (12.2) Mr. Bassett reported on setting a date of hearing for June 27, 1988 at request of Helen Hiniker, 106 Knollcrest Drive, for a variance to reduce the side yard setback to two inches for the purpose of building a one stall garage in the rear yard. Ms. Lofy moved and Mr. Faust seconded a motion to set a date of hearing for June 27, 1988 at request of Helen Hiniker, 106 Knollcrest Drive, for a variance to reduce the side yard setback to two inches for the purpose of building a one stall garage in the rear yard. With all members voting in favor, the motion carried. LICENSES (13.1) Mr. Bassett stated that this evening the Council is to review the Intoxicating Liquor License for Some Place Else Bar, 411 S Front St. Mr. David Ramy, 64 Skyline Drive, owner of Some Place Else Bar, appeared before the Council to state that he feels the City Council is putting a 100 percent burden on the bar owners in the City to keep approximately 15,000 minors out of bars. Mr. Ramy stated that on a busy night at his bar, his management will turn away at least 21 underage individuals. Mr. Ramy had the Council refer to the notice of intent to review intoxicating liquor license received by the City Attorney and the police reports regarding the incident occurring on April 6, 1988. Mr. Ramy stated to the Council that it is a joke for young people to try to get served in a bar. Mr. Ramy stated that it isn't the bar owners that are at fault as they aren't inviting underage people to come into the bar and get served. Mr. Ramy had the Council refer to the results of a survey to local bar owners. Mr. Ramy stated that 31 surveys had been sent out, and 17 had responded. Mr. Ramy stated that the City wants to argue with bar owners on how to resolve the issue of underage consumption. Mr. Ramy stated that the City and bar owners should have a joint effort for the enforcement City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 143 of underage consumption. Mr. Ramy stated that he is requesting the Council to table this matter, freeze the suspension on the Kato Entertainment Center, and form a task force with local bar owners. Mr. Ramy stated that the task force would provide a course of action, and it would provide guidelines for the enforcement of underage consumption. Mr. Knapp stated to Mr. Ramy that according to the police report on the last incident, the bouncer had left his post, and then the two underage individuals \"snuck in\" and got served by the bartender. Mr. Ramy stated that this was a \"break down\" in communication between his bouncer and bartender as the bartender had thought that the bouncer had already checked the individuals' identifications. Mr. Ramy stated that it is also a case of employees not backing each other up. Mr. Ramy stated that he was out of town that evening when that incident occurred and he returned to the bar when the arrest was being made. Mr. Ramy concluded by stating that the bouncer is no longer employed at his bar. Mr. Ramy stressed that a task force should be formed. Mr. Just stated that the issue of establishing a task force had been briefly touched upon by Mr. Ramy, and Mr. Just stated he had discussed with a few Council Members the idea of a task force. Mayor Carstensen stated to Mr. Just that that is not the subject before the Council at this particular time. Mayor Carstensen stated that the issue the Council is dealing with is the review of the intoxicating liquor license at the Some Place Else Bar, and anything relative to the task force can be discussed under separate arrangements. Ms. Lofy stated that she agreed with Mayor Carstensen in the sense she would like to separate the two issues. Ms. Lofy stated that since Mr. Ramy brought up the subject of a task force, she didn't know why it wouldn't be appropriate for Mr. Just to ask Mr. Ramy about the task force. Ms. Lofy stated that that she would like to address the question at hand and then discuss the question of a task force. Mr. Just stated that the task force is important as that is what the bar owners would like done first, however, he would go along with the Council's decision. Mr. Bassett stated to Mr. Just that if it's his intent to discuss the task force, he could table the review of the intoxicating liquor license. Mr. Ramy agreed with Mr. Bassett and stated that he is asking the Council to table the review of the intoxicating liquor license and bring up the discussion of the task force. Mr. Ramy stated that before the City Council levies these suspensions, it should be better informed of just the economic impact and what these suspensions can do to a bar. Mr. Ramy stated that for example the dram shop insurance would go \"sky high out of site\" where bar owners couldn't afford it, and they would have to go out of business if a suspension was reported. Mr. Ramy stated that the Council should be well aware and have an open line of communication with everybody, and he stated that the task force should be appointed by the Council. Mr. Bassett stated that it's the law for bar owners not to serve minors. Mr. Bassett stated that if they do serve minors, they violate the law, and the minor also violates the law. Mr. Bassett stated that it's not that the bar owners are innocent victims; they are City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 144 perpetrators of a violation. Mr. Bassett stated that apparently Mr. Ramy understands this point as he has discharged two of his employees. Mr. Bassett stated that bar owners are responsible for their employees' actions. Mr. Bassett stated that the suspension is very expensive, however, when one gets charged with D.W.I. that's also expensive. Mr. Bassett stated that one doesn't stop enforcing D.W.I.'s because it's expensive; it's expensive because it's serious. Mr. Bassett stated that the question Mr. Ramy raises is whether underage consumption is a serious violation. Mr. Bassett stated that since he has worked with the Council it is not new information that serving minors is a serious violation. Mayor Carstensen stated to Mr. Ramy that bar owners have to have the willingness to prosecute and make a citizen arrest for underage consumption. Mr. Ramy stated that he admits that this incident occurred; however, bar owners are not flagrant in allowing underage people in their bars. Mr. Ramy stated that Some Place Else has had no disorderly problems with fights, and there are always two bouncers at his bar checking identifications. Mr. Ramy stated that two underage individuals admitted to the Mankato Police Department that they had \"snuck\" in, and the bartender made an assumption that their identifications had been checked by the bouncer, he served them, and the individuals lied to the police. Ms. Lofy stated to Mr. Ramy that that's not the point Mayor Carstensen is making. Mayor Carstensen stated to Mr. Ramy at that time he should have made a citizens arrest. Mr. Ramy stated that he told Officer Mountain to do that; however, he didn't write it in the police reports, and they gave the individuals a citation. Ms. Lofy stated that the State makes the laws, and the City Council is upholding the laws. Ms. Lofy stated that if there are any changes citizens want to make to the State laws, they should lobby at the State Legislature, and the City Council has nothing to do with fines that are levied by State Statutes. Mr. Faust stated to Mr. Ramy that bar owners know what the laws are, and bar owners are 100 percent responsible for enforcing those laws. Mr. Faust stated that it is a high risk business, and it's the responsibility of the City Council to see that the laws are enforced. Mr. Faust stated that the City doesn't write the laws; they enforce the laws. Mr. Ramy stated that he is not asking the City Council to overlook any State or Federal laws. Mr. Ramy stated that the bar owners are asking the City Council to sit down and talk with the liquor industry of Mankato which includes Jake's Stadium Pizza, Pagliai's Pizza, Seven Eleven, Superamerica, or anybody that sells any alcohol. Mr. Ramy stated that the liquor industry is a big business in town. Mr. Ramy stated that Mankato has a college with very intelligent people that have nothing better to do in their free time but make fake identifications and try to get into bars. Mr. Ramy stated he doesn't believe there is any Mankato bar owner or package store that is flagrant in serving underage people. Mr. Ramy stated that bar owners make a mistake once in awhile but they admit it. Mr. Ramy stated that it's not a flagrant violation even though it is against the law. City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 145 Mr. Knapp asked Mr. Ramy if he doesn't think he has to get smarter than those underage people that try to get into bars. Mr. Ramy stated that it's impossible and tough to get smarter than those people considering what the people do to identifications. Ms. Lofy stated to Mr. Ramy that the Council understands that bar owners are making an effort to enforce the underage consumption. Ms. Lofy stated that in March 1988 when a number of bars, including Some Place Else Bar, were brought up before the Council on liquor violations over the past 12 months, the Council said to everyone that we know you're trying, you may or may not agree with the 21 drinking age but it's State Law, and the Council is going to uphold those laws. Ms. Lofy stated that the Council is not doing this procedure \"out of the clear blue sky\". Ms. Lofy stated that in March 1988 the Council made it very clear to the bar owners who received warnings that if underage consumption happened again in their bars, there would be a very serious repercussion, and it is the prerogative of the Council to state what those repercussions are. Ms. Lofy concluded by stating that the Kato Entertainment Center's suspension was not done in a cavalier manner, and it is very important that Mr. Ramy understands that we're not here on a first time offense. Mr. Ramy stated that this is only the second offense in five years at Some Place Else Bar. Ms. Lofy stated that Some Place Else Bar was issued a warning. Mr. Ramy requested that this issue be tabled, and the City Council and bar owners form a task force to establish a set rule of guidelines based on all liquor violations. Mr. Ramy stated that former City Councils never took this kind of action to bar owners before. Ms. Lofy stated that this is a new City Council, and a warning was levied by the Council in March 1988. Ms. Lofy stated to Mr. Ramy that the Council will first deal with the issue involving the review of his intoxicating liquor license and the underage consumption which took place, and then look at the issue of forming a task force. Mr. Ramy stated that the liquor industry in Mankato should have a set of guidelines, and the City Council shouldn't be arbitrary and make a judgement on every case. Mayor Carstensen stated that the Council realizes this is a very trying situation, however, everyone lives under the same State laws. Mayor Carstensen stated that it's the City Council's responsibility to uphold the laws. Mayor Carstensen stated the Council must deal this evening with the latest citation which is following the earlier warning to Some Place Else Bar. Mr. Just moved to table the review of the intoxicating liquor license for Some Place Else Bar, 411 S Front St., so a discussion may be held concerning the forming of a task force. There being a lack of a second, the motion failed. Ms. Sheran moved and Mr. Faust seconded a motion to suspend the Some Place Else Bar's Intoxicating Liquor License for seven consecutive days beginning July 4, 1988. With Lofy, Sheran, Faust, Knapp, and Carstensen voting yes, and Just voting no, the motion carried. Mr. Ramy thanked the Council for their consideration, and he thanked Mr. Just for being the only Council Member to attend the City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 146 meeting held earlier today. Ms. Lofy stated that she did notify the bar owners that she would not be in attendance for that meeting as she had other commitments. Mayor Carstensen stated that it is not good to attend a meeting such as that which precedes a City Council meeting. Mayor Carstensen stated that he does not want to put himself in a position to be swayed, however, the Council is open to dialogue. Ms. Sheran stated a warning followed by a seven consecutive day suspension are a beginning for forming a set of guidelines. Ms. Lofy stated that stiffer penalties for underage identifications are also issues that should be addressed with the task force. Mayor Carstensen stated that there should be a necessity of documentation for providing birth date for driver's license. Ms. Lofy stated that the City Council also urges citizens arrest and stiff prosecution for underage drinkers. Mayor Carstensen stated that citizens arrests do work as this message is posted in his liquor establishment. Ms. Sheran stated that there are an increasing number of underage drinkers, and she is willing to accept suggestions to work out a schedule which the City Council feels is a reasonable approach to the enforcement of underage consumption. Mr. Knapp stated that one positive point is that the liquor license holders are working together. Mr. Ron Doty, owner of Caledonia Lounge and T.J. Finnegan's, stated that the bar owners need help from the City Council. Mr. Doty stated that the purpose of the meeting this afternoon was to start a dialogue with the Council and bar owners. Mr. Doty stated that people are assaulting bar owners every night by trying to consume alcohol underage. Mr. Doty stated that it's important that every business that sells or serves liquor or non-intoxicating malt liquor such as Superamerica should have a part in the enforcement of underage consumption. Mr. Doty stated that bar owners know the State law, however, the City Council levies the penalty. Mr. Doty stated that it would cost $20,000 per week to close T.J. Finnegan's, but it only costs $95 to the violator. Mr. Doty concluded by stating that there is no good business practice defense. Ms. Lofy stated to Mr. Doty that he shouldn't imply that the City doesn't work with him as Mr. Gabriel, Public Safety Director, meets with him on a regular basis. Ms. Lofy stated that the Council is very clear in what they're trying to accomplish. Mr. Doty stated that dram shop insurance problems are large enough to put a bar owner out of business as dram shop insurance companies can refuse to renew insurance policies with bars if there are suspensions of their license. Mr. Doty stated that ramification of closings is drastic, and it's way out of proportion to the crime that was committed. Mr. Faust stated that he would like to make a couple of points. Mr. Faust stated that he is willing to learn, but he also hopes that people that presenting the facts be very careful in the numbers they are using. Mr. Faust stated that earlier Mr. Ramy stated that there are 15,000 underage kids trying to \"knock down the door\" at the bars to City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 147 get in. Mr. Faust stated that he questions this figure as he knows what the demographics of this community are. Mr. Faust stated that secondly, bar owners talk about the economics of the loss or the seven consecutive day suspensions. Mr. Faust stated that may be true for the bar owners personally, however, the people who are going to consume the product are going to go right down the street the very same night and try the next bar that's open. So actually, a loss to the community doesn't exist as it's still within the community. Mr. Doty stated to Mr. Faust that that may be possible, but he questioned whether it's fair. Mr. Faust repeated that the bar owners should be careful when presenting their facts and figures. Mr. Faust concluded by stating that there is a segment of the Council's constituents that keep reminding the Council that they want the laws enforced, and they want a clean city. Mr. Doty stated that bar owners are not pulling these underage people in and serving them drinks. Mr. Doty stated that on a busy night, T.J. Finnegan's turns away 80 to 90 people, and he will be happy to have a police officer work at their door to check identifications. Mayor Carstensen stated that it wouldn't take very many citizen arrests to get the word out that their establishment is strict on the enforcement of underage consumption. Mr. Doty stated that when the drinking age went from 18 to 19, the City Council at that time worked with the bar owners. Mr. Doty stated that he realizes the State is creating a tougher situation by having 21 as the drinking age, and the State didn't even provide any guidelines to bar owners for the enforcement of the drinking age. Mr. Doty volunteered to work on the task force, and he stated that he feels it's important to get everyone involved including the pizza parlors and grocery stores, and make them aware of how serious a problem it is. Mr. Ray Dembouski, owner of MGM Liquor Warehouse, appeared before the Council to state that he also would like to be a member of the task force as he has similar problems as the on-sale at his off-sale. Mayor Carstensen stated that Ms. Sheran should organize this task force and make a recommendation to the Council. Mayor Carstensen stated that he would like to compliment Ms. Lofy and Mr. Faust for putting an advertisement in Mankato State University's Reporter concerning students planning parties. (13.2) Mr. Bassett reported on the renewal of Consumption and Display (Set Up) Permits for Happy Chef Restaurant, Highway 169 N, Jake's Stadium Pizza, 1614 Monks Avenue, and Mankato Caledonia Curling Club. Mayor Carstensen asked to be removed from voting on the permits due to a conflict of interest. Ms. Lofy moved and Ms. Sheran seconded a motion to remove Mayor Carstensen from voting on the permits due to a conflict of interest. With all members voting in favor, the motion carried. Mr. Just moved and Ms. Lofy seconded a motion to approve the renewal of Consumption and Display (Set Up) Permits for Happy Chef City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 148 Restaurant, Highway 169 N, Jake's Stadium Pizza, 1614 Monks Avenue, and Mankato Caledonia Curling Club. With all members voting in favor, the motion carried. (13.3-13.4) Mr. Bassett reported on the renewal of gambling licenses for VFW Post 950, 121 S Front Street, and Eagles Aerie 269 Auxiliary, 708 N Front Street. Mr. Knapp moved and Ms. Lofy seconded a motion to approve the renewal of gambling licenses for VFW Post 950, 121 S Front Street, and Eagles Aerie 269 Auxiliary, 708 N Front Street. With all members voting in favor, the motion carried. (13.5) Mr. Bassett reported on the gambling license application of St. Clair Fire Department Relief Association for charitable gambling to be held at South Street Saloon, 515 S Front Street. Ms. Lofy stated that the City Council is in a position where they can not discriminate on this request. Mr. Knapp questioned that even if there isn't a residence requirement in the ordinance doesn't necessarily mean the Council has to approve this application. Ms. Lofy stated the Council must have a reasonable basis for denying the application. Ms. Sheran stated that the Council needs to discuss the possibility of a residence requirement for the gambling ordinance. Ms. Sheran stated that according to the memo received from the City Attorney, the City Attorney didn't think a residency requirement was a way to approach how the City was trying to sustain the dollars that are earned through charitable gambling. Mr. Bassett disagreed and stated that the City Attorney felt it's more of a policy issue, and the City Attorney was addressing whether it was legal to have a residence requirement. Mr. Faust stated that he and Mr. Knapp attended a session with Mr. Roger Franke, of the Charitable Gambling Control Board at the League Conference, and Mr. Franke stated that a City may make their gambling ordinance restrictive to any geographical area. Ms. Sheran suggested to table this application. Mr. Bassett stated that the Council must either approve or disapprove the application; if it's tabled, then it's approved. Ms. Lofy stated that many of the St. Clair residents work here in Mankato, and she is unsure if she is prepared this evening to deny the request as she doesn't know if it would be the best policy to have a residency requirement in the gambling ordinance. Mr. Just moved and Ms. Sheran seconded a motion to deny the gambling license application of St. Clair Fire Department Relief Association for charitable gambling to be held at South Street Saloon, 515 S Front Street. With all members voting in favor, the motion carried. (13.6) Mr. Bassett reported on the gambling license application of Elks Lodge, 1028 N Front Street, for charitable gambling to be held at The Albatross, 1608 Warren Street, Charley's, 920 Madison Avenue, Cheer's Bar and Lounge, 1030 Madison Avenue, Caledonia, Madison East Center, and Some Place Else Bar, 411 S Front Street. City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 149 Mr. Faust questioned why the Elks are considering all these other locations in addition to their own as it will be just like a monopoly. Mr. Faust stated that there are other organizations in town that could have charitable gambling in these liquor establishments. Mr. Bassett stated that the Council may deny these requests too, however, the Elks may reapply. Ms. Lofy stated that the State law doesn't state that they can't apply for other bars. Mayor Carstensen stated that the Charitable Gambling Control Board should have two application forms, one form for charitable organizations that have their own facility, and one form for charitable organizations that lease a facility. Mr. Tom Thompson, 125 Atwood Drive, representing the Elks Lodge, appeared before the Council to state that the Elks Club does not feel they're creating a monopoly. Mr. Thompson stated that the lodge is trying to go out and extend their satellite, and the lodge doesn't feel they're taking anything away from other organizations by having these locations as those other organizations can apply also. Mr. Thompson stated that approximately $49,988 has been donated to charitable organizations in Mankato and the Elk's youth camp. Mr. Thompson stated that their applications are in compliance with the ordinance. Mr. Knapp asked Mr. Thompson why more gambling locations are necessary. Mr. Thompson stated to earn more money to be spent on charitable contributions within the City. Ms. Lofy stated that it's her understanding that there is an unlimited number of organizations that can have charitable gambling in a bar; however, she thought there were some restrictions. Mr. Bassett stated that each organization must have a discrete area in a bar for charitable gambling. Ms. Sheran stated that she has become aware of more issues that must be dealt with concerning the gambling ordinance before these applications are approved. Mayor Carstensen stated that staff has looked at issues that may be incorporated in the gambling ordinance. Ms. Sheran moved and Mr. Knapp seconded a motion to deny the gambling license applications of Elks Lodge, 1028 N Front Street, for charitable gambling to be held at The Albatross, 1608 Warren Street, Charley's, 920 Madison Avenue, Cheer's Bar and Lounge, 1030 Madison Avenue, Caledonia, Madison East Center, and Some Place Else Bar, 411 S Front Street. With all members voting in favor, the motion carried. Mr. Al Gruidl, owner of The Albatross, appeared before the Council to state that the reason why they chose the Elks Lodge to conduct charitable gambling in their establishment is because they were able to state where they wanted the charitable dollars to go to, and The Albatross was going to give their charitable dollars to Mankato State University. Mr. Dave Ramy, Some Place Else Bar, appeared before the Council to state that he had talked to a number of organizations that wanted to conduct charitable gambling in his bar, and the reason why he chose the Elks Lodge is because they were the most knowledgeable, and he could specify where he wanted the charitable dollars to go. City Council Meeting - June 13, 1988 Minutes - Page 150 MISCELLANEOUS BUSINESS (14.1) Mr. Bassett reported that a request had been received from the Valley Industrial Development Corporation to schedule a meeting with the City Council to discuss how the Valley Industrial Development Corporation is working. It was unanimously decided to set July 9, 1988, 8:00 a.m., at the Holiday Inn, as the meeting date with the Valley Industrial Development Corporation.
