        "text": "In addition to the many Cartography and GI Science related sessions at AAG this year, CaGIS would like to make sure the membership is aware of two particular events:\n\nOn Tuesday, April 2 from 6 – 8pm, CaGIS will be hosting a reception in the Johnson Room (note: not the Jackson Room as originally stated) at the Marriott Wardman Park. Hors d’ouerves and various adult beverages will be served. Come and mingle with colleagues, learn what CaGIS has been up to lately, and meet the board members of CaGIS.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 3 from 4:30 – 5:30 pm, there will be a USNC meeting held in room Delaware A, at the Marriott Wardman Park. We will be discussing the 2019 International Cartographic Conference and related activities.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you there!\n\nPAPER AND ABSTRACT SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED!\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that in response to the overwhelming demand the deadline for full paper submission was extended to December 12, 2018. The deadline for abstract submission was also extended to January 8, 2019.\n\nInternational Cartographic Association (ICA) encourages submissions from all interested participants from across the globe.\n\nVisit the ICC 2019 website www.icc2019.org for the details.\n\nICC2019 Local Organizing Committee\n\nIf you have any enquiries, please contact: icc2019@issjp.com\n\nThe 29th International Cartographic Conference (ICC) will take place in Tokyo, Japan, from July 15-20, 2019. Interested participants should take note of the December 12 deadline for full manuscripts and the January 8 deadline for abstracts and publication in the proceedings. For more information, visit the USNC-ICA page.\n\nCaGIS is proud to announce two competitions of likely interest to its members. The Map Design Competition is open to all map-makers in the US and Canada for maps created in the past year. Students are particularly encouraged to apply, and the deadline for submission is January 31, 2019. The CaGIS Student Scholarship competition is also open. CaGIS is sponsoring both masters and doctoral scholarships. The deadline for scholarship application is January 19, 2019.\n\nCaGIS is pleased to announce the winners of the 2017 Map Competition. Thanks to all who submitted an entry!\n\nCaGIS is pleased to announce that its 2018 Symposium will be co-hosted with the University Consortium for Geographic information Science (UCGIS)! This joint AutoCarto and Symposium will explore Frontiers of Geospatial Data Science. We will consider connections between Geospatial Science and the burgeoning field of Data Science, seen in newly named academic departments and calls for funded research. At this event we will explore emerging opportunities and challenges for the geospatial and mapping sciences with an eye on trends in deep learning, data-intensive computing platforms, and visualization, as well as geospatial big data sources and applications such as location-aware social media, autonomous vehicles, and earth-observing micro- and nano-satellites and sensors.\n\nThis conference will be heldTuesday May 22 – Thursday May 24, 2018, at the historic Concourse Hotel in downtown Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nStudents, share your research and activities! Earn recognition and compete for an award!\n\nThe Cartography and Geographic Information Society (CaGIS) and the University Consortium for Geographic Information Science (UCGIS) are pleased to announce a joint AutoCarto Conference and Symposium that will explore the Frontiers of Geospatial Data Science. CaGIS and UCGIS invite cartographers, geographers, GIScientists, data scientists and others conducting research on the cutting edge of the geospatial sciences. Of particular interest are research topics that highlight synergies between geospatial and data sciences for advancing theories and applications.\n\nSteps for Participation:\n\nSubmit a brief abstract about your poster topic via to Scott Freundschuh at sfreunds@unm.edu\n\nAbstracts are due by March 15, 2018\n\nAll submissions will be reviewed by the program committee and you will hear by April 1, 2018 if your poster has been accepted\n\nRegister for AutoCarto/Symposium online using the heavily discounted student registration fee\n\nShare your poster in Madison! May 22-24, 2018\n\nAll posters presented by students are eligible to compete for one of several $500 awards, recognition at the event, and highlighted on the UCGIS and CaGIS websites!\n\nFor the latest in CaGIS news, check us out on our Facebook page or on Twitter (@CartographyGIS)!\n\nCaGIS is pleased to recognize the two winners of the ICA-IMIA map awards. The ICA/IMIA Award for Excellence in Cartography Award promotes and recognizes excellence in map design and advancement in cartography. The criteria for this award includes creativity, appropriate text, design balance, unity, clarity, effective use of color, cohesiveness of title and technical aspects of the subject matter. Two awards are given annually with no distinction between first and second place.\n\nThe first ICA/IMIA award went to the U.S. Geological Survey for Geologic Map of Great Sand Dunes National Park, Colorado (Cartographers: Paco VanSistine, Richard Madole, and Joseph Romig).\n\nThe second ICA/IMIA award went to Tokyo Map Research Incorporated for Relationship between geographical names and landforms with names of birds in Japan (Cartographer: Masataka Satoh). Congratulatons to both winners!\n\nCongratulations to the three US applicants that were selected to receive ICA scholarships to attend ICC 2017. Jorge Chen from University of California – Santa Barbara (UCSB), Song Gao also from UCSB, and Amber Bosse from the University of Kentucky will each receive a 100 Euro award by the ICA to support their attendance at ICC 2017. Jorge will be presenting a paper titled “Rapid integration of indoor and outdoor coordinate reference systems using 3D point cloud data”. Song will be presenting “Identifying Geographic Features through Map Interpretation: A Case Study of Craters Using Controlling Variables”, and Amber will be presenting “For the Essentially Subjective Elements of Cartography, 1953-1995”. Be sure to see these if you attend the ICC!"
