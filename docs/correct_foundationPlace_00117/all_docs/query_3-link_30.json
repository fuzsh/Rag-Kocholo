        "text": "Dear Experts,\n\nI am not sure if I can post this question here.\n\nWe are developing an in-house utility to compare Intergraph SmartPlant P&ID 2D drawing with 3D Model. To achieve this, we would like to use AutoCAD viewer to display P&ID drawing with a reference on each drawing object to SmartPlant P&ID so that the utility will identify the selected drawing object such as PipeLine, Valve or Instrument on 2D viewer.\n\nIntergraph SmartPlant P&ID is converting .PID file to .dwg as dumb graphics with no reference to SmartPlant P&ID. So we cannot use this drawing since the utility cannot identify the selected drawing object on AutoCAD viewer.\n\nDoes anyone implemented a Plugin or is there any support from AutoCAD to convert/open Intergraph SmartPlant P&ID with a reference (not just dumb graphics). Or Is there any plugin or utility available to convert ISO 15926 XML drawing (http://www.dexpi.org/) to DWG file with a reference to identify selected drawing object.\n\nYour assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n\nregards,\n\nSravan"
