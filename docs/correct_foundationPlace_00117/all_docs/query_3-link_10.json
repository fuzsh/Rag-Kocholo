        "text": "Of the âbig fiveâ CAD vendors in 1980, Applicon, Auto-trol Technology, Calma, Computervision and M&S Computing, only the last of these, now known as Intergraph, is still a viable thriving business although it has also had its share of highs and lows.\n\nThe history of Intergraph from the mid-1980s on cannot be completely separated from the history of Bentley Systems, the company that developed and currently markets MicroStation. This chapter will describe the MicroStation story from Intergraphâs point of view, leaving it to a separate chapter on Bentley (Chapter 10) to describe in depth the breakup of this corporate partnership and how Bentley eventually went its own way.\n\nEstablishment of M&S Computing\n\nIntergraph was started as M&S Computing in February 1969 by a group of engineers who were working for IBMâs Federal Systems Division in Huntsville, Alabama developing guidance software for the Saturn rocket. The group consisted of Jim Meadlock, his wife Nancy, Terry Schansman (the S of M&S), Keith Schonrock, and Robert Thurber. James Taylor joined three months later as employee #6. This was an extremely loyal group of founders with all of them except for\n\nSchansman sticking with the firm through the 1980s and much of the 1990s. In fact\n\nTaylor was the companyâs president and CEO when he retired for the second time in July 2003. Schansman left the company when it went from being a software contractor to marketing turnkey graphics systems. He wanted to stay in the software business.\n\nUnfortunately, he died from a heart attack a few years later.\n\nM&S Computing was founded on the assumption that government agencies would begin to use digital computers for real-time missile guidance rather than the analog computers used up until then and that as a private company there would be business opportunities exploiting this change in technology. Some of the companyâs early work was with NASA and the US Army in developing systems that applied digital computing to real-time missile guidance issues. Like most start-ups, the company took on whatever work that would help pay the bills. Many of these assignments ended up using computer graphics to display data such as simulated missile trajectories.\n\nAn important early project was the development of an interactive graphics system for the design and layout of printed circuit boards. This NASA effort fundamentally launched the company into the computer graphics business. Later, the software was expanded to cover the design of integrated circuits. According to Meadlock, being able to perform computer graphics independent of a programmer was a novel concept at the time.[1] The initial minicomputer version of this software was implemented on Xerox (formerly Scientific Data Systems) Sigma 5 and Sigma 2 computers.[2]\n\nM&S Computingâs name was changed to Intergraph (Interactive graphics) in 1980 prior to the company initial public offering in 1981. For simplicity, the company will simply be referred to as Intergraph throughout the remainder of this chapter.\n\nJim Meadlock dominates company\n\nNo story about Intergraph can be complete without a detailed discussion about Jim Meadlock and his influence on the company for nearly 30 years. Meadlock received a degree in electrical engineering from North Carolina State University in 1956 and worked on the Apollo space program at IBM for 12 years before founding Intergraph. The work mostly involved the development of software used to guide, control and check out the Saturn Launch Vehicle. Meadlockâs electrical engineering background was particularly influential on many business and product decision he would make while CEO of the company.\n\nTo describe Meadlock as a controlling individual would be an understatement. Other than an interest in being a gentleman vintner, his entire life as well as that of his wife Nancy revolved around the company even to the point of building a home virtually on the companyâs industrial campus just west of Huntsville. Between them, the Meadlocks controlled expenses as if each dollar came out of their own pockets. One programmer once told me that that he needed Nancyâs personal approval to obtain a programming manual for a computer system he was working on. There were contradictions however. Meadlock frowned on employees flying first class even if they were doing so on a free upgrade. On the other hand, Intergraph was the only CAD company that had its own corporate jet.\n\nLike many other engineering entrepreneurs Meadlock did not have much use for traditional sales and marketing. His attitude was if you built a good product the customers would come. In the late 1970s, the company had just a handful of sales people and promotional literature consisted mainly of black and white product data sheets. The primary sales technique was to bring the prospect to Huntsville where Meadlock would lay on his considerable charm.\n\nAs described below, Meadlock was brilliant product strategist. Each major product decision the company made seemed to lead to the next significant development. Throughout the latter part of the 1970s and the 1980s there was very little wasted motion within the companyâs product development activity. In particular, Meadlock had an excellent feel for the relationship between software and hardware, particularly at a time when the CAD industry was dominated by hardware-oriented turnkey systems. But he was stubborn and this stubbornness led to both difficulties and successes at Intergraph. The company probably stuck with manufacturing its own workstations and PCs far too long but when it switched platforms, it never looked back.\n\nProbably the ultimate example of Meadlockâs stubbornness, however, involved Intergraphâs protracted legal dispute with Intel over microprocessor patents. At a time when most industry observers felt that Meadlock was tilting at windmills, he was determined to see the issue through, mainly because he absolutely believed his company was right. As described later in this chapter, he was proven to be correct, to the tune of many hundred million dollars.\n\nMeadlock received numerous awards during his career including being one of 15 individuals to receive a 1985 Congressional High Technology Award. He was also given an Ed Forrest award for contributions to the CAD industry at the 1994 A/E/C SYSTEMS Conference in Washington, D.C.\n\nIntergraph enters the commercial graphics market\n\nIn the early 1970s, Intergraph was still basically a consulting company. The market for turnkey graphics systems was taking off very slowly, mostly for the design of printed circuit boards and integrated circuits. There was one consistency in this technology and that was the concept of data layers. Designs consisted of two-dimensional representations of data elements and these layers were stacked one on top of another.\n\nMeanwhile, nearby in Nashville, Tennessee a young Ph.D. mathematician, Dr. Joel Orr, had been hired by the city to direct the development and deployment of LAMP, metropolitan Nashvilleâs Location And Mapping Program. The need for a municipal mapping system had its origin in a request from the Tennessee governor in 1972 for municipal support of a traffic accident reporting and analysis system. As the system manager responsible for establishing a geocoding methodology for the Nashville Metro Area (it was a combined city and county government), Orr looked at alternatives to handle widely varying requirements. While engineering needed precise data, the planning department could work with more generalized data.\n\nA $300,000 budget was established in 1973 to procure a system for digitizing and managing geospatial data. Orr set out to see what other cities such as Houston, Atlanta and Eugene, Oregon were doing to establish digital map databases. Based on his findings a Request For Proposal was prepared and distributed to potential bidders. Nashville received 40 responses including proposals from Synercom and Calma which were both more established in this market than was Intergraph.\n\nAlthough Intergraph did not have a mapping system per se, it proposed to convert the software the company had developed for integrated circuit design to manage geospatial data. (Nobody referred to it as âgeospatialâ at the time.) Intergraph agreed with Orr that digitized maps could be viewed on a CRT screen, edited interactively and a wide range of reports could be generated for municipal organizations such as school districts and fire and police departments.\n\nAccording to Orr, one of the major reasons Intergraph won the contract for this system was that it was willing to interface the interactive mapping system to Nashvilleâs IBM 370/145 mainframe computer. That computer had a huge amount of disk storage for the time, ten removable disk drives, each with the capacity of 300MB. Orr realized that the mapping system would generate a tremendous volume of data, far more than could be stored on the minicomputers then available.\n\nThe system proposed by Intergraph consisted of a Digital PDP-11 computer with a 24K 16-bit word memory and a 5MB disk drive, four Tektronix 4014 terminals, Summagraphics digitizers and an early version of what eventually became the companyâs primary graphics software package, IGDS (Interactive Graphics Design System). This particular version of the software was called IGDS3. The memory was soon increased to 48K words. One problem discovered soon after the system was installed was that it could only process straight lines and circular arcs. Since Nashville ran along side a river, irregular curves were needed. When this was pointed out to him, Keith Schonrock returned to Huntsville and added the ability to handle spline curves to IGDS in short order.[3]\n\nNashville started digitizing the municipal maps in-house but soon realized that it had undertaken a bigger task than it could handle. After an aborted contract with an engineering firm in Atlanta, Intergraph accepted a contract to digitize the municipalityâs maps for the huge sum of $32,000. According to Meadlock, it ended up costing the company $200,000 to complete the work. In the process of fulfilling this obligation, the company developed important software for aligning and scaling individual map sheets.\n\nFrom this one project evolved a major portion of Intergraphâs subsequent business. Over the next 30 years the company probably installed several billion dollars worth of mapping systems throughout the world. It also led to a lucrative market in developing specialized mapping systems for government agencies â much of which remains classified to this day. About the same time Intergraph delivered an IGDS3 system to Fluor Corporation in Los Angeles.\n\nOrr, of course, went on to become a leading consultant, writer and speaker in the computer graphics industry as well as a personal business associate and someone I consider a close friend.\n\nMoving from consulting contracts to commercial systems\n\nBy 1975, Intergraph had honed IGDS to the point where it was a fairly respectable mapping and general drafting solution. While the companyâs graphics systems were still based on Tektronix storage tube graphics, it took a rather novel approach to using this technology. As mentioned elsewhere, a major drawback of storage tubes was that when a change was made to the display, such as moving or deleting an graphical element, the entire image had to be regenerated. This was particularly time consuming if the user was viewing a small section of a drawing and wanted to view the entire drawing so as to zoom in on some other area.\n\nIntergraph solved this problem by using two storage tube displays as components of a user station or terminal. One CRT typically displayed an overall view of the drawing or map being worked on while the second CRT displayed a smaller working area. At other times, one unit was used for alphanumeric data while the other displayed graphic information. The typical terminal had these two CRTs mounted above a large digitizer table that was the operatorâs primary communication device. Each workstation contained a DEC LSI-11/2 computer to control local operations.\n\nIntergraph in the late 1970s\n\nFrom less than $2 million in 1973, Intergraphâs revenue grew to over $20 million in 1978. Although the company still did some contract programming work, especially for federal government agencies, the bulk of Intergraphâs business involved interactive graphics systems, most of which incorporated the IDGS software. While the company had grown to about 200 employees by 1978, the key executives were still the original founders.\n\nMost customers utilized their Intergraph systems for either mapping or engineering drafting applications. Major users included Commonwealth Edison, Detroit Edison, Sargent & Lundy, Bechtel, U.S. Steel, Fluor, Michigan Highway Department and Texas Highway Department. The IGDS system delivered to Texas included some of Intergraphâs first photogrammetric software. Over time, this would become one of the companyâs technical strengths.\n\nThe company was well respected for the human factors aspects of its system design. The software was strong in mapping, drafting and database management. Although they had some manufacturing companies as customers, mechanical design and drafting was not a targeted market at this time.\n\nManaging explosive growth\n\nIn the six years from 1978 to 1984 Intergraphâs revenue grew by a factor of 20 to over $400 million. By 1980, the Intergraph system architecture that would dominate the engineering design and mapping markets throughout the decade and well beyond in some cases was rapidly taking shape. As mentioned earlier, there was little wasted motion in Intergraphâs product development activity. Each step along the way led logically to the next. A good example was the management of attribute data for engineering drawings and maps.\n\nOnce it had established itself as the leading vendor of mapping system, Intergraph took dead aim at the AEC market and systematically began to push aside Auto-trol Technology which had been the early leader in this market, particularly for process plant engineering. Creating a instrumentation drawing for a process plant by itself is not a complex undertaking. Symbols are retrieved from a library of symbols, text is added at predefined locations on or adjacent to the symbol and inter-connecting lines are forced to snap points on the symbols. The problem is that the user ends up with a pretty picture of lines, arcs and alphanumeric text. There is no meaningful context to this data â no way to find all the 8-inch gate valves on lines carrying a specific product. This is what system implementers call âattributeâ data.\n\nThere are fundamentally three ways to manage the combination of graphic and attribute data â each with its own benefits and detriments. The attribute data can be added to the graphic information in a single integrated system. This is a straightforward approach and one followed by a number of companies. On the downside, drawing files become very large and it is often difficult to keep the attribute data synchronized with the graphical elements. A second approach is to store everything in a database and extract drawing images from the database. While this eventually became an accepted technique, in the 1980 time frame computers were simply too slow to do this effectively and database software technology was still fairly immature.\n\nThe third approach was to create two parallel universes, one for graphics and one for related attribute information. This is fundamentally what Intergraph did and it worked very well for over a decade. The graphic system was the previously mentioned IGDS software which by 1980 was in its eighth incarnation. The data management function was handled by a new program, DMRS (Database Management and Retrieval System). It was a hierarchical database management system which was the preferred technology at the time. It would be a few more years before relational database technology was considered ready for prime time.\n\nTo speed up the process of finding specific information in the DMRS database, Intergraph developed a hardware device called the âFile Processorâ (often referred to simply as a disk scanner) that retrieved records based upon search parameters generated by application programs. The File Processor could retrieve data records based upon requests that included logical operations such as AND, OR, LESS THAN, etc.\n\nFundamentally, it was a hardware solution to a software problem.\n\nEventually, software developments and faster computer hardware would negate the need for the File Processor, but for a number of years it provided Intergraph with a performance advantage over the companyâs competitors. A further indication of how the company looked ahead in its product development activity was that by the late 1970s it was obvious to Meadlock and his crew that a transition was underway from 16-bit computer architecture to 32-bit systems. Well before Intergraph was ready to replace the 16-bit PDP-11 computers it was then using with Digitalâs new, but more expensive, 32bit VAX computers, Intergraph began converting its software to work with 32-bit data files. As a consequence, when the company did make the switch to the VAX it was able to do so with much less effort than most of its competitors experienced.\n\nBy 1980 approximately 60 percent of the companyâs systems business was in process plant design and heavy engineering with most of the balance mapping related. Bob Thurber headed the plant design business activity in Huntsville where all the hardware work was also done. Jim Howell handled basic mapping and land use applications, also in Huntsville, while public utility and municipal mapping was managed in Denver by Jim Hargis and Keith McDaniel. The operations side of the business was headed by Keith Schonrock with Ed Eva as the national sales manager reporting to him. Between 1978 and 1980 the companyâs revenue took off like a rocket growing from $20 million to over $56 million. By mid-1981, the company had installed 270 systems.\n\nIntergraph becomes a major player in CAD industry\n\nIn 1981, Intergraphâs product development activity seemed to switch into a higher gear. Although it was not the first CAD vendor to jump on the raster graphics bandwagon, when it do so, Intergraph did it well. The first product was a 1280 by 1024 resolution monochromatic raster display that was packaged in the companyâs dual-screen terminal much like the storage tube units had been earlier. It is interesting that although the dual-screen configuration had originally been implemented to overcome shortcomings of the storage tube, Intergraph continued to use this setup for many years after the company switched to raster displays. The IGDS software supported the display of eight independent views of a drawing on the two screens. The monochromatic display was followed soon afterwards by a color unit with similar resolution.\n\nEqually significant was the companyâs addition of Digitalâs 32-bit VAX 11/780 computers to its product line in 1981. Although the VAX had been introduced in 1978, it took Intergraph some time to recompile the software to run in native mode on the VAX. PDP-11 software could run on the VAX in emulation mode but that performance left something to be desired. Moving PDP-11 software to the VAX in native mode required some coding changes and recompilation as well as a lot of testing. The switch was somewhat complicated by the fact that the original IGDS software was written about 50 percent in FORTRAN and 50 percent in PDP-11 assembly language. Likewise, highspeed interfaces for terminals had to be redesigned for maximum effectiveness. The first Intergraph VAX systems was installed at Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville, Oklahoma in the fall of 1981. This was part of a large order for eight VAXbased systems. An important aspect of Intergraphâs introduction of VAX-based systems was that the company used a standard version of the Digital VMS operating system. This meant that third party software packages could run without modification. Of course, if the developers of these packages wanted to use Intergraphâs dual-screen graphics terminals, that required some customization work. This led to cooperative relationships with third party software vendors who offered software that Intergraph did not such as structural analysis.[4]\n\nThe switch to VAX-based systems was done over some period of time. In fact, Intergraph continued to introduce new PDP-11 systems even after it began shipping VAX systems. This was especially true for lower-cost systems since the prices for VAX 11/780 computers alone started in the $200,000 range. As mentioned earlier, Intergraph had already switched to a 32-bit data format for IGDS and DMRS. As a result, the companyâs PDP-11 and VAX systems could easily share data, making the transition from 16-bit to 32-bit systems much less painful than it was for users of competitive systems.\n\nOne such low-end system was what the company called The Starter System. It consisted of a DEC PDP-11/23 minicomputer with Digitalâs RSX-11M operating system, an 84MB disk, a terminal with dual 19-inch monochromatic raster displays, a 36-inch by 48-inch digitizer and Intergraphâs IGDS software along with several architectural space planning and drafting packages. All this for just $85,000.[5] A Hewlett-Packard 7580 pen plotter added $20,000 while substituting color displays for the monochromatic units added an additional $22,000. A mechanical design and drafting version of The Starter System was shown at AUTOFACT III in Detroit in November 1981. The company introduced color shading software around this same time that took several minutes to produce an image.\n\nIntergraph was one of the first CAD vendors to appreciate the need to support distributed operations. The communications system it began selling in the early 1980s consisted of data concentrators that connected to the Digital UNIBUS and transferred data at rates up to 2 Mbps at distances up to 6,000 feet. The company actually called the product âInternetâ well before the term came into common use.\n\nIn late 1981, 48 percent of the companyâs business was in mapping and land management systems and 42 percent was in AEC systems. The balance was primarily custom programming work for Federal government agencies. Intergraph was planning on entering the electronic circuit board design market with manual placement and routing software. In particular, the company planned to target prospects that used Multiwire technology for their circuit boards.\n\nMultiwire was a technique where a machine laid overlapping insulated wires on a circuit board instead of etching traces as was done with traditional printed circuit boards. Corrections could be made to Multiwire boards with a soldering gun and jumper wires more easily than PCBs could be modified. Intergraph itself was a major user of this technology having installed $5 million of specialized equipment in 1980 and 1981 for producing Multiwire boards. While Intergraph purchased computer equipment from Digital, it produced custom circuit boards for its dual-screen workstations, the disk scanner and a vector to raster converter for driving electrostatic plotters.[6] In fact, Intergraph was beginning to become a fairly significant electronics manufacturing company at this point.\n\nIntergraph also began the serious development of mechanical design software in the 1981 time frame. At AUTOFACT 4 held in November 1982 in Philadelphia, Intergraph demonstrated new mechanical design and manufacturing software including 5axis machining. A new 64-bit graphics processor enabled the software to do hidden line removal operations, perform image rotation and produce shaded images very quickly.\n\nThis unit also supported raster to vector conversion for scanning applications.\n\nAt the same conference Intergraph introduce a low-cost VAX 11-730 system that sold for $145,000 with one workstation and mechanical design and drafting software. The company also previewed a new InterAct workstation powered by a Motorola 68000 microprocessor.[7]\n\nThere were two versions of this new InterAct workstation. The DSP041 used two monochromatic raster displays while the DSP042 had one monochromatic display and one 256-color display. The 68000-based display processor with its 68KB memory handled functions such as pan, zoom and rotate locally once the graphic image was transferred from the VAX memory. View transformations of fairly complex images typically took less than two seconds. The company was also working on an array processor than would be able to produce images of complex three-dimensional models with hidden lines removed ten to twenty times faster than could be done in software on a VAX 11/780.\n\nBechtel validates system productivity\n\nThe company went public in April 1981. Intergraphâs revenues grew to $91 million in 1981 and $156 million the following year. With VAX systems selling for over $100,000 per seat, the companyâs growth was being powered by sales to large engineering organizations.\n\nTypical was Bechtelâs Los Angeles Power Division (LAPD). By May 1983, this organization had 14 Intergraph systems at five different sites with a total of 84 workstations committed to power plant design applications. By 1983 Intergraph had replaced Auto-trol Technology as Bechtelâs primary CAD vendor.\n\nBechtel was seeing significant productivity improvements using these systems. Pipe hanger design went from four hours to 15 minutes while, at least in one case, a 30hour structural frame design was done in 30 minutes. Much of this performance was accomplished through the use of specialized IGDS add-ons developed by Bechtel. One example was BISEPS (Bechtel Interactive System for Engineering of Pipe Supports).[8]\n\nEstablishing strong position in the mapping market\n\nMany entrepreneurial organizations fail because the founders attempt to keep these companies within their original comfort zone rather than adapt to the needs of the marketplace. Intergraphâs founders had backgrounds predominately in space related technology such as NASAâs Apollo program. That did stop them, however, from taking Intergraph into new markets they saw as emerging opportunities. The market that probably did more to define Intergraph than any other was what can generally be described as mapping. or geographic information systems (GIS).\n\nGIS does not refer to a single application. Rather it is a broad spectrum of applications that have one thing in common â managing large volumes of spatially related data. One aspect of this market that Intergraph came to dominate was the production of topographic maps, predominately for military and non-military government agencies. Another market segment was the data collection and preparation of maps for utilities containing detailed information relating to physical assets. The latter area soon became known as Automated Mapping/Facility Management (AM/FM). These maps were far different from those used for planning purposes where the information being recorded and displayed referred more to types of land use such as zoning data or population densities. This latter area is referred to as thematic mapping and is a market segment that never was a particularly high priority at Intergraph.\n\nOne of Intergraphâs first significant mapping customers was Southern Bell.[9] Working with AT&T and Bell Labs, Intergraph implemented a continuous facilities model using the companyâs DMRS and IGDS products. This software was used to model Southern Bellâs outside plant â that portion of the telephone network not inside its switching centers. It was basically a database management solution driven by graphics although inquiries could be made from alphanumeric terminals. Changes to the telephone network entered via these alphanumeric terminals were immediately reflected in the graphic views of the data.\n\nAnother pressing need for mapping software in the early 1980s was in the oil and gas industry for managing exploration and production data. Just a few years earlier, the United States had experienced a severe oil shortage that resulted in long lines at the local gas station. Intergraph recognized the need for new technology to help in this area and plunged in to provide solutions to the industry. It turned out that many of the application modules developed to support energy companies were also useful for other mapping customers. These packages included software to:\n\nDigitize paper maps and photographic images to produce a spatial database.\n\nCovert data from one coordinate system to another.\n\nAdjust digitized data to compensate for paper shrinkage and to match one map sheet to another.\n\nProduce digital contour maps from grids of data points (this was commonly called digital terrain modeling).\n\nSelect data based upon proximity to linear or area features.\n\nDigitize and process specialized data such as oil well logs and seismic results.\n\nProduct development activities at Intergraph during the preceding ten years had positioned Intergraph very well to pursue this market. The separation of graphics and data management functions into two separate programs, IGDS and DMRS, proved to be an effective way to manage the mass of data these applications involved while the companyâs proprietary disk scanner resulted in fast interactive response times. The use of industry standard Digital VAX computers made it relatively easy for oil and gas companies to integrate their Intergraph systems with other data processing resources. Finally, the dual-screen terminals, especially the color raster versions, facilitated the viewing of these large data files.[10]\n\nAlthough Calma, Computervision, Auto-trol Technology and even Applicon offered mapping applications, none of these competitors focused on the market to the extent that Intergraph did. Probably the companyâs most serious competition was a Houston based company, Synercom. The latter company had good technology but never was able to achieve the market recognition that Intergraph did. In the planning area, the major competition would eventually turn out to be Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI), but in the early 1980s, it had yet to achieve critical mass.\n\nExploration and production mapping systems also provided Intergraph with an opportunity to expand its international presence, especially in the Middle East. This would eventually turn out to be a major source of revenue for the company. As we will see later, by 2004, Spatial Information Management as Intergraph now calls it, generated directly or indirectly 75 percent of the companyâs revenue.\n\nNew generation plant design software\n\nAs part of the companyâs plan to develop a new process plant design system, Intergraph teamed up with a Houston company, Zydex Engineering, Inc. in late 1981, to develop a new plant design system. Zydex was run by Eduardo (Ed) Zorrilla. This joint development project led to what eventually became known as Intergraphâs Plant Design System (PDS). The software was intended to provide an comprehensive interactive threedimensional capability for complex process plants including design, drafting, material take-off, and visualization. Zydex developed the specifications for PDS while Intergraph personnel did the actual software implementation.\n\nThe first public demonstration of PDS was at the Petro Expo â85 show in Houston in March 1985. The first modules mostly involved two-dimensional drafting applications such as P&IDs and Instrumentation Loop Diagrams. I saw a demonstration of the software in April 1985 at NCGA-85 in Dallas. My observations at the time were:\n\nThe new software involved more keyboard activity than Intergraphâs earlier plant design software.\n\nPerformance using a VAX 11/750 and an InterAct dual screen workstation was not particularly impressive except for generating shaded images of the plant model. The latter task was facilitated by the use of Intergraphâs Graphics Processor described earlier.\n\nFittings were inserted by first routing the pipe and then inserted specification defined fittings in a batch operation. During the demo, it took three minutes to insert eight fittings. Inserting fittings on a vessel took just a few seconds, however.\n\nThe system did not appear easy to use. During the demonstration I watched, the application engineer lost his orientation in the model and had to stop, log off, reload the model and then continue. His last few operations were lost when he logged off.[11]\n\nBy mid-1986 Intergraph had invested over $8 million in developing the complete application suite.[12] PDS represented a new approach to engineering design, one in which the management of design data was treated as important as if not more so than the graphical design of the physical plant. Descriptive information was stored in a manner that facilitated multiple applications sharing the same data.\n\nThe underlying concept was that once a data element was defined, perhaps in a P&ID (Process and Instrumentation Diagram), that information could be used to produce other drawings such as instrument loop diagrams or to verify that process elements were not left out of the actual piping design. This held whether the application involved twodimensional schematic data or three-dimensional models of the plant. Prior systems tended to treat each applicationâs data separately and transferring information from one task to another was a âhit or missâ affair.\n\nAs implemented, PDS actually stored information in three interrelated databases.\n\nReference Database â contained information relative to industry design codes, vendorsâ catalog data, job specifications, symbol libraries, etc.\n\nTask Database â used to store working data associated with active design tasks prior to that aspect of the design being âapproved.â\n\nMaster Database â repository for approved project data. Once a portion of the plant design was stored in the Mater Database, special procedures were required before that data could be changed.\n\nSpecific programs implemented in PDS handled the following tasks:\n\nProcess and Instrumentation Diagrams (Included a library of 1,000 symbols)\n\nInstrument Diagrams\n\nInstrument Loop Drawings\n\nEquipment Design\n\nPlant Layout\n\nStructural Modeling (analysis handled by Intergraph-Rand Micas or third party programs)\n\nPiping (Included a library of 75,000 components)\n\nElectrical Raceway Design\n\nHVAC\n\nThe basic user interface to PDS was done with IGDS which by mid-1986 encompassed over 800 man-years of development effort. The software was implemented on the Digital VAX computer using the VMS operating system. Orthographic piping drawings were produced by selecting portions of the plant model, eliminating hidden lines and then using IGDS to put the finishing touches on the drawings.[13]\n\nWhile one group of Intergraph programmers was preparing PDS for formal release as a VAX-based system in mid-1986, other Intergraph software groups were hard at work preparing a new generation of applications for the companyâs UNIX workstations then under development. PDS would remain a VAX-based application longer than any other comparable program sold by Intergraph and it would not be until the early 1990s before it would be ported to UNIX.\n\nIn August 1995, Intergraph filed a legal action seeking to dissolve its business arrangement with Zydex. Intergraph wanted to be able to continue selling PDS without having to pay Zydex on-going royalties which supposedly were in the range of 30 percent of the softwareâs sales price. Zydex filed a counterclaim several months later alleging wrongful dissolution of the business relationship, seeking both sole ownership of PDS and significant compensatory and punitive damages. Needless to say, this would have effectively put Intergraph out of the plant design business if the court had sided with Zydex.\n\nAfter nearly two years of litigation, the companies agreed to settle the dispute in 1997, but failed to agree on certain terms of the settlement. In September 1997, the court issued an order resolving the disputed issues and dismissed the case. The settlement involved Intergraph acquiring Zydex for $24.8 million. The closing under these terms never took place and finally in November a hearing was held during which the judge ordered both parties to sign the closing documents.\n\nThe documents were finally executed by both parties, but Zydex still wanted to take one more shot at Intergraph and indicated they might appeal the judgeâs order.[14] In order to put this dispute behind it, Intergraph agreed to increase the payment to $26.3 million and the deal was finally consummated in January 1998. PDS software sales in 1997 amounted to about $45 million.[15]\n\nIntergraph in the mid-1980s\n\nThe 1980s were the go-go years for Intergraph. The company was starting to pursue nearly every aspect of automated design and drafting. This even included architectural applications, an market segment the company would pull out of in the late 1990s with Meadlock complaining that it was impossible to make a profit selling to architectural firms. Typical applications included Structural Steel Detailing and Reinforced Concrete Detailing which sold for $10,000 each. Remember, Intergraphâs software prices were on a per system basis and at this point in time, the company was claiming that a VAX 11/785 could support up to 20 terminals.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Intergraph started getting carried away with executive titles. Jim Meadlock was, of course, president and CEO. Below him were eight executive vice presidents: Keith Schonrock, Jim Taylor, Nancy Meadlock, John Thorington, Roland Brown, Allan Wilson and Willam Zarecor.[16] Nancy Meadlock was taking on increased responsibilities at Intergraph as executive vice president of administration and was clearly a power behind the throne. About the same time, Rick Lussier became vice president of sales. He held this job until early 1985 when he left the company and was replaced by Howard Fisher. Both had earlier worked with me at Tektronix.\n\nIntergraph eliminated most 16-bit Digital PDP-11 systems from its product line by mid-1983 and focused on the 32-bit VAX machines. By the fall of 1983, Digital had shipped over 500 VAX systems to Intergraph.[17] One exception was the low cost Innovator II which was targeted for use in architectural applications that used a Digital PDP-11/23 computer.\n\nArchitectural software product management was under the direction of Al Kemper who reported to George Stienke[18], vice president of product marketing. Kemper was a well respected author19 on the subject of architectural design and had worked at Ralph M. Parsons as well as Tricad, a Calma spinoff. Kemperâs master plan envisioned the use of Intergraph software for everything from the preparation of massing studies to CAD-generated perspective site views, walkthroughs and what would eventually come to be called âurban simulation.â Kemper also saw the need for using the computer to manage project workflow, an area that would attract tremendous focus in the late 1990s as the use of the Internet took off.[19]\n\nIn the mechanical area, a key development was an agreement signed with Xerox Corporation in January 1984 under which the two companies planned to work together in the development of surface and solids modeling, kinematics analysis, robotics and enhanced numerical control.[20] This was followed by the introduction of a mechanism modeling package two months later that produced data that could be used by third-party analysis programs.\n\nBy mid-1984, Intergraph was firing on all cylinders. It had increased its market share in 1983 to 14.7 percent on $252 million in sales. Only Computervision and IBM had larger sales in this industry. Intergraph participated in every segment of the CAD industry with sales broken down as follows:\n\nMicroStation comes on the scene\n\n(As previously mentioned, the detailed story of the Bentley brothers, Bentley Systems Incorporated (BSI) and MicroStation is contained in Chapter 10 although some of it is repeated here.)\n\nIntergraphâs pricing model until it began selling its own Clipper-based workstations, was to license the IGDS and DMRS software on a per CPU basis. When a company purchased a VAX 11/780 system, it could attach as many terminals as the computer could physically support. The limit really was based on what was the acceptable level of performance for the type of work the customer was doing. There was just one catch. The software only worked with Intergraph manufacturer terminals and these were fairly expensive. Like many other turnkey CAD vendors at the time, the bulk of Intergraphâs revenue came from selling hardware and software was seen as the means that enabled the company to sell hardware.\n\nOne of Intergraphâs major customers in the early 1980s was DuPont in Wilmington, Delaware. Keith Bentley had gone to work at DuPont after receiving an MS degree in electrical engineering from University of Florida. DuPont was using its Intergraph systems for producing process plant electrical diagrams. Usage, however, was limited by the high per seat cost of adding more capacity. Bentley believed that there was a lower cost alternative and set out on his own time to develop a package called PseudoStation. It enabled someone to use Intergraphâs CAD software from a low-cost Digital VT-100 terminal equipped with a graphics card or a Tektronix storage tube terminal such as a 4014. PseudoStation proved to be particularly cost effective when DuPont designers simply wanted to make changes to existing drawings such as revising some text on a drawing.\n\nIn 1983, Keith Bentley left DuPont to work with his brother Barry in California at a company called Dynamic Solutions. Before leaving Dupont, Bentley negotiated an agreement with Dupont under which he received marketing rights to the software in return for which he would provide technical support to the companyâs PseudoStation users. On the way to California, he stopped in Huntsville and offered the software to Intergraph. According to Bentley, âI would have sold [PseudoStation] to Intergraph for $5,000, and that would have been that. [That I didnât] is one of a series of lucky coincidencesâ¦..â[21]\n\nLos Angeles had a large number of Intergraph installations and soon Keith and Barry Bentley found a receptive audience for PseudoStation. Keith founded Bentley Systems Inc. and arranged to have Dynamic Solutions market the software in exchange for work he did on that companyâs software. Soon Keith and Barry sold their interest in Dynamic Solutions and relocated to the Philadelphia area where they were joined by brother Scott and Ray. Within a short time they sold over 350 copies of the terminalbased PseudoStation software.\n\nAfter relocating to Philadelphia, Keith became convinced that what Intergraph was doing on a VAX, he could do on a IBM PC/AT. This new version of the software was soon known as MicroStation. In January 1987 Intergraph purchased a 50 percent interest in Bentley Systems for $3 million and announced that MicroStation would be marketed by Intergraph on both UNIX and PC platforms.\n\nMicro IGDS â an alternative to MicroStation\n\nBentley Systems was not the first PC CAD software company Intergraph acquired an interest in. CNR Research was started by two former employees of Bechtel Power Corporation in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Antonio Robinson and Erdwing Coronado. Robinson had been a system engineer for Bechtel while Coronado was a senior programmer-analyst. When Bechtel announced plans to shut down its Ann Arbor office in 1984, the two decided to start their own software company, CNR Research, with Robinson as president and Coronado as vice president of R&D.\n\nInitially, the two focused on providing CAD/CAM consulting based on their knowledge of Intergraph systems and Digital hardware. In April, 1985, the two decided to create a two-dimensional drafting package compatible with Intergraphâs IGDS. Called C-CADD, it ran under both MS-DOS and UNIX and implemented the equivalent of about 30 to 40 percent of the commands in IGDS. According to A-E-C Automation Newsletter, this represented over 90 percent of the functionality in IGDS. The software sold for $3,000 per copy, a little more expensive than AutoCAD.\n\nC-CADD was written in C, a fairly new programming language at the time and its files were compatible with Intergraphâs IGDS file structure so no translation was necessary. Competitors, including VersaCAD and Autodesk, were promoting the fact that they had software available for translating Intergraph drawing files. In May 1986, Intergraph acquired a 50 percent equity interest in CNR Research. Under the new relationship, CNR continued to market the PC version of C-CADD through its existing reseller channel (eight companies at the time) while Intergraph marketed the UNIX version, now known as MicroIGDS, through it sales organization.[22] Once Intergraph acquired an interest in Bentley, it lost interest in marketing the UNIX version of MicroGDS and CNR Research and C-CADD simply faded away.\n\nIntergraph software in the mid-1980s\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Intergraphâs primary graphics software package was IGDS. Data was maintained in either a two-dimensional or three-dimensional format with some difficulty in moving it from one state to the other. One of the major limitations was that an active drawing could only have 63 layers of data. This was far less than competitive systems which typically could store 256 or more layers and in some cases an unlimited number of layers. In addition, up to three reference drawings each with its own 63 layers could be overlaid with the base drawing. Another shortcoming was the fact that IGDS used a 32-bit fixed point format at a time when other vendors had switched or were in the process of switching to 32-bit and 64-bit floating point data. It was a trade-off between performance and precision.\n\nIGDS was particularly efficient when being used for two-dimensional drafting. One reason for this was that the drawing data did not carry with it three-dimensional data that was not needed as did some competing system. The software generated up to eight independent views of a drawing and displayed up to four on each screen of a doublescreen workstation. A macro language called User Command enabled users to combine a series of tasks in a single command. The primary user interface was a hard copy menu on a large digitizer located in front of the terminalâs display(s). For a user to change the layout of the menu or to add new commands required the knowledge of FORTRAN programming. By mid-1985, the interface was in the process of being changed to more on-screen menus and âfill in the blankâ dialog boxes.\n\nMost CAD packages then on the market stored attribute data as part of the drawing file. Intergraph took a different approach and stored this data in a separate file which was managed by the previously mentioned DMRS (Data Management Retrieval System)software. DMRS primarily used a CODASYL compliant hierarchical data structure although by mid-1985, Intergraph was incorporating some relational technology into the package.\n\nDMRS was not required to do straight-forward CAD tasks such as drafting and many customers opted not to use it because of the time required to learn the software. One shortcoming was that a user could not back up the data associated with a single drawing file but had to back up the entire DMRS database. This might have worked well for a utility mapping customer but it really was awkward for the typical architecture or engineering organization to use.\n\nAlthough DMRS could be used without Intergraphâs File Processor, that hardware greatly improved performance when it was part of a VAX configuration. The linkage between DMRS and IGDS was managed by a software module called Attribute Services. The price of the data management software as well as IGDS was bundled in with the cost of the VAX computer at the heart of all Intergraph systems at this time.\n\nLike all other CAD vendors, Intergraph was also becoming interested in solids modeling. Its implementation of solids technology, Solids Modeler, was tightly coupled to IGDS. Wire frame and surface defined geometry could be used to create solids. The Graphics Processor was required in order to utilize this software.\n\nIntergraph had perhaps the largest array of applications software of any vendor in the industry at this time. These application fell in several broad categories.\n\nProcess plant design.\n\nEngineering design.\n\nArchitecture.\n\nMapping.\n\nPetroleum exploration and production.\n\nMechanical engineering.\n\nElectrical engineering.\n\nTechnical illustration.\n\nAlthough the open architecture of the companyâs VAX systems enabled outside parties to develop software to run on Intergraph systems, there were few such packages. Part of this was due to the fact that the company did not particularly encourage thirdparty developers and part was due to fact that these developers would have had to purchase a VAX system from Intergraph in order to do any development work. Complicating the development of third-party software was the fact that Intergraph fine tuned the VAX VMS operating system to give high priority to the companyâs workstations. Outside developers had to understand what had been done and adapt their software to these modifications or their software would not operate effectively.\n\nTypical prices\n\nSome of the typical Intergraph prices as of mid-1985 were:\n\nWhile some of these software prices seem high, it should be remembered that these were the cost per VAX system. If a VAX 11/785 had a ten workstations doing mechanical design then the cost of the application software per user was only $1,000.\n\nA new generation of workstations\n\nIn 1983 Intergraph began demonstrating new single screen InterPro and dual screen InterAct terminals that utilized Motorolaâs 68000 microprocessor. Initially, the InterPro was just available as a monochromatic unit. The first InterPro unit was the Model DSP046 with a price of $25,000.[24] A color InterPro was introduced in mid-1984 for $42,000. The DSP052 InterAct had dual monochromatic screens while the DSP055 had one monochromatic screen and one color. All these units had 1280 by 1024 resolution. The InterAct used a structural foam type of construction and provided substantial operator control over the height and angle of the displays and the digitizer table.\n\nBy 1984 it was fairly clear to most executives in the CAD industry that the future was with networked workstations rather than minicomputer-based systems. While competitors such as Auto-trol Technology, Calma, and SDRC were making the transition to commercially available workstations from Apollo and Sun Microsystems, Intergraph had started down the path of building its own workstations and, in effect, becoming a vendor of commercial workstations as well as CAD systems. It was clear that Intergraph saw networked workstations as the wave of the future. It just took the company longer to get there than it would have liked. In November 1982, Jim Meadlock had been quoted as saying âIf I were starting a new company today, I would build a standalone workstation operating in a network.â26\n\nIn September 1984 Intergraph announced the single screen InterPro 32 workstation which was intended to use the National Semiconductor 32032 microprocessor as well as an Intel 80186 microprocessor. It was designed to run UNIX on the 32032 and MS/DOS on the 80186 although not both at the same time. Initially, the company said that deliveries would start in the first quarter of 1985. The InterPro 32 was intended to function as a stand-alone UNIX workstation, as a terminal for Intergraphâs existing VAX-based systems, as a terminal emulator for devices such as the Tektronix 4014 or as a IBM-compatible PC.\n\nThe price for the hardware was set at $20,000 which, given the intended capabilities, appeared to be very competitive.[25] There was a major misconception at the time, however. Although Intergraph did not claim that the InterPro 32 would be able to directly execute IGDS software, the impression among many potential prospects was that it would do so. The initial InterPro 32 had a 15-inch color monitor with 1184 by 884 resolution. It displayed 64 colors from a palette of 4,096. It had a base memory of 1.75MB upgradable to 4MB. It also had as 26MB hard disk and a floppy disk as well as a 64-bit floating point processor.\n\nNumerous other workstation manufacturers with names we have long since forgotten such as Syte, Saber and Mosaic, planned to introduce workstations in this time period using the 32032 microprocessor. The 32032 nomenclature referred to the 32-bit instruction size and 32-bit data bus architecture. National Semiconductor had not yet produced deliverable 32032 chips and was providing its OEM customers the 32016 with a 16-bit data architecture as an interim microprocessor. The InterPro 32 based on the 32016 was slow compared to competitive products from Apollo and Sun. National was never able to produce 32032s in quantity and eventually most of the workstations vendors developing product lines dependent on this chip went out of business.\n\nAt the same time that Intergraph announced the InterPro 32, it also announced support for Digitalâs MicroVAX II which would support up to four workstations. The basic computer was priced from $40,000 to $60,000 with workstations extra. Packaged by Intergraph as the Model 250 it was also referred to as the Micro II. Deliveries were scheduled for the second quarter of 1985. One problem with the MicroVAX was that Digital replaced the UNIBUS used on prior VAX system with a slower Q-BUS.\n\nIntergraph, in turn, replaced the Q-BUS with a data bus of its own design called the INTERBUS which had a capacity of 13.3 Mbps. The InterPro 32 connected to VAX systems via an Ethernet link. In what was perhaps a strategic mistake, Intergraph chose to use Xeroxâs XNS Ethernet protocol rather than the TCP/IP Ethernet protocol that most other computer manufacturers were using. Perhaps this was done because Xerox was emerging as a major Intergraph customer.\n\nAt the AUTOFACT-6 Conference in Anaheim, California in October 1984 the units on display were unable to execute IGDS software on a VAX computer. A complete one-station system consisting of a MicroVAX II and an InterPro 32 with IGDS, DMRS and architectural drafting software was eventually launched in June 1985 at a somewhat expensive $94,000.[26] A dual MicroVAX II system called the 252 was introduced in August 1986. The MicroVAX system did not support either Intergraphâs File Processor or Graphics Processor.\n\nIntergraph began shipping InterPro 32 units based on the 32016 in early 1985 with the commitment that they would be upgraded to the 32032 as soon as that microprocessor was available.[27][28] The company also said it would provide IGDS software on the InterPro 32 along with applications such as schematic drafting. This never occurred as the company shifted its focus to MicroStation for UNIX platforms. Some stand-alone UNIX-based applications were available including the FEA software Intergraph had obtained when it acquired the Rand Group.\n\nIt was still not clear as of April 1985 if Intergraph intended to completely replace its VAX systems with the new UNIX workstations.30 By the SYSTEMS-85 conference in June 1985 in Anaheim, California Intergraph was able to demonstrate the InterPro 32 as a terminal running IGDS on both a VAX 11/750 and on a MicroVAX II. Intergraphâs UNIX implementation supported multi-tasking with each task running in its own window. Separate tasks could be logged on to different VAX systems. As an example, a user could be running a complex analysis task on a VAX 11/785 while doing interactive drafting on a MicroVAX II.\n\nEventually, Intergraph got tired of waiting for National to deliver the 32032 and switched to Fairchild Semiconductorâs Clipper microprocessor. This move would eventually radically change the fortunes of Intergraph but that is a story covered elsewhere in this chapter. In mid-1986, Intergraph introduced ten Clipper-based workstations and two servers including InterPro, InterAct, InterView and InterServe units.\n\nThe difference between these workstations was that the InterPro was a desktop unit while the InterAct used Intergraphâs traditional dual screen packaging. The InterView was a limited function version of the Interpro that was intended to be used for data entry and graphic viewing. There was also a limited production unit called the InterMap that was intended for use with photogrammetry equipment. These systems all ran Intergraphâs implementation of UNIX called CLIX. The InterPro and InterAct workstations were priced from $29,000 to $72,000 while the InterServe servers were priced from $22,000 to $29,000.\n\nThe InterPro units were initially intended to be used as either a VAX terminal or as a stand-alone workstation while the InterActs were more expensive stand-alone units with high performance graphics. Intergraph used the Weitek floating point engine in these units with a display processor that could support 512 colors from a palette of 16 million and display 100,000 vectors per second. This was about as good as anything that workstation manufacturers such as Sun and Apollo could offer. The InterPro 32C, introduced in July 1986, offered five MIPS performance for just $25,000. At the time, this was a significant level of performance for a moderate price tag. Both 15-inch and 19inch displays were available on the InterPro 32C.\n\nThe transition to UNIX\n\nA significant problem that would plague Intergraph for several years was that customers, especially large government agencies, wanted industry-standard UNIX systems rather than proprietary systems such as Digital VAX computers. The UNIX version of MicroStation was the primary graphics system for the companyâs new workstations. The major problem the company faced was converting its vast array of applications that had been developed to work with IGDS and DMRS to now work with MicroStation. This was a substantial task and it was the late 1980s before the bulk of the work was completed.\n\nWhile this transition was proceeding Intergraph had to install a mixture of VAX and UNIX systems at many customer locations since some applications were only available on the older machines. In other cases, the company was forced to provide customers with VAX systems which were subsequently swapped out for Clipper-based UNIX workstations.\n\nOne aspect of moving from VAX-based IGDS and DMRS to MicroStation on the new UNIX workstations was the need to replace the hardware functionality of the DSK062 File Processor with its software equivalent. To a lesser extent the same applied to converting tasks handled by the INF096 and INF103 Graphics Processors with either UNIX software or comparable functionality incorporated into the workstationâs graphics hardware.\n\nPursuing the mechanical CAD market\n\nBy the early 1980s it was clear that the largest overall segment of the CAD industry going forward would be the mechanical sector. The first Intergraph systems were sold into this market in 1982. Intergraphâs early software for this market was simply its IGDS software with mechanical drafting and manufacturing applications built on top. Starting out somewhat slowly in the mechanical market, Intergraph developed some fairly decent NC software by mid-1985. In particular, the company took advantage of its ability to rapidly display color shaded surfaces to show NC tool paths on top of these shaded surfaces.\n\nThe software was mostly on-screen menu driven with extensive use of dialog boxes and icons. The companyâs three-dimension modeling software handled most types of mathematical surfaces including planes, cylinders, ruled surfaces, NURBS, and Bezier surfaces. Intergraph, however, was always playing catch-up in the mechanical software arena and never provided its mechanical R&D staff with sufficient resources to dominate this software arena like it did mapping and AEC. Customers used the companyâs mechanical software primarily for designing industrial machinery rather than stylized automotive or consumer products although Intergraph was always able to provide examples of the latter type of user for marketing purposes.\n\nTrying to be all things to all people, Intergraph began developing robotics software with GMF Robotics Corporation in early 1984 and technical illustration software around the same time. The previously mentioned Xerox contract, worth $20 million over three years, was a good example that the company could be serious about this market when it wanted to be. Around the same time, Intergraph introduced the Mechanism Modeling System (MEMS) which interfaced to Mechanical Dynamicsâ ADAMS and DRAMS software.\n\nGetting serious about electronic design\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Intergraph had begun offering software that facilitated the graphical layout of circuit boards several years earlier. Meanwhile, the electronics design industry was making the transition to more automated techniques for designing electronic circuits, a field that soon became known as Electronic Design Automation or EDA. This was a new generation of software, not simply CAD software adapted to the design of circuit boards and integrated circuits.\n\nIntergraphâs management recognized that EDA was a new specialty field and that new software would have to be developed by individuals who understood what was involved. Rather than setting up such as group in Huntsville, in September 1984 Intergraph provided seed funding for Tangent, a new EDA software company in California. It invested $2 million up front for a 50 percent interest in this new six-person firm and provided it with a $4 million line of credit.\n\nIn June 1985, Intergraph announced two EDA products. The first, which ran on the InterPro 32, supported logic capture, rules checking, timing analysis, as well as logic and fault simulation. According to the Anderson Report, the software sold for $5,000 per seat. The other package, TANCELL, handled the physical design of semi-custom integrated circuits. It ran on a VAX computer and sold for $75,000 per system.[29]\n\nEventually, Tangent was acquired by Cadence Design Systems in early 1989 with part of the deal envisioning Cadence porting its EDA software to Intergraphâs Clipper workstations. To the best of my knowledge, this never happened.\n\nIn December 1990, Intergraph acquired Dazix, the company that was formed in May 1989 as a result of the merger of Daisy and CADnetix. Within months of being formed, Dazix was in deep financial trouble and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This was in spite of having $90 million in revenue in 1989.\n\nOn the surface, it looked as if Intergraph had gotten a bargain since it paid just $14 million for the company, $10 million in cash and $4 million in stock. One of the underlying reasons for Intergraph making this move was to be able to offer customers combined electronic and mechanical design solutions.\n\nDazix had recently ported its software to Sun workstations and Intergraph stated in early January, 1991 that it would do the same with its existing electronic design packages. The statement was made, however, that there were no plans to convert the companyâs mechanical software to the Sun platform. That generated concern among users and tended to decrease the attractiveness of Intergraphâs combined electronic and mechanical solution since Sun computers were rapidly becoming the preferred workstation platform within the electronics industry.\n\nIf nothing else, Intergraph knew how to respond to rumblings among its customers. In February, the company signed an OEM agreement with Sun worth $150 million over three years. This was followed shortly thereafter with the announcement that both MicroStation and I/EMS (the companyâs new mechanical design software) would be ported to the Sun platform, MicroStation by the first quarter of 1992 and I/EMS by the second quarter. Other than MicroStation and the mechanical product line, however, there were no plans to port other Intergraph software to Sun computers. Meadlock summed up the situation:\n\nâTodayâs mechanical engineering marketplace demands the flexibility of a dual platform offering. Our customers tell us they want to be able to easily integrate the electronic and mechanical applications. Having already made the commitment to support our Dazix customers with both Clipper and SPARC workstations, it was a natural decision to move the mechanical product offerings onto the SPARC platform.â[30]\n\nInitially, the acquired company was referred to as Dazix, An Intergraph Company.\n\nIntergraph continued to pour money into the EDA market. In July 1991, it purchased an 18 percent interest in Silvar Lisco for $1.1 million in cash. By early 1992, the EDA portion of Intergraph was generating over $100 million in annual revenues. Subsequently, the Dazix name was changed to VeriBest. This operation never made any money for Intergraph, however, and it was eventually sold to Mentor Graphics in October 1999 for $11 million.[31] According to Electronic News, Intergraph had planned to take Veribest public, but a continuous string of unprofitable quarters, driven by a failure to achieve critical mass, hastened the companyâs decision to sell VeriBest. Jim Meadlock was quoted as stating:\n\nâWhile we think we had an extremely good set of products, we had a hard time making any money. We did set up Veribest to make it an independent company, but we never quite got the economy of scale to be there. (An initial public offering) was the hope, but we finally decided that we werenât going to make it on our own.â[32]\n\nIntergraph acquires Rand Group\n\nIntergraph added structural analysis software to its product line by licensing a finite element analysis package called Rand-Micas developed by Len Rand. Intergraph named it Intergraph/Rand-Micas and sold it for $25,000 per system. In 1985, Intergraph acquired Randâs Dallas-based company and he went to work for them as president of a new organization called Intergraph-Rand Corporation.\n\nIntergraph becomes a billion dollar company\n\nIn 1985, Intergraph became the second largest CAD vendor after IBM, pushing Computervision into third place. From $526 million in 1985, the companyâs revenues soared to over $1 billion in 1990. By 1992 the company had revenues of $1.18 billion and ranked Number 315 in the Fortune 500 for that year. That this strong growth came about as other vendors including Auto-trol Technology, Computervision and Applicon stumbled during the latter 1980s did not surprise knowledgeable industry observers. Ken Anderson probably summed it up best in the August 1986 issue of the Anderson Report.\n\nâCompetitors and some financial analysts wait for Intergraph to stumble in its relentless growth. Meanwhile the crew in Huntsville seems almost oblivious to outside pressures as they focus on expanding market share across all CAD/CAM applications. Intergraph has a three pronged strategy for growth: internal product development, strategic alliances and acquisition. Two issues are key in the continuing saga of this premier company. Intergraph totally dominates the mapping application and they make the most efficient use of R & D investment of any company in CAD/CAM. This R & D prowess provides a continuing stream of new hardware and software products. Jim Meadlock, Pres. has become a legend in his ability to manage growth and at the same time elicit a high level of dedication from the people at Intergraph.â[33]\n\nA critical aspect of Intergraphâs product strategy was the selection of Fairchildâs Clipper microprocessor to power its workstations at a time when most of the industry heavyweights were going with Motorolaâs 68020 microprocessor. In mid 1986, the Clipper was perhaps five times as fast as the 68020 but it was an unproven product. One of the issues driving Intergraph to move as rapidly as possible to its own workstations was that Digital was in the process of reducing the discounts it provided to OEM customers. This made the resale of Digital computers less attractive to companies such as Intergraph.\n\nAs mentioned above, the major challenge facing Intergraph in mid-1986 was making the transition from a VAX VMS host-based software environment to a UNIX environment using networked workstations and servers. While developing the new UNIX software, Intergraph had to continue maintaining and adding some enhancements to its VAX software in order to keep its existing customers happy. For some time, the companyâs customers seemed to be content with using the new workstations as VAX terminals while Intergraph chipped away at converting its software products.\n\nIntergraph planned to use this software transition as an opportunity to implement some new technologies. In particular, the company began developing software that used âobject-orientedâ software techniques. Eventually, this would become fairly standard within the software community but in 1986 it was still a fairly radical concept.\n\nAt the time, Intergraphâs shift to UNIX workstations looked like a smart move and for a number of years it was. Another option existed at the time that might have proven more advantageous in the long run. That was the emergence of the PC as a serious CAD platform. Only a few small companies such as Autodesk and VersaCAD saw this opportunity and pursued it agressively. Already, in areas such as electronic schematic capture, designers were starting to use PC-based software with increasing frequency. Within a decade, Intergraph would end up switching once more â this time from the Clipper-based UNIX workstations to Windows and the PC.\n\nAnother issue which would later cause Intergraph untold grief was its focus on being a manufacturing company. By mid-1986 the company had grown to 5,100 employees and was one of the largest employers in northern Alabama. Over the next five years this number would double to over 10,000. Most of these employees staffed the companyâs growing manufacturing operation.\n\nWhile the early VAX systems the company sold were virtually standard Digital products except for the File Processor and Graphics Processor, the Micro II systems were Digitalâs MicroVAXes repackaged by Intergraph. Not only did the company produce its own terminals as did many other turnkey vendors, but it was the only vendor that actually manufactured its own display monitors. The result was perhaps the best CAD display on the market but the cost was a huge manufacturing infrastructure.\n\nThe October 1986 issue of the Computer Aided Design Report contained a detailed analysis of Intergraph. In it Steve Wolf wrote:\n\nâ We tried hard to dig up an Intergraph user who didnât like the product or the company. We didnât find one. Most reported that the company seems genuinely interested in making suggested improvements. They report that hardware reliability is excellentâ¦â¦Intergraphâs software combined with the powerful Interact terminal is probably the best twodimensional drafting system available at any priceâ¦â¦The firm has built good products because it has a small closely knit team of hardware and software wizards lead by one man with a good sense of market timing. As it becomes larger, however, itâs doubtful that Meadlock can continue to control Intergraph as easily as he has done in the past.â[34]\n\nIntergraph starts serious run at mechanical CAD market\n\nIn the latter part of 1986 Intergraph began a major push into the mechanical market space with the launch of I/EMS (Intergraph Engineering Modeling System). The software combined an object-oriented database, NURBS as the means of defining all geometric entities except points and B-REP solids. While these technologies had all been around for several years, no one had combined them in a commercial system due to the computing resources required. With a 5 MIPS InterPro/32C, Intergraph had a platform that could handle this software with barely adequate performance. Everyone knew, however, that more powerful workstations were just around the corner.[35]\n\nA prototype of this software was shown at AUTOFACT â86 in Detroit in November 1986. The software was demonstrated running on an InterPro 32C workstation, not on a VAX using the InterPro 32C simply as a terminal. Steve Wolf, who typically was quite reserved when describing new CAD products was ecstatic about I/EMS.\n\nâThanks to the computing speed of the Interpro 32C, interactive graphics run faster on this device than on any weâve seen. The Interpro 32C is so fast that it lets designers mold sculptured surfaces interactively as if they were putty. Move a control point and the Interpro shows instantly the effect that the change will have on the surfaceâ¦..Dazzling is the only word we can think of to describe the user controls of Intergraphâs new applications.â[36]\n\nThe version of I/EMS previewed at AUTOFACT supported dimension-driven mechanical drafting. The designer could define the relationships between geometry and when a dimension was changed, the geometry would adapt to that new value. While, this capability was not as comprehensive as what Parametric Technology would introduce a few years later, I/EMS did precede Pro/ENGINEER by several years.\n\nThe performance and functional capabilities incorporated into I/EMS were partially due to the fact that it was new software that used advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming. This enabled Intergraph to associate NC tool paths with model surfaces. If the surface was changed, the tool paths could be regenerated without additional user intervention. Wolf stated that tool paths that took 30 minutes to generate on a VAX system took only 30 seconds on the InterPro 32C. The software was scheduled to be released in mid-1987. Intergraph began shipping beta test versions of I/EMS in December 1986 and by May 1987 had installed about 100 copies.\n\nIntergraph becomes a workstation vendor[37]\n\n1987 was a year of transition for Intergraph and for the CAD/CAM industry in general. Other than CADAM, Inc. and a few others, vendors were rapidly switching away from minicomputer and mainframe-based systems to engineering workstations and to a lesser extent, personal computers. Customers were quickly becoming comfortable with the idea of purchasing industry-standard workstations running the UNIX operating system and linking them together in networks using the Ethernet protocol.\n\nBy this point, most major users of CAD technology were already on their second or third generation system and the sophistication of the users was increasing rapidly. To some extent, they were willing to purchase hardware and software separately even if it meant dealing with multiple vendors.\n\nThere was another major trend impacting the vendors in this industry â the price of CAD technology on a per seat basis was falling like a rock. In four years the typical system had dropped from $90,000 per seat to about $40,000. Although the volume was increasing, it was not increasing fast enough to maintain the 30 to 50 percent overall industry growth rates of prior years. By 1987 annual growth had slowed to 12 to 15 percent. In the first quarter of 1987 Intergraph had revenue of $128 million compared to $147 million during the same period a year earlier. Each vendor reacted to these changes differently.\n\nSome companies, such as SDRC were becoming pure software vendors while others such as Calma and Auto-trol resold workstations purchased from Sun and Apollo. Computervision acquired workstation components from Sun and added other hardware elements to the products it sold. The other choice was to become a workstation vendor and sell these systems to the general technical market as well as incorporate them into the CAD/CAM systems the company sold. With the InterPro/32C, Intergraph decided to follow this latter path.\n\nThere were a number of reasons why Intergraph became a workstation vendor. First, Digital was becoming more and more difficult to work with even though Intergraph was Digitalâs largest OEM customer. By mid-1987, the company had installed over 3,000 VAX systems with over 15,000 terminals. Digital was cutting OEM discounts and for a period of time treated details about its VAXBI bus as proprietary information. The latter step made it impossible for Intergraph to interface its communications and file processors to the latest VAX systems. Although the two companies eventually resolved this issue it probably convinced Intergraph managers that Digital was no longer a reliable partner.\n\nAnother major reason that Intergraph decided to build its own workstations and servers was that the company had built up a considerable manufacturing infrastructure in Huntsville. Most of these facilities were fairly new and shutting down this operation would have been very expensive. Also, manufacturing its own workstations was expected to generate more profit for the company as compared to reselling workstations from companies such as Sun or Apollo.\n\nSince the companyâs software did not run on other UNIX workstations, if a customer wanted Intergraph software then it had to buy the workstations from Intergraph also. The extreme degree of vertical integration at Intergraph was demonstrated by the fact that the company had a fleet of ten tractor-trailers crisscrossing the United States and Canada delivering systems to its customers rather than relying on commercial carriers.\n\nIntergraphâs customers were enthusiastic about the new InterPro products with nearly 2,000 Clipper-based workstations on back order by mid-1987. The problem was that Fairchild was only delivering 75 to 100 C100 Clipper chips per week, about the same volume as incoming orders. Within a few months this shortage was corrected and Intergraph was able to clear its backlog.\n\nA more significant problem was that Intergraph had decided to fundamentally rewrite its software for the new UNIX workstations rather than simply port the legacy VMS software to these machines. In the long run that was probably the right move but in the short run it led to there being little software that ran in native mode on the InterPro 32/C. There were perhaps a dozen packages available with another 15 scheduled by the end of 1987.\n\nIf the company was to be a viable workstation vendor, it needed more software for its customers to use. In February 1987 Intergraph had announced that it was entering the general purpose workstation market and it began soliciting third party software vendors to port their software to the InterPro 32C. There was a fatal flaw in this strategy, however. A large volume of workstation sales at Sun and Apollo came from CAD/CAM software vendors, either directly as OEM resellers or indirectly by referral. This was a major portion of the workstation market in the late1980s and none of these software companies were particularly interested in supporting a platform produced by a direct competitor when viable alternatives were available.\n\nBut Intergraph pushed ahead with its workstation strategy and in July 1987 introduced a family of new workstations that still used a 5 MIPS C100 Clipper microprocessor. Memory ranged from 8MB to 80MB and larger disk memories were available. A new GZ graphics accelerator capable of nearly real time generation of shaded images was available at the high end.\n\nThe GZ was the beginning of a long line of high-performance graphics accelerators that would eventually result in a separate business unit focused just on these devices. With these new workstations and servers Intergraph adopted more industry standards. Its Ethernet communications now supported TCP/IP as well as XNS, the company planned to begin using the X Windows graphics standard along with the MOTIF user interface and Intergraph also planned to support Sunâs NFS file protocol.\n\nThe company stated that it would continue to market and support VAX systems, but the reality was that little new software was being developed for these platforms. Initially, the concept was that the VAX computers would be used to manage large project data files while the Clipper workstations would be used for interactive work. Most customers did not like the idea of supporting two hardware platforms and two operating systems and once Intergraphâs servers were able to handle large volumes of data, this idea faded into the background.\n\nThe other problem facing Intergraph as it tried to build a commercial workstation and server business was that it was dependent upon Fairchild for progress in microprocessor performance and Fairchild was only marginally up to the challenge. In July 1987, Sun Microsystems introduced new workstations that used a 10 MIPS SPARC processor, twice the raw performance of Intergraphâs then current Clipper systems.\n\nTaking control of its own microprocessor destiny\n\nFairchild Semiconductor was owned by Schlumberger Ltd., the huge international oil field services firm. Schlumberger had acquired Fairchild in 1979 for $425 million. It turned out to be a major disappointment for its new owner and by mid-1987,\n\nSchlumberger was discussing sale of the subsidiary to National Semiconductor. National made no secret of its plans to shut down the Clipper microprocessor operation once it completed the acquisition.\n\nHaving selected and then dropped Nationalâs microprocessor product line, Intergraph was now faced with making another significant change in its product line. This time it was a much more serious situation since Intergraph had already sold more than 3,000 Clipper-based workstations and servers. An abrupt termination of the product line would have meant the loss of the Clipper development staff and no future processors even if National continued manufacturing the existing products for some period of time.\n\nIn September 1987, Intergraph signed an agreement with National to acquire the Advanced Processor Division of Fairchild to be effective when National completed its acquisition of the remainder of Fairchild. Intergraph announced its plans when it did in order to keep the Clipper development and manufacturing staff together. Schlumberger subsequently sold Fairchild to National for $122 million and at the same time Intergraph acquired the Advanced Processor Division for an estimated $10 million including all microprocessor designs and other intellectual property. As described below, the timing of Intergraphâs acquisition and what was included as far as intellectual property would be the basis of several major lawsuits a decade later. But for now, Intergraph controlled its own destiny as far as the Clipper was concerned.\n\nWithin a few months Intergraph was ready to roll out a new C300 Clipper microprocessor at AUTOFACT â87 that was rated at 13 MIPS, almost three times the performance of the initial C100[38]. Internal floating point performance was rated at 3.0 MFLOPS. According to The Anderson Report, this was the level of performance needed to support new object-oriented applications such as I/EMS.[39]\n\nThe company also introduced the low-cost InterPro120 which used the older C100 processor. With 6MB of memory, a hardware floating-point accelerator, an 80MB disk and a 15-inch color monitor, this unit had a list price of just $16,000. A 19-inch monitor raised the price to $19,000. Typical of a new generation of customers was Embraer, the Brazilian manufacturer of small airliners, which purchased 135 InterPro workstations and software for $6.4 million.[40]\n\nCreating a new generation of software products\n\nIn mid-1986 the companyâs management structure still had Jim Meadlock as president and CEO with William Zarecor as executive vice president responsible for overall marketing activity. Bob Thurber was also an executive vice president, responsible for most AEC and mapping activity. Under Thurber, Dr. Eddie Boyle headed up AEC and Utilities while Larry Janzen was responsible for mapping and energy industries.[41] Boyle, with a civil engineering degree from Belfastâs Queens University, was one of the first non-Americans to hold a senior position at Intergraph.\n\nOne of Intergraphâs new software packages for its UNIX workstations was Master Architect, a model based design tool that used object-oriented software development techniques. Design elements could be linked together in an intelligent manner so that when a user moved a door or window, the walls were adjusted appropriately. The $10,000 package enabled users to work with three-dimensional views of the building model and two-dimensional drawings at the same time.\n\nGradually, the number of third-party software packages available on Intergraph workstations began to grow. At AUTOFACT in November 1987, four companies announced plans to port their software to Intergraphâs Clipper workstations. These were Moldflow (plastic flow prediction), Cincom (manufacturing information), SILMA(robotic simulation) and Engineering Mechanics Research (finite element modeling).\n\nIntergraphâs internal software development organization continued to churn out new software programs in 1988 including one of the first implementations of IGES 4.0, an enhanced Product Data Manager package and a new Intergraph/Network File Manager. The latter package provided check-in/check-out capabilities with the data stored on either a VAX or a Clipper system. The company also added new NC software to the I/EMS product line. Subsequent to the acquisition of Ana Tech described below, Intergraph introduced I/Image software which enabled a user to combine scanned raster data with vector data.\n\nNew higher performance workstations and servers\n\nIntergraph announced a number of high performance workstations beginning with the InterPro 3070 at AUTOFACT â88 in Chicago. This workstation used a 40-MHz C300 processor rated at 10 MIPS and had a 27-inch monitor, the largest then sold commercially for CAD/CAM applications. The display processor supported two million pixels at 1664 by 1248 resolution. The 3070 was priced at $56,000. The company was thought to be working on a new version of the Clipper that would run at 60 MIPS.\n\nThe 3070 was followed in January 1989 by two C300 servers, the InterServe 3005 and the InterServe 4000. The latter machine supported up to 23GB of disk storage. This was followed by two new workstations, the 3050 and the 3060. A separate Intel 80386 processor supported input/output functions. Display resolution was 1184 by 884 and up to 512 colors could be displayed. In February, Intergraph announced a new higher performance microprocessor, the C300 Plus. Rated at 30 MIPS, it was initially offered in a server configuration, the InterServe 3505 with 32 to 160MB of memory and up to 6.5GB of disk storage.\n\nIn the spring of 1989, Intergraph broaden its market reach by introducing an Apple Macintosh version of MicroStation as an entry level design and drafting tool. The software was data compatible with VAX and UNIX versions of Intergraphâs IGDS software. It handled three-dimensional models including producing shaded images. Up to 32 reference files were supported as were normal Apple functions such as the clipboard, a one-button mouse and Undo/Redo. The user interface supported over 450 commands.\n\nOne of the key features of MicroStation was that data files were binary compatible on all the platforms the software was offered on. Therefore, files could easily be exchanged between PC, VAX, Apple and Intergraph systems without a conversion step. Also, MicroStation operated on disk-based files rather than memory-based files meaning that if there was a power failure or system crash, valuable data would not be lost.\n\nDocument scanning\n\nIn August 1988 Intergraph acquired ANA Tech Corporation of Littleton, Colorado. ANA Tech was a manufacturer of large format scanners capable of handling engineering drawings and maps as well as a developer of software for editing and converting scanned raster images into vector data files that could be processed by computer graphics software such as Intergraphâs IGDS.\n\nANA Tech had evolved from an earlier company, Interactive Systems Corporation. The key component for processing scanned drawings was a special processor called the VANA for Vector ANAlyzer as described below. A complete system consisted of:\n\nA large format document scanner,\n\nThe VANA Vectorizer,\n\nThe VANA Controller (VAX 11/750)\n\nAnd software for tying it all together.\n\nIn its early days, circa 1982, the company used scanners produced by companies such as Optronics and Systems Group. The latter company produced a scanner specifically for use with the ANA Tech system. The VANA Vectorizer was a custom designed array processor which converted scanned raster data to vectors as a document was being scanned. It was very fast â capable of processing an E-size drawing in several minutes. The VANA Controller was a standard Digital VAX 11/750 computer with a Megatek 7210 graphics controller capable of supporting two monochromatic or color displays. The software was capable of symbol and character recognition using the vectorized data as its starting point. A complete VANA system including a System Group scanner and VAX computer cost $665,000.\n\nThe focus on vectorizing raster data was based on the fact that contemporary CAD systems were not capable of manipulating raster images. These system handled legacy documents using several different techniques. The most common approach was to tape the drawing to a large digitizer table and manually digitize the document line by line. A second approach was to scan the document, display the raster image on a CRT display and use specialized computer software to create a vector and character overlay of the scanned image. The third approach was to convert raster images to vector files either using software in the CAD system or a specialized system such as the Ana Tech VANA.\n\nThe key people behind ANA Tech were David Grover, president, Curtis Lipkie, vice president responsible for software development and Eugene Kleca, vice president responsible for hardware development.[42]\n\nMeanwhile, Intergraph was developing its own expertise in the scanning area. Using scanner hardware from Optronics, a company it would later acquire, Intergraph offered a documents scanning product that included a hardware raster to vector conversion unit simply called the Graphics Processor. As with ANA Tech, character recognition was not particularly effective in the 1983 timeframe. Throughout the 1980s, ANA Tech struggled to become a viable company. There were several infusions of additional venture capital as well as management changes until Intergraph acquired the company in 1988. Gradually, the VANA Vectorizor was phased out and the company focused on large format scanners and raster processing software.\n\nIn June 1992 ANA Tech introduced the Eagle 4080ET scanner with 800 dpi resolution. It was priced at $35,000 and worked with PCs as well as Intergraph and Sun UNIX workstations. A color version, the Eagle 4080C was introduced in late 1993 priced at $95,000. It could scan a 41-inch wide multi-color map in 12 minutes and at the same time separate the data into seven layers based upon the colors on the original document.\n\nWhen a USGS Quad sheet was scanned and then plotted on an HP inkjet plotter it was hard at first to tell the plotted copy from the original.[43]\n\nA key product that came out of Intergraphâs association with ANA Tech was the I/RAS software for editing raster data. I/RAS was tightly integrated with MicroStation. The software could be used to replace raster data with vector elements. New vector elements were overlaid on the raster image and then once the user was satisfied with the results, the raster data was removed. There were several different version of the I/RAS software.\n\nIn mid-1995, ANA Tech introduced a new low-cost scanner, the Eagle SLI 3840.\n\nThis 100-pound desktop unit could scan an E-size drawings in as little as 15 seconds at 200 dpi resolution. It was capable of resolutions as fine as 800 dpi and sold for $12,800 in the United States.[44] ANA Tech began to increase its focus on raster editing software around 1996. In that year it introduced its SCANSMITH line of software designed for real-time scanning and post-processing of raster documents. This was followed the next year with the companyâs PREDITOR (Professional Raster Editor) software package that enabled user to edit large raster images irrespective of the scanning equipment being used.\n\nIn April 1998, Intergraph established a new Imaging Systems Division with Lewis Graham as its vice president and manager. This division consisted of the companyâs photogrametric and reprographics software, the ImageStation Z, PhotoScan TD precision scanners and the ANA Tech scanning hardware. With this change in management, Eugene Kleca and Curt Liepke, both ANA Tech founders, left Intergraph and set up a new company, Image Peak Systems.\n\nIntergraph at the end of the 1980s\n\nDuring the 1980s, Intergraph grew rapidly, created a global presence, became a significant manufacturer of UNIX workstations and servers and added tens of thousands of users. It was clearly a company âon a roll.â The November 1989 issue of The Anderson Report was optimistic about Intergraphâs future:\n\nâIn our view the company made the right decisions. Intergraph has done an excellent job of merging a UNIX-based product line with their VAX/VMS-based solutionsâ¦.. rather than porting existing applications to UNIX, Intergraph made a decision to develop new object-oriented foundations for their CAD/CAM software. This choice held even higher risk than the decision to build workstations.â\n\nBy the end of 1989, over 80 percent of the companyâs system revenue resulted from the sale of UNIX workstations and related software. The only reason it was not 100 percent was that there were still some applications such as plant design software that were only available on VAX systems. Not only was Intergraph attempting to develop a commercial business selling Clipper-based workstations and servers but its was also attempting to sell Clipper microprocessors to other computer system vendors. In the end, it was successful in doing neither. One area where it was starting to have an impact, however, was in the PC CAD market. MicroStation was available on IBM-compatible PCs and Apple Macintosh machines as well as Intergraphâs own UNIX workstations.\n\nThe biggest inhibitor to selling commercial Clipper-based systems was the lack of third party software. Intergraph claimed that there were 500 programs available for these systems, half from independent software firms. The reality was that few of these software companies treated the Clipper systems as a primary platform and many of these packages handled minor applications with limited customer demand. There simply were few mainstream software packages available that could stimulate hardware sales other than Intergraphâs own software.Towards the end of 1989 Intergraph introduced several 50MHz C300 workstations, the 3280 and 3285, which ran at 14 MIPS, the speed originally expected for this microprocessor when it was first introduced. As the year came to a close, Intergraph had an installed base of perhaps 26,000 Clipper systems.[45]\n\nIntergraph had an extremely broad set of its own software products at this point in time, but some cracks were beginning to show. For example, I/EMS which had been introduced in 1986 was only in its second major release three years later. Competitive products such as PTCâs Pro/ENGINEER had not only caught up with I/EMS but had surpassed it in functionality. In the mapping and AEC areas, Intergraph was clearly the industry leader with a growing number of applications running on the companyâs Clipper workstations. New packages such as InRoads for highway design and InFlow for hydraulic design were becoming well accepted industry standards. One weak area was in electronic design where the company offered a rather straight-forward set of packages for the physical design of circuit boards and hybrid circuits.\n\nThe end of 1989 also marked a significant management change at Intergraph. The company acquired Quintus Computer Systems, a developer of Prolog-based[46] software development tools. The president and CEO of Quintus was Elliot James who subsequently became president of Intergraph. Jim Meadlock retained his chairmanship of the companyâs board and his position as CEO. There never was any question as to who was really in charge, however. Although he was supposedly semi-retired and was spending more time at his vacation home in Jupiter, Florida, Meadlockâs influence continued to be felt throughout the company.\n\nOverall, as the company got ready to enter the 1990s, it was functioning as a well oiled machine. It had excellent hardware products that covered all the typical userâs needs except for plotters and these were readily available from companies such as HewlettPackard and CalComp. Its software dominated the high-end mapping and AEC markets and it had adequate mechanical software. The company was profitable and had fairly good management depth. The problem was what over the horizon â the shift to PCs and an entirely different economic model for CAD vendors â changes that would see Intergraph stumble, make some hard decisions and eventually emerge as a well financed software company focused on specific market sectors.\n\nTrying to offer something for everyone\n\nOne significant characteristic of Intergraphâs product strategy in the early 1990s was an attempt to be all things to all people. The company began to aggressively market its Clipper workstations and servers as industry standard products, taking specific aim at Sun Microsystems. Ads appeared in a wide range of publications claiming feature by feature that Intergraphâs systems did everything that Sunâs products did. Intergraph pushed hard to increase the number of third party software packages available on these systems. The companyâs attempt to market the Clipper microprocessors to other computer manufacturers, however, was suspended in October 1990.\n\nBy late 1990, the company was claiming the availability of 900 software packages on the Clipper platform, 600 of which came from other companies. In spite of this momentum, industry observers as well as users were questioning the long term viability of proprietary processor technology. Shortly after Intergraph committed to porting MicroStation and I/EMS to Sun Microsystems workstations as described earlier, CAD/CIM Alert commented on the Clipper product line:\n\nâHowever, we wonder how long these platforms can last. Even though there is a large installed base of customers, the days when proprietary hardware platforms ruled the roost are long since gone.â[47]\n\nIntergraph continued to expand the Clipper product line, however. At AUTOFACT â91 in Chicago, the company launched the two chip C400 Clipper processor. Running at 40 MHz, it was rated at 33 SPECmarks, 33 MIPS and 9 MFLOPS. This was faster than anything Sun Microsystems then had on the market and the expectation was that Intergraph could crank the speed up to 100 MHz in the future. The new 6400 workstation product line using this processor started at $24,900 for the Model 6450. The 6480 with 24-bit graphics was priced at $37,900[48]Around the same time, Intergraph announced that it would no longer offer Digital systems.\n\nI"
