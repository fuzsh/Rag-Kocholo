        "text": "All,\n\nI have a user who needs to know if there is anyway to generate outputs from Intergraph SmartPlant 3D that are AutoCAD friendly. From my internet digging, it sounds like SmartPlant 3D can output models as .DGN. Can anyone confirm that this is true or recommend a better process for producing outputs from SP 3D that are AutoCAD friendly? Would really appreciate any assistance or wisdom that anyone can pass my way! Hope everyone has an awesome and most blessed night!\n\nPeace,\n\nPete\n\nJust a guy on a couch...\n\nPlease give a kudos if helpful and mark as a solution if somehow I got it right.\n\nYou can export sat files in the Drawing and Reports task.\n\n- 3D-Model Data\n\n- check sat-file Button instead of the vue-Button\n\n- save to disk\n\nbtw. there is NO way to export Microstation V8 Models from SP3D.\n\nMicrostation J only.\n\nThere is no such program as Microstation V7i.\n\nIt is either Microstation V7 (aka Microstation J) or Microstation V8i (and lately Microstation C\n\nONNECT)\n\nSince the introduction of S3D2016 you can also Export to Microstation V8 Format.\n\nIn general you have to have Microstation J or Microstation V8i installed on your Workstation.\n\n1. Create a Microstation 3D DGN Component in your Drawing Console\n\n2. Create a Drawing Volume of the part of your plant that you want to export\n\n3. Associate the Drawing Volume to your Microstation 3D DGN Component\n\n4. Create Drawing\n\n5. Chose your Microstation Seed File and the desired Viewstyle for Export\n\n6. Update Drawing"
