If\n\nwe were satisfied that after so many days the items were suitably fixed, then\n\nwe would sign over the money to the builder. If after so many days the\n\nbuilder did not fix these things the mortgage company would return the\n\nescrow money to us so we could pay for the repairs ourselves. As it turned\n\nout, our builder went bankrupt (thankfully after our house was adequately\n\nfinished; our items on our 'escrow list' were not potentially hazardous or\n\ndamaging) we got the money by default.\n\nBe aware that your builder should be made aware of this escrow deal before\n\nclosing, and in fact, the builder has to sign an agreement of understanding\n\nof this escrow account, otherwise the builder's going to expect full payment\n\nat closing.\n\nThis is a common arrangement, and should be considered by all new homebuyers.\n\nBTW, there are lots of books about homebuying and I learned a great deal\n\nfrom one by Peter Miller (I think it was called \"Buy Your First Home Now!\").\n\nIf you're a first-time homebuyer, I highly recommend gaining as much\n\npractical education as possible on the subject prior to even looking for a\n\nhouse.\n\nî—“\n\nIn article <1993Jan28.1...@infonode.ingr.com>, j...@doink.b23b.ingr.com (James B.

Last spring I thought they were\n\nbuilding me a custom house, but they really built their standard house with\n\nany upgrades I specified. The plumber put the outside faucets where he wanted\n\nto, not where I specified on the blueprint. The electrician put telephone\n\nconnections where he wanted them, not where I wanted them. Also, the electrician forgot to install the cable TV outlets, and I had to threaten to\n\ndelay closing before he put them in. In hindsight, I really should have\n\ndelayed closing until everything was fixed, or broke the sales contract.\n\nBefore closing, Mike kept talking about his one year warranty, but I have\n\nfound it is easier to get a budget through Congress than to get Brian Homes\n\nto do any warranty work.\n\nI could list my many problems with my house, but will follow Jim's example\n\nand give details by email if you want them.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|Timothy A.

Our offer was accepted by the\n\nbuilder subject to a satisfactory inspection by a home inspector hired\n\nby buyer (us).\n\nThe inspector found some damaged wood among some other things that\n\nneed replacement since the builder has been living in the house himself\n\nwith his family for 3 years.\n\nWe have it in the contract that then that these damaged wood need to\n\nbe replaced and painted before closing.\n\nAbove from never showing up to do any of the unfinished list that was\n\nlisted down during the closing.\n\nWe have a bad leaks in August 1992 (less than 1 year after we closed).\n\nWe have someone from Sears Home Improvement came over, the guy quickly\n\ndetected that there were some damage woods that were cover and painted\n\nover and the cracks now are causing the leaks. The leaks had resulted\n\nin an area of damage in our ceiling.\n\nI called the original home inspector to take another look, he came\n\nand recognize the same situation. He wrote us a witness statement, stating\n\nthat these are the same piece of woods he listed that needs replacement\n\nand his best estimate for the replacement.\n\nWe go ahead and have the Sears Home Improvement Subcontractor (not the\n\nhome inspector) do the repair, took picture before they started on the job.\n\nThe builder refused to reimburse us of the full amount of repair cost.\n\nBeing a matter of principle, I take this matter to small claim court with\n\nmy husband.\n\nThe judge award us a judgement against this builder for the total amount\n\nof repairment cost in our receipt plus the cost of court fees. We have\n\nnot recover the money, but if he dare to refuse to pay, we can put a judgement\n\nlien on all his real property on sale. Since a judgement lien is a general\n\nlien not a specific lien. We actually spend a lot more time and money than\n\nwhat we can recover from this builder, but it is the principle that counts.\n\nWe only sue for the repair cost and the court fees anyway.\n\nNeither side had any lawyer, we did do our research well, I even attended\n\nreal estate licensing class to analyze the inside-out of law of contract.\n\nWe even attended some other court hearings prior to our scheduled hearing.\n\nMy advice to home buyer, don't penny pinched and pound foolish. I am very\n\nthanksful that we spend $125 on the home inspector before we buy the house.\n\nWe got his name through recommendation of a friend. His witness statement\n\nplus the photos taken were our strongest material of evidence. The builder\n\ntry to say that there was a hail storm in August last year. But the photos\n\nshows clearly that it is not holes or peels problem, but rather you can\n\nsee a thick layer of caucks on wood and paint over it.\n\nIf you are interested with the name of this builder, write me or my\n\nhusband, we will be more than happy to tell you his name. He does not have\n\na company name, so there is not much help to check him with Better Business\n\nBureau. His phone number changes as well everytime he moves to one of his\n\nunsold house.\n\nP.S. \"caveat emptor\"\n\nIn Alabama law, it is 'buyers beware' policy. So when a builder\n\nrecommended that an inspector is just a waste of money and that his\n\nevery step of construction is approved by the city inspector. Think\n\ntwice before you decide. Ask around, how many buyer you know\n\nhave build a new house and have a leaking roof after the first big\n\nstorm. Did that builder came to fix it quickly before further damage\n\noccur ? Will he fix the damage resulted from the leaks as well ?\n\nOfcourse, having an inspector is useless unless it is specified in\n\nyour offer that it is subject to a satisfactory inspection by a\n\nhome inspector of the buyer.\n\nMaribel x7285\n\n--\n\n+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------+\n\n| Dr. Jeroen van der Zijp | |\n\n| Phone : (205)730-1284 | T h i s s p a c e |\n\n| Email : jer...@tparty.b17a.ingr.com | |"
