Intergraph, a leading global provider of engineering and geospatial software, constructed its new corporate headquarters in Madison, Alabama. This project was centered on accommodating Intergraphâ€™s employee base in Northern Alabama as well as meeting the needs of their parent company, Hexagon.

Robins & Morton was selected for this project due to their proven track record on similar structures. Due to close coordination between site work, foundation design work and the design schedule for other disciplines, the actual construction began approximately two months prior to the completion of the balance of design. This fast-track schedule allowed the project to be completed two months sooner than a traditional approach would have allowed.

Upon its completion, the project totaled 250,000 square feet. The five-story facility features office space for 1,100 employees and includes a state-of-the-art data center, customer-friendly conference center, a food service area and lakeside terraces. Both Robins & Morton and the client were satisfied with the outcome of the project and the ahead-of-schedule completion.
