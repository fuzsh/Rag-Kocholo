        "text": "Kelis told Hollywood Unlocked that the couple met in 2002 when she was 22; Nas was nearly 6 years her senior. The two crossed paths at a MTV Video Music Awards after party hosted by Diddy when the âStillmaticâ rapper approached the up-and-coming musician with an unforgettable pick-up line.\n\nâWhatâs your name again,â Nas asked Kelis at the event, as she recalled in a 2003 interview with Complex. When Kelis told him, the Queens native said, âI had to make sure, because â¦ Iâve been wanting to make you my wife for years.â It turns out the Harlem-born singer had been crushing on him, too. Her response? âThatâs great, âcause thatâs what I wanna be.â\n\nIn the same profile, Kelis explained that the two took their time getting to know each other and kept a low profile. Kelis told the magazine that Nas proposed in front of her friends and family at her motherâs house on Christmas Eve in 2002.\n\nâSheâs my best friend,â Nas told Complex. âTo get married now, itâs only right.â\n\nThe musical couple wed in 2005 in Atlanta, Georgia, according to The Source. âGrown-Ishâ star Yara Shahidi, cousin to Nas, served as the flower girl for the nuptials (via Essence). Unfortunately as time went on, their happily-ever-after dreams of a loving, sustainable marriage didnât come true.\n\nncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJiaerW%2B1K2fZpmSpMK1ecqeo6KrXZa7pXnNmqpmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgZA%3D%3D"
