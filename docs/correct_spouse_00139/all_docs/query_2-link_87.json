Nothing surprises me anymore, including this. This is what your life has come to sis?” Nas wrote. “Exploiting some people’s Real struggle and pain . . . just to get at me . . . to get attention ? Fame? Another fight against men?”\n\nKelis claims that she was abused by Nas.\n\nThe couple were married in 2005 and finalized their divorce in 2010. They share a 9-year-old son and received joint custody in March after a lengthy legal battle.\n\nNas posted: “A son needs his father. So many absentee fathers out here and here i am being attacked by your accusations simply because i got us in court to help fix . . . the custody matter?”\n\nKelis had said in a recent interview with blog Hollywood Unlocked, “There was a lot of mental and physical abuse.” Kelis is to be honored by Essence on Sunday during Fashion Week at their Street Style party in Brooklyn.\n\nNas posted, “I shouldnt have ignored the signs from . . . your song first song and video I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW.”"
