        "text": "By CMU Editorial | Published on Wednesday 14 April 2010\n\nNas has been ordered to write a large cheque to ex-wife Kelis as part of the ongoing dispute regarding the spousal and child support the rapper is due to pay is ex.\n\nI’ve kind of lost track with this dispute, but do remember that Kelis wants an awful lot of money from her husband of five years. The court has generally been quite generous to the R&B songstress, but Nas has seemingly not been paying up.\n\nAn LA court told him on Monday to hand over nearly ninety grand there and then, to cover some of the owing back payments, and also increased his monthly commitments to Kelis to accommodate other monies still owing. He’ll also have to pay the majority of Kelis’ legal fees.\n\nTMZ concludes that the moral of this story is that, if you’re millionaire superstars and you’re getting divorced, try to get Kelis’ attorney Laura Wasser on your side."
