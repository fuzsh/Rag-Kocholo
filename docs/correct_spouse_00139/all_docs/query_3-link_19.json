        "text": "Photo Credits: @MikeMorarealty/Facebook @Kelis/Instagram\n\nMike Mora, photographer and husband of R&B singer Kelis, is dead at 37.\n\nThe spouse of the Grammy-nominated \"Milkshake\" artist succumbed to stage 4 stomach cancer.\n\nSteve Satterhwaite of Kelis‘ management team at Red Light Management confirmed the news to \"Entertainment Tonight\" Monday.\n\n“Sadly, it’s true that Mike Mora has passed away,\" Satterhwaite said. \"We would ask all to respect Kelis and her family’s privacy as of right now. Thank you.\"\n\nWhile tragic, Mora's death was not unexpected. In October 2021, in a series of moving Instagram posts, he shared with fans that he had been secretly battling the disease for a year, and at the time of his diagnosis that he had only 18 months to live.\n\n“I thought the whole time that I just had an ulcer,\" he wrote of his diagnosis and eventual hospitalization after experiencing \"the worst pain\" in his stomach. \"With no idea what was about to come my way. Here I was, in a hospital bed, during the middle of the pandemic. All alone.”\n\nAt the time, Mora said he was sharing his diagnosis to “help those that might be experiencing something like this.”\n\nWhile Kelis, 42, has yet to make a public comment on the death of her husband of eight years, some of their famous friends have made their feelings known.\n\nAmong them was Evan Ross, son of legendary Motown diva Diana Ross, who in a now-deleted social media post shared a black-and-white portrait of Mora, with the words, \"We lost a brother Yesterday. We will truly miss you Mike. Thinking of some of the great times we all spent together.\"\n\nHe added, “Everything I saw you do. Was built in passion. I loved connecting again with you. Hearing about your children and the life you and your wife have built. Im sending all the prayers and love to your family brother. @kelis ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️RIP @mikemorafotos.”\n\nMora leaves behind two children with Kelis, who shares custody of another son, Knight Jones (12), with rapper ex-husband Nas. The couple's six-year-old son Shepherd and their daughter Galilee (1)."
