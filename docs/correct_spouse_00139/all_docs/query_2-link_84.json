        "text": "A judge has ordered Nas to pay Kelis nearly $44,000 in monthly support for the near future, a day after the “Milkshake” singer gave birth to the divorcing couple’s baby boy.\n\nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Louis Meisinger issued the order at a Thursday hearing. Neither Nas, whose full name is Nasir Jones, nor Kelis, whose full name is Kelis Rogers, attended Thursday’s hearing.\n\nRogers gave birth to the boy, named Knight, at a New York hospital Wednesday. The 29-year-old filed for divorce from the rapper in April. The couple was married in July 2003.\n\nThe two have been sparring over support payments for several months, with Rogers contending that Jones hasn’t paid many of the costs of her pregnancy and her expenses. His attorney, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told the judge that the rapper has paid $30,000 in expenses and the former couple’s health insurance has been maintained.\n\nA hearing on whether the payments should be altered will be heard on Sept. 8.\n\nKaplan proposed paying Rogers a one-time payment of $20,000 until the judge could settle on an appropriate spousal and child support amount at a later hearing.\n\nMeisinger rejected that offer, saying more money per month would be needed to accommodate Rogers’ lifestyle and was warranted based on income declarations filed with the court. Meisinger told Rogers’ attorney, Laura Wasser, that the singer has 30 days to decide whether to return to the couple’s Los Angeles home. Jones is paying to maintain the property in the meantime.\n\nThe judge also ordered Jones to pay $45,000 to pay Rogers’ attorney fees and for a forensic accountant.\n\nWasser said Kelis is trying to secure a new record deal and hopes to begin recording new music soon. She said Rogers’ income has dipped in recent months.\n\nShe went into labor on Monday, and delivered Knight Jones on Wednesday evening around 9 p.m., according to Rogers’ publicist, Tracy Nguyen. The baby weighed 7 pounds, 8 ounces.\n\nKaplan said Rogers arrived at the hospital about five minutes before his son was born. Nguyen said Rogers’ mother and sister were in the hospital room for the birth.\n\n“The beautiful baby boy and his mother are doing wonderful,” Nguyen said in a statement."
