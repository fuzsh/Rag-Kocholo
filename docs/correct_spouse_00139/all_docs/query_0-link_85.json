        "text": "“Milkshake” singer Kelis made close to $1 million last year, but she still wants her rapper ex Nas to pay more in child support.\n\nIn filing court documents in her ongoing custody and child support battle with Nas, Kelis revealed that she brought in $922,840 from her entertainment and touring company, MyKnight, Inc., and her food product business, Feast Enterprises, according to The Blast. She also reported that she holds $691,153.22 in her bank accounts and owns $1,374,000 in property.\n\nShe also reported that she only brought in $9,000 for music royalties in 2017. She made $21,000 in royalties in 2016.\n\nShe currently receives $8,000 a month in child support, but thinks she warrants more, as her monthly expenses top $25,000.\n\nKelis said in court documents that she spends $5,726 on her mortgage, $4,500 on child care, $1,1913 on groceries, $1,233 on dining out, $1,500 on laundry and cleaning and $1,728 on clothing. She reported that she spends $1,300 on private tutoring and $400 for a separate math tutor for their son, Knight.\n\nNas filed his own court documents earlier this month and stated that he spends nearly $77,000 each month.\n\nNas, 44, and Kelis, 38, married in 2005 and split in 2009 when she was seven months pregnant with Knight.\n\nReps for Kelis and Nas didn’t immediately get back to us."
