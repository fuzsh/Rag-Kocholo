        "text": "Months after his ex-wife Kelis claimed that he physically abused her during their relationship, rapper Nas took to social media on Thursday to address and deny the accusations.\n\nIn a series of lengthy Instagram posts, the “Illmatic” rapper called Kelis’ claims a “sad fictitious story” and accused her of being “verbally abusive” and “evil.”\n\n“Today i got a call from essence about my ex wife doing another sad fictitious story. Nothing surprises me anymore, including this,” he began in “part 1.” He added, “This is what your life has come to sis? Exploiting some people’s Real struggle and pain...just to get at me....to get attention ? Fame? Another fight against men? We are a human family and we should be better examples for our son.”\n\nOn the subject of Kelis’ abuse allegations, the rapper commented, “I do not beat women. I did not beat up my ex wife. Stop. You got beat up in court.”\n\nBack in April, in the midst of the couple’s ongoing custody battle and child support feud, Kelis alleged that her marriage to Nas involved “a lot of mental and physical abuse.” Nas’ drinking was a problem that often lead to violent incidents that he would not remember once sober again, she told Hollywood Unlocked.\n\nThe pair split up after five years of marriage in 2009, the year Kelis, whose full name is Kelis Rogers, also gave birth to their son Knight.\n\nNas went on to add, “The altercations you speak of are no more different from what most normal couples go thru, but your exaggerated version is UNJUST. Whenever one is constantly attacked the instinct is to restrain that person or defend yourself to prevent escalation. In hindsight now my advice to young men out there in a situation like that is to RUN at the very first sign of verbal abuse or physical.”\n\nThe former couple is still fighting over their now 7-year-old son, and is currently engaged in a legal battle over custody arrangements and child support—which Nas suggested was the real reason Kelis’ came forward with abuse allegations earlier this year. The rapper, real name Nasir Jones, has accused his co-parent of violating a custody order in April by not allowing him to see their child on Easter.\n\nNas wrote, “I’ve been going thru lawyers to stop you from this bullsh*t for years. I finally got our custody together to work with both our schedule thru court, while leaving court you tell me your gonna get me back for fighting to see my son and 3 weeks later you’re on camera doing an interview about ‘your truth’. Interesting timing.”\n\nNas’ seven-part Insta-rebuttal also includes allegations that Kelis herself was “verbally abusive” to his daughter from another relationship, painting his own picture of the troubled union. After admitting that he was not “the most faithful husband” and also immature, he accused his ex of being “a very jealous wife.” Kelis’ “mean spirited wrath” cost him valuable connections during his career, he claimed, later adding, “Not a single person in my life loved or could even stand you.”\n\nHe went on to assert that the “Milkshake” singer was physically abusive toward him, and recalled an incident during which she was allegedly violent toward him while their son was watching.\n\n“After 10 years of keeping my silence during a decade of dealing with very hostile behavior and verbal abuse and even your stepfather holding you back from one of your physical violent Attacks on me right outside your house THIS YEAR while trying to pick up our son while he watched from the window, it was my weekend and you denied me that because your parents were in town. I just went home. This has been my life for my son’s entire life,” Nas wrote.\n\nThe MC wrapped up his lengthy letter by describing it as “MY TRUTH.”\n\n“And I don’t care what else she has left to say unless it concerns our son. This is the first and last time I’m addressing this. Despite all of this I still hope for the best for her because whats best for her is what’s best for Knight,” he wrote.\n\nKelis has yet to publicly comment on Nas’ many accusations. During her revealing interview with Hollywood Unlocked in April, the singer and cookbook author shared that seeing photos of Rihanna following the abuse she suffered at the hands of her then-boyfriend Chris Brown led her to consider going public with her own alleged abuse. She ultimately decided not to, however — until this year.\n\n“I’ve waited nine years to say anything. I have never talked about this man, ever,” Kelis told the outlet. “The amount of airing out that I could do, and I’ve chosen not to. Our kids will find out. They’re finding out now. I have never painted myself as a saint. Did he hit me? Mhm. Did I hit him back? Mhm.”\n\n[Photo: Kelis and Nas attend ‘Hip Hop Is Dead’ Nas album release party at Capitale in New York City on December 18, 2006. By Chance Yeh /Patrick McMullan via Getty Images]"
