        "text": "SINGER Kelis' husband Mike Mora sadly passed away following a battle with stomach cancer.\n\nMike posted in September 2021 that he was given 18 months and \"it's been exactly 12\". Here’s everything you need to know about his tragic passing...\n\nWho was Kelis' husband Mike Mora?\n\nMike was a 37-year-old photographer born in New York, United States.\n\nHe was very passionate about his occupation and learnt all the genres himself, such as fine art, portraits, lifestyle and many more.\n\nMike had his own website where selling his personalized photos and services, and his Instagram @mikemorafotos - which has over 11,000 followers - is full of his incredible snaps.\n\nHe married Kelis in 2014 and in 2018 the couple bought a farm with the plan to \"grow everything\".\n\nHow did Mike Mora die?\n\nMike passed away on Monday, March 14, 2022, following a battle with stage 4 stomach cancer.\n\nHe had been diagnosed with the cancer, also known as gastric adenocarcinoma.\n\nHe started to experience excruciating stomach pain in 2020, just after he and wife Kelis moved to a farm outside Los Angeles.\n\nHe described his symptoms as \"loss of appetite\" with \"pain in my back\".\n\nHe at first put his pain down to the hard work on the farm.\n\nMike took to Instagram on September 28, 2020, to explain how he \"finally decided to do something about it\" adding: \"It was a bit late. But just in time.\"\n\nMora explained how the doctors diagnosed him with the most advanced form of stomach cancer.\n\nHe said: \"I thought the whole time that I just had an ulcer. With no idea what was about to come my way.\n\n\"Here I was, in a hospital bed, during the middle of the pandemic. All alone.\"\n\nHe explained that he was posting about his diagnosis to encourage people not to take anything for granted.\n\nHe said: “At just 36, with 3 kiddos, and a wife that loves me.\n\n\"I want to be able to help those that might be experiencing something like this - a life altering disease full of questions and doubt - maybe, hopefully. By showing that it’s possible to make it through.\n\n\"I was told people with my disease, in this phase, didn't make it past 18 months. It's been exactly 12.\"\n\nHe added: “You always see people post about how life is too short. How you should reach out to those you love no matter where life has taken you.\n\n\"It is the truth. Don’t take your time here, your time with friends, family, for granted.”\n\nHow many children do Mike Mora and Kelis have?\n\nKelis and Mike have been married since 2014.\n\nIn September 2020, they welcomed their second child, a daughter named Galilee.\n\nThey also have a five-year-old son named Sheperd, who was born in 2015.\n\nKelis shares a 12-year-old son, Knight, with her former ex-husband Nas.\n\nIs Kelis dating Bill Murray?\n\nThe Sun exclusively revealed on Thursday that the Hollywood superstar Bill Murray and the Milkshake singer have struck up an unlikely romance - with an almost 30 year age gap between them.\n\nThe Ghostbusters actor, 72, watched the mum of three, 43, perform from the side of the stage in London last weekend - having also been spotted at her other recent shows.\n\nSources say the pair were also together at the same hotel, and have been “getting close for a while” after first meeting in the US.\n\nThey have reportedly bonded since Mike Mora's passing, while Bill’s estranged wife passed away in 2021.\n\nFather-of-six Bill was pictured during Kelis’s set at the Mighty Hoopla festival in Brockwell Park, South London.\n\nA friend said: “They’ve met up in the States before which got people in the industry talking, and now are meeting up in London while they’re both here. They’ve clearly hit it off.\n\n“But they’ve also both shared relatively recent bereavements and have that common bond between them.\n\n“Whatever it is that has brought them together, and however unlikely it seems, they are both single and are having fun despite the fairly big age gap.”"
