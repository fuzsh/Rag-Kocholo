        "text": "SHE famously sang about bringing all the boys to the yard but, in recent years, Kelis’ sanctuary has been a farmyard.\n\nThe native New Yorker, 43, who said she “hated living in LA”, moved to a remote Californian farm in 2020 with husband Mike Mora and her three children, swapping Millkshake for milking cows.\n\nThe 24-acre plot has become even more of a haven since Mike's heartbreaking death from stomach cancer in March last year, at the age of 37.\n\nIt’s a tragedy made all the more poignant by Kelis’ troubled past. She'd found happiness again after her marriage to rapper Nas when she was seven months pregnant with their son, claiming he was \"abusive\".\n\nNow it seems she may have found romance again, amid reports she has grown close to A-list actor Bill Murray.\n\nThe Ghostbusters star, 72, watched the mum of three, 43, perform from the side of the stage in London last weekend - having also been spotted at her other recent shows.\n\nSources say the pair were also together at the same hotel, and have been “getting close for a while”.\n\nAlthough currently on tour, Kelis is never happier than when she’s at home on her huge estate with kids Knight, 14, Shepherd, eight, and Galilee, two.\n\n\"I moved to the farm and we wanted to separate ourselves from all the silly things that had us stressed out and worried and angst and all these things that didn't really matter,\" she told People magazine.\n\nHere we look at how the Caught Out There singer came through a rocky start and turbulent marriage to find peace at her Californian hideaway.\n\nRoyalties rip off\n\nBorn Kelis Rogers, the daughter of a jazz musician and fashion designer, the singer shot to fame aged 19 in 1999 with the album Kaleidoscope and the barn-storming single Caught Out There, which shot into the top 10.\n\nBoth the debut album, which landed her a Best Breakthrough Act Brit in 2001, and the follow-up Wanderland were produced by then-friends Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, known as the Neptunes.\n\nWhile she was told the royalties would be split three ways, she later claimed she made no money at all from the recordings, alleging she was “blatantly lied to and tricked” by \"The Neptunes, management and lawyers”.\n\nShe said revenue from touring meant the discrepancy went unnoticed for a while, telling The Guardian: “Just the fact that I wasn’t poor felt like enough.”\n\nShe parted ways with the producers for her third album, Tasty, which also spawned her 2003 smash hit Milkshake.\n\nAbuse claims\n\nAt 22, Kelis met rapper Nas at the MTV Video Awards and he told her “I've wanted to make you my wife for years”. She replied, “Good, cos that's what I wanna be.”\n\nThe pair wed in January 2005, becoming second only to Jay-Z and Beyonce as music's ultimate power couple, but Kelis filed for divorce four years later, when she was seven months pregnant with their son, Knight.\n\nShe later claimed the marriage was violent and that he cheated on her.\n\n“I was really naive, I was madly in love and so I took a lot that I shouldn’t have taken, and generally just it’s not in my character at all, so it was just all awkward,” she told Hollywood Unlocked.\n\n“We had really intense highs and really intense lows. It was never normal.\n\nWe had really intense highs and really intense lows. It was never normal\n\nKelis\n\n“We were young. But I was 22 when I met him. I was a baby. We were drinking too much, smoking too much. We were too much. We were spending too much. We were balling too much. We were living too hard. So when that comes down, it goes really low. There’s no balance, there’s no normalcy.”\n\nShe added: “It was really dark. A lot of drinking. A lot of mental and physical abuse and it got to the point where if I wasn’t pregnant, I might have stayed with him. I really did love him. We were married -we weren’t dating, we were married, this was my person.”\n\nShe says seeing pictures of Rihanna's beaten face after she was attacked by Chris Brown in 2009 spurred her to flee the marriage.\n\nShe says at the time she had “bruises all over my body” and told The Guardian: “It just woke me up. thought, you know, I can endure a lot, but I’m not prepared to bring someone else into this. So I’m done.”\n\nNas strongly denied the allegations, claiming Kelis was trying to “slander” him because of a bitter custody battle over Knight.\n\nHe told Billboard: “I do not beat women. I did not beat up my ex-wife.”\n\nIn 2010, Nas was ordered to pay his ex £40,000 a month in child support but ten years later, Kelis took him to court over unpaid fees and a judge ruled he owed £240,000 in back payments.\n\nShe also claimed he was not spending enough time with his son, saying: \"He doesn't participate. He shows up when it's fun, he shows up when there's a good photo-op... I don't think it should be 50/50 just because you had sperm involved.”\n\nNew love\n\nKelis married photographer Mike Mora in 2014 and their son, Shepherd, was born a year later.\n\nIn 2020 the couple decided to fulfil a long-held dream to move to the country, buying a remote 24 acre farm nestled among the vineyards of Colombo, California.\n\n“I hate LA. I was only ever there for work,” she explained. “It’s not like New York or London, there’s nowhere to go after 10 at night, so suddenly you’re getting up early in the mornings and you’re juicing and you’re hiking and figuring out how much wheatgrass can you actually intake. I hate it.\n\n“So I thought, if I’m going to be in California, I should be where I can appreciate how beautiful it really is, not stuck in LA and pretending it’s a city that’s fun.”\n\nA city girl all her life, she admits she had little clue what she was doing.\n\nAt one point Knight, then 11, told her he’d seen “a foot hanging out of a sheep’s butt” and Kelis, who was unaware the ewe was pregnant, had to be talked through the birth by her vet sister while wearing a bin bag as a rubber glove.\n\nFarm life held many more surprises for the rookie.\n\n“I came out here with a completely different idea of what was going to happen. I thought I was going to be cute. I really thought I was going to have cute farm things, and I was going to be cute,” she told Harper’s Bazaar. “That is not the case.”\n\nShe admits she had a “full-on panic,” in the first month and questioned: “What have I done?”\n\nKelis used YouTube videos to learn how to care for the 30 animals on the farm - named after idols like Marvin Gaye, Whitney Houston, and Huey P. Newton.\n\nShe cultivated a vegetable garden, where she grows kale, broccoli, herbs, carrots, tomatoes, strawberries, blueberries, eggplant, lettuce, rocket and peppers.\n\nShe also has a citrus grove and olive trees, from which she presses her own olive oil, and says she loves the idea of food to table living, saying everything tastes better “because we grew it here - literally with sunshine and water and lots of prayer and positive thoughts”.\n\nA trained Cordon Bleu chef, who set up her own food and wellness brand, Bounty and Full, in 2015, Kelis says eating well became even more crucial to her during her third pregnancy in 2020.\n\nAfter settling into farm life, she told the Guardian she loved to see her two boys playing outside, getting dirty and climbing trees, and says the farm is an important legacy.\n\nShe said she wanted all three children “to be able to say: ‘I belong here. I own this. It’s mine, I want them to have the proper understanding of what wealth is'”.\n\nTragic loss\n\nIn September 2021, just as their daughter Galilee turned one, Mike revealed he had been diagnosed with stage four stomach cancer and had 18 months to live.\n\nThe couple tried every treatment available, including hyperbaric oxygen chambers and ozone therapy - which pumps oxygen into the body - but he sadly died in March 2022.\n\n“It wasn’t something that was sudden. We were able to prepare, and love, and say goodbye,” she told People, six months later.\n\n“We were able to spend the time that we needed to, as much as we were given, the best way that we could. Is it a great situation? No, it’s freaking awful, but I am grateful.”\n\nShe added: “It was out of our hands from the beginning. We’re just grateful for what we had. It’s part of life.”\n\nThis March, on the first anniversary of his death, Kelis posted an emotional message about her grief.\n\n\"It's been exactly a year… that's crazy to me. I'm a very private person generally, especially when there is family involved,” she wrote.\n\n“But there is no denying the impact and evolution my husband's passing has had on my life.\"\n\nCurrently far away from home in London, Kelis seems to be finding solace with funnyman Bill Murray.\n\nBut she’ll no doubt be hankering after the stunning scenery of her Californian bolthole."
