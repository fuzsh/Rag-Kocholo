        "text": "Photo Credit: Shareif Ziyadat/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, singer Kelis accused her ex-husband and rapper Nas of being physically abusive during their four year relationship. While Nas denied the allegations, he never fully addressed the claims Kelis made against him – until now.\n\nThe Queensbridge rapper went on a social media rant last night (Sept. 6) after receiving a call from Essence magazine telling him they are considering running an in-depth story about Kelis’ alleged physical abuse. The rant came in the form of seven all black Instagram posts accompanied by captions that tells the couple’s story from Nasir’s eyes.\n\nNas began telling his story by saying, “The Price i Pay To See My Son. And apologies in advance for the typos as I am speaking from the heart as a man who has had enough. Today i got a call from essence about my ex-wife doing another sad fictitious story. Nothing surprises me anymore, including this.”\n\nThe Grammy-nominated MC spoke directly to his ex as he demanded her to question everything she’s ever said or done since their divorce.\n\n“Why did i have to take you to court to see our son? Why when i win the joint custody (which is a win for both of us and our son, it helps us with both our schedules) why do you feel thats an attack on you? Is it control ? Why do you need to have control over my life? because we’re not together? Then why? Is this being rewarded and praised by people who are being taken advantage of by you and your lies? To all separated couples out there who are cordial and co parent nicely GOOD FOR YOU. I wish that was me. I’m the most chill cool parent there is. Who has time to argue ? About what? It’s about our little guy. You haven’t had to deal with what I’ve been dealing with. Trust me.”\n\nNas has clearly had a lot on his mind, and he’s not coy about sharing the details."
