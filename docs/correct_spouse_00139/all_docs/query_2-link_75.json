        "text": "Back in 2009, when she was seven months pregnant, singer Kelis famously announced she was divorcing her husband rapper Nas.\n\nIn an explosive interview with Hollywood Unlocked, Kelis claims at the same time Chris Brown was arrested for beating Rihanna, she was covered in bruises from her own beating from Nas. “It was really dark. There was a lot of drinking. There was a lot of mental and physical abuse,” Kelis told Hollywood Unlocked CEO Jason Lee on Thursday, April 26. “I probably would have stayed longer had I not been pregnant [with Knight] because I really did love him and because we were married. We weren’t dating, we were married. Like, this was my person.”\n\nKelis claims she endured the abuse for years before finally deciding to leave.\n\n“I’ve waited nine years to say anything. I have never talked about this man, ever,” she explained. “The amount of airing out that I could do, and I’ve chosen not to … Our kids will find out. They’re finding out now. I’ve never painted myself as a saint. Did he hit me? Mhm [hmm] Did I hit him back? Mhm [hmm]”"
