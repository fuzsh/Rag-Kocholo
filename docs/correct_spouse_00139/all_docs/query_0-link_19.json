        "text": "The couple experienced a very public divorce, one that the rapper admits bothered him at times.\n\n\"There were times when it didn’t bother me, and there were times when it bothered me a lot. There were times when I was thinking, 'Damn. I had this s--t all planned out, and now I’ve failed.' That was hard on me, because I don’t like to fail at anything. Accepting that I failed at this relationship — and it was public — messed me up. You ask yourself, 'How could that person be so cold?' And I’m sure she felt the same way about me. It was ugly.\"\n\nDespite their nasty break up, Nas says their relationship is a lot better now and Kelis even allows him to see his son a lot more often. Through it all, he says that he still doesn't hate Kelis but their was a time when he did question their relationship.\n\n\"I got to a point where I was like, 'Did she always hate me?' and 'Did she ever love me at all?' I’ve got to admit, I did feel like that. But she did love me,\" he explains. \"A lot of divorces are bad because a woman is just being vindictive. She’s not after the money, she just wants you to hurt the way she was hurt.\"\n\nFinancially, Nas says he's also cool with the amount of money the court has ordered him to shell out to his wife.\n\n\"It’s f----d up when money’s involved in divorce,\" said Nas. \"And I don’t give a f--k. I can’t take it with me, so someone can take the money. Anyone that I’m married to, if I give you my life, I give you my heart, I love you — my money is nothing. You can have it all. It’s just sad that when you’re dealing with love and life and marriage, that marriage is a contract. It’s a business deal. That messes people up.\"\n\nAlthough he appears to be very zen about the whole ordeal with his ex-wife, Nas says he's in no rush to get married again.\n\n\"I’m enjoying life and looking at each day like, 'This is beautiful,'\" he said. \"I’m having a good time. I’m not going to bring anybody in to mess that up. You come around looking like you’re going to mess this good time up, you’re out of here — fast. [Laughs.] I’m not sacrificing my happiness for nobody and their drama. No way.\"\n\nBET.com is your #1 source for Black celebrity news, photos, exclusive videos and all the latest in the world of hip hop and R&B music."
