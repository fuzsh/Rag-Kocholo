        "text": "Love is in the air, Bill Murray and Kelis Rogers are Hollywood's newest couple. The renowned actor and singer started dating and have been spending quality time together.\n\nRecently, Murray, 72, attended two of Rogers' events in London, posing for a backstage selfie with her after at least one of them. Not only that but they were sighted at the same London hotel and had grown closer since meeting in the United States (US).\n\nAs per TMZ, The 43-year-old Rogers and Murray became friends after the deaths of their respective partners. Murray's former wife died in 2021 and Rogers' second spouse in March 2022.\n\nAccording to a source in a report, whatever brought them together, and however implausible it appears, they are both single and having fun despite their very huge age difference. Also, reportedly the couple was staying at the same hotel and have been pretty close since their first meeting in the US.\n\nFather-of-six Murray was photographed during Rogers' act at Brockwell Park in South London's Mighty Hoopla event. Backstage, the couple also posed for a cute photo. Another friend stated that they previously met in the US, which sparked the news of their dating in the sector, and now they're meeting in London while they were both here together.\n\nWho Is Kelis Rogers?\n\nAmerican singer, songwriter, and chef Kelis Rogers is better known by her stage name, Kelis. In 1999, she made her debut with the album Kaleidoscope, which was influenced by 1970s jazz music. The record was a triumph, earning her her first gold certification. Among her most successful hits are Bossy and Milkshake. She has worked with a variety of performers, including Calvin Harris, Busta Rhymes, and Enrique Iglesias. Kelis was motivated to pursue music by her mother, Eveliss Rogers, a fashion designer.\n\nImage Credit: TMZ"
