        "text": "There’s officially no more milkshake in Nas and Kelis‘ marriage.\n\nCourt filings show a judge on Friday dissolved the union between singer Kelis Rogers and rapper Nas, whose full name is Nasir Jones. No other details were revealed.\n\nRogers, best known for her feisty tune “Milkshake,” filed for divorce last May, citing “irreconcilable differences.”\n\nJones, considered one of rap’s most popular artists, just released a collaborative album with reggae’s Damian Marley.\n\nDocuments show the couple married in July 2003. Jones was ordered in December to pay more than $51,000 a month to Rogers and their infant son.\n\nCalls to Jones’ attorney were not immediately returned. The office for Rogers’ attorney said she declined to comment.\n\n© 2010 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed."
