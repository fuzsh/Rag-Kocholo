        "text": "Back in April, Kelis alleged that Nas was physically abusive toward her during their five-year marriage that ended in 2009. When Nasir got wind that his ex-wife was moving forward with publishing another story — which he deemed “fictitious” — the Queensbridge native decided it was time to publicly respond to the allegations made by Kelis in a lengthy Instagram letter, where he detailed the anguish of the longstanding custody battle over his son and denied ever abusing women.\n\n“Today I got a call from Essence about my ex-wife doing another sad fictitious story. Nothing surprises me anymore, including this,” the 44-year-old began. “This is what your life has come to sis? Exploiting some people’s Real struggle and pain…just to get at me….to get attention? Fame? Another fight against men? We are a human family and we should be better examples for our son. Why is there even an issue for me to have time with my son? A son needs his father.”\n\nThe Illmatic rapper went on to claim that he’s had to deal with hostile behavior from his ex-wife, even this year. “After 10 years of keeping my silence during a decade of dealing with very hostile behavior and verbal abuse and even your stepfather holding you back from one of your physical violent Attacks on me right outside your house THIS YEAR while trying to pick up our son while he watched from the window, it was my weekend and you denied me that because your parents were in town,” he shared. “Even our son wonders why you treat me the way you do?”\n\nIn his sixth post, Nas emphatically addressed Kelis’ domestic violence claims, which he vehemently denies. “I do not beat women. I did not beat up my ex-wife. Stop. You got beat up in court… After all the tweets and posts you made thru the years disrespecting me and my family I still have love for you as the mother of my child BUT I am done with this,” Nas wrote.\n\n“This game ends now and GOD will be the judger of all this. And although you tell everyone GOD hates me (some Christian you are) I will survive and thrive from this moment because I know who I am & you have not a clue who you are,” he contests.\n\nThe rapper also said this would be the only time he would be addressing these allegations: “This is MY TRUTH. And I don’t care what else she has left to say unless it concerns our son. This is the first and last time I’m addressing this. Despite all of this I still hope for the best for her because what’s best for her is what’s best for [our nine-year-old son] Knight.”\n\nRead the rest of Nas’ posts directed at Kelis in full below."
