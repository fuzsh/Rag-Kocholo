        "text": "Nas is breaking his silence on Kelis’ allegations that he mentally and physically abused her during their six-year marriage.\n\nIn April, the “Milkshake” singer claimed that she suffered abuse during their relationship, which ended in April 2009. “It was dark. There was a lot of drinking. There was a lot of mental and physical abuse,” Kelis told Hollywood Unlocked. “God is so good because I probably would have stayed longer had I not been pregnant. I really did love him. We were married. We weren’t dating. This was my person…I did [feel like he was my soulmate] at the time.”\n\nNow, Nas is speaking out in a series of seven lengthy Instagram posts, where he confronts his ex-wife’s domestic abuse allegations and the ongoing custody battle over their 9-year-old son Knight. “This is the first and last time I’m addressing this,” he writes.\n\n“Today i got a call from essence about my ex wife doing another sad fictitious story,” he begins. “This is what your life has come to sis? Exploiting some people’s Real struggle and pain…just to get at me….to get attention? Fame? Another fight against men? We are a human family and we should be better examples for our son. Why is there even a issue for me to have time with my son. A son needs his father.”\n\nHe also claims that he endured “hostile behavior and verbal abuse” during their marriage, and says Kelis physically attacked him earlier this year. “After 10 years of keeping my silence during a decade of dealing with very hostile behavior and verbal abuse and even your stepfather holding you back from one of your physical violent Attacks on me right outside your house THIS YEAR while trying to pick up our son while he watched from the window, it was my weekend and you denied me that because your parents were in town. I just went home. This has been my life for my son’s entire life. Even our son wonders why you treat me the way you do?”\n\nIn part four of his open letter, he describes Kelis as “evil.” “Not a single person in my life loved or could even stand you,” he says. “Luckily for you our assistants all signed NDA’s or you would have a list of men and women who would happily talk about how verbally abusive and evil you are. Your self saboteur ways has caused you your grief your dealing with. Not me. The altercations you speak of are no more different from what most normal couples go thru, but your exaggerated version is UNJUST.\n\n“I herd you said terrible things about me. It makes me feel sad how heartless you can be. You play with strong women’s struggles like they mean nothing. You’re taking advantage of a moment in time where women who are fighting for their lives to get justice and be treated fairly & you just looked at it as an opportunity to get ahead. Like abuse is a game? Like tearing down your son’s father is a game. You have a son! Why are you still competing with me by telling him bad things about me.”\n\nHe goes on to reveal that he financially supported Kelis through rough times and that she has been unreasonable throughout the custody battle. “Let me say that I gave you the tools to be successful after you was dropped from your label. I paid for your cooking school cordon blue. The expensive yellow stove we had flown in from Europe. I helped pay for the remodeling of your house. Your assistant stole thousands from my cc according to Amex. Out of all people you should be completely understanding of my my grind. But you just can’t win with you. My schedule is CRAZY but you never help me see my son. I’m hardly allowed to talk to him on the phone. Ever.”\n\nIn part six, he denies the abuse allegations and says he is done with the games. “I do not beat women. I did not beat up my ex wife. Stop,” he says. “You got beat up in court. How much money do you want? Do you want me to relinquish my rights to see my son is that what you want? Just tell me. After all the tweets and posts you made thru the years disrespecting me and my family I still have love for you as the mother of my child BUT I am done with this. This game ends now and GOD will be the judger of all this.”"
