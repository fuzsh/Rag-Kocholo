        "text": "According to TMZ.com, The marriage between rapper Nas and R&B singer Kelis has officially been terminated by a Los Angeles judge. The divorce became official on Friday (May 21st) in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\n\nA number of issues remain unsolved, including the amount of custody and spousal support Nas has been ordered to pay Kelis.\n\nEarlier this month, Nas filed legal documents claiming that the judge based the amounts he must pay on him earning $152,000 a month, which the rapper says is “substantially less than that amount.”\n\nIn April, Nas paid over $87,000 in back spousal and child support to Kelis, in addition to the $10,000 a month he was ordered to pay going forward.\n\nNas and Kelis married in 2005 during a ceremony in Atlanta after a two year relationship.\n\nIn 2009, Kelis filed for divorce citing irreconcilable difference.\n\nThe rapper has accused Kelis of preventing him from seeing the birth of their son Knight in July of 2009, who was born just as the divorce proceedings started.\n\nHe also publicly accused Kelis of putting him through “hell” just to see his child during the divorce proceedings."
