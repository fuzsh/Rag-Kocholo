        "text": "Mike Mora, the husband of singer Kelis, passed away shortly after announcing his stage 4 stomach cancer diagnosis on social media.\n\nA representative on Kelis's management team confirmed the tragic news to Entertainment Tonight on Monday in a statement that read, “Sadly, it's true that Mike Mora has passed away. We would ask all to respect Kelis and her family's privacy as of right now.”\n\nThe photographer's death comes after he first shared his diagnosis in a September 2021 post on social media. In the post he explained that it all started when he experienced “the worst pain” in his stomach which led to appetite loss and back pain before he decided to go get it checked out. “I thought the whole time that I just had an ulcer. With no idea what was about to come my way,” he explained. “Here I was, in a hospital bed, during the middle of the pandemic. All alone.”\n\nAfter seeing three specialists and undergoing an endoscopic biopsy, Mora was diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma or stomach cancer stage 4. Despite the diagnosis, Mora was optimistic about the future and hoped sharing his story would help others in similar situations. “I am posting this, after so much thought. not because I want people to feel bad or sorry for me and my family. I am posting this because life is full of the most unexpected situations,” he wrote. “I never thought this could happen to me. At just 36, with 3 kiddos, and a wife that loves me. I want to be able to help those that might experience something, maybe, hopefully. By showing that it’s possible to make it through.”\n\nMora continued, “I want to be able to help those that might be experiencing something like this- a life altering disease full of questions and doubt- maybe, hopefully. By showing that it’s possible to make it through. You always see people post about how life is too short. How you should reach out to those you love no matter where life has taken you. It is the truth. Don’t take your time here, your time with friends, family, for granted. Shit can be over just like that!”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
