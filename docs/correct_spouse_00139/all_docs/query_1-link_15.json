        "text": "Nas: I’ve Been Through A Lot But I Got Love For My Ex-Wife Kelis\n\nNas still has love for Kelis! Despite all they’ve been through, he revealed how he feels about her.\n\nNas explains,\n\n“I’ve been through a whole lot, and no one really gave me advice on how to deal with what I was going through with a broken family. I’m optimistic that things will get better. Certain things just have to develop into a better place. But I got love for my ex-wife.”\n\nHe also spoke on their relationship on “Beautiful Life”, a song on his “The Lost Tapes 2” album that was released in July.\n\nNas and Kelis tied the knot on January 8, 2005.\n\nWhile they were relationship goals for many, they went through an ugly breakup in 2009. The divorce was finalized in 2010. That was followed by an ugly custody battle for their son Knight, who is now 10.\n\nThat battle ended last month after the two agreed that Kelis would move with Knight to the west coast. They will both cover the costs of Knight traveling between the east and west coasts.\n\nThey have certainly come a long way since Kelis accused Nas of physically abusing her while they were together. He made a statement and said,\n\n“I didn’t wanna speak up because I have real respect for our women. And definitely my son. I do not beat women. I did not beat up my ex-wife. Stop. You got beat up in court. How much money do you want? Do you want me to relinquish my rights to see my son is that what you want? Just tell me. After all the tweets and posts you made thru the years disrespecting me and my family I still have love for you as the mother of my child BUT I am done with this.”\n\nIt’s good to see these two have gotten over the drama."
