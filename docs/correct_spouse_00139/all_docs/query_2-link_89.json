        "text": "In a new interview with Hollywood Unlocked‘s Jason Lee, singer and chef Kelis spilled a whole kettle full of piping hot, nine-year-old tea about not only what her relationship with ex-husband Nas was really like, but also what kind of father he’s been as they go through their custody battle.\n\nAnd while one might assume she shared everything out of spite, the 38-year-old was honest about the role she felt she played in their issues, and laughed about incidents that would that make the rest of us infuriated. But not an awkward, misplaced laugh. Instead, an “I’m so over this situation that to hear what I’ve dealt with is laughable at this point” type of giggle. Here’s what shocked us:\n\nTheir marriage was, at times, a violent one.\n\nKelis admitted that the couple “lived hard.” They drank a lot, smoked a lot, and when the rapper would get very drunk, he had moments where he was physically abusive.\n\n“It was dark. It was really dark,” she said. “There was a lot of drinking. A lot of mental and physical abuse and it got to the point where … I think, God is so good. Because being pregnant, I probably would have stayed longer had I not been pregnant.”"
