        "text": "Hip hop legend Nas is opening up about his much-publicized 2009 divorce from R&B star Kelis.\n\nIn an interview on MTV's \"RapFix Live\" Wednesday, the rapper told reporter Sway Calloway that it was \"hard to deal with people being all in your business... it was ugly. Divorce can be crazy.\"\n\nIn May 2009, Kelis -- then seven months pregnant -- filed to divorce Nas, citing \"irreconcilable differences\" and requesting child support for their unborn child. A month later, rumors of Nas' cheating picked up steam when Kelis posted a series of tweets about infidelity.\n\nNas was reportedly ordered to pay $40,000 a month in spousal and child support in July 2009, though MTV reports that the amount was reduced to $25,000 a month last year. The rapper also has a daughter, Destiny, from a previous relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I [wound] up paying more money to baby mommas than what some of my rap brothers and sistren make,\" he said.\n\nKelis, who gave birth to the couple's son, Knight, a day after the initial child and spousal support ruling, has also commented on the split. In May 2011, the \"Milkshake\" singer told MSN Celebrity UK that she didn't regret her divorce from the rapper because it was a \"lesson that needed to be learned.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former couple married in July 2003, after two years of dating."
