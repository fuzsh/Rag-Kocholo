        "text": "The rumor mill has churned out another wild card celebrity romance: Bill Murray and Kelis.\n\nYes, you read that correctly. The 72-year-old Ghostbuster and 43-year-old milkshake maker are allegedly an item. The news was first reported by The Sun, which should always be taken with a grain of salt. But hey, this is the publication that first reported the Taylor Swift–Matty Healy romance, so you never know.\n\nAccording to the report, Murray was spotted at Kelis's Mighty Hoopla festival performance in Brockwell Park in south London on June 3. The actor proved to be a big fan by meeting up with Kelis postshow and snagging a quick pic (also featuring rapper Children of Zeus). If it were just one show, I'd guess that Murray is just a really big fan of “Milkshake,” but the actor has allegedly been spotted at other Kelis shows, though the timeline is unclear.\n\nDespite their 29-year age difference, both celebrities have been married twice and recently experienced the painful loss of a spouse. Kelis's second husband, Mik Mora, died of cancer in 2022, while Murray lost wife Jennifer Butler in 2021. Kelis is a mother of three, while Murray has six adult children, the oldest of whom is 41 years old.\n\nIt's unclear how Murray and Kelis first crossed paths, but a supposed “friend” said they met prior to being spotted together in London. “They’ve met up in the States before, which got people in the industry talking, and now are meeting up in London while they’re both here,” the source claimed. “They’ve clearly hit it off.”"
