The child will spend Mother’s Day with Kelis and Father’s Day with Nas, and they each get to celebrate their own birthday with the child.\n\nAs for the other holidays:\n\nKelis gets Halloween in even years, Nas gets odd.\n\nKelis gets July 4 in even years, Nas gets odd.\n\nKelis gets Summer Break in odd years, Nas gets even.\n\nKelis gets Thanksgiving in odd years, Nas gets even.\n\nKelis gets the child’s birthday in odd years, Nas gets even\n\nThe report claims that the judge is yet to decide on the matter."
