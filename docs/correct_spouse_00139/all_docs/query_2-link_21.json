        "text": "Nas has confessed to sending his former wife Kelis texts urging her to “make love to me one last time”.\n\nThe New York rapper told fans at his intimate London show at Under The Bridge last night (October 1):\n\nYou know, I texted her the other night. I said, ‘Can we make love one more time?’ Seriously!\n\nHe went on to add that the break-up “still hurts bad. That pain is real, y’all. That shit is real”.\n\nThe remarks were made during a rendition of recent album track ‘Bye Bye Baby’, which is believed to be about the ‘Milkshake’ singer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNas and Kelis were married for five years before splitting in May 2010. The hip-hop star has since been open about the split and famously appeared on the cover of his latest album, ‘Life Is Good’, holding his estranged wife’s wedding dress.\n\nHis relationship with Kelis, which began in 2002 after the pair met at an MTV Video Music Awards party, sparked a longstanding row with rival rapper Jay-Z, who had previously been romantically linked to the singer.\n\nNas is currently in London hosting a ‘takeover’ trio of intimate shows. He performs tonight (October 2) at London Village Underground and tomorrow (October 3) at London XOYO.\n\nRecommended"
