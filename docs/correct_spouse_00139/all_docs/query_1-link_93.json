Today (Sept 7th), Nas took to Instagram and expressed the details of him and Kelis’ irreconcilable differences through a seven-part series of posts. Nas admitting to paying to be able to see his son, as well as Kelis being verbally abusive and jealous of his daughter who he raised to be a strong young woman. Nas even went as far as letting fans know he has lost many producers, writers, attorney’s and record executives because of Kelis and almost lost his close friends and business partners, Steve Stoute and Anthony due to her hostile jealous antics. See all of Nas’ Instagram posts below.\n\n”"
