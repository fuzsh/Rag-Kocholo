VP Harris gets his nod\n\nJuly 21, 2024 at 7:27 pm\n\nSinger Kelis and rapper Nas finalize divorce in LA\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — There’s officially no more milkshake in Nas and Kelis’ marriage. Court filings show a judge on Friday dissolved the union between singer Kelis Rogers and rapper Nas, whose full name is Nasir Jones. No other details were revealed. Rogers, best known for her feisty tune “Milkshake,” filed for divorce last May, citing “irreconcilable differences.” Jones, considered one of rap’s most popular artists, just released a collaborative album with reggae’s Damian Marley. Documents show the couple married in July 2003. Jones was ordered in December to pay more than $51,000 a month to Rogers and their infant son. Calls to Jones’ attorney were not immediately returned. The office for Rogers’ attorney said she declined to comment.\n\nOriginally Published: May 26, 2010 at 9:54 a.m."
