        "text": "Kelis has claimed that Nas currently owes her money and ruled out a reconciliation with her ex-husband.\n\nResponding to a social media user who urged the former couple to “double back” and “give love another chance,” the singer quickly shot down hopes that they would get back together.\n\n“Stop, it was 15 years ago. Do you want your ex from almost 2 decades ago?” she replied in an Instagram comment.\n\nAfter another commenter said: “Give Nas his bread back,” Kelis responded: “Lol he owes me actually, get outta here, only a loser is worried about someone else’s money lol please.”\n\nKelis and Nas had a very bitter divorce in 2010 that signaled the end of their seven-year marriage.\n\nShe later detailed their tumultuous relationship and accused the rap legend of physical abuse.\n\n“We had like really intense highs and really intense lows,” she told Hollywood Unlocked in 2018. “It was never normal. The intense high would be like money was rolling in.\n\n“We were young, too. I was 22 when I met him. I was a baby. We were drinking too much, smoking too much. We were too much. We were spending too much. We were balling out of control. It was all just too much.”\n\nShe added: “We lived hard and so because of that, when that comes down, it goes really low — as low as possible. So it’s hard ’cause there’s no balance. There’s no normalcy.”\n\n“It was really dark,” Kelis continued. “There was a lot of drinking and a lot of mental and physical abuse. We would fight. I never just sat there but we would definitely fight.\n\n“I’ve waited nine years to say anything. The amount of airing out I could do — and I’ve chosen not to — our kids will find out. They’re finding out now. I’ve never painted myself as a saint. Did he hit me? Mmmhm. Did I hit him? Mmmhm.\n\nNas later addressed the allegations in a lengthy Instagram post, writing: “I’m tired of you painting a bad picture of me. I’ve been tired of it but you never seem to get tired. I even had to be in a relationship with you AGAIN after we separated just so i could see my son & I AM JUST TIRED.\n\n“Back then you asked me why didn’t i stop the divorce from happening. I tried! We are too different. Some things aren’t meant to be. We were meant to be so that we could have our son. Nothing more.”"
