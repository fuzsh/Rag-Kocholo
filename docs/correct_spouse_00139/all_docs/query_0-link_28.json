        "text": "Kelis gets candid about the passing of her husband Mike Mora in a recent video. The 43-year-old opened up on Instagram on Tuesday (March 14), which was also the one-year anniversary of Mora’s passing.\n\nShe shared the video addressing the father of her children’s death for the first time.\n\nRELATED: Kelis’ Husband Mike Mora Passes Away At 37 After Battle With Stomach Cancer\n\nKelis Opens Up 1-Year After Husband’s Passing\n\nThe “Milkshake” singer took to Instagram to explain that her wellness journey started many years ago when she first became a mother. However, her husband became sick with stage 4 stomach cancer in 2021. This prompted her to do more research about the different ways her family could improve their habits.\n\n“My husband Mike got sick, this was a couple years ago … he was diagnosed stage four stomach cancer. It was just such a shock. We eat well, we lived on the farm already … so we were already eating well, and really focused on what we put in our bodies.”\n\nKelis added that she and her husband learned about ozone therapy, a practice that administers ozone gas into the body to treat wounds and diseases, as reported by Healthline. However, his tumor returned and spread throughout his body.\n\nKelis Says She’s A Private Person, Talks Impact Of Mike Mora’s Death\n\nThe mother of three revealed that she moved to a farm, reportedly located in Los Angeles, to separate herself and her family from the “silly things” that can cause anxiety but doesn’t deny the impact of her husband’s passing on her life.\n\nFurthermore, the singer shared an encouraging message to followers, emphasizing that health is something they can “take control of.” The 34-year-old also shared the video with a caption, further delving into her reflections.\n\n“It’s been exactly a year… that’s crazy to me. I’m a very private person generally, especially when there is family involved. But there is no denying the impact and evolution my husbands passing has had on my life. I get asked all the time how I started this journey. It’s a much longer conversation but in short what we were dealing with here pushed me so deep into understanding our bodies and how our minds and emotions are so interlocked you can not treat one with out the other. Our thoughts and intentions are as powerful and key as our skin health and fitness . I want to live well and this is me sharing what I know to be true.”\n\nMike Mora Passed Away At The Age Of 34\n\nAs The Shade Room previously reported, Mike Mora passed away on March 14, 2022, at the age of 34. Kelis’ management team confirmed the news in a statement shared exclusively with Entertainment Tonight.\n\n“Sadly, it’s true that Mike Mora has passed away. We would ask all to respect Kelis and her family’s privacy as of right now. Thank you.”\n\nAs The Shade Room previously reported, Mora opened up about his stage 4 stomach cancer diagnosis in October 2021.\n\nAdditionally, he shared that his doctor diagnosed him with 18 months to live."
