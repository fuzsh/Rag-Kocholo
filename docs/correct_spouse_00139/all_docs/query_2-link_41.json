        "text": "During an interview with Hollywood Unlocked on Thursday, Kelis—who broke out in 2003 with her hit song “Milkshake”—claimed that she was physically abused during her marriage to rapper Nas.\n\n“It was dark. It was really dark,” she told host Jason Lee. “There was a lot of drinking. There was a lot of physical and mental abuse. And it just got to the point where . . . God is so good, because being pregnant—I probably would have stayed longer had I not been pregnant. Because I really did love him and we were married. This was my person.”\n\nKelis relayed how she met Nas when she was 22 and he was 28; they got married shortly after. Kelis filed for divorce in 2009, citing irreconcilable differences, while she was seven months pregnant with their son.\n\n“Did he hit me? Mhmm. Did I hit him back? Mhmm,” she continued. “He would black out. He would drink too much. He drank way too much. He will never admit it . . . so a lot of the stuff he may not remember.”\n\nKelis cited Rihanna’s publicized domestic-violence dispute with Chris Brown in February 2009 as a crossroads moment in her own relationship, ultimately deciding that she “wasn’t ready to walk” and discuss the alleged abuse.\n\n“Seeing [Rihanna] and the way she looked, and then looking at myself, I was embarrassed,” she said. “I don’t know that situation, but for me it was just like, ‘You’re gonna let this stuff go? You’re not going to say anything?’ He knew it. I knew it. We were both like, ‘Are you going to do it?’ I didn’t want that to be my career, honestly.”"
