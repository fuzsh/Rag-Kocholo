        "text": "Synopsis\n\nRumours are rife that Milkshake singer Kelis, 43, has got together with actor Lost in Translation actor Bill Murray, 72. Here’s how fans are reacting.\n\nHollywood has recently been rocked with the news of senior citizen actors Robert De Niro and Al Pacino becoming dads again through their much younger female partners. There is also Titanic actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who usually dates very young women, and was again in the news for reportedly having a thing for Neelam Gill, a 28-year-old Indian-origin model.\n\nAnd now, there are rumours of veteran actor Bill Murray, 72, dating 43-year-old singer Kelis. The two were spotted at the Mighty Hoopla festival in London last weekend. They are posing in one picture with Konny Kon from the music duo Children of Zues, at the Cross The Tracks festival.\n\nThere are reports by The Sun and Daily Mail that Bill Murray and Kelis have been spotted several times together recently, meeting up in the US and London, UK.\n\nIs Kelis married? Does she have children?\n\nIn a tragedy, Kelis' husband Mike Mora died from stage four stomach cancer in March 2022, at the age of 37. The singer has three children, and was earlier married to ex-rapper Nas.\n\nIs Bill Murray married and does he have children?\n\nBill Murray has been married twice and has six sons. He split from his second wife Jennifer Butler in 2008. She passed away in January 2021.\n\nKelis’ fans react\n\nFans are not too happy with the much older man dating Kelis and reacted on social media. One fan wrote, “That came from outta nowhere!”, while the other said, “You could sit me in a room until the heat death of the universe with the incomplete sentence ‘Singer Kelis, 43, is dating...’ written down and at no point would it even occur to me to end it like this.”\n\nA fan said on Twitter: “Didn’t expect her milkshake to bring this boy to the yard,” as a reference to Kelis’ hit song Milkshake.\n\n“Kelis caught a Ghostbuster,” said another fan, as a reference to Murray’s movie Ghostbusters.\n\nAnother fan wrote, “This was NOT on my 2023 bingo card.” Yet another shocked fan reacted, “Kelis and WHOMST?!”\n\nFAQS\n\nQ1:What is Bill Murray’s net worth?\n\nAs of 2023, Bill Murray’s net worth has been reported as US$180 million.\n\nQ2:What is Kelis’ net worth?\n\nKelis’s net worth is US$4 million, as of 2023.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
