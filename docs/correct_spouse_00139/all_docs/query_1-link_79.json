No other details were revealed.\n\nRogers, best known for her feisty tune “Milkshake,” filed for divorce last May, citing “irreconcilable differences.”\n\nJones, considered one of rap’s most popular artists, just released a collaborative album with reggae’s Damian Marley.\n\nDocuments show the couple married in July 2003. Jones was ordered in December to pay more than $51,000 a month to Rogers and their infant son.\n\nCalls to Jones’ attorney were not immediately returned. The office for Rogers’ attorney said she declined to comment."
