        "text": "Nas has finally spoken out about his ongoing issues with his ex-wife Kelis. On Thursday (September 6), the \"Simple Things\" rapper took to Instagram to air out all of his thoughts about his ex after he found out Essence was planning to do a story on her abuse allegations against him.\n\nIn April, Kelis accused the rapper of abusing her throughout their four-year marriage. \"There was a lot of mental and physical abuse and it got to the point where I probably would have stayed longer had I not been pregnant because I really did love him and because we were married,\" she said in an interview with Hollywood Unlocked.\n\nIn Nas' seven-part Instagram statement, he refuted nearly all of Kelis' claims, accusing his ex-wife of not allowing him to see their nine-year-old son Knight Jones, verbally abusing his daughter Destiny, physically abusing him, and lying about her abuse claims.\n\n\"I shouldn’t have ignored the signs from your your first song and video I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW,\" he wrote before recalling how their relationship began. \"But I thought you was beautiful. You came into my life at a time i was grieving from my moms passing. You was a friend. Because of that i wanted to marry you. And i did. And we had a big lavish wedding. Overall there was too many good times. I have to say i wasn’t the most faithful husband. I was immature. I’m sorry about that. But you bumped your own head sis.\"\n\nHe added, \"Why do i have to live thru a constant divorce? It didn’t work out. Life goes on. I’m not coming back to you. Your married and im happy for you and I’m a extremely happy black brother out here trying to make a difference [...].\"\n\nNas then alleged that Kelis attacked him earlier this year when he came to pick up Knight from her house while the nine-year-old watched from the window. Adding, \"it was my weekend and you denied me that because your parents were in town. I just went home. This has been my life for my son’s entire life. Even our son wonders why you treat me the way you do?\"\n\nThe \"Not For Radio\" rapper additionally claimed that he has gone to great lengths to see his son, including getting back together with Kelis at one point. However, he said he is \"just tired,\" and wants to just see his son regularly.\n\n\"You make up this image of me that’s not true but it’s funny because it’s really you describing yourself,\" he continued. \"You made up stories about me and claimed i did things that YOU DID.\"\n\n\"You play with strong women’s struggles like they mean nothing. You’re taking advantage of a moment in time where women who are fighting for their lives to get justice and be treated fairly & you just looked at it as an opportunity to get ahead. Like abuse is a game,\" he wrote. \"Like tearing down your son’s father is a game. You have a son! Why are you still competing with me by telling him bad things about me. Guess what sis, he has eyes and ears and smart as ever. i don’t have to say anything. I think he knows what’s really good. You will NOT stop me from fighting for my son.\"\n\nAfter claiming he gave Kelis the \"tools to be successful,\" including paying for her culinary school and remodeling her house, Nas ended his statement by saying, \"I do not beat women. I did not beat up my ex wife.\"\n\n\"This is MY TRUTH,\" he wrote. \"And I don’t care what else she has left to say unless it concerns our son. This is the first and last time I’m addressing this. Despite all of this I still hope for the best for her because whats best for her is what’s best for Knight.\"\n\nPhoto: Getty Images"
