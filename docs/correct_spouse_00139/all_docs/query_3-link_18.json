        "text": "Mike Mora, who is the husband of singer Kelis had died after a battle with stomach cancer.\n\nThe photographer was diagnosed with stage 4 stomach cancer in September 2021, and was given eighteen months to live.\n\nKelis' representatives confirmed the heartbreaking news in a statement, and asked fans for their respect and privacy during this devastating time.\n\n\"Sadly, it’s true that Mike Mora has passed away,\" Steve Satterhwaite, of Red Light Management, said to ET.\n\n\"We would ask all to respect Kelis and her family's privacy as of right now. Thank you,\" the statement ended.\n\nMike opened up about his battle with stomach cancer in October on his own social media, chronically his journey in a series of Instagram posts.\n\nIn one detailed post in September he wrote, \"I am posting this, after so much thought. not because I want people to feel bad or sorry for me and my family. I am posting this because life is full of the most unexpected situations,\" he wrote in a separate post. \"I never thought this could happen to me. At just 36, with 3 kiddos, and a wife that loves me. I want to be able to help those that might experience something, maybe, hopefully. By showing that it’s possible to make it through\".\n\n\"I want to be able to help those that might be experiencing something like this- a life altering disease full of questions and doubt- maybe, hopefully. By showing that it’s possible to make it through,\" he continued. \"You always see people post about how life is too short. How you should reach out to those you love no matter where life has taken you. It is the truth. Don’t take your time here, your time with friends, family, for granted. S**t can be over just like that!\" he added.\n\nMike and Kelis married in 2014 and have two children together - Sheperd who is six, and a daughter that was born in September 2020.\n\nOur condolences to his family and friends during this time."
