        "text": "These days, nothing surprises me about celebrities. I’ve come to understand they are human—just like everyone else. Still, every now and then, a little shock and surprise slips through the cracks—one being the violent streak embodied by Nasir Jones. With a somewhat scandal-free career, Nas is now in the hot seat as his ex-wife, Kelis tells it all.\n\nLike Jay and Bey, during Nas and Kelis’s courtship, they were couple goals for many. They were hip hop royalty, and everyone fell in love with her quirkiness mixed with this street vibe. From the outside looking in—they were the perfect couple. That was until they were suddenly no longer together. For nearly a decade, singer and celebrity chef, Kelis kept the details surrounding her divorce from the rap artist Nas private.\n\nNowadays, the Milkshake singer doesn’t feel the need to remain silent anymore. In a recent interview, Kelis spills the tea on why she divorced the Queens rapper while she was pregnant with their only child, Knight.\n\nAccording to Kelis, Nas was violent throughout their relationship. “There was a lot of mental and physical abuse. I was pregnant, and it was a mess and I felt like I wasn’t going to bring a child into this,” she told Hollywood Unlocked.\n\nKelis also admitted the rapper struggles with drinking—but also adds they both drank and got high a lot together. She tells HU that there were a lot of highs and lows to their relationship, overall making their union intense.\n\n“We had really intense highs and really intense lows. It was never normal. An intense high would be when money was rolling in. An intense low—we had a lot. It was really dark,” she continued.\n\nThe 38-year-old chef confessed she wanted to come out during the Chris Brown and Rihanna scandal, but due to her being private, she kept silent . According to her, at the time she had also been assaulted and bore the bruises all over her body. Kelis doesn’t hold back as she explains his abuse was why the custody battle for their 8-year-old became extremely controversial. She also adds how the rapper only shows up for a custody hearing when there is a photo opp.\n\n“A parent isn’t about showing up when you feel like it,” she said. “You can’t not show up for months and then show up and try to make up your own visitation schedule.”\n\nListen to the interview below."
