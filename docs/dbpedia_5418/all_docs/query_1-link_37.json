        "text": "Introduction\n\nDiagnosis of kidney disease is complex and requires multiple tools, including careful patient history collection, physical examination, laboratory, and imaging tests. Ideally, a final diagnosis is achieved without invasive procedures. However, many kidney diseases present in similar nonspecific clinical syndromes (e.g., nephrotic syndrome), and nephrologists often require a kidney biopsy to establish a diagnosis. Despite being the current diagnostic gold standard for most kidney diseases, kidney biopsy is a method with some limitations: there can be sampling error (i.e., the sample is not representative) and is only a single frame of a kidney disease that is often a dynamic pathologic process. In addition, kidney biopsies are invasive with a non-negligible rate of complications.1 Importantly, some clinical settings such as coagulation disorders or solitary kidney advise against performing kidney biopsies. Thus, in some patients, the benefit/risk ratio may be unfavorable. Kidney biopsy also requires technical expertise, which is not universally available. In these scenarios, clinicians must rely on other tools, such as urinary sediment (U-Sed) examination. This is a noninvasive procedure that may be performed by an automated analyzer or manually by a trained clinician. The former allows for the analysis of hundreds of samples a day, with reproducible results throughout, which in turn partially explains why the expertise on manual U-Sed reading has been fading. Still, manual U-Sed provides a wealth of information2 that automatic analyzers struggle to offer, namely distinguishing isomorphic from dysmorphic red blood cells, identifying renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs), lipids, crystals, and the composition of casts.3 Those shortcomings can be partly explained by the automated analyzer’s inability to integrate U-Sed findings with the clinical context. In centers with proficient manual U-Sed reading such as ours, physicians regularly perform urinalysis to determine if a kidney biopsy is of additional benefit. Albeit U-Sed rarely provides a final diagnosis in the same fashion as a kidney biopsy can, its noninvasive nature means it can be repeated at will. This is particularly appealing because it can elucidate clinical changes without requiring repeated kidney biopsy; for example, a patient with clinical remission of lupus nephritis will be deemed to have disease relapse in case of reemergence of dysmorphic hematuria. Findings in U-Sed reflect damage that is occurring within the kidney, which can be documented by kidney biopsy. This correlation has been explored to some degree in selected kidney diseases. Martinez evaluated only a few urine particles (erythrocytes, leukocytes, and casts) exclusively in lupus nephritis patients. Bobart investigated hematuria and the MEST-C histologic classification in IgA nephropathy. Yuan evaluated a more complete urinary particle profile but only analyzed endocapillary proliferative lupus nephritis and IgA.4 –6 Fogazzi took a wider approach by evaluating a complete urinary profile in patients with proliferative and nonproliferative glomerular diseases.7 However, proliferative glomerular diseases frequently share histologic features with nonproliferative ones. Using such a dichotomizing methodology means that the histologic information on the lesions (which cause urinary sediment particles to exist) may be blurred. Our study aims to take this a step further in the cross-analysis of U-Sed particles and kidney biopsy histologic lesions.\n\nWe investigated the prevalence of a complete profile of urinary sediment particles and determined its associations with histologic lesions seen on contemporary kidney biopsy, regardless of diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this broader systematic approach has been explored.\n\nResults\n\nFrom January 2018 to December 2021, 1152 manual U-Seds were performed in our institution. U-Sed was performed for 172 patients who also had a kidney biopsy. Of those, 41 were excluded from analysis: 20 were from kidney transplant patients, eight were not contemporary, five had insufficient tissue for interpretation, five histologic sets of slides were not available, and three had inadequate urine samples. We included 131 patients. Our population’s demographic and clinical data comprised mainly White patients, equally distributed among sexes, who presented with varying degrees of kidney dysfunction and/or proteinuria. Table summarizes the demographic and clinical data of patients at time of kidney biopsy.\n\nTable 1\n\nFeatureValueSex (men/women)55 (72)/45 (59)Age (yr)59.7 (46–72.8) Race White86 (113) Black10 (13) Other4 (5)Serum creatinine (mg/dl)2.24 (1.33–3.74)eGFR (ml/min per 1.73 m2)37.3±31.3Proteinuria (g per 24 h or uPRC g/g)2.8 (0.92–5)Diabetes12 (16)Patients with AKI31 (41)Patients with CKD27 (35)Patients with AKI on CKD42 (55)\n\nThe most frequent diagnoses were ANCA vasculitis (n=20; 15%), proliferative lupus nephritis (n=18; 14%), IgA nephropathy (n=18; 14%), FSGS (n=13; 10%), and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (n=10; 8%). The full list of histologic diagnosis can be found in Figure .\n\nIn our samples, we found an elevated frequency of findings suggestive of intrinsic kidney disease, such as dysmorphic hematuria (n=71; 54%), leukocyturia (n=62; 47%), RTECs (n=53; 41%), and lipiduria (n=45; 34%), and a low frequency of particles evoking urologic damage, such as isomorphic hematuria (n=29; 22%), and urothelial transitional cells (n=26; 10%).

Lipids were associated with mesangial expansion and hypercellularity, wire loops and/or hyaline deposits, and internal elastic lamina duplication; RTEC were associated with neutrophils and/or karyorrhexis, fibrinoid necrosis, wire loops and/or hyaline deposits, cellular and fibrocellular crescents, and acute tubular necrosis.\n\nWe further explored a multivariate model, which included a urinary profile model as a predictor for the histologic lesion outcomes: presence and type of casts, erythrocytes, leukocytes, RTECs, and lipids. We identified U-Sed characteristics independently associated with specific histologic findings, which are summarized in Table . Mesangial abnormalities (expansion and hypercellularity) were associated with the presence of lipids. Additionally, lipids were also associated with wire loops and/or hyaline deposits, as was the presence of RTECs. RTECs were also associated with endocapillary hypercellularity, fibrinoid necrosis, and the presence of cellular/fibrocellular crescents, and, as expected, acute tubular necrosis. Surprisingly, dysmorphic hematuria was not associated with glomerular inflammation when adjusting for the presence of RTECs, with only a trend toward association with the presence of cellular/fibrocellular crescents (odds ratio=3.19, P=0.06).\n\nTable 4\n\nHistologic Finding (Outcome)U-Sed Finding (Predictor)OR (95% Confidence Interval)P ValueMesangial expansionLipids2.86 (1.3 to 6.3)0.009Mesangial hypercellularityLipids2.44 (1.06 to 5.58)0.04Podocyte hypertrophyLipids0.97 (0.41 to 2.29)0.95Endocapillary hypercellularityRTECs3.17 (1.36 to 7.39)0.007Neutrophils and/or karyorrhexisRTECs4.51 (1.61 to 12.61)0.004Wire loops and/or hyaline depositsRTECs2.59 (0.99 to 6.8)0.05Lipids2.89 (1.13 to 7.37)0.03Fibrinoid necrosisLeukocytes2.72 (0.96 to 7.73)0.06RTECs4.35 (1.48 to 12.74)0.007Cellular/fibrocellular crescentsRTECs5.27 (1.95 to 14.26)0.001Dysmorphic hematuria3.19 (0.96 to 6.87)0.06Acute tubular necrosisRTECs2.31 (1.08 to 4.97)0.03\n\nThe associations between the histologic lesions and the presence of RTECs kept their statistical strength when controlling for the presence of acute tubular necrosis.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study evaluated the associations between a complete profile of urinary particles by manual microscopy, and histologic findings in patients who performed contemporary urinalysis and kidney biopsy. By focusing on histologic lesions instead of histologic diagnosis, our approach is less limiting and allows for direct analysis of each lesion with a complete urinary sediment profile. We found that the presence of some urinary particles, which are seldom reported by automated analyzers, is associated with active proliferative histologic lesions. These findings should be interpreted in context: this was a population of patients where proliferative kidney diseases represented 51% of the diagnoses (n=67). As such, the presence of RTECs probably reflects the ongoing inflammation and shedding of tubular cells. If the population were composed of patients with AKI after surgical cardiac intervention, the presence of RTECs would not have the same interpretation.\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of our population reflected the frequent indications for kidney biopsy. The list and distribution of histologic diagnoses followed an expected distribution for a nephrology department in a tertiary center such as ours, with the most frequent diagnosis being proliferative glomerular diseases and podocytopathies. The distribution of histologic lesions reflected these diagnoses.\n\nIn the uni- and multivariate analysis of histologic lesions and urinary sediment particles, we found some interesting associations. As expected, the presence of RTECs was strongly associated with the presence of acute tubular necrosis. This is in line with the work by Perazella et al.11 and Chawla et al.12, with both studies demonstrating that the quantification of epithelial cells (isolated or included in casts) and granular casts (including muddy brown casts) are associated with the severity of AKI. The role of U-Sed in AKI is further emphasized in a recent study where muddy brown casts had a 100% specificity and 100% positive predictive value for acute tubular injury.13\n\nRemarkably, the presence of RTECs associated with the presence of many histologic lesions typically related to acute proliferative diseases, such as endocapillary hypercellularity, neutrophils and/or karyorrhexis, wire loops and/or hyaline deposits, fibrinoid necrosis, and cellular/fibrocellular crescents, even when controlling for the presence of acute tubular necrosis. Many of those histologic lesions are related to proliferative glomerulonephritis. We speculate that the ongoing glomerular inflammation ensuing in glomerular washout of cellular debris, which causes a noxious intratubular milieu, results in RTEC shedding.\n\nThe association of the presence of lipiduria with mesangial expansion and hypercellularity is also intriguing, as is the apparent lack of association with podocyte hypertrophy. Even though lipiduria is classically associated with the latter and with nephrotic syndrome,14 it can also be present even in nonglomerular kidney disease.15,16 A possible explanation is that the crosstalk between mesangial and endothelial cells is disrupted by the cytokines generated from mesangial injury, allowing for plasma lipids to escape into Bowman’s space.17 Additionally, lipiduria may represent an early marker of podocytopathy, only detectable at this stage by electron microscopy, thereby explaining why we could not find an association with podocyte hypertrophy.\n\nWe expected dysmorphic erythrocytes to associate strongly with a wide array of proliferative histologic lesions. We have two possible explanations for our results. First, although specific for glomerular disease, the sensibility of dysmorphic hematuria can be variable.18 Second, our population presents a high prevalence of dysmorphic hematuria (found in 54% of patients) and glomerular histologic lesions (present in 92% of patients). In such a population, dysmorphic hematuria may be a poor discriminator of which glomerular lesions one can expect to find. This held true, even when considering only Köhler’s 5% acanthocyte criteria for classifying dysmorphic hematuria.19\n\nSome limitations of this study should be stated. The sample size limited the statistical analysis of ordinal data, and the retrospective nature of the study did not allow for immunofluorescence. There is also the bias of convenience sampling: this was a single-center population of patients who had clinical indication for kidney biopsy. This was also a descriptive retrospective study, which analyzes exclusively patients who had kidney biopsy and urinary sediment evaluation, with a significant proportion having AKI or AKI on CKD (96/131; 73%). Nephrologists frequently attend to patients who have AKI where kidney biopsy is not performed. That can happen for many reasons, such as the presence of contraindication or because there is an obvious culprit such as acute tubular necrosis. We cannot sustain that the associations that we have found in our population would similarly be present in such cases. We also did not use Sternheimer–Malbin stain when evaluating U-Sed, and we only performed electron microscopy when histologic diagnosis was uncertain. A main strength of this study was that the histologic review was blinded to other clinical information. Additionally, we evaluated a comprehensive set of histologic lesions and urinary particles—an approach not employed to this extent in the published literature.\n\nIn conclusion, RTECs, dysmorphic erythrocytes, and lipids are urinary particles that are frequently missed by automated urine analyzers, whereas they are identifiable with a proficient manual urinary sediment evaluation. It is important not to misidentify them because their presence appears to be a red flag for relevant proliferative histologic lesions. As such, manual U-Sed is an important tool for physicians who manage patients with kidney disease, and it may help to shape the indication for performing a kidney biopsy."
