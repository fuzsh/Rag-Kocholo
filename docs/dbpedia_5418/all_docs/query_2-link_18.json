        "text": "Transforming cummunities: “The Impact of UPG Leadership Training 2024” The United People Global (UPG) Sustainability Leadership training stands as a beacon of hope and progress, aligning closely with the aspirations of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). This year, the program received an overwhelming response, with over 13,000 applications from passionate individuals worldwide. Out of these, only 500 candidates were selected for the class of 2024 to embark on this transformative journey, which commenced on March 18, 2024. The selection process was highly competitive, reflecting the commitment and potential of the applicants. These 500 candidates were chosen based on their motivation, demonstrated leadership skills, innovative thinking, and dedication to making a positive impact on their various communities. The diverse backgrounds of the participants enrich the program, bringing a multitude of perspectives and experiences to the table. The training program has equipped candidates with essential skills in leadership, project management, and sustainable development. These skills have been instrumental in the successful implementation of community-based projects, a core component of the program, where candidates learned how to effectively engage stakeholders, manage resources, and evaluate the impact of their initiatives. These competencies have empowered them to drive meaningful change in their communities. The development of individual projects aligned with the UN SDGs are deeply personal, reflecting the candidates' passions and the specific needs of their communities. These projects are not only impactful locally but also contribute to global sustainable development efforts. Beyond their projects, candidates have conducted mini trainings in their various communities to spread awareness about the UPG and the UN SDGs. These sessions have been instrumental in engaging community members and fostering a sense of collective responsibility towards sustainable development. Testimonials from community members highlight the positive impact of these engagements, with many expressing a newfound understanding and commitment to the SDGs. Participants' experiences during the training have been both challenging and rewarding. For instance, Fatima, a participant from Lebanon, shared how the leadership workshops pushed her out of her comfort zone and equipped her with the confidence to spearhead community initiatives. Aurelia from Kenya recounted the project management sessions, highlighting how they taught her to effectively plan and execute sustainable projects. Quotes from candidates reveal a common sentiment of personal growth and an expanded worldview, emphasizing the value of the UPG Sustainability Leadership.\n\nPolice: Executive Staff Leadership/Fostering a Creative Culture Schein combines the teachings of Donald Michael emphasizing the learning needs of the future, Tom Malone’s viewpoint on the theory and practice of coordination in the information age, and Peter Senge’s belief about the art and practice of the learning organization, coupled with Schein’s concerns relating to culture and innovation (Schein, 1990). Creating a diverse culture within an organization requires focal leadership. Cultural changes involve changing the way people think and act, which are generally guided by established norms, values, and past practices. Developing an organization into a learning organization requires change management strategies. Schein (2004) provides 10 organizational assumptions, which he believes relevant in creating learning, flexible, and adaptable culture. 1. A proactive assumption (workers are proactive problem-solvers and learners) 2. Commitment to learning to learn. 3. Positive assumptions about human nature 4. The assumption that the environment can be dominated. 5. Commitment to truth through pragmatism and inquiry. 6. Orientation toward the future. 7. Commitment to full and open task relevant communication. 8. Commitment to diversity. 9. Commitment to systemic thinking. 10. Commitment to cultural analysis for understanding and improving the world (p.332- 336). (Hampton, 2023, personal communication, p. 172)\n\nWHAT IS A VALUE....especially when in a LEADERSHIP role? WHAT WOULD YOU DO? I have designed and delivered programmes/seminars around the world and talk of 'values' and what they stand for....well your behaviours are those clues for many in any organisation no matter what title or rank you hold. If you believe in PEOPLE FIRST then no matter what, do you honestly put PEOPLE first? If you state SAFETY FIRST, do you really behave where SAFETY is first. As I reflect, and I perhaps did not understand 'values' way back, yet in 1990 my values were seriously tested when, in a comfortable, career and job-secure working, yet dangerous environment, two persons lost their lives. So today, some 34 years later, when I hear its PEOPLE FIRST and SAFETY FIRST, do you REALLY mean it? Do you behave to your values...no matter what? Oh and I left that organisation by the way....if you were wondering. david@assuranceoflearning.com Connecting People. Effortlessly\n\nI love the interactions during my mentoring sessions. Recently, I was asked,as to what can be done by CXOs and senior executives to keep the self morale up,particularly in case where recognition and rewards are concerned. Absolutely, it's important to acknowledge and reward one's own good work. Self-recognition and self-reward can be powerful motivators and can contribute to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. However, it's essential to strike a balance and ensure that self-reward is reasonable and proportional to the achievements made. It's also valuable to seek feedback from colleagues or supervisors to ensure that self-assessment is accurate and objective. Overall, self-recognition can be a positive practice as long as it's done in moderation and with humility.\n\nAnnouncing the 2024 Black Corporate Responsibility Leaders Network Mentorship Program! We have a call for participants in our inaugural mentorship program. Please check us out... Applications are due by September 1, 2024 Sustainability and ESG work are a specialized, relatively young, and dynamic profession requiring a wide variety of technical and organizational skills, and it can be challenging and expensive to access the knowledge and opportunities to succeed. This can be especially true for those BIPOC professionals who might have limited professional networks, as this is one of the least ethnically diverse fields currently. For example, one study has found only 4.8% of environment professionals identify as Black, Asian, or another ethnic minority, compared to 12.6% across all professions. And, while we are pleased to see progress in diverse corporate professional representation in recent years, analyses by McKinsey and the EEOC have noted similarly low rates of ethnically diverse and female leaders in executive leadership roles. As diverse professionals who are both sustainability experts and senior corporate leaders, participants in the Black Corporate Responsibility Leaders Network are uniquely positioned to help open these doors a little wider. Thus, we are launching a mentorship program intended to help grow and diversify our field by increasing access to knowledge and career opportunities for early-career stage professionals. Over the course of approximately six months, this free program will provide briefings on key sustainability and management topics, networking opportunities with experts, and career advice from accomplished executives in the field today to a select group of participants. To be considered as a mentee, one should be a working professional in the first five (5) years of their career in sustainability, ESG, or an adjacent field seeking to build a long-term career in advancing social and environmental impact within the corporate/business context. If interested, please submit a resume and a one-page cover letter by September 1, 2024 to mentorship@esgevolution.com summarizing: a. Your professional accomplishments and what you want to achieve next b. What support or knowledge do you feel you need to grow as a sustainability professional? c. How might access to mentors benefit your impact/career? Thanks so much and be well! ☺️\n\n*LEARNING FROM THE LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES OF THE GEESE* *Opening Counsel:* Geese are large, water-loving birds that belong to the family Anatidae, which also includes ducks and swans. They have long necks and legs and are typically known for their distinctive honking call. Geese are found all around the world and are known for their migratory behavior, flying long distances in a V-formation during their seasonal migration. They are herbivores and feed on grasses, grains, and aquatic plants. Geese are social animals and often form large flocks, exhibiting cooperative behavior and strong familial bonds. The geese are known for their remarkable teamwork and leadership skills. *Here are some of the key principles of geese leadership:* 1. *Shared Vision:* Geese have a common goal—to reach their destination. They understand the importance of a shared vision and work together to achieve it. 2. *Collaboration:* Geese fly in a V-formation, which creates an uplift for the whole flock. This formation allows them to conserve energy and support each other, promoting collaboration and teamwork. 3. *Communication:* Geese communicate through honking while flying. This honking serves as a way to encourage and maintain communication among the flock, ensuring everyone is on the same page. 4. *Support and Sharing:* When a goose falls out of the V-formation, another goose will fall back and stay with it until it can rejoin the group. This demonstrates the importance of support and sharing within a team. 5. *Rotation of Leaders:* Geese take turns leading the flock. This rotation enables the group to distribute the workload, foster leadership skills in all members, and prevent dependence on a single leader. 6. *Adaptability:* Geese are adaptable creatures. They change their flight pattern in response to weather conditions or obstacles. This adaptability teaches us to be flexible and open to adjusting our approach when challenges arise. 7. *Encouragement:* By honking and cheering each other on, geese uplift and motivate the entire flock. Encouragement helps boost morale and maintains enthusiasm within the team. By adopting these principles of geese leadership, we can enhance collaboration, communication, and overall teamwork in our professional and personal lives. *TO YOUR SUCCESS!* *Happy Emmyomang @LeadMentor* *Courtesy:* School of Professional Mentoring and Capacity Building *(SPMCB)*\n\nA new year marks the perfect opportunity to invest in yourself—starting with learning the value of inclusive leadership.

Özyeğin University SCoLA Director and NILE - Norwich Institute for Language Education Türkiye Lead Trainer Nergis Uyan did a great job in terms of organizing the sessions for two days in a row and challenging us with thought-provoking questions and activities. At this effective Macmillan Education training organized by a fantastic team of professionals, Duygu ERDOĞAN, SEMIH IRFANER, Erdem Hacıfazlıoğlu, we answered the following questions which I divided into three major categories: organizational culture, being a manager and dealing with change. 🏆Organizational Culture 🔑What is an organization? What is an organizational culture? 🔑How do we measure the effectiveness of an organization? 🔑What are Charles Handy’s models of organizational cultures? Which models reflect your organizational culture: 📌Power Culture, 📌Task Culture, 📌Person Culture or 📌Role Culture? 🔑What are the 6 key elements of organizational cultures? 🔑What does your organogram tell you about the culture of your organization? 🔑What are possible organizational limitations? 🏆Being a manager 🔑What are the most common views on being a manager and how you relate to them? 🔑What is your color as a manager? 🔑Which aspect in the Eaquals Academic Management Competency Framework would you like to work on and why? 🔑Have you used the Eaquals AMCF as the fundamental framework for your management staff’s job descriptions? 🏆Dealing with change 🔑What are the 8 characteristics of change? 🔑How do we monitor and evaluate change?
