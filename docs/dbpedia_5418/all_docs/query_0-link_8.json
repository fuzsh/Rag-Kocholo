You can overhear Brigadine Andricius and Mirri Elendis arguing:\n\nBrigadine Andricius: \"My orders are to observe the ruin, not help you mount a suicidal rescue mission.\"\n\nMirri Elendis \"Then you can observe me kicking every fetching cultist's arse standing between me and my little brother!\"\n\nSpeaking with Mirri you can learn what has happened and offer to help her:\n\n\"Who are you? Another of these useless Leyawiin layabouts?\n\nNo, you're an adventurer, like me. Don't tell me Xigira roped you into this mess too.\"\n\nNo, what's the trouble? / No, what mess?\n\n\"My little brother and I answered a job posting seeking adventurers to help explore a newly discovered ruin, only once the expedition got underway—and we were all split up—our employers turned on us. I barely got away.\"\n\nWhat's your plan now?\n\n\"Free my little brother and the others before something terrible befalls them. I don't know if I can do this on my own, but I have to try.\n\nCan I count on your help? Or were all the questions just morbid curiosity? I can pay if I have to.\"\n\nI'll help you with your rescue.\n\n\"There were five, in addition to me who got duped into this. My brother, Liam; Eolaf, a Nord warrior; Ardia, a High Elf researcher; Deejos, an Argonian scout; and Ghalor, a Wood Elf adventurer.\n\nOther than my brother, I don't know a lot about them.\"\n\nWhat do you know about the ones who tried to take you captive?\n\n\"Not much. Xigira, the woman who hired us, was charming. I didn't buy her story that her expedition was for study, but she paid half our fee up front. I figured they were just treasure hunters looking for plunder. We had no idea they were a cult.\"\n\nWhen did you realize?\n\n\"About the time they said, don't kill her, we need her for the ritual. And while they were trying to subdue me. Probably saved my life though. I fought twice as hard knowing they were taking it easy on me.\n\nNo one else escaped, that I know of.\"\n\nI'm ready when you are.\n\nYou can ask her a few questions before starting your expedition:\n\n\"We didn't get far with our expedition before things went sour, but the ruin was in pretty bad shape. You'll need a grapple bow to get anywhere quickly. Fortunately, I have a spare.\n\nThey're simple enough to use, if you've never tried one.\"\n\nI want to ask you some questions. / I have other questions.\n\n\"All right, but remember you already agreed to help me. It'd be rude to back out now.\n\nBut seriously, I need your help. Please don't change your mind.\"\n\nTell me about this ruin.\n\n\"It's Daedric in origin. Our employer claimed it was recently uncovered, but I have a hard time believing no one noticed until now. And despite its condition it doesn't seem that old. Barely any overgrowth at all.\n\nNone of it makes any sense.\"\n\nYou're saying this is a new construction?\n\n\"A hundred years old, at most. I couldn't tell you who built it, or how it came to be demolished though. I didn't get much time to study it before those fetching cultists tried to throw a sack over my head and drag me off.\"\n\nHow do I use the grapple bow you gave me? / I haven't used a grapple bow before.\n\n\"Just line up your sights with a suitable anchor point, release the bolt, and get ready to fly.\n\nDon't worry, they're pretty much designed to do all the work. The worst you'll have to worry about is underestimating the pull and spraining your neck.\"\n\nOnce inside the Doomvault, Mirri will suggest you find their base camp first:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"We need to reach the base camp, but be careful. I saw a lot more cultists during my escape than the ones who led me here.\"\n\nIf you speak with her after entering, she will comment on the architecture:\n\n\"I've seen a lot of Daedric ruins in my life, but never ones quite like this.\"\n\nI want to ask you some questions. (Repeat)\n\nI haven't used a grapple bow before. (Repeat)\n\nFighting your way through Waking Flame cultists, you will eventually reach a wide open space, but it is strange. The sky is a myriad of colours and Daedric towers can be seen in the distance:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"That's … not our sky. It wasn't like this before. We should hurry.\"\n\n<Mirri runs up to the broken bridge.>\n\nMirri Elendis: \"The bridge is out, but that support looks sturdy enough for the grapple bow.\"\n\nTalking to Mirri after her commenting on the sky:\n\n\"This place has shifted, just a bit, but it's changing. Still, this is definitely where I crossed to escape.\n\nLet's just take this one obstacle at a time. That support will hold your weight, I promise. We can survey better from the other side.\"\n\nWhat's happening in the sky?\n\n\"It's … changing. More like it's two skies mixing together. It wasn't like that before.\n\nI'm not sure what exactly that means just yet, but I'd wager it's got something to do with the cultists' ritual.\"\n\nAfter crossing the bridge by using the available grapple points:\n\n\"There should be a basecamp just ahead. Where we setup before splitting off to explore the ruin.\n\nI imagine the cult's using it now, but we should search it regardless.\"\n\nAs you approach the base camp, Mirri will notice one of her group members:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"The base camp should be—Eolaf! What are those fetchers doing to him?\"\n\nAs you approach the Soul Siphon Array, Xigira will taunt Eolaf:\n\nEolaf: \"I don't … I don't feel so good … hurk ….\"\n\nXigira: \"Endure, Nord. The foothold is nearly complete!\"\n\n<Xigira leaves through a portal.>\n\nMirri Elendis: \"That voice! Xigira!\"\n\nThe Nord appears to be strapped to a device and the surrounding cultists are using the crystals pylons to do something to him. Mirri will run up to the rock overlooking the scene, where you can talk about what is happening to Eolaf and what can be done:\n\n\"That's Eolaf! One of the other adventurers Xigira duped with this setup. They've got him strung up like a New Life pony guar. Survey stones, my ashy arse. That's a sacrifice if I've ever seen one! We've got to do something.\"\n\nSurvey stone?\n\n\"Xigira had us escorting her scholars around the area to place those so-called survey stones. Supposedly they would get the layout of this place in an instant. Bunch of guar dung, clearly.\n\nIt's sucking the life out of him!\"\n\nCan we destroy it?\n\n\"I damn well plan to try. It'll be dangerous though. For Eolaf most of all. That ritual is already feeding off of him somehow. The sudden shock of destroying the stone might kill him.\n\nWe could try weakening the ritual before ending it entirely.\"\n\nHow do we do that?\n\n\"That array by Eolaf seems to be the heart of the ritual, but the magic is being drawn to another focal point nearby. Destroying that might lighten the load on Eolaf, and the backlash of ending the ritual by force. It's the best chance of saving him.\"\n\nUnderstood. Let's go.\n\nSpeaking with Mirri again you can ask how she knows about this stuff:\n\n\"We need to stop that ritual, the sooner the better, but Eolaf's chances of surviving go up exponentially if we try picking it apart carefully instead of smashing the central array right at the start.\n\nThe grapple bow should help us search around.\"\n\nHow do you know all this?\n\n\"I don't know it. I'm making an educated guess. Daedrology is my main field of study, though I tend to avoid getting caught up in their worship and rituals. Mostly I'm fascinated why anyone would join these fetching cults in the first place.\"\n\nWhy study Daedra if you don't really care for them?\n\n\"I took an interest in the Anticipations of the Tribunal and my ancestors worship of them before the Three arose to godhood.\n\nDark Elves aren't the only ones who revere Daedra alongside Divines, but now's not the time for a philosophical discussion.\"\n\nAt this point, you have a choice on how to proceed to stop the ritual. You can either destroy the Soul Siphon Array first, but the backlash can kill Eolaf. But if you find and destroy the nearby Ritual Focus Crystal, Eolaf has a better chance of surviving.\n\nIf you find and destroy the focus crystal, Mirri will point out your success:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"That did it! The ritual's weakened.\"\n\nWhen you destroy the Soul Siphon Array located in front of the device, your previous actions will determine what happens next. Destroying the Ritual Focus Crystal beforehand results in Eolaf being released, injured, but alive. Destroying the Soul Siphon Array first will result in Eolaf dying.\n\nEolaf is rescued: Eolaf dies:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Eolaf! Follow me! Quickly!\"\n\nEolaf: \"You don't have to tell me twice!\"\n\n<Both run to the door to the lower levels.>\n\n<Mirri walks up to the body.>\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Eolaf! He's dead ….\"\n\n<Mirri runs to the entrance to the lower levels.>\n\nOnce in the hallway you can talk to Mirri, her greeting will depend on whether Eolaf lived or died.\n\nEolaf was rescued: Eolaf died:\n\n\"It worked! Sorry if that sounds too much like surprise, but I couldn't be sure that would be enough to save Eolaf's life until we tried it.\n\nIf the cult is doing this to the others, we should be able to free them too. If we're careful.\"\n\nAny idea what it was they were doing to Eolaf?\n\n\"Eolaf … that's what I was afraid would happen. The strain of snapping that connection to his soul was too much to take.\n\nIf we aren't more careful, the others will meet the same fate.\"\n\nAny idea what it was they were doing to Eolaf?\n\n\"It was definitely a Daedric ritual, but not your typical sacrifice. Offerings to the Princes are usually quick and brutal. This was much more purposeful. I don't know what they were trying to accomplish, but they were using Eolaf's soul to power it.\"\n\nDo you know where the others were taken?\n\n\"The s'wits didn't tell us much of their plans before stabbing us in the back, but I've got a rough idea where they were taking the other stones.\n\nIf we head out the other side of these corridors we should be on the right path.\"\n\nLet's keep moving then.\n\n\"I recognize these corridors. The expedition hadn't split up just yet. Everyone aside from Eolaf would have been lead somewhere beyond.\n\nThe exit wasn't far, but it's sure to feel like farther now that the place's crawling with cultists and Daedra.\"\n\nFighting you way through cultists and Daedra in the Lower Ruins, you will come across a journal lying on the ground near the door to the next level:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Hold on! I recognize that journal. It belonged to Ardia.\"\n\nSpeaking with Mirri before picking up the journal:\n\n\"Ardia was a proper researcher. She was always scribbling in her notebooks. The klutz must have dropped it.\n\nBut when? Of the group, I'd say she's the least likely to escape on her own.\"\n\nUpon reading Ardia's Journal, you will learn the Altmer managed to escape the initial attack. You can then show Mirri the journal:\n\n\"Well, I'll be. Ardia actually made a break for it. She's the last one I'd have expected to escape. Two left feet, that one. Much as I'd like to believe she made it out, somehow I doubt it.\"\n\nYou think she was caught?\n\n\"Honestly, I'm impressed she made it this far, but my gut tells me she's still here. I think we should keep looking for the rest of those sacrificial stones. Whoever's still bound up in the cult's rituals is in the greatest danger.\"\n\nUnderstood.\n\nGoing through the door, you will find yourself in another outdoor space, the \"Inner Layer\" of the Doomvault. The Deadlands influence has become more prevalent:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Lava? And look, those trees! The shifting is more drastic here.\"\n\nTalking with her you can discuss the motives of the ritual:\n\n\"It's getting to the point that I hardly recognize this place. It's like the sky is on fire and everything's scorched. Did the cult come here just to destroy this place? That hardly makes any sense, but Daedra worship too often doesn't.\"\n\nMaybe the destruction isn't the point?\n\n\"It's possible this is all just a side effect of the ritual, not it's intent. Who knows, maybe their magic isn't just feeding on the souls of those they've captured, but everything here?\n\nAll the more reason to stop them quickly.\"\n\nYou will need to find the cultist's camp and soon you will find Ardia strapped into a device like Eolaf was:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Looks like they caught Ardia after all. We need to free her!\"\n\nYou have the option of talking to Mirri about this, before attempting to free Ardia:\n\n\"We need to free Ardia from that ritual before it drains her soul completely, even if it kills her.\n\nStill, we should look for focal crystals nearby that are drawing power from her. Destroying them is the only way to save her life and her soul.\"\n\nWhat do you mean by even if it kills her?\n\n\"I mean stopping the ritual prematurely might kill her but there are fates worse than death. If her soul is drained entirely from her body, it won't be left to the mercy of the Divines. It'll probably wind up in the clutches of Oblivion.\"\n\nXigira will watch the scene from above, and sarcastically greets Mirri before disappearing through a portal:\n\nXigira: \"You came back, Mirri. I look forward to reuniting you with your brother.\"\n\nThis time there are two Ritual Focus Stones on the cliffs above the camp. They can be reached by finding Grapple Points to get up there. Mirri will comment when you destroy a crystal:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"That helped, but there's still something drawing power from the ritual. Let's keep looking!\"\n\nThe second crystal:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"I think that's all of them. Now the array!\"\n\nLike before, the result of destroying the Soul Siphon Array will depend on whether you weakened the ritual first or not:\n\nArdia is rescued: Ardia dies:\n\nDestroyed the two Focus Crystals first:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Come on, Ardia—watch your step!\"\n\n<Ardia hobbles after her.>\n\nArdia: \"I—I'm just a little unsteady!\"\n\nDestroying the Soul Siphon Array first:\n\n<Ardia is killed.>\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Ardia … I hope you find peace at least. Let's get out of here.\"\n\n<Mirri heads to the door to the next section.>\n\nMirri will be waiting for you in the hallway ahead. Her greeting will depend on Ardia's survival:\n\nArdia was rescued: Ardia died:\n\n\"It looks like Ardia will be all right. Hopefully she can make a successful escape this time.\"\n\nHow many more of these rituals do you think there are?\n\n\"Damn it, Ardia. If only you'd managed to escape.\n\nAt least we were able to end the ritual before it consumed her soul. May she rest with her kind.\"\n\nHow many more of these rituals do you think there are?\n\n\"I can't be certain, but Deejos, Ghalor, and my little brother, Liam are still missing. We have to assume they've been captured and bound like the other two.\n\nWe need to stop these rituals, and not just for their sakes.\"\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n\"I have a theory about the purpose of these rituals. The changes to the land, the sky, the blasted heat. I think this place is being overtaken by another plane. If I had to guess, I'd say it's becoming the Deadlands.\"\n\nHow is that possible?\n\n\"I think this ruin isn't actually part of Nirn. More like a piece of our world bottled up and the cult is trying to fill the bottle from another source.\"\n\nAll the more reason to stop these rituals.\n\nSpeaking with Mirri afterwards, while in this location:\n\n\"This ruin is not like any other I've seen and I've seen a lot of Daedric ruins. Sil knows I would have loved to study it. Liam too. Damn Xigira and her fanatics.\"\n\nWhen you reach the third outdoor section, the Core Layer, you will find that the Deadlands has supplanted the area, with only some burnt trees and grass remaining. Mirri recognizes someone nearby:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Is that—Ghalor! Over here!\"\n\n<She runs up to him but stops short.>\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Ghalor? Oh, fetching Vehk!\"\n\n<Ghalor staggers around, ignoring her.>\n\nSpeaking to Mirri before examining Ghalor:\n\n\"Three alive, I can't look at him. Can you see if—if there's anything left of him in there?\"\n\nChecking him, there is nothing conscious in Ghalor, he is soul shriven. You can then speak to Mirri:\n\n\"He's gone. Soul shriven. I've read accounts of this happening, but I've never seen it myself. This ravaged body is all that's left of Ghalor. His soul … gone somewhere far worse.\n\nThis is what will happen to the others. To my little brother ….\"\n\nOnly if we fail.\n\n\"Right. You're right. This isn't the time to lose it. There's still hope for the others.\n\nGhalor couldn't have wandered far like this. There must be another ritual site nearby. Let's go!\"\n\nIf you speak to her again, she'll say:\n\n\"Come on, the ones who did that to Ghalor must be nearby. We should destroy their ritual site, if nothing else.\"\n\nWhen you find the next ritual site, you will also find Deejos and Xigira:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"This is it! And they've got Deejos!\"\n\nXigira: \"Keep meddling, Mirri, and I'll make you watch your brother waste away.\"\n\n<Xigira leaves through a portal.>\n\nSpeaking with Mirri at the point, she will point out the Focus Crystals:\n\n\"The ritual must have several focal points nearby. We need to find them if we hope to save Deejos. Barring that, we need to stop the ritual before it consumes her like Ghalor.\"\n\nLike with Ardia, there are two Ritual Focus Crystals which can be reach via the Grapple Points: The first crystal destroyed:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"This focal point is finished, but it wasn't the only one by the look of it.\"\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Another one down. Did you see any others?\"\n\nThe second crystal:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"It's stopped feeding on their soul. Let's do the same to the rest.\"\n\nFor the third time, the result of destroying the Soul Siphon Array will depend on whether you weakened the ritual first or not:\n\nDeejos is rescued: Deejos dies:\n\nDestroyed the Focus Crystals first:\n\n<Deejos falls out of the restraints.>\n\nMirri Elendis: \"You're free! Come on!\"\n\nDeejos: \"You came back for me?\"\n\nDestroying the Soul Siphon Array first:\n\n<Deejos is killed.>\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Hope you make it back to your trees, Deejos. We need to keep moving.\"\n\nYou can then follow Mirri down the path, where she will wait to talk to you:\n\nDeejos was rescued: Deejos died:\n\n\"We managed to save her. I don't know if that'll improve her opinion of me—well, my kind—but I'm glad. I wouldn't wish what happened to poor Ghalor on anyone.\"\n\nWe've accounted for everyone but your brother.\n\n\"Deejos and I were not close. Truth told, I think she merely tolerated me and my brother. Not that I can blame her.\n\nI hope she finds some rest with her Trees.\"\n\nWe've accounted for everyone but your brother.\n\n\"Liam … hang in there, little brother. We'll find you.\n\nWe seem to be getting close to the heart of the cult's plot. Other than the ruins, the terrain here is unrecognizable from where we came from. I'd wager that's where we'll find him. And Xigira.\"\n\nYou want to go after her too?\n\n\"No. I don't care about that hooded viper. I just want my little brother back … but if she stands in our way, I'll gladly kick her fetching arse back to Oblivion.\n\nCome on. Liam needs me.\"\n\nIf you speak to her again, she'll say:\n\n\"We've come this far. We have to find Liam. We have to.\"\n\nIn the lowest level, there is no trace of Nirn in the surroundings. Fighting your way through Daedra, you will soon reach a gate where Xigira is waiting for you:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Xigira! Give Liam back and maybe I won't fetching kill you!\"\n\nXigira: \"Allow me to reward you for hampering our progress. You may listen to your brother's muffled screams unmolested as you stand helpless before this gateway.\"\n\n<The gate is sealed with magic and Xigira leaves.>\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Damn it! She's sealed the gate! We need to remove that barrier! That switch might have something to do with it.\"\n\nYou can ask Mirri for advice on what to do:\n\n\"That s'wit's locked us out! We aren't getting that gate open by force, but I bet that mechanism plays some part in getting it open.\"\n\nAny thoughts on what to do?\n\n\"I think that mechanism must be connected to the gate, but that can't be the only thing stopping us or Xigira wouldn't be so confident. We should look around. There might be more of these Daedric objects involved in the barrier.\"\n\nThere are three levers you need to find and pull to unlock the gate. Two are reachable with the grappling bow. Once you have done, the gate will unseal:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"I think that did it! The gate's unsealed! Let's find Liam!\"\n\nIf you speak to her here, she says:\n\n\"The barrier is down. Let's get through that gate and save Liam!\"\n\nThe Anchor Chamber is a pit of lava will small islands, on the opposite side, Liam can be seen strapped into a device, and Xigira next to him, facing you as she feels your presence:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Xigira! If you think a little lava is going to stop me you've got another thing coming!\"\n\nXigira: \"Oh, Mirri, the struggle only makes this more fun.\"\n\nor\n\nXigira: \"Fine, Liam can watch you die before he does.\"\n\nSpeaking with Mirri here, she will emphasize being careful when releasing her brother:\n\n\"This is it! We're going to save Liam and stop Xigira's plot here and now.\n\nLet's find the ritual's focal points and weaken it so we can set him free.\"\n\nYou think we have time for that?\n\n\"I don't know! He's my little brother, I have to try! If—if it comes to it … end the ritual prematurely. I'd rather send Liam into the arms of Mother Morrowind than let Oblivion have him.\n\nJust, try. Please?\"\n\nI'll do what I can.\n\nAs you approach Liam after getting past through Xigira:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Liam! Can you hear me? Big sis is getting you out of this!\"\n\nThere are two Focus Crystals located on different islands, use the Grapple Points to reach them.\n\n\"There's no time to waste! Destroy the focal crystals so we can free Liam from the ritual!\"\n\nDestroying the first crystal:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"We've lightened their burden a bit, but it might not be enough. Look for other focal crystals.\"\n\nDestroying the second crystal:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"That's done it! Now, destroy the array!\"\n\nLike with the other three instances, you can decide whether you are careful in disrupting the ritual or ending it quickly and killing Liam in the process:\n\nIf you destroyed the focus crystals before destroying the Soul Siphon Array, Liam will be freed:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Liam! Thank Vehk! I'll get you out of here.\"\n\nLiam Elendis: \"Mirri! I thought I'd never see you again!\"\n\n<The pair escape down the path and through a back entrance.>\n\nHowever if you disrupt the ritual prematurely, Liam will die like the others:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Liam … Almsivi guide you to our ancestors, little brother.\"\n\n<Mirri then runs outside.>\n\nEmerging outside, you will arrive at their camp adjacent to the river. The survivors will have gathered there, along with Brigadine Andricius, who Mirri will be talking to:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"You can inform your worthless legates that we stopped the cultists, no thanks to you!\"\n\nBrigadine Andricius: \"Just be grateful your little dispute didn't land you afoul of the law. Cease your meddlesome trespassing while you're ahead and get a real job.\"\n\nYou can then speak to Mirri, her response to you will depend on whether or not her brother survived:\n\nLiam is Rescued: Liam Dies:\n\n\"We did it! My little brother is safe and that backstabbing viper, Xigira's plans are in shambles. I almost wish I could see what Dagon does to her for her failure, but my imagination's probably better than his anyway.\"\n\nWhat next?\n\n\"We leave this useless s'wit to his report and count Azura's lucky stars. My little brother is alive and well thanks to you. That's more than I could ask.\n\nWe owe you. If you ever need anything—and I mean anything—you can count on me.\"\n\n\"Damn Xigira! Damn her fetching soul to the blackest pits of Oblivion!\n\nI hope Dagon rakes her over hot coals for eternity for failing to accomplish whatever it was she was trying to do here. It's my only consolation.\"\n\nWhat next?\n\n\"There's nothing left to be done than pay my respects to the Tribunal and pray Liam can rest in our family tomb.\n\nI couldn't save my little brother, but you helped me try when no one else would. If you ever need anything. You need only ask.\"\n\nAfter you complete the quest, having rescued Liam:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"I should get word that we're safe to our parents as soon as possible. I hope to see you again soon. And Liam, straight to Leyawiin, you hear?\"\n\nLiam Elendis: \"I just want a moment to catch my breath and thank your friend here. Mother.\"\n\nSpeaking with Mirri afterwards:\n\nLiam is Rescued: Liam Dies:\n\n\"I never should have roped my baby brother into this. I knew the job seemed a little shady, so I thought having someone I could trust with me would be for the best, but I only put both our lives in danger.\n\nNever again.\"\n\n(?)\n\n\"I can't believe Liam's gone. I never should have gotten him involved with this. My parents will never forgive me.\"\n\n(?)\n\nA Mother's Obsession[edit]\n\nIf she's active as your companion, she will say \"Do you have a moment? Something popped up.\"\n\nWhen you reach friendly rapport with Mirri, she will have a request for you. Summon and talk to her to see what the situation is:\n\n\"I got a letter from my father. About my mother, Irenni. She's gone missing.\n\nShe has a habit of running off on an adventure at the drop of a hat and being gone for weeks at a time, but dad says she's been out of touch for a while now. He's worried.\"\n\nYour mother is an adventurer?\n\n\"It runs in the family. Well, mom's side. Dad's a Hlaalu trader she partnered with for years before settling down—mostly settling down. She'd acquire all sorts of rare items for their clients, but my father said they haven't had any commissions.\"\n\nAny idea where she may have gone?\n\n\"Mom neglected to mention it, I'm sure, but my father mentioned getting an angry letter from one of their old clients at the Stormhold Mages Guild claiming she reneged on their arrangement after taking payment.\n\nWould you mind if we pay them a visit?\"\n\nSure, I'll help you find your mother.\n\nAfter agreeing to help, you can speak with her and ask questions about her family:\n\n\"Dad's letter said that the one raising a stink was an old client of theirs named Mirtulivon, a member of the Stormhold Mages Guild.\n\nLet's get to Shadowfen and see just what sort of trouble Mom got herself into this time.\"\n\nI take it this isn't the first time you've had to go chasing after her.\n\n\"It's that obvious, eh? When mom's in one of her flighty moods it usually sorts itself out, but sometimes she gets so wrapped up in something it becomes an obsession. Someone has to talk some sense into her, and that someone is usually me.\"\n\nWhy does it always fall on you?\n\n\"I got my mom's knack for adventure and my dad's levelheadedness, so I'm the only one who's both crazy enough to go after her and sane enough to talk some sense into her.\n\nI also happen to be their eldest child, so it's my filial duty to the house.\"\n\nDo you have a lot of family obligations?\n\n\"Hah, not so much. Our family is of little consequence, so we're free to be a bunch of impetuous miscreants chasing our own whims. If I'd been born to one of the Great Houses, I'd either be a pawn in their schemes or a disappointment, like father.\"\n\nYour father's a disappointment?\n\n\"He's a seventh son, of a seventh son in House Hlaalu, so he wasn't going to amount to anything without climbing over his siblings. Dad's too sweet for that, so he wound up marrying into our little house for something as unprofitable as love.\"\n\nHave you ever been to Stormhold?\n\n\"We lived there for a good few years when I was young. It was awkward at times—Argonians don't trust Dark Elves, for good reason.\n\nI like to think my parents showed them different, but not everyone warmed up to us.\"\n\nArgonian Character: Otherwise:\n\nYou can hardly blame my people for being wary of Dark Elves.\n\n\"I know, I know. It just ashes my hide that a few rotten fetchers ruined it for the rest of us … but that's not quite the truth. It's easy to blame it all on House Dres and the Telvanni, but they weren't the only ones keeping slaves before the Pact.\"\n\nHardly surprising that Argonians are wary of Dark Elves.\n\n\"I know, I know. It just ashes my hide that a few rotten fetchers ruined it for the rest of us … but that's not quite the truth. It's easy to blame it all on House Dres and the Telvanni, but they weren't the only ones keeping slaves before the Pact.\"\n\nWhy wouldn't the Argonians trust Dark Elves?\n\n\"I'm a little surprised you have to ask. Morrowind had the most prolific slave trade in Tamriel before the Ebonheart Pact abolished it. The people they preyed on most were the splintered Argonian tribes down in Black Marsh.\"\n\nBoth options lead to the same thing:\n\nDid your family keep slaves?\n\n\"No! My mom and dad never approved of it. I even had a cousin who was forced into servitude and they helped my uncle free him at great risk to themselves.\n\nBut our ancestors? That … I don't know.\"\n\nThat burden's on them. It's not yours.\n\n\"Yeah, I suppose. I just feel foolish for taking our innocence for granted. If my ancestors weren't guiltless, I'll just have to be better than them. That's all there is to it.\n\nI can start by getting my mother to act more responsibly.\"\n\nThat would be a good place to start rebuilding trust.\n\n\"I really should. I've spent my life digging through all sorts of obscure history and I've never really thought to look into my own. Embarrassing, really.\n\nThat'll have to wait until after we've tracked down my mother though.\"\n\nWhen you enter the Stormhold Mage Guild's Mirri will recognize the person you are looking for and hang back:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"That High Elf matches Mirtulivon's description! Ask him if he's seen Irenni Elendis. I should probably hang back.\"\n\nTalking to Mirri before approaching the mage:\n\n\"Dad's letter claimed old Mirt over there was highly peeved about whatever deal he made with my mother falling through. I'd just as soon avoid catching an earful, so if you could ask about Irenni as a neutral party he may be more willing to cooperate.\"\n\nSpeaking with Mirtulivon, he will explain that Irenni asked for information in return for performing a favor for him. Instead, she left forgoing retrieving the Antique Inkwell he lost in a card game to Under-Root. Mirtulivon will tell you what he told Irenni if you retrieve (i.e steal) Inkwell back.\n\nYou can then confer with Mirri on this:\n\n\"I caught the gist of that. That s'wit actually wanted my mom to rob a bank? I'm glad she had enough sense not to go through with it. Unless the reason we haven't heard from her is because she's in jail … no, no, she wouldn't ….\"\n\nYou don't sound so sure.\n\n\"I mean, adventuring can be dirty business. My family is nothing but a bunch of no-good, tomb robbers depending on who you ask. But there's a big difference between digging through old ruins for treasure and outright stealing.\"\n\nDo you think she might really be in jail?\n\n\"No, if that were the case she'd have written my father to pay her bounty. And while he should let her sit and learn her lesson, he's too much of a softy. She probably ran off like Mirt said.\n\nSo now it's us who have to get our hands dirty.\"\n\nMaybe not, we'll figure something out.\n\n\"Let's hope so, but if we do wind up breaking the law, I could have a worse partner in crime. You're a good friend.\"\n\nLet's pay a visit to the bank.\n\nYou can then head to Under-Root Bank on the northern side of the town. Mirri will bemoan your task:\n\n\"I can't believe I have to steal from a bank for my own fetching mother. This is why no one takes our house seriously.\"\n\nOnce inside the bank, Mirri will try and act casual:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Act casual. Just two people admiring the decorations. This is such a nice bank, isn't it? Oh, such refined taste.\"\n\nThe inkwell can be found on a desk on the second floor. Seviel Andril will be there, and you can either bribe him to look the other way or use your sneaking skills and steal it without him noticing. As you head downstairs to the door, Mirri is ready to leave the scene:\n\n\"Mirt better have worthwhile information about my mother, or I might need to add assault to my list of crimes for the day.\"\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Got it? Let's not overstay our welcome.\"\n\nYou can bring the Inkwell back to Mirtulivon, who explains he gave her information about a lead on a Dwemer relic. He sent her to meet with a Nord near Steamfont Cavern in Stonefalls. Mirri will know the place:\n\n\"Steamfont. I know of it. Dwemer ruins re-purposed by some resourceful types for perfecting certain kinds of crafts. Never had reason to go there myself. It shouldn't be too hard to find though.\n\nLet's head to Stonefalls before Edvilda moves on.\"\n\nWhen you arrive at Edvilda's Camp above Steamfont, you will find Edvilda Stone-Stalker dead and Irenni nowhere to be seen:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Is this Edvilda? Someone killed her! Let's search the camp.\"\n\n\"I didn't really expect to find my mother here, but I at least thought Edvilda would be able to tell us where she went. We have to find out what happened here.\"\n\nYou can find a Homemade Scarf near the campfire:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Mom's scarf! Liam gave that to her last New Life, when she was headed to Skyrim for the Snow Bear Plunge. She wouldn't have left it!\"\n\nThere is also Edvilda's Log Book near her bedroll, which can be read:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Did Edvilda write down anything important?\"\n\nAfter finding both items, talk to Mirri:\n\n\"Mom was definitely here. She had to have gone in a hurry if she left this scarf behind. Did Edvilda write down anything that would clue us in on where my mother's gone?\"\n\nIt looks like Edvilda was trying to sell your mother false information about a puzzle box.\n\n\"Oh, not that fetching thing again! Mom …! She's been chasing after my grandfather's Dwemer puzzle box for decades. Ever since the old Mer joined our ancestors at the tomb. It's her obsession.\n\nDon't tell me they got into a fight over it.\"\n\nEdvilda planned to send Irenni to the Inner Sea Armature, which is full of bandits.\n\n\"Great. Just great. So the shifty Nord met my mother out here and ran afoul of bandits? That explains what happened to Edvilda, but mom's not here, thank Vehk, but if she'd escaped we'd have heard from her, right?\n\nThey must have taken her captive.\"\n\nThen let's head to the Inner Sea Armature and look for her.\n\n\"I've never been to the Inner Sea Armature, but it must not be too far from Edvilda's camp.\n\nThree, I hope mom's all right ….\"\n\nHead to the northwest to find the Inner Sea Armature, Mirri will point out the Dwemer construction when you get close to the entrance:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Dwarven pipes! By that cave. This looks promising.\"\n\nOnce inside, Mirri will be very worried:\n\n\"I swear, if these s'wits have done anything to my mother I'll—well, you'll fetching see.\"\n\nFight your way through the outlaws, and head to the center room. Irenni can be found chained up ... and mixing cake batter:\n\nIrenni Elendis: \"Mirri? Mirri! Am I glad to see you, scrib. Get me out of these shackles.\"\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Mom! Do you have any fetching idea how worried—wait … are you cooking?\"\n\nMirri will be exasperated:\n\n\"I don't know what I expected. Whatever it was, it didn't include my mother making a fetching cake.\"\n\nAfter you unchain Irenni:\n\n\"Just … talk to her. The last thing we need is her making a scene right now.\n\nThis is why I never bring friends home.\"\n\nTalking with Irenni, she will explain that after Edvilda got cut down by bandits, she promised she would cook for them if they spared her life. You can then lead Irenni outside.\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Can we please just get out of here now?\"\n\n\"Let's just get out of this dump. We can talk outside.\"\n\nOnce outside, Mirri will begin yelling at her mother:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Don't think you're free and clear just because we escaped the bandits. What were you thinking?\"\n\nIrenni Elendis: \"Oh, come now, Mirri. I've been doing this since before you were in diapers.\"\n\nMirri Elendis: \"And you're not getting any younger! We almost lost Liam, and you nearly lost this! Would you trade it for that stupid puzzle box?\"\n\nIrenni Elendis: \"Liam's scarf? Mirri—I … I'm sorry. I'm sorry I worried you all. It's just … I'll let it go.\"\n\nMirri Elendis: \"We love you, mom. We're your family. Go home.\"\n\nYou can then talk to Mirri, who will be at her wits end about her mother's fixation on the relic:\n\n\"I know it probably seems like I'm being harsh, but mom's been at this more times than I can count. She promises to give up on it, but then she catches some whiff of a lead about that damn box and she's off like a race guar.\"\n\nAt least she's all right.\n\n\"This time. Death was the only thing that stopped my grandfather from chasing after that stupid trinket. I don't want it to be the same for her. You can only keep rolling the dice in this life for so long.\"\n\nDo you think she'll really give it up this time?\n\n\"I hope so. Probably not, but I've weighed her down with enough guilt to hold her for a little while at least.\n\nEither way, sorry for dragging you into my family drama.\"\n\nShould we make sure your mother returns home safely?\n\n\"Are you kidding? If I don't get you out of here she'll make you meet the entire extended family. Davon's Watch is just down the road. She can make her way home from there.\n\nThank you for putting up with all this. I'll make it up to you.\"\n\nIf you exit out of the conversation before turning in the quest, she will alternatively say:\n\n\"Again, sorry for dragging you into the middle of all this, but at least everything turned out all right in the end.\"\n\nShould we escort your mother home?\n\nSame dialogue for turning in the quest\n\nDead Weight[edit]\n\nAfter helping find and rescue Irenni, Mirri will have another request for you:\n\n\"I have another favor to ask, if it's not too much trouble?\"\n\nWhat's the favor?\n\n\"Mom will try her best to put her search for that puzzle box behind her, but I know her. The moment she catches wind of another flimsy lead she'll be off looking, just one more time.\n\nShe's only going to stop when it's found, or she's dead.\"\n\nYou want to search for it, don't you?\n\n\"Want to? No. Need to? Probably. My mom's been trying to fulfill her filial duty since she buried my grandfather. I'd rather not come by it the same way.\n\nI was thinking I'd pay the old Mer a visit at our ancestral tomb. Will you join me?\"\n\nSure, Mirri, I'll help however I can.\n\nAfter agreeing to go to Othrenis, you can ask some questions about what you will be doing and what she knows about her mother and grandfather's relationship:\n\nHow is visiting his grave going to help us?\n\n\"Well, I'm not just thinking of finally paying my respects. I can summon his ancestor spirit at the tomb. I'm hoping my grandfather can tell us something about his missing puzzle box that will help put this fetching fetcher fly hunt to rest.\"\n\nWouldn't your mother have already explored that option?\n\n\"Like I said, I don't think she's spoken with him since he died. Mom never talks about my grandfather. I get the impression that they weren't close.\"\n\nWhy is she going through such great lengths to find it for him then?\n\n\"He was obsessed with that puzzle box. When it was stolen, getting it back was all he could think about. I don't think mom gives two s'wits about the box, she just wants him to acknowledge her.\n\nMaybe I can convince him to free her from her duty.\"\n\nWe'll go speak with your grandfather.\n\n\"Othrenis is in Stonefalls. I can't speak for the condition of the tomb, so we should assume it's dangerous.\"\n\nWhen you arrive at Othrenis, Mirri will give directions:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"I think granddad's tomb is on the eastern side, toward the back.\"\n\nFight your way through undead, and you can find the Elendis Family Plot:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"There, that's his shrine. Tomb. Whatever. You light the candles. I'll mutter the ancestor summons prayer.\"\n\nWhen you get closer, Mirri will point out the candles:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"This is the family plot. Light the votive candles, would you? I'll begin the incantation.\"\n\nSpeaking with her, she will admit this is the first time she has done this:\n\n\"I've never actually done this before. Don't judge. You can help me out by lighting some votive candles. I'll pray to the three that my grandfather feels like listening.\"\n\nAfter you light the candles, Mirri will recite the incantation:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Grandfather, house of my house, blood of my blood. The daughter of your daughter summons you. Come forth and share your wisdom.\"\n\n<There will be a golden beam of light and Bralen Elendis appears.>\n\nBralen Elendis: \"Daughter of my daughter? Bah. Strangers both. I have nothing to say to the likes of you.\"\n\nSpeaking with Mirri before Bralen, she will ask you to talk to\n\n\"Getting the cold shoulder from a corpse. That's a new shame for the books.\n\nMaybe he'll speak to you.\"\n\nBralen will be openly disdainful of Mirri, her mother and you. However, when you explain you are looking for the puzzle box in Irenni's stead, Bralen will explain what happened. He was murdered by his friend, Onimiril who helped him study the box, only to steal it and kill Bralen when he discovered the truth. Onimiril was a guild mage from Vulkhel Guard which is where you need to search next.\n\nYou can talk with Mirri about what you learnt:\n\n\"What an ass. I can see why mom wasn't keen to visit all these years.\n\nI can't believe she's spent so many years trying to please that fetcher.\"\n\nA lot of people try to please their parents.\n\n\"Don't I know. I suppose I should be more grateful to mom and dad for letting me be my own person. I had no idea.\n\nIf my father talked to me that way, I'd have pushed him off a ledge myself.\"\n\nYou still want to help find his puzzle box?\n\n\"Only so I can shove it up his ashes. This is important to my mother. I'm doing this for her. Not that old s'wit.\n\nLet's head to Vulkhel Guard. See if we can find this Onimiril. I may want to shake his hand.\"\n\nVery well, let's go to Vulkhel Guard.\n\n\"My grandfather said Onimiril was a guild mage from Vulkhel Guard. Maybe we'll find him there, or at least find someone who knows where he is.\"\n\nOnce in Vulkhel Guard, you can overhear a conversation between Takaano and Caelia Merulin as you approach the Mages Guild. The Khajiit will mention Onimiril, Mirri will suggest you have a little talk with him:\n\n\"I thought I heard that Khajiit mention Onimiril. Let's have a chat with him.\"\n\nSpeaking with Takaano, he will explain that he is a former apprentice of Onimiril, before the Altmer was kicked out of the Guild. He is willing to give more information if you help him with a problem. He accidentally turned his fellow mage Arelette Dubeau into a chicken and wants you to bring her back to him before she gets eaten.\n\n\"Maybe while we're out hunting down this chicken we can stop somewhere for a bite to eat. I'm feeling a bit peckish.\n\nSorry, that's not funny. Maybe a little funny.\"\n\nThe brightly colored chicken will be outside the Salted Wings Tavern and you and Mirri can follow the chicken before it stops running. With the Mopey Chicken in hand, Mirri hopes that you caught the right one:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"I hope this is the right one or it's going to make for an interesting scene back at the guild.\"\n\n\"I certainly hope we're done fetching fowl today. Give the chicken to Takaano and let's see what he knows about Onimiril.\"\n\nAlong the way, Mirri will express her opinion of chicken dishes:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"I don't know why anyone would eat chicken when they could have a plump pony guar.\"\n\nYou can give the chicken to Taakano, who explains that Onimiril was expelled for using dark magics and that he apparently has a small getaway northwest of Skywatch:\n\n\"So a master mage who murdered my grandfather was expelled by the guild for practicing forbidden arts and has a reclusive hideaway. That sounds promising, in the worst way possible.\"\n\nTaakano's description of the place was much more impressive than it actually is—a small camp with a desk—Mirri will agree:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Not much of a retreat, if you ask me. Let's see if Onimiril left anything helpful behind.\"\n\nWhile there is no sign of puzzle box on first glance, Mirri suggests searching the place:\n\n\"No sign of a Dwarven puzzle box. Let's look through his things. Maybe we can figure out where he took it.\"\n\nYou can find Onimiril's Writings on the desk. The text shows that Onimiril was just as fixated on the Dwemer Puzzle Cube and its secrets as Bralen Elendis. It also mentions that he took some mages to Avanchnzel in the Rift, to perform an experiment on the device:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Find anything useful in all that scribble?\"\n\nYou can then show her book:\n\n\"Looks like trying to solve that puzzle box took its toll on Onimiril. Why were he and my grandfather so enamored with the thing?\"\n\nOnimiril seems to think it's connected to Avanchnzel in the Rift.\n\n\"I get that, but I also get the impression that Onimiril's finding the answers he wants to find. Sometimes, a riddle is just a riddle.\n\nAt least his destination was clear enough. Hopefully the box is still in that Dwarven ruin.\"\n\nYou think the box is just a toy?\n\n\"I don't know. It's not like I've ever laid eyes on the thing. I just don't see how some hunk of Dwarven junk can be worth everything these two have sacrificed.\n\nIf we do find it, and I start going crazy, do me a favor and smash the fetching thing.\"\n\nWhen you arrive outside Avanchnzel, Mirri will explain her feelings on the Dwemer field:\n\n\"I don't much care for Dwarven ruins. It's an over-saturated field of study and full of more speculation and theory than established fact.\n\nSay what you will about Daedra, they're more predictable than you think. Even Sheogorath.\"\n\nOnce inside the ruin:\n\n\"Onimiril's writings said he brought the puzzle box here for some kind of ritual. Considering he was ousted from the Mages Guild, let's assume whatever he was doing was bad news.\"\n\nIn one of the chambers, Mirri will spot something:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"B'vehk … there!\"\n\nYou will find the large golden Puzzle Box, surrounded by the bodies of Dead Mages.\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Something tells me Onimiril's theory didn't pan out. Maybe be gentle with that box.\"\n\nMirri will be slightly concerned when you pick up the puzzle box:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Feeling all right? No all consuming desire to solve the unknowable mystery? Great, let's get out of here.\"\n\nSpeaking to Mirri after picking up the box:\n\n\"The great mystery of where the fetching puzzle box vanished off to is the only one I care to solve. Let's get that damned thing out of here and be done with it as soon as possible.\"\n\nOnce you have left the ruins, Mirri will be happy to leave:\n\nMirri Elendis: \"Glad to be out of there. Dwarf ruins are too hot and humid for my liking. At least Stonefall's is a dry heat.\"\n\nTalk to her to see what she wants to do now:\n\n\"I can't say I understand what all the fuss was about. It's a box. A fancy box, but a box none the less. Hard to imagine that this piece of fetching garbage has caused my family so much anguish.\n\nI'll be happy to bury it.\"\n\nWhat do we do next?\n\n\"I'll send word to my mother to meet us in Othrenis. We will deliver it to my family's plot and hopefully she'll find some closure with my bull netch of a grandfather.\"\n\nDo you think they'll reconcile?\n\n\"My granddad doesn't deserve mom's devotion, or forgiveness, but if it frees her of her guilt and obligations, she'll be safe and I'll be happy.\n\nCome on, let's not tempt fate by lingering with that thing.\"\n\nOnce you return to Stonefalls, Mirri wants to make sure you got it secured:\n\n\"Don't you dare lose that thing or I'll throttle you.\"\n\nAt the Elendis Family Plot, Irenni will arrive and walk up to shrine:\n\nIrenni Elendis: \"Mirri? Is that you? It had better not be another skeleton!\"\n\nMirri Elendis: \"We're here mom, and we've brought granddad's puzzle box. Would you lay it on the shrine for her?\"\n\nWhen you place the puzzle cube, Bralen will be summoned and you can witness the uncomfortable family reunion:\n\nIrenni Elendis: \"Father.\"\n\nBralen Elendis: \"You finally did your duty. Or rather your daughter and some n'wah did. Success—once removed—is so very like you.\"\n\nIrenni Elendis: \"All you've ever cared about was what I could do for you. Well, this is the last favor.\"\n\nMirri Elendis: \"That goes for us as well.\"\n\nYou can then talk to Bralen as Mirri has no desire to speak to him:\n\n\"Go on and talk to my grandfather, if you like. Maybe he'll actually show you some gratitude. I've got nothing to say to him.\"\n\nBralen is dismissive of his family's efforts to retrieve the cube and does not feel the need to reconcile with them. Mirri and Bralen exchange final words:\n\nBralen Elendis: \"You've set a poor example for your daughter. Always putting your whims before the good of the house.\"\n\nMirri Elendis: \"You can stuff the fetching house. Our family is more than just your legacy. Come on, mom. We're wasting our breath.\"\n\nYou can then talk to Mirri:\n\n\"Damn ancestors. If they want to make such a big deal of us paying our respects, they could put more effort into paying them back.\"\n\nHe certainly knows how to hold a grudge.\n\n\"Grudges and curses are Dunmeri traditions dating back to the Anticipations. Just because they're old doesn't make them good.\n\nI'm happy to leave all that to rot with granddad and his stupid gold brick, but it looks like mom is willing to forgive.\"\n\nYou think your mother will be content with how things turned out?\n\n\"She has nothing to regret. She did everything she could. That damn box was the last excuse that could be made for why they were estranged. If they still can't make up after this, granddad's just a fetching ashhole.\n\nEither way, she'll be fine.\"\n\nDo you want some time with her?\n\n\"No, we should give her and granddad some space. They have a lot to catch up on, assuming they don't just start cursing each other out.\n\nWe've done our part. Let's get back to saving the world, or whatever.\"\n\nIf you leave the conversation before turning in the quest, and return back talking to her, she will say this instead:\n\n\"Hmph, well, I guess Red Mountain can freeze over.\"\n\nDo you want some time with your mother?\n\nSame dialogue for quest completion\n\nAfter completing the quest and talking to Mirri:\n\n\"If you keep helping us out like this, mom's liable to adopt you, for which I apologize ahead of time.\"\n\nHeroes of Blackwood[edit]\n\nMirri only appears during this quest if you have completed the Treasured Comrade achievement. She will not appear if she is the active companion. Speaking to Mirri at the party:\n\nLiam Elendis survived: Liam Elendis is dead:\n\n\"You should have seen the look on Liam's face when I invited him to this. There, look, you can still see the leftover wide-eyed disbelief! I can hardly believe it myself.\"\n\nThe life of an adventurer is never dull.\n\n\"Isn't that the truth. Of course, exciting for me is exploring an old ruin and hoping I find more treasures than traps, not battling the hordes of Mehrunes-fetching-Dagon over the fate of the world. I was not prepared for the latter.\"\n\nConsidering retiring?\n\n\"Not a chance, f'lah. Today I learned that's something I can do. And next time, I'll be better prepared. But try not to let that intimidate you.\"\n\n\"I wish Liam could have been here to see this. He always looked up to me, even if he'd hate to admit it. I can just see him standing here wide-eyed and dumbfounded over the whole affair.\n\nI miss him.\"\n\nany other differences in dialogue\n\nUnverified[edit]\n\nMirri may have the following dialogue when doing the quest, The Light of Knowledge [verification needed — see ]:\n\n\"I can't believe you just waltz up to a god for a bit of conversation like it's nothing. I don't know whether to be impressed or tell the ordinators.\"\n\n\"I don't know if they call Lord Seht the Father of Mysteries because of his skill at unraveling them or because no one can figure him out.\"\n\n\"Well, what did he say?

You don't come by those too often.\n\nThat should fetch a fair fetching price!\n\nWhen the player loots a chest/safebox:\n\nLooks like you're buying at the next pub, f'lah!\n\nFinders keepers, as they say.\n\nA nice little present from Vehk, eh?\n\nWhen the player harvests a node:\n\nCan never have enough of that.\n\nNice haul!\n\nNothing wrong with a little opportunistic harvesting.\n\nWhen the player loots a Heavy Sack:\n\nQuite a bounty! Glad I don't have to carry it.\n\nLucky fetcher. I only ever seem to find musty grain and spuds.\n\nWhen the player steals an item:\n\nWell played, master thief.\n\nI saw nothing.\n\nYou'll take anything that isn't tied down, won't you?\n\nIt's only stealing if you get caught, right?\n\nWhen the player is caught stealing an item:\n\nHey, warn me before you're going to be a fetching s'wit!\n\nWhen you pay your bounty to a fence:\n\nThe coast is clear. Finally.\n\nWhen the player loots a Thieves Trove\n\nGood eye! I never would have spotted that!\n\nThat's why I use a bank.\n\nWhen the player successfully excavates an antiquity:\n\nInteresting how much clutter people had thousands of years ago, isn't it? Guess some things never change.\n\nWell this seems a lot less deadly than delving. Why did mom never suggest this to me?\n\nAnother find? I hope it's something interesting!\n\nThere's an old saying about those who forget history. I don't remember it, but it's really good.\n\nWho knew you could be so patient and careful?\n\nIt really is remarkable how much knowledge is just resting below the dirt.\n\nWhen the player reads a book:\n\nI didn't know you were interested in that genre? I'll have to remember that.\n\nBringing a book for travel is well worth the pack space. Shame they're so heavy.\n\nI like reading too, you know. If you ever need an excuse to get me something.\n\nWhen completing a Fighters Guild daily quest:\n\nI'd really love to study those Dolmens, if they'd ever stop getting pulled into Coldharbour.\n\nAll these Daedra appearing would be great for my studies if we didn't always have to be killing them.\n\nAnother day, another dolmen, eh?\n\nWhen completing relic quests for Numani-Rasi:\n\nMaybe we should hire you into the family business. You've got a knack for this.\n\nDealing with Ashlanders is dangerous, but they really are a great source for my Daedra research.\n\nI won't tell the Ordinators if you won't.\n\nWhen entering a city or town:\n\nWhat do you say we try some of the local fare? I'm famished.\n\nSome people don't like the bustle of cities, but I come from a big family, so it reminds me of home.\n\nI can't wait to take a load off at the inn.\n\nWhen entering the Clockwork City:\n\nSotha Sil built this place and everything in it. Except the people. Well, maybe even a few of them too by the look.\n\nI wonder how the Tribunal Temple feels about the Clockwork Apostles? Actually, I wonder if they even know they exist. We're in a whole other world.\n\nI wonder why Lord Seht made so many creations that imitate life? Because he could? To better understand them? You'd probably just walk up and ask.\n\nWhen near a striking locale:\n\nTraveling with you isn't a tour, it's a tale!\n\nWhat a sight! I can't wait to write home about this.\n\nI bet this place is full of interesting history. I should try looking it up later.\n\nWhen near a delve:\n\nI hope we find more than trouble here.\n\nThis looks ripe for adventure. Maybe a tad overripe.\n\nLet's not get separated. I'd rather not be alone in this place.\n\nWhen near a dolmen, Abyssal Geyser, Harrowstorm or Volcanic Vent:\n\nThere's trouble brewing here. Stay alert!\n\nSomething's not right here. Be ready for a fight.\n\nCareful! We're headed into troublesome territory!\n\nWhen entering a Daedric ruin:\n\nNow here's a place I can really get some study done. Or killed. Either really.\n\nIf you brought me here because you knew I'd like it. Well done.\n\nSee, if I'd taken up trade like my little sister, the most interesting places I'd visit would be banks.\n\nWhen entering the Bards College in Solitude:\n\nAre these real instruments? There must be a reason you don't hear many of them these days.\n\nWhen entering the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary:\n\nI shouldn't be here. And I definitely don't want to be!\n\nIf you're trying to introduce me to your family, I have no interest in your siblings!\n\nThere are literally skeletons walking around! Why would you want to live here!\n\nThe Morag Tong are bad enough, but at least they don't kill for fun!\n\nWhen viewing the completed model of Vvardenfell in the Library of Vivec:\n\nI can't believe they actually completed a scale model of the entire island. It's so detailed!\n\nI can't get over how meticulous all this is. I'd never have the patience for it. I suppose that's what makes it all the more impressive.\n\nBuilding such an accurate model must have been a huge undertaking. Well, a very small, huge undertaking.\n\nWhen viewing the incomplete model of Vvardenfell in the Library of Vivec:\n\nWhat's this? Some kind of exhibit? Looks incomplete.\n\nWhen viewing the completed Vault of Moawita collection:\n\nI know the Vault of Moawita is supposed to be keeping all these cursed objects from doing harm, but is gathering them all here really safe?\n\nThe Vault of Moawita. This is where the Psijic Order keeps the most dangerous of items locked away!\n\nWhen viewing the incomplete Vault of Moawita collection:\n\nI've heard of this place. The Vault of Moawita. But it shouldn't be empty! Something's very wrong.\n\nWhen in the Thieves Den if Kari's Hit List is complete:\n\nDid you steal all this stuff while I was with you? That really would be impressive.\n\nThis hit list looks more like a pranksters planner than a thief's to-dos. Could be fun though.\n\nWhen in the Thieves Den if Kari's Hit List is incomplete:\n\nFor a Thieves Guild there isn't much of a treasure trove. Maybe you could steal something to gussy it up.\n\nWhen in the House of Histories if the Rithana-di-Renada is complete:\n\nThe House of Histories! I was told not to miss this! It is the home of the beautiful and priceless mural known as Rithana-di-Renada. In common speech, \"The Song of Kingdoms.\"\n\nAn ancient mural chronicling the original sixteen united kingdoms of Elsweyr. It's quite remarkable.\n\nWhen in the House of Histories if the Rithana-di-Renada is incomplete:\n\nThis House of Histories seems to be in need of some talented collectors.\n\nWhen in the Senchal Palace if the tapestry is complete:\n\nI would have loved to see that tapestry when it was new, but the restoration really is beautiful.\n\nKhajiit of the Moons. It's one of the great treasures of Elsweyr. Tragic that it was so badly damaged, but you can tell it was restored with great care.\n\nWhen in the Senchal Palace if the tapestry is incomplete:\n\nSenchal was one of the richest and most historic kingdoms in Tamriel. It's painful to see it reduced to such a state.\n\nWhen in the House of Orsimer Glories if the collection is complete:\n\nSo Orsinium really got Orcs to care about history? That is impressive.\n\nSo many tributes to violence. Did you know Old Orcish has no word for patience? The closest word literally means sedated.\n\nYou know that Dark Elves and Orcs are both cursed races? Dunmer just don't dwell on it constantly.\n\nWhen in the House of Orsimer Glories if the collection is incomplete:\n\nThe House of Orsimer Glories? Is it a joke that it's practically empty?\n\nAfter completing a dolmen/harrowstorm/geyser:\n\nWell, that was intense.\n\nThat was truly vile.\n\nWe drove them back!\n\nIt's a route [sic]!\n\nRight back to Oblivion, or wherever they came from!\n\nAfter killing a goblin:\n\nUgh, Goblins. They eat anything you know? Anything.\n\nSpawn of Malak's putrid feces.\n\nGods, the smell! I'd rather fight bog blights.\n\nNever met a Goblin that didn't deserve that. Not one.\n\nThese little fetchers will infest anything if you let them run wild.\n\nAfter killing a snake:\n\nI. Hate. Snakes.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, all snakes are poisonous!\n\nWhen the player crafts an alcoholic beverage:\n\nMy favorite cure for low-spirits!\n\nYou are going to let me try that, right?\n\nWhen near a harbor:\n\nPlease, anything but a boat!\n\nUgh, I'm getting ill just thinking about taking a ship.\n\nWhen near a cooking fire:\n\nSmoke, ash, and fire. Just like home.\n\nI don't suppose we have anything to cook?\n\nI miss roasting pupal scribs over a fire. So sweet and airy, with a hint of crunch.\n\nWhen the player is idle for a long time:\n\nThere's stopping to smell the flowers and then there's taking root.\n\nAre we waiting for someone? Some thing? Just because?\n\nIt we're just going to wait around, let's play a game or something.\n\nLost in thought, or just lost?\n\n<Idle humming.>\n\nWhat's going on in that head of yours?\n\nDunmer are long lived, but we can die of boredom.\n\nI can see why mom has been so reluctant to settle in at home. There's too much to this world to spend our time on it in one place.\n\nWhen summoning specific Non-Combat Pets\n\nHello, little one!\n\nWhere in Tamriel did you get that one?\n\nI had a pony guar when I was little. Pon pon. She was adorable.\n\nThere's my favorite! What a sweetheart!\n\nA Daedric pet? I wonder, do Daedra keep pets? And I don't just mean things they've enslaved.\n\nDon't tell the other pets, but I like you the best!\n\nThis one makes me laugh! That's a very desirable trait.\n\nI wasn't aware you could tame Daedric creatures. Not without sorcery anyway.\n\nAfter losing a Duel\n\nForget that fetcher. Bet they were cheating anyway.\n\nDid that hurt? It looked like it hurt. You … want a hug?\n\nAfter winning a Duel\n\nAs street fights go, that one was pretty good!\n\nHave you sufficiently asserted your dominance? Can we get back to business now?\n\nAfter talking to Sotha Sil\n\nWell, what did he say? Some inscrutable wisdom beyond mortal comprehension?\n\nI don't know if they call Lord Seht the Father of Mysteries because of his skill at unravelling them or because no one can figure him out.\n\nI can't believe you just waltz up to a god for a bit of conversation like it's nothing. I don't know whether to be impressed or tell the ordinators.\n\nTravel Lines:\n\nI do love seeing so much of Tamriel. I wish less of it was trying to kill me, but at least it makes life interesting.\n\nThis is the spot I've been looking for.\n\nI've been wanting to visit here. Spare a moment?\n\nWhen harvesting a torchbug or butterfly:\n\nIf you're going to kill bugs, at least kill fetcher flies.\n\nThere has got to be a better source for your alchemy practice.\n\nWhen using the Blade of Woe:\n\nI'm going to be ill. I can't even look at you.\n\nWhen applying a Polymorph:\n\nI knew it! This is the way you really look, isn't it?\n\nWhen summoned for the first time after completion of Treasured Comrade achievement:\n\n\"My family deals in collectibles, and this reminded me of you, so—here.\"\n\nIf the player rides into terrain on a mount:\n\n\"Who taught you to ride? a book?\"\n\nFurnishing[edit]\n\nThe intrepid explorer, Mirri Elendis, needs a break from her irksome family. With thrilling tales and a sailor's mouth, she's sure to impress! After adding Mirri to your home, you can set her on a path, plus you and your visitors can speak with her.\n\nMirri Elendis\n\nFurnishing Type Houseguest Acquired From Complete Dead Weight\n\nYou will earn the ability to have her as a houseguest once you've completed Dead Weight.\n\nHouseguest Dialogue[edit]\n\nWhen placed within your home, she will say one of the following lines when spoken to. They are a combination of lines heard from her environmental voice-overs and unique lines:\n\n\"What's on the docket today?\"\n\n\"How did you ever get through these long periods of quiet without me?\"\n\n\"There's an old saying about those who forget history. I don't remember it, but it's really good.\"\n\n\"What do you say we try some of the local fare? I'm famished.\"\n\n\"I love maps and old books. I can lose myself in a library or booksellers for days on end! I'm also a bit of an oenophile. It means I like wine. A lot.\"\n\n\"Miss me?\"\n\n\"I miss roasting pupal scribs over a fire. So sweet and airy, with a hint of crunch.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Some people don't like the bustle of cities, but I come from a big family, so it reminds me of home.\"\n\n\"Dealing with Ashlanders is dangerous, but they really are a great source for my Daedra research.\"\n\n\"I sometimes wonder what it must be like for Daedra. Going through their lives with no real sense of time passing them by. Where loss and death are annoying trivialities. No wonder they feel powerful, and hollow.\"\n\n\"I've had so many near death experiences since I met you. I really need to go make an offering to the Three before they think me ungrateful.\"\n\n\"Are we waiting for someone? Some thing? Just because?\"\n\n\"My dad's an antiquarian. He gave me an appreciation of cultural artifacts. Mom showed me how to find them. I prefer to treat such things with the respect they deserve.\"\n\n\"I can't stand Goblins. Or snakes. Or boats. They all make me want to retch, for different reasons. The less we deal with any of them, the better.\"\n\n\"I can see what mom has been so reluctant to settle in at home. There's too much to this world to spend our time on it in one place.\"\n\n\"Feeling chatty, are we?\"\n\n\"I don't suppose we have anything to cook?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't have had that last snack.\"\n\n\"<Idle humming.>\"\n\nCorrespondence[edit]\n\nOnce you reach maximum Rapport with Mirri Elendis, she will soon send you a letter along with an Ancient Anticipations Idol.\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nA Meet the Character segment was written about her.\n\nMirri Elendis is voiced by Erin Yvette.[1]\n\nLoremaster's Archive - The Clockwork City includes a question from Mirri being answered by Sotha Sil.\n\nBugs[edit]\n\nIf you and Mirri are mounted when you hand in one of Numani-Rasi's daily quests, it does not increase Mirri's rapport.\n\nMake sure you are not mounted when handing in quest.\n\nSometimes Numani-Rasi's quests do not give rapport at all, though all requirements are met and you're not mounted.\n\nMirri may not appear at the indicated location outside the vault. Reloading does not fix this. ?\n\nGallery[edit]\n\nPromotional render\n\nFeatured in a promotional render\n\nFeatured in a promotional render for 2024's Anniversary Jubilee, celebrating a decade of ESO"
