We sought to compare prevalence and determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) between tuberculosis patients in Baja California, Mexico, and Hispanic patients in California. Methods. Using data from Mexicoâs National TB Drug Resistance Survey (2008â2009) and California Department of Public Health TB case registry (2004â2009), we assessed differences in MDR-TB prevalence comparing (1) Mexicans in Baja California, (2) Mexico-born Hispanics in California, (3) US-born Hispanics in California, and (4) California Hispanics born elsewhere. Results. MDR-TB prevalence was 2.1% in Baja California patients, 1.6% in Mexico-born California patients, 0.4% in US-born California patients, and 2.7% in Hispanic California patients born elsewhere. In multivariate analysis, previous antituberculosis treatment was associated with MDR-TB (odds ratio [OR]â=â6.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]â=â3.34, 12.96); Mexico-born TB patients in California (ORâ=â5.08; 95% CIâ=â1.19, 21.75) and those born elsewhere (ORâ=â7.69; 95% CIâ=â1.71, 34.67) had greater odds of MDR-TB compared with US-born patients (reference category). Conclusions. Hispanic patients born outside the US or Mexico were more likely to have MDR-TB than were those born within these countries. Possible explanations include different levels of exposure to resistant strains and inadequate treatment.

The northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) breeds and haul-outs on islands and the mainland of Baja California, Mexico, and California, U.S.A. At the beginning of the 21st century, numbers of elephant seals in California are increasing, but the status of Baja California populations is unknown, and some data suggest they may be decreasing. We hypothesize that the elephant seal population of Baja California is experiencing a decline because the animals are not migrating as far south due to warming sea and air temperatures. Here we assessed population trends of the Baja California population, and climate change in the region. The numbers of northern elephant seals in Baja California colonies have been decreasing since the 1990s, and both the surface waters off Baja California and the local air temperatures have warmed during the last three decades. We propose that declining population sizes may be attributable to decreased migration towards the southern portions of the range in response to the observed temperature increases. Further research is needed to confirm our hypothesis; however, if true, it would imply that elephant seal colonies of Baja California and California are not demographically isolated which would pose challenges to environmental and management policies between Mexico and the United States.\n\nBald eagles nesting in Baja California\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHenny, Charles J.; Anderson, Daniel W.; Knoder, C.E.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nPublished records of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nesting in Baja California during the last 50 years are nonexistent to our knowledge, and few records exist prior to that time. Friedmann et al. (1950:61, Pac. Coast Avifauna 29) describe the distribution of Bald Eagles in Baja California as \"a scattering of pairs on both the Pacific and Gulf Sides.\" Nesting Bald Eagles were first reported by Bryant (1889, Proc. Calif. Acad. Sci. 2: 237-320), who found a pair on Isla Santa Margarita (24Â°25'N, 111Â°50'W; hereafter abbreviated as 2425-11150) and saw an adult on the \"estero\" north from Magdalena Bay (the region where one pair was seen in 1977). Other records were reviewed by Grinnell (1928, Univ. Calif. Publ. Zool. 32).\n\nA new species of Ceanothus from northern Baja California\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBoyd, Steve; Keeley, Jon E.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nCeanothus bolensis S. Boyd & J. Keeley is a new species in the subgenus Cerastes from northwestern Baja California, Mexico. It is well represented at elevations above 1000 m on Cerro Bola, a basaltic peak approximately 35 km south of the U.S./Mexican border. It is characterized by small, obovate to oblanceolate, cupped, essentially glabrous leaves with sparsely toothed margins, pale blue flowers, and globose fruits lacking horns. Principal components analysis on morphological traits shows it to be distinct from other members of Cerastes which are distributed away from the coast in southern California and Baja California, Mexico. These phenetic comparisons also suggest that Ceanothus otayensis should not be subsumed under C. crassifolius, as treated in the Jepson Manual, but rather should be retained at specific rank as well.\n\nVolcanic materials superconductivity in desert areas of the states of Sonora and Baja California\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHolguÃ­n, Aldo\n\n2017-01-01\n\nResearch was conducted to find materials in their natural state at room temperature and exhibit the effects of superconductivity in the volcanic region of deserts Altar in Sonora and Baja California Norte. 100 were collected at random samples of materials from different parts of the region and underwent tests to determine their electromagnetic parameters of electrical resistance, magnetism, temperature and conductivity. Only it has been found that the effects of superconductivity in them is only present at very low temperatures corroborating what has been done in other investigations, however no indication that there is a material or combination of materials that can produce the effects of superconductivity other temperatures so it is suggested to continue the search for such materials and / or develop a technique at room temperature to allow mimic the behavior of atoms when superconductivity occurs at.\n\nCrustal Structure of Southern Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, and its Margins\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGonzalez, A.; Robles-Vazquez, L. N.; Requena-Gonzalez, N. A.; Fletcher, J.; Lizarralde, D.; Kent, G.; Harding, A.; Holbrook, S.; Umhoefer, P.; Axen, G.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nData from 6 deep 2D multichannel seismic (MCS) lines, 1 wide-angle seismic transect and gravity were used to investigate the crustal structure and stratigraphy of the southern Baja California peninsula and its margins. An array of air guns was used as seismic source shooting each 50 m. Each signal was recorded during 16 s by a 6 km long streamer with 480 channels and a spacing of 12.5 m. Seismic waves were also recorded by Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) in the Pacific and the Gulf of California and by portable seismic instruments onshore southern Baja California. MCS data were conventionally processed, to obtain post-stack time-migrated seismic sections. We used a direct method for the interpretation of the wide-angle data, including ray tracing and travel times calculation. In addition to the gravity data recorded onboard, satellite and land public domain data were also used in the gravity modeling. The combined MCS, wide-angle and gravity transect between the Magdalena microplate to the center of Farallon basin in the Gulf of California, crossing the southern Baja California Peninsula to the north of La Paz, allows to verify the existence of the Magdalena microplate under Baja California. We have also confirmed an extensional component of the Tosco-Abreojos fault zone and we have calculated crustal thicknesses. We have also observed the continuation to the south of the Santa Margarita detachment. The MCS seismic sections show a number of fault scarps, submarine canyons and grabens and horsts associated to normal faults offshore southern Baja California peninsula. The normal displacement observed in the Tosco-Abreojos fault zone and some basins in the continental platform, as well as the presence of faulted acoustic basement blocks, evidence that not all extension was accommodated by the Gulf Extensional Province during the middle to late Miocene. Part of the extension was (and is) accommodated in the Baja California Pacific margin. This confirms the observations\n\nProceedings of the Binational Conference on Libraries in California and Baja California (1st, Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico, January 13-14, 1984) = Memorias de la Primera Conferencia Binacional de Bibliotecas de las Californias.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAyala, Marta Stiefel, Ed.; And Others\n\nThis document includes the text of presentations given at the First Binational Conference on Libraries in California and Baja California, as well as minutes from four roundtables held at the conference.

A Missing Piece to Reconstruct the Paleoposition of Baja California\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchaaf, P. E.; Pompa, V.; Hernandez, T.; Weber, B.; Solis, G.; Villanueva, D.; Perez-Venzor, J.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nPaleopositions for southern Baja California peninsula have yielded controversial models over the past 30 years. Mainly based on paleomagnetic data many hypotheses place Baja at lower paleolatitudes in front of southern Mexico or Central America with subsequent northward translations. Other models suggest minor, if any, northward displacements with respect to continental Mexico combined with clockwise rotations. Lithological, geochemical, and geochronological similarities for southern Baja California and Puerto Vallarta (western Mexico Pacific margin) igneous rocks seem to confirm the latter model. To further prove this model we have mapped and collected rocks from Maria Madre, the largest island of the Islas Marias archipelago, located in the mouth of the Gulf of California. In an area of only 145 square kilometers, metamorphic basements rocks (ortho and migmatitic gneisses), highly deformed metasediments, granitoids, acid to intermediate volcanic sequences, and a cover with gently folded marine sediments are exposed. The basement complex with gneisses and metasediments, including garnet-bearing paragneiss and calc silicates, as well as the granodioritic-tonalitic intrusives display an extraordinary accordance with similar units observed in the Los Cabos Block (LCB) of Baja California Sur. Furthermore, U-Pb zircon ages of 162 and 170 Ma for the basement gneisses and of 80 Ma for the granitoids have been reported also from the LCB. Additionally, upper Cretaceous intrusive ages are well known from the Puerto Vallarta batholith in Jalisco and Nayarit, mainland Mexico. Geochemical and isotopic data as well as Nd model ages confirm a magmatic consanguinity of LCB, Islas Marias, and Puerto Vallarta granitoids. The volcanic units of Maria Madre Island include ignimbrites and effusive dacitic-rhyolithic rocks, which can be correlated to the Sierra Madre Occidental province and the ComundÃº Formation of Baja California. Age determinations are under work to confirm this\n\nPlate tectonic constraints on the cessation of subduction beneath the Baja California peninsula, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStock, J. M.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nI review published models, existing global plate tectonic data and published marine geophysical observations west of Baja California to assess the timing and conditions under which subduction ceased along the W margin of Baja California. The relative motion of the Farallon microplate fragments can be reconstructed using Pacific- North America global plate motions (from the Pacific-Antarctica-Nubia-North America plate circuit) added to the local velocities of the microplates with respect to the Pacific plate. Because the Pacific plate was moving obliquely away from North America, the time at which subduction stopped has often been taken to be the time at which the microplates joined the Pacific plate (the ages of dead spreading centers preserved west of North America on the Pacific plate). The timing of cessation of subduction west of what is now northern Baja California is not recorded by a dead ridge offshore but is inferred to be coincident with extension and rotation in the continental borderland (early-middle Miocene). The Arguello microplate stopped spreading relative to the Pacific plate at about 13 Ma, providing a younger age limit on the cessation of subduction in the sector N of the Shirley transform fault. The time of cessation of spreading of the Magdalena-Pacific (M-P) ridge has been proposed by Michaud et al. (2006 Geology) to be as young as 8 Ma. However, the clockwise rotation of the M-P ridge before it ceased, and its inferred slow spreading rate away from the Pacific plate implies transcurrent motion with virtually no convergence between the Magdalena microplate and the North America plate during the last stages of activity of the M-P ridge. Subduction can occur by motion of forearc fragments without any convergence of the major bounding plates (e.g., the modern South Shetland Trench), but this may be ruled out for Baja California due to the small spatial scale of the microplates compared to the scale of the stable Baja California peninsula block\n\nPaleomagnetic Quantification of Neogene Block Rotations within an Active Transtensional Plate Boundary, Baja California, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWeber, J.; Umhoefer, P. J.; PÃ©rez Venzor, J. A.; Bachtadse, V.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nCompared to oceanic plate boundaries which are generally narrow zones of deformation, continental plate boundaries appear as widespread areas with complex and poorly understood kinematics. Motion of crustal blocks within these âdiffuse plate boundariesâ causes rather small-scale lithospheric deformation within the boundary zone, while the main plates behave more rigid. Complex deformation patterns of interacting terranes separated by a variety of active faults are the consequence. To study the dynamic implications of boundary zone deformation, the southern part of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico (Baja) has been chosen as target for a detailed paleomagnetic study. In combination with geodetic measurements it is tried to characterize rigid block rotations and temporal changes in rotation rates. Up to now, little paleomagnetic work directed toward vertical axis rotations has been done in Baja California, despite its location in a major active transtensional zone. To address this problem, a total of 501 cores from 63 sites in the southern part of Baja - including sites on San JosÃ© Island, San Francisco Island and Cerralvo Island - has been taken from volcanic and sedimentary rocks covering the last 25 million years in time. The analysis of paleomagnetic declinations and comparison to coeval data from North America and stable areas of Baja California allow evaluating the long-term kinematics of the region and the effects of oblique-rifting in the Gulf of California to the east. Nearly all sampled sites indicate vertical axis rotation up to 30-40 degrees with an average of about 20-25 degrees. Depending on the location these rotations have been either clockwise or counter-clockwise and are correlated with the opening of the Gulf of California and the translation of the Baja California peninsula to the North. Results of the paleomagnetic investigation are compared to geodetic data of the last few years in order to address the problem how strain is partitioned\n\nHurricane Douglas south of Baja California\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nAs recently as July 23, 2002, Hurricane Douglas was a category 2 hurricane, with winds as high as 90 knots (over 100 miles per hour). As of July 24, Douglas had dropped back to category 1 status as it moved away from the Baja California Peninsula in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The storm is predicted to continue moving westward over the next 24 hours and should weaken as it moves over cooler waters. This image was acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite on July 23, 2002.\n\nUranium-series ages of marine terraces, La Paz Peninsula, Baja California Sur, Mexico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSirkin, L.; Szabo, B. J.; Padilla, G.A.; Pedrin, S.A.; Diaz, E.R.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nUranium-series dating of coral samples from raised marine terrace deposits between 1.5 and 10 m above sea level in the La Paz Peninsula area, Baja California Sur, yielded ages between 123 ka and 138 ka that are in agreement with previously reported results. The stratigraphy and ages of marine units near the El Coyote Arroyo indicate the presence of two high stands of the sea during the last interglacial or oxygen isotope substage 5e at about 140 ka and 123 ka. Accepting 5 m for the sea level during the last interglacial transgression, we calculate average uplift rates for the marine terraces of about ???70 mm/ka and 40 mm/ka. These slow rates of uplift indicate a relative stability of the La Paz peninsula area for the past 140 000 years. In contrast, areas of Baja California affected by major faultf experienced higher rates of uplift. Rockwell et al. (1987) reported vertical uplift rates of 180 to 300 mm/ka at Punta Banda within the Aqua Blanea fault zone in northern Baja California. ?? 1990 Springer-Verlag.\n\nCoastal management at Ojo de Liebre, Baja California Sur\n\nTreesearch\n\nFrederico Salinas-Zavala; Alfredo Ortega-Rubio; Diego Valez-Zamudio; Aradit Castelanos-Vera\n\n2000-01-01\n\nWe analyzed the biotic, abiotic, and human components interacting at the coastal zone of the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon, Baja California Sur, Mexico.

Such negative values are uncharacteristic of the site latitude near the sea level. Altitude effects do not explain the isotope data. Tropical depressions originating along the Pacific coast of North America yield rain with isotopic depletion; rain from these weather systems in southern Arizona commonly has Î´18O values<-10â° in comparison with amount-weighted mean summer and fall rain at -6â°. Isotope data indicate hurricane rain as the predominant source of recharge in southern Baja California, where named tropical depressions bring large rains (>50âmm) at least once every 2 to 3 years, and along the Pacific coast between Jalisco and Oaxaca.

While there are limitations to the interpretation of historic data, we observed generally similar trends of reduced total bivalve species richness, losses of relatively large and/or deeper-dwelling natives, and gains of relatively small, surface dwelling introduced species across the southern California estuaries, despite fairly distinct bivalve communities. A nearly 50-year absence of bivalves from two wetlands surveyed in a Baja California estuary continued. A combination of site history and current characteristics (e.g., location, depth) likely contributes to maintenance of distinct communities, and both episodic and gradual environmental changes likely contribute to within-estuary temporal shifts (or absences). We highlight future research needed to determine mechanisms underlying patterns so that we can better predict responses of bivalve communities to future scenarios, including climate change and restoration.

This work develops the slab-window concept and the tectonic and magmatic effects of the slab-free geometry on the Cordilleran system. Because no ridge-subduction was proposed to have occurred south of 30Â°N (Lonsdale, 1991), question arose as to whether a slab-free area also extended beneath southern Baja California. The Chile triple junction area (46Â°S) is a well-studied example of active ridge-subduction. This area exhibits the effects of slab-free development on the time distribution of magmatism and tectonism within the overriding continental block. Moreover, recent fieldwork conducted along the southern Baja California volcanic belt supports that slab melting under relatively shallow and warm conditions occurred during Upper Miocene time. When combined with the Miocene-Recent volcanic record of Baja California, a parallel drawn between the Chile and Mexico triple junction areas substantiates slab window development beneath southern Baja California peninsula during the past 12-10 m.y. The FAMEX cruise of the R/V Atalante (March-April 2002) was conducted to better constrain the ridge-subduction history in the area off southern Baja California. More than 5000 miles of swath bathymetry, magnetic, gravity record and 6 channels seismic reflection profiles were realized from 29Â°N to 22Â°30'N. Also, three magnetic deep-tow profiles were performed to provide a higher resolution of the magnetic signal and age of the corresponding oceanic crust. The study area displays two distinct morphological areas: (1) north of 27Â°30'N, the Guadalupe rift is a deep trough that trends roughly N-S. On either sides of the rift, the neighboring oceanic fabric trends parallel to it; (2) south of 27Â°N, the oceanic fabric is much more complicated and strongly contrasts with the regular fabric\n\nGEMINI-9 - EARTH SKY - NORTHWESTERN MEXICO, BAJA CALIFORNIA\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1966-06-05\n\nS66-38070 (5 June 1966) --- Northwestern Mexico as seen from the Gemini-9A spacecraft during its 32nd revolution of Earth.

An apparent transform relationship between strike-slip and normal faulting is illustrated by the overlapping vertical photographs of northern Baja California. The active Agua Blanca right-lateral strike-slip fault trends east-southeastward to end at the north end of the Valle San Felipe and Valle Chico. The uplands of the high Sierra San Pedro Martir are a low-relief surface deformed by young faults, monoclines, and warps, which mostly produce west-facing steps and slopes; the topography is basically structural. The Sierra Cucapas of northeasternmost Baja California and the Colorado River delta of northwesternmost Sonora are broken by northwest-trending strike-slip faults. A strike-slip fault is inferred to trend northward obliquely from near Cabo San Lucas to La Paz, thence offshore until it comes ashore again as the Bahia Concepcion strike-slip fault.\n\nRemote sensing studies and morphotectonic investigations in an arid rift setting, Baja California, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEl-Sobky, Hesham Farouk\n\nThe Gulf of California and its surrounding land areas provide a classic example of recently rifted continental lithosphere. The recent tectonic history of eastern Baja California has been dominated by oblique rifting that began at Ë12 Ma. Thus, extensional tectonics, bedrock lithology, long-term climatic changes, and evolving surface processes have controlled the tectono-geomorphological evolution of the eastern part of the peninsula since that time. In this study, digital elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) from Baja California were corrected and enhanced by replacing artifacts with real values that were derived using a series of geostatistical techniques. The next step was to generate accurate thematic geologic maps with high resolution (15-m) for the entire eastern coast of Baja California. The main approach that we used to clearly represent all the lithological units in the investigated area was objectoriented classification based on fuzzy logic theory. The area of study was divided into twenty-two blocks; each was classified independently on the basis of its own defined membership function. Overall accuracies were 89.6%, indicating that this approach was highly recommended over the most conventional classification techniques. The third step of this study was to assess the factors that affected the geomorphologic development along the eastern side of Baja California, where thirty-four drainage basins were extracted from a 15-m-resolution absolute digital elevation model (DEM). Thirty morphometric parameters were extracted; these parameters were then reduced using principal component analysis (PCA). Cluster analysis classification defined four major groups of basins. We extracted stream length-gradient indices, which highlight the differential rock uplift that has occurred along fault escarpments bounding the basins. Also, steepness and concavity indices were extracted for bedrock channels within the thirty-four drainage basins.

R.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nLate Miocene to Recent arc-related magmatism occurs in Baja California, Mexico despite the cessation of plate subduction along its western margin at ~12.5 Ma. It includes calcalkaline and K-rich andesites, tholeiitic basalts and basaltic andesites, alkalic basalts similar to many ocean island basalts (OIB), magnesian and basaltic andesites with adakitic affinity (bajaiites), adakites, and Nb-enriched basalts (NEB). A popular model for the close spatial and temporal association of adakite (plus bajaiite) and NEB in Baja California is these are due to melting of the subducted Farallon/Cocos plate, which in turn is caused by the influx of hot asthenospheric mantle through a window created in the subducted slab directly beneath the Baja California peninsula [e.g., Benoit, M. et. al. (2002) J. Geol. 110, 627-648; Calmus, T. et al. (2003) Lithos 66, 77-105]. Here I propose an alternative model for the cause of post-subduction magmatism in Baja California in particular and origin of adakite-NEB rock association in general. The complicated tectonic configuration of the subducting Farallon/Cocos plate and westward motion of the North American continent caused western Mexico to override the hot, upwelling Pacific mantle that was decoupled from the spreading centers abandoned west of Baja California. The upwelling asthenosphere is best manifested east of the peninsula, beneath the Gulf of California, and is most probably due to a tear or window in the subducted slab there. The upwelling asthenosphere is compositionally heterogeneous and sends materials westward into the mantle wedge beneath the peninsula. These materials provide sources for post-subduction tholeiitic and alkalic magmas. Portions of tholeiitic magmas directly erupted at the surface produce tholeiitic lavas, but some get ponded beneath the crust. Re-melting and/or high-pressure fractional crystallization of the ponded tholeiitic magmas generate adakitic rocks. Alkalic magmas directly erupted at the surface\n\nMission and modern citrus species diversity of Baja California Peninsula cases\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nThe spring-fed mission oases of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico, hold several species, varieties and unique hybrids of heritage citrus, which may represent valuable genetic resources.

A whole genome sequencing strategy was used to obtain the molecular fingerprints of 172 isolates of M. bovis obtained from Baja California, Mexico; 155 isolates were from cattle and 17 isolates were from humans. Spoligotypes were characterized in silico and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences between the isolates were evaluated. A total of 12 M. bovis spoligotype patterns were identified in cattle and humans. Two predominant spoligotypes patterns were seen in both cattle and humans: SB0145 and SB1040. The SB0145 spoligotype represented 59% of cattle isolates (n=91) and 65% of human isolates (n=11), while the SB1040 spoligotype represented 30% of cattle isolates (n=47) and 30% of human isolates (n=5). When evaluating SNP differences, the human isolates were intimately intertwined with the cattle isolates. All isolates from humans had spoligotype patterns that matched those observed in the cattle isolates, and all human isolates shared common ancestors with cattle in Baja California based on SNP analysis. This suggests that most human tuberculosis caused by M. bovis in Baja California is derived from M. bovis circulating in Baja California cattle. These results reinforce the importance of bovine tuberculosis surveillance and control in this region. Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

In particular, historic barriers to movement should have affected multiple species and, thus, result in a pattern of concordant intraspecific genetic divisions among species. A striking example of such comparative phylogeography is the recent observation that populations of many small mammals and reptiles living on the Baja California peninsula have a large genetic break between northern and southern peninsular populations. In the present study, I demonstrate that five species of near-shore fishes living on the Baja coastline of the Gulf of California share this genetic pattern. The simplest explanation for this concordant genetic division within both terrestrial and marine vertebrates is that the Baja Peninsula was fragmented by a Plio-Pleistocene marine seaway and that this seaway posed a substantial barrier to movement for near-shore fishes. For some fish species, the signal of this vicariance in mtDNA has been eroded by gene flow and is not evident with classic, equilibrium measures of population structure. Yet, significant divisions are apparent in coalescent analyses that jointly estimate divergence with gene flow. The genetic divisions within Gulf of California fishes also coincide with recognized biogeographic regions based on fish community composition and several environmental factors. It is likely that adaptation to regional environments and present-day oceanographic circulation limit gene exchange between biogeographic regions and help maintain evidence of past vicariance.\n\nNASA Satellite Imagery Shows Sparse Population of Region Near Baja, California Earthquake\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2010-04-09\n\nThis image from NASA Terra spacecraft shows where a magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck in Mexico Baja, California at shallow depth along the principal plate boundary between the North American and Pacific plates on April 4, 2010.\n\nGeophysical characterization of subaerial hydrothermal manifestations in Punta Banda, Baja California, Mexico.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFlores-Marquez, L.; Prol-Ledesma, R. M.; Arango, C.; Canet, C.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nImportant growth of population in Baja California Peninsula has triggered the need for energy and fresh water. The most sustainable possibility for increasing the availability of fresh water is the use of renewable energy sources in desalination plants. The abundance of geothermal manifestations in the peninsula provides a reliable energy source for desalination purposes. Geothermal development of the Baja California Peninsula dates from the 70's, when the Cerro Prieto geothermal field started producing electricity. Two important cities, Tijuana and Ensenada, are located in the north-western area of Baja California. The city of Ensenada has a desalination plant that is due to be replaced and the geothermal resources of the area could be an option for the new desalination plant. Punta Banda, a region near Ensenada, was specially investigated to determine its geothermal potential. Subaerial springs and the submarine vents were sampled and studied in this work, also geological and geochemical studies were performed, moreover geoelectrical surveys were accomplished to characterize the hydrothermal system at depth. Even though saline intrusion is a severe problem in Ensenada (TDS higher than 3000), thermal springs away from the coast and coastal springs have salinities lower than sea water. According to the geoelectrical models obtained from profiles, the inferred conductive features can be related to thermal anomalies. The existence of hot springs located along a trend suggests that the dynamic of the thermal fluid is restricted by secondary faults.\n\nStatus of the California Red-legged Frog (Rana draytonii) in the State of Baja California, MÃ©xico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nPeralta-Garcia, Anny; Hellingsworth, Bradford D.; Richmond, Jonathan Q.; Valdez-Villavicencio, Jorge H.; Ruiz-Campos, Gorgonio; Fisher, Robert N.; Cruz-Hernandez, Pedro; Galina-Tessaro, Patricia\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe California Red-legged Frog (Rana draytonii) is a threatened species in the United States that has undergone population declines, especially in southern California. Due to the lack of information on the status of Mexican populations, we surveyed for the presence of R. draytonii in Baja California and assessed possible threats to population persistence. Our study area extended from the U.S.-Mexican border to the southern end of the distribution of the species in the Sierra San Pedro MÃ¡rtir. We found R. draytonii at six of 15 historical sites, none at five proxy sites (i.e., alternative sites chosen because the historical record lacked precise locality data), and four at 24 additional sites. The 10 occupied sites are within three watersheds in the Sierra San Pedro MÃ¡rtir (two sites at Arroyo San Rafael, two sites at Arroyo San Telmo, and six sites at Arroyo Santo Domingo). We did not detect R. draytonii at 60% of historical sites, including the highest elevation site at La Encantada and multiple low-elevation coastal drainages, suggesting the species has declined in Baja California. The threats we noted most frequently were presence of exotic aquatic animal species, water diversion, and cattle grazing. Management of remaining populations and local education is needed to prevent further declines.\n\nMining activities and arsenic in a Baja California Sur watershed\n\nTreesearch\n\nAlejandro Naranjo-Pulido; Alfredo Ortega-Rubio; Baudillo Acost-Vargas; Lia Rodriguez-Mendez; Marcos Acevedo-Beltran; Cerafina Arguelles-Mendez\n\n2000-01-01\n\nMining is one of the most important sources of income for the Baja California Sur state.

These dates can be assigned to the well-documented late Pleistocene oxygen-isotope stage 5e high sea stand. Differences between the eustatic and present elevations of this terrace indicate average uplift rates since terrace formation of approximately 4 to 5 cm/1000 yr, indicating a relative stability and lack of major vertical deformation since the late Pleistocene.moreÂ Â» This terrace in the Mulege area can now be correlated with other marine terraces throughout the Baja California peninsula and southern California.Â«Â less\n\nPreliminary Analysis of Remote Triggered Seismicity in Northern Baja California Generated by the 2011, Tohoku-Oki, Japan Earthquake\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWong-Ortega, V.; Castro, R. R.; Gonzalez-Huizar, H.; Velasco, A. A.\n\n2013-05-01\n\nWe analyze possible variations of seismicity in the northern Baja California due to the passage of seismic waves from the 2011, M9.0, Tohoku-Oki, Japan earthquake. The northwestern area of Baja California is characterized by a mountain range composed of crystalline rocks. These Peninsular Ranges of Baja California exhibits high microseismic activity and moderate size earthquakes. In the eastern region of Baja California shearing between the Pacific and the North American plates takes place and the Imperial and Cerro-Prieto faults generate most of the seismicity. The seismicity in these regions is monitored by the seismic network RESNOM operated by the Centro de InvestigaciÃ³n CientÃ­fica y de EducaciÃ³n Superior de Ensenada (CICESE). This network consists of 13 three-component seismic stations. We use the seismic catalog of RESNOM to search for changes in local seismic rates occurred after the passing of surface waves generated by the Tohoku-Oki, Japan earthquake. When we compare one month of seismicity before and after the M9.0 earthquake, the preliminary analysis shows absence of triggered seismicity in the northern Peninsular Ranges and an increase of seismicity south of the Mexicali valley where the Imperial fault jumps southwest and the Cerro Prieto fault continues.\n\nCoast of Isla Cerralvo, Baja, California as seen from STS-62\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1994-03-05\n\nSTS062-153-226 (4-18 March 1994) --- Though it did not reproduce well, this photo gives scientific information to aid in studying all types of earth's processes.

The Baja California and Gulf of California population\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHenny, C.J.; Anderson, D.W.\n\n1979-01-01\n\n-An estimated 810 ? 55 pairs (minimum estimate) of ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) were nesting in the study area during our survey (24 March-l April 1977). Approximately 174 pairs nested along the Pacific side of Baja California, 255 pairs along the gulf side, 187 pairs on the Midriff Islands, and 194 pairs in coastal Sonora and Sinaloa. Most nested on cliffs adjacent to the sea (59%); some nested on cactus in flat terrain (26%). Seven per cent nested on the ground, three percent nested in mangroves and other trees in the southern portion of the study area,.and four percent nested on man-made structures. The extreme northwestern Baja California population that was extirpated early in this century has not recovered. However, several populations immediately to the south along the Pacific Coast now appear stationary. Pesticide residues in osprey eggs from Mexico were among the lowest reported for the species in North America.\n\nPaleoenvironmental interpretation of section of Rosario Formation in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTellez-Duarte, M.A.; Ferman-Almada, J.L.\n\nIn contrast to previous interpretations of the Rosario Formation in other parts of Baja California, a stratigraphic section 6 km north of Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, contains evidences for deposition in shallow waters during a regressive event in a steep slope basin. Among the sedimentary evidence, the section shows a coarse, shoaling-upward sequence, with high-angle cross-stratification and planar bed lamination. Load structures with a westward orientation were found only at the base. The fossils assemblages support the same shoaling-upward interpretation as the sedimentary evidence, with ammonoids and deposit feeder trace fossils (such as Chondrites) at the bottom to mollusks andmoreÂ Â» suspension feeder trace fossils (such as Scolicia and Ophiomorpha, characteristic of shallower waters) at the top. This sedimentologic and paleontologic evidence suggests nearshore to beach coastal deposits. The contact between the section and a discontinuous thin limestone bed at the top of the section shows an unconformity. The absence of well-preserved fossils makes this limestone difficult to date, but the lithology is similar to that of Paleocene Sepultura Formation limestones.Â«Â less\n\nHistory and status of introduced mammals and impacts to breeding seabirds on the California channel and Northwestern Baja California Islands\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMcChesney, G.J.; Tershy, B.R.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe California Channel Islands, U.S.A., and Northwestern Baja California Islands, Mexico, host important breeding populations of several seabird species, including the endemic Black-vented Shearwater (Puffinus opisthomelas) and Xantus' Murrelet (Synthliboramphus hypoleucus). Mammals introduced to nearly all of the islands beginning in the late 1800s to early 1900s include: cats (Felis catus), dogs (Canis familiaris), Black Rats (Rattus rattus), rabbits and hares (Leporidae), goats (Capra hirca), sheep (Ovis ones), and other grazers. Cats, dogs and rats are seabird predators, grazers such as goats and sheep cause habitat degredation, and rabbits destroy habitat and compete with hole-nesting seabirds. Cats, which were introduced to at least 19 islands and currently occur on ten islands, have had the greatest impacts on seabirds, including the extinction of the endemic Guadalupe Storm-Petrel (Oceanodroma macrodactyla). Cats are known to have eliminated or severely reduced colonies of Black-vented Shearwaters, Cassin's Auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and Xantus' Murrelets. Black Rats have occurred on a minimum of seven islands and have reduced numbers of small, hole-nesting alcids on at least one island. At many islands, defoliation and erosion caused by rabbits and large grazing mammals has been severe. Their effects on seabirds are not well documented but potentially are serious. Impacts from introduced mammals have been most severe on islands with no native mammalian predators. On the Northwestern Baja California Islands, temporary and permanent human settlements have led to a greater diversity and source of introductions. Programs to remove introduced mammals and to reduce the possibility of future introductions are needed to restore seabird populations and to preserve the biodiversity of the region. Surveys are needed particularly on the Northwestern Baja California Islands to update the status and distribution of seabirds and to further assess impacts from\n\nVolcanic and Tectonic Evolution of The Gulf of California Near Mulege, Baja California Sur: Results From Baja Basins NSF-REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHutchinson, S. J.; Allard, J.; Acuna, N.; Graettinger, A. H.; Busby, C.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nCenozoic volcanic rocks have been studied along many parts of the Gulf of California margin of Baja California because they provide a record of its volcano-tectonic evolution, from subduction (24-12 Ma), to rifting (<12 Ma). The 2015-2016 Baja Basins REU studied volcanic rocks around the Boleo basin, and used geochemistry and 40Ar/39AR geochronology to recognize a ca. 10-14 Ma calcalkaline subduction assemblage, and a 6.1 Ma magnesian andesite assemblage inferred to be related to the Boleo stratiform Cu-Co-Zn sulfides. However, volcanic rocks in a 5,000 km2 region between Santa Rosalia and MulegÃ© remain largely undivided. The 2017 volcanology group mapped a 390 km2 area inland from MulegÃ©. Geologic results are described here, while geochemical data used to divide the volcanic rocks into suites are described in an accompanying abstract1. We infer the following sequence of events: (1) A half graben filled with a >820 m thick red bed sequence, sourced to the east by andesitic volcanic rocks eroded from the footwall of a west-dipping normal fault. Proximal alluvial fan bajada deposits are debris-flow dominated, with angular clasts up to 1.3 m in size. Distal braided stream deposits have sandstones and cobble conglomerates, with abundant cut and fill structures and rounded clasts. Adakite trachyandesite block-and-ash-flow tuffs are interstratified with the proximal deposits, representing pyroclastic flows generated by collapse of lava domes plumbed up the basin-bounding fault to the east. (2) The redbeds were cut by a dike swarm that fed a field of lava shield volcanoes. The dikes and lava shields include calcalkaline basaltic andesite, andesite and dacite, as well as magnesian trachyandesite and basaltic andesite. (3) A N-S, subvertical fault stepped into the basin and dropped the lava shields down to the east, while they were eroded off the uplifted footwall to the west. (4) The footwall block was beveled and overlain by plateau-forming magnesian basaltic\n\nReview of Neopalpa PovolnÃ½, 1998 with description of a new species from California and Baja California, Mexico (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae).\n\nPubMed\n\nNazari, Vazrick\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe monotypic genus Neopalpa was described in 1998 by Czech entomologist Dalibor PovolnÃ½ based on two male specimens from Santa Catalina Island, California, which he named Neopalpa neonata .

M.; GÃ³mez-TreviÃ±o, E.; Flores-Luna, C.; GarcÃ­a-Abdeslem, J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nCrustal and sub-crustal structure of northwestern Mexico (peninsular California) resulted from major accretion episodes occurred during the long-lived subduction of the Farallon plate beneath the North American plate, since late Jurassic time. A magnetotelluric profile across central Baja California reveals several electrical conductivity anomalies probably associated to the crustal boundaries of distinct Mezosoic terranes juxtaposed in the current peninsular crust. It is known that electrical conductivity is significantly increased by the pervasive presence of conductive minerals generated during metamorphic processes in highly sheared zones. We interpret a striking sub-horizontal conductivity anomaly reveled in the model as explained by the presence of high-salinity fluids released after dehydration of the subducted Magdalena microplate (Farallon plate?). The presence of fluids at the base of the peninsular crust may produce a zone of weakness, which supports the idea that Baja California lithosphere has not been entirely coupled to the Pacific plate. In addition, crustal thickness is estimated in our model in about 35 km beneath the western Peninsular Ranges batholith (PRB) and 20 km beneath the eastern PRB. This crustal thickness is in good agreement with independent estimations of a thinner crust in the Gulf of California margin and a thicker crust along the axial PRB.\n\nPhylogeography and Ecological Niche Modeling of the Desert Iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis, Baird & Girard 1852) in the Baja California Peninsula.\n\nPubMed\n\nValdivia-Carrillo, Tania; GarcÃ­a-De LeÃ³n, Francisco J; BlÃ¡zquez, Ma Carmen; GutiÃ©rrez-Flores, Carina; GonzÃ¡lez Zamorano, Patricia\n\n2017-09-01\n\nUnderstanding the factors that explain the patterns of genetic structure or phylogeographic breaks at an intraspecific level is key to inferring the mechanisms of population differentiation in its early stages. These topics have been well studied in the Baja California region, with vicariance and the dispersal ability of individuals being the prevailing hypothesis for phylogeographic breaks. In this study, we evaluated the phylogeographic patterns in the desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis), a species with a recent history in the region and spatial variation in life history traits. We analyzed a total of 307 individuals collected throughout 19 localities across the Baja California Peninsula with 15 microsatellite DNA markers. Our data reveal the existence of 3 geographically discrete genetic populations with moderate gene flow and an isolation-by-distance pattern presumably produced by the occurrence of a refugium in the Cape region during the Pleistocene Last Glacial Maximum. Bayesian methods and ecological niche modeling were used to assess the relationship between population genetic structure and present and past climatic preferences of the desert iguana. We found that the present climatic heterogeneity of the Baja California Peninsula has a marked influence on the population genetic structure of the species, suggesting that there are alternative explanations besides vicariance. The information obtained in this study provides data allowing a better understanding of how historical population processes in the Baja California Peninsula can be understood from an ecological perspective.

Wild populations of blue (Haliotis fulgens) and yellow (H. corrugata) abalone have experienced unusual mortality rates since 2009 off the peninsula of Baja California and WS has been hypothesized as a possible cause. Currently, little information is available about the genetic diversity of CXc and particularly the possible existence of strains differing in pathogenicity. In a recent phylogenetic analysis, we characterized five coding genes from this rickettsial pathogen. Here, we analyze those genes and two additional intergenic non-coding regions following multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and multi-spacer typing (MST) approaches to assess the genetic variability of CXc and its relationship with blue, yellow and red (H. rufescens) abalone. Moreover, we used 16S rRNA pyrosequencing reads from gut microbiomes of blue and yellow abalone to complete the genetic characterization of this prokaryote. The presence of CXc was investigated in more than 150 abalone of the three species; furthermore, a total of 385 DNA sequences and 7117 16S rRNA reads from Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis were used to evaluate its population genetic structure. Our findings suggest the absence of polymorphism in the DNA sequences of analyzed loci and the presence of a single lineage of CXc infecting abalone from California (USA) and Baja California (Mexico). We posit that the absence of genetic variably in this marine rickettsia may be the result of evolutionary and ecological processes. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

M.\n\n2006-05-01\n\nThe weather of the Baja California Peninsula, part of northwestern Mexico, is mild and dry most of the year. However, during the summer, humid air masses associated with tropical cyclones move northward in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Added features that create a unique meteorological situation include mountain ranges along the spine of the peninsula, warm water in the Gulf of California, and the cold California Current in the Pacific. These features interact with the environmental flow to induce conditions that play a role in the occurrence of localized, convective systems during the approach of tropical cyclones. Most of these events occur late in the summer, generating heavy precipitation, strong winds, lightning, and are associated with significant property damage to the local populations. Our goal is to provide information on the characteristics of these weather systems by performing an analysis of observations derived from a regional network. This includes imagery from radar and geostationary satellite, and data from surface stations. A set of real-time products are generated in our research center and are made available to a broad audience (researchers, students, and business employees) by using an internet site. Graphical products are updated anywhere from one to 24 hours and includes predictions from numerical models. Forecasts are derived from an operational model (GFS) and locally generated simulations based on a mesoscale model (MM5). Our analysis and forecasting system has been in operation since the summer of 2005 and was used as a reference for a set of discussions during the development of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones. This basin had 15 named storms and none of them made landfall on the west coast of Mexico; however, four systems were within 800 km from the area of interest, resulting in some convective activity. During the whole season, a group of 30 users from our institution, government offices, and local businesses received daily information\n\nOccurrence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in anurans of the Mediterranean region of Baja California, MÃ©xico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nPeralta-Garcia, Anny; Adams, Andrea J.; Briggs, Cheryl J.; Galina-Tessaro, Patricia; Valdez-Villavicencio, Jorge H.; Hollingsworth, Bradford; Shaffer, H.

In MÃ©xico, Bd was first reported in 2003 and has now been documented in 13 states. We visited 33 localities and swabbed 199 wild-caught anurans from 7 species (5 native, 2 exotic) across the Mediterranean region of the state of Baja California. Using quantitative PCR, Bd was detected in 94 individuals (47.2% of samples) at 25 of the 33 survey localities for 5 native and 1 exotic frog species. The exotic Xenopus laevis was the only species that tested completely negative for Bd. We found that remoteness, distance to agricultural land, and elevation were the best predictors of Bd presence. These are the first Bd-positive results for the state of Baja California and its presence should be regarded as an additional conservation threat to the regionâs native frog species.Â\n\nAgave turneri (Agavaceae), a new species from northeastern Baja California, Mexico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nWebb, Robert H.; Salazar-CeseÃ±a, J.

The first eruptive stage, during the Pliocene, was manifested by ash and pumice falls and by subaqueous pumitic flows. In a second stage basic flows were deposited in a near-shore environment (subaerial and pillow lavas). During the early Pleistocene a large ignimbritic eruption, producing mainly pantelleritic tuffs, immediately predated the formation of the caldera itself. Afterwards, along marginal fractures of the caldera, some rhyolitic domes and flows partially covered the thick ignimbritic sheet. A block of Miocene substratum, in the center of the caldera, has been uplifted, nearly 1 km, by \"resurgent doming\". Small outcrops of diorite might constitute the top of coarse-grained crystallized magmatic bodies, and thus support the \"resurgent doming\" interpretation. A few basaltic cones were finally built on the flanks of the caldera complex; the latter are not related to the caldera history but to the extension tectonics of the Gulf of California which are also responsible for the Tortuga Island and the Holocene Tres Virgenes tholeiitic cones. South of la Reforma are found the highest (+300 m) Pleistocene marine deposits of the Gulf coast of Baja California. The uplift of this area is due in part to the positive epeirogenic movements of the whole peninsular crustal block, and also to the late doming of the caldera. On the coastal (eastern) flank of La Reforma complex up to seven stepped wave-cut terraces have been preserved, the highest reaching more than +150 m and the lowest ones +25 m. Lateral correlations of the marine terraces along the whole Gulf of California suggest that this volcano-tectonic uplift, that is still active, is of the order of 240 mm/10 3 y. The set of terraces is interpreted to be Middle (700-125 Ã 10 3y) to Upper (125-80 Ã 10 3y) Pleistocene, and is tentatively correlated with the paleoclimatic chronology of deep\n\nVicariance and dispersal across Baja California in disjunct marine fish populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nBernardi, Giacomo; Findley, Lloyd; Rocha-Olivares, Axayacatl\n\n2003-07-01\n\nPopulation disjunctions, as a first step toward complete allopatry, present an interesting situation to study incipient speciation. The geological formation of the Baja California Peninsula currently divides 19 species of fish into disjunct populations that are found on its Pacific Coast and in the northern part of the Gulf of California (also called the Sea of Cortez), but are absent from the Cape (Cabo San Lucas) region. We studied the genetic makeup of disjunct populations for 12 of these 19 fish species. Phylogeographic patterns for the 12 species can be separated into two major classes: a first group (eight species) showed reciprocal monophyly and high genetic divergence between disjunct populations. A second group (four species) displayed what appeared to be panmictic populations. Population structure between Pacific Coast populations, across the Punta Eugenia biogeographic boundary, was also evaluated. While dispersal potential (inferred by pelagic larval duration) was a poor predictor of population structure between Gulf of California and Pacific populations, we found that population genetic subdivision along the Pacific Coast at Punta Eugenia was always positively correlated with differentiation between Pacific and Gulf of California populations. Vicariant events, ongoing gene flow, and ecological characteristics played essential roles in shaping the population structures observed in this study.\n\nA Crustal Velocity Model for South Mexicali Valley, Baja California, MÃ©xico.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRamirez, E.; Vidal-Villegas, A.; Stock, J. M.; Gonzalez-Fernandez, A.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe northern Baja California region consists of two subregions of different geological features: the Peninsular Ranges of Baja California, of granitic composition, and the Mexicali Valley region, characterized by a series of sedimentary basins: the Laguna Salada and the Mexicali Valley. Due to the lack of an appropriate crust model for South Mexicali Valley, a refraction study was conducted. We installed 16 three-component short period stations (2 Hz) and one broadband station (100 s - 50 Hz). The stations, spaced 6 km along a refraction profile, recorded a blast performed in the southwest Arizona near the border with Sonora, Mexico. Records gathered were used to estimate a crust velocity structure model for South Mexicali Valley. The beginning of the profile is at San Luis Rio Colorado (SLRC), Sonora and its ending is at the middle of Sierra Juarez, Baja California. As a \"reverse shot\", for a 47 km section between SLRC and El Mayor Mountain, we used an aftershock M 3.4 of the 2010 M 7.2 El Mayor - Cucapah earthquake. Record sections show seismograms with impulsive P arrivals for nearby stations. The arrival Pn wave is observed at three stations located in Laguna Salada and Sierra Juarez. From the first arrivals of refractions and reflections of the P wave we performed direct modeling of travel times and relative amplitudes (normalized synthetic seismograms). Method based on asymptotic ray theory programed in the RAYINVR software (Zelt and Smith, 1992). We propose an average-three-layer velocity structure model: 2.9, 5.6 and 6.9 km/s, with thicknesses of 1.2, 4.4 and 9.6 km, respectively. Velocities of our model for the region under study are about 1 km/s higher than the model proposed by McMechan and Mooney (1984) for the Imperial Valley. The preliminary interpretation using the \"reverse shot\" indicates a crust of 15 km depth beneath the Mexicali Valley and 19 km under the El Mayor Mountain and Laguna Salada basin. On the eastern side of the El Mayor Mountain we\n\nCharacterization of a Polymicrobial Dermal Infection in a Peninsular Pronghorn ( Antilocapra americana peninsularis) in Baja California, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nVelez, Patricia; Romero, LucÃ­a; Lopez-Tello, Jamvier; Callejas-Negrete, Olga A; Riquelme, Meritxell\n\n2018-04-01\n\nâ In situ conservation efforts are assisting the recovery of free-ranging populations of the endangered peninsular pronghorns ( Antilocapra americana peninsularis) at the Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, Baja California Sur, Mexico.

Regional mapping and compilation of stratigraphic data reveal a sequence of three regionally traceable stratigraphic units. (1) Oligocene (?) to lower Miocene Mesa Formation: basal quartz-rich fluvial sandstone, grus, conglomerate, and accessory facies, whose detrital compositions reflect the composition of local pre-Tertiary basement rock. (2) Lower to middle Miocene ComondÃº Formation: laterally variable sequence of volcaniclastic conglomerate, breccia, sandstone, tuff and minor volcanic flow units. (3) Widespread mesa-capping rhyolite tuff, typically welded and crystal-rich, probably upper Miocene in age. The Mesa Formation overlies a highly irregular and deeply dissected erosional surface developed on pre-Tertiary basement rock. The shift from pre-Mesa erosion to widespread (though localized) deposition and valley-filling records the final phase of late Cretaceous to middle Tertiary regional subsidence and eastward transgression that resulted from slow cooling and thermal contraction of Cretaceous arc crust during a temporal gap in magmatic activity along the western Cordilleran margin. Nonmarine sediments of the Mesa Formation were deposited in small, steep-walled paleovalleys and basins that gradually filled and evolved to form through-going, low-energy ephemeral stream systems. The gradational upward transition from the Mesa to ComondÃº Formation records the early to middle Miocene onset of subduction-related arc magmatism in eastern Baja California and related westward progradation of alluvial volcaniclastic aprons shed from high-standing eruptive volcanic centers. Pre-existing streams were choked with the new influx of volcanic detritus, causing the onset of rapid sediment deposition by stream flows and dilute\n\nEarly Miocene shortening in the lower ComondÃº Group in Baja California Sur (MÃ©xico)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBonini, Marco; Cerca, Mariano; Moratti, Giovanna; LÃ³pez-MartÃ­nez, Margarita; Corti, Giacomo; Gracia-MarroquÃ­n, Diego\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe Late Oligocene-Early Miocene volcaniclastic deposits of Baja California Sur form most of the exposed western margin of the Gulf of California rift. In some places these deposits, collectively referred to as ComondÃº Group, show complex deformation patterns given by the coexistence of tectonic and gravitational features. The area north of La Paz is characterized by the occurrence of several slump bodies, which are displaced by normal faults connected with the rift opening. In some places we have identified 100's m scale thrust-related folds and reverse faults that we have interpreted as shortening features. The latter displace the slump layers and are offset by the normal faults. If confirmed, this would represent the first report of a shortening event in the Early Miocene volcaniclastic deposits of Baja California Sur. The observed shortening has modest magnitude (ca 3-5% bulk shortening), and has been detected in a sector extending over 100 km north from La Paz. New 40Ar-39*Ar ages, integrated with existing radiometric age datasets, constrain the timing of this shortening episode. The rocks affected by shortening have ages between 24 and 21 Ma, and are capped by undeformed volcanic rocks with ages spanning between 19.4 and 17.2 Ma. These relationships define an intra-Early Miocene unconformity, which we interpret to be related to the shortening deformation. The available timing constraints allow us to infer that a main ENE-to-ESE-trending shortening was short-lived, possibly ca. 19.4-21 Ma. The account of this shortening event may shed some light on the complex subduction and microplate processes that preceded the continental rifting of the Gulf of California.\n\nModern carbonate sediments and environments of the LaPaz region, Baja California Sur, Mexico\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHalfar, J.; Ingle, J.C.

The webs have four noteworthy attributes: (1) parasites (infectious agents), (2) body-size information, (3) biomass information, and (4) ontogenetic stages of many animals with complex life cycles. The estuaries are Carpinteria Salt Marsh, California (CSM); Estero de Punta Banda, Baja California (EPB); and BahÃ­a Falsa in BahÃ­a San QuintÃ­n, Baja California (BSQ). Most data on species assemblages and parasitism were gathered via consistent sampling that acquired body size and biomass information for plants and animals larger than â¼1 mm, and for many infectious agents (mostly metazoan parasites, but also some microbes). We augmented this with information from additional published sources and by sampling unrepresented groups (e.g., plankton). We estimated free-living consumerâresource links primarily by extending a previously published version of the CSM web (which the current CSM web supplants) and determined most parasite consumerâresource links from direct observation. We recognize 21 possible link types including four general interactions: predators consuming prey, parasites consuming hosts, predators consuming parasites, and parasites consuming parasites. While generally resolved to the species level, we report stage-specific nodes for many animals with complex life cycles. We include additional biological information for each node, such as taxonomy, lifestyle (free-living, infectious, commensal, mutualist), mobility, and residency. The Metaweb includes 500 nodes, 314 species, and 11â270 links projected to be present given appropriate species' co-occurrences. Of these, 9247 links were present in one or more of the estuarine webs. The remaining 2023 links were not present in the estuaries but are included here because they may occur in other places or times.

This \"marine heatwave\" marked a shift of Pacific decadal variability to its warm phase and was linked to significant impacts on marine species as well as exceptionally arid conditions in western North America. Here we show that the subtropical signature of this warming, off Baja California, was associated with a record deficit in the spatial coverage of co-located marine boundary layer clouds. This deficit coincided with a large increase in downwelling solar radiation that dominated the anomalous energy budget of the upper ocean, resulting in record-breaking warm sea surface temperature anomalies. Our observation-based analysis suggests that a positive cloud-surface temperature feedback was key to the extreme intensity of the heatwave. The results demonstrate the extent to which boundary layer clouds can contribute to regional variations in climate.\n\nThe Palaeodiet of the Pericue Indians of the Cape Region of Baja California Sur, Mexico.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBeer, N.; Gonzalez, S.; Huddart, D.; Rosales-Lopez, A.; Lamb, A.\n\n2008-05-01\n\nThe archaeology of the Pericue Indians inhabiting the Cape region of Baja California has long been an area of interest. The dolichocranic traits exhibited by this population have lead to suggestions that these people were a relic population of an early coastal migration into North America. The antiquity of directly dated Pericue human remains only reaches 3,000 B.P. with occupation sites dating back to 9,000 B.P. The site of Babisuri cave in Isla Espiritu Santo may demonstrate a very early human presence in Baja California Sur between 36,000 to 45,000 B.P. although the exact nature of this evidence is unclear. Increasing tourist development within this region threatens many archaeological sites particularly coastal shell middens and rock shelters. Current rescue excavations are yielding important information regarding many aspects of the culture of the Pericue Indians. Geochemical evidence of diet {d13C and d15N} taken from Pericue bone samples, modern and archaeological animals and modern plants is helping us to understand the complicated subsistence strategies of this group. Initial results highlight a complicated and diverse diet including marine and terrestrial resources, most likely exploited seasonally. Similarities between the diet of the Pericue and other nearby coastal Indian groups are clear and will be discussed. Pericue Indian material culture, combined with the exploitation of marine mammals and the construction of enormous shell mounds display parallels with other central and North American groups. The exploitation of marine mammals and the associated stone tools display striking similarities to the Chumash people of the Channel Islands of Coastal Southern California. Some of these cultural similarities will be highlighted in this presentation. Current genetic work is attempting to discover the nature of the similarities between the Chumash and Pericue groups as some cultural elements of each group have parallels with the other.

Twenty-one sandy beach sites were sampled to investigate the occurrence and distribution of microplastics on the sandy beaches of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, as well as their spectroscopic characterization and morphology. Microplastics were separated using the density method and identified using Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The mean abundance of microplastics in the samples was 135â¯Â±â¯92 particles kgâ1, and fiber was the most abundant microplastic found in the samples, comprising 91% of the total microplastics identified. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis of the microplastics showed that the main polymers found in microplastics were polyacrylic, polyacrylamide, polyethylene terephthalate, polyesters, and nylon.\n\nTectonic analysis of Baja California and Parras shear belt in Mexico\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAbdel-Gawad, M. (Principal Investigator); Tubbesing, L.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nThe author has identified the following significant results. Geological correlation of terrain across the Gulf of California using ERTS-1 imagery revealed significant similarities between Isla Tiburon, Isla Angel de la Guarda, and the San Carlos Range in mainland Mexico. ERTS-1 imagery was used to check the validity of the existence of major trans-Baja fault zones. ERTS-1 imagery also shows that high albedo sediments similar to known late Tertiary marine sediments are widespread in southern and middle Baja and extend in places to the eastern side of the Peninsula. Major faults in northern Mexico and across the border in the United States were mapped, and ample evidence was found that the Parras and parts of the Texas lineament are belts of major transverse shear faults in areas outside the supposed limit of the Texas and Parras lineaments. A fundamental concept which may help explain many complexities in the tectonic development is beginning to emerge: The southwestern part of North America was torn by massive left-lateral shear of transverse trend (east-west) during the compressive stage of the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic. This tectonic style has changed into tensional rifting (Basin and Range) and right-lateral shear later in the Cenozoic and Quaternary.\n\nEpidemics which never came: yellow fever (1883) and bubonic plague (1902-1903) in Baja California\n\nPubMed\n\nFierros-HernÃ¡ndez, Arturo; Ayala-ZÃºÃ±iga, Alejandro\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis paper seeks to clarify the epidemic panorama that was generated in Baja California in the late nineteenth and early twentieth 20 th centuryâs, specifically that occurred in 1883 and 1902, years in which it is claimed occurred epidemics of yellow fever and bubonic plague respectively.

These patterns were evaluated as they relate to previously hypothesized vicariant events and new insights are provided into the biogeographic and evolutionary processes important in Baja California and surrounding North American deserts. Three major lineages (Lineages A, B, and C) are revealed with very little overlap. Lineage A and B are predominately separated along the Colorado River and are found primarily within California and Arizona (respectively), while Lineage C consists of disjunct groups distributed along the Baja California peninsula as well as south-central Arizona, southward along the coastal regions of Sonora, Mexico. Estimated divergence time points (using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock) and geographic congruence with postulated vicariant events suggest early extensions of the Gulf of California and subsequent development of the Colorado River during the Late Miocene-Pliocene led to the formation of these mtDNA lineages. Our results also suggest that vicariance hypotheses alone do not fully explain patterns of genetic variation. Therefore, we highlight the importance of dispersal to explain these patterns and current distribution of populations.

The results suggest that large earthquakes along the relatively young San Miguel and Tres Hermanas fault zones have complex rupture histories, small source dimensions (< 25 km), high stress drops (60 bar average), and a high incidence of foreshock activity.moreÂ Â» This may be a reflection of the rough, highly segmented nature of the young faults. In contrast, Imperial-Cerro Prieto events of similar magnitude have low stress drops (16 bar average) and longer rupture lengths (42 km average), reflecting rupture along older, smoother fault planes. Events along the San Jacinto fault zone appear to lie in between these two groups. These results suggest a relationship between the structural and seismological properties of strike-slip faults that should be considered during seismic risk studies.Â«Â less\n\nDynamics of a parasite assemblage of the Vermilion Rockfish Sebastes miniatus from northwestern Baja California, MÃ©xico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRodrÃ­guez-Santiago, M.
