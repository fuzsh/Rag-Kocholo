Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 429–446, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-429-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-429-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe megadrought experienced in Chile (2010–2020) has led to larger than expected water deficits. By analysing 106 basins with snow-/rainfall regimes, we relate such intensification with the hydrological memory of the basins, explained by snow and groundwater. Snow-dominated basins have larger memory and thus accumulate the effect of persistent precipitation deficits more strongly than pluvial basins. This notably affects central Chile, a water-limited region where most of the population lives.\n\nWintertime aerosol measurements during the Chilean Coastal Orographic Precipitation Experiment\n\nSara Lynn Fults, Adam K. Massmann, Aldo Montecinos, Elisabeth Andrews, David E. Kingsmill, Justin R. Minder, RenÃ© D. Garreaud, and Jefferson R. Snider\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The averaged aerosol particle concentration at our site (D > 0.01 μm) is larger than at a site on the Californian Pacific coast. Additionally, size distributions sampled during intervals of onshore flow are used to parameterize aerosol properties relevant to cloud and precipitation processes. We anticipate that modeling of wintertime Chilean coastal rain events will benefit from the parameterizations we present.\n\nThe CAMELS-CL dataset: catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies â Chile dataset\n\nCamila Alvarez-Garreton, Pablo A.

The study, highlights the greatest variability of the diurnal currents which are highly influenced by the diurnal wind forcing, also modulated by a synoptic-scale circulation pattern. Our results show that the highest diurnal current variability suggesting a strong coupling between diurnal wind forcing and inertial oscillations.\n\nMeteorological observations on the northern Chilean coast during VOCALS-REx\n\nJ.

Mohr, Mauricio Zambrano-Bigiarini, BenjamÃ­n Sotomayor, Dagoberto Poblete-Caballero, Sebastien Carretier, Mauricio Galleguillos, and Oscar Seguel\n\nEarth Surf. Dynam., 12, 841–861, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-12-841-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-12-841-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe calculated disturbances and landscape-lowering rates across various timescales in a ~ 406 km2 catchment in the Chilean Coastal Range. Intensive management of exotic tree plantations involves short rotational cycles (planting and harvesting by replanting clear-cuts) lasting 9–25 years, dense forestry road networks (increasing connectivity), and a recent increase in wildfires. Concurrently, persistent drought conditions and the high water demand of fast-growing trees reduce water availability.\n\nThe influence of human activities on streamflow reductions during the megadrought in central Chile\n\nNicolÃ¡s Ãlamos, Camila Alvarez-Garreton, Ariel MuÃ±oz, and Ãlvaro GonzÃ¡lez-Reyes\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2483–2503, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2483-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2483-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we assess the effects of climate and water use on streamflow reductions and drought intensification during the last 3 decades in central Chile. We address this by contrasting streamflow observations with near-natural streamflow simulations. We conclude that while the lack of precipitation dominates streamflow reductions in the megadrought, water uses have not diminished during this time, causing a worsening of the hydrological drought conditions and maladaptation conditions.\n\nHESS Opinions: The unsustainable use of groundwater conceals a âDay Zeroâ\n\nCamila Alvarez-Garreton, Juan Pablo Boisier, RenÃ© Garreaud, Javier GonzÃ¡lez, Roberto Rondanelli, Eugenia GayÃ³, and Mauricio Zambrano-Bigiarini\n\nHydrol.

Using novel data recently developed for Chile, we reveal how groundwater is being overused, causing ecological and socioeconomic impacts and concealing a Day Zero scenario. Our argument underscores the need for reformed water allocation rules and sustainable management, shifting from a perception of groundwater as an unlimited source to a finite and vital one.\n\nOn the timescale of drought indices for monitoring streamflow drought considering catchment hydrological regimes\n\nOscar M. Baez-Villanueva, Mauricio Zambrano-Bigiarini, Diego G. Miralles, Hylke E. Beck, Jonatan F. Siegmund, Camila Alvarez-Garreton, Koen Verbist, RenÃ© Garreaud, Juan Pablo Boisier, and Mauricio Galleguillos\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

This study addresses meteorological, soil moisture, and snow indices along with their temporal scales to assess streamflow drought across hydrologically diverse catchments. Using data from 100 Chilean catchments, findings suggest that there is not a single drought index that can be used for all catchments and that snow-influenced areas require drought indices with larger temporal scales.\n\nComparison of carbon and water fluxes and the drivers of ecosystem water use efficiency in a temperate rainforest and a peatland in southern South America\n\nJorge F. Perez-Quezada, David Trejo, Javier Lopatin, David Aguilera, Bruce Osborne, Mauricio Galleguillos, Luca Zattera, Juan L. Celis-Diez, and Juan J. Armesto\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1371–1389, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1371-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1371-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor 8 years we sampled a temperate rainforest and a peatland in Chile to estimate their efficiency to capture carbon per unit of water lost. The efficiency is more related to the water lost than to the carbon captured and is mainly driven by evaporation instead of transpiration. This is the first report from southern South America and highlights that ecosystems might behave differently in this area, likely explained by the high annual precipitation (~ 2100 mm) and light-limited conditions.\n\nReview article: Drought as a continuum: memory effects in interlinked hydrological, ecological, and social systems\n\nAnne F.

In this paper we review the literature and discuss five cases, where drought, its impacts and responses develop differently over time. We look at the hydrological, ecological and social system and their connections. And we provide suggestions for further research and for monitoring, modelling and management.\n\nClimate tipping point interactions and cascades: a review\n\nNico Wunderling, Anna S. von der Heydt, Yevgeny Aksenov, Stephen Barker, Robbin Bastiaansen, Victor Brovkin, Maura Brunetti, Victor Couplet, Thomas Kleinen, Caroline H.

We find indications that many of the interactions between tipping elements are destabilizing. This means that tipping cascades cannot be ruled out on centennial to millennial timescales at global warming levels between 1.5 and 2.0 °C or on shorter timescales if global warming surpasses 2.0 °C.\n\nPanta Rhei benchmark dataset: socio-hydrological data of paired events of floods and droughts\n\nHeidi Kreibich, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, Giuliano Di Baldassarre, Anne F.

We present a dataset containing data of paired events, i.e. two floods or two droughts that occurred in the same area. The dataset enables comparative analyses and allows detailed context-specific assessments. Additionally, it supports the testing of socio-hydrological models.\n\nDrought increase since the mid-20th century in the northern South American Altiplano revealed by a 389-year precipitation record\n\nMariano S.

We established that the occurrence rate of extreme dry events together with a shift in mean dry conditions for the late 20th–beginning of the 21st century is unprecedented in the past 389 years, consistent with other paleoclimatic records. Our reconstruction provides valuable information about El NiÃ±o–Southern Oscillation influences on local precipitation.\n\nThe Landscape Fire Scars Database: mapping historical burned area and fire severity in Chile\n\nAlejandro Miranda, RayÃ©n Mentler, Ãtalo Moletto-Lobos, Gabriela Alfaro, Leonardo Aliaga, Dana BalbontÃ­n, Maximiliano Barraza, Susanne Baumbach, Patricio CalderÃ³n, Fernando CÃ¡rdenas, IvÃ¡n Castillo, Gonzalo Contreras, Felipe de la Barra, Mauricio Galleguillos, Mauro E.

High-quality information can help to transform evidence into decision-making. Taking advantage of big-data and remote sensing technics we developed a flexible workflow to reconstruct burned area and fire severity data for more than 8000 individual fires in Chile. The framework developed for the database can be applied anywhere in the world with minimal adaptation.\n\nOn the selection of precipitation products for the regionalisation of hydrological model parameters\n\nOscar M. Baez-Villanueva, Mauricio Zambrano-Bigiarini, Pablo A. Mendoza, Ian McNamara, Hylke E. Beck, Joschka Thurner, Alexandra Nauditt, Lars Ribbe, and Nguyen Xuan Thinh\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Regionalisation methods use information from gauged rivers to estimate streamflow over ungauged ones. Through hydrological modelling, we assessed how the selection of precipitation products affects the performance of three regionalisation methods. We found that a precipitation product that provides the best results in hydrological modelling does not necessarily perform the best for regionalisation.\n\nUsing the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) records as century-long benchmarks for global land-surface models\n\nJina Jeong, Jonathan Barichivich, Philippe Peylin, Vanessa Haverd, Matthew Joseph McGrath, Nicolas Vuichard, Michael Neil Evans, Flurin Babst, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nGeosci.

Using relatively unbiased European biomass network datasets, we identify the extent to which presumed biases in the much larger International Tree-Ring Data Bank might degrade the validation of LSMs.\n\nProgressive water deficits during multiyear droughts in basins with long hydrological memory in Chile\n\nCamila Alvarez-Garreton, Juan Pablo Boisier, RenÃ© Garreaud, Jan Seibert, and Marc Vis\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 429–446, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-429-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-429-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe megadrought experienced in Chile (2010–2020) has led to larger than expected water deficits. By analysing 106 basins with snow-/rainfall regimes, we relate such intensification with the hydrological memory of the basins, explained by snow and groundwater. Snow-dominated basins have larger memory and thus accumulate the effect of persistent precipitation deficits more strongly than pluvial basins. This notably affects central Chile, a water-limited region where most of the population lives.\n\nUnderstanding the uncertainty in global forest carbon turnover\n\nThomas A. M.

Estimates from six contemporary models found this time to range from 12.2 to 23.5 years for the global mean for 1985–2014. Future projections do not give consistent results, but 13 model-based hypotheses are identified, along with recommendations for pragmatic steps to test them using existing and novel observations, which would help to reduce large current uncertainty.\n\nCHLSOC: the Chilean Soil Organic Carbon database, a multi-institutional collaborative effort\n\nMarco Pfeiffer, JosÃ© Padarian, Rodrigo Osorio, Nelson Bustamante, Guillermo Federico Olmedo, Mario Guevara, Felipe Aburto, Francisco Albornoz, Monica AntilÃ©n, ElÃ­as Araya, Eduardo Arellano, Maialen Barret, Juan Barrera, Pascal Boeckx, Margarita BriceÃ±o, Sally Bunning, Lea Cabrol, Manuel Casanova, Pablo Cornejo, Fabio Corradini, Gustavo Curaqueo, Sebastian Doetterl, Paola Duran, Mauricio Escudey, Angelina Espinoza, Samuel Francke, Juan Pablo Fuentes, Marcel Fuentes, Gonzalo Gajardo, Rafael GarcÃ­a, Audrey Gallaud, Mauricio Galleguillos, AndrÃ©s Gomez, Marcela Hidalgo, Jorge Ivelic-SÃ¡ez, Lwando Mashalaba, Francisco Matus, Francisco Meza, Maria de la Luz Mora, Jorge Mora, Cristina MuÃ±oz, Pablo Norambuena, Carolina Olivera, Carlos Ovalle, Marcelo Panichini, AnÃ­bal Pauchard, Jorge F.

The averaged aerosol particle concentration at our site (D > 0.01 μm) is larger than at a site on the Californian Pacific coast. Additionally, size distributions sampled during intervals of onshore flow are used to parameterize aerosol properties relevant to cloud and precipitation processes. We anticipate that modeling of wintertime Chilean coastal rain events will benefit from the parameterizations we present.\n\nGlacier equilibrium line altitude variations during the âLittle Ice Ageâ in the Mediterranean Andes (30â¦–37â¦ S)\n\nÃlvaro GonzÃ¡lez-Reyes, Claudio Bravo, Mathias Vuille, Martin Jacques-Coper, Maisa Rojas, Esteban Sagredo, and James McPhee\n\nClim. Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2019-37,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2019-37, 2019\n\nPublication in CP not foreseen\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe \"Little Ice Age\" (LIA), has long been recognized as the last period when mountain glaciers recorded extensive growth intervals. In the Mediterranean Andes (MA; 30Âº–37Âº S), the LIA has been poorly documented. Here, we performed an experiment using three GCMs to force a novel glaciological model. We simulated temporal variations of the ELA to evaluate the glacier response. We propose that Pacific SST variability was the main modulator of temporal changes of the ELA in the MA region during LIA.\n\nParticle swarm optimization for the estimation of surface complexation constants with the geochemical model PHREEQC-3.1.2\n\nRamadan Abdelaziz, Broder J.

Our results imply that explicit coupling of the water and carbon cycles improves the representation of biogeochemical cycles and their spatial variability. Representing the variation in the ecological functioning of Amazonia should be the next step to improve the performance and predictive ability of models.\n\nSeasonal and synoptic variability of diurnal currents in an upwelling system off northern Chile near 30° S\n\nMÃ³nica Bello, Marcel Ramos, RenÃ© Garreaud, Luis Bravo, and Martin Thiel\n\nOcean Sci.

Several indices of performance are used for different timescales and elevation zones. Our analysis reveals what SREs are in closer agreement to ground-based observations and what indices allow for understanding mismatches in shape, magnitude, variability and intensity of precipitation.\n\nClimate change impacts on hydroclimatic regimes and extremes over Andean basins in central Chile\n\nDeniz Bozkurt, Maisa Rojas, Juan Pablo Boisier, and JonaÌs Valdivieso\n\nHydrol.

Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2016-690,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2016-690, 2017\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, historical (1960–2005) and projected, following the RCP8.5 scenario (2006–2099), daily precipitation and temperatures from 26 CMIP5 climate models are bias corrected and used to drive the VIC model in order to obtain regional hydroclimate projections. Our study highlights that the robust drying and warming conditions are expected to increase the severity and frequency of extreme events such as recently experienced mega-drought (2010–2015) in this densely populated region in Chile.\n\nHow many measurements are needed to estimate accurate daily and annual soil respiration fluxes? Analysis using data from a temperate rainforest\n\nJorge F. Perez-Quezada, Carla E. Brito, JuliÃ¡n Cabezas, Mauricio Galleguillos, Juan P. Fuentes, Horacio E. Bown, and NicolÃ¡s Franck\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 6599–6609, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-6599-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-6599-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied how many measurements are needed to correctly represent the soil respiration flux, mostly to help researchers who do not have automatic chambers to perform these measurements, so they can sample as seldom as possible. Our results show that for our site conditions, at least two measurements should be made in one day, one of which should be made at night-time. We also found that it is more important to make more field campaigns than measuring more times in one day.\n\nRe-evaluating the 1940s CO2 plateau\n\nAna Bastos, Philippe Ciais, Jonathan Barichivich, Laurent Bopp, Victor Brovkin, Thomas Gasser, Shushi Peng, Julia Pongratz, Nicolas Viovy, and Cathy M. Trudinger\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 4877–4897, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-4877-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-4877-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ice-core record shows a stabilisation of atmospheric CO2 in the 1940s, despite continued emissions from fossil fuel burning and land-use change (LUC). We use up-to-date reconstructions of the CO2 sources and sinks over the 20th century to evaluate whether these capture the CO2 plateau and to test the previously proposed hypothesis. Both strong terrestrial sink, possibly due to LUC not fully accounted for in the records, and enhanced oceanic uptake are necessary to explain this stall.\n\nReconstructing the annual mass balance of the Echaurren Norte glacier (Central Andes, 33.5° S) using local and regional hydroclimatic data\n\nMariano H. Masiokas, Duncan A. Christie, Carlos LeÂ Quesne, Pierre Pitte, Lucas Ruiz, Ricardo Villalba, Brian H. Luckman, Etienne Berthier, Samuel U. Nussbaumer, Ãlvaro GonzÃ¡lez-Reyes, James McPhee, and Gonzalo Barcaza\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 927–940, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-927-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-927-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlacier Echaurren Norte (ECH, 34° S) has the longest (> 35 yrs) mass-balance record in South America. A minimal model that explains 78 % of the variance in the ECH annual record identifies precipitation as the most important forcing. A regional streamflow series allows for extending the ECH annual record back to 1909 and shows a clear cumulative ice-mass loss. Similarities with documented glacier advances and other shorter mass-balance series suggest the ECH reconstruction is regionally representative.\n\nSpatio-temporal variability of snow water equivalent in the extra-tropical Andes Cordillera from distributed energy balance modeling and remotely sensed snow cover\n\nE. Cornwell, N. P. Molotch, and J. McPhee\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 411–430, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-411-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-411-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a high-resolution snow water equivalent estimation for the 2001–2014 period over the extratropical Andes Cordillera of Argentina and Chile, the first of its type. The effect of elevation on accumulation is confirmed, although this is less marked in the northern portion of the domain. The 3000–4000 m a.s.l. elevation band contributes the bulk of snowmelt, but the 4000–5000 m a.s.l. band is a significant source and deserves further monitoring and research.\n\nImproving operational flood ensemble prediction by the assimilation of satellite soil moisture: comparison between lumped and semi-distributed schemes\n\nC. Alvarez-Garreton, D. Ryu, A. W. Western, C.-H. Su, W. T. Crow, D. E. Robertson, and C. Leahy\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 1659–1676, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-1659-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-1659-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assimilate satellite soil moisture into a rainfall-runoff model for improving flood prediction within a data-scarce region. We argue that the spatially distributed satellite data can alleviate the model prediction limitations. We show that satellite soil moisture DA reduces the uncertainty of the streamflow ensembles. We propose new techniques for the DA scheme, including seasonal error characterisation, bias correction of the satellite retrievals, and model error representation.\n\nHistorical land-use-induced evapotranspiration changes estimated from present-day observations and reconstructed land-cover maps\n\nJ. P. Boisier, N. de Noblet-DucoudrÃ©, and P. Ciais\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 649–668, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-649-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-649-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGround-based radar precipitation products typically need adjustment with rain gauge accumulations to achieve a reasonable accuracy. Crowdsourced rain gauge networks have a much higher density than conventional ones. Here, a 1-year personal weather station (PWS) gauge dataset is obtained. After quality control, the 1 h PWS gauge accumulations are merged with pan-European radar accumulations. The potential of crowdsourcing to improve radar precipitation products in (near) real time is confirmed.\n\nTechnical Note: Smartphone-based evapotranspiration monitoring\n\nAdriaan J. Teuling and Jasper F. D. Lammers\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3096,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3096, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe understanding of spatio-temporal variability of evapotranspiration is currently limited by a lack of measurement techniques that are low-cost, and that can be applied anywhere at any time. Here we show that evapotranspiration can be estimated accurately using only observations made by smartphone sensors, suggesting that smartphone-based ET monitoring could provide a realistic and low-cost alternative for real-time ET estimation in the field.\n\nStatistical characteristics of raindrop size distribution during rainy seasons in complicated mountain terrain\n\nWenqian Mao, Wenyu Zhang, and Menggang Kou\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3895–3910, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3895-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3895-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrop size distribution characteristics vary with microphysical characteristics. We choose the Qilian mountains and represent the southern and northern slopes and the interior. To investigate discrepancies, DSD characteristics and Z–R relationships are analyzed based on continuous observations in the rainy season. We obtain the finer precipitation of mountains and refine the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation, which would help develop cloud water resources in mountainous areas.\n\nEvaluation of precipitation measurement methods using data from a precision lysimeter network\n\nTobias Schnepper, Jannis Groh, Horst H. Gerke, Barbara Reichert, and Thomas PÃ¼tz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3265–3292, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3265-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3265-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compared hourly data from precipitation gauges with lysimeter reference data at three sites under different climatic conditions. Our results show that precipitation gauges recorded 33–96 % of the reference precipitation data for the period under consideration (2015–2018). Correction algorithms increased the registered precipitation by 9–14 %. It follows that when using point precipitation data, regardless of the precipitation measurement method used, relevant uncertainties must be considered.\n\nQuantitative rainfall analysis of the 2021 mid-July flood event in Belgium\n\nMichel JournÃ©e, Edouard Goudenhoofdt, StÃ©phane Vannitsem, and Laurent Delobbe\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3169–3189, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3169-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3169-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe exceptional flood of July 2021 in central Europe impacted Belgium severely. This study aims to characterize rainfall amounts in Belgium from 13 to 16 July 2021 based on observational data (i.e., rain gauge data and a radar-based rainfall product). The spatial and temporal distributions of rainfall during the event aredescribed. In order to document such a record-breaking event as much as possible, the rainfall data are shared with the scientific community on Zenodo for further studies.\n\nExploring patterns in precipitation intensity-duration-area-frequency relationships using weather radar data\n\nTalia Rosin, Francesco Marra, and Efrat Morin\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1530,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1530, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKnowledge of extreme precipitation probability at various spatial-temporal scales is crucial. We estimate extreme precipitation return levels at multiple scales (10 min–24 h, 0.25–500 km2) in the eastern Mediterranean using radar data. We show our estimates are comparable to those derived from averaged daily rain gauges. We then explore multi-scale extreme precipitation across coastal, mountainous, and desert regions.\n\nMulti-scale temporal analysis of evaporation on a saline lake in the Atacama Desert\n\nFelipe Lobos-Roco, Oscar Hartogensis, Francisco SuÃ¡rez, Ariadna Huerta-Viso, Imme Benedict, Alberto de la Fuente, and Jordi VilÃ -Guerau de Arellano\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3709–3729, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3709-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3709-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis research brings a multi-scale temporal analysis of evaporation in a saline lake of the Atacama Desert. Our findings reveal that evaporation is controlled differently depending on the timescale. Evaporation is controlled sub-diurnally by wind speed, regulated seasonally by radiation and modulated interannually by ENSO. Our research extends our understanding of evaporation, contributing to improving the climate change assessment and efficiency of water management in arid regions.\n\nCoastal and orographic effects on extreme precipitation revealed by weather radar observations\n\nFrancesco Marra, Moshe Armon, and Efrat Morin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 1439–1458, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1439-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1439-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new method for quantifying the probability of occurrence of extreme rainfall using radar data, and we use it to examine coastal and orographic effects on extremes. We identify three regimes, directly related to precipitation physical processes, which respond differently to these forcings. The methods and results are of interest for researchers and practitioners using radar for the analysis of extremes, risk managers, water resources managers, and climate change impact studies.\n\nUnshielded precipitation gauge collection efficiency with wind speed and hydrometeor fall velocity\n\nJeffery Hoover, Michael E. Earle, Paul I. Joe, and Pierre E. Sullivan\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 5473–5491, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5473-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5473-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTransfer functions with dependence on wind speed and precipitation fall velocity are evaluated alongside transfer functions with wind speed and temperature dependence for unshielded precipitation gauges. The transfer functions with fall velocity dependence reduced the RMSE of unshielded gauge measurements relative to the functions based on wind speed and temperature, demonstrating the importance of fall velocity for precipitation gauge collection efficiency and transfer functions.\n\nEvaluation of Integrated Nowcasting through Comprehensive AnalysisÂ (INCA) precipitation analysis using a dense rain-gauge network in southeastern Austria\n\nEsmail Ghaemi, Ulrich Foelsche, Alexander Kann, and JÃ¼rgen Fuchsberger\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 4335–4356, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-4335-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-4335-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assess an operational merged gauge–radar precipitation product over a period of 12 years, using gridded precipitation fields from a dense gauge network (WegenerNet) in southeastern Austria. We analyze annual data, seasonal data, and extremes using different metrics. We identify individual events using a simple threshold based on the interval between two consecutive events and evaluate the events' characteristics in both datasets.\n\nMicrophysical features of typhoon and non-typhoon rainfall observed in Taiwan, an island in the northwestern Pacific\n\nJayalakshmi Janapati, Balaji Kumar Seela, Pay-Liam Lin, Meng-Tze Lee, and Everette Joseph\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 4025–4040, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-4025-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-4025-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTyphoon (TY) and non-typhoon (NTY) rainy days in northern Taiwan summer seasons showed more large drops on NTY than TY rainy days. Relatively higher convective activity and drier conditions in NTY than TY lead to variations in microphysical characteristics between TY and NTY rainy days. The raindrop size distribution and kinetic energy relations assessed for TY and NTY rainfall can be useful for evaluating the radar rainfall estimation algorithms, cloud modeling, and rainfall erosivity studies.\n\nPartial energy balance closure of eddy covariance evaporation measurements using concurrent lysimeter observations over grassland\n\nPeter Widmoser and Dominik Michel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 1151–1163, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1151-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1151-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith respect to ongoing discussions about the causes of energy imbalance, a method for closing the latent heat flux gap based on lysimeter measurements is assessed at four measurement stations over grassland in humid and semiarid climates. The applied partial closure yields excellent adjustments of eddy covariance data as compared to results found in the literature. The method also allows a distinction between systematic and random deviation of eddy covariance and lysimeter measurements.\n\nRivers in the sky, flooding on the ground: the role of atmospheric rivers in inland flooding in central Europe\n\nMonica Ionita, Viorica Nagavciuc, and Bin Guan\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 5125–5147, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5125-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5125-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnalysis of the largest 10 floods in the lower Rhine, between 1817 and 2015, shows that all these extreme flood peaks have been preceded, up to 7 d in advance, by intense moisture transport from the tropical North Atlantic basin in the form of narrow bands also known as atmospheric rivers. The results presented in this study offer new insights regarding the importance of moisture transport as the driver of extreme flooding in the lower part of the Rhine catchment area.\n\nEvaluation of the WMO Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE) transfer functions for adjusting the wind bias in solid precipitation measurements\n\nCraig D. Smith, Amber Ross, John Kochendorfer, Michael E. Earle, Mareile Wolff, Samuel BuisÃ¡n, Yves-Alain Roulet, and Timo Laine\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 4025–4043, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4025-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4025-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring the World Meteorological Organization Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE), transfer functions were developed to adjust automated gauge measurements of solid precipitation for systematic bias due to wind. The transfer functions were developed by combining data from eight sites, attempting to make them more universally applicable in a range of climates. This analysis is an assessment of the performance of those transfer functions, using data collected when SPICE ended.\n\nRainfall estimation from a German-wide commercial microwave link network: optimized processing and validation for 1Â year of data\n\nMaximilian Graf, Christian Chwala, Julius Polz, and Harald Kunstmann\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2931–2950, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2931-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2931-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCommercial microwave links (CMLs), which form large parts of the backhaul from the ubiquitous cellular communication networks, can be used to estimate path-integrated rainfall rates. This study presents the processing and evaluation of the largest CML data set to date, covering the whole of Germany with almost 4000 CMLs. The CML-derived rainfall information compares well to a standard precipitation data set from the German Meteorological Service, which combines radar and rain gauge data.\n\nRadar-based characterisation of heavy precipitation in the eastern Mediterranean and its representation in a convection-permitting model\n\nMoshe Armon, Francesco Marra, Yehouda Enzel, Dorita Rostkier-Edelstein, and Efrat Morin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1227–1249, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1227-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1227-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHeavy precipitation events (HPEs), occurring around the globe, lead to natural hazards as well as to water resource recharge. Rainfall patterns during HPEs vary from one case to another and govern their effect. Thus, correct prediction of these patterns is crucial for coping with HPEs. However, the ability of weather models to generate such patterns is unclear. Here, we characterise rainfall patterns during HPEs based on weather radar data and evaluate weather model simulations of these events.\n\nEffect of disdrometer type on rain drop size distribution characterisation: a new dataset for south-eastern Australia\n\nAdrien Guyot, Jayaram Pudashine, Alain Protat, Remko Uijlenhoet, Valentijn R. N. Pauwels, Alan Seed, and Jeffrey P. Walker\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 4737–4761, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4737-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4737-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe characterised for the first time the rainfall microphysics for Southern Hemisphere temperate latitudes. Co-located instruments were deployed to provide information on the sampling effect and spatio-temporal variabilities at micro scales. Substantial differences were found across the instruments, increasing with increasing values of the rain rate. Specific relations for reflectivity–rainfall are presented together with related uncertainties for drizzle and stratiform and convective rainfall.\n\nQuantitative precipitation estimation with weather radar using a data- and information-based approach\n\nMalte Neuper and Uwe Ehret\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3711–3733, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3711-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3711-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we apply a data-driven approach to quantitatively estimate precipitation using weather radar data. The method is based on information theory concepts. It uses predictive relations expressed by empirical discrete probability distributions, which are directly derived from data rather than the standard deterministic functions.\n\nContinuous, near-real-time observations of water stable isotope ratios during rainfall and throughfall events\n\nBarbara Herbstritt, Benjamin Gralher, and Markus Weiler\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3007–3019, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3007-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3007-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe describe a novel technique for the precise, quasi real-time observation of water-stable isotopes in gross precipitation and throughfall from tree canopies in parallel. Various processes (e.g. rainfall intensity, evapotranspiration, exchange with ambient vapour) thereby control throughfall intensity and isotopic composition. The achieved temporal resolution now competes with common meteorological measurements, thus enabling new ways to employ water-stable isotopes in forested catchments.\n\nRain erosivity map for Germany derived from contiguous radar rain data\n\nKarl Auerswald, Franziska K. Fischer, Tanja Winterrath, and Robert Brandhuber\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1819–1832, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1819-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1819-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRadar rain data enable for the first time portraying the erosivity pattern with high spatial and temporal resolution. This allowed quantification of erosivity in Germany with unprecedented detail. Compared to previous estimates, erosivity has strongly increased and its seasonal distribution has changed, presumably due to climate change. As a consequence, erosion for some crops is 4 times higher than previously estimated.\n\nCitizen science flow â an assessment of simple streamflow measurement methods\n\nJeffrey C. Davids, Martine M. Rutten, Anusha Pandey, Nischal Devkota, Wessel David van Oyen, Rajaram Prajapati, and Nick van de Giesen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1045–1065, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1045-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1045-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWise management of water resources requires data. Nevertheless, the amount of water data being collected continues to decline. We evaluated potential citizen science approaches for measuring flows of headwater streams and springs. After selecting salt dilution as the preferred approach, we partnered with Nepali students to cost-effectively measure flows and water quality with smartphones at 264 springs and streams which provide crucial water supplies to the rapidly expanding Kathmandu Valley.\n\nDaily evaluation of 26 precipitation datasets using Stage-IV gauge-radar data for the CONUS\n\nHylke E. Beck, Ming Pan, Tirthankar Roy, Graham P. Weedon, Florian Pappenberger, Albert I. J. M. van Dijk, George J. Huffman, Robert F. Adler, and Eric F. Wood\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

The best overall performance was obtained by MSWEP V2.2, underscoring the importance of applying daily gauge corrections and accounting for reporting times. Our findings can be used as a guide to choose the most suitable precipitation dataset for a particular application.\n\nExploring the use of underground gravity monitoring to evaluate radar estimates of heavy rainfall\n\nLaurent Delobbe, Arnaud Watlet, Svenja Wilfert, and Michel Van Camp\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 93–105, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-93-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-93-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we explore the use of an underground superconducting gravimeter as a new source of in situ observations for the evaluation of radar-based precipitation estimates. The comparison of radar and gravity time series over 15 years shows that short-duration intense rainfall events cause a rapid decrease in the measured gravity. Rainfall amounts can be derived from this decrease. The gravimeter allows capture of rainfall at a much larger spatial scale than a traditional rain gauge.\n\nThe CAMELS-CL dataset: catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies â Chile dataset\n\nCamila Alvarez-Garreton, Pablo A.

Sci., 22, 5817–5846, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5817-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5817-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCAMELS-CL provides a catchment dataset in Chile, including 516 catchment boundaries, hydro-meteorological time series, and 70 catchment attributes quantifying catchments' climatic, hydrological, topographic, geological, land cover and anthropic intervention features. By using CAMELS-CL, we characterise hydro-climatic regional variations, assess precipitation and potential evapotranspiration uncertainties, and analyse human intervention impacts on catchment response.\n\nPrecipitation characteristics and associated weather conditions on the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rockies during MarchâAprilÂ 2015\n\nJulie M. ThÃ©riault, Ida Hung, Paul Vaquer, Ronald E. Stewart, and John W. Pomeroy\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 4491–4512, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-4491-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-4491-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrecipitation events associated with rain and snow on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, Canada, are a critical aspect of the regional water cycle. The goal is to characterize the precipitation and weather conditions in the Kananaskis Valley, Alberta, during a field experiment. Mainly dense solid precipitation reached the surface and occurred during downslope and upslope conditions. The precipitation phase has critical implications on the severity of flooding events in the area.\n\nDendrohydrology and water resources management in south-central Chile: lessons from the RÃ­o Imperial streamflow reconstruction\n\nAlfonso FernÃ¡ndez, Ariel MuÃ±oz, Ãlvaro GonzÃ¡lez-Reyes, Isabella Aguilera-Betti, Isadora Toledo, Paulina Puchi, David Sauchyn, SebastiÃ¡n Crespo, Cristian Frene, Ignacio Mundo, Mauro GonzÃ¡lez, and Raffaele Vignola\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2921–2935, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2921-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2921-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nShort-term river discharge records hamper assessment of the severity of modern droughts in south-central Chile, making effective water management difficult. To support decision-making, we present a ~300-year tree-ring reconstruction of summer discharge for this region. Results show that since 1980, droughts have become more frequent and are related to a shift in large-scale climate. We argue that water managers should use this long-term view to better allocate water rights.\n\nComparison of precipitation measurements by OTT Parsivel2 and Thies LPM optical disdrometers\n\nMarta Angulo-MartÃ­nez, Santiago BeguerÃ­a, Borja Latorre, and MarÃ­a FernÃ¡ndez-Raga\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2811–2837, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2811-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2811-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTwo optical disdrometers, OTT Parsivel2 disdrometer and Thies Clima laser precipitation monitor (LPM), are compared. Analysis of 2 years of one-minute replicated data showed significant differences. Thies LPM recorded a larger number of particles than Parsivel2 and a higher proportion of small particles, resulting in higher rain rates and amounts and differences in radar reflectivity and kinetic energy. Possible causes for these differences, and their practical consequences, are discussed.\n\nObtaining sub-daily new snow density from automated measurements in high mountain regions\n\nKay Helfricht, Lea Hartl, Roland Koch, Christoph Marty, and Marc Olefs\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2655–2668, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2655-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2655-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe calculated hourly new snow densities from automated measurements. This time interval reduces the influence of settling of the freshly deposited snow. We found an average new snow density of 68 kg m−3. The observed variability could not be described using different parameterizations, but a relationship to temperature is partly visible at hourly intervals. Wind speed is a crucial parameter for the inter-station variability. Our findings are relevant for snow models working on hourly timescales.\n\nDeriving surface soil moisture from reflected GNSS signal observations from a grassland site in southwestern France\n\nSibo Zhang, Jean-Christophe Calvet, JosÃ© Darrozes, Nicolas Roussel, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Frappart, and Gilles Bouhours\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1931–1946, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1931-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1931-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSurface soil moisture was retrieved from a grassland site in southwestern France using the GNSS-IR technique. In order to efficiently limit the impact of perturbing vegetation effects, the grass growth period and the senescence period are treated separately. While the vegetation biomass effect can be corrected for, the litter water interception influences the observations and cannot be easily accounted for.\n\nTesting and development of transfer functions for weighing precipitation gauges in WMO-SPICE\n\nJohn Kochendorfer, Rodica Nitu, Mareile Wolff, Eva Mekis, Roy Rasmussen, Bruce Baker, Michael E. Earle, Audrey Reverdin, Kai Wong, Craig D. Smith, Daqing Yang, Yves-Alain Roulet, Tilden Meyers, Samuel Buisan, Ketil Isaksen, Ragnar BrÃ¦kkan, Scott Landolt, and Al Jachcik\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 1437–1452, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1437-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1437-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDue to the effects of wind, precipitation gauges typically underestimate the amount of precipitation that occurs as snow. Measurements recorded during a World Meteorological Organization intercomparison of precipitation gauges were used to evaluate and improve the adjustments that are available to address this issue. Adjustments for specific types of precipitation gauges and wind shields were tested and recommended.\n\nTechnical note: Using distributed temperature sensing for Bowen ratio evaporation measurements\n\nBart Schilperoort, Miriam Coenders-Gerrits, Willem Luxemburg, CÃ©sar JimÃ©nez RodrÃ­guez, CÃ©sar Cisneros Vaca, and Hubert Savenije\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 819–830, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-819-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-819-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing the DTS technology, we measured the evaporation of a forest using fibre optic cables. The cables work like long thermometers, with a measurement every 12.5 cm. We placed the cables vertically along the tower, one cable being dry, the other kept wet. By looking at the dry and wet cable temperatures over the height we are able to study heat storage and the amount of water the forest is evaporating. These results can be used to better understand the storage and heat exchange of forests.\n\nEvaluation of GPM IMERG Early, Late, and Final rainfall estimates using WegenerNet gauge data in southeastern Austria\n\nSungmin O, Ulrich Foelsche, Gottfried Kirchengast, Juergen Fuchsberger, Jackson Tan, and Walter A. Petersen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 6559–6572, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6559-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6559-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluate gridded satellite rainfall estimates, from GPM IMERG, through a direct grid-to-grid comparison with gauge data from the WegenerNet Feldbach (WEGN) network in southeastern Austria. As the WEGN data are independent of the IMERG gauge adjustment process, we could analyze the IMERG estimates across its three different runs. Our results show the effects of additional retrieval processes on the final rainfall estimates, and consequently provide IMERG accuracy information for data users.\n\nMeasuring precipitation with a geolysimeter\n\nCraig D. Smith, Garth van der Kamp, Lauren Arnold, and Randy Schmidt\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 5263–5272, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5263-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5263-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis research provides an example of how groundwater pressures measured in deep observation wells can be used as a reliable estimate, and perhaps as a reference, for event-based precipitation. Changes in loading at the surface due to the weight of precipitation are transferred to the groundwater formation and can be measured in the observation well. Correlations in precipitation measurements made with the geolysimeter and the co-located sheltered precipitation gauge are high.\n\nConvective rainfall in a dry climate: relations with synoptic systems and flash-flood generation in the Dead Sea region\n\nIdit Belachsen, Francesco Marra, Nadav Peleg, and Efrat Morin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 5165–5180, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5165-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5165-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSpatiotemporal rainfall patterns in arid environments are not well-known. We derived properties of convective rain cells over the arid Dead Sea region from a long-term radar archive. We found differences in cell properties between synoptic systems and between flash-flood and non-flash-flood events. Large flash floods are associated with slow rain cells, directed downstream with the main catchment axis. Results from this work can be used for hydrological models and stochastic storm simulations.\n\nUse of reflected GNSS SNR data to retrieve either soil moisture or vegetation height from a wheat crop\n\nSibo Zhang, Nicolas Roussel, Karen Boniface, Minh Cuong Ha, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Frappart, JosÃ© Darrozes, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Baup, and Jean-Christophe Calvet\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 4767–4784, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4767-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4767-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGNSS SNR data were obtained from an intensively cultivated wheat field in southwestern France. The data were used to retrieve soil moisture and vegetation characteristics during the growing period of wheat. Vegetation growth broke up the constant height assumption used in soil moisture retrieval algorithms. Soil moisture could not be retrieved after wheat tillering. A new algorithm based on a wavelet analysis was implemented and used to retrieve vegetation height.\n\nWater-use dynamics of an alien-invaded riparian forest within the Mediterranean climate zone of the Western Cape, South Africa\n\nBruce C. Scott-Shaw, Colin S. Everson, and Alistair D. Clulow\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 4551–4562, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4551-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4551-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn South Africa, the invasion of riparian forests by alien trees has the potential to affect the limited water resources. To justify alien clearing programs, hydrological benefits are required. Spatial upscaling of measured sapflows showed that an alien stand used 6 times more water per unit area than the indigenous stand. A gain in groundwater recharge and/or streamflow would be achieved if the alien species were removed from riparian forests and rehabilitated back to their natural state.\n\nImpact of rainfall spatial aggregation on the identification of debris flow occurrence thresholds\n\nFrancesco Marra, Elisa Destro, Efthymios I. Nikolopoulos, Davide Zoccatelli, Jean Dominique Creutin, Fausto Guzzetti, and Marco Borga\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 4525–4532, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4525-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4525-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrevious studies have reported a systematic underestimation of debris flow occurrence thresholds, due to the use of sparse networks in non-stationary rain fields. We analysed high-resolution radar data to show that spatially aggregated estimates (e.g. satellite data) largely reduce this issue, in light of a reduced estimation variance. Our findings are transferable to other situations in which lower envelope curves are used to predict point-like events in the presence of non-stationary fields.\n\nArea-averaged evapotranspiration over a heterogeneous land surface: aggregation of multi-point EC flux measurements with a high-resolution land-cover map and footprint analysis\n\nFeinan Xu, Weizhen Wang, Jiemin Wang, Ziwei Xu, Yuan Qi, and Yueru Wu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 4037–4051, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4037-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4037-2017, 2017\n\nAnalysis of single-Alter-shielded and unshielded measurements of mixed and solid precipitation from WMO-SPICE\n\nJohn Kochendorfer, Rodica Nitu, Mareile Wolff, Eva Mekis, Roy Rasmussen, Bruce Baker, Michael E. Earle, Audrey Reverdin, Kai Wong, Craig D. Smith, Daqing Yang, Yves-Alain Roulet, Samuel Buisan, Timo Laine, Gyuwon Lee, Jose Luis C. Aceituno, Javier AlastruÃ©, Ketil Isaksen, Tilden Meyers, Ragnar BrÃ¦kkan, Scott Landolt, Al Jachcik, and Antti Poikonen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 3525–3542, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3525-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3525-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrecipitation measurements were combined from eight separate precipitation testbeds to create multi-site transfer functions for the correction of unshielded and single-Alter-shielded precipitation gauge measurements. Site-specific errors and more universally applicable corrections were created from these WMO-SPICE measurements. The importance and magnitude of such wind speed corrections were demonstrated.\n\nAnalysing surface energy balance closure and partitioning over a semi-arid savanna FLUXNET site in Skukuza, Kruger National Park, South Africa\n\nNobuhle P. Majozi, Chris M. Mannaerts, Abel Ramoelo, Renaud Mathieu, Alecia Nickless, and Wouter Verhoef\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 3401–3415, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3401-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3401-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study analysed the quality and partitioning of a 15-year surface energy dataset from Skukuza flux tower. The yearly mean energy balance ratio (EBR) was 0.93, with the dry season having the lowest ratio. Night ratio was lower than daytime, with analysis showing an increase in EBR with increase in friction velocity, which is also linked to time of day. The energy partitioning showed that sensible heat flux is the dominant portion in the dry season, and latent heat flux during the wet season.\n\nRainfall and streamflow sensor network design: a review of applications, classification, and a proposed framework\n\nJuan C. Chacon-Hurtado, Leonardo Alfonso, and Dimitri P. Solomatine\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 3071–3091, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3071-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3071-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper compiles most of the studies (as far as the authors are aware) on the design of sensor networks for measurement of precipitation and streamflow. The literature shows that there is no overall consensus on the methods for the evaluation of sensor networks, as different design criteria often lead to different solutions. This paper proposes a methodology for the classification of methods, and a general framework for the design of sensor networks.\n\nThe quantification and correction of wind-induced precipitation measurement errors\n\nJohn Kochendorfer, Roy Rasmussen, Mareile Wolff, Bruce Baker, Mark E. Hall, Tilden Meyers, Scott Landolt, Al Jachcik, Ketil Isaksen, Ragnar BrÃ¦kkan, and Ronald Leeper\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1973–1989, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-1973-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-1973-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnowfall measurements recorded using precipitation gauges are subject to significant underestimation due to the effects of wind. Using measurements recorded at two different precipitation test beds, corrections for unshielded gauges and gauges within different types of windshields were developed and tested. Using the new corrections, uncorrectable errors were quantified, and measurement biases were successfully eliminated.\n\nResponse of water vapour D-excess to land–atmosphere interactions in a semi-arid environment\n\nStephen D. Parkes, Matthew F. McCabe, Alan D. Griffiths, Lixin Wang, Scott Chambers, Ali Ershadi, Alastair G. Williams, Josiah Strauss, and Adrian Element\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 533–548, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-533-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-533-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDetermining atmospheric moisture sources is required for understanding the water cycle. The role of land surface fluxes is a particular source of uncertainty for moisture budgets. Water vapour isotopes have the potential to improve constraints on moisture sources. In this work relationships between water vapour isotopes and land–atmosphere exchange are studied. Results show that land surface evaporative fluxes play a minor role in the daytime water and isotope budgets in semi-arid environments.\n\nAreal rainfall estimation using moving cars – computer experiments including hydrological modeling\n\nEhsan Rabiei, Uwe Haberlandt, Monika Sester, Daniel Fitzner, and Markus Wallner\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 3907–3922, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-3907-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-3907-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe value of using moving cars for rainfall measurement purposes (RCs) was investigated with laboratory experiments by Rabiei et al. (2013). They analyzed the Hydreon and Xanonex optical sensors against different rainfall intensities. A continuous investigation of using RCs with the derived uncertainties from laboratory experiments for areal rainfall estimation as well as implementing the data in a hydrological model are addressed in this study.\n\nRecent changes and drivers of the atmospheric evaporative demand in the Canary Islands\n\nSergio M. Vicente-Serrano, Cesar Azorin-Molina, Arturo Sanchez-Lorenzo, Ahmed El Kenawy, Natalia MartÃ­n-HernÃ¡ndez, Marina PeÃ±a-Gallardo, Santiago BeguerÃ­a, and Miquel Tomas-Burguera\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 3393–3410, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-3393-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-3393-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work we analyse the recent evolution and meteorological drivers of the atmospheric evaporative demand in the Canary Islands. We found that the reference evapotranspiration increased by 18.2 mm decade−1 – on average – between 1961 and 2013, with the highest increase recorded during summer. This increase was mainly driven by changes in the aerodynamic component, caused by a statistically significant reduction of the relative humidity.\n\nA radar-based regional extreme rainfall analysis to derive the thresholds for a novel automatic alert system in Switzerland\n\nLuca Panziera, Marco Gabella, Stefano Zanini, Alessandro Hering, Urs Germann, and Alexis Berne\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 2317–2332, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-2317-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-2317-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a novel system to issue heavy rainfall alerts for predefined geographical regions by evaluating the sum of precipitation fallen in the immediate past and expected in the near future. In order to objectively define the thresholds for the alerts, an extreme rainfall analysis for the 159 regions used for official warnings in Switzerland was developed. It is shown that the system has additional lead time with respect to thunderstorm tracking tools targeted for convective storms.\n\nMaking rainfall features fun: scientific activities for teaching children aged 5–12 years\n\nAuguste Gires, Catherine L. Muller, Marie-Agathe leÂ Gueut, and Daniel Schertzer\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 1751–1763, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1751-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1751-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEducational activities are now a common channel to increase impact of research projects. Here, we present innovative activities for young children that aim to help them (and their teachers) grasp some of the complex underlying scientific issues in environmental fields. The activities developed are focused on rainfall: observation and modeling of rain drop size and the succession of dry and rainy days, and writing of a scientific book. All activities were implemented in classrooms.\n\nEstimating evaporation with thermal UAV data and two-source energy balance models\n\nH. Hoffmann, H. Nieto, R. Jensen, R. Guzinski, P. Zarco-Tejada, and T. Friborg\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 697–713, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-697-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-697-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThermal images collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are applied to algorithms originally developed to be operational with satellite images, in order to estimate evapotranspiration in very high resolution. It is concluded that the thermal UAV data can be used for model input and for other potential applications requiring good quality, consistent, and high resolution land surface temperature.\n\nSpatio-temporal assessment of WRF, TRMM and in situ precipitation data in aÂ tropical mountain environment (CordilleraÂ Blanca,Â Peru)\n\nL. Mourre, T. Condom, C. Junquas, T. Lebel, J. E.Â Sicart, R. Figueroa, and A. Cochachin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 125–141, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-125-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-125-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThree different types of gridded precipitation products are compared in a high glaciated tropical mountain environment (Cordillera Blanca, Peru): ground-based interpolation, a satellite-derived product (TRMM3B42), and outputs from the WRF regional climate model. While none of the products meets the challenge of representing both accumulated quantities and frequency of occurrence at the short timescale, we concluded that new methods should be used to merge those various precipitation products.\n\nHistorical changes in frequency of extreme floods in Prague\n\nL. Elleder\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 4307–4315, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-4307-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-4307-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA flood frequency analysis for the Vltava River catchment based on an interpretation of documentary sources was carried out for a major profile in Prague. Six flood-rich periods in total were identified for 1118â2013. The most important were in the 16th and 19th centuries. The territory of the present Czech Republic might have experienced in the past, extreme floods comparable, with regard to peak discharge (higher than or equal to Q10) and frequency, to the flood events recorded recently.\n\nCited articles"
