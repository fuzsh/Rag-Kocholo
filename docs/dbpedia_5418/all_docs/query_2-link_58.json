        "text": "Interviewing Helge Lund, the Chair of bp was not on my bingo card after only joining the company last year, but I‚Äôm grateful for what was a remarkable and rewarding experience! I had the opportunity to co-moderate a townhall with Helge, alongside Lucy Jackson and Gareth Burns ‚Äì VP of our venture capital arm. It was insightful learning more about Helge, the responsibilities of the chair and the board, his view on the company‚Äôs recent performance, and our outlook for the future. Reflecting on our conversation, I‚Äôm further inspired by our long-term purpose at bp, and I‚Äôm excited about contributing to our immediate targets. It was also a great experience working with members of Helge‚Äôs team, the ventures business, and the early careers leadership including Jo Jepson Reynolds, Emma Boon, Ben Ludlow, Helena Urquhart, Lucy Counsell, and Claire Palmer. Their teamwork, guidance and empathy are a testament to our values here at bp and I‚Äôm grateful to have received their support. #whoweare #team #leadership #energy #performance\n\nI am proud of and inspired by how deliberately we're moving about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I). It was a pleasure to represent bp at the UK Black Business Week and UK Black Business Show. This is the biggest event of its kind in Europe for black businesses, students, professionals, and allies, with over 10,000 attendees, 125 exhibitors and 70 speakers this year. I had the opportunity to speak as a panellist during the STEM Careers Fair ‚Äì sharing my experience with transitioning into work, and specifically joining bp‚Äôs innovation and engineering entity. Participating during the week, learning from various sessions, and networking with visitors at the bp stand was enriching. I was moved by the drive, passion, and warmth of the amazing colleagues across our business I had the opportunity to connect and work with, including Keisha, Juliette, Trevor, Omar, Rebecca, Camille, Jonathan, Katie, Robyn, Angela, Mohammad-Furqan, Debola, and Elias amongst others. Thanks to Kerry, Karen, Barbara, Kate, and their colleagues for coordinating our participation and all their efforts from the front lines and behind the scenes. üíö This is how we show up! #WhoWeAre #DiversityandInclusion #Careers #Technology #Business\n\nbp is on a journey to reimagine energy for people and the planet. Designing solutions with a humanised approach is crucial in enabling and achieving our ambition, as aptly expressed by Roger Rohatgi in his conversation with Russ Drury of Zeplin. With the support of the London Early Careers committee, I organised a design workshop where early career colleagues dedicated half a day to exploring the significance of human-centred design through various activities. Highlights during the event titled ‚ÄúDare to Design: A Metaverse, LEGOthon and Robotics Experience‚Äù included: ‚Ä¢ Exploring a digital museum in the metaverse and discovering bp‚Äôs experimentations with 3D and immersive environments. ‚Ä¢ Understanding how we are putting customers at the centre of design and bp‚Äôs design centre of excellence work in leading this, presented by Shey Cobley ‚Äì Head of our Design Studio. ‚Ä¢ Collaborating in teams to reimagine and build models for fuelling, EV charging and convenience forecourts of the future, using LEGOs. ‚Ä¢ Observing a robot dog demonstration and discussing its potential application in areas such as safety inspection for our production facilities. This could encompass tasks like reading gauges, predictive maintenance monitoring, and gas leak detection. Overall, it was a great learning and networking experience, massive thanks to Matthew B. and Sonia Baileys for leading the sessions and making the event a success! #LiveOurPurpose #bphxd #earlycareers #learninganddevelopment #design #tech\n\nWe are helping to inform and develop the next generation of energy professionals. This is the core purpose of the Ambassador Lecturer Program led by the SPE Young Member Engagement Committee (YMEC) and it was revitalising to see the passion of the SPE Warri Nigeria Section towards achieving this goal. I was honoured to provide guidance and support to existing and aspiring lecturers during this awareness session alongside Karen Ochie Nwosu and Olawale Ajayi, and was amazed by the quality questions which were raised about the process in applying to deliver ALPs and submitting feedback. The YMEC is committed to supporting all sections globally and I‚Äôll be working to ensure we update the information and guidance for ALPs before the end of the year. Please continue to send any queries regarding ALPs to the YMEC or myself directly. Thank you. #spe #ALPs #energy #youngprofessionals #education\n\nI can remember how inspired I felt during my first interaction with bp at my university‚Äôs career exhibition in autumn 2019. Hence, I was excited when I had the opportunity to participate in STEMFest, a hands-on exhibition for primary and secondary school students to meet and engage with North East businesses. Representing the company alongside some amazing colleagues mentioned below, we spent 3 days engaging with around 3,000 pupils towards inspiring today‚Äôs young people to have future careers in Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (STEM).* We enlightened the students about energy and its various sources, bp‚Äôs transition to an Integrated Energy Company, and our mega projects in ‚ÄòNet Zero Teesside‚Äô comprising power, hydrogen, and carbon capture & storage. We also conducted fun, interactive activities and experiments with them. It was such a rewarding experience engaging with the students and their teachers! Hopefully, some of them will be inspired to pursue careers in STEM, or even better, join bp‚Äôs various early careers programmes in the future and help us in reimagining energy for the people and the planet. Massive thanks to Sarah Ryan and Masudur Rahman for organising, and to Jenna, Sarah Jones, Jenath Kanagesan, Howard, Mathew, William, and Saskia for making the experience a success! *(STEM was also captured in this expo as Space, Technology, Energy & Environment, and Manufacturing). #whoweare #reimagineenergy #stemcareers #stemfest23 #education\n\nTerrific to be supporting bp‚Äôs initiatives to inspire and empower the next generation of digital and technology champions! It was a pleasure to host Osaze Ighodaro during our digital discovery week, providing an opportunity to learn about how we‚Äôre applying digital technology and ways of working to my part of our business. I‚Äôm pleased you found the shadowing experience valuable, Osaze, and I wish you all the best with University, life and everything else! ü§ó #discoverbp #digitaltransformation #digitalmindset #technology #innovation #shadowing\n\nLast month, I and my London committee teammates had the rewarding opportunity to organise an EV Experience Day for early career colleagues and visited the bp Pulse headquarters in Milton Keynes. bp pulse is a major player in the global Electric Vehicle (EV) charging space, with convenience and mobility being a pillar in bp's strategy, and EV charging among our five transition growth engines. Overall, the excursion which included learning sessions, EV charger demos, and networking was an enlightening experience in supercharging early career‚Äôs understanding of our EV business and how we‚Äôre enabling the transition to electric vehicles in the UK and globally. üîåüîã Thanks to Dan Mclaren for his massive efforts and care in hosting the group, and to Kellie Pennington, Wil Corker, Darren Cousins, Jody Owusu, and Jon McPhail for joining the panel session. #electricvehicles #talentandcapability #energyindustry #earlycareers #ev #energy\n\nGetting a first or even a new job can be a challenging process sometimes, especially for jobseekers without previous or ample experience. As part of the Virtual Careers Pathway Fair, the SPE Young Member Engagement Committee (YMEC) will be presenting a session on ‚ÄúLanding your first job - the Do's and Don‚Äôts‚Äù. During the pre-recorded session, I‚Äôll be discussing with career experts to provide insights that could potentially enable your job search, including: ‚Ä¢ Amanda Rico, Ph.D. ‚Äì Resume, Cover Letter & LinkedIn Specialist. ‚Ä¢ Hortense Viallard ‚Äì Recruiter at SLB. ‚Ä¢ Richa Bansal ‚Äì Career Strategy Coach and Founder of Pinkcareers. üóìÔ∏è Date: Wednesday, April 26th üïú Time: 12:30 UTC/13:30 BST) Register for free via this link: https://lnkd.in/gFaMpDAP to log and tune in on the day, and do check out for other beneficial sessions and network with energy professionals during the virtual careers fair happening from April 25th ‚Äì 27th. #career #recruitment #job #energyindustry Society of Petroleum Engineers International"
