        "text": "My first course, \"AI For Non-Techies\" is out now! AI is penetrating almost every industry (healthcare, construction, retail, manufacturing. You name it!) People in these fields may soon need to understand the basics of AI (just like they needed to learn about computers when computers arrived on the stage) This course is specially created for people from these non-IT fields. And most importantly, it's not your ordinary \"talking-head\" type of course. It's a visual extravagenza. Check it out by yourself. Some of it's features... 🎯🎯It's for every busy professional who is thinking of jumping on A.I. but is stuck due to time constraints. ➡️➡️ Because it can be completed in just 1-hour! 🎯🎯It's for every \"visual learner\" person. ➡️➡️ Because it's created with EXCEPTIONAL visuals and animations. I did this to help you understand the foundational concepts of AI, without a burden on your mind! (It's not a typical boring lecture-type course). Took lots of effort! 🎯🎯And it's for every cost-savvy person. ➡️➡️ Because you can get very high-quality AI training, for just $37. If you or your employees are looking for a way to get started with AI, this may be the perfect course for you. Go ahead and get it here 👉👉\n\nHow not to be AI-Literate in the 21st Century! 👀📚 No, we didn't make a typo in the title. You see, being AI-literate is no longer an option - it's a necessity. But there are still professionals who are hesitant to embrace this new-age technology. From improving operational efficiencies to predictive analytics, AI creates unmatched value for businesses. Yet, hurdles such as unrealistic expectations and lack of understanding often stifle its adoption. So yes, learning how not to be AI-Literate could mean missing out on opportunities and getting left behind in this fast-paced world. Let's champion continuous learning and stay ahead of the curve! 🚀\n\nExcited to have just finished this course on “Generative AI in Learning and Development” by Dr. Terri Horton and deepen my understanding of how GenAI can and will revolutionize Learning and Development! We're all witnessing the power of GenAI and know it’s not going anywhere, it will only keep improving from here but it's not just about its capabilities—it's about how we utilize and engage with it that truly enhances our effectiveness in the L&D world. GenAI can cater to individual learning needs in ways unattainable before within the same time constraints, therefore enhancing retention and engagement for learners. 💭 Fun Fact: Incorporating GenAI tools can turbocharge productivity by an impressive 14%! 💡 Sounds like a win to me!\n\nI NEED YOUR HELP! My proposal for the SXSW EDU 2025 conference has moved on to the next round and is now open for community voting and I need your support! This is an important step to bringing my work on #AI and #Education to a larger audience. Here you can learn more about my proposed session: \"Being Human-Centered in the AI-Powered Future of Learning\": https://lnkd.in/gWBApFWW Voting is open until August 12th (so sorry if you get sick of this on your feed this week!). Here is my description of my proposed session: There is little question that generative artificial intelligence is disrupting the work of human learning, and this particularly true in formal education. This session explores how we ensure that our work is fundamentally and unapologetically human-centered. This means that we must change our language, our underlying approach to how we leverage technology in the work of learning, and how we design and deploy our learning communities at all ages and stages. This human-centered approach helps us begin to answer some of the most difficult and complex questions facing us in the future of learning. Please consider voting and sharing with your networks!"
