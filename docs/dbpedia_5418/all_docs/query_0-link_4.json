Thus not only do I feel qualified to give my input as if it is informed, my input is absolutely informed. I am lol'ing both at your passive-aggressiveness and how you think that somehow, I have not played on Thornblade enough to know what goes on. Or do you think I don't have friends on EP or something?\n\nWCFC did play on Thornblade for a while. They are a multi-campaigns guild. They have helped EP but I don't consider them the most important factor of why EP was far ahead in the lead for a while.\n\nMaybe not during U.S. primetime. But they certainly were during other hours, where potential points become far more important. They suddenly appeared on Thornblade en force and stopped doing the same on Chillrend for a reason.\n\nEP lead diminished when Venatus came back on Thornblade for a week and when they got all scrolls and turned the map yellow on multiple occasions.\n\nI recommend a thorough study of a human phenomenon: confirmation bias. Yellow and Red left Chillrend for Thornblade; this is what we wanted in the first place. Sadly, Thornblade no longer seems to be able to handle the load.\n\nEP lead diminished when No Mercy guested on Thornblade for a week and capped EP home keeps several times in a row.\n\nWe never stopped playing there buddy lol.\n\nEP lead diminished when we started getting double teamed constantly.\n\nBrb Night/Day caps scrolls.

I'm not blaming them btw, this is pure common sense to create an alliance (with communication or not) to get the winning faction down.\n\nNot during primetime. But during off hours? Yeah sure.\n\nI love this notion that \"night capping\" or \"morning capping\" is wrong or weak sauce. NONE of us can control when each alliance has a peak in population or when others don't. Oh I guess the \"offending capping alliance\" should just park in their home keeps and do nothing till EP hits 3+ bars on the population. ALL alliances do what they can and when PERIOD. Once again a thread that was done in an effort to solicit feedback from ALL players has become a pissing match.\n\nI for one enjoy playing on a highly populated server so I play on Thornblade. If this changes then I will change and most likely those in my PvP guild would also. We all try and follow the action and right now the most competitive and action intensive seems to be Thornblade.

If EP (example) has 70 guys on TB at 3 am EST while DC has 15 and AD 40, all 3 populations are very low so points should barely count, and EP's score should be further reduced for their population advantage. In the current system, they would get the same score during tri-poplocked primetime, which is ridiculous. Basically, more people overall should = more points, and less people in your faction relative to the others should = more points. The current underdog bonuses in place are not effective.\n\nWould fix nightcapping, and winning by numbers.\n\nGuys, crashes occur even on the other PvP-Servers, it is not a matter of general server population BUT IT is a matter of technique, whenever \"too many\" players (and that can be 50+) come together in one place, especially organized groups spamming gtae-heals (partly!).\n\nProfessional players have already discovered that and don't mind which server they play.. What matters is which area you play and not which server... The problems are home made and are situated in the software code, nothing else.\n\nSwitching the server only helps for having \"less\" places where crashes occur, so you just have less crashes but they are frustrating in the same way as crashes on o.p. servers, cause they occur in \"the most important moments of battle\". You can have 5 consecutive crashes on not-so-much crowded servers if you are in an area with 100 players of which 5-10 are spamming healing springs..\n\nCrashes occur everywhere, left and right, whenever a really interesting battle is going on, whenever too many players of different factions are in one area and use the \"wrong\" skills. Players affected by constant crashes should avoid any bigger encounters..\n\nI love this notion that \"night capping\" or \"morning capping\" is wrong or weak sauce.

I'm from Oztralia and I'm on from 4am est every night after work. There were only a few days where EP owned the map. I've come online sometimes to see EP own 0 keeps and 0 or 1 scroll and we have to fight very hard to make back any ground. Sure there were some good days but also plenty of bad days. Another thing: I have not seen a day this month where EP had more bars than AD. It's always been equal or in favour of AD.To me it seems very balanced all 3 alliances separated only by a handful of points with only 3 days to go.\n\nI agree your alliance has fewer numbers but maybe that's what comes of being split across two servers while EP is all on one server. You already win your home server. Must you win your guest one as well?"
