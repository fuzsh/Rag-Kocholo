Further, the security of the proposed system is enhanced by using non-stationary dynamics in the master and/or non-stationary synchronization manifolds. The specific examples using modified Ikeda systems demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed system\n\nOCGen Module Mooring Project\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMcEntee, Jarlath [Ocean Renewable Power Company, LLC, Portland, ME (United States)\n\n2015-02-06\n\nOcean Renewable Power Company's OCGen Module Mooring Project provided an extensive research, design, development, testing and data collection effort and analysis conducted with respect to a positively buoyant, submerged MHK device secured to the seabed using a tensioned mooring system. Different analytic tools were evaluated for their utility in the design of submerged systems and their moorings. Deployment and testing of a prototype OCGenÂ® system provided significant data related to mooring line loads and system attitude and station keeping. Mooring line loads were measured in situ and reported against flow speeds. The Project made a significant step in the development of designs, methodologies and practices related to floating and mooring of marine hydrokinetic (MHK) devices. Importantly for Ocean Renewable Power Company, the Project provided a sound basis for advancing a technically and commercially viable OCGenÂ® Power System. The OCGenÂ® Power System is unique in the MHK industry and, in itself, offers distinct advantages of MHK devices that are secured to the seabed using fixed structural frames. Foremost among these advantages are capital and operating cost reductions and increased power extraction by allowing the device to be placed at the most energetic level of the water column.\n\nProject Management with IT Security Focus\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nFelician Alecu; Paul Pocatilu; Sergiu Capisizu\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe paper focus on the main key points related to the IT security project management. The most important lifecycle stages are identified: IT security project proposal definition, project organization, project planning, quality planning, project team organization, IT security project activities management and project closing. The most important success factors for IT security projects are the support of top-management, customer satisfaction, prevention over remediation and continuous progress....\n\nMixing chaos modulations for secure communications in OFDM systems\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSeneviratne, Chatura; Leung, Henry\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn this paper, we consider a novel chaotic OFDM communication scheme is to improve the physical layer security. By secure communication we refer to physical layer security that provides low probability of detection (LPD)/low probability of intercept (LPI) transmission. A mixture of chaotic modulation schemes is used to generate chaotically modulated symbols for each subcarrier of the OFDM transmitter. At the receiver, different demodulators are combined together for the different modulation schemes for enhanced security. Time domain, frequency domain and statistical randomness tests show that transmit signals are indistinguishable from background noise. BER performance comparison shows that the physical layer security of the proposed scheme comes with a slight performance degradation compared to conventional OFDM communication systems.\n\nSecurity Risk Assessment in Software Development Projects\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSvendsen, Heidi\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSoftware security is increasing in importance, linearly with vulnerabilities caused by software flaws.

The module is designed to provide improved training and testing capabilities for control center operators through the use of simulations for perimeter equipment operations. Operators, through the trainer module, can be challenged with a variety of realistic situations which require responsive action identical to that needed in an actual system. This permits a consistent evaluation and confirmation of operator capabilities prior to assignment as an operator and allows for periodic retesting to verify that adequate performance levels are maintained\n\nNational Security Technology Incubation Project Continuation Plan\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNone\n\n2008-09-30\n\nThis document contains a project continuation plan for the National Security Technology Incubator (NSTI). The plan was developed as part of the National Security Preparedness Project (NSPP) funded by a Department of Energy (DOE)/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) grant. This continuation plan describes the current status of NSTI (staffing and clients), long-term goals, strategies, and long-term financial solvency goals.The Arrowhead Center of New Mexico State University (NMSU) is the operator and manager of the NSTI. To realize the NSTI, Arrowhead Center must meet several performance objectives related to planning, development, execution, evaluation, and sustainability.

The proposed system consists of a Chaotic Modulator (CM), a Chaotic Secure Transmitter (CST), a Chaotic Secure Receiver (CSR) and a Chaotic Demodulator (CDM). The CM module incorporates a chaotic system and a novel Chaotic Differential Peaks Keying (CDPK) modulation scheme to generate analog patterns corresponding to the input digital bits. The CST and CSR modules are designed such that a single scalar signal is transmitted in the public channel. Furthermore, by giving certain structural conditions of a particular class of chaotic system, the CST and the nonlinear observer-based CSR with an appropriate observer gain are constructed to synchronize with each other. These two slave systems are driven simultaneously by the transmitted signal and are designed to synchronize and generate appropriate cryptography keys for encryption and decryption purposes. In the CDM module, a nonlinear observer is designed to estimate the chaotic modulating system in the CM. A demodulation mechanism is then applied to decode the transmitted input digital bits. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through the numerical simulation of an illustrative communication system. Synchronization between the chaotic circuits of the transmitter and receiver modules is guaranteed through the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, the security features of the proposed system in the event of attack by an intruder in either the time domain or the frequency domain are discussed\n\nwebinos project deliverable: Phase 1 Security Framework\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nwebinos consortium\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe webinos project aims to deliver a cross-device web application runtime environment, providing a unified development platform and standardized inter-device communication and interaction.

W.; Du, J. G.; Yin, J. L.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThis paper proposes a novel secured communication scheme in a chaotic system by applying generalized function projective synchronization of the nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equation. This phenomenal approach guarantees a secured and convenient communication. Our study applied the Melnikov theorem with an active control strategy to suppress chaos in the system. The transmitted information signal is modulated into the parameter of the nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equation in the transmitter and it is assumed that the parameter of the receiver system is unknown. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and the adaptive control technique, the controllers are designed to make two identical nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equation with the unknown parameter asymptotically synchronized. The numerical simulation results of our study confirmed the validity, effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed novel synchronization method and error estimate for a secure communication. The Chaos masking signals of the information communication scheme, further guaranteed a safer and secured information communicated via this approach.\n\nA secure communication scheme using projective chaos synchronization\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLi Zhigang; Xu Daolin\n\n2004-01-01\n\nMost secure communication schemes using chaotic dynamics are based on identical synchronization. In this paper, we show the possibility of secure communication using projective synchronization (PS). The unpredictability of the scaling factor in projective synchronization can additionally enhance the security of communication. It is also showed that the scaling factor can be employed to improve the robustness against noise contamination. The feasibility of the communication scheme in high-dimensional chaotic systems, such as the hyperchaotic Roessler system, is demonstrated. Numerical results show the success in transmitting a sound signal through chaotic systems\n\nA secure communication scheme based generalized function projective synchronization of a new 5D hyperchaotic system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWu, Xiangjun; Fu, Zhengye; Kurths, JÃ¼rgen\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this paper, a new five-dimensional hyperchaotic system is proposed based on the LÃ¼ hyperchaotic system. Some of its basic dynamical properties, such as equilibria, Lyapunov exponents, bifurcations and various attractors are investigated. Furthermore, a new secure communication scheme based on generalized function projective synchronization (GFPS) of this hyperchaotic system with an uncertain parameter is presented. The communication scheme is composed of the modulation, the chaotic receiver, the chaotic transmitter and the demodulation. The modulation mechanism is to modulate the message signal into the system parameter. Then the chaotic signals are sent to the receiver via a public channel. In the receiver end, by designing the controllers and the parameter update rule, GFPS between the transmitter and receiver systems is achieved and the unknown parameter is estimated simultaneously. The message signal can be finally recovered by the identified parameter and the corresponding demodulation method. There is no any limitation on the message size. Numerical simulations are performed to show the validity and feasibility of the presented secure communication scheme.

These declarations could contain confidential information and until recently the only mechanism to submit confidential information to the OPCW Technical Secretariat was through physical delivery by the permanent representatives of the member states which introduced delays in the exchange of information in general. In 2012, the Technical Secretariat initiated a strategic project to establish a secure electronic transmission channel that could be used as an alternative option for the exchange of information between the Technical Secretariat and the member states. The Secure Information Exchange (SIX) Project has been given priority by the Director-General and it received support from the member states. A core project team comprising representatives of the main business unit, the office of legal affairs, IT security and implementation teams were established. Following a feasibility study and with continuous communication with the representatives of the member states, the pilot phase of the project was completed successfully in 2013. In the near future, the project will go live and the member states and the Technical Secretariat will benefit from this key initiative. This paper aims to provide an overview of the project: the solution approach, data gathered in order to assess the delays in communication through traditional means, IT security and implementation issues as well as the legal considerations.

The dependence of the Eastern European countries to the Russian gas and petroleum generated for most of the local governments a feeling of inferiority that they were willing to replace if the opportunity will be offered. One of the main alternative projects to the Russian gas is the Nabucco Project designed to enable the access to Caspian gas for all the European countries. Knowing that a decision on the realization of the pipeline should be made by the end of June 2013, our article will try to illustrate the importance of the Nabucco Project for the regional and European energy security by studying the history of the project, the competing projects and the recent political evolutions of the project. This will enable researchers, decision makers and policy makers in the energy sector to better evaluate the Nabucco project and better act into promoting it.\n\nSecurity Injections 2.0: Increasing Engagement and Faculty Adoption Using Enhanced Secure Coding Modules for Lower-Level Programming Courses\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nRaina , Sagar; Taylor , Blair; Kaza , Siddharth\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPart 2: Software Security Education; International audience; Learning interventions based on modules are common in computer science education.

The unpredictability of the scaling factor in PS can additionally enhance the security of communications. In this paper, a scheme for secure message transmission is proposed, and we try to transmit more than one large or bounded message from the transmitter to the receiver. The new hyperchaotic complex Lorenz system is employed to encrypt these messages. In the transmitter, the original messages are modulated into its parameter. In the receiver, we assume that the parameter of the receiver system is uncertain. The controllers and corresponding parameter update law are constructed to achieve PS between the transmitter and receiver system with an uncertain parameter, and identify the unknown parameter via passive theory. The original messages can be recovered successfully through some simple operations by the estimated parameter. Numerical results have verified the effectiveness and feasibility of the presented method.

Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 2004;19(4):919-24] proposed a simple modulation method aiming to improve the security of chaos-based secure communications against return-map-based attacks. Soon this modulation method was independently cryptanalyzed by Chee et al. [Chee CY, Xu D, Bishop SR. Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 2004;21(5):1129-34], Wu et al. [Wu X, Hu H, Zhang B.

Future projections suggest that the growth of fossil fuel use in Northeast Asia, especially in China, will have major consequences for financial and fuel markets and pollution both regionally and globally. Before the project described in this paper was initiated, there was no ongoing forum for energy experts from all of the countries of the region to meet, informally and in an unofficial capacity, to discuss openly and in a targeted fashion the energy situations in their countries, and to work together to evaluate the energy efficiency costs and benefits of different ways of meeting regional demand. The Asian Energy Security (AES) project provides such a forum, and as such constitutes a unique resource in the engagement of the countries of Northeast Asia on the topic of energy security.\n\nBio-Security Proficiencies Project for Beginning Producers in 4-H\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSmith, Martin H.; Meehan, Cheryl L.; Borba, John A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nImproving bio-security practices among 4-H members who raise and show project animals is important.

This has led to a growing concern regarding the potential for theft and/or diversion and accountability of this material. Straight-Line is a project whose purpose is to demonstrate a site-independent system to monitor stored nuclear material (e.g. plutonium) and integrate the collection, processing and dissemination of information regarding this material. Safeguards and security (S ampersand S) goals of this project include data transfer of information on nuclear material to appropriate users to enhance S ampersand S, continuous on-line accountability, reduction of hands-on access to nuclear materials, incorporation of information security technologies, and early detection of tampering or unauthorized material movement. This paper addresses threat considerations, S ampersand S requirements, S ampersand S objectives, and issues for the Straight-Line project.

This process systematically integrates S and S planning into construction, facility modifications or upgrades, mission changes, and operational projects. It extends and expands the opportunities provided by the DOE project management manual, DOE M 413.3-1. Through a series of LANL documents, a process is defined and implemented that formally identifies an S and S professional to oversee, coordinate, facilitate, and communicate among the identified S and S organizations and the project organizations over the life cycle of the project. The derived benefits, namely (1) elimination/reduction of re-work or costly retrofitting, (2) overall project cost savings because of timely and improved planning, (3) formal documentation, and (4) support of Integrated Safeguards and Security Management at LANL, will be discussed. How many times, during the construction of a new facility or the modification of an existing facility, have the persons responsible for the project waited until the last possible minute or until after construction is completed to approach the security organizations for their help in safeguarding and securing the facility? It's almost like, 'Oh, by the way, do we need access control and a fence around this building and just what are we going to do with our classified anyway?' Not only is it usually difficult; it's also typically expensive to retrofit or plan for safeguards and security after the fact. Safeguards and security organizations are often blamed for budget overruns and delays in facility occupancy and program startup, but these problems are usually due to poor front-end planning. In an effort to help projects engage safeguards and security in the pre-conceptual or conceptual stages, we implemented a high level formality of operations.

Any attacks and disturbances to land freight and passenger transport would have significant impact on economic growth, territorial cohesion, social development and the environment. Unfortunately, there are weaknesses in the land transport security.The objective of CARONTE project is define a future research agenda for security in land transport that focuses on core gaps caused by emerging risks while avoiding any doubling-up of research elsewhere. Its research agenda will cover all threats, including cyber-crime, and security aspects across all modes of land transportation. At the same time, it will respect the fundamental human rights and privacy of European citizens. The step-by-step method of CARONTEâs consortium has analyzed the state of the art and emerging risks; has identified gaps, analyses and assessments of potential solutions; and has produced an overall research agenda for the future. CARONTEâs results will answer the following questions among others: Which existing research projects merit a follow up and extension? Where are the combinations or synergy effects to be attended? Which themes and topics should be elaborated in new research projects? Who should be involved and integrated in future research projects (stakeholders, authorities, etc.)? The CARONTE consortium includes universities and research institutes, companies, and end-users providing with experience in research and consultancy in transportation, logistics, infrastructure management, security and communications.

Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow (Russian Federation)\n\n2013-07-31\n\nIn functional analysis, there are several diverse approaches to the notion of projective module. We show that a certain general categorical scheme contains all basic versions as special cases. In this scheme, the notion of free object comes to the foreground, and, in the best categories, projective objects are precisely retracts of free ones. We are especially interested in the so-called metric version of projectivity and characterize the metrically free classical and quantum (= operator) normed modules. Informally speaking, so-called extremal projectivity, which was known earlier, is interpreted as a kind of 'asymptotical metric projectivity'. In addition, we answer the following specific question in the geometry of normed spaces: what is the structure of metrically projective modules in the simplest case of normed spaces? We prove that metrically projective normed spaces are precisely the subspaces of l{sub 1}(M) (where M is a set) that are denoted by l{sub 1}{sup 0}(M) and consist of finitely supported functions. Thus, in this case, projectivity coincides with freeness.

The project demonstrated the capability to shift, balance, and reduce load where and when needed in response to system contingencies or emergencies by leveraging controllable field assets. The range of field assets includes curtailable customer loads, distributed generation (DG), battery storage, electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, building management systems (BMS), home area networks (HANs), high-voltage monitoring, and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). The SGDP enables the seamless integration and control of these field assets through a common, cyber-secure, interoperable control platform, which integrates a number of existing legacy control and data systems, as well as new smart grid (SG) systems and applications. By integrating advanced technologies for monitoring and control, the SGDP helps target and reduce peak load growth, improves the reliability and efficiency of Con Edisonâs grid, and increases the ability to accommodate the growing use of distributed resources. Con Edison is dedicated to lowering costs, improving reliability and customer service, and reducing its impact on the environment for its customers. These objectives also align with the policy objectives of New York State as a whole. To help meet these objectives, Con Edisonâs long-term vision for the distribution grid relies on the successful integration and control of a growing penetration of distributed resources, including demand response (DR) resources, battery storage units, and DG. For example, Con Edison is expecting significant long-term growth of DG\n\n[Principles and methodology for ecological rehabilitation and security pattern design in key project construction].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, Li-Ding; Lu, Yi-He; Tian, Hui-Ying; Shi, Qian\n\n2007-03-01\n\nGlobal ecological security becomes increasingly important with the intensive human activities. The function of ecological security is influenced by human activities, and in return, the efficiency of human activities will also be affected by the patterns of regional ecological security. Since the 1990s, China has initiated the construction of key projects \"Yangtze Three Gorges Dam\", \"Qinghai-Tibet Railway\", \"West-to-East Gas Pipeline\", \"West-to-East Electricity Transmission\" and \"South-to-North Water Transfer\" , etc. The interaction between these projects and regional ecological security has particularly attracted the attention of Chinese government. It is not only important for the regional environmental protection, but also of significance for the smoothly implementation of various projects aimed to develop an ecological rehabilitation system and to design a regional ecological security pattern. This paper made a systematic analysis on the types and characteristics of key project construction and their effects on the environment, and on the basis of this, brought forward the basic principles and methodology for ecological rehabilitation and security pattern design in this construction. It was considered that the following issues should be addressed in the implementation of a key project: 1) analysis and evaluation of current regional ecological environment, 2) evaluation of anthropogenic disturbances and their ecological risk, 3) regional ecological rehabilitation and security pattern design, 4) scenario analysis of environmental benefits of regional ecological security pattern, 5) re-optimization of regional ecological system framework, and 6) establishment of regional ecosystem management plan.\n\nIntegration Of The Security Sub-Modules Elements In The Automotive Industry\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGallego, C.; Fernandez, M.; Caires, A. S.; Canibano, E.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis study is addressed to obtain a design methodology for integrated security sub-modules (constituting the suspension and steering modules) in the car manufacturing industry. The sub-modules are made up of a steel structure and anchorage elements (rubber-metal or plastic-metal), which undergo separate surface treatments to prevent corrosion. Afterwards, the elements are traditionally joined by means of adhesives and screws. This process involves a great number of stages, low quality union methods and generation of corrosion areas that shorten its useful life.This methodology provides automotive suppliers an additional added value and cost reduction, allowing them to increase its competitiveness in a sector that faces the transition from the traditional supply chain to a strategic value chain\n\nPayment card industry data security standard : readiness project\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nÎÎµÏÎ³Î­ÏÎ·Ï, ÎÎ¹ÏÎ±Î®Î»\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper is my thesis as part of my studies at the Department of Informatics, at University of Piraeus for the Postgraduate Programme in âTechno-economic Management & Security of Digital Systemsâ.

The first phase of the project involved a food audit in one lower income area that was typical of the region, to identify the range, variety and availability of foods in the region. Methods A comprehensive food audit survey was provided to all food outlet owners/operators in one lower socio-economic region within the City of Mandurah (n = 132 outlets. The purpose of the survey was to investigate the range, variety and availability of foods in the Mandurah region as well as examining specific in-store characteristics such as the types of clientele and in-store promotions offered. Surveys were competed for 99 outlets (response rate = 75%. Results The range of foods available were predominantly pre-prepared with more than half of the outlets pre-preparing the majority of their food. Sandwiches and rolls were the most popular items sold in the outlets surveyed (n = 51 outlets followed by pastries such as pies, sausage rolls and pasties (n = 33 outlets. Outlets considered their healthiest food options were sandwiches or rolls (n = 51 outlets, salads (n- = 50 outlets, fruit and vegetables (n = 40 outlets, seafood (n = 27 outlets, meats such as chicken (n = 26 outlets and hot foods such as curries, soups or quiches (n = 23 outlets. The majority of outlets surveyed considered pre-prepared food including sandwiches, rolls and salads, as healthy food options regardless of the content of the filling or dressings used. Few outlets (n = 28% offered a choice of bread type other than white or wholemeal. High fat pastries and dressings were popular client choices (n = 77% as were carbonated drinks (n = 88% and flavoured milks (n = 46%.

The photon pairs are either absorbed or not absorbed (transparent) by an atomic or molecular fluorescer in a receiver, depending on the inter-beam delay that is introduced in the entangled photon pairs. Upon the absorption, corresponding fluorescent optical emissions follow at a certain wavelength, which are then detected by a photon detector. The advantage of the disclosed system is that it eliminates a need of a coincidence counter to realize the entanglement-based secure optical communications because the absorber acts as a coincidence counter for entangled photon pairs.\n\nBreaking projective chaos synchronization secure communication using filtering and generalized synchronization\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAlvarez, G.; Li Shujun; Montoya, F.; Pastor, G.; Romera, M.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis paper describes the security weaknesses of a recently proposed secure communication method based on chaotic masking using projective synchronization of two chaotic systems.

This system is coupled by two parameter-varied optoelectronic delayed feedback systems with chaotic modulation.

Furthermore, this system can conceal the time delay effectively against the autocorrelation function and delayed mutual information method and can increase the dimension space of secure parameters to resist brute-force attack by introducing the digital chaotic systems.\n\nGeneralized projective synchronization via the state observer and its application in secure communication\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWu Di; Li Juan-Juan\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBased on the improved state observer and the pole placement technique, by adding a constant which extends the scope of use of the original system, a new design method of generalized projective synchronization is proposed. With this method, by changing the projective synchronization scale factor, one can achieve not only complete synchronization, but also anti-synchronization, as well as arbitrary percentage of projective synchronization, so that the system may attain arbitrary synchronization in a relatively short period of time, which makes this study more meaningful. By numerical simulation, and choosing appropriate scale factor, the results of repeated experiments verify that this method is highly effective and satisfactory. Finally, based on this method and the relevant feedback concept, a novel secure communication project is designed. Numerical simulation verifies that this secure communication project is very valid, and moreover, the experimental result has been greatly improved in decryption time.

The aim of the improvement is to avoid the breaking of chaotic encryption schemes by means of the return map attack introduced by Perez and Cerdeira. A method of attack based on taking the absolute value of the ciphertext is presented, that allows for the cancellation of the modulation scalar signal and the determination of some system parameters that play the role of system key. The proposed improved method is shown to be compromised without any knowledge of the chaotic system parameter values and even without knowing the transmitter structure\n\nFrequency position modulation using multi-spectral projections\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGoodman, Joel; Bertoncini, Crystal; Moore, Michael; Nousain, Bryan; Cowart, Gregory\n\n2012-10-01\n\nIn this paper we present an approach to harness multi-spectral projections (MSPs) to carefully shape and locate tones in the spectrum, enabling a new and robust modulation in which a signal's discrete frequency support is used to represent symbols. This method, called Frequency Position Modulation (FPM), is an innovative extension to MT-FSK and OFDM and can be non-uniformly spread over many GHz of instantaneous bandwidth (IBW), resulting in a communications system that is difficult to intercept and jam. The FPM symbols are recovered using adaptive projections that in part employ an analog polynomial nonlinearity paired with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling at a rate at that is only a fraction of the IBW of the signal. MSPs also facilitate using commercial of-the-shelf (COTS) ADCs with uniform-sampling, standing in sharp contrast to random linear projections by random sampling, which requires a full Nyquist rate sample-and-hold. Our novel communication system concept provides an order of magnitude improvement in processing gain over conventional LPI/LPD communications (e.g., FH- or DS-CDMA) and facilitates the ability to operate in interference laden environments where conventional compressed sensing receivers would fail. We quantitatively analyze the bit error rate (BER) and processing gain (PG) for a maximum likelihood based FPM demodulator and demonstrate its performance in interference laden conditions.\n\nContribution of food security projects on poverty alleviation to the ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nDespite South Africa's economic growth having been accelerated considerably in the country, poverty levels have not decreased as one would have experienced.

The methodology is generic while pilot studies are chosen from airport security. The outline proceeds in three major steps, (1) building a threat scenario, (2) development of simulation models as scenario refinements, and (3) assessment of alternatives. Advanced techniques of systems analysis and simulation are employed to model relevant airport structures and processes as well as offences. Computer experiments are carried out to compare and optimise alternative solutions. The optimality analyses draw on approaches to quantitative risk assessment recently developed in the operational sciences.

(Inventor); Lau, Daniel L. (Inventor); Guan, Chun (Inventor)\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA technique, associated system and program code, for retrieving depth information about at least one surface of an object, such as an anatomical feature. Core features include: projecting a composite image comprising a plurality of modulated structured light patterns, at the anatomical feature; capturing an image reflected from the surface; and recovering pattern information from the reflected image, for each of the modulated structured light patterns. Pattern information is preferably recovered for each modulated structured light pattern used to create the composite, by performing a demodulation of the reflected image. Reconstruction of the surface can be accomplished by using depth information from the recovered patterns to produce a depth map/mapping thereof. Each signal waveform used for the modulation of a respective structured light pattern, is distinct from each of the other signal waveforms used for the modulation of other structured light patterns of a composite image; these signal waveforms may be selected from suitable types in any combination of distinct signal waveforms, provided the waveforms used are uncorrelated with respect to each other.

However, it is found by Perez and Cerdeira that an intruder, without the knowledge of the parameters of the system or even of the nonlinear system itself, may extract the messages from the carrier signal by producing a return map where the dynamics is attracted to an almost 1D set. To eliminate the weakness, in this letter, a simple but efficient method for synchronizing chaotic systems by modulating the transmitted signal with an appropriately choosing scalar signal is proposed. It turns out that this modulating strategy not only preserves all appropriate information required for synchronizing chaotic systems but also destroys the possibility of the phase space reconstruction of the sender dynamics such as a return map\n\nProjective Synchronization in Modulated Time-Delayed Chaotic Systems Using an Active Control Approach\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFeng Cun-Fang; Wang Ying-Hai\n\n2011-01-01\n\nProjective synchronization in modulated time-delayed systems is studied by applying an active control method. Based on the Lyapunov asymptotical stability theorem, the controller and sufficient condition for projective synchronization are calculated analytically. We give a general method with which we can achieve projective synchronization in modulated time-delayed chaotic systems. This method allows us to adjust the desired scaling factor arbitrarily. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed by using the famous delay-differential equations related to optical bistable or hybrid optical bistable devices. Numerical simulations fully support the analytical approach.

PV mounting and support assemblies are secured to the deck according to the layout pattern using fasteners extending into the deck. The PV modules are placed on the PV mounting and support assemblies. Retaining elements are located over and secured against the upper peripheral edge surfaces of the PV modules so to secure them to the deck with the peripheral edges of the PV modules spaced apart from the deck. In some examples a PV module mounting assembly, for use on a shingled deck, comprises flashing, a base mountable on the flashing, a deck-penetrating fastener engageable with the base and securable to the deck so to secure the flashing and the base to the shingled deck, and PV module mounting hardware securable to the base.\n\nBypassing Russia: Nabucco project and its implications for the European gas security\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nErdogdu, Erkan\n\n2010-01-01\n\nRestrictions on CO 2 emissions, the nuclear phase-out announced by some member states, high emissions from coal-fired power plants, and barriers to rapid development of renewable generation are factors that make the European Union (EU) highly dependent on natural gas. With three non-EU countries (Russia, Algeria and Norway) currently supplying more than half the gas consumed within the EU and with projections pointing out that by 2030 internal sources will only be able to meet 25% of demand, the EU desperately looks for means to secure new sources of gas supply. In this context, the Nabucco pipeline is planned to deliver gas from Caspian and Middle East regions to the EU market. It runs across Turkey and then through Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary before connecting with a major gas hub in Austria. On paper, Nabucco project makes perfect sense, offering a new export route to the EU markets for Caspian gas producers (Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan) as well as Iran and, in time, Iraq. The project is backed by the EU and strongly supported by the United States. Perhaps most importantly, Nabucco would completely bypass Russia. This paper addresses issues surrounding Nabucco project and their implications for the European gas security.

Â An excellent example of this is when the summer students join us at CERN. As the summer period is short, software projects must be accomplished quickly, like a sprint. Rush, rush! But often, this sprint ends with aching muscles. Regularly, these summer students approach us to have their project or web server made visible to the Internet. Regularly, quick security reviews of those web servers diagnose severe underperformance with regards to security: the web applications are flawed or use insecure protocols; the employed software tools, databases or web frameworks are sub-optimal and not adequately chosen for that project; the operating system is non-standard and has never been brought up-to-date; and ...\n\nExploring Protein Structure and Dynamics through a Project-Oriented Biochemistry Laboratory Module\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLipchock, James M.; Ginther, Patrick S.; Douglas, Bonnie B.; Bird, Kelly E.; Loria, J.

However, a major encountered bottleneck is lack of efficient devices to manipulate the THz wave, especially to modulate the THz wave front. A wave front modulator should allow the optical or electrical control of the spatial transmission (or reflection) of an input THz wave and hence the ability to encode the information in a wave front. Here we propose a spatial THz modulator (STM) to dynamically control the THz wave front with photo-generated carriers. A computer generated THz hologram is projected onto a silicon wafer by a conventional spatial light modulator (SLM). The corresponding photo-generated carrier spatial distribution will be induced, which forms an amplitude hologram to modulate the wave front of the input THz beam. Some special intensity patterns and vortex beams are generated by using this method. This all-optical controllable STM is structure free, high resolution and broadband. It is expected to be widely used in future THz imaging and communication systems.\n\nUSCG Security Plan Review\n\nData.gov (United States)\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security â The Security Plan Review module is intended for vessel and facility operators to check on the status of their security plans submitted to the US Coast Guard.

The Pearl River Delta (PRD) in southern China has experienced rapid economic development and intensive human activities in recent years. This study, based on landscape analysis, provides a method to discover the alteration of character among different landscape types and to understand the landscape ecological security status. Based on remotely sensed products of the Landsat 5 TM images in 1990 and the Landsat 7 ETM+ images in 2005, landscape classification maps of nine cities in the PRD were compiled by implementing Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System technology. Several indices, including aggregation, crush index, landscape shape index, Shannon's diversity index, landscape fragile index, and landscape security adjacent index, were applied to analyze spatial-temporal characteristics of landscape patterns in the PRD. A landscape ecological security index based on these outcomes was calculated by projection pursuit using genetic algorithm. The landscape ecological security of nine cities in the PRD was thus evaluated. The main results of this research are listed as follows: (1) from 1990 to 2005, the aggregation index, crush index, landscape shape index, and Shannon's diversity index of nine cities changed little in the PRD, while the landscape fragile index and landscape security adjacent index changed obviously. The landscape fragile index of nine cities showed a decreasing trend; however, the landscape security adjacent index has been increasing; (2) from 1990 to 2005, landscape ecology of the cities of Zhuhai and Huizhou maintained a good security situation. However, there was a relatively low value of ecological security in the cities of Dongguan and Foshan. Except for Foshan and Guangzhou, whose landscape ecological security situation were slightly improved, the cities had reduced\n\nSecond quantization, projective modules, and local gauge invariance\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSelesnick, S A [Missouri Univ., St. Louis (USA)\n\n1983-01-01\n\nBundles and bundle structures have gained wide currency in modern approaches to certain topics in quantum physics, significant applications appearing in connection with gauge theories, theories of geometric quantization, and in numerous other contexts. It is argued that such structures can already be discerned in the most elementary notions of second quantization. An examination of the methods traditionally used by physicists in dealing quantum mechanically with systems exhibiting an infinite number of degrees of freedom reveals the implicit use of module structures over algebras of functions. By making these structures explicit and adapting some results of perturbation theory an association between bare particles and finitely generated projective modules is arrived at. In particular, rank one modules emerge naturally, for algebraic reasons, as the appropriate descriptors of bosons in this association. As a first application of the formalism the existence of phononlike excitations in general many-fermion systems is shown. When these ideas are further specialized (local) gauge theoretical notions arise in a natural way out of a consideration of the bundles.\n\nAddressing the security of a future sustainable power system: The Danish SOSPO project\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nYang, Guangya; JÃ³hannsson, HjÃ¶rtur; Lind, Morten\n\n2012-01-01\n\nevaluated to secure the operation from both transmission and distribution levels.

This document shows HTVL measurements are fundamen- tally insufficient as a metric to determine camera resolution, and propose a quantitative, standards based methodology by measuring the camera system modulation transfer function (MTF), the most common and accepted metric of res- olution in the optical science community. Because HTVL calculations are easily misinterpreted or poorly defined, we present several scenarios in which HTVL is frequently reported, and discuss their problems. The MTF metric is discussed, and scenarios are presented with calculations showing the application of such a metric.\n\nFlat-plate solar array project.

IBWTPs have impacts on the complex ecosystems of the areas from which water is diverted and to which water is received. These impacts increase damage or risk to regional ecological security and human wellbeing. However, current methods make it difficult to achieve comprehensive analysis of the impacts of whole ecosystems, because of the long distance between ecosystems and the inconsistency of impact events. In this study, a model was proposed for the analysis of the impacts of IBWTPs on regional ecological security. It is based on the telecoupling framework, and the DriverâPressureâStateâ ImpactâResponse (DPSIR model was used to improve the analysis procedure within the telecoupling framework. The Middle Line of the SouthâtoâNorth Water Diversion Project was selected as a case study to illustrate the specific analysis procedure. We realized that information sharing is a key issue in the management of regional security, and that the ecological water requirement, in the form of a single index, could be used to quantitatively assess the impacts on ecological security from IBWTPs.\n\nUnderground Test Area Quality Assurance Project Plan Nevada National Security Site, Nevada, Revision 0\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nIrene Farnham\n\n2011-05-01\n\nThis Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) provides the overall quality assurance (QA) program requirements and general quality practices to be applied to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO) Underground Test Area (UGTA) Sub-Project (hereafter the Sub-Project) activities.
