        "text": "Hi Monday team!\n\nI have this problem where a Single Reply to an email goes into EVERY pulse Update where the same email address is in the email column.\n\nHere is the user case.\n\nWe have a board designed to invite Instructors to Teach Courses. Each pulse is an UNIQUE Course. Here is a quick example of how each pulse looks like with course details.\n\nWhen we push the Send Invite Status, it sends this email to the Email in the Email Column.\n\nThe idea was simple, we were hoping for the instructor to REPLY to this email and the response GO Directly into that PULSE alone, but the issue is that the Instructor REPLY to that email GOES ALSO into Every OTHER pulse where their EMAIL address is listed in the email column.\n\nI’m seeking help from the community folks to figure out the right recipe that will contain replying to that EMAIL and that RESPONSE going to the respective PULSE and NOT into EVERY other pulse where the email address is listed.\n\nI suspect that this is the correct area to do that in, but I don’t know how to set it up.\n\nAlejencia, I have the same issue. The only way I could figure out how to stop the updates to every pulse line with same email is very cumbersome and time consuming to do. I also would like to merge pulse lines together because when there are updates in the wrong pulse there is no way to merge it to the correct one other than linking it, but then you can’t delete it on the pulse that is incorrect.\n\nNot sure if that makes sense. But, all in all, I agree there needs to be a better way to get replies directly placed in only the intended pulse lines.\n\nHi @alejencia - In passing this feedback to our product team, a workaround was discussed.\n\nIn the email column, you do have the ability to add the configuration +“value” to an email address. For example, mtr48+1@emaildomain.com.\n\nThis will alter the behavior of the Gmail integration. The email sent from monday.com will go to the mtr48 email, but the email pulled into monday.com will go to the correct corresponding line item. When this configuration is added to an email, the integration will see it as two different emails.\n\n@Lisa-monday.com, In my company we will start using email integration but we found a great obstacle to make a CRM that works correctly.-\n\nIf my board contains opportunities that correspond to the same customer with the same email, I cannot ask the sales management employees to manually assign a sequence +1, +2, +3 to the same email box.\n\nThere must be an automated solution or a solution to this problem that allows that if from Monday.com I send an email to my client for an opportunity, when the update responds, it is assigned to that opportunity and not to the others that obviously will not have nothing to do with the first.\n\nIt really is a huge obstacle to thinking like CRM."
