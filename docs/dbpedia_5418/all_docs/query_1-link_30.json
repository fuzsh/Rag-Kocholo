        "text": "I Totally Agree. The Black Star is Better as Black/Human Souls are More Powerful than Normal \"White Souls\" Such as Animals etc..\n\nIn Oblivion the Black Soul Gems are the Equivenent of the Black Azura's Star and therefore Hold Human Souls. One must have \"Grand Soul Gems\" and the \"Soul Trap\" Spell be it by Touch or Target and place them in the Altars (There's a few scattered around Cyrodil) on the right Day (there is a light from the Heavens coming Down on the Altars which gives you the ability to transform the Soul Gems to Black Soul Gems and one doesn't require the Gems to be Filled with Souls to Transform them..\n\nJust place the empty Grand Soul Gems into the Altars when the Purple light is shining down on the Altars (Fort Istirris (Hopefully the Spelling is Correct) is 1 of the places where 1 can find such an Altar) and use the \"Soul Trap\" Spell on the altar as many times as is needed to Transform all or some of the Soul Gems you have placed inside..\n\nafter that just open up the Altar again and add back to your inventory..\n\nApart from that,\n\nI Chose the Normal Azura's Star the 1st time around (Saved the Game 1st before starting the Quest so I could suss the Both out before making a Decision) and ended up after doing the Black Azura's Star side Alternative quest keeping the Black Star because of its ability to hold Human Souls..\n\nIn the End, the Choice is yours............. It's a matter of Taste or the Need of which will be the Outcome on what you so choose.\n\nBlack is Better in Any case as it recharges things a Hell of a lot better :) ;)\n\nDeath to the Aldmeri Dominion!!!!!"
