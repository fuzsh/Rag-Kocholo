(Joking aside, I've finally returned to painting too, after a long sweaty summer of doing other things )\n\nExcited to see what you're up to dude.\n\n- Salvage\n\nKOW BATREPS: BLOODFIRE\n\nINSTAGRAM: @boss_salvage\n\nSubject: Re:WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\nFixture of Dakka\n\nYea, somehow despite not having a lot in particular to do outside of August, I didn't get a lot done. However, started playing a little Kings of War and also decided that it was better to make things than play Heroes of the Storm all else equal, and I got a bit done.\n\nGoatly there is mostly done, just some touch up, some highlighting on the loin cloth, the gem on his... whatever that crotch armor is, and a base. Which will probably take me a month Still, gotta get my Circle up to snuff for full colored Hordes against RiTides fully (commission) painted Gator Men!\n\nFor scale, gaks and giggles there are two Wrath of Kings models, Sheal Han big sister and dragon legion officer. The big sister needs some more everything, but the general scheme is there. The officer is just base colors at this point, and not even all of them. Nice models though; if I had a regular opponent I would be slamming more paint on them for sure.\n\nThe last is one of the Alkemy models I am using to put together a little warrior monk for for Ronin. Again, no opponents so no real rush, but the models are tiny and fairly detailed and nice, so it is a good deal for me. I don't paint much far east stuff.\n\nThanks for tuning in! I have been hard at worked down in the birthing chambers, creating a new army or two for Kings of War. The Celt lads are being upgraded to fit that system (counts-as Orcs) as well as a forth coming Nature/Herd army with centaurs a-plenty, as soon as I sculpt up some human torsos for them. Wheeeeeee. Big question is whether I will get that project done before baby number two hits; seven months to go.\n\nOh, by the way, my wife and I are building another sprog, using period materials and methods. Slow, nauseating work, but mostly for her.\n\nAlso, holy balls, Salvage paints?! Things other than his own body?!\n\nWoad to WAR... on Celts blog, which is mostly Circle Orboros\n\n\"I'm sick of auto-penetrating attacks against my behind!\" - Kungfuhustler\n\nSubject: Re:WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\nFixture of Dakka\n\nHoly balls, I painted some things. Well... finished some things, and did some color tests and work on other things.\n\nBig problem lately is not having the time or energy to game much, so there hasn't been any clear and present motivation for getting anything done in particular. However, with RiTides threatening to have a fully painted army done and ready for Hordes action, and some fun with KoW happening, I have been building and getting stuff prepared.\n\nSo, things!\n\nFun with color balance! There's the Sorchimera and two Hordes heavies, Shadowhorn Satyr and home made Ghettorix. All are done and based, although I keep thinking I ol' Ghetty needs something else, maybe some runes on his ax, or blue war paint. I have decided to not do blue on the Sorc just yet, as I am not sure I want to and can't decide on a pattern, a combo that suggests I am best putting it off. Still really happy with how she came out... I need to get another for various other conversions... how awesome would that top look with like a ball gown of tentacles coming out the bottom?\n\nAnyway, the Hordes heavies are the only two I need for my Cassius list. Where is Cassius? Well... partly done as seen here with some other odds and ends!\n\nCoincidentally, how to take good pictures is apparently something I have forgotten. But there they are, Cass, Wurmwood, a Formor fiend leader, a random Red Box Game mini I picked up a few years back, a random bones barbarian and a Rackham Llanyff who is a color test for a small unit of them I am going to put together for Kings of War. Pretty happy with how the lot are coming out, with the barbarians pretty much done, the Formor needing woad, and Cass needing some touch up and detailing. I am a little bummed with him, as there is an awkward miscast going down the right side of his face and lapel (which you can't see in the pics) but it looks like there is serious scarring there. Didn't notice it till I started painting, so oh well. The meat puppet can deal I guess.\n\nWoad to WAR... on Celts blog, which is mostly Circle Orboros\n\n\"I'm sick of auto-penetrating attacks against my behind!\" - Kungfuhustler\n\nSubject: WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\n[DCM]\n\nDankhold Troggoth\n\nThat Rackhame \"Llanyff\" on the left of the last pic - so sweet! Along with the RBG mini, you really bring out the best in that range - I think the details are too small for many other people to really capture.\n\nI also Really like Ghetorix, and how you've used different skin tones on your various circle beasts (almost yellow on the goat, almost black on Ghetorix). There's only one thing I don't like, but I really think you should consider tweaking it - the horns! It's most noticeable on the ones on the side of the head (the others are so much smaller and I think are fine if you wanted to keep them) but the yellow is just too jarring for me there. Could at least the side horns on the head get more of a bone color, even if the others stayed yellow?\n\nThat's my only constructive criticism, as I absolutely love the rest but really hope you might consider updating that one.\n\nAlso, that's a really well done paint job on the orb!\n\nThis message was edited 1 time.

I was going to tell RiTides that the yellow on the head dress for Ghetty was just the light and color balance, but looking at it again under different lights in the house, it really is a bit yellower than it should be. I used some old spray sealer before putting on the Testors to add some strength to it, and I am thinking it might have stained the color a bit. So that will be touched up.\n\nNext on the docket is Prof Pendrake and the Nyss Hunters to help fill out the Cassius list to full painted status. This is the list:\n\nPoints: 50/50\n\nCassius the Oathkeeper (*6pts)\n\n* Ghetorix (11pts)\n\n* Shadowhorn Satyr (7pts)\n\nCylena Raefyll & Nyss Hunters (Cylena and 9 Grunts) (10pts)\n\nFarrow Bone Grinders (Leader and 5 Grunts) (3pts)\n\nShifting Stones (2pts)\n\n* Stone keeper (1pts)\n\nShifting Stones (2pts)\n\nSwamp Gobber Bellows Crew (Leader and 1 Grunt) (1pts)\n\nTharn Bloodtrackers (Leader and 9 Grunts) (8pts)\n\n* Nuala the Huntress (2pts)\n\nTharn Bloodweavers (Leader and 5 Grunts) (5pts)\n\nGallows Grove (1pts)\n\nGallows Grove (1pts)\n\nProfessor Victor Pendrake (2pts)\n\nSo far Cassius/Wurmwood are about 85-90% done, the Shadowhorn and Ghetty are pretty much done and... the Swamp Gobbers? That's it. So its a long bit of work from here, but what the hell. Gotta paint it all sooner or later.\n\nWoad to WAR... on Celts blog, which is mostly Circle Orboros\n\n\"I'm sick of auto-penetrating attacks against my behind!\" - Kungfuhustler\n\nSubject: WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\n[DCM]\n\nDankhold Troggoth\n\nSo, if we're both fielding Viktor Pendrake against each other, is there some sort of temporal anomaly and only one of them can really exist in-game\n\nThere's a lot of grunts in that list! Heck, even some farrow bone grinders made an appearance. What do they do for it, btw?\n\nAwesome about tweaking the horns . I Really love the black skin tone on that model, how did you do it?\n\nSubject: WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\nFixture of Dakka\n\nYours will have to be referred to as \"Pictor Vendrake\"; if you forget he forfeits his activation.\n\nAlternately you can refer to him as Prof X, but with a -3 spd penalty.\n\nAnd yea... lots and lots of bodies. So... many.... bodies. Mostly to feed souls to Wurmwood but also to swamp out objectives and zones. That is a lot of Def 14 and 15 models.\n\nThe Bone Grinders are handy, 1/2 point models to feed to the tree first turn (charge their own unit in the back) and then the leader can give Cass + 2\" on Hellmouth for the rest of the game. Or flee and mourn the souls of his friends. Whichever. If the opponent brings lots of infantry with souls too, the Grinders can also act as a pretty decent lazor beam to tag high Def models with Confluence adding +1 to his Magic score for each other Grinder within 1\".\n\nGlad you like Ghetty; we'll see how you feel about him later He isn't as bonkers in this list, but man, in a Baldur2 list with Stoneskin and the wall, sitting at Def 16 Arm 22 vs melee... he's pretty disgusting.\n\nHis skin is mostly VJ German Grey + Paynes Grey highlighted to Sky Grey with just a touch of Dark Sand mixed in, then washed with Paynes Grey. The Paynes Grey gives him just a touch of blue to avoid being dull and grey, and the Dark Sand adds a hint of warmth in spots. He was sort of experimental so I didn't take photos unfortunately.\n\nWoad to WAR... on Celts blog, which is mostly Circle Orboros\n\n\"I'm sick of auto-penetrating attacks against my behind!\" - Kungfuhustler\n\nSubject: WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\n[DCM]\n\nDankhold Troggoth\n\nVery nice on Ghetorix! (Although sounds well beyond my abilities). I'll at least Try to avoid him in combat, as that's why Pendrake is in my list - buff a unit of Croaks to hit a warbeast and hopefully make it rain from distance!\n\nLove the gameplan for the bone grinders too lol\n\nSubject: WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\nFixture of Dakka\n\nYea, the beasts hang WELL back in this list. It is sort of a strange list for me, but pretty fun. The infantry all is pretty killy and can really hold stuff back, and the beasts really just hang out to deal with some armor here and there. Ghetto can wreck a colossal himself on a good day, especially with Curse of Shadows from Cass. The Shadowhorn is there mostly to get behind things and arm lock them into oblivion. Little goat can hop behind the scariest jack and stop them completely, because you can't move when arm locked, and can't break it until your action, so even if you break it you pretty much give up your turn. Then he locks you again. Plus with his animus he can chuck models quite far and accurately, which is a pretty good trick for dropping casters and shutting up a beast or jack for a turn by tossing them out of control.\n\nIt is a super tricky, sideways list, so is a lot of fun to play. Between Hellmouthing your own teleported stones, killing your own bacon flavored souls, Strangleholding beasts/jacks, throwing them, and just making a giant board spanning forest to shut down movement, there's a lot of interesting decisions.\n\nWoad to WAR... on Celts blog, which is mostly Circle Orboros\n\n\"I'm sick of auto-penetrating attacks against my behind!\" - Kungfuhustler\n\nSubject: WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\nFixture of Dakka\n\nBattle report update! (Pictures will come a little later this week.)\n\nI actually played a game! I drove up into the Maryest of Lands to play some Warmahordes against one of their local Press Gangers. Expecting until the night before to play RiTides and his lovely commissioned army I had slammed through a unit of Blood Trackers, Blood Weavers, two units of Shifting Stones + UA, Cassius and Wurmwood, Victor Pendrake and half painted some pig shaped soul tokens. Why I expected to play RiTides after only a month of planning is beyond me... hope springs eternal, the first step on the road to disappointment.\n\nThe second step is trusting a boosted Pow 12 to do 2+ points of damage to Arm 14, apparently...\n\nSo PG Charlie and I had set up a game. I took the Cassius list I have been planning for a bit:\n\nCassius + Wurmwood\n\n*Ghetto\n\n*Judo Goat\n\nNyss Hunters Max\n\nBlood Trackers Max + Nuala\n\nBlood Weavers\n\nBone Grinders Max\n\nShifting Stones x2 + US\n\nSwamp Gobbers\n\nGallows Groves x 2\n\nPendrake\n\nFun list vs infantry heavy forces, and decent against Warmachine lists that don't run like 6 jacks.\n\nCharlie brought Amon with 4 heavies, 2 lights and some heavy infantry, sisters and choir. Great.\n\nScenario is one with a rectangular central zone and two objectives. Which objectives are not really important, as it never came up other than Ghettorix setting himself on fire.\n\nTurn 1: Circle goes first, with Trackers running forward to fill the zone, hunters behind them, weavers woven in between. Bone Grinders assume their low energy state of soul tokens, and everything else surges forward. Wurmwood is teleported up to toe the zone and Cass walks forward on top of a hill behind the piles of infantry and feats, shutting off the middle third of the board.\n\nAmon grumbes about how awesome Cassius is, and runs everything forward as far as it can get into the woods. Importantly, the Exemplar Bastions get into the zone, engaging one Blood Tracker and sitting about 3\" forward of the rest. Behind that line was the Bastion solo, and right behind him was Amon sitting on zero focus.\n\nTurn 2: Well, I have a gallows grove that can see that Basion solo if I can just kill one of the bastions in front of him. And if I can see him, I can slam Hellmouth's into his delicious Def 11 and catch Amon sitting at 14 armor. The Blood Trackers get to work on their Preyed Bastions, slamming javelins into them remorselessly, dropping all but 2. They then reform to block up the zone and access to Wurmwood if things go pear shaped. Cassius activates, pulls 5 soul tokens off Wurmwood and warms up the hellmouth...er. I figure I will shoot one off unboosted, and if it doesn't hit I will go with plan B of hellmouthing a stone on the other side of the force that is surrounded by Sisters of the Flame and then unseen path Wurmwood back to be super safe. But the Hellmouth hits with aplomb, killing more bastions (but critically not the solo) and with boosted damage takes all but 2 damage off of Amon. Sweet baby cats! Sitting on 6 Fury, it is time to close this out! Hellmouth again, boost to hit, POW! Right in the solo's face! Solo dies, whatever, and it is time to boost vs Amon! Dice -2, 3 dice, what could go wrong?\n\nOh... right.\n\nSo now we are in \"what the hell do I do?\" territory. Cass walks back to be away from anything. Aha! Nyss Hunters! They can shoot things! So they stand on the hill and plink at Amon, but Def 15 and no CRA means nothing happens. Well, time to bunch up and hope nothing can get to Wurmwood.\n\nLong story short, next turn Amon feats, kills all the girls and nyss in front of Wurmwood, some other jacks punch some other things, and the last heavy tramples in with 2 focus and Pow 24's down Wurmwood twice, doing 21 damage.\n\nSo yea, missed killing by 1, got killed by 2. One thing I did screw up, I probably could have used jump on Judo Goat to get him in front of some girls and stopped the trample. Killing the goat might not have been too tough though, and it would have left some empty space to the side of Wurmwood (where the goat was standing) to land the trample in.\n\nEither way, a fun game, even if it was definitely not a list I would have chosen to drop Cassius into!\n\nWe got a second game in, a team game with each player having 35 points. Testicles of Menoth + Kharchev vs eKreuger and Vlad1. Too much to write up (or remember) but 3rd turn Krugs pulls an assassination gambit vs the Testicles who was leading from the front, via Goatly two handed throwing the Avatar into the caster, then shooting all the lightening at the Testicles. Of course, the boosted shot #3 does.... no damage, leaving the caster at 3 health. In this case, however, my partner had Behemoth waiting for orders, and one bombard shot to the balls later and the enemy were down one warcaster and one jack. Of course the Avatar and all the infantry still were there, which was a problem. The game went on for a while and we didn't quite finish by turn 3, but it looked bad and would have come down to an assassination attempt by our opponents on eKrugs and Vlad. If they would have managed to kill both, they win, otherwise Ghetto and my Stalker (who had failed to kill the Avatar the previous turn, somehow) would have finished the Avatar and eKrugs could have dominated a flag for the last two points we needed to win.\n\nStuff, things, it was a really fun game. Who cares how it would have turned out.\n\nWoad to WAR... on Celts blog, which is mostly Circle Orboros\n\n\"I'm sick of auto-penetrating attacks against my behind!\" - Kungfuhustler\n\nSubject: WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\n[DCM]\n\nDankhold Troggoth\n\nWehrkind wrote:\n\nWhy I expected to play RiTides after only a month of planning is beyond me... hope springs eternal, the first step on the road to disappointment.\n\nYeah how could you ever expect that after our working things out so last minute\n\nHope you're available for a raincheck next week, really want to break in the frogs and gators against your Circle!

You seriously rolled 1,1,1 when you needed 2,1,1 (or any of the 215 combinations available)? I would have hurled those dice through the wall, out of principle more than anger.\n\nBut all the same, yea for WehrRep! Also that spark to get lingering painting done! Would like to see the painted things too. Also a pictorial battle report between you and 'Tides. Make it happen, gentlemen.\n\nIn related news, have been thinking about my Skorne again (having moved apartments and packed/unpacked them all very recently), and how much I like the background, the characters (Makeda 4E), the derpy sculpts (some of them anyway) ... Kind of want to bust out my 35 pt Makeda2 list - especially now that my painted Animantarax is good?! - or my Mordikaar Tier 2 list that I painted Despoiler for and then retired before playing him\n\nHowever I also want to use my limited gaming time for Malifaux, sooooooo maybe I'll just save WM/H for games on the road ...\n\n- Salvage\n\nThis message was edited 2 times.

Literally any die could have not been a 1, and hey, no worries. But nope... Orboros was apparently out back for a smoke, and couldn't see fit to wurm it up a little for me.\n\nNote that in the following game I also was 3 short on a boosted roll of dice - 6. Not quite as bad, but I only needed like a 9. The second damage roll was poor as well. They say boosted Pow 12s kill casters, but thus far that is all in the realm of theory to me.\n\nI also can't believe Ghetto and a Stalker failed to one round the Avatar. Jin must have been fondling my dice while I wasn't looking, because that is Kim levels of dice failure there.\n\nAwesome to see your blog back! Equally awesome to see you thinking Skorne! They are in a really neat place it seems to me now, with Incendiarii (and Croaks...) being really cool, the new bug critters being impressive, rerolls all over (I would trade lots for a reroll on a stick solo in Circle) and wierdo stuff like the Keltarii. Well, and the hydra looks awesome. You should totally rock that out! So I don't have to! I nearly bought 3Mak, Zaal and a dozen assorted Cyclops to run a few months back. It was just such a silly awesome list. It was mostly just the inability to choose a caster and imagining the baleful gaze from my own Archdomina that kept me from it.\n\nI feel a little better though knowing that eKromac(!) is on his way to my house, with a Tier list that lets me run all 11 Argus I own and actually feel pretty good about it.\n\nSpeaking of road, being on it, and getting games thereby... when are you making it down to the slightly less frozen, more swampy south lands?\n\nAutomatically Appended Next Post:\n\nWheeeee! eKromac just arrived! He is currently soaking in the Simple Green vibro hot tub, so here's the lists I am looking at. The pairing I want to run for the next few months (years?) will be Cassius' list from above for anti-infantry and eKromac for anti just about everything.\n\neKromac- 50 points Tier 4\n\nKromac - (4)\n\n*6xArgus - 18 points\n\n*Winter Argus - 4\n\n*Moonhound - 3\n\n*Rotterhorn Griffon - 3\n\n*Scarsfell Griffon - 4\n\n*Ghettorix - 11\n\nShifting Stones - 2\n\nSentry Stone - 3\n\n3x Blood Weaver Night Witch - 6\n\nSo, not ALL the argus I own, but close. The mix is a little off because I really want one more moonhound and don't care about the Scarsfell, but I don't want to be a point short either. I might pull the Scarsfell and swap in an Argus and the UA for the stones to get some more range on Serenity. Why? Because running first turn is going to put 11 Fury on the board.\n\nI am also not sure how I feel about the Sentry Stone. Need it for Tier 4, but that just gives me a forest to plop somewhere. Granted, little Manikin sprays are pretty nice with +2 to hit from the Moonhound, and auto-hit charges on the feat turn is also nice if I can pull it off. I don't know that I will care much about the forest generation side though, but maybe the Rotter can accelerate a manikin, who will then charge something before exploding into trees to block LOS. We shall see.\n\nI am just super excited to get eKromac on the table! Kromac was the first caster that clicked for me, and I have been waiting for him to get Rathrok and become a real beat stick of a caster, and it is even cooler than I could have imagined!\n\nAutomatically Appended Next Post:\n\nDerp, forgot the Gorax in that list! I knew there was no reason to take a Scarsfell ever...\n\neKromac- 50 points Tier 4\n\nKromac - (4)\n\n*6xArgus - 18 points\n\n*Winter Argus - 4\n\n*Moonhound - 3\n\n*Rotterhorn Griffon - 3\n\n*Gorax - 3\n\n*Ghettorix - 11\n\nShifting Stones + UA - 3\n\nSentry Stone - 3\n\n3x Blood Weaver Night Witch - 6\n\nSentry Stone might get dropped for a second Gorax, but we'll see.\n\nJust got done putting Big Mac together, and it is a very nice little kit! Resin is nice, much better than the crap PVC they use, although it has some tiny bubbles in spots. The only problem spots are the head dress. Everything slots together really well, except the top of the head and the body have a strange gap like they didn't shape the body properly to accept the top of the head, and then the lower jaw doesn't quite line up. The little head dress mandibles then are a bit of a pain to get in there, but not too bad, having read a review before that suggested doing them last. Over all though, three spots that need a tiny bit of GS fill on a model that size and complexity is not bad at all! Well done PP.\n\nPics tomorrow.\n\nThis message was edited 3 times.

That is one awesome model, which also happens to have awesome rules, is covered in spray templates, and is a hydra. Hard to turn down those arguments! With WM/H in general, I'm more curious about getting some play in with minis I've already painted for a game I mostly understand - unlike Malifaux and, thanks to N3, Infinity\n\nSpeaking of spamming things: OMF ARGUS SPAM!! I occasionally check in to see if people are running argus spam lists, and have seen a few here and there. Big fan of the doge swarm now that there are three (maybe more now?) varieties to choose from. Will have to see how eKroms juices them up. Anyway, do want to see this happen! Dare I say, 2016/7 = Couple Hydras vs Many Arguses??\n\n(I'm sure I'll be down in the summer as usual, though always so rushed I only see half the people I want to )\n\n- Salvage\n\nThis message was edited 1 time.

I expected more like elephant/stag beetles, less... whatever those look like. I think counts as models are definitely in order there!\n\nSorry about no pics over the weekend. Saturday I just passed out, and Sunday I spent 4+ hours airbrushing, and my feet and back were just done. Buying the Storm Bringer a big set of wooden doll house furniture you build yourself seemed like a good idea. ~7 hours of work later I am reexamining that decision.\n\nBut...\n\nSpeaking of Argus spam!\n\nKromac's Dog Walking Service! Only 7 regular Argus, 1 Winter and 1 Moonhound, but not bad The models are comparatively simple too, so I will probably have them done painting for Wednesday.\n\nHere's a pic of the big man himself! Because he is awesome.\n\nIn terms of other things I painted last week, first we have Cassius and Wurmwood:\n\nCassius, annoyed with the glare from the workshop lights (sorry about that, no real room to set up other than my workbench with a scrap of leather over my anvil) wonders \"Where has my blood gone to?\".\n\nSo he calls the Blood Trackers\n\nWhen you don't know where your blood is and need it found in a hurry, Blood Trackers are your number one solution, for all your Blood Tracking needs.\n\nOnce found, consider using Blood Weavers service:\n\nWith just a bit of fresh, warm blood, Blood Weavers can produce the most luxurious of scab based apparel! Wow your next office party with a festive Sanguine Knit sweater or cardigan!\n\nRounding things out, Shifting Stones. You know, those Stones you cross the street in order to avoid passing too near. Not because you think they are bad per se, but just better safe than sorry.\n\nAlso, a back shot on the unofficial stones, because I did free hand, damnit\n\nPendrake was there somewhere too, but I am a little disappointed with him. I think the model looked better in my head than it did painted on the table.\n\nThat was the recent stuff. This is less so:\n\nGhettorix and my second stalker there. I whitened the color on Ghetto's head dress there, which you can't see at all, sorry. The Hashishin stalker there is a little old, but I don't know that I ever really posted it here. Like Ghetto, he is made from a Feral kit, with a little mask and a custom sword made out of card and GS. I really hate the official stalker model, and figured I couldn't do worse. I am quite happy with how Second Stalker here turned out though, with sort of a limber, ready to act look to him the official one lacks.\n\nHere's another shot of his sword, which I am quite pleased with.\n\nAnd that's all I've got! Go paint your own models! I have eKromac and a swarm of Argus on my desk for now\n\nWoad to WAR... on Celts blog, which is mostly Circle Orboros\n\n\"I'm sick of auto-penetrating attacks against my behind!\" - Kungfuhustler\n\nSubject: WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\nFixture of Dakka\n\nYour Circle minis are looking really nice, I like all the tattoos you've done on the girls.\n\nI'd like to do some Hordes minis at some point, need to pick up some more for my Warmachine factions first though.\n\nSubject: WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\nOmnipotent Lord of Change\n\nAlbany, NY\n\n*PIC[T] 'SPLOSION*\n\nCheers for all that! Many things of yours I haven't seen. Also eKroms is a big boy! Just had to go read about him. Puppy pack makes more sense now, beyond just a spammy shtick.\n\nForgot to mention, the next WM/H stuff I paint might be a Skorne warband ... for Frostgrave Go fig - after CSM, Skorne are one of the few TTG armies that I read / care about the background for Enslave all the chilly wizard dudes and steal their treasures!\n\n- Salvage\n\nSubject: WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\nFixture of Dakka\n\n@Giraffe: Thanks man The Hordes models are nice, even if the faces on the Nyss and Skorne are super, super ugly. Well, ok, I don't care much for PP models in general, but Circle has some cool stuff\n\nSALVAGE\n\nYea, the argus is a pretty good beast at 3 points, and with auto hitting charges at +2 str is pretty hard hitting on feat turn (Pow 18 Combo Bite, 20 with Primal). Plus Def 15 Arm 14/16 isn't bad for clinging to a zone or flag. I suspect that Argus Spam is going to be more of a fun/silly list than anything serious, but I expect a lot of fun\n\nSecretly though, I am just jealous I don't have Dr Arkadius' new Tier to play with. That looks AMAZING.\n\nTotally do a warband for Frostgrave! I have a bunch of Rackham stuff that didn't fit into my old WHFB army based and primed to use in Frostgrave, so excited for that! Come to think of it, I have a bunch of new stuff for that army (for Kings of War) airbushed that I never posted pics of. Maybe later.\n\nBut yes. Skorne band would be great!! Lots of nice models to fit the theme too, from little guys with daggers (thieves) to big armored dudes (knights). Should be awesome! I need to build more terrain for Frostgrave, probably mirroring Wyrmalla's cork board terrain that is so nice.\n\nekrom is such a nice model too, really stepping up their game. That left hand (just the hand) is separate, but sculpted all around save for the wrist. It is then almost entirely covered up, but it would make a great bit for something else. Just a great model all around, not too busy but nicely detailed.\n\nWoad to WAR... on Celts blog, which is mostly Circle Orboros\n\n\"I'm sick of auto-penetrating attacks against my behind!\" - Kungfuhustler\n\nSubject: WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\nBattlefield Tourist\n\nGreat job on the Stalker conversion - I actually didn't spot that it was a conversion at all til you said, which I think is a great sign of success.\n\nDid you say you have an ANVIL in your workshop?!\n\nSubject: WoC army: Woad on Celts!\n\n[DCM]\n\nDankhold Troggoth\n\nThat painted infantry looks great, you have been on such a spree!\n\nOnly one small suggestion would be to have the red hair pop a little more on the blood trackers - just one last highlight would really look cool on them\n\nLast I had heard there were still no arms on those models (which I had assumed meant no paint!) how were you able to finish them all so quickly? Very excited to play against them this week!\n\nSubject: Circle Orboros: Fifty Shades of Brown\n\nFixture of Dakka\n\n@RiTides: Thank you sir I was motivated by your (well Ramos Azura's) painting up all those croaks and gators. You are right that they were in bits, but mostly as you had seen them last: based, primed with a little base coat here and there, but with parts broken off through use. Starting from bare metal might not have been too bad as I would have been able to airbrush the skin tones, but those girls were glued some 5 years ago.\n\nThe best way to get lots of things done fast: planning and assembly lining It helps that I have been painting that general scheme for 7 years or so now, but yea, I knew which colors I wanted to use before what washes etc, and just powered through many iterations of it. That's one reason why Nuala didn't get done with them: too many differences from the main models to be efficient. Plus I think I boned the primer on her and got it too thick. I am probably going to strip her and start from scratch.\n\nYou are right too, the hair does need a last touch highlight to bring it up a bit. Some pop more than others, partially an artifact of them originally having different color hair like the Blood Weavers. I decided that different color hair was too slow to do, and also since it was the only bright color on the models having each be different would break up the cohesion of the unit a lot. Now they are strangely samey in terms of hair color, but somewhat uniform.\n\nSpeaking of colors, the army is no longer called \"The Circle Jerks\" but rather now \"The Fifty Shades of Brown.\"\n\n@ Da Boss: Thank you sir! I am really proud of that Stalker, if only because the base model irks me so\n\nI do have an anvil, but just a little 50lb one. Well, also a little 1 lb one, but you know what I mean. I used to do a lot of leather work and armor work when I was active in the SCA, so I have lots of stuff like that around. Handy when you need them, though a pain to have moved around so much the last 6 years\n\nAutomatically Appended Next Post:\n\nIn fact, it is time to change the thread title.
