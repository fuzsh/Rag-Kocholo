This tournament had a total prizepool of $5341.39 USD, the most of any Modern Tetris event. More information can be found here: linktr.ee/wplsocal\n\nThroughout the LAN, 3 main brackets and one side bracket took place. The main games were Puyo Puyo Tetris 2, TETR.IO and Tetris Effect: Connected, while the side bracket featured PPT2 Swap.\n\nAlthough three brackets finished in time, the same could not be said for Tetris Effect Connected. BeastinShen improvised by running the final few matches online, in a separate stream a week later, once everyone had gotten back home.\n\nThis tournament marks the beginning of the paradigm shift towards offline events, inspiring many organizers to run LANs of their own. Maybe you could be the next!\n\nReported by AddTagHere, edited by bennxt\n\nTeam ඞ Wins Ads20000's Birthday Battle\n\nEdge, Kec, and rheeneetus won Ads20000's Birthday Battle last week as Team ඞ. While Edge was originally the leader of the Edgers, he ultimately swapped teams with Haavard due to a secret rule. As Haavard did not show up in time to play in the True Finals, the Edgers were disqualified, giving ඞ the victory.\n\nPut together by Azura, Choco, and Kamoto, ABB was a surprise invitational 3-player team tournament that took place on June 17th UTC to celebrate Ads20000's birthday. Azura's graphics were inspired by one of Ads' favourite games: Pokemon Legends: Arceus.\n\nIt has been nearly a year since TAWS started, so ABB was not only a celebration for the TAWS owner, but also the large staff team that keeps TAWS running. Still, there may be another TAWS milestone celebration coming up soon, so keep an eye out...!\n\nReported by Ads20000, edited by bennxt\n\n┈┈┈┈Records and Accomplishments:┈┈┈┈\n\nhiryu achieves perhaps his most consistent sprint ever, beating Reset_ and taking the 40L sprint WR! This 14.703 second run features a nearly flat speed graph, 2.59 average KPP and 6.87 average PPS for 101 pieces. Absolutely insane, amazing job and congratulations!\n\nhttps://jstris.jezevec10.com/replay/55347607\n\nReported by Syperion\n\nTetrian22 continues to solidify his position as the pentomino master with yet another WR improvement! This time it's the pento 1000L WR, which at 18:58.220 is nearly 10 minutes ahead of second place! It's definitely also worth noting that only 12 people have managed to complete this gamemode in Jstris, which just goes to show just how insane this WR is.\n\nhttps://jstris.jezevec10.com/replay/55561462\n\nHe also subs 1:30 in pento 100L, increasing the gap between him and 2nd place to nearly 30 seconds!\n\nhttps://jstris.jezevec10.com/replay/55617173\n\nReported by QuickAndSmart\n\nGigaWhatGaming achieves the overall PPT Western 40L Sprint record, surpassing Jayden and the previous WR by 0.01 to become the 3rd western player to sub 32!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GigaWhatGaming/status/1538287124281274368\n\nReported by OSW\n\n┈┈┈┈Tourney News:┈┈┈┈\n\nWPLC SoCal results, in order of bracket completion :\n\nPuyo Puyo Tetris 2 :\n\n1st place: Wumbo\n\n2nd place: Blaarg\n\n3rd place: ADDTAGHERE\n\nPuyo Puyo Tetris 2 Swap :\n\n1st place: Wumbo\n\n2nd place: ADDTAGHERE\n\n3rd place: Dom\n\nTETR.IO :\n\n1st place: Firestorm\n\n2nd place: Blaarg\n\n3rd place: Caboozled\n\nTetris Effect: Connected :\n\n1st place: Blaarg\n\n2nd place: Caboozled\n\n3rd place: Firestorm\n\nReported by AddTagHere and Moose\n\nIFT:T results!!\n\n1st place: UC GANG (Caboozled, Cowbow, Twinkoder)\n\n2nd place: BREAKFAST (Tatoes, Eight, Timelessnesses)\n\n3rd place: GINKOID (Thewaxmango, KFB, Artshade)\n\nAnother successful take on a teams format <3\n\nReported by Renge\n\nPCOpen 2 Results :\n\n🥇 Firestorm\n\n🐟 Smolfeesh\n\n🥉 Stickmancomic\n\nReported by QuickAndSmart\n\n🇸🇬 Winners of Tetralympic Season 3 Singapore :\n\n🥇 Intris\n\n🥈 kvodeth\n\n🥉 Darylgolden\n\nReported by Skyllabtw\n\nTETR.IO Amateur Weekly (TAWS) News (Reported by Ads20000):\n\nTAWS 48 Winner - Clashkiller2000 (Prediction Winner hju99)\n\nTAWS Asia 16 Winner - Purplegaze (Prediction Winner hju99)\n\nAds20000's Birthday Battle Winner - ඞ (Edge, Kec, rheeneetus)\n\nUpcoming:\n\n6/22: TAWS U 9 (TETR.IO )\n\n6/25: Tetralympic S3 Bronze, Gold (TETR.IO )\n\n6/26: Tetralympic S3 Silver, Master (TETR.IO ) Tetralympics Info\n\n7/1: SuperU/X (TETR.IO )\n\n7/2: TETR.IO Journey: Sunbright (TETR.IO ) Info\n\n7/3: TAWS 49 (TETR.IO )\n\n7/9: Star Cup: Constellation (TETR.IO )\n\n7/17: Modern Tetris Showdown (TETR.IO ) (TE:C ) Trailer & Info\n\n7/24: TAWS Open 20 (TETR.IO )\n\nBefore you go..."
