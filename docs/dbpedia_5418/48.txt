Biography

Mexican television actor, comedian and internet personality who co-created the popular Harold Benny Show YouTube page (2.5 million followers) and the very successful Harold-Benny Vine account. He has 1 million followers on Twitter and nearly 1 million on Instagram as of May 2020.

From 2012 to 2014, he played Ramón "Monche" Barragán in La CQ, a Mexican/Venezuelan television series, which chronicles the adventures of eight students at Middle School Constantino Quijano. Monche is the most naive comedian of the group. He often tells nonsensical jokes or makes dumb comments, and sometimes spies on the cheerleaders or sneaks into the girls' restroom.
