Key Largo is a 1948 American film noir directed by John Huston and starring Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson and Lauren Bacall. The supporting cast features Lionel Barrymore and Claire Trevor. The film was adapted by Richard Brooks and Huston from Maxwell Anderson's 1939 play of the same name, which played on Broadway for 105 performances in 1939 and 1940.

Key Largo was the fourth and final film pairing of actors Bogart and Bacall, after To Have and Have Not (1944), The Big Sleep (1946), and Dark Passage (1947), although they also appeared together in a television version of The Petrified Forest with Henry Fonda, as a 1955 episode of the anthology series Producer's Showcase. Claire Trevor won the 1948 Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance as a drunken ex-singer, a former moll of Robinson's character.
