        "text": "A tense film thriller has been developed from Maxwell Anderson’s play, Key Largo. Emphasis is on tension in the telling, and effective use of melodramatic mood has been used to point up the suspense.\n\nThere are overtones of soapboxing on a better world but this is never permitted to interfere with basic plot. Key West locale is an aid in stressing tension that carries through the plot. Atmosphere of the deadly, still heat of the Keys, the threat of a hurricane and the menace of merciless gangsters make the suspense seem real, and Huston’s direction stresses the mood of anticipation.\n\nHumphrey Bogart is seen as a veteran, stopping off at Key Largo to visit the family of a buddy killed in the war. He finds the run-down hotel taken over by a group of gangsters, who are waiting to exchange a load of counterfeit for real cash. Kept prisoners over a long day and night, during which a hurricane strikes, the best and the worst is brought out in the characters.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe excitement generated is quiet, seldom rambunctious or slambang, although there are moments of high action. The performances are of uniform excellence and go a long way towards establishing credibility of the events.\n\n1948: Best Supp. Actress (Claire Trevor)"
