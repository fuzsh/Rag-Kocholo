        "text": "‘Refuge England: Blacklisted American Directors and ’50s British Noir’ I wrote this for Kiss the Blood off My Hands: Re-Screening Classic American Film Noir, an impressive collection of essays on film noir edited by Robert Miklitsch of Ohio University and published by University of Illinois Press in 2014. It took me into the huge area of scholarship dealing with HUAC and the Hollywood blacklist and made me realise just how talented and interesting these guys are. It also made me aware of how important the American expatriate community was in London in the 50s and how it intersected with British left-wing circles.\n\nThis article explores Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips’ recycling of film noir images and tropes in The Fade Out, a twelve-issue comic book series that borrows heavily from photographic and cinematic materials (including publicity stills and actors’ head shots) to craft a ‘remediated’ vision of old Hollywood that is simultaneously deceptive and truthful about the harsh realities of working in an industry popularly known as the ‘Dream Factory’. The nightmares that haunt the narrative’s protagonist, Charlie Parish, tied to his military past as well as to his relationship to a dead starlet named Valeria Sommers, are referred to by the narrator as ‘half-remembered images’, a fitting description of the way in which Phillips’ own drawings – his nearly ‘perfect’ reproductions of earlier photos and movie scenes – are actually incomplete without the kind of historical contextualization that this series demands. By juxtaposing panels from the comic book with those original images, the author reveals how, beneath the nostalgic surface of The Fade Out, a deeper message about cultural memory and historical archiving is being articulated. Mixing real-world figures (e.g. screen icons such as Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, Clark Gable) and fictional characters who nevertheless call to mind actual people from Hollywood’s past, this comic book series invites us to speculate on the demands of the star system as well as on the possibility that our own fading memory might make such distinctions (e.g. between ‘real’ and ‘fake’) less clear in the years to come.\n\nResumen. El estado de crisis es inherente al cine negro. Este es representado en un género que se alimentó del bagaje cultural aportado por directores cuya procedencia centroeuropea y ascendencia judía condicionaron los recursos narrativos y estéticos que se utilizarían para plasmar el drama y angustia propios del. Uno de los elementos de representación de estas crisis fue la música, tanto incidental como diegética. Por el carácter eminentemente realista de este cine, prestaremos atención a la segunda, concretamente, a la denominada música clásica. Tras el visionado de cincuenta películas de la edad de oro del cine negro hollywoodiense, observamos que esta música se emplea como elemento de representación de crisis culturales, sociales y personales, y su uso funcional juega un papel decisivo Palabras clave: Cine negro; Hollywood; década 1940; música diegética; música clásica; crisis [en] Source Musicalization of Crisis in the 40s Hollywoodian Film Noir Abstract. The state of crisis is inherent in. It is represented in a genre that was nourished by the cultural baggage of several directors whose Central European origin and Jewish ancestry conditioned the narrative and aesthetic resources that would be used to capture the drama and anguish of. One of the key elements of representation of these crises was music, both incidental and diegetic. Due in Hollywood, we observed that this music is used as an element of representation of cultural, social and personal crises, and its functional use plays a crucial role in the survival of the interpretative musical canon, as well as the values associated with its meaning.\n\nThe November 1997 issue of Index magazine featured a rather unusual piece by avantgardist John Jesurun, which apparently had surprised even the editors – and this despite having commissioned the contribution themselves. Building on the already troubled conversion from James M. Cain's 1941 novel Mildred Pierce to the 1945 film produced by Jerry Wald via multiple screenwriters and many more rewrites, this essay approaches the theme of betrayal so conspicuous in both works less from the narrative angle than from a processual angle inspired by the principle of incommensurability. To this end, it juxtaposes the 'classical' adaptation from the Hollywood studio era with Jesurun's experimental reimagining of the betrayal theme as a homology-based remodelling.\n\nIn order to account for how Norwegian film noir relates to shifting historical trends, the structure of the dissertation follows the outline by which film noir is usually organized. It starts with the classic period of the forties and fifties, moves to the resurrection of the seventies, and then to the self-conscious revival of the eighties, and finally to the artistic/independent mass-market film of the late nineties. Naturally, such generalized categories do not tell the whole truth. But they do suggest a pattern – a pattern into which Norwegian film noir apparently also falls."
