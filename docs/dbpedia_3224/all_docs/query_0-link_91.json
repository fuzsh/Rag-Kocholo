        "text": "It is whimsical that the Warners, who had a great deal to do with the rise of the gangster in the movies, should have been as persistent as they have in dispatching this legendary character to limbo over a period of years. Ever since \"The Petrified Forest,\" back in 1936, they have made several obvious occasions to kiss the boy goodbye. Now, in their latest, \"Key Largo,\" which came to the Strand yesterday, they subject him to the final irony: they have him enacted again by no less a one than Edward G. Robinson and then they let a reformed Humphrey Bogart bump him off.This, to the old gangster-film fan, will smack distinctly of race suicide—or, at least, of deliberate self-destruction of a type through internecine strife. And this was, no doubt, an intention of those who arranged to bring two such notorious veterans of the old days together in this film. For a great deal of pertinent suggestion is unquestionably conveyed by the spectacle of one classic film thug putting the quietus on another one. Unfortunately, the staggering impact of the image itself is somewhat lost in an excess of prefatory talking, much of it along philosophical lines.In making this screen translation of an old Maxwell Anderson play—in which, incidently, Paul Muni played the Bogart role, in 1939—Director John Huston has certainly done a great deal to tighten and speed a still overcrowded story of the forces of evil versus good. He has dropped out a lot of prior build-up, thrown away some complexities and avoided the final fatalism which Mr. Anderson always seems to indulge.Now he has got a story of two strong men who come face to face in a hotel, shut down for the summer, on a sweaty Florida key. One is a hard-bitten fellow, ex-Army and ex-idealist, who is visiting the wife and father of a buddy killed in the war. The other is an old-time gangster, run out of the country years ago, who is set upon making a comeback with the old cruelty and arrogance.With remarkable filming and cutting, Mr. Huston had notably achieved a great deal of interest and tension in some rather static scenes—and scenes, too, that give the bald appearance of having been written for the stage. Though largely confined to a few rooms, he kept people on the move and has used an intrusive hurricane for some slam-bang melodramatic effects.He has also got stinging performances out of most of his cast—notably out of Mr. Robinson, who plays the last of the red-hot gangsters in top-notch style. Indeed, Mr. Robinson's performance is an expertly timed and timbred scan of the vulgarity, corruption and egoism of a criminal man. Mr. Bogart's enactment of a fellow who blows both hot and cold is also penetrating, largely because it's on the acid side. Lionel Barrymore is sharp as an old codger who is full of ineffectual bravery, and Lauren Bacall is solemnly righteous as a war-widowed country girl. Picturesque performances of assorted henchmen and a moll are given by Thomas Gomez, Harry Lewis and Claire Trevor.But the script prepared by Mr. Huston and Richard Brooks was too full of words and highly cross-purposed implications to give the action full chance. Talk—endless talk—about courage and the way the world goes gums it up. And the simple fact is that much of it is pompous and remote. Also the presentation of old-time gangsterism in this light shows up its obsolescence. The Warners were sentimental, perhaps.On the stage at the Strand are Billie Holiday, Stump and Stumpy and Count Basie and his band.\n\nKEY LARGO, screen play by Richard Brooks and John Huston, based on the play by Maxwell Anderson; directed by John Huston; produced by Jerry Wald for Warner Brothers Pictures.
