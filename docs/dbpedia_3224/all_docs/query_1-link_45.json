        "text": "A hurricane forces a gangster on the run to seek shelter in a Florida Keys hotel run by wheelchair-bound Lionel Barrymore and his beautiful daughter-in-law Lauren Bacall. Fortunately for all good-hearted people, Humphrey Bogart also happens to be trapped by the weather, though his post-War commitment to non-violence complicates his ability to protect the innocent.\n\n“Still one of John Huston’s best efforts.” – Dave Kehr, Chicago Reader"
