I refer to real history and not just a story. From looking through many web sites of which many have a tab titled \"history.\" I think the word is a very misused word. Even when end notes are used, there subject I want to research has no end note, or it is a 300 page book. I moved to Key West in 1947 on a motorcycle and do not actually recall ever noticing it. My recollection of how far apart structures were in the Upper Key, I feel certain that I saw it but with a speed limit of 65 mph and I was traveling at least 70 mph it my attention would have been more on the driveways.\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n-----End-----\n\nBACK to PAGE ONE"
