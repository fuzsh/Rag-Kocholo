In part this reflects the characteristic tendency of film studies to privilege texts (and textual interpretation) over contexts where films are located as part of wider processes of production and reception. This general tendency is accentuated in the case of film noir because it is, notoriously, a retrospective category, one “invented”by French critics and not used by American studios or filmmakers themselves when the movies were actually made. In Steve Neale’s view, this invalidates understanding film noir as a production category because its presence “cannot be verified by reference to contemporary studio documents, discussions or reviews, or to any other contemporary intertextual source.”1 Neale’s skepticism, while valuable in its requirement to adduce empirical data for the existence of film noir rather than work with loose invocations of a hypothetical category, misperceives the ways in which film noir operated as a production category, albeit one that went under other labels. As Sheri Chinen Biesen has demonstrated in her important study Blackout: World War II and the Origins of Film Noir (2005) through extensive contemporaneous documentation, “[T]he American film industry and domestic press Andrew Spicer 131 recognized these noir pictures as a growing movement before they were formally acclaimed in France in 1946. By 1944 Hollywood studio publicity and critics in the United States had already identified these innovative films as a bold new trend called the ‘red meat crime cycle.’”2 As Biesen argues, the huge box-office revenue for Paramount’s Double Indemnity (September 1944)—$2,500,000 in North American rentals alone—“offered studios tangible incentives for jumping on the noir band-wagon.”3 “Red meat” crime films could exploit a less-restrictive censorship regime that allowed greater latitude in the depiction of sex and violence, were able to disguise wartime constraints that reduced the sum that could be spent on sets and décor, and could also engage with contemporary anxieties generated by the war through their focus on social dislocation and psychological disturbance.4 This“red meat”trend—now known by its French label, film noir—exemplified what Richard Maltby argues is the characteristic tendency of Hollywood feature-film production: volatile cycles of films initiated by the success of an originating film or films (in this instance Double Indemnity) rather than the evolution of stable genres.5 Such cycles radiate outward from a narrow base to incorporate the whole industry.6 At its zenith, circa 1950, film noir represented—depending on the strictness of definition—between 8 and 15 percent of feature-film production, encompassing all the majors and also the smaller B-feature producers.7 James Naremore has commented that most film noirs were“programmers,”intermediate productions that fell somewhere between first and second features, commanding reasonable budgets but with far less market “hype” on their launch than a full A production.8 As he argues, to understand film noir as a production cycle is not to deny its later construction as a discursive category but to recognize noir as both a body of films from a specific period and “an idea we have projected onto the past.”9 This essay aims to augment the disturbingly slender body of literature on film noir as a production category.10 Its distinctive focus is on the role played by three key producers—Jerry Wald, Adrian Scott, and Mark Hellinger—who helped initiate or transform the noir cycle. Since the rise of the auteur theory and its veneration of the director’s creative role, producers have been given short shrift in film studies—frequently caricatured as philistine and venal, concerned only with the bottom line, a situation replicated by their absence from studies of film noir. However, their importance to the Hollywood film industry during this period is incontestable, as shown in Thomas Schatz’s classic study, The Genius of the System (1989). Producers were the initiators and drivers of the production process, usually taking the key creative decisions . They were not, of course, autonomous agents but formed part of the “corporate art” of the studio that employed them.11 However, there were pronounced variations within..."
