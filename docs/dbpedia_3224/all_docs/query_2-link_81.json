        "text": "Garbo was American film director, producer and screenwriter Albert Lewin first choice for Pandora Reynolds part in the film.\n\nIt would have starred her next to to James Mason. Ava Gardner got the part after Garbo declined. No details are known.\n\nAva Gardner as Pandora\n\nPandora and the Flying Dutchman is a 1951 drama film made by Romulus Films and released by MGM. It was directed by Albert Lewin and produced by Joe Kaufmann and Albert Lewin from his own screenplay, based on the legend of The Flying Dutchman. It starred Ava Gardner and James Mason, and featured Nigel Patrick , Sheila Sim, Harold Warrender, Mario Cabré and Marius Goring. It was shot by cinematographer Jack Cardiff.\n\nFilmposter\n\nGarbo was offered a role in this MGM classic starring Stewar Granger and Mel Ferrer. This was said in a TCM Documentary.\n\nIt was said the the producers wanted Garbo for the part of Marie Antoinette which later went to Nina Foch.\n\nThe part of the French Queen was originally planned to be a far bigger part but the script was re-written. The final scene with Nina Foch as Marie Antoinette was cut in editing.\n\nDVD cover\n\nI think it is also possible that Garbo was also considered for the role of Lenore but there is no proof for this. Ava Gardner was also considered for the part.\n\nEleanor Parker played the beautiful Lenore in the final film version, which was released in 1952.\n\nClarence Brown insisted that a remake of Flesh and the Devil would be a great Comeback for Greta.\n\nThat was already rumoured to be a possible film idea in 1945 but I'm not sure if this is true.\n\nAnyway, Clarence Brown said that Garbo liked the idea and so did MGM. Brown started writing a script but after only two weeks he get a call from MGM.\n\nMGM wanted Ava Gardner\n\nThey told him that they had some new thoughts about the project. The film should be made in South America and not in Germany (due of financial reasons) and than they thought that Ava Gardner could be a better choice for the film instead of Garbo.\n\nI just went out so Clarence Brown.\n\nAfter the filming was stopped of the original Quo Vadis in 1949, the project changed hands the following year.\n\nDirected by Mervyn Le Roy and produced by MGM. A rumor is that the producers wanted to re-team Garbo and Robert Taylor as Lygia and Marcus. It didn't turn out.\n\nWhen Quo Vadis Screenwriter S.N. Behrman tried to get in contact with Garbo, to offer her the part of Lygia, George Schlee prevented it.\n\nMovie poster\n\nMaybe both were just too unhappy that the La Duchess De Langelais film was stopped. Quo Vadis was released in 1951 and the role of Lygia went to Deborah Kerr. It was a big hit.\n\nGli occhi di Greta Garbo it is not a biography. The book contains a collection of short-tales about actors and actresses but they are all invented by the author. There is a little story about Garbo going in the hospital to visit Max Ophuls and they talk about the post-phoned production of the planned Garbo comeback film La Duchess de Langelais.\n\nIn the book it is written that in the early 1950s director Max Ophüls still wanted to do a film with Garbo after the failure of La Duchess de Langelais, were Ophüls was signed to direct in 1949.\n\nManuel Puig, the author of this Italian book writes that Max offered Garbo the lead role in one his next project called Lola Montes.\n\nAutumn 1951, Garbo was secretly in Paris. She travelled as Mrs Clark and had a meeting with famous french fashion designer Christian Dior.\n\nSome magazines wrote that he made some gowns/costumes for a possible Garbo Comeback.\n\nIt is unknown if those costumes were for a film or just fashion for her to wear. Maybe a new photo session? Or for a possible unknown promotion project?\n\nChristian Dior\n\nIts is said that a private fashion show was held with Garbo as a guest. 'Garbo-esque-styled' models were wearing the costumes, Christian Dior made especially for Greta.\n\nThe magazine wrote that she was interested and impressed. It is not known if Garbo ever tried to wear any of those on but a reporter who saw some of the fashion, described two gowns.\n\nOne was an ancient Greece-like inspired homage to Homers 'Penelope' and another one was called 'Duse', inspired by the legendary actress.\n\nAfter the show she thanked Dior and went.\n\nGeorge Cukor tried to get her to star opposite Richard Burton in the film of Daphne du Maurier's book.\n\nShe gave Cukor her okay but relented at the last minute and the role went to Olivia de Havilland. She declined by saying that she could never play a Cornish woman. Cukor was upset.\n\nAbnother source wrote that Garbo dis­cussed the adaptation of this novel with screenwriter Nunnally Johnson, who reported back to George Cukor of their telephone chat:\n\n\"She couldn't have been more charming or adamant. She repeated her several emotional reasons for not wishing to come back into pictures and did this so winningly that I was presently enthusiastically on her side, in fact provided her with several additional reasons which up to that moment she hadn't thought of.\n\nThe passion was so evident in my voice and manner that she quite prudently avoided any sugges­ tion of a meeting in person. This was no time for any of us to lose our heads.\"\n\nActing on Garbo's behalf, Salka Viertel and George Schlee approached David Selznick about a joint production with Svensk Filmindustri, of Lady Chatterley's Lover. Selznick was tempted, but finally decided to \"toss up the sponge on it,\" fearing interfer­ence from censors.\n\nThis was going to be a Selznick co-production with Svensk Filmindustri & Gustaf Molander. Based on the scandalous novel with a screenplay by Salka Viertel.\n\nGarbo's version was said to be completely re-written with less exploit love scenes and the story was placed to Sweden.\n\nBut the Breen office denied, even the consideration, to publish the film for the American market, so the project was stopped.\n\nIn 1955, Danielle Darrieux (who once was called the French Garbo) starred in a French film version of Lady Chatterley's Lover. Due to its content, the film was banned by the Catholic censors in the United States.\n\nLady Chatterley's Lover is a novel by D. H. Lawrence written in 1928. Printed privately in Florence in 1928, it was not printed in the United Kingdom until 1960 (other than in an underground edition issued by Inky Stephensen's Mandrake Press in 1929).\n\nProducer Selznick told Feldmen (Garbo's New signed Agent) that he would love to give the Duse Story another chance.\n\nFeldman wanted to convince Selznick, that he want Garbo to do a film with Billy Wilder at first.\n\nEleonora Duse\n\nSelznick told him that he thought, that it is impossible, Garbo wouldn't do two films and that she has to decide.\n\nSelznick didn't want Garbo to sign a contract again for anyone else but him and that their future works could be a new start for her and that she should trust him and put her career in his hands.\n\nThis was Selznick's last real try to get Garbo back on screen.\n\nOn May 16th, 1951, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer announced that Garbo and Dore Schary, the company's vice president in charge of production, have discussed the prospect of a screen comeback for Miss Garbo. John Gunther, author and political commentator, will come to Hollywood next week to consult with Schary about the story he has written as a vehicle for Miss Garbo. The Gunther yarn was described only as having \"a European background.\"\n\nLater it was announced that the screenplay was based on famous John Gunther novel Death be not proud. Its about the life and early death of his teenage son Johnny, who died from a brain tumour.\n\nJohn Gunther\n\nGarbo was a friend with John and Frances Gunther and it was John's wish that Garbo should star in a movie version of his novel which he than wanted to dedicate to his son.\n\nDeath Be Not Proud is a memoir by American author John Gunther, taking its name from Holy Sonnet 10 by John Donne. In the book, he records the true story of his teenage son's struggle to overcome a brain tumor, and his ultimate death at the age of seventeen. The book, published in 1949, records in simple detail all the events and tensions that made up the months that Johnny Gunther fought for his life and his parents sought to help him through recourse to every medical possibility then known.\n\nPartly because of its stark honesty about the pain that this kind of struggle causes a family, and partly because of its refreshingly revealing portrait of a brilliant young man (he discovered a new way to liquefy ammonia) struck down too young by incurable illness, Death Be Not Proud became a best-selling book that is still popular today.\n\nWriter Truman Capote was very interested in writing a script based on Dinesen's The Dreamers.\n\nHe hoped that this would be the reason for her to come out of her retirement.Truman once said that he wrote the screenplay for the most beautiful woman on earth.\n\nIn The Dreamers writer Isak Dinesen (Out of Africa) uses the concept of identity to offer a way to cope with tragedy.\n\nA famous opera singer, Pellegrina Leoni, loses her voice in a terrible fire. Afterwards she pursues a life of constantly changing roles. The author delivers this tale as a tragicomedy. The heroine dies at the end after some joyous adventures under assumed names. Karen Blixen later said that the diva's loss of voice represents her own failure with her farm, and in this story she evaluates how to go on living. With a clear identity as an opera singer, Pellegrina experiences earthly paradise. But tragedy makes her assume a series of masks. By living in her imagination, she escapes responsibility for life's troubles. At the end of the tale when she has to face her real identity, she dies.\n\nTruman Capote\n\nOn December 1927, Capote wrote a letter to his friend Robert Lonscott: I showed Garbo the story because, in my opinion, it depends on her doing the part. The opinion she gave me wasn't very coherent... but she said, and I think she's right, that it depends on the treatment of the script.... She didn't gave a definitive answer but she didn't closed the door -that was the answer I was expecting....I am reasonably sure that Rossellini would make 'The Dreamers'... but he'll want his wife, Ingrid Bergman, to be the leading actress and he will also want to direct it.... I guess Bergman could do that part pretty well, but after all, my opinion is that this movie is perfect for Garbo. We need to find a director who's not married with an actress."
