        "text": "Although only a year older than Elvis, Hope Lange played a character who was supposed to be several years older. Lange made her Broadway début in The Patriots in 1943. In 1956 she made her screen début in Bus Stop, as did her future husband, Don Murray. They were divorced during the production of Wild in the Country. Lange rewrote some of her dialogue in the film so well that director Philip Dunne gave her his Writers Guild of America membership card.\n\nTuesday Weld was born Susan Ker Weld on Thursday, August 27, 1943. She made her movie début in 1956's Rock, Rock, Rock. Her singing voice was dubbed by Connie Francis in that film. For one season (1959-60), Weld played Thalia Menninger, the object of Dobie Gillis's affections in the TV series, The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. During the filming of Wild in the Country, she started work on Return to Peyton Place. Her schedule was juggled for a brief time so that she could do both films. Weld created a minor ruckus on the 20th Century-Fox lot when she insisted on having her white Alsatian dog with her on the set, which was against studio regulations.\n\nOn Elvis, Christina Crawford said, \"I think it is hard to believe that it is actually Elvis Presley who is working here with me every day. And it's even harder to relate him to the boy who misses lunch almost every day only to play football and get rid of some of his excessive energy. One day he was just sitting with me and some friends during a break and he did not have a guitar but started singing a beautiful song. No one said a word, but I did ask him if it was one of his new releases. Elvis smiled and replied it was just an old folk song he loved to sing, but that RCA wouldn't let him record it because it wasn't commercial enough.\" By the way, Elvis did ask the producer, Jerry Wald, to remove all songs from the movie, but he refused.\n\nDuring the shoot, Elvis developed a huge boil on his rear end. The studio doctor was called to the motel and he lanced it. When Hope Lange learned that Elvis wasn't well, she came to the motel suite to see how he was. \"What's the problem?\" she asked him. \"I got a boil on my ass,\" he said, trying to play it off as a joke, but clearly embarrassed in front of this cool, elegant movie star. \"Let me see,\" Hope said. Before Elvis could stop her, she yanked down the covers and examined the boil. Alan Fortas, Gene Smith and Joe Esposito almost died of laugher. Elvis turned beet red and jerked the covers back. After a few days, the wound healed, but every once in a while, Hope strolled over to Elvis and inquired with a concerned look, \"How's your ass?\"\n\nElvis' love and understanding of children was genuine and reciprocal. He had a way with them that was magical. Philip Dunne remembers, \"Our rather shy eight-year-old daughter couldn't be made to shake hands. Elvis persuaded her to. He simply held out his hand and said in a direct order, 'Jessica, put her there... Come on, stop stalling, you're going to shake hands.' And she did. And at that moment I saw what he might have become were it not for instant fame, the Colonel and the stooges. What I had against Tom Parker was the fact that he was a tasteless man who had power, and used it.\""
