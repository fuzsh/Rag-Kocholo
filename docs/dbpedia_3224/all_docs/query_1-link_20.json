        "text": "If you‚Äôre a Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall or Edward G. Robinson fan then this is your blog. It‚Äôs here on this EXACT site ‚ÄúThe Caribbean Club‚Äù that the 1948 Hollywood film classic ‚ÄúKey Largo‚Äù was filmed starring the three fore-mentioned movie stars. Directed by legendary director John Houston, this is the fourth and FINAL pairing of the real-life married couple of Bogart & Bacall.\n\nAllow yourself enough time to park the car and walk inside where the walls are filled with memorabilia from this classic film. After photographing the main sign in front of the building, walk to the front door and look to the right seeing a wooden statue of Bogart himself that EXACTLY replicates the nearly life-size pin-up near the fireplace inside. I‚Äôve included some photos of my time walking around and inside the building that you can see below. Not only was ‚ÄúKey Largo‚Äù filmed here but also the Jack Nicholson film ‚ÄúBlood & Wine‚Äù‚Ä¶ hmmmm, guess I must have missed that one! üôÇ\n\nThe Caribbean Club is in Key Largo at Mile Marker 104.2 bayside. This is WELL WORTH a stop on your trip, just the scenery around it is worth it my friends! Put this on your LIST!"
