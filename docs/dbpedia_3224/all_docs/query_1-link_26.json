        "text": "A missed opportunity, perhaps, but still an entertaining one.\n\nKey Largo doesn’t actually do all that much with its most tantalizing elements: Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Instead, director John Huston hands the movie over to Edward G. Robinson – which I suppose makes sense considering his Johnny Rocco is a gangster who has commandeered a Florida hotel.\n\nBogart plays Frank McCloud, a World War II vet visiting the widow (Bacall) and father (Lionel Barrymore) of a man who died under his command. They run a hotel in the Florida Keys, and McCloud arrives to discover that Rocco and his henchmen have holed up there as fugitives. A standoff of sorts ensues, heightened by an approaching hurricane that pins everyone down and amps up the sweaty claustrophobia."
