Bacall plays the daughter of proprietor Lionel Barrymore, and noir’s grandest dame, Claire Trevor, is Gaye Dawn, a broken-down chanteuse who’s Eddie G.’s booze-sodden moll. Trevor won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar® for her memorable performance. John Huston’s direction oozes discomfort in every frame, from the claustrophobic staging to the sweat-drenched close-ups of henchmen. So much time is spent on the threat of violence that when things finally do turn bloody in the final act, the impact is devastating.",
