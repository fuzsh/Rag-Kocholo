        "text": "Humphrey Bogart. What a guy. All you need is this guy and his world-weary smirk and calm hound-dog eyes and you've got a movie with a totally unflappable, centered hero. Movies surely were greenlighted and made solely on the basis of Bogart's cooperation. Add to that, though, his real-life wife Lauren Bacall (with whom he'd co-starred in The Big Sleep to rave reviews) and director John Huston (who had previously directed Bogart in The Maltese Falcon) and you've got a serious classic. You've got Key Largo.\n\nThe Movie\n\nBogart stars as ex-Army officer Frank McCloud, who's visiting Key Largo, Florida to meet the widow and the father (Bacall and Lionel Barrymore) of his friend who died in the war. The old man runs a hotel in Key Largo, and he's got an unwanted guest: Mobster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), who along with his entourage takes the hotel hostage when a hurricane strikes. Guess who's the only one that can save the innocent?\n\nBogart is very understated in this picture, leaving the scenery chewing to Barrymore (who also played Mr. Potter in It's a Wonderful Life), Robinson (a guy born to play a mobster if ever there was one), and Claire Trevor as Rocco's alcoholic mistress (she won an Academy Award).\n\nThe dynamic between Bogart and Bacall is interesting, as well, because it's so subtle. With all the hoopla around their innuendo-rich pairing in The Big Sleep, it must have been tempting to try and do the same thing again, but the interplay between the two is restrained here-- and that's an understatement.\n\nAnyway, the hurricane makes for close quarters, and a great opportunity for the ensemble cast to really stretch its muscles, and they do so admirably. This is a great old movie.\n\n8 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nFor a 52-year-old movie, Key Largo looks pretty good. It's in black and white of course, and there is definitely some wear and tear on the source print, but the transfer is lovely. The contrast is nice, the edges aren't overenhanced, and the black areas, though not quite black, are free of dancing squares. There's nothing to cheer about, but nothing to complain about either.\n\n5 out of 10\n\nThe Audio\n\nMan, reviews of old movies like this are easier to write than these newfangled Dolby 5.1 reviews. Key Largo is in mono. Dolby Digital mono, but mono nonetheless. With source material of this age, the only fair thing to mention about the sound is a) the mix between dialogue and music and b) background noise. Well, this baby's fine on both counts. The score is understated (like the rest of the movie) and there is no hissing in the background, surprisingly.\n\n5 out of 10\n\nThe Extras\n\nThere's very little here, but in cases like this, where all the principals are dead, what do you want? Actually, I take that back-- Lauren Bacall's still alive. And she's got that great voice. Why didn't they get her to do a commentary track? She can't be too busy.\n\nThere is a trailer here, of course, and a text essay on the making of the film. Apparently there was some real friction between the author of the source material and director Huston. Anyway, that's all there is. Not much, but there's not much you could ask for-- in 1948, there was no \"Spotlight on Location.\"\n\n3 out of 10\n\nWith an old movie like this, we sort of have to give low audio/video/extras scores, but they don't really hurt our appreciation of the DVD for what it is-- a nice clean print of a great old movie."
