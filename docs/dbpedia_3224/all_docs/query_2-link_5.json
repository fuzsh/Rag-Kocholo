He quickly advanced and soon persuaded Warner Bros. to produce a series of short subjects featuring radio stars called \"Rambling 'round Radio Row.\" But it was a biographical article he ghostwrote for the crooner Russ Columbo that gave Wald his break in motion pictures. Warners bought the story, and signed Wald to collaborate on Twenty Million Sweethearts, featuring their rising musical star Dick Powell. Between 1934 and 1941, Wald worked in some capacity on some 30 pictures and was credited with several original stories. His most frequent cowriters were Julius Epstein (who later gained fame collaborating with his brother Philip) and the ex-magazine writer Richard Maccauly. During these early years, Wald's films were primarily formula musicals (In Caliente, Ready, Willing, and Able, Hollywood Hotel) and lightweight comedies (Sons o' Guns, Hard to Get, Brother Rat).\n\nDespite Wald's status as a writer, he desperately wanted to function as a producer. Even in the mid-1930s he was acting as an \"idea\" man—generating original story ideas or suggesting plot blendings or remakes—and depended on dedicated writers like Epstein or Maccauly to develop and execute the concepts. Towards the end of the decade, Wald's pictures incorporated more dramatic material. Associations with the writer-producer Mark Hellinger led to credits on The Roaring Twenties, Torrid Zone, They Drive By Night, and Manpower, and steered Wald in the direction which would characterize many of his productions of the 1940s: Realism. Hellinger also provided Wald with his step up to associate producer on Navy Blues when in the middle of the picture Hellinger fell out with Jack Warner, left the studio, and Wald took over, finishing the production.\n\nOnce promoted to associate producer, Wald established himself with gritty dramas like The Hard Way and a series of popular war pictures, Across the Pacific, Action in the North Atlantic, Destination Tokyo, and Objective, Burma!. He was personally responsible for resurrecting Joan Crawford's career after her dismissal from MGM by casting her in her Academy Award-winning role in Mildred Pierce; he sustained her comeback with a series of starring roles in Humoresque, Possessed, Flamingo Road, and The Damned Don't Cry. He believed there was \"no such thing as a washed-up star, only washed-up stories,\" and proved it not only with Crawford but with Jane Wyman (Johnny Belinda), Claire Trevor (Key Largo), and Lana Turner (Peyton Place).\n\nIn contrast to a methodical, detail-oriented producer like David Selznick, Wald's industrious, enterprising nature drove him to move quickly from one project to the next. Typically, he would initiate an idea, find the appropriate writer, director, and cast, switch to another project (or two) and then only become seriously involved again to promote the finished project. He was a voracious reader and never gave up his New York connections for fresh stories and new writers. He kept massive files with picture ideas and notebooks jammed with partially developed future projects, most of which he knew would never be realized. He ended his astonishingly prolific and long association with Warner Bros. in 1950, having produced an impressive list of critical and box office successes. In eight years, he had produced 30 more pictures, 12 of them based on his own stories, and prepared at least ten additional properties which were eventually turned over to other producers on the lot. He considered his pinnacle at Warners to be Johnny Belinda, a story of a deaf-mute girl which Jack Warner believed was too obscure to have box-office appeal. The film, however, not only won an Academy Award for Best Actress for Jane Wyman but also earned Wald the prestigious Irving G. Thalberg Award.\n\nAt RKO Wald ran an independent production company with his partner, the writer Norman Krasna, under studio-head Howard Hughes. After only two years, he moved again to become Harry Cohn's vice president in charge of production at Columbia Pictures. He enjoyed another profitable tenure, this time at 20th Century-Fox where he formed Jerry Wald Productions, and produced another string of hits, beginning in 1957 with the blockbuster Peyton Place. Unlike his films at Warners, his Fox productions were lavish, often in CinemaScope and/or Technicolor. They covered everything from serious social topics (No Down Payment) to glossy biographies (Beloved Infidel) to escapistic romance (An Affair to Remember).\n\nAlthough Hollywood legend has it that Jerry Wald provided the model for Budd Schulberg's famous character Sammy Glick in What Makes Sammy Run?, Wald's body of work clearly indicates that he was more than just an ambitious showman who capitalized on the talents of others. A more accurate evaluation of the producer's contribution is perhaps the sentiment attributed to Darryl F. Zanuck, \"If it were possible, I'd have ten Jerry Walds working at the studio!\"\n\n—Joanne L. Yeck"
