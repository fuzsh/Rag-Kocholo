        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis chapter is the first to be written about the role the producer played in creating 'classic' film noir (1940-1959). It explores the work of three contrasting producers, Jerry Wald (studio-based); Adrian Scott (studio, then blacklisted; and Mark Hellinger (independent). The chapter argues that each, in their different ways, was important to the development of film noir in America and therefore that the role of the producer needs to be recognized as significant in the creation of film noir."
