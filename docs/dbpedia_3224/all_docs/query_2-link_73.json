        "text": "During the war against the Trust, Lasky and his director, Cecil B. DeMille, shot movies in Southern California to escape the Edison people's subpoenas. The year-round sunshine proved ideal for filmmaking. After the Zukor merger, Lasky remained in Los Angeles while Zukor headed up the East Coast operation with brother-in-law Goldfish.\n\nZukor and Goldfish both had healthy egos, and they constantly were at loggerheads over the direction to take the company. Finally, Goldfish withdrew in a huff and left for the West Coast where, under the name Samuel Goldwyn, he became a powerful independent producer-- a studio unto himself.\n\nLater, when Budd Schulberg wrote his unflattering portrait of Hollywood, What Makes Sammy Run?, Goldwyn offered him several hundred thousand dollars not to publish the novel.\n\nAn outraged Goldwyn told the young prince, to whom Hollywood had given so much, that he was \"doublecrossing the Jews.\" (Otto Friedrich, City of Nets, London, Headline, 1986 ed.)\n\nAs a child, Budd Schulberg considered Adolph Zukor a \"surrogate grandfather,\" and father Ben remained the producer's \"trusted lieutenant.\"\n\nBut Ben was not satisfied knocking out press releases. He decided to form his own studio around the country's leading actors and came up with a name: United Artists.\n\nAlong with a top Paramount official, Ben resigned to Zukor's great dismay and traveled to California to pitch his proposal to Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin.\n\nAdeline Schulberg urged her husband to \"get it on paper,\" but Ben ignored his wife's warning.\n\nOut in L.A., Douglas Fairbanks, an otherwise nice goyische boy, took the idea and ran with it--shutting Ben out completely.\n\nBen Schulberg was young--only 27. He bounced back. With a modest lawsuit settlement, Ben set up shop and was soon turning out silent movies from a studio on Mission Road in the old Spanish section of Los Angeles.\n\nTo cut his overhead, Ben shared expenses with another producer, Louis Mayer, a former junk dealer from Canada who had come to boomtown Los Angeles to try his luck in the movies. They called their operation the Mayer-Schulberg Studio.\n\nMayer was tough, a two-faced. For years, he would terrorize actors and studio employees alike. Budd Schulberg later referred to him as \"a Jewish Himmler.\"\n\nOne day Ben Schulberg arrived at the studio to discover that Mayer had decamped. The producer had disappeared overnight, taking his entire operation with him, including a young assistant named Irving Thalberg.\n\nIt turned out that Mayer had been negotiating secretly with Marcus Loew, a theater magnate, to take over two foundering studios Loew controlled: Metro, and another operation Loew had inherited from Sam Goldwyn.\n\nThe new company--renamed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer-- was soon flying high while Ben Schulberg remained on Mission Road stuck with the entire rent for the Mayer- Schulberg Studio.\n\n\"Never trust anybody in this business,\" Adeline Schulberg used to tell her husband--an admonition that her son, Budd, must have had in mind when he created Sammy Glick, the prototype Hollywood conman who was perpetually in motion (and usually scheming).\n\nAdolph Zukor was a rough customer; a relative referred to him as \"a shark.\" Zukor once fired an employee for exaggerating his skill at bridge. Yet, the old man hired Ben Schulberg back as Paramount's chief of West Coast production at a princely salary.\n\nZukor's decision was practical. He knew he needed Ben if Paramount was to compete with MGM whose production chief, Irving Thalberg, the so-called \"boy wonder,\" was turning out movies with clockwork precision. Thalberg was a Brooklyn-born momma's boy, but around the MGM studio they said he \"could piss ice water.\"\n\nFrom 1925 to 1932 B.P. headed production at Paramount, and young Budd had a catbird's view of the workings of a major studio.\n\nAs a teenager, notebook in hand, Budd sat in on story conferences and wandered around the lot, talking to directors and actors, as well as studio blowhards who hung around the commissary, scooping up other people's ideas and passing them off as their own--just like Sammy Glick would do in Schulberg's novel.\n\nParamount had its share of stars--Gary Cooper, Claudette Colbert--but the studio could not catch MGM. Irving knew how to delegate, Adeline would complain to her husband, while Ben surrounded himself with \"schmucks\" and gambling cronies.\n\nMoreover, increasingly, Ben spent his time trying to make a star of his mistress, Sylvia Sidney, a pretty Jewish girl from New York, whom he put in City Streets, and other productions.\n\nThe Depression hit Hollywood at an inauspicious time. Studios were already overextended from wiring their stages for sound and were caught in a crunch when attendance dropped.\n\nParamount's stock plummeted to one dollar. Overnight, Jesse Lasky, Ben Schulberg's immediate boss, lost everything, including his oceanfront mansion.\n\nBacked by Chicago money, new investors deposed Zukor and removed Schulberg as production chief. No other major studio opened its doors for Ben. Louis B. Mayer saw to that.\n\nBy the late 1940s Ben was picking up work as a publicity man for an independent company. He told writer Ezra Goodman that he planned to write a book on Hollywood that \"could top What Makes Sammy Run? easily.\" Ben's novel was still unfinished at the time of his death in Miami, in exile, in 1957. (Ezra Goodman, The Fifty-Year Decline and Fall of Hollywood, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1961)\n\nBudd Schulberg was in school in the East when the ax fell at Paramount, and he was spared some of his father's humiliation, though he never forgave Hollywood.\n\nAfter graduating from a local high school, the future author attended Deerfield Academy for a year, then enrolled at Dartmouth College.\n\nAt Deerfield, Budd experienced anti-Semitism for the first time. The Schulberg family had not been very religious, and, as a teenager, Budd did not think of himself as Jewish. At Deerfield, he sensed that some students \"looked down their Aryan noses\" at him and that even the headmaster was uncomfortable in his company.\n\nWhen the headmaster lectured Schulberg about, \"You people in Hollywood,\" Budd knew he meant, \"You Jews in Hollywood.\"\n\nAt Dartmouth Budd wrote for the school paper and studied sociology. Later, What Makes Sammy Run? was adopted as a sociology textbook at the college.\n\nAfter graduation, Schulberg worked as a novice screenwriter for David Selznick and Walter Wanger, a Dartmouth alumnus who, in the labyrinthine ways of Hollywood, had once jousted for power with B.P. at Paramount.\n\nThe film colony had not changed in Budd's absence. At a cocktail party, Schulberg casually told another young writer about a story he had for a movie. A few days later Budd read that his sympathetic listener had sold the idea to a studio.\n\nAs a hobby, Budd began collecting anecdotes about the young pirates of Hollywood, circa 1936.\n\nThe movie business was still in the grip of the Depression. Labor and management battled it out on every lot. It was a vintage year for someone who was young, ambitious, and cunning.\n\nIn short order, Schulberg sketched out a character based upon several real life individuals: Sammy Glick, a poor boy from the Lower East Side, who had no time for schnorrers as he pushed his way to the top.\n\n\"I'm catching the express now, baby,\" was the way Sammy put it to his chief nemesis, a rabbi's son with a bad case of morality.\n\nSammy made his debut in a series of short stories Schulberg wrote for Liberty magazine. Bennett Cerf of Random House, and Saxe Commins, his top editor, encouraged Schulberg to expand the stories into a novel.\n\nWhen published in 1941, What Makes Sammy Run? was a best seller and was praised by Scott Fitzgerald, John O'Hara, and Dorothy Parker who said the book captured the \"shittiness\" of the film business.\n\nSammy hit Hollywood like a firestorm. Louis B. Mayer attacked the novel publically and privately and vowed to run Schulberg out of town. He almost succeeded. Budd was fired from the Samuel Goldwyn Studios where he was then working, and it was several years before he landed another screenwriting job.\n\nSome critics feared that the book would contribute to the anti-Semitic stereotype of the Hollywood mogul or provide ammo to those who were persecuting the Jews of Europe.\n\nSchulberg strongly objected to this criticism. To him, Sammy represented the dark side of the Horatio Alger legend: someone who was an \"all- American heel,\" regardless of religion.\n\nIndeed, Sammy himself was areligious, as well as apolitical and amoral. When a company informed him that it was not hiring \"Hebes,\" without missing a beat, Sammy passed himself off as an Italian- American.\n\nIn the years since the publication of Sammy, Budd Schulberg has had a distinguished career as a novelist (The Disenchanted, The Harder They Fall) and screenwriter (On the Waterfront)."
