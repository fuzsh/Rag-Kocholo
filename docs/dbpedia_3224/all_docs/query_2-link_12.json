N.p., 1957. Revised Final script for the 1957 film. Specially bound copy belonging to producer Jerry Wald, with his name in gilt on the spine.

In the 1950s he moved to Twentieth Century-Fox, and was the producer there for \"An Affair to Remember\" (1957), \"Peyton Place\" (1957), and \"Sons and Lovers\" (1960).\n\nBased on the 1945 Broadway play by Luther Davis, in turn based on Frederic Wakeman's 1944 novel \"Shore Leave.\" Three Naval pilots on a four-day leave in San Francisco attempt to ignore the distant call of war, instead drinking, dancing, and seducing local women.\n\nSet and shot on location in San Francisco.\n\nBound in light blue cloth with navy quarter leather binding, with five raised bands and gilt titles on the spine.
