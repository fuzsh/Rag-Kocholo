        "text": "Key Largo manages to keep audiences on their toes or at the edge of their seat from start to finish.\n\nFebruary 11, 2024\n\nLoosely based on Maxwell Anderson’s 1939 play, “Key Largo” took the form of a brilliant crime drama anchored by a great cast and superb performances.\n\nAugust 22, 2022\n\nThe real stars of the film are mind games and manipulation, sharply brought to life by the restrained verbal feuding between Bogart and Robinson.\n\nAugust 13, 2020\n\nKey Largo (1948) is one of the more entertaining crime-gangster melodramas from Warner Bros. The intelligent, exciting, theatrical, but moody, downbeat crime drama-thriller (and melodramatic film noir)...\n\nSeptember 29, 2019\n\n...there's an inherent theatricality in the situation of strangers involuntarily sharing a small space...\n\nFebruary 26, 2019\n\nIt's pure irony that perhaps the objective best Bogart and Bacall film has their least satisfying onscreen relationship.\n\nDecember 29, 2018\n\nThis is surprisingly staid for a Huston film. Still, the top-notch cast punches it across, and the swirling storm raging outside the hotel provides an interesting backdrop.\n\nDecember 21, 2018\n\nA classy little '40s chamber piece that is competently handled by writer-director John Huston and supremely well acted by its starry cast.\n\nDecember 16, 2018\n\nFirst seen soaking in a tub while chomping on a cigar, Robinson arises from the water to put a stranglehold on the film.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
