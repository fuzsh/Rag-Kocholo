        "text": "ENGL 104 SEM Borders, Migration, and the Literatures of Displacement\n\nLast offered Fall 2023\n\nIn this course we will read literature that is about migration experiences, border-crossings, and various forms of colonial displacement. Our aim in reading such literature will be not merely to study the problem of borders, displacement, and forced migration from a top-down perspective (like that of the analyst who, for the best of reasons, seeks to understand an issue in order to resolve it); but to shift our own perspective away from a position that assumes that the problem is not truly ours in the first place to deal with. While the contemporary issue of global migration and its particular manifestations in and around the site of the U.S.-Mexico border will be a central component of this course, our readings will not be limited to texts that deal exclusively with the historical present or the U.S.-Mexico border alone. As such, readings will likely include work by figures such as: Américo Paredes, Gloria Anzaldúa, Jason De León, Carmen Boullosa, Héctor Tobar, Javier Zamora, Tayeb Salih, Karen Tei Yamashita, Amara Lakhous, and others.

What metaphors, styles of writing, ideas of \"manners and morals\" does literature about girls explore? What larger cultural and aesthetic concerns are girls made to represent? And how is girlhood articulated alongside and/or intertwined with other identities and identifications, such as race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality? These are some of the issues we will explore in this course. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Kathryn Kent\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 107(F) SEM Temptation\n\nWe want most those things we can't--or shouldn't--have. Or, to put it another way, it is when limitations are placed on our actions by law, religion, or the facts of our own biology that we experience desire most acutely. In this course, we will examine fictional narratives, lyric poems, and philosophical meditations in which people are tempted to act against their better judgement. Free will, ambition, temperance, suspense, despair, and repression will be our conceptual preoccupations. We will get to know such writers and artists as Homer, Euripides, Ovid, Augustine, Shakespeare, Donne, Milton, Laclos, Mozart, Freud, Frost, and Scorsese. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Emily Vasiliauskas\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 109 SEM Narrating Change\n\nLast offered Spring 2024\n\nHow do we narrate change? Change is radical (from radix, \"root,\" thus pertaining to what is essential) when it alters how we experience, think, and act. If we change radically, and the structure of our experience is altered, how are we then to connect what comes before to what comes after? On the other hand, if change does not cause such a transformation in the self, then how is it experienced? The works we will consider in this class will help us examine the ways human beings work through, think about, and represent change. The event of colonization will be our chief example and we will examine it through novels, critical theoretical works, and films that focus on Africa, South Asia and North America. Expect to encounter works by Chinua Achebe, Nadine Gordimer, Satyajit Ray, Saadat Hasan Manto, W.E.B. Du Bois and others. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Paresh Chandra\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 112(F) SEM Introduction to Literary Criticism\n\nWhat determines meaning? How we interpret is inevitably inflected by our own priorities and preoccupations, by the contexts in which we read, by literary and other conventions, and by the historical and personal circumstances of a work's composition, as well as deriving from the particular words of a text and from the mutable life of language itself. So how to go about the task of reading literature well? This course will focus on key introductory methods and critical approaches, and is intended to develop your skills in reading, writing about, discussing and interpreting literary texts. Our initial readings--mainly short fiction and poetry, along with selected introductory work in critical theory--will invite increased self-consciousness about literary form, the functions of criticism, and the process of reading and interpretation. In the last weeks of the course, we will address longer texts, including at least one play, one novel and one film. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: James Pethica\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 113(F) SEM The Feminist Poetry Movement\n\nFeminist poetry and feminist politics were so integrated in the 1960s and 1970s in America that critical essays on poets, such as Adrienne Rich and Audre Lorde, appeared in the same handbook that listed such resources for women as rape crisis centers and health clinics. This course will map the crucial alliance between feminist politics (and its major cultural and political gains) and the feminist poetry movement that became a major \"tool\" for building, organizing, and theorizing second-wave feminism. In order to track this political and poetic revolution, we will take an interdisciplinary approach that brings together historical, critical, and literary documents (including archival ones) and visual products (through the Object Lab of the Williams College Art Museum) that recreate the rich context of the period and help us consider the important social nature of aesthetic production. At the center of the course will be writings of major poets of the period, as well as anthologies and feminist periodicals that published their work and created a significant forum and shared space for women to articulate the politics and poetics of change. These periodicals and anthologies will also help us track the diversity of the feminist poetry movement and its intersection with issues of race, class, ethnicity, and sexuality. Ultimately, we will want to consider how poetry serves as an important tool for thinking through questions of power and injustice and what role it plays in creating necessary imaginative space in the world for expression, critique, and change. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Bethany Hicok\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 114 SEM Literary Speakers\n\nLast offered Fall 2023\n\nThe general purpose of this course is to develop students' skills as interpreters of poetry and short fiction. Its particular focus is on how--and with what effects--poets create the voices of their poems, and fiction writers create their narrators. We'll consider the ways in which literary speakers inform and entice, persuade and sometimes deceive, their audiences. Readings will include texts from various historical periods, with particular emphasis on twentieth-century writers (including works by James Joyce, Henry James, Vladimir Nabokov, Robert Frost, Toni Cade Bambara, Raymond Carver, and Seamus Heaney). [ more ]\n\nTaught by: TBA\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 115 SEM The Literature of Sports\n\nLast offered Fall 2020\n\nThe ubiquity of the sporting event, the athlete as hero, the athlete as failure, the crowd, the fan, the stadium, and all of the complex conflicts therein have long been the subjects of some of the finest writing in America and throughout the world. Writers have used sport as a context through which to explore and examine ideas such as beauty, the sublime, tragedy, politics, race, class, sexuality, and gender. This course will focus on poetry, fiction, and non-fiction invested in the public spectacles and private revelations of sport ranging from the poetics of praise to issues of urbanism, colonialism, globalization with readings by Pindar, Rankine, CLR James, Baldwin, Hemingway, Oates, DeLillo, and many others. [ more ]\n\nENGL 116 SEM The Remix: Adaptation and Revelation\n\nLast offered Fall 2022\n\nThis course explores the ideas of remaking and adaptation. We examine twentieth and twenty-first-century fiction, poetry, film, and hybrid texts that interact with subject matter stretching from Greek mythology to New World castaway stories to global pandemics. What is the nature of the work they attempt? What is lost and gained in these re-visions? In response to these questions, emphasis is placed on critical reading and writing (and rewriting), as well as on research skills. Works considered throughout the term come from, among others, Jorge Luis Borges, Anne Carson, J.M. Coetzee, Alfonso Cuarón, and Natasha Trethewey. [ more ]\n\nENGL 117(F) SEM Introduction to Cultural Theory\n\nThis course has a clear purpose. If you had signed up for a course in biology, you would know that you were about to embark on the systematic study of living organisms. If you were registered for a course on the American Civil War, you would know that there had been an armed conflict between the northern and southern states in the 1860s. But if you decide you want to study \"culture,\" what exactly is it that you are studying? The aim of this course is not to come up with handy and reassuring definitions for this word, but to show you why it is so hard to come up with such definitions. People fight about what the word \"culture\" means, and our main business will be to get an overview of that conceptual brawl. We will pay special attention to the conflict between those thinkers who see culture as a realm of freedom or equality or independence or critical thought and those thinkers who see culture as a special form of bondage, a prison without walls. The course will be organized around short theoretical readings by authors ranging from Matthew Arnold to Laura Mulvey, but we will also, in order to put our new ideas to the test, watch several films (mostly of the class's choosing) and listen to a lot of rock and roll. Why do you think culture matters? Once you stop to pose that question, there's no turning back. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Christian Thorne\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 118 SEM Creative Non-fiction\n\nLast offered Fall 2023\n\nIn this course we will read some of the most prominent practitioners of creative non-fiction--writers like John McPhee, Joan Didion, Malcolm Gladwell, Susan Orlean, Janet Malcolm, Joshua Foer, Zadie Smith and Oliver Sacks. Students will also write in a variety of non-fiction modes--explainers, profiles, essays, memoirs. We will probe the border between invention and fact and consider the ways that narratives are constructed. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: John Kleiner\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 119 SEM Missed Encounters\n\nLast offered Spring 2019\n\nAlthough we all entertain the dream of reaching directly across boundaries of personal and cultural difference, such exchanges remain inseparable from fantasies of otherness. Those fantasies can be as reductive as a stereotype, but they can also be enormously nuanced and self-revealing--as rich as literature itself. We will study the missed encounter--the encounter in which the element of presupposition and fantasy is vividly apparent--in cultural contexts from the first English accounts of the inhabitants of Virginia to race relations in contemporary African fiction; we will consider such encounters in other contexts as well, including sexual relations, the relations between young and old, even the relation between past and present. But in every case, we will keep our gaze trained on what such events tell us about the nature of fantasy and the place of fiction. The course will consider novels, drama, film, opera, and non-fiction, works such as: Coetzee, Waiting for the Barbarians; Harriot, \"Report of the New Found Land of Virginia\"; Conrad, Heart of Darkness; Stephen Crane, \"The Blue Hotel\"; Nadine Gordimer, The Pick Up; Herzog, \"Aguirre\"; Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice; Puccini, Madame Butterfly; Huang, M. Butterfly; Austen, Pride and Prejudice; Gyasi, Homegoing; and theoretical writing, including texts by the psychoanalytic critic, Jacques Lacan. [ more ]\n\nENGL 120(F, S) SEM The Nature of Narrative\n\nNarrative--storytelling--is a fundamental human activity. Narratives provide us with maps of how the world does or should or might work, and we make sense of our own experiences through the narratives we construct ourselves. This course examines the nature and functions of narrative using texts from a wide range of literary traditions, media, and genres. Readings may span classics (e.g. Homerian epic, The Tale of Genji, and/or the Popol Vuh), fiction ranging from nineteenth-century realism to postmodern experimentation (possibly including Kafka, Tolstoy, Toni Morrison, and/or Emile Habibi), and visual literature from film and drama to graphic memoir (possibly including Mizoguchi Kenji, Art Spiegelman, Alison Bechdel, and/or Joe Sacco). We may also read some short works of literary theory from around the world to help us broaden our idea of what literature can be and do. All readings in English. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Sarah Allen\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 121(F) SEM The Literature of Crime\n\nIn this course, we will examine how the law intersects with literature in surprising ways, refracting across an array of plays, novels, films, and TV shows. We will use the law as a prism to explore revenge stories, cop shows, murder mysteries, and hardboiled detective fiction. In each instance, we will need to consider narrative framing, the contested interpretation of events, and authority in multiple senses of that term; punishment, retribution, and mercy; law, norms, and social order; and others. Likely titles include: Django Unchained, Inglourious Basterds, The Oresteia, Hamlet, short stories and novels by Melville, Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, True Detective, and The Wire. We will set these questions against contemporary debates in critical legal studies and the fight against mass incarceration as we try to figure out the ways that literature, plays, and film can represent justice and injustice. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Ali Mctar\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 123(S) SEM The Short Story\n\nThe reading for this course will consist entirely of short stories by such writers as Poe, Hawthorne, James, Doyle, Hemingway, Faulkner, Gilman, Chopin, Cather, Toomer, McCullers, O'Connor, Borges, Nabokov, Kincaid, Saunders, Diaz, and Shepard. We will read one or two per class meeting; at the end of the course, we'll be reading one collection, by Raymond Carver. Reading short stories will allow us to pay close attention to the form of our texts, and to paragraphs, sentences, and words. The premise of the essays you will write is that short stories and short essays are both arts based on controlling the release of information and meaning, and that studying the two genres together will have reciprocal benefits for reading and writing. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: John Limon\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 128 SEM Reading Asian American Literature\n\nLast offered Spring 2020\n\nThough the category and term \"Asian American\" came about as a result of political struggle in the 1960s, what we now call Asian American writing in English began in the nineteenth century and has played a significant role in every American literary \"movement\" from Modernism, realism, protest literature to various avant-gardes, the graphic novel, and digital poetries. This course closely reads a sampling of texts in a variety of genres and styles-produced by writers from various Asian American ethnic groups-from the late nineteenth century to the present and contextualizes them historically, both domestically and globally. We will examine the material, cultural, political, and psychic intersections of larger structural forces with individual writers and texts. Along the way, we will interrogate the notion of \"Asian American\"--its contradictions, heterogeneous nature, and our assumptions--and its relation to the idea of \"American.\" Some questions we will ask: \"Why have Asian Americans and Asian American writers and writing so often been viewed as 'foreign' or 'alien' to the American body politic and the English-language literary tradition?\" \"How might Asian American writing be linked to other English-language texts in the Asian diaspora?\" [ more ]\n\nENGL 130 Writing for the Humanities\n\nLast offered NA\n\nCompelling academic prose is a rare beast. In this course we will investigate what makes for good academic writing and how we can produce it ourselves. We will begin with words, then progress to sentences, paragraphs, and essays. Our reading will be close, our writing closer. Topics include the following: Are adverbs incredibly important? When is less more, and when isn't it? Is your garden English, or is it Chinese? What is the \"uneven U\" and why does it work? How does your audience affect how you write? In addition to reading writing about writing by Orwell, Fish, Tufte, Hayot, and (inevitably) Strunk and White, we will look closely at academic prose out in the wild, both good and bad. This course is for anyone who is interested in exploring in more depth the craft of writing, whether you have always considered yourself a \"good writer\" or struggle to fill a single page (or both). Our focus will be on academic writing for the humanities, but the skills we will develop are relevant to many other contexts as well.

When Sir Thomas Wyatt introduced the sonnet to England in the 1500s with his translations of Petrarch, the form quickly became entrenched in English, and has been in regular use ever since. Originally penned as expressions of idealized love, sonnets soon expanded to address other kinds of emotionally intense relationships--to God, Nature, art, a particular place, the State, oppressors--while still, obsessively, returning to love in all its myriad forms. This makes the sonnet, deeply personal though it is, also a kind of pocket-sized literary tradition, as each new generation of poets extends, disrupts, and comments upon the whole history of sonnets. \"A sonnet is a moment's monument,\" wrote D.G. Rossetti (in, of course, a sonnet)--speaking of the sonnet's tendency to offer just a snapshot of the poet's mental and emotional state--but the tradition of producing numbered sequences of sonnets can also string those moments into a kind of narrative. Similarly, while the sonnet is founded in strong feeling, it is also obsessed with logic, delighting in logical argumentation, contradictions and paradoxes. This course will focus on a broad range of sonnets, historically, geographically and thematically, as well as criticism and theory relating to sonnets. Studying sonnets that are variously inspiring, devastating, and lol funny, we will become Sonnet Experts, while developing broadly useful skills in careful reading, concise writing and sound argumentation. Poets will include Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Keats, Elizabeth Barret Browning, DG and Christina Rossetti, Claude McKay, Edna St. Vincent Millay, John Berryman, Seamus Heaney, Vikram Seth, and many, many more. No prior experience with poetry is presumed. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Alison Case\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 133 SEM Shakespeare's Uncertain Ends\n\nLast offered Fall 2018\n\nWe've come to expect that the heroes of Shakespeare's tragedies learn something. Othello, Lear, Hamlet, Macbeth, and all the others, are supposed to achieve some kind of clarifying self-knowledge as a reward for their terrible suffering. After all, the heroes' flaws are revealed and their delusions are exposed so that they can eventually understand what has happened to them and why. They are meant to learn from their suffering. Or so we'd like to think. But the plays don't always cooperate with our desire for some compensating enlightenment. We don't always come away with a clear sense that Shakespeare's tragic heroes have arrived at a true self-recognition; in other words, they don't always fully grasp how their fate is implicated in their character. Nor are we granted an obvious, edifying moral to compensate for the misery we witness. What, then, do we discover at the end of a Shakespeare tragedy? [ more ]\n\nENGL 135 SEM Vengeance\n\nLast offered Fall 2017\n\nFor almost three thousand years revenge has been a central preoccupation of European literature. Revenge is inviting to literary and dramatic treatment partly because of its impulse towards structure: it traces a simple arc of injury and retaliation. A injures B, and B retaliates against A. But retaliation is never easy or equivalent, and there is always a volatile emotive mixture of loss and grievance that stirs up ethical ambiguities that are seldom resolved. Vengeance also fascinates because it is so paradoxical. The avenger, though isolated and vulnerable, can nevertheless achieve heroic grandeur by coming to personify nemesis. And yet the hero is always contaminated by trying to make a right out of two wrongs--and he usually has to die for it. Driven by past events, cut off from the present, and wrapped up in stratagems for future reprisals, the avenger's actions are almost always compromised by impotence or excess. At best, revenge is \"a kinde of Wilde Justice\"--a justice that kills its heroes as well as its villains. We will look at as many stories of vengeance, across as wide a range of cultures and media, as possible. Readings will include Sophocles' Electra, Dante's Inferno, Shakespeare's Hamlet and The Tempest, Chalderon de Laclos' Dangerous Liaisons, and Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, as well as several short stories and films. [ more ]\n\nENGL 138(S) SEM What is a Self? Investigations in Literature, Philosophy, and Psychology\n\nThe experience of having a self (or a subjective point of view) informs and colors literally everything we think, see, and feel. And yet what is a self? Is it the unchanging essence of who we are as individuals? Or is it the historically contingent product of ever-changing cultural and political forces (like the media, gender norms, and ideologies about race, to name just a few)? Or, perhaps, is the belief that we have a self just one big illusion, as the Buddha suggested millennia ago and as modern philosophers and scientists have argued in their own different ways more recently? In this class, we'll explore the deep mystery of human existence that we call \"the self\" or \"subjectivity,\" looking at various attempts to capture, represent, and explain it (even escape it!). Our investigations will be wide-ranging, looking at examples from literature, philosophy, religion, and psychology. Works we'll study include: Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried, Toni Morrison's Beloved, and theoretical writings on the self by Plato, Thoreau, and Jean-Paul Sartre among others. We'll even try our hand at meditation, while learning about the Buddhist idea of \"no self.\" Students who genuinely find the experience of the self puzzling and fascinating will get the most out of this class. Bring an open mind about what it is to have a mind in the first place. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Bernard Rhie\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 139 SEM Living a Feminist Life\n\nLast offered Spring 2020\n\nThe course invites students to consider the range of ways in which \"knowledge\" about women's, femme's and non-binary lives has been constructed in text, and how this knowledge determines and impacts the we have and make. The first half of the course is organized around a deep reading of Sara Ahmed's recent theoretical book, Living a Feminist Life, while the second half of the course will examine a spectrum of women's life writing-poetry, music, journalism, theory, and memoir-to discover how text continues to shape feminist lives, and how femmes' lived experience in turn shapes feminist discourse. Course materials for the second half of the semester will be generated in part through discussion and students' suggestions. Key texts will include Jamaica Kincaid's A Small Place, Audre Lorde's Sister Outsider, Djamila Boupacha's memoir, Ana Lily Amirpour's film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, Sara Ahmed's Living a Feminist Life, Valerie Solanas's SCUM Manifesto, and bell hooks's Teaching to Transgress. In their writing for this course, students will consider how their own intimate relationships-with parents, partners, children, neighbors, or friends-can become sites of feminist activism, and sources of strength and knowledge to be carried into the broader world of public engagement and intervention. In the final weeks of the course, we will collectively interrogate the (false) boundary between writing and living as modes of feminist praxis. [ more ]\n\nENGL 140 SEM Introduction to Creative Writing: The Short Story\n\nLast offered Fall 2021\n\nThis course introduces students to the art of fiction writing through the crafting of short stories. Students sharpen their tastes and inclinations by reading and responding to short stories from significant contributors to the form. The writing exercises and overall course trajectory are designed to build a writing community in order to facilitate a better understanding of students' own writing processes. Individual conferences with the instructor are a central part of the course. [ more ]\n\nENGL 146 SEM Campus Life: The University and the Novel\n\nLast offered Spring 2018\n\nWhat is college for? To a significant number of writers from roughly 1945 onward, one answer seemed to be: college is the perfect setting for a novel! The Campus Novel, as it is known, mines the rich, frequently zany dramatic terrain that emerges when large groups of young people try to live and learn together in a closed environment. Filled with the absurdities of academic and collegiate life, the scholarly and sexual intrigues of the college campus, Campus Novels also are microsociologies of college: not just reflections of, but reflections upon, the institutional contexts of the American university. This course will introduce students to the Campus Novel (and its cousin, the Campus Movie), as a way to explore the history and meaning of liberal arts education in the American University from roughly the post-World War II emergence of mass higher education through co-education, multiculturalism, and the rise of the corporate university. Fictional lab reports upon experiments in living, works dedicated to figuring out what and whom a liberal arts education is for, these novels will be our own guides to an exploration of these questions. Likely texts: Amis, Lucky Jim, McCarthy, The Groves of Academe, Delillo, White Noise, Donna Tartt, The Secret History, Zadie Smith, On Beauty, Dave Eggers, The Circle, and films such as Breaking Away, School Daze, and The Social Network. [ more ]\n\nENGL 149 SEM First-Hand America\n\nLast offered Fall 2016\n\nGonzo journalism, the nonfiction novel, literary journalism, the \"new new journalism\": the study of American culture has thrived in the able hands of writers, reformers and amateur anthropologists. This course is an introduction to American writing and culture through the eyes of extraordinary witnesses who work as public intellectuals, addressing a readership that reaches beyond the university. Through essays, films and music we will track the documentary impulse from coast to coast: from Ferguson, Baltimore, Miami, Watts, Denver, Harlem, Chicago, Compton and Sing-Sing prison to the wilds of Alaska and rural Georgia; from mass demonstrations to the most intimate, bedside revelations. How have writers and artists given their audiences tools for understanding power, privilege, and difference in America? [ more ]\n\nENGL 150(F, S) SEM Expository Writing\n\nWriting clearly is the most important skill you can learn in college. Do you suffer from writer's block? Do you receive consistent criticism of your writing without also learning strategies for how to improve? This course is for students who want to learn how to write a well-argued, intelligible essay that offers a complex interpretive argument based on close, critical analysis of texts. We will derive our method for mastering the complex art of writing from Atul Gawande's bestselling book, The Checklist Manifesto. In addition to sharpening your skills in reading, note-taking and literary analysis, this class will give you tools for generating drafts, peer editing, revising, and polishing your writing. The readings for this course will be literary works, scholarly essays and nonfiction -- mostly contemporary, and mostly American. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Cassandra Cleghorn\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 151 SEM Lying About the Truth: Writing about Autobiographical Writing\n\nLast offered Fall 2023\n\nThe goal of this course is to teach you how to write a clear, well-argued, intelligible and interesting analytical paper. We will spend most of our class time actively engaged in a variety of techniques to improve your critical reasoning and analytical skills, both written and oral. Though the skills you learn will be applicable to other disciplines, and a central purpose of the course is to improve all aspects of your writing, this is a literature class, designed partly to prepare you for upper level courses in the English Department, so we will, therefore, spend equal time on the interpretation of literature, in this case, contemporary American autobiographical fiction. All readers fall prey to it: the autobiographical fallacy--the conflation of author and narrator. Writers know readers are susceptible to it. A course designed to explore the uses and abuses of the autobiographical fallacy by contemporary American authors. How do writers of autobiographical fiction take advantage of this tendency? What role does the autobiographical play in a writer's authority? What's the relationship between reader and writer in autobiographical writing? What do writers of such fiction want from a reader, and how does encouraging the autobiographical fallacy get them what they want? Reading list may include: Tim O'Brien, Yiyun Li, Junot Diaz, ZZ Packer, Lorrie Moore, Amy Hempel, Nam Le, Dorothy Allison, Ocean Vuong. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Karen Shepard\n\nCatalog details\n\nENGL 152 SEM Family Matters: Family in Recent American Fiction\n\nLast offered Fall 2021\n\n\"Anyone who has survived childhood has enough material to write for the rest of his or her life\" (Flannery O'Connor). A course designed to explore the representations of family in recent American literature. Family is our first community, and in the literature of family one commonly accepted convention emerges: family members are morally bound to one another. These bonds of blood, both liberating and limiting, have always been a literary convention. In this course, we will examine recent American fiction that explores such bonds. What do such narratives claim we want from our families? What do such narratives claim we're willing to do to get it? Have recent narratives developed particular and characteristic strategies for approaching this topic? And are there importantly particularizing aspects of the American family? The goal of this course is to teach you how to write a clear, well-argued, and interesting analytical paper. We will spend most of our class time actively engaged in a variety of techniques to improve your critical reasoning and analytical skills, both written and oral. Though the skills you learn will be applicable to other disciplines, and a central purpose of the course is to improve all aspects of your writing, this is a literature class, designed partly to prepare you for upper level courses in the English Department, so we will, therefore, spend equal time on the interpretation of literature. Authors to be considered may include: Kali Fajardo-Anstine, Danielle Evans, Rick Moody, Junot Diaz, Amy Hempel, ZZ Packer, Lorrie Moore, Gish Jen, Cormac McCarthy, Edward Jones, among others. [ more ]\n\nENGL 153(S) SEM Androids, Cyborgs, Selves\n\nIn this expository writing course, we will analyze and argue about how humanoid and partly human bodies appear in legend, fiction, and film. When are these bodies inviting? When are they threatening? How are they gendered, how are they raced, and why? Which technologies fit easily into human forms, and which are resistant? What do the persons who inhabit these near-human bodies desire? Students in this course will develop arguments in reply to these and related questions, developing 3 or 4 essays through multiple stages of planning, drafting, and revising. Because this is an expository writing seminar, we will spend half or more of our class time discussing and practicing writing skills.

Among the questions we'll be taking up: What are the outer boundaries of those imaginative acts that should be attempted? The central goal of this course is to teach you how to write a well-argued and interesting analytical paper. We will spend most of our class time actively engaged in a variety of techniques to improve your critical reasoning and analytical skills, both written and oral. Though the skills you learn will be applicable to other disciplines, this is also a literature class, designed as well to prepare you for upper level courses in the English Department.

We will focus on feature-length films, documentaries, and short films that not only grapple with Mexican history and identity but also those that travel beyond the borders of Mexico. The list of directors whose work will be considered includes Natalia Beristáin, Alfonso Cuarón, Jonás Cuarón, Guillermo del Toro, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Alejandra Márquez Abella, Kenya Márquez, Jorge Pérez Solano, and Patricia Riggen.

We will spend most of our class time actively engaged in a variety of techniques to improve your critical reasoning and analytical skills, both written and oral. Though the skills you learn will be applicable to other disciplines, and a central purpose of the course is to improve all aspects of your writing, this is a literature class, designed partly to prepare you for upper level courses in the English Department, so we will, therefore, spend equal time on the interpretation of literature, in this case, contemporary American fiction, examining the very, very recent (last thirty years) developments in American fiction. We will read short stories and novels by writers such as Danielle Evans, George Saunders, Kali Fajardo-Anstine, Mary Robison, Karen Russell, ZZ Packer, Ocean Vuong, Yiyun Li, among others.

Over the course of the semester, as we wind our way through the underworld, we will consider the circumstances of the damned, their guilt, their punishments, and the overall aims of Dante's extraordinary vision. How and why are the condemned sentenced to an eternal afterlife in this underground kingdom of cruelty? What are we to make of the poem's humor and malevolence, and how are we to understand its vast architecture? In writing about the fate of these sins and sinners we will focus on techniques to improve your critical reasoning and analytical skills with the goal of writing interesting and well-argued essays. Students will receive from the instructor timely comments on their writing skills, with suggestions for improvement. [ more ]\n\nENGL 158 SEM Expository Writing: Contemporary Linked Stories\n\nLast offered Fall 2022\n\nIn this expository writing and writing intensive course, we will read and write about several collections of linked short stories about altered states of mind and body, immigrant experiences, and the magic of everyday life. We will examine linked stories as a form organizing narratives that can stand alone, but that resonate powerfully with one another, sharing themes, settings, and sometimes even characters. Texts may include Denis Johnson's Jesus' Son, Bryan Washington's Lot, Carmen Maria Machado's Her Body and Other Parties, and Alice Munro's Juliet stories. Class time will be split nearly equally between analysis of the assigned texts and active work with student writing, including freewriting, rewriting, sentence and paragraph workshops, peer editing, and writing strategy sessions.

We will spend most of our class time actively engaged in a variety of techniques to improve your critical reasoning and analytical skills, both written and oral. Though the skills you learn will be applicable to other disciplines, and a central purpose of the course is to improve all aspects of your writing, this is a literature class, designed partly to prepare you for upper level courses in the English Department, so we will, therefore, spend equal time on the interpretation of literature, in this case, contemporary American memoir, examining the ways in which recent American memoirists represent themselves through prose and the choices they make in shaping their life stories. Given the techniques shared by novelists and memoirists, how firm is the line between fiction and non-fiction? What are the sources of a memoirist's authority? What are the ethics of memoir-writing? What kind of relationships do memoirists seek with their readers, and how do they go about achieving them?

We'll look at the formal pleasures and puzzles generated by techniques including frame narratives, recursion, and self-reference, in novels, films, and stories by Vladimir Nabokov, Jorge Luis Borges, Kelly Link, Paul Park, and others. Ultimately, we will use our study of metafiction to focus inquiry into the socializing force of self-consciousness in human development. Note that students will be required to use, as well as interpret, metafictional techniques in their assigned writing, and will write one or two essays in collaboration with a Chat AI.

This course explores our persistent interest in human simulacra (robots, puppets, dolls; but also automata and cyborgs) and what they suggest about human identity, independence, and free will. We'll look at a wide range of simulacra as they appear in literature, film, and, increasingly, in the actual world (\"reborn\" dolls, therapy robots, AI). We will frame our explorations with readings in artificial intelligence, neurology, and psychoanalysis (Freud on the uncanny; Winnicott on transitional objects). Throughout, we will wonder: why this fascination with the almost living? How is it that we often care more for Wall-E or the Velveteen Rabbit than we do for real people?

In this course, we will become acquainted with Shakespeare's major works, but we will also remain alert to their capacity to confound. Serious attention will be given to genre, form, the historical conditions of the Renaissance theater and book trade, modes of literary transmission, and the shape of Shakespeare's career. Plays will include A Midsummer Night's Dream, Romeo and Juliet, Henry IV, Part I, Hamlet, King Lear, Antony and Cleopatra, and The Tempest. We will also read the Sonnets. The course is designed to offer a first encounter with Shakespeare, but more advanced students are welcome too. [ more ]\n\nENGL 202(S) SEM Modern Drama\n\nAn introduction to major plays and key movements in European and American theatre since the late nineteenth century. Our focus will be on close reading, with attention also to questions of performance and production. Plays to be discussed will likely include: Ibsen, Hedda Gabler; Wilde, The Importance of Being Earnest; Chekhov, The Cherry Orchard; Pirandello, Six Characters in Search of an Author; Brecht, Mother Courage; Miller, Death of a Salesman; Beckett, Waiting for Godot; Hansberry, A Raisin in the Sun; Pinter, Betrayal; Churchill, Cloud Nine; Stoppard, Arcadia.

In this course we will read several of the plays and look at some of the ways they have been re-imagined and restaged. We will consider the origin of the plays as popular entertainment--competing for an audience against bear-baitings and public executions. We will consider their transformation into canonical texts and their de-canonization in parodies like Dogg's Hamlet and Drunk Shakespeare. Among the works we will read and watch are Twelfth Night, Shakespeare Behind Bars, Hamlet, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Undead, The Merchant of Venice, To Be or Not to Be. Assignments will include analytical essays and creative adaptations in a variety of media.

We'll examine both the characteristic pleasures provided by Hollywood's dominant genres--including action films, horror films, thrillers and romantic comedies--and the complex, sometimes unsavory fantasies they mobilize. We will do this by looking carefully at a dozen or so iconic films, probably including Psycho, Casablanca, The Godfather; Schindler's List, Bridesmaids, Groundhog Day, 12 Years a Slave and Get Out.

If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry. These are the only way I know it. Is there any other way?\" This excerpt from a letter by Emily Dickinson indicates both the particular pleasures of reading poetry, and also the persistent difficulty of defining poetry as a genre. In this course, we will train our focus on lyric poetry in particular, tracing its long history as well as trends in the theory of lyric. We'll begin by uncovering the roots of lyric in antiquity before shifting our focus to the development of lyric in English. We'll read closely the work of such poets as Wyatt, Donne, Wordsworth, Keats, Hopkins, and Dickinson before turning to questions of lyric in the 20th and 21st centuries. Along the way, we'll examine the trends in criticism responsible for the conflation of lyric and poetry in our time, and will get a strong sense of the current state of lyric theory. [ more ]\n\nENGL 206 TUT Beyond the Tiger Mom: Depictions of East Asian Mothers in Contemporary American Literature\n\nLast offered Spring 2024\n\nA tutorial designed to explore the interpretative difficulties and possibilities of East Asian mothers and motherhood in contemporary American literature (fiction and memoir). The \"Tiger Mom\"--highly controlling, strict, severe almost to the point of abuse--has become the go-to phrase for many Americans when referring to traditional East Asian mothering styles. This attempt to categorize and simplify cultural differences fails to capture the complex nature of East Asian mothering. While the American public imagines East Asian parenting as only unwavering and harsh, immigrant parents, for example, must often find a parenting strategy that bridges traditional East Asian and mainstream American norms. This course will explore the ways that contemporary Asian American authors depict the complexity of East Asian mothering and mothers. What kinds of mothering does the reductive category of Tiger Mom ignore? What are the central questions these authors pose about mothers and motherhood? How do they negotiate the tension between the individual versus the community, or the pursuit of the child's own interests as opposed to success as defined by the parent when it comes to that child's future? And what are the pitfalls of reading literature as social science? In keeping with tutorial format, students will meet in pairs with the instructor once a week; during these meetings, one student will present a short analytical paper on the texts covered that week. The other student will write a response paper and join the instructor in a discussion of both papers. The reading list may include work by Ocean Vuong, Yiyun Li, Michelle Zauner, Celeste Ng, Amy Tan, Jessamine Chan, Maxine Hong Kingston, Alice Sola Kim, and Amy Chua, among others.

And why does comedy often deal with topics that we think are no laughing matters? When we respond to comedy, whom are we laughing with, and whom are we laughing at? When does comedy become obsolete, and how do new comedic voices and figures emerge? How do old comedies find new audiences, and when they do, does that reflect a deep continuity between the context of its making and that of its reception? Or, can comedies leave their origins behind and find new meaning in radically different historical contexts? Answers to these questions differ wildly across comedies. In this course, we will look at comedies from various historical periods (ancient to contemporary), cultural traditions, and artforms (drama, fiction, film, stand-up). We will study their conventions, plots, props, jokes, and running gags (both physical and verbal). At times, we will try to approach the comedies from the inside by recreating some of its effects and come to understand how they are made. A variety of critical theories that will help us consider comedy's connections to embodiment, ritual, sexuality, history, and racial difference. We will engage with comedic works by William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, Richard Pryor, and Cheryl Dunye. Alongside the comedic works we will engage with the social and aesthetic theories of Anne Carson, Northrop Frye, Sigmund Freud, Susan Sontag, and Saidiya Hartman.

The mapping of the human genome in 2001 opened incredible opportunities for medicine, law, and society, but it also, as Alice Wexler has written, \"opened a vast arena for contests of power over what it means to be human, who has the power to define what is normal, [and] who has access to what resources and when.\" Wexler was writing before the final sequencing of the human genome. Now we have CRISPR technology, ushering in a new, more pressing set of ethical concerns. We are currently in the midst of a \"global race to genetically modify humans,\" as the anthropologist Eben Kirksey has documented in his new book The Mutant Project. How will we come to define the human? Who gets to decide? Our writers and filmmakers make clear that genetic medicine cannot be thought apart from a profit-driven American health care system or family and gender dynamics. Joanna Rudnick's documentary In the Family, for instance, explores the personal and political issues associated with hereditary breast cancer and the patenting of genes. Octavia Butler's Afro-futurist novel Dawn explores black female sexuality, reproduction, and the survival of the species in her character's encounter with a genetically enhanced alien species. The film Gattaca shows us a fully realized dystopian society where genetically modified humans are the norm--a society that now \"has discrimination down to a science.\" The transgender artist Tamara Pertamina, on the other hand, \"hopes to decolonize the science of genetic engineering,\" as Kirksey has written, with her performance artist projects. Our texts come from a number of different genres, including the memoir, science fiction, film, documentary, art, and non-fiction writing at the intersections of science, medicine, philosophy, anthropology, and law.

What can you figure out by examining language that you can't figure out by studying history or psychology? Do students of literature have distinctive ways of asking questions about the world? Why do we call some language literary? Can any language be literary if it appears in the right kind of book? Is there a difference between verbal forms of art and visual or auditory ones? Can novels do things that plays and poetry cannot? Why does anyone read poetry anyway?

Texts in the course run from the familiar (Cather, Fitzgerald, Hemingway) through the difficult (Faulkner), very difficult (Jean Toomer), and impossible (Gertrude Stein); but we'll learn how to read them all. Even the familiar texts turn out to be stylistically experimental, and experiments in style, in every case, are linked to novel conceptions of religion (especially Hemingway, Fitzgerald), race or ethnicity (Faulkner, Toomer), and gender (Cather, Hemingway, Stein); most of our texts interrelate all of these concerns. After the Great War, the urgency of questions of form, in relation to questions of identity, is whether the world can be redeemed by the reformation of linguistic and generic conventions. [ more ]\n\nENGL 213 SEM Making Radio\n\nLast offered Spring 2023\n\nThis course has two aims. The first is to teach the necessary skills (including interview technique, field recording, editing, and scoring) to make broadcast-worthy audio nonfiction. The second is to use this process to investigate fundamental aspects of narrative. How does a story build a contract with listeners? What's the role of the narrator? How can one appropriately speak for (and sometimes against) another person? This is less a course in journalism than an experiment in documentary cinema for the ear. We'll do some reading in narrative theory and radio technique, and will listen to exemplary works (including episodes of This American Life, RadioLab, Love and Radio, and Snap Judgment), but most of our time--and this is a time-consuming course--will be spent making and critiquing each other's pieces. Students will produce five or six pieces total, at least two of which must develop out of interviews with strangers.

Students should expect to write most days. Our focus will be on the fundamentals of story, and the cultivation of each writer's individual voice. In addition to reading existing dramatic texts of various genres and forms, and completing weekly prompts and exercises exploring character, dialogue, structure, theme, conflict and world building, students will work toward a longer final project. Students will present their own work regularly, and respond to each other's work. The course will culminate in a staged reading of excerpts for the campus community. [ more ]\n\nENGL 215(S) SEM Introduction to Asian American Literature\n\nThis course will provide an introduction to some of the major works of Asian American literature, from the mid-20th century to the present. Throughout, we'll attend to the intersection of aesthetics and politics, exploring the creative ways Asian American literary texts both reflect and respond to the historical forces that have shaped Asian American experiences and identities, including exclusion, internment, and U.S. wars and imperialism in Asia. Works we're likely to read include: John Okada's No-No Boy, Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Dictee, Jessica Hagedorn's Dogeaters, lê thj diem thúy's The Gangster We Are All Looking For, and Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies.

This course, part lecture and part seminar, will stage encounters with 7 or 8 novels, each the product of a distinct configuration of subject position, history, form, and ambition. We will move from the English novel's beginnings through (at least) the late 20th century, when novels competed for cultural space with new storytelling modes. Along the way we will think about what stories are for, generally; why this kind of long-form storytelling was invented; and what cultural work English-language novels do, have done, and may yet do. Possible writers to be studied include Samuel Richardson, Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Dickens, Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Vladimir Nabokov, Toni Morrison, Salman Rushdie, and Zadie Smith. [ more ]\n\nENGL 217 SEM Experimental Asian American Writing\n\nLast offered Spring 2015\n\nAsian American literature did not begin in the 1980s with Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club. Nor has the writing primarily been confined to autobiographical accounts of generational conflict, divided identities, and glimpses of Chinatown families. Asian American literature in English began with poetry in the late nineteenth century, and has encompassed a variety of aesthetic styles across the last century--from Modernism to New York School poetry to protest poetry to digital poetics. This course will explore Asian American writings that have pushed formal (and political) boundaries in the past 100+ years, with a particular focus on avant-garde writers working today. We will look at such authors as Jose Garcia Villa, Chuang Hua, Wong May, Theresa H., Cha, John Yau, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Tan Lin, Prageeta Sharma, Bhanu Kapil, and Tao Lin. [ more ]\n\nENGL 220 SEM Introduction to African American Literature\n\nLast offered Spring 2023\n\nWhat does it mean, socially, culturally, historically, personally, and spiritually, to be African American? No single, simple answer suffices, but African American literature as a genre is defined by its ongoing engagement with this complex question. This course will examine a series of texts that in various ways epitomize the fraught literary grappling with the entailments of American blackness. Readings will include texts by Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Amiri Baraka, Toni Morrison, and Ishmael Reed.

Hip hop music producers have long practiced \"diggin' in the crates\"--a phrase that denotes searching through record collections to find material to sample. In this course, we will examine the material and technological history of hip hop culture, with particular attention to hip hop's tendency to sample, remix, mash-up, and repurpose existing media artifacts to create new works or art. We will use a media archaeological approach to examine the precise material conditions that first gave rise to graffiti art, deejaying, rapping, and breakdancing, and to analyze hip hop songs, videos, and films. Media archaeology is a critical and artistic practice that seeks to interpret the layers of significance embedded in cultural artifacts. How does hip hop archaeology remix the past, the present, and the future? How do the historical, political, and cultural coding of hip hop artifacts change as they increasingly become part of institutional collections, from newly established hip hop archives at Cornell and Harvard to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture?

Our focus will be on lyrics--relatively short poems in which a single speaker describes (often in intense language) his or her emotions, attitudes, or state of mind. Our readings will be drawn from a range of historical periods from the seventeenth century forward, with particular emphasis on poems written since the mid-nineteenth century. Among the poets we are likely to study: Ben Jonson, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Dickinson, Hardy, Owen, Yeats, Auden, Frost, Gluck, and Heaney. We will also discuss works by two poets at Williams: Lawrence Raab and Jessica Fisher.

Tracing the history of Poetry of Witness throughout the 20th and 21st Centuries, this course explore various strategies poets have used to write about the end of the world, however that may be defined. We will read contemporary poets (such as Danez Smith, Ilya Kaminsky, Aracelis Girmay, and Solmaz Sharif) alongside 20th Century writers who were responding to the catastrophes of their own times (Paul Celan, Pablo Neruda, Gwendolyn Brooks, Bei Dao, and others). Looking backward to other times when the world seemed to be ending, this course will examine some of the strategies that poets have used to navigate writing about war, genocide, forced migration, gendered violence, climate crisis, and other dystopias. The readings we encounter will span various schools and poetic forms, from documentary poetics, to surrealism and the avant garde, to the Black Arts Movement, to speculative writing, and so on. They will be supplemented with critical texts on the political stakes of writing and reading practices by thinkers like Eve Sedgwick, James Baldwin, and Audre Lorde. This is a course that views creative writing as a valid form of critical inquiry; therefore, students will have opportunities to engage creatively with texts throughout the semester. For the final, students will have the option of either writing an analytical paper or submitting a creative project with a critical introduction. [ more ]\n\nENGL 224 TUT American Drama: Hidden Knowledge\n\nLast offered Spring 2022\n\nThe Buddha is said to have identified three things that cannot stay hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth. What's the secret? Who is lying? Who is breaking the rules? American drama abounds with hidden knowledge and false representations. (This is not surprising: theatre is always on some level a deceptive practice, a place where one person pretends to be another, and where what is spoken is always open to skeptical scrutiny. We might say theatre is always lying as much as lying is always theatre.) This tutorial course will examine what lies hidden in American plays from the late nineteenth century to the early twenty-first. Beginning with excerpted critical and historical writings on secrecy and lying (The Adventures of Pinocchio, Machiavelli's The Prince, Thomas Carlson's Lying and Deception: Theory and Practice, among others), we will proceed to a set of American plays from across a wide spectrum of playwrights, including Eugene O'Neill, Edward Albee, Sarah Ruhl, Arthur Miller, Amy Herzog, Susan Glaspell, Sophie Treadwell, Annie Baker, and others. Student papers will explore how hidden knowledge structures dramatic action, how different characters create and respond to untruths, and what can we learn in particular from American drama about a national relationship to honesty and its opposites. [ more ]\n\nENGL 225 Introduction to Asian American Literature: Fiction and Memoir\n\nLast offered NA\n\nThis Gateway is for students who want an opportunity to explore some of the wonderful fiction and creative nonfiction written by Asian American writers over the past hundred years. Likely readings include: Carlos Bulosan's America is in the Heart (1946); John Okada's No-No Boy (1957); Maxine Hong Kingston's Woman Warrior (1976); Chang-rae Lee's Native Speaker (1995); Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies (1999); lê thi diem thúy's The Gangster We are All Looking For (2003); Ruth Ozeki's A Tale for the Time Being (2013); and Celeste Ng's Everything I Never Told You (2014). As we read, we will attend to the various ways in which the often difficult, and sometimes traumatic, historical experiences of Asian Americans have informed their acts of literary invention. And in order to better understand the broader, ever shifting, social contexts in and against which these literary works were created, we will supplement our primary readings with texts that discuss the experiences of Asian Americans from a historical and sociological perspective.

Yeats and James Joyce achieved international renown. Readings will include drama, poetry, fiction and non-fiction prose by Yeats, J.M. Synge, Joyce, George Moore, George Bernard Shaw, Lady Gregory, Douglas Hyde, Sean O'Casey and others. We will foreground key fault-lines of the period: competing visions of what constituted \"authentic\" Irish identity; debate over the propriety of writing in English, drawing on British literary traditions, or seeking a non-Irish audience; the work of \"self-exiles\" such as Shaw and Joyce, versus that of writers who stayed in Ireland; and the long-entrenched political tensions between Catholics and Protestants, and Unionists and Nationalists. Throughout, we will consider the functions and efficacy of literature in promoting cultural or political change. The course will conclude by considering the extraordinary vitality of post-independence and contemporary Irish literary culture, with readings of work by Seamus Heaney, Colm Toíbín, Anne Enright and Martin McDonagh, and discussion of recent Irish film. Key considerations here will be the ways traditional notions of Irish Nationalism and national identity have been revised or abandoned under the impact of independence, economic prosperity and globalization, contemporary sexual politics and other forms of change. [ more ]\n\nENGL 227 TUT Elegies\n\nLast offered Fall 2023\n\nThis tutorial explores elegies as a literary genre. In their most familiar form, elegies honor and memorialize the dead. More broadly conceived, the genre includes works lamenting other kinds of loss as well: the loss of a lover, place, country, or cherished version of one's past. We'll consider the special challenges and opportunities of the elegiac voice: how it manages to give public expression to private grief; negotiates problems of tone and perspective; worries about and celebrates the capacity of language to generate hope and consolation; and seeks a kind of solace in the literary effort to evoke, preserve, or rewrite a lost life or an absent past. This course focuses primarily on poetry, English and American, across a broad historical range. We'll first read poems from 1600-1900--including works by Jonson, Milton, Donne, Dryden, Gray, Shelley, Tennyson, and Whitman, and then turn to some of the twentieth-century's great poetic elegists--Wilfred Owen, W.B.Yeats, W.H.Auden, Robert Lowell, and Seamus Heaney. Finally, we'll consider how the elegiac voice works in fiction, especially in stories by James Joyce (\"The Dead\") and Vladimir Nabokov (\"Spring in Fialta\").

In this interdisciplinary course, we will consider these two developments both separately and together. As Renaissance humanists were acquiring a sophisticated understanding of the distance between the present and various European pasts (the recent medieval past and the remote history of antiquity), they were also coming into contact with non-European cultures in Africa, the Americas, and Asia via trade and economic development, imperial expansion, and religious conversion. Always at stake in these encounters was the question of who counted as an individual; the self was not considered to be intrinsic to human nature but rather the product of historical and cultural developments. Themes will include religious pluralism, the sacred and the secular, vernacularity, exploration and empire, the relationship between mind and body, slavery, trade, wealth, gender, self-fashioning, and style. We will consider such English writers as the Pearl poet, More, Marlowe, Spenser, Shakespeare, Browne, and Milton; such continental intellectuals as Descartes, Erasmus, Las Casas, and Castiglione; and such continental artists as Michelangelo, Velázquez, Bruegel, and Rembrandt.

Could John Cheever's \"The Enormous Radio\" really be contemporary? Is James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room American in the same way as Alice Munro's Dear Life? And is Michelle Tea's Black Wave fiction or something else? Along the way, we'll also ask: What forms and themes define contemporary American fiction? And why should we invest in defining the \"contemporary\" period at all? Other authors we will study may include: Raymond Carver, Thomas Pynchon, Toni Morrison, Renata Adler, Margaret Atwood, Lydia Davis, Chang Rae Lee, Jennifer Egan, and Colson Whitehead. [ more ]\n\nENGL 230 SEM Introduction to Literary Theory\n\nLast offered Fall 2019\n\nThis course introduces students to some of the most significant and compelling trends in modern criticism-such as gender and postcolonial theory, deconstruction, sociological analysis, and psychoanalytic criticism-in an applied, hands-on way. The course will engage a range of primary texts from Shakespeare to Hitchcock by way of varied theoretical approaches. Can Othello , for instance, be read as a feminist text? A site of class struggle? A staging of the relationship between language and the unconscious? The course aims both to make familiar some of the critical methods students are likely to encounter in the field of literary studies these days, and to show how such methods can transform our understanding of a text, opening surprising possibilities even in familiar works. In the process, the course will also raise broader questions about the imperatives and usefulness of literary theory in relation to texts and worlds. [ more ]\n\nENGL 231(F, S) SEM Literature of the Sea\n\nThe ocean, and human relationships with it, have been central features of literatures and cultures around the world for more than a thousand years. But since literary study is typically based around authors' homelands, careful examination of the oceanic experience is often pushed to the periphery--an \"empty space\" to be crossed between nations, a \"vast darkness\" antithetical to human life, or a mirror for land-borne concerns. Increasingly, however, scholars and readers are centering the sea and stories about it as a means stepping outside human frameworks of space and time, situating the complex emotions and narratives inspired by the ocean into a complex network of geologic history and teeming other-than-human life. This course examines a wide range of texts and perspectives on the ocean and human relationships with it. Doing so will help us consider how literature both plays into and subverts dominant viewpoints of the ocean. Through texts that consider 19th-century whaling, the Middle Passage, the postcolonial Caribbean, and islands throughout the Pacific Ocean, we will explore a range of questions, including: What can we learn from examining efforts to write about the ocean? How do ocean stories help individuals understand themselves, their communities, and their place in global environments? What can the range of cultural and literary perspectives on our \"single, global ocean\" reveal about the ways different people are both connected with and profoundly distant from each other? Most importantly, we will practice, as a classroom community, different strategies for carefully reading texts while connecting them to cultural traditions, surrounding environments, and personal experiences.

Centering the goals of liberation is at the heart of the issue\" (Jarrett Drake, former digital archivist at Mudd Manuscript Library, Princeton University). In this generative writing and critical-practice course, students examine the concept of archives through the lens of democratic ideals. A primary focus is on how Latinidades and works of Global South literatures engage archives--their creation and deletions, their contents and omissions, their revelations and concealments. Drawing from the values explored in class, students have opportunities to contribute to existing archival collections and/or to curate their own.

This course takes time to enjoy the special pleasures of novels of epic scope: the opportunity to immerse oneself in a wide and teeming fictional world; to focus sustained attention on the changeable fortunes of characters and societies over a long span of time; to appreciate the detailed grounding of lives in their social environment and historical moment; to experience the leisurely and urgent rhythms, with their elaborate patterning of build-ups and climaxes, that are possible in such works. We will read but two novels, both preoccupied with the disruption and evolution of lives and loves at moments of historic upheaval: War and Peace (1869), Leo Tolstoy's epic of the Napoleonic Wars, and Parade's End (1924-28), Ford Madox Ford's modernist masterpiece about World War I and its traumatic impact on English social life. Set a century apart, the novels are distinguished by vivid and scrupulous representation of their respective wars, by their shrewd accounts of political and social pressures informing the crises, and by their insight into the struggles of those whose lives are engulfed in global crisis. Tolstoy's and Ford's approaches to fictional representation, however, provide intriguing contrasts: one favors the lucidity of classic realism, the other the challenges of modernist innovation; one deploys a single multiplot novel, the other a tetralogy of shorter novels developing a single plot. We will discuss the differing strategies and effects of these two approaches, as well as the more general difficulties of reading and interpreting long fiction.

Fewer still have had the opportunity to think with the medium, exploiting the resources of film and video in an effort to understand how these media affect viewers. The Video Essay offers a chance to do that. After being introduced to the fundamentals of film analysis and receiving training in basic video editing, students will spend the term alternating between making short video essays and commenting on the essays produced by their partners. Note that this is primarily a course in film analysis: students will not shoot any original material. No prior experience is required.

This tutorial offers an exploration of the most notable theatre artists from the past and present. Students will select a specific master with a unique theatrical style, and will study that iconic artist's particular method or approach. Students will be encouraged to choose any master who had made a significant contribution to theatre -- such as Constantine Stanislavsky, Stella Adler, Sanford Meisner, Lee Strasberg, Bertolt Brecht, Michael Chekhov, Jerzy Grotowski, Tadeusz Kantor, Pina Bausch, Tadashi Suzuki, Anne Bogart, etc. Each student will conclude their exploration by writing a script and presenting the essence of their research in a brief performance (for the camera) -- portraying the legendary icon at work, in a social situation, or in solitude. You learn more about others when you become them, if only for a moment.

Revelations 21:21 It makes us happy to imagine the future in apocalyptic terms, partly because we love to say I told you so. You didn't listen, and now look. Fort Lee is on fire, and zombies are smashing down your parents' door. Catastrophe satisfies us on many levels; by contrast, the utopian vision provides a more delicate thrill. For a writer, the task is to provide a fiction that will not feel like a moral lesson or the illustration of some theory about how we should behave. This course will consider different utopian stories in a vaguely chronological sequence: Classical Era, Renaissance, Enlightenment, and then moving through the 19th and 20th centuries, and then into modern science fiction. You'd be right if you think this sounds as if I haven't yet finalized the list, but it will include familiar and unfamiliar names--Plato, More, Bacon, Campanella, Fourier, Bellamy, Skinner, LeGuin, Bisson, Kim Stanley Robinson, and various Afro-Futurists. Mostly you will be reading (or else listening to the instructor describe) excerpts and summaries rather than full texts, as utopian visions are often quite long and we want to consider large numbers of them. The emphasis in this class will be on writing rather than reading. Most assignments will consist of either sketching out or actually writing a short story set in one of these imagined worlds, a story that would serve as a critique. In addition, as a final project, students will invent a personal utopia and present it to the class. [ more ]\n\nENGL 237 SEM Making Things Visible: Adventures in Documentary Work\n\nLast offered Spring 2019\n\nPhotography, like ethnography, is an art of looking carefully and taking notice. This course will explore the overlaps between documentary photography and field methods of social science, concentrating particularly on the genre in which the two intersect: the photo essay. The students will learn methods of visual narrative and storytelling, using techniques of interviewing, still photography, and video. Concurrently, we will explore a number of examples of investigative work that blend word and image. We will ask questions about the changing practices and expectations associated with the documentarian's role, and the evolving media in which such work can be presented. Lastly, we will discuss ethical questions that haunt documentary work, including issues of responsibility and politics of representation, as well as the perennial question of whether \"objective representation\" is even possible or desirable. Experience in photography and/or video is not required, but students will be expected to master basic technical skills in image acquisition and audio editing taught in a separate lab section. Students should also be prepared to interact extensively with people in the community and spend a significant time off campus doing fieldwork. [ more ]\n\nENGL 238(F) SEM 1930s Black Literature\n\nThis course explores Black literary output of the 1930s in all its forms with the belief that this often under-appreciated decade contains many of the impulses that would come to structure the literary landscape in the decades that follow. These include an unflinching embrace of humor and satire, engagements with social realism, and a keen attention to notions of the radical in the international context. Special attention will be paid to how the writing pushes away from the development of what we have come to understand as the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. Work to be considered throughout the term comes from, among others, Marita Bonner, Arna Bontemps, Sterling Brown, Langston Hughes, Zora Neal Hurston, George Schuyler, Dorothy West, Richard Wright, and Octavia Wynbush. [ more ]\n\nENGL 239 LEC Zen and the Art of American Literature\n\nLast offered Spring 2023\n\nJust one hundred years ago, few Americans knew the first thing about Buddhism. But these days, who hasn't heard of (or even tried) mindfulness or meditation? Buddhist ideas and practices now seem ubiquitous, available even in the form of smartphone apps like Headspace and Calm. In this class, we'll explore how Buddhism came to be the profoundly important cultural force in American life that it is today. We'll read some Buddhist American literary texts, like Ruth Ozeki's wondrous novel, A Tale for the Time Being. And we'll range far beyond the world of literature into other cultural domains in which Buddhism has had a deep impact, like psychotherapy, environmentalism, Western attitudes towards death and dying, and the ongoing struggle for racial justice. And we'll engage in an experiential investigation of the benefits of incorporating contemplative practices like meditation into the classroom: students in the course will learn a variety of meditation techniques, and we'll spend time each class practicing and reflecting upon those practices. Students will be expected to meditate outside of class as well (2-3 times per week). No prior experience with meditation is necessary. Just an open mind.

This course is an introduction to the ways literary critics have attempted to give a genre as hard-to-pin down as the novel a theoretical framework. For a long time, nobody thought the novel even needed a theory--too popular, too loose and baggy to be thought of as any one thing. Today, novel theory is legion. To name a few, one can find theories of the novel that identify themselves as formalist, psychoanalytic, post-structuralist, Marxist, historical, and post-colonial, as well as accounts that emphasize sexuality and gender, for example, or the novel's trans-national development. We will move back and forth from the theory of the novel to its practice in order to see how the novel and its understanding have changed over the past 200 or so years. We'll center our studies in the Age of the Novel in Britain, the 19th century (Jane Austen, Charles Dickens), and extend our investigations to one of its contemporary heirs (Sally Rooney). Theorists will include Bakhtin, Benjamin, Marx, Lukacs, Barthes, Ian Watt, Jameson, Sedgwick, Said, Bersani, Moretti.

In this class, we will study English translations of texts from eras spanning the ancient to the contemporary; literary movements including romanticism, realism, and postmodernism; national traditions arising in Europe, Asia, and the Americas; and media from prose fiction to theater, comics, and film. Throughout the course, we will consider what it means to think about all these different works as literary texts. To help with this, we will also read selections of literary theory that define literature and its goal in abstract or philosophical terms. Assignments will focus on close, creative reading of relatively short texts by authors like Homer, Sei Shônagon, Kleist, Lermontov, Zola, Borges, Wilde, Bechdel, and others. All readings will be in English.

These articulations of knowing and unknowing, of telling and untelling, continue to thread their way into U.S. poetry today. This course will explore bewilderment as both a poetic strategy and an ethical position. How do error, randomness, contradiction, obliquity, and dissociation serve the poem and the poet? How do such strategies counter ideas of literary mastery, heroism, virtuosity, privilege and celebrity? What are the political possibilities of such counter stances, especially as embodied and expressed by poets who speak from outside the stronghold of the white male establishment? We will primarily read from recently published work in the U.S., but will also be interested to track the literary traditions that have shaped how contemporary poets think and write. Authors read may include: Wanda Coleman, Eileen Myles, Anne Carson, Layli Long Soldier, Vanessa Angelica Villarreal, Fanny Howe, Terrance Hayes, Jennifer Chang, Tiana Clark, Brenda Hillman, Jane Wong, Tommy Pico, Paisley Rekdahl, Brian Teare, Diana Khoi Nguyen, and C. D. Wright.

Throughout the term, we will grow a vocabulary to understand how, from the perspective of craft, an elongated brevity can often lend itself, perhaps counterintuitively, to such an immersive reading experience. We will also contemplate why so many of the texts appear focused on countering established historical narratives. What unique possibilities does the form of the novella offer in this regard? In these explorations, we will encounter novellas from, among others, César Aira, Yuri Herrera, Jocelyn Nicole Johnson, Gayl Jones, John Keene, Bruna Dantas Lobato, Toni Morrison, and Alejandro Zambra. These readings will be paired with brief critical texts that will frame the essays to be written each week. [ more ]\n\nENGL 244 TUT Interpreting Film\n\nLast offered Fall 2021\n\nFrom the earliest days of narrative film, it was clear that the new medium enjoyed an unparalleled capacity to absorb spectators in the sheer passive enjoyment of the cinematic spectacle, so for many viewers cinema has seemed naturally to be a form of entertainment rather than an art form or a medium for exploring ideas. But not only have entertaining \"movies\" and artistic \"films\" always co-existed amicably, but in many cases have coincided: some of the greatest works of cinematic art first billed themselves unassumingly as enjoyable diversions. In order to appreciate the aesthetic and intellectual richness of such films, one must learn to \"read\" their crucial scenes closely, analyzing their visual and auditory language as well as their dramatic content, and must learn to interpret their surprisingly complex larger patterns of thought. This tutorial offers concrete training in both of these skills. During the first four weeks, students will write and discuss short weekly papers analyzing key sequences of a film, learning to identify diverse cinematic effects in order to illuminate dramatic patterns. During the last six weeks of the semester each student in a tutorial pairing will write a longer interpretive paper in alternate weeks, learning to construct fuller arguments addressing the whole of a film. Most films will be drawn from classical Hollywood cinema of the 1930s and 1940s, but we will also study European, Indian, and Japanese films. Readings during the first part of the semester will concern technical features of cinema; later readings will address larger interpretive issues (e.g., patterns in film genres, such as the nature of the gangster as a tragic hero; or social issues reflected in films, such as the newly empowered roles of women during the early 1940s and their influence in shaping the dangerous heroines of film noir). [ more ]\n\nENGL 246 SEM The Craft of Writing\n\nLast offered Spring 2023\n\nAn introduction to writing short fiction in a course that emphasizes elements of craft. Discussion of published fiction will be combined with exercises, a student workshop, and individual conferences with the instructor. Students should expect a course that focuses on reading as well as writing.

Writers from 16th century French Michel Montaigne to contemporary American physician Siddhartha Mukherjee and Canadian lyric essayist Anne Carson have experimented in this form, varying the proportion of self-scrutiny to outward focus. We will study the meandering history of this rich literary form, learning both how to analyze and interpret representative examples from multiple traditions, and how to try our hand at our own creative nonfiction. That is, you will do both critical writing and creative writing for this course. Throughout, we will track how this genre serves those writers and readers who gravitate toward its special arts. Works read include those by the writers named above, as well as a selection from the following list: Henry David Thoreau, William James, Gertrude Stein, James Baldwin, James Agee, John McPhee, Alice Walker, Gloria Anzaldua, Claudia Rankine, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, and Maggie Nelson.

In this course, students will trace how black womanhood became central to uplift ideology and the making and sustaining of black communities in the post-Reconstruction, Harlem Renaissance, and Black Power eras. We will read works across a broad historical spectrum to identify the ways different writers wrestle with race and gender using literary tropes, such as the \"tragic mulatto,\" in different social contexts. We will also engage a range of forms, including an essay (Patricia Hill Collins's \"Mammies, Matriarchs, and Other Controlling Images\"), a choreopoem (Ntozake Shange's For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide when the Rainbow is Enuf), and socio-political propaganda (the \"Black is Beautiful\" movement). This course will end with a consideration of the way writer and producer Issa Rae engages with contemporary ideologies of black womanhood in the HBO series Insecure. [ more ]\n\nENGL 250(S) SEM Americans Abroad\n\nThis course will explore some of the many incarnations of American experiences abroad from the end of the 19th century to the present day. Materials will be drawn from novels, short stories, films, and nonfiction about Americans in Europe in times of war, peace, and pandemic. We will compare and contrast the experiences of novelists, soldiers, students, war correspondents, jazz musicians, and adventurers. What has drawn so many Americans to Europe? What is the difference between a tourist, an expat, and an émigré? What are the profound, and often comic, gaps between the traveler's expectations and the reality of living in, say, Paris or a rural village in Spain? What are the misadventures and unexpected rewards of living, working, writing, or even falling in love in translation? How did recent lockdowns and border closings impact and/or interrupt these complex experiences? Authors may include: Edith Wharton, Henry James, Langston Hughes, Martha Gellhorn, Ernest Hemingway, Elaine Dundy, Richard Wright, and Ben Lerner. Additional reading will be drawn from historical and critical works. All readings will be in English. This comparative course is designed to highlight the challenges and benefits of cultural immersion abroad. It will focus on the linguistic, emotional, intellectual, and social adaptation skills that are required to understand others, and oneself, in new contexts. Many of the authors and artists we will study chose, or were forced to, leave oppressive situations in the United States where their futures were limited due to factors related to politics, gender, race or class (and combinations thereof). We will study their dislocation, and freedom, and struggles to reshape their (and our) concept of \"home\" into something that reflects individual identity, and not one imposed by any national culture--American or foreign.

How do plays and performances across global networks engage with different models of feminism: liberal, radical, materialist, and intersectional? Why has feminism mattered to theatre-makers of the past? Should it still matter now? If so, what forms might future feminist theatres take? In this tutorial course, students will work in pairs to examine the social and political relation of feminism to the art and practice of theatre. Taking a global and comparative perspective on the subject, we will focus on the intersectionalities of gender, race, class, ethnicity, nationality, and sexual identity in the production of feminist-driven theatrical practices. Artists, companies, and movements to be considered may include: Spiderwoman Theatre, Adrienne Kennedy, Caryl Churchill, Sphinx Theatre Company, Ntozake Shange, Griselda Gambaro, Manjula Padmanabhan, Cherríe Moraga, Lisa Kron, Arethusa Speaks, Maya Krishna Rao, Tracie Chima Utoh-Ezeajugh, Alexis Scheer, Tori Sampson, Clare Barron, and others. Close analysis of source material will be informed by critical and autobiographical writings by: Audre Lorde, Judith Butler, bell hooks, Gloria Anzaldúa, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Eve K. Sedgwick, Gayatri Spivak, Jill Dolan, José E. Muñoz, and Donna Haraway. This course will follow a standard tutorial format, with students taking turns presenting or responding to their peer every other week; for their presentations, students will write a 5-page paper or, in up to two cases if they choose, offer their argumentation through more performance-driven methods (such as an oral argument, spoken-word monologue, or activist prompt).

This course will consider the ways in which such films model for us those moments when our expectations and/or actions collide with the devastating realities of our physical world and/or political situation. How do we measure loss when loss occurs at the upper end of the human scale? How do we consider collectively, in either secular or metaphysical terms, the issue of our own complicity in--if not responsibility for--disaster? Films to be studied will include Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men, Jordan Peele's Get Out, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, Lorene Scafaria's Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, Jeff Nichols' Take Shelter, Armando Iannucci's The Death of Stalin, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's 28 Weeks Later, Bruce McDonald's Pontypool, Yoshiro Nakamura's Fish Story, and Joshua Oppenheimer's The Act of Killing.

In nearly all of our academic pursuits, the point of analysis is to find meaning, to explain intricate or confusing phenomena, to provide clarity from complexity. What happens when we can't do this, indeed, when the objects of our analytical attention seem willfully designed to thwart the attempt? Such is the challenge of \"understanding\" the traditions of the absurd. In this tutorial course, we will engage this challenge within the realm of Western theatre and performance from 1900 to the present. Beginning with selected readings from writers who have engaged the absurd in theoretical fashion (Albert Camus, Soren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Esslin), the course will move swiftly to original artworks for contemplation and analysis. Some questions we will grapple with include: How do we, can we, should we respond to art that specifically defies meaning? Can art that seems pointless have a point? Playwrights will range from canonical (Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco) to more obscure but equally engaging (as well as baffling) artists (Peter Handke, Slavomir Mrocek). We will follow standard practice in tutorial pairs, as each week one student will prepare original analysis of the assigned reading, and the other will craft a response to prompt an hour-long discussion. Whether we \"make sense,\" or perhaps discover different ways of appreciating the varied works of art, will depend on the nature of those weekly attempts.

(Note the exclusion of \"memoir\" or \"autobiography\" in this list. This course is NOT a course in memoir or autobiography.) As a Gateway to the English major, this course we will focus on critical methods and analytical writing skills that will serve students who want to pursue more advanced work in the department. (Note: this is not a creative writing course.) We will consider the literary history of the personal essay from Montaigne to yesterday, attending primarily to writers from the 20th and 21st centuries, and from the U.S. The reading list may include: James Baldwin, James Agee, Annie Dillard, Audre Lorde, John McPhee, Joan Didion, Adrian NicholeLeBlanc, Jennifer S. Cheng, Anne Carson, Samuel Delaney, Maggie Nelson, Alexander Chee, Lydia Yuknavitch, Saidiya Hartman and Karen Green.

The city provides for poets a vivid mental and imaginative landscape in which to consider the relation of vice and squalor to glamour; the nature of anonymity and distinction; and the pressure of myriad bodies on individual and mass consciousness. We will explore ways in which the poet's role in the body politic emerges in representations of the city as a site both of civilized values and/or struggles for power marked by guile and betrayal. Taking into account the ways in which cities have been transformed over time by changing social and economic conditions, we will consider such issues as what the New York of the 1950s has to do with the London of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and why poetry as a genre might be particularly suited to representing the shifting aspects and populations of urban life. Poets will include Dante, Pope, Swift, Blake, Wordsworth, Whitman, Baudelaire, Yeats, Crane, Moore, Hughes, Brooks, Lorca, Bishop, Ginsberg, Baraka, Ashbery, Yau, Bitsui, Rankine, and Diaz. We will also draw on essays by Simmel, Benjamin, Williams, and Canetti, photographs by Hines, Weegee, Abbott, and Nishino; the blues, as sung by Holliday and Vaughan; and films such as Man with a Movie Camera, Rear Window, and Breathless.
