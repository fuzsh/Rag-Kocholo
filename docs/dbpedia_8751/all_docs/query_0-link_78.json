        "text": "Learning from my job: First off, I absolutely love what I do—guiding tours, creating experiences, and chatting with people from all over. It's the thrill of meeting new faces that gets me. Each tour brings new lessons from my guests. One thing I really wish for? Using first names more freely in Japan. I always end up adding “san” to everyone's name, though. It's a Japanese thing, I guess—clearing up how we relate to each other, keeping things comfy and harmonious in the group. Sure, “Hi, Nakamura san” works, but I’m all for first names. They just make connections feel closer, even in business. So, when I'm with guests, I make it a point to use names. It helps me feel more connected, like I'm part of the big, wide world, not just Japan. #Japaneseculture\n\n🎌 The respect and discipline in Japan may be second to none. 🤝 The mentality of people walking up the stairs is not to bother other people. Sure you might be late, and using the other stairs might cut you time to get to where you're going, but it comes at the cost of inconveniencing others and they won't do that. The subway passenger pushers are an actual job in Japan. There is an etiquette about how you push and how you prepare to get pushed. The commuter will stand a certain way and give you a look that indicates they are ready to be pushed and that you only push them in by pushing certain parts of the body in a very polite way. You don’t just shove any part of them as hard as possible. People are as nice as possible about this in Japan. If you begin saying, \"Sumimasen, sumimasen,\" people will readjust to help you get out. The people by the doors will even step onto the platform if needed. They totally get it and help facilitate the process because they would hope for the same when they're in that situation. What's a practice in your part of the world that you are proud of, people behaving like this? #Japan #Culture #Transportation\n\nThis summer, I had the incredible opportunity to embark on a two-week vacation in #Japan, the profound impact this beautiful country had on me cannot be overstated. The richness of Japanese culture offers so many valuable lessons for our business and personal lives. 1. Respect and Harmony: Japanese culture places a strong emphasis on respect for others and the environment. Harmony holds immense significance, fostering a sense of unity, balance, and cooperation that enhances relationships and supports a peaceful coexistence. 2. Attention to Detail: From the meticulous art of sushi-making to the precision of traditional tea ceremonies, the Japanese have incredible attention to detail. They meticulously craft every aspect of their work, resulting in extraordinary precision and perfection. 3. Minimalism and Simplicity: Japanese aesthetics often revolve around minimalism and simplicity. By adopting a \"less is more\" approach, we all can find beauty and tranquility in decluttering our lives, both physically and mentally. 4. Connection with Nature: The Japanese have a deep connection with nature, evident in their love of cherry blossoms, Zen gardens, and forest bathing (Onsen). Having a stronger bond with the natural world, we can protect the environment as well as nurture our well-being.

This silence is a manifestation of the collective effort to maintain harmony 🧘♀️🧘♂️and minimize disruptions in crowded spaces, such as trains during rush hour 🚇. It reflects the respect for others' personal space 👤and the understanding that one's actions can impact those around them.Japanese commuters prioritize the comfort and well-being of fellow passengers by avoiding loud noises, conversations, or any behavior that might disturb the tranquility of the train car. This adherence to silence is also influenced by the cultural value placed on modesty and humility 🙇♀️🙇♂️, as overt displays of personal conversations or emotions are considered inappropriate in public settings. #nuelarchitects #Japan #silence #Japanpeople\n\nFOOD FOR THOUGHT 🤔 #OSHIYA 押し屋 IS THE ROLE-PLAY CAN BE EXTENDED? Oshiya - Subway pusher. The term is derived from the verb osu (押す), meaning \"push\", and the suffix -ya (屋), indicating \"line of work.\" Oshiya is a unique phenomenon of urban transportation that reflects the culture and challenges of mass transit in #Japan. Some people may find them helpful, while others may find them intrusive or uncomfortable. What do you think of Oshiya? Would you like to experience being pushed by them? It only occurs during peak hours. In an organization, Oshiya may have some similar roles or functions. “Passengers” in a train are synonymous with employees in a company. Some “passengers/employees” may require or desire a push to achieve the company’s target and goals. They have different qualifications, strengths, and characteristics. They may face some difficulties or challenges in working as a part of the organization. They are not liabilities, but assets who want to contribute to the system. However, they struggle to adapt to the system or the culture of the organization. When time is of the essence, a push with guidance provides great comfort and motivation. In this context, can Oshiya be recognized as an integrator in an organization? Who can bridge the gaps between different business units and push the latter to align with the company’s goals? Companies do have peak and off-peak situations. What is your perspective on this? Look at the scene, One passenger refused to step out and the Oshiya with its authority pushed that passenger in. 😁 They also hold the door to ensure every passenger is given the chance to be boarded. Once the door shuts/objective is met, all smile. ☺️ This was a unique experience for me during my student days in Japan. #culture #japanese #railway #rajanazirinshah\n\nJapanese language learners & aspiring Japanese-speaking Flight Attendants: Let’s do a Japanese listening activity!
