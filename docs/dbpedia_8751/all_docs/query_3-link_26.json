        "text": "Japanese mixed martial arts fighter\n\nFor the ski jumper, see Kazuhiro Nakamura (ski jumper).\n\nKazuhiro Nakamura (Japanese: 中村和裕 , born July 16, 1979) is a Japanese retired mixed martial artist who competed as a Middleweight in DREAM, and is a former DEEP Middleweight Champion. He fought out of the Yoshida Dojo and also competed in the Pride Fighting Championships, the Ultimate Fighting Championship and the Sengoku Raiden Championship. His primary style is judo, in which he holds a third dan black belt under Hidehiko Yoshida.[1]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting judo at 10 years old, Nakamura went to train under Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki and enter the Fukuyama University team. He became a professional judoka under the sponsorship of Keiyo Gas and competed at national and international level, placing third at the Japanese championships at 100+. His career in judo lasted until 2002, when he met Hidehiko Yoshida and became a member of his Yoshida Dojo.[2]\n\nPRIDE Fighting Championships\n\n[edit]\n\nNakamura made his MMA debut at PRIDE 25 against Antônio Rogério Nogueira, losing by submission in the second round. He has also lost to Nogueira in a rematch at PRIDE Bushido 4. His career in PRIDE was notable for fighting many of PRIDE's top fighters, including Wanderlei Silva, Maurício Rua, Dan Henderson, and Josh Barnett. His final fight in PRIDE was a decision loss to Maurício Rua at PRIDE Shockwave 2006.[3] He was known for his flashy entrances, often coming to the ring wearing sunglasses and accompanied by penguin mascots.[2]\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship\n\n[edit]\n\nNakamura made his debut in the UFC at UFC 76 against Lyoto Machida. His first apparition in the promotion was specially notable for his entrance and attire choices, coming to the cage wearing an ornated kimono, a jingasa hat and a gas mask before taking them off to reveal floral print shorts. He also carried a wagasa umbrella and exhibited a haircut adopted from Japanese comedian Toru Hotohara.[2] During the fight, Nakamura absorbed punishment and avoided several possible finishes, but he lost by unanimous decision. After the contest, Nakamura would be suspended and fined $500 by the CSAC for failing a drug test for marijuana.[4] Kazuhiro would protest the results, but it was not revoked.[2]\n\nHis next fight in the UFC was a loss by TKO (injury) to Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou at UFC 84. He was subsequently released by the promotion.\n\nSengoku Raiden Championship\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter a three-fight losing stint which included losses to future UFC Light Heavyweight Champions Lyoto Machida and Maurício Rua, Nakamura decided to debut at a new weight class Middleweight (185 lbs) after having spent his entire career at Light Heavyweight.\n\nNakamura debuted at Sengoku: Fifth Battle as an entrant in the inaugural Middleweight Grand prix eliminating British Paul Cahoon. He returned at Sengoku - Sixth battle as part of the final four. Kazuhiro Nakamura defeated fellow countryman Yuki Sasaki via unanimous decision and booked a spot later that evening in the final. Nakamura fought against tournament favourite Jorge Santiago and took him to the third round before losing via KO at 0:49 of the third round.\n\nNakamura Returned at Sengoku: Ninth Battle in a title eliminator that saw the winner rematch champion Jorge Santiago. Nakamura was stunned by Kazuo Misaki and lost via submission in the first round.\n\nDREAM\n\n[edit]\n\nA farewell event for Nakamura's teacher, Hidehiko Yoshida, was held on April 25, 2010.
