        "text": "Inamori Auditorium at Kagoshima University\n\nIn 1994, Inamori donated funds to construct the Inamori Auditorium to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Faculty of Engineering at Kagoshima University, his alma mater. The auditorium was built for a wide range of activities, including university academic functions and community cultural activities.\n\nThe Inamori Auditorium was designed by Professor Tadao Ando in the shape of an egg to symbolize a microcosm where the life of new creation dwells. This building represents Inamori's wishes that today's students, on whose shoulders the next generation rests, will fly out from Kagoshima University into the world.\n\nShiran-Kaikan, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University\n\nTo commemorate the 100th anniversary of the university's founding, the Faculty of Medicine at Kyoto University built a facility to support collaboration with the community and advance medical education. Following a request from the university, Inamori made a donation to the project.\n\nConstruction was completed in 1999 and the new facility was named \"Shiran-Kaikan.\" Inamori Hall is on the second floor and can accommodate 250 people for lectures, symposia and other events.\n\nStatues of the Ten Great Disciples of the Buddha Shaka\n\nThese statues are the work of Shinya Nakamura, a member of the Japan Art Academy, a Person of Cultural Merit (Japan), and an acclaimed sculptor. Moved by the realization that these ten principal figures of ancient times were being forgotten, Nakamura wished to showcase their honorable examples to those who aspire to lead a better life amidst today's complexities. Deeply impressed by the statues, Inamori donated them to the revered former head priest of Myoshinji Temple, Elder Tansetsu Nishikata, whom he deeply respected. The statues are now housed at Empukuji Temple of the Rinzai sect, Myoshinji School.\n\nDonated to renovation of Empukuji Buddhist temple's main hall and priests' quarters\n\nInamori entered the Buddhist priesthood at Empukuji, a temple in the Myoshinji school of the Rinzai sect. Empukuji has a 220-year history and was the first dedicated Buddhist training temple in the Rinzai sect. Many years of use and weather had taken a toll on the temple's main hall, and Inamori and Kyocera offered to contribute toward renovating it. The main hall and the priests' living quarters were rebuilt, and a grand ritual to celebrate completion was held in 2003. The renowned Japanese-style painter, Shiko Ito, was commissioned to paint the partitions in the Shoin (study).\n\nMediating a Reconciliation between Kyoto City and the Kyoto Buddhist Association\n\nDuring his tenure as chairman of the Kyoto Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Inamori played a pivotal role in mediating a reconciliation between Kyoto City and the Kyoto Buddhist Association, which had been in conflict for years over the proposed Ancient City Tax concept. Both parties signed a joint declaration committing to \"work together for the revitalization of tourism in Kyoto and the creation of a cityscape with due consideration to the landscape,\" thus resolving the long-standing issue."
