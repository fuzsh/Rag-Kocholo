Like her sisters she attended Havergal College in Toronto, where her artistic abilities were regularly noted. She studied at the University of Toronto for a year [1929-30] and spent four years at the Ontario College of Art [1929-32] under her father Gustav, her uncle Emanuel, J.W. Beatty, Frank Carmichael, A.G. Barns, Yvonne McKague Housser etc. Her years at the OCA were highly productive and she achieved honours and scholarship levels in design, still life, antique, costume, composition, modeling, and commercial art. At her graduation she won the Governor-General’s medal for the arts and was appointed an associate of the department of painting and drawing at the college. Starting in 1934 she worked at the Royal Ontario Museum as artistic designer, head of the art department, and keeper of the print collection. Her 11 murals and other gallery designs are still in place at the Museum. Sylvia Hahn’s most productive years were from the 1940s to the late 1960s. She taught metalwork, judged craft competitions and illustrated books. She was an active member of the Ontario Society of Artists, the Canadian Painter-Etchers, and various craft organizations (including the Toronto Metal Crafts Guild). She was given many commissions and her superb liturgical work (silver, altar pieces, paintings and sculpture) can be seen in as many as 15 churches across the country. Her murals also hang in Havergal College and Emmanuel College at University of Toronto. The artist was a proficient print-maker and was well known throughout her life for her wood engravings and woodcuts. She illustrated several books with her wood engravings, including “The Four Heads Lyre” poems by Lars von Hartnn, and “A Naturalist’s Guide to Ontario”. In later years she also wrote, illustrated and published books about nature and her cats. She was the last member of the Hahn family to live in the old summer home \"Myrtle\" (a subject of many of her works) located just outside Whitby, Ontario. In 1975, during the International Women’s Year, she was nominated as an outstanding woman of the Province of Ontario.\n\nAleen Aked [1907-2003] was born in Kildwick, Yorkshire, England and moved to Canada at age three.
