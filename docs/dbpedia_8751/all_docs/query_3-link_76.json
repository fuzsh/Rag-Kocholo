        "text": "Onosato Daiki - 大の里 泰輝 (born June 7, 2000) is a Japanese professional sumo wrestler from Tsubata, Ishikawa. He made his debut in May 2023 and currently wrestles for Nishonoseki stable. He reached the makuuchi division in January 2024 and has 6 special prizes and 1 top division championship. His highest rank as of 2024 is sekiwake.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nDaiki Nakamura was born on June 7, 2000, in the town of Tsubata in Ichikawa Prefecture. Nakamura began wrestling in a sumo club at his elementary school in first grade. As a child Nakamura was fascinated by professional sumo and admits that one of his favorite books was the magazine Sumo published by Baseball Magazine.\n\nIn August 2014, he participated in the Open-weight competition at the Sumo World Championships held in Taiwan and finished third, behind Ukrainian wrestler Oleksandr Veresiuk and Mongolian Baasansuren Turbold, who won that year's tournament. Nakamura then attended Itoigawa City Nou Junior High School and Niigata Prefectural Marine High School to continue his amateur sumo career. During his years at Itoigawa, he won the 2016 Junior High School competition at the Hakuho Cup.\n\nIn 2019, he entered Nippon Sport Science University, a university famous for its strong sumo club. During his first year, he first won the individual competition in the adult division of the National Athletic Meet, hence becoming the second best individual champion in the history of the competition and allowing him to become professional at the rank of makushita tsukedashi 15. He then took part in the National Student Sumo Tournament in Sakai as a freshman and won the individual tournament. This victory, over Kindai University's Koshiro Tanioka, marked the first time in 29 years that a freshman won the tournament, since Luis Go Ikemori (who later became a professional wrestler under the shikona of Ryuko) won in 1990. In May 2021, he participated to the 70th All Japan Sumo Championships at the Ryogoku Kokugikan and became amateur yokozuna after defeating Kindai University's Kanzaki Taiga in the final, again qualifying for the makushita tsukedashi system. During that same tournament, he defeated Tottori Johoku High School's Tetsuya Ochiai during the team competition.\n\nIn January 2022, Nakamura took part in the World Games' sumo competition held that year in Birmingham, Alabama. Competing in the Open-weight and Over 115kg categories, he won the former and finished runner-up in the latter. In October of the same year, he participated in the National Athletic Meet in Otawara and won the amateur yokozuna title for the second consecutive time in this tournament. With his victory at the 70th All Japan Sumo Championships, Nakamura became the fourth person since the introduction of this system in 2000 to be eligible to join professional sumo at the rank of makushita tsukedashi 10. This victory was also the fifth time that Nakamura had won the championship title in a tournament counting towards makushita tsukedashi status. Overall, during his time as an amateur wrestler at university level, Nakamura won no less than 13 titles, placing him tying him for the greatest number of amateur titles won by a wrestler. His dominance of amateur sumo in Japan was such that sumo columnist John Gunning declared that he saw in Nakamura's sumo a continuous display of \"calm smooth style reminiscent of Hakuho in his younger days.\"\n\nIn March 2023, Nakamura made the decision to become a professional wrestler (rikishi) by joining Nishonoseki stable under the guidance of former yokozuna Kisenosato. At the time of his recruitment, he expressed his intention to achieve sekitori status as quickly as possible. Moreover, his entry into the professional world a few months after the record-breaking promotion of Hakuoho (then known as Ochiai) did not fail to raise the interest of commentators as to the hypothesis of a rivalry between these two dominant wrestlers of the amateur world. On the subject of choosing to join this particular stable, Nakamura expressed his interest in being trained by a former yokozuna and that the stable, located in Ami, Ibaraki, offered him a healthy working environment \"to eliminate any temptations and be able to concentrate on sumo.\" Since he turned professional in May 2023, Nakamura was the last wrestler to be promoted to makushita tsukedashi 10 due to his amateur prowess, the system for promotion to the top of the makushita division having been abolished in September 2023.\n\nCareer[]\n\nEarly Career[]\n\nIn April 2023, it was announced that Nakamura would now fight under the shikona, or ring name, Onosato (大の里), with the kanji \"大\", meaning 'great', to accentuate his talent and the kanji \"の里\" to establish Nakamura in the line of Yokozuna Takanosato (隆の里) and Kisenosato (稀勢の里). This name, chosen to represent his master's expectations, was chosen in particular because this shikona had been proposed to Kisenosato when he was still an active wrestler when his promotion to the rank of ozeki had been certain. Coincidentally, the shikona has the same pronunciation as a Taisho era-ozeki, Onosato Mansuke and Nakamura's father declared \"I am deeply moved by the honor of my son being named after a former ozeki with such a long history.\" On the announcement of his entry as a professional wrestler, his former coach at Niigata Kaiyo High (Tetsuya Tomi) declared his satisfaction and compared him to \"a Shohei Ohtani of sumo,\" announcing that Nakamura had the potential to become the monster of the new era (新時代の怪物). On the occasion of his passage to the new apprentice examination, the now-Onosato, obliged to comply with professional wrestlers dress rules, received an obi belt that his master had used.\n\nHaving logically received the Japan Sumo Association approval to compete, Onosato logically began his career at the rank of makushita tsukedashi 10. His first professional match was against Takasago stable wrestler Ishizaki, a senior of Onosato during their time at NSS University. Ishizaki however defeated Onosato by tsukiotoshi in what Ishizaki later describes as a \"fluke match\". Nonetheless, Onosato finished the tournament with a score of 6–1, missing out, however, on promotion directly to the juryo division, which some observers had been expecting.\n\nDuring the July tournament, Onosato logically competed again in the makushita division, this time ranked as makushita 3. He won his first two matches, but suffered his first defeat in his third match against Tokihayate. On the seventh day of the tournament, Onosato faced amateur scene rival and upper-division wrestler, Kiho. Kiho had never managed to beat Onosato on the amateur scene, and Onosato even won the college yokozuna title from him at the 2022 championships. Kiho nevertheless managed to defeat Onosato by hatakikomi and thus inflicted on him his second consecutive defeat. At the time, this defeat was thought to delay even further Onosato's promotion to juryo. Nevertheless, Onosato still managed to record a positive score of 4 wins by beating in his last match juryo-wrestler Hidenoumi. Because of this barely achieved kachi-koshi record, he also shared he felt sick on the last days of the tournament.\n\nJuryo Career[]\n\nWhen the rankings for the September tournament were announced, however, it was confirmed that Onosato's score was sufficient to promote him to juryo, professional sumo's second-highest division. This promotion, acquired at the same time as stablemate and NSSU senior classmate Takahashi, allowed Nishonoseki stable to simultaneously receive two new sekitori, and the first two raised by Kisenosato alone since he had become master in 2019. Furthermore, this double promotion marks the first time since July 2012 that two stablemates have gained sekitori status at the same time. After his promotion, Onosato went to his hometown of Tsubata, Ishikawa to officially announce his promotion to his local fans. After a conference attended by around 600 people, he was presented with a stock of 600 kg (1,300 lb) of rice. During the August jungyo, he took part in public training series and competed against his juryo peers. He was also honored to be trained later by current and former ozeki Takakeisho and Takayasu, the latter having been stablemate of Onosato's master, and was praised for his attitude toward training.\n\nDuring his first juryo tournament, Onosato first recorded seven consecutive wins in seven matches with a victory over Kiho, placing him at the top of this competition. On Day 8, Onosato maintained his lead with an eighth consecutive victory, making him the seventh juryo wrestler in the history of the sport to win eight in a row from day one of the competition and the first to achieve this since Takakeisho (then known as Sato) at the May 2016 tournament. Since he also followed this up with a ninth victory in a row, Onosato became the juryo wrestler to win the most victories since the first day of a competition, tied with Naruyama at the January 1953 tournament and Shotenro at the November 2008 tournament. Onosato's winning streak ended at 9 consecutive victories, however, after he was defeated by Ichiyamamoto on the tenth day of the competition. Onosato managed to keep himself in the title race with Ichiyamamoto, with the championship set to be decided on the final day. Onosato nevertheless lost his final match to Roga and finished just one defeat behind Ichiyamamoto, who won that month's tournament.\n\nDuring the November 2023 tournament, he won his first match against a wrestler who had been ranked in the sanyaku ranks by defeating former sekiwake Aoiyama on the eighth day of the competition. Onosato was then able to maintain his lead throughout the tournament, recording eleven wins on day fourteen, tied with Kotoshoho, with the championship to be decided on the final day. Although Onosato won his final match against Mitoryu, Kotoshoho also kept himself in the title race by also claiming a twelfth victory. The championship was thus decided in a playoff, which Kotoshoho won by beating Onosato by uwatenage, causing Onosato to miss out on the championship for the second consecutive tournament.\n\nMakuuchi Career[]\n\nAfter competing in just four tournaments, Onosato's promotion to the top makuuchi division was announced for the January 2024 tournament. The promotion made him the first recruited by the former Kisenosato to be elevated to the top division. He is also the third-fastest to reach the top division since 1989 (after Endo and Hakuoho), doing so in four tournaments under the old tsukedashi system. Onosato told reporters after his promotion that he was happy to see his name in big letters at the top of the banzuke, while his stablemaster asked him to win 10 matches and the Fighting Spirit special prize in January as a reward for his arrival in the top division.\n\nOnosato performed well in the first half of the tournament, however, recording a defeat on the third day against Onosho. However, he maintained his position as one of the tournament's leading wrestlers by recording a sixth consecutive victory and a kachi-koshi on Day 9 against Meisei. On the tenth day, Onosato faced another tournament leader, Kotonowaka, however losing the match by yorikiri and leaving Kotonowaka alone in the lead in the title race. Onosato then suffered two consecutive defeats on Day 11 and 12, at the hands of Ozeki Hoshoryu and Yokozuna Terunofuji, virtually eliminating him from the title race. Because he had a match against Terunofuji, Onosato became the first wrestler to face a yokozuna in his first makuuchi tournament in 10 years, since Ichinojo faced yokozuna Kakuryu and Hakuho in the September 2014 tournament. For his performances, Onosato was however elected by popular vote Morinaga's Wrestler of the Day Award no less than four times during the tournament. For his 11 wins in his first tournament in the top division, he was also awarded the Fighting Spirit prize. After his inaugural tournament in the top division, Onosato commented that he was grateful to have been able to learn from the san'yaku ranks despite suffering three consecutive defeats at the hands of the upper echelons.\n\nDuring the March tournament of the same year, Onosato remained in the group of wrestlers leading the championship during the first week (tied with Takerufuji) nevertheless recording a defeat on the seventh day against Onosho. Onosato managed to keep himself in the title race on Day 9 by beating a san'yaku-ranked wrestler for the first time, defeating Sekiwake Wakamotoharu. On Day 10, Onosato lost his match against Takerufuji, leaving the latter alone at the top of the title race with a two-win lead over the rest of the competitors. Onosato continued his tournament with a notable win over Ozeki Takakeisho on Day 11. On Day 14, he maintained his chances of winning the tournament with an eleventh victory over Komusubi Abi, the yusho to be decided on the final day in his match against Ozeki Hoshoryu. The latter defeated Onosato for the second time in a row, although the championship was not at stake because an injured Takerufuji had already won a thirteenth victory to become the champion. For his prowess at the tournament, however, it was announced that Onosato would receive the prizes for Technique and Fighting Spirit. Regarding his rivalry with Takerufuji, the president of the Yokozuna Deliberation Council, Masayuki Yamauchi, defined it in his review of the tournament as that of the \"ryuko\" (龍虎), an expression drawing a parallel between the rivalry of the tiger and the dragon to designate two opponents of equal strength.\n\nOn 22 April 2024, the Sumo Association announced that they had issued a strict warning to Onosato and his stablemaster, after the latter reported that Onosato drank with an underage wrestler in his stable back in September 2023. Two days later, Onosato apologized for his actions. He added that he was grateful to have been allowed to wrestle for the final days of the spring regional tour, which was in progress at the time.\n\nSan'yaku Promotion and First Emperor's Cup[]\n\nWhen the banzuke for the May 2024 tournament was announced, Onosato was promoted to his then-highest rank, komusubi, making his debut in the san'yaku ranks in just six tournaments, the second-fastest progression to the san'yaku ranks since the Showa era (behind the record set in five tournaments by Ichinojo). During a press conference after the banzuke was released, Onosato was spotted sporting a small topknot for the first time. His stablemaster Nishonoseki commented that he never imagined Onosato would rise through the ranks so quickly. Both also apologized again with regard to the previous September's drinking situation, with Onosato stating that he caused trouble to so many people and his stablemaster, and that the most important thing was for him to keep winning.\n\nOn the opening day of the May 2024 tournament Onosato faced yokozuna Terunofuji and scored an upset victory over his top-ranked opponent by sukuinage (\"beltless arm throw\"). Onosato was the only san'yaku wrestler to win on the first day of the tournament. He continued to win over higher ranked wrestlers, beating sekiwake Wakamotoharu (Day 4) and ozeki Kirishima (Day 5) and Kotozakura (Day 6). On Day 8, he defeated one of his direct rivals, Daieisho. On the ninth day, he lost his one-win lead when he was defeated by Hiradoumi in an upset creating a tie between five wrestlers. Onosato climbed back into contention after that, and entered the final day of the tournament as the sole leader with 11 wins. He quickly defeated his Day 15 opponent, Abi, to avoid a playoff and clinch his first Emperor's Cup. Having won his first top-division title in seven tournaments since his debut, Onosato broke the speed record that had just been set by Takerufuji in the previous tournament. Onosato also was the first to win the top-division championship immediately after promotion to komusubi in 67 years, the last being the late Haguroyama in May 1957. Additionally, by winning two more special prizes he became the first wrestler in 25 years to win a special prize in each of his first three top-division tournaments. Onosato dedicated his victory to the people of Ishikawa Prefecture, who were affected by a deadly earthquake on 1 January. The day after winning the Emperor's Cup he told reporters at Nishonoseki stable: \"I'm happy to have won the championship, but my final goal is not here. I want to keep dashing up and go higher.\" He added that his stablemaster told him after his third loss that \"the title is gone,\" and also before the final bout that he should not celebrate, even if he had won the match and the championship. Onosato said that those words made him feel less stressed, renewing his gratitude for joining the stable.\n\nFollowing the May tournament the head of the Yokozuna Deliberation Council, Masayuki Yamauchi, commented that Onosato's victory was \"a sign that the sumo world is about to undergo major changes,\" adding his belief that Onosato would eventually reach the ozeki rank. The Sumo Association also downplayed rumors of a possible ozeki promotion earlier than usual, saying that only Onosato's 12 wins in May would count towards the promotion requirement of 33 wins over 3 tournaments, normally tallied while a wrestler is either a komusubi or sekiwake. At the following tournament in July Onosato finished with nine wins, one of which was against yokozuna Terunofuji for the second time in a row. He was awarded the Outstanding Performance prize for the second time, making him the first in sumo history to receive at least one of the special prizes in each of their first four top-division tournaments.\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nOnosato is the eldest in his family and has a little sister.\n\nOn 6 February 2024, Onosato was part of a delegation of wrestlers from Ishikawa Prefecture sent after the 2024 Noto earthquake (along with Endo, Kagayaki and former Tochinonada); charged with symbolically presenting Governor Hiroshi Hase with the sums raised during the January tournament and donations from the Sumo Association, since the presence of sumo wrestlers is considered a good omen. During his stay, he also paid a visit to the evacuation center that had housed his grandfather, receiving numerous messages of congratulations from the disaster victims for his recent sporting achievements.\n\nFighting Style[]\n\nOnosato has shown a preference for yotsu techniques which involve grasping his opponent's mawashi or belt. His most common kimarite or winning move are yorikiri force-out wins. His preferred grip is listed as migi-yotsu, meaning a right arm inside and left hand outside position. He is also using significant percentage of oshi-sumo pushing and thrusting techniques.\n\nRecord[]\n\nDivision Results[]\n\nTotal: 77-27/104 (8 basho)\n\nMakuuchi: 43-17/60 (4 basho)\n\nJuryo: 24-6/30 (2 basho)\n\nMakushita: 10-4/14 (2 basho)\n\nChampionships[]\n\n1 Makuuchi Championship (May 2024)\n\nAchievements[]\n\nSpecial Prizes: Outstanding Performance Prize (2), Fighting Spirit Prize (2), Technique Prize (2)\n\nShikona History[]\n\nOnosato Daiki (2023.05 - )\n\nGallery[]\n\nJSA Profile Pictures and Tegata[]\n\nCareer Overview[]\n\nSources[]"
