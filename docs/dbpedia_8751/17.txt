Kazuo Nakamura, painter (born 13 October 1926 in Vancouver, BC; died 9 April 2002 in Toronto, ON). A founding member of the Painters Eleven and a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, Nakamura produced abstract paintings that were distinctive among Canadian artists of his generation in part because of their formal simplicity and rigour.

Early Life and Career

Nakamura was among the Japanese Canadians interned during the Second World War (Tashme, BC, 1942–44). After studying at Toronto's Central Technical School (1948–51), he became a member of Painters Eleven. In the 1950s and 1960s his paintings were of four distinct types: dark, vaguely surreal block structures in stark environments evoking the prairies; muted landscapes with a gentle broken touch; off-white abstractions painted over spare, linear configurations of string laid down on canvas; and linear abstractions in an indeterminate space. All had a simpler structure and coloration (mostly monochrome) than the work of other members of Painters Eleven.
