Born in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1926, Kazuo Nakamura was a teenager when he became one of the 22,000 Japanese Canadians interned during World War II at an internment camp in Tashme near Hope, B.C. After being discharged from the camp in 1944, the eighteen year old Nakamura made his way east, first to Hamilton and then to Toronto, Ontario, where he spent the remainder of his life. The young artist studied art at the Central Technical School in Toronto, as well as, in the evenings under the instruction of Toronto artist Albert Franck. It was through his relationship with Albert Franck that Nakamura was introduced to the Toronto art scene.

In 1953 Kazuo Nakamura became a member of the brilliant group of Ontario based abstract expressionists known as “Painters Eleven”. It was through this affiliation with Painters Eleven that the artist gained national and international attention. Throughout the artist’s lifetime Nakamura’s paintings were exhibited in international exhibitions, including, in London, Paris, Madrid, New York, Tokyo, and Berlin. Kazuo Nakamura’s theoretical and highly stylized approach to painting has distinguished the artist as an iconic figure of 20th century Canadian art.
