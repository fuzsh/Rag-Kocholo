        "text": "The median household income in a city certainly helps gauge the cost of living. The median household income in Enterprise is $84,298 , which is 28 % more than that of the state. The median income for an individual is $43,011 , which is 16 % more than that of the state.\n\nThe minimum salary you need to live in Enterprise is the sum of your daily expenses (groceries, utilities, transportation, entertainment), your monthly housing-related costs (rent, mortgage, insurance, maintenance), any debt expenses (monthly interest payments and principal paydowns), as well as your savings and investment goals.\n\nA good rule of thumb for housing affordability is the 28% rule: your monthly rent or the sum of your monthly mortgage, property taxes, and insurance should not exceed 28% of your gross income (income before tax).\n\nUnderstanding the expected costs in Enterprise can help you determine whether a given salary is a livable salary. For instance, if you know the typical housing costs in Enterprise , you can use widely followed simple rules to determine if you can afford it on your salary. A good rule of thumb for housing affordability is the 28% rule: your monthly rent or the sum of your monthly mortgage, property taxes, and insurance should not exceed 28% of your gross income (income before tax). Another good rule of thumb is the 50-30-20 rule which says 50% of the net income (income after tax) should be spent on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings and investments. So plan to ensure that your net income covers your needs and wants, so that you can live comfortably in Enterprise, NV ."
