        "text": "City of Enterprise\n\nMessage from the Mayor\n\nAs Mayor of Enterprise, it is my pleasure to greet you as you seek to learn more about our fine city. Enterprise is a proud community and civic responsibility has resulted in the development of a city which has the appropriate mix of old south charm and new south vitality\n\nOur proximity to the Army Aviation Center at Fort Rucker, which trains American and allied pilots from throughout the world, has resulted in a diverse citizenry. This diversity enriches every aspect of our community and makes our city much less provincial than many simliar communities. Enterprise was selected as one of America's best places to retire by WhereToRetire magazine in April 2005. Enterprise is extremely accepting of newcomers, and I invite you to consider joining us for a visit or for a lifetime. Booking.com\n\nYou will find excellent public schools, health facilities, recreational activities, churches, civic and service clubs, and cultural activities. Enterprise is a great place to make a living and a great place to make a life!\n\nNote: To view the photogalleries within some of the departments' pages, you may be prompted to have Adobe Flash Player installed on your computer.
