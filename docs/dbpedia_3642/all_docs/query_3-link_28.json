On airport rental car offices are located on the ground level of the Terminal 2 Parking Garage except Enterprise which is located on Aolele Street.”- from Hawaii.gov airport website.\n\nThanks for posting this and for asking the question OP. I often did wonder about Enterprise, whether it was onsite or required a shuttle offsite. Nice to know Sixt is onsite as well, don't rent from them often, but once in a while they do have good pricing.\n\nGreat3\n\nWe rented from Budget and they were offsite. Again not far from the airport but we had to take a shuttle\n\nI think the shuttle only moved you from one terminal to the the other, which is do-able by walking also. I have taken the rental car shuttle before only to realize it's just a short walk down (spent more time waiting for shuttle).\n\nGreat3\n\nI think the shuttle only moved you from one terminal to the the other, which is do-able by walking also.

We definitely had to take a (brief) shuttle ride over to Enterprise. They’re on that side/access road that a PP noted. You CAN walk and drag your luggage over there but it’s definitely much better to just take the shuttle.\n\nNo Budget was located down the road from the airport. Alamo and Enterprise and Budget were all on the same road. We were just there the beginning of August.\n\nInteresting, thanks for sharing. The last couple times I rented from Budget at HNL (admittedly it was older, like in 2018 and 2019), I just walked across the street from baggage claim into the garage and picked up my car there. Budget must have moved to nearby Alamo. Guess that only leaves Avis, National, Hertz, and Sixt onsite, which is a preferable experience but not a deal breaker since they usually cost more then their budget brands/lines of car rental company (Budget, Alamo / Enterprise, and Dollar / Thrifty).\n\nSince Budget did seemed to have moved, it it takes the edge off me favoring Budget over Alamo / Dollar.\n\nGreat3\n\nInteresting, thanks for sharing.

If you arrive Hawaiian airlines or other in terminal 1, then there is a shuttle to terminal 2. Budget could be wrong on their website too, and I do not remember if they were still in the garage or not in August. I do remember a sign saying what companies were in the garage, and all others need to take a respective shuttle to the specific rental company, but again do not recall the exact ones. And enterprise is not on the same road as Alamo. Alamo is much further away, and due to the route the shuttle bus takes, and the horrible programming of lights, take much longer than you would think to get there.\n\nThanks for posting this and for asking the question OP.

Definitely not at the airport rental car location and had to take a shuttle. Signs directed us to do so. But very close.\n\nI'm pretty sure all HNL rental car companies require a shuttle, depending on where you arrive. They still consider them \"on airport\" though. This was definitely the case at National in 2020."
