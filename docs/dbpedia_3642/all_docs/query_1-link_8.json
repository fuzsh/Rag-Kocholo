        "text": "This is seriously the best area in Vegas now. Henderson is now aging and has run out of room for new developments (not to mention that the mountains on our side of town are much prettier!). I'm surrounded by horse ranches, lots of nature, empty space, and new buildings/infrastruture/developments. People are nice and respectful here. Summerlin is the #1 target for criminals because of it's high-profile (not to mention filled with angry/pill-popping/drunk types). I'm so glad that I moved here instead of Summerlin or Henderson!\n\nLiving closer to the 215 or Blue Diamond provides greater options when it comes to dining, shopping, and groceries. However most of the suburbs that span between those main commuting areas are typically filled with underdeveloped land and constant construction, or just unclear/nonsensical traffic designations. Drivers also are still quite reckless even in residential areas, making it unsafe for young children especially who take the bus. I have seen students get dropped off and have to walk through construction areas with no pavement between the construction and the busy street. There are many roads where it begins as 2 lanes, and after a stop light it becomes as wide as 3 lanes but with no distinctions between them."
