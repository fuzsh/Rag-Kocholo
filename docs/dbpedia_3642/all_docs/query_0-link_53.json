Think poor communication skills, micromanagement, or the inability to show appreciation. These blind spots can wreak havoc on team morale, decision-making processes, and overall company culture, which can have a devastating impact on productivity and employee retention.” https://bit.ly/3LKSBlv\n\n“Everyone wants a recruiting process that is unique to their culture. That said, my clients that have the most effective recruiting— which leads to the most consistent retention—use a framework that includes most or all of the below. Take what works for you, leave the rest.” https://bit.ly/4dnWqsq\n\n“While listening to the excellent No Stupid Questions podcast, I was struck by an intriguing idea that came up in the conversation: confusion, often seen as a hindrance, might actually be a powerful tool for personal growth and learning. This counterintuitive concept is backed by scientific research.” https://bit.ly/3Y9wfSa"
