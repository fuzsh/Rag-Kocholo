        "text": "Enterprise is a very small but very loving town. Located in the country, peace of mind is of abundance. It has the best corn (when it rains, that is). Enterprise has been in a drought for some time, which is hard because farming communities like this rely on the moisture and struggle without it.\n\nThe people are very kind, and try their best to make you comfortable.\n\nIt is a small town and a very good place to raise your kids. In the education department, however, it is lacking. Most of the teachers are just there because it pays the bills, and don't really care about the students. If you are not a \"sporty\" type you are out of luck in the extracurricular department. They technically have a music and theatre program, but they are more of a lets hang out during third period kind of program.\n\nEnterprise is close enough and far enough from major cities and has very nice people."
