The settlers decided to take on the ambitious project of constructing a dam. Many thought that the dam would be impossible to accomplish and left the area. The rest of the settlers began work on the dam. With a lot of work and little return, the dam was completed, and the reservoir has supported the town ever since.\n\nGeography\n\nEnterprise is located on the south rim of the Great Basin, at an elevation of 5,329 feet (1,624 m).\n\nEnterprise is about 40 miles northwest of St. George and 45 miles southwest of Cedar City\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.9 square miles (7.5 km2), all land.\n\nEnterprise is the nearest community to Mountain Meadows.\n\nThe hillside letter E can be seen in the southwest.
