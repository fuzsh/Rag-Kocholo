        "text": "Thinking about checking out some new area down in Southern Utah for the rifle hunt this year. I have heard good things about the Enterprise area. I looked on some maps and it looks like there are quite a few ATV trails. I have no ATV, but does anyone have any insights to where a guy could go who is willing to hike a ton in the Enterprise area? Not looking for your hot spots...just places to get away from other hunters and see deer. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\ncopple2\n\nYou won't get away from other hunters anywhere near Enterprise. If you are willing to hike I'd go out by the old goldstrike mine and start hiking. You can get away from hunters that way but you'll be hunting some thick Cedars.\n\nIt's a sea of orange for the general rifle season. Goldstrike will be just as busy as everywhere else. Go if you want, I'm sure you'll still have a great time, but you won't be alone.\n\nox valley is a joke ive hunted it my whole life well ever sinse i could stay in a saddle and it is the worst kept secret in the state ive personally taken several monsters there myself but believe me when i say those days are over. fishon0 call kevin wamsley out of st george utah we will take you he has taken every one you will come in contact with in the ox valley area oh yeah and tell him thanks for keeping his big mouth shut over the years with his huge camps and new guys every year behind his dad in laws private locked gate. as for me you will not catch me anywhere near ov again!!!!!!\n\n'cummins power'\n\nVery well said longshooter338! I live on the road to ox valley and I know that country as well as just about anybody. I have not even bothered to hunt that place in the last 8 years. It is a joke to say the least. Granted there are some big bucks, but good luck getting one on the ground and not fighting with someone else over who actually shot it. Just my opinion.\n\nwww.atfirstlightguides.com"
