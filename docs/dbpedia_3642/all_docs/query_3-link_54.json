        "text": "WBENC Certification is the most widely recognized and respected national certification for women-owned businesses in the U.S.\n\nThrough certification, women-owned businesses gain access to a vast network of support, including targeted business opportunities for certified women-owned firms, increased visibility in corporate and government supply chains, education and development programs to spur growth and increase capacity, and networking and mentorship opportunities with thousands of women entrepreneurs and those who support them.\n\nWBENC is also an approved third-party certifier for the SBA’s Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contracting Program.\n\nWBENC Certification validates that a business is at least 51 percent owned, controlled, operated, and managed by a woman or women. This means one or more women must have unrestricted control of the business, a demonstrated management of day-to-day operations, and a proportionate investment of capital or expertise. To become certified, business owners undergo a thorough vetting process, including review of business documentation and a site visit.\n\nBecause of this thorough process, WBENC Certification is considered the gold standard for women-owned business certification and is accepted by more than 1,000 corporations, in addition to some states, cities, and other entities.\n\nOnce certified, women-owned businesses are designated as WBENC-Certified Women’s Business Enterprises, or commonly referred to as WBEs.\n\nEligibility Details\n\nWBENC partners with 14 Regional Partner Organizations authorized to administer WBENC and WOSB certification for women-owned businesses across the United States, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.\n\nTo achieve certification as a Women’s Business Enterprise, women-owned businesses complete a thorough documentation and site visit process.\n\nCertification Process"
