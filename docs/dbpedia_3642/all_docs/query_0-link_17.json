        "text": "I LOVED growing up in a small town. It was very close knit and personable. However; there is not a lot of opportunity. It was difficult to find a job and find entertainment. Overall 8/10.\n\nEnterprise is a very small but very loving town. Located in the country, peace of mind is of abundance. It has the best corn (when it rains, that is). Enterprise has been in a drought for some time, which is hard because farming communities like this rely on the moisture and struggle without it.\n\nThe people are very kind, and try their best to make you comfortable.\n\nIt is a small town and a very good place to raise your kids. In the education department, however, it is lacking. Most of the teachers are just there because it pays the bills, and don't really care about the students. If you are not a \"sporty\" type you are out of luck in the extracurricular department. They technically have a music and theatre program, but they are more of a lets hang out during third period kind of program.\n\nEnterprise is close enough and far enough from major cities and has very nice people.\n\nI moved to Enterprise, Utah a few months ago. It is a cute, quiet little town. It reminds me a lot of my hometown. The people are super friendly and helpful. It is a well kept town for the most part. I am excited to keep meeting new people and making new friends.\n\nI love the town of Enterprise. It is very small and great for raising families. It is very family friendly. It is so small that everyone knows everyone by name. Since the town is so small there are not very many opportunities for work. Most people that live here have to commute to St. George or Cedar City for work. Over all it is a great town to live in for people who are raising families. It is very safe and the school system is very good for how small the community is.\n\nIt is a great place to live. Everybody is so supportive and caring towards each other. The standard there is great and everyone helps everyone keep their standards."
