        "text": "Welcome to Enterprise:\n\nEnterprise City is a rural farming community located in south west Utah. The area raises some of the best hay, corn and kids. With several nearby lakes, boating and fishing opportunities are easy to find. Enterprise is the kind of place that you like to call home and also like to come home to. The mountains also invite with their scenic beauty, atv and hiking trails, as well as some great hunting. At the end of August, Enterprise City hosts its annual “Corn Fest”, where the whole town turns out to celebrate small town life and the bounty that our local farmers produce.\n\nPioneer settlers entered the area in the late 1800’s and settled a few miles west of present day Enterprise and called their small town, Hebron. Those industrious pioneers had a grand plan to build a large dam to help store a sizable amount of water for irrigating their crops during the dry summer season. It took years of sacrifice and labor to complete. This allowed them to irrigate far more land and to move farming into the broad valley east of Hebron. Soon a new townsite was plotted and most Hebron residents moved to present day Enterprise."
