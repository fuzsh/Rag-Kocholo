        "text": "The Psychology Today Directory has customizable search options that show potential treatment centers tailored to your location, including inpatient or outpatient, the types of insurance accepted, and even the programs the center specializes in. Finding the right treatment center can be vitally important, and the dropdown filters make it easier to find the best fit for you or your loved one.\n\nThere are treatment centers for individuals dealing with psychiatric issues as well as for those dealing with substance use or addiction, or who are dealing with both, also known as co-occurring disorders. The type of program that is right for an individual depends on their medical and mental health history, the severity of the issues they are dealing with, as well as their treatment goals. Individuals using the directory can filter to find a center best-suited to them based on their gender, the issues they are facing, such as addiction or a mental health condition, or the type of treatments they are seeking.\n\nIn an inpatient or residential treatment program, individuals receive treatment while living in a facility and have 24/7 access to care by medical professionals. There are various forms of outpatient treatment that offer different levels of care, including Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOPs) and Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHPs). PHPs tend to offer more time-intensive, supervised care than IOPs. Aftercare is another option that offers ongoing treatment for an individual recovering from substance use or addiction after they have achieved initial sobriety, which can take the form of either an inpatient or outpatient program.\n\nShort term treatment usually lasts less than 30 days, while long term programs can last 60 days, 90 days, or longer, depending on the needs and goals of the individual and the structure of the program. Individuals searching for a treatment program in the directory can filter results by duration.\n\nThe price of treatment varies according to the length and type of service you search for, such as detox treatment, residential treatment, or outpatient treatment, as well as location and amenities offered. Non-profit centers are typically less expensive than private centers, but may have longer wait lists. Using the filters on the Psychology Today Treatment Center Directory can help narrow down which centers accept insurance plans, and, if so, which ones.\n\nHealth insurance typically covers rehab, but the extent of coverage depends on the particular policy, the treatment provider, and the needs of the individual. Individuals are encouraged to check with their insurance providers prior to entering a treatment program. Once you have confirmed coverage, you can use the Insurance filter on the Psychology Today Treatment Center Directory to find and contact centers that accept your insurance."
