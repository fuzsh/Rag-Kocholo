        "text": "About Us\n\nThe Enterprise City School System is comprised of 6 elementary schools (Grades K-6), 2 junior highs, and one high school. Student enrollment in the system exceeds 6,500. The system employs more than 450 professionals and more than 250 support staff. The school system was the first in Alabama to be fully accredited by the State Department of Education and Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Students in the system consistently score above state and national averages on nationally-normed tests. Approximately 82% of EHS graduates go directly to 2-year or 4-year colleges while approximately 12% begin full-time service in the military. Recent graduating classes have accepted more than $10 million per year in scholarships."
