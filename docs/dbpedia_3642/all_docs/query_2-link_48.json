        "text": "For a complete list of Enterprise Utah homes for sale, please scroll to the bottom of this page. The city of Enterprise is located 35 miles north of St. George via Highway 18 and 40 miles west of Cedar City via Highway 56. It is a rural community of about 1,800 residents that sits on the northern edge of Washington County Utah.\n\nEnterprise Utah sits at an elevation of 5,300 ft, which makes it an ideal place to be in the summer months. Enterprise is known for its agriculture, with the primary crops being alfalfa, corn and potatoes. Many horse and livestock owners in southern Utah, especially those living along Highway 18, purchase their hay from Enterprise.\n\nEvery August, when the temperatures are comfortable in Enterprise, but extremely hot in the St. George area, people numbering in the thousands flock north to the Enterprise Cornfest. The Cornfest offers fresh corn and delicious barbecue meals, a vintage car show and live entertainment.\n\nEnterprise is also prized for its two fishing holes, the Upper and Lower Enterprise Resevoirs, which also supply water to the community. The City of Enterprise provides power, water, sewer, garbage, fire and EMS services. There are two schools â€“ Enterprise Elementary (K-6) and Enterprise High School (7-12), which prides itself on higher than average graduation rates (when compared to both Utah State and National averages)."
