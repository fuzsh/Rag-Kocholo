Everyone deserves to have meaningful work, helpful feedback and recognition, rewards for their efforts and opportunities to learn and grow. Providing these is a recipe for great leadership. And great leadership is good for all kinds of employees doing all kinds of work in all kinds of industries.” https://bit.ly/4dQqwFs\n\n“Enjoy fostering your EQ in all interactions, meetings, presentations and daily conversations. It’s your choice. Make a high EQ part of the fabric of who you are. Be the outstanding leader and manager you admire.” https://bit.ly/3yO7MaD\n\n“Cultivating curiosity in your professional life is crucial. So, start asking yourself, “What can I learn that will set me apart?” and remember—curiosity isn’t just a trait; it’s the key to elevating your personal brand and securing your place as a leader in your field.” https://bit.ly/4dS8KBs\n\n“Building a stellar team isn’t complicated, it’s just hard. Teams are cultures inside of cultures and the team leader sets the tone. If a team leader makes themselves vulnerable, others will too. If they balance the need to both drive results and be empathetic, others will too. If they supportively engage in tough conversations, others will too. There is no silver bullet to building a stellar team. There's just a messy process of holding on to a vision, driving towards it, staying open, learning together and improving along the way.” https://bit.ly/3X1QT5x\n\nHappy Birthday to our incredible Director of Operations, Mo! We're grateful for everything you do, and we hope your day is filled with joy and, of course, endless doughnuts! Cheers to another year of success and happiness! #birthday #shoutout #grateful #joy #ExpertEnterprise #BountifulBusiness #Utah #ExpertEnterpriseCareers\n\n“It's a scenario no leader wants to face—a transformation initiative once brimming with potential that ends not in triumph but in lessons learned the hard way. In fact, recent research shows that this is more common than you might think, with 88% of business transformations failing to achieve their original ambitions.” https://bit.ly/3Aku04x"
