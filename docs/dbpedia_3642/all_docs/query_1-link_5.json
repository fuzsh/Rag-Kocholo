        "text": "Enterprise, city, Coffee county, southeastern Alabama, U.S., about 90 miles (145 km) southeast of Montgomery. It was founded in 1881 by John Henry Carmichael near the community of Drake Eye. In 1882 the post office was moved from Drake Eye to the new community of Enterprise, named at the suggestion of a Baptist minister who considered it an enterprising undertaking. Its prosperity was based on cotton until the boll weevil ravaged the area (1915â€“16), creating a need for a more diversified economy. The unusual Boll Weevil Monument (1919) is the only memorial in the world glorifying a pest and symbolizes diversification from cotton to peanuts (groundnuts) and other crops.\n\nPeanuts remain the primary contributor to the economy; poultry and cattle are also important. Industries include poultry processing and the manufacture of textiles and truck trailers. Geneva State Forest is southwest of the city. Fort Rucker, 7 miles (11 km) east, is home to the United States Army Aviation Museum, which contains a large collection of military aircraft. The Piney Woods Arts Festival is held in April. Enterprise State Junior College was founded in 1965. Inc. 1896. Pop. (2000) 21,178; (2010) 26,562."
