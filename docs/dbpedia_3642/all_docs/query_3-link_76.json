        "text": "ENTERPRISE, Ala. (WTVY) - While summer can be relaxing for families, it’s not always pleasant for business owners.\n\n“Sometimes the month of august can be slower,” said Debbie Gaydos. “People are coming back from vacation, kids are going back to school. Their focus changes a little bit.”\n\nGaydos has been the owner of Shopaholic in Enterprise for 10-and-a-half years and is very familiar with the summer slowdown.\n\n“We have to work doubly hard to get them into town and into our stores,” said Gaydos.\n\nIt’s a time of uncertainty, especially with the competition of online storefronts.\n\n“Places like Amazon and other online shopping can take away from local entrepreneurs who have invested into this city,” said Main Street Enterprise Executive Director Mariah Montgomery.\n\nSupporting these businesses during this time can help the city continue to thrive.\n\nThat’s why Enterprise’s ‘Shop Local First’ campaign is aiming to combat this summer slowdown.\n\nIf customers spend $25 or more at three businesses downtown, they become eligible to win a $500 downtown shopping gift card.\n\n“This is kind of an initiative to get us over the hill into that holiday season where you’ll see a huge uptick,” said Montgomery.\n\nIt doesn’t just promote shopping locally, but it encourages exposure to other businesses in the area.\n\n“It will help support these businesses that have invested so much into downtown so they can stay and provide unique gifts that you may not be able to find somewhere else,” said Montgomery.\n\nHelping them continue to create relationships and help build a growing economy.\n\n“I’m so grateful, as I’m sure many of the businesses are down here,” said Gaydos. “To have the opportunity to build those relationships and have those customers.”\n\nThe Enterprise Shop Local First campaign will continue until August 31.\n\nSubscribe to our News 4 newsletter and receive the latest local news and weather straight to your email every morning.
