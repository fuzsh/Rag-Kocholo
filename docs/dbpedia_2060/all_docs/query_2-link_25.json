        "text": "Archivado en: •\n\nThe release of Moon Music, Coldplay’s upcoming album following Music of the Spheres, is just around the corner. After teasing the album with the track ‘feelslikeimfallinginlove,’ the band has now confirmed that ‘We Pray’ will be the second single from this era. And it’s not a solo effort!\n\nAs announced on their social media, Chris Martin will be joined by the voices of rappers Burna Boy and Little Simz, Chilean-Palestinian singer Elyanna, and Argentine artist Tini Stoessel. Together, they will create a beautiful song that, as the title suggests, will serve as a prayer for those in need.\n\nThe brief video shared is direct and to the point. It features just a few chords and the names of those involved in the single. Coldplay has confirmed that ‘We Pray’ will be released on August 23.\n\n«Such great excitement, oh my God,» Tini expressed in the comments. Her words carry extra significance given that she previously joined the English quartet on stage in 2022. The singer of Un mechón de pelo (2024) was the special guest at one of their concerts at Monumental Buenos Aires, where she performed the ballads ‘Carne y hueso’ and ‘Let Somebody Go’ with the band in front of more than 72,000 people. It was undoubtedly a memorable moment that planted the seed for this unique collaboration.\n\nAfter this, we’ll have just over a month to discover the full tracklist of Moon Music, an album whose physical format has been produced in a highly sustainable manner. In their effort to continue reducing and erasing their carbon footprint, the vinyl has been made from recycled plastic bottles. This aligns with their ongoing commitment to environmental responsibility and awareness, which was evident throughout their recent tour."
