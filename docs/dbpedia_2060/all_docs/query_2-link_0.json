Let’s clarify those things:\n\nNow to the second part of your question.\n\nIf you like “Liquid Soul & Zyce ft. Solar Kid – We Come In Peace (Talpa Remix)”, then I’d suggest checking out more of Talpa. In general, the remixer defines the mood of the track, so it’s Talpa in this case.\n\nI hope it makes things easier."
