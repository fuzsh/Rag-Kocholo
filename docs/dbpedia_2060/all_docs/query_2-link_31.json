        "text": "Taylor Swift announced a new album during her first 2024 Grammys speech of the evening...and it wasn‚Äôt Reputation (Taylor‚Äôs Version) despite rampant fan speculation. Swift instead shared she has an entirely new release coming:\n\n‚ÄúHey, this is my 13th grammy,‚Äù she started. ‚ÄúMy lucky number. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever told you that. I wanna say thank you to the members of the Recording Academy for voting this way. But I know that the way that the Recording Academy voted is a direct reflection of the passion of the fans. So I wanna say thank you to the fans by telling you a secret that I‚Äôve been keeping from you for the last two years, which is that my brand new album comes out April 19th. It‚Äôs called The Tortured Poets Department, and I‚Äôm going to go and post the cover right now backstage. Thank you. I love you. Thank you.‚Äù\n\nSwift did indeed post the cover (featuring her in bed, lounging in black lingerie) and another little hint about the work: ‚ÄúAll‚Äôs fair in love and poetry... New album THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT. Out April 19 ü§ç‚Äù\n\nShe also teased the album‚Äôs mood in the second slide: ‚ÄúAnd so I enter into evidence / My tarnished coat of arms / My muses, acquired like bruises / My talismans and charms / The tick, tick, tick of love bombs / My veins of pitch black ink / All‚Äôs fair in love and poetry. Sincerely, the Chairman of the Tortured Poets Department.‚Äù\n\nThe Track List\n\nOn Monday, February 5, Swift dropped the 17-song track list. It added further evidence to fans that the album could have several Joe Alwyn breakup songs, especially with track five being called ‚ÄúSo Long, London‚Äù after Swift had released ‚ÄúLondon Boy‚Äù on Lover years earlier. Fans also noted Swift‚Äôs Tampa, Floria stops on her Eras tour were her first after news broke of her and Alwyn‚Äôs breakup, perhaps what ‚ÄúFlorida!!!‚Äù is referencing.\n\nHere‚Äôs the full list:\n\nSide A\n\nFortnight (feat. Post Malone)\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department\n\nMy Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\n\nDown Bad\n\nSide B\n\nSo Long, London\n\nBut Daddy I Love Him\n\nFresh Out the Slammer\n\nFlorida!!! (feat. Florence + the Machine)\n\nSide C\n\nGuilty as Sin?\n\nWho‚Äôs Afraid of Little Old Me?\n\nI Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)\n\nloml\n\nSide D\n\nI Can Do It With a Broken Heart\n\nThe Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\n\nThe Alchemy\n\nClara Bow\n\nBonus Track: The Manuscript\n\nWhen Swift Wrote The Tortured Poets Department\n\nSwift revealed during her February 7 Tokyo concert that she began work on the album two years ago, in early 2022. Swift wrote Midnights track ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Losing Me,‚Äù believed by fans to be a song about the end of her romance with Joe Alwyn, on Dec. 5, 2021.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working on Tortured Poets since right after I turned in Midnights,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo you turn in an album months in advance so you can make finals, make sure it‚Äôs the best. So I started working on it immediately after that, and I‚Äôve been working on it for about two years. I kept working on it throughout the U.S. tour and when it was perfect in my opinion, when it was good enough for you, I finished it. And I am so, so excited. Soon you‚Äôll get to hear it. Soon we‚Äôll get to experience that together. And I‚Äôm just like, I‚Äôm over the moon about the fact that you guys care about my music. It still blows my mind. I love doing this. I know I keep saying that, but that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs true. Everyone‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòWhy do you make so many albums?‚Äô I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòMan, because I love it! I love it so much. I‚Äôm having fun. Leave me alone.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nThe First Bonus Song: ‚ÄúThe Bolter‚Äù\n\nOn February 16, Swift announced a new edition of The Tortured Poets Department with a bonus track called ‚ÄúThe Bolter.‚Äù Fans quickly found evidence the song could be about Alwyn, recirculating August 2022 paparazzi footage of them running from a VMAs after-party to their car to avoid being photographed. They held hands in it.\n\nShe emphasized the number 13 with a reminder to fans in early April.\n\nOn April 6, Swift posted a video to her Instagram Stories of an old typewriter with a message being typed out to fans that reads, ‚Äú13 days until THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT.‚Äù\n\nAt the end the message, the ‚Äúreturn‚Äù is hit for added flair.\n\nOn April 13, a new promotion on Apple Music for the album lets fans find a hidden message from Swift on the streaming service. Each day, a new word will be revealed in one of Swift‚Äôs five playlists exclusively released the streaming platform. Each playlist represents one of the five stages of heartbreak, according to the singer: denial in the ‚Äú ‚Äù playlist, anger in the ‚Äú ‚Äù playlist, bargaining in the ‚Äú ‚Äù playlist, depression in the ‚Äú ‚Äù playlist, and acceptance in the ‚Äú ‚Äù playlist.\n\nOn April 18, full message is to be revealed just a day ahead of The Tortured Poets Department's release.\n\nTo begin the mystery, the letters H, E, Y, B, E and R were capitalized throughout the lyrics of ‚ÄúGlitch,‚Äù according to Billboard. Rearranged, they spell ‚ÄúHereby.‚Äù\n\nOn April 14, she shared a post on Instagram that seemed to be a full lyric reveal, using a photo of herself looking through the ‚Äúphantom clear‚Äù vinyl album and writing in the caption, ‚ÄúI wish I could un-recall how we almost had it all.‚Äù"
