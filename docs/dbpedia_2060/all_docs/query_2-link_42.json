        "text": "Swedish star Mondo Duplantis soared 6.25m* to set the ninth world pole vault record of his career and cap a gold medal-winning performance at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games on Monday (5).\n\nThe 24-year-old has won every global menâ€™s pole vault title since claiming his first Olympic crown in Tokyo three years ago. With this latest victory, he becomes only the second man to secure two pole vault golds at the Games, following the double achieved by USAâ€™s Bob Richards in 1952 and 1956.\n\nDuplantis had the competition won at 6.00m, before he had the bar raised to 6.10m â€“ a height that added 7cm to the Olympic record.\n\nHe cleared that on his first try but he wasnâ€™t done there, and the bar went up to 6.25m â€“ one centimetre higher than the world record of 6.24m he set in Xiamen in April.\n\nAfter failing his first two attempts, he flew over the bar on his third and final try to make history yet again. Silver was claimed by USAâ€™s Sam Kendricks with 5.95m, while an emotional Emmanouil Karalis of Greece got bronze with 5.90m.\n\n\"I havenâ€™t processed how fantastic that moment was,\" Duplantis said later. \"Itâ€™s one of those things that donâ€™t really feel real, such an out of body experience.\n\n\"What can I say? I just broke a world record at the Olympics â€“ the biggest possible stage for a pole vaulter. The biggest dream since I was a kid was to break the world record at the Olympics, and Iâ€™ve been able to do that in front of the most ridiculous crowd Iâ€™ve ever competed in front of.\"\n\nAfter the rest of the field started at 5.50m, Duplantis opened his campaign at 5.70m and soared way clear. He passed at 5.80m and was back in action at 5.85m, which he managed with more than 20cm to spare.\n\nHis first-time clearance at that height was a feat matched by world indoor bronze medallist Karalis, Philippinesâ€™ world silver medallist Ernest John Obiena, Australiaâ€™s world bronze medallist Kurtis Marschall and Ersu Sasma of Turkiye. Two-time world gold medallist Kendricks had one failed attempt at 5.85m and then decided to skip straight to 5.90m. It paid off as he made that on his first try and celebrated wildly.\n\nKaralis, who was fourth at the Olympics in Tokyo, maintained his perfect record by clearing 5.90m on his first attempt and Obiena made it first time, too, but Sasma and Marschall knocked the bar and spent their remaining attempts trying to make it over 5.95m.\n\nKendricks then set a seasonâ€™s best when he cleared 5.95m, on his first go. Taking just his third vault of the competition, Duplantis soared clear, too.\n\nThat height marked the end of the contest for Marschall, Sasma, Obiena and Norwayâ€™s Sondre Guttormsen, the latter taking one attempt each at 5.85m, 5.90m and 5.95m.\n\nAfter his one try at 5.95m, Karalis attempted 6.00m twice. Although he wasnâ€™t successful, he had done enough to secure the bronze on countback ahead of Obiena.\n\nDuplantis was confirmed the winner when Kendricks failed the last of his three attempts at the six-metre bar and he continued to put on a show for fans in the Stade de France and around the world.\n\n\"I tried to clear my thoughts as much as I could,\" said Duplantis, reflecting on the lead-up to his world record-breaking vault. \"The crowd was going crazy. It was so loud in there, it sounded like an American football game. I have a little bit of experience of being in a 100,000 capacity stadium, but I was never the centre of attention. I was just trying to channel the energy everybody was giving me, and they were giving me a lot of it. It worked out.\"\n\nThe two-time Olympic, two-time world indoor and two-time world outdoor champion has now cleared six metres or higher a total of 86 times.\n\nIn Paris he topped a contest in which 11 men cleared 5.70m and it is only the second time at the Olympic Games in which that depth has been achieved.\n\nIt is also the second Olympics where eight men cleared 5.80m or higher, and the second Games where four men managed 5.90m or more.\n\nUSAâ€™s Chris Nilsen claimed silver behind Duplantis in Tokyo but missed out on the final in Paris after failing to clear 5.60m in qualification. Home athletes Thibaut Collet and Anthony Ammirati were also among those who did not progress.\n\nJess Whittington for World Athletics\n\nMEN'S POLE VAULT MEDALLISTS ðŸ¥‡ Mondo Duplantis (SWE) 6.25m WR ðŸ¥ˆ Sam Kendricks (USA) 5.95m ðŸ¥‰ Emmanouil Karalis (GRE) 5.90m Full results\n\nMake sure you're signed up to our newsletter for daily chances to win amazing prizes\n\n*Subject to the usual ratification procedure"
