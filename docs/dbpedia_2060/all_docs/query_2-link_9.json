        "text": "Taylor Swift has revealed the tracklist for her upcoming album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” out April 19.\n\nSwift shared a photo of what appears to be the backside of the physical record, with a tracklist that features Post Malone on a song called “Fortnight,” and Florence + the Machine on another titled “Florida!!!”\n\nSwift won the Grammy for album of the year and best pop vocal album for “Midnights” over the weekend and, in her acceptance speech for the latter, she announced the impending arrival of her next studio effort.\n\n“Okay, this is my 13th Grammy, which is my lucky number. I don’t know if I’ve ever told you that,” Swift joked at the top of her speech. She went on to thank fans, and in return, said she would reward them “by telling you a secret that I have been keeping from you for the last two years, which is that my brand-new album comes out April 19th.”\n\nA pre-order link on Swift’s website details the new album: It will be 16 tracks, and the vinyl, CD and cassette editions will feature a bonus song called “The Manuscript.” There is also a collectible 24-page book-bound jacket with three handwritten lyrics and never-before-seen photos.\n\nSee the tracklist below.\n\nSide A\n\nFortnight (feat. Post Malone)\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department\n\nMy Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\n\nDown Bad\n\nSide B\n\nSo Long, London\n\nBut Daddy I Love Him\n\nFresh Out the Slammer\n\nFlorida!!! (Florence + the Machine)\n\nSide C\n\nGuilty as Sin?\n\nWho’s Afraid of Little Old Me?\n\nI Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)\n\nloml"
