        "text": "Sweden’s Armand Duplantis improved his own world record en route to retaining his pole vault title in the Paris Olympics 2024 on Monday.\n\nIn a sensational finish to the fifth day of track and field at the Stade de France, Duplantis sailed over the bar raised to 6.25 meters to rapturous applause from a 69,000-capacity crowd.\n\nIt bettered by 1cm his own previous best of 6.24m set at the Xiamen Diamond League meet in April. Remarkably it was the ninth time the US-born Swede had broken the record.\n\nREAD: Sweden’s Mondo Duplantis–pole vault’s invincible superstar\n\nIn the competition before the procession, American Sam Kendricks won silver with a best of 5.95m, Greece’s Emmanouil Karalis taking bronze (5.90) on countback. Philippines’ EJ Obiena, ranked world No. 2, wound up fourth.\n\nThe gold meant Duplantis became the first man to retain the pole vault title since American Bob Richards in 1952 and 1956.\n\nIt had been, he said, an “out-of-body experience.”\n\n“What can I say? I just broke a world record at the Olympics, the biggest possible stage for a pole vaulter,” said Duplantis.\n\nREAD: The difference between EJ Obiena and Mondo Duplantis\n\n“The biggest dream since a kid was to break the world record at the Olympics, and I’ve been able to do that in front of the most ridiculous crowd I’ve ever competed in front of.”\n\nAs soon as he crashed down on the landing mat after his third and final successful attempt at 6.25m, Duplantis bounced away on the track to embrace family and friends in the stands.\n\nDraped in the Swedish flag and with Abba’s “Dancing Queen” booming around the stadium, Duplantis made an emotional lap of the track.\n\nREAD: LIVE UPDATES: Team Philippines at Paris Olympics 2024 August 6\n\nThe music halted as he leaned down to ring the victory bell, capping yet another exceptional display from the irrepressible 24-year-old.\n\nCompetition opened in perfect, balmy conditions at 5.50 meters. Duplantis skipped that, all of his 11 opponents opting, successfully, to make an attempt.\n\nThe Swede came in at 5.70m, sailing over with no problem. He skipped 5.80m, by which time four athletes had dropped out.\n\nField narrowed\n\nDuplantis then cleared 5.85m in his second vault of the night by a considerable margin.\n\nKendricks followed suit, and the pair then went over at 5.95m.\n\nThat proved too much for the rest of the field as Australian Kurtis Marschall, Turkey’s Ersu Sasma, EJ Obiena of the Philippines and Karalis fell by the wayside.\n\nREAD: EJ Obiena apologizes for missing out on Paris Olympics medal\n\nKaralis took bronze on 5.90m countback from Obiena, but passed on 5.95.\n\nThe bar was raised to 6.00m. First up was Kendricks, but he brought down the bar. Duplantis followed and made no mistake, to the delight of a raucous crowd at France’s national stadium.\n\nKendricks had two more failures, leaving just Duplantis in the competition. The bar was immediately raised to 6.10m, which posed no problem for the Swede.\n\nThe crowd erupted as the in-track panels flashed up the next height: 6.25m, a world record mark.\n\nHis first effort was very close, catching the bar with his elbow. For his second attempt, Duplantis asked for the slow clap in unison made famous by supporters of Iceland’s football team.\n\nThere were no demands for the third, just total concentration.\n\n“I tried to clear my thoughts as much as I could,” Duplantis said. “The crowd was going crazy. It was so loud in there, it sounded like an American football game. I have a little bit of experience being in a 100,000-capacity stadium, but I was never the center of attention.\n\n“I was just trying to channel the energy everybody was giving me, and they were giving me a lot of it. It worked out.”\n\nAs he accelerated down the runway, yellow pole held aloft, the crowd bayed. Successfully planted, the pole flexed and up shot Duplantis, body bending so his feet went up first.\n\nThen came the explosion of delight, with another world record and a second Olympic gold bagged in a memorable night’s work.\n\nBut celebrations will not end there.\n\n“I started a tradition a few years ago, when Mondo (Duplantis) became so hard to beat,” said Kendricks. “The winner buys dinner. Mondo won by a lot tonight, so he’s going to buy us dinner.”\n\nDuplantis added: “The party is going to be pretty big. Not that much sleep, a lot of partying, a good time.”"
