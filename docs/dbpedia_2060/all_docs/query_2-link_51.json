        "text": "A Scottish woman has broken a sheep shearing world record in Cornwall.\n\nUna Cameron, aged 51, sheared 517 sheep at Trefranck Farm, in Launceston, on Wednesday beating the previous women's solo strongwool ewe record by 59 sheep.\n\nThe feat took place over a nine-hour period with Ms Cameron taking only four breaks.\n\nMs Cameron told BBC Radio Cornwall it was \"still a bit like a dream\" to hold a world record.\n\n\"A very painful dream but a dream - I don't think it's really sunk in yet,\" she said.\n\nMs Cameron, who was raising money for Blood Cancer UK in Cornwall and St Luke's Hospice, said it was a unique experience.\n\nShe said: \"Every shearer when they start shearing there's always a dream that there might be a world record somewhere and very few get the opportunity to do it and I was given the opportunity.\n\n\"It was quite painful but if you're going to wait until you're 51 to do stupid crazy things you can expect a bit of pain afterwards.\"\n\nOne of the organisers of the event Huw Condron, said Ms Cameron's attempt was the equivalent of \"running two marathons back to back\".He said: \"The fatigue obviously is a big thing when you're expending a lot of energy.\n\n\"Shearing 250 sheep is the equivalent of running a marathon, so what Una is looking to do today attempting to shear close to 500 or over, if possible, is like running two marathons back to back in nine hours.\"\n\nThe previous world record was set in February by Sacha Bond who sheared 458 ewes in nine hours.\n\nWhen asked how she was feeling partway through the competition, Ms Cameron told the BBC she felt \"tired\"."
