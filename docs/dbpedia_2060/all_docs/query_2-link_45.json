        "text": "Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant has cemented his place in United States basketball history by becoming the all-time leading scorer for the national team in the Olympics. The NBA superstar surpassed the previous record held by WNBA legend Lisa Leslie during the Americans’ quarterfinal game against Brazil on Tuesday.\n\nDurant’s basket with 3:06 left in the third quarter gave him six points in the game and a total of 489 points in his four Olympic appearances. Leslie had scored 488 points across her four Olympic campaigns, which included four gold medals.\n\nThe 35-year-old Durant is bidding to become the first men’s player to win four Olympic gold medals, having been part of the U.S. teams that triumphed in London 2012, Rio 2016, and the Tokyo Games held three years ago.\n\nThe NBA star’s longevity and dedication to the national team have been key factors in his historic achievement. He is one of only five U.S. players with at least 300 points in Olympic competition, joining the likes of Leslie, Diana Taurasi, Carmelo Anthony, and LeBron James.\n\nAs he continues his pursuit of a fourth gold medal, Durant’s legacy as one of the greatest Olympic basketball players of all time is cemented. His record-breaking performance serves as a testament to his unparalleled skill and unwavering commitment to representing the United States on the global stage.\n\nLeBron James’ Message To Kevin Durant After Record-Breaking Feat at the Olympics\n\nAfter Team USA’s win over Brazil, various personalities congratulated Durant for his achievement, including Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry. For his part, Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James also sent out a message for his teammate in the Olympics, as seen in a screenshot grabbed from his social media account.\n\nApart from his new record at the Olympics, Durant has built himself as one of the best players to ever step onto an NBA court. Among his accomplishments are two championships, two Finals MVPs, one regular season MVP, Rookie of the Year in 2008, four scoring titles, and 14 All-Star Game selections, among others.\n\nEven at his age and all the injuries he has recovered from, Durant is still out there playing great basketball. If all goes well, the Suns star will get to add another gold medal to his resume down the line.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
