        "text": "Jamaican sprinting legend Veronica Campbell Brown, one of the most decorated athletes in the history of track and field, was recently honored with a series of prestigious awards at a ceremony in New York. The event, which celebrated Campbell Brown’s incredible contributions to the sport, saw her receive accolades from various prominent figures and organizations.\n\nCampbell Brown, who won gold in the 200m at the 2004 Athens Olympics and successfully defended her title at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, was recognized by the Jamaica Independence Foundation (JIFI) with the Trailblazer and Sports Icon Award. This recognition highlights her role as a pioneer and inspiration for countless athletes in Jamaica and around the world.\n\nIn addition to the honours from JIFI, Campbell Brown was awarded a Proclamation from United States Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke, a Proclamation from New York State Senator Kevin S. Parker, and a Certification of Recognition from Mayor Eric Adams on behalf of the City of New York. These awards underscore her impact not only on the track but also as a cultural ambassador for Jamaica.\n\nReflecting on the ceremony, Campbell Brown expressed her gratitude for the recognition. \"It was an honour to be recognized by the Jamaica Independence Foundation and the State of New York through several prestigious awards. It was a great night spent with a group of distinguished individuals,\" she shared.\n\nCampbell Brown's illustrious career is marked by numerous achievements, including becoming the first Jamaican to win a global 100m title at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan. Her legacy as a trailblazer in sprinting continues to inspire new generations of athletes, and these awards serve as a testament to her enduring influence in the world of sports.\n\nThe ceremony in New York not only celebrated Campbell Brown’s athletic achievements but also her contributions to the broader community, both in Jamaica and internationally. As she continues to be recognized for her outstanding career, Campbell Brown remains a shining example of excellence and dedication in the world of athletics.\n\nSo it was in the beginning, so it is at the end.\n\nJamaica’s bad luck at the Paris Olympic Games, particularly on the female side, again reared its ugly head as the country’s quartet suffered a mishap in the 4x400m relay final and failed to finish at the Stade de France on Saturday.\n\nWith Shanieka Ricketts’ silver medal in the triple jump being the only medal won by a female athlete among Jamaica's six medals tallied ahead of the much-anticipated curtain call relays, the quartet of Stacey-Ann Williams, Andrenette Knight, Shiann Salmon, and Stephanie Ann McPherson would have hoped to end the athletics segment on a high.\n\nHowever, it was not to be, as Knight, while in second position on the second leg, had the baton knocked from her hand by an Irish athlete, and as the instrument clattered on the track, so did the country’s hopes of a medal.\n\nMcPherson shared the team's disappointment.\n\n\"I don't know what happened; I watched the replay three times before I realised what happened, but it was like World Relays all over again. So, of course, we are disappointed. We all trained really hard for this,\" an emotional McPherson said, her eyes filled with tears.\n\nSalmon tried to put on a brave face.\n\n\"My face might not be showing it but I am very heartbroken. The aim was to finish on the podium, and I am sure that everybody is disheartened that we didn't even get to finish the race, but sometimes things happen that we have no control over, and we have to just move on from them. The overall (Olympic) experience for me was excellent; I can't complain about it. I got two lifetime bests in this championship, and I thank God I finished healthy, so I am just looking forward to the rest of the season,\" Salmon shared.\n\nThe event was won by the United States with an Area Record of 3:15.27, just shy of the longstanding 3:15.17 World Record. The Netherlands, through a blistering anchor leg from Femke Bol, took second in a National Record of 3:19.50, while Great Britain also clocked a National Record of 3:19.72 for third.\n\nWhile the disappointment of a majority of Jamaica’s athletes and fans alike will be profound, after the legendary Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson suffered injuries ahead of their events and Ackera Nugent clipped a few obstacles, which ruined her chance at a medal in the women's 100m hurdles final, among other misfortunes, the country still had much to celebrate.\n\nRajindra Campbell won an historic bronze in the men’s shot put; Kishane Thompson copped silver in the men’s 100m; Wayne Pinnock was also a silver medallist in the long jump; and Rasheed Broadbell won bronze in the men’s 110m hurdles.\n\nBut the biggest accomplishment of the Games came for discus thrower Roje Stona, who achieved an Olympic record to land Jamaica’s solitary gold medal on his debut at the global multi-sport showpiece."
