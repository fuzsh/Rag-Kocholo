Dance music icon The Blessed Madonna has announced her long-awaited debut album, Godspeed â€“ set to be released on October 11. To coincide with the news, she's shared the title track, featuring DJ E-Clyps.

The 24-track project also features collaborations with James Vincent McMorrow, Joy Crookes, and Kylie Minogue (who of course stars at Electric Picnic in a couple of weeks time) among many others.

The American DJ and producer describes Godspeed as "the end of a journey and the beginning."

"After nearly a year in lockdown, when I signed the paperwork and knew that I was going to be allowed to make this album, I called my dad in Kentucky to tell him the good news," she says. "He could not contain his pride and in a way his relief. I was going to be ok. He says it better than I do at the beginning of the record. I lost him suddenly just weeks before the first session, but his voice will live in Godspeed forever, and make a million more journeys to everyone who hears it."
