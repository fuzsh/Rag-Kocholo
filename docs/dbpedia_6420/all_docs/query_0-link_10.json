        "text": "There had been several attempts to make films based on Rolfe Boldrewood's 1888 novel since the bushranging ban by the New South Wales government in 1912. In particular there were attempts by Stanley Crick in 1916 and Alfred Rolfe in 1918. However Kenneth Brampton managed to secure permission for this 1920 version, mostly likely because it stressed the moral lessons of the story.[7]\n\nKenneth Brampton and actress Tien Hogue managed to persuade the mining magnate Pearson Tewksbury to raise the budget and act as producer.[3]\n\nBrampton was acting in the play Lightnin' which he left to make the film.[8]\n\nThe film was shot on location at Braidwood and in the Araluen Valley near Canberra. The bushrangers the Clarke brothers reportedly worked in this region.[9][10]\n\nRenowned horseman \"Top\" Hassall doubled for Brampton on the horse riding scenes.[11]\n\nFuture director Charles Chauvel was working around the Sydney studios and attending to horses on the film. He has a bit part."
