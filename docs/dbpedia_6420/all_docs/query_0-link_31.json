        "text": "Alexander Baron was an author and screenwriter whose most acclaimed works captured and reflected his real-life experiences of warfare and the grittier aspects of life in London in the early 20th century. He was born Joseph Alexander Bernstein on 4 December 1917 in Maidenhead, but his family moved to Hackney a short time later. His father was a Polish-Jewish immigrant who originally settled in London in 1908 and eventually changed the family name to Baron; Alexander formally adopted the new surname in 1948.\n\nBaron was a politically active man during the 1930s. He helped organise the Labour League of Youth, a group tied to the Communist Party of Great Britain, to campaign against fascism in the East End, and he edited the Young Communist League magazine, Challenge. However, Baron became increasingly disenchanted with far-left politics following the Hitler-Stalin Pact in August 1939 and broke ties with the Communist party following the end of World War II.\n\nIn the final months of 1939, Baron enlisted in the British Army and served in the Pioneer Corps. He was among the first Allied troops to land in Sicily during the Italian campaign and in Normandy on D-Day. He was injured towards the end of the war and was transferred as an instructor to a British Army training camp in Northern Ireland in 1945. He finally returned to London in 1946 and became the editor of the journal New Theatre.\n\nBaron published his first and most acclaimed novel, From the City, From the Plough, in 1948. This book depicts the events leading up to D-Day and the Normandy campaign, and it is clear Baron drew from his personal experiences fighting on the front lines when writing this work. His military service and time as an instructor informed the themes of his other war-based novels, including There’s No Home (1950) and The Human Kind (1953).\n\nBaron’s novels explored a number of themes, such as the relationship and place of the individual in society, relations between men and women, and aspects of London life. His most prevalent book about London was The Lowlife (1963) which explores the underground society of London’s East End.\n\nIn addition to his novels, Baron wrote film, television and radio scripts. He served as a regular writer on the BBC’s Play for Today, A Family at War series and drama programmes such as Poldark. He also wrote adaptions of literary classics such as Oliver Twist, Jane Eyre and Vanity Fair. In 1992, Baron was elected an Honorary Fellow of Queen Mary, University of London, in recognition of his contribution to the historical and social understanding of East London.\n\nOn 4 August 1960, Baron married Delores Lopes-Salzedo (1928-2012?), an advertising copywriter. They had one son. Alexander Baron passed away on 6 December 1999.\n\nArchive Collection\n\nReference: MS 5126 Date: 1935-2001 Extent: approx. 60 boxes\n\nThis collection contains the papers of Alexander Baron, including his memoirs, published novels, unpublished novels and notes, scripts of television adaptations and plays, radio plays and film scripts.\n\nThe first section of the collection contains notes, drafts and a few correspondences relating to Baron’s works.
