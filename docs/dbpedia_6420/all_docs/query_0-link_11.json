        "text": "December 8, 2013\n\nPrevious rating 4 stars\n\nGoing through my bookshelves doing the annual clean up, as you do, I came across my well worn copy of Robbery Under Arms (one of the few novels I will never 'clean out'). I got to thinking, what rating did I give this and did I ever review it. So on here I come, to see a 4 star rating and no review of one of my all time favourite Australian classics. Up it goes to 5 stars, followed by a review.\n\nI have read this story from cover to cover 3 times. It is a slow paced story in its essence. The reason for this being that in order to immerse oneself in the good old Australian way of live before the turn of the 20th Century one must enjoy the bush life. Bush rangers, cattle thieves and of course, those upright and tight citizens of colonial times. The description is unlike that of anything you will read today because being written in 1888 the Australia as we know it did not exist. Hence the slow pace. Life was slow then compared to now. This does not make it boring by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nBased on the Marston family and their progression from the life of farmers to that of highway men, this story craftily intertwines them with Captain Starlight. When published in the newspapers, in installments, Browne (Bolderwood) had characterised Starlight and Co. to a point where the public thought him and them real. This was due to his first hand experience with bush rangers. It is this real life experience that comes through, grabs you and sucks you into the story to such a level that you can vividly picture settings, characters and plot line or you just damn well want to be there!\n\nI am all for this becoming a set text in the classroom once again!\n\nNovember 3, 2018\n\nFor a story about bushrangers this sure was boring. Also racist and sexist, even for the time period it was written in. I believe at one point the narrator says that women need to be starved like dogs to appreciate what they have. Also apparently women are only capable of experiencing two emotions while men are much more complex. No thanks.\n\nMay 30, 2016\n\nMy impression of Robbery Under Arms is one of appreciation that such a book exists. Boldrewood (or Browne, as that was his actual name) captures the setting and spirit of colonial Australia during the middle of the 19th Century, as it happened. The book captures the feeling of that remote colony and his writing captures the dialect of a people that worked apart from the Old World to make Australia their home.\n\nFrom there, there is a feeling of kinship that grows from the similarities that exist between the history of the American West and those of this then-distant land. This book is filled with cattle, ranchers, horses, towns, cowboys, ranges and mountains. Had the story been set in Oklahoma the spirit these things would have changed very little. But while the actions that drive this book could have been written by Elmore Leonard or Zane Grey, they weren't. This book, through-and-through, is uniquely Australian.\n\nThe central theme gives rise to considerations of justice. Does the doling out of punishment that simply fits the crime, regardless of circumstances, truly balance the scales held in the hand of justice? Or are the scales held aloft as a distraction for that other item she holds in her other hand? Society controls punishment and those outside of society have little say in it's application. Thus, mercy is more of a man-made miracle with respect to just punishment and the finger of society forever rests upon the scales.\n\nThe tone of the book is truly sincere. It's no spoiler to say that the story is told from the first-person perspective of a condemned man and from his narrative the reader grows to understand this man's path towards his fate. The narration is matter-of-fact and deliberately avoids gimmicks such as mystery, suspense, and over-played action. This approach allows the reader to focus on the acts and circumstances of the characters and to better understand the story of the condemned.\n\nOctober 28, 2021\n\nFor all his cross doings, Dick Marston will be hanged in a month.\n\nDie--die--yes, die; be strung up like a dog, as they say. I'm blessed if ever I did know of a dog being hanged, though, if it comes to that, a shot or a bait generally makes an end of 'em in this country. Ha, ha! Did I laugh? What a rum thing it is that a man should have a laugh in him when he's only got twenty-nine days more to live--a day for every year of my life.\n\nDick has ruined many lives besides his own. There is enough adventure in this book for 10 westerns. In addition to the crimes and getaways, Dick often ruminates on his life. His ruminations are an odd mixture of fatalism, regret, and solipsism.\n\nApril 2, 2018\n\nTo enjoy this book, read a chapter a week. That's about a pleasant pace. Put it down often and really try to imagine the society sights, the sounds, and even the smells.\n\nDon't rush it, don't obsess, I've cost myself some sweet dreams by slogging it out. Not that that was my original intention, my mind changed after finding the story content contemptibly familiar. I wish the author had written more about music, how that was back 150 years beyond my imagination.\n\nNot the best aussie book I've read, The Amazing Life & Adventures of William Buckley takes that trophy.\n\nA novel in the Social Realist style (I reckon). Ironically, it is less realistic for the effort. Depictions of attitudes are rather expressions of platitudes, those lonely souls in the bush who take to drink to escape the boredom rarely reflect upon themselves as they are drinking, as lonely souls in the bush who took to drink to escape boredom. When they drink wouldn't it be sex & violence on their minds? To be clear, the honest effort really does come out of these pages, wildlife and customs, sounds and societies of the gold-fields and such-like are encompassed in the effort by Mr. Boldrewood to describe the totality of his experience.\n\nTwo major crimes are covered, let me now share these two delightful pieces of Australiana. The first is the theft of 1,000 cattle. This is an approximate number, and the convicts who undertook this act of villainy were captured & convicted by evidence in the form of a white bull. Mr. Boldrewood seems to have a over-balanced view of the crime, tar on all and targets for all. The second crime, is the robbery of the bank. The real equivalent was the Kelly Gang, who first bound all the local police before robbing the bank and perhaps had a few beers at the town's public house before departing.\n\nMay 1, 2019\n\nUnexpectedly wonderful! I just adored this book about the exploits and fates of a group of bushrangers in New South Wales in mid-nineteenth century Australia. I found the characters, the story, the portrayal of colonial Australia and the language of the time mesmerising.\n\nThe bulk of the action takes place around 1851 and is narrated by the central character Dick Marston while he is in gaol awaiting death by hanging. From the beginning you know that Dick ends up a condemned man and from there he tells the story of the events that led to that fate.\n\nI found the characters to be wonderfully written and they felt real to me. I cared about them and kept hoping against all probability that things would turn out right for them. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time that I read this book, fearing that at any minute Dick, his brother Jim and the leader of the gang of outlaws - Starlight - would meet their fates. I found the ending highly satisfying as well.\n\nThis book is a wonderful insight into Australia at this time in its history and I highly recommend it.\n\nMay 28, 2019\n\n\"Robbery under arms is a bushranger novel by Thomas Alexander Browne, published under his pseudonym Rolf Boldrewood, It was first published in serialized form by The Sydney Mail between July 1882 and August 1883, then in three volumes in London in 1888. It was abridged into a single volume in 1889 as part of Macmillan's one-volume Colonial Library series and has not been out of print since.\" (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbe... 28 May 2019)\n\nIn this famous Australian novel, a young man, Dick Marston, who has been condemned to hang, writes down the sorry tale of his drift into crime and outlawry. This is a ripping yarn of cattle-duffing (rustling, in American parlance), gaol-breaking, bank robbery, highway robbery, and audacious confidence trickery, leavened with a good deal of Dick's rather monotonous lamentation of the poor choices he has made in his life. Marston's partners in crime are an English gentleman known as Captain Starlight, Starlight's sinister aboriginal servant Warrigal, Dick's decent but haplessly loyal brother Jim, and his reprobate father, a transported Lincolnshire poacher, every single one of them a consummate bushman and horseman.\n\nAn important challenge, for a novelist constructing a narrative from the point of view of a felon, is to engage the sympathy of normally law-abiding readers, to make the reader's guilty pleasure in audacious crime feel less guilty. Boldrewood's chief protagonists, though outlaws, are constructed according to approved 19th-century norms of masculine virtue: Starlight is every inch a gentleman, by birth and in his conduct; the Marston brothers, though of more humble origins, are presented as young men of thoroughly decent feelings and character. Masculinity is constructed in a very conventional way; courage, fortitude, honour, and chivalry. The notion of chivalry informs all relations, good and bad, between the sexes. Young men may fall in love, but there is nary a whiff of actual sex anywhere in the narrative. The conduct of even the worst of men in the presence of women appears pretty tame: when Moran, Burke, and Daly hold the Whitman women at gunpoint, the boorish Moran at first confines himself to compelling the eldest Miss Whitman to play the piano and sing, while he and his companions drink themselves into a stupor; later when Moran, demanding a dance from Miss Falkland, puts his arm around her, he crosses a line beyond which Boldrewood will not permit him to go, and Jim gallantly rescues her, knocking Moran's head so hard against a wall that he falls down unconscious.\n\nWhile readers may wink at cattle-duffing, gaol-breaking, and tying up bank-clerks and troopers at gunpoint, it is more difficult to deflect the gravity of murder. The survivors of the bounty hunters who have come close to discovering the Marston Gang's life-saving bolt-hole, the Terrible Hollow, are killed in cold blood by Dan Moran (who remains unaware of what he is protecting). Though Starlight and the Marstons are tainted in the eyes of the public by this crime, only Marston senior was actually there. The murder of Sergeant Hawkins is quite a different case. The robbery of the Turon Goldfield escort began with an ambush; many shots were fired and Sergeant Hawkins, who was driving the wagon, was shot dead in the first volley. Dick later rationalizes the killing: \"We were all sorry for Sergeant Hawkins, and would have been better pleased if he'd been only wounded like the others. But these sorts of things couldn't be helped. It was the fortune of war; his luck this time, ours next.\" His justification is that, as outlaws, the gang are at war, and combatants are licensed to kill enemy combatants by whatever means serve that end. I don't buy it. This is cold-blooded murder, and grievous bodily harm to the troopers who weren't killed. Nobody was forced to fire on the escort. I know nothing of the revisions which were made between the original serialized Robbery under Arms and the single-volume 1889 edition, but I'd place a small bet that the scene at the Turon Goldfields (which is never really explained), in which Moran fixes his gaze on the trooper (a sergeant) driving the escort wagon, was added later to suggest to the reader that Hawkins' murderer is Moran: \"As for Moran, we could see him fix his eyes upon the sergeant who was driving, and look at him as if he could look right through him. He never took his eyes off him the whole time, but glared at him like a maniac\". Thus the Marstons and Captain Starlight are exculpated in the mind of the reader, and they remain acceptably wholesome characters for whom allowances may be made.\n\nHigh adventure has been an almost exclusively masculine affair in English-language fiction until quite recently, so it is to Boldrewood's credit that there are so many women in the novel, some of them quite strong and active characters. Aileen Marston, sister of Dick and Jim, works the family farm, rides well, knows her own mind, and is capable of making bold decisions; while I suspect some feminists will deplore the fate that the novel assigns to her, it is plausibly a fate of her own choosing, given her background and the times, and in no sense an emblematic punishment for presumptuous agency. Women within the Marston circle, with the single exception of Kate (explicitly presented as a bad lot), have hearts of gold and are unfailingly loyal to their menfolk. When men and women relax together, they mostly sing around the piano and make jolly banter. I suspect that English readers of Robbery under Arms would have found these colonial women attractively free of airs and pretense.\n\nThe novel's single indigenous character is not sympathetically presented, always seething with ill-concealed hostility to the Marston brothers. His name, Warrigal, is a Dharuk (Eora) word meaning \"wild dingo\", but which in Australian English may be loosely applied to wild horses, wild dogs, wild men, or even uncultivated plants (Tetragonia tetragonoides a.k.a. warrigal greens). The parallel between Starlight's servant Warrigal and Marston senior's dog Crib is not easily missed; both are reckoned to have a more than common degree of intelligence and initiative (\"sagacity\" was once a popular word for such qualities in an animal), both suffer occasional harsh beatings at the hands of their master, and both are loyal to the point of adoration. I don't think I'm stretching a point if I state that Warrigal is presented as an intelligent and useful working animal, like Crib. Apart from Warrigal, Australian indigenous people exist in the novel only as trackers assisting the police. Boldrewood was a man of his time.\n\nThe adventures and escapes of the Marston Gang make very entertaining reading, and Dick Marston's narrative voice, while sometimes a little quaint, carries the tale along well. The gentleman highwayman may seem a bit of a cliché, but perhaps it wasn't so when this was written. It is no surprise that Robbery under Arms has never been out of print. It's a thoroughly enjoyable adventure story with a range of well-drawn bush characters, and town ones too. If it's a bit operatic in places, I won't knock it for that. If you're looking for a cracking good adventure story, this is hard to beat.\n\nMay 19, 2014\n\nI have been travelling solo the last few days and took along this CD audio abridged edition for the long 7 hour drive to Albury NSW. What a treat this turned out to be and for a bit of serendipity the story is set around the very area that I travelled and then stayed. The Snowy Mountains provides beautiful scenery with its stark and rocky landscape and I could imagine Captain Starlight and his bushrangers riding through the hills on their many adventures and escapades. Actor John Stanton provides the narration and delivers a very lively rendition of this classic Australian story.\n\nAugust 16, 2014\n\nThis is a beaut Aussie tale of bold, bad bushrangers which reads surprisingly well for its age. See http://anzlitlovers.wordpress.com/200...\n\nFebruary 4, 2015\n\nA great work of Australian writing. Filled with adventure and is also a moral story.\n\nApril 23, 2023\n\nI really enjoyed this old-fashioned tale set in the mid-1800s in colonial Australia with adventures in bushranging and goldmining. The story explores themes of family, pursuit of adventure versus the 'settled' life, and the nature of justice in a surprisingly sophisticated manner. I really liked the way the book captured the Australian landscape, everyday life, as well as the customs and language of people at that time, noting that it was first published in the 1880's. The book is over 400 pages, and times I found it a little slow, particularly some of the introspection of the protagonist. However, there was real value in spending time working through his musings and reflections on choices rather than just focusing on the 'what happens next' elements of the story. The characters were well developed, credible and engaging and the adventures and action parts of the story were handled well, and not 'over-dramatised'. The simple language and authentic tone made this an easy and enjoyable read.\n\nApril 2, 2021\n\nThis is a long story told by a protagonist on death row who deserved to be where he was. The story is deliberately rough in its language, and is complex, human and credible. The characterisation is convincing with variety and intrigue, with few stereotypes, which that era was understandably prone to. I learnt a fair bit about early Australian (European) life. I note one reviewer disliked \"sexist\" passages, however, if the story, told by a dark character in Victorian times, had displayed modern egalitarian views it would have totally lacked credibility. Genteel readers beware. The end was relatively long giving the author plenty of time to blow it and spoil the book, but he didn't, and produced an ending that stirred me at least.\n\nDecember 4, 2020\n\nI love this book. I read it many years ago, and thinking about it still fills me with warmth, as the characters are so enjoyable to read. Although, it is sometimes a dark story, set in a bleak Australian world, where cattle rustling is a part of everyday life, and so has many obvious dangers attached.\n\nA very gripping book.\n\nNovember 29, 2022\n\nTold in a colloquial and Australian manner, which perfectly suited the time and theme of the story, giving a very authentic feel. The tale was gripping and exciting from start to finish, driven by a strong plot.\n\nI found myself becoming attached to the main characters, and while the final shootout was occurring my heart was in my throat - definitely the sign of a great book.\n\nMay 21, 2024\n\nThis is classic Australian literature in its finest form. Follows the life of Dick Morton, captain starlight, Jim Morton and their father Ben.\n\nWritten around the 1860s, it’s stylist typical of the period. In spite of its age, the story is riveting and reflective of the era.\n\nDeathly a worthwhile read.\n\nJune 22, 2020\n\nWell, that was a long, slow, gruelling read. A classic of Australian literature, yes, but slow going, and written in an almost incomprehensible dialect. I ended up learning a lot about Australian dialects and bushrangers' cant in the process.\n\nAugust 23, 2021\n\nWhat a fantastic book!!! A fast paced story of Bushrangers - stealing, holding up coaches, etc. And set in the local area where I live. Which made it all the more interesting to read. Highly recommended.\n\nJuly 8, 2022\n\nEnjoyed the book and its tales of bushrangers in the late 1800's, but the book was long, long, long with repetitive tales of close-calls with the police and subsequent escapes to their hideaway valley. It could have done with some editing to trim it down.\n\nJuly 13, 2023\n\nLoved the sweeping saga of the writing. Language is dated and some references would be unacceptable today. The redemptive tones are interesting as are the enduring bonds of family and friendship. Recommended for those who like classics. Reminded me of LORNA DOONE.\n\nDecember 10, 2021\n\nDon't think this is so dated that it's not worth reading. Much of formative Australia is on show. It's well-written and introspective. Much worthwhile here on the Australian character.\n\nDecember 10, 2023\n\nThis was a very long read, and I almost gave up.\n\nIf you are struggling, it is worth remembering this was originally printed a chapter at a time, so it was helpful to read at chapter increments\n\nJuly 21, 2024\n\nTrue to form. Cowboy culture down under and a good story to boot.\n\nSeptember 8, 2020\n\nRobbery Under Arms by Rolf Boldrewood\n\nAt the young age of 29 Dick Marston is sitting in Sydney jail 29 days away from being hung for “robbery under arms” and “bush ranging”, for holding up a convoy carrying bullion from the goldfields during which a policeman is killed. Books have helped him come to terms with his imprisonment, but they have also brought home to him the life he could have had if he had not ended up living a life of crime. So he decides to write an account of his life because “maybe it’ll save some other young chap from pulling back like a colt when he’s first roped, , setting himself against everything in the way of proper breaking, making a fool of himself and generally choking himself down as I have done.” Originally published in 1888 in serial form the book is a real page turner, richly evoking pioneer Australian life.\n\nDick’s father, Ben Marston, had been transported to Australia for poaching but once he had been released from servitude he obtained some land in the bush of New South Wales, built a hut by a creek for his wife Norah and their growing family and began to farm cattle. Dick is the oldest and he is joined by a brother Jim, two years later and a sister Aillen four years later. In deference to his wife’s Roman Catholicism ben allows her to raise Aileen as a Catholic while the two boys are raised Protestant like their father. By the time they are teenagers the boys have become stockmen running the farm during their father’s frequent long absences. They did receive six years of education because the publican in the nearest village hired a teacher for his six children and invited all the other local children to participate but this ends when the teacher dies and is not replaced.\n\nThe sons sense that people pity them for having the father they do even though they don’t really understand why, but they do begin to question the origin of some of the cattle their father brings with him on his visits home. What makes this book so enthralling is that as Dick grows up there are so many points when a different choice would have kept him on the straight and narrow or would have enabled him to get back onto an honest path. Dick realizes that his father must be a rustler, but his father does not pull him into his criminal business. It’s more that Dick wants to connect with his father, to know him and his world and so, reluctantly at first, his father takes him to the secret valley where he and the gang hide stolen cattle and horses and re-brand them before driving them to distant markets for sale.\n\nThat initial experience is exhilarating. They make camp in a cave and their father provides “the best meal I’ve ever tasted since I was born.” But now Dick looks back bitterly at this as the turning point when he turned away from working to achieve stability and raise a family instead of going after easy money and a good time. He also told himself in the beginning that he was just helping his father out temporarily, that “I could draw back in time, just after I tackle this job.” It is in the secret valley that he first meets” Captain Starlight”, the charismatic leader of the rustlers. The captain urges the boys not to follow their father but to go back home and lead an honest life before it is too late.\n\nCaptain Starlight is just one of the characters in the novel who seek to put the boys back on an honest track. From time to time they get real jobs as sheep shearers and stockmen and when they work in the gold fields, they make good money. But their outlaw past is always about to catch up with them or at least they believe it is. Dick and Jim dream of leaving Australia and making a new start far away, but it never quite works out despite the best efforts of people who know the good side of them and would do anything to save them.\n\nThis book is a real page turner. The author, Ralph Boldrewood (real name Thomas Alexander Browne), came to Australia as a child and grew up to run a large farm in Queensland for several years. He worked in the gold fields as a cop and then a commissioner. His love of the outback lifestyle and the untamed landscape, and his years in the goldfields is evident in his writing which encompassed short stories, memoirs and over 20 serialized novels. He was writing at a time when there was an enormous appetite among readers for books that celebrated bush life and the strength and stoicism of the people who were exploiting what Australia had to offer. His descriptions of the landscape and the people draw you in, the characters like Captain Starlight, sister Ailene who never gave up on them, half-caste Warrigal and their wiry determined mother make this a fascinating book even before you experience their dramatic exploits and narrow, mostly, escapes.\n\nA very good read!\n\nDecember 14, 2018\n\nIt isn't spectacular, but I enjoyed reading it. A fairly simple tale of a rural boy going down the path of a criminal, but who finds redemption in the end (at great cost). The writing itself is also simple, but it fits the setting and the characters involved, and it's fun finding old Australian slang this many centuries later.\n\nThe book has a bit of a problem with its morality, I think - specifically, when it wants to apply it. It dances between castigating the main characters (the Marston brothers, their father, and the leader of their gang of bushrangers, Starlight) and singing their praises. They're criminals, but they don't do the really bad stuff. The newspapers praise how well-mannered they are after having killed policemen in shootouts, and there's a running theme of 'playing fair' with the police with the implication that it makes it more above board. The book also becomes ambivalent about the cause of their criminal downfall - whether they were forced into it by obligation to friends and family, whether they had a choice at every step and made the wrong one, or whether it was inherently built into them to become rough types or not.\n\nI also found the story of the protagonist's brother, Jim Marston, pretty frustrating. He is essentially used as the punching bag for the story to punish the protagonist's more impulsive actions, and is dragged along and has his life destroyed, each time essentially in reaction to Dick's own choices. It ended up feeling contrived and and cruel, but that may have been the point.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nNovember 23, 2012\n\nThis is a deceptively small volume, hardy and ideal to take travelling, very much in keeping with its subject matter. The style may seem long-winded to the modern reader, and it is definitely a product of its time. Thomas Wood's introduction picks up on some of its shortcomings, chiefly the author's tendency to moralise through his protagonist, but that strangely provides another point of interest: the study of a man who chooses a path he knows to be wrong, and self-defeating. In fact the author captures very well the inconsistencies that exist within our human nature, the inner conflicts that we deal with either by suppression or distraction, transference or projection or a myriad of other defences, and rarely find resolution for. And this is something he applies across the cast of characters. Noone's goodness guarantees their happiness, and noone's moral failings guarantee their downfall. Life, as it is protrayed in these pages, is difficult and complicated, full of choice but also strangely constricted too. So it is a book that is hard, compelling and enjoyable that raises many questions. It would make an excellent film too, if done well. I have got a lot more out of it than I expected and I hope it travels widely and gives enjoyment and food for thought for many more readers.\n\nNovember 23, 2012\n\nThis is a deceptively small volume, hardy and ideal to take travelling, very much in keeping with its subject matter.
