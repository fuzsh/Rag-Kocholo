        "text": "'Miss Lily Dampier, Mr. Alfred Rolfe, and other artists carry on the action of the bushranging story, in which are several exciting pictures of horses at racing speed flying over logs and streams in rough country. In the elaborate series of clearly screened pictures taken by the Lyceum staff the situations revealed open at the home of the Marstons, passes on to an exciting race for the Gold Cup, won by Rainbow, shows how the bushrangers stick up the mail coach at the Rocky Rises, and exhibits Sir Ferdinand Morringer threatened with death in Terrible Hollow at the hands of the brutal Dan Moran, and his rescue by Starlight. One of the most applauded of the scenes last night was the burning of the stables and the rescue of the horses, and Starlight's Last Stand also excited enthusiasm.'"
