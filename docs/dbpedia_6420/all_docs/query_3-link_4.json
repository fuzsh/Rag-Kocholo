        "text": "The symptoms of dementia often cause a feeling of insecurity. For example, memory loss may lead to worry about forgetting an appointment while visual-spatial problems can make people feel lost or disoriented even when they are in a familiar place. Having less ability to cope with stress, people with dementia often become dependent on their caregiver to help them manage their emotions. The caregiver may become the person’s “anchor,” or the person they trust who helps them feel secure. The person with dementia might follow or “shadow” the caregiver wherever they go, call the caregiver several times a day on the phone, or ask repeated questions over and over again. They may feel threatened and become agitated when their caregiver feels tired and acts frustrated, or impatient, or when the caregiver tries to ignore them. Similarly, they may become worried and agitated when they cannot find their caregiver, even for a moment. For example, if the person with dementia cannot see or hear their caregiver, they might wander away looking for them and get lost.\n\nThis table offers some ideas for helping the person with dementia feel secure. If their anxiety is very distressing or puts their safety at risk, their doctor should be consulted to see if medication might help. Antidepressants are generally safe and can help soften anxiety. Stronger medications like benzodiazepines or antipsychotics have more side effects, although, in some situations, the benefits of the medication outweigh the potential harm.\n\nIF\n\nTHEN\n\nThe person is following you around and getting worried or agitated when they cannot see or hear you.\n\nReduce clutter and background noise that may make the environment disorienting for the person.\n\nSet up a “control station” near their favorite chair. Make sure they have a snack, some water, an activity or two (e.g., book, puzzle, craft), and any other security objects they prefer (e.g., phone, stuffed animal, purse).\n\nConsider if the person may need more help or supervision than you are able to provide. Try starting a day program or hiring in-home help. It may take some time but the person will likely adjust to it.\n\nReassure the person with a calm tone of voice.\n\nThe person is asking the same questions repeatedly or seeking frequent reassurance\n\nRemind yourself that the person is not doing this on purpose. They have short-term memory loss or a short attention span and they are doing the best they can.\n\nUse a hearing aid or voice amplifier if hearing loss is an issue.\n\nAvoid using an annoyed or mocking tone of voice as this is likely to make the person feel defensive.\n\nThink of a script that you can repeat without having to think about it. For example:\n\nThat was a lovely breakfast (lunch/dinner). Will you help me rinse the dishes?\n\nIt was fun talking with you about that silly cat. I will call you again tomorrow morning. Have a nice time at bingo this afternoon.\n\nTry to use a matter-of-fact tone of voice. Use humor if you find that the person responds well to it.\n\nLimit the amount of information you give the person if more information will cause them to worry. For example, you might wait to tell the person about a doctor’s appointment until it is almost time to get ready to go.\n\nTry to set up a predictable and consistent daily routine for the person. This will help them maintain function and know what to expect.\n\nIf the person lives in a facility, consider setting up a scheduled time to call or visit them each day.\n\nKeeping a calendar or written daily schedule may be helpful for some people and for others it may cause more confusion.\n\nGiving the person something to do may distract them from worrying. Often people want to be helpful, try to find simple chores they can help with routinely.\n\nRegular exercise may be another outlet for nervous energy.\n\nPeople with dementia may use your emotions as cues for their own. For example, if you are anxious and worried, they may become anxious and worried. Take a deep breath and try to stay calm.\n\nThe person becomes so distressed they are inconsolable\n\nTake a deep breath and do your best to stay calm yourself.\n\nReduce background noise (turn off television) and dim any bright lights if possible.\n\nSometimes it helps to have another familiar person, like a neighbor or relative call or visit to distract and reassure the person.\n\nArguing with the person or trying to physically restrain them is likely to make the situation worse.\n\nIf there is any immediate threat of danger to the person or anyone else, call 911.\n\nContact the person’s doctor to make an urgent appointment to rule out an underlying medical cause and consider pharmacologic treatment.\n\nIf you are at the end of your rope and need help figuring out what to do at any time day or night, call the Alzheimer’s Association’s 24/7 Helpline at 1.800.272.3900.\n\nIf the person responds well to affection, consider holding their hand, giving them a hug, or rubbing their back.\n\nConsider distracting the person with their favorite food treat like ice cream or chocolate.\n\nSometimes people feel calmer when riding in the car or going for a walk. Make sure you bring a cell phone just in case you end up needing to call for help to keep the person safe.\n\nApathy, or indifference, is defined as passivity and a lack of interest or enthusiasm. People with dementia may lose interest in activities or hobbies they once found interesting and fun. They often have trouble coming up with ideas for activities and may rely more on others to come up with things to do. Apathy is one of the most common symptoms of dementia, and the person with dementia is usually not aware of or bothered by it.\n\nApathy can be hard for families for many reasons. Families may have trouble getting used to passivity in a person who was once motivated and active. Families may worry that the person is sad, because apathy often resembles depression, although not everyone with apathy is depressed. Families may put a lot of effort into finding ways to engage the person with dementia, and this process may be tiring and frustrating. They may feel like they have failed when they are unable to get the person with dementia to be more active. The person with dementia often needs help from others to plan, set up, and start an activity. As the disease progresses, they will need more help to do simpler things. Finally, families may worry that inactivity will lead to other health problems.\n\nThe truth is, apathy is hard to treat. There are no medications to treat apathy, although donepezil (Aricept®, used in people with Alzheimer’s disease) can sometimes improve it. In many cases, the area of the brain (the frontal lobes) that makes a person active and interested is affected by dementia. The person with dementia may not be able to start an activity on their own, but they may be able to engage once someone helps them get started. Sometimes, the person with dementia will need help to stay focused on an activity. Sometimes, activities that once held the person’s attention become too much for them or too hard to follow. This does not mean the person “just needs to try harder;” they really cannot be active or show that familiar “spark” of interest and enthusiasm.\n\nThings You Can Do to Help\n\nDo not assume that old activities and hobbies are familiar and fun for the person with dementia; they may have become too difficult and confusing.\n\nWork on accepting that apathy is a symptom of dementia and try not to think of the person as being lazy. Find ways to appreciate the person as they are now, with less drive and interest than they had before.\n\nDo not expect the person with dementia to suggest things to do.\n\nTry to not let this become an area of conflict between you and the person with dementia. The conflict is not good for either of you!\n\nConsider simpler physical exercise, such as walking, that is more “automatic.”\n\nTry simpler activities that the person can do without being frustrated. For example, large piece puzzles, riding in the car, listening to music, and sorting, folding, or stacking objects, are some things that the person may enjoy doing.\n\nNotice when they are having trouble with a task and offer enough help so that they can be successful without taking over. For example, if the person has difficulty starting a puzzle, you might help by telling them to sort the pieces by color first, then separate the edge pieces, etc.\n\nAvoid asking open-ended questions that may result in the patient saying “no” or “nothing.” For example, instead of asking, “What do you want to do today?” ask, “What coat do you want to wear for our walk?”\n\nSet a routine for activities. For example, try playing cards every day after dinner. Knowing what to expect may make it easier for the person with dementia.\n\nFor people who live in a care facility and who do not want to do group activities, ask if the activity director can offer one-on-one activities in the person’s room.\n\nResource\n\nThe Alzheimer’s Association website has a list of things to do that could be enjoyable for people with dementia\n\nIs this change in behavior caused by the dementia?\n\nWhen people notice a change in behavior, like increased confusion or agitation, they often ask whether the change is being caused by the dementia or if it is a sign of something else. This is a good question because it can be hard to tell! While a slow decrease in the person’s abilities over time is expected with most types of dementia, sudden changes that happen over hours or days may be a sign of what is called delirium. It is important to compare new behaviors or changes in abilities to the person’s usual abilities and behavior patterns. With careful assessment, the underlying causes of delirium can often be treated, helping the person recover some or all of their previous abilities.\n\nWhat are the signs of delirium?\n\nChanges that occur over hours or days and seem to come and go, or fluctuate throughout the day:\n\nChange in energy or alertness\n\nMore sleepy than usual, or\n\nHyperactive and anxious\n\nInability to focus or pay attention; more easily distracted\n\nCommunication problems, such as switching topics too often or using words that do not make sense\n\nParanoid thinking or fear that someone or something is trying to harm them\n\nSeeing or hearing things that are not there\n\nMovement problems, such as moving slowly, fidgeting, or clumsiness\n\nWhat causes delirium?\n\nMany things can cause delirium, and sometimes there is more than one cause. Here are some common things we look for:\n\nInfection, such as urinary tract or respiratory\n\nMedication side effects\n\nDehydration\n\nConstipation\n\nUrine retention or inability to empty the bladder completely (especially in older men)\n\nPain\n\nLack of sleep\n\nNutritional problems from not eating well\n\nElectrolyte imbalance (such as low levels of sodium in the person’s blood)\n\nOther medical problems (diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease, lung disease or heart failure)\n\nWhat can you do to help?\n\nIf you suspect that someone is experiencing delirium, it is important to make an appointment for him or her to see their primary care provider as soon as possible. Their provider may order urine and blood tests to look for possible causes of delirium. It may be helpful for the provider to know what happened before and after the changes in the person’s behavior occurred. If the person seems dramatically different, extremely distressed, or has difficulty breathing, call 911 or take them to a hospital.\n\nThings to help the person get back to “normal” as soon as possible\n\nWhen someone has delirium, they often feel disoriented, anxious, and frightened. It can be hard for them to feel comfortable or trust that they are safe. Here are some ways to help once treatment has been started:\n\nTry to stay calm and peaceful yourself\n\nReassure the person that everything will be okay\n\nIf the person seems aware that something is wrong, it’s okay to try to talk to them about what is happening. If talking about being sick is distressing for the person, then it’s probably best to avoid talking about it directly\n\nPromote activity during the day:\n\nHelp the person out of bed for meals\n\nTake the person on a short walk three times a day (around the house is okay)\n\nEngage the person in simple calming activities\n\nLook at picture books or magazines\n\nTell stories about the past\n\nOffer soothing touch (hand, foot, or back rub, brushing hair)\n\nHelp with simple puzzles or adult coloring books, play music or cards\n\nDemonstrate deep breathing and encourage them to do the same\n\nPromote sleep at night:\n\nMinimize light and noise if it disrupts their sleep\n\nMake sure they are comfortably warm\n\nLook for any signs of pain (grimace, moan, or bracing with movement)\n\nHelp them stay nourished and hydrated, offer snacks and encourage them to drink throughout the day\n\nHelp them wear any glasses or hearing aids that they normally use\n\nDelirium may begin to improve as soon as underlying causes are treated; however, it can take months for the person to return to their previous level of function and behavior. Unfortunately, delirium can cause dementia to progress more quickly, and in some cases, the person may not be able to fully recover their previous abilities.\n\nFollow-up with the primary care provider\n\nIt’s a good idea to schedule a follow-up visit with the person’s primary care provider within a month or so. The provider should check to see if any medications they ordered were helpful. This may also be done over the phone if symptoms have improved. Any medications that were used to help manage psychotic symptoms from delirium may be discontinued (in consultation with the provider) once the person has recovered. If the person has become weak or has more difficulty walking, the provider can make a referral for physical therapy.\n\nFor more information:\n\nUrinary Tract Infections and Dementia\n\nUCSF Delirium Care Guide\n\nThe Modified and Extended Hospital Elder Life Program: A remote model of care to expand delirium prevention\n\nDelirium Research Center at Vanderbilt\n\nPeople with dementia sometimes develop delusions or false beliefs, and hallucinations or they sense things that are not actually there. Delusions in dementia may be paranoid; for example, the person might believe someone is stealing from them, their spouse is cheating on them, or someone is out to get them. Delusions in dementia can also be related to memory loss. For example, the person might believe they have to go to work (when they’ve been retired for years), that they are able to drive safely (though their license was revoked) or that they need to take care of their children (who are now grown adults).\n\nHallucinations involve seeing, hearing, feeling or smelling things that are not there. Hallucinations in dementia may be pleasant; for example, the person might see and talk to “little people,” animals or a person from their past (like a deceased parent). Hallucinations in dementia can also be scary and distressing. For example, the person might hear people yelling at them, see people coming after them or feel bugs crawling on their skin. Strong emotional memories from the person’s past may re-manifest as delusions and hallucinations in dementia. The person may have trouble separating past experiences from current reality and may re-live these events to a certain extent. For example, experiences of abuse, traumatic incidents or tragic loss may be triggered by environmental cues and re-experienced as a delusion or hallucination.\n\nDelusions and hallucinations can occur in all types of dementia and they are especially common in Lewy body dementia (LBD) and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD). Things in the environment can contribute to misperceptions. For example, dramatic or scary television programs might be perceived as actually happening in real life. Alarming noises, reflections in a mirror or window, dark shadows and glaring lights can be perceived as someone coming after them. Fatigue or lack of rest can make these symptoms worse. If the symptoms are new or getting worse, it is important to have the person evaluated by their doctor to rule out an underlying medical cause. Sudden changes in mental status can be caused by urinary tract infections, pneumonia, constipation, dehydration and other conditions.\n\nWhen the person is not bothered or distressed by their hallucinations or delusions, it is generally best to acknowledge their experience with a matter-of-fact tone of voice without endorsing or denying it. For example, you might say something like, “Oh, that’s interesting,” or “Hmm, I don’t see that,” or “Wouldn’t it be nice to have a private jet, they sure cost a lot of money!” and move on to another topic of conversation. Stay calm and avoid arguing with the person or telling them that they are wrong.\n\nThis section offers some ideas for helping the person with dementia when they are having delusions or hallucinations. If their symptoms are distressing, their doctor should be consulted to rule out other causes, and see if medication might help. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil (trade name ‎Aricept) or rivastigmine (trade name‎ ‎Exelon) are often helpful. Stronger medications like antipsychotics have more side effects, though the benefits of the medication sometimes outweigh the potential harm.\n\nIF\n\nTHEN\n\nThe person believes they have to go to work or take care of a previous responsibility\n\nRemember that the person has a disease that affects their brain and they are not acting this way on purpose.\n\nConsider ways to adapt former roles. If the person has always been ‟a provider” or ‟a nurturer,” they might help take care of a pet or garden. If they’re used to being in charge, they might be a ‟director” and tell others how to do things they used to do (like cook or fix things).\n\nAvoid arguing or trying to reason with the person; this will often make the situation worse\n\nTry distracting the person with conversation. For example, ask them to tell you about their work and gradually guide the conversation to a somewhat related topic. If the person is talking about working in an office, you might change the subject to talking about typewriters or computers.\n\nTry distracting the person with compliments. For example, tell them how much you like their shirt or jewelry and then ask questions about it. Is it their favorite color? Was it expensive?\n\nTry redirecting the person with another activity. For example, ask for their help to do something else like rearrange furniture, sort the mail, tinker with a broken appliance, sweep the floor or fold laundry.\n\nTry reassuring the person by telling them a little lie. For example, you might tell them ‘the office is closed today’ or ‘the kids are at school.’ You will need to immediately redirect them to another topic of conversation or an activity to avoid conflict.\n\nFind ways to show the person your appreciation. For example, thank them for sharing their story with you, teaching you something you didn’t know, making you laugh, etc.\n\nReal caregivers share their strategies in this video: Conversations with Caregivers video: Playing Along.\n\nThe person sees or hears someone coming to get them\n\nRemember that the person is not doing this on purpose or pretending to see or hear things. They have an illness that affects their brain and they are doing the best they can.\n\nEmpathize with the person’s feelings and offer reassurance. For example, you might say:\n\nI’m so sorry, that’s a scary feeling. Let’s take a deep breath. I don’t hear anything. Come with me, let’s make sure everything is okay.\n\nWhen I feel scared, I like to spend time with my cat (say a prayer, drink some tea, wrap myself in a blanket, watch a heartwarming movie, etc.) Here’s my cat Charlie, isn’t he sweet?\n\nI am sorry that was so scary. Let’s turn on all of the lights and eat some ice cream until we feel better.\n\nAvoid telling the person they should not feel scared.\n\nComfort the person with a respectful tone of voice as you would comfort any other adult.\n\nIf the person responds well to affection, offer a hug, hold their hand or rub their back.\n\nTry to observe the environment from the person’s perspective. Search for visual or auditory cues that might be misperceived by the person. Minimize shadows, noises, and objects that could appear or sound scary or disturbing.\n\nAre there objects that help the person feel secure like a blanket, a stuffed animal, a religious or spiritual item or a photograph? Consider a robotic stuffed animal.\n\nIf the person lives alone, this kind of paranoia may be a sign that they need more support and supervision. Consider hiring more in-home care or moving the person to a care facility.\n\nRemove or secure guns, knives, and other objects that could be used by the person to try to defend themselves from an innocent person they might falsely believe is after them.\n\nThe person believes their spouse or caregiver is an imposter. This is also known as Capgras syndrome.\n\nRemember the delusion is caused by the disease. The person is not acting like this on purpose.\n\nTry not to take it personally.\n\nSometimes it helps to have a familiar person, like a neighbor or relative, call or visit to reassure the person.\n\nArguing with the person or trying to convince them they are wrong is likely to make the situation worse.\n\nThis kind of paranoid delusion is especially difficult for loved ones, particularly the person who is believed to be an imposter\n\nIf you are at the end of your rope and need help, call the Alzheimer’s Association’s 24/7 Helpline at 1.800.272.3900\n\nConsider joining a support group or getting counseling to help you cope.\n\nThe person with dementia may need to spend some time away from the person they believe to be an imposter.\n\nConsider hiring in-home help, enrolling the person in a day program or moving the person to another relative’s home or a care facility.\n\nListen to an interesting podcast from NPR’s Radiolab program about Capgras Syndrome.\n\nThe person is accusing someone of stealing from them or hiding their things\n\nPeople with dementia are at risk of being victims of fraud and robbery. It is important to investigate these complaints to see if it really is a delusion.\n\nOften, the person has misplaced their things and they need someone to calmly assist them in finding them.\n\nRemember the person is not doing this on purpose; try not to take it personally.\n\nAvoid arguing with the person; it is generally better to just try to help resolve the issue.\n\nIf you are unable to find the item, apologize to the person for their loss. Offer to try to replace it.\n\nHelp the person organize and store their things in places that are intuitive for them. Create visual cues that help the person locate things\n\nPurchase backups for things that are frequently misplaced like glasses, a wallet, purses and keys.\n\nIf the person lives in a care facility, use iron-on labels to put their name on clothing, shoes and other personal items.\n\nThe person becomes severely distressed, aggressive or impulsively tries to ‟escape”\n\nTake a deep breath and do your best to stay calm\n\nReduce background noise (turn off the television or radio) and if possible, dim any bright lights.\n\nSometimes it helps to have another familiar person, like a neighbor or relative, call or visit to distract and reassure the person.\n\nArguing with the person or trying to physically restrain them is likely to make the situation worse\n\nIf the person will engage in conversation, try calmly talking about concrete things you observe in the environment to help shift their attention to the present moment. For example, you might describe the weather or the immediate surroundings. Encourage use of all of their senses (look, listen, feel, smell).\n\nAvoid physically restraining the person unless they are in imminent danger or threatening the safety of others\n\nIf there is any immediate threat of danger to the person or anyone else, call 911.\n\nContact the person’s doctor to make an urgent appointment to rule out an underlying medical cause and consider pharmacologic treatment.\n\nIf you are at the end of your rope and need help figuring out what to do at any time day or night, call the Alzheimer’s Association’s 24/7 Helpline at 1.800.272.3900.\n\nOnce the situation de-escalates, consider developing a crisis response plan with the person’s care team to manage situations like this in the future. Here is more information about crisis response plans from the National Association for Mental Illness.\n\nSometimes repetitive, rhythmic activities can be grounding for people. For example: rocking on a swing or chair, walking, humming, singing, tossing a ball back and forth, playing a hand drum, hitting a punching bag, etc.\n\nPeople with dementia often suffer from depression, especially in the early to moderate stages of the disease when they have some awareness of losing their abilities. The person may become self-conscious about saying or doing the wrong thing, and avoid friends and family. They may feel sensitive about others being condescending or treating them like children. They may grieve the future they used to imagine and worry about what will happen to them as the dementia progresses. People with dementia often feel guilty about being or becoming a burden on their loved ones. They often struggle with feeling useless and have difficulty finding ways to be helpful. Sometimes the person can feel utterly hopeless and despairing.\n\nPeople with dementia who suffer from depression are at risk for suicide and should be evaluated by their doctor or mental health professional. Medications are an important part of treatment for depression. In addition, the person will need a lot of support and encouragement to stay active and engaged. Organizations like the Dementia Alliance International and the Alzheimer’s Association offer peer support groups and other services. Individual and couples counseling can also be helpful. Religious or spiritual communities may offer support. This section offers practical ideas for supporting persons with depression and dementia. These tips are not intended to replace proper medical and mental health treatment.\n\nWhile this section focuses on the person with dementia, it is important to acknowledge that depression is also very common among family caregivers. Seeking treatment and support for your own physical and mental health should be a top priority. Your health and wellbeing have a direct impact on the person you care for.\n\nIF\n\nTHEN\n\nThe person is giving up activities and isolating themselves from others\n\nRemember that the person has an illness that affects their brain and they are doing the best they can.\n\nMake an effort to try new things together. Brainstorm some ideas and write them down on a “bucket list.” For example: try painting, singing karaoke, cooking a new recipe, dancing, taking a day trip, record yourselves telling stories, play hand drums, do a jigsaw puzzle together, Facetime with friends or relatives, etc.\n\nTry to think of creative ways to turn day-to-day activities into special rituals. For example, bathing can become “spa day,” watching television can be “movie night,” walking can be “endurance training,” and eating a meal can be a “date.” Use words and props that help “set the stage.”\n\nConsider ways to adapt former roles. If the person has always been “a provider” or “a nurturer,” maybe they can help take care of a pet or garden. If they’re used to being in charge, maybe they can be a “director” and tell others how to do things they used to do (like cook or fix things).\n\nAsk other people to make regular lunch or coffee dates with the person. You can use websites like lotsahelpinghands.com to coordinate your support team.\n\nFind ways to show the person your love and appreciation.\n\nConsider more passive activities like going for a drive, listening to music, watching old movies or television shows, observing nature or people from a bench or window.\n\nIf the person is apathetic due to their dementia, it may be best to lower expectations about their level of engagement. Sometimes caregivers have to give themselves permission to stop trying so hard to get the person to do things.\n\nThe person appears sad and becomes tearful or cries easily\n\nRemember that the person is not doing this on purpose or trying to make you feel bad. They have an illness that affects their brain and they are doing the best they can.\n\nIf the person responds well to affection, offer a hug, hold their hand, or rub their back.\n\nEmpathize with the person’s feelings even if why they are sad or crying does not make sense to you. Sometimes the person themselves will not understand or be able to articulate why they feel the way they do.\n\nHere are some examples of helpful things to say:\n\nYou seem sad to me today. Is there something bothering you? Can we talk about it?\n\nI am sorry this is so difficult, I want to help. We’ll get through this together.\n\nAvoid telling the person they should not feel sad.\n\nComfort the person as you would comfort any normal adult with a respectful tone of voice.\n\nAvoid using terms of endearment that are commonly used for children and might be condescending to an adult.\n\nIf the person seems to be stuck in negative thoughts, validate their thoughts/feelings, and then try to gently redirect them to something else. For example, you might say:\n\nWhen I feel sad, I like to go for a walk (eat ice cream, hit a punching bag, bake cookies, watch a movie, etc.) Will you join me? Let’s try going for a walk.\n\nI am sorry things are so hard. I wish there was more we could do about it. For now, maybe we can try to go out and enjoy an ice cream together?\n\nConsider helping the person join a peer support group. If one is not available in your area, others have found 12-step groups helpful.\n\nConsider holding a family meeting if there is conflict or misunderstanding among family members that is affecting the person.\n\nLimit access to alcohol and monitor for overuse.\n\nRemove or secure guns, medications and other things that could be used for self-harm.\n\nThe person becomes severely distressed or inconsolable\n\nTake a deep breath and do your best to stay calm.\n\nReduce background noise (turn off the television) and dim any bright lights if possible.\n\nSometimes it helps to have another familiar person, like a neighbor or relative call or visit to distract and reassure the person.\n\nArguing with the person or trying to physically restrain them is likely to make the situation worse.\n\nIf there is any immediate threat of danger to the person or anyone else, call 911.\n\nContact the person’s doctor to make an urgent appointment to rule out an underlying medical cause and consider pharmacologic treatment.\n\nIf you are at the end of your rope and need help figuring out what to do at any time day or night, call the Alzheimer’s Association’s 24/7 Helpline at 1.800.272.3900.\n\nOnce the situation de-escalates, consider developing a crisis response plan with the person for managing situations like this in the future. Here is more information about crisis response plans from the National Association for Mental Illness.\n\nPeople with dementia often have problems sleeping and experience changes in their sleep patterns. Some of these changes are part of normal aging. Many of the changes in sleep patterns are caused by the impact of dementia on areas of the brain that control sleep. Many people with dementia sleep more during the day and thus, can be more awake and active at night. They may also awaken more easily during the night. Some people have trouble telling the difference between night and day. These sleep problems often disrupt the caregiver’s sleep. Many caregivers also report that they sleep poorly because they are worried and anxious. Sleep disruption can be stressful and burdensome for family caregivers, and we encourage caregivers to reach out for help.\n\nThere are medical conditions that can affect sleep. Depression and anxiety can cause early morning awakening, trouble getting back to sleep and poor sleep quality. Restless legs syndrome is a disorder that causes unpleasant sensations in the legs causing the urge to move. Sleep apnea is a pattern of breathing that results in poor sleep quality. Acting out during sleep (for example, moving, hitting out, and vivid dreams) can disrupt normal sleep patterns. Illnesses, such as angina and congestive heart failure can affect one’s sleep patterns. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should consult their healthcare provider.\n\nFiguring out the Cause(s)\n\nIt is important to try and figure out what may be causing the sleep problem. There may be multiple factors: the environment, the daily schedule, having a pet, the result of dementia, and/or the types of medications being taken. Figuring out the cause is an important step in deciding how to manage or treat the sleep disturbance.\n\nSometimes it is helpful to keep a log or diary to see if there is a pattern to the sleep problem(s). For example, one caregiver slept in her mother’s room and discovered there was a bright light coming from a street lamp and that the neighbor routinely started their noisy car early in the morning. Moving her mother to a quieter, darker bedroom helped them both get better sleep.\n\nIf you have insomnia, you may experience one or a combination of the following symptoms:\n\nTaking a long time (more than 30 to 45 minutes) to fall asleep\n\nWaking up several times each night\n\nWaking up early and being unable to get back to sleep\n\nWaking up feeling tired and not able to function well during the day\n\nManaging & Treating Sleep Problems\n\nThere are drug and non-drug approaches to the treatment of sleep disruption. Most experts encourage the use of non-drug strategies. Sleep medications are associated with a greater chance of falls and other risk factors. The following are strategies that can be used for the person with dementia and the family caregiver.\n\nSet the Right Environment\n\nKeep a regular schedule: go to bed and get up at the same time every day.\n\nTry to exercise daily but not within three hours of bedtime.\n\nMake sure the temperature in the bedroom is comfortable (not too hot and not too cold).\n\nReduce liquid intake before bedtime.\n\nTry not to nap during the day; if you do nap, try to do so before 3 p.m. and try to keep the nap short (about 20 minutes).\n\nKeep the bedroom as dark and quiet as possible; use a nightlight if needed, but be aware that bright light disrupts sleep/wake patterns.\n\nCalm activities at the end of the day and before bedtime may help with sleep.\n\nAvoid violent movies or TV shows; strong content and images can be upsetting and can make it hard to relax.\n\nBe aware that changes in your environment, such as moving to a new home or having unexpected visitors can be disruptive and confusing for the person with dementia.\n\nAvoid alcohol and products that contain caffeine (tea, chocolate or soda) and nicotine; these can cause overstimulation and interfere with sleep.\n\nHave access to daylight for several hours a day; exposure to light improves day/night patterns.\n\nFor the person with dementia, avoid keeping their daytime clothing in view at night; this may be a cue that it’s time to get up.\n\nMedications for Sleep\n\nAlways talk with your healthcare provider before using over-the-counter (OTC) sleep medicines; many of them can make confusion worse, and some common OTC medications (like Tylenol PM) contain Benadryl, which can actually worsen sleep and cause confusion in older adults.\n\nAsk your health care provider if any of the medication you currently take could be causing sleep disruption.\n\nIf the person with dementia is taking a cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine), avoid giving the medicine before bed; instead, give it in the morning.\n\nBe aware that medicines used to promote sleep carry risks for older adults and people with dementia, including imbalance and falls, fractures, and increased confusion.\n\nConsider whether using a sleeping medication is appropriate; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a commonly used type of medicine (i.e., trazodone).\n\nAny time you are prescribed a new medication, make sure to ask your healthcare provider about possible benefits and risks; ask about other treatment options that may be available.\n\nOther Things to Consider\n\nBe sure to treat conditions that may be causing pain and discomfort; consider using an analgesic at bedtime if your health care provider agrees.\n\nDo not restrain a person with dementia to keep them in bed; this can create agitation and a desire to escape and can lead to a fall or injury.\n\nConsider installing security alarms on doors and windows if there is concern that the person with dementia might wander from the house during the night; knowing that you have an alarm system may help you get better sleep.\n\nConsider using a bedside commode if getting up to the bathroom is causing sleep disruption.\n\nIf you think being hungry at night is a problem, have a light snack just before bed.\n\nUse the toilet right before bedtime to help prevent nighttime waking.\n\nConsider hiring help in the home during the nighttime hours to help you, as the caregiver, get some sleep.\n\nThere is evidence that meditation and mindfulness promote good sleep.\n\nOther Resources\n\n6 Tips for Managing Sleep Problems in Alzheimer’s (NIA)\n\nA Good Night’s Sleep (NIA)\n\nDementia and Sleep (Sleep Health Foundation)\n\nGood Sleep Habits (Sleep Health Foundation)\n\nAny person who has memory problems and is able to walk is at risk of wandering and getting lost. Wandering can happen at any time. Wandering may be triggered by an attraction to something in the environment such as a shiny doorknob or elevator buttons. Persons with dementia may also be responding to an impulse or need to “go somewhere” or “do something.” Sometimes a person may get lost because they are, or become, disoriented. Some people wander because they are confused or frightened. Wandering is not necessarily a problem unless the person is at risk of getting injured, being taken advantage of, or getting lost.\n\nIF\n\nTHEN\n\nYour loved one with dementia can get around by themselves\n\nPrepare for the possibility that they may wander and get lost:\n\nKeep a recent, close-up photograph or video of the person in an accessible place, such as your wallet or cell phone.\n\nInform family, friends, paid caregivers, and neighbors that the person is at risk for wandering and getting lost; ask that they keep an eye out for the person and alert you if they see them out and about on their own.\n\nInform local public servants and business owners, such as the police, fire department, and store clerks, that the person is at risk for wandering and getting lost, and make sure they have your phone number\n\nMake a list of likely places where the person may wander in case you need to search for them (past jobs, former homes, places of worship, or favorite restaurants)\n\nConsider using an alarm, chime, or bell to alert you when the person is exiting a room or leaving home unattended\n\nTry to provide enough supervision to keep the person safe; consider hiring an in-home caregiver or companion or enrolling the person in a day program\n\nTry to keep the person engaged in a familiar routine each day, since unexpected changes and over- or under-stimulation can be a trigger for wandering\n\nConsider enrolling the person in the MedicAlert®+Alzheimer’s Association Safe Return® program at 1.800.625.3780\n\nConsider getting the person an ID bracelet or necklace with your contact information on it\n\nConsider using a GPS tracking device or smartphone application that uses satellite technology to locate missing persons carrying or wearing a sensor device (i.e., shoe insert, watch or anklet)\n\nYour loved one is actively trying to leave, for example, to “go home” even though they are at home or “Go to work” even though they no longer work\n\nEnvironmental Strategies:\n\nHide environmental “exit cues” or “trigger items,” such as keys, shoes, jackets, hats, and purses.\n\nSimplify the environment; reduce clutter, crowding, and background noise. Some television programs can be distressing.\n\nTry placing a large “DO NOT ENTER” sign on exit doors.\n\nCamouflage exit doors by painting them the same color as the walls or covering them with a removable curtain or screen.\n\nCover knobs with cloth the same color as the door or use childproof knobs.\n\nDo not lock a person with dementia in the home or in a car unattended.\n\nDo not try to physically restrain a person with dementia unless you are attempting to protect them or others from immediate harm (such as getting hit by oncoming traffic).\n\nCommunication Strategies:\n\nAvoid trying to convince the person that they are already home or that they no longer work. This will lead to an argument and make the person more insistent about what they believe to be true.\n\nTry to go along with what the person is saying and guide them to something else without letting them realize they are being redirected.\n\nRemember to be calm and reassuring instead of controlling.\n\nTry making an emotional connection with the person in that moment.\n\nUse communication that is supportive and focused on distraction, for example:\n\n“What was it like growing up in your house?”\n\n“What is your favorite room in the house?”\n\n“We can leave after lunch. Can you help me set the table?”\n\n“I love you. This is hard. We are going to get through this together.”\n\nThe person tries to leave because they are frightened and agitated\n\nStay calm. Consider calling a neighbor or friend to be on standby in case you need help.\n\nAvoid running after them or trying to hold them back unless there are obvious hazards, such as traffic or harsh weather. Chasing after them may make the situation more dangerous.\n\nFollow the person from a distance to give them personal space. Try to redirect their train of thought in a gentle manner. Some people will respond to verbal redirection, such as pointing out the weather or some other observation of the present moment:\n\n“It sure is gray and cold out today. Would you join me for some hot cocoa?”\n\n“Look at those cherry blossoms – how lovely! What is your favorite flower?”\n\nUse positive directions rather than negative. For example, say, “Come with me,” not “Stop, don’t go there.”\n\nNotice what may have triggered this behavior, for instance, a loud noise, a crowded or busy space, a change in routine, or your own emotional state.\n\nYour loved one seems bored or restless\n\nEncourage exercise to help reduce anxiety, agitation, and restlessness. Go for a walk, rock in a bench swing, toss a beach ball, dance, or participate in group exercises.\n\nFind moments of connection (try using their favorite music, a reassuring touch, reminiscing, storytelling, humor, pets, gardening, or conversation).\n\nTry going outside to experience a change in scenery (get a snack or an ice cream cone, visit a pet store, museum, or mall, or take a scenic drive).\n\nIf your loved one is missing and you cannot find them\n\nCall 911 and let them know that a “vulnerable adult” with dementia is missing.\n\nIf you are enrolled, call MedicAlert®+Alzheimer’s Association Safe Return® program at 1.800.625.3780.\n\nWrite down what the person was wearing.\n\nCall someone to help you (family, friend, or neighbor) walk or drive around the block or the immediate area. If possible, have somebody stay at home so that they can answer the telephone and be there in case the person returns.\n\nHave the person’s most recent photo and medical information ready for the police.\n\nGather your list of places that the person may wander – past jobs, former homes, places of worship, restaurants, or bars.\n\nCheck dangerous areas near the home, such as bodies of water, open stairwells, dense foliage, tunnels, bus stops, and roads with heavy traffic.\n\nResources\n\nWandering and Alzheimer's Disease\n\nWandering (Alzheimer's Association)\n\nTechnology\n\nThere is a lot of interest and hope that technology will provide safeguards against the risk of wandering and getting lost.
