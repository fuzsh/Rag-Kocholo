        "text": "Robbery vs. Mugging vs. Burglary\n\nRobbery\n\nRobbery is a pretty broad term that is used both legally and generally with slightly different meanings.\n\nDefinition of robbery in legal terms:\n\nThe taking of money or goods in the possession of another, from his or her person or immediate presence, by force or intimidation.\n\nThe emphasis here is that the person is actually present.\n\nDefinition of robbery in general terms:\n\nThe crime of stealing money or property : the crime of robbing a person or place.\n\nThis definition is much more general. There is no specific requirement that the person be present for this event or that there be any threat of (or actual) force.\n\nSome examples:\n\nMasked men with guns robbed the bank yesterday. They threatened to kill one of the employees if the manager didn't hand over the money in the vault.\n\nThis fulfills both the legal and general definitions of robbery.\n\nWhen we came back from our vacation, we found out our home had been robbed. Fortunately, no one was there and all they took was our TV.\n\nThis is a perfectly valid use of robbery but only in the general sense. It does not satisfy the legal definition of robbery and would, instead, be considered burglary (see section below).\n\nNotable idiomatic uses of robbery/robbed:\n\nHe was robbed. or You were robbed. or I was robbed.\n\nIn sports: A player was about to score (or did score) when the unexpected action of another player or a referee prevents the point from actually being scored.\n\nIn finance: (believing that you/someone were/was) being overcharged for a good or service.\n\nThe price of the soda and popcorn at the movie theater is highway robbery.\n\nWhile this used to be a literal thing (think Robin Hood), it has now come to mean something similar to the phrase above I was robbed:\n\nexcessive profit or advantage derived from a business transaction\n\nSo, this would mean that a person feels they are being overcharged in a large way for something that is not of very high value.\n\nMugging\n\nMug (as a verb) is defined as:\n\nto attack and rob (someone) in a public place.\n\nLet's take the sections of this definition in parts:\n\nAttack and rob\n\nThe general connotation of a mugging is that the person getting mugged is harmed in some physical way or is at least threatened with injury. Often, people who are mugged get beaten up or injured with some sort of weapon. The combination of attacking and theft of personal property is important to the definition of mugging.\n\nSomeone\n\nSomeone is important because it's an action committed against a person, not a place. You can't mug a bank or a jewelry store. This someone being mugged is also generally only one or maybe two people at a time. This is partially implied if you follow the legal sense of rob.\n\nPublic Place\n\nI actually chose this definition over others because I think that it is important to call out the in a public place part. You can't really be mugged in your home. One is mugged on the street, in an alleyway, in a park, etc. That doesn't mean that it's in the sight of other people, though.\n\nTakeaway\n\nSo, from this together, we can see that mugging is a subset of robbery with the added specificity of actual injury occurring and it being in a generally public place.\n\nExample\n\nI was walking home from work and I got mugged. He gave me a black eye and took my wallet and watch.\n\nMy husband and I were mugged last night. Our assailant had a gun and threatened to hurt us if we didn't hand over our valuables.\n\nBurglary\n\nBurglary is a little different but I thought worth mentioning here.\n\nDefinition of burglary:\n\nThe criminal offense of breaking and entering a building illegally for the purpose of committing a crime.\n\nSo, what's notably different here is that no one (other than the perpetrator) is involved in this. What's also notable is that item or monetary theft is not inherently implied in the term... though, in general use, people tend to assume that the goal is to steal something.\n\nThe definition does seem a bit specific as it calls out a building specifically, which would imply that a vehicle couldn't be the target of burglary. Fortunately, further down in the definition it also states:\n\nUnder modern statutes, the offense can occur in any enclosed structure, regardless of whether it is used for habitation.\n\nNote that breaking does not actually require doing physical damage to the building. A thief finding a door unlocked and entering the building is still guilty of breaking into the building.\n\nMugging is usually a violent attempt to steal thing(s) that a person is known (or expected) to wear or carry. For example, a wallet, a purse, jewelry, gold chains, or shoes. Sadly, the phrases \"mugged and raped\" and \"killed by a mugger\" are well-known.\n\nMugging necessarily involves an in-person interaction between one or more criminals and one or more victims. The interaction includes either physical violence (such as punching, slapping, knocking down, knifing, or shooting), or a credible threat of such violence (such as the open display of fists or weapon(s)). Mugging usually involves pedestrians, or riders of buses or subway trains.\n\nMugging is often prosecuted as \"strong-arm robbery\" or \"armed robbery\". Many Americans carry guns, mace, tasers, or pepper-spray to deter muggers.\n\nHijacking and carjacking are similar to mugging, but are in the cramped confines of a car or a plane cockpit, with the goal of stealing the vehicle. Ship piracy is similar to mugging, but aboard a ship, with the goal(s) of stealing the ship and/or kidnapping the crew. Despite the similarities, hijacking, carjacking, and piracy are not usually considered to be mugging.\n\nRobbery is theft -- the taking of something with neither permission nor forgiveness. The victim does not need to be present to be robbed. There are several forms of robbery, including shop-lifting, pocket-picking, fraud, and theft during a burglary. Many American homes and stores rely on video-taping and alarm systems to deter theft.\n\nPermission can be granted ahead of time, or voluntarily at the time. Some people \"borrow\" things without permission, but the \"lender\" retroactively gives permission later -- this is effectively forgiveness. For example, when Paul Revere \"borrowed\" a horse for his midnight ride, he probably did not have permission. In the culture of Boston at the time, he was expected to either return the horse unharmed, or make good the owner's loss.\n\nFor legal purposes, some jurisdictions treat \"robbery\" as a near synonym for \"mugging\" (as described above), not as a near synonym for \"theft\" (as described above). For example, the Revised Code of Washington defines \"theft\" and \"robbery\" as follows:\n\nRCW 9A.56.020 (1) \"Theft\" means:\n\n(a) To wrongfully obtain or exert unauthorized control over the property or services of another or the value thereof, with intent to deprive him or her of such property or services; or\n\n(b) By color or aid of deception to obtain control over the property or services of another or the value thereof, with intent to deprive him or her of such property or services; or\n\n(c) To appropriate lost or misdelivered property or services of another, or the value thereof, with intent to deprive him or her of such property or services.\n\nRCW 9A.56.190 A person commits robbery when he or she unlawfully takes personal property from the person of another or in his or her presence against his or her will by the use or threatened use of immediate force, violence, or fear of injury to that person or his or her property or the person or property of anyone. Such force or fear must be used to obtain or retain possession of the property, or to prevent or overcome resistance to the taking; in either of which cases the degree of force is immaterial. Such taking constitutes robbery whenever it appears that, although the taking was fully completed without the knowledge of the person from whom taken, such knowledge was prevented by the use of force or fear."
