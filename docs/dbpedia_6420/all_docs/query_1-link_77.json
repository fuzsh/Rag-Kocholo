        "text": "For a certain generation, David McCallum will always be Illya Kuryakin, the mysterious Soviet agent in The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\n\nThe role turned the actor into a global sex symbol, his public appearances besieged by screaming teenage girls.\n\nHe cut his teeth in 1950s British cinema and also found wider fame in the The Great Escape, Colditz and Sapphire & Steel.\n\nLater, he reached a new audience as Dr Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard, the medical examiner in US TV drama NCIS.\n\nDavid Keith McCallum was born on 19 Sep 1933 in the Maryhill area of Glasgow. His father David, a violinist, became leader of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, which necessitated a family move to London in 1936. His mother was an accomplished cellist.\n\nThe young McCallum won a scholarship to the University College School in north London and took up the oboe with a view to a classical music career.\n\nBut he developed a fascination for acting. There were appearances as a child in BBC radio drama and involvement in amateur dramatics. A well-received performance as the doomed prince in Shakespeare's King John helped him make the decision.\n\n\"I pleaded, unsuccessfully, with the assassin not to kill me,\" he later recalled. \"It is a real tear-jerker, and the audience applauded wildly at the end. It was in that moment I realised that my home in this world was on a stage.\"\n\nHe did his National Service policing the British Empire with the Royal West African Frontier Force before returning home and attending the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada).\n\nThere were backstage jobs to subsidise an acting career - much to the disappointment of his father, who felt his son was wasting his time.\n\n\"Then I did a film called Robbery Under Arms and my name was up in huge letters on the Odeon Leicester Square. He and I walked by, and he said, 'I think you have made the right choice after all.'\"\n\nThere were minor parts in a number of films including Hell Drivers, where he appeared with his future wife, Jill Ireland, before he finally wowed the critics as Steven Wyatt in 1962 film Billy Budd.\n\nThe following year, he appeared as Lieutenant Commander Eric Ashley-Pitt in the The Great Escape which, over the ensuing years, became a staple of bank holiday TV viewing.\n\nIn 1964, McCallum was offered a bit part as Illya Kuryakin in a TV pilot called Solo, a spy series created as a vehicle for actor Robert Vaughan. But fan reaction to his performance saw his role greatly enhanced when the series proper launched under a new title, The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\n\nHis blonde good looks, coupled with his decision to play his character as a man of mystery, made him a huge favourite with the show's female fans.\n\nWhen McCallum arrived in London in 1966, his airport reception from ranks of screaming girls rivalled that of The Beatles. During U.N.C.L.E.'s run, studio MGM announced he had received more fan mail than any previous performer, including Elvis Presley.\n\nIn an attempt to counter the competition from newer TV spy dramas, the producers put more emphasis on the camp nature of the show in later series, and injected more humour, The results were disastrous and it ended in 1968.\n\nBy this time, so had his marriage to Jill Ireland, who left him for the actor Charles Bronson. In 1967, he married Katherine Carpenter.\n\nWhen not working on the series, McCallum found time to return to music. He worked on four albums blending his oboe with horns, strings and drums in instrumental interpretations of hits of the day.\n\nMcCallum struggled to regain the global fame that U.N.C.L.E. brought him. There were a series of small parts in some unmemorable films but he continued to be much in demand on the small screen.\n\nIn 1972, he found himself back in a prisoner of war camp as the hot-headed Flight Lieutenant Simon Carter in BBC drama Colditz. The series proved immensely popular and the only disappointment was that it was not widely shown in the US.\n\nAfter playing the lead role of Alan Breck Stewart in a TV production of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Kidnapped, McCallum paired up with Joanna Lumley in the ATV sci-fi drama series Sapphire & Steel.\n\n\"I love what he does,\" he once said. \"I like the humour of his mind. I like the fact that he that he rambles on but, more than that, he's given me the opportunity to learn so much.\"\n\nIn a nod to his U.N.C.L.E. role, one scene had a character asking: \"What did Ducky look like when he was younger?\" Another character replied: \"Illya Kuryakin.\"\n\nMcCallum published his first novel in 2016, Once a Crooked Man, a book he described as \"the sort of good yarn you can pick up at an airport, read on the plane and give it to a friend at the other end\".\n\nMcCallum once admitted that he rewatched episodes of The Man From U.N.C.L.E., the series that brought him a global audience and mass adulation.\n\n\"I had no idea why people had this emotional response to Illya Kuryakin,\" he said. \"When you`re doing it, you don`t realise what it is you`re doing.\n\n\"But seeing it 50 years later, I can see how people found him kind of enigmatic and attractive, and just having fun.\""
