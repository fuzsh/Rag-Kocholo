Robbery Under Arms is a bushranger novel by Thomas Alexander Browne, published under his pen name Rolf Boldrewood. It was first published in serialised form by The Sydney Mail between July 1882 and August 1883, then in three volumes in London in 1888. It was abridged into a single volume in 1889 as part of Macmillan’s one-volume Colonial Library series and has not been out of print since.

It is considered a classic of Australian colonial literature, alongside Marcus Clarke's convict novel For the Term of his Natural Life (1876) and Fergus Hume’s mystery crime novel The Mystery of a Hansom Cab (1886), and has inspired numerous adaptations in film, television, and theatre.

Writing in the first person, the narrator Dick Marston tells the story of his life and loves and his association with the notorious bushranger Captain Starlight, a renegade from a noble English family. Set in the bush and goldfields of Australia in the 1850s, Starlight's gang, with Dick and his brother Jim's help, sets out on a series of escapades that include cattle theft and robbery under arms.
