Acrostic Poetry for Riazuddin

Rascally grin that brightens the room

Inventive ideas that often go boom

Ambitious dreamer, reaching the sky

Zany at times, with a wink in his eye

Unassuming charm that’s hard to resist

Daringly goofy, too fun to be missed

Dashing in style, with flair that he brings

In every gathering, he’s sure to add zing

Notorious for puns that make you groan

Never a dull moment, he’s always in the zone

A Fun Roast for Riazuddin

Ridiculously thinks he’s a star,

In denial about how bizarre,

A personality that’s hard to ignore,

Zoning out like he’s keeping score,

Understand, your jokes fall flat,

Dare you to wear that laugh like a hat,

Days pass, and you still can't decide,

In a crowd, you're the one that we hide,

Never forget how you bomb every line.

Radiant like the sunrise, your smile warms my day,

In every whisper of love, your voice leads the way.

A tapestry of moments, spun with laughter and tears,

Zephyr-like caresses dissolve all my fears.

Underneath the starlit sky, our dreams take their flight,

Dancing in shadows, igniting the night.

Devotion like rivers, flowing endlessly true,

In your arms, my love, I've found home anew.

Never-ending promises, in the twilight we’ll share,

Nestled in our laughter, a love beyond compare.
