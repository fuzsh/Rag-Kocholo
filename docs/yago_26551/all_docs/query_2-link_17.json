        "text": "There are always going to be situations where a leader has to make career decisions â€˜on what nextâ€™. One such situation made me join this â€˜once in life time companyâ€™ â€“ Amazon. After 11.5+ years at Amazon, Iâ€™m making a decision to move and stride into another unfamiliar terrain. I wonâ€™t say the decision was difficult but well thought through and a deliberated one. The journey through these years unravelled many firsts, what we call â€˜Day1 momentsâ€™ and made the stint nothing short but magical and phenomenal. With gratitude, humility and pride, it is right time to â€˜call it a dayâ€™ at Amazon. The past few weeks were spent in transition and next couple of weeks, I will try and re-live the amazing Day1 moments with teams and leaders who were part of this journey. There are many such moments to cherish, one such of being the pioneering work in building Amazon first world class tech support operations organization. Bar Raising for thousands of roles and mentoring second generation of Bar Raisers gave me opportunity to understand depth of business. Amazon defined my style more transformative, disruptive and made me a builder at heart; leading and developing people continued as passion. The Leadership principles remain in my DNA, Thank you Amazon ! It has been absolute privilege and honour to lead best in class Worldwide teams at Amazon whose customer obsession and high degree of ownership made Amazon unparalled. Working with these thousands of employees across globe, made me humble and develop cultural intelligence. Iâ€™m being fortunate to lead and represent highly competent and talented set of leaders across globe - my incredible LT, who brought diversity of thought and people leadership. I will continue to watch these teams grow and prosper, while doing what they do best, in realizing the vision to be the â€˜earthâ€™s most customer centric companyâ€™. Itâ€™s often said at Amazon that you are the least smartest in the room, and working with my peers, colleagues and support partners, made that look real. Just being in that room and in those discussions was enriching experience. And then you work with amazing leaders under whose tutelage you grow and transform as a leader. There are many such leaders, who deposed faith and advocated on my behalf - Alice Sesay Pope, Amy Jo (AJ) Stark, ACC, Gabriele \"G\" Masili, Ken Willis, Rajiv Vellodi, Reagan Cannon, Shiv Menon, Shivi Shankaran, Deepti Varma, amongst the many. Subin, my EA, made it look simple every day in the 7+ years. The best part being, some of my LT directs, colleagues and managers, becoming friends for life. Thank you Team ! So next steps - Two decades back fresh out of MBA college, I started my journey as an entrepreneur, looks like a full circle for â€˜start upâ€™ again or â€˜tread a path not taken so far in another once in a life time companyâ€™. Iâ€™m excited, confident and also a bit anxious about this new journey. And thatâ€™s how I have always lived my life, â€˜to the fullest with no regretsâ€™ ðŸ˜Š #amazon #thankyou"
