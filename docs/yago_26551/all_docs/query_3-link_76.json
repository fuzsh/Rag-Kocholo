        "text": "On 6 June 1901, Jagadis Chandra Bose read a paper at the Royal Society in London, entitled ‘On Electric Response of Inorganic Substances’. Bose showed that external stimuli, such as poison or electricity, have a similar effect on living tissue, such as plants or muscle, and inorganic matter, such as iron oxide or tin. Bose recorded response curves for muscle, plant, and metal and was thus able to show parallels between the living and the non-living. This was not only revolutionary, but also unacceptable to parts of his audience. At this talk, Bose encountered two difficulties: firstly, in upsetting traditional disciplinary boundaries between physics and physiology, he, the physicist, undermined the authority of the physiologists who were present. Consequently, they attacked Bose’s findings on the grounds of the second difficulty, namely the common prejudice against Indians according to which the Indian mind, in its pursuit of metaphysic ideals, was unsuited to scientific thoughts an...\n\nWe have known about quite a few scholars who all had their graduations & masters in basic sciences yet were deeply involved (contributing yeomanly) with the queries as to what did the past men & minds do, where, when and how ? i.e., History. In this ‘short note’ we topically revisit the academic aspects of the Frenchman scholar Mr. Louis de Broglie. We do so to celebrate the green field domain of ‘History of Sciences’. At end we append a select Bibliography of the published works of author No. 1 in the domain of ‘history of sciences’ so that young scholars may benefit\n\nThe 250 years from the second half of the seventeenth century saw the birth of modern physics and its growth into one of the most successful of the sciences.The reader will find here the lives of fifty of the most remarkable physicists from that era described in brief biographies. All the characters profiled have made important contributions to physics, through their ideas, through their teaching, or in other ways.The emphasis is on their varied life-stories, not on the details of their achievements, but, when read in sequence, the biographies, which are organized chronologically, convey in human terms something of the way in which physics was created.Scientific and mathematical detail is kept to a minimum, so the reader who is interested in physics, but perhaps lacks the background to follow technical accounts, will find this collection an inviting and easy path through the subject’s modern development."
