Statistically speaking, the staggering death toll (of 5,243) means that the human bombs were able to kill 476 people every year on average and 40 people each month since 2002. Likewise, Pakistan suffered an average 81 suicide bombings every year and seven attacks a month over the past eleven years. Pakistan had experienced only one suicide bombing before 9/11 when the Egyptian Embassy in Islamabad was targeted. However, over the next 11 years between January 2002 and December 2012, the human bombs let loose a reign of terror in almost every nook and cranny of the country, killing over 5,000 people in almost 900 suicide attacks.

The ECP in principle decided to allow candidates to bring along armed private security guards to polling stations. The meeting was presided over by Chief Election Commissioner Justice (retd) Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim and attended by the Federal Secretaries for Defence, Foreign Affairs, Establishment and States and Frontier Regions, the Additional Interior Secretary, Provincial Chief Secretaries and Inspector General of Police of provinces. A participant quoted Defence Secretary Lieutenant-General (retd) Asif Yasin Malik as saying it was not possible to provide army personnel for each of around 80,000 polling stations. In an apparent reaction to the CEC’s statements calling for deployment of Army at all the polling stations, he said 200,000 Army personnel could not be spared for this purpose. The secretary said two soldiers would be needed for every polling station as there would be at least two polling booths at each station. Besides, additional staff will be required for logistic and command arrangements. He pointed out that the Army was already engaged in defending the borders, besides deployment in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and providing security to the staff of some multinational companies.

Hekmatyar, a former Prime Minister who leads Afghanistan’s second largest militant group Hizb-i-Islami, told Britain’s Daily Telegraph newspaper that he was against the blowing up of schools and educational institutions “not only in Afghanistan and Pakistan but elsewhere in the world.” “I don’t think that a devoted Mujahid could be involved in such things,” said Hekmatyar, accusing ‘foreign intelligence agencies’ of being involved in such attacks. The TTP’s blocking of girls’ schooling was thrown into the spotlight in October 2012 by its attempted murder of 15-year-old education campaigner Malala Yusufzai on her school bus. Hekmatyar indicated that Hizb-i-Islami, notorious for its bloody siege of Kabul in the 1990s, has softened some of its hardline Islamist policies which included banning women from education.

We are continuing with our operations geared towards eliminating terrorism,” a senior military officer said. He said that although the offer was yet to be fully dissected it could be a tactical move by the militant outfit given its timing and the conditions that had been set. “Political leaders should capitalise on the situation,” he said and referred to pressure on the terrorist group generated by the Army’s counter-terrorism operations. Militant leaders in back-to-back statements sent to the media last week offered a ceasefire if the government ‘adopted Shariat after changing the Constitution, revised foreign policy and ended its engagement with the war on terror in Afghanistan’.

According to the new Army Doctrine, ongoing activities of Taliban militants in the restive tribal regions and unabated terrorist attacks on government installations in major cities are posing a real threat to Pakistan’s security. The Army Doctrine deals with operational preparedness and is reviewed on and off. For decades, the army considered India as its No 1 enemy but growing extremism in the country compelled the military authorities to review its strategy. A senior military official confirmed to The Express Tribune that a new chapter has been added to the Army Doctrine that would now also include threats posed by sub-conventional warfare. “Pakistan’s armed forces were trained for conventional warfare but the current security situation necessitated the change,” said the official requesting anonymity. “Forces fighting on the front-line in the tribal regions are now being trained according to the requirements of sub-conventional warfare,” he added.

Violence in the province has claimed over 2,100 lives and left 3,845 injured in over 3,232 incidents of bomb blasts and rocket attacks in this period. Amidst rising sectarian strife and targeted killings, the government’s inability to deal with the situation appears more jarring than ever. Throughout the province, sectarian killings remain the biggest challenge. From 2008 to 2012, 758 members of the Shia community were killed in 478 incidents. Of these, 338 victims belonged to the Hazara community, indicating that Hazaras remain the prime targets of these aggressions. The province has become a base for a decade-long insurgency as well as a killing field for various sects. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) allegedly keeps targeting Shias throughout Balochistan. Accordingly, officials have beefed up safety measures from Quetta to Taftan and are even planning to hold meetings with Iranian authorities to discuss possible arrangements to facilitate the movement of Hazaras from Marriabad to Hazara Town and Hazar Ganji. The findings also uncover staggering ‘kill and dump’ statistics. Around 570 dead bodies have been found strewn throughout the province, with 370 of the victims belonging to the Baloch community and 89 to the Pashtun community. The rest remain unidentified to this day. Further still, over 402 non-Baloch have been killed in 498 incidents, and over 486 injured in multiple attacks. Not surprisingly, security personnel have also suffered great losses. As many as 340 Frontier Corps personnel and 380 Policemen have lost their lives in the line of duty, and 508 security officials in total have been left wounded. Analysts say that despite the staggering figures, the Provincial Government is yet to review regulations pertaining to the movement of pilgrims under the Travel Agency Act of 1976. In one instance, police decided to refer the investigation of ‘sensitive cases’ to the Crime Investigation Department after the arrest of alleged terrorist Sher Dil of LeJ, also known as Babu, in a bid to curb violence in Balochistan.

The commission’s chairman, Justice (retired) Javed Iqbal, submitted the report to Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf, a statement from Ashraf’s office said. Pakistani officials say Ashraf will decide whether to keep the report classified or make it public, but observers have said they expect little of substance to be revealed.

Metropolitan Police officers escorted Naseer from Belmarsh Prison to London’s Luton Airport where he was taken into custody by US authorities. “We can confirm that today, January 3, Abid Naseer was extradited to America where he is accused of terrorism offences. His case is now a matter for the US authorities,” a statement from the Home Office said. The 26-year-old is wanted by the US authorities over allegations that he provided material support to al Qaeda and conspired to use explosives. He was named as a suspect in an alleged transatlantic plot directed by Pakistan-based al Qaeda groups. Naseer was originally arrested in Britain along with 10 other Pakistani men in 2009 over a suspected bomb plot. But they were released without charge after prosecutors said there was not enough evidence, and ordered to be deported. An immigration judge subsequently ruled that despite Naseer being “an al Qaeda operative who posed and still poses a serious threat”, he could not be returned to Pakistan as his safety could not be guaranteed. In July 2010, Naseer was arrested again on a US arrest warrant. In January 2012, a judge approved Naseer’s extradition to the US. He appealed to the European Court of Human Rights but his case was thrown out in December.

Two of his deputies were killed with him, but a close associate and militant ‘commander’ who goes by the name Salahuddin Ayubi has been anointed his successor, Pakistani intelligence officials said. “Ayubi, whose real name is Bahawal Khan, was appointed as top commander of the group after Nazir’s funeral,” one of the officials added. He said that Ayubi, who belonged to Nazir’s Kaka Khel sub-division of the main Wazir tribe, had been very close to Nazir for more than 16 years. Another official described Ayubi as being in his mid 30s, well built and well-respected among his tribesmen and the group. Taj Wazir, from the Tuji Khel tribe, was appointed deputy after Rafey Khan, who was deputy to Nazir, was also killed in drone strike. Ainullah, a local commander in the group, confirmed the appointments. As reported earlier, Nazir was killed along with nine other militants in the South Waziristan Agency of FATA on January 3.

It is our policy to resolve issues through negotiations, but if needed we will carry out military operations,” Kaira remarked. He said the government’s anti-terrorism policy was in place and the forces concerned, including intelligence agencies, were working on the approved strategy. “We are fighting, taking territories back from them. Many hardened militants have been killed and the success is visible too,” Kaira said. “But we need to understand that we are not dealing with just four dacoits or a small gang of outlaws.” He said religious extremism was the outcome of a particular mindset and criticised the media for “being soft on those who were supporting extremists”. “It is you people who should come forward and highlight those who are giving them the leverage, even providing them with flagged cars,” Kaira added.

UN agencies suspended work on a nationwide campaign to inoculate children against the highly infectious disease after nine health workers were murdered in a string of attacks in the northwest and Karachi in December. Pakistan is one of only three countries in the world where polio is endemic, but efforts to stamp out the disease have been hampered by resistance from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has banned vaccination teams from some areas, and distrust.

In an article in The Hill newspaper, which is distributed among US lawmakers, the Pakistani ambassador assured the lawmakers that Pakistan was on their side as they try to make an important security and political transition in Afghanistan. Underlining Pakistan’s efforts to fight terrorism at home, the ambassador noted that in an historic joint session, the Pakistan’s parliament had adopted unanimously a resolution condemning terrorism. She said Pakistan was also deeply aware of concern of members of the Congress about US casualties in Afghanistan attributed to improvised explosive devices (IEDs). She pointed out that the situation in Pakistan’s parliament was similar as the country also had suffered 15,851 IED-related deaths. This was 43 per cent of all casualties over the past four years. “We identify with the US on this issue,” she said while noting that only one-tenth of 1 per cent of calcium ammonium nitrate produced in Pakistan as fertiliser was allegedly smuggled across the border into Afghanistan. Pakistan was effectively monitoring 99.9 per cent of its production, while still waiting for a matching interdiction on the other side, she said. “Nevertheless, we are still determined to keep our shoulder to this wheel and stop that leakage too,” she added.

The drone targeted the Taliban leader’s moving convoy. “Maulvi Nazir was on his way to Wana from Birmal when the convoy was hit in Sarkundi area (in Birmal tehsil), killing him and nine others,” officials sources said. Maulvi Nazir is the second top Taliban leader to be killed in a drone strike after Baitullah Mehsud, who was chief of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) when he was killed in 2009. Maulvi Nazir had ‘earned fame’ in spring 2007 when he led a successful uprising against foreign militants in Ahmedzai Wazir-held areas, ousting Uzbek militants along with their local supporters. He linked administration of polio vaccination to cessation of drone strikes and no polio drive could be launched in Ahmedzai Wazir areas since the ban in June 2012. Security agencies warned the Government of likely backlash from the supporters of Maulvi Nazir. “There may be backlash from a Taliban group and the federal government should direct all provincial capitals to increase vigilance against any threat,” security officials spoke on condition of anonymity. The Pentagon (US) welcomed reports that Maluvi Nazir was killed in a drone strike, saying his death would represent a “major development.” Pentagon spokesman George Little did not confirm the reports of the killing, but said, “If the reports are true, then this would be a significant blow, and would be very helpful not just to the United States but also to our Pakistani partners.” Dawn, however, reported that Nazir was killed along with his five guards when a missile hit his vehicle while he was going to Wana from Birmal on January 2. Maulvi Nazir’s key aide Rata Khan was among the other militants killed when the vehicle was attacked near Angoor Adda on the Afghan border, the official said. Nazir had survived a suicide bombing in November 29, 2012. The TTP, the umbrella organisation of Pakistani militant groups, denied its involvement, but Nazir, under pressure from the government, ordered the expulsion of Mehsud tribesmen from Wana. The TTP leadership comes from the Mehsud tribe. He had entered into a peace agreement with the government after his group expelled militants of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, led then by Tahir Uldashev, in 2007 from the area. Nazir’s fighters avoided attacking government and Security Forces’ installations in the tribal region and cooperated with the local administration, an official said. The military is believed to have struck a non-aggression pact with Nazir ahead of its 2009 operation against militants in South Waziristan. Nazir was understood to be close to the al Qaeda-linked Haqqani Network. Nazir had property in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. He earlier used to be a member of the Hizb-i-Islami, an Afghan militant group. Nazir’s group quickly appointed his close aide Bawal Khan as a replacement, according to one of his aides. But a Reuters report named the successor as Salahuddin Ayubi.

Asiya Hameed, a teacher of Jamia Hafsa and custodian of the record of the girl’s seminary, was among the 16 witnesses who recorded their statements with the commission on January 3. “Since I was not in the madrassa during the operation, I don’t know the exact details,” she said when asked by Justice Shehzado Sheikh of the Federal Shariat Court, whether she had the record of the girls who were on rolls, or went missing during the operation. She said her uncle had taken her away from the mosque complex, where the girl’s seminary operated, on July 3, 2007, the day the operation began. When she rejoined Jamia Hafsa, she said, she did not find the record, which security agencies might have taken away. Maulana Aziz, who also acted as principal of Jamia Faridia located in Sector E-7, had similarly told the commission in his testimony on December 31 that he could not compile the record of the students killed or went missing in the operation as he was arrested when he came out of the mosque on July 4, 2007, the day after the army laid siege to the mosque.

Comparatively, in 2011, there were 2,895 such attacks and 7,107 consequent fatalities. Karachi, Quetta, Kurram Agency and Gilgit were the hardest hit, witnessing more than 85 percent of all terrorist incidents in 2012, while the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerged as a major actor responsible for the prevalent instability. Balochistan remained the focal point of nationalist insurgency and sectarian violence, witnessing 474 terrorist attacks, the highest for any region. The TTP-infested and militancy-hit KP and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) remained second and third most volatile regions, with 456 and 388 terrorist attacks reported, respectively. Meanwhile, 187 terrorist attacks were reported in Karachi and 28 in other parts of Sindh; 26 in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB); 17 in Punjab and one in Islamabad. The country witnessed a 53 percent increase in sectarian violence. Non-sectarian attacks, on the other hand, decreased by 20 percent. The number of suicide attacks across the country fell by 27 percent. Meanwhile, the US drone strikes and the consequent killings also recorded a 40 percent decrease. The number of cross-border attacks and clashes decreased from 84 in 2011 to 79 in 2012. However, the casualties in these attacks increased by 25 percent. “Most of the cross-border attacks and clashes (70%) were reported from Pakistan’s western border with Afghanistan, including attacks reportedly carried out by militants of the TTP’s Swat chapter hiding in Afghanistan’s Kunar and Nuristan provinces,” said the PIPS report.

The spokesperson strongly condemned the drone strikes in the country’s tribal belt saying, “We strongly condemn drone attacks as they are in violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.” In another context he said that Pakistan and Afghanistan were making efforts to hold an Ulema Conference in January in Kabul to help advance the peace process in the war-torn country. The spokesperson confirmed that Pakistan had so far released 26 Afghan Taliban at the request of Kabul. However, he did not provide further details whether those released were still in Pakistan or reached Afghanistan.

The sources said that fighter jet bombed the sanctuaries of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Dwatoy and Bragat areas, killing 20 militants and causing injuries to 12 others. The official sources said that ‘commander’ Abdul Wali alias Umar Khalid, designated head of TTP for Tirah valley, was also present in Dwatoy at the time of the attack. Some reports suggested that he was among the dead. However, it couldn’t be verified from independent sources or the TTP due to lack of communication facilities in the Tirah Valley. The Kukikhel part of the Tirah valley fell to the TTP a few months back after the militant group defeated the Kukikhel Afridi tribal lashkar (tribal militia). The sources said that the ‘commander’ Tariq Afridi-led faction of TTP having bases in the valley had claimed responsibility for the assassination of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Senior Minister Bashir Bilour in Peshawar and also for the killing of 22 kidnapped members of the Levies force in Frontier Region Peshawar. Sources said that TTP cadres had celebrated the death of Bashir Bilour by resorting to festive firing for two hours in Dwatoy and surrounding areas. The fresh airstrikes conducted by the Security Forces (SFs) might be a reaction to the assassination of Bashir Bilour and the deaths of 22 Levies personnel.

Minister Mian Iftikhar Hussain said a lot had been spoken in condemnation of militant attacks and therefore, it was direly needed to take militancy to its logical end. He said there were two options with the Government either to hold dialogue with militants and if it was not possible, then the second option was intensive operation against them.

According to the Citizens-Police Liaison Committee, 2,124 people were killed in Karachi in 2012, the worst year since records began nearly 20 years ago. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) says 1,800 people died in targeted killings in the first nine months of 2012. In 2011, it put the number at 1,000, which was then the deadliest in 16 years. Police insist killings related to ethnic and sectarian disputes accounted for only 20 percent of the murders, but rights activists say a shortage of law enforcement officers is part of the problem. “Karachi is becoming a city where controlling violence is becoming increasingly difficult because of an insufficient police force, which is less than 30,000 for around 18 million people,” says Zohra Yusuf, HRCP chairwoman. Karachi, a business centre with a population of 18 million, accounts for 20 percent of GDP, 57 percent of tax revenue and elects 33 lawmakers to the Federal Parliament. Karachi has all the ingredients of an explosive cocktail – gang warfare, land grabbings, drugs, extremism, political rivalries, ethnic tensions, extreme poverty and a mushrooming population owing to migration.
