        "text": "-by Muhammad Sanan Khan\n\nIn a country which is taking its nascent steps in the world of science, Dr. Hafeez Horaani is one of the pioneers in this world for our country.\n\nHailing from Karachi, he is a particle physicist, with a specialization in accelerator physics, and a research scientist at the CERN. Nowadays, Mr. Hoorani works at the National Center for Physics, with research focus in elementary particle physics and high energy physics.\n\nDr. Hafeez Horaani is certainly among the league of the top scientists of our country for all his works and accomplishments. His efforts to make Pakistan a part of CERN are highly commendable and they are a big push forward for the country.\n\nWhat is CERN? CERN is the European Organization for Nuclear Research bent on seeking answers related to the origin of humankind such as; what is the universe made of? How did it start? Using some of the world‚Äôs most powerful particle accelerators.\n\nDr. Hoorani joined CERN in 1989 and due to his efforts, in 2000, Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (led by nuclear physicist Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad) signed an agreement with CERN. This agreement opened the door for Pakistani physicists to collaborate with CERN‚Äôs particle physics project.\n\nOur country needs more men like Dr. Hoorani so that in the race to win the world with science and technology our country can make a mark of its own. More power to you, Mr. Hoorani and to PAKISTAN. Ciao till next time.\n\n‚Äì By Usman Khan, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences\n\n‚Äì Comic by Faiza Syed, Atta-ur-Rahman School of Applied Biosciences\n\nMany of you will have heard about CERN by now‚Ä¶ for those who are wondering what it stands for, let me explain‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs an acronym of the European Organization of Nuclear Research ‚Äì Well, of the French equivalent of that.\n\nIn there, they have got the biggest machines on earth to study some of the smallest particles in the universe, and they, armed with their weapons, aim to crack huge secrets that the universe is hiding within the folds of its many galaxies, and to grasp the knowledge of its very existence.\n\nThe most recent of CERN‚Äôs research involves the discovery of speeds of particles that are faster than light. ‚ÄòWhat type of ‚Äúludicrous notion‚Äù is this‚Äô was the first thought that came into my mind when I heard about CERN‚Äôs research, though the words that escaped my mouth explained my emotions much clearly, but can‚Äôt be put here because many will think them to be rather rude and immature. But what else could I have said? I first heard about the very famous ‚ÄòEinstein‚Äôs mass energy relationship‚Äô when I didn‚Äôt even know what mass and energy meant. Gradually I absorbed it in, though never bright enough to understand fully what Einstein actually meant, I grew up believing it, and now, suddenly out of nowhere, CERN is trying to claim that all of it was wrong‚Ä¶ The eccentric, lunatic genius, Einstein was wrong about the fact that ‚Äòno particle could travel faster than light‚Äô. Whole of the Relativistic Mechanics by Einstein was based on this one simple assumption which many other great personalities in history, whose credibility as ‚Äògenius freaks‚Äô can never be denied, also believed to be true. So I think it wasn‚Äôt wrong for me to use a little slang and vernacular language to express my emotions, which, by the way, I very much tried to control, was it?\n\nWhen you come to think of it, a simple fact that the energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can only change its form, has been the basis of all the theories succeeding it. According to Einstein‚Äôs mass energy relationship E=mc2, the mass of a particle travelling at the speed of light is totally converted into energy. So if the particle was to travel even with a greater speed than that of light then where is this extra energy coming from? Makes your head spin, doesn‚Äôt it? I am sure that CERN will soon have an answer for that but who is to say that what CERN discovers is always true. So much confusion, such imbalance of thoughts and whirl of emotions‚Ä¶ I just want to blow up my brain. But still I can‚Äôt answer a simple question ‚Äòwhat to believe and what not to‚Äô?\n\nThere are thousands of links, posts and comments regarding the current research of CERN, but whenever I hear about this particular discovery all I actually hear is blah, blah, blah. It seems my brain‚Äôs been rendered unable to filter or process the information about the ‚ÄòNeutrinos‚Äô research of CERN.\n\nOn one side is the most genius person in the history of, like forever, whose ideas are still indigestible by the best of researchers, whereas on other side one of the World‚Äôs biggest Research Organization, CERN, which is claiming to have repeated the same experiment under exactly the same conditions and have obtained the same results even after 15,000 times.\n\nJames Gillies, spokesman for CERN, spoke with RFE/RL correspondent Ron Synovitz about the discovery of the neutrino particles travelling faster than light does.\n\nRFE/RL: CAN you explain more about how the CERN experiments were conducted?\n\nGillies: Einstein‚Äôs Theory of General Relativity says there is a cosmic speed limit and that is the speed of light ‚Äì and that nothing can go faster than that. What this measurement shows is a measurement of the time it takes for a beam of neutrinos to fly from CERN ‚Äì 730 kilometres through the Earth ‚Äì to a particle detector underground at the place called Gran Sasso in Italy. It‚Äôs about 732 kilometres away and the time of flight is about 2.4 milliseconds to do that. And what they appear to be measuring is that the neutrinos are arriving early. Only very slightly early ‚Äì it‚Äôs a 20 part per million effect, but early nevertheless.\n\nAND the first thought that came to my mind after reading this piece of information provided by a CERN‚Äôs official was ‚Äúwhy has the neutrino got to be so selfish to arrive ahead of his other fellow particles?‚Äù Couldn‚Äôt it have SLOWED UP A LITTLE so it could have arrived with its other fellow particles? I mean if I were to go somewhere with my friends, I would match their pace so that we can reach our destination together‚Ä¶ But NOOO, the stupid neutrino didn‚Äôt care a bit about friends. Just showing off, proving to others that it is faster and better than its other fellow particles.\n\nCERN is now putting together a whole new experiment to check whether their discovery is 100% correct. No one knows when it‚Äôll be complete. This discovery is still a theory and not a fact. So there‚Äôs an equal chance of either one being wrong i.e. Einstein or CERN. But since my great hero Einstein isn‚Äôt here to prove that his research is right, I am willing to bet in his favor üòõ For me, he‚Äôs still at the very top of true ingenuity. So people make up your minds and take your bets. I can see that future beholds a great revolution for science, no matter which of the two is right.\n\nLike Shakespeare said ‚Äúto be or not to be: that is the question‚Äù but I am going to modify that a little as I say ‚Äúto believe or not to believe: that is the question‚Äù."
