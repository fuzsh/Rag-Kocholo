Â In front of Geneva University's crowded auditorium, Albert Hofmann and Steve Myers received title of Doctor Honoris Causa last Friday 8 June. The two members of CERN thereby received the University's highest distinction. This honour comes in recognition of their careers in the service of accelerator physics and their essential contribution to the success of LEP. Steve Myers joined CERN in August 1972 to work as engineer-in charge of the Intersecting Storage Rings collider (ISR). He was responsible for the acceleration by phase displacement of the high intensity beams to 31 GeV/c. He also worked on many other topics, notably the beam-beam effect in the ISR. Albert Hofmann arrived at CERN from the Cambridge Electron Accelerator (CEA) near Boston, USA, in 1973 - already with an excellent reputation as accelerato...\n\nCERN's Community \"Log Book\" turns 50\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nKatarina Anthony\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFor five decades, the CERN Bulletin has been a staple of the Organization. As CERN has grown as a laboratory and a community, the Bulletin has been there to cover each development as it happens. In honour of the publication's 50th anniversary, we're taking a trip through CERNâs history via the headings and hidden corners of its internal newsletter. Â Â It's 1965 and CERN - now 11 years old - has matured from a simple lab to a fledgling community. While news could once spread in a single afternoon, CERN's growth necessitated a new approach to the sharing of internal information. Meanwhile, the CERN Courier - the only publication in town - was approaching a more global physics audience â an audience for whom CERN road closures were not breaking news. And so, in March 1965, the Weekly Bulletin was born. What was meant as a simple newsletter of events and internal announcements quickly developed into a wider source of news about CERN....\n\n\"Infinitely CERN Memories from 50 years of research\" CERN and Editions Suzanne Hurter are publishing a beautiful book, \"Infinitely CERN\", to commemorate the human and scientific adventure of CERN.\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nMaximilien Brice\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe book tells the history of CERN through the voices of those who lived it.

Arriving at CERN as Visiting Scientist in June 1966, I joined the Anti-Apartheid Movement immediately. We multiplied the initiatives at CERN and outside of CERN until the release of Mandela with citizens of Geneva, but also with \"citizens of the world\", who ignored the ban on political activity, particularly for international civil servants. The Anti-Apartheid Movement of Geneva soon became the Anti-Apartheid Movement of Switzerland. It was also the first Anti-Apartheid Movement outside of South Africa. CERN today is honoured to have brought it to the baptismal font thanks to the initiative of several colleagues, including Mike Pentz, president of the CERN staff Association for two years (1961 ï­ 1963) and also a refugee from South Africa in Europe.

A cause of outrage and disdain in todayâs (Western societies, the notion of restoring honour through a violent act is, in fact, deeply rooted in European legal and cultural history. By examining French, Anglo-Saxon, German and Italian examples, it is revealed that to varying degrees emotions, and, in some cases honour in particular, were accommodated in legislation as granting the perpetrator extenuating circumstances. Adultery in particular was thought to compromise the honour of husbands, thus entrenching an inherently gendered conception of honour. However, leniency of the law was mostly dependent on âºheat of the momentâ¹ arguments, attempts to avenge the violation of oneâs honour, rather than premeditated, cold-blooded revenge killings restoring the collective honour of the family. By discriminating between notions of individual and collective (family honour, examples from European history exhibit a qualitative difference compared to modern day honour killings. The full extent of hypocrisy in judging modern day (Muslim honour killings, however, becomes apparent when considering that gendered concepts of emotions and honour only disappeared from European legal thought after the 1970s, partly following feminist criticism.\n\nThe hundredth Gentner Doctoral Student has started at CERN\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCERN Bulletin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAlmost ten years after the start of the programme in 2007, the hundredth Gentner Doctoral Student started his PhD at CERN.

Here ird, sharaf or izzat and shame are adhered to particular moral codes that are more likely to be found in the Quran. This clichÃ©d version of HBV frames Muslim womenâs sexual autonomy as exceptionally regulated, most commonly by male family members with the complicity of female relatives. In its most extreme (and publicly known form, HBV is epitomised by the âhonourâ killings that come to the attention of the criminal justice system and, as a consequence, the media. Yet emerging research shows that HBV unfolds through increasingly punitive systems of social punishment, which is neither unique to Islam, nor religious communities more generally. In this paper, it is argued that the construction of HBV as a matter of deviant and antiquated Muslim honour codes is Islamophobic and that a more productive lens through which to understand collective familial violence may lie in the conceptual framework of heteronormativity.\n\nMenâs and womenâs honour\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMai, Anne-Marie\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis article has the conceptions of honour in Henrik Ibsenâs A Dollâs House (1879/1889) as its springboard, includes the concept of honour in Thit Jensenâs novels about the modern, emancipated woman Gerd.

It may be that culture impacts tendencies to \"fight\" or \"flee\" from social threat. Honour cultures, including the American South, permit or even promote aggression in response to honour-threats. Thus, social anxiety in the South may be more associated with aggression than in non-honour cultures. In the current sample, region moderated the relation between social anxiety and aggression; social anxiety related positively to reactive (but not proactive) aggression among Southerners (n = 285), but not Midwesterners (n = 258). Participant sex further moderated the relationship, such that it was significant only for Southern women. Also, for Southerners, prototypically masculine honour-concerns mediated the relationship between social anxiety and reactive aggression. Cultural factors may play key roles in aggressive behaviour among some socially anxious individuals.\n\nGeorges Charpak: 1924-2010\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2010-01-01\n\nAll of CERN was deeply saddened to learn the news that our friend and colleague, Georges Charpak, passed away on 29 September 2010. Â There are few people who can honestly be said to have changed the world, but Charpak was one of them. Born in Dabrovika, Poland on 8 March 1924, Charpak fled the Nazi regime under a false identity and moved to France where he joined the resistance. Arrested and deported to Dachau, he returned to France after the war and took French nationality in 1946. A student of FrÃ©dÃ©ric Joliot-Curie at the CollÃ¨ge de France, he joined CERN in 1959, just five years after the Organizationâs foundation, and he certainly left his mark. From the start, Charpak applied himself to the development of new particle detector techniques. His outstanding and pioneering efforts revolutionised particle physics, taking the field into the electronic age.

In 2014 a pregnant woman was killed in front of Lahore High Court, by her family members, in the name of honour. This study was conducted to determine the perspective of university students on honour killing with specific reference to one such killing incident in Lahore. Cumulatively, 989 students participated in the survey. Compared with female students, male students were less likely to agree and were more unequivocal that a woman has a right to marry any man she wants despite her family's disapproval, in a statistically significant manner. Similarly, male students were statistically significantly more likely to report that killing in the name of honour is always justified and were less equivocal about it compared to female students. Nonetheless, cumulatively 824 (83.3%) students believed that killing in the name of honour is not always justified.\n\nFirst âGentner Doktorâ finishes PhD at CERN\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nJordan Juras\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn 2007, the CERN Doctoral Student Programme saw the addition of the Gentner Doctoral Student Programme, named in honour of the celebrated nuclear physicist, Wolfgang Gentner.

To honour one of the greatest physicists of the century, who died last October, and a staunch friend, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste has announced the Paul Adrien Dirac Gold Medal Award, to be given annually for highest achievement in theoretical physics. The International Committee for Future Accelerators, ICFA, held its twelfth meeting at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay, on 10 April. The CERN Accelerator School was greatly encouraged by the response to the General Accelerator Physics Course organized last year in collaboration with the Orsay and Saclay Laboratories in France. On 11 March, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste paid tribute to the memory of Alfred Kastler, Nobel Laureate for Physics 1966 and Chairman of the ICTP Scientific Council from 1970 to 1982, who died on 7 January 1984.\n\nHonour and Shame in a Church of England Primary School\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWilson, Tom\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWhile students of Islamic societies and cultures are aware of the influence of dynamics of honour and shame on behaviour, these factors are not always recognized by those who engage with Muslims in the UK.

In both the case of Dr Maurice Hutzler, who committed suicide after conflicts with senior colleagues at the Gisela Children's Hospital and a sentence of the court of honour of the Munich Medical District Society, and the Berlin \"patient trade\" affair, in which the medical professors Ernst von Leyden, Hermann Senator, Karl Anton Ewald and Carl Posner were accused of having made payments to middlemen for bringing them lucrative private patients, notions of personal and professional honour played a central role. The Munich case highlighted shortcomings of the Bavarian medical court of honour system, which was less developed than its Prussian counterpart. The analysis of the two cases suggests that the ethics of medical practice in early twentieth-century Germany should be viewed as part of a culture of honour.\n\nCMS and ATLAS honour their suppliers\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2001-01-01\n\nIn order to motivate the hundreds of companies building their detectors, the CMS and ATLAS collaborations have recently been handing out awards of excellence to their top suppliers. At its second ceremony of this kind, CMS honoured four of its suppliers, while ATLAS for the first time paid tribute to two of its contractors. The atmosphere in the Council Chamber was festive rather than formal at the start of CMS week on Monday 5 March. Before embarking upon a long series of seminars and presentations, the Collaboration held its second awards ceremony to honour its top suppliers. By paying tribute to the exceptional efforts of certain suppliers, the Collaboration's aim is to motivate all the firms, some 500 in total, taking part in the experiment's construction. The CMS Awards panel thus singles out contractors who have not only provided full satisfaction in terms of compliance with specifications, quality and deadlines, but have in addition provided original solutions to delicate problems.

Answer: first place and fifth place. In short, the team which has reigned supreme in first place since 2001, the \"Shabbys\", decided to spice up the race this year by merging with their arch rivals, the \"Latinos Volantes\", themselves no strangers to the podium. And at the winning line, it was the hybrid formation, \"Shabbys Volantes\", which took the honours (no surprises there!). Sadly, they were unable to beat the Shabbysâ previous record nor get anywhere near the all-time race record of 10 minutes and 13 seconds for the 3.9-km course, held for a quarter of a century by the \"UA1 Strollers\".

CERN is taking part in this event by hosting a temporary post office on the PrÃ©vessin site, which will sell the stamp with a special âfirst dayâ postmark before it goes on general sale. Â Â Georges Charpak arrived at CERN in 1959 and, in the lateÂ 1960s,Â revolutionised particle detection technology by developing the multiwire proportional chamber. This technique brought particle detectors into the electronic era, setting physicists free from the laborious task of studying photographs one by one. In 1992, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention. Charpak chambers are still used today in the LHC detectors and have paved the way for the technology in numerous other modern detectors. In the 1990s, Charpak was involved in developing medical applications based on particle detection technology.

Pedagogies of engagement, like service-learning, are touted as one means to achieve these goals. Connections between first-year experience and service-learning programs have been slow to develop. Further, empirical studies on service-learning in university honours education are similarly scarce. This article examines first-semester honours postsecondary students' sense of civic responsibility before and after completing a service-learning program linking a course on the Evolution of Community to direct volunteerism in struggling schools. Based on pre-post-responses (n=119 to the Level III-Civic Responsibility Survey, analysis of variance with repeated measures showed that participants' sense of civic responsibility was significantly increased over time on each of the dependent variables (i.e., community connectedness, civic attitudes, civic efficacy. Community connectedness scores increased significantly at the .005 level, F(1, 118 = 9.703, p = .002. The changes in civic attitudes and civic efficacy scores were extremely significant at the .0005 level, F(1, 118 = 14.498, p < .0005 and F(1, 118 = 23.56, p < .0005, respectively.\n\nHigh point for CERN and high-temperature superconductors\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAmalia Ballarino is named the Superconductor Industry Person of the year 2006.

Stander\n\n2003-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Recently, studies have illustrated that honour and shame were core values in the Mediterranean world in general and in the Bible too. These studies usually resort to classical sources to support the claims being made. Modern scholars, who take the historical-critical approach seriously, have come to realize the importance of reading the Bible according to its appropriate cultural context, which of necessity includes an appreciation of honour and shame as social core values. However, the article shows that patristic sources have been neglected by many scholars who study the social values of the ancient world. This article illustrates the importance of these values for patristic authors. John Chrysostomâs homilies on the Gospel of John are used as an example to prove how he employed values such as honour and shame as exegetical keys to unlock the meaning of Johnâs gospel.\n\nStaff members with 25 years' service at CERN in 2005\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe 74 staff members who have spent 25 years at CERN in 2005 were invited by the Director-General to a reception in their honour on 22 November.
