It intelligently adapts to changes in sunlight, seamlessly transitioning from light to dark and back again, almost like magic ✨ This means you can always enjoy perfect indoor lighting without worrying about glare or heat. It's this dynamic adaptation that makes Sunphade truly unique and magical.

The iconic Arctic species would normally feed on ringed seals that they catch on ice floors offshore. But as the ice disappears in a warming world, many bears are spending greater amounts of time on shore, eating bird's eggs, berries and grass. Hence, The polar bear has become the poster child for the growing threat of climate change in the Arctic, but the reality of the impact on this species is complicated. #ArcticSea #climatechange #globalimpact Sourced from: https://lnkd.in/gCR5pSus This content is jointly prepared by ripple2wave and ZWEEC Analytics Pte Ltd.

Read the entire article to get the yet another unintended consequence (albeit a significantly positive one). A few interesting nuggets of information as well. A question for auto-enthusiasts: Shouldn't the gearing ratio change to adapt to this new reality? Is it already happening? Or is it unlikely to have a significant impact?\n\nHere is a next excellent YouTube video about the propagation of surges and waves on transmission lines as well as a visualization of the effect of reactive power compensation.
