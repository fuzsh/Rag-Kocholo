INTRODUCTION\n\nThe British Journal of Cancer predicts that the lifetime risk of cancer is approximately 50% for people born since 1960. At some stage, all adults under the age of 65 are likely to be diagnosed with cancer during their life. 1 These grim figures do not bode well for Pakistan, a lower middle‐income country (LMIC) with grossly unavailable facilities for cancer care amidst an increasing cancer burden. With an annual cancer incidence of 0.17 million, Pakistan faces multiple challenges in the field of oncology. 2 As of 2014, Pakistan's total expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP was only 2.6%. 3 The human development index for Pakistan was 0.562 in 2017, ranking it at 150 out of 189 countries. 4\n\nThis review aims to highlight the current cancer burden in Punjab, as well as to identify the existing facilities for both cancer management and training. It also aims to underline the challenges faced by healthcare professionals (HCPs) in delivering optimal treatment for cancer. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide key recommendations that can be utilized by policy makers to improve cancer care facilities in Punjab.\n\n2. METHODOLOGY\n\nKeywords such as “cancer treatment,” “facilities,” and “Pakistan” were used to search Pubmed Database. After filtering for publication dates within last 20 years, 36 results were generated. After sifting based on a personal reference list as well as for relevance to current topic, 16 articles were finally reviewed. No previous systematic review was found regarding the state of cancer therapeutics in Pakistan or Punjab. A number of other online references were consulted for updated statistics regarding cancer incidence and prevalence in Pakistan, including Globocan, and the Punjab Cancer Registry (PCR). Finally, novel statistics regarding current state of access to cancer facilities were drawn from personal references as well as from studies conducted in other LMICs\n\n3. CANCER BURDEN IN PAKISTAN\n\nGlobocan 2018 2 estimates that the total number of new cases of cancer in Pakistan is 173 937, according to data from the PCR as well as estimates based on computation of incidence to prevalence ratios (Figure ).\n\nThe age‐standardized incidence rate (ASIR) per 100 000 for all cancers in both sexes is 114. Table compares the ASIR per 100 000 based on worldwide, South Asian, and Pakistani populations.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nNo.SiteAge‐standardized (World) incidence rate (per 100 000)Age‐standardized (South Asia) incidence rate (per 100 000)Age‐standardized (Pakistan) incidence rate (per 100 000)1Breast34.744.4135.82Lip/oral cavity68.720.53Esophagus7.34.39.14Leukemia8.84.76.75Lung30.95.35.8\n\nThe PCR report of 2017 reported 6456 cases over the year in Lahore, the capital of Punjab, out of which 57% were female. 5 Estimates put the total cancer incidence in Punjab at around 100 000: a value that remains to be verified by a national cancer registry, the need for which has been stressed time and again. 7\n\n3.1. Mortality\n\nAccording to Globocan, total number of cancer deaths were estimated at 118 442, with a slightly higher mortality in males. The age‐standardized mortality ratio (World) was 79.8 for both sexes, while the risk of dying from cancer before 75 years age was 14.3%. Breast cancer was the highest overall contributor to mortality, followed by lip/oral cavity and lung cancers. 2\n\n3.2. Prevalence\n\nPrevalence data from Globocan 2018 shows that the number of 5 year prevalent cases of cancer in Pakistan is 310 132, which is higher in females. 2 Most of the patients present with advanced stage malignancies, as evidenced by studies conducted for breast and esophageal cancer, among others.8, 9 This leads to poor prognostic outcomes and financial burdens, as such patients need advanced diagnostic, curative and palliative facilities. Stage III and IV malignancies require multimodal treatment with higher costs. 10 Studies from developed countries have also shown that patients with cancer are at a higher risk of bankruptcy. 11 Therefore high disease prevalence in the community leads to higher socioeconomic burden. 11\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\n4.1. Current facilities for diagnosis and management of cancer\n\nPakistan faces a dearth of adequate facilities for both diagnosis and treatment of cancer, let alone palliative and hospice care. Nationwide surveys in 2005 and 2010 showed that while there was an increase in resources over time; such as the number of megavoltage teletherapy machines (increased from 37 to 41), the number of conventional and CT simulators for cancer localization and radiotherapy personnel; the number was still inadequate to cope with the ever‐increasing burden of cancer. 12\n\nWhile the role of surgical oncology is well established, only one institute in Pakistan is accredited for surgical oncology fellowship by the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan (CPSP). Similarly, facilities for medical, gynecologic, and pediatric oncology are starkly disproportional to the increasing cancer burden in the country. 13 This is further highlighted in Tables 3 and 4.\n\nIn Punjab, the facilities for diagnosis and management of cancer can be considered at four levels: the government/public sector, which provides free of cost services to patients from both within and outside the province; semiprivate facilities, which incorporate public‐private partnerships (PPP) model; trust hospitals, where patients are treated on the basis of financial support percentages; and private sector hospitals, where patients bear the full costs of their treatment. Differences between cancer care in public vs private sector are outlined in Table .\n\nTABLE 2\n\nPublic sector cancer carePrivate sector cancer careLocationLarge tertiary care hospitalsSole cancer care facilityScope of servicesBroadLimited to oncological servicesMaintenance of facilitiesChallengingEasier to accomplishQualityLimited by local expertiseEnhanced by international expertsAdministrative modelLarge, bureaucraticSmall, manageable\n\nHere, we review these four sectors separately in detail. The details of currently available cancer facilities across the sectors can be appraised from Table :\n\nTABLE 3\n\nGovernment/publicSemiprivateTrustPrivateTotalTotal number of hospitals851317Total number of cancer specialists14313623104Number of medical oncologists6281430Number of radiation oncologists8296952Number of surgical oncologists0022022Number of training institutions32138Number of postgraduate residents29834879Outpatient facilitiesYesYesYesYes‐Number of inpatient beds234116195N/A* 545\n\n4.1.1. The government sector\n\nThe statistics in the government sector are worrisome in the context of high patient burden. On average, one medical oncologist deals with almost 17 000 patients, while one radiation oncologist deals with 12 500 patients. 2 Estimates from the United States, based on a total number of 17 705 oncologists for a population of 325.7 million people, show that the ratio of medical oncologists to population is around 5.43 per 100 000, 15 compared to a ratio of 0.027 per 100 000 in Punjab (Table ). Survey data on patient load in the United States shows that one medical oncologist would see around 350 patients annually, 16 whereas in Punjab an oncologist on average sees 1300 to 1500 patients annually. Similar estimates for radiation oncology in United States put the number of patients per radiation oncologist at around 250, with the oncologist to population ratio being 1.28 to 1.40 per 100 000 population.17, 18 This highlights the urgent need for more oncological specialists in Punjab. Table shows the current deficits that need to be fulfilled in order to meet the mark.\n\nTABLE 4\n\nParameterDeficitNumber of radiation oncologists (per 100 000 population)−1488Number of medical oncologists (per 100 000 population)−5943Number of teletherapy units−210Number of radiotherapy technologists−708Access to radiotherapy facilities78.6%\n\n4.1.2. Semiprivate facilities\n\nFacilities such as mammography and bone scan are available across this sector, whereas no hospital in the public sector provides these imaging facilities. All the services are provided at cost, which is subsidized by governmental funds. Details of various facilities have been outlined in Table .\n\n4.1.3. Trust hospitals\n\nThe working model of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (SKMCH&RC), the largest trust based hospital specializing in cancer care in Pakistan, is as follows: patients undergo check‐ups in walk‐in clinics for free, following which investigations are performed, and selected patients are admitted in the hospital. Financial aid after background checks is provided to selected patients on a financial support percentage basis.\n\nSKMCH&RC is the only institute accredited by the CPSP for fellowship in surgical oncology. Hospital statistics regarding cancer care facilities and oncological training are outlined in Table . While the hospital provides several valuable services unavailable at other hospitals, its model cannot effectively cater to the large population of Punjab. Since financial support is limited, often patients with advanced malignancies in need of multidisciplinary care are referred to government hospitals, where both resources and facilities are scarce.\n\n4.1.4. Private sector\n\nThis sector includes both private hospitals and consultants who practice exclusively in the private sector. Consultants who provide services in both government and private hospitals are only considered in the government sector. Details of cancer care and training facilities in the private sector can be assessed from Table .\n\n4.2. Problems in delivery of optimal cancer care\n\nOptimal cancer care entails the following aspects: cancer awareness; screening of at‐risk population; early identification and diagnosis of cancer; availability of imaging and laboratory investigations; medical, radiological, and surgical management of cancer; palliative and hospice care; and end of life care. It includes defining cancer care pathways for early referral and treatment.\n\nIn Pakistan, several problems exist regarding the provision of optimal cancer care. We outline some of these here (Figure ).\n\n4.2.1. Lack of awareness\n\nBoth HCPs 19 as well as the population 20 are unaware of screening tests and preventive methods. Limited knowledge regarding breast cancer was reported in a female population cohort. 21 The situation is especially dire in rural areas, where lady health workers' (LHWs) training can help remediate the problem. 22\n\n4.2.2. Infrastructure and personnel\n\nThe current infrastructure in Punjab is inadequate to serve the growing needs of the population afflicted with cancer. Here, we review the problems in infrastructure and personnel under three sections: anticancer drug access, radiotherapy facilities, and cancer pain management.\n\nAnticancer drug access\n\nA recently conducted cross‐sectional survey across Punjab showed that most doctors prescribe nonbiological anticancer drugs to patients due to high cost and low availability of biological agents. 58.1% of the reported nonbiological agents were affordable for the patients against only 3.3% biologics. 23 While lowest price generics (LPGs) were more cost‐effective for all income groups, they were less readily available compared to originator brands (OBs), affordable only by high‐income groups. Medications are also available more easily in the private sector. 24 Drug shortages are attributable to multiple causes, including raw material supply, production, demand vs supply, distribution, pricing, and above all ineffective management by regulatory authorities. In Pakistan, the Drug Regulatory Authority (DRAP) has currently approved only one source for the supply of vital anticancer drugs; importation from alternative brands and local manufacturing of drugs can prevent shortages and prove cost‐effective in the long run. 25\n\nRadiotherapy facilities\n\nIn the government and semiprivate sector, only nine Cobalt‐60 external beam radiotherapy machines are available across seven centers. Only one medical linear accelerator (LINAC) is available in the semiprivate center. In LMICs, more than half of newly diagnosed patients require radiation therapy. In Pakistan, only 21.4% of patients have access to radiotherapy services. 26 Guidelines indicate that there should be one teletherapy unit per 450 patients, one radiation oncologist per 250 to 300 patients, and one radiotherapy technologist per 100 to 150 patients. 26 The deficit of these facilities in Pakistan is highlighted in Table . Local manufacturing of radiotherapy machines can improve cost effectiveness in the public sector. 27\n\nCancer pain management facilities\n\nMore than half of cancer patients suffer from pain at some point during their disease. Multiple modalities can be used for management of cancer pain. Although opioid analgesics are the mainstay of pain management, they are seldom available in LMICs, due to concerns regarding abuse and addiction, and slow regulatory authority processing. Opiophobia is one of the most significant deterrents to effective cancer pain management in LMICs. 28 Although opioids are available in Pakistan, they are not readily available to the patient. All patient categories require registration before opioids can be dispensed, with restrictions on various prescription forms. 29 Only certain opioids have been registered by the DRAP, including oral and parenteral morphine sulfate, parenteral pethidine, and fentanyl patches among a few others, which can only be imported by certain companies, and not directly by institutions. 12 In Punjab, these medications are not available in the government and semiprivate sector. Injectable morphine is available only in some tertiary hospitals, while for home treatment with oral morphine no guidelines on limitation of length of prescription or dose limits exist. 30\n\n4.2.3. Lack of palliative care\n\nPalliative care is a hitherto unknown modality in Pakistan, and has not been recognized as a component of most healthcare systems. Lack of supportive policies, lack of HCP training and lack of palliative medications and procedures are all contributory factors to this dilemma. 31 Less than five dedicated centers for hospice care are present, none of which are governmentally approved or adequately staffed. 13\n\n4.3. Recommendations for improvement\n\nThe following recommendations are presented for improvement in cancer care in Punjab.\n\n4.3.1. Education and training\n\nUndergraduate training or courses in oncology are nonexistent in Punjab, with a generally low level of awareness among both undergraduate students as well as fresh interns.13, 15 Postgraduate residents also lack communication skills, including breaking bad news to patients and their relatives. 32 Additionally, given the increasing burden of cancer in the province, the currently accredited programs for fellowship training are deemed insufficient.\n\nIt is, therefore, recommended that training programs should be set up at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Structured workshops on breaking bad news, dealing with terminally ill patients, and palliative care can improve both physician output and patient care. 32 Research programs should be established for oncology, with funding from government and nongovernmental stake holders. Specialists currently residing in the province should be encouraged to enhance their skills by attending and arranging specialized courses.\n\n4.3.2. Infrastructure development\n\nAs stressed above, infrastructure development is crucial to build and sustain effective cancer care institutes. More specialized cancer centers and teletherapy units need to be built. The DRAP should make importing from multiple sources as well as local manufacturing possible, so that LPGs can be widely available. Allowing institutions to directly import opioid medications, as well as building centers in large cities for dispersal of these medications to registered patients should also be done. The existing tertiary care hospitals should be upgraded with state‐of‐the‐art oncology wards. Bone marrow transplant centers with specialist training should be established on a provincial scale.\n\nNovel models integrating a system of referral from public to private/trust sector hospitals, and vice versa, should be established for a more equal patient distribution and to meet specialized patient needs. Studies from South Africa have shown that such public‐private collaborative measures hold much benefit. 33\n\n4.3.3. Cancer registries\n\nCancer registries are of utmost importance to keep track of patient data, and to devise policies regarding infrastructure development and training of HCPs. The PCR is currently being run by a trust hospital in the city of Lahore only. Expanding the horizon of this registry to include other cities, as well as setting up of governmentally funded registries can greatly help policy makers in devising budgetary allocations.\n\n4.3.4. Cancer screening and prevention\n\nThere is a proven role of cancer screening programs for various cancers. A study conducted in rural areas of Punjab has shown that if LHWs are trained regarding awareness of breast cancer, the effectiveness of screening can be increased. 22 A provincial cervical smear program can be highly effective in early detection of cervical cancer. 13 Novel strategies in this regard can include annual screening of women for cancer alongside mandatory vaccination activities by trained LHWs/LHVs accompanying vaccinators.\n\n4.3.5. Research in oncology\n\nResearch in oncology and cancer therapeutics should be encouraged by prioritized funding, availability of grants, international collaborations, and establishment of equipped research centers. Currently, research studies have been unable to provide local guidelines for cancer management due to time and cost restraints. 13\n\n4.3.6. Health education\n\nBasic health education can be of great help in prevention of various cancers. Health and sexual education through workshops, posters, public campaigns, and political mobilization can help prevent many cancers. Public awareness campaigns have long been considered one the most effective measures for primary prevention of cancer. 34\n\n5. CONCLUSION\n\nThe incident burden of cancer in Pakistan is expected to almost double by 2040. 35 Considering the current situation regarding availability of resources and infrastructure, Pakistan will need to make many changes in its healthcare system. Punjab has the most developed healthcare infrastructure in the country, and therefore caters to patients from other provinces as well. The future will only increase the incident disease burden for Punjab: therefore, changes in healthcare policy should be implemented now. An increasing disease burden will increase costs of health delivery systems, reducing overall productivity. Implementation of the recommendations listed above can lead a long way in ensuring that services for cancer patients improve, and that these severely afflicted patients can return to a healthy and productive living.\n\nETHICAL STATEMENT\n\nNot applicable.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nNone.\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\n\nData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
