I am truly honored to be part of the research community at NMBU and to work on a project that holds immense potential for the future of architecture and human well-being. My research will revolve around \"Daylight Quality Behind the Aperture\", and I will be diving into the fascinating world of circadian rhythms, daylight's impact on our health, and the spectral composition of daylight in the built environment. Here are some key aspects of the project: 🌞 Circadian Rhythms: I will explore how the circadian rhythm, which regulates melatonin and serotonin production, is influenced by daylight. 🌈 Spectral Composition: I will investigate how the spectral composition of daylight affects our well-being, particularly the melanopic sensitivity, which differs from our visual sensitivity. 🏢 Daylight in Buildings: My research will consider how architectural elements like windows, glass panes, and internal surfaces influence the quality of daylight inside buildings. 🔍 Research Questions: I'll seek answers to questions like how the spectral transmittance of glass impacts our health, the spatial variance of daylight within a room, and whether building design should respond to these findings. 📅 Project Timeline: My research journey will span several years, involving literature reviews, measurements, methodology development, and dissemination of results, with key milestones marked for publications. 👨🏫 Supervisors: I am fortunate to have guidance from experienced mentors, including Arnkell J. Petersen, Thomas Thiis, and Ingunn Burud, who bring expertise in building physics, indoor climate, and related fields. 📚 Ongoing Learning: My journey will also involve taking relevant courses to expand my knowledge and skills in the field. Please feel free to contact me if you want to discuss daylight, building design and other research topics or have suggestions on literature. I am incredibly excited about this opportunity to contribute to our understanding of how daylight quality impacts our lives and the potential implications for architectural design. I look forward to sharing my progress and insights with all of you along the way. Thank you to my family, friends, and mentors who have supported me on this journey. #PhDJourney #DaylightResearch #NMBU #BuildingDesign #CircadianRhythms #SpectralComposition #newjob\n\nHello Everyone, Earning a degree from a prestigious institution doesn't automatically ensure the competence of a faculty member or researcher. The true growth of a nation hinges on innovative research and the development of products and solutions that contribute to boosting our GDP. This fact becomes clear when examining the team working on the MOON mission project. https://lnkd.in/dTftvMDs After Ganesh Natarajan (Indian Institute of Technology, Palakkad / Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati?) submitted his stupid comments to American Institute of Physics against a closed form analytical model, there were instances of his active engagement on LinkedIn, ResearchGate, other social media and involvement in academic politics for his survival! However, it's worth noting that all the reviewers ultimately rejected Ganesh Natarajan and his co-authors (IITians) comments. Consequently, their manuscript will not be published by American Institute of Physics, rendering the reviewers' comments moot for online dissemination. Nevertheless, I am sharing these comments here out of academic interest, with the intention of educating aspiring researchers. This situation highlights the importance of not automatically accepting comments from IIT faculty as the final and definitive word. It underscores the idea that academic credentials or institutional affiliations, even those from high-impact institutions, are not prerequisites to uncover the laws of nature. This serves as a valuable lesson for everyone, including the government funding agencies. I'd like to extend my appreciation to Ganesh Natarajan and their team from various IITs/Indian Institute of Science (IISc) for shedding light on the true essence and knowledge of IIT faculty! These observations further solidify the notion that the reputation of IIT/IISc is primarily upheld by its exceptional students and alumni rather than its faculty members. In line with this discussion, it's worth recalling the sentiments expressed by Dr. jairam ramesh, an erstwhile union minister of Bharat, in the past as seen in NDTV (NDTVIndia) https://lnkd.in/duc-Tu_H Indian Institute of Technology, Madras Indian Institute of Technology, Palakkad Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur Indian Institute of Technology, Bhilai Indian Institute of Science (IISc) ISRO - Indian Space Research Organization National Aerospace Laboratories, Bangalore DRDO, Ministry of Defence, Govt. of India @Joseph Mathew iisc VR SANAL KUMAR Yash Raj DEKKALA VINAY Narendra Modi\n\nOpen Call for Rice University Students: Carbon Hub Annual Meeting | Poster Session & Competition Abstract submission: 26th April!!!

It is a competition whereby students come up with innovative engineering designs and pitch their innovations with the top 3 winners getting cash rewards. Of the top 5 teams that presented, 2 were from UNILAG, 1 from UNIBEN, 1 from Bayero University and 1 from Covenant University. The first UNILAG team presented and it was quite stellar. Then the UNIBEN team presented and I was really unimpressed. Next was the second UNILAG team and I was embarrassed to be a student of UNILAG myself😩. They were immediately followed by the Covenant University team and they did quite well. P.S: I'm not judging their innovations in any way as they all had excellent innovations to present. I'm only just considering their pitch. To be fair, the media team had their share of blame for all the presentations save for the first UNILAG team that presented as there were several hitches and glitches that could easily put most person's off track. But then...🌚 After the four earlier mentioned teams had presented, there came this young man all the way from Bayero University, Kano. He was the only person from his team of 3 that came - I guess logistics cost must have caused this. Kano too far from Lagos gan ooo 😌 This guy came on stage with every iota of confidence you could imagine and from his first statement, he blew our minds away. Imagine starting off with, \"they say water is life, but water killed my sister.\" Despite the media glitches and the fact that at a point, power went out completely for minutes which led to an abrupt pause in his presentation, man still killed the show. We could not find any bit of error. He had sourced for every information you could ever think of and had well-cooked answers to every question thrown at him by the judges. I do not want to go into details here but at the end, it was obvious he was the winner by far. It was indisputable. He bossed the entire show with a wide margin and at the end, he won the first position. It was all cheers for this \"man from Kano.\" Who would believe that one unknown man, who was already disadvantaged due to location, who most person's wouldn't think of considering, let alone beat students from these prestigious universities would come and snatch the gold prize. But yes, man did it...and with a wide margin at that. ...to be continued in the comments section. #TheISAAC"
