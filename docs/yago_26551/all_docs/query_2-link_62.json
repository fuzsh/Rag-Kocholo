        "text": "The following discussion is an archived discussion of the DYK nomination of the article below. Please do not modify this page. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as this nomination's talk page, the article's talk page or Wikipedia talk:Did you know), unless there is consensus to re-open the discussion at this page. No further edits should be made to this page.\n\nThe result was: promoted by PFHLai (talk) 21:04, 5 January 2014 (UTC)\n\nBegum Akhtar Riazuddin\n\n[edit]\n\n... that Mrs. Riazuddin, the first woman to write modern Urdu travelogues, was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005?\n\nReviewed: Persecution of Biharis in Bangladesh\n\nCreated/expanded by Syed Wamiq Ahmed Hashmi (talk). Self nominated at 12:36, 17 December 2013 (UTC).\n\nAll facts mentioned in the hook have to be cited - there is no citation in the article for Mrs. Riazuddin being the first woman to write modern Urdu travelogues. Also, the fact that she was nominated for the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize is slightly misleading. It is mentioned in the cited source, but in fact she was part of a large nomination, 1000 PeaceWomen, for that prize rather than being a nomination in her own right. --Bcp67 (talk) 13:06, 17 December 2013 (UTC)\n\nOk, thank you for the quick review; here, I actually forgot to add the ‘first’ in the article lede. The source I have, clearly says: “Her travelogue, ‘Sat Samundar Par’, is the first travelogue in Urdu written by a woman.” (in Urdu) Regarding the Nobel Prize: Can you suggest an improvement, Bcp67? —ШαмıQ✍ @ 14:07, 17 December 2013 (UTC)\n\nThanks for that. I have just edited the article to add a little more about the Nobel Prize nomination, so how about;\n\nALT1 ... that Mrs. Riazuddin, the first woman to write modern Urdu travelogues, was one of the 1000 PeaceWomen nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005?\n\nor shorter - ALT2 ... that Mrs. Riazuddin was the first woman to write modern Urdu travelogues?\n\nOk... ALT1 can go. I actually wanted to include both these facts so that it may seem more interesting. Being a writer and an activist at the same time was a bit surprising for me, too, at first. So much that when I was surfing for sources, I thought that some of them may be about some other Mrs. Riazuddin. Earlier, I just knew of her as a writer. —ШαмıQ✍ @ 15:05, 17 December 2013 (UTC)\n\nSounds reasonable - if you found it interesting I would think other people would too. --Bcp67 (talk) 15:29, 17 December 2013 (UTC)\n\nOk, then. I will finalise the article by today and will remove the {{under construction}}. —ШαмıQ✍ @ 15:44, 17 December 2013 (UTC)\n\nThe \"under construction\" template has been removed; this article appears ready for a full DYK review. BlueMoonset (talk) 17:13, 29 December 2013 (UTC)\n\nThe article was nominated in time, I see no problem with the prose length, neutrality, copyvio and sources. QPQ is fine, it is good to go with the ALT1 hook. Faizan 13:37, 5 January 2014 (UTC)\n\nStriking unapproved hooks. BlueMoonset (talk) 18:50, 5 January 2014 (UTC)"
