Addressing a conference on ‘Improving Governance: Towards Sustainable Growth, Peace and Equity’, he said, “Every bullet, gun, bomb, rocket and explosives being used in acts of terrorism in Pakistan comes from Afghanistan.” The NWFP Governor was chairing the session ‘Sustainable Governance Strategies to Counter Terrorism’ on the second day of the three-day conference. He said external factors were the main cause for the increasing terrorism across the country. “Religious seminaries and economic problems in the country existed before the advent of terrorism in the country; therefore, these things cannot be attributed as the reason behind the menace. Terrorism has actually been triggered by external factors, primarily anarchy and unrest in Afghanistan,” he said. “The question that needs answering is that who is providing the resources to the insurgents,” Ghani said, adding that around Rs 40 billion had been spent by terrorists in the NWFP and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in the last 10 years.

Of these 10 journalists, four were killed in Punjab, three in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and one each in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Balochistan and Islamabad, according to the annual research on the state of media in Pakistan, released on December 30 by Intermedia, a Pakistani media development organisation that focuses on media research, advocacy and training. The total 163 cases included murders, assaults, abductions, explicit threats, censorship cases and attacks on media properties and establishments. Punjab bore the brunt of these attacks with 54 cases and the NWFP a close behind with 52, while Islamabad was the surprise third biggest victim of attacks on media with 28 cases. Sindh recorded 12 attacks, six attacks each were recorded in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) and FATA, and three in Balochistan. Ten journalists were kidnapped in 2009, four in NWFP, two in Islamabad and one each in Balochistan, FATA, Punjab and Sindh. The report also documented at least 24 cases of assaults on working journalists across the country, in which 70 journalists were injured — 36 in Punjab, 12 in Islamabad, 10 in the NWFP, seven in Sindh and five in PoK. At least 28 journalists received threats in person or over the phone. Of these, nine journalists were in Islamabad, eight in the NWFP, seven in Sindh, and one in FATA. The Intermedia report also documented at least 35 cases of official gag orders, censorship or restrictions on publication or broadcast in 2009. Of these, the highest number of cases, 23, was in the NWFP, four in Punjab, three in Islamabad and one each in Sindh, Balochistan, FATA and PoK. Ten cases of physical and armed attacks were reported on media property and establishments, exemplified by the suicide attack on the Peshawar Press Club on December 22, 2009. Of these attacks, four were in the NWFP, two each in Fata and Punjab and one each in Islamabad and PoK. “At least 45 journalists have been killed in Pakistan in the last five years, several by suspected militants, but this is the first time that suicide squads of terrorists have targeted media persons as a specific, overt target, indicating a dramatic increase in the level of threats facing the media in the country,” Adnan Rehmat, executive director of Intermedia, said.
