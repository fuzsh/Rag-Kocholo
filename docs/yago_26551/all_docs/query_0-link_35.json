The ${\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{\\Lambda}}}_{b}$ polarization is measured to be $0.00\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.06(\\mathrm{stat})\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.06(\\mathrm{syst})$ and the parity-violating asymmetry parameter is determined to be $0.14\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.14(\\mathrm{stat})\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.10(\\mathrm{syst})$. The measurements are compared to various theoretical predictions, including those from perturbative quantum chromodynamics.",
