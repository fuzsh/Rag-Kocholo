        "text": "Pakistani cuisine (Urdu: پاکستانی پکوان, romanized: pākistānī pakwān) can be characterized as a blend of regional cooking styles and flavours from across South, Central and Western Asia. Pakistani cuisine is influenced by Persian, Indian, and Arab cuisine. The cuisine of Pakistan also maintains certain Mughal influences within its recipes and cooking techniques. Pakistan's ethnic and cultural diversity, diverse climates, geographical environments, and availability of different produce lead to diverse regional cuisines.\n\nPakistani cuisine, as in the food culture of most Muslim nations, is structured around halal principles, which, for example, forbid pork and alcohol consumption in accordance with Sharia law, the religious laws of Islam. Many more details of halal regulations apply to meats, which types of animals are acceptable or “clean” for human consumption.

Pakistani cinema is made up of various sub-industries, including Lollywood, which makes motion pictures in Urdu and Punjabi. Lollywood is one of the biggest film industries in the country.\n\nPakistani cinema includes films made in various Pakistani languages, which reflects the linguistic diversity of the country itself. The largest language-based film industries in the country include Punjabi, Urdu, Pashto, Sindhi and Balochi cinema. (Full article...)\n\nAzad Jammu and Kashmir (Urdu: آزاد جموں و کشمیر, lit. 'Independent Jammu and Kashmir'), abbreviated as AJK and colloquially referred to as simply Azad Kashmir ( AH-zad kash-MEER), is a region administered by Pakistan as a nominally self-governing entity and constituting the western portion of the larger Kashmir region, which has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947. Azad Kashmir also shares borders with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the south and west, respectively. On its eastern side, Azad Kashmir is separated from the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir (part of Indian-administered Kashmir) by the Line of Control (LoC), which serves as the de facto border between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir. Geographically, it covers a total area of 13,297 km2 (5,134 sq mi) and has a total population of 4,045,366 as per the 2017 national census.\n\nThe territory has a parliamentary form of government modelled after the British Westminster system, with the city of Muzaffarabad serving as its capital. The President of AJK is the constitutional head of state, while the Prime Minister, supported by a Council of Ministers, is the chief executive. The unicameral Azad Kashmir Legislative Assembly elects both the Prime Minister and President. The territory has its own Supreme Court and a High Court, while the Government of Pakistan's Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan serves as a link between itself and Azad Jammu and Kashmir's government, although the autonomous territory is not represented in the Parliament of Pakistan.

The village of Mangla, which sits at the mouth of the dam, serves as its namesake. In November 1961, the project's selected contractors were revealed; it was announced that Binnie & Partners, a British engineering firm, was going to serve as the lead designers, engineers, and inspectors for the construction of the dam (led by Geoffrey Binnie). The project was undertaken by a consortium known as the Mangla Dam Contractors, which consisted of eight American construction firms sponsored by the Guy F. Atkinson Company based in South San Francisco, California.

Pakistani law prescribes criminal penalties for same-sex sexual acts.\n\nThe Pakistani Penal Code of 1860, originally developed under the British Raj, criminalises sodomy with possible penalties of prison sentences from two years to a life sentence and fines. Despite its illegality, homosexual acts are only occasionally prosecuted by authorities, but it's sometimes used to threaten and harass homosexuals under threat of prosecution. Other morality and public order provisions in the Penal Code are used to target LGBT Pakistanis as well. Another greater problem can be vigilate policing and killings by Islamist and terrorist groups. Police may also act illegally and arrest LGBTQ individuals despite the law stating otherwise.

(More about K.U....)\n\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah was an Indian Muslim politician and statesman who led the All India Muslim League and founded Pakistan, serving as its first Governor-General. While celebrated as a great leader in Pakistan, Jinnah remains a controversial figure, provoking intense criticism for his role in the partition of India. As a student and young lawyer, Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress, expounded Hindu-Muslim unity, shaped the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the Muslim League, and was a key leader in the All India Home Rule League. Differences with Mohandas Gandhi led Jinnah to quit the Congress; he then took charge of the Muslim League and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslim in a self-governing India. Disillusioned by the failure of his efforts and the League's disunity, Jinnah would live in London for many years. Several Muslim leaders persuaded Jinnah to return to India in 1934 and re-organise the League. Disillusioned by the failure to build coalitions with the Congress, Jinnah embraced the goal of creating a separate state for Muslims as in the Lahore Resolution. The failure of the Congress-League coalition to govern the country prompted both parties and the British to agree to partition. (more...)\n\nK2 is the second-highest mountain on Earth. It is located in the Karakoram segment of the Himalayan range, on the border between Gilgit-Baltistan, Northern Pakistan and the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang, China. Other names include Mount Godwin-Austen (Urdu: ماؤنٹ گڈون آسٹن), Lamba Pahar (\"Tall Mountain\" in Urdu), Dapsang, Kechu or Ketu (Urdu: کے ٹو), the latter two of which are both derived from \"K2\". The mountain was first surveyed by a European survey team in 1856. Thomas Montgomerie was the member of the team who designated it \"K2\" for being the second peak of the Karakoram range. The other peaks were originally named K1, K3, K4 and K5, but were eventually renamed Masherbrum, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum II and Gasherbrum I respectively. After various failed attempts, An Italian expedition finally succeeded in ascending to the summit of K2 on July 31, 1954. The expedition was led by Ardito Desio, although the two climbers who actually reached the top were Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni. The team included a Pakistani member, Colonel Muhammad Ata-ullah, who had been a part of the 1953 American expedition. Also on the expedition was the famous Italian climber Walter Bonatti, who proved vital to the expedition's success in that he carried vital oxygen to 26,600 feet for Lacedelli and Compagnoni. His dramatic bivouac in the open at that altitude wrote another chapter in the saga of Himalayan climbing. On August 9, 1977, 23 years after the Italian expedition, Ichiro Yoshizawa led the second successful ascent to the top; with Ashraf Aman as the first native Pakistani climber. The Japanese expedition ascended through the Abruzzi Spur route traced by the Italians, and used more than 1,500 porters to achieve the goal.

Faisalabad is the third largest city in Pakistan with an estimated 2006 population of 2.6 million (city proper). It is an important industrial centre located in the Punjab province, west of Lahore. The city-district of Faisalabad is bound on the north by the districts of Gujranwala and Sheikhupura, on the east by Sahiwal, on the south by Toba Tek Singh and on the west by Jhang. The present day city was founded by the British Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, Sir Charles James Lyall for whom it was originally named Lyallpur. The city of Lyallpur came into being in 1880 with the city centre designed by Captain Poham Young, to imitate the Union Flag with eight roads radiating from a large clock tower in the centre to eight separate bazaars. The city grew into a strong industrial and agricultural centre and on independence of Pakistan it was a major urban area. After independence, the city of Lyallpur marched rapidly on the path of progress. The city which had so far been known for its grain market, became a great commercial and industrial centre. In 1977, the name of the city was changed to Faisalabad, after the name of the late king of Saudi Arabia, Shah Faisal-bin-Abdul Aziz. Faisalabad has a strong industrial base including textiles, jewellery, home furniture, and pharmaceuticals, assisted by the expanding transport network which includes newly built motorways to Lahore and Rawalpindi. Faisalabad is one of the three planned cities of country. The city is also home to numerous colleges and universities such as the Agricultural University and Punjab Medical College.

The area was for the first time declared reserved in 1988. The park area covers parts of the three districts, namely; Lasbela, Gwadar and Owaran of Balochistan province containing a variety of topographical features and vegetation, varying from arid sub tropical forest in the north to arid montane in the west. Large tracts of the NP are covered with drift sand and can be classified as coastal semi desert. The National Park includes the estuary of the Hingol river which supports a significant diversity of bird and fish species. Currently, 20 staff members including 18 game watchers, two deputy rangers are responsible for the management of the Park under the guidance of the park Manager who reports to the Conservator and the Secretary Wildlife, Forest, Livestock, Environment and Tourism. Hingol is known to support at least 35 species of mammals, 65 species of amphibians and reptiles and 185 species of birds. Some 250 plant species were recorded in the initial surveys including 7 yet undescribed species. Many more species are yet to be collected. The park forms an excellent habitat to wild Sindh Ibex, Afghan Urial and Chinkara Gazelle. Ibex is found in all steep mountain ranges and numerous in the Hinglaj and Rodani Kacho Mountain areas. Total population is estimated over 3000. (More...)\n\nThe Sheesh Mahal (Palace of Mirrors) is located within the Shah Burj block in north-western corner of Lahore Fort. It was constructed under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1631-32. The white marble pavilion is inlaid with pietra dura and complex mirror-work of the finest quality. The hall was reserved for personal use by the imperial family and close aides. It is among the 21 monuments that were built by successive Mughal emperors inside Lahore Fort, and forms the jewel in the Fort’s crown. As part of the larger Lahore Fort Complex, it has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981. During the subsequent Sikh and British rules of Punjab, additional constructions were carried out on the top of Sheesh Mahal. The dead load made the structure vulnerable to collapse. In 1904-05, the plaster from the ceiling of main veranda fell apart, exposing the decay of internal wooden beams and the corroding roof. At this stage, the building was listed by the department of archaeology of British India in 1927 and the repair work was carried out. Similar problems arose in 1960s and were resolved through minor repairs. In 1975, Sheesh Mahal was listed as a protected monument under the Antiquities Act by Pakistan's Department of Archaeology whereas in 1981, as part of the larger Lahore Fort Complex, it became inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was not until 2006 that the problems of the ceiling were comprehensively resolved and the structure was restored.

The Ghauri-I has an optimum range of 1,500 km and can carry both a conventional and non-conventional payload. It is powered by a liquid propellant engine. Pakistan successfully carried out the test of the surface-to-surface Ghauri-I Missile with a range of 1500 km and a payload of 700 kg on April 6, 1998. This test represented a step forward in Pakistan's indigenous missile and satellite launch programme. Ghauri-II is a longer ranged variant of the Ghauri-I missile. It was developed by increasing the length of the motor assembly and using improved propellants. The Ghauri-II missile has a range of 2,300 kilometres (1,400 mi). Ghauri-III with a range of 3500–4000 km is under development. Ghauri-I was test launched on April 6, 1998 from Malute, near the city of Jhelum, about 76 miles south of the Capital Islamabad. It climbed to a height of 350 km before hitting its designated target in the desert of Balochistan. The reports state that the missile was flight tested to a distance of 1,100 kilometres (680 mi). The test flight was carried out completely overland. No advance notice of the actual flight test was given by Pakistani authorities. Pakistani sources also report that the flight test lasted 9 minutes and 58 seconds. Ghauri-I missile weighes 16 tons and consists of 13 tons of fuel, 700 kg warhead and the remaining weight is of the casing and equipment. The missile can carry a nuclear, chemical, or anti-tank warhead. The Ghauri missile was test fired from a mobile launcher.

It covers an area of 256 ha with a population of 200,000. The city walls were destroyed shortly after the British annexed the Punjab in 1849 and were replaced with gardens, some of which exist today. The Circular Road links the old city to the urban network. Access to the Walled City is still gained through the 13 ancient gates, or their emplacements. The convoluted and picturesque streets of the inner city remain almost intact but the rapid demolition and frequently illegal rebuilding, which is taking place throughout the city, is causing the historic fabric to be eroded and replaced by inferior constructions. Walled City of Lahore had 13 gates which included ; Akbari Gate, Bhati Gate, Delhi Gate, Kashmiri Gate, Lohari Gate, Masti Gate, Mochi Gate, Mori Gate, Roshnai Gate, Shahalmi Gate, Shairanwala Gate, Taxali Gate, and Yakki Gate. All of these gates survived till 19th Century when the British, to derfortify the city, demolished almost all of the gates except Roshnai Gate. After that some were rebuilt except for Delhi Gate and Lohari Gate in simple structures. Shahalmi Gate was burnt to ground during the riots of 1947 while Akbari Gate was also demolished for repairs but was never built again . Today out of 13 only 6 gates survives which are ; Bhati Gate, Delhi Gate, Kashmiri Gate, Lohari Gate, Roshnai Gate and Shairanwala Gate.

Since the 1990’s onward, the National Highway Authority has been developing a network of modern motorways that connects nearly every major city in Pakistan. These improvements have contributed to an acceleration of economic growth. Pakistan Railways has been acquiring new locomotives from China. The ports have also been developing to deal with the growing demand for imports and exports. In urban areas there are several means of transport available, catering to a wide range of budgets, including motorbikes, rickshaws, and buses.
