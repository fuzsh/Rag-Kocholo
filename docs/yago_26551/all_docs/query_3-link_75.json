The motivation of this seesaw model is that there is no new physics beyond the TeV scale. By studying $\\stackrel{\\ensuremath{\\rightarrow}}{\\ensuremath{\\mu}}3e$ in this model, it is shown that the upper bound on the branching ratio requires a Higgs boson mass ${m}_{h}$ of a new scalar doublet with the lepton number $L=\\ensuremath{-}1$ needed in this model to be about 9 TeV. The predicted branching ratio for $\\stackrel{\\ensuremath{\\rightarrow}}{\\ensuremath{\\mu}}e{\\ensuremath{\\nu}}_{l}{\\overline{\\ensuremath{\\nu}}}_{l}$ is too small to explain the LSND.",
