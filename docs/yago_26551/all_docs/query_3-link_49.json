        "text": "-by Muhammad Sanan Khan\n\nIn a country which is taking its nascent steps in the world of science, Dr. Hafeez Horaani is one of the pioneers in this world for our country.\n\nHailing from Karachi, he is a particle physicist, with a specialization in accelerator physics, and a research scientist at the CERN. Nowadays, Mr. Hoorani works at the National Center for Physics, with research focus in elementary particle physics and high energy physics.\n\nDr. Hafeez Horaani is certainly among the league of the top scientists of our country for all his works and accomplishments. His efforts to make Pakistan a part of CERN are highly commendable and they are a big push forward for the country.\n\nWhat is CERN? CERN is the European Organization for Nuclear Research bent on seeking answers related to the origin of humankind such as; what is the universe made of? How did it start? Using some of the world’s most powerful particle accelerators.\n\nDr. Hoorani joined CERN in 1989 and due to his efforts, in 2000, Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (led by nuclear physicist Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad) signed an agreement with CERN. This agreement opened the door for Pakistani physicists to collaborate with CERN’s particle physics project.\n\nOur country needs more men like Dr. Hoorani so that in the race to win the world with science and technology our country can make a mark of its own. More power to you, Mr. Hoorani and to PAKISTAN. Ciao till next time.\n\n-by Ayesha Kaleem\n\nThe concept of human mechanization is always trending among the scientific and non-scientific communities worldwide. The science fiction genre has kept fandoms on their toes for decades producing movies like I-Robot and The Six Million Dollar Man.\n\nThe hybrid of man and robot is a fascinating idea which is in its early steps to materialization. Yes, a bionic robot can indeed become a possibility. Scientists have worked their way into fusing brain cells with a computer microchip! This opens up numerous horizons and is a big scientific breakthrough!\n\nWe can proudly say that the leading scientist behind this achievement is one of our own. Dr. Naveed Syed, working in the University of Calgary’s Hotchkiss Brain Institute has created the neurochip. He has made a way possible for us to know the communication between a tissue and an electronic device. The professor explained the phenomena as;\n\n“It used to be like seeing two people talking at a distance. … You didn’t know what they were saying or even what language they were speaking. But now it’s like putting a microphone beside them,”\n\nThis discovery has started a flux of drug testing research for neurodegenerative diseases and disorders. A new set of clinical trials are in progress. The electrical signaling in brain cells can be studied in detail with this technology. The brain cells of a patient suffering from epilepsy have been studied. The brain cell activity can be studied in powerful detail now. All the results and findings can then be stored in a database for further research.\n\nThis contribution to science is indeed a magnanimous one. Dr. Naveed Syed has made a name for Pakistan and contributed not only to the field of scientific research but also a big deal to our medical and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nThe 53 year old Scientist says and I quote;\n\n“A lot of people still think bionics is science fiction. It’s not. It’s already here.”\n\n– By NUST Science Society\n\nEngr. Parvez Butt, nuclear engineer by profession, is a well-known name in Pakistan. He served the Nuclear Program of Pakistan for more than 43 years, where he played a leading role in developing country’s indigenous nuclear-mechanical engineering capabilities. He was also involved in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of Pakistan’s first nuclear power plant, the KANUPP (Karachi Nuclear Power Plant).\n\nEngr. Butt was born on October 4, 1942, in Gujranwala, Punjab, British-India. At age 16, he was admitted to University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, with a full scholarship. In 1962, he graduated and received his BS in Mechanical Engineering. After his graduation, Engr. Butt was employed in Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), where he did his post-graduate research. He was awarded PAEC scholarship in 1964 to study at University of Toronto, where he received his MS in Nuclear Engineering in 1966.\n\nHe rendered his services to KANUPP for 19 years. In 1984, Engr. Butt was appointed as Director of PAEC, and in 1994, he was appointed as Director General and Member (Power) of the PAEC. As member (power) of PAEC, he was responsible for all activities related to Nuclear Fuel and Power. He also served as the Chairman PAEC for five years, starting in 2001. During his tenure as the Chairman, PAEC prospered in various areas of activities and expanded with creation of numerous new organizations. He was elected as the Vice Chairman of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) BOG in 2005. After his retirement from the PAEC in 2006, he was appointed as the Federal Secretary, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of Pakistan.\n\nEngr. Butt has been decorated with prestigious national awards which include the Sitara-e-Imtiaz and the Hilal-e-Imtiaz in 1993 and 1999 respectively.\n\nHe possesses a personality filled with a fortune of qualified expertise and an unconditional dedication to advancement of atomic energy in Pakistan.\n\n– By NUST Science Society\n\nDr. Noor Muhammad Butt, best known as Dr. N. M. Butt, was first of the few Pakistanis who have achieved a Doctor of Science degree in Physics.\n\nDr. N. M. Butt was born on the 3rd of June in Sialkot. After completing his early education from Murray College in 1950, he attended Punjab University, from where he received his B.Sc. in Applied Physics 5 years later. Subsequently, Dr. Butt completed his M.Sc. with specialization in Nuclear Physics from Government College University. After serving as a lecturer at the same institution for a year, he was graced with scholarships to pursue his doctoral studies abroad. Consequently, he completed his PhD at University of Birmingham, UK. Dr. Butt continued his work in the field of Nuclear Physics and finally became the first Pakistani to receive a D.Sc. degree, under the supervision Dr. Philip Burton Moon, in 1967.\n\nAfter completing his education, Dr. Butt began simultaneously teaching and researching at the University of Birmingham. During his years abroad, Dr. Butt discovered the existence of India’s Nuclear Weapons’ Program, which he subsequently reported to Dr. Munir Ahmad Khan, the then Chairman of PAEC. He joined PINSTECH as the director general of Nuclear Physics Division. He is the first Scientist Emeritus at PAEC for his services to the Commission.\n\nDr. Butt’s work earned him the honor of receiving the ICTP award twice in 1970 and in 1979 and the Sitara-e-Imtiaz in 1992. He was the winner of 8th Khwarizmi International Awards, Iran, in 1995. Apart from serving as the head of Pakistan Science Foundation from 2005 to 2008, and as the Chairman of National Commission on Nano-Science and Technology (NCNST) from 2003 to 2008, Dr. Butt is a representative in Pakistan’s Council for meetings of Nobel Laureates. He aspires to build a brighter future for Pakistan by inspiring young scientists through these meetings.\n\n– By NUST Science Society\n\nDr. Riazuddin is undoubtedly one of the most distinguished theoretical physicists of Pakistan. He has made valuable contributions to the field of high-energy physics and has brought heaps of glories to himself and his country. He has been accredited as being a pioneer in Pakistan’s nuclear development for designing theoretical and mathematical design of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. In collaboration with his teacher and mentor Dr. Abdus Salam, he formed “Theoretical Physics Group” at Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.\n\nBorn in Ludhiana, Dr. Riazuddin migrated to Pakistan and settled in Lahore along with his family. He completed his Bachelors of Science in Mathematics with Honors in year 1951 from Punjab University and went on to pursue M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics, specializing in fundamental concepts of Mathematical physics. Upon publishing his thesis in 1953, he instantly made an impact on the world of science. This earned him national reputation and he received a Gold medal from the Punjab University for post-graduate contributions to physics and mathematics.\n\nThroughout his career, he has been awarded great honorary awards. In 2009, he was awarded lifetime achievement award by Higher Education Commission. In year 2000, he bagged two significant awards internationally, The Albert Einstein World Award of Science and UNESCO Science Prize in Physics.
