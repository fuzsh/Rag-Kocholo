Statistically speaking, the staggering death toll (of 5,243) means that the human bombs were able to kill 476 people every year on average and 40 people each month since 2002. Likewise, Pakistan suffered an average 81 suicide bombings every year and seven attacks a month over the past eleven years. Pakistan had experienced only one suicide bombing before 9/11 when the Egyptian Embassy in Islamabad was targeted.

We are continuing with our operations geared towards eliminating terrorism, a senior military officer said. He said that although the offer was yet to be fully dissected it could be a tactical move by the militant outfit given its timing and the conditions that had been set.\n\nAfghan warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in an interview published has denied having any links with the TTP, condemning the TTPs strategy of blowing up schools and blocking girls education. Hekmatyar, a former Prime Minister who leads Afghanistans second largest militant group Hizb-i-Islami, told Britains Daily Telegraph newspaper that he was against the blowing up of schools and educational institutions not only in Afghanistan and Pakistan but elsewhere in the world. I dont think that a devoted Mujahid could be involved in such things, said Hekmatyar, accusing foreign intelligence agencies of being involved in such attacks.\n\nIn what appears to be a paradigm shift in its decades-old policy, Pakistan Army described home-grown militancy as the biggest threat to national security. According to the new Army Doctrine, ongoing activities of Taliban militants in the restive tribal regions and unabated terrorist attacks on Government installations in major cities are posing a real threat to Pakistans security.\n\nA senior military official confirmed to The Express Tribune that a new chapter has been added to the Army Doctrine that would now also include threats posed by sub-conventional warfare.\n\nThe past five years have been difficult for Balochistan according to statistics revealed by the Home Department. Violence in the province has claimed over 2,100 lives and left 3,845 injured in over 3,232 incidents of bomb blasts and rocket attacks in this period. Amidst rising sectarian strife and targeted killings, the governments inability to deal with the situation appears more jarring than ever. Throughout the province, sectarian killings remain the biggest challenge. From 2008 to 2012, 758 members of the Shia community were killed in 478 incidents. Of these, 338 victims belonged to the Hazara community, indicating that Hazaras remain the prime targets of these aggressions.\n\nThe province has become a base for a decade-long insurgency as well as a killing field for various sects. LeJ allegedly keeps targeting Shias throughout Balochistan. Accordingly, officials have beefed up safety measures from Quetta to Taftan and are even planning to hold meetings with Iranian authorities to discuss possible arrangements to facilitate the movement of Hazaras from Marriabad to HazaraTown and Hazar Ganji.\n\nThe findings also uncover staggering kill and dump statistics. Around 570 dead bodies have been found strewn throughout the province, with 370 of the victims belonging to the Baloch community and 89 to the Pashtun community. The rest remain unidentified to this day. Further still, over 402 non-Baloch have been killed in 498 incidents, and over 486 injured in multiple attacks.\n\nNot surprisingly, security personnel have also suffered great losses. As many as 340 Frontier Corps personnel and 380 Policemen have lost their lives in the line of duty, and 508 security officials in total have been left wounded.\n\nAnalysts say that despite the staggering figures, the Provincial Government is yet to review regulations pertaining to the movement of pilgrims under the Travel Agency Act of 1976. In one instance, police decided to refer the investigation of sensitive cases to the Crime Investigation Department after the arrest of alleged terrorist Sher Dil of LeJ, also known as Babu, in a bid to curb violence in Balochistan.\n\nTaliban leader Maulvi Nazir was among 10 Taliban militants killed in a US-operated drone strike in the South Waziristan Agency of FATA. The drone targeted the Taliban leaders moving convoy. Maulvi Nazir was on his way to Wana from Birmal when the convoy was hit in Sarkundi area (in Birmal tehsil), killing him and nine others, officials sources said.\n\nMaulvi Nazir is the second top Taliban leader to be killed in a drone strike after Baitullah Mehsud, who was chief of the TTP when he was killed in 2009. Maulvi Nazir had earned fame in spring 2007 when he led a successful uprising against foreign militants in Ahmedzai Wazir-held areas, ousting Uzbek militants along with their local supporters. He linked administration of polio vaccination to cessation of drone strikes and no polio drive could be launched in Ahmedzai Wazir areas since the ban in June 2012.\n\nSecurity agencies warned the Government of likely backlash from the supporters of Maulvi Nazir. There may be backlash from a Taliban group and the federal government should direct all provincial capitals to increase vigilance against any threat, security officials spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Pentagon (US) welcomed reports that Maluvi Nazir was killed in a drone strike, saying his death would represent a major development. Pentagon spokesman George Little did not confirm the reports of the killing, but said, If the reports are true, then this would be a significant blow, and would be very helpful not just to the United States but also to our Pakistani partners.\n\nNazir was killed along with his five guards when a missile hit his vehicle while he was going to Wana from Birmal on January 2. Maulvi Nazirs key aide Rata Khan was among the other militants killed when the vehicle was attacked near Angoor Adda on the Afghan border, the official said. Nazir had survived a suicide bombing in November 29, 2012.\n\nNazirs group quickly appointed his close aide Bawal Khan as a replacement, according to one of his aides. But a Reuters report named the successor as Salahuddin Ayubi.\n\nIn NWA, six militants, a close associate of the TTPs chief Hakimullah Mehsud among them, were killed in a drone attack in Mir Ali tehsil. According to sources, unmanned aircraft fired two missiles at about 9am on a car carrying Shah Faisal and other militants in Mubarak Shahi, some 20 kilometers east of Miranshah.

The majlis was held in connection with the Chehlum of Hazrat Imam Hussain.\n\nA suspected Pakistani al Qaeda operative, Abid Naseer, accused of planning attacks in the US, Britain and Norway was on January 3 extradited to the US, the Interior Ministry in London announced. Metropolitan Police officers escorted Naseer from Belmarsh Prison to Londons LutonAirport where he was taken into custody by US authorities.\n\nThe 26-year-old is wanted by the US authorities over allegations that he provided material support to al Qaeda and conspired to use explosives. He was named as a suspect in an alleged transatlantic plot directed by Pakistan-based al Qaeda groups.\n\nNaseer was originally arrested in Britain along with 10 other Pakistani men in 2009 over a suspected bomb plot. But they were released without charge after prosecutors said there was not enough evidence, and ordered to be deported. An immigration judge subsequently ruled that despite Naseer being an al Qaeda operative who posed and still poses a serious threat, he could not be returned to Pakistan as his safety could not be guaranteed. In July 2010, Naseer was arrested again on a US arrest warrant. In January 2012, a judge approved Naseers extradition to the US. He appealed to the European Court of Human Rights but his case was thrown out in December.\n\nTwenty militants were killed and 12 others sustained injuries in air strikes carried out by Army warplanes in the Kukikhel area of Tirah Valley in Khyber Agency of FATA. The sources said that fighter jet bombed the sanctuaries of the TTP in Dwatoy and Bragat areas, killing 20 militants and causing injuries to 12 others. The official sources said that commander Abdul Wali alias Umar Khalid, designated head of TTP for Tirah valley, was also present in Dwatoy at the time of the attack. Some reports suggested that he was among the dead. However, it couldnt be verified from independent sources or the TTP due to lack of communication facilities in the Tirah Valley.\n\nThe Kukikhel part of the Tirah valley fell to the TTP a few months back after the militant group defeated the Kukikhel Afridi tribal lashkar. The sources said that the Commander Tariq Afridi-led faction of TTP having bases in the valley had claimed responsibility for the assassination of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Senior Minister Bashir Bilour in Peshawar and also for the killing of 22 kidnapped members of the Levies force in Frontier Region Peshawar. Sources said that TTP cadres had celebrated the death of Bashir Bilour by resorting to festive firing for two hours in Dwatoy and surrounding areas. The fresh airstrikes conducted by the SFs might be a reaction to the assassination of Bashir Bilour and the deaths of 22 Levies personnel.\n\nSeven more bullet-riddled bodies were recovered near Sarobi village area on Miranshah-Razmak road in NWA in FATA.
