        "text": "Research and innovation increase the intellectual quotient of the organization. Food for good thought is always a sign of harmony. The enhancement of the research activities through research projects of students has twofold benefits in terms of tangible outcomes and accreditation points. Funding applications to various funding organizations shall provide the resources required for the research. Taking up industrial problems can help staff and students to realize real-life problems and learning problem-solving methodologies. Various activities by innovation and research-related committees are aimed at improving paper writing skills, awareness of intellectual property rights, and solving real-life problems through technological innovation. The current document sheds light on the measures taken at Gharda Institute of Technology, Maharashtra in recent past and strategic planning for academic year 2023.\n\n'In case you missed it -' Last Thursday, hosted by SACAPSA, Moderated by myself and a fantastic team of young practitioners, we had the youth discussing tough talks on: - finances - employment - the use of AI in architecture The session had an exceptional turn out and was very fortunate to have worked with an audacious team to make the future happen. I'll be unpacking the event in the coming weeks, but here's the major gaps identified: - we need to relook at salaries urgently and provide workable solutions (our earnings are far below the national average for salaries) - we need to better equip graduates to diversify income streams and become self-reliant (a significant portion of undergrads are facing unemployment) - we need to upskill professionals and promptly adjust our architectural curriculum to critically interrogate and investigate emerging technologies (universities are reluctant to use AI or any other technologies on campus and a critical discussion with all relevant role players need to happen soon) In my view, as expressed at the end of the webinar, we need to hold each other responsible - Voluntary Associations, Practices and Practitioners. To solve these problems, we need collaboration, not competition.

Among the privileged attendees was NYANDARUA NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC, showcasing their commitment to innovation and excellence. As exhibitors at the conference, NYANDARUA NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC embarked on a journey of assessment for their projects and innovations, aiming to demonstrate their prowess in applied sciences, engineering, and technology. The conference provided a platform for institutions like NYANDARUA NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC to not only showcase their achievements but also to collaborate and learn from peers across the continent. The essence of the conference lay in the rigorous assessment of projects and innovations. NYANDARUA NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC presented a diverse range of initiatives, each addressing real-world challenges with ingenuity and practicality. From renewable energy solutions to sustainable agriculture practices, the polytechnic's projects reflected a holistic approach towards addressing Africa's pressing needs. One of the key aspects of NYANDARUA NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC's participation was its focus on practical applications. The institution emphasized projects that have tangible impacts on communities, aligning with PASET's vision of skills development for socio-economic transformation. Each project underwent thorough assessment, scrutinizing its technical feasibility, scalability, and potential for societal impact. The polytechnic's presence at the conference was not merely about showcasing finished products; it was a testament to their ongoing commitment to research and development. Interactive displays and presentations allowed conference attendees to engage directly with NYANDARUA NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC's innovators, fostering dialogue and idea exchange. Moreover, the conference served as a catalyst for NYANDARUA NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC to strengthen partnerships and collaborations. Networking sessions provided opportunities to connect with industry leaders, government officials, and fellow educators. These connections are instrumental in bridging the gap between academia and industry, ensuring that innovations are not confined to the laboratory but are translated into real-world solutions. The recognition garnered by NYANDARUA NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC at the conference underscores the institution's dedication to excellence in applied sciences and technology. It reaffirms their position as a leading hub for innovation, not only within Kenya but across the African continent. Looking ahead, NYANDARUA NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC remains steadfast in its pursuit of excellence and impact.

Titled \"Exploring the Global Frontier: Unveiling the Opportunities, Impacts, and SWOT Analysis of Internationalization in Educational Institutions\" it delves into the crucial topic of internationalization in higher education, particularly in the context of India. In the wake of the New Education Policy 2020 and regulations by the UGC, internationalization has emerged as a focal point for Indian institutions. Yet, there's a notable gap in understanding the diverse opportunities available. My article aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive overview. From INIs, Universities to colleges, the importance of internationalization is undeniable, but resource constraints often pose challenges. Through this article, I highlight not only the opportunities but also the impacts and tried to provide a SWOT analysis to guide further endeavour. Let's unlock the potential of internationalization together!
