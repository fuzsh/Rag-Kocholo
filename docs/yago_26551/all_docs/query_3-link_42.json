        "text": "6 - 9 February, 2017\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe “Workshop on Heavy Quark Physics” is being organized by National Centre for Physics (NCP), Islamabad on February 6-9, 2017.\n\nThis first workshop on Heavy Quark Physics is dedicated to Professor Riazuddin (Late), first Director General, National Centre for Physics, Islamabad. It will mainly focus on heavy quark flavor physics. The field of heavy quark flavor physics is of topical interest due to its discovery potential at the LHCb and B-factories like Belle, Babar, etc.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFlavor Physics and CP violation (A. Ali)\n\nTheory of Hadronic B Decays (Cai-Dian Lu)\n\nLight-Cone Distribution Amplitudes (A. Parkhomenko)\n\nB-meson decays in Precision Era (M. Misiak)\n\nTheory of Multi-quarks Physics (L. Maiani)\n\nHadronic Decays of Heavy Baryons (Fayyazuddin)\n\nSearches for Physics beyond the SM in b decays. And, Exotic Tetraquark and Pentaquark States (S. Stone)\n\nMultibody decays of b Mesons (Ying Li & W. Wang)\n\nUltra-relativistic heavy ion collisions and the quark-gluon plasma (J.P. Blaizot)\n\nThe research interest in heavy quark physics has grown progressively over the last few years in Pakistan and presently we have a sizable research community working at NCP and different universities of Pakistan. The purpose of this workshop is to encourage young Pakistani researchers and to facilitate them in building international collaborations. In this context, we plan to have 3/4 lectures on each of these topics.\n\nDirectors\n\nKey Speakers\n\n* video talk\n\nInternational Advisory Committee\n\nScientific Organizing Committee\n\nTechnical Organizing Committee\n\nParticipation\n\nActive post graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, faculty and research scientists who have also published research work in recognized international journals, will be encouraged to participate (oral or poster presentation). Local hospitality will be provided to the participants. As a rule, travel expenses of the participants should be borne by their home institutes. However, partial travel assistance may be provided to selected local participants residing outside Islamabad.\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplication Form can be accessed here. Application Form should be submitted on or before January 15, 2017. Selection will be made by Technical Committee of workshop. Selected applicants will be required to pay registration fee (employed person: Rs. 2000/- students: Rs. 1500/-).\n\nPoster\n\nTo download the workshop brochure, click here.\n\nSchedule\n\nTo download the workshop schedule, click here.\n\nDownload"
