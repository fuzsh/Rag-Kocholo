The Seibu Train (Musashigaoka) Festa is on again in 2024. But once again, for the fourth year in a row, you have to apply in advance to participate. Also, some events require a further, separate booking. Official 2024 event web page.

Seibu Train Festa

The annual Seibu Train Festa is on Saturday June 1st 2024. It is held in the Musashigaoka Carriage Marshalling yard in Hidaka. Normally a freight and operations railway center, the marshalling yard will be open to the public on the day of the festival only. The festival is very family orientated and will be of particular interest to train lovers of all ages. Apart from having a number of specialty train items on sale on the day, there are a number of events and hands on experiences for all and sundry to try out.

This event was not on in 2020, but started back up in 2021. But ever since then it is a very convoluted and somewhat exclusive event! They cap the number of people in the general public who can attend. They reserve 1000 tickets for citizens of Hanno and Hidaka only. In addition another 500 tickets are reserved for others (railway members etc). It is a free event, but as aforementioned you must have a ticket to enter. Tickets will be distributed from May 13th. You need to have the Seibu Line App in order to apply for a ticket. The application area for individual events will be released on the app on May 25th.
