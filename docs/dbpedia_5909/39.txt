I was curious about the general coverage area of the private railways in the Tokyo area (not including Tokyo Metro). I found this stylized map, which provides the general coverage areas by each railway company.

Wanting to get more precise, I made a map (as is my solution to most things). Note: I did not include JR, as it used to be public (and is massive) and did not include Tokyo Metro 東京メトロ (東京地下鉄), as it is primarily a subway company.

The map includes:

(1) Tokyu Corporation 東京急行電鉄株式会社

aka Tōkyū Dentetsu 東急電鉄

(2) Seibu Railway Company, Ltd. 西武鉄道株式会社

(3) Tobu Railway Co., Ltd. 東武鉄道株式会社

(4) Keisei Electric Railway Co., Ltd. 京成電鉄株式会社 (K’SEI)

(5) Odakyu Electric Railway Co., Ltd. 小田急電鉄株式会社

(6) Keikyu 京急 Keikyu Corporation (Keihin Electric Railway) 京浜急行電鉄株式会社

(7) Keio Corporation 京王電鉄株式会社

(8) Sagami Railway Co Ltd 相模鉄道株式会社, or Sotetsu 相鉄
