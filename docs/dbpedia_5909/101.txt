Nihongo|Seibu Railway Company, Ltd.|西武鉄道株式会社|Seibu Tetsudō Kabushiki-gaisha is a conglomerate based in Tokorozawa, Japan, with principal business areas in railways, tourism and real estate. Seibu Railway's operations are concentrated in northwest Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture; the name "Seibu" is an abbreviation of "west Musashi," referring to the historic name for this area. However it and its holding company hold shares of numerous bus, hotel and tourism operations nationwide.

History

The original Seibu Railway was founded in 1894 and began service on the Kawagoe Railway line between Kokubunji and Kawagoe that December. In the following years, Seibu built and operated a number of other lines based around Shinjuku. In 1943, the company merged into the Musashino Railway company, which had been operating an Ikebukuro - Hanno line since 1915. Musashino Railway renamed itself to Seibu Railway following the merger. The former Seibu network based around Shinjuku and the former Musashino network based around Ikebukuro remain operationally separated today.

On December 21 2005, Seibu Railway shareholders voted to remove control of the railroad from Kokudo Corporation and Yoshiaki Tsutsumi who received prison sentences in October for insider trading. The reorganization, completed in February 2006, created Seibu Holdings, Inc., to act as a holding company for both the railway and Prince Hotels. The largest shareholder is United States-based Cerberus Group with a 29.9% share of the new company.ref|JapanTimes-20051221
