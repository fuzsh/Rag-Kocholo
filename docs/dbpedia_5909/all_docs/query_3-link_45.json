        "text": "Take Laview at Ikebukuro Station\n\nA newly developed train designed by the world-renowned architect Kazuyo Sejima, winner of the prestigious Pritzker Prize. The Laview will be the flagship train of SEIBU RAILWAY for the next 100 years; hence Ms Sejima was asked to create a design that no one has ever seen before. The new train series was named the 001, a reverse of 100, with 00 symbolizing infinity (∞), which means ‘many possibilities'. The grey aluminium exterior was designed to seamlessly blend into the urban and natural landscapes. Large windows were built to create a homey atmosphere, and passengers can witness panoramic sceneries. Meanwhile, the interior is furnished with lounge seats painted in warm yellow to create a comforting ambience akin to your own living room. Facilities include multi-function restrooms, powder room, Wi-Fi, electric outlets on seats, wheelchair space, and a separate lavatory for women, a first on Seibu trains.\n\nSEIBU RAILWAY's Original Animation - Chichibu de Buchichi\n\nChichibu is one of Saitama's top tourist attractions. Seibu Railway, one of the train lines connecting Tokyo to Chichibu, produced an original anime set in Chichibu called Chichibu de Buchichi. The script was written by Taku Kishimoto, who is also the scriptwriter for the popular sports anime Haikyu!, and produced by TMS Entertainment (Dr Stone and Yowamushi Pedal). The anime features Chichibu's stunning locations. It is an excellent reference to sneak a peek at Chichibu's charming attractions while enjoying the storyline at the same time.\n\nRent a bicycle at Seibu-Chichibu Station\n\nThe most convenient way to explore Chichibu is to rent a bicycle at the Chichibu Tourist Information Centre. A regular bicycle will only cost 300 yen for an hour. Renting it for longer periods is a lot cheaper too - 500 yen for 3 hours or 1,000 yen for eight hours. The minimum age requirement to rent is 13 years old, and a valid ID is required. Daily opening hours are from 9:00 to 17:00, excluding second and fourth Mondays.\n\nExplore real-life anime locations\n\nChichibu is also the set location for Ano Hana's anime (The Flower We Saw That Day), which was also turned into a movie. We recommend renting a bicycle for three hours. Using a tour map from the tourist centre, you can easily explore the beautiful sights in the area. Several spots were featured in the Ano Hana anime, such as the Seibu-Chichibu Station itself, the old Chichibu bridge, the temple, and Hitsujiyama Park.\n\nOld Chichibu Bridge\n\nThe Old Chichibu Bridge was used as the background for the key visual poster of Ano Hana and two other anime titles of the same production team. It is a historical icon of Chichibu and was designated as a tangible cultural property of Saitama Prefecture. The bridge provides a spectacular view of the Arakawa River and the mountains.\n\nJorinji Temple\n\nThe temple is where the Ano Hana characters played hide-and-seek as kids and the place where they expressed their feelings about Menma (Main character) with each other. Both fans and regular visitors flock to the votive tablets area, where you'll find unique illustrations of wishes and prayers.\n\nHitsujiyama Park\n\nThe Hitsujiyama Park is a treat because it provides two different sceneries - the north overlooks the city while the south has the Shibazakura (moss pink) Hill.\n\nHot Springs at Matsuri No Yu\n\nAfter a day of strolling around Chichibu, you'll definitely need a refresher, and the onsen is the perfect way to rejuvenate your tired body. Matsuri no Yu (Hot Spring) provides various bathing facilities such as an outdoor bath, soda bath, bedrock bath, silky water bath, and sauna. There is also a lounge area with comfortable reclining chairs equipped with its own TV. If you would like to buy some souvenirs, there is a souvenir shop highlighting Chichibu delicacies and unique trinkets. Sit back and enjoy the relaxing ambience before you catch the train home."
