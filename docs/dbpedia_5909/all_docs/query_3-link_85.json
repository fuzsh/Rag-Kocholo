        "text": "TOKYO -- Seibu Railway Co. services in the greater Tokyo area have been partially suspended after a foreign object broke a train's pantograph on the morning of July 8.\n\nA driver found what looks like a net tangled in a pantograph of a 10-car semi express train at Hoya Station in the suburban Tokyo city of Nishitokyo at around 7:50 a.m. The train had departed Kotesashi Station in the Saitama Prefecture city of Tokorozawa and was bound for Shin-kiba Station in Tokyo's Koto Ward.\n\nThe trouble has caused the railway company to suspend both inbound and outbound train services between Ikebukuro and Hanno stations on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line, between Nerima and Kotake-mukaihara stations on the Seibu Yurakucho Line, and between Nerima and Toshimaen stations on the Seibu Toshima Line.\n\nThe services are expected to resume after 3 p.m., and the train operator is providing free alternative transportation during the disruptions.\n\n(Japanese original by Shohei Kato, Tokyo Bureau)"
