        "text": "Nihongo|Seibu Railway Company, Ltd.|西武鉄道株式会社|Seibu Tetsudō Kabushiki-gaisha is a conglomerate based in Tokorozawa, Japan, with principal business areas in railways, tourism and real estate. Seibu Railway's operations are concentrated in northwest Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture; the name \"Seibu\" is an abbreviation of \"west Musashi,\" referring to the historic name for this area. However it and its holding company hold shares of numerous bus, hotel and tourism operations nationwide.\n\nHistory\n\nThe original Seibu Railway was founded in 1894 and began service on the Kawagoe Railway line between Kokubunji and Kawagoe that December. In the following years, Seibu built and operated a number of other lines based around Shinjuku. In 1943, the company merged into the Musashino Railway company, which had been operating an Ikebukuro - Hanno line since 1915. Musashino Railway renamed itself to Seibu Railway following the merger. The former Seibu network based around Shinjuku and the former Musashino network based around Ikebukuro remain operationally separated today.\n\nOn December 21 2005, Seibu Railway shareholders voted to remove control of the railroad from Kokudo Corporation and Yoshiaki Tsutsumi who received prison sentences in October for insider trading. The reorganization, completed in February 2006, created Seibu Holdings, Inc., to act as a holding company for both the railway and Prince Hotels. The largest shareholder is United States-based Cerberus Group with a 29.9% share of the new company.ref|JapanTimes-20051221\n\nRailway operations\n\nSeibu's routes total 179.8 km. They fall into two separate groups. Tokorozawa Station is the crossing point of Ikebukuro Line and Shinjuku Line.\n\nSeibu Railway is well known for its bright yellow colored trains. However, more recent trains have a blue colored line on unpainted stainless steel or aluminium bodies.\n\nIkebukuro Line Group\n\nThe Ikebukuro Line group includes the Ikebukuro Line and its branches.\n\n* Ikebukuro Line (池袋線): Ikebukuro Station&mdash;Tokorozawa Station&mdash;Hannō Station&mdash;Agano Station (57.8 km)\n\n**offers direct \"through-service\" to Shin-Kiba Station on the Tokyo Metro Yūrakuchō Line and Shibuya Station on the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line via the Seibu Yūrakuchō Line\n\n* Seibu Chichibu Line (西武秩父線): Agano Station&mdash;Seibu Chichibu Station (19.0 km)\n\n* Seibu Yūrakuchō Line (西武有楽町線): Nerima Station&mdash;Kotake Mukaihara Station (2.6 km)\n\n**connects the Ikebukuro Line and the Tokyo Metro system\n\n* Toshima Line (豊島線): Nerima Station&mdash;Toshimaen Station (1.0 km)\n\n* Sayama Line (狭山線): Nishi Tokorozawa Station&mdash;Seibu Kyūjō-Mae Station (4.2 km)\n\nShinjuku Line Group\n\nThe Shinjuku Line group includes the Shinjuku Line and its branches, as well as the Tamagawa Line, which is not a branch of the Shinjuku Line but had been owned by the Shinjuku Line's operator before its merger with the Ikebukuro Line operator.\n\n* Shinjuku Line (新宿線): Seibu Shinjuku Station&ndash;Tokorozawa Station&ndash;Hon-Kawagoe Station (47.5 km)\n\n* Seibu-en Line (西武園線): Higashi Murayama Station&mdash;Seibu-en Station (2.4 km)\n\n* Haijima Line (拝島線): Kodaira Station&mdash;Haijima Station (14.3 km)\n\n* Tamako Line (多摩湖線): Kokubunji Station&mdash;Hagiyama Station&mdash;Seibu Yuenchi Station (9.2 km)\n\n* Kokubunji Line (国分寺線): Higashi Murayama Station&mdash;Ogawa Station&mdash;Kokubunji Station (7.8 km)\n\n* Ahina Line (安比奈線): Minami Otsuka Station&mdash;Ahina Station (3.2 km: Freight line, not presently operating)\n\n* Tamagawa Line (多摩川線): Musashi-Sakai Station&mdash;Koremasa Station (8.0 km)\n\nPeople mover\n\n* Yamaguchi Line (山口線): Seibu Yuenchi Station&mdash;Seibu Kyujo-Mae Station (2.8 km)\n\nFares\n\nSingle fare (Adult)\n\nkmFare (JPY)1-41405-81709-1220013-1623017-2026021-2429025-2833029-3236033-3639037-4042041-4445045-4848049-5251053-5654057-6058061-6461065-6865069-7268073-7672077-81750\n\nAffiliated companies\n\n* Prince Hotels\n\n* Seibu Construction\n\n* Saitama Seibu Lions (baseball team)\n\n* Seibu Real Estate\n\n* Seibu Trading\n\nReferences"
