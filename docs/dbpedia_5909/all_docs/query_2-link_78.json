        "text": "Realizing the Design\n\nFront-end Shape\n\nArchitect Sejimaâs image of the 001 series is shown in Figure 4, while Figure 5 shows the verification details of the front end. Wanting to use a large window at the front to give the driver a better field of vision, a series of prototypes were made in cooperation with a glass manufacturer to find feasible sizing and curvature. Thought was given to every aspect, including wipers that could follow the shape of the curved glass, a connecting system to couple it with other trains in case of accidents, the front-end skirts, and designs for opening and closing gangway connections. Finally, tripartition glass with a curvature radius of 1,500 millimeters was adopted while other factors were tested. The glass was found to conform to specifications in optical distortion tests for safety glass used in rolling stock, and the actual visibility was also confirmed. The glass was set in a jig at the same angle it would be mounted to verify conditions simulating day and night. In one example, a light was placed three meters in front of the glass to simulate a signal to check for distortions that prevented viewing outside the train. The wipers were tested on a full size piece of glass for their durability and ability to follow the curvature. The range of motion of the wipers was also adjusted with the customer, with verification to confirm the range combined with stress testing. The rounded shape at the front of the driverâs cab placed limits on the space for housing equipment, but an innovative arrangement succeeded in maintaining the design and functionality. After advance confirmation using a simple mockup, a full-size model was built so that the customer and designer could verify the driverâs field of vision, operability, flow of movement, and so on, to spot any problems and incorporate improvements in the design. The structure of the front-end was given a spherical shape using machining. One method to do this is to combine bent sheet metal overall with machined materials in part, but because the roundness extends over the entire structure, it was decided to comprehensively use machining for the whole structure to ensure productivity and quality.\n\nFig. 4âImage of the 001 Series The front end is shaped spherically to give a gentle impression, while the color of the train blends in with urban or natural surroundings, faintly reflecting the surrounding scenery.\n\nFig. 5âVerification Details for the Front End Mockups (a) to (d) were used to examine and verify any issues with the driverâs field of vision, operability, or flow of movement, incorporating improvements into the design. Machining was used for the entire front-end structure shown in (e) to realize the spherical shape.\n\nCoating of the Outer Plating\n\nThe image of the outer plating suggested by architect Sejima allowed the surrounding scenery to be faintly reflected on the surface. Several surface treatment methods were considered with the coating manufacturer to make this possible. The approach eventually taken for the sake of the quality and finish was to use automobile alloy wheels and modified interior coatings to create a metallic tone with a texture that would faintly reflect the scenery. However, the final finish proved to be unstable due to the environment and method of construction, so the coating specification was decided after a process of trial and error on small and large plate samples (see Figure 6). For the final evaluation, the coating was applied to an actual-size prototype rolling stock to confirm the reflection and texture inside and outside, together with durability testing using cleaning brushes and other tests. Finally it was adopted for use after confirming it satisfied the performance for the outer plating coat on rolling stock.\n\nFig. 6âCoating Verification and Specifications Based on architect Sejimaâs image for the finish of the outer plating as shown in (a), construction was verified using samples in (b) and (c). Four different types of gloss were used on actual-size samples as shown in (d), leading to the decision to use Type 3.\n\nPassenger Compartment Windows\n\nLarge windows were placed at regular intervals to form spaces where individual passengers could feel like they were at home. Numerical simulation was used to evaluate structural strength when enlarging the side windows, followed by structural load tests on an actual model to verify that there were no problems with its strength.\n\nThe glass for these windows had an interlayer of plastic with sound insulation and infrared shielding functions, sandwiched between toughened glass, then combined with more toughened glass with a low reflection film over a layer of air. This structure achieved excellent strength, sound insulation, and heat insulation. A gradient dot pattern was used for the intermediate glass layer to create a connection between the window and the car. This dot pattern used paint with a metallic coating on a powdered glass surface to give a baked texture that blends with the metallic outer plating coat to achieve a consistent look. Several types of glass samples were verified to ensure the range and size of the dots and to ensure the vividness of the colors did not have an impact on the visibility for passengers or otherwise seem disturbing. Their size in particular was reduced to the smallest possible with incredibly strict dimensional control. The ultimate finish was decided by verifying how it looked in operation by placing a sample on existing rolling stock (see Figure 7).\n\nFig. 7âOverview of the Passenger Compartment The large windows spaced continuously at regular intervals use glass with an interlayer of sound insulation and infrared shielding properties together with toughened glass with a low reflection coating, achieving excellent strength, sound insulation, and heat insulation. The gradient dots are metal-coated pigment.\n\nInteriors\n\nThe aim for the passenger compartments was to create gentle spaces where passengers could relax as if they were in their own homes. Accordingly, much attention was paid to the seats, lighting, curtains, and other textiles. The seats are round overall with cushioning that shapes itself around the body to create a unique feel, unaffected by neighboring passengers. The yellow fabric adopts a crimped pattern for a gentle texture. One particular point is the way the armrests tilt together with the seat when it reclines. For functionality, a round retractable table is built into the armrest. An electrical socket is placed below this so that passengers can use the table while charging their smartphones. The seats also come with rear tables, cup holders, and pockets to hold belongings. The compartments are lit by indirect lighting from the simple curved ceiling, changing from daylight colors to warm white according to the time of day. The light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have light control functions to provide soft, gentle lighting. The luggage racks are also provided with lights that can be useful for reading or other situations. A full-size mockup of the interior using the actual materials was created so that the customer and architect Sejima could comprehensively verify the impression of the textiles under different lighting conditions, visibility from the compartments, and how they looked from the outside, as well as their usability and comfort, constantly refining and perfecting the design (see Figure 8).\n\nFig. 8âOverview of the Interior Mockup An actual-size mockup of the passenger compartment was created to verify the comfort of the seats and usability of the tables as well as textiles such as the curtains and carpets, and the visibility from the compartment. The indirect lighting on the ceiling is provided by LEDs with light and tone control functions."
