        "text": "With the recent easing of border controls amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan has witnessed a surge in foreign visitors. This has prompted Seibu Railway to enhance its services and cater to the needs of these travelers.\n\nA transparent screen has been installed at the ticket office of Seibu Shinjuku Station, a convenient terminus for the Seibu Shinjuku Line located in Tokyo's Shinjuku Ward.\n\nAn Innovative Communication Tool\n\nThis innovative screen measures 69 centimeters in height and 75 centimeters in width. And it acts as an interpreter, translating the statements made by international passengers.\n\nThe system aims to facilitate effective communication between station staff and tourists. This, Seibu believes, will help enable a seamless travel experience for non-Japanese speakers.\n\nThe screen was unveiled to the media on July 5. Seibu Railway then launched public trials on July 10.\n\nIt provides translation support for 12 different languages, including English, Vietnamese, Portuguese, Korean, Chinese, Thai, and Filipino.\n\nSeibu Railway's forward-thinking initiative takes the company beyond the use of conventional translation tools, such as apps. It smartly enables face-to-face conversation and visual aid through the transparent screen.\n\nHelping Japanese Travelers, Too\n\nForeign tourists are not the only ones assisted by the screen. It can also display Japanese text for local individuals with hearing impairments. This helps when communicating with the station staff, ensuring accessibility for a broader range of passengers.\n\nA three-month trial is underway by the company. Plans call for fully implementing the system in autumn, after evaluation of its accuracy and user-friendliness.\n\nToppan Inc, a renowned Japanese printing company, collaborated with Seibu Railway to bring the groundbreaking simultaneous translation system to life.\n\nAs Japan continues to welcome a growing number of international visitors, Seibu Railway's adoption of the simultaneous translation system reflects the company's ー and the country's ー dedication to providing seamless experiences for tourists.\n\nRELATED:\n\nSeibu Railway’s Ukiyo-e Posters on Train Manners Are A Hit Abroad\n\nSaitama’s Seibuen Amusement Park Wows with Nostalgic Showa-Era Makeover\n\nOn in Saitama: Chichibu’s Floral Beauty and Funky Kimono"
