The largest concentration of attractions is located around the town center, within walking distance of the two main railway stations, Chichibu Station and Seibu-Chichibu Station. Mitsumine Shrine can be reached by bus in a little over an hour. Alternatively, a rental car can provide comfort and flexibility. Multiple outlets can be found in central Chichibu."
