We also have major assets in resorts across the country.\n\nIn order to show how valuable these assets are and to enhance the Groupâs corporate value, we plan and conceive the most effective utilization of our holdings to build the next future of the various areas in the center of the city, resorts, and those along the railway lines.\n\nThe meaning behind\n\nour company name\n\n(Seibu Realty Solutions)\n\nIn it lies the message that we wish to contribute to solving problems related to real estate owned by customers and the Seibu Group as an integrated real estate company of the Group. We plan to maximize the value of the Groupâs holdings and aim to take a leap forward into becoming an even more competitive integrated real estate company.\n\nExamining, determining, and\n\nexecuting optimal solutions through various methods\n\nWe offer services in various fields that are a part of our customersâ daily lives including the developing of sites for hotels in locations such as areas along Seibu Railway lines and the urban center, the developing and operating of commercial facilities such as shops inside and below train stations and resort shopping malls, the leasing of facilities such as offices and houses, the selling of houses, condominiums, and cottage areas in lots, the managing of locations such as parking spaces for automobiles, parking spaces for bicycles, and cemeteries, and the operating of insurance agency businesses. We aim to take a leap forward into becoming an integrated real estate company by accumulating wide-ranging management know-how (AM/PM/BMâ») in the real estate business.\n\nâ» AM: asset management, PM: property management, BM: building management\n\n02\n\nHOW TO VALUE UP\n\nThree area strategies\n\nWe have designated the three areas of âRailwaysâ, âCentral Tokyo Areaâ, and âResortsâ as core areas,\n\nand we prioritize the implementation of measures based on our long-term real estate business strategy for business expansion.\n\nRealization of potential profitability\n\nthrough effective use of real estate assets\n\nin line with area strategy(core areas)\n\nFurther dividing Railway Lines into seven areas,\n\nwe seek to maximize the value of railway lines based on the specific strategy for each area.\n\nAreas along the Seibu Railway\n\nWe are further enhancing value along railway lines by dividing Railway Lines into seven areas and promoting businesses tailored to the respective characteristics of each area in coordination with urban transportation and businesses along railways.\n\nResort Areas\n\nIn addition to Karuizawa Prince Shopping Plaza, we are carrying out projects mainly in the Karuizawa area, where group assets such as hotels and golf courses are concentrated.\n\nCentral Tokyo Areas\n\nWe manage and study large-scale compound development projects centering on the Kioicho area where Tokyo Garden Terrace Kioicho is located, and the Minato Ward, which has a concentration of large hotels such as Grand Prince Hotel Shin Takanawa.\n\nMain land holdings in Tokyo's 23 wards"
