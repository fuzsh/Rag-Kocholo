Thus, the gigantic Ikebukuro Station acts as an important hub that connects 2.62 million passengers on average each day (as of 2015, with 4 railway companies combined) - this makes Ikebukuro Station the third-largest station in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Ikebukuro area itself has a lot to offer in terms of amusement and sightseeing, so knowing the station, its exits, and its lines are crucial for both tourists and Tokyoites.

        "text": "↑Four companies serve Ikebukuro Station: Seibu Railway, JR, Tobu Railway, and Tokyo Metro.\n\n――The Structure of Ikebukuro Station\n\n1) Seibu is on the East Exit side, while Tobu lies on the West Exit side.\n\nAdjacent to Ikebukuro Station are two major department stores: the Seibu Department Store on the station’s east side, and the Tobu Department store on the station’s west side.\n\n2) Marunouchi and Fukutoshin Lines are at Central Passage, the Yurakucho Line is south.\n\nThe ticket gates leading to the three Tokyo Metro lines can be found in the passage that connects the East and the West Exit. The Marunouchi Line’s ticket gates are in the eastern approach of the Central Passage, while the Fukutoshin Line’s gates are in the west. Access to the Yurakucho Line is possible via the ticket gates in the South Passage.\n\n3) Reach both the East and West Exit from any ticket gate!\n\nThere are three passages that connect the East to the West Exit of Ikebukuro Station, so you can either go right or left from the ticket gate you left. Keep in mind, however, that the JR Metropolitan ticket gate leads to the West Exit only, and the Seibu Line’s southern ticket gate is a tad far from both East and West Exit.\n\n4) Passageways offer easy access to and from the station premises\n\nIkebukuro Station has three main connecting passages and those that link the north to the south. The passages that connect the North Passage to the Central Passage from the east side are called Cherry Road and Apple Road, while Azalea Road and Orange Road link the Central Passage to the South Passage from the east side.\n\n――About the Exits\n\n5) Don’t confuse “Seibu East Exit” with JR’s “East Exit”\n\nIkebukuro Station has two exits on its east side: the Seibu East Exit and the East Exit. The Seibu East Exit is on the east side of the Central Passage and you have to go up some stairs to reach it. If you’re coming from the Seibu Line and the Tobu-Tojo Line, it is right in front their respective central ticket gates.\n\nJR’s East Exit, on the other hand, is on the east side of the North Passage, leading up a staircase as well. Access the East Exit from the northern ticket gate of JR and Tobu-Tojo Lines – simply look for the sign that says “JR Ikebukuro east Exit.” A lot of people confuse these two exits, so keep this in mind!\n\n6) There is a South Exit on the east and west side\n\nIkebukuro Station also has two south Exits. Follow the South Passage from the West exit side and go up some stairs to reach the west side’s South Exit. It is close to the Seibu Line’s south ticket gates, and from the outside, it is marked as “Tobu Ikebukuro Station South Exit.”\n\nThe Seibu South Exit, on the other hand, can be found a bit south from the East Exit.\n\n7) JR's ticket gates are all in the basement, except for the Metropolitan ticket gate\n\nThe stairs on the JR platforms descend to Ikebukuro Station's basement level, where several ticket gates are located: the north ticket gate, the central 1 ticket gate, the central 2 ticket gate, and the south ticket gate. The only way upstairs is at the southern end of the platforms and leads to the only exit that is above ground: the Metropolitan ticket gate that leads towards the West Exit. Keep in mind that it is impossible to go to the East Exit from there.\n\nThe exit and transfer information at JR’s platforms.\n\n・In the center is the JR platforms and ticket gates. East of them (near the East Exit) are the Seibu platforms and ticket gates and the Seibu Department Store. To the west are the Tobu-Tojo platforms and ticket gates, and the Tobu Department Store.\n\n・The station facilities are generally located on the first basement level. To get to the ground level, go either east or west and use the stairs leading up.\n\n・The ticket gates of the three main railway companies JR, Seibu, and Tobu are connected by three main passageways: North, Central, and South. Their respective platforms also have ticket gates leading in those directions. (Only Seibu does not have a ticket gate connecting to the North Passage.)\n\n・The ticket gates of the Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line are on the east side of the Central Passage (to the east of JR central ticket 1 and 2), and near the center.\n\n・The ticket gates of the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line are on the west side of the Central Passage, via Echika Ikebukuro.\n\n・The ticket gates of the Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line are on the east side of the South Passage (near the JR southern ticket gates), and on the west side (near the Metropolitan Plaza Underground Exit)\n\n■Ikebukuro Station layout ↓■\n\n↑Guidance display inside Ikebukuro Station\n\nIkebukuro Station is served by four railway companies in total. Next to the JR lines, there is also the Seibu Ikebukuro Line of Seibu Railways, the Tobu-Tojo Line of Tobu Railways, and the Marunouchi Line, Fukutoshin Line, and Yurakucho Line of Tokyo Metro.\n\nEspecially JR’s Yamanote Line and Tokyo Metro’s Marunouchi Line offer convenient access to various sightseeing spots, while the Seibu Ikebukuro Line and the Tobu-Tojo Line will carry you to Saitama and Tokyo’s north.\n\n■The platforms of the four companies serving Ikebukuro Station ↓■\n\n~JR East・Seibu Railway~\n\n~Tobu Railway・Tokyo Metro~\n\n↑1.
