        "text": "We know now the Black Hood is going after the victims who previously escaped him, as well as those he perceives to be sinners. With Midge and Chic dead, that leaves a couple of obvious victims next – maybe Moose, or indeed Fred Andrews.\n\nBut it feels more likely that he’ll target Sheriff Keller.\n\nHe’ll find himself in the crosshairs because of his affair with Mayor McCoy, but from a narrative perspective, it makes sense: Keller is exactly the sort of prominent supporting character whose death would create emotional stakes, but not represent a massive change in the same way killing Archie’s dad would.\n\nNext week, then, Sheriff Keller should probably be worried about more than just his job.\n\nHere’s my piece on this week’s Riverdale episode, which I’d love if people could share around a bit.\n\nThis particular article ponders whether Hal is the Black Hood, if Sheriff Keller is likely to be his next victim, and more. (Like, for example, why Cheryl and the River Vixens have a special funeral outfit. Actually, it’s less a question, because the reason is obvious – it is Extremely Extra, in a way that suits both Cheryl and Riverdale, so it makes perfect sense – and more of a celebration.)\n\nAnd, yes, if you’re thinking that the above picture has very little to do with the above text, then… well, then you’d be correct. These things happen, you know how it is."
