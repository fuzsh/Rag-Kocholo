        "text": "Lucille Jewell\n\nBowdoinham – Lucille Leonard Jewell 92, energetic mother, teacher, gardener, bird watcher, Girl Scout leader, tennis player and cribbage enthusiast died at home on December 31, 2012. Lucille was born on January 17, 1920 in Wilmington, Delaware daughter of Lucille (Putnam) Leonard and Newton Peckham Leonard. She grew up in Providence RI with her younger sister Nina where their parents were high school teachers. Lucille graduated from Mount Hope High School in 1938 and went on to Bates College where she earned a degree in Biology. She graduated Cum Laude in 1942. Lucille often recalled family summers of her youth at Common Fence Point on Narragansett Bay as well as a memorable bicycle trip through Europe with a student group led by her father. Lucille met Malcolm L. Jewell at Bates and they were married on August 15, 1942. Their first home was in Northampton Mass where they worked in Springfield in support of the war effort. Their first child Nina Lee was born in Springfield in 1943. Shortly thereafter Malcolm joined the Navy and Lucille and Nina moved to Providence to live with her parents. There, her second child Stephen was born in June 1945. After the war, the small family moved to Malcolm's family farm –Keewaydin-- in Bowdoinham. While Malcolm worked in Lewiston, Lucille busied herself raising the family at the farm. 1949 saw the birth of Jeffery Fisher, followed by Katherine in 1951 and Jeremy Chase in 1953. In addition to her growing family, Lucille helped raise a variety of farm animals over the years, as well as lush summer gardens. She canned and preserved vegetables and fruits and churned butter from the cows' milk. The Jewell children looked forward to their weekly trips to Brunswick where she sold her homemade butter. As the children got older each summer Lucille invited exchange students from abroad to the farm. She entertained students from England, France and Japan. When the children were grown, Lucille expanded old interests and embraced new pursuits. While she had always enjoyed welcoming the song birds to her garden, she became a founding member of the Merrymeeting Audubon Society. Lucille planted perennial beds to complement the well-established vegetable garden. She became an active tennis player and somehow during these years had time to earn a Master’s degree in Education and teach mathematics. She and Malcolm became energetic travelers and visited many of the countries of Europe. We all recall her dedicated involvement with the Unitarian Universalist Church of Brunswick. Every year she prepared great quantities of chowder for the 'Annual Christmas Fish Chowder Luncheon'. Winter always found Lucille creating another beautiful braided rug for family and friends. Lucille was predeceased by Malcolm L. Jewell (1920-2008) husband of 66 years, Katherine J. Fiori (1951-2008), Jeremy Chase Jewell (1953-1967) and Jeffery Fisher Jewell (1949-1950). She is survived by her sister Nina Sloan of Jefferson Ferry, New York, daughter Nina J. Mendall and her husband Peter J. Mendall of Bowdoinham, and son Stephen P. Jewell and wife Patricia B. Jewell of Barre, Mass. Lucille leaves seven grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren. Special thanks go to her devoted daytime companion for the past four years, Beverly Pulk, of Brunswick.

Hanson and Anna Maria Cristina Peterson (Hanson)\n\nShe was a graduate of Deering High, class of 1940. Phyllis enjoyed softball and pitched briefly for an amateur team in the area named “The City of Portland”.\n\nPhyllis enjoyed cooking, in particular, bread making and preparing meals. She had an authentic Danish pastry recipe that she made on occasion and was perhaps her most adored creation. She frequently made scotch cookies for family members for birthdays or simply on request. There was hardly a family event that wasn’t serviced by her bountiful kitchen labors and everyone looked forward to getting together for that express reason. Phyllis’s character was directly reflected in her baking. Both were simple and elegant and immensely satisfying. She was adored for her boundless love and heartwarming sincerity. Phyllis also enjoyed shopping, eating out and interacting with people in general. She was always delighted to make new acquaintances and immediately endeared herself to anyone fortunate enough to traverse in the circle of her large extended family. Phyllis was just as comfortable visiting her son Bob and his family in Seattle or her daughter Nancy and her family in South Carolina as she was receiving guests in the comfort of her own home. As they say, home is where the heart is and Phyllis always traveled with her heart wide open and accepting of others. Phyllis was also interested in the lives and welfare of many of her nieces and nephews and great nieces and nephews and looked forward to any news from, by or about them. Her sense of humor was spontaneous and contagious and helped carry a lot of us through some challenging moments. Phyllis and her husband Mac both loved the outdoors and enjoyed camping with the children and grandchildren. Priceless evenings were spent in the cabins feasting on freshly caught trout and her homemade bread or biscuits. Phyllis also enjoyed feeding wild birds and she and Mac spent countless hours identifying them and keeping a calendar noting their arrivals and departures with the seasons. She had an uncanny knack for drawing in hummingbirds and would often have several of them perched in nearby trees waiting for their turn at her feeder. Phyllis was a housewife and homemaker most of her adult life. Raising seven children kept her busy in an era when there were few labor saving, affordable appliances. She dedicated herself to the comfort of others and did so with energy and purpose. She worked at L.L. Bean as a seasonal packer one year and loved the experience but otherwise stayed close to home and its manifold obligations. She was rarely at a loss for activity. She enjoyed having her grandchildren search for “Tickling Sticks” which she would then have them draw lightly across her arm for relaxation. This was her evening “cocktail” and often put her to sleep. Often, she radiated an aura of everything being right with the would that left us feeling tranquil and indulged. One never left her presence feeling unloved. Phyllis lived a rich and meaningful life and will be deeply missed by many people, both friends and family. She was predeceased by her husband of 63 years Ervin “Mac” McCluskeyJr., daughters Donna Curry and Janice McCluskey. She is survived by daughters Arlene Smith of Bowdoinham, Nancy Laliberty of Greer, South Carolina, sons Robert E. McCluskey and his wife Marne of Indio, California, Richard D. McCluskey and wife Donna of Richmond, Maine, John McCluskey of Winslow, Maine.

Bussey\n\nBATH - Robert Bridgham Bussey, 68, a prominent educator and local businessman, died Aug. 19, 2012, at his home, after a courageous 12-year battle with A.L.S. Born Jan. 26, 1944, in Gadsen, Ala., he was the first-born child of Janet Bridgham Bussey and attorney Lynn MacPherson Bussey.\n\nHe was educated in Bath schools and graduated from Morse High School in 1962. In 1966 he graduated from Wesleyan University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and followed that up in 1968 with a master's degree in European history at Vanderbilt University. He then taught history and coached at the Pomfret School in Connecticut, served as the academic headmaster at The American School in Switzerland, located in Lugano, and followed that by a brief stint as the admissions director at Finch College. In 1976 Bob was appointed headmaster of the Miss Hall's School and served in that capacity for the next eight years. Bob, in partnership with his brother, Bill, opened Bridgham & Cook, Ltd., a British import store in Exeter, N.H., in 1985. Three years later the store eventually found its way to its current location in Freeport. Athletics were an integral part of Bob's life, particularly as a teenager at Morse High School. As a bruising three-sport varsity athlete, Bob particularly loved football, in which his passing skills took a backseat to his punishing running and defensive approach. Memory is a tricky thing, but Dave Bourque, the long-time sports writer and editor for the Times-Record, recalled one particular American Legion baseball game that took place behind the current Bath Middle School. Dave steadfastly maintained that Bob smashed a rocket shot long past the center field fence and deep into the parking lot that never climbed higher than fifteen feet. Bob also was the co-captain of the 1962 Morse High basketball squad that beat Bangor for the state championship only to lose to East Providence in the first round in the New England tourney. In that crucial game he failed to score a single point for the first time in his career. Years later Bob maintained that his best moment of that evening came several hours following the game, when he reached out and snagged an unsteady Morse High booster out of the path of an oncoming taxi. At the age of 32 he became the youngest boarding school headmaster in the country when he accepted the appointment to what was then known as The Hall School, Pittsfield, Mass. Like many other boarding schools at the time, the financially struggling institution was on the brink of collapse when he took over. Additionally, the school was in its first year of what proved to be a brief stretch as a co-ed school. He immediately focused in on increasing the student enrollment, particularly the international population of the school. Bob, along with his admissions director Diederek van Renesse, visited the homes of families from Nigeria to Saudi Arabia to Hong Kong and all points in between to make it happen. As the school slowly regained its financial footing, he steered the institution back to its rightful identity as an all-girls school, and thus, in the early-1980s, The Hall School once again became known as Miss Hall's School. Joan Kurber, his assistant at Miss Hall's recalled that \"his uncanny ability to say the right thing to anyone in any situation\" ensured the vitality of the school when many others were closing. After leaving Miss Hall's, and in his words, \"released from a responsible life,\" his venture into British imports in 1985 with his brother, Bill, was motivated in large measure by his love of the British Isles and an avenue that would put him in \"regular contact with British and Irish pubs.\" In 2010 their business, Bridgham & Cook, Ltd., Freeport, was passed on to his daughter, Kate and his son, Nick, and has thrived under their ownership. His keen mind, his insatiable curiosity and his steel-trap memory made him an intellectual force of nature. As a lifelong voracious reader and gifted writer, he would not hesitate, if the situation warranted it, to cut to the heart of any matter with a surgeon's skill. He was, like his father before him, a man of strong loyalties who treasured his family and his friends. His irreverent sense of humor wrapped its arms around the outrageous and the inappropriate. Throughout his life he would go to infinite lengths to pull off pranks on unsuspecting friends who not only endured them over the years but also came to embrace the insanity of it all. These qualities, these friendships, along with his family and the love of his life, his wife, Anne, would serve him well as he faced his final hurdle. In 2000 at the time that he was diagnosed with A.L.S., his neurologist attempted to dissuade Bob from his plans to \"go all the way\" with the disease - the frank assessment being that such a course would be \"bleak\" in many ways. When later asked what he thought about his doctor's opinion, Bob replied, \"Well, he's not me, is he?\" He never wavered from his initial decision to \"take it down to a blink,\" never once complained and made it clear early on that he was not \"throwing a pity party for every part of his body that stopped working.\" He was to those closest to him a tower of strength. He smiled for as long as his muscles allowed, but his love for his family and those around him never left his eyes.\n\nHe is survived by his devoted wife of 23 years, Anne Norment Bussey of Bath; his daughter, Kate Bussey Paulus and husband, Jay, of Bath; Kate's mother, Bob's first wife, Karen Back Bussey, of Bath; his son, Nicholas B. Bussey of Brooklyn, N.Y.; Nicholas' mother, Bob's second wife, Lisa S. Bussey and her partner, Nan Barbour, of Portland; three siblings, Anne Bussey Dale and her husband, Michael, of Ellsworth, John M. Bussey and wife, Jiraporn, of Bath and William C. Bussey and wife, Nan, of Dedham, Mass.; and his beloved grandchildren, Alexander, Christopher and Isabelle Paulus of Bath. In addition, he is survived by nieces and nephews, Benjamin M. Dale and wife, Elena, of New Jersey, Rosemary Dale Soule, Jonathan B. Dale and wife, Abby, all of Maine, Kate and Sarah Bussey of Dedham, Mass., and Jason H. Bussey of Bath; twin great-nieces, Anne Leznik Dale and Emily Bussey Dale; and great-nephews, Nathan William and Zachary Bridgham Soule and Jacob Michael Dale. In addition he is survived by his namesake and devoted uncle, F. Robert Bussey and wife, Ruth, of New Orleans, The Bussey family expresses their deep appreciation to the many people who helped Bob navigate his final 12 years. Among them are the following: Dr. Paul LaPrad, Dr. James McCormick, Dr. Hal Sreden and Dr. Artin Mahmoudi - Beijing United Hospital; Jane Greenblatt and Jill Lufkin-Robinson of Home, Hope and Healing, Inc. and his most recent nurses, Cyndy Dalton, Ronald Dyer, Marie Erskine, Nancy Gerrans, Stephanie Mark, Diane Prevost, and Stephanie Shapiro; Ronnie Sweeney, Holly White and Terry Nehring of CHANS Home Health Care; the staff of the intensive care unit at Mid-Coast Maine Hospital, Brunswick; and Bath Fire and Rescue.\n\nA celebration of Bob's life will take place 11 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 8, at Grace Episcopal Church, 1100 Washington St., Bath.

He used to drive around Bowdoinham in either his black Ford Mustang or on his black motorcycle. I don’t know about the others in town but I know how it used to annoy me to get behind him when he was on his motorcycle.
