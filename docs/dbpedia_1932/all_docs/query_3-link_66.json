        "text": "“Alive and Well - and Almost as Well Known as He Ever Was”\n\nHis name‚ likeness‚ characters and words have been used to advertise products and inspire songwriters‚ artists and novelists. “Mark Twain” has appeared as a brand on cigars‚ clothing and motorboats. Schools‚ casinos‚ hotels‚ parks‚ restaurants‚ lakes and bridges have all been named after him. Monuments and memorials have been erected worldwide to honor America’s most famous writer and humorist.\n\nSam Clemens was actively engaged in shaping the public’s perception of ”Mark Twain.” He was acutely aware of the commercial value of his persona and sought to capitalize on it. He worked to become known not only as a humorist‚ but also as a political commentator‚ family man‚ international diplomat‚ philosopher and all-around American.\n\nMore than hundred years after his death‚ the continued use of the Mark Twain name and image confirms his lasting popularity and legendary status.\n\nAs Shelley Fisher Fishkin wrote in Lighting Out for the Territory‚ “As a legend‚ Mark Twain is alive and well – and almost as well known as he ever was.”\n\nTwain Fun Facts\n\nFun Fact\n\nTwain was born and died in years when Halley’s Comet passed by Earth: Twain says, “I came in with Halley’s Comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don’t go with Halley’s Comet. The Almighty has said, no doubt: ‘Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.'”\n\nNamesakes\n\nSchools in at least 16 states have been named after him, as well as Mark Twain International Schools in Romania and Argentina.\n\nFamous Friends\n\nTwain met activist Helen Keller, who could neither hear nor see, and her teacher Anne Sullivan. It is Twain who is credited with calling Sullivan a “miracle worker,” a nickname which later became the inspiration for Tony Award-winning writer William Gibson’s play and movie.\n\nImpact on History\n\nThe term “The Gilded Age” was coined by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner in their 1873 book The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today, and references the extravagant displays of wealth and excess by America’s upper class during the post-Civil War years of the late 19th century.\n\nOnstage\n\nHal Holbrook performed as Mark Twain in his one-man show Mark Twain Tonight! from 1959 to 2017. The documentary Holbrook/Twain: An American Odyssey features commentary about Holbrook’s love of Twain from Holbrook as well as Sean Penn, Martin Sheen, Emile Hirsch, Annie Potts, Cherry Jones, and Robert Patrick.\n\nFlowers\n\nThere is a variety of African violet named after Mark Twain.\n\nMusic\n\nBands in many musical generes have named themselves after Mark Twain, including The Mark Twain Chorus and Orchestra (show tunes); Mark Twain’s Dog (folk); MC Mark Twain; Mark Twain, Joggy Crew (rap); and The Mark Twain Ringers (handbell ringers).\n\nBrand\n\nTwain’s name and image have been used to market many products. During his lifetime, Mark Twain allowed his name and image to be used on such things as flour, pens, cigars, and Oldsmobiles. After his death in 1910, his brand has been used on lemons and oranges (in 1923), a line of clothing (1940s), and coal (1950s).\n\nTV\n\nMark Twain as a character has appeared in many TV shows, including Bonaza, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Family Guy, Touched by an Angel, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Late Show with David Letterman, Fantasy Island, Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color, and The Rifleman. Cartoon animator Chuck Jones based his character, Wile E. Coyote, after a description of the animal in Twain’s book about the American west, Roughing It."
