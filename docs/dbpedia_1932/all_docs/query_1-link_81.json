        "text": "Riverdale is a difficult place to stay alive. Just look at these folks who’ve traded in Pop Tate’s burgers and shakes for the sweet, sweet afterlife. Ever since Jason Blossom’s death opened the show on season 1, Riverdale has not been shy about killing off characters, regardless of our affections (love you forever, Joaquin DeSantos).\n\nBelow, a comprehensive list of those who have faced their deaths (and honestly should return as ghosts just to show Hiram Lodge what’s up):\n\nSeason 1\n\nJason Blossom\n\nEpisode: “Chapter One: The River’s Edge”\n\nCause of death: It’s revealed by the end of season 1 that Jason was shot by his father, Clifford Blossom. Following a failed attempt to leave Riverdale to be with a pregnant Polly, Jason was kidnapped by Mustang, a Southside Serpent who tried to get Clifford to pay money in exchange for his son. Instead, Clifford shot Jason (who knew about his father’s drug trafficking), leaving FP and Joaquin to clean up the mess and dump the body into Sweetwater River.\n\nMustang\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Twelve: Anatomy of a Murder”\n\nCause of death: Also killed by Clifford, who tried to frame it as a suicide via overdose at the City Center Motor Hotel in the Southside. Clifford was likely trying to cover up his tracks as the investigation of Jason’s murder proceeded.\n\nClifford Blossom\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Twelve: Anatomy of a Murder”\n\nCause of death: Suicide by hanging at the Blossom barn not long after Cheryl confronted him about murdering Jason and having video evidence.\n\nSeason 2\n\nMs. Grundy\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Fourteen: A Kiss Before Dying”\n\nCause of death: Strangled by her own cello bow by the Black Hood following a piano lesson with Ben Button in Greendale. This would be the start of the Black Hood’s mission to rid Riverdale of all its sinners (following the failed assassination of Fred Andrews in the season 1 finale).\n\nMr. Phillips, aka the Sugarman\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Nineteen: Death Proof”\n\nCause of death: Shot by the Black Hood while in jail for being a drug dealer (for mostly Jingle Jangle) at the now-closed Southside High School.\n\nJoseph Conway/Svenson\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Twenty-Two: Silent Night, Deadly Night”\n\nCause of death: Shot by Sheriff Keller after a mix-up orchestrated by the real Black Hood (Hal) involving Betty and Archie.\n\nCharles Smith (Alice and FP’s son)\n\nEpisode: N/A\n\nCause of death: According to Chic, who posed as Charles on season 2, the real Charles Smith died during a fight between the two at their motel in nearby Centerville. But this is Riverdale, so don’t be surprised if Charles shows up at the Cooper house one day. One day....\n\nDwayne\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Twenty-Five: The Wicked and the Divine”\n\nCause of death: It’s believed that Dwayne, a drug dealer who showed up to the Cooper house looking for Chic, was killed after he tried to attack Alice. (It’s unclear if Alice was the one who killed Dwayne with a lamp in the living room, or if Chic was responsible.) Betty arrived home just in time to help her mother clean up the blood (there was so much blood) and hide the body in a sewer. With the help of FP, the body was later buried in Fox Forest.\n\nPapa Poutine\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Twenty-Five: The Wicked and the Divine”\n\nCause of death: Shot by Andre, Hiram’s right-hand man and the Pembrooke’s doorman. Poutine was killed under Hiram’s orders after his plans to kill Hiram were revealed, not because the mobster criticized Pop Tate’s poutine. (FYI: His son, Small Fry, is killed by Hermione in self-defense nine episodes later.)\n\nCassidy Bullock\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Hills Have Eyes”\n\nCause of death: Shot by Andre following a failed robbery attempt at Veronica’s family lodge, aptly named Lodge Lodge. Hiram later uses Sheriff Minetta to bribe the other robbers, aka the Shadow Lake boys, to lie about the murder to frame Archie, who is subsequently arrested and sent to juvenile detention.\n\nMidge Klump\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Thirty-One: A Night to Remember”\n\nCause of death: Stabbed by the Black Hood and pinned to a wall at the end of the Carrie musical.\n\nDr. Masters\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Thirty-Four: Judgment Night”\n\nCause of death: Killed by Hal at the hospital. Dr. Masters, unaware he was speaking to the Black Hood, asked too many questions about the injuries he sustained from Cheryl and her bow. This is how Hal responded.\n\nAndre\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Thirty-Four: Judgment Night”\n\nCause of death: Killed by Small Fry at the Pembrooke. Andre was simply in the way of a man who was looking to seek revenge on the Lodges for his father’s death.\n\nSeason 3\n\nDilton Doiley\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Thirty-Seven: Fortune and Men’s Eyes”\n\nCause of death: Cyanide poisoning via Gryphons & Gargoyles. Per Ben and Ethel Muggs, Dilton wanted to “ascend” in the game. Later on season 3, the death of Dilton’s father, Daryl, is discussed in great length. It’s revealed that he died by oleander poisoning, although his killer has yet to be identified.\n\nBen Button\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Thirty-Seven: Fortune and Men’s Eyes”\n\nCause of death: Suicide by jumping out of a window at Riverdale General Hospital. Before he jumped, Ben told Betty and Jughead that he was going to be with Dilton and ascend. It’s slightly unclear if Ben is really dead because you can catch him in season 1 of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina as a pizza delivery boy.\n\nMr. Featherhead (the principal at Riverdale High in the ‘80s and ‘90s)\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Midnight Club”\n\nCause of death: Cyanide poisoning on the same night the members of The Midnight Club, aka the teens’ parents, played Gryphons & Gargoyles in the early ’90s.\n\nWarden Norton\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Forty: The Great Escape”\n\nCause of death: Self-inflicted cyanide poisoning in his office inside the prison. It’s unclear where the instructions came from, Hiram Lodge or the Gargoyle King (if they are, in fact, two separate people).\n\nJoaquin DeSantos\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Forty-One: Manhunter”\n\nCause of death: Cyanide poisoning. His death seems to be a message to Jughead, but was his death ordered or did he simply want to “ascend” like the others who have played G&G? The branding of Joaquin’s forehead (with a symbol that means sacrifice) makes his death even more suspicious.\n\nThe Shadow Lake Boys\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Forty-One: Manhunter”\n\nCause of death: Sheriff Minetta shot them all in the mines, per Hiram’s orders, after Veronica discovered footage of the sheriff bribing the group to frame Archie for murder.\n\nSister Woodhouse and the nuns from Sisters of Quiet Mercy\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Forty-Four: No Exit”\n\nCause of death: Cyanide poisoning. Despite agreeing to testify against Hiram, Sister Woodhouse and the nuns from Sisters of Quiet Mercy are bailed out by an anonymous donor (ahem, Hiram) and leave a message on the jail cell wall, “We go to join thee.” Betty rushes to the asylum chamber and finds all the sisters dead from cyanide. In G&G terms, they have ascended.\n\nClaudius Blossom\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Forty-Five: The Stranger”\n\nCause of death: Unknown. Claudius’s body is found in the Riverdale PD jail cell after FP makes a citizen’s arrest in their ploy to lure Hiram out with Archie (and Tall Boy the Gargoyle King) as bait. The next time we see Claudius, who, by the way, was Hiram’s pick for the next sheriff, he’s as lifeless as his nephew Jason. It’s unclear if Claudius was murdered or if he “ascended” like most of the characters who’ve died this season.\n\nTall Boy\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Forty-Five: The Stranger”\n\nCause of death: Tall Boy was allegedly shot and killed by Sheriff Minetta and other police in a gunfight on season 2 (“Chapter Thirty-Five: Brave New World”), not long after he impersonated the Black Hood.\n\nBut in a season 3 twist, Tall Boy is revealed to be one version of the Gargoyle King. After he’s captured by the Serpents, Fangs accidentally kills Tall Boy (for real this time) in self-defense (Fangs says he was trying to escape). To cover the death, Jughead suggests holding a Serpent party.\n\nSheriff Minetta\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Forty-Six: The Red Dahlia”\n\nCause of death: Shot by Hermione after their secret affair. Turns out, Minetta’s body wasn’t decapitated and his hands were never sawed off as Pop described in “Chapter Forty-Two: The Man in Black.” He was working for Hermione, although it’s unclear when he officially switched his loyalty from Hiram to Hermione. After a failed attempt to kill Hiram (an order issued by Hermione), Minetta himself is shot five times and left for dead.\n\nBaby Teeth\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Fifty-Three: Jawbreaker”\n\nCause of death: Archie Andrews’ ex-prison friend Baby Teeth was found much in the same way as Dilton, apparently killed by the Gargoyle Gang. However, according to the coroner, he died from loss of blood and from the removal of his teeth…premortem. It looks like Jughead and Sheriff Jones are eyeing GG member Kurtz for the murder and a bad batch of Fizzle Rocks. Looks like we should be nervous, because Kurtz says BT was just the warm-up for FP and his family.\n\nRandy Ronson\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Fifty-Four: Fear the Reaper”\n\nCause of death: This guy fought Archie at his boxing gym, and he took so many drugs beforehand that he overdosed.\n\nKurtz\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Fifty-Four: Fear the Reaper”\n\nCause of death: In a really odd twist, Jellybean was captured and Jughead had to play a game with Kurtz in order to get her back. Kurtz brought him to a junkyard where there were two fridges and Jughead had to pick a fridge, but after he got in and got out, he found Kurtz dead. The Gargoyle King was right behind him.\n\nHal Cooper\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Fifty-Seven: Survive the Night”\n\nCause of death: Hal was shot in the head by Penelope Blossom at the end of that weird survival-of-the-fittest type game the Core Four had to play in the woods at the end of the third season. That said, this is Riverdale, so if he ends up alive at some point, don’t say we didn’t warn you.\n\nSeason 4\n\nFred Andrews\n\nEpisode: “Chapter Fifty-Eight: In Memoriam”\n\nCause of death: After Luke Perry’s death, Riverdale had to figure out how to write him off the show. In the first episode of season 4, Fred Andrews got out of his car to help a woman on the side of the road who needed it. When a car came toward them, he pushed her out of the way and died as a result.\n\nEdgar Evernever\n\nEpisode: \"Chapter Sixty: Dog Day Afternoon\"\n\nCause of death: Shot by Alice Cooper while wearing an Evil Knievel suit...Okay, there's a little more to it than that. After Edgar sends Polly into the Riverdale police station with a bomb strapped to her chest, Betty is able to disarm it with a bobby pin! HER MIND.\n\nNext, after knocking out Betty, Edgar attempts to have his daughter-wife Evelyn Evernever (Zoé De Grand Maison) drive the Farm’s new school bus off of a cliff with the Coopers in tow. Meanwhile, he'll escape on a rocket. It doesn't work out.\n\nUncle Bedford Blossom\n\nEpisode: \"Chapter Sixty-Three: Hereditary\"\n\nCause of death: Uncle Bedford showed up at the chapel one night, where he found Julian AND Jason. Not good, according to Uncle B. He tried to attack Cheryl, grabbing her neck and threatening to call the police. Which is when Toni — bless her heart — hit him over the head with a candlestick and knocked him out.\n\nMr Chipping\n\nEpisode: \"Chapter Sixty-Three: Hereditary\"\n\nCause of death: In the middle of a lesson about morality, Mr. Chipping abruptly ended class by jumping out the window. Jughead — who sadly saw the entire thing — shouted to the other students to call an ambulance, and no one even flinched. Jughead became suspicious about the entire thing, for obvious reasons.\n\nThis will be updated as more characters are killed off on Riverdale.\\"
