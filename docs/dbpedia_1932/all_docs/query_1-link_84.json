        "text": "At age 6, Hal Beesley sold magazines door-to-door in Los Angeles to help his family during the Depression. By the time he was a teenager, he owned his own after-school newsstand at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Alvarado Street.\n\nIt seems like there wasn't a time in his life that the longtime Las Vegas land developer wasn't working on one project or another.\n\n\"My father's philosophy was that he could not make money unless the working man was working and making money on his projects,\" said Hal Beesley Jr., a Southern Nevada land surveyor and native Las Vegan.\n\n\"It surprised a lot of folks that a wealthy man like my dad was a Democrat. But one of the things he enjoyed about making money was that many others also benefited.\"\n\nMost recently, Beesley was working on a $2 1/2 million land deal that eventually would develop a stretch of Sloan Road near Stewart Avenue.\n\nBeesley, who in the 1950s subdivided land in the shadow of Sunrise Mountain that became the rural Green Acres development, died Monday at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, Calif., where he had maintained a vacation residence. He was 75.\n\nThe cause of death was a heart attack brought on by adult onset diabetes, which Beesley had battled for 35 years, his family said.\n\nServices for the Las Vegas resident of 48 years are pending. Palm Mortuary-Eastern is handling the arrangements.\n\nIn the 1950s, Clark County named Beesley Drive in Green Acres in his honor. In 1965, the CBS sitcom \"Green Acres\" debuted, and Beesley became the butt of ribbing from friends because the show's farm outside fictional Hooterville was a rural eyesore.\n\n\"He took that kidding in stride,\" said Beesley's wife, Patricia Beesley, editor of the SUN's women's pages during the 1950s. \"The ironic thing is that we have the same (type of) headboard in our bedroom as the one that was on that television show.\"\n\nBeesley was known for a take-charge demeanor in his business dealings.\n\n\"Dad was never one for giving up control,\" said Hal Jr., who lives in a home on Beesley Drive off Charleston Boulevard, and occasionally did surveying work for his father. \"Originally, he had planned to be in Las Vegas only a short time, but he saw so much opportunity here that he stayed. And he never retired.\"\n\nIt is estimated that in his career, Beesley bought and subdivided about 172 acres of prime Las Vegas real estate, most of it in the Northeast, where hundreds of Las Vegans now call home.\n\nRenown local magician Lance Burton owns a home on Beesley-developed land. Keller Middle School also was built on Beesley property. Beesley, however, was a longtime resident of the downtown Las Vegas area.\n\n\"Hal was a good neighbor and always had a cheerful word for everybody,\" said former two-term Nevada Gov. Mike O'Callaghan, a longtime friend. \"His contributions to Nevada had a positive effect on thousands of people who never enjoyed the experience of knowing him.\"\n\nBorn June 20, 1922, in Los Angeles, Beesley graduated from John Marshall High School and attended Woodbury Business College there.\n\nDuring World War II, he served in the Navy and was aboard the U.S.S. Mt. McKinley to witness the atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll.\n\nIn 1946, Beesley returned to Los Angeles, where he became a circulation agent for the Los Angeles Times and was in charge of downtown newsboy deliveries. He held that position until 1953, three years after he moved to Las Vegas.\n\nAlthough he was a general contractor, Beesley was more interested in buying and subdividing Southern Nevada land than he was in building homes on the property.\n\nHis love of wide-open spaces greatly influenced Beesley's decision to divide his land into half- and three-quarter-acre lots, where some residents today still keep horses.\n\nBeesley was a past Grand Knight of the Knights of Columbus No. 2828, and a member of the Elks Lodge, Submarine Veterans Association, American Battleship Association and American Legion, among other organizations.\n\nIn addition to his wife and son, Beesley is survived by three daughters, Erin, Shannon and Kathleen Beesley, all of Las Vegas; a brother, Bruce Beesley of Los Angeles; a sister, Thelma Franz of Los Angeles; a grandson, Hal John Beesley III of Tampa, Fla.; and a granddaughter, Kristen Nicole Beesley of Las Vegas.\n\nDONATIONS: In Beesley's memory to Bishop Gorman High School or the UNLV Foundation.\n\narchive"
