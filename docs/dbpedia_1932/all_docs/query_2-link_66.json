        "text": "N\n\nNorrie Robbins posted a condolence\n\nHal was my boss at the USGS in Reston. He was a wonderful boss--he loved his job. He had the most amazing library of books about how to be an effective boss. He actually read those books; he recognized that the boss of a bunch of scientists needed to be a good psychologist, which of course isn't a skill that trained geologists learn. I'd go to his office with my latest great idea, looking for input and guidance. He'd say, hummm I once thought of something like that, and he'd reach into his file cabinet and pull out a file folder. It always had some actual data in it. I've had lots of bosses, but he stands out uniquely because to him it was a creative, happy occupation. I'll miss him, his friendship, his wisdom, and his enthusiasm. So sorry Leah and kids. Norrie Robbins\n\nH\n\nHarold Keller posted a symbolic gesture\n\n//s3.amazonaws.com/skins.funeraltechweb.com/tribute-gestures/v2/basketball.png\n\nMy condolences to the loving family of Hal, Harold as I knew him. I go back to 1946 entering the 6th grade at Lincoln school. Coming from a one room country school, I opt out of the religious education (Christian), which was still taught in our schools. So Harold and I was excused from the class and we went outdoors and shot hoops. Harold moved from the apartment above the Paris Cleaners to a house just one block from where I lived. So we were good childhood buddies. I lost track of Harold when he went on to University High School. I went on to through Champaign Junior and Senior High Schools. After Google came into being, I looked up Harold and called him when he lived in Virginia. We renewed our lost friendship. At the time, I was living near Denver, CO. Had I known he moved to Denver, I would have extended out to renew our friendship. My heart goes out to all his family and friends. I just lost my wife of 64 years, just 4 weeks ago. I know the emptiness in your heart. Regards, Harold Keller\n\nD\n\nDaniel J. Casagrande posted a condolence\n\nI can not wrap my head around the fact that my friend and mentor, Hal Gluskoter, has passed. When folks reflect on their respective lives, I believe that there are a handful of people who stand out as having had a major influence on their life. In my 75 years of life, I can say that Hal was one of these people in my life. I have known Hal for virtually my entire professional career of almost 60 years. Hal was a friend, mentor, and a tremendous human being. He was one of the smartest guys I have ever known. Hal had a technical grasp of virtually anything that I would bring up -- it didn't matter whether it was a coal geochemistry issue or a problem that I was having with the functioning of my car. Hal had a grasp of day-to-day life experiences along with a knowledge of extremely detailed technical nuances that were unparalleled . Hal was my Leader - I hesitate to use the term boss because he always made you feel like a peer - at EXXON Production Research in Houston; he personally created the best coal exploration research team ever assembled. Quite simply. Hal attracted the best talent in the world because everyone wanted a chance to work with him. I believe that I was the third person he hired of a team that grew to greater than 75 people within about a 2 year period. I saw first hand his leadership, technical prowess, and charisma. Hal cared for his people, protected them to a fault, and always encouraged and mentored folks. One could always be sure that Hal Gluskoter was supporting you whether or not you were directly in front of him. While I could have the most technical of discussions with Hal on any coal geochemistry related item, I relished our private discussions on our respective families (he loved his family!!!!), how he would be getting ready to fix something around the house, or even technical problems in restoring his old Corvairs. Hal would actually restore Corvairs to \"clear his mind\" and relax!!! The bottom line on Hal Gluskoter is that he was a tremendous human being who I will always remember and will always miss. My thoughts and prayers go out to my friend Leah and the entire Gluskoter family. Dan Casagrande"
