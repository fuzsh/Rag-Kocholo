        "text": "This post contains spoilers for Riverdale Season 2, Episode 20, “Shadow of a Doubt.”\n\nWith just two episodes left in its sophomore season, Riverdale is determined to keep viewers guessing until the end—and unlike many dramas, whose mysteries often get solved on Reddit months before they unravel on screen, it seems this show actually knows how to keep its mouth shut. Last week’s installment dropped some pretty obvious hints that Betty Cooper’s father, Hal, is actually also the mass-murdering Black Hood. This week, however, seemed to at least complicate that notion when the Black Hood showed up at a local debate with a gun, shooting at townspeople below—including Hal. But that doesn’t necessarily mean Hal was a decoy all along. There’s also the possibility that Riverdale is taking a page out of Scream’s playbook—and there might really be two killers on the loose.\n\nThere have, after all, been some head-scratching aspects to Season 2’s various murders. Ms. Grundy, the Black Hood’s first victim, was choked by a masked man in her home. Fred Andrews came next: a masked man hit him with a nonfatal gunshot at Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe. One could dismiss the two different methods based on location; it would be difficult to fatally strangle someone in a populated diner. But the next incident complicated things further: someone opened fire on Moose and Midge in their car in the woods, without bothering to check to see if they’d survived. Was that a mistake or an intentional move by someone who wasn’t actually trying to kill the teenagers?\n\nIn any case, both survived. When Midge told Archie about the killer, she described a man who wasn’t wearing a mask, with “blank” eyes—though Archie recalled them being green. Midge ultimately bit the dust next, though, when the Black Hood killed her during the show’s musical episode—a murder the Black Hood used to prove that he (or she) was still at large after Sheriff Keller shot the previously identified culprit, Riverdale High School janitor Mr. Svenson. The Black Hood also shot Robert Phillips, the drug dealer who had been supplying Southside High, in his jail cell. And finally, last week, we saw the Black Hood chase down Betty’s fake brother, Chic—whose whereabouts and well-being are, so far, unknown.\n\nThis week added a new clue to the pile: it seems that the Black Hood showed up at Cheryl Blossom’s house to attack her at the same time that Betty was meeting up with her father to confront him. At this point, it’s clear that either Hal was another red herring, or there are two killers on the loose—presumably with different motives. That second option effectively means that multiple fan theories could be right—or possibly none of them, if the killer turns out to be someone no one suspected. (Although then again, pretty much everyone is the subject of one fan theory or another.)\n\nThere are a million possible guesses as to what might be going on—but I’ve got a hunch that regardless of who the killer(s) might be (Hal, Sheriff Keller, Tallboy, Dark Betty, one of the Blossoms), Hiram Lodge has something to do with this whole mess. As Hermione continues her bid for mayor against Fred Andrews, Hiram has been revealed to be funding Archie’s old vigilante group, the Dark Circle, with the intention of stirring up violence and controversy between the South Side and the North Side. What better way to ensure that the chaos consuming Riverdale reaches a fever pitch than to guarantee that the town is also cowering in fear of a serial killer?\n\nWhoever the Black Hood might be, though, Riverdale deserves credit for keeping its secret for so long. Many other dramas, including Westworld, Game of Thrones, and The Walking Dead, have struggled in recent years to stay one step ahead of legions of fans trying to uncover their secrets. And while there’s no shortage of enthusiasm and obsession among Riverdale fans, the writers’ room has weaponized that very hobby against them—planting clues as seeds for theories that will one day sprout into perfect decoys to keep everyone occupied while the real answer remains hidden. Yes, that has played into some of the bloating fans have felt this season, as the series ballooned from a 13-episode first season to 22 installments in its second year—but once that killer is finally unmasked, this is one story arc that feels genuinely ripe for a real payoff.\n\n22 Movies and TV Shows That Will Save Us in 2018\n\n1 / 15\n\nPreviously, On. . .\n\nHallelujah, Riverdale Is Fun Again—and Done Playing Coy About the Black Hood\n\nThe CW drama, which was starting to feel lost midway through its second season, made up for all its stalled plot lines with one perfectly zany episode.\n\nRiverdale\n\nRiverdale’s Musical Episode Will Remind You Why You Love Riverdale\n\nCould there be a better fit than Riverdale and Carrie?\n\nridley moves\n\nRiverdale’s K.J.
