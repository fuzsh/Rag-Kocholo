        "text": "Ann B. Davis made her debut in show business at age 6 earning $2.00 in a puppet show. At the University of Michigan, Ann planned to study medicine but got the acting bug from her brother who was the lead dancer in the national company of \"Oklahoma\" for over a year. Ann then spent six years in little theaters, stock companies, touring musicals, and such until she got her break as \"Schultzie\", the secretary on \"The Bob Cummings Show.\" Before Hollywood, Ann spent a summer at the Cain Park Theater and, during a year at the Erie Playhouse in Erie, Pennsylvania, she studied everything about show production and played dozens of roles ranging from teenagers to characters over 60. In 1949, she arrived at Porterville, California and spent three years at the Barn theater.\n\nShe then moved down the coast to Monterey, where she appeared at the Wharf theater. From there she decided to try Hollywood. Anne has also played many parts on stage including \"The Women\", \"Twelfth Night\", \"Dark Of The Moon\", and others. Her mother, Marguerite Scott Davis, appeared with professional stock companies for over thirty years.\n\nCamille Billops started as a sculptor and painter, became a filmmaker, and amassed a treasure trove of books, documents, and photographs related to black culture.She was born in Los Angeles in 1933 and studied art at the University of Southern California there and later switched to childhood education, the field in which she got her degree in 1960, at California State University.Her putting up her daughter Christa for adoption two years later, because she did not want to be a mother, became a source of controversy, especially when Billops later made a documentary about their reunion.In this period and into the 197os, with a white scholar of black theater in New York City named James V. Hatch who would become her husband, she presided over a 4,000 square feet artistic loft in the Soho neighborhood of that city which served as a hub for collaborations, a salon for musicians and other performers.A grant from the National Endowment for the Arts allowed her and Hatch to record over 1,200 oral histories about black artists.These interviews and the other material she and her husband collected are now houses at Emory University.Billops died in Manhattan on June 1st of 2019.\n\n\"Got a smoke?\" Darwin Joston secured himself a permanent place in cult movie history with that particular laconically witty line as laid-back Death Row-bound convict Napoleon Wilson in John Carpenter's outstanding urban action thriller classic Assault - Anschlag bei Nacht (1976). Wilson was undoubtedly Joston's best role, and he played it with exceptional skill: mellow, low-key and disarmingly casual with a cool sense of dry ironic humor and a wickedly funny way with a sardonic wisecrack. Joston's terrific portrayal of the acidic and fatalistic Wilson should have led to bigger and better things. Alas, it did not.\n\nHe was born as Francis Darwin Solomon on December 9, 1937, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. His parents were Mary Elizabeth Smith and Buford Odell Solomon. Joston attended Glenn High School in Kernersville, North Carolina, where he was considered a talented athlete. Following graduation from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1960, Darwin moved to New York and began acting in stage plays and summer stock productions for about five years in the early to mid 1960s. He then moved to Los Angeles to continue his acting career.\n\nCompared to his substantial starring role in \"Assault on Precinct 13,\" most of Joston's other film parts were relatively small: he's an ill-fated soldier in the dreadful killer snake dud Unternehmen Klapperschlange (1976), a beleaguered pencil-factory clerk in Eraserhead (1977), a drunken truck driver in Von Küste zu Küste (1980), a coroner in the splendidly spooky The Fog: Nebel des Grauens (1980) and a typically relaxed FBI agent in the entertainingly crummy science-fiction/horror hoot Time Walker (1982) (Joston was reunited with his fellow \"Assault on Precinct 13\" cast member Austin Stoker in this latter picture).\n\nJoston also did guest spots on such TV shows as ALF (1986), Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981), Remington Steele (1982), Spenser (1985), Neu im Einsatz (1972), Ein Sheriff in New York (1970), Teufelskreis der Angst (1972), Der Chef (1967), The Rat Patrol (1966), Lassie (1954) (in which he had a recurring role) and Die Leute von der Shiloh Ranch (1962). In addition to his acting credits, Joston worked behind-the-scenes as either a driver or a transportation captain on such features as Hallo, Mr. President (1995), Wild at Heart: Die Geschichte von Sailor und Lula (1990), La Bamba (1987), High-Life am Strand (1987), Zeit der Rache (1985), Zoff in Beverly Hills (1986) and Die Buddy Holly Story (1978).\n\nDarwin Joston died of leukemia on June 1, 1998. Although he's no longer with us, Joston nonetheless will forever live on in our hearts and memories as the supremely amiable, if notorious, killer criminal Napoleon Wilson. \"Anybody got a smoke?\""
