        "text": "Recently watched the movie “If….” (1968) and was struck by actor Richard Warwick; I was sure I’d seen him in something else and sure enough he also appeared in “Nicholas and Alexandra” (1971) and “Sebastiane” (1976) – interestingly, in all 3 films, his character was implied to be or definitely was gay. Later, Warwick played Judi Dench’s brother-in-law in the sitcom “A Fine Romance” (1981-84). I was shocked and saddened to see that he died of AIDS at age 52 in 1997.\n\nThis got me to thinking about lesser-known actors (or writers, athletes, etc.) who died of AIDs. We all remember Rock Hudson, Liberace, Rudolf Nureyev, etc., but who are some of the semi-famous that we lost during the plague years?\n\nLeonard Frey was a gifted comic actor who could do drama as well. He had wonderful timing which I remember best in a Mary Tyler Moore Show episode in which he played the only student who shows up for Ted Baxter's Famous School of Broadcasting.\n\nHe also did a lot of Broadway, with a featured role in the original Fiddler on the Roof and later in the movie.\n\nHe died in 1988 at age 49 of complications from AIDS.\n\nHere's a clip from the MTM episode. He begins at 3:50.\n\n*Peter Evans, 38, May 20, 1989, Versatile actor praised for his lead role in \"Children of a Lesser God\"\n\n*Ian Charleson, 40, January 6, 1990, The Scottish actor who costarred in the 1981 \"Chariots of Fire\"\n\n*Leonard Fray, 49, August 24, 1988, Motel the tailor in the stage and film versions of \"Fiddler on the Roof\"\n\n*Larry Kert, 60, June 5, 1991, The singer and actor who played Tony in Broadway's \"West Side Story\"\n\nCharles Ludlam, 44, May 28, 1987, Actor-playwright-director in his post-absurdist theater of the Ridiculous\n\nCookie Mueller, 40, November 10, 1989, Actress in John Waters's \"Pink Flamingoes\"; Details magazine art critic\n\nLarry Riley, 59, June 6, 1992, The actor who played Frank Williams on CBS's \"Knots Landing\"\n\nCraig Russell, 42, October 30, 1990, Flamboyant entertainer and impersonator of Mae West, Judy Garland\n\nJack Smith, 57, September 18, 1989, Performance artist and maker of the 1963 film \"Flaming Creatures\"\n\nBarry Robins, 41, April 1, 1986, Lead in “Bless the Beasts and the Children”\n\nRémi Laurent, 32, 14 November 1989, the son in 1978 film La Cage aux Folles\n\nThey say Brad Davis got Aids from a needle transfusion ?\n\nShame about drag queen Craig \"Outrageous\" Russell\n\nLarry Kert, with Liza in \"New York New York\"\n\nEnglish actor Ian Charleson was getting well-known and had just played Hamlet before he died. He was very blonde (I saw him on stage a few times).\n\nI actually knew Richard Warwick - slightly, he used to frequent a gay bar (The Colherne - now gone) my gang used to drink in at Earls Court, back in the early 80s, so we got chatting a few times, and almost picked each other up once, but something came up and it didnt happen. He always had his bicycle with him. He was in lots of films around then, and is naked in \"The Breaking of Bumbo\" with the lovely fragrant Joanna Lumley in 1970.\n\nRobert Drivas - interesting young American actor, also naked in \"The Illustrated Man\" with Rod Steiger, and in \"Where Its At\" with David Janssson and DL fave Brenda Vacarro, he also had a small part in \"Cool Hand Luke\".\n\nTony Perkins too.\n\nTOMMY: I have this tradition.\n\nIt's something I do now when a friend dies.\n\nI save his Rolodex card.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do?\n\nThrow it away in the trash can?\n\nI won't do that.\n\nNo, I won't.\n\nThat's too final.\n\nLast year I had five cards.\n\nNow I have 50.\n\nA collection of cardboard tombstones, bound together with a rubber band.\n\nI hate these fuckin' funerals.\n\nI really do.\n\nAnd you know what else I hate?\n\nI hate the memorials.\n\nThat's our social life now.\n\nGoing to these things.\n\nNick was a choreographer.\n\nI don't know if any of you knew that.\n\nHe was just starting out.\n\nHe didn't tell a lot of people.\n\nHe was waiting to invite you to his big debut at Carnegie Hall or some shit so we could all be proud of him.\n\nBut he was so good.\n\nHe had such promise.\n\nWe're losing an entire generation.\n\nYoung men at the beginning.\n\nJust gone.\n\nChoreographers, playwrights, dancers, actors.\n\nAll those plays that won't get written now.\n\nAll those dances never to be danced.\n\nIn closing, I'm just gonna say I'm mad.\n\nI'm fuckin' mad.\n\nI keep screaming inside,\n\n\"Why are they letting us die?\"\n\n\"Why is no one helping us?\"\n\nAnd here's the truth.\n\nHere's the answer.\n\nThey just don't like us.\n\nI don't think anyone's mentioned Kevin Peter Hall:\n\n[quote]Kevin Peter Hall was an actor famous for his roles as Dr. Elvin Lincoln in Misfits of Science (1985), the 'monsters' in Prophecy (1979), Harry and the Hendersons (1987), Predator (1987), and Predator 2 (1990). He also had guest spots on shows like Night Court and Star Trek: The Next Generation. He was frequently cast in monster roles due to his extremely tall stature—he stood 7' 2½\" (2.20 m). His mother stood a top height of 6'2\" and his father stood 6'6.\" He married 227 actress Alaina Reed in 1989 after appearing on the program. In the fall of 1990, Hall was involved in a car accident in Los Angeles and required a blood transfusion, which was later discovered to be contaminated with HIV. He contracted AIDS and died from complications related to the disease shortly afterwards. He and his wife had two children.\n\n[quote]I had no idea Howard E. Rollins died of AIDS. I remember how powerful he was in \"Ragtime\", and he got an Oscar nomination for that, and I thought he'd have an amazing career thereafter.\n\nIt was sad. I remember Carrol O'Connor tried to save his job for him but he was on another planet. He started going out on location wearing a wig and women's clothes.\n\nIn contrast to his buttoned-down image on CBS' In the Heat of the Night, Rollins sometimes wore a long, startling wig of dreadlocks when he cruised the North Georgia roads last year in his maroon 1993 Lincoln Mark VIII.\n\n[quote]Rollins was arrested three times in eight months for DUI, reckless driving and speeding, leading to jail time and intensive treatment for substance abuse. If he returns to Covington, 30 miles east of Atlanta where filming started April 28 for the seventh season of Heat of the Night, he will be arrested and almost certainly jailed.\n\n[quote'It's a terrible curse,' Heat star Carroll O'Connor has said of what he calls his friend and co-star's substance-abuse problems. He's one of the sweetest, gentlest men I know, and one of the most gifted actors,' O'Connor told a small group of TV writers in Los Angeles earlier this year. 'I want to preserve him.'\n\nR205- Lenny Baker had to withdraw from the pre-Broadway tryout of McNally's \"It's Only A Play\" before it played Philadelphia, where it closed. The critics HATED it.\n\nThe \"official\" story back then was cancer of the throat caused by his inexperience as a singer in \"A Love My Wife\", which is the lousiest cover story I'd ever heard. Those who knew Lenny knew it was AIDS, and he lost many of those people from his life because it was early in the plague years. He was treated like a leper until his death.\n\nOur town was rocked when one of the leading businessmen went into rehab, and this was back when rehab was a big deal. Everyone said, \"I never knew Harry had a drinking problem. I never saw him drink more than 2 or 3 drinks.\"\n\nWell that was true. Harry was very careful to never have more than those 2 or 3 drinks. The trouble was that he would leave the office about 4 and have a couple at the VFW, a couple at the Legion, a couple at the country club and so on, so that by the time he rolled home about 7:30 he was flying high.\n\nR237, it just occurred to me today that the onset of AIDS and it's mysterious and sudden tragic effects are just as fresh/old in our minds as the devastation of the WWII holocaust was in the minds of Jews back in 1975 (as Bette Midler would let us know in her stage act, when talking about visiting Germany, right around then).\n\nThough I don't mean to compare two very different world disasters, I figured if the memory of the World Wars was kept alive for so long, even after certain nations had become our allies, something similar can be done with the AIDS crisis years.\n\n[quote]The worst offender, may he rest in peace...herb ritts. they still claim he only died of pneumonia and the dust from shooting out in the dessert, total croak of crap.\n\nI googled this and his publicist did say this to gay press soon after Ritts' death: \"Herb was HIV-positive, but this particular pneumonia was not PCP (pneumocystis pneumonia), a common opportunistic infection of AIDS. But at the end of the day, his immune system was compromised.\"\n\nI doubt his HIV-status when he died is secret to anyone. I remember telling my photography teacher soon after Ritts' death that it was because of AIDS so I had read about it pretty soon after. I'm not denying the publicist downplayed the cause of death, though. I haven't read about the dust thing. It's sad if someone is doing that but I doubt it's his Foundation or his publicist?\n\nR267 I don't think so. Some people do get brain tumors in their 50s - and its a pretty swift decline. It does happen.\n\nFunny but when I first read the press release on Dr. Brandt, his publicist said an \"illness \" and didn't specify, and the first thing I thought was geez in this day and age people are still trying to cover up AIDS?\n\nSpeaking of, how is Hal Rubenstein still alive? I thought he had been living with AIDS for 20 years, but it's 30, which is a huge difference. How did he survive from 85 to 90 alone? And he still looks healthy.\n\n-- Theodore \"Teddy\" Wilson (appeared on tons of sitcoms and TV shows in the 70s and 80s, esp. What’s Happening and Sanford and Son)\n\n-- Larry Riley was in “A Soldier’s Story” and was fired from Knots Landing for having aids\n\n-- Michael Westphal, ATP tennis player (ranked in the top 50)\n\n-- Joel Crothers (“Somerset”, “Edge of Night”) went to his grave denying he was gay and denying he had aids. To this day, his IMDB bio still insists he was engaged to soap actress Veleka Grey at the time of his death and the cause was “cancer”\n\n-- Brad O’Hare (“Guiding Light”, “Longtime Companion”)\n\n-- James Raitt (brother of Bonnie), Broadway musical director\n\n-- Denholm Elliott (“A Room With A View”)\n\n-- Ilka Tanya Payan (Telenovelas + “Scarface”, “Hill Street Blues”)\n\n-- Joe Megna (Dill in “To Kill A Mockingbird”)\n\n-- Leonard Frey (“Fiddler On The Roof”)\n\n-- Merritt Butrick (Captain Kirk’s son on “Star Trek”)\n\nBTW, I lived through this in the 1980s. Almost nobody actually died from AIDS. However, lots and lots of men in their 30s and 40s died unusually young from cancer or pneumonia :P A high school friend, a talent musician, died of aids. I was an active member of our alumni association and he passed shortly before a reunion. We decided we’d start a scholarship fund in his honor. When I called his family to let them know we were going to have a tribute, I was referred to his brother. I did not mention that I knew the cause of death, but as were reminiscing I said something like, “its so hard to see so many people dying so young” and his response was, “we’re still in shock. You know he died of LEG CANCER which is so unusual”. Either the family was in full denial or they were trying to cover it up. Either way, I thought it was tragic.\n\nI also appeared in a successful Off Broadway production in the ‘80s. It had a cast of 10 men and 2 women. Of the men, I’m one of only 3 cast-members who was still alive in the 1990s.\n\n[quote]This is heresy but \"We'll Take a Glass Together\" has always annoyed me. I find it too cutesy for words.\n\nAgreed! I thought the whole show godawful at the time. I went with this very smart theater friend of mine who leaned over and whispered after the big opening number where you meet all the characters, \"The whole house will come down when the little dying Jewish man does his big \"To Life!\" number then drops dead, somewhere in act 2\". And boy, did they! It's just a dopey show, in my opinion.\n\n[quote] Was Anthony Perkins truly gay or just confused. I\n\nHe was gay and eccentric. He wanted children, so he convinced himself he was bisexual and married Berry Berenson, whose proper name later became Berry Berenson, Wdow of Anthony Perkins, Who Died on American Airlines Flight 11 in the World Trade Center Attack.\n\nI'm sure they liked each other a lot. They seemed to get along famously. People have all kinds of different personal relationships. Look at the Clintons. Who knows what's up with that marriage, but they support each other and that's that.\n\nI just found this post online regarding Dennis Parker (Wade Nichols):\n\n[quote] Dennis and I were friends from the early 80s until his death. We met when he did some fundraising via Edge of Night for the nonprofit animal welfare organization I worked for. We became good friends and spent a lot of time together, He and his partner and my husband and I socialized frequently.....he even helped my husband build bookshelves and a window seat in our apartment. Dennis was one of the sweetest, kindest people I have ever Known. He definitely did NOT commit suicide, but died of AIDS, which was still very much a stigma in 1985. I went through his illness with him and was with him the day before he passed away. He was a dear friend, and I miss him to this day. - Susan Brooks\n\nThis is quite a revelation because that suicide rumor has been floating around the internet for as long as I can remember. It's even been posted as FACT on some legitimate sites I've seen.\n\nthis thread is so sad\n\nI came of age in the early 80s and hung onto the closet door with both hands super tight\n\nI thought you didn't even have to have sex to get AIDS; you'd just develop it, triggered by the gay gene already in your body\n\nI'm lucky to be alive; timing is everything, if I'd been born 5 years earlier...who knows?\n\nI'm lucky to have had any intimacy in life.\n\n[quote]For years, I thought that Keene Curtis died of AIDS. I just checked his bio, and it says he died of Alzheimers. I knew him in the 70s and early 80s. He was a very sexy man.\n\nOoh, you should see what Robby Benson has to say about Queen Curtis in his autobiography. They were in \"The Rothschilds\" together when Robby was 13-14. Apparently Keene was always bugging him for sex, promising to give him a blowjob if Robby would suck his dick too. Robby has nothing good to say about him and clearly regarded him as a child molester (Robby never took him up on the offer). He doesn't mention him by name, but calls him a much older, Tony-winning actor in the show. Later on he speaks of what a good man Hal Linden was and how much he admires hm, so it's clearly not Linden. That leaves Curtis, who won the Tony for \"The Rothschilds\"\n\nRe: r341\n\n[quote]It's tempting to turn this man's incredible story into a camp snapshot, a tawdry tale of the externalities of showbiz. The reality is probably much more complex. Born Dennis Posa in Long Island, our struggling auteur co-opted the name Wade Nichols in the mid-70's when he started doing skinflicks, initially gay and then seguing exclusively into straight porn. In 1978, Parker was introduced to Jacques Morali, the producer and impresario responsible for the Village People, the Ritchie Family, Eartha Kitt during her disco kick (did you know Bruce Vilanch was a co-writer of 'Where Is My Man'??) and various studio groups of the time. Morali and Parker allegedly became lovers and teamed up for Parker's one and only LP, 'Like an Eagle', released in 1979 on Casablanca Records, the infamous Los Angeles label run by cocaine-crazed Neil Bogart. (For more on Casablanca check out Larry Harris' book 'And Party Every Day' for the inside story of this wildly dysfunctional but highly productive label). In 1979, Parker/Nichols became a regular cast member on 'The Edge of Night', appearing for five years as Police Chief, Derek Mallory. Remarkably, ABC never found out about Parker's double life, (of if they did, excused it as an excess of the times) despite the fact that his XXX films continued to be released as late as 1983. It seems unlikely that he continued shooting them after the Edge contract began but was probably ending up on VHS formats of 16mm reels he had shot earlier. In 1984, Parker died, whether from a self-inflicted gunshot wound (a rumor) or complications from AIDS.\n\n[quote]Parker styled himself as the quintessential clone of the period; a mustachioed, uber-male strapped into tight, silver spandex jumpsuits and was obviously at ease sexually with both genders. Perhaps someone will write a more elaborated biography about this strange character, who appeared on the Merv Griffin Show during the late '70s, and slept with many of the hottest men of the era (you can find some of their comments on YouTube and DiscoMusic.com). Notably, Parker must have had an influence on the quality of the tunes as both singles are co-written by him and stand out in Morali's pantheon for being slower and more thoughtful than the majority of his releases of the period. His work for the Ritchie Family was all over the map with LP's like 'African Queens' rating quite high and ones like 'American Generation' quite low."
