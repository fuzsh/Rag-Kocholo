        "text": "ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Mark Trumbo homered twice, going 4 for 4 with four RBIs, and Garrett Richards pitched seven innings for his first major league victory, leading the Los Angeles Angels to a 6-1 win over the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night.\n\nTorii Hunter also went deep to back Richards (1-0), who allowed a run and four hits, walked two and struck out eight against an offense that averaged 9.2 runs over its previous six games -- including a 21-8 rout at Texas last Wednesday.\n\nThe 24-year-old right-hander allowed only one hit through the first 4 2-3 innings -- a leadoff homer by Michael Richards in the third. Garrett Richards was filling in for ace Jered Weaver, who is on the disabled list with a lower back strain.\n\nBlake Beavan (3-5) pitched five innings and gave up six runs on 10 hits in five innings, including all three homers. It was the third time in 26 big league starts that the right-hander allowed three in one game, including consecutive home starts last August against Boston and Toronto.\n\nTrumbo, who raised his average to .337, opened the scoring with a first-pitch drive over the center-field wall. Two pitches later, Hunter sent his sixth of the season over the bullpen fence in left, giving the Angels consecutive homers for the first time this season.\n\nThe Angels increased their lead to 4-1 in the bottom half with RBI singles by Albert Pujols and Trumbo, who made it 6-1 in the fifth with another towering homer to center on an 0-2 pitch after Pujols doubled. Only one other time this season had an Angels player homered twice in a game -- Kendrys Morales did it in Monday's series opener.\n\nTrumbo's four hits tied a career high. He also did it May 17 against the Chicago White Sox at Anaheim.\n\nAngels catcher Bobby Wilson, who was replaced by a pinch-hitter on Monday after getting struck in the facemask by a foul tip, was placed on the seven-day concussion DL. Wilson went on the 15-day DL in April 2010 with a concussion, after a bone-jarring collision with the Yankees' Mark Teixeira at home plate -- a play that also resulted in a sprained left ankle in Wilson's first big league start behind the plate.\n\nNotes: Weaver took part in long-toss drills before batting practice. ... Former Mariners GM Hal Keller died in his sleep early Tuesday at age 84 after a battle with esophageal cancer. He joined Seattle's front office as director of player development before becoming GM for three years, and later scouted for the Angels. Keller also helped introduce the radar gun to the majors while working in the Rangers organization. ... Seattle RF Ichiro Suzuki was 0 for 4 and is hitless in three straight games for the first time since a three-game stretch last July. ... C Hank Conger was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake to fill Wilson's roster spot. ... The Angels, who lost their picks in the first and second round of the draft to St. Louis and Texas after signing Pujols and fellow free agent C.J. Wilson last December, finally got their chance in the third round and selected RHP R.J. Alvarez from Florida Atlantic University. ... The Mariners have homered in seven straight games, their longest streak since an 11-game stretch in August 2009."
