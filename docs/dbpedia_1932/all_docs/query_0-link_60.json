Lausten. She preceded him in death on July 20, 2011.\n\nHe was a member of the Community Seventh Day Adventist Church in Monterey.\n\nLewis John Thomas was adopted immediately after his birth by his grandparents, James and Pearl May Allen Thomas. They raised him as one of their own children. He became the adored “baby brother” to Lucy (called Toots), Helen and Hazel. At the time of his birth, James and Pearl had an older daughter, Gladys, and a son, Paul “Ted” Thomas, who were already married .\n\nThe only time he left the farm in Winamac was to serve in the Korean War in the early 1950s.\n\nSome members of the family call him Lewie or Lewie John and others call him Johnny.\n\nLewie grew up surrounded by love and guided by a mother, Pearl May Thomas, who instilled a deep love for Jesus in his heart. Hazel told the story how she and Lewie would spend hours preaching to their dolls about Jesus.\n\nLewie’s heart was to study for full-time ministry, but his father, James Thomas, needed him to live at home and help with the farm. Without a word of complaint, Lewie accepted this calling to stay on the farm and serve the Lord in this humble manner.\n\nHis entire life became his ministry. He faithfully took care of the farm and was even farming until just a few weeks ago. He was planning to bring in his fall harvest.\n\nBesides being a faithful son, a devoted husband to Frances and a loving brother and uncle, Lewie served in his church. He was the first to visit the sick, offer a ride to the disabled and pray for those who needed prayer.\n\nNo one exemplified the gracious and tender compassions of Christ more than Lewis John Thomas.\n\nWhen Frances became weak and could no longer be out of bed, Lewie never considered putting her in a nursing home. Until her final breath, he fed her, loved her and cared for her in a manner that is rarely seen today. When she no longer recognized him, he’d sit lovingly by her side, smile and gently remind her of where she was. This truly was the love of Christ flowing through him.\n\nOne scripture comes to mind when thinking of Lewis John Thomas:\n\nMatthew 25:21: Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things…Enter into the joy of your Lord. [New King James Version]\n\nSurvivors include several nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, James and Pearl May Allen Thomas; his wife, Frances M.
