        "text": "In 2012, a quiet, middle-aged man named Peter Keller brutally murdered his family and vlogged about the ordeal before retreating into his self-made bunker deep in the forests of the Pacific Northwest.\n\n41-year-old Peter Keller was a keen survivalist who regularly vlogged about his escapades and interests in survivalism, and for years on end had been quietly preparing a sanctuary to which he would eventually retreat from the world. He stockpiled the bunker and filled it with equipment necessary to wait out whatever global disaster may happen to strike. Inside the Rattlesnake Ridge Bunker, Keller had his ammunition, weapons, a bulletproof vest, and enough food to survive a nuclear winter.\n\nPeter had been described as reserved and introverted but was generally considered pleasant by all those who knew him. He grew up surrounded by nature in a small North Bend town. Like most of the men he grew up with, Peter settled down, got married, and had a child.\n\nPeter married the equally unassuming Lynnettee Keller, and the pair had a daughter named Kaylene. The family had an ordinary life, by all accounts, residing in a typical suburban home with few reports of conflicts or hostilities. Little did their friends and family know that something in Peter Keller was brewing beneath the surface, which was entirely deadly."
