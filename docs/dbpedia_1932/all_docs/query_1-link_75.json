        "text": "The Minnesota native spent five-plus decades serving his alma mater\n\nLAKELAND, Fla. - The Sunshine State Conference joins the entire Florida Southern College campus community in mourning the loss of former Director of Athletics Hal Smeltzly, who passed away on Friday at the age of 86. A Minnesota native, Smeltzly first stepped on campus in 1950 as a student and would spend the next five-plus decades serving his alma mater. After playing baseball and basketball for the Moccasins, Smeltzly signed a professional baseball contract and was drafted into the United States Army in 1953.\n\nFollowing his military service, Smeltzly returned to the baseball diamond and continued his education at Florida Southern, graduating in 1957. He was hired as the head baseball coach in 1958 and built the Mocs into a perennial national powerhouse. Smeltzly led the Moccasins to NCAA Division II National Championships in 1971, 1972, and 1975, as well as six regional titles.\n\nAfter retiring from coaching in 1976, he would go on to serve as the director of athletics from 1978-2000 and helped transform Florida Southern into one of the premier athletic programs in the country. Under his guidance, the Moccasins claimed 22 national championships during his time as athletic director and finished as high as fourth in the Learfield Directors' Cup standings on two different occasions. He also served as a member of the FSC Board of Trustees following his retirement from the athletic department.\n\nSmeltlzy was also instrumental in the addition of women's athletics to the college in 1976 and was one of the founding members of the Sunshine State Conference. A two-time national Coach of the Year on the baseball diamond, Smeltzly also served as a member of the NCAA Division II Rules Committee for nearly two decades and was heavily involved with USA Baseball. He was instrumental in the addition of baseball as a medal sport in the Olympics and coached Team USA to second-place finishes at the 1972 World Amateur Tournament and 1975 Pan-Am Games.\n\nA member of seven different Halls of Fame, Smeltzly was inducted into the Florida Southern College Athletics Hall of Fame in 2002 and was named as the NCAA Division II All-Time Coach on the 30th anniversary of DII baseball in 1997. He is also a member of the SSC Hall of Fame (1997) and the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame (1980). His uniform, number 7, is one of eight to be retired at Florida Southern.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his wife, Sylvia, whom he met while both were students at Florida Southern and married in 1952. He is survived by three daughters, Debra Lee (Greg), Lora Jaye (Michael) and Sara Louise (Jim). He was also a very proud grandfather to his three granddaughters, Elizabeth Lee (Humphries) Keller, Chloe Annie Michaela Finch and Lily Meloy Tess Finch. He also is survived by his nephews Robert Sexton and Stuart Smeltzly and niece Valerie Smeltzly.\n\nCondolences may be sent to the family at www.heathfuneralchapel.com. Please check that site for notification of a memorial service which will be scheduled at a later date."
