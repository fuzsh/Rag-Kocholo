        "text": "Hal shares the power of habit and discipline based on his international bestseller The Miracle Morning which sold over 2.5 million copies, went viral and inspired an online movement.\n\nHal’s simple (but not-obvious) morning routine went viral and inspired a global movement. To-date, the book has sold 2.5 million copies, it’s been translated into 19 languages, and it has inspired a complete series of additional books that apply the Miracle Morning philosophy to the specific needs of salespeople, entrepreneurs, marketers, teachers, students, couples, families as well as those suffering from depression or addiction.\n\nIn his book and with audiences, Hal explains why every day should begin early—with a ritual focused not on what the world wants from you—but on what you need to become the person you were meant to be. With the goal of waking people up to their full potential, Hal shares his own powerful “wake up moments”—the accident and, more recently, his battle with acute lymphoblastic leukemia—as well as his proven formula for creating extraordinary results in life. With his unique blend of inspiration, stand-up-comedy-style humor, and powerful storytelling, Hal Elrod helps people become the engine of change in their own lives—one “miracle morning” at a time.\n\nHal Elrod died at the age of 20. He was hit head-on by a drunk driver going 70-miles-per-hour, died for six minutes, broke 11 bones, lay in a coma for six days, suffered permanent brain damage and was told he would never walk again. He went on to become an ultra-marathon runner, a Hall of Fame business achiever, a record-breaking sales representative, national champion sales manager, world-renown success coach, and the #1 international best-selling author of The Miracle Morning: The Not-So-Obvious Secret Guaranteed to Transform Your Life (Before 8 AM)."
