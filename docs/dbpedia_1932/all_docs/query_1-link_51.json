        "text": "Hal Glenn Call, 80, passed away suddenly in Idaho Falls at EIRMC on Thursday, November 14, 2013, Hal Glenn Call, 80 years old, a righteous man of faith and compassion, slipped from this mortal existence unexpectedly, November 14, 2013, in Idaho Falls close to his birthplace and childhood home in Ammon, Idaho. On October 16, 1933, Hal arrived after a difficult birth that nearly took his mother's life. He was the third child and first son born to Elsie Viola Ellingford and Glenn Call. Because it was in the middle of the Great Depression, Hal's childhood experiences shaped his value system and his philosophy of life. He learned how to work, to defend himself from the neighborhood bullies, and follow his parents' examples of courage and sacrifice. He remembered the attack on Pearl Harbor, but couldn't understand why all the attention was on the radio because December 7, 1941, was the day he was baptized! He learned love of country when he walked with his father, hand in hand into Idaho Falls so his father, a former Marine, could sign up for the war effort. In spite of the war, Hal's childhood was adventuresome. He always had a horse to ride and a dog by his side. He chatted with the Italian prisoners of war who worked on the farms, although this was forbidden. As he grew older, sports became very important to him. He excelled in basketball and football, many times playing both offense and defense in the same game. An offer to play football at Utah State was ruined when he injured his knee in the last game of the year. Hal moved to Pocatello and began delivering milk for Cream Top Dairy. After several years he had the good fortune to join the Pocatello Fire Department in March 1956. In 1963 he was promoted to captain. During this year he met and courted Sharon Lee Swisher. They were married December 7, 1963, in Pocatello, Idaho. On June 3, 1964, they were sealed in the Idaho Falls Temple. In 1967 he was promoted to battalion chief. When he was appointed fire chief in 1975, it became his job to supervise the fire department's fire and ambulance service, initiating the first paramedic service to Pocatello. During his career, which began at age 22, he battled numerous fires that made the headlines. Hal had fond feelings for the department and the men and women who worked with him. \"Any success I have had during my tenure, I credit to a dedicated staff of officers,\" he once said. After his retirement, his next challenge was that of deputy state fire marshal, covering one third of the state of Idaho. When he decided to retire from this position, his next job was to take his father-in-law, Eddie Swisher, hunting and fishing, attending Pocatello High School athletic events, and traveling with his family. In May, 1980, Hal, Sharon, and two of their children, Rick and Keva, traveled to England, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, visiting family in England, and meeting people in Germany where Rick had recently served in the Dusseldorf German mission. This began a lifelong love of travel with Hal and Sharon seeing the sights with dear friends in Greece, Egypt, Israel, and Jordan. When Sharon retired from her position as an English teacher at Pocatello High School, the couple received a mission call to the Fort Worth, Texas mission. They had a glorious time with the young people at the LDS Institute of Religion. Hal was one hot ping pong player and pool shark! The students adored him and the little twinkle in his eye as he waxed them once again. In October, 2006, Hal and Sharon accepted a mission call to the Ghana Accra Mission to the shock and amazement of family and friends. What an adventure it was to live in the bush with unreliable cell phone connection, sporadic electricity, and few grocery stores in that part of the jungle. But the loving members of the Church watched over them in their little orange/hot pink sherbet house, and kept them safe. Hal and Sharon truly loved their brothers and sisters in Ghana. After returning to Pocatello, they expressed gratitude for this country and all of its blessings. Clean water, reliable electricity, excellent roads, highways, and freeways, well trained police, fire and ambulance service, doctors, hospitals, schools and so much more. Never would they take this country for granted. Hal was a faithful member of the LDS Church, dedicated to serving to the best of his ability. His service included stake mission president, bishop's counselor, bishop, high counselor, high priest group, youth callings, stake public affairs director, full-time missionary, and was currently serving as an ordinance worker in the Idaho Falls Temple. Hal and Sharon have two living children, Rick Call (Kari), and Keva Walker (Rulon), five grandchildren, Kasey Call (Sarah), Jake Call, Kelsey Call, Elise Walker, and Jason Walker, one great-grandson, Talmadge Stone Call. He is also survived by his sister Darlene (Boyd) Cherry, brothers Karl E. Call (Maria) and Daniel P. Call (Iris), numerous nieces, nephews, golfing buddies, fire department brothers, and acquaintances. Hal was preceded in death by his parents, Glenn and Elsie Call, his wife's parents, Edward and Rachel Swisher, a son, Randall Lynn Call, and a sister, Bonnie Anderson. A viewing will be held on Thursday, November 21, from 6-8 p.m. at the Colonial Funeral Home, 2005 South Fourth Avenue, Pocatello, ID. Funeral services will be at the Highland Third Ward, 2300 Butte Street, Friday, November 22, at 11 a. m. with Bishop Ted Schow conducting. Prior to the funeral there will be viewing from 10:00-10:45 a.m. at the church. Concluding services will be at the Mountain View Cemetery. Condolences may be sent to the family online at www.colonial-funeralhome.com. In lieu of flowers the family suggests a memorial in Hal's name for the LDS Church Perpetual Education Fund, PEF.LDS.org. or other appropriate organizations. Safe journey, my love, and Happy Fiftieth Wedding Anniversary!"
