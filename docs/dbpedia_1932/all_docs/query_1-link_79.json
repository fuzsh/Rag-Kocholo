Kemp OD, age 83, of White Pigeon, passed away Thursday, May 18, 2023 at Rose Arbor Place in Kalamazoo.\n\nHe was born March 26, 1940 in Coldwater, son of the late Max Dale and Vesta (Bates) Kemp.\n\nDr. Kemp came to Sturgis in 1967 moving to Klinger Lake in 1978.\n\nOn August 11, 1962 he married Jane Louise Koehler at Coldwater Lake in Coldwater. She preceded him in death December 3, 2017.\n\nHal was a partner at Eye Care West with Jeff Nasser in Sturgis for many years.\n\nHe was a longtime member of Ducks Unlimited and Pheasants Forever. Hal was an avid waterfowl and upland bird hunter and he enjoyed hunting and training many retrievers throughout the years.\n\nHal was gifted in the art of woodcarving finding great joy in carving hundreds of decoys over the years. Anyone who had the opportunity to see one of his finished decoys would immediately recognize just how meticulous and detail focused he was. His best friend, Dave DeHaven, described him as a “decoy carving fanatic”.\n\nHal was proud to have served his country in the U.S. Army, earning the rank of Captain.\n\nHe is survived by his children: Kathy (Turner) Wood of Chattanooga, Tennessee, Max D. Kemp and Brian R. Kemp both of White Pigeon; grandchildren: Charlie (Stephanie) Wood of Chattanooga, Tennessee, Bailey (fiancée Justice Roshala) Wood of San Diego, and Tyson (SarahJane) Kemp of Grand Rapids; great grandchildren: Amelia and Phoebe Kemp; sisters: Sharron Grinwis of Kalamazoo and his twin-sister: Carolyn (Edwin) Smith of Franklin, Tennessee and several nieces and nephews.\n\nIn accordance with family wishes cremation has taken place. The family will receive friends from 11:30 to 1:00 P.M. Tuesday June 13th at the Rosenberg Chapel of Hackman Family Funeral Homes, 807 E. Chicago Rd. in Sturgis. Burial of the remains will take place at the Oak Grove Cemetery in Coldwater.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family suggests memorial donations be directed to Centricare Rose Arbor Place, 5473 Croyden Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49009 or Pheasants Forever, Inc., 1783 Buerkle Circle, St. Paul, MN 55110 or Ducks Unlimited, Inc., One Waterfowl Way, Memphis, TN 38120.\n\nWe encourage relatives and friends to share memories and condolences at www.hackmanfamilyfuneralhomes.com."
