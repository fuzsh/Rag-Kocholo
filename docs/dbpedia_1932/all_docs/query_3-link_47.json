        "text": "Our family is just broken hearted to say that we lost our most precious David Alexander John Hagerman on Friday March 5th, due to a tragic truck accident. We are beyond grief as we contemplate living the rest of our lives without our dear sweet son. David is such a generous loving man, who would do anything for anyone, sharing his multitude of talents to help everyone out who he knew.\n\nDavid loves his two older sweet sisters, Carrie Jane Hagerman (Sherman Su) and Laura Elizabeth Keller (Hal Keller) and he adores his two wonderful nephews, John Michael Keller and Logan Edward Keller. His numerous aunts and uncles love him so. Murray and Dilys, as his parents, have been gloriously treated to 33 years of joy and love, and today we just can’t imagine that we will not be sharing his joys and accomplishments as he was to proceed through life.\n\nHe has some very dear friends in his life, many of them whom he has known since childhood, and he often shared with us the fun he would have with them; you know who you are and thank you for being dear friends with our boy. David particularly enjoyed sharing his days with his girlfriend Shawna Groleau; they were soul-mates in so many ways.\n\nThrough David’s young years, he excelled in soccer, usually as the goal-keeper and this sport kept him consumed most days for over 10 years, where he played competitive soccer in the Ottawa area, and training in the USA during summers. He, along with four others, formed a rock band in their teen years and played at the Corel Centre as they opened for a major band competition.\n\nBeing 6’4”, David could be seen in a crowd, and he always had a big smile on his face, and hugs for everyone. His work ethic is strong, as all employers can attest, and he gives it his all at work. Always supporting his work colleagues, they can count on him to lend a hand to make another person’s day better.\n\nOur lives are filled with such happy, proud moments, and our homes are filled with cement and wood projects he made for us all over the years.\n\nDavid would want, I think, that each of you take care of others in your day to day living, and to be kind, as he was to each of those he knew. His legacy for our family is big loving, big hugs, big smiles, and wanting to make each of our days better.\n\nBless you, our dear sweet boy, David. Our lives are so empty without you.\n\nA Celebration of David's life will be held at a later date due to covid, notification will be posted on Facebook."
