Hal Keller was “one of the smartest Baseball Men I have ever know,” such are the words of Mariners President Chuck Armstrong upon learning today that the former Mariners General Manager died at his home in Sequim.

According to Tracy Ringolsby, the Hall of Fame baseball writer who covered the Mariners in the early 1980s and remained close to Keller, Keller had been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer.

Ringolsby, now an analyst for ROOT SPORTS Rockies telecasts, and columnist with FOXSPORTS.com, posted a remembrance of Keller.

Armstrong says Keller taught him a lot about baseball, “He epitomized the ‘essence’ of being a Baseball Person.”

Keller was 84. According to Ringolsby, there will be memorial services for Keller in his native Maryland and his adopted home of Sequim in six to eight weeks.

The family also suggests that donations may be made in Keller’s name to:

Volunteer Hospice of Clallam County

540 E. 8th St.

Port Angeles, WA 98362.
