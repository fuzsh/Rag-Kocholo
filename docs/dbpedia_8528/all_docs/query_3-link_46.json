        "text": "Rishi Sunak was given a grave warning by David Cameron's former aide Craig Oliver that his time in office was \"over\" with the Prime Minister's \"own MPs tramping the dirt down\" on his \"political coffin\".\n\nIn a sensational attack, Mr Oliver - former director of politics and communications at No 10 - laid bare the perceived failings of Mr Sunak, who has continued to fight fires since being chosen as Conservative Party leader last year.\n\nOther controversies in the past years since Boris Johnson led the Tories to a landslide General Election victory back in 2019 were also cited as reasons why the Conservative Party will likely struggle when the country next goes to the polls, Mr Oliver claimed.\n\nWriting in Politics Home, Mr Oliver - who left the Government in 2016 after the Brexit referendum - said \"partygate and the disastrous handling of the economy by Liz Truss were noticed by the electorate\" and that there is \"no sign that they will shift back\".\n\nREAD MORE: Stark poll shows Tory fightback rests on gripping immigration\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest Politics news\n\nJoin us on WhatsApp\n\nOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

Polls can and have been wrong in the past. But they have never been that wrong.\n\n\"Sunak is reduced to hoping that something will turn up. That thing will have to be something so extraordinary it is almost impossible to imagine.\"\n\nThe advisor noted the perilous divisions for Mr Sunak were no more apparent than around his party's attempts to deal with the small boats.\n\nDon't miss...\n\nWe are moving forward with tax cuts to create a brighter future for all [LATEST]\n\nRishi Sunak faces fresh by-election nightmare after Peter Bone ousted as MP [INSIGHT]\n\nRishi Sunak promises to 'move on' from high taxes in vision for Britain [ANALYSIS]\n\nWith opposition coming up against his proposals, and despite narrowly finding enough back for the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill earlier this month, Mr Sunak \"made it the be all and the end all... turning it into a test of his Government’s virility\".\n\nThe plan was voted through by Parliament on December 12, with 313 MPs voting for the legislation with 269 in opposition.\n\nThe victory for Mr Sunak meant the Rwanda proposal's journey continues, though the Prime Minister will no doubt face further backlash next month when the Commons hears the third reading of the bill.\n\nAnd while the chaos continues to swirl around Mr Sunak and his tenure, Mr Oliver believes Labour \"look vaguely sensible\" when the backdrop of the current Conservatives' plight is considered.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
