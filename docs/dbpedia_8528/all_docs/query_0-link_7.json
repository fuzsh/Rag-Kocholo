        "text": "A Tory MP says a former aide to David Cameron declined a request to answer questions about what the ex-PM knew about last year's Trident missile test.\n\nJulian Lewis asked Sir Craig Oliver to appear before the Defence Committee to discuss reports a missile veered off course, amid claims it was hushed up.\n\nThe MP said the ex-journalist declined, saying he had been working on the EU referendum at the time of the test.\n\nMinisters have not confirmed or denied anything went wrong with the test.\n\nThe government has said it will not divulge \"operational details\" of what happened during the test but has insisted it has \"absolute confidence\" in the UK's Trident system.\n\nFormer defence minister Lord West told MPs he had been led to believe there had been a \"minor hiccough\" with the missile's automated communications system and it had been prematurely ditched into the ocean as a precaution.\n\nMr Cameron was still prime minister when the test was conducted shortly before the EU referendum and Mr Lewis has been pressing for details about what he and his staff knew about it.\n\nThe Times claimed , externalon Tuesday that the Obama administration had asked Mr Cameron not to reveal details of the test. It cited sources which it said had told the paper the missile had successfully fired but encountered problems with its US-supplied software.\n\n\"Yesterday I told the House in good faith that Sir Craig Oliver vehemently denies he or any other member of David Cameron's media team ever knew about the aborted Trident test last June,\" he told MPs.\n\n\"He had said that to my parliamentary office staff in terms bordering on rudeness.\n\n\"However, when he was invited to appear before the defence committee today, he told the committee clerk that he did not wish to attend as he said he had left No 10 to work for the Remain campaign before the test firing took place.\"\n\nA spokesman for the former prime minister has said suggestions that his media advisers were involved in a cover-up over the test or had suggested one were \"entirely false\"."
