        "text": "LONDON — It's one of the hands a U.K. prime minister can always play — even on their way out the door.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Theresa May rewarded her closest political allies and a long list of advisers under a patronage system offered to outgoing prime ministers.\n\nDespite joking in the past that a similar appointment by her predecessor, David Cameron, made her \"retch,\" May followed prime ministerial tradition and proposed a list of resignation honors.\n\nMay's former chief of staff Gavin Barwell and his deputy JoJo Penn are off to the House of Lords and aides Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, her previous joint chiefs of staff who resigned after the disastrous 2017 election, were made Commanders of the British Empire (CBE), an award which is traditionally given to people who have made a notable contribution in a particular field.\n\nSeparately, former U.K. Ambassador to Washington Kim Darroch, who resigned after leaked cables critical of Donald Trump's administration caused a diplomatic rift with the U.S. president, is also set to join the House of Lords as a crossbench peer, as part of an independent appointment process, Downing Street said in a statement.\n\nTory Vice Chairman David Brownlow, May's former political secretary, Stephen Parkinson, and former Special Adviser Liz Sanderson have also been nominated by the former prime minister as Tory peers. May's nominations also included Simon Woolley, the founder and director of Operation Black Vote, and Ruth Hunt, former chief executive of the gay rights charity Stonewall.\n\nSome choices, most notably Oliver Robbins, who negotiated the former prime minister's Brexit deal in Brussels and is widely criticized by Brexiteers, will prove controversial. Robbins, who has been given the diplomatic honor KCMG, is set to join Goldman Sachs after he leaves the civil service.\n\nMay, a keen cricket fan, didn't miss the opportunity to knight her cricketing hero, former England opening batsman Geoffrey Boycott, and made former cricket captain Andrew Strauss an Order of the British Empire."
