        "text": "Poor Craig Oliver, the prime minister's head of communications. He did not know the camera was still running while lecturing Norman Smith, the BBC's chief political correspondent, on his interpretation of developments in the Leveson inquiry.\n\nThe anthropology is fascinating. Oliver stabs his fingers and talks a lot. Smith, highly experienced and highly regarded, a BBC man for decades and thus accustomed to flak, barely moves a face muscle, coughs every now and then, and says much less, but enough to put up a decent point by point defence. For fans of the era of high gothic spin, it will be a mild disappointment – there is not even any swearing.\n\nBut there is still plenty to enjoy. Oliver was at the BBC before he went to work for David Cameron. I did not know him well – but he had a decent reputation. I assume he had to field emails or phone calls from irate politicians' spokesmen and I fancy that had he been on the receiving end of someone making the sort of attack he himself made on Smith – he would have lost little sleep over that kind of thing back then.\n\nOliver would have us believe, among other things, that a graphic of a spider's web featuring James Murdoch, Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron was a flagrant breach of impartiality, that it was unjustified for Smith to suggest that Murdoch was primarily now associated in the public mind with phone hacking and Millie Dowler, and that Smith should not have said Hunt was \"lobbying\" the prime minister when he wrote to him about the bid in favourable terms (though before he had taken over the handling of the matter from Vince Cable). Oliver claims he had rarely seen such a \"partial report\" and that Jeremy Hunt would be shocked and upset by it. Somehow I think other things will be upsetting Hunt more.\n\nOliver is doing his job – and Smith is doing his. There is a ritual to the exchange. But Oliver will have used up some currency. Of course he has to complain from time to time to convince his bosses that he is on the case – and he may sometimes be justified (though this particular case does not seem the right one to have fought). But in the end the spin has an anaesthetising effect – at least on the heavyweight end of BBC correspondents and editors.\n\nIn 1992, during the highly fought Major-Kinnock campaign – both sides phoned the extended 9 O'Clock News, which I was editing at the time, more or less every night. (They sometimes phoned while the programme was on air – demanding apologies and/or corrections before its end.) One night they both phoned after the programme to complain about the same piece on the NHS – each side claiming bias. For a few seconds I put the two phones together to let the spinmeisters hear each other – but then my courage deserted me and we all went back to polite BBC mode. It was a brief cathartic moment.\n\nThere are, I am sure, some senior politicians who complain very rarely. When they do – you know it is more likely you have made a mistake. Ken Clarke was a serial non-complainer. He did write once – complaining that we had said he had drawn his curtains to avoid seeing a miners' lobby outside his house when, he said, he was hundreds of miles away. By the time I got to paragraph two of his letter, I was composing the BBC apology. Less is sometimes more."
