        "text": "Rishi Sunak was heckled by a GP at a campaigning event in Wiltshire, writes Fiona Parker.\n\nThe Prime Minister was at Melksham Town Football Club with constituency MP Michelle Donelan, the Science Secretary, when he was interrupted by a GP. Mr Sunak was addressing Tory campaigners when Dr Jane Lees-Millais said: “But the NHS is disintegrating - I am one of 2,500 GPS in this country who are currently employed due to your policies.\n\n“What are you going to do about that? 37,000 GPs will not vote conservative because of the constructive dismal of general practice that is currently occurring. You cannot employ lesser qualified people instead of GPs. They cannot be replaced. The country is not stupid.”\n\nAfter waiting briefly, Mr Sunak - who also laughed at an activist interjecting that “most GPs spend more time on holiday than in the surgery” - responded directly to the heckler, saying: “My Dad was a GP, but my mum was also a pharmacist -so that’s the household I grew up in.\n\n“My parents dedicated themselves to primary care, I know a thing or two about it. I worked very hard in my pharmacy. Whilst we are supporting GPs and supporting them in investment in digital telephony tp make sure we can make it easier to get access for them.\n\n“We are also making it easier for people to see other primary care practitioners to get the treatment they need and that’s were I will respectfully disagree with you because I do think it’s right that people can now see their pharmacist to get medicines for seven common ailments like sore throat and sinusitis.”\n\nI did worry that last week’s column, when I suggested that Rishi Sunak may be on the brink of making an extraordinary comeback, wasn’t going to age particularly well, writes Camilla Tominey.\n\nThey say a week is a long time in politics, but in this case that’s proved to be an understatement. Following Nigel Farage’s resurgence and the Prime Minister’s disastrous decision to leave the D-Day commemorations early, it’s fair to say that my column now looks about as prescient as David Icke.\n\nForget Theresa May claiming “nothing has changed” in 2017 as her campaign collapsed around her. This extraordinary blunder is up there with Gordon Brown’s 2010 hot mic moment, when the then prime minister called Rochdale voter Gillian Duffy a “bigoted woman” behind her back, not realising he was still being recorded by Sky News.\n\nThe trouble for Sunak is that his hasty departure from the Normandy beaches, where thousands sacrificed their lives for our freedoms on June 6, 1944, doesn’t just look disrespectful; it looks politically incompetent. Even his apology seemed flimsy: “On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer.” A phrase involving Sherlock Holmes springs to mind.\n\nCamilla Tominey: Our incompetent governing class is ruining Britain\n\nDavid Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said it is up to veterans whether to accept Rishi Sunak’s apology.\n\n“I think he’s made an apology and said he’s sorry, that was the right thing to do particularly to the veterans that were there.\n\n“I was struck being there with Keir Starmer that in 10 years’ time, in 15 years’ time, in 20 years’ time, those veterans won’t be there, and that’s why this 80th commemoration was just so special and so important. And I felt very privileged to be there as shadow foreign secretary.\n\n“I only wished I could have taken my young children because it was this very, very special moment to respect and honour their sacrifice... Rishi Sunak was right to apologise, right to say sorry, but it is for [veterans] and their families to reflect on that apology, not really for me.”\n\nMark Spencer, an environment minister, insisted Rishi Sunak played a “huge part” in D-Day commemorations.\n\nMr Spencer told Sky News: “It was right that we took a moment as a nation to reflect on that huge event in our history. And that’s why the Prime Minister was part of those events.”\n\nChallenged on Mr Sunak’s decision to come home for a television interview, Mr Sunak said the itinerary was “set a very long time ago... Let’s be clear, the Prime Minister has realised it was a mistake to not attend the international leaders’ event. He recognises it was a mistake to leave early, that’s why he’s apologised and said it was not right to leave early.\n\n“When you make a mistake, the only way you can put that right is by apologising for that, that’s what the Prime Minister has done. But he did play a huge part in the two days that were there to celebrate D-Day.”\n\nLord Frost will not run to become an MP at this general election, ending months of speculation about whether he would seek a seat.\n\nThe former chief Brexit negotiator and ally of Boris Johnson had his path to run cleared at the start of the campaign when the Prime Minister made clear he was not blocked.\n\nHowever, after discussions with figures in the party, Lord Frost decided not to put his name forward. The deadline for registering as a candidate has now passed.\n\nLord Frost told The Telegraph: “I am grateful to the Prime Minister for lifting the block on me applying for Commons seats that had been in place since February. However, I will not be standing for the Commons in this election and intend to remain in the Lords.”\n\nBen Riley-Smith, our Political Editor, has the story\n\nIn giving another speech from Omaha Beach this afternoon, Joe Biden managed to take the political opportunity that Rishi Sunak completely missed yesterday, writes Tony Diver, our US Editor.\n\nThe president delivered a powerful address directed at Americans back home, which mobilised the image of the war in support of his election campaign.\n\nWhile he never veered into explicitly party political territory, the message was clear — he would protect American democracy and Donald Trump would not.\n\nThis took careful planning. I’m told speechwriters have been working on this moment for weeks, and it demonstrates a political knack that Mr Sunak’s campaign is clearly lacking.\n\nBack in 2010, David Cameron used some Democrat advisers to give his campaign a bit of a boost. Perhaps Tory HQ should now consider doing the same?\n\nNigel Farage, the Reform leader, accused Rishi Sunak of not being a patriotic Tory leader.\n\n“This was the last time ever there’ll be a gathering of veterans on parade in Normandy,” he said.\n\n“And if he’s not prepared to go to the international commemoration with the heads of so many countries, overlooking a beach which our Americans allies lost thousands of men, that says a lot about him.\n\n“He is completely disconnected from the centre of this country. And he’s proved to me that he basically is not a patriotic leader of the Conservative Party.”\n\nMunira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats’ education spokesman, said Mr Sunak had “disgraced his office”, adding: “I think people up and down the country will just be aghast at the Prime Minister’s priorities.\n\n“This really important event commemorating our veterans, of whom many sacrificed their lives for our freedoms and for our democracy, dashing home early from that to do a television news interview... I think people will just be incredulous. I feel he’s undermined the most senior office in the land and he’s not fit to be Prime Minister.”\n\nSir Jacob Rees-Mogg has urged Rishi Sunak to strike a deal with Nigel Farage before the general election.\n\nThe former business secretary issued the plea following a week that has been dominated by Mr Farage’s return to frontline politics as the new leader of Reform UK.\n\nSuccessive opinion polls on Wednesday and Thursday showed Reform just two percentage points behind the Conservatives, prompting the insurgent party to declare “we’re just getting started”.\n\nSir Jacob told the i newspaper: “I’ve said before that Nigel Farage should come into the Tory party, and I still think that. Conservatives and Reform agree on the vast bulk of policy, and we want to achieve the same things.”\n\nAsked whether Mr Sunak should pick up the phone to Mr Farage and seek to make an electoral pact, Sir Jacob said: “Well, I would certainly encourage him to do so.\n\nSir Keir Starmer will rehash Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to hand power to the unions by copying policies from his infamous 2017 manifesto, Labour documents show.\n\nThe Labour leader has quietly published plans to give trade unions a stranglehold on workplaces in a move that economists say will cost jobs, especially among the young.\n\nSir Keir intends to scrap the law that ensures minimum service levels on railways, in schools and in hospitals during strikes. It means unions will once again be able to bring the country to a halt with crippling walkouts.\n\nHe will make it easier for unions to carry out strike ballots – just as Mr Corbyn proposed – and will hammer small businesses by giving workers full rights from day one, hiking the minimum wage and banning unpaid internships.\n\nGordon Rayner, our Associate Editor, has all the details\n\nRishi Sunak insisted the focus should be “very much” on D-Day veterans and their legacy.\n\nThe Prime Minister told ITV News West Country: “Over the past couple of days, I’ve been pleased to attend a number of events, in Portsmouth and in Normandy, to honour all of those who risked their lives to defend our freedom and democracy 30 years ago.\n\n“The itinerary for all these things was set weeks ago, before the general election campaign, and the plan was to attend as I did and participate fully in all the British events with British veterans and then come back to the UK before the international leaders’ event that happened later in the day.\n\n“Now on reflection that was a mistake, which is why I’ve apologised, and I hope the focus can be very much actually on the veterans and what they’ve done.”\n\nTwo-thirds of voters believe Rishi Sunak leaving D-Day commemorations early was “unacceptable”, new polling shows.\n\nA survey by YouGov found 65 per cent of British adults believe it was either “somewhat unacceptable” or “completely unacceptable” for the Prime Minister to have departed when he did.\n\nOne in five voters believed it was either “somewhat acceptable” (13 per cent) or “completely acceptable” (eight per cent).\n\nMr Sunak did attend a British service in Normandy yesterday morning to mark the 80-year anniversary of D-Day but he returned to the UK to take part in a general election interview with ITV.\n\nHe tweeted this morning: “After the conclusion of the British event in Normandy, I returned back to the UK. On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer – and I apologise.”\n\nA Conservative MP standing down at the general election has criticised the Tory Party for its “Machiavellian” practices.\n\nIn a lengthy thread on X, formerly Twitter, Jo Gideon, who has represented Stoke-on-Trent since 2019, accused the party of creating a “democratic deficit” by choosing “ever more political careerist candidates who have little experience outside the Westminster bubble”.\n\n“Politics should be about serving the public, not a ruthless game of who can climb the greasy pole the fastest. Professionalism, integrity, and ethics should be at the core of our political system,” she said.\n\n“It is often said that you can judge a person by how they treat those who serve them. The backbone of any political party is its activists, local association members, and councillors.\n\n“I have been deeply dismayed by the way the Party has mistreated and disregarded these dedicated individuals... Now, loyal and hardworking MPs face deselection, intimidation, and a dismissive attitude when raising serious complaints related to discrimination based on age, gender, and ill health.”\n\nThe Foreign Secretary has praised Rishi Sunak’s apology and said he wanted to make D-Day commemorations “all about the veterans”.\n\nAsked about the Prime Minister’s apology, Lord Cameron, who filled in for Mr Sunak, said: “I think it’s a tribute to the way he is that he thought on reflection he wished he had stayed in France, and instead of digging in and defending himself he just came straight out and said on reflection I wish I’d had stayed longer.\n\n“But to be fair he was at the Portsmouth event with all the veterans, gave a brilliant speech, he was at the event, the British event, at our brand new built commemorative centre above Gold Beach in Normandy, where he was with the veterans, gave a fantastic speech. He always represents our veterans very well abroad. And he had a longstanding plan to return after that.\n\n“We are in the middle of an election campaign so that’s not surprising, but then on reflection he said that he wished he’d stayed for the later event and it’s a credit to him that he’s been so frank about it.”\n\nAsked whether Mr Sunak apologised because of how many people he had upset, Lord Cameron: “No, I think that’s an indication of the nature of Rishi Sunak. His point which I completely agree with which is that these events are all about the veterans, and he doesn’t want politics to get in the way of that. He had a longstanding plan to return to the UK after the British event and not go to the international event but he said on reflection he wished he had stayed in France. So I really think it’s about his frankness, and all credit to him.”\n\nVeterans are “sensible” and will “want to move on in due course” from the controversy surrounding Rishi Sunak, a former cabinet minister has said.\n\nSir David Davis, a former Brexit secretary, told Times Radio he “understood why people were annoyed” by the Prime Minister’s early departure from Normandy but said Mr Sunak had attended the “main event”.\n\n“Somebody got his diary wrong bluntly and you know I wouldn’t want to be receiving any of that conversation. Maybe he should have seen it.\n\n“But you know, the Prime Minister rushing from one thing to another, he missed it but he’s recognised he made a mistake. What more would you want him to do? He’s apologised directly, effectively directly, to the veterans and that was the right thing to do.”\n\n“But in terms of the wider debate, and to draw attention to the fact that we’re part of the competition, he is doing these gimmicky things. But rightly, I mean, it’s getting your attention and sometimes, you know, they may seem like corny jokes, but they have a practical meaning.\n\n“Even when he fell off the surfboard it was to draw attention to the pollution of Britain’s lakes and rivers. And that’s a very important issue, which the Lib Dems have actually led on so I’m all for what he is doing.”\n\nI woke up this morning with a groan at yet another misjudgment by Rishi’s team, who somehow thought it was a good idea for him to leave the D-Day commemorations in Normandy early yesterday, writes The Secret Tory Candidate.\n\nHow does this keep happening? A remembrance event is of profound emotional significance to the country. You cannot put enough attention into small details about the timing, when you leave, what you wear, how you act. These things matter in the 24-hour media age.\n\nThe people around Rishi should understand that and I’m concerned that they appear not to.\n\nIt was clearly a mistake and he’s acknowledged it as a mistake. But it is obviously not a good headline when you’ve got the Royal family there and other world leaders and then Keir Starmer – but our Prime Minister is not there.\n\nThis is hardly the first time I have despaired at miscalculations in the time Rishi has been in No 10. The strategy has often been wrong and the tactics have sometimes been wrong as well. It is worrying to those of us on the front line. But then we know the shortcomings of the administration.\n\nThe Secret Tory Candidate pulls back the curtain here\n\nA former head of the Royal Navy said Rishi Sunak’s decision to leave D-Day commemorations in Normandy early was an “own goal” and a “cock-up”.\n\nAdmiral Lord West, who is a Labour peer, said it was “absolutely surprising and extraordinary” that Mr Sunak had returned to the UK rather than attend an international gathering with other world leaders.\n\nLord West, who was First Sea Lord from 2002 to 2006, told the BBC Radio 4 World at One programme: “I find it very strange that he should do such an own goal, I mean it comes across so badly.”\n\nHe added: “I’m sure Rishi Sunak himself is a decent man but his advisers should have told him. They’re probably paid lots of money in PR terms but what a cock-up, I mean absolutely dreadful and it comes over so badly. Yes, he has apologised, but I think people are becoming fed up with apologies.”\n\nMr Sunak did attend a British service in Normandy yesterday morning to mark the 80-year anniversary of D-Day but he returned to the UK to take part in a general election interview with ITV.\n\nHe tweeted this morning: “After the conclusion of the British event in Normandy, I returned back to the UK. On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer – and I apologise.”\n\nJust when you thought the Conservatives’ election campaign couldn’t get any worse, the Prime Minister chose to snub veterans by leaving the D-Day commemoration event in Normandy early, writes Tom Harris.\n\nHe did so in order to be interviewed by a broadcaster. Then he apologised. Those are the bare facts, and, frankly, it’s difficult to know where to start with this.\n\nHad we not been in the middle of a general election campaign, there can be little doubt that letters from Tory MPs demanding a vote of no confidence in Rishi Sunak would be dropping on to Graham Brady’s desk like confetti.\n\nMuch can be forgiven of our political leaders, but choosing to attend a TV interview instead of spending just a little more time with the heroes who fought to liberate Europe 80 years ago falls into the “unforgivable” column.\n\nTom Harris: Sunak’s own judgment has let the country down\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber has accused Rishi Sunak of an “astonishing and terrible lack of political judgment” after leaving D-Day commemorations early.\n\nLord Lloyd Webber, a lifelong Conservative supporter, composed a new piece of music, Lovingly Remembered, to mark the 80th anniversary of the landings.\n\nIt was played at the wreath-laying ceremony at the British Normandy Memorial event that Mr Sunak did attend yesterday before his departure.\n\nLord Lloyd Webber said: “It was an astonishing and terrible lack of political judgement, and acumen. I cannot understand it.\n\n“I would say it’s very hard to see a way back – he’s a bright man but he has obviously not been advised well. The D-Day commemoration is extremely important, because most of the young don’t know about it.”\n\nOne senior Tory said Lord Cameron - who stayed behind to fill in after Mr Sunak left - had questions to answer, writes Daniel Martin, our Deputy Political Editor.\n\n“I simply don’t understand how this could have happened,” the Conservative said.\n\n“Surely someone around him should have said you simply cannot do this.You have to be there for the full day and you have to meet with world leaders. Everything else has to be dropped.\n\n“One key question for me is: why didn’t David Cameron intervene? He is a former prime minister and is now Foreign Secretary. Surely he should have said: no no, you have to stay. Did he say this? If not, why not?”\n\nThe policing minister has clashed with a Liberal Democrat MP over Rishi Sunak leaving yesterday’s D-Day commemorations in Normandy early.\n\nIn an exchange on Politics Live, Sarah Olney, the Lib Dem candidate for Richmond Park, said she felt “quite ashamed” of the Prime Minister, adding: “Honestly, I do feel that it’s a huge privilege to be able to commemorate this 80th anniversary of D-Day with people who were actually there... I think it’s really shaming.”\n\nChris Philp, the Tory minister, interjected: “Were you there yesterday to mark it, Sarah? I went to an event.”\n\nMs Olney replied: “I have to tell you, I was due to go to a D-Day event in my constituency but I was uninvited because the general election was called and it was felt inappropriate to have politicians there.”\n\nMr Philp interjected “I went just as a member of the public, yesterday evening”, to which Ms Olney said: “I don’t know why you’re putting this on me. I’m entitled to feel ashamed of what the Prime Minister has done in a foreign country on our behalf.”\n\nA leading adviser to Michael Gove has quit the Tory party over Rishi Sunak’s “cynical” decision to spurn D-Day commemorations for a general election TV interview, writes Charles Hymas.\n\nIan Acheson, who has advised the Communities Secretary on extremism, said the Prime Minister’s decision was a “colossal act of disrespect” to war veterans on what could be the last commemoration that they could attend.\n\nIn his resignation letter, seen by The Telegraph, Mr Acheson, a former prison governor, said: “It was an act of either colossal stupidity or cynical calculation.\n\n“Either way, it revealed to me that while I still embrace a conservative philosophy, I am no longer willing to have it outsourced to a bunch of mendacious, incompetent and disreputable clowns. Country before party. Always.”\n\nNigel Farage claimed Rishi Sunak’s D-Day decision was the Prime Minister’s “Gillian Duffy moment”.\n\nThe Reform leader referenced Gordon Brown being caught on a hot microphone during the 2010 general election campaign calling a Labour-supporting pensioner who had confronted him a “bigot”.\n\nIt was viewed as one of the defining moments of the 2010 campaign which ultimately ended with Labour losing power.\n\nMr Farage told ITV: “This is the Gillian Duffy moment. It happened a few years ago to Gordon Brown when he was prime minister when he sort of wrote off a Labour supporting woman asking why had immigration changed her town.\n\n“It was a catastrophe for Gordon Brown and I think the one thing people have always associated the Conservative Party with is being basically patriotic.\n\n“It is led by a man who very clearly isn’t.”\n\nThe former head of the Royal Navy said Rishi Sunak’s early departure from D-Day commemorations prompted the question “how the hell can he run the country?”.\n\nLord West, a Labour peer, told BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme: “I’m sure he feels very guilty now but it was a terrible error and you can’t afford to make terrible errors on simple things when you’re in a big election campaign.\n\n“There have been other errors, haven’t there, like the Titanic [Quarter visit in Belfast on 24 May] and things like that.\n\n“Somebody is not pulling things together and it makes you wonder, well, if they can’t run an election campaign, how the hell can they run the country?”\n\nA former head of the Royal Navy said Rishi Sunak’s decision not to stay in Normandy to attend a D-Day event with other world leaders was “absolutely dreadful” and a “cock-up”.\n\nIt was suggested to Lord West that the key thing was that Mr Sunak had attended a British service to mark the 80-year anniversary of D-Day in Normandy yesterday morning.\n\nThe Labour peer replied: “Well I still think it was a stupid thing not to be there. When you’ve got people like the president of the United States, the president of France, Zelensky and others all there and the one person who is not there is the political head of the United Kingdom. I think it comes over very badly.\n\n“I’m sure Rishi Sunak himself is a decent man but his advisers should have told him. They’re probably paid lots of money in PR terms but what a cock-up, I mean absolutely dreadful and it comes over so badly.\n\n“Yes he has apologised but I think people are becoming fed up with apologies.”\n\nAdmiral Lord West, the former head of the Royal Navy, said Rishi Sunak’s decision to leave D-Day commemorations in Normandy early was “extraordinary”.\n\nThe Labour peer told the BBC World at One programme: “I find it just absolutely surprising and extraordinary.”\n\nLord West, who was First Sea Lord from 2002 to 2006, added: “I’d have thought he’d have been desperate to be involved in such a major, major event of such significance to so many millions of people across the United Kingdom, let alone around the world, and that he’d be absolutely desperate to be there to meet these veterans who probably will never go to a large event like this ever again because of their age. I’m afraid to say it’s very unlikely.\n\n“It should have been, he was breaking his programme to make sure he was there. I find it very strange that he should do such an own goal, I mean it comes across so badly.”\n\nLord Cameron praised Rishi Sunak for apologising over his decision to leave D-Day commemorations early.\n\nThe Foreign Secretary told broadcasters: “I think it is a tribute to the way he is that he thought on reflection he wished he had stayed in France and instead of digging in and defending himself he just came straight out and said on reflection I wish I had stayed longer.\n\n“But to be fair, he was at the Portsmouth event with all the veterans., gave a brilliant speech, he was at the British event at our brand new built commemorative centre above Gold Beach in Normandy where he was with the veterans, gave a fantastic speech.\n\n“He always represents our country very well abroad and he had a long standing plan to return after that and we are in the middle of an election campaign so that is not surprising.”\n\nRishi Sunak said D-Day events should not be politicised and called for the focus to be on veterans when challenged over his D-Day ceremony snub.\n\nSpeaking to broadcasters on a campaign visit to Wiltshire, the Prime Minister said: “Over the past two days I’ve participated in a number of events in Portsmouth and France to honour those who risked their lives to defend our freedom and our values 80 years ago.\n\n“The itinerary for these events was set weeks ago before the start of the general election campaign, and having participated in all the British events with British veterans, I returned home before the international leaders event later in the day. On reflection, that was a mistake and I apologise.\n\n“I think it’s important though, given the enormity of the sacrifice made, that we don’t politicise this. The focus should rightly be on the veterans who gave so much.”\n\nSir Keir Starmer appeared to question Rishi Sunak’s character over the Prime Minister’s decision to leave the D-Day commemorations early.\n\nThe Labour leader told reporters on a visit to a housing development in Brent Cross this morning: “Politics is about the choices you make.\n\n“And this election is about character, who you have in your mind’s eye when you make decisions and for me there was only one place I was going to be which is there to pay my respects to the veterans and to say thank you to them on behalf of all of us, including my young children who, as I said to many of the veterans, were pretty carefree yesterday going to school but that was down to their sacrifice and the sacrifice particularly of those colleagues of theirs who didn’t make it back.”\n\nHe added: “I made a choice yesterday about what I would do as leader of the Labour Party and as a candidate to be Prime Minister and I knew I should be there. This was not a discussion.\n\n“It was my duty to be there, it was my privilege to be there.\n\n“Privilege is a word that is probably overused in politics but I felt privileged to be able to be with veterans who had fought on D-Day against the odds to liberate Europe and to allow me to grow up in peace and freedom and democracy.”\n\nRecognition of Palestinian statehood as part of any peace process in the Middle East will be included as a commitment in the Labour manifesto, Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC during a visit in London this morning, the Labour leader said: “That needs to be part of the process, it’s very important we have a viable Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel.”\n\nHe added: “It is an inalienable right of the Palestinians, it’s not in the gift of Israel, so it has to be part of the peace process.”\n\nAsked whether this will be in the manifesto, he said: “It will be.”\n\nJohn Healey, the shadow defence secretary, has written to Grant Shapps to ask a series of questions about Rishi Sunak’s decision to leave D-Day commemorations early.\n\nMr Healey told the Defence Secretary that the decisions raises “worrying questions about both his judgement and his priorities”.\n\nOne of the questions asked by Mr Healey was when the decision to return back to the UK early was actually made.\n\nHe said in the letter: “There are many people across the country, especially within Armed Forces communities, who feel betrayed and feel that Britain has been let down by the Prime Minister.\n\n“The public deserve clear explanations from the Prime Minister and those around him about why this dreadful decision was made. I trust that these are the questions you are asking, and you will respond as soon as possible.”\n\nLabour will build more social houses if it wins the general election on July 4, Sir Keir Starmer has said.\n\nAsked whether his party would build more social homes, he told reporters: “Yes, we will and we will make sure that we hit that stretch target of 1.5 million houses.\n\n“And what we’ve announced today is really important, which is the lower deposits that we will put in place, particularly for young people because the example at the moment is of young people on a reasonably decent wage, let’s say a couple, who are paying very high rents, higher rents than they probably would do on a mortgage, but because they’re paying high rents they can’t afford to save for a deposit and many of them don’t have a mum or dad or anybody else that can help them out.\n\n“So this is going to be a game-changer for them.”\n\nSir Keir Starmer said Rishi Sunak has to “answer for his choices” over his decision to leave D-Day commemorations in Normandy early.\n\nThe Labour leader told broadcasters during a visit to a housing development in London this morning that staying for the whole day of events yesterday was “the only choice I was going to make”.\n\nAsked about Mr Sunak’s apology, Sir Keir said: “He will have to answer for his own choices. For me the only choice was to be there.\n\n“It was a humbling day to contemplate the bravery, individually, of those, many of them teenagers, running up the beach under gun fire, not knowing whether they would succeed or fail and then to think about how hard that must have been.\n\n“To then see the veterans and say thank you, I thanked them on behalf of the Labour Party and the country and on behalf of my children actually who were freely going to school yesterday because of the contribution that they made, the sacrifice that they made and their colleagues.\n\n“For me it was really important to be there for the whole day paying my respects. That was the only choice I was going to make. The Prime Minister really will have to answer for his choices.”\n\nRishi Sunak’s decision to leave D-Day commemorations in Normandy early was a “significant mistake”, Johnny Mercer said.\n\nBut the minister for veterans’ affairs said people should not “lose their heads over this” as he highlighted Mr Sunak’s record on helping veterans.\n\nHe told The Sun: “I get the outrage. I get that this is a significant mistake. But let’s not lose our heads over this.\n\n“This guy has done more for veterans than any of his predecessors and that is coming from someone who has campaigned on this for nine or 10 years and left government pretty frequently over the issue.”\n\nJohnny Mercer said Rishi Sunak had done more to help veterans “than any of his predecessors” in No 10.\n\nThe minister for veterans’ affairs told The Sun: “The truth is this is a mistake but if you sit there now, this guy has done more on veterans’ affairs in this country than any of his predecessors.\n\n“So you have to bear this in context otherwise it is not really fair. He has made a mistake and he has apologised for that.”\n\nJohnny Mercer, the Tory minister for veterans’ affairs, said Rishi Sunak’s decision to leave D-Day commemorations in Normandy early was “disappointing”.\n\nHe told The Sun: “Obviously it is a mistake. I think the Prime Minister, on these visits, you receive a lot of advice as to what you should and shouldn’t be doing.\n\n“I have spoken to the Prime Minister this morning and obviously it is disappointing. But I do find the kind of faux outrage from people who have done nothing but make my life difficult trying to improve veterans affairs over the years pretty nauseating, to be frank.”\n\nThe Tories have vehemently denied a claim that Rishi Sunak had planned not to attend D-Day commemorations in Normandy.\n\nA report published on the Reaction website today, citing Tory sources, claimed the French government had been told a week ago that Mr Sunak would not attend the commemorations because of the general election campaign.\n\nIt was claimed that a short visit was then agreed on as a compromise.\n\nBut Tory sources told The Telegraph that the claim was “totally untrue”.\n\nNigel Farage, the Reform leader, had responded to the claim by tweeting: “Now we learn that [Rishi Sunak’s] original plan was not to attend the D-Day 80th at all. Patriotic people who love their country should not vote for him.”\n\nSir Craig Oliver, who served as David Cameron’s director of communications in No 10, said the D-Day row was a “disastrous moment” for Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party.\n\nSir Craig said the Prime Minister’s apology this morning showed the Tories are “massively on the backfoot and deeply worried”.\n\nHe told BBC Breakfast: “It is very obvious from the outside looking in that this is a disastrous moment for the campaign.\n\n“The fact that they have had to apologise is a very unusual moment. You never want to be in that position and it is a sign that they are massively on the backfoot and deeply worried about the criticism they are going to face over this issue.”\n\nFamilies who earn up to £120,000 will be able to keep all of their child benefit under a new Conservative policy to be unveiled today.\n\nUnder the current rules, child benefit is judged on individual not household earnings, and the threshold is £60,000. If one parent’s earnings exceed that level, the benefit starts to be removed.\n\nNow the Tories have pledged to base the system on households’ overall income instead, with a new threshold of £120,000.\n\nThe move will leave 700,000 families on average £1,500 a year better off, according to Tory analysis.\n\nYou can read the full story here.\n\nRishi Sunak is being accused of “not getting what it is to be a prime minister” after skipping the major international D-Day ceremony in Normandy, former Downing Street communications chief Sir Craig Oliver has said.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the D-Day anniversary would have been known about as soon as Mr Sunak called the general election.\n\n“And I think if you’re planning these things, you’ve got to say ‘look, that’s going to block the Prime Minister out’. It’s a very important moment for the country. But it’s also a very important moment to show that you’re being prime ministerial.\n\n“And the problem for Rishi Sunak this morning is he’s accused of not getting what it is to be a prime minister and what his duties are as a prime minister.”\n\nSir Craig also criticised the Tory campaign for sending children’s minister David Johnston into broadcast studios on Friday morning without knowing “what to say” about the snub.\n\n“It was pretty clear that the Conservative campaign was going to be massively on the backfoot today,” he said.\n\nA Labour frontbencher welcomed Rishi Sunak’s apology and said it was “absolutely a mistake” for the Prime Minister to have left D-Day commemorations in Normandy early.\n\nMatthew Pennycook, a shadow housing minister, told Sky News: “I am glad he has apologised because it is absolutely a mistake and it is not just the fact that the Prime Minister left those D-Day commemoration services, perhaps the last commemoration services for many of the veterans who attended... but the reason why he left those services.\n\n“He left, let’s be clear, to come back and pre-record an interview where he doubled down on a proven lie about the Labour Party’s intentions if it forms the next government.”\n\nA senior SNP figure said Rishi Sunak’s decision to leave D-Day commemorations early was “utterly appalling and disgusting”.\n\nNeil Gray, the Scottish government’s Cabinet Secretary for Health, said Mr Sunak had put a TV interview ahead of honouring the memory of D-Day veterans.\n\nResponding to Mr Sunak’s apology, Mr Gray told Sky News: “It is an absolutely extraordinary dereliction of duty from the Prime Minister to abandon the D-Day veterans.\n\n“My grandfather was a Royal Engineer, served at D-Day, helped to deliver the Mulberry harbours that meant that D-Day was a success.\n\n“The Prime Minister in choosing to leave that commemoration early has ill-served his memory and the memory of so many others who lost their lives and who, some of whom did come home, but have now been served by a Prime Minister who put a TV interview before their memory.\n\n“I think it is utterly appalling and disgusting.”\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Rishi Sunak had “brought shame” to the office of Prime Minister by leaving Normandy early.\n\n“One of the greatest privileges of the office of Prime Minister is to be there to honour those who served, yet Rishi Sunak abandoned them on the beaches of Normandy,” Sir Ed said.\n\n“He has brought shame to that office and let down our country. I am thinking right now of all those veterans and their families he left behind and the hurt they must be feeling. It is a total dereliction of duty and shows why this Conservative Government just has to go.”\n\nA minister said voters know Rishi Sunak is “very committed” to helping armed forces veterans as he defended the premier’s handling of D-Day commemorations.\n\nDavid Johnston, the children’s minister, told Times Radio: “I think the Prime Minister has been at several commemorations this week.\n\n“I think this Government has done more than any government to support our veterans, with our great veterans’ minister, Johnny Mercer, now sitting in Cabinet making sure their voice is always represented and the Veterans’ Bill we are committed to which will do a whole range of things to bring down costs for veterans, to increase the employment rate for veterans.\n\n“And I think people know this Prime Minister is very committed to them.”\n\nA Tory minister was asked to respond to a Conservative Party activist who said Rishi Sunak “seems to be doing all he can to lose the election” in the wake of the D-Day row.\n\nDavid Johnston, the children’s minister, was read a message during an interview on Times Radio from a Tory activist called Peter who was supposed to be canvassing in a Red Wall seat this afternoon.\n\nThe message said: “Rishi Sunak’s behaviour in leaving the D-Day commemorations ceremony makes me wonder whether I should bother going. Please ask your Conservative guest why I should put myself out when the Prime Minister seems to be doing all he can to lose the election.”\n\nMr Johnston replied: “Well, I would separate those two things. I think it is clear that the Prime Minister has spent the week paying his respects on behalf of the country in Portsmouth on Wednesday, in Normandy on Thursday, to our veterans and to mark the importance of D-Day as I was doing in my own constituency yesterday.\n\n“But the reason that that activist should go out is because the country is facing a very clear choice between a Prime Minister and Government taking the right decisions for their families and a Keir Starmer led Labour Party that cannot tell you what they would do on any key issue facing this country.”\n\nDavid Johnston, the children’s minister, said he did not know exactly when Rishi Sunak left D-Day commemorations in France yesterday.\n\nHe told Times Radio this morning: “The Prime Minister was at the service in Portsmouth on Wednesday and he was in Normandy yesterday and people saw that, people watched his speech yesterday paying tribute to them.”\n\nAsked why Mr Sunak had left early, Mr Johnston said: “Well, I don’t know exactly when he left but I know that he was in Normandy yesterday for the big service and I know that there were other Government ministers there also, showing this Government’s commitment to veterans and to recognising the importance of D-Day.”\n\nMr Johnston said that he did not know exactly “what the Prime Minister’s diary looks like”.\n\nA TV debate featuring representatives from the UK’s seven main political parties will be the main event of the general election campaign today.\n\nNigel Farage will represent Reform UK as he is given the opportunity to clash with Penny Mordaunt who will be flying the Tory flag and Angela Rayner who will be there for Labour.\n\nThere will also be representatives from the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru, with proceedings due to get underway at 7.30pm on BBC One.\n\nBefore the debate, Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will both be turning their full attention back to campaign events after a pause to attend D-Day commemorations yesterday.\n\nMr Sunak will be in the South West of England to unveil a Tory pledge to make child benefit rules more generous while Sir Keir will visit a housing development in London to mark a new Labour pledge to allow first-time buyers to use the state as their mortgage guarantor.\n\nElsewhere, John Swinney, the SNP leader, will deliver a speech in Glasgow this morning. Meanwhile, the formal deadline for general election candidate nominations is 5pm.\n\nRishi Sunak must take risks on the campaign trail to boost his chances of gaining ground on Labour, George Osborne has suggested.\n\nThe former chancellor told his Political Currency podcast that Mr Sunak should move away from scripted visits and carefully choreographed events in favour of something “a bit scruffy”.\n\nMr Osborne said: “If I were Sunak I would be really tempted to get away from the sort of slick campaigning, of the kind of Blair and Cameron era, where every visit is really organised, and show something that’s a bit scruffy and unscripted and risky.\n\n“I think the public also [have] watched so many episodes of ‘The West Wing’ or ‘The Thick of It’ people know how these things work now. They’ve seen the wiring.\n\n“Even though Sunak is so much more sort of a classic politician candidate than Boris Johnson or Donald Trump or Nigel Farage. Nevertheless, he could take some risks on the campaign trail.”\n\nLord Bailey told GB News: “There’s two ways to look at this. You are in the middle of a campaign, you want to make a big impact. The best impact you can make at this point is being seen on the world stage with the biggest leaders in the world.\n\n“That is probably the way to go. On top of that, you have possibly the biggest event in the last 100 years that they are celebrating, you should be there, it sends a message.”\n\nHe added: “I think it was a mistake to leave.”"
