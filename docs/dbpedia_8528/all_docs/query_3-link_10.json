        "text": "From the start, he told me, they’d tried to sell voters on two themes: One was a positive message, a case for the benefits of EU membership: “Stronger, Safer, Better off.” The other was negative: “Don’t risk it. Leaving the EU would be a leap in the dark.” Both, he said, were “very, very clear. Everybody can go out there and say it. And I think that we’re having real traction in the campaign.”\n\nThe truth, however, was that neither seemed to work. The economic warnings had been dismissed by many as scaremongering (“Project Fear”). The Leave campaign’s promise that Brexit would be a vote to “take back control” seemed to be gaining traction, and it had the full-throated support of most of the powerful conservative newspapers.\n\nThat week, one of Oliver’s trump cards had flopped. A senior MP, Sarah Wollaston, had defected from the Leave camp because of its dubious claim that leaving the EU would save £350 million a week that could be spent on the NHS. He had given the story to the Times, thinking it would lead their front page, but instead they buried it and splashed on a wealthy Tory donor endorsing Brexit (even though the Times ultimately endorsed Remain).\n\nOliver wasn’t worried. “I would agree with you [the Leave campaign] had a good few days on immigration,” Oliver said. But he cautioned me to be “wary of prevailing narratives,” and pointed to the run-up to the general election, when pollsters and pundits were adamant the Tories would lose.\n\n“Remember the kind of narrative that was,” Oliver said. “Labour have got a better ground war, a better ground campaign, everything’s going well and aren’t they doing brilliantly. Turned out not to be the case. They didn’t have a very good ground campaign. They weren’t having an impact.”\n\nI asked Oliver about the TV debates, his natural turf. I told him I didn’t think the previous night’s broadcast — a two-hour head-to-head on ITV, in which Boris Johnson led the Leave side — had gone that well. He disagreed. Not many people sat through the full broadcast, he said. What really mattered were the soundbites that would later lead TV bulletins and flitter through social media. “When you’re playing those debates, you need to think, ‘How is this clipping?’” Oliver said.\n\nHe was right, to an extent. On the 10 o’clock bulletins from the night of the debate, Remain supporters appeared to dominate. Their quips about Johnson’s ambitions of becoming prime minister featured more prominently than any of the Leave campaign’s arguments.\n\nThe trouble was, we would later discover, the attacks on Johnson didn’t really go down well with the public. Remainers came across as “too mean,” an adviser to the Leave campaign told me later. The clips just played to Leave’s argument that Remain was trying to keep voters scared.\n\nBefore I left, I asked Oliver if he thought they could lose the vote. “As you look at me today, do I think we have got a real challenge? Yes I do. We really have a real challenge. Do I think, you know, is there a possibility that [you’ll be] writing this article saying, you know, that it didn’t all work out?”\n\n“That’s a possibility,” he said.\n\n* * *\n\nFour weeks passed before I reached Oliver on the phone as he was getting ready to go on holiday. When polls closed on the night of June 23, Oliver and the rest of Cameron’s team had thought victory was in hand. But as results trickled in, the mood in Number 10 darkened. The next morning, Cameron resigned. A few weeks later, they were all out of power — replaced by a new administration.\n\nOn Cameron’s last day, Oliver and a few of his inner circle gathered in the prime minister’s private office to reminisce. Cameron’s wife, Samantha, and children were there, dressed up ready to go to Buckingham Palace, where Cameron would give the Queen his formal resignation. Number 10 had been cleaned and tidied, ready for the arrival of May’s people. Cameron left two bottles of red wine as a gift for his successor.\n\nAs they filed out to face the waiting press, Downing Street staff formed a guard of honor and Cameron went down the line giving high-fives. Outside, Oliver and other aides watched Cameron give his final speech as prime minister, then depart for the Palace. The aides left through a back entrance and headed to the Admiralty pub on Trafalgar Square.\n\n“Genuinely, I don’t think we would’ve run a different campaign” — Craig Oliver\n\nIn the post-match analysis of the Brexit result, critics had been scathing. Cameron was blamed for not doing enough in his time in office to improve the lives of poorer voters, and had been punished for it; or calling the referendum, putting the country’s future on the line to settle an internal party dispute; or not getting a better deal from European leaders in February, but naïvely thinking he could sell it to voters anyway; and for quitting right after the vote, without leaving a plan in place.\n\nOliver’s Remain campaign was blamed for being too negative, for not highlighting the benefits of the EU, for underestimating the depths of public concern about migration, for not uniting the various political parties, and for failing to counter a nimble, aggressive, motivated opponent.\n\nI wondered what Oliver’s own analysis was, now that he’d had a few weeks to ponder, and his answer perplexed me. “Genuinely, I don’t think we would’ve run a different campaign,” he said.\n\nThey’d had data, polling, past experience. All the experts, all the models, predicted that the economic consequences of Brexit would trump the public’s concerns about immigration. “Even right up to the last minute, most people, most pollsters, most people who’d modeled it — hedge funds, businesses — thought the Remain camp was going to win,” Oliver said.\n\nEven the Leave campaign thought voters would choose to stay. The other side didn’t have a “brilliant strategy,” either, Oliver said. He accused them of playing dirty, pushing discredited claims about Britain sending £350 million a week to the EU and Turkey being on the brink of joining the union. “We were up against a campaign that was prepared to mislead on an industrial scale,” Oliver said.\n\nI asked if Cameron was to blame, but Oliver wouldn’t entertain that, either. A showdown about Britain’s EU membership was a “slow train coming,” Oliver said, repeating a soundbite he’d used a few days earlier in an interview with the BBC. “The idea that there didn’t need to be a referendum is for the birds,” he told me.\n\nOliver refused to be dragged into a session of soul-searching. He had spent the weeks after leaving Number 10 lining up paid speeches, having exploratory conversations about a new job, and starting work on a book about the referendum campaign: “Unleashing Demons,” to be published by Hodder & Stoughton later this year. He was in line for a knighthood, a parting gift from his former boss — and he got one. He headed to Sicily, where he had rented a villa near Marsala on the west coast of the Mediterranean island.\n\nThere was one area where Oliver conceded the campaign had got it wrong, though he presented it more as an observation than a mea culpa. None of the experts the campaign employed foresaw that so many voters who are normally uninterested in politics would turn out to vote to give the political establishment a kicking. “Normally pollsters believe those people aren’t going to turn up, but they did in this case and nobody predicted that,” Oliver said.\n\nCameron’s administration had been accused of overlooking those left behind by globalization, the struggling classes who felt squeezed between what they saw as an uncaring elite and a growing population of immigrants they felt threatened their economic security and cultural values. The models on which Oliver had relied, on which the Remainers built their campaign, excluded those very people, and they handed them a crushing defeat.\n\nThe demons had been unleashed, to use Oliver’s metaphor, but neither he, nor anybody else in the Cameron administration, seemed to have noticed. If they had been blind to their needs while governing, they were also blind to their significance while campaigning. They had failed to realize the depths of the public anger, the extraordinary resentment that had built up over time, among those who had fallen through the cracks, when it was their job to gauge the political winds, interpret them and channel them.\n\nThe Cameronites gambled and lost, and now they were walking away."
