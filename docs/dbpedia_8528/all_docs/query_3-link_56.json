        "text": "David Cameron's former spin doctor visibly squirmed last night when he was asked to justify his 'crony' knighthood.\n\n'Sir' Craig Oliver was handed the honour last month, as David Cameron departed Downing Street for good.\n\nThe newly minted knight of the realm had a very awkward live TV exchange with Channel 4 News anchor Krishnan Guru Murthy.\n\n\"Why have you got a knighthood? Isn't that a reward for failure?\", he asked the ex-spinner, who was in charge of messaging for the Remain campaign.\n\n'Sir' Craig replied: \"Why have I got a knighthood? Look, I'm not going to try to justify why I've got a knighthood. I think that's a fool's errand trying to do that.\"\n\nAsked why not, the communications expert fumbled to find a good answer.\n\nHe said: \"You end up in a situation where any answer you give is not going to work.\"\n\nGuru Murthy shot back: \"As David Cameron 's PR chief, shouldn't you have advised him that it was a very bad idea to give you a knighthood because he would look bad as a result?\n\n\"It would look like cronyism as he left Downing Street.\"\n\n'Sir' Craig said he would leave it to others to decide if he was worthy of the honour.\n\nKrishnan went on to list some of the other great men to hold the title.\n\n\"Winston Churchill, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh and now Craig Oliver\", he said. \"You must feel like you deserve it.\"\n\nCheeky Krishnan ended the interview, saying: \"Craig Oliver, thanks for coming in....SIR Craig, sorry. I beg your pardon.\""
