Even the most powerful man on Earth was taken aback by the ease with which the jacketless, tieless British prime minister behaved.\n\nBarack Obama, a former American president, noted that Mr Cameron “possessed an impressive command of the issues, a facility with language and the easy confidence of someone who’d never been pressed too hard by life”. Mr Cameron had the attributes to be an excellent prime minister: intelligence, diligence, a quick wit and a smooth manner. Instead, he managed to be one of the worst.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe Economist"
