        "text": "Rishi Sunak’s Cabinet reshuffle on Monday has shocked the nation, as the Prime Minister ousted several key ministers and appointed former-PM David Cameron to a senior role.\n\nSuella Braverman was the first big name to leave No 10 after being stripped of her Government position, after prompting a political maelstrom with a controversial op-ed published in The Times last week, in which she claimed the Metropolitan Police was “playing favourites” with protesters.\n\n“It has been the greatest privilege of my life to serve as home secretary,” she said as she departed, adding: “I will have more to say in due course.”\n\nThe drama came to a head when former-PM-turned-life-peer Lord Cameron was ushered in as the new Foreign Secretary, following a seven-year hiatus from frontline politics.\n\nWith the political setup looking reminiscent of 2010 and with few women in the top jobs, i breaks down who at the forefront is a fresh face, and who also appeared in Lord Cameron’s respective Cabinets from 2010 until 2016.\n\nWho is in the Cabinet?\n\nFirst, Mr Cameron’s appointment as Foreign Secretary was a surprise addition to Mr Sunak’s Cabinet on Monday.\n\nHe stood down as an MP in 2016 after having called the Brexit referendum and campaigned to remain in the EU, and losing the vote.\n\nHe has been given a peerage enabling him to take up the role, and will be the first to serve as Foreign Secretary from the Lords since Lord Carrington under Margaret Thatcher in 1979.\n\nThough he may have disagreed with some of Mr Sunak’s “individual decisions,” he now describes the PM as a “strong and capable Prime Minister who is showing exemplary leadership at a difficult time”.\n\n“I want to help him to deliver the security and prosperity our country needs and be part of the strongest possible team that serves the United Kingdom and that can be presented to the country when the general election is held,” he added.\n\nLord Cameron could be in for a grilling on the media circuit. He will be expected to conduct a round of media interviews not just about his day job but thorny subjects such as the Greensill lobbying scandal and his track record as PM.\n\nHe replaced James Cleverly, who in turn has replaced outgoing Ms Braverman as Home Secretary. Mr Cleverly had served as foreign secretary since September last year, after being appointed to the role by the UK’s shortest lived PM, Liz Truss.\n\nLike his predecessor, Mr Cleverly is “absolutely committed to stopping the boats” that carry illegal immigrants landing in the UK, also making sure that “everybody in the UK feels safe and secure, going around, going about their daily business, knowing that the Government is here to protect them”, he said.\n\nJeremy Hunt, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was also brought in by Ms Truss following the implosion of her mini-Budget, and has been re-appointed ahead of the Autumn Statement next week when he will set out the Government’s tax and spending plans.\n\nSteve Barclay has moved from health to environment, with Victoria Atkins, who was financial secretary to the Treasury, appointed Health Secretary.\n\nWho has left?\n\nThérèse Coffey, the former environment secretary who was spotted chatting to Larry the Downing Street cat on her way to No 10 this morning, is among latest to have been axed from the Cabinet.\n\n“I consider it is now the right time to step back from Government,” she said in a letter to the Prime Minister, pointing out that she has been a minister since 2014, and served under all five Conservative prime ministers.\n\n“It has been a privilege to serve in your Cabinet,” she said, addressing Mr Sunak.\n\nIn response, the PM said: “Thank you for your letter. I want to express my gratitude to you for your years of dedicated ministerial service and your friendship to me personally.”\n\nPaymaster general Jeremy Quin and housing minister Rachel Maclean are other casualties of Mr Sunak’s reshuffle.\n\nWill Quince has resigned as a junior health minister after having previously announced he planned to step down as an MP at the next election. “I campaigned for Rishi last summer and I remain an enthusiastic supporter of the Prime Minister’s leadership,” he said.\n\nAnd Jesse Norman, the MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire, has quit as a minister in the Department for Transport, though he was to play an instrumental role in delivering Mr Sunak’s ban on smoking and vaping for young people.\n\nWhich current ministers were also members of Cameron’s Cabinets from 2010-2016?\n\nThere are a few familiar faces – Mr Hunt is an old timer here. He joined the Cabinet under Mr Cameron as secretary of state for culture, olympics, media and sport in the run-up to the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nHe then went on to become health secretary later that year, where he secured a funding increase for the NHS but faced criticism from junior doctors over plans to introduce new contracts. Mr Hunt became foreign secretary in 2018, outlasting Mr Cameron’s tenure.\n\nThe MP for South West Surrey has twice stood unsuccessfully for the party leadership, losing to Boris Johnson in 2019.\n\nMichael Gove, the current Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, was a key ally of Mr Cameron in the early days and has served as MP for Surrey Heath since 2005.\n\nHe held the position of education secretary from 2010 to 2014 before he became lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice from 2015 to 2016 under Mr Cameron. He was later made environment secretary under Mrs May, and became levelling up secretary under Mr Johnson.\n\nMark Harper was made government chief whip in Mr Cameron’s government. In 2012 he was appointed immigration minister but stepped down from the post two years later after it was revealed his cleaner did not have permission to work in the UK.\n\nHe rejoined office as a minister for disabled people and in 2015 was promoted to chief whip. He remains in place as Transport Secretary under Rishi Sunak.\n\nAndrew Mitchell, the development minister at the Foreign Office, is also a familiar face.\n\nHe previously served as international development secretary from 2010 to 2012 under Mr Cameron and became Tory chief whip in 2012.\n\nHe made headlines in 2012 after a spat with the police, when he attempted to leave Downing Street on his bicycle. He admitted swearing at officers but denied calling them “plebs”, in an incident that became known as “plebgate”.\n\nHave any other ex-PMs returned to frontline politics?\n\nIn recent years, it has become highly unusual for a former PM to return to government, which partly explains the surprise over Lord Cameron’s return.\n\nHe is following in the footsteps of former PM Alec Douglas-Home, who became foreign secretary under Edward Heath in 1970.\n\nPrior to this, the last member of the House of Lords to be made foreign secretary was Peter Carrington, who served under Mrs Thatcher from 1979 until 1982. He resigned following Argentina’s invasion of the Falklands Islands.\n\nThe last time a politician who was not sitting in either the Lords or the Commons was made foreign secretary was in 1964, when Labour’s Harold Wilson chose Patrick Gordon Walker to fulfil the position.\n\nThe last former Conservative leader to return to the Cabinet was Ian Duncan Smith, who became work and pensions secretary in 2010.\n\nHe had served as leader of the opposition from 2001 until 2003, when he was pressured out of the role by his MPs.\n\nWhich women are in the top jobs?\n\nThe Cabinet is still being rearranged and new members are being initiated – but as it stands, there are now no women occupying the top four positions in Mr Sunak’s new team.\n\nFollowing Ms Braverman’s exit, for the first time since 2010, the top four jobs in government – Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary – are all held by men: Rishi Sunak, Jeremy Hunt, James Cleverly and David Cameron, respectively.\n\nRachel Maclean and Thérèse Coffey have also left the Cabinet while former cabinet minister Esther McVey has returned and will attend Cabinet as a minister without portfolio.\n\nWhen Mr Sunak initially put together his Cabinet in 2022, only 23 per cent of its members able to attend Cabinet meetings were women, down from nearly a third at the start of Ms Truss’s premiership and lower than under Mr Johnson, at 24 per cent, and Mrs May, at 30 per cent.\n\nThe highest ever rate of women in Cabinet was under Tony Blair in 2006-07, when the proportion of women in Cabinet was 36 per cent, The Guardian reported, and has been falling ever since."
