        "text": "Lord David Cameron has been appointed as foreign secretary in a cabinet reshuffle.\n\nThe former prime minister said he \"gladly accepted\" the offer from Rishi Sunak, despite having \"disagreed with some individual decisions\" by his successor.\n\nSpeaking to broadcasters, the peer said he accepted bringing back a former prime minister was \"not usual\", but he \"believes in public service\" and has \"useful experience\" to bring to the table.\n\nHe also called his new boss a \"strong and capable prime minister who is showing exemplary leadership at a difficult time\".\n\nLord Cameron added: \"I want to help him to deliver the security and prosperity our country needs and be part of the strongest possible team that serves the United Kingdom and that can be presented to the country when the general election is held.\"\n\nFollow live for updates and analysis on reshuffle\n\nThe ex-party leader is no longer an elected politician as he stood down as an MP in 2016, having called the Brexit referendum and his campaign to remain in the EU losing the vote.\n\nBut the government confirmed he will now enter the House of Lords as a life peer, giving him the opportunity to serve as a minister once more.\n\nDowning Street said his salary would be that of a secretary of state in the Lords - Â£104,360 per year - and added Mr Cameron would no longer take his prime ministerial allowance, and would not take the daily allowance given to other peers.\n\nThe shock announcement came after the sacking of Suella Braverman as home secretary, who provoked widespread condemnation for an article she wrote in The Times, accusing the police of \"playing favourites\" with left-wing groups over right-wing and national activists during protests.\n\nIt was the latest in a string of controversial remarks by the Tory MP, who is a popular member on the right of the party, including her claiming being homeless was a \"lifestyle choice\".\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts\n\nPosting on social media after the announcements, Mr Sunak said: \"Today we have built a united team ready to deliver the changes this country needs for the long term.\n\n\"Professionalism, integrity and experience - this is a team that will be bold in making the right decisions for our great country, not the easy ones.\"\n\nBut Labour's Pat McFadden took aim at the shake-up, saying: \"A few weeks ago, Rishi Sunak said David Cameron was part of a failed status quo, now he's bringing him back as his life raft.\n\n\"This puts to bed the prime minister's laughable claim to offer change from 13 years of Tory failure.\"\n\nKeep up to date with who's in and who's out in our list below.\n\nRead more:\n\nThree key questions about Cameron's comeback\n\nWho is in?\n\nLord Cameron, who brought the Tories back to power as part of a coalition with the Liberal Democrats in 2010, has returned to government as foreign secretary.\n\nMany of the party's One Nation MPs - closer to the centre of politics - may welcome the return of Lord Cameron, who secured them two victories at general elections and is well known internationally.\n\nBut he does not come without his controversies, including his austerity policies, decisions over Brexit, his push for closer ties with China, and accusations of lobbying when employed by Greensill.\n\nIn a lengthy statement released after his appointment, Lord Cameron said the UK faces a \"daunting set of international challenges\", including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nHe said: \"While I have been out of frontline politics for the last seven years, I hope that my experience - as Conservative leader for eleven years and prime minister for six - will assist me in helping the prime minister to meet these vital challenges.\"\n\nHaving served as foreign secretary since September last year - after being appointed by then prime minister Liz Truss - James Cleverly will now move to the Home Office as home secretary.\n\nSpeaking to broadcasters from his new department, he said it was a \"fantastic job\" and it would be \"a real privilege to serve\".\n\nHe added: \"I'm absolutely committed to stopping the boats, as we promised, but also making sure that everybody in the UK feels safe and secure, going around, going about their daily business, knowing that the government is here to protect them.\"\n\nBrought in as health secretary when Mr Sunak took over the leadership last October, Steve Barclay may have been hoping to keep his post.\n\nBut after a lot of rumours he may be dropped from cabinet altogether, he has now been announced as taking over the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\nTaking to social media after his appointment, Mr Barclay said he would be focusing on three areas - \"backing British farming and fishing; championing rural communities; and protecting the environment\".\n\nHe added: \"As an MP for a rural area I know how important these issues are to many people up and down our country.\"\n\nMr Barclay's old job has been handed over to Victoria Atkins, who will now be in charge of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).\n\nIt will be the first time Ms Atkins will hold a secretary of state role, having held more junior positions in the past.\n\nMost recently, she has been financial secretary to the Treasury.\n\nJeremy Hunt will remain chancellor, having been brought in by Ms Truss after the disaster of her mini-budget, and kept on by Mr Sunak.\n\nIt has been three years since this MP has found herself on the frontbench, and five years since she was in cabinet.\n\nBut Esther McVey has now made a return as a Cabinet Office minister and will attend cabinet with her colleagues.\n\nReports claim she is being brought in as \"the minister for common sense\", but this is not the official role.\n\nAnd it is not yet clear whether she will be allowed to continue her work as a GB News presenter.\n\nAfter holding a minor ministerial role at transport - albeit an important one, covering roads and local transport - Richard Holden is now a fully-fledged cabinet member.\n\nHe has become the new party chairman, and will be leading the Tories' next election campaign.\n\nFormer party chairman Greg Hands, who had been posting chairman-like attacks on social media against his opponents, has been demoted.\n\nNo longer leading on the electoral mission, he will hold a mid-range ministerial role at the Department for Business and Trade.\n\nMr Hands said he was \"disappointed to be leaving the job\", but revealed he was \"able to choose\" to return to work in trade - an area where he has been a minister three times before and \"a job I also love\".\n\nHe added: \"I even kept my business cards from last time.\"\n\nHaving been a junior minister at the Department for Work and Pensions, Laura Trott has now been made chief secretary to the Treasury.\n\nOusted from that role, is John Glen.\n\nA treasury colleague of Mr Sunak's and a close ally, there had been rumours of a bigger office of state.\n\nBut instead he now takes on the role of paymaster general - a defender and, sometimes, attack dog for the prime minister in the Commons.\n\nHaving worked as a junior minister in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities since September last year, Lee Rowley gets a promotion in this reshuffle to housing secretary.\n\nIt makes him the 16th person to hold the post since the Tories came to power in 2010.\n\nWho is out?\n\nAs we have reported, Ms Braverman has been sacked as home secretary and is no longer a minister of any kind, so will return to the backbenches as an MP.\n\nIn a statement released after her dismissal, Ms Braverman said: \"It has been the greatest privilege of my life to serve as home secretary. I will have more to say in due course.\"\n\nIt is the second time she has lost the job of home secretary after she resigned from Ms Truss's government for breaking the ministerial code.\n\nThe former housing minister announced on Twitter that she had been sacked - or \"asked to step down\".\n\nRachel Maclean said she was \"disappointed\" by Mr Sunak's decision, but added: \"It has been a privilege to hold the position and I wish my successor well.\"\n\nA former mayoral hopeful, Paul Scully has been sacked as the minister for London, as well as his role as minister for tech and digital economy.\n\nPosting on X, formerly known as Twitter, after the news broke, he said: \"Had better days at work. Waited for three buses to get in this morning and then got the Spanish Archer this evening from my two ministerial positions.\"\n\nHis London role has now been given to former party chairman Greg Hands.\n\nAfter she was seen walking into Number 10 this morning - following a brief pause to stroke Larry the cat - it was thought Environment Secretary Therese Coffey may have kept a role in government.\n\nBut an exchange of letters between her and the prime minister released two hours later shows she is off, telling Mr Sunak: \"I consider it is now the right time to step back from government.\"\n\nShe marked having served \"all five Conservative prime ministers\" since getting a role back in 2014, but said she had always been most proud of \"representing my constituents... and acting on local issues\".\n\nMr Sunak wrote back to \"express my gratitude to you for your years of dedicated ministerial service\", as well as her \"friendship to me personally\".\n\nSchools Minister Nick Gibb said he had quit the government and would not stand at the next general election, adding: \"I campaigned for Rishi last summer and I remain an enthusiastic supporter of the prime minister's leadership.\"\n\nHealth minister Neil O'Brien also announced he was stepping down - despite being due to play a key role in delivering Mr Sunak's ban on smoking and vaping in the younger generation.\n\nAnother health minister, Will Quince, has also stepped down from his role in a letter to the prime minister.\n\nIn it, he said due to his decision to stand down as an MP at the next election and recently becoming a specialist reserve officer in the army, it \"now feels like the right time to leave government\".\n\nTransport minister Jesse Norman has also quit, revealing in a letter he had let the chief whip know his plans to step down \"some months ago\".\n\nThe now former paymaster general Jeremy Quin said he was offered \"reassurance\" he could stay in government by the prime minister, but he has decided to \"step back to concentrate on projects in Horsham\" - his constituency.\n\nAnother MP to stand down from his post is George Freeman, who had been a science minister since February - but held a number of roles beforehand.\n\nIn a letter to the prime minister, he said he had made the decision \"with a heavy heart\", but added: \"The time has come for me to focus on my health, family wellbeing and life beyond the frontbench.\"\n\nJunior minister appointments\n\nThere were also a number of junior minister appointments in Mr Sunak's reshuffle.\n\nDame Andrea Leadsom, the former business secretary, was brought back into the fold as a junior minister in the Department of Health and Social Care.\n\nThe other appointments were:\n\nâ¢ Bim Afolami as an economic secretary to the Treasury\n\nâ¢ Gareth Bacon as a parliamentary under secretary of state in the Ministry of Justice\n\nâ¢ Saqib Bhatti as a parliamentary under secretary of state in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology\n\nâ¢ Anthony Browne as a parliamentary under secretary of State in the Department for Transport\n\nâ¢ Laura Farris as a parliamentary under secretary of state jointly in the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice;\n\nâ¢ Simon Hoare as a parliamentary under secretary of state in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities;\n\nâ¢ Fay Jones as a parliamentary under secretary of state in the Wales Office;\n\nâ¢ Paul Maynard as a parliamentary under secretary of state in the Department for Work and Pensions;\n\nâ¢ Robbie Moore as a parliamentary under secretary of state in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs;\n\nâ¢ Guy Opperman as a parliamentary under secretary of state in the Department for Transport.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, some other junior ministers have confirmed their departure from government, including Sarah Dines - who tweeted that she had been sacked as the parliamentary under secretary of state for safeguarding.\n\nA raft of new whips were also announced - senior figures in charge of party discipline.\n\nThey were:\n\nâ¢ Stuart Anderson as a government whip;\n\nâ¢ Dame Amanda Milling, Joy Morrissey and Mike Wood as Treasury whips;\n\nâ¢ And Aaron Bell, Mark fletcher, Mark Jenkinson and Suzanne Webb as assistant government whips.\n\nMeanwhile, Julie Marson announced she was resigning as a whip, saying it was a \"personal decision\"."
