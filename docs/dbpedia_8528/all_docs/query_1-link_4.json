        "text": "The article lists the records of prime ministers of the United Kingdom since 1721.\n\nThe prime minister with the longest single term was Robert Walpole, lasting 20 years and 315 days from 3 April 1721 until 11 February 1742.[1] This is also longer than the accumulated terms of any other prime minister.\n\nExcluding incumbent Keir Starmer, Liz Truss holds the record for the shortest unequivocal term of office, at 49 days. She was appointed by Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle on 6 September 2022, and officially resigned as prime minister to Charles III at Buckingham Palace on 25 October 2022. George Canning holds the record for the second shortest term in office, dying in office on 8 August 1827, 119 days after his appointment.\n\nHowever, the record of the shortest term may depend on the criteria used. Lord Bath technically assumed office for only two days (10–12 February 1746), but was unable to find more than one person who would agree to serve in his cabinet. A satirist of the time wrote: \"the minister to the astonishment of all wise men never transacted one rash thing; and, what is more marvellous, left as much money in the Treasury as he found in it.\" James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave was a prime minister for four days, 8–12 June 1757. However, neither Pulteney or Waldegrave formed an effective government, and so there are other contenders for the record of shortest term of office.\n\nIn November 1834, the Duke of Wellington declined to become prime minister for a second term, but formed a \"caretaker\" administration for 25 days (17 November – 9 December 1834) while his recommendation for the post, Robert Peel, returned from Europe. This caretaker administration is not necessarily considered a term of office in its own right, however.\n\nThe prime minister with the longest period between the start of their first appointment and the end of their final term was the Duke of Portland, whose first term began on 2 April 1783 and whose second and final term ended on 4 October 1809, a period of about 26 years and 6 months.\n\nThe Duke of Portland was out of office between his two terms for 23 years and 101 days, from 19 December 1783 to 31 March 1807.\n\nThe shortest interval (or \"fastest comeback\") was achieved by Henry Pelham, who resigned on 10 February 1746 but returned to office two days later (12 February) when Lord Bath had been invited to form a ministry but failed to do so. The shortest interval where an intervening ministry had been formed was achieved by Lord Melbourne, who was out of office after being dismissed on 14 November 1834, but returned 155 days (under six months) later, following the end of successor Robert Peel's first ministry on 18 April 1835.\n\nA prime minister's \"term\" is traditionally regarded as the period between the appointment and resignation, dismissal, or death, with the number of general elections taking place in the intervening period making no difference.\n\nThe only prime minister to serve four terms under that definition was William Ewart Gladstone:\n\n3 December 1868 – 20 February 1874\n\n23 April 1880 – 23 June 1885\n\n1 February – 25 July 1886\n\n15 August 1892 – 5 March 1894\n\nThree prime ministers have served three terms:\n\nThe Earl of Derby\n\n23 February 1852 – 17 December 1852\n\n20 February 1858 – 11 June 1859\n\n28 June 1866 – 25 February 1868\n\nThe Marquess of Salisbury\n\n23 June 1885 – 28 January 1886\n\n25 July 1886 – 11 August 1892\n\n25 June 1895 – 11 July 1902\n\nStanley Baldwin\n\n22 May 1923 – 22 January 1924\n\n4 November 1924 – 4 June 1929\n\n7 June 1935 – 28 May 1937\n\nThirteen prime ministers have served two terms: Winston Churchill, Benjamin Disraeli, Ramsay MacDonald, The Viscount Melbourne, The Duke of Newcastle, Lord Palmerston, Robert Peel, William Pitt the Younger, The Duke of Portland, The Marquess of Rockingham, Lord John Russell, The Duke of Wellington, and Harold Wilson.\n\nThe office of prime minister has coincided with the reigns of twelve British monarchs (including a Regency during the incapacity of George III from 1811 to his death in 1820), to whom the prime minister has been constitutionally head of government to the sovereign's headship of state.\n\nUntil 1837, the death of a sovereign led to Parliament being dissolved within six months which led to a general election. The results of such elections were:\n\n1727 – Robert Walpole held\n\n1761 – the Duke of Newcastle held\n\n1820 – Lord Liverpool held\n\n1830 – the Duke of Wellington defeated, Lord Grey appointed\n\n1837 – Lord Melbourne held\n\nStanley Baldwin is the only prime minister to have served three sovereigns, in succession: King George V, King Edward VIII, and King George VI.\n\nTen prime ministers served under two sovereigns, nine through being in office at transitions between reigns.\n\nRobert Walpole — George I and George II\n\nThe Duke of Newcastle — George II and George III\n\nLord Liverpool — George III and George IV\n\nThe Duke of Wellington — George IV and William IV\n\nLord Melbourne — William IV and Queen Victoria\n\nRobert Peel — William IV and Queen Victoria (not in office during transition of reign)\n\nLord Salisbury — Queen Victoria and Edward VII\n\nH. H. Asquith — Edward VII and George V\n\nWinston Churchill — George VI and Elizabeth II\n\nLiz Truss — Elizabeth II and Charles III\n\nElizabeth II – 15, from Winston Churchill to Liz Truss\n\nGeorge III – 14, from the Duke of Newcastle to Lord Liverpool\n\nVictoria – 10, from Lord Melbourne to Lord Salisbury\n\nGeorge II – 5, from Robert Walpole to the Duke of Newcastle\n\nGeorge V – 5, from H. H. Asquith to Stanley Baldwin\n\nGeorge IV – 4, from Lord Liverpool to the Duke of Wellington\n\nWilliam IV – 4, from the Duke of Wellington to Lord Melbourne\n\nEdward VII – 4, from Lord Salisbury to H. H. Asquith\n\nGeorge VI – 4, from Stanley Baldwin to Winston Churchill\n\nCharles III – 3, from Liz Truss to Keir Starmer\n\nGeorge I – 1, Robert Walpole\n\nEdward VIII – 1, Stanley Baldwin\n\nEight prime ministers have served office under sovereigns in whose own reigns they were born.\n\nSpencer Perceval – born 1762, served 1809–1812 – was assassinated in 1812; his is the only complete lifetime lived by a prime minister under a single sovereign\n\nLord Liverpool – born 1770, served 1812–1827\n\nLord Rosebery – born 1847, served 1894–1895\n\nSir Tony Blair – born 1953, served 1997–2007\n\nDavid Cameron – born 1966, served 2010–2016\n\nTheresa May – born 1956, served 2016–2019\n\nBoris Johnson – born 1964, served 2019–2022\n\nLiz Truss – born 1975, served 2022\n\nCameron, Johnson and Truss have the additional distinction of being younger than all of Elizabeth II's children.\n\nBoth Robert Walpole (1676–1745) and Lord Wilmington (c. 1673–1743) lived under the reigns of the same seven sovereigns: Charles II, James II, joint sovereigns William III and Mary II, Queen Anne, George I, and George II.\n\nWinston Churchill (1874–1965), Clement Attlee (1883–1967), Anthony Eden (1897–1977) and Harold Macmillan (1894–1986) all lived under the reigns of the same six sovereigns: Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II.\n\nThe record for the prime minister appointed latest into a monarch's reign is held by Liz Truss, who was appointed 70 years and 7 months into the reign of Elizabeth II. She also holds the record for the prime minister appointed closest to the end of a monarch's reign, being appointed two days before the death of Elizabeth II.\n\nThe record for the prime minister appointed soonest into the reign of a monarch goes to Rishi Sunak, the immediate successor of Liz Truss, appointed 47 days into the reign of Charles III.\n\nThese records all come about largely due to (but are not inherently dependent on) the unique circumstance of the end of Elizabeth II's record-breaking long reign coinciding with the start of Liz Truss' record-breaking short term. Various other records can be derived from these facts, such as the shortest time between the end of a prime minister's term and end of a monarch's reign being the 2 days between the resignation of Boris Johnson and death of Elizabeth II, or the shortest time between the start of a monarch's reign and end of a prime minister's term being the 47 days between the ascension of Charles III and the resignation of Liz Truss.\n\nThe youngest prime minister to be appointed was William Pitt the Younger on 19 December 1783 at the age of 24 years and 208 days.\n\nThe oldest prime minister to be appointed for the first time was Lord Palmerston on 6 February 1855 at the age of 70 years and 109 days.\n\nThe oldest prime minister to be appointed overall, and oldest to win a General Election, was William Ewart Gladstone, who was born on 29 December 1809 and appointed for the final time on 15 August 1892 at the age of 82 years and 231 days, following that year's General Election.\n\nThe youngest prime minister to leave office was the Duke of Grafton, who retired in 1770, aged 34. The oldest was Gladstone, who was 84 years at the time of his final retirement in 1894.\n\nGreatest age difference – Lord Rosebery (born 7 May 1847) was 37 years, 129 days younger than William Ewart Gladstone (born 29 December 1809) whom he succeeded after the final retirement of the latter in 1894.\n\nSmallest age difference – George Canning (born 11 April 1770) was 57 days senior to Lord Liverpool (born 7 June 1770), whom he succeeded after Liverpool retired in 1827. Canning and Liverpool were one of four pairs of immediately consecutive prime ministers who shared a birth year, the others being:\n\nWilliam Pitt the Younger (served 1783–1801 and 1804–1806) and Lord Grenville (served 1806–1807), both born in 1759\n\nLord Aberdeen (served 1852–1855) and Lord Palmerston (served 1855–1858 and 1859–1865), both born in 1784\n\nHarold Wilson (served 1964–1970 and 1974–1976) and Edward Heath (served 1970–1974), both born in 1916\n\nThe decade of the 1730s was the most productive for births of future prime ministers, with five: Lord Rockingham (born 1730, served 1765–1766 and 1782), Lord North (born 1732, served 1770–1782), the Duke of Grafton (born 1735, served 1768–1770), Lord Shelburne (born 1737, served 1782–1783), and the Duke of Portland (born 1738, served 1783 and 1807–1809).\n\nThe longest-lived prime minister was James Callaghan, Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, who was born on 27 March 1912 and died on 26 March 2005 at the age of 92 years 364 days, which was the day before his 93rd birthday. Prior to this the longest-living prime minister was Harold Macmillan, 1st Earl of Stockton, who was born on 10 February 1894 and died on 29 December 1986 (aged 92 years, 322 days).\n\nOf the eight former prime ministers currently alive, the oldest is John Major (born 29 March 1943), who is 81 years old. If he lives up to 28 March 2036, he will surpass Callaghan's record and he will become the longest-lived prime minister.\n\nThe shortest-lived prime minister was the Duke of Devonshire, who was born on 8 May 1720 and died on 2 October 1764 at the age of 44 years and 147 days.\n\nThe prime minister who lived the longest after leaving office for the final time was the Duke of Grafton, who left office on 28 January 1770. He died on 14 March 1811, 41 years and 45 days later.\n\nIn the last 100 years, the prime minister who lived the longest after leaving office was Edward Heath, whose term ended on 4 March 1974. He died on 17 July 2005, 31 years and 135 days later.\n\nThe prime minister who lived the shortest period after leaving office was Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who resigned on 3 April 1908 and died just 19 days later on 22 April 1908, while still resident in 10 Downing Street.\n\nThere have been two intervals between general elections, both in the 18th century, when on both occasions five successive prime ministers were in office.\n\nBetween the general elections of 1761 and 1768: the Duke of Newcastle (resigned 26 May 1762), Lord Bute (resigned 8 April 1763), George Grenville (resigned 10 July 1765), Lord Rockingham (resigned 30 July 1766) and Lord Chatham (until dissolution of the parliament).\n\nIn the shorter interval between the general elections of 1780 and 1784: Lord North (resigned 27 March 1782), Lord Rockingham (second ministry, died in office 1 July 1782), Lord Shelburne (resigned 26 March 1783), the Duke of Portland (resigned 18 December 1783) and William Pitt the Younger (until dissolution of the parliament).\n\nIn modern times, since members of the House of Lords ceased to hold prime ministerial office (after 1902), there have been two occasions where there were three prime ministers in office between general elections:\n\nBetween the general elections of 1935 and 1945: Stanley Baldwin (retired 28 May 1937), Neville Chamberlain (resigned 10 May, and subsequently died 1940) and Winston Churchill (until dissolution of the parliament). It is important to note that this was an unusually long period between general elections, with the election due in 1940 not being held as a consequence of the Second World War.\n\nBetween the general elections of 2019 and 2024: Boris Johnson (resigned 6 September 2022), Liz Truss (resigned 25 October 2022), and Rishi Sunak (until dissolution of the parliament).\n\nThe most general elections contested by an individual is six. H. H. Asquith contested the January 1910, December 1910, 1918, 1922, 1923 and the 1924 general elections.\n\nThe most general elections lost by an individual is four. Charles James Fox was unsuccessful after contesting the 1784, 1790, 1796 and 1802 general elections, and subsequently never became prime minister. The most general elections won by an individual is four. Robert Walpole, Lord Liverpool, William Ewart Gladstone, and Harold Wilson each won four general elections.\n\nThe youngest person to be on the losing side at a general election was Charles James Fox, who led his Whig Party to defeat in the 1784 general election when aged 35. The youngest prime minister to be on the losing side at a general election was Rishi Sunak, at 44 years and 54 days when the Conservative Party lost the 2024 general election.\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone, was the oldest, at 76 years, when his party lost the 1886 general election, although he returned to office in 1892. The oldest prime minister to be defeated without returning to office was Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, who was 75 when the Conservative Party lost the 1880 general election. Aged 70 years, 200 days, Jeremy Corbyn is the oldest person to be on the losing side of a general election without ever becoming prime minister when the Labour Party lost the 2019 general election.\n\nThe youngest prime minister to be on the winning side at a general election was William Pitt the Younger, who led the Tory Party to victory in the 1784 general election when aged 25. In recent years, the youngest prime minister to be on the winning side at a general election was David Cameron, who was 43 years and 209 days old when he led the Conservative Party to victory as the largest party in the 2010 general election.\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone, was the oldest. He was 82 years of age when he returned to office after his Liberal Party was successful in the 1892 general election. The oldest prime minister to be victorious at a general election for the first time was Winston Churchill, who was 75 years of age when his Conservative Party won the 1951 general election.\n\n15 former prime ministers never fought a general election while they held office (or to gain office), usually by serving terms sandwiched between the victors of elections and the prime ministers who faced the next elections. Chronologically they were:\n\nJohn Russell was unique in serving one entire term at Downing Street as Commons MP, when known as Lord John Russell (as younger son of a Duke of Bedford) in 1846–1852, and his second and last entirely as a member of the Lords as the 1st Earl Russell in 1865–1866, having been raised to the peerage between terms in 1861.\n\nWithout counting Lord Russell, eighteen prime ministers served their entire terms from the House of Lords where they were already members. In the following chronological list, those PMs who never served in the House of Commons during their political career are marked with an asterisk (*):\n\nThree prime ministers were elevated from the Commons to the House of Lords during their terms through being raised to the peerage.\n\nRobert Walpole – created 1st Earl of Orford five days before formally resigning in 1742\n\nWilliam Pitt the Elder – created 1st Earl of Chatham five days after taking office in 1766\n\nBenjamin Disraeli – created 1st Earl of Beaconsfield in 1876, two years after taking his second term of office in 1874\n\nLord North succeeded to his father's peerage as the 2nd Earl of Guilford in 1790 after being in office.\n\nAlec Douglas-Home disclaimed his hereditary peerage as the 14th Earl of Home four days after coming to office in 1963 (under the Peerage Act of that year), giving up his seat in the Lords, and subsequently sat in the Commons after succeeding in a by-election, pending which for 20 days he held office from neither House. He returned to the Lords when made a life peer as Baron Home of the Hirsel in 1974.\n\nThirteen prime ministers have served their entire terms as Members of the House of Commons but were elevated to the House of Lords afterwards by being created peers.\n\nHenry Addington – became the 1st Viscount Sidmouth in 1805\n\nArthur Balfour – became the 1st Earl of Balfour in 1922\n\nH. H. Asquith – became the 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith in 1925\n\nStanley Baldwin – became the 1st Earl Baldwin of Bewdley in 1937\n\nDavid Lloyd George – became the 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor in 1945 (22 years after being prime minister, although he did not live to take his seat in the Lords)\n\nClement Attlee – became the 1st Earl Attlee in 1955\n\nAnthony Eden – became the 1st Earl of Avon in 1961\n\nHarold Wilson – became Baron Wilson of Rievaulx in 1983 (life peer)\n\nHarold Macmillan – became the 1st Earl of Stockton in 1984\n\nJames Callaghan – became Baron Callaghan of Cardiff in 1987 (life peer)\n\nMargaret Thatcher – became Baroness Thatcher in 1992 (life peer)\n\nDavid Cameron – became Baron Cameron of Chipping Norton in 2023 (life peer)\n\nTheresa May – appointed a life peer in 2024\n\nIn contrast, 18 prime ministers preceding the current (Keir Starmer) have never become members of the House of Lords, including six of his eight immediate predecessors. Henry Pelham (served 1743 to his death in 1754) was the first to be a lifelong \"Commoner\". (The convention of prime ministers leading from the House of Commons only became established in the 20th century.)\n\nHolders of Irish peerages (with the exception of 28 Irish representative peers allowed after 1801, who were elected from among their peers) legally did not sit in the House of Lords in the Parliaments of Great Britain and the United Kingdom, but were allowed to sit in the House of Commons. Lord Palmerston was the only Irish peer to serve as prime minister, thus leading from the House of Commons.\n\nThe shortest period between entering Parliament and being appointed prime minister was achieved by William Pitt the Younger who became prime minister two years after first becoming an MP. The longest period of service as an MP before becoming prime minister was 47 years for Lord Palmerston.\n\nThe oldest debut of a future prime minister as MP was by Keir Starmer who was elected, aged 52 years 247 days, at general election in 2015.\n\nThe youngest at first election was Augustus FitzRoy, Earl of Euston (later the Duke of Grafton), who was elected on 10 December 1756 aged 21 years and 73 days. He also had the shortest period as an MP enjoyed by a prime minister, nearly five months, representing two successive seats (the first of which he only held for 11 days before being elected for his second) until going to the House of Lords when he succeeded his father as the 3rd Duke of Grafton on 6 May 1757, eleven years before his term of office began.\n\nWinston Churchill served the longest as MP, for a total of 63 years and 360 days, for five successive seats, between 1 October 1900 and retirement on 25 September 1964, excluding two intervals out of parliament (in 1908 and in 1922–1924). He retired as Father of the House. He was in the Commons throughout both his terms as prime minister, and his service covered the terms of eleven other prime ministers, from Lord Salisbury (second ministry) to Alec Douglas-Home, but did not serve under Bonar Law who was in office when Churchill was briefly out of parliament.\n\nDavid Lloyd George had the longest unbroken career as an MP, for one seat, Carnarvon Boroughs, from a by-election on 10 April 1890 until his death on 26 March 1945, a period of 54 years and 350 days. He received a peerage on 1 January 1945 but was not able to take his seat in the Lords. From 1929 he had been Father of the House. His career as an MP covered the terms of eleven other prime ministers, from Lord Salisbury (first ministry) to Winston Churchill (first ministry).\n\nAlec Douglas-Home had the longest interval between terms of service in the Commons. He automatically vacated his Commons seat at Lanark on 11 July 1951 by succeeding his father and going to the House of Lords as the 14th Earl of Home. He gained his next Commons seat at Kinross and Western Perthshire in a by-election on 7 November 1963, after becoming prime minister and disclaiming his hereditary peerage. The interval between these terms as MP was 12 years and 123 days. He had a previous interval out of the Commons between defeat in the 1945 general election and returning in that of 1950 over four years later.\n\nNo parliamentary constituency has been represented by more than one serving prime minister. Four future prime ministers sat for Newport, Isle of Wight (constituency abolished 1832): Lord Palmerston and Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington) in 1807–1809, George Canning in 1826–1827 and William Lamb, later Lord Melbourne in April–May 1827.\n\nIt is rare for veteran prime ministers sitting in the Commons to lose seats through electoral defeat at subsequent general elections. Those who have are:\n\nArthur Balfour (Manchester East) in 1906\n\nH. H. Asquith (East Fife) in 1918\n\nRamsay MacDonald (Seaham) in 1935\n\nLiz Truss (South West Norfolk) in 2024\n\nFive prime ministers through longest unbroken service became Father of the House. Henry Campbell-Bannerman was the first prime minister to achieve this status, uniquely while in office, in 1907. He was still serving as an MP when he died shortly after retiring as prime minister. The others listed in the table below became Father after the end of their terms. James Callaghan became Father only 4 years and 36 days after the end of his term in office, while at the other extreme Edward Heath became Father 18 years after the end of his.\n\nName Entered House Tenure as PM Became Father Left House Party Constituency Henry Campbell-Bannerman 1868 1905–1908 1907 1908 (died) Liberal Stirling Burghs David Lloyd George 1890 1916–1922 1929 1945 Liberal Caernarvon Boroughs Winston Churchill 1900\n\n1940–1945\n\n1951–1955\n\n1959 1964 Conservative\n\nOldham (1900–1906)\n\nManchester North West (1906–1908)\n\nDundee (1908–1922)\n\nEpping (1924–1945)\n\nWoodford (1945–1964)\n\nJames Callaghan 1945 1976–1979 1983 1987 Labour Cardiff South and Penarth Edward Heath 1950 1970–1974 1992 2001 Conservative Old Bexley and Sidcup\n\nFour prime ministers have been in office at a time when no former prime ministers were alive.\n\nRobert Walpole – As the first prime minister, for his entire term, April 1721 to February 1742.\n\nHenry Pelham – From the death of Robert Walpole in March 1745, until his own death in March 1754.\n\nThe Duke of Newcastle – For his entire first term, June 1754 to May 1756.\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone – From the death of Benjamin Disraeli in April 1881 until the end of his second term in June 1885.\n\nTwelve prime ministers have been in office at times when only one former prime minister has been alive at or for each time.\n\nLord Wilmington – From his appointment in February 1742 until his death in July 1743, only Robert Walpole was alive.\n\nHenry Pelham – From his appointment in August 1743 until the death of Robert Walpole, in March 1745, only Walpole was alive.\n\nThe Duke of Newcastle – In his second term, July 1757 to May 1762, only the Duke of Devonshire was alive.\n\nThe Duke of Devonshire – In his term, November 1756 to June 1757, only the Duke of Newcastle was alive.\n\nLord Russell – In his second term, October 1865 to June 1866, only Lord Derby was alive.\n\nLord Derby – In his third term, June 1866 to February 1868, only Lord Russell was alive.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli – From the death of Lord Russell in May 1878 until the end of his second term in April 1880, only Gladstone was alive.\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone – From his second appointment in April 1880 until the death of Benjamin Disraeli, in April 1881, only Disraeli was alive.

From oldest to youngest:\n\nName Date of birth Tenure Sir John Major (1943-03-29) 29 March 1943 (age 81) 1990–1997 Gordon Brown (1951-02-20) 20 February 1951 (age 73) 2007–2010 Sir Tony Blair (1953-05-06) 6 May 1953 (age 71) 1997–2007 Theresa May (1956-10-01) 1 October 1956 (age 67) 2016–2019 Boris Johnson (1964-06-19) 19 June 1964 (age 60) 2019–2022 David Cameron (1966-10-09) 9 October 1966 (age 57) 2010–2016 Liz Truss (1975-07-26) 26 July 1975 (age 49) 2022 Rishi Sunak MP (1980-05-12) 12 May 1980 (age 44) 2022–2024\n\nSunak is still a serving member of the House of Commons.\n\nThe most recent death of a former prime minister was that of Margaret Thatcher (served 1979–1990) on 8 April 2013 (aged 87).\n\nThe record for most prime ministers (current or former) to be members of the House of Commons at the same time is four: a sitting prime minister and three former prime ministers. This has occurred on five separate occasions:\n\nPrime minister Former prime ministers From To Duration Stanley Baldwin Asquith, Lloyd George, Law 20 May 1923 30 October 1923 163 days Ramsay MacDonald Asquith, Lloyd George, Baldwin 22 January 1924 9 October 1924 261 days Neville Chamberlain Lloyd George, MacDonald, Baldwin 28 May 1937 30 June 1937 33 days Margaret Thatcher Heath, Wilson, Callaghan 4 May 1979 13 May 1983 4 years 9 days Rishi Sunak May, Johnson, Truss 25 October 2022 9 June 2023 8 months 14 days\n\nThe fewest former prime ministers still sitting in the House of Commons is zero, which has happened on a number of occasions, most recently between 12 September 2016 when David Cameron left Parliament and 24 July 2019 when Theresa May left office.\n\nSeven prime ministers have died in office:\n\nLord Wilmington – died on 2 July 1743, aged 70\n\nHenry Pelham – died on 6 March 1754, aged 59\n\nLord Rockingham – died on 1 July 1782, aged 52\n\nWilliam Pitt the Younger – died on 23 January 1806, aged 46; the youngest to die in office\n\nSpencer Perceval – was assassinated by John Bellingham on 11 May 1812, aged 49\n\nGeorge Canning – died on 8 August 1827, aged 57\n\nLord Palmerston – died on 18 October 1865, aged 80 (two days before his 81st birthday); the oldest to die in office\n\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman and Bonar Law each resigned during their respective final illnesses. Law died five months after his resignation, but Campbell-Bannerman lived only another 19 days, dying at 10 Downing Street, the only prime minister ever to do so.\n\nOthers who died within one year of the end of their term were the Duke of Portland who died in 1809, 26 days after he left office, and Neville Chamberlain, who died in 1940, 183 days after he left office, of a cancer that was undiagnosed at the time of his resignation.\n\nSpencer Perceval is the only British prime minister to have been assassinated.\n\nLord Liverpool, Robert Peel, Margaret Thatcher, and John Major survived targeted assassination attempts in 1820, 1843, 1984, and 1991 respectively while in office, while Edward Heath survived one in 1974 after he had been ousted from office.[2]\n\nNine former prime ministers have died while their immediate successors were in office:\n\nThe Duke of Portland – died during Spencer Perceval's term\n\nRobert Peel – died during Lord John Russell's first term\n\nLord Aberdeen – died during Lord Palmerston's second term\n\nBenjamin Disraeli – died during William Ewart Gladstone's second term\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone – died during Lord Salisbury's third term\n\nLord Salisbury – died during Arthur Balfour's term\n\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman – died during H. H. Asquith's term\n\nBonar Law – died during Stanley Baldwin's first term\n\nNeville Chamberlain – died during Winston Churchill's first term\n\nAll of the above-listed prime ministers were older than their immediate successors. The Duke of Portland and Lord Aberdeen are the only ones among this list whose immediate successors also died in office.\n\nThe earliest prime minister to be an armed forces veteran was Henry Pelham (1743–1754), who had served as a volunteer soldier in James Dormer's Regiment of Dragoons during the Jacobite rising of 1715 and fought at the Battle of Preston that year against the Jacobite forces.\n\nThe most recent prime minister to be an armed forces veteran was James Callaghan (1976–1979), who served in the Royal Navy in the Second World War, from 1942 to 1945, seeing action with the East Indies Fleet and reaching the rank of Lieutenant. He was the only future prime minister to serve in the navy rather than the army.\n\nIn contrast to many nations, Britain has had only two prime ministers who have been military generals: Lord Shelburne (1782–1783), who was promoted from Lieutenant-General to full General in the British Army in the latter year, and the Duke of Wellington, who achieved the supreme rank of Field Marshal in 1813. He was prime minister twice, in 1828–1830 and 1834, in the interval between his two terms as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. During his military career he took part in some 60 battles, seeing more wartime combat than any other future prime minister.\n\nNo future prime ministers have yet served in the flying services, although Neville Chamberlain (1937–1940) and Winston Churchill (1940–1945 and 1951–1955) were honorary Air Commodores in the Auxiliary Air Force during their respective terms of office.\n\nActive members of the regular armed forces are disqualified for membership of the House of Commons at least since 1975.[3]\n\nHenry Pelham – Dormer's Regiment – fought in the Battle of Preston\n\nLord Rockingham – Colonel of volunteers raised against invasion from Scotland\n\nLord Shelburne – Colonel, 20th Foot – Canada, France, Germany\n\nThe Duke of Wellington – Field Marshal, Army – Flanders, India, Peninsular War, and Waterloo Campaign\n\nIn addition, the following served in home-based militia, volunteer, or yeomanry units raised during the same wars, but were not deployed abroad:\n\nWilliam Pitt the Younger – Colonel of volunteers (he was serving when he died in office in 1806)\n\nLord Grenville – Major of yeomanry, Lieutenant-Colonel of volunteers\n\nHenry Addington – Captain of volunteers\n\nSpencer Perceval – Volunteer, London and Westminster Light Horse\n\nLord Liverpool – Colonel of fencible cavalry, later of militia\n\nLord Goderich – Major of yeomanry\n\nRobert Peel – Captain of militia\n\nLord Melbourne – Major of volunteer infantry\n\nLord Palmerston – Captain of volunteers, Lieutenant-Colonel of militia\n\nLord Russell – Captain of militia\n\nWinston Churchill – Lieutenant, 4th Queen's Own Hussars, attached 21st Lancers\n\nWinston Churchill – Lieutenant, South African Light Horse and war correspondent (prisoner of war)\n\nWinston Churchill – Major, Grenadier Guards, later Lieutenant-Colonel, Royal Scots Fusiliers – Western Front\n\nClement Attlee – Major, South Lancashire Regiment – Gallipoli Campaign, Mesopotamian campaign and Western Front (wounded)\n\nAnthony Eden – Major, Rifle Brigade – Western Front\n\nHarold Macmillan – Captain, Grenadier Guards – Western Front (wounded)\n\nEdward Heath – Lieutenant-Colonel, Royal Artillery – North West Europe\n\nJames Callaghan – Lieutenant, Royal Navy – East Indies\n\nAlthough Eden and Alec Douglas-Home were Territorial Army officers at outbreak of war in 1939, neither was mobilised and the latter was invalided due to disabling spinal tuberculosis.\n\nThe following lost close relations in their lifetimes as a result of war:\n\nLord Rosebery – one son killed in action in the First World War\n\nH. H. Asquith – one son killed in action in the First World War (during his period in office)\n\nBonar Law – two sons killed in action in the First World War\n\nAnthony Eden – two brothers killed in action in the First World War, and one son killed in action in the Second World War\n\nAlec Douglas-Home – one brother killed on active service in the Second World War\n\nAlso:\n\nLord Bute – one male line grandson (born in his lifetime) died serving aboard ship in the Napoleonic War\n\nRobert Peel – one surviving son died serving in the Indian Rebellion of 1857\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone – two male line grandsons (born in his lifetime) were killed in action in the First World War\n\nLord Salisbury – four male line grandsons (born in his lifetime) were killed in action in the First World War\n\nThe most decorated British prime minister was Winston Churchill, KG, OM, CH, TD, who received a total of 38 orders, decorations and medals,[note 2] from the United Kingdom and thirteen other states (on continents of Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America). Ten were awarded for active service as an Army officer in Cuba, India, Egypt, South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium. The greater number of awards were given in recognition of his service as a minister of the British government.[4][note 3]\n\nChurchill was also the only British prime minister to have received a Nobel Prize (for Literature, in 1953).\n\nThe most widely decorated prime minister by the number of states from which he received honours was the Duke of Wellington, KG, GCB, GCH, who is known to have received 28 orders, decorations and medals from the United Kingdom and seventeen other states (all in Europe), in recognition of his military services.\n\nThe British order of knighthood most frequently conferred on prime ministers has been the Order of the Garter, of which 30 male prime ministers (beginning with Sir Robert Walpole and later including Sir Winston Churchill and Sir Anthony Eden) have been Knights Companion (KG), and the first female, Margaret Thatcher, a Lady Companion (LG) of the Order. Nine prime ministers, including Thatcher, received it after serving office. Currently, the only living knights among them are Sir John Major, knighted in 2005, and Sir Tony Blair, knighted in the 2022 New Year Honours. Current Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, having been knighted in 2014 before entering office.\n\nThe only prime minister to have received a British gallantry award was Anthony Eden, who won the Military Cross (MC) while serving in the army in the First World War, before entering parliament.[5][6]\n\nThe longest-married prime minister was James Callaghan, who was married to his wife Audrey for 66 years from 28 July 1938 until her death on 15 March 2005.\n\nFour prime ministers married while in office, three not being their first marriage:\n\nRobert Walpole to Maria Skerrett before 3 March 1738. She died after a miscarriage on 4 June that year, after at least 93 days' marriage, making this the shortest marriage ever held by a prime minister (although she previously cohabited as his mistress).\n\nThe Duke of Grafton to Elizabeth Wrottesley on 24 June 1769. She survived him, dying in 1822.\n\nLord Liverpool to Lady Mary Chester on 24 September 1822. She survived him.\n\nBoris Johnson married Carrie Symonds, his third wife, on 29 May 2021. He divorced both his first wife, Allegra Mostyn-Owen, and his second, Marina Wheeler.\n\nThe British prime minister widowed the longest is Lord Rosebery who died more than 38 years after his wife.\n\nRecently, the British prime minister widowed the longest is Harold Macmillan, who was widowed from 21 May 1966 to his death on 29 December 1986, a total of 21 years.\n\nThe British prime minister widowed the shortest is James Callaghan, who died on 26 March 2005. His wife, Audrey Callaghan, died on 15 March 2005, only 11 days before him.\n\nThree British prime ministers have been divorced.\n\nThe Duke of Grafton divorced his first wife, Anne (née Liddell), by Act of Parliament passed 23 March 1769, during his term of office, then remarried on 24 June that year to Elizabeth Wrottesley. (Anne remarried on 26 March 1769 to John FitzPatrick, 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory and died in 1804 in Grafton's lifetime.)\n\nAnthony Eden, divorced his first wife Beatrice (née Beckett) in 1950, then remarried two years later to Clarissa Spencer-Churchill on 14 August 1952, before his term of office began. (Beatrice never remarried and died in 1957 in Eden's lifetime.)\n\nBoris Johnson divorced his first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1993 and married Marina Wheeler two weeks later. In 2018, Johnson and Wheeler separated, finalising their divorce in November 2020 during Johnson's term of office.\n\nFour British prime ministers have been bachelors.\n\nThe 1st Earl of Wilmington\n\nWilliam Pitt the Younger\n\nArthur Balfour\n\nEdward Heath\n\nThe most prolific prime minister was apparently Lord Grey who in wedlock fathered ten sons and six daughters[7] in addition to one illegitimate daughter by Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire who was subsequently raised by Grey's parents.[8]\n\nFour prime ministers are known to have fathered children while in office: Lord John Russell (two sons, George (1848) and Francis (1849)), Tony Blair (one son, Leo (2000)), David Cameron (one daughter, Florence (2010)) and Boris Johnson (one son, Wilfred (2020) and one daughter, Romy (2021)).[9]\n\nRussell and Johnson also have the rare distinction of fathering further children after leaving Downing Street.[10] David Lloyd George possibly had a daughter with his mistress Frances Stevenson after leaving office, but the historical consensus is that it is unlikely that he was her father.[11]\n\nNo female prime minister has ever given birth in office.\n\nAt least 24 British prime ministers were related to at least one other prime minister by blood or marriage.\n\nTwo sets of father and son have successively held the office:\n\nLord Chatham (aka \"Pitt the Elder\") and William Pitt the Younger\n\nGeorge Grenville and William, Lord Grenville\n\nThe only brothers to hold the office were Henry Pelham (PM 1743–1754) and his older brother and immediate successor Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle (PM 1754–1756, 1757–1762).\n\nPitt the Younger and Lord Grenville (who directly succeeded the former in office) were the only set of full cousins to hold the office, their fathers being brothers-in-law.\n\nThere have been two blood uncle-nephew sets of prime ministers.\n\nGeorge Grenville and William Pitt the Younger\n\nRobert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury and Arthur Balfour, who succeeded Salisbury in office after the latter's last term. The phrase \"Bob's your uncle\" is said to have originated in connection with this set, from ministerial promotions Balfour gained under Salisbury.[12][13]\n\nLord Wilmington was two-greats uncle of Spencer Perceval, whose mother, Catherine (née Compton), Baroness Arden, was a blood great-niece of Wilmington.\n\nThe Duke of Portland, married in 1766 Lady Dorothy Cavendish, daughter of the Duke of Devonshire (who had died in 1764).\n\nPitt the Elder was married from 1754 to George Grenville's sister Hester.\n\nLord Palmerston was married from 1839 to Lord Melbourne's sister Emily, dowager Countess Cowper.\n\nWilliam Pitt the Elder married Hester Grenville who was the sister of George Grenville and the aunt of William Grenville, which makes William Pitt the Elder the uncle-in-law of William Grenville.\n\nWinston Churchill and Anthony Eden. In 1952, during Churchill's second term, Eden married Clarissa, daughter of John Strange Spencer-Churchill, Winston's brother, before succeeding to the office.\n\nLord Grenville was married from 1792 to Anne Pitt, daughter of Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford who was a nephew of William Pitt the Elder.\n\nAlec Douglas-Home was the great-great-great-grandson of Lord Grey.\n\nLord Russell and Alec Douglas-Home.\n\nHarold Macmillan was married from 1920 until 1966 to Dorothy Cavendish, who was a great-great-great-granddaughter of the Duke of Devonshire.\n\nRecord Institution Number of PMs First and most recent Notes School with most alumni prime ministers Eton College 20 Robert Walpole to Boris Johnson Harrow School has educated 7 prime ministers, most recently Winston Churchill University with most alumni prime ministers Oxford University 31 Lord Wilmington to Keir Starmer Cambridge University has educated 14 prime ministers, most recently Stanley Baldwin University college with most alumni prime ministers Christ Church, Oxford 13 George Grenville to Alec Douglas-Home Vocational institution with most prime ministers as students The Inns of Court 12 Lord Wilmington to Keir Starmer Of these, eight passed through Lincoln's Inn (William Pitt the Younger to Tony Blair)\n\nThe most popular degree course with future prime ministers is Classics, read by 7 PMs (Robert Peel to Boris Johnson). Six prime ministers read PPE (Harold Wilson to Rishi Sunak).\n\nThe first prime minister never to have been a university graduate was the Duke of Devonshire (served 1756–1757); the most recent is John Major (served 1990–1997).\n\nOne British prime minister did not speak English as a first language – David Lloyd George, who was raised in a Welsh-speaking family.\n\nMany prime ministers have understood Latin and/or Ancient Greek, which were traditionally taught as part of a classics education. The most recent prime minister noted to have studied these languages is Boris Johnson.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, French was the primary language of diplomacy, and most prime ministers until this time had at least some understanding of it. Benjamin Disraeli was notable for being unable to speak the language and addressing diplomatic conferences in English.[14]\n\nPrime ministers who have been specifically noted as speaking languages other than English include:\n\nWinston Churchill, who spoke some French.[15]\n\nAnthony Eden, who spoke Arabic, French, German, Persian and some Turkish.[16]\n\nTony Blair, who speaks French.[17]\n\nBoris Johnson, who as well as Latin and Ancient Greek speaks some French, German, Italian and Spanish.[18]\n\nRishi Sunak, who speaks some Hindi and Punjabi.[19]\n\nAfter being appointed prime minister by King Charles III on 25 October 2022, Rishi Sunak became one of the wealthiest prime ministers ever, with an estimated combined fortune with his wife of £730 million.[20]\n\nThe richest prime minister was Lord Derby, with a personal fortune of over £7 million, equivalent to £871 million in 2023.[21]\n\nThe poorest prime minister was William Pitt the Younger, who was £40,000 (now over £4 million) in debt by 1800.[22][23]\n\nBefore becoming prime minister, Robert Walpole was impeached and convicted in 1712 for \"a high breach of trust and notorious corruption\" and sentenced to six months imprisonment in the Tower of London.[24]\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, Tony Blair became the first sitting prime minister to be questioned as part of a criminal investigation, following the Cash-for-Honours scandal, but this was not under caution.[25][26]\n\nIn 2022, Boris Johnson received a fixed-penalty notice relating to violations of the COVID-19 lockdown regulations in the Partygate scandal, becoming the first prime minister found to have broken the law in office. Future prime minister Rishi Sunak, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, was also fined at the same time.[27]\n\nIn January 2023, during his period in office, Rishi Sunak was issued a fixed penalty notice by Lancashire Police for failing to wear a seatbelt in his ministerial car while filming an Instagram video to promote his government's levelling up policy.[28] Sunak hence became the second prime minister in history to be found to have broken the law in office.[29]\n\nThere have been three female prime ministers, all Conservative. They have led the United Kingdom for a total of 14 years, 268 days.\n\nMargaret Thatcher – served May 1979 – November 1990, 11 years, 208 days.\n\nTheresa May – served July 2016 – July 2019, 3 years, 11 days.\n\nLiz Truss – served September–October 2022, 49 days.\n\nBetween Cameron's appointment in 2010 and Sunak's resignation in 2024, male and female Prime Ministers alternated.\n\nTwo prime ministers were born in Ireland, both in Dublin in the Kingdom of Ireland before the Act of Union 1801.\n\nLord Shelburne – born in Dublin in 1737\n\nThe Duke of Wellington – born at 6 Merrion Street, Dublin, in 1769\n\nTwo further prime ministers were born outside of the British Isles.\n\nBonar Law – born in the colony of New Brunswick in what is now Canada, the first prime minister born outside the British Isles\n\nBoris Johnson – born in New York City in the United States, the first American-born prime minister and the first to be born outside English/British territory\n\nAll other prime ministers were born in Great Britain (46 in England and 7 in Scotland).
