        "text": "ANKARA\n\nNew UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday tapped one-time barrister David Lammy for a key Cabinet position, that of foreign secretary.\n\nLammy, 52, has been a Labour MP for Tottenham since 2000.\n\nHe is known for his progressive politics and his advocacy for social justice, equality, and human rights.\n\nHe has been a vocal critic of racial injustice and has championed causes such as the Windrush Generation, opposition to Brexit, and tackling the climate crisis.\n\nHis journey to the upper echelons of British politics began with his legal career.\n\nAfter graduating from the Harvard Law School in the US, he became a barrister.\n\nHis transition to politics was marked by his election to Parliament in a 2000 by-election, where he quickly made a name for himself as a skilled orator and advocate for his constituents.\n\nKey political milestones\n\nDuring his political career, Lammy has held several key positions.\n\nHe served as culture minister under then-Premier Tony Blair from 2005 to 2007, where he oversaw cultural initiatives.\n\nDuring his tenure, he played a pivotal role in promoting London's successful bid for the 2012 Olympics and enhancing the UK's cultural diplomacy.\n\nLater, under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, he took on the role of higher education minister in 2007-2010.\n\nHe has been a vocal critic of racial injustice and has worked on issues of equality and diversity.\n\nIn addition to his ministerial roles, he has been a prominent backbencher.\n\nHe spearheaded the campaign to secure Windrush Day, celebrated on June 22 to honor the contributions of the Windrush Generation – arrivals in the UK from Caribbean countries between 1948 and 1973.\n\nHe has also been a key voice in debates on Brexit, climate change, and human rights.\n\nTurbulent waters\n\nAs foreign secretary, Lammy faces a myriad of global challenges.\n\nThe geopolitical landscape is fraught with complexities, from the ongoing Russian war in Ukraine to the UK's post-Brexit relations with the EU.\n\nHis diplomatic skills and his ability to navigate these turbulent waters will be crucial in shaping British foreign policy.\n\nHe steps into a role previously held by a diverse array of figures, each leaving their own mark on the UK’s foreign policy.\n\nHe was preceded by David Cameron, a former prime minister.\n\nBefore Cameron, Liz Truss filled the post, stressing a robust response to “Russian aggression” and advocating stronger economic partnerships worldwide.\n\nLammy’s appointment as foreign secretary marks a significant moment in British politics."
