        "text": "Oliver replaces Andy Coulson, and will be employed as a special adviser.\n\nOliver is 41 and has been the controller of BBC Global News since June 2010. Before that he was editor of 'BBC News at Ten' and 'BBC News at Six', Britain's two most-watched news programmes.\n\nThe Prime Minister said: \"I am very pleased that Craig Oliver is to become the new director of communications at 10 Downing Street. Craig has formidable experience as a broadcast journalist. He will do an excellent job in explaining and communicating the Government's programme.\"\n\nOliver said: \"I'm delighted to be joining David Cameron and his team at such an exciting and challenging time. It's difficult to leave the BBC after a fascinating few years â€“ but this is an opportunity I can't turn down.\""
