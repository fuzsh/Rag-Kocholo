        "text": "George Osborne is among 46 former colleagues and allies rewarded in David Cameron's resignation honours list.\n\nThe former chancellor has been made a Companion of Honour, while Tory MPs Oliver Letwin and Patrick McLoughlin are among those who have been knighted.\n\nMr Cameron's ex-spin doctor Craig Oliver and Samantha Cameron's adviser Isabel Spearman are also on the list.\n\nThe SNP called the list \"a form of personal patronage\"; Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said it was \"full of cronies\".\n\nA row broke out after details of the list were leaked to the Sunday Times, including rewards for No 10 staff, party donors and Remain campaigners.\n\nGuide to the Honours\n\nThirteen new Conservative peers have also been created, alongside two crossbench peers and there is one Labour nomination for Shami Chakrabarti, former director of civil liberties group Liberty.\n\nMs Chakrabarti, who recently concluded an inquiry into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, said she was \"honoured to accept [Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn's challenge and opportunity to help hold the government to account\".\n\nBut the appointment was criticised by Marie van der Zyl, of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, who said it was \"beyond disappointing\" she had been offered a peerage by Labour \"following her so-called independent inquiry\". \"The report, which was weak in several areas, now seems to have been rewarded with an honour,\" Ms van del Zyl said.\n\nOpposition MPs called for reform of the honours system after the list was leaked but Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will not intervene in the resignation honours because that would \"set a very bad precedent\".\n\nThe full list of Mr Cameron's resignation honours, external was published after mounting criticism that the former prime minister was to reward his political allies.\n\nMr Osborne, chancellor of the exchequer from 2010 to July 2016, has been admitted to the Order of the Companions of Honour - a distinction which is given for service of conspicuous national importance and is limited to 65 people.\n\nRecipients may write the initials CH after their name.\n\nTory party chairman Mr McLoughlin, who was formerly transport secretary, ex-cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon and Craig Oliver, Mr Cameron's former communications director, are knighted. Former environment secretary Caroline Spelman becomes a Dame.\n\nIsabel Spearman, who was employed as a special adviser to Mrs Cameron, has been made an OBE. Thea Rogers, a special adviser to Mr Osborne, has received the same award.\n\nMeanwhile, Will Straw, executive director of the Britain Stronger in Europe group which led the failed EU Remain campaign, becomes a CBE for political and public service."
