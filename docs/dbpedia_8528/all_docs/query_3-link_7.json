        "text": "David Cameron’s director of communications, Craig Oliver, is publishing an insider’s account of the EU referendum campaign with his memoir, Unleashing Demons.\n\nThe book, serialised in the Mail on Sunday, offers behind-the-scenes glimpses of the Conservative party’s biggest players in the vote.\n\nOn referendum night\n\nAs the voting closed, polls and experts predicted a narrow win for remain, but early results showed this was off the mark. “Sterling plummets. I feel a wave of sickness wash through me,” Oliver writes. Later, David Cameron texts: “How worried should we be?”\n\nBy 3am the BBC puts the result at “precisely 50-50”. “The sensation is one of, having been sure of my path, stepping into quicksand and being slowly pulled under,” Oliver recalls.\n\nAt 4am, it’s clear leave has won, and Cameron looks “tired” and “resigned in every sense”. He tells aides: “The trouble with all options other than going immediately is they collapse like a concertina. And the truth is, I wouldn’t believe in it.”\n\nThe prospect of remaining in No 10 is “miserable”, Cameron says. “I’d be saying, ‘Come and punch me as hard as you like.’”\n\nCameron braves a joke about it a few hours later, arriving in Downing Street at 7am saying: “Well, that didn’t go according to plan!”\n\nAn hour later, he resigned.\n\nOn Theresa May\n\nOliver is grudgingly admiring of Theresa May’s “smart strategy” over the referendum. Her “Sphinx-like approach” kept Cameron and his inner circle guessing for weeks over which side she would back, despite Cameron’s personal plea to her to “come off the fence”. During the campaign she maddened them by refusing to firmly back the remain camp.\n\n“In terms of pure politics you have to hand it to her, she is playing it well,” Oliver writes. “It’s making life uncomfortable for us.”\n\nWhen May finally agrees to deliver a pro-remain speech, it is so equivocal that campaign director Will Straw texts Oliver, asking: “Are we sure May’s not an agent for the other side!?”\n\nDiscussing her approach on a flight in mid-January, Cameron “wistfully” comments: “Well, it may work for her. She could be PM in six months’ time.” Five-and-a-half months later, Oliver points out, May moved into Downing Street, having become the “last one standing”.\n\nOn Boris Johnson\n\nDavid Cameron believed Johnson was a “confused Inner”, Oliver writes. The former mayor of London tells Cameron he will back Brexit, then confesses to doubts, finally texting the PM to say he will definitely support leave just nine minutes before his press conference. “I’m struck by how reckless Boris is being – we could just blurt all of this out at any time,” Oliver records.\n\nIn the end, Downing Street keeps Johnson’s “wobble” quiet. Cameron “tells me that Boris’s final message was clear he doesn’t expect to win, believing Brexit will be ‘crushed’”, Oliver writes.\n\nThe campaign becomes a “blue-on-blue soap opera”. When Michael Gove and Johnson attack Cameron’s performance on immigration, it “feels like an act of war, motivated by an intention to kill”, writes Oliver – a personal attack that they would “hesitate to say” against an opposition party. Cameron thinks it “depressing beyond belief” and “deeply maddening”.\n\nOn Michael Gove\n\nOliver is scathing about Gove, describing him as a “political suicide bomber” and accusing him of “vaulting ambition and a preparedness to mislead”.\n\nHe describes how “DC”, as Oliver refers to David Cameron, was “utterly confident” that loyal Gove would back remain. When it becomes clear he will not, “DC isn’t angry but there is a tinge of sadness in his voice as he tries to make light of it: ‘That’s him off the Christmas card list,’ he says.”\n\nCameron is casually dismissive of Gove. “Can you imagine him ever being left in charge of the country?” he asks, after a paper suggests he should be deputy prime minister. At another meeting over the Conservative succession, “DC says he is prone to ‘infarctions’ [seizures]”.\n\nEven as he calls Gove to concede the referendum, Cameron wrongfoots him. “I’ll make a statement shortly. It’ll really just say: result received and accepted and it must be delivered,” he tells him. He does not mention he plans to resign."
