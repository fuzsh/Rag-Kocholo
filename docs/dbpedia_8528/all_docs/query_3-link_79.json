        "text": "Cision is thrilled to announce that industry heavyweight Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron’s former director of communications, will headline as CommsCon’s guest keynote speaker.\n\nCurrently a senior managing director at Teneo Blue Rubicon, Oliver oversaw the former prime minister’s comms strategy for the majority of his time in office. He assumed the role at a time when the news cycle was moving beyond a 24/7 environment to a full 360-degree news chamber with deadlines minimised to the time it takes to compose a tweet.\n\nOn a day full of discussion about the changing nature of the comms profession, he will explore how governments, businesses and institutions can develop strategies to manage the compressed, 360-news cycle and cut through the echo chamber of social media.\n\nOliver headlines a day where the industry’s best and brightest will examine why marketing disciplines are converging and how earned media can claim its rightful place in the marketing mix. The company has partnered with PRWeek, CIPR Greater London and AMEC to provide the insights and information to help communicators ride the crest of the earned media wave.\n\nTo hear can’t-miss insight and advice from Sir Craig Oliver, as well as from a host of other fantastic industry professionals, register below to secure your free place at CommsCon."
