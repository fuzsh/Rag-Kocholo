        "text": "Shorter than All Out War\n\nI feel after listening to 6 hours of All out war, and all of this, the central message regarding the background of Brexit is: you can't do that much about immigration which wouldn't be as bad as fear mongering would have you believe and there are remedies that could be pursued ... maybe. And the economic impact is likely to be bad. Leave has no plan and Remain couldn't sell its message. Also ... the media.\n\nThe book was shorter, but felt like it contained the same information as All Out War, with a blow by blow account, but trimming a lot of bloat. Arguably this was more partisan, but you got the point.\n\nOverall I probably recommend against this title also, except for the fans (though I am unsure of what), as the substance is lacking and it feels mostly like a whinge with nuggets at best buried at lower levels.\n\nGreat Back Story\n\nWould you listen to Unleashing Demons again? Why?\n\nProbably not but only because the pace on modern political events will out pace the story written by the author.\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of Unleashing Demons?\n\nThe realization that nothing David Cameron did would likely have saved the membership of the UK in the EU.\n\nWhich character – as performed by Craig Oliver – was your favorite?\n\nHis revelations of the character of (in his opinion) the major players in the campaign for and against leaving the EU\n\nWhat’s the most interesting tidbit you’ve picked up from this book?\n\nThat the current prime minister most likely was for leave but hid it well in the run up to the referendum.\n\nHonest account for what it does and doesn't say\n\nWould you consider the audio edition of Unleashing Demons to be better than the print version?\n\nYes\n\nWhat was the most compelling aspect of this narrative?\n\nOliver was as inside the Remain campaign as was possible to be. To all intents and purposes, he *ran* it as much as Cameron did.\n\nWhat about Craig Oliver’s performance did you like?\n\nAn honest, likeable and enthusiastic reader. Oliver makes you feel his pain and frustration as the Remain campaign starts to unravel.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nAs honest an account of the Remain campaign as this is, it's written very much from a Tory (Conservative) view point. Prime Minister, David Cameron (usually referred to as \"DC\" or \"PM\" in the narrative) and Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne (usually just \"George\") are portrayed as level headed, reasonable and honest politicians. But then who wouldn't be when set against Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage?\n\nFor Oliver, the failure of the Remain came down mainly to the Leave campaign switching their focus to immigration, once they's realised (correctly) that their own economic arguments were being seen as the nonsense that they were. Remain had no real response to this, other than to say that yes, they realised that immigration is a problem but destroying the economy wasn't the way to deal with it. By Oliver's own admission, this was a weak counter.\n\nOliver also spends much of the narrative railing against the pro-Brexit bias of much of the British media. This is, of course, hypocrisy of the highest order. That same media was just as biased in favour of the Tories during the previous year's General Election, and Oliver does admit that \"I took what I could get\" from them at that time.\n\nThe major weakness of Oliver's story is his failure to concede, or even comprehend, how Cameron and Osborne brought the whole mess upon themselves. Quite literally, in that it was Cameron who called the referendum in the first place. Oliver deal with this quite early in the book, and his explanation is breathtaking in its born to rule, Tory arrogance: in his view, Cameron had to call the referendum because without it \"the Conservative Party, and therefore the country, would have been ungovernable\". Got that, everyone? It's not that Cameron put the interests of his party before the interests of the country, oh no. In fact, that would be impossible because the Tories and the country are actually one and the same, indivisible; what's good for one must be good for the other.\n\nAnother glaring omission is the severe austerity measures that Cameron and Osborne imposed in the UK from 2010 onwards, the wake of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The cruel cuts, which as ever, fell disproportionally on the poor, when it was rich bankers who caused the GFC in the first place. When scratching his head, trying work out why people had voted for Leave, at no point does Oliver acknowledge that the resentment against austerity might have had anything to do with it.\n\nOliver ends his book with Cameron being chauffeured out of 10 Downing Street for the last time. \"I wonder\", muses Oliver, \"how history will judge him?\" I don't wonder. Cameron was an idiot and history will judge him as one."
