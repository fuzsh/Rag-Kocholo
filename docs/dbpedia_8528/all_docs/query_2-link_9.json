        "text": "Prime Minister David Cameron has appointed two new senior members of staff at 10 Downing Street.\n\nAndrew Cooper, founder of polling company Populus is the new director of political strategy. He is a special advisor and it is a political posting.\n\nFormer KPMG partner Paul Kirby will be the new Head of Policy Development.\n\nThe appointments are part of a reshuffle of Mr Cameron's top team following last month's departure of communications chief Andy Coulson.\n\nMr Kirby is a civil servant and will lead a team of eight others in formulating government policy.\n\nFormer BBC executive Craig Oliver has been appointed as Mr Coulson's replacement, but has not yet started work, a Downing Street spokesman said."
