On the day that David Cameron resigns as an MP, his former director of communications passes his verdict on the former Prime Minister.

Sir Craig Oliver served as the Downing Street Director of Communications from 2011 and 2016, seeing up close how the MP for Witney ran the country. For his assessment of how Mr Cameron did during his tenure as leader, he borrowed a phrase that George Osborne apparently used to describe him; “the quiet revolutionary.”

To support this title, Oliver points to; Cameron’s willingness to enter into a coalition government; ensuring economic security; attempting to tackle the deficit; to make major changes to the welfare and education systems, and be the PM who oversaw gay marriage. And finally he made the Conservative party electable again.

Knowing Mr Cameron as he does, Sir Craig believes that he is putting “duty and loyalty” first, conscious that his presence in the party could serve as a distraction from Theresa May’s efforts to lead the Conservatives and negotiate Brexit.

However, in spite of his close knowledge of the former PM, Sir Craig refused to speculate on what David Cameron will do next.
