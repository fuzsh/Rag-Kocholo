        "text": "Very few Bible scholars believe now in the historicity of the book of Esther, but what is really incomprehensible is that their conclusion is based only on the following prejudice: this story looks like a fairy tale, consequently, it is a fairy tale! There is no chronological investigation despite the fact that chronology is the backbone of history and there has been no historical research among archaeological witnesses despite the fact that apart from ancient texts there is no witness. Worse still, to establish their chronology, historians have blind faith in the Babylonian king lists which are nevertheless false (reporting no usurpation and no co-regency). Additionally, in order to establish historical truth, they regularly quote the official propaganda of the time which is very often misleading. Yet it is easy to check in the tablets of Persepolis that Mordecai was an eminent royal scribe called Marduka who worked with Tatennai, the governor beyond the River, under the direction of Uštanu, the satrap of Babylon, during the years 17 to 32 of Darius. Similarly, the narrative of Herodotus regarding Amestris (a name meaning ‘vigorous woman’ in Old Persian), Xerxes' unique wife and only queen known in Persia, corresponds in many ways to Esther (‘star’ in Old Persian”) despite the unfavourable and biased description of the Persian queen. https://www.lulu.com/shop/gerard-gertoux/queen-esther-wife-of-xerxes-fairy-tale-or-real-history/paperback/product-1wr5gkr2.html\n\nThis monograph is based on the article: Dating the Reigns of Xerxes and Artaxerxes, published in: Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis Series Archaeologica 40, 2018, pp. 179-206 (https://www.academia.edu/37218165/). A summary of this article has been published in the journal: NABU 2019-4, p. 179 (https://www.academia.edu/42902553/), which summarizes the main arguments establishing the reign of Xerxes over the period 496-475 BCE (10-year co-regency with the reign of Darius I) instead of 486-465 BCE (conventional chronology). The revision of the Achaemenid chronology radically changes the interpretation of the articles devoted to Esther. Indeed, most academic studies consider that Esther's story has no historical foundation and that this book is a fiction. However, Amestris (510-426), wife of Xerxes and mother of Artaxerxes I, was the mother of Darius A (488-475), crown prince in 475 BCE, of Artaxerxes (485-425) who became king of Persia (475-424) and of Hystaspes II (486-425?) who became satrapist of Bactria (475-425?). She was queen consort at the side of Artaxerxes I (Nehemiah 2:6; Life of Themistocles 29:6). Ctesias sometimes portrayed her as a sensitive and peaceful queen (Persica F13§34,42,44) and Plato as a wise ruler (First Alcibiad 123b-124b). She is the only queen to have received a royal tomb in the Acropolis of Susa (a unique case in history). The head of Queen Amestris in lapis lazuli, found in Persepolis and dated to the 5th century BCE, can be seen in the National Museum of Iran (ref 1274-7719). On a seal dated 5th century BCE (AO 22359), Queen Amestris stands before Atossa (who was the wife of Darius and the mother of Xerxes), she was seen sitting on a throne when she married Xerxes in 489 BCE, the exact date of Esther's marriage according to the Bible (Est 2:1-18). She also appears as a crowned queen on a gold ring (British Museum ANE 124005). His bronze \"bathtub\" coffin, found in the Acropolis of Susa (http://www.achemenet.com/fr/visit/?/suse/tombe), is exactly oriented towards Jerusalem (azimuth 264° west from north), which is in harmony with the biblical text (1Ki 8:44; Dan 6:10). According to the size of her skeleton, Queen Esther was about 1.60 m tall and the golden crown (Louvre Sb 2760) she wore around her head had a diameter of 20.2 cm. This prestigious Persian crown was also worn by King Darius III at the Battle of Issus. Finally, before the reign of Xerxes, there were no Jewish officials in the Persian administration, but after his reign there were hundreds. Conclusion: Amestris, Amā-strī \"vigorous woman\" in old Persian, was an authentic Jewish queen named Amā-stara \"star (Esther) woman\", the name Esther being the Persian form (Stara) of the Babylonian name Ishtar (the goddess \"Star\") which gave the Greek word aster \"star\".\n\nThe Book of Esther is set in the Persian capital of Susa during the reign of Xerxes (Ahasuerus in Hebrew) and tells the story of how a young Jewish woman living in Persia becomes queen. Most modern scholars consider the Book of Esther to be a kind of historical novel and have debated its historical value by comparing the book with classical sources. But what if we do a close reading while comparing also to non-Greek sources? In a recent article published in Persica Antiqua, I have argued that a significant part of the historical material of the Book of Esther is in line with evidence that most of the classical sources are unaware of. This paper is a short summary of that study.\n\nMost modern scholars consider the Book of Esther to be a kind of historical novel; hence, the historicity of many of its characters and events is highly debatable. While the present study does not intend to defend the historicity of the book, it does review it again by using sources that have received less attention in this regard. That the Book of Esther has a lot of Persian realia in it is not news, but most scholars have debated its historical value by comparing the book with classical sources. However, the present article aims to show how a significant part of the historical material of the Book of Esther is in line with evidence that if not all, but most of the classical sources are unaware of, and accepting this fact means that the author of the Masoretic Esther had direct or indirect access to sources associated with the Persian state. In order to prove this issue, using the descriptive-analytical method based on library studies, the primary focus of this article has been on sources other than the Greek ones, mainly Achaemenian royal inscriptions, and economic and legal documents found in different parts of the Persian Empire.\n\nPraise for Ancient Persia and the Book of Esther 'In this accessible and well-illustrated volume, Llewellyn-Jones provides a detailed cultural and iconographic companion to the biblical book of Esther, one which helpfully illuminates for historians and biblical scholars alike the broader Achaemenid context of the narrative. ' Matthew A. Collins, University of Chester, UK 'Biblical scholars know that the Persian context is relevant and significant for understanding the rich narrative of Esther, but most are not trained in the art and archaeology of the Achaemenid world. Llewellyn-Jones, who is so well at home in the Persian cultural context, makes a major contribution to scholarship on Esther, and to the Persian period in biblical studies more generally, with this book. This is indispensable for anyone working on Esther. ' Aaron Koller, Yeshiva University, USA 'Lloyd Llewellyn Jones uses his profound knowledge of ancient Persian culture to shine new light on the book of Esther, highlighting the rich iconography of the Persian court that flavours the Judaeo-Christian text, and setting the Biblical story within the context of the region to provide deeper understanding of this fascinating book."
