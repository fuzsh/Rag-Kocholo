        "text": "Perhaps I shouldn’t question the opinion of one of Australia’s most prominent literary critics, but it seems to me that Geordie Williamson labelling the characterisation of this novel as easy binaries in his review* misses the point…\n\nThe White Girl is a story about people who’ve grown up in a binary world, among the powerless, the poor, the uneducated and the dispossessed. They have learned from their history and their own experiences not to trust people in positions of power – policemen, The Welfare, teachers, missionaries and bureaucrats. The story is set in the Menzies era, but today, they could add Centrelink to that list. And this attitude that the powerless inherit when they are young and sometimes carry with them into adulthood can translate into assumptions about the people they meet: good or evil; kindly or cruel; trustworthy or not; helpful or exploitative. Those who are fortunate need to understand that while it isn’t always a fair assumption to make, this short-hand binary view of the world can be a form of self-protection for an underclass. Depicting it in literature is a legitimate thing to do.\n\nAnd in presenting this world the way Indigenous people too often experience it, Tony Birch isn’t lapsing into easy binaries: he’s a highly skilled, award-winning author who knows exactly what he’s doing: quite apart from using historically valid sources for his content, (which I’ve certainly come across in Indigenous memoir) Birch is not only offering a window into what can be an Indigenous view of the world, he’s also using recognisable character types just like Charles Dickens did when exposing social problems to an indifferent society. (But Birch is a good deal more economical than Dickens, the book is only 272 pages long, and written in piercingly deft contemporary prose).\n\nOn the verge of (illegally) leaving town Odette takes her granddaughter Sissy to visit the cemetery:\n\nAfter visiting with her parents Odette walked Sissy past the other graves, explaining the connection she had to family and Odette’s childhood friends.\n\n‘You need to know all of these people,’ she said, ‘and you must remember them.’\n\nSissy looked around at the headstones. ‘There’s a lot of people here, Nan. How will I remember all of them?’\n\n‘Through the stories,’ Odette said. ‘I’m telling them to you, and it will be your job to remember. It’s just like the story in the book you’re reading. The story of the dog from Africa. You told me about that today, and already I can remember it. Our stories are not written in any books, which means you’ll need to keep telling them to your own family one day.’ (p.131)\n\nYes.\n\nAnd how to do that for a wider audience, is an author’s choice.\n\nOdette and Sissy need a permit to leave their home on the margins of a (fictional) country town called Deane. Odette, who spent years in domestic service, is now a self-employed artist who sells her greeting cards to a retailer in the nearest town, and despite the privations of their shabby home, she’s a responsible and loving parent to the motherless Sissy. But they need to escape the attention of an officious new policemen called Owen, who’s replacing a lazy drunk called Shea, because Sissy, for reasons readers will soon recognise, has the white skin of a father she’s never known. What should shock readers is that Odette’s well-founded fear that the authorities will separate her from Sissy, takes place during the era of my childhood and within living memory of many others who read the book. Odette is not her granddaughter’s guardian, and neither is Sissy’s long-vanished mother. Because this family is Indigenous, Sissy is automatically a ward of the State. This is occurring during the early 1960s, when the movement to grant long-overdue citizenship to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders was emerging. The circumstances of this novel are not ancient history, or First Contact history, or Colonial history. They are mid-20th century history, post WW2 history, and a history that was taking place at the same time that I, a child born 10,000 miles away, was granted an Australian citizenship denied to the First Nations people of this land. If you’ve ever wondered why Indigenous women are so strong, it’s because they grew up without the basic human and political rights that White Australians had, and they haven’t forgotten it. Last year’s NAIDOC theme was ‘Because of her, we can’ and Birch’s novel is an homage to Indigenous women who’ve held families together, against the odds.\n\nI don’t want to give Williamson’s review more air than it deserves, but his suggestion that The White Girl is aesthetically deficient while offering its readers a thrill to righteousness is offensive and patronising. Should we not feel indignant that fellow Australians and the First Peoples of this land were treated this way? Are these stories not worthy of telling?\n\nWhen Williamson writes that the characters are shunted to their allotted places like sheep being run through a drafting race, and that the author has a responsibility to explode the assumption that we creatures are so easily tagged in the first place he implies that Birch lacks nuance. Did he read this dialogue between Odette and a friend called Jack?\n\nA policeman has been rude to Odette, but she feels no hostility towards him:\n\n‘…And that policeman, I’d have been surprised if the man had treated me any differently than he did. I don’t have the time to take blame out on a fella like him.’\n\n‘But he was rude to you. How’s he without blame?’\n\n”Because they’re the ones we deal with every day of our lives. Police. Not the Welfare or the ones who write the rules for the government. Think if you were the police, Jack, knowing that one day you’d be told to go into a house and take kiddies away from their family. If you were to treat people with any decency, you couldn’t do that job. This fella giving us a hard time, he needs to be angry at us. Maybe even hate us. The only way they can get by.’ (p.164)\n\nSince when have critics been in the business of telling authors what their responsibility is?\n\nMy advice is to get hold of a copy of The White Girl and read it. Read it for its vivid characterisation, the tension in the plot, and emotional investment in a story that tells fundamental truths. Read it for a window on a different world.\n\nRead it to see Odette and Sissy negotiating rush-hour crowds on the city train station: their inexperience with city life reminded me of Amy’s move to Sydney in Olga Master’s Amy’s Children.\n\nRead it to discover how riches are relative:\n\n…Odette had no time to hide the pile of notes sitting on the table. Sissy had never seen so much money. She sat down at the table, rested her chin in her hands, and stared at the bank notes.\n\n‘Hey Nan. You see all this?’\n\n‘I do indeed, Sweet. I just counted it.’\n\n‘Who does it belong to?’\n\n‘Well, technically me. But seeing as we’re related, I guess it belongs to you as well,’ she smiled.\n\n‘That’s a lot of money there, Nan. We must be rich.’\n\n‘Well, in the world out there,’ Odette said, nodding towards the front door, ‘it wouldn’t make us rich, although it would keep us out of harm. But if you’re talking about a black woman with a long dead husband and a grandchild to care for, that’s a different story. Yeah, I suppose we’re rich.’ (p. 127)\n\nAnd read it to discover the story behind that bath on the front cover!\n\n*In The Australian.

I have published it because I assume he holds the copyright, but if this is not correct, I will amend the comment.\n\nAuthor: Tony Birch\n\nTitle: The White Girl\n\nPublisher: UQP (University of Queensland Press, 2019, 272 pages\n\nISBN: 9780702260384\n\nReview copy courtesy of UQP\n\nAvailable direct from UQP and Fishpond: The White Girl\n\n[Posted so that all readers can see what I wrote about The White Girl}\n\n“Torpid beneath an inevitable sun, its dray-wide streets a study in shadow and glare, the country town of Deane — primary setting of Tony Birch’s new novel The White Girl, his fourth in a dozen years — is vividly rendered for a place that does not really exist. This is probably ­because some version of it has sprung up in so many parts of this country that only a generic instance is big enough to contain them all.\n\nMany readers, then, will be familiar with the mid-20th century template. An inland river town built on agriculture and mining, just starting to feel the first hints of postwar decline. Deane’s picture theatre closed two years back, about the time televisions first appeared in store windows at the regional centre, 40 miles away. Mounting diversions from the river for farming purposes have begun to affect the body of water. Its flow — and so the region’s broader ecology — has begun to stutter.\n\nAnd the old racial certitudes that drew a colour bar through town like a ruler, granting the local constabulary powers of ­association and movement over the few remaining indigenous locals and their children, much as the religious missions that raised the older generation once possessed? They are beginning to stutter, too.\n\nRead Next\n\nQ&A recap\n\n‘Authoritarian? Ridiculous’\n\nJESSICA CORTIS\n\nIn the cities, political and social ferment has begun to sweat beneath the crisply ironed pieties of the Menzies era. All those minorities, from European migrants to working women, whose existence has been seen by some as a threat to the established order, have begun changing society by dint of merely existing, by being woven into the fabric of a changing nation.\n\nOdette Brown knows nothing of this. She has barely left the town of Deane since she arrived as a child, growing up the daughter of a smart and able Aboriginal man who was later killed in an accident at the local quarry. She spent most of her days in service to white households: the once-prosperous farmers of the district, a number of them now fallen on harder times.\n\nAll these years later Odette still lives in one of the old quarry shacks, an old woman alone aside from her granddaughter, ­Cecily, otherwise known as Sissy. The pair live a quiet, isolated existence, subsistence-level in some respects — a bath once a week in an outdoor tub; their only income arriving in the form of postal orders from the white woman who commissions gift card artworks from Odette — but richly loving and companionable.\n\nThe missing link here is Sissy’s mother, Lila. It seems likely from the evidence readers are given that Lila was raped by a local white man when she was a teen. Sissy was the resulting issue: a white girl, almost, hence the novel’s title. Odette lost Lila to the wider world when Sissy was still a baby, with only a few letters to crumb her trail in the years since. The narrative’s opening finds the two left-behinds bound the more tightly by that essential loss.\n\nBirch’s vision of country Australia in this period is Bakelite-smooth. His is a quiet, steady and unerring sense of time and place. Everything that needs to be present, from the jam tins in which Odette keeps her earnings — since, as an Aboriginal woman, she is not permitted to have a bank account of her own — to the bread-and-dripping fry-up that she treats herself each Sunday morning (in mixed memory of her mission upbringing), resonates with pure ordinariness. Birch intuits that cultural memory migrates into objects over time and he curates them deftly in establishing the scene.\n\nBut it is the spare cast of town characters that move the story forward; Henry Lamb, for example, with his ancient sweat-stained Akubra and beloved canine companion Rowdy.\n\nAs a child Henry suffered a head injury that kicked all but some mechanical genius and a deal of fundamental kindness out of him. The butt of jokes and pranks for generations of young men in the town, he has true sympathy for Odette and does what he can to help the pair.\n\nOr chain-smoking, plain-speaking Millie Khan, lifelong friend of Odette, married to the descendant of Afghan cameleers. She lives in a former saddlery slowly being swallowed by a dry billabong, determined always to assert independence from a society that sees a black woman married to a Muslim as a double affront.\n\nBirch balances this skeleton staff of small-town decency against some moral invertebrates — such as Bill Shea, the outgoing local constable, an ineffectual drunk — and some true-blue monsters. The Kane family, pere et fils, are failed farmers whose bitterness towards the world is now directed against those, such as Odette and Henry, who remain among the few they can look down upon.\n\nOdette worked for the family, back in the day. She witnessed the violence Joe Kane meted out to his sons, turning one, George, into a victim and the other, Aaron, into a sadist. When Odette discovers that Aaron has begun to take an interest in Sissy, she fears a repeat of past injuries. Despite feeling the weight of the years and some ominous new pains, the doughty old woman steels herself for one more fight.\n\nWhat Odette has reckoned on is the possibility that the worst person in town may not bear the Kane surname. Newly arrived police Sergeant Lowe is cold and ruthless, curdled with pathologies. He spent the postwar years in ­Europe, ostensibly assisting with displaced persons but, the novel creepily infers, mainly using his power to manipulate and hurt the innocent.\n\nIn other words, he is a creature perfectly designed to work for an authority that claims all indigenous children in the state as its wards. Lowe draws up a list of young people in the township who may require his “guardianship” and it is the knowledge that this man is after her granddaughter that inspires Odette’s most desperate move: to flee the town for the city, in frail hopes of finding Lila and passing Sissy back into her care.\n\nBirch brings us to this point with minimal fuss, but the temperature of the story soon rises. For all the author’s limpid grace as a prose writer, his calm can disguise a mean rhetorical uppercut. When Lowe discovers that the pair have absconded despite his directives to remain, he is furious. Rounding on Milly Khan on the street, he lets rip:\n\n“The Child, Cecily, must be returned to Deane, for her own Welfare.”\n\n“Welfare?” Milly replies incredulously. “Oh, you’ve looked after the welfare of our young girls for a long time now. Most of them are dead, disappeared, or were sent mad by what you did to them in the institutions. That’s not welfare, Sergeant. I think your own law would call that murder.”\n\nNote how starkly black and white is delineated here. It almost begs some “what ifs”. What if Sergeant Lowe spoke not as a monster — what if his cold authoritarianism came out of a sincere if misplaced belief that what he was doing was kind? What if Millie Kahn were not a statue of rectitude but a woman who had internalised some guilt or uncertainty in relation to these same “young girls”?\n\nIt is possible, as a reader, to thrill to righteousness while feeling aesthetically short-changed: and this, for all is virtues, can sometimes be the experience when reading The White Girl. The characters are shunted to their allotted places like sheep being run through a drafting race.\n\nThe local doctor in Deane who examines Milly is a Jewish Holocaust survivor. He’s good. The spinster daughter of local graziers encountered on the train to the city is bad. The presumably gay bureaucrat who works to furnish Odette with freedom of movement documents is good. The lecherous, form-guide brandishing owner of the cafe where Lila used to work is bad.\n\nIt is fair to observe, of course, that a man who has suffered the horror of the death camps is likelier to stand up for outcasts elsewhere. It is also only appropriate that someone obliged to disguise their sexual orientation would have sympathy for an old woman attempting to help her daughter temporarily pass as white to save her.\n\nThe responsibility of the author is not, however, simply to switch easy binaries, so that old Menzies-era con­victions are replaced by a rainbow parade of contem­porary merits. It is to explode the assumption that we creatures are so easily tagged in the first place. That said, to whom is the author ultimately responsible? Returning to this fiction of uncommon moral simplicity, it is worth asking whether Birch might have made certain decisions in the writing of The White Girl that had nothing to do with tweaking the palates of those belonging to what Nicolas Rothwell once called “the reading classes”.\n\nThe sincerity and clarity of this novelmay mean some smoothing where wrinkles are required. But as a testament to the real calamities that befell generations of indigenous Australians as a direct result of white paternalism and bunk racial ideology — as a record of the pain and hurt suffered, and of the immense bravery and care shown by so many women in communities such as Deane — the novel rings clear as a bell.”\n\nGeordie Williamson is The Australian’s chief literary critic."
