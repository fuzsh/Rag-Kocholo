        "text": "Joseph Morgan of The CW’s The Originals is now a married man after he wed his fiancée Persia White in Jamaica on July 5.\n\nThe hunky vampire actor tied the knot after he proposed to girlfriend White back in May of this year. The pair met on the set of The Vampire Diaries, the series that The Originals spun off from, during Season 3. Morgan plays original vampire Klaus Mikaelson on both series, while White portrayed the mom of Bonnie Bennett, played by Diaries series regular Kat Graham.\n\nThe Originals’ Joseph Morgan interview: Good news for Klaroline fans >>\n\nThe intimate wedding took place in Ocho Rios and had a “very rustic feel to it,” White told People.\n\n“There was nothing about it that was overwhelming or very huge or fabulous in that way,” White added. “We tried to keep everything really intimate and beautiful and sort of going along with nature.”\n\nFor their wedding attire, the pair opted for a classical look. White wore a Vera Wang princess-style gown, while Morgan sported a black-and-ivory tux by Miguel Wilson. “And then I had a bow tie,” Morgan quipped. “In fact, the bow tie was the first bow tie I’ve ever tied myself, so I was quite proud of that.”\n\nThe Originals and more get full season orders >>\n\nAt the ceremony, which took place at a private villa, there were only 26 guests and it was just steps away from where the couple actually got engaged. “I think one of the reasons we picked it was because we love the ocean and we both grew up by the sea,” White said. “To be by the sea was wonderful. And the people of Jamaica are just wonderful.”\n\nAfter a beautiful wedding, an awesome honeymoon in Negril and hopefully some more TV projects together, the newlyweds hope to start a family and have “little, cute mini-Josephs.”\n\nThis is the first wedding for Morgan and the second for White, who divorced husband Saul Williams in January 2009 after just one year of marriage. White also has a daughter named Mecca from a previous relationship."
