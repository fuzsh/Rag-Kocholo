However, that only dates the Empire from 330 AD, at the founding of Constantinople, for 1123 years. From 27 BC, with the reign of Augustus, the Empire lasted 1479 years until 1453. If we add that to 1776, we get 3255 AD. The original Star Trek is only supposed to take place in 2265.\n\nDecadence\n\nEveryone knows why the Roman Empire fell. It became \"decadent,\" meaning weak and immoral. The Romans were so busy at their orgies (often with their siblings), throwing Christians to the lions, poisoning their spouses, parents, and children, and eating exotic parts of animals (like hummingbird tongues), in between visits to the vomitorium so they could eat more, that they didn't notice all the Germans gathering on the frontiers.\n\nThen the ruthless pagan Germans rode in, trampled under their horses' hooves the few poor debauched legionnaires who remained, still foolishly fighting on foot, sacked Rome, destroyed civilization, overthrew the last emperor in 476, and ushered in the Dark Ages, from which Europe only emerged with the Renaissance, a thousand years later, when gunpowder finally could defeat mounted warriors. As the late columnist Joseph Sobran once wrote: Christianity built a new civilization on the \"ruins\" of the old.\n\nAlthough accepted by no real historians, this cartoonish image looms large in popular discourse, is lovingly promoted in the movies, like Federico Fellini's Satyricon (1970), is often assumed in political and moral debates -- where some practice (e.g. pornography) or policy (e.g. gay rights) is frequently said to represent the decadence that brought about the Fall of Rome -- and is inadvertently often reinforced by various kinds of serious scholarship.\n\nA fine book by George C. Brauer, Jr., published in 1967, was called The Young Emperors: Rome, A.D. 193-244. It was about a period in which several emperors were in fact young men, usually coming to the throne by heredity or because of some other family connections. Reissued in 1995, the very same book was retitled: The Decadent Emperors: Power and Depravity in Third-Century Rome. This is a sexier title; and, since the \"young emperors\" of the period did include a couple of the more vicious, alarming, and bizarre characters among Roman emperors, Caracalla and Elagabalus, one is not disappointed to read the book for evidence of Roman decadence.\n\nSimilarly, another very fine book, by Thomas Sowell, Migrations and Cultures, A World View, published in 1996, states flatly in its section on Jewish history, \"the last Roman emperor was overthrown in 476 A.D.\" [p. 238].\n\nReinforcing the idea that the German invaders were pagan hordes who only slowly came to Christianity, morality, and civilization, Sowell says: \"After the Visigoths began to abandon paganism for Christianity, beginning with the Visigothic King Reccared in 589, a new era began\" [p. 244].\n\nIn 2022, we get The Mad Emperor, Heliogabalus and the Decadence of Rome, by Harry Sidebottom [A Oneworld Book]. Sidebottom goes directly for one of the most outrageous \"decadent\" Emperors,\" \"Elagabalus,\" using what used to be the more common version of his name \"Heliogabalus\" -- who was perhaps not as murderous as Caligula, but entertaining enough in his own right -- with the name of the Syrian sun god \"El\" interchangeable with Greek \"Helios.\"\n\nA little digging, however, and the whole idea of Roman \"decadence\" begins to look more than a little peculiar. The list of particularly cruel, dissolute, and outrageous emperors -- Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Caracalla, and Elagabalus -- although impressive, comes to an end more than two hundred years (222-476) before the \"Fall\" of the Empire -- and a two hour History Channel special, \"Roman Vice,\" didn't even manage to make it past Nero -- implying that the whole history of the Empire was just more of same. Yet Elagabalus was himself followed by his far more sober cousin, Alexander Severus, who was remembered with considerable respect -- with the odd circumstance that both were followed around by their mothers, who were killed with them. Nero, who was also put on the Throne by his mother, famously killed her himself, after several tries.\n\nPerhaps we can pick out some instances of \"decadence\" in the following years; but the violence, ferocity, and duplicity of some of the later 3rd and 4th century emperors were not, by themselves, the sort of things that Bob Guccione (1930-2010), for example, was looking for [Caligula, 1979]. He needed them in the bedroom (or at least the bath), not just on the battlefield. So if Rome fell because Elagabalus wanted to marry a gladiator, then the effect was delayed, extraordinarily, by longer than it took the United States to get from George Washington to Bill Clinton -- whose transgressions, even the sexual ones, although noteworthy, didn't rise to the level of the adventures of Elagabalus -- until perhaps more information, presently concealed, comes out about Clinton's time on the \"Lolita Island\" of Jeffrey Epstein (1953-2019). Back in Roman history, what happened during that period, from Elagabalus to the \"Fall\"?\n\nWell, with the Germans, indeed, on the frontiers (along with the Persians, Alans, etc.), the emperors up until 395 were mostly soldiers. They were a pretty grim lot, usually engaged in pretty grim business. Diocletian (284-305) doesn't seem to have spent much time in the vomitorium -- though, as the only emperor ever to actually retire from office, he did build a nice retirement village at Split (Spalatum) in Dalmatia (now Croatia). He said he would rather grow vegetables than try to regain the throne. Not our idea of the typical Roman emperor. More like Candide. Ethnically, Diocletian is supposed, like several of his colleagues, to have been an Illyrian, a people whose modern descedants might be the Albanians. Some scholars have backed off from this; and we now can see these Emperors called \"Danubian\" rather than \"Illyrian.\" Albanians must be offended.\n\nBe that as it may, he is the first emperor (after, well, Φίλιππος ὁ Ἀράβος, Philip the Arab) with a certifiably (and not all that unusual) Greek name: Διοκλῆς, Dioclēs.\n\nDiocletian and the Tetrarchs, Corner of St. Mark's Cathedral, Venice, 2019; odd foot remained in Constantinople, found in situ\n\nThis is a name similar in form to Ἡρακλῆς, Heracles (Hēras kléos, the \"fame/glory of Hera\"), with the stem for \"Zeus\" substituted for the stem for \"Hera\" (Diós kléos, the \"fame/glory of Zeus\"). This was Latinized to Diocletianus when Dioclēs became Emperor.\n\nDiocletian managed to go his entire reign with only one brief, ceremonial visit to Rome, in 303 -- on the Vicennalia, the 20th anniversary of his rule. The possession of the City, or residence there, was no longer of much political significance. Nobody had to \"march on Rome,\" as Septimius Severus did, to become Emperor. Indeed, Julian, the last pagan emperor, never visited Rome during his short reign. Born in Constantinople, and drawn to Greece, he seems to have never visited Rome in his whole life, although passing through the north of Italy, and Milan, on his way to Trier.\n\nAccording to the poet Claudian (Claudius Claudianus, c.370-404), by 404 only three emperors in the previous century had visited Rome -- Constantine I (306-337) in 312, Constantius II in 353, and Theodosius I in 389. Actually, Constantine returned in 326 for his own Vicennalia; but in the 63 years from then until 389, the visit of Constantius II in 353 for one month was the only occasion of an Emperor's presence in the City. These visits were so rare that they got a special name: An Adventus, \"Arrival,\" was what such a visit came to be called. The last actual Adventus was that of Constans II in 663.\n\nSome 5th century Western emperors, with their horizons reduced to Italy, spent more time there. It is now hard to imagine how Romans would have been uninterested in visiting Rome. Wasn't there stuff to see? Well, by then, there was stuff to see all over the Empire.\n\nNeither of the Vicennalia visits of Diocletian and Constantine went well. In Diocletian's case, seats at the Circus collapsed and 13,000 were killed. The mood of the people was ugly, in part because of their obvious neglect by the emperors. With Constantine, we don't know quite what happened, but shortly after his arrival both his son Crispus and his wife Fausta either died mysteriously or were executed. The population was hostile once again, and Constantine left the City, never to return. He began the construction of Constantinople in 328.\n\nConstantine, of course, had converted to Christianity -- or at least had given it official toleration, protection, and then promotion -- and all the charming archaic features of paganism, naked athletes at the Olympics, priestesses of Apollo in trances, ithyphallic Hermae on street corners, priests of Astarte cutting off their genitals, orgiastic Dionysiacs, etc., began to disappear.\n\nThe empire of 476 was therefore, except for philosophers and yokels (paganus, \"pagan,\" means \"rural\"), in an official Christian hammerlock. Steady political and legal pressure would eventually eradicate the old religions and gods. The Roman army, which had previously been strongly Mithraic, showed its sympathies by electing the Christian Jovian on the death of the pagan Julian in 363, and then the Christian Valentinian I, whose son Gratian would remove the Altar of Victory from the Senate in Rome in 382.\n\nIndeed, at the time, the accusation was that Christianity itself was the cause of the empire's problems. What did they expect when they scorned Victory herself? St. Augustine of Hippo answered this charge in the City of God by denying that it even mattered -- only the City of God was eternal -- even as the Vandals took Hippo in the year of his own death. The charge was later taken up by Edward Gibbon, who saw religious superstition as more enervating than the antics of any Caligula or Elagabalus. Such a charge was still being repeated by James G. Frazer in his classic The Golden Bough [1890, 1900, 1906-15, note].\n\nThe picture of ferocious pagan hordes overcoming, not intoxicated catamites (κίναιδοι), but ascetic and otherworldly Christians is a little different from the standard one, but perhaps it would do....if not for another little problem: The Goths, who defeated and killed the emperor Valens at Adrianople in 378, and who later established kingdoms in Spain (the Visigoths, 416-711) and Italy (the Ostrogoths, 493-553), were themselves literate Christians, converted by St. Wulfila (or Ulfilas, c.311-c.383, \"Little Wolf\"), who also designed the alphabet to write Gothic (which thus became the first written Germanic language) [note].\n\nWhen the Visigoths sacked Rome in 410, the Empire was understandably shocked, but these savage hordes....respected the churches! They had entered the Empire by permission as refugees from the Huns and only went to war because of their mistreatment: They had been reduced by the Romans to selling themselves into slavery for the sake of meals of rat meat -- at a rate of one rat for one slave. This now makes one wonder whom to call the barbarians.\n\nThe Visigothic king Reccared in 589 was not converting from paganism to Christianity, but from the heterodox Arian form of Christianity, advocated by Wulfila himself, to orthodox Catholicism. That made the Pope very happy, but it did not exactly effect a sea change in Visigothic religious practice. Similarly, the other German tribes who did the most damage to the Empire, the Vandals and Lombards, had also been Christians for some time. The only major German tribe that wasn't Christian was the Franks, and they never even got near Rome, much less sacked it. The Franks mostly stepped in after Roman authority had already collapsed in Gaul; but the conversion of the Frankish king Clovis (481-511) to Catholicism does make it sound like German tribes catching up with civilization. Not quite.\n\nMausoleum of Theodoric,\n\nRavenna, 2019\n\nThe Ostrogothic king Theodoric (493-526) oversaw as much civilization in Italy as it had had in a while. Great literature was produced by Cassiodorus (c.490-c.583) and Boethius (476-524). Theodoric's tomb at Ravenna later became the model for a chapel built by Charlemagne at Aachen -- and an equestrian statue of Theodoric was actually removed to Aachen by Charlemagne. Italy certainly suffered more from the Roman reconquest (536-552) than from the Germanic occupation. Like Diocletian, Theodoric only bothered to visit the City of Rome once, on the 30th anniversary of his rule.\n\nAnother problem is with the \"Fall\" itself. No German chieftain sacked Rome or killed an emperor in 476. Instead, an officer in the army, Odoacer, Ὀδόακρος, who did happen to be German, deposed the commander of the army (the Magister Militum, \"Master of Soliders\"), Orestes, Ὀρέστης. Since the titular emperor was Orestes's young son, known as \"Augustulus,\" the \"little Augustus,\" Odoacer sent him packing to a monastery.\n\nThese events, also, took place, not in Rome, but in Ravenna, which had been the capital for most of the century. In the normal course of things, Odoacer would have set up his own titular emperor and then seen about getting recognition from the eastern emperor in Constantinople. That would be difficult, since the eastern emperor already recognized someone else as western emperor: Julius Nepos, who had been overthrown by Orestes in 475 but who was still holding out in Dalmatia (in Diocletian's own retirement palace, which made a very nice fortified town all through the Middle Ages).\n\nAs it happened, Odoacer decided not to bother with a titular western emperor. He sent the imperial regalia back to Constantinople and informed the emperor that he would be content with his Roman military title and recognition as a German king. The emperor agreed, and before long Odoacer took care of Julius Nepos as well (480). Thus Rome (or Ravenna) \"fell\" in 476 (or 480) less with a bang than with a whimper, and without noticeable institutional change or unaccustomed violence -- the fall of Constantinople in 1453 would be a far different matter, in every respect.\n\nAs large as the events of 476 loom in Modern historiography and popular cultural narrative, they were barely noticed at the time. Romulus Augustulus was deposed on September 4, 476. By the reckoning of Byzantine historians, this was in the last days of the year 5968 Annō Mundi, where 5969 would begin around September 14th. In the Chronicle of Theophanes Confessor, the entry for 5968 contains nothing about events in Italy [translated by Cyril Mango and Roger Scott, with the assistance of Geoffrey Greatrex, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1997, 2006, p.189-191]. By the time of Theophanes Confessor, Θεοφάνης Ὁμολογητής (758-817), the fate of Augustulus must have seemed of little significance. Indeed, the Venerable Bede (672-735) ignores all the last Western Emperors after Honorius.\n\nDealing with the Roman reconquest of North Africa and Italy, the earlier historian Procopius of Caesarea, Προκόπιος ὁ Καισαρεύς (500-565), briefly addresses the end of the Western Emperors. The beginning of his account of the Gothic War, i.e. the overthrow of the Ostrogoths, he mentions, \"During the reign of Zeno in Byzantium the power in the West was held by Augustus [Αὔγουστος], whom the Romans used to call by the diminutive name Augustulus [Αὐγούστουλος] because he took over the empire while still a lad\" [Procopius, History of the Wars III, Books V-VI.15, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press, translated by H.B. Dewing, 1919, 2006, pp.2-5].\n\nEarlier, in his history of the war against the Vandals, Procopius sums up the case of the last Emperors of the West:\n\nAnd another emperor, Nepos, upon taking over the empire, and living to enjoy a few days, died of disease, and Glycerius after him entered into this office and suffered a similar fate. And after him Augustus assumed the imperial power. There were, moreover, still other emperors in the West [ἐν τῇ ἑσπερίᾳ] before this time, but though I know their names well, I shall make no mention of them whatever. For it so fell out that they lived only a short time after attaining office, and as a result of this accomplished nothing worthy [ἄξιον οὐδέν] of mention. Such was the course of events in the West. [Procopius, History of the Wars II, Books III-IV, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press, translated by H.B. Dewing, 1919, 2006, pp.68-69]\n\nProcopius is both dismissive and careless here. Nepos overthrew and followed Glycerius, not the other way around; and Nepos did not die of disease but was killed by Odoacer in Dalmatia. \"Augustus,\" i.e. Romulus Augustulus, only \"assumed power\" in being installed, as a child, by his father. Later, Procopius, in his account of the background of the Gothic war would be rather more careful and detailed, naming and describing Emperors whom he skips here. But the judgment of \"accomplished nothing worthy of mention,\" is quite correct and will endure for centuries, leading to the neglect by Bede and Theophanes [note].\n\nφύσει γὰρ οὖσα δεσπότις τῶν ἄλλων ἐθνῶν ἡ βασιλεία Ῥωμαίων ἐχθρωδῶς διακείμενον ἔχει τὸ δοῦλον.\n\nFor the Empire [βασιλεία] of the Romans, being by nature the mistress of all the nations, holds them, hostilely, in a state of slavery.\n\nAnna Comnena, Alexiad 14.7.2; quoted by Anthony Kaldellis, in Greek and translation, \"Did the Byzantine Empire Have 'Ecumenical' or 'Universal' Aspirations?\" Ancient States and Infrastructural Power, Europe, Asia, and America, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, pp.283,293; translation modified.\n\nRome and Romania -- ἡ Ῥώμη τε καὶ ἡ Ῥωμανία\n\nBut wait a minute! \"Eastern emperor\"! \"Constantinople\"! What was that all about? Indeed, if word that \"the last Roman emperor was overthrown in 476 A.D.\" got back to the people of that year, it would have come as a very great surprise to all, and especially to the emperor Zeno in Constantinople. Not only was he regarded by all as a proper and legitimate Roman emperor, with a Court and an Army that still spoke Latin, but after Odoacer's coup in 476, he was the Roman emperor, with the regalia of the West duly returned to him. And on his throne emperors continued to sit for the next thousand years, reckoning their direct succession from Augustus Caesar.\n\nHow this happened of course goes back to Diocletian and Constantine again. Diocletian realized that it was so much trouble for an emperor to rush from the Rhine to the Danube to the Euphrates that he decided to appoint some colleagues to share his authority.\n\nFirst there was a co-emperor, Maximian, then two junior colleagues, Constantius Chlorus and Galerius. The senior emperors were the Augusti, Αὔγουστοι (singular, Augustus, Αὔγουστος), and the junior emperors and heirs apparent were Caesares, Καῖσαρες (singular, Caesar, Καῖσαρ).\n\nDiocletian then took for himself the business of the eastern half of the empire, with Galerius to help, and left the west to Maximian, with Constantius to help. The system is called the \"Tetrarchy,\" the \"Rule of Four.\" Diocletian also established a precedent by retiring in 305, after twenty years of rule (perhaps with the urging of Galerius). He also prevailed upon Maximian to do the same, with Galerius and Constantius becoming Augusti, appointing two new Caesars, Severus and Maximinus Daia. This was the closest Rome ever got to a constitutional, non-hereditary system of rule. It didn't end up working very well, but it was, with marriage alliances, still close to the system of Imperial adoption used by the Antonines.\n\nTrouble arrived soon enough. Constantius Chlorus died unexpectedly at York (like Septimius Severus) in 306. His troops, enthusiastic about him and his family, immediately elevated his son Constantine to his position. This was irregular, but Galerius consented in ill grace as long as Constantine agreed to the status of Caesar rather than Augustus. Constantine agreed, and the Caesar Severus was recognized as the new western Augustus.\n\nUnfortunately, Severus had a problem. Since Constantius had now been succeeded by his son, Maximian's own son Maxentius didn't want to be left out. He seized Italy and even persuaded his father to come out of retirement. When Severus tried to establish himself in Italy, he was defeated, captured in battle, and then killed. Galerius unsuccessfully invaded Italy and returned to the East. Maxentius generated some enthusiasm at Rome by promising to restore the City to its former prominence -- an enthusiasm that faded when he began requiring the payment of taxes, from which the citizens had previously been exempt.\n\nThis left everything pretty much a shambles, but we need not worry too much about that. Constantine eventually defeated and killed Maxentius (in 312), an event around which the fateful story of his vision of the Cross (or something) grew up, and in the end he assumed sole rule of the Empire by defeating Galerius's successor Licinius (who had been appointed in 308) in 324.\n\nThe transition from Diocletian to Constantine is illustrated in the following flow chart. There was nothing else quite like the Tetrarchy in the rest of Roman history, or any history. The system of appointed colleagues worked pretty well for a while, but it never quite recovered from the death of Constantius Chlorus. In the end, it really collapsed over Galerius favoring his own cronies and neglecting the principle of the system. At his death, he had two colleagues and Constantine none. And after his death, no one ever attempted to appoint new colleagues.\n\nThe drama of all this, which makes Game of Thrones look like Mean Girls, has drawn little attention from historical fiction; and people intimately familiar with the family of Augustus from I, Claudius, may have no idea who Constantius Chlorus was, or how Constantine was the brother-in-law of Maxentius. Nor is Dan Brown a reliable guide to the era. People tend to puzzle over the personality of Constantine because of conflicting feelings about Christianity; but he can be rather well understood from his actions and his own letters, without the bias of later hagiographic treatments or modern hostilities.\n\nI have provided four different diagrams here, with icons for the nine principals, to illustrate the complexity of the Tetrarchy. Of the nine major players, only one, Maxentius, was never recognized as legitimate by the agreement of his colleagues.\n\nEven with the conflicts of the Tetrarchy resolved, this was now a new empire. Not only did Constantine begin to institute Christianity, but the city of Rome itself had along the way assumed a very secondary importance in the life of the state. As we have seen, Diocletian seems to have visited the city only once. Rome had become Romania, Ῥωμανία: a great Empire with a City, rather than a great City with a Empire. Warren Treadgold says of the 4th century historian Ammianus Marcellinus:\n\n...he held the view, by his time rather old-fashioned, that the Roman Empire belonged to the city of Rome. [The Early Byzantine Historians, Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p.69].\n\nAs Peter Heather acutely puts it, Rome was now an \"inside-out\" Empire [The Fall of the Roman Empire, Oxford, 2006] -- the center and the periphery had exchanged places (as illustrated in the animation at left).\n\nThis transformation is scrupulously ignored in popular treatments of the Roman Empire, even in apparently well researched presentations on venues like the History Channel. I have seen a documentary [2011] which defined the \"Roman Empire\" as a domain \"ruled from one city, Rome.\" All such shows treat the fate of the Empire as tied to the fate of the City, when their stories had long been separated and the City had ceased to be the center of events, politically, culturally, or militarily [note].\n\nAll free Roman subjects had been citizens since Caracalla. The emperors who restored the empire in the Third Century, Claudius II, Aurelian, and Diocletian, had all come from Illyricum. There was little time for the emperors to spend at Rome, which was strategically ill placed for frontier defense; and so for military reasons, Milan (Mediolanum) and later Ravenna became the practical western capitals, as Diocletian had taken up residence at Nicomedia (the modern Turkish Izmit, badly damaged by an earthquake in 1999) in Bithynia.\n\nThe Roman citizens of the city of Rome were now distinct in no truly important way from the rest of the empire, though they still continued to receive subsidized food shipments and formal respects. \"Roman\" now meant the Empire, Romania, Ῥωμανία, and the citizens, and only secondarily the City.\n\nThat the City had become the World, one Οἰκουμένη, Oecumene (Oikouménē), was even articulated as ideology in the \"Roman Oration,\" Εἰς Ῥώμην (\"To Rome\"), of Aelius Aristides (117-181), delivered at Rome in 143 AD. This was a work much admired, for centuries, in Mediaeval Romania, although now scarcely noticed by Classicists [note].\n\nThus, Christianity did not build a new civilization on the ruins of the old, as Joseph Sobran said, it was the old civilization (the ruins came later), transformed by a religion that had grown up out of its own internal elements: the uncompromising Monotheism, exclusivity, historical drama, and destiny of Judaism, the divine King so dear to the Egyptians, the Hellenistic mystery religion's promise of immortality through initiation, the elaborate doctrine and argumentation of Greek metaphysics, and finally the unity and universality that Aurelian and Diocletian had already tried to institute through a cult of Sōl Invictus, the \"Unconquered Sun.\"\n\nThe birthday of Christ was even conveniently moved to the birthday of the solar Mithras: December 25th (it's still on January 6th in Armenian chuches); and it is noteworthy how the push for the divinity of Christ consistently came from the Egyptians -- Athanasius of Alexandria had to contend with the Arian sympathies of several emperors. Orthodoxy did not firmly settle on Athanasianism until Theodosius I.\n\nBut then the Egyptians continued pushing: The orthdoxy of both divine and human natures for Christ was not good enough; the Egyptians didn't like the idea of two natures. The most extreme version was that the one nature was entirely divine. Condemned at Chalcedon, the Monophysite (\"One Nature\") doctrine remains the view of Egyptian Christians, the Copts, to this day (though most now regard the one nature as both human and divine).\n\nBut we have one last echo of Mithras: the sacred day of Christians is Sunday, established by Constantine, not because it is the day of the Resurrection, but because it is \"the day celebrated by veneration of the sun itself\" (diem solis veneratione sui celebrem).\n\nChristianity thus brewed itself up over a couple of centuries as the first multicultural religion, a peculiarly Roman, which is to say a Latinized, Hellenistic, Middle Eastern religion. Indeed, the official name of the \"Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church\" (Sancta Romana Catholica et Apostolica Ecclesia) doesn't even give much of a hint that it refers to Christianity, though you know for sure it has something to do with Rome. Indeed, Christianity was quite simply the Roman religion. The match of religion with times is evident enough in the circumstance that only one emperor subsequent to Constantine, Julian the Apostate, briefly and tragicomically tried to return to the old gods.\n\nA curious feature of Greek influence on Christianity is the moral condemnation of trade and finance. This does not originate in Judaism, where (as in ʾIslām) money and trade have always been legitimate, nor in primitive Christianity, which grew up as an urban religion among what was actually a prosperous middle class. Instead, the whole moral discourse of suspicion and condemnation of trade and money derives from Greek philosophy.\n\nWhile it may be assumed that the later Christian attitude went along with its world-denying and monastic tradition, we see a lot less of that in the East, in Constantinople, where a cash economy continued through the Middle Ages and the life of the City was much consumed with trade, while monasticism, of course, was taken no less seriously than in the West. Instead, the Latin West, under the influence of the former Neoplatonist, Augustine, and where the cash economy collapsed into subsistence agriculture, became the venue of suspicion of merchants, money, and cities, especially when these came to be associated with the Jewish merchants who, welcomed or not, nevertheless were able to travel and function in Christian areas where, for instance, Muslims were never allowed.\n\nAfter a modern economy developed in the West, money, buying, and selling, when these were regarded as bad things, continued to be associated with the Jews, as we see from the Enlightenment (e.g. Voltaire, Kant and Fries) to Marx to the socialist left of the present. The vitriol and violence directed against the Jews, however, finds no counterpart in the regard of defenders of Capitalism for the Greek philosophers, particularly Plato and Aristotle, who did so much to delegitimize merchants and bankers. When even Jefferson still valorized rural life and distrusted bankers and \"stock-jobbers,\" and the modern left constantly seeks to shift the blame for the failures and irrationality of government over to bankers, brokers, and corporations, while American universities have become hotbeds of Marxism and anti-Semitism, the terms of the debate have really changed very little.\n\nTertullian had asked, \"What then has Athens to do with Jerusalem, the Academy with the Church, the heretic with the Christian?\" He represented a tension that would exist and continue between Greek culture, with the humanistic values of Greek παιδεία, paideía (\"education\"), and the often stern requirements of Christian faith, asceticism, and anhedonia. As it happened, despite the tension and occasional harsh words, conflict, and heresy trials, the influence of both continued in a strong and generally productive blend in Romania -- with even condemned heretics usually enduring no harsher punishment than exile to monasteries.\n\nMeanwhile, the culture and the religion had become all but seamless parts of Roman identity, a phenomenon that continues to perplex scholars, not because it is particularly hard to understand, but because it subverts the paradigm of pagan Romans at the baths, games, and orgies. The picture of Christian Romans who mostly speak Greek is both perplexing and (to secular biases) distasteful, and so it is occluded by narratives at once sexier and hostile.\n\nYet Mediaeval Romania was far more unified a state, a culture, and a people than had been the Empire of Nero or even Trajan. The reproach of jumped-up Franks, both Mediaeval and Modern, that Romania had lost Rome, and so was alienated from its indispensable eponymous foundation, seemed decisive to them; but the Rhōmaîoi knew that Rome had become New Rome, Constantinople, long before the Western Empire collapsed, while both Franks and Romans had lost the metropolis of their common religion, Jerusalem, to ʾIslām. They were not thereby less Christian for it, and the Ῥωμαῖοι, Rhōmaîoi, were no less Roman for being Christian and speaking Greek.\n\nThe seat of the Roman Empire is Constantinople... Therefore you are the legitimate Emperor of the Romans... And he who is and remains Emperor of the Romans is also Emperor of the whole earth.\n\nGeorge of Trebizond, Γεώργιος ὁ Τραπεζούντιος (1395-1472/73), to Meḥmed II the Conqueror, 1466; quoted by Philip Mansel [note]\n\nConstantinople\n\nRome, queen of the world, thy fame shall never perish;\n\nfor Victory, being wingless, cannot fly from thee.\n\nAnonymous, \"On [New] Rome,\" [The Greek Anthology, Volume III, Book 9, \"The Declamatory Epigrams,\" Number 647, The Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press, 1917, p.358-359]\n\nConstantine built his New Rome (Νέα Ῥώμη, Roma Nova), better situated militarily than the old, a Christian Rome, decorated with the spoils of the dying paganism (including great bronze horses from Delphi, later relocated to Venice, and the Wonder of the World Statue of Zeus from Olympia, whose face evidently inspired portraits of Christ), but also with its own Senate, its own Consul, its own chariot races (in the hippodrome), its own factional riots (between the Greens and the Blues), and its own grain subsidies, drawn from Egypt and North Africa like those of Rome itself. The site was a natural wonder and a military engineer's dream, perhaps more beautifully situated, on hills flanked by water, than any great modern city save San Francisco, New York, or Hong Kong.\n\nOn his way to Jerusalem with the First Crusade (1096-1099), Fulcher of Chartres (1059-c.1128), subsequently chaplain to Baldwin I of Jerusalem, said of Constantinople:\n\nO what a spendid city, how stately, how fair, how many monasteries therein, how many palaces raised by sheer labour in its broadways and streets, how many works of art, marvellous to behold: it would be wearisome to tell of the abundance of all good things; of gold and silver, garments of manifold fashion and such sacred relics. Ships are at all times putting in at this port, so that there is nothing that men want that is not brought hither. [quoted by Philip Sherrard, Constantinople: The Iconography of a Sacred City, London, 1965, p.12]\n\nSimilarly, Odo of Deuil (1110-1162), chaplain of Louis VII of France on the Second Crusade (1147-1149), had these impressions:\n\nConstantinople is the glory of the Greeks. Rich in fame, richer yet in wealth, the city is triangular in shape, like a ship's sail. In its inner angle lies Sancta Sophia and the Palace of Constantine, in which there is a chapel honored for its sacred relics. The city is hemmed in on two sides by the sea: approaching the city, we had on the right the Arm of St. George [the Bosporus] and on the left a certain estuary which branches off from it and flows on for almost four miles [the Golden Horn]. There is set what is called the Palace of Blachernae which, although it is rather low, yet, rises to eminence because of its elegance and its skillful construction. On its three sides the palace offers to its inhabitants the triple pleasure of gazing alternately on the sea, the countryside, and the town. The exterior of the palace is of almost incomparable loveliness and its interior surpasses anything that I can say about it. It is decorated throughout with gold and various colors and the floor is paved with cleverly arranged marble. Indeed, I do not know whether the subtlety of the art or the preciousness of the materials gives it the greater beauty or value. On the third side of the city's triangle there are fields. This side is fortified by towers and a double wall which extends for nearly two miles, from the sea to the palace. This wall is not especially strong [?], and the towers are not very high [?], but the city trusts, I think, in its large population and in its ancient peace. Within the walls there is vacant land [the parateichion and the peribolus] which is cultivated with hoes and plows. Here there are all kinds of gardens which furnish vegetables for the citizens. Subterranean conduits flow into the city under the walls to furnish the citizens with an abundance of fresh water. The city is rather squalid and smelly and many places are afflicted with perpetual darkness [Ipsa quidem sordida est et fedita multisque in locis perpetua nocte dampnata].\n\nOttoman house with\n\noverhanging construction\n\nThe rich build their houses so as to overhang the streets and leave these dark and dirty places for travellers and for the poor. There murder and robberies occur, as well as other sordid crimes which love the dark. Life in this city is lawless [quoniam autem in hac urbe vivitur sine jure], since it has as many lords as it has rich men and almost as many thieves as poor men. Here the criminal feels neither fear nor shame, since crime is not punished by law nor does it ever fully come to light. Constantinople exceeds the average in everything -- it surpasses other cities in wealth and also in vice. It has many churches which are unequal to Sancta Sophia in size, though not in elegance. The churches are admirable for their beauty and equally so for their numerous venerable relics of the saints. Those [of us French] who could enter them did so, some out of curiosity in order to see them, and some out of faithful devotion. [James Brundage, The Crusades: A Documentary History, Marquette University Press, 1962, pp. 109-111; \"Sancta,\" as it is in Latin, substituted for \"Santa\" in the translation]\n\nOdo has underestimated the size, strength, and length of the triple Land Walls of Constantinople. He is certainly intimidated by the size and density of the City, about whose lawlessness we do not otherwise hear. Well might the modern traveller lament the crime in modern cities, where it certainly does not go entirely unpunished, whether the criminals feel fear and shame or not. Sounds like he had a bad experience in one dark street.\n\nApproaching the City with the Fourth Crusade in 1203, Geoffroy de Villehardouin says:\n\nI can assure you that all those who had never seen Constantinople before gazed very intently at the city, having never imagined there could be so fine a place in all the world. They noted the high walls and lofty towers encircling it, and its rich palaces and tall churches, of which there were so many that no one would have believed it to be true if he had not seen it with his own eyes, and viewed the length and breadth of that city which reigns supreme over all others. There was indeed no man so brave and daring that his flesh did not shudder at the sight. [Joinville and Villehardouin, Chronicles of the Crusades, \"The Conquest of Constantinople,\" Penguin, pp.58-59]\n\nEven the Ottoman City was described thus by English traveller George Sandys (1578-1644) in 1610:\n\nThere is hardly in nature a more delicate object, if beheld from the sea or adjoyning mountains: the loftie and beautifull cypresse trees so intermixed with the buildings that it seemeth to present a city in a wood to the pleased beholders. Whose seven aspiring heads (for on so many hils and no more, they say it is seated) are most of them crowned with magnificent mosques, all of white marble round in forme... [quoted by Jonathan Harris, Constantinople, Capital of Byzantium, Hambledon Continuum, London, New York, 2007, p.190, original spelling]\n\nThis City became Constantinopolis, Κωνσταντινούπολις, the City of Constantine, later shortened in Greek to Stamboul, Σταμβούλ, and now remembered in Turkish as İstanbul [note].\n\nWe see Michael Psellus in the 11th Century surprisingly contrasting \"the ancient and lesser Rome, and the later, more powerful city\" [!, Fourteen Byzantine Rulers, Penguin, 1966, p.177]. It is now hard to grasp Constantinople as a greater city than Rome, but there would have been little in Rome's favor in Psellus' day.\n\nThe great triple land wall of Constantinople, with almost two hundred towers, finished under Theodosius II (408-450), was perhaps the most successful fortification in world history, standing unbreached, through countless sieges -- twenty-three between 413 and 1453 -- against Germans, Huns, Avars, Persians, Arabs, Bulgars, Vikings, Cumans, Crusaders, Mongols, and Turks, for 1040 years, protected by Holy Icons like the Ὁδηγήτρια, Hodēgētria (the Virgin who \"Shows the Way,\" kept at the Hodegon Monastery), or the Βλαχερνίτισσα, Blachernitissa (the Virgin of the Chruch of Mary at Blachernae, where the Μαφόριον, Maphorion, the Robe of the Virgin, was kept and where there was a miraculous Spring, quite close to the wall itself), finally to shatter only under the gigantic cannonballs of the Sultān Meḥmed II. Even so, in the midst of İstanbul, it mostly still remains standing, in some places even restored, its breaches merely allowing modern streets to pass [note].\n\n\"Oh!\" you say, \"You mean Byzantium! That's not the Roman Empire! That's some horrible medieval thing!\" That certainly would have been news to Constantine, or to Zeno, or to Justinian (527-565), or even to Basil II in the 11th century (963-1025). \"Byzantium,\" although the name of the original Greek city, Βυζάντιον, where Constantinople was founded, and often used for the City (as by Procopius and others), was not a word that was ever used to refer to the Empire, or to anything about it, by its rulers, its inhabitants, or even its enemies.\n\nIndeed, the City could simply be called \"Rome,\" Rhṓmē, Ῥώμη in Greek, which is what we see in the inscriptions recorded in The Greek Anthology [Volume III, Book 9, \"The Declamatory Epigrams,\" Numbers 647, 657, 697, & 799; The Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press, 1917]. The emperor was always of the \"Romans,\" Rhōmaîoi, Ῥωμαῖοι in Greek; and to Arabs and Turks the Empire and land were simply Rūm, رُوم, \"Rome\" [note].\n\nAs Roman identity expanded from Old Rome into all Romania, it focused and contracted from the shrinking Empire onto the New Rome. \"Byzantium\" is in fact a term of ill will and scorn adopted and substituted by modern historians, who didn't want to admit that Rome did not, after all, \"fall,\" leaving them personally as the eventual and proper heirs. As G.W. Bowersock, Peter Brown, and Oleg Grabar say, the term \"Byzantine Empire\" is \"a modern misnomer redolent of ill-informed contempt\" [Late Antiquity, A Guide to the Postclassical World, Belknap Press, Harvard University Press, 1999, p.vii].\n\nAs Roman historians liked to use archaic place names, and so frequently called Constantinople \"Byzantium,\" their use of \"Byzantine,\" Byzantinus, was simply and logically for residents of the Capital. Thus, Warren Treadgold [The Early Byzantine Historians, Palgrave Macmillan, 2010] says:\n\nThe Suda [Σοῦδα, a tenth century encyclopedia] calls [the historian] Malchus [of Philadelphia] a \"Byzantine,\" which usually meant a native of Constantinople but in this case must have meant a longtime resident. [p.103]\n\nWhen Liutprand of Cremona (c.922-972) and Frankish, i.e. German, envoys, in an embassy from Otto I, with their own pretentions as successors of Rome, arrived at the Court of Nicephorus Phocas in 968, their represenation of Otto as the \"Emperor of the Romans\" (Imperator Romanorum) was hotly disputed. Otto was not a successor of Constantine.\n\nA letter then arrived from the Pope addressed to the \"emperor of the Greeks.\" For this \"sinful audacity,\" Liutprand, who was ready to go home, was \"detained,\" shall we say, pending an explanation of this insult -- Jonathan Harris says \"thrown in prison\" [Constantinople, Continuum, 2007, p.62]. Evidently the Pope had not heard of \"Byzantium\" as the name of the Empire [note].\n\nLater, the Franks or \"Latins\" tended to call the Ῥωμαῖοι, Rhōmaîoi, \"Greeks,\" Graeci, and even Graeculi, \"Little Greeks.\" The former was not always intended to be insulting, but the latter was.\n\nWhile \"Byzantium\" is indeed used merely as a term of convience and custom by most historians, there is the awkward question of when \"Rome\" ends and \"Byzantium\" begins. If Rome \"fell\" in 476, then clearly \"Byzantium\" should begin there; but this boundary is rarely used. Since Constantinople itself must be explained, Byzantine histories commonly begin with Constantine, often in 324, when Constantine had defeated Lincinius and acquired the East.\n\nThis is what one finds in Alexander Alexandrovich Vasiliev, History of the Byzantine Empire [1928, University of Wisconsin Press, 1961], George Ostrogorsky, History of the Byzantine State [Rutgers University Press, 1969], and John Julius Norwich, Byzantium, The Early Centuries [Knopf, 1989]. The flip side of this would be simply to end the \"Roman Empire\" with Constantine. This is not common, but I have seen Garrett G. Fagan do it, in his lectures for The Teaching Company, \"Emperors of Rome\" [2007]. With thirty-six lectures on Emperors, Fagan abruptly stops at Constantine, with a handoff to Kenneth W. Harl's lectures, \"The World of Byzantium\" [2001], to continue the story.\n\nFagan says that, to him, Constantine was the first Mediaeval, or the first Byzantine, Emperor; and so his job is done. The drawback of this approach is that the last century and a half of the Western Empire falls between the stools, not to mention the extraordinary and tragic Julian, who ruled the whole Empire. A Byzantinist is not going to pay much attention to Ricimer, as Harl, who doesn't even mention his name, indeed does not. And Harl has the annoying habit of saying \"Stilichio\" for Stilicho and \"Visiogoths\" for \"Visigoths,\" forms that I do not see attested in any print source. So this approach really will not do.\n\nOn the other hand, David R. Sear's Byzantine Coins and Their Values [Seaby, 1987] is the direct continuation of his Roman Coins and Their Values [Seaby, 1988], and he chooses to make the division at the reign of the Emperor Anastasius just because Anastasius carried out a major reform of the copper coinage. Others take Phocas or Heraclius, under whom the Danube Frontier collapsed and the Arab invasion occurred, as the first \"Byzantine\" emperors: A.H.M. Jones' monumental and authoritative The Later Roman Empire 284-602 [Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986] and Mark Whittow's complementary (if not as monumental) The Making of Byzantium, 600-1025 [University of California Press, 1996] take that approach.\n\nWe also see this division in Andreas Thiele's Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, where \"Rom\" covers genealogies from Julius Caesar to Phocas (Volume II, Part 2, Europäiche Kaiser-, Königs- und Fürstenhäuser II Nord-, Ost- und Südeuropa, R. G. Fischer Verlag, Part 2, Second Edition, 1997, pp.262-292), while \"Byzanz\" goes from Heraclius to the Emperors of Trapezond (Volume III, Europäiche Kaiser-, Königs- und Fürstenhäuser, Ergänzungsband, R. G. Fischer Verlag, Second Edition, 2001, pp.213-236). One nice touch for the division at Phocas could be that he was the last Emperor to place a monument, a column, in the Forum at Rome.\n\nA more recent thorough history, however, Warren Treadgold's A History of the Byzantine State and Society [Stanford University Press, 1997], begins where many of the explanations must begin, with Diocletian himself in 284 -- elsewhere [Byzantium and Its Army, 284-1081, Stanford, 1995, p.viii], Treadgold lists possible dates for the beginning of Byzantium as, besides 284, \"324, 395, 476, 565, 610, or 717.\" Whatever point one picks between Diocletian and Heraclius (or Leo III, Treadgold's \"717\" date), there is clearly a transition period; but all the later empire could still be distinguished from the earlier simply by calling it what its inhabitants did: Romania.\n\n\"Byzantine,\" for whatever reason it is used, still carries a connotation of the mediaeval, dark, nasty, labyrinthine, and treacherous -- the disapproval of even modern and secular Western Europeans for what Mediaeval Latins would dismiss as the Greek \"Schismatics.\" Curious how the attitude stays the same despite the changes in culture, faith, politics, etc. [note].\n\nA final date for the transition could be 750, which is used by Peter Brown and others to terminate \"Late Antiquity.\" This could date the fall of the Omayyads, or the final fall of Ravenna to the Lombards (in 751). Both these events are significant, but they seem like variations on developments already far progressed.\n\nByzantine Matters, Averil Cameron\n\nA curious reflection on the division between Rome and Byzantium is found in Byzantine Matters, Why the marginalized story of Byzantium has much to teach us about Western history, by distinguished Oxford Byzantinist Averil Cameron [Princeton, 2014]:\n\nHowever much one wishes to avoid the dangers [?] of seeming to argue for continuity [?!], it is impossible to avoid the question of periodization in relation to Byzantium. As I have noted, several recent writers prefer to see \"Byzantium\" proper as beginning from ca.600 or later, and there are good reasons why. Constantinople was formally inaugurated in AD 330, but there was not yet such an entity as \"Byzantium,\" distinct from the eastern Roman Empire, and it remains the case that the Byzantines thought of themselves as Romans (chapter 3). The shock and loss of territory consequent on the Arab invasion of the seventh century also necessitated a painful adjustment. Nevertheless, adopting a later periodization risks obscuring the fact that what we call Byzantium had a long earlier history; it was not a new state formed only in the medieval period.\n\nIn the last generation \"late antiquity\" has taken over from \"the later Roman empire\" in much of the secondary literature, even if the continuing number of publications discussing its scope and nature suggests that these questions are not yet settled. The \"explosion\" of late antiquity and now the turn to the east -- that is, toward the eastern Mediterranian, the rise of Islam, and the early Islamic world -- that is such a feature of current scholarship are both tendencies that threaten to squeeze out Byzantium. [pp.113-114]\n\nCameron ends here on a note of hand-wringing that seems to be about nothing. It is not just that \"there was not yet such an entity as 'Byzantium'.\" The truth is that there was never such an entity, as it is commonly meant, as \"Byzantium.\" The question of \"periodization,\" where to divide \"Rome\" from \"Byzantium,\" as we have just seen, has always been about a fiction, which is why the divisions are so varied, and so obviously arbitrary. And if there are \"tendencies that threaten to squeeze out Byzantium,\" then perhaps this should be encouraged, since a more honest and acurate naming eliminates much of the basis of the sort of contempt that Cameron herself laments.\n\nIf we want to avoid entirely the impression that Byzantium \"was not a new state formed only in the medieval period,\" then this would be accomplished most effectively by just not using the word \"Byzantium.\" Call it \"Romania\" -- a name that Cameron, again most typically and tellingly, never mentions. She continues the tradition of ignoring what the Romans called their own Empire. This should tell us something important.\n\nCameron's admission that \"the Byzantines thought of themselves as Romans\" is characteristic of this problem. As with other examples I examine on this page, Cameron's locution allows or even implies that \"the Byzantines,\" who merely \"thought\" themselves Romans, were really not \"Romans,\" which is something that we know that apparently they did not. Cameron certainly never actually calls them Romans.\n\nSo, obviously, we know better, regardless of how the Rhōmaîoi thought or spoke of themselves, and in spite of the continuity of their history -- the admission of which for Cameron seems to involve some kind of unspecified \"dangers.\" So despite Cameron's defense and concern for \"Byzantium,\" her attitude and practice are part of the problem, not the solution; and she has insensibly conceded the very basis upon which Mediaeval Romania has traditionally been marginzalized, belittled, and despised. Cameron remains what Anthony Kaldellis has called a \"grumpy Byzantinist.\"\n\nAnd now we know from Peter Brown's autobiography -- Journeys of the Mind, A Life in History [Princeton, 2023] -- that Cameron's problem with \"Late Antiquity\" goes all the way back to Brown's publication of The World of Late Antiquity. While Brown appreciates Cameron's review as \"perceptive,\" it is essentially nit-picking, with statements like, \"There is even danger in the bountiful illustrations and their interesting captions,\" which is, really, an extraordinarily absurd thing to say [Brown, p.391]. But we know about Cameron's \"dangers,\" which is the pearl-clutching unease of conventional wisdom being upset, even for someone who would complain about \"the marginalized story of Byzantium.\" In Cameron's \"story,\" Romania remains marginalized. If you can't call something by its proper name, something about it puts you off.\n\nSo why should modern historians have ever scorned the successors of Augustus in Constantinople? Well, it isn't just them. The scorn goes back a little earlier. Nothing after Alexander Severus (222-235) is quite Roman enough for many scholars. The Cassell's New Latin Dictionary, of which I have the 1959 edition [Funk & Wagnalls, New York], only gives the vocabulary of classical authors from \"about 200 B.C. to A.D. 100.\" Thus a number of late meanings, for words like comes or dux, or late vocabulary altogether, like diocesis (diocese, Greek dioíkēsis), Diocletian's new administrative groupings of provinces, or Romania (Greek Ῥωμανία, Rhōmanía), the name of the Empire itself, are missing. And lest the reader think Cassell's dictionary too trivial a source to belabor over this, the new Oxford Latin Dictionary, edited by P.G.W. Glare [OUP, 1982, Second Edition, 2012, corrected 2015], itself only uses sources \"to the end of the second century AD\" [p.vii]. The Oxford dictionary is also missing \"Romania,\" etc. [note].\n\nThese trucations leave one without the connections to the mediaeval and modern meanings of \"count,\" \"duke,\" or \"diocese.\" Obviously the Latin literature or history after 100/200 A.D. was not worth considering -- a slight certain to be a disappointment to the great historian of the fourth century, Ammianus Marcellinus, or to Flavius Vegetius Renatus, one of the founders of military science, whose book (De Re Militari) was used straight through the Middle Ages into Modern times, or to Theodosius II and Justinian who took the trouble in the fifth and sixth centuries to gather Roman law together into law codes, or to Justinian's contemporary Boethius (Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, d.524), whose commentaries on Porphyry's Isagoge (Εἰσαγωγή, the \"Introduction\") and Aristotle's On Interpretation, and his On the Consolation of Philosophy, were among the few clues to Greek philosophy preserved in Western Europe until the return of Greek literature beginning in the 12th century. Although Boethius lived under King Theodoric of the Ostrogoths, he was Roman Consul for the year 510, and his sons Consuls for 522.\n\nThe abbreviation of Classical Latin literature is also evident in the classic Latin textbook, which I bought in 1967, Frederic M. Wheelock's Latin [Barnes & Noble, 1956, 1966; revised as Wheelock's Latin by Richard A. LaFleur, HarperResource, 2000]. The periods of Latin literature include divisions of the Golden Age, 80 BC-14 AD (with Ciceronian, to 43 BC, and Augustan, from 43, subdivisions), the Silver Age, 14 AD-138 BC (to the death of Hadrian), with an \"Archaising Period\" coda (to \"fill out the 2nd century\"), and then the \"Patristic Period\" all the way to the \"Medieval Period,\" with a conventional cutoff, apparently, around 476, and a great deal of talk about the \"Vulgar Latin\" used by the Church Fathers [Wheelock, pp.xxv-xxix, LaFleur, pp.xxxiii-xxxvii].\n\nThe \"Patristic Period\" leaves one with the impression that there was no secular Latin literature of the era -- indeed, Wheelock says that \"most of the vital literature was the work of Christian leaders, or fathers (patrēs)\" [p.xxviii] -- and in fact none of the Sententiae Antīquae in Wheelock draw on Ammianus or Boethius, though we do get Isidore of Seville (d.636) and the Venerable Bede (d.735) without any cautions that these are Mediaeval and \"vulgarized\" texts (Boethius and even Bede, but not Isidore, are represented in the Loeb Classical Library). Secular Late Antiquity thus gets ignored and bypassed -- perhaps from a disinclination to admit that it even existed -- ironically and incongruously without this being motivated by any admiration for Chistianity.\n\nWhat Latinists may not want to admit, and what is certainly missing from the explanations in Wheelock or Cassell's dictionary, is acknowledgement that, even as there is indeed a decline in Latin literature in Late Antiquity, this is probably because there is a revival and fourishing of Greek literature. That began, or at least became obvious, in the phenomenon of the Second Sophistic, in the days of Septemius Severus. But the tendency was already evident. Marcus Aurelius, who was Roman enough for any writer, and for Hollywood, kept his diary in Greek. This all leads seemlessly to the replacement of Latin by Greek in Mediaeval Constantinople. But the whole phenomenon clearly makes Classicists uncomfortable, and its early roots, and the meaning of the Second Sophistic, are generally ignored.\n\nSimilar to the issues about language, the Oxford History of the Classical World, Volume II, The Roman World (Oxford University Press, 1988), which is 422 large format pages long, devotes a miserable 22 pages to the last two hundred years before 476. The chapter is called \"Envoi: On Taking Leave of Antiquity.\" Evidently, the editors couldn't take leave fast enough. Such impatience can also be seen in the large format and lavishly illustrated Chronicle of the Roman Emperors by Chris Scarre (Thames and Hudson, 1995, 1999; 232 pages of text). From Augustus to 235 AD, 52% of the time from Augustus to the \"Fall\" in 476, is covered by 65% of the text. The crisis of the Third Century, from 235 to 284, and the remaining time, from Diocletian until 476, each receive about 17% of the text, although in time they are (only) 10% and 38%, respectively.\n\nThus, 192 years of Roman history, including a century (the 4th) with extensive ruins and literature, are given less than half the space that one might expect. Closer inspection reveals something else. Not a single pre-476 monument of Constantinople is shown, not the pillars of Claudius II or Constantine, nor the Walls of Theodosius II (though they are at least mentioned). In fact, after the Arch of Constantine and a part of one of his churches in Rome, there is not a single monument or building illustrated in the text, not even anything from Ravenna, the capital of the last Western Emperors. No wonder things could be wrapped up so quickly.\n\nOne is left with the false impression, merely scanning the pages, that nothing was built, an impression as false and misleading (though consistent with expectations for decadence or the Dark Ages) as the title of the last chapter, \"The Last Emperors,\" which disposes of everyone after Constantine (139 years -- George Washington to Herbert Hoover) in just ten pages. In The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Rome, also by Chris Scarre [1995], 75 pages are devoted to the Roman Empire. Of this, 21 pages, 28% of the total, cover everything from Diocletian on. This is better than the Oxford History or the Chronicle, but it still represents 38% of the time.\n\nFinally, there is The Complete Roman Army, by Adrian Goldsworthy [Thames & Hudson, 2003]. With a text of 214 pages, Part V of the book, \"The Army of Late Antiquity,\" starting with Diocletian, is only 16 pages long, 7% of the total -- again for 38% of the time. For a summary treatment, Goldsworthy does a good job; but for an army that was twice as large as that of the Principate, with a much more complex organization, whose performance involves many very critical historical questions, the lack of proportion is obvious.\n\nThus, while there is a nice two page feature on Julian's Battle of Strasbourg, it is perplexing not to have such a treatment of one of the most important battles in history, the defeat and death of Valens at Adrianople. Indeed, why Valens lost the battle is one of the most important questions in all of Roman, or even world, history. Now the new The Roman Army, the Greatest War Machine of the Ancient World, edited by Chris McNab [Osprey Publishing, 2010] does have an extensive treatment, with maps of Adrianople [pp.241-253]. At the same time, the \"Late Empire\" in this book (\"AD 200-6th Century\") gets 57 pages out of 265, 22% -- although, since the book covers the Republican Army also, the Late Empire (which seems to include the Severans here) actually gets 46% of the space devoted to the Empire, which is finally getting the proportions about right.\n\nWhat's the problem? The truth is that the problem of Roman history for most historians, or cultural commentators, is not that the Empire fell in 476, which of course it didn't, but that it had changed, already, back in the 3rd and 4th centuries. The Empire of Diocletian or Constantine, let alone of Theodosius or Justinian, is certainly not the Empire of Augustus or Trajan, let alone Nero or Elagabalus. Rather than deal with those changes, which for the secular historian involve disagreeable topics like Christianity, it is much easier to dismiss them, write them off, and bundle the rest of the history of Romania into a different, and contemptible, academic subfield.\n\nThis procedure then preserves \"Rome\" as a glittering, static, Platonic Form of fascination, whether proudly pagan -- and therefore modern, since the old gods need not be taken seriously as religion -- or delightfully hedonistic and decadent -- and therefore modern again, like any good party in Greenwich Village. Diocletian and Constantine themselves become something rather like a footnote to the real story, whose interest is exhausted with Nero, or perhaps with Marcus Aurelius.\n\nConstantine has already sinned against the sensibilities of the Enlightenment (or is it the Renaissance? or is it the modern multicultural, non-judgmental liberal?), so we can't help it if he has bought into the darkness and obscurity of a Mediaeval world for which we have no sympathy, but do have considerable antipathy. He, and his successors, have willfully disqualified themselves from our serious consideration, let alone our respect.\n\nThe \"Fall of Rome\" is thus not an event in history, but a boundary in historiography -- something more dramatic and absolute than anything some marauding Goths could have accomplished -- people whose identity and deeds are irrelevant anyway, besides the absurdity of that new religion, which is the real issue.\n\nPeriodization\n\nClassicists perhaps just should not bother with Roman history after 284. Their hearts just aren't in it, and we get a second rate treatment. They only continue down to 476 because they have taken that as the \"Fall\" and the end of Roman history, which they have a disagreeable duty to address -- although Mary Beard decides to just forget it -- she doesn't even get as far as 284. Since 476 is actually nothing of the sort, they all should, like Mary, just forget about it.\n\nThey certainly have enough to keep them busy before 284. The first two hundred years of Roman history do make a pretty compact cultural and historical unit. The culture and religion are still pagan, the office of emperor maintains some pretense of republican form, Roman power is more or less triumphant and unchallenged, and there are those wonderfully entertaining \"decadent\" emperors, upon whom every indulgence and sexual excess can be projected (which may actually be what the Roman historians were doing themselves). That takes us from Augustus to Alexander Severus (30 BC to 235 AD). Then we have a world of trouble. Palmyra takes the East. Gaul and Spain break away. The Goths sack Athens. Pirates rake the seas. The Empire seems to be disintegrating. Soon philosophy turns from the grim determination of Stoicism to the otherworldly consolations of mysticism, whether in the pagan Neoplatonism of Plotinus or the new religions like Christianity, Mithraism, or Manicheanism.\n\nThe Emperors, who could no longer survive spending their time on debaucheries in Rome, were not, at first, very mystical; but the Zeitgeist caught up with them in Constantine's Christianity. This is all often too much for the Classicists, whose bias then distorts their estimation even of the facts of Late Antiquity. If inattention to the 3rd century onwards was due to a lack of events, a lack of literature, or a lack of ruins and archaeology, it might make some sense. But none of those things are lacking. It is the interest that is lacking: the 3rd century on is just not the \"real\" Rome anymore.\n\nClassicists are all versions of Livy, whose historiography was driven by moral judgments that Rome was just not what it used to be (see what he says about Cincinnatus). Fortunately, there has been a reaction against this for a while now. Peter Brown's great The World of Late Antiquity 150-750 [HBJ, 1971] zeros in on many myths and misconceptions about the late empire and has inspired great interest and more critical appraisals of the period. Despite the date in the title, Brown essentially begins with the transformations of the 3rd century. This is, in essence, when Rome became Romania. But to those for whom \"Rome\" merely means the City, not the Empire, that is the problem. The transformation and universalization of the state means a loss of interest, despite complete continuity, even in language (for a while).\n\nThe new era for Romania begins neatly enough. The Era of Diocletian, beginning in 284, continued to be used in Egypt long after his death. Indeed, the Era of Diocletian is still used in Egypt by the Egyptian Christians, the Copts, in conjunction with the months of the ancient Egyptian calendar (Thout, etc.) and the leap day that Augustus Caesar imposed on the city of Alexandria in 26 BC. Thus, September 11, 1996, was the first day of the Year 1713 for the Copts. The Anno Domini Era itself was \"inspired,\" if that is the right word, by the Era of Diocletian.\n\nIn the Sixth Century, Dionysius Exiguus, who was making up the Easter tables for the Julian calendar with Alexandrian astronomical data, was offended that Christians should be using the era of a persecutor of Christians. He thought that Christians should be using an era based on the life of Christ. He didn't get it quite right (Jesus cannot have been born after 4 BC), but his system eventually became universal in Christendom and then simply universal -- now often called the \"Common Era.\" The Copts, of course, had no intention of paying tribute to Diocletian. They call theirs the \"Era of Martyrs,\" in homage to the martyrs, not to the person, of Diocletian.\n\nThe Era of Diocletian does suggest the unit of a later, or perhaps second, Empire. Its natural end is not 476, but 610, as in Jones and Whittow. The natural period ends, not with the German kingdoms in Italy, Spain, North Africa, and Gaul, two of which were actually restored to Rome by Justinian, but with the collapse of the Danube frontier and the advent of ʾIslām.\n\nThe emperor Heraclius (610-641), who had to deal with those appalling events, ushers in profound changes in the Empire. As the armies retreated from the shattered frontiers, they were settled in areas of Anatolia intended to support them in the absence of all the revenues from the lost provinces. This was the beginning of the \"theme\" military divisions, which eventually replaced the old Roman provinces. Also Greek rather than Latin began to be used for all official purposes. Heraclius himself, very symbolically, adopted the Greek title of \"king,\" basileus, in honor of his crushing defeat of the Persian emperor, who had always been called the \"Great King,\" megas basileus -- though the Greek term autokratōr, \"Autocrat\" was always regarded and used as the equivalent of imperator (a practice that survived in Russia, where the Emperor was officially \"Tsar and Autocrat\").\n\nFurther divisions are clear enough: from 610 to the end of the Macedonian Dynasty in 1059 we have a period, almost exactly covered by Whittow, of disaster, survival, recovery, and triumph. This great story gives us \"Middle Romania,\" when a transformed empire found a new identity, achieved remarkable status and, at least against the Bulgars, exacted a terrible revenge.\n\nFinally, from 1059, when the late Macedonian Dynasty had already subverted, through debasement, favoritism, and neglect of the army, the pillars of Mediaeval Roman power, we have the decline, with periodic partial recoveries (the Comneni & early Palaeologi), all the way down to what John Julius Norwich calls the \"almost unbearably tragic\" end with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.\n\nWhether \"Late Byzantium\" or \"Late Romania,\" we have the story whereby the Cosmopolitan Empire of Nations, founded on conquest and history and refounded on religion, vanishes altogether. It is replaced, however, with an Islāmic Empire, that of the Turks, Rūm and Rumelia, that in some ways, mutatis mutandis, was not unlike Romania. That survived until the last Sulṭān was deposed in 1922, and Constantinople ceased being a capital, and a home for Emperors (Tsargrad), for the first time since Constantine.\n\nThus, as in the imaginary volumes at left, the appropriate treatment would be a continuous history from Augustus to Meḥmed VI. To be sure, it may be too much to regard the Ottoman Empire as a version of the Roman Empire, but Bāyezīd as the Sulṭān of Rūm was claiming to be a kind of successor, and the Ottoman state did encompass all the lands of Mediaeval Romania, from its own capital at Constantinople.

I have extended the \"Roman Empire\" line up to its traditional termination in 476, which is still significant as the customary boundary between Ancient and Mediaeval Times. In terms of practice, the \"Byzantium\" line could begin almost anywhere within the \"Late Roman Empire\" period, or later. The Fall of Constantinople in 1453 itself is one of the traditional termination dates for the Middle Ages, though less popular than Columbus in 1492. [note]\n\nWith Heraclius the Roman Empire had returned to what in a sense had always been its true character: a Hellenistic Kingdom. When Constantine XI was killed by the Turks in 1453, it was, in many real ways, the end of the Hellenistic world. The meaning of this will be considered in turn; but first, it must be asked: \"Well, OK, the Empire of Diocletian and Constantine has a natural transition to the collapse under the miserable emperor Phocas in 602-610, but can the collapse of the western Empire be so easily dismissed? Is 476 really so insigificant? Can the kingdoms of the Germans be so demoted? And why, after all, did the Western Empire collapse?\n\nThe Emperors Who Weren't\n\nThese are good questions, which brings us back to Odoacer, and his predecessors. The Roman Empire looked fine in 395, the year of the death of Theodosius the Great. The frontiers were secure, orthodoxy was established, the Visigoths were pacified, and Theodosius, doubtlessly with a mind at peace (he had even patched up a nasty excommunication by St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan [not Rome, notice]), left the Empire to his young sons, Honorius and Arcadius, under the protection of his trusted, and in fact trustworthy, commander, Stilicho.\n\nStilicho was Odoacer's first precedessor: a German commander of the Roman army. This might sound odd, but it didn't seem so odd at the time. Germans had long been in the Roman army. Marcus Aurelius, who was Roman enough for any scholar, took a whole tribe of barbarians, the Iazygians (who had fought with Germans but were actually Iranian), into the Roman army. This had not created problems. And the army had always filled up with the most warlike inhabitants of the Empire. At the time, German refugees and interlopers were certainly the most warlike.\n\nBut with Stilicho, something was different. His young charges were weak and worthless; and worse, they had divided the Empire into east and west again, and the two courts were intriguing against each other, with Stilicho often caught in the middle. The Visigoths started acting up, and for obscure reasons Stilicho may have avoided, or lost, or been prevented from, having the chance to annihilate them. That, in retrospect, is what needed to be done. Germans in the army was one thing, but an independent, belligerent tribe in the midst of the Empire was something else.\n\nTheodosius had allowed, or been compelled to allow (he could not defeat the Goths), this to happen. The Visigoths, after their experience before Adrianople, were not going to be dispersed in settlement or in the army as Roman practice previously would have required. The individual Visigoths who were off in the Roman army at the time of Adrianople had been murdered. So now the tribe stuck together.\n\nArther Ferrill, in The Fall of the Roman Empire, the Military Explanation [Thames and Hudson, London, 1986], identifies this as the fatal, catastrophic mistake in Roman policy. Germans in the Roman army became Romans. Germans in a German tribe remained German; and as the Roman army assimilated itself to the influence of the German model, it lost its advantage of discipline over its German enemies. It became a kind of German tribe itself.\n\nStill, this need not have been fatal. Stilicho could have swept aside the intrigue, organized his resources, and annihilated the tribal Visigoths through one simple act: seizing the throne. He didn't, and eventually was executed by Honorius (in 408). What happened next is revealing: the army seemed to disintegrate.\n\nIndeed, as earlier in the rebellion of the Visigoths, the Romans turned on the Germans in the Army. But the purge of Germans did not strengthen the Army, as later it would in the East under Leo. Instead, the surviving Germans decamped to the Visigoths; and, unlike with the Isaurians under Leo, there was no one to replace them. Honorius never contested any action of the Goths, who only left Italy when they ran out of steam.\n\nSo the Visigoths, repeatedly defeated by Stilicho, swept into Italy and took Rome in 410, while Honorius sat safe in Ravenna. A Roman Army of Italy remained, but the Germans brought into the army by Stilicho were gone. This effectively eliminated the Roman Army to the point that the Visigoths could not be met in battle with any chance of success. In seizing the throne, Stilicho would have lost legitimacy with the East, but by not seizing the throne, Stilicho and his successors passed on after them weak civilian governments, often with young, jealous emperors and scheming regents, at a time when the ferocity of third century warrior emperors was badly needed again. In 410, only fifteen years after the death of Theodosius, the western empire had become all but paralyzed, with the Goths in Rome itself, the Vandals, Alans, the Suevi rampaging across Gaul and Spain, and Britain stripped of troups by the usurper Constantine, who moved into Gaul. The western emperors never recovered, as Britain itself was henceforth left to its own devices.\n\nWhat may have been personal loyalty to the Throne in Stilicho obviously becomes something else later: the commander Ricimer, who presided over a critical era in the dissolution of the western Empire, 456-472, made two or three emperors himself, briefly accepted a candidate from the east (Anthemius, 467-472), and through the whole business did not do what now seems like the obvious: He did not get his own army to elevate him to the Purple. Like more than half a dozen commanders from Stilicho to Odoacer, Ricimer did not do what every legionary commander on the frontier back in the third century dreamed of doing: becoming emperor himself.\n\nThese were \"the emperors who weren't,\" the soldiers who passed up the time honored Roman custom of killing an emperor, cleaning out the intrigue, paying off the veterans, and then marching out to massacre the barbarians. Why in the world would they not have done that? It doesn't make any sense. A book about them from 1983 by John Michael O'Flynn, is called Generalissimos of the Western Roman Empire [U of Alberta Press], giving them the title used by Joseph Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek in World War II to show that they outranked everyone. Why would someone who outranked everyone be content to \"serve\" some weak, pathetic puppet emperor?\n\nThe answer is simple enough: They were Germans. They were not Roman citizens. They were resident aliens. They could have all kinds of Roman titles. They could aspire to be recognized as German kings federated with Rome, but they were simply not qualified to be emperors [note].\n\nJust because Caracalla had made all Roman subjects into citizens did not mean that anyone who wandered in over the Rhine or Danube was automatically a citizen. They weren't. One commander, Gundobad, was already king of the Burgundians and simply returned to his tribe when Julius Nepos and Orestes deposed him (and his puppet emperor Glycerius) in 473. Nothing, indeed, is so revealing about the extraordinary symbiosis of Romania and Germania in the fifth century.\n\nThe illiterate (who weren't illiterate) pagan (who weren't pagan) German hordes (who were actually in the Roman army) who trampled down the Roman legionnaires with their invincible cavalry (we'll get to that shortly) played by such Marquess of Queensberry Rules that it never occurred to them to claim a position that their citizenship didn't entitle them to! It was more than three centuries before a German, a Frank finally, dared to claim the imperial status for himself; and Charlemagne had the excuse of a woman, for the first time, on the throne in Constantinople (Irene, 780-802) and a Pope who was perfectly happy to inflate his own authority into that of emperor-maker.\n\nSo the western Empire crumbled, not because of decadence, not because of Christianity, not because of pagan hordes, but because of the scrupulous observance of the privileges of citizenship.\n\nThat the Germans did not otherwise have any military advantage is also an important point. Cavalry may have decided the battle of Adrianople, but not because the Goths were all mounted, or because the Romans did not have much or much very good cavalry, or because cavalry had some kind of real military advantage over infantry.\n\nIn most of military history, cavalry could decide battles only when infantry had become tired or disorganized and the cavalry managed to strike at a decisive moment. This happened at Adrianople. On their left flank, the Roman cavalry had actually defeated the Visigothic cavalry and driven it away. In the time honored manner, it began to sweep around to the rear of the Gothic army, to surround and destroy it. Unfortunately, it ran into the fortified Gothic camp, built with wagons into an effective defense against cavalry. This checked and discomfited the Roman forces, just as German reinforcements arrived on their flank. The Roman cavalry was then defeated in turn, and the Goths were able to sweep around the Roman left.\n\nIt was thus not really Gothic cavalry that won the battle, but, ironically, Gothic fortifications. When the Flemings and Swiss discovered in the 14th and 15th centuries that they could stop a charge of mounted and armored knights with nothing more sophisticated than pikes, it became obvious that all infantry had ever needed to win battles was discipline, determination, and some money. Gunpowder had little to do with the end of feudal knighthood. Rich cities and determined citizen soldiers had everything to do with it. Cavalry had dominated in the meantime, to any extent that it ever did, just because the money didn't exist to raise real armies and there was a premium on the mobility of the smaller, feudal forces, where the nobles could also supply their own horses [note].\n\nThe traditional story about German cavalry doesn't even make a lot of sense: As Ferrill points out, an effective cavalry requires not one but many horses per rider. Whittow mentions Marco Polo's observation that each Mongol warrior maintained as many as 18 remounts. And horses need to be fed. This is not easy to do without organized logistics, unless you are nomads living on natural grassland like the steppe. The Mongols could move an entire mounted army from China to Hungary, but beyond that they encountered difficulties. The German tribes were in no position to maintain such a large mounted establishment. The Romans were. The Romans had stud farms and all the grain and logistics to maintain their cavalry. They had been doing it for some time. What the Romans lost then was their discipline and organization, and this occurred through the Germanization of the army, even as the German commanders of the same were no more ready to seize the ultimate Roman honor for themselves than the Romans were to bestow it on them.\n\nThis dilemma did not go unobserved or entirely misunderstood at the time; and the emperor Leo I (457-474) had in fact taken steps to remedy it: He purged the eastern army of Germans and brought in the most warlike Roman citizens he could find, rebellious Isaurians from the mountains of Anatolia, to brace up the ranks. With them came the future emperor Zeno himself, who assumed a properly Greek name (Ζήνων) in place of his clearly un-Greek original one: Tarasikodissa (or Tarasis Kokisa, where the latter is a patronymic; also Rousombladiotēs, i.e. the native of Rusumblada in Isauria). This was just what the doctor ordered for the eastern Empire. And when Zeno invited the Ostrogothic king Theodoric to get rid of Odoacer and rule Italy, the eastern empire stood free of a German presence for the first time in a century. Soon the tables would be turned.\n\nRecently, Peter Heather, who also rejects arguments about Roman decadence, argues in his The Fall of the Roman Empire [Oxford, 2006] that the Roman system was simply overwhelmed by the numbers of the immigrating tribes, that the Roman Army, although large enough on paper, could only bring to bear forces that were actually outnumbered by the Goths, Vandals, Suevi, etc., and that the occupation of Roman lands in Gaul, Spain, and North Africa damaged the Roman tax base enough that the Army could not recover. In his view Constantius and Aëtius went a long way to restoring the integrity of the Western Empire. Constantius defeated the usurper Constantine, recovered Gaul for the Emperor, and then got the Visigoths to help him destroy most of the Alans and Vandals in Spain -- unfortunately leaving the Suevi and Asding Vandals to do more damage.\n\nNevertheless, this was progess, and Constantius was even made co-Emperor for it, marrying Honorius's sister and fathering Valentinian III. Unfortunately, Constantius then died, and before a strong hand could be restored, the Vandals crossed over into Africa. This was all some very bad luck, but not all was lost. When Aëtius gained control, it looked again like there was someone to handle things. The Vandals were stopped, and when they did move again and took Carthage, a joint East-West expedition was organized against them in 441.\n\nAs Heather asserts, and the Romans agreed, it was essential that North Africa be regained, for its tax base, its food supply, and, I might add, to recover control of the Sea from the Vandals. Unfortunately, the expedition was cancelled because Attila became aggressive and all forces were needed against him. Previously, Aëtius had been able to call on the Huns for support. While the defeat of the Huns was followed by Aëtius's murder and a period of confusion, Ricimer accepted the Eastern candidate, Anthemius, as Western Emperor, as part of a plan for another joint expedition in 468 against the Vandals.\n\nWith 1000 ships, this should have worked, but the Romans did not exactly have a lot of experience in amphibious operations, there was incompetence and perhaps treachery involved (both in the person of Basiliscus, who later tried to overthrow Zeno), and the Vandals fleet, under the brilliant Gaiseric, was able to break up the landing. The treasury of Leo I had been exhausted by the effort, and as Heather puts it, this was the fatal moment when Western recovery became impossible. The Western Empire collapsed in a shambles, leaving only Italy to central control.\n\nHow far does Peter Heather's perspective go in explaining events? A good way, but there are still anomalies. His book begins with striking examples of Roman Legions fighting effectively against overwhelming barbarian forces. We never learn why purely Roman forces should have been so relatively ineffective in the Fifth Century. Little good was accomplished without barbarian help. Stilicho relied on Gothic recruits, Constantius on the Visigoths themselves, and Aëtius on the Huns. Arther Ferrill's argument provides an explanation. Roman discipline was compromised by too many unassimilated barbarian recruits. Where purely Roman forces were involved, with a good chance of success, in the expedition of 468, a combination of bad luck and bad strategy doomed it. How well it could have succeeded can be seen in Belisarius's landing of 533, with half as many ships, which was dramatically successful. If the expedition of 468 had gone as well, there is no telling what the consequences might have been. But by 533 it was really too late to revive the Western Empire the way it had been. Roman forces in the traditional form, in the West, had ceased to exist.\n\nWhich perhaps raises another question. When Hannibal wiped out whole Roman armies, Rome simply raised new ones. There doesn't seem to have been a problem with the tax base. Perhaps the loss of Roman strength in the 5th century was not entirely an artifact of barbarization. The paid, professional Army of the Late Empire was no longer a citizen army, and it could not simply be expanded rapidly with drafts of civilians. So I detect a number of problems in the Fall of the West:\n\nDivided authority, without soldier Emperors, where a successful commander, like Aëtius, could be murdered out of envy, or German commanders were ineligible for the Throne;\n\nLoss of discipline as German recruits overwhelmed the traditional Roman model of discipline and organization (Flavius Vegetius in De Re Militari, c.390, himself liked this explanation); and\n\nThe inability of the Roman State to effectively draw on its manpower. The previous impression, that the Late Empire had declined in population and prosperity is something that Peter Heather effectively argues against. That leaves an institutional problem. The citizens of Romania were not expected, one and all, to become soldiers, the way those of Rome were in the 3rd Century BC. This was a problem effected simply by centuries of general peace, in which a merely professional army was sufficient.\n\nThe paradigm of the mounted knight, derived from the small forces used by barbarian nobility, would, significantly, be overthrown by citizen armies, those of Flanders, as at the Battle of the Golden Spurs against France in 1302, and those of the Swiss, as at the Battle of Sempach against the Hapsburgs in 1368, or especially at the Battle of Nancy against the Duke of Burgundy in 1477. A similar phenomenon could be seen when the professional armies of the 18th century were swept away by the mass citizen drafts of the French Revolution. The Roman Republic benefited from a comparable mechanism, but the Empire, largely because of its very success, had lost that advantage. [note]\n\nSummary\n\nThe Roman Empire grew and succeeded because conquered peoples became Romans. Thus, what began as a City State came to encompass Latium, then Italy, and then, eventually, the \"world.\" Citizenship, indeed, was extended gradually; but that is precisely why the process worked. Citizenship had substantial benefits, people came to know about them, and the status was something to aspire to, something valued. In the course of this, people became acculturated to Roman institutions and interests and were subsequently proud to become citizens. We've been conquered, yes; but now we are the conquerors!\n\nAn early effect of this was the difficulty that Hannibal had in tempting the cities of southern Italy away from their Roman allegiance. The Italians knew two things: (1) Roman vengeance was sure and merciless; and (2) Hannibal could hardly offer the benefits that the Roman connection already did. All were then able to see what happened to the cities that did go over to Hannibal. Later, St. Paul, although a Jew, knew the value, and used it, of his own Roman citizenship.\n\nEventually, the whole process reached a culimination in Caracalla's Constitutio Antoniniana of 212 AD, which gave citizenship to all free subjects of the Empire. Now, one might think that this would devalue the privilege into meaninglessness. However, it signified a very formative step in the evolution of the Roman state. There is now no legal difference between inhabitants of Rome, of Italy, or of anywhere else. This means the end of the Empire as a possession of the inhabitants of the City of Rome. As noted above, Rome becomes Romania, and anyone from anywhere, such as (already) Septemius Severus himself, a North African probably of Phoenician origin, can become Emperor. Soon, Rome will lose almost all of its political importance; and Emperors such as Diocletian will not even visit Rome except as a symbolic afterthought. After a bit of wandering, political power will settled on Constantinople, where Constantine, despite some early attention to Rome, spent his last years.\n\nThis epic demographic evolution has had little impact on public awareness or discourse about the Roman Empire. I just saw a documentary with the positive assertion that the Roman Empire was \"ruled from one City, Rome\" -- a statement true enough in the first or second century AD, but increasingly false thereafter. Yet without an awareness of this evolution, we have no hope of understanding the history of the barbarian invasions, the \"fall\" of the West, or the continuation of Romania in the East. Thus, the process of Romanization did not end with the Constitutio Antoniniana, for Rome continued to accept non-Romans into the Empire. Barbarians joined the Roman Army. This became the means of their acculturation and naturalization.\n\nThe original mechanism was that non-Romans became auxiliaries -- cavalry, skirmishers, etc. -- to the Legions. After their service, they received citizenship. We see a rough and ready version of this quite early, when the Numidian cavalry, which had been one of Hannibal's mainstays, went over the Romans and enabled Scipio Africanus to defeat Hannibal at Zama in 202 BC. Later, we get the full formal mechanism when Marcus Aurelius takes the Sarmatian tribe of the Iazyges, whom he had defeated in 175, into Roman service, settling them with the Legio VI Victrix in the north of Britain (where many of them, probably in retirement, ended up at Bremetenacum Veteranorum, south of Lancaster). This became an effective, venerable, and indispensable system. It brought new, wild blood into the Army, but it also domesticated barbarians into being good Romans.\n\nWhat eventually went wrong is that the system became overwhelmed. The Huns bumped whole nations across the rivers and into the Empire. Thus, the Goths were accepted across the Danube as refugees. At first, the traditional process seemed to be working, as Goths entered the Army and began their acculturation in Roman ways. However, there were too many Goths, and the surplus remained in what were essentially refugee camps. We are all too familiar now with what life is like in such places. It is also rather like what happened to the Plains Indians when they were restricted to Reservations. Promises of supplies, even when delivered, still leave a people demoralized and with nothing to do. At the same time, if the provision of supplies is subject to corruption, theft, negligence, or even extortion, it becomes enough to, say, start a rebellion. This is exactly what happened with the Goths. The Romans did not have a tradition of caring for large numbers of refugees; and there was very little sense of how to do that, or how to stop the corruption and exploitation that would grow like mold on an apparently helpless people. The Goths were not demoralized enough that they were willing to take that, any more than Sitting Bull, and they had fellows, potential allies, who had not yet entered the Empire.\n\nSo we get the fatal moment at Adrianople in 378. Goths already in the Roman Army were murdered, and the victorious tribe would simply never be assimilated or naturalized. This was bad enough, but then at the beginning of 407 the Suevi, Vandals, and Alans crossed the Rhine without so much as a by-your-leave and embarked on a good ravage of Gaul and Spain. But there was a difference between the former and the latter. The Goths still rather aspired to be Romans. When pacified by Theodosius I in 382 the Goths became foederati, or formal Roman allies, as the Franks had been for some time. One difference there was that the Franks straddled the frontier in Gaul, while the Goths were lodged in the middle of the Balkans. But all was not lost. It did not help, however, that Theodosius put them, like Uriah the Hittite, at the forefront of the battle at the Frigidus River in 394. The result was some increasing estrangement and trouble (including a sack of Rome in 410), but then things settled down again. King Athaulf of the Visigoths (410-415) eventually said:\n\nAt first I wanted to erase the Roman name and convert all Roman territory into a Gothic Empire: I longed for Romania to become Gothia, and Athaulf to be what Caesar Augustus had been. But long experience has taught me that the ungoverned wildness of the Goths will never submit to laws, and that without law, a state is not a state. Therefore I have more prudently chosen the different glory of reviving the Roman name with Gothic vigour, and I hope to be acknowledged by posterity as the initiator of a Roman restoration, since it is impossible for me to alter the character of this Empire. [Orosius, Adversum Paganos, translated in Stephen Williams, Diocletian and the Roman Recovery, Routledge, 1985, 2000, p.218, boldface added]\n\nThe Visigoths were officially settled in Aquitaine and eliminated the Alans and Vandals (if not the Suevi) from Spain. Thus, as with the Franks and then the Burgundians, the Goths were officially operating as subjects of Romania and might even have been an instrument, as Athaulf says, of restoring Roman power. The historian Orosius (c.418 AD), quoting Athaulf, was optimistic that the help the Goths would indeed enable the restoration of the Empire as it was.\n\nFor many years a colleague of mine had a cartoon on his office door showing a Goth, in some kind of barbarian dress (i.e. animal skins, like Neanderthals), amid the ruins of Rome, and some kind of pillaging going on in the background, but with him apologizing: \"We were just looking for some poems. Sorry if we broke some stuff.\" This bears some curious relation to reality. But it wasn't enough. The Vandals, Suevi, Lombards, and Saxons were never foederati, and the effectiveness, or the commitment, or even the meaningfulness of the Visigoths, Burgundians, Franks as allies faded as metropolitian Roman power, at least in the West, faded steadily. Soon there was no point to it.\n\nThe previously effective institutions of Romanization were thus overwhelmed by numbers, and even the adaptation of making tribes into foederati was not enough to handle the influx -- but only contributed to the erosion of discipline and loyalty in the Army. At the same time, the flood that swamped the West bypassed the East. So Romania survived (and the Army was purged of Germans), although, as noted above, this is another circumstance that in popular discourse, or even in academic opinion, is only poorly appreciated. Eventually pared down to the Balkans and Anatolia, the Empire finally consisted mainly of Greeks, or at least Greek speakers, as well as Armenians, Albanians, Vlachs, etc. Conquered and humiliated by Rome, the Greeks inherited Romania and subsequently always called themselves Rhōmaîoi. This, of course, is incomprehensible unless one understands the meaning and consequences of the Constitutio Antoniniana, let alone Christianization. As such, it is well over the horizon of popular culture, much academic culture, or Hollywood -- to whom the history of \"Byzantium\" is like something from science fiction, if even that. I cannot say that there has ever been a \"Byzantine\" Emperor represented in a Hollywood movie -- or a Constantinople that was not already İstanbul.\n\nFor my purposes here, what must be noted is that this demographic infiltration and undermining of the Roman West had nothing to do with decadence, Christianity, civil wars, monarchy, loss of civic virtue, orientalization, individualism, bureaucratization, demoralization, lead poisoning, slavery, or any of the other theorized or imagined failures or ills of Roman society in Late Antiquity. If those were real explanations, the East would have had as much of a problem as the West, and obviously it did not. At the same time, the collapse of the West was a catastrophe, and the Dark Ages were real enough.\n\nSome defenders of the traditional ideology of the \"Fall of Rome\" seem to characterize the opposing thesis, that Rome survived at Constantinople, as a view that nothing really bad happened and that the Middle Ages entered with a kind of cultural evolution but no real \"Darkness,\" a view apparently held by some. But if anyone wants to defend the traditional i"
