        "text": "“A good man and an earnest question” based on…\n\nI\n\ndon’t know about you, but I have always been haunted by this\n\nscripture passage. It’s on the short list of texts where I hope\n\nJesus didn’t mean exactly what he said, but I’m never quite sure.\n\nI do know that the story of the Rich Young Ruler is impossible to\n\ndismiss: It appears in all three synoptic Gospels and it ranks among\n\nthe most famous of biblical stories.\n\nThe\n\nwords “rich young ruler” don’t actually appear in the text. I\n\ndon’t know when this story acquired that name, but it does us a\n\ndisservice in some ways. We hear “rich young ruler” and we think,\n\n“that’s not me.” We might think, “I’m not rich,” or “I’m\n\nnot that rich.” Many of us think, “I’m not young” (I know my\n\nknees think I’m not young and that I should act my age and stop\n\nclimbing mountains already). And probably none of us here identify as\n\na “ruler” – though if you changed that to “manager” a few\n\nof us, myself included, would identify with it.\n\nBut\n\nthose words, rich young ruler, aren’t in the text, and if we put\n\nthat familiar label aside and listen to the man’s story, and\n\nimagine who he might be in our own time, he starts to sound a lot\n\nmore like many of us.\n\nAllow\n\nme to update the story for you.\n\nImagine\n\nthe scene: The teacher is leaving. His lecture is done, the Q&A\n\nis over, he’s in the parking lot packing up his car, getting ready\n\nto head home. And a man comes running up to him, out of breath. He\n\nhas a burning question on his mind and he didn’t get called on\n\nduring the discussion but he just knows he must catch the teacher\n\nbefore he leaves town.\n\nHe\n\nkneels down – he’s a huge fan, he has tremendous respect for the\n\nteacher, he’s read all of his books – and he asks: “Good\n\nteacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”\n\nHe’s\n\na good man, and it’s an earnest question.\n\nNow,\n\nwe need to step back for a moment from our 21st-century\n\nparking lot to 1st-century\n\nPalestine to understand the words in this question. When we hear the\n\nwords “eternal life” many of us think of an afterlife, going to\n\nheaven after we die, something separate from this life. But that is\n\nnot at all what it meant in Jesus’s time. Rather than being a\n\ntemporal idea, something about some future time, eternal life as\n\nJesus spoke about it was about a quality\n\nof life – about knowing God, a life lived connected to God, a\n\nricher life of purpose. It isn’t separate from this life.\n\nThe\n\nphrase “eternal life” is used interchangeably with “kingdom of\n\nGod” and “kingdom of heaven” throughout the synoptic Gospels.\n\nIt is about living into, establishing the kingdom – the reign –\n\nthe dominion – of God and doing it now.\n\nIn\n\nthat way, it is about living into and working for God’s vision for\n\nthe world. This is most explicit in the Lord’s prayer: “Thy\n\nkingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.”\n\nSo\n\nthe man’s question, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”\n\nis a question about what it takes to be part of the kingdom, what it\n\ntakes to do the work of the kingdom, to have that richer, purposeful\n\nlife, to work for God’s vision in the world.\n\nHe’s\n\na good man, and it’s an earnest question.\n\nAnd\n\nJesus says to him, “you know the commandments: ‘you shall not\n\nmurder.’”\n\nAnd\n\nthe man thinks, “OK, I’ve got that one. Check.”\n\n“You\n\nshall not commit adultery.”\n\n“Well,\n\nI’m no Donald Trump. So, check.”\n\n“You\n\nshall not steal.”\n\n“There\n\nwas that time I really wanted to steal my little brother’s baseball\n\nmitt.\n\nBut I didn’t. Check.”\n\n“You\n\nshall not bear false witness.”\n\n“Not\n\nalways easy, but at the end of the day it’s just not right\n\ndenigrate anyone else’s reputation, no matter what you think of\n\nthem. Yeah, check.”\n\n“You\n\nshall not defraud.”\n\n“I’ve\n\nalways been an honest businessman. Main Street, not Wall Street. I’ve paid my employees fairly, never cheated my customers or sold those\n\ncheaper widgets that break too quickly. Check.”\n\n“Honor\n\nyour father and mother.”\n\n“Always.\n\nWhen Dad got sick, I was in the hospital every day, and when he\n\npassed away, we had Mom move in with us, even though we didn’t have\n\na lot of extra room. Yes, check.”\n\nAnd\n\nthen he thinks, “phew!” and says to Jesus, “I have kept all\n\nthese since my youth.”\n\nIt’s\n\nnot a cocky response. He’s not saying, “Hey, look how great I\n\nam.” After all, the very fact that he’s there in the parking lot\n\nwith that question, “what must I do…” indicates that he has\n\ndoubts that he’s doing enough.\n\nBut\n\nhe’s good man. He’s lived an upright life; he’s done right by\n\nhis family, his neighbors, friends, his employees, his customers. He\n\ncoaches Little League, he organizes the annual charity dinner for the\n\nlocal hospital, he goes to church every Sunday.\n\nHe’s\n\nserious about his faith. That’s why he’s there with that\n\nquestion. It’s an earnest question.\n\nAnd\n\nJesus sees all of that. Mark says “Jesus, looking at him, loved\n\nhim.” Jesus doesn’t discount any of what the man has done when he\n\nsays this next thing to him:\n\n“You\n\nlack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor\n\nand you will have treasure in heaven; then, come, follow me.”\n\nIt’s\n\nnot that what the man has done is bad, it’s just that Jesus is\n\nsaying there’s more. If you truly want to experience eternal life,\n\nif you want to be part of the kingdom, to build the kingdom, to do\n\nGod’s work in the world, there is more; and this is what it is.\n\nOur\n\ngood man is shocked. He’s devastated. And he goes away, the story\n\nsays, “grieving, for he had many possessions.”\n\nCan\n\nyou imagine?\n\nGive\n\nup everything?\n\nI could increase my pledge, he thinks, maybe even tithe. But\n\neverything?\n\nAnd if I give everything away, how will I live? What about my family?\n\nAnd\n\nwhat does it mean, “follow me?” I thought that’s what I was\n\ndoing.\n\nThis\n\nstory is about many things, including the undisputable bias against\n\neconomic wealth that runs throughout the Bible.\n\nBut\n\nit’s about other things, too.\n\nNow\n\nI don’t know if we are all supposed to literally sell everything.\n\nI\n\ndo know how the Rich Young Ruler feels when he hears that, though.\n\nBecause I have many possessions, too, and as much as I want to follow\n\nJesus, I know right now I am not giving away everything I own. I\n\ncan’t bring myself to do it. Or at least not yet, I won’t say\n\nnever.\n\nBut\n\nI want to sidestep the question this morning of how literally to take\n\nthis directive and focus instead on another dimension of the message\n\nin the story.\n\nThis\n\nscripture is about reflection and self-assessment, and then about\n\nencountering judgment from a higher power that leads to deeper\n\nreflection and self-assessment.\n\nThe\n\nman asks how he’s doing spiritually. He takes stock as he reviews\n\nhow he’s lived up to the commandments Jesus lists. And then he is\n\nissued a deeper challenge; and through that he comes to recognize how\n\nmuch more he has than he realized, how much more he could give, and\n\nhow very hard it would be to do it.\n\nAt\n\nits heart, this is a story about recognizing privilege in our lives.\n\nAnd\n\nin this Trumpian moment, when the oppressors pretend that they are\n\nthe oppressed, when the vulnerable are scapegoated, I cannot think of\n\na more relevant lesson for our times.\n\nI\n\nwant to suggest to you that the most useful way to understand and\n\napply this story in our lives today is not to focus only on literal\n\neconomic wealth, but to think about currencies of power and privilege\n\nthroughout our lives – whether that be economic privilege we have\n\nbecause of our income or family background, institutional power or\n\nstatus that we have through a position we hold at work or in the\n\ncommunity, or social privilege that we have because of our race or\n\nsex, religion or immigration status, our ethnicity or sexuality.\n\nWhat\n\nJesus is calling us to do in this story is to look deeper at\n\neverything we have, at how exactly we fit into the many social\n\nstructures we each are a part of, to recognize where we have\n\nprivilege and power in our lives—and to understand that following\n\nhim means putting all of it into play.\n\nBeing\n\na part of the kingdom of God, doing the work of the kingdom means\n\nholding nothing back. If it is God’s intent and desire that no one\n\nbe excluded; that no one is inside or outside or better than or worse\n\nthan; that the poor, the marginalized and the oppressed of this world\n\nare to be welcomed and defended, then we cannot be a part of that if\n\nwe insist on holding onto our own privilege and power. We must be\n\nwilling to risk our privilege if we are serious about seeking eternal\n\nlife and working in the service of God’s vision for the world.\n\nTo\n\nsay that this is difficult is an understatement. And the Rich Young\n\nRuler, our good man, has plenty of company among those who are\n\nunwilling or unable to give up what they have, to use their privilege\n\nor risk their privilege, in the service of God’s kingdom.\n\nThe\n\nwhite person who remains silent when her neighbors are talking about\n\n“those illegals” at the block party, and how glad they are that\n\nwe’re going to build that wall – even though she knows her\n\nsilence means they will think she agrees.\n\nThe\n\nup-and-coming manager who crosses the picket line because the CEO\n\nsent a memo saying all non-union workers were to report to duty as\n\nnormal – even though he knows that crossing that line means the\n\nstrike will be broken and the workers won’t get the healthcare\n\ntheir families so desperately need.\n\nThe\n\nsenators who say they are opposed to Trump’s bigotry, his nominees,\n\nhis unconstitutional executive orders, but enable business as usual\n\nto proceed – even though that business puts in harm’s way\n\nmillions of undocumented immigrants, Muslims, LGBTQI people, and\n\npeople covered by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nClergy\n\npeople, and especially bishops and other high-ranking clergy people,\n\nwho do not use their status as moral authority figures to denounce\n\nthe rising tide of white nationalism because they are afraid of\n\nbacklash from some in their congregations or from other church\n\nofficials. Silence, as the gay community reminded the world during\n\nthe early AIDS crisis, IS complicity.\n\nJesus\n\nis speaking to all of these people, and to all of us, in this story.\n\nSpeaking up, using your privilege, disrupting the harm, risking your\n\nsecurity to protect the vulnerable – that is the work of the\n\nkingdom.\n\nIn\n\nLuke’s story, after the man goes away grieving, Jesus piles on with\n\none of the Bible’s most famous one-liners: “It is easier for a\n\ncamel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich\n\nto enter the kingdom of God.” As if we weren’t already feeling\n\nlike what Jesus is asking is impossible. Indeed, the disciples had\n\nthe same reaction. “Then who can be saved?” they ask one another.\n\nIf\n\nthe story ended here, it would be a bitter tale about our inability\n\nto give up power and privilege for the pursuit of justice. And most\n\nof human history confirms this dark narrative.\n\nBut\n\nit’s not\n\nthe end of the story.\n\nJesus\n\nsays to his disciples, “For mortals it is impossible, but not for\n\nGod; for God all things are possible.”\n\nDo\n\nyou believe that? Do you believe that God can inspire mortals to\n\ngreat acts of daring and personal sacrifice for human freedom?\n\nI\n\ndo.\n\nBecause\n\nthat dark narrative of history is interrupted time and again, in big\n\nways and small, by another narrative, one about the irrepressible\n\nstruggle for truth, for justice, for freedom.\n\nMartin\n\nLuther: “Here I stand. I can do no other.” All things are\n\npossible for God.\n\nHarriet\n\nTubman: She risked her own life over and over to free others from\n\nslavery. All things are possible for God.\n\nThe\n\nFreedom Riders: Black and white women and men together defying\n\nsegregation laws in the face of violence, jail, and constant danger.\n\nYes, all things are possible for God.\n\nThe\n\nU.S. Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 60s is, to me, the finest\n\nchapter of our nation’s history precisely because it is such\n\neloquent testimony to how God moves in the world inspiring people to\n\nmajestic heights of courage and sacrifice and love.\n\nGod\n\nis there, too, making all things possible, with every conscientious\n\nobjector, with every whistleblower who risks her job to expose unsafe\n\nwork conditions or government crimes.\n\nAnd\n\nGod is here, now, in the incredible stand indigenous people have\n\ntaken to protect native lands and water against the Dakota Access\n\nPipeline, in which they have faced down attack dogs, concussion\n\ngrenades, water cannons in sub-freezing weather, and arrests, among\n\nother things, and yet remain standing at Standing Rock, in prayer and\n\nwitness for the earth itself.\n\nGod\n\nis here in the thousands of federal employees who have gone rogue,\n\nrisking their jobs by copying data to make sure it’s not destroyed,\n\nfiling dissent memos, leaking information to the media and sharing\n\ninformation directly with the public.\n\nGod\n\nis here in the resistance to the Muslim ban and the deportation\n\norders, in the activists who laid their bodies down in front of an\n\nICE van last week to prevent the deportation of Guadalupe García and\n\nin the rabbis who were arrested blockading a Manhattan street in\n\ndefense of their Muslim sisters and brothers and siblings. In the\n\nthousands upon thousands of protesters who have taken to the streets\n\nevery day of the Trump presidency, shoulder to shoulder with people\n\nthey had heretofore avoided, chanting “no prisons, no pipelines, no\n\nban, no wall.”\n\nYes,\n\nall things are possible for God.\n\nThe\n\nquestion for all of us is, What\n\nthings will we let God make possible in our lives? Where\n\nare the places we are called to recognize and risk the power and\n\nprivilege we have to do the work of God’s kingdom?\n\nThe\n\nanswers to these questions are as unique as each of us and our\n\nrelationship with God. But if we want to inherit eternal life and do\n\nthe work of God’s kingdom, we cannot stay silent and safe on the\n\nsidelines while civil rights are rolled back, Muslims are\n\nscapegoated, immigrants are deported, queer and trans people are\n\nbullied, and dissidents are silenced. We cannot.\n\nWhat\n\nwill you risk? How can you use your privilege? If you’re a U.S.\n\ncitizen, will you risk arrest when others cannot? If you’re white,\n\nwill you be part of a buffer zone at demonstrations between police\n\nand people of color in order to minimize the danger of police\n\nviolence against black and brown bodies? If you’re a Christian,\n\nwill you speak up every time you hear an islamophobic remark, whether\n\nit’s your brother-in-law or your boss who makes it?\n\nImagine\n\nyou are at a protest like the one outside the ICE office where\n\nGuadalupe García was held last week. She came to this country when\n\nshe was 14, 21 years ago. She’s married and has two kids, 14 and\n\n16, and has worked hard her whole life. Imagine someone like\n\nGuadalupe is about to be deported. She is in the van. Then comes word\n\nthat there is a safe house that will offer her sanctuary, they just\n\nneed 20 minutes to get someone there to pick her up. The van is about\n\nto leave.\n\nWould\n\nyou lay down in front of that van? Would you tie yourself to the\n\ntires? Would you slash those tires, to buy that 20 minutes?\n\n“Go,\n\nsell what you own, and give the money to the poor and you will have\n\ntreasure in heaven; then, come, follow me.”\n\n“For\n\nGod all things are possible.”\n\nAmen.\n\nFebruary 12, 2017\n\n“Subversive Grace” based on Job 2:7-10\n\nThis\n\nweek a clergy friend reached out with a concern about our United\n\nMethodist Bookstore and recourse center, Cokesbury. In the most\n\nrecent Cokesbury catalog, on page 21, listed under “Women’s\n\nStudies” was a book entitled “Zip It” with a cover image of\n\nwomen’s lips zipped closed. He asked us to join him in expressing\n\ndispleasure. I did. I got a response from Cokesbury that attempted\n\nto reassure me by informing me that I was ignorant of their intent.\n\nThe email informed me that the author, “offers\n\npractical how-to’s meant to inspire her readers to use their words\n\n‘to build, not to break; to bless, not to badger; to encourage, not\n\nto embitter; to praise, not to pounce’. Her work is very\n\nspecific to women’s group Bible study and personal devotion and\n\nreflection.”1\n\nClearly the author of the book along with the author of the email\n\nperceive this to be EMPOWERMENT of women. You might stake a guess\n\nthat I disagree. You’d be right.\n\nNow,\n\nthis particular exchange was fairly trivial this week. It was almost\n\nnothing, except that it served as a reminder of the inherent sexism\n\nin The Church and the resiliency of the patriarchy in the\n\ninstitution. It was just another\n\npiece of frustration and sadness. In the language of Parker Palmer,\n\nit was another expression of the “tragic gap.” He explains it\n\nthis way, “Of\n\nall the tensions we must hold in personal and political life, perhaps\n\nthe most fundamental and most challenging is standing and acting with\n\nhope in the “tragic gap.” On one side of that gap, we see the\n\nhard realities of the world, realities that can crush our spirits and\n\ndefeat our hopes. On the other side of that gap, we see real-world\n\npossibilities, life as we know it could be because we have seen it\n\nthat way.”2\n\nPalmer teaches that much of what we struggle with in life is the\n\nreality of the tragic gap and how to be authentic in response to it.\n\nThe\n\ntragic gap ALWAYS exists. For the past few weeks though it has felt\n\nlike every piece of news, as well as every time I’ve accessed social\n\nmedia, I’ve been bombarded with reminders of the tragic gap. At\n\ntimes it has felt like I’ve been drowning in them. My natural\n\nemotional disposition tends toward happiness and playfulness (along\n\nwith overthinking 😉 ), but recently I’ve been feeling tired,\n\noverwhelmed, and bogged down.\n\nNow,\n\nit feels imperative to mention that I do not think that a publishing\n\nfoible by Cokesbury is a tragedy, it did not send me into a\n\ndepression, and it is not even OVERLY significant. In the face of\n\nthe scope of issues today, it barely registers. I have to say this\n\nbecause the last time I acknowledged being personally harmed by the\n\nexistence sexism in the church at large I was told by Annual\n\nConference Leadership that I was a hysterical woman and sent to\n\nEmotional Intelligence training. So, now that’s cleared up.\n\nTruth\n\nbe told though, there are so very many reminders of the tragic gap\n\nright now that they are piled on top of each other. There are all\n\nthe normal ones and all the exceptionally new ones. I think it is\n\ncreating a phenomenon similar to grief: when a new grief occurs it\n\nalso serves to reawaken all the grief we have experienced before it.\n\nNo one attack on the world as it should be is the problem: they all\n\nadd on to each other and start to snow ball. For many in my life,\n\nI’m hearing that they are now avalanching. Dear friends (please\n\nnote: friends, none of you, I wouldn’t share your struggles from this\n\npulpit) have told me this week that they are experiencing physical\n\nsymptoms of the anxiety they experience given the current depth of\n\nthe tragic gap. I’m also hearing people are having trouble sleeping,\n\nas well as turning to junk food and alcohol to make it through the\n\ndays.\n\nAs\n\nfor myself, this week I noticed that EVERYTHING I try to do is an\n\nuphill battle. It all just feels harder, sort of like how it does\n\nwhen I haven’t taken vacation in entirely too many months. My\n\nyearning has been to sit on the couch, drink tea, pet my cat, and\n\nwatch West Wing and anything more than that requires steeling myself\n\nto do what needs to be done.\n\nI\n\ndon’t know how all of you are doing. I hope some of you are fine and\n\ndandy, with either sufficient coping mechanisms, sufficient hope, or\n\nsufficient joy to counterbalance the world’s problems. I know some\n\nof you are really struggling, and that those struggles are often a\n\ncombination of the world around us and the personal issues that keep\n\ncoming. Perhaps some are also in the middle: aware of the struggles\n\nand making it. After last week’s sermon, and the Biblical book from\n\nwhich we read, many of you may be feeling anxious that I’m about to\n\nmake it worse.\n\nI\n\ndon’t think I am. Ironically enough, Job feels like a friendly\n\nfigure right now, and his story seems to give us reason for hope.\n\nFor those of you who aren’t inherently familiar with the story, let\n\nme summarize quickly: Job is presented as a truly good human.\n\nEveryone agrees that he is “blameless and upright,” faithful to\n\nGod, and even overly observant. He made sacrifices to God JUST IN\n\nCASE one of his sons accidentally sinned. He was also wealthy in the\n\nform of enormous flocks. He and his wife and had 10 children, 7 sons\n\nand 3 daughters. God is said to be proud of Job’s good heart and\n\nfaithfulness.\n\nSuddenly\n\nthings changed: all of his wealth was either killed or stolen. At\n\nthe same time, all of his children, who had been feasting together,\n\nwere killed when a wind knocked down the tent. Job turned to grief\n\nand turned his heart to God in prayer. Then, in our text, his\n\nhealth deteriorated, with painful sores opening all over his entire\n\nbody. He is already sitting on an ash heap and appears to simply,\n\ncalmly, pick up a piece of a broken pot to use to scratch himself.\n\nIt seems that he is already so heartbroken that the physical symptoms\n\nbarely register.\n\nThat\n\nseems right. The deepest grief I have seen in my life has been the\n\ngrief of parents mourning for their children. In the face of losing\n\n10 children, I don’t think anything else would even register. Job’s\n\nwife is convinced that his death is imminent, and even in the midst\n\nof her shared grief, she manages to register the degree of his pain.\n\nThe\n\nmeaning of her words is not entirely clear. She says, “Do you\n\nstill persist in your integrity? Curse God, and die.” The big\n\nquestion is: does she assume he is dying already and wish to ease his\n\ndeath by helping him speak words of truth on the way out; OR does she\n\nbelieve his suffering is too great for anyone to handle and believe\n\nthat if he curses God, God will finally let him die? That is, it\n\nisn’t clear if she thinks he is dying anyway which then also makes it\n\nunclear if she thinks cursing God will kill him. Since this is a\n\nbook especially designed to argue against the idea that a difficult\n\nlife indicates that God is punishing you, I’m going to suggest that\n\nthe more likely meaning is the first: she wishes for him speak out\n\nloud of his pain to ease the suffering on his way to death.\n\nTruly,\n\nJob’s wife speaks with outstanding grace, especially for a woman who\n\nis also grieving the loss of all of her children. The capacity to\n\nattend to anyone else’s pain in the midst of that grief is unusual –\n\nhumans are built that way. She wants his pain to be eased, both\n\nphysically and emotionally. She thinks he is being too stoic, and\n\nshould let go of his pride in order to find some relief. In Bible\n\nStudy we found ourselves telling stories of the end of people’s\n\nlives, and the grace-filled ways we had known loved ones to ease the\n\nend of the dying person’s life. This woman’s words reminded us of\n\nhow difficult it can be to let go of a loved one, and at the same\n\ntime how much of a relief it is when someone we love is no longer\n\nsuffering.\n\nJob’s\n\nwife encouraged him to do what he could do to be at peace at the end\n\nof his life. He refused her, responding that his faith required him\n\nto deal with the pain as it came. In case you haven’t read Job, it\n\nis interesting to note that for chapters upon chapters after this he\n\nexpresses his pain with great intensity. However, the prelude seems\n\nto forget those speeches.\n\nNow,\n\nthe grace-filled response of Job’s wife has not been heard as such\n\nthroughout history. “Chrysostom asked why the Devil left Job his\n\nwife and answered with the suggestion that he considered her a\n\nscourge by which to plague him more acutely than by any other\n\nmeans.”3\n\nYep. And he wasn’t alone, “The ancient tradition, reflected in\n\nAugustine, Chrysostom, Calvin, and many others, that she is an aide\n\nto the satan\n\nunderestimates the complexity of her role.”4\n\nMost male commentators throughout history have condemned Job’s wife\n\nfor her words, seeing her as a part of the problem. I wonder how\n\nmuch of culture’s assumptions about females fed into that\n\nperspective. It was difficult for those of us who studies this\n\ntogether to hear anything but gentleness, love, and grace in Job’s\n\nwife’s words. They’re subversive grace, for sure, not at all\n\nreflecting the most common ways of showing love, but they’re grace\n\nnonetheless.\n\nThe\n\nbook of Job explores human suffering, and asks the big questions\n\nabout how human suffering and God’s will are related. God’s answers\n\nto Job’s questions are in chapters 38-40 if you want to read them\n\nyourselves. The book of Job gives us a space to reflect on suffering\n\nitself, and it gives us words to name the suffering. We don’t have\n\nto be in Job’s particularly awful position to be suffering, there are\n\nmany kinds of suffering in the world.\n\nThis\n\nweek we had a Gathering of (The) Connection where we talked about\n\nfinding peace. We were gifted with wonderful questions: what is\n\npeace? What helps you find peace? What keeps you from peace? We\n\ndiscussed the balance of righteousness anger and peace, and we\n\nwondered about it. As we discussed a thought started to form in me:\n\nI think I’ve been doing it wrong. (Or if not “wrong” than in a\n\nless than optimal way.)\n\nIn\n\nrecent weeks, I have allowed my fears and angers to motivate and lead\n\nme, and I am not at my best when I do that. Certainly there is\n\nplenty worth protesting, there are great organizations to donate to,\n\nand imperative conversations to have. However, if I want to be as\n\nuseful as I can be in building the kin-dom of God, then I need to\n\nstart those actions from the best motivation. Now I’m wondering if I\n\ncan attend to centering myself in the unconditional love of God and\n\nwonder of life and Creation – even now, ESPECIALLY now? Can I\n\nallow myself to slow down enough to consider where my energy belongs\n\nand where my gifts are most useful? Can I show up, wherever I show\n\nup, grace-filled and at peace so that the love I have to share can be\n\npart of what I offer in changing the world? Can I learn how to hold\n\npeace in such a deep way that it allows me to hold anger differently?\n\nPlease\n\nbe aware that I think grace-filled and at peace can be a reasonable\n\nway to protest, chant, and resist!! I’m talking about the inner\n\nmotivation and way of responding to the rest of God’s people. When\n\nit comes down to it, I think that the energy we bring into the world\n\nchanges it more than the words we use. The world is desperately in\n\nneed of love and peace – and listening as well as many many forms\n\nof resistance. Furthermore, in the past few weeks people’s hearts\n\nhaven’t stopped breaking in the normal and awful ways human hearts\n\nbreak. There is still a lot of need around us for patience and\n\ncompassion.\n\nSo,\n\nI’m hoping that in the face of great suffering I might be able (on\n\ngood days) to share subversive grace: to share God’s love from a\n\nplace of peace and gratitude WHILE calling the world out of the\n\ntragic gap and into the kin-dom. This will take times of quiet,\n\nintentional reflection, deep conversation, and attending to hope,\n\ngratitude and goodness. This will take paying attention to what\n\nbrings me energy – and doing those things. This will take a\n\nregular practice of Sabbath, in particular Sabbath from the news\n\ncycle. I got one of those this week and it made all the difference.\n\nFinally,\n\nI hope that my journey is of use to you as well. In the midst of her\n\nown suffering, Job’s wife found the way to hear her husband’s pain\n\nand respond to it with love, grace, and compassion. That’s\n\nespecially hard work right now. But, may God help us to treat\n\nourselves, and those we love, with similar love, grace, and\n\ncompassion. May we find our energy sources, good spiritual\n\npractices, and the freedom to breath outside of the news cycle.\n\nAnd, with God’s help, may it lower our anxiety and fill us with some\n\nmuch needed peace.

Also, for those who have been yearning for a clergy person to acknowledge the harm done by sexual violence who have been harmed by the conversation not happening, I am sorry.\n\nIn the United States, 1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men will experience an attempted or completed rape in their lifetimes. (Most attempts are completed.) To save you the math, 90% of rapes happen to women and 10% happen to men.1 In terms of gender that means we need to remember that women are more likely to be living with the internal scars of sexual assault than men are AND that a substantial number of men are also living with internal scars of sexual assault. We also want to remember that members of the transgender community experience sexual assault at MUCH higher rates than cisgender people. More important than the statistics however, is to remember that one rape is one rape too many.\n\nThis should never happen.\n\nAnd it happens a lot. Many people sexually assault others.\n\nThe story of King David’s daughter, the Princess Tamar, is a story of sexual assault. Unlike most such stories, Tamar’s story is told. Her story reflects and shines light on many stories that never got told, as well as on the experiences of those who told their stories but were not believed. Instead of having been insulated and protected by her royalty, the story of the princess reflects the experiences of many unnamed men and women throughout history.\n\nPhyllis Trible, a matriarch of feminist biblical criticism, has a chapter on Tamar in her book Texts of Terror. She opens the chapter with these words, “From the book of Samuel comes the story of a family enmeshed in royal rape. Brother violates sister. He is a prince to whom belong power, prestige, and unrestrained lust. She is a princess to whom belong wisdom, courage, and unrelieved suffering. Children of one father, they have not the same care of each other. Indeed, the brother cares not at all.”2\n\nThis story comes soon after the one about King David’s adultery, his use of Bathsheba without her consent, and the prophet Nathan calling him on it. David’s shame is very present in the story, including in how he responds to it. Amnon, the lust-filled rapist, is his oldest son and heir. Absalom, Tamar’s full brother, is David’s third son.\n\nThe story SAYS that Amnon “fell in love with” Tamar but I think we can easily conclude that Amnon fell in lust with Tamar. This is not what love looks like. As a virgin daughter of the king, Tamar was highly valuable property, useful to be given away to other countries and brokering deals. That meant that she was “protected property, inaccessible to males, including her brother.”3 Amnon, the princely heir, doesn’t seem to like having anything stand in his way. He finds the person who gives him the advice he wants – that he should manipulate his father into giving him access to Tamar to fulfill his lust.\n\nI must say, Trible points out that when Amnon feigns illness and worries his father, in his request that she be sent to him, Amnon refers to Tamar as his sister. She says, “To claim kinship with Tamar at this time averts suspicion.”4 I say, UGH.\n\nTamar does as she’s told. She doesn’t have many degrees of freedom, and the king had ordered her to go. The servants leave, she prepares the food, she brings it to Amnon, and then he grabs her. He demands that she sleep with him, again calling her his sister. Trible goes on, “Through a series of orders, all of them obeyed, Amnon has manipulated the occasion to feed his lust. This time, however, the royal command meets objection. In the presence of a rapist, Tamar panics not. In fact, she claims her voice. Unlike Amnon’s brisk commands, her deliberations slow the movement of the plot, though they are unable to divert it. If Amnon uses the vocative to seduce her, she returns it to summon him to sense.”5\n\nTamar has an unusually cool head. She didn’t panic nor beg. She spoke in reasonable terms and tried to talk him out of it. She pointed out that their country is above such things, which is a great argument to make in a royal family where the country would be valued especially highly. She points out that it would shame her, seemingly thinking he was capable of empathy. He does not seem to be. She names that it would ruin him, making him appear as a fool and a scoundrel. Finally, seeming to become clear that he wanted what he wanted and wouldn’t stop until he got it, she suggests an alternative. She points out that if he asked to marry her, he’d be allowed to, thus avoiding all the other disastrous consequences. Trible says, “Her words are honest and poignant; they acknowledge female servitude. Tamar knows Amnon can have her but pleads that he do it properly.”6\n\nThat she needs to make such an offer is heart-breaking. However, even the offer to wed the man bent on raping her is ignored. He doesn’t want to hear her speak– he wants to have her subservient and as he fantasized. The text simply says, “but he would not listen to her” and then goes on to say, “and being stronger than she was, he forced her and lay with her.”(13:14) Trible says the text is worse than it first appears in English, “the Hebrew omits the preposition to stress his brutality. ‘He laid her.’”7\n\nAnd then it got worse.\n\nThe violence of the rape transformed the lust into hatred, and he ordered her to “Get out.” However, even in this moment of utter vulnerability and violation, Tamar held her own. Trible says, “This abused woman will no more heed Amnon’s order of dismissal than she consented to his demand for rape.”8 She responds with “NO.” And she stops calling him her brother. Trible continues, “’No,’ she said to him, ‘because sending me away is a greater evil than the other which you have done to me.’ (13:16a) If the narrator interprets that the hatred is greater than the desire, Tamar understands that the expulsion is greater than the rape. In sending her away, Amnon increases the violence he has inflicted on her. He condemns her to a lifelong sentence of desolation. Tamar knows that rape dismissed is crime exacerbated.”9 Again he doesn’t listen. She stops speaking.\n\nNow, this seems to be worth taking a moment to acknowledge that Tamar’s story is not entirely universal and timeless. In her day, if an unmarried woman was raped, it was expected that the man would marry her. That was the least bad option for the woman, since otherwise she was seen as damaged goods which would prevent the possibility of a future marriage and thus the possibility of a financially stable future. Tamar, like other biblical women, was taught that her value was in her capacity to wed and bear male children. This rape AND expulsion violated her body and any hope she had of a future. It was a different time. Today we hope women don’t get stuck marrying their rapists. In any case, she kept her head, her reason, and her voice. But he doesn’t listen.\n\nAfter she is kicked out and the door is barred to keep her from re-entering, she tears her robe. The robe proclaims her a virgin daughter of the King, and she isn’t anymore. Trible says, “tearing her robe symbolizes the violence done to a virgin princess. Rape has torn her.”10 She also puts ashes on her head and weeps publicly. She VISIBLY proclaims that wrong has been done to her. She doesn’t hide it. She doesn’t protect her “brother.” She lets her entire body scream for her, and she makes sure it gets listened to this time.\n\nHer brother, her full brother Absalom, speaks to her. When the words are examined deeply, they are quite powerful. He is his sister’s advocate and he offers her a safe place. In this story Absalom is the one we can look to as a moral compass and seek to emulate. (I actually think Tamar is too high of a standard, being that strong, clear-minded and articulate in the face of that violence is not something to compare ourselves to.) Trible explains, “Absalom explicitly introduces this speech with the adverb ‘attāh, ‘now’ or ‘for the time being.’ As Amnon’s pretense deceived David, so Tamar’s pretense will deceive Amnon. Further, rather than minimizing the crime, euphemisms such as ‘with you’ or ‘this deed’ underscore its horror.”11\n\nAbsalom starts by asking her if Amnon had raped her. He knows it is possible, and he acknowledges it. He also speaks the words, which means she doesn’t have to, in this case another means of grace. He is tender to her, he reminds her that they are still connected, and he comes up with a plan. He takes the harm done to his sister as real, significant, and relevant to him. She is his sister, that hasn’t changed. The text tells us he brought her into his house, since she was no longer a virgin princess living in the palace. He listened, he cared, and he made a space for her.\n\nFrom the moments after the rape on Absalom takes charge. Trible suggests that it is in this moment that he supplants King David himself in the story.12 David is said to be angry – but it is not clear if he is mad at Amnon or at “what happened to Amnon”? Trible says, “David’s anger signifies complete sympathy for Amnon and total disregard for Tamar. How appropriate that the story never refers to David and Tamar as father and daughter.”13 David does nothing, which leaves Absalom alone to respond to the harm done to his sister.\n\nIn the end of the story, Tamar is “desolate.” Trible explains, “When used of people elsewhere in scripture, the verb be desolate (šmm) connotes being destroyed by an animal (Lam. 3:11) Raped, despised, and rejected by a man, Tamar is a woman of sorrows and acquainted with grief.”14 And, in response to Amnon not listening to Tamar, Absalom stops speaking to Amnon as well. (Also, eventually, Absalom kills Amnon and then after that he leads a revolt against his father. David’s failure to respond destabilizes his throne. But this is Tamar’s story and we are going to stick with her.)\n\nHer story, such as it is, is concluded in the following chapter. Trible explains again, starting with the Biblical quote, “’There were born to Absalom three sons and one daughter; her name was Tamar.’ (14:27. RSV). Strikingly the anonymity of the sons highlights the name of the lone female child. In her Absalom has created a living memorial for his sister. A further note enhances the poignancy of his act. Tamar, the daughter of Absalom, ‘became a beautiful woman to behold.’ From aunt to niece have passed name and beauty so that rape and desolation have not the final word in the story of Tamar.”15 Tamar, who would never have a child of her own did have a namesake so that her memory lived on.\n\nOne final thought from Trible about Tamar before we end, “she was never his temptation. His evil was his own lust, and from it others needed protection.”16\n\nDear ones, this story tells a truth we rarely hear, and it forces us to acknowledge the all too common reality of sexual assault. The Bible holds firmly that God abhors sexual violence, and this story adds that silence from leaders in the face of sexual violence only makes it worse. Yet, in the midst of the honest portrayal of horrific violence, the story also leaves us with hope. Absalom was an advocate for his sister and he gave her a safe-place to be. Because of those like Absalom, healing and life are possible, and violence need not have the last word. Absalom is the brother we hope to emulate when we seek to be brothers and sisters in Christ to one another. So, as we are able, may God help us to be safe places for survivors as Absalom was for Tamar.

I think I have it now. The monarchy period lasted for just under 300 years in Israel and just over 400 in Judea, and I found a handy-dandy chart on Wikipedia that helps.\n\nLet’s start with the so-called great King named David (you may have heard of him). His son Solomon became king after him. After the death of Solomon the kingdom divided into two parts: a Northern Part called Israel and a Southern Part called Judea. That is, there was a civil war and the North, which wanted to become a separate nation did so. The Southern succession was SUPER linear, passing directly from father to son with only two exceptions: the one we read about today and the very end of the dynasty. The Northern one is much less linear and way more confusing, and we’re going to ignore most of it today.\n\nThe story we read about today is SOUTHERN, it is about Judea, but to understand it we have to start in the North. There was a Northern/Israelite King named Omri, who had been a general of another King and ended up the victor after a coup. The Bible says he was the worst king yet. His son Ahab married Jezebel. You may have heard of her. She is in the running for being the worst woman in the Bible. Jezebel was a princess of the Phoenician Empire, from which you should take that she was not a follower of YHWH.\n\nKing Ahab was a selfish, petty, and mean man who tended to follow his wife’s lead. She went on an offensive against the prophets of YHWH and tried to kill them all off so the prophets of rival god Baal could be in power.\n\nIf you take nothing else from this introduction, take this: Ahab and Jezebel were rulers who cared only about themselves and power. The Bible calls them unfaithful to YHWH, but I want us to hear that with nuance. The Bible calls leaders unfaithful when they don’t follow the laws of the Torah, and the laws of the Torah were designed to protect the poor and the powerless from the unquenchable thirst for more power and more money of the rich and powerful. Thus, any ruler who cared more for their own power than for the well-being of the people was called unfaithful to YHWH, because being faithful to God MEANT following the rules that cared for the people. Ahab and Jezebel deviated further from God’s vision for a just society than any other rulers before them. Thus they are the standard bearers of evil rulers in Kings and Chronicles. It isn’t just about believing in YHWH or not, it is about being self-serving or caring for the people AS the standard of faith.\n\nAhab and Jezebel, the power couple of epic evilness, had at least a daughter and two sons. Those sons also became Kings of Israel after their father, and the second of them to take the Kingship was Jehoram (of Israel). Their daughter was named Athaliah. She was married to King Jeroham of Judea. Two men, same name; Athaliah had a brother King Jeroham AND a husband King Jeroham. Eventually Queen Athaliah also the mother of the successor King, Ahaziah.\n\nJust before we get to this little story, King Ahaziah, like several Judean kings before him, was leading military campaigns alongside the Northern Israelite King. The two separate countries were pretty well tied in together at this time (including by marriages), and the Bible seems to think that the evil influence of Jezebel was spreading widely. While King Ahaziah of Judea and his uncle King Jehoram of Israel were off fighting to keep control over vassal states, King Jehoram of Israel was injured.\n\nThe great northern prophet Elisha stepped in and anointed the general Jehu as king, to take over for the injured king!! Meanwhile, King Jehoram (of Israel) has gone off to heal in another city and his nephew King Ahaziah (of Judea) comes to visit him. Then the newly minted King Jehu (of Israel) comes and kills them both, and proceeds to go on a killing rampage to ensure that none of Ahab’s 70 other male descendants can take over for him. He also has Jezebel killed, and all the Baal worshippers. I’m telling you, they don’t make soap operas as violent as Biblical history for a reason.\n\nNow, the deceased Jezebel and Ahab have one remaining child in power, their daughter Athaliah who has been Queen Mother to her son Ahaziah. Their male decedents in the north and all of their allies have been murdered. In the grand tradition of seeking power at any cost, the Queen Mother Athaliah has all of the other male royal descendants killed off and claims the throne for herself. This action would have completely eliminated the rest of Ahab and Jezebel’s line as well as the Southern succession. It is unclear if this mass murder involved any of her other sons (there may not have been any), but it certainly includes HER OWN GRANDCHILDREN, the princes of the kingdom.\n\nNow, originally my goal was to discuss the subversiveness of Jehosheba, a daughter of King Jehoham and sister of King Ahaziah, but at this point I’m having trouble with clarity over which woman is more subversive: is it the woman who claims the throne for herself for seven years and is the ONLY break in the Davidic dynasty in 438 years OR the woman who subversively hid her nephew away so he could restore the dynasty?? This leads me to wonder how much are we supposed to care about the dynasty, which I really think is propaganda more than it was God’s will? In their own ways, both of these women were exceptionally subversive, although one seems significantly more evil than the other. While I admit that subversiveness can come in good or evil forms, we are going to keep our attention on the defiant aunt.\n\nBefore I started the research for this sermon series, this little story was not one I’d noticed before. It does show up twice, 3 verses each in the standard history of Kings and nearly the same verses in the alternative history of Chronicles. They tell us that there was a ruling queen of Judea, and she was the only one to sit on the throne who was not a descendant of David! She was taken down by the subversive action of another woman, one who was either her daughter or her step-daughter. The historian Josephus claims that Jehosheba was a HALF sister to King Ahaziah which means she wasn’t Athaliah’s daughter, but the text seems to imply the opposite. Generally in these stories a woman is only called a sister that clearly if she is a full blooded sister. It doesn’t really matter, but it is curious.\n\nThe Bible struggles with Queen Athaliah’s rule MOSTLY because she was not a descendant of David, and it seems to call her reign illegitimate. The New Interpreter’s Bible puts it this way, “Although Athaliah rules for seven years, the typical regal summaries are omitted in the report, for the narrator does not consider her to have been a legitimate ruler.”1Apparently, questions of the legitimacy of rulers is not new in human history. Similarly, we can tell from this entire narrative that people in power using their power to do harm to the vulnerable is a long standing tradition and that the prophetic voice exists for the sake of calling power to accountability.\n\nAnyway, to get back to the story, this sister Jehosheba of the newly dead King Ahaziah is ALSO married to the High Priest (which is sketchy in its own right, the power is clearly shared very tightly in that society). She hides her baby nephew and his wet-nurse away in a unused room in the palace to keep him from being murdered. Later she sneaks them both out of the palace and hides them in the Temple for SIX YEARS. For all of those years, his grandmother ruled the southern kingdom of Judea under the assumption that there was no one left with a more legitimate claim to power than the one she had.\n\nNow, its hard to tell from story itself who the mastermind was: Jehosheba or her husband the high priest (we’re going to skip over his name so that no one gets more confused and just call him the high priest). They seem DEEPLY in cahoots. Jehosheba is the one who is said to have stolen away the prince and hidden him for years, but at the end of that time it is her husband who enacts a plan to overthrow Queen Athaliah’s rule by convincing the military that the rightful son of King Ahaziah still lived and should be king instead. Perhaps it was the high priest that asked his wife to protect the baby to begin with. Perhaps it was the Jehosheba who convinced her husband to overthrow the Queen for the sake of her nephew. Perhaps they had a really great relationship and shared in both the planning and the execution of the plan. The text doesn’t tell us. But within the royal family, a princess who was married to the high priest risked her own life and that of her husband and family as well for the sake of overthrowing the Queen.\n\nThe Biblical narrative claims that the baby nephew who became King, Joash, was a good king. It seems that his high priest uncle kept in line for as long as the high priest lived, and he even oversaw a restoration of the Temple. He had a 40 year reign of following the ways of YHWH, although in the end he decided to use the Temple’s treasury to pay off a foreign king who wanted to sack Jerusalem and his servants killed him off in response. You can’t make this stuff up. I do not find it clear to what degree Joash really was in charge and to what degree his uncle (and aunt?) pulled the strings after having saved his life, but the gist seems to be that Jehosheba did a good thing for the people of Judea and for the worship of YHWH by saving that baby. Of course, she maintained the royal lineage, but she also helped provide a ruler who cared for the people.\n\nThe real question, of course, is what we can draw from these ancient stories of long dead battles for seats of power that matters to us today? Of course there is the timely reminder that the Biblical standard for good leadership is the care given to the people, with particular attention to the poor, the powerless, and the marginalized. I think there is also in Jehosheba’s story the reality that standing up to power can require great personal risk.\n\nThe book “Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed” by Phillip Hallie tells the story of a little village in France, Le Chambon, full of Huguenots who truly believed in the Biblical call to take care of all of God’s children. Those French Protestants were responsible for saving the lives of thousand of Jewish children (and adults) during the German occupation of France. They did so while taking their own lives at risk, and indeed pastor’s son was killed for being part of the resistance. The faith of the people propelled them to take care of all God’s people.\n\nThe acts of Jehosheba, like the acts of the people of Le Chambon, were extraordinarily courageous because the power structures above them were willing to kill people in order to maintain their power. To be in the resistance sometimes requires acts of great courage and personal risk.

Von Rad says it well when he says, “To understand Tamar’s act, the reader must resist comparing it with modern conditions and judging it accordingly, for the modern world has nothing that can be compared to it.”1 There is so much necessary context required to understand the story that it may seem like isn’t worth it, but I promise you that understanding what she was up against is necessary to show how hardcore Tamar was.\n\nThe first thing to understand about this story is levirate marriage. This was a custom practiced in many ancient societies with strong clan structure and significant inheritance laws. It worked like this: if a married man died before producing an heir, his brother was responsible for producing an heir on his behalf. In the ancient Near East it was normal for the eldest son to inherit a double portion of his father’s estate. Thus, if an eldest brother died, his younger brother would be producing the heir who would get the double portion INSTEAD of him. You may remember that Jesus was questioned about a widow who had been married to a series of brothers, in an attempt to stump Jesus.\n\nThe second thing to understand is widowhood culture. The practice would have been that a widow would return to her father’s house, and thereby be eligible for remarriage. Only a widow would return to her father’s house. A woman who has a levirate marriage or who was waiting to have a levirate marriage was not ENTIRELY a widow and remained a part of the family of her deceased husband. The question is: to whom does the widow belong? To her father’s family or to her in-laws? As long as there was someone available to produce that heir she belonged to her in-laws. To send her home to her father’s house was to imply otherwise.\n\nThe third important thing to know is that there is a significant debate about what sort of prostitution is being referenced in this text. Some commentators suggest that Tamar was acting as a sacred prostitute, within expected behavioral boundaries of her people. (She was a Canaanite.) This is because there are two words for prostitute used in the text, one used in reference to Tamar’s actual story and another – the more common word – used in the accusation against her. Von Rad explains it this way:\n\nIn the ancient Orient, it was customary in many places for married women to give themselves to strangers because of some oath. Such sacrifices of chastity in the service of the goddess of love, Astarte, were, of course, different form ordinary prostitution even though they were were repulsive to Israel. They were strictly forbidden by law, and the teachers of wisdom warned urgently against this immoral custom, which was apparently at times fashionable even in Israel. At the borders between Israel and Canaan, where our whole story takes place, the appearance on the road of a ‘devoted one’ was obviously nothing surprising. Tamar does not pretend to be a harlot as we think of it but rather a married woman who indulges in this practice, and Judah too thought of her in this way. It is characteristic that our narrative in vs. 21 and 22 also uses the expression ‘devoted one’ which recalls the sacred meaning of this practice.”2\n\nIn contrast, J. Maxwell Miler in the New Interpreter’s Bible, says, “Although her dress and action could imply prostitution (the veil both invites and conceals), the narrator does not mention it. Judah so interprets the veil and propositions her (vv. 15-16). In v. 21, his friend speaks of her as a ‘temple prostitute,’ probably only more discreet language for a prostitute (with no official cultic reference.)”3 In either case, Judah was very comfortable paying a woman to have sex with him and very uncomfortable with a woman he controlled having sex for money! Or as Miller puts it, “When Judah saw her as a prostitute, he used her; when he sees her in this capacity as his daughter-in-law, he condemns her. Clearly Judah applies a double standard.”4 Furthermore, the death he condemns her to is particularly harsh. As Von Rad says, “The punishment itself is certainly, in the narrator’s opinion, the severest possible. The later law recognized burning only in an extreme case of prostitution (Lev. 21.9). The custom was death by stoning for such offenses (Deut 22.23 ff; Lev. 20.16).”5 This likely relates to honor culture, and to have a woman in his family prostituting herself decreased his honor, while using a prostitute did not.\n\nThe issue is that by sending her back to her father’s house, he had functionally disowned her. Yet, the people brought her pregnancy to him as if he was still the person who owned her, and he had no issue judging her, as if he still owned her. Von Rad explains, “If one examines the legal aspect of the case, its difficulty becomes apparent. On the basis of what fact was the complaint made? Because of a widow’s prostitution or that of an engaged girl? Those who turn to Judah in this matter seem to assume the latter. Judah assumes competence as judge; he thus reckons Tamar as part of his family, though Tamar’s act proceeded from the assumption that Judah had released her permanently from the family and gave no further considerations to a marriage with his third son.”6\n\nFinally, we need to remember that women had no legal standing in that time and place. As Walter Brueggemann pus it, “a striking contrast is established between this man who has standing and status in the community and this woman who stands outside the law and is without legal recourse.”7Tamar was being treated as if she was a widow by being sent back to her father, but also as if she was engaged to Shelah. She was in legal limbo and had no way to get out of it. Judah, by telling her it was a temporary solution was both dishonest with her and kept her from having any sort of life in the future. Von Rad says, “Judah’s wrong lay in considering this solution as really final for himself but in presenting to Tamar as an interim solution.”8\n\nSo, now that we have all the context down, I’m guessing we’ve all forgotten the actual story, right? Judah has gone off away from his brothers to live among the Canaanites. He marries a Canaanite woman, has three sons, and he finds a wife, Tamar, for the eldest son whose name is Er. Er dies, and Judah seems generally afraid of women and is a bit afraid Er died because Tamar was… scary or something. The story seems to believe God killed Er for being bad. Then Er’s younger brother Onan WAS bad. As Miller puts it, “Onan sabotages the intent of the relationship in order to gain Er’s inheritance for himself upon Judah’s death – the firstborn would receive a doubleshare. He regularly uses Tamar for sex, but makes sure she does not become pregnant by not letting his semen enter her (coitus interruptus, not masturbation). He therefore formally fulfills his duty, lest the role be passed on to his other brother and he lose Er’s inheritance in this way. This willful deception would be observable to Tamar, but God’s observation leads to Onan’s death (again, by unspecified means).”9 Tamar knew what was happening the whole time but no one cared, and she had no legal standing. As is true in Genesis, when a man sexually mistreats a woman, God does harm to the man. So Onan dies.\n\nJudah is now completely freaked out that Tamar is powerful and killing off his sons. So he tells her that he wants her to go home to her father’s house to wait for his youngest son, Shelah, to grow up but he is lying! He intends for her to die in limbo as a widow/engaged woman who no one else can touch, while not taking care of her and not letting anyone else be responsible for her either. Years later, after Judah’s wife has died, Tamar becomes certain that Judah never intended to do right by her.\n\nSo she dresses herself in a way that suggests she’s available, which includes a veil so he doesn’t know who she is, and her father-in-law propositions her. She says yes, sleeps with him, gains two identifying possessions, and then he leaves. She takes her veil back off and reclaim the role of widow, so that when Judah sends her the agreed upon goat, she can’t be found. Thus she keeps the identifiers. She is eventually found to be pregnant and Judah is told. He judges her harshly and decrees she should be burned to death – for adultery, that is for being unfaithful to his son Shelah who he never intended to let marry her anyway. AS SHE WAS BEING BROUGHT OUT she sent word to Judah saying “the guy who owns these is the father” and with them sends his identifying possessions.\n\nThen, suddenly, Judah sees the light, admits all his wrong doings, takes back the condemnation, takes care of her again, AND doesn’t sleep with her again. Actually, I don’t entirely believe that last part. Since the text doesn’t say whose wife she becomes, and since she had children by him, I suspect he did keep sleeping with her and the text itself protests too much – but who knows?\n\nMore to the point, Tamar existed in a time when she was seen as possession more than as person. She existed in between cultures, neither of which respected her, and she had no legal voice with which to articulate her concerns. We know nothing about her relationship to Er, but we know that both Onan and Judah used her to fulfill their own ends. She was left in limbo, unable to find a life that would support her over the long run, and she was lied to about it. She came up with a plan to inverse her circumstances, and it was radical, revolutionary, risky, and difficult. I doubt she particularly wanted to sleep with Judah, but she used her sexuality and his openness to fulfilling his sexual needs to get what she needed. Tamar is one of the most hardcore human beings I’ve heard about. Ever.\n\nTamar refused to be ignored, denied, pretended away. She refused a life that would be most likely to end with her homeless and starving. She refused a life without the opportunity to mother (which she would have been told was her her reason for existing). She outsmarted the man who had all the power over her, and he acknowledged her righteousness in the end – EVEN though many would still prefer to condemn her.\n\nThe thing is, I suspect Tamar was not the only woman around who was stuck in legal limbo. She is, however, the only woman whose story is being told because she found her way out. She was the extraordinary one who overcame overwhelming circumstances. She was the exception. Her courage and intelligence worked for her when she existed in a system that was designed to see her as property rather than as a human. Tamar blew up the rules in order to get a chance at her life. And she gets acknowledged for it throughout history.\n\nThe children that Tamar would bear would be ancestors of King David and as such ancestors of Jesus. She is one of three women listed in Matthews genealogy of Jesus. Interestingly Judah (and not Er) is listed as the father in that genealogy.\n\nWe have a story of an exceptional human here, one who beat a multitude of odds. Yet I think the value of the story is that it points out to us just how broken that system was. It didn’t take care of all the people and it took an exceptional person breaking all the rules to navigate it. I think if we are to learn anything from the courage of Tamar and from her choice to claim her life it is this: may we fight with people who are as stuck as Tamar was so that no one is required to be the exceptional hero in order to claim a life worth living. That is, may there be fewer people who need to go to such extremes, because people in desperation have allies like us. Amen\n\nSermon Talkback\n\nWhat other stories can you think of: exceptional humans overcoming overwhelming odds that no one should ever have to face?\n\nWhy do you think Tamar is included in the genealogical list for Jesus?\n\nAnd why with Judah as father, not Er?\n\nThis story doesn’t fit in at all. It is essentially stand alone. Why do you think it kept getting told?\n\nWas Tamar more in the right? Why?\n\nWhere are we successful in being allies to those in extenuating circumstances?\n\nWhere are not successful?\n\nWhat do you think motivated Tamar?\n\nGod isn’t spoken of much in this story, moreso God is implied. This is an OLD story. Within its constructs, God who is quite active in killing off the immoral lets Tamar’s actions stand. What does that mean???\n\n—-\n\n1Gerhard Von Rad, Genesis: a commentary in The Old Testament Library series (The Westminster Press: Philadelphia, 1972) 359.\n\n2Von Rad, 359-360.\n\n3J.

He passed away late on a Saturday morning, which meant I heard about it around nightfall. With the help of friends and housemates I figured out what to eat for dinner (seriously, this involved asking a friend what I liked to eat, I was beyond knowing), found a chapel to pray in (a housemate walked with me, seemingly I wasn’t trustworthy to walk a few blocks by myself), and got a plane ticket home (a friend found it for me). By the end of the night things were set: I was scheduled to leave early the next morning a bus to Heathrow airport and would get to Newark by that evening.\n\nIn those frugal college days I didn’t keep much cash on hand, and even by those standards I happened to be running low on pounds. I had dollars, but I didn’t have have pounds. For reasons that now escape me, I exchanged currency was in the back of a department store, and I certainly wasn’t thinking about the need for cash the night my grandfather died. I didn’t realize I needed money that night, and even if I had, by the time I could have pulled myself together enough to notice – the store would have been closed.\n\nBy morning I realized my error, but it was Sunday, and EARLY morning, and there was no way to solve it. (In retrospect I could easily have asked my housemates, but my deeply independent nature didn’t come up with that idea!) I got to the bus on time, with a plan. I had enough money in American dollars to pay TWICE the bus fare. I figured that would work.\n\nIt didn’t.\n\nThe bus driver was sympathetic, but unable to let me on the bus without paying the fare – in pounds. I had no pounds. I had no way to get pounds. And I had to get on THAT bus to make my flight home. Getting home to my family felt like a need. The grief for my grandfather was deep seated, and raw.\n\nI don’t remember how it happened exactly, someone must have overheard my offer of paying twice the fare and why I had to get home, but the people on that bus paid my fare for me. Many people offered one pound each and then it was paid and I was on my way home. My independent nature was so embarrassed by that at the time that I blocked the story for years and it has only recently re-emerged.\n\nNow, with a bit more perspective, I’m less ashamed that I wasn’t able to do everything perfectly without notice and in the midst of grief. Now, with the wisdom of another decade and a half I’m not embarrassed to have needed help anymore. Instead I am grateful for the gifts of strangers when I needed it most\n\nI am so grateful for the chance to read Shirley Readdean’s excellent sermon from last week, and she motivated me to be playful with the text as well. The story of the magi was told to make sense of the world and of Jesus, it is intentionally metaphorical and rich in meaning, making easy space for us to explore our own lives within it.\n\nIt struck me this week that accepting gifts from strangers isn’t particularly easy – at least it hasn’t been for me. I’m told Simone Weil once said, “It is only by the grace of God that the poor can forgive the rich for the bread they give them,” which has to do with both the challenge or receiving gifts AND the issues of income inequality. This story of Matthew’s gets into all of that!\n\nWhat would this experience have been like for Mary and Joseph? They were relatively young, or at least she was and he might have been! Mary certainly hadn’t known much of the world, and there is no reason to think Joseph had either. They were likely quiet provincial. By the best guesses of scholars they were poor. If Joseph made his living as a carpenter that would mean that there was no longer access to the family lands – they’d been lost to debt. Peasants living without land were worse off than those still living on it. Likely they worked very, very hard and had little time to travel. If they were from Nazareth (which seems more likely than anything else), then they knew about the Roman destruction of Sepphoris 4 miles away and about 8 years earlier. They knew oppression, poverty, and hard living. They also knew a deep faith in a God who cared about the people, and who did not want them dying of complications of poverty. I suspect it was their Jewish faith that helped them get through the day, every day. I suspect it was much easier to trust fellow Jewish residents of Nazareth than it was to trust outsiders or non-Jews, the world had taught them to be wary.\n\nOr, if we want to take Matthew’s story at face value and put the Holy Family in residence in Bethlehem, then they were in a small village 6 miles from Jerusalem. There, too, they would learn to be cautious of outsiders, particularly the Roman Empire and their regional authorities: the religious leaders of the day. Mary and Joseph would have found it much easier to trust the Jews in their own village than outsiders, the Temple priests, or non Jews.\n\nWherever they originated from, as Jewish peasants Mary and Joseph would have had good reason to be hesitant about outsiders and non-Jews. Furthermore, the primarily stories of the faith included the stories of exile and return – that is, of domination from Eastern empires and their strange gods. The gospel of Matthew tells us that the the magi were from the East, and that they stopped in Jerusalem on their way to Bethlehem. That would be reminiscent of the eastern empires that had previously dominated the Jews AND a connection to the empire that currently dominated them. These magi had the power to gain an audience with King Herod, who was known to be crazy and cruel. Can you see what I’m getting at? It is possible that the magi would have been terrifying to Mary and Joseph, and for good reason. Then, to add to all the complications of their existence, these strange and powerful strangers came into their home bearing VERY expensive gifts.\n\nHow would Mary and Joseph felt? Would they have been afraid? Were they overwhelmed? If so, what bothered them the most? The non-Jewishness? The connection with their history of exile? The connection the Magi had to the power-players of the Roman Empire? The power they themselves had? The foreign language? The expensive gifts? The expectations placed on their baby son? Or was it simply the danger the strangers brought with them by declaring Jesus to be a threat to Herod’s power? Whichever of these bothered them MOST, I’m thinking that if I was in their sandals, I might not want those magi around very much.\n\nThe magi are VERY different, VERY powerful, and thus VERY dangerous. They don’t know Jewish traditions or laws, and they are connected to the power structure of oppression. Furthermore, in basic human nature, it is especially uncomfortable to receive gifts that can never be repaid. Jewish peasants would never EVER be able to repay the gifts of the kind that the magi bought, Jewish peasants were living just BELOW subsistence level and gold, and frankincense and myrrh are EXPENSIVE. In fact, those are the kinds of gifts that aren’t given in normal human exchange – they are the kind of gifts only given to people in power (like kings) in hope of recognizing the king and winning favor. The gifts of the magi communicate that Jesus was perceived as a king, of a standard order human kingdom. Likely that’s one of the reasons the story is told, to prefigure Jesus’ kingship. However in real life, that would be AWKWARD.\n\nThe presence of the magi in the story Matthew tells helps develop the story in other ways too: it gives a reason for King Herod to know of the threat of Jesus, thereby making the journey to Egypt seem more plausible (really it exists in order to present Jesus as the new Moses); it indicates that the life of Jesus would be significant beyond the realm of Judaism; and it foreshadows the ways that the adult Jesus would threaten the power of Rome and the authority of its appointed leaders. The magi themselves, coming from East to Jerusalem, fulfill dreams dating back to the exile, as we can see in Isaiah. That dream is not just of a restoration, but of restored power to the Jewish people and international recognition. The coming of the magi in Matthew is meant to indicate that Jesus is bringing the fulfillment of the desires of centuries. Even so I still think the men themselves would be terrifying to actual Jewish peasants.\n\nOn top of it all, I still wonder what it would have been like to such receive gifts from strange and powerful men. It can be hard to receive gifts anyway, they require a certain openness and vulnerability. It is harder when the gift is one-sided and cannot be reciprocated. I think, at least for me, it is also difficult to receive gifts from strangers. I take this from the fact it has taken me nearly 15 years to tell the story I started with! Furthermore, the acts of giving and receiving a gift is a connection between people, and would be hard to build a connection with people who are frightening, strange, and powerful. Finally, and this I’ve been worried about since childhood, if these expensive gifts were given to the Holy Family before a significant journey HOW ON EARTH would they keep them safe without a caravan to protect them?\n\nThe story doesn’t go into these details at all. It just says the magi offered Jesus the gifts and then left by another road, thereby short-changing Herod. Metaphorically this suggests that being present to Jesus would change how people used their power in the world and who they trusted. That suggests that the giving of the magi’s gifts to Jesus was helpful to the magi! That’s easy enough to believe – it is a wonderful and transformational thing to be able to give a generous gift. (This may be why they’re hard to receive!)\n\nIt is with humble gratitude that I think of the people who paid for my bus fare, people whose names I didn’t know and who I have thus been unable to pay back. They have left me with gratitude for the opportunities I have to help others along the way, and gave me a more clear sense that we as humans are all in this together. That moment in time was one when I truly didn’t have what I needed, and others provided it. I am thankful to have known that need, and even more thankful to have had it cared for.\n\nThe graciousness of Mary and Joseph who let strange and powerful foreigners into their home to greet their baby and give expensive gifts is mesmerizing, even after hearing it every year. Those strange men whose very lives seem designed to frighten were actually intending to extend grace. They were the ones most changed by the experience. Part of the grace of receiving gifts is allowing the gift-giver to be transformed. Thus, may we find the grace to be open to the gifts that strangers have to offer, and receive them with openness and gratitude! Amen\n\n–\n\nRev. Sara E.

Through the\n\naccounts of Jesus’ birth in Matthew and Luke, Mary is one of the\n\nfirst biblical characters many children encounter. Along with Eve,\n\nMary is integral to shaping how Christians understand the nature of\n\nwomanhood and motherhood.”1\n\nWhat is said is true. Mary, along with Eve, has both shaped how\n\nwomen are understood in Christianity AND the inverse: perceptions of\n\nMary (and Eve) are indicators of how Christianity is understanding\n\nwomen. How Mary is seen is a bell-weather for how women are seen.\n\nCary Gibson, the author of the opening quote, also says, “Mary is a\n\ncontainer into which we pour ideas of what it means to be a woman. In\n\nturn we then draw from her image ideas about our own womanhood.”2\n\nMost\n\ncommonly, Mary is said to be meek and mild. Usually, it is her\n\nsubservience that sets her up as the ideal woman. The pedestal of\n\nwomanhood that Mary most frequently occupies as the ideal woman is\n\nthe pedestal of the selfless mother, the one who exists simply so her\n\nson can exist. She’s faithful, sweet, and biddable. There is,\n\nhowever, one issue with this common perception Mary: it completely\n\nignores the words of Mary found in the Gospel of Luke.\n\nNow,\n\nI’m not saying that I really think some literate scribe was following\n\nMary around during her pregnancy to record her insights for\n\nposterity. However, I am saying we have a rather long monologue\n\nattributed to Mary that defies the way she is most commonly defined.\n\nThe meek and mild ideal does not match the actual Gospel. The myths\n\naround her are more about what Christian women have been told to be\n\nthan they are about the actual stories about and words of Mary.\n\nTherefore,\n\nit seems worth exploring the words attributed to Mary. Whether the\n\nwords are what Mary said, or something Mary could have said, or\n\nsimply what it made sense to someone that the Mother of Jesus WOULD\n\nhave said, they are attributed to her. Since the general perception\n\nof Mary is based on 20 centenaries of trying to put women in their\n\nplace, and I’d prefer to get to know Mary as presented in the Gospel.\n\nIt may be that we can take a look at Mary-the-ideal-woman and get a\n\ndifferent answer about what it means to be an ideal woman.\n\nFor\n\nstarters, these words are not meek, nor mild. In fact, Cary Gibson\n\nsays Mary, “voiced a defiant and righteous hope in the face of\n\nviolence and injustice.”3\n\nIt is true. These words express a HARDCORE faith and a great ideal\n\nfor women to seek to live up to. 🙂 Men too. This is the sort of\n\nfaith we can all aspire to!\n\nFirst\n\nof all, Mary’s song is deeply rooted in her faith tradition. It\n\nechoes Hannah’s song of celebration after Hannah fulfilled her\n\npromise and brought her son Samuel to Eli to serve him as a priest.\n\nIt also echoes with phrases from the Psalms. The version of this\n\nsong that we have is a work of theological and scriptural brilliance\n\nand sophistication. Hannah’s song is powerful, but reflects a less\n\nmature faith. Hannah yearns for God to smash the powerful, deride\n\nher enemies, and break the mighty. In her mind the powerless are\n\nlifted up BY making the powerful small. There is violence in her\n\nimagery, even as there is celebration of the goodness of God and of\n\nher sense of becoming more significant in the world.\n\nMary’s\n\nsong, though, is not vengeful. She also speaks of lifting up the\n\npoor and lonely. Like Hannah she speaks about God’s power, but she\n\nalso adds God’s mercy. Mary speaks of lowering the mighty, but the\n\nlowering isn’t violent or dangerous for them: the proud are\n\n“scattered in the thoughts of their hearts” which sounds like a\n\nway to be more humble; the powerful step down from their thrones (but\n\nshe doesn’t suggest they’re harmed afterward); the rich are sent away\n\nempty – as if they don’t need any more. Hannah had the the\n\nformerly “full” “hire themselves out for bread.” Mary is\n\ninterested in lifting up the lowly and removing their oppression, not\n\nin oppressing the oppressors. She is a actually meeker and milder\n\nthan Hannah, Hannah’s is pretty rough. Mary is simply less violent!\n\nHannah\n\nspeaks of her victory, Mary speaks of being treated with God’s favor.\n\nWhile both are grateful for the child they are able to nurture, and\n\nwhile both express incredible gratitude to God and deep theological\n\nreflections, they have different energies. The insertion of material\n\nfrom the Psalms into Hannah’s original poem changes it into a more\n\ngracious piece. One scholar found that in addition to the source\n\nmaterial of Hannah’s poem, the song of Mary includes 7 pieces of\n\ndifferent Psalms, as well as a quote each from Deuteronomy, Job,\n\nMicah, and Isaiah. By that scholar’s reckoning all of the words of\n\nMary’s song are attributable to Hebrew Bible quotations.4\n\nMary’s\n\nsong starts in the specific. She is grateful to be useful to God,\n\nhumbly aware of her status as a poor woman in her society, and\n\nattentive to the change of her status because of God’s favor. She\n\nattributes her life change to God’s greatness, and she praises God.\n\nShe expresses who God is: merciful,\n\nconsistent, strong, and powerful. She talks about a God who cares\n\nabout the lowly,\n\nand feeds the hungry with GOOD food.\n\nHer song makes another journey outward, celebrating God’s care for\n\nall of the Jews and then attributing God’s care to God’s merciful\n\nnature and God’s promises. She moves from celebrating God’s work for\n\nher, to celebrating God’s work for the vulnerable, to celebrating\n\nGod’s work for all her people. It is as if she is expanding her\n\ngratitude in increasingly wide circles.\n\nWhile\n\nit is unlikely to be factual, this text suggests that Mary knew her\n\nscriptures well enough to combine them creatively into a truly\n\nbeautiful and majestic song celebrating God WITHOUT demeaning anyone\n\nelse. It suggests that her humility was real, but it wasn’t a form\n\nof self-deprecation. It says she was genuinely honored to be able to\n\nserve God and be useful in forming the world in God’s kindom of\n\nshalom. She was delighted and amazed to be chosen. She recognized\n\nthe depth of the blessing she received, seemingly without thinking\n\nthat it made her more important than others. She said she was\n\nblessed, and was amazed that people would remember her as blessed.\n\nThat indicates she didn’t think she’d done anything right or worthy,\n\nit was God’s choice not her worthiness that mattered. Her gratitude\n\nwas expansive and celebratory and still focused on lifting up the\n\nlowly and attentive to the hungry. She kept her head!\n\nThe\n\nMary of this song is wise, strong, compassionate, creative, humble,\n\nand grateful. She knows and celebrates a God who is a fierce\n\nadvocate of justice. John Dominic Crossan and Marcus Borg, in their\n\nbook “The First Christmas” point out that each of the Gospels\n\nstart with a “Gospel in miniature” (with the possible exception\n\nof Mark which starts at a gallop and just keeps going!). Luke 1 and\n\n2, which likely do NOT represent authentic memories of things that\n\nreally happened, DO represent themes of the Gospel, understanding of\n\nJesus, foreshadowing of things to come, and ways to see how God is\n\nknown in the Gospel. Luke pays particular attention to women – as\n\nwe can see here where Mary gets a prolonged monologue – as well as\n\nto the poor and vulnerable. We can also see that here in the words\n\nMary speaks. The writer of Luke, and/or the Christian tradition,\n\nand/or the editors who came later attribute these words to Mary\n\nlargely to help those of us who came later to understand her son.\n\nNow,\n\nI don’t want anyone to think that I’m disparaging Hannah’s song. Her\n\nsong is FIERCE and profound, and reflects an era one whole millennia\n\nbefore Mary’s. Hannah, as well, sought justice. She sought it for\n\nherself and she sought it for all of God’s people. She understood God\n\nto be one who cares about the poor, the hungry, the feeble, the\n\nbarren, the low, and the needy. That is a reflection of the unique\n\ntradition of Judaism, from a pretty early time. Other ancient\n\npeoples believed in god and goddesses. The Israelites were unique,\n\nhowever, in believing in a God who cared about how they treated each\n\nother, and in a God who cared about the people who had the least\n\npower and influence. There is a constant tension in the Bible\n\nbetween this belief – in a God who cares for the poor and lowly –\n\nand the human tendency to prefer the rich and powerful. Hannah\n\nreflects the God who cares for the poor and lowly without being\n\npulled toward the rich and powerful at all. Then Mary manages to\n\ntake it a step further and acknowledge a God who cares for everyone.\n\nThey sought justice, and believed in a God who wanted justice. This\n\nis our radical tradition. This is the wonder of worshiping a God of\n\ncompassion.\n\nThose\n\nsons of those women took their justice-seeking natures and their\n\nunderstandings of the God of Compassion, and changed the world. We\n\nmostly know about the mothers because of the sons. Samuel anointed\n\nkings. Jesus healed the sick, fed the hungry, ate with sinners, and\n\ntold parables that still confound us today. Both sons changed the\n\nworld. Both mothers are presented as sources of wisdom for their\n\nsons. Their stories are preludes to their sons stories, and yet I am\n\nso grateful that the Bible gives them voices and songs and stories!\n\nThey are not ONLY vessels through which their sons come to be, they\n\nare interesting in their own right.\n\nI\n\ndo wish for all of us to be able to be a bit like these justice\n\nseeking mothers. And if we are going to hold up Mary as the ideal,\n\nthen I hope it takes the form of being moved to sing our gratitude\n\nto God and celebrating the wonder of God’s good work in the world. I\n\nhope we can become so steeped in our faith tradition that we can use\n\nit in creative ways that bring more caring, compassion, and justice\n\nto our tradition. I hope that we can see and name the goodness of\n\nour lives without taking ourselves too seriously. And I do hope that\n\nwhen push comes to shove we are more like Mary than like Hannah, and\n\nthat we can hope for the transformation of oppressors – not the\n\noppression of them. I hope we too can always remember the people of\n\nGod who are struggling the most, and find ways to help lift them up.\n\nI hope we can be part of our tradition that remembers God as a God of\n\ncompassion for the least, the last, the lost and the lonely.\n\nIf\n\nMary is the ideal, and she seems to be well set up to be the ideal,\n\nthen let’s seek to be like her: fierce, grateful, and brilliant.\n\nAmen\n\n1\n\nCary Gibson, “Mary, Jesus’ Mother” in an email from The Common\n\nEnglish Bible send by Abingdon Press on December 2nd,\n\n2016.\n\n2Ibid.\n\n3Ibid.\n\n4Joseph\n\nA.

In this story she expresses exemplary faith and devotion for God. She a common example used for the idea of “taking it to the Lord in prayer.” All in all, she feels like enough of a goody-two shoes to be the mother of the king-maker. As we see time and time again, when you hear a birth stories, you know that you are getting the story of someone important. When you hear about a barren woman in the Bible (much less a virgin 😉 ) you know you are hearing the beginning of the story of someone VERY important. The baby born to THIS barren woman will be the last of the judges, one of the great prophets, and the one to anoint kings Saul and David. This story seems designed to prove that he came from good stock.\n\nTo be honest, the Young Adult Bible study found her a little bit boring. Hannah is presented as a weeping mess, having internalizing the cultural narrative that her value was based on her ability to produce sons. She is one of two wives of reasonably wealthy man. (No poor man could afford two wives.) Their family goes to the holy place to worship once a year – not three like the really faithful families – but also not less than once. They’re moderately faithful Jews. She has a loving husband, which in and of itself makes her unusual in the Bible. She believes that God is in control of the world, and she seems to believe that a blessing by God’s priest will help her get what she wants. She makes a vow with very serious consequences: she wants a child so badly that she offers the child to God. (This is, of course, a promise she makes good on. She brings Samuel to Eli as soon as he is weaned and then sees him only once a year when she brings him new clothing.) She is a bit of a naive heroine: good, sweet, doing what she’s supposed to do, and sad because her society says she is worthless.\n\nDespite the Young Adult Bible Study, there are a lot of interesting things going on in this story. They’re just hiding rather well! Are there any people in this room who immediately zone out when you hear genealogies – you know, like the one in the very first verse of this story? Me too. However, this one has a point! Hannah’s husband was of the clan Ephraim (one of Joseph’s sons). That is a Northern Tribe, which fits as this is a northern story set in the north. He was of that clan, as were the 5 generations before him. Which means he was NOT AT ALL a Levite. And the Levites were supposed to be the priests and holy men. The baby who will be born will be raised as if he is a priest, but he isn’t one. He is an insert into the holy man tradition. This is particularly relevant because Eli (a Levite) has sons who are corrupt priests, but the clan of Ephraim raises up a good priest. Things aren’t going as they should be. The system is broken.\n\nLike the genealogy, the location has some hidden interest. The story is set in the Temple in Shiloh. Which would be a pretty boring detail except for one piece of historical knowledge: there is no Temple in Shiloh. Shiloh was a worship center, and there would have been official priests working there, but there was no Temple. The Temple would be build by David, who Samuel would make King – and it would be in the Southern Kingdom. This story has the fingerprints of later Southern editors on it, ones who couldn’t quite comprehend a worship space other than the Temple.\n\nNow I mentioned that Hannah was a beloved spouse, which was a bit unique. The expressions of adoration from her husband are totally unique. He asks her why he isn’t worth 10 sons to her – which seems to imply that she’s worth 10 sons to him! Furthermore, he gives her the “double portion” to use in sacrifice. That’s odd. The double portion is the portion the eldest son inherits, where the younger sons each get only one. Hannah’s husband treats her as if she is as valuable to him as his eldest son and heir. He values her as she’d value her eldest son. He sees values in HER. This is particularly interesting because Hannah lacks value in her society. Women were meant to bear male children. That was what they were FOR, and from which their worth was derived. And Hannah didn’t. But her husband didn’t care. He appears to love her for HER, as she is. That may be a reason for some to be jealous of Hannah, but it surely doesn’t make boring. Because being loved can be so transformative in human life, I wonder how much of Hannah strength comes from her husband’s love. She may struggle with what she’s supposed to be (and isn’t) but she also has an internalized sense of self worth. Her husband might have been part of that.\n\nThis question of Hannah’s value comes up in her interaction with Eli. But first, we need to mention a few truly subversive things that happened before and during that interaction. First of all, she entered the holy space. I don’t know for sure how the worship space was used in Shiloh, but I do know that women weren’t let very far into the Jerusalem temple. For Hannah, even entering the holy space pushed the boundaries of what women were supposed to be doing. I’m also not sure how appropriate it would have been for Hannah to wander off on her own in public space. I suspect she broke the bounds of normalcy on that too. Then there is the fact that she prays SILENTLY and without a sound passing by her lips. We can tell by Eli’s response that her silence wasn’t standard for prayer.\n\nNow, if Hannah was trying to elicit a response from God, and her deal making surely suggests she was, then why wasn’t she participating in prayer the way it was known to be practiced? Was she simply too focused and authentic in her prayer? I don’t think so! I think humans of any faith tradition are deeply enculturated on how to pray, and one wouldn’t be likely to break out of that in a moment of deep prayer. Instead, I wonder if she wanted to have a PRIVATE conversation with God. She went off by herself, she went into a sacred space that was mostly abandoned, and she spoke to God only in her heart. It seems possible that what she was saying was entirely too personal for anyone to know it. I suspect there was even some shame in it, as would be expected for a barren woman begging God to help her.\n\nHannah also makes a deal with God, which is not generally recommended, and she makes one of the more radical ones. Her family is moderately faithful. She offers her son as a livelong nazirite, which is UNHEARD OF. The holiest of holy men were nazirites for a year or two. But she offers. (And she does it! – Hannah is faithful to her promises.)\n\nOK. So now we are on her conversation with Eli. Eli comes up and shames her for her despicable behavior – one that he projects onto her rather than one she has participated in. Hannah ANSWERED. She answered the high priest of that place, and she defended herself. She didn’t walk away in shame. She didn’t hang her head. She defended herself and her VALUE. She WAS a worthless woman by the standards she lived in. But she demands respect from the priest anyway. “‘No, my lord, I am a woman deeply troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord. Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation all this time”\n\n“I am not a worthless woman.” Am I the only one who wants to cheer for her??? Even better it works. Eli may have failed to identify authentic prayer, yet, he is willing to be corrected!! He’s really an OK guy and a good priest, even though me misses some major memos. Eli believes her. That is huge in and of itself, but he also responds to her with a blessing. The blessing clearly matters to her, it cheers her up, and the story seems to think it has to do with her later success in getting pregnant.\n\nHannah names her son, “God has heard” and says she does so because “I asked him of the LORD”. She sounds a bit like Hagar, naming God, “the God who sees” (even me.) Hannah, whose society has told her that she is worthless, has a partner who believes in her worth, and even with her internal struggles finds that she believes in her worth too. Then it is affirmed. It seems to me that by the time Hannah gets pregnant, she is already sure that she is of value in the world and in the eyes of God whether or not she has a child. In the end, I think that’s what is so subversive about Hannah – that she finds the way to claim her own worth, despite society! May we follow in her footsteps because we are much more useful to God when we realize that we are valuable – and of use in building the kindom. Amen\n\n–\n\nRev. Sara E.

Again. It is the beginning of the church year. Again. We\n\nstart anew with the stories. Again. For those among us who have not\n\nattended to the church’s liturgical calendar before, I apologize. It\n\nis a wonderful rhythm of life, and I hope you will be enriched by\n\nliving into it. Personally, I’ve been attending to the church’s\n\nliturgical calendar for decades, and been leading worship in the\n\nliturgical seasons for more than a decade and this is a year where\n\nstarting over again takes some energy.\n\nThe\n\nlast year hasn’t been easy AND there is fear of what will come in\n\nthis coming year. Often I’m frustrated with the rather depressing\n\ntexts that accompany Advent, I don’t want to start in the darkness.\n\nThis year I’m ready and willing to admit that there is much darkness\n\nin the world and that I, too, yearn for the light of God to break in.\n\nIronic, isn’t it? This is the year I’m forgoing those depressing\n\nAdvent texts to continue the Subversive Women sermon series?\n\nThe\n\nSubversive Women chosen for Advent are intentional though. I’ve\n\nalways loved the idea that we start the Christian year in unity with\n\nour shared history with Jewish people, reliving the period in our\n\nshared history when we waited for God’s messiah to change the course\n\nof human history. I also love that we do this in a season of\n\ndarkness (for the Northern Hemisphere – I’m quite sad about how\n\npoorly all the metaphors of the liturgical year work in the Southern\n\nHemisphere and struck that this is yet another experience we have of\n\nprivilege). Anyway, I love that we start the year in darkness, and\n\nin the waiting, and in our shared history. I love that the quietness\n\nof Advent contrasts with the frenetic pace of consumer culture around\n\nus; creating a pause, a pregnant pause. Along with waiting with the\n\nJews, we also wait with Mary in the last month of her pregnancy.\n\nThat\n\nis, I really love Advent. And it is with delight that I offer you\n\nthis text for us to play with today. What better way to start the\n\nChristian year and re-start the telling of our faith story than to go\n\nback to one of the stories of creation? And, what better place to\n\nstart than the woman called “life” itself, Eve? (Yes. Eve means\n\n“life.” Subtle, huh?) After all, she has been accused of\n\nruining human life on this planet in multiple ways, so she MUST be at\n\nleast a little subversive.\n\nThis\n\nis an old, old story. It is in the voice of the Yahwehist, the\n\noldest of the four voices found in the Torah. It is a story trying\n\nto make sense of the world as it is, and there are a lot of\n\nexplanations going on. It is trying to make sense of the human need\n\nfor interpersonal relationships. It is trying to make sense of human\n\ncapabilities exceeding that of other creatures. It is trying to ma"
