GREEN\n\nPRESSES OF\n\nEDWARDS AND BROUGHTON PRINTING COMPANY\n\n1906\n\nPage 5\n\nDEDICATION.\n\nTo God's noblest handiwork and true men's highest conception of ideal perfection, a good, well-balanced woman, true in all the relationships of home and domestic life, and as little deficient in social intercourse with the outside world beyond, pious without pretension, erudite without pedantry, charitable without parade, soft of speech but duly assertive, stickler for the social proprieties but void of prudery, ever genial but never frivolous; - such is an imperfect pen- portraiture of a few of the amiable and lovable traits of one seen in my mind's eye and the one best known in actual life. It is my blessed privilege to have undisputed ownership to such a priceless treasure. Yes! to thee, Adeline, wife of my bosom and solace of declining age, at this the terminal period of \"the fitful dream,\" I pledge renewed troth, and say, as Ferdinand said to Prospero's daughter in the incipiency of new-born love, -\n\n* * * * for several virtues\n\nHave I liked several women; never any\n\nWith so full soul, but some defect in her\n\nDid quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,\n\nAnd put it to the foil: But you, O you,\n\nSo perfect, and so peerless, are created\n\nOf every creature's best.\n\nTo thee, dear wife, is dedicated this, my initial and, most probably, ultimate book.\n\nPage 7\n\nPREFACE.\n\nOn this, the initial day of a new-born century, I begin a work long held in contemplation, namely, the compilation of the Memoirs of a somewhat eventful life of a commonplace sort, covering the greater part of the century just ended; historically speaking, the most eventful of all the centuries. Probably, no epoch of like duration is more replete with books of a reminiscent character.\n\nTo avoid the suspicion of presumption in venturing to launch a new book of a similar sort upon an already over-booked era, be it known from the start, that the self-imposed task is not essayed for futurity, finance, or ephemeral fame. Hence, neither maelstrom, nor iceberg, nor hidden shoal holds out terrors for my puny venture. True, it is intended for posterity, but posterity in a very restricted sense - my own and that of kindred, and of a few tried friends, who have urged the undertaking. If some of these may, perchance, find a kernel of profit out of the mass of chaff attendant, my idle half-hours in the postmeridian of life will not have been entirely misspent.\n\nApropos of books of a reminiscent character, it is a crude opinion of mine that only two classes are entitled to write them, namely, those who have made history themselves, or those who have been brought in close contact and acquaintance with the class who have. Of right to write by rule prescribed, I make no claim, and abjure all pretension on basis number one. On that of number two, I think I may, without incurring the suspicion of vanity or arrogance, jot down some few of many reminiscences connected with illustrious personages, for it was my proud privilege to be brought in close touch with many of them.\n\nPage 8\n\nConspicuous amongst these, in boyhood and maturer age, was a quartet, or rather quintet, of world-recognized gentlemen and historical heroes. I knew and honored and loved them, each and all, and thank the Master that it was my blessed prerogative to have been born of their tribe and racial line of thought. By name, they are known as John C. Calhoun, Andrew Jackson, Jefferson Davis, Albert Sidney Johnston, and Wade Hampton. Others there were, fitting compeers of even such as these; but, as I am essaying memoir only, - not history, - they are not mentioned by nomenclature. The Muse of History will, doubtless, align with the others Robert E. Lee, Thomas J. Jackson, and Nathan B. Forrest, only the first-named of whom was known to me personally, and but slightly; the last so casually as not to justify the claim of acquaintance on my part, and the second, not at all. Hence this reticence. Booked they all are for highest niches in \"Walhalla.\"\n\nIn discussing this batch of \"preux-chevaliers,\" and others of kindred soul but less resplendent lustre, as well as others still, who can set up no claim to kinship with such immaculates as these, it is proposed to do so fairly and dispassionately, but with no mawkish observance of the classic adage - \"De mortuis nil, nisi bonum.\" If allusion is made to such as Nero, Caligula, Commodus, or Domitian, in an earlier age; or to Alva, Jeffreys, or the Guises, in more recent times, chance position of the culprit will not restrain anathema, or rather, harsh criticism. Silence is sometimes culpable. \"The rank is but the guinea's stamp; a spade's a spade, for all that.\" Some have deemed me aforetime too plain of speech, in not calling that useful implement by a more euphemistic synonym. To such, the reply is that having used unvarnished old English up to the allotted span of man, it is now too late to acquire a modulated and more euphonic dialect in dealing with knaves, shams, and pretenders.\n\nPage 9\n\nIf there is any merit in my desultory writings, having been a scribbler off and on through life, it consists in thorough conviction and pointedness of expression. Those who object to that style might as well close the little volume. Rosewater and diluted catnip is repugnant to taste, and unsuited to my genius. The field is already overcrowded with that sort, men who shun a positive, unequivocal expression of opinion on men, measures, and policies, as they would a bolt from a catapult.\n\nJanuary 1, 1900.\n\nPage 11\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nBirth, Genealogy, and Earliest Childhood Days - Loss of Mother When Four Years Old - Transference to Home of My Uncle Joseph P.

Many of them were of marked name, trait, and characteristic, and none ever false to himself, his blood, or his manhood, as far as my researches go. The fountain source of migration was, in every instance, \"English, pure and undefiled,\" for which Heaven be praised. There was not a Tory in the stock in the Revolutionary War, nor a traitor or renegade to the South in the \"War between the States\"; very few of these last since then. All branches flowed from Virginia and North Carolina into Tennessee, where concentration set in, towards the close of the eighteenth century. As a rule, they were ever planters and tillers of the soil, although some few sided off into professional and mechanical pursuits. Such is a simple and succinct statement of family history. It is one of which no scion of any house in this broad land could be ashamed. Let him, who can match it, say \"Laus Deo!\" in all fervor.\n\nMy father, Thomas J. Green, of Warren County, North Carolina, afterwards General Green of Texan Revolutionary fame, married my mother, Sarah A. Wharton, of Nashville, Tennessee, on January 8, 1830. She was the daughter of Honorable Jesse Wharton, at one time United States Senator in Congress. They moved to his plantation, near St. Mark's, Florida, where I was born on February 28, 1831. By death I sustained the irretrievable loss of this last dear parent on\n\n\"SUGAR TREE GROVE\"\n\nThe residence of my great grandfather, Joseph Phillips, six miles form Nashville, Tenn., which he settled and built in 1791. He and his wife having traveled from Edgecombe County, North Carolina, the seat of their respective families by wagon and located this spot which is still owned by one of their granddaughters, Mrs. Margaret Polk. Their progeny to-day by close computation numbering between four and five hundred.\n\nPage 16\n\nMarch 11, 1835, being thus deprived of her ministering care at the early age of four years. She had met with the same great affliction when barely one year old. She was only twenty-three, and her mother twenty-six, at the time of death. The thought that oft recurred - would I not have been a better man had her life been spared a few years longer? Not that I have any right or cause to complain of the dear hands that received me. On the contrary, never did motherless waif pass into gentler and more considerate keeping. A few lines descriptive of this peculiarly interesting couple (my uncle, Joe Wharton, and his wife, Caroline) will not be out of place. They had married about the time that my parents did, and had the incipiency of a young family, which later on increased to large proportions. Two of their sons, and a son-in-law, died fighting for liberty, and the regret of both was that they could not duplicate their tender to the Cause. They took me into their house as if I had been one of their little fold, and for the nine or ten years succeeding accorded precisely the same. May their souls rest in peace, and their reward be commensurate to their unpretentious good works. Fortunately, they were well to do. A thousand broad acres of as inviting land as Middle Tennessee contains was their abiding-place, with forty or fifty sleek, overfed, contented negroes to cultivate them. The recollection of that home and the blessed spirit pervading it is a veritable dream of Arcadia.\n\nEvery thing used on the place was raised or made on the place, except sugar, coffee, powder and lead, and a few woman's fixings. The men-folk dressed in homespun, and were well content to get it. With no attempt at ostentation or display, they were nevertheless the most bountiful livers for their means, and in their simple way, that I have ever known. Hospitality was a synonym for home, the latchstring being ever on the outside of the door. In those blessed days, there were but few things to cause pain or occasion\n\nPage 17\n\ntrouble. Primarily of these were, by alliteration, pedagogues, pinafores, and apparitions. Especially was the pedagogue my pet abomination, being almost ever of the genus ignoramic, tyrannic, or pompostic, individually, or in combination. Being a tyrant hater by nature as well as by inheritance, one of my grandfathers having been of that honorable Commission of Forty (afterwards known as \"Regicides\") that cut off the head of one Charles Stuart, about the last of that crown-wearing tribe of tyrants in England. God be praised both the sceptre-bearing and rod-wielding specimens of the vile tribe are fast becoming extinct. Tyranny has had its day!\n\nDionysius, the historic tyrant, is dead; and so is his pedagogic successor, Dionysius, the terror of schoolboys. I write feelingly in behalf of the boy to be, having been a boy myself, under that merciless regime. They all seemed to have a special hate against me, and, to be candid, there was little love lost between us, as certified by old smarts and long-dormant grudge for having received them for nothing. Unfortunately, the other fellow had 'whip hand,' and 'hinc lachrymae.' But there was one day when the boys would get the upper hand of the dominie, and that was \"turning-out\" day of blessed memory. (See Judge Longstreet's description in \"Georgia Scenes.\")\n\nMy father left a young negro woman, Lucinda by name, to wait on me in my juvenile years. She had been my nurse, and was devoted to me, but, unfortunately, her head was full of African 'folk-lore' and superstitions, in which the horrible predominated, all of which naturally passed into my own cranium. Being of a credulous and impressive temperament, they made a most baleful and baneful impress on the imagination until nine or ten years of age, especially when having to sleep in a room by myself. Many a night in mid-summer have I slept with head under blankets to shut out a\n\nPage 18\n\ndevil's 'high carnival' in dread apprehension. It is easy to look back and smile at these fancies and conjurations of juvenile years, but at the time it was no laughing matter, but veritable purgatorial torture. I sincerely trust that few boys or girls have ever suffered a tithe as much in those tender years. To make the hallucination utterly inexplicable in my case, it was notorious that I could \"lick\" any boy in school though my superior by long odds in pounds, inches, and age. This, perhaps, was at times needlessly done to convince myself that I was not a coward for standing in such mortal terror of the devil and his imps, and rawhides and bloody bones. More singular still, I didn't believe in that absurd phantasmagoria any more then than to-day. This is the honest experience of a lad who was, and admits he was, afraid of ghosts and goblins, and yet did not believe in their existence. What a strange anomaly the mind is any way.\n\nNow for the third, and last, misery of my boyhood life at that early stage, - 'pinafores.' At the time of beginning life in this rustic paradise, there was left an elaborate supply of juvenile toggery, appropriate to a picnic or a Sunday-school, but entirely out of place in a day-school for country children. This I realized very early, and importuned raiment befitting surroundings. My aunt, however, being of a frugal mind, thought it expedient that they should be worn before outgrown. As they invariably exhibited a soiled and battered show-up after school was out, she concluded to add checked aprons to the 'get-up,' as a sort of armor-protector. An extra fight or two for days succeeding, for the twit of being 'a gal,' led to the conclusion, on my part, that this addendum in raiment was not suited to my 'style of beauty.' And so they disappeared, to be substituted by a 'dressing' of another sort on reaching home. My aunt, though later on a 'rebel,' so-called, herself, was not prone to tolerate rebellion to established authority in her little domain. And so the contest continued\n\nPage 19\n\nbetween us, day after day, until the supply of the obnoxious things was exhausted, or else the dear good soul's patience and powers of endurance. It seems to me, after these long years, that she tacitly called a truce. Certes, there was no 'Appomattox' for me in that momentous struggle for the 'Rights of Man.'\n\nIt was a miniature prelude to another struggle soon to follow on a far more extended scale. I know that my aunt thought she was right in this needless assertion of prerogative, for she never did a thing in her blessed life that wouldn't stand that primary test. Perhaps, too, Bill Seward and his puppets thought the same in their sublime assertion of prerogative. And yet, is it not barely possible that each might have been slightly out of reckoning? I could not help thinking then, and still maintain, that it is a desecration to try to turn a boy into a girl or a dude. Not that girls are not an essential factor in the world's economy and make-up; but still, no true boy wants to be one, much less that nondescript other thing. Let it be said, that those are the only whippings this my second mother ever gave me, with the exception of an occasional one for a Sunday fishing escapade. Uncle Joe never struck me a lick in his life, that comes to recollection, probably thinking I got my full complement at school. Be it said, that whilst pedagogic brutality was sometimes met by puny and impotent resistance, I always took my Aunt Caroline's corrections like a little man.\n\nAnd so the period of first boyhood passed by, and the tenth year beginning, say, the secondary period came on. By that time I was a strong, robust, double-jointed specimen of juvenile humanity. Am glad to say my constitution, by that time grounded, was strengthened by the next four or five years of active outdoor exercise, riding, hunting, fishing, etc. My health has always been exceptionally good, up to the near\n\nPage 20\n\napproach of the Biblical limit of the years of man's pilgrimage. At least, it was so until this vile imported foreign disease, called 'La Grippe,' put in an appearance a year or so ago. That has not only impaired physical stamina, but worse by far, changed a disposition naturally gentle, forbearing, and amiable, into the morose and melancholic order. Never thought it would please me. The orthography is too Frenchy for the ear of an Englishman.\n\nPage 21\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nThe second stage of these puerilities naturally calls for a new chapter.\n\nMy Uncle Joe was an inborn sportsman, one of the finest shots, both with the rifle and shotgun, that I have ever known. In due time these were permitted me to use, glorious privilege that it was. He was the owner likewise of one of the finest packs of hounds in Tennessee, and one of the highest delights in life was to follow them in his company. Those dogs in after years became my sole and exclusive property by deed of gift from his son Bob, who was not averse to becoming the son-in- law of one of the largest sheep raisers in the country, who naturally had a repugnance to the whole canine family, both of high and low degree. Alas! poor Bob, after sacrificing his pets to propitiate the father, failed to win the consent of the daughter, thus losing \"Tray, Blanche, Sweetheart, and all.\" Cousin Robert had my heartfelt sympathy, especially for the loss of 'Sweetheart,' but when he asked for a cancellation of the aforesaid deed, I couldn't see it. Poor Bob, it is too mean to spring the story on you at this late day, but it was too good to keep all to myself. Still, in this sad, sad tale may be seen confirmation of the old saw - \"Patient waiters are no losers.\" Though Robert never fed his father's flocks on the Grampian Hills, he, nevertheless, married one of the finest and finest- looking women in all those parts, and can count a round baker's dozen of boys and girls around him, whom he and his good wife can call their own.\n\nUp to that date I had escaped juvenile ailments, including the tender passion and the measles. Exemption from the first was probably due to native bashfulness and dread of 'strange creatures.' Next to a lean, lanky, bonified ghost, nothing was so terrible as a fat, laughing, romping, rosy-cheeked\n\nPage 22\n\ngirl. They seemed to know, by instinct, that they had me 'hacked,' and it was their delight to play on my fears. And yet, it was only a vague, ill-defined apprehension at the bottom. The thought never occurred that they would bite me any more than that demons would rend me, but they scared all the same. The incipient sisterhood ought to know better than to make sweet faces and frighten poor innocent lads.\n\nBut the measles! The whole school had it and could stay at home, but it was not for me to take it.\n\nWhen the tender passion did awake, each attack was of a virulent type, the first love-spell especially. It came on in the fourteenth or fifteenth year. By the way, the incertitude as to precise dates of important events here shown is a fact that is going to give trouble in the furtherance of this self-imposed task, never having kept a connected diary as every boy and girl, and man and woman, should. But to return to my first love. \"Inamorata\" had the advantage by about a dozen years. It was a case of unrequited affection. She treated me meanly. Of course, such ill-mated ardor had to find utterance by the mouth of the ink-bottle. Yes, let it be confessed, I wrote her, aye, in burning words, telling of never having loved another, and of unalterable devotion to her. Either through the direct agency of that superannuated young female, or by surreptitious means, to me unknown, that billet-doux passed into the hands of all others most objectionable, those of my paternal ancestor. Perhaps, he didn't make himself merry, and me miserable, by reference to and quotation from that injudicious and ill-starred epistolary effusion. These were usually of the merry twinkle of the eye sort of order, but none the less galling. It cured me of love letters for a long time to follow. Moral: \"Boys, do not write them; girls, do not answer them; and thus the evil will be cured.\"\n\nPage 23\n\nA mile from the house was the millpond, replete with fine perch, and it afforded endless enjoyment, for I have ever been a devotee of the rod - of the fishing-rod, be it understood.\n\nAnd so the world sped on for nine or ten years after entering this ideal home of boyhood. One day, on returning from the creek, soiled, wet, barefoot, coatless, a stranger met me on entering. He was one of the most superb specimens of manly good looks that I had ever seen up to that time, or have ever seen since, and most faultlessly attired. He looked the soldier in every lineament, movement and gesture, and as one born to command. He was my father, and embraced me warmly. Kiss me, he did not, and never did, but taught me to despise that mode of salutation between men as effeminate and savoring too much of the Latin races, none of which stood high in his estimation.\n\nA separate chapter will be devoted to General Green later on.\n\nPage 24\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nThe next day saw me in the hands of the village tailor.\n\nAfter emerging, I hardly knew myself, or was recognizable to others, such a complete transmogrification having been wrought in the outer man. The day after, I made my entry into the wide, wide world beyond.\n\nAfter mutual lamentations between my aunt, the children and myself, my uncle having walked off a piece, we started to Nashville, thirty-three miles off, by hired conveyance. Eighteen miles from Lebanon stands \"The Hermitage,\" the home of one of the grandest and most remarkable men of this country and century, or those of any others. General Green had been a favored young friend of the grand old man in his earlier years, and had spent some time as his guest. His admiration for him was so great that he bestowed the name of the old hero on me, his only child. Note. This I continued to bear until the Nullification and Force Proclamation induced us both to reflect that it would be as well to substitute for the old gentleman's first name (Andrew) my mother's maiden name Wharton, which has clung to me ever since. That political blunder of his was the only act that we deplored.\n\nOf course, there was no passing such a spot without stopping. On being told that the General was still in bed, my father told the servant not to disturb him, but to give his card on arousing. As we were starting back to the vehicle, the servant rushed back exclaiming: \"Master says don't go, but come right in.\" Be it said that for this deviation from the rule against seeing visitors, the great question of Texan Annexation was then just in the bloom, President Polk having been installed in office only a month before. His great predecessor was so deeply absorbed in this momentous issue that,\n\nPage 25\n\nalthough only six weeks from the grave, he had himself helped up and arrayed in his morning gown, seated in easy chair with pipe lit, and talked by the hour on this matter nearest his heart with one fresh from the Lone-Star Republic, and presumably posted on the drift of opinion in that quarter. Here was illustration of the old saying - \"The ruling passion strong in death.\" One remark impressed me: - \"Let me live to see that consummated, and I can depart in peace.\" Other things he said that still remain on memory's tablets.\n\nAfter a while, as illustrating his proverbial politeness and consideration for others, evidently thinking the conversation was dull to a boy, he sent for one of his young kinsmen of about my age (if not at fault his grandson and namesake), and told him to take me in the garden and show me the flowers. He showed more, namely Aunt Rachel's and Uncle Andrew's graves, side by side, and covered by a little summer-house-like structure. \"But the General isn't dead,\" I put in. \"All the same,\" was the reply, \"but he wanted to have it this way, and you know he has always had his own way.\" To this I assented with the after-thought of after-years - \"except when Aunt Rachel put in her mild veto, supplemented with tears.\" God bless them both! for the \"give-in,\" on such occasions, of that iron, and otherwise inflexible, will.\n\nOn taking leave, he placed his hands upon my head, and gave me his blessing. Later on in life, two others of the world's celebrities did the same, barring the manipulation, thus wise.\n\nAs we were returning from a country-drive one afternoon in Rome, we met the head of a pontifical cortege in carriages, returning from some church festival or other religious duty. Being in Rome, etc., I naturally conformed to the customs of Rome, alighted, and stood uncovered until the carriage of Pio Nono had passed. To our surprise, it stopped abreast, and\n\nPage 26\n\nthe venerable Pontifex Maximus, for whom I have ever since felt the highest respect, had his driver stop, and, leaning out of the window, bestowed the \"benedicite\" (if correct in Church nomenclature), and moved on. Whether that good old man's good wish has kept me immune from the ills of life, I am not prepared to say, but appreciate the force of the great Hildebrand's reproof to the stiff-necked and stiff-kneed young Englishman, who refused to kneel at High-Mass in St. Peter's: - \"My son, the blessing of an old man will do thee no hurt.\"\n\nThe third instance apposite was at \"Beauvoir,\" Mississippi, of which more, perhaps, anon.\n\nIt would seem that I ought to have turned out to be a much better specimen than I have, after so much benediction from sources most highly appreciated, each world-mover, as he was. If the blessing of three such good old men as these availeth not to keep a poor wayward child out of the burning, then tell me not of a conjoint one of the whole College of Cardinals, with the eleven thousand virgins of Cologne thrown in for good measure.\n\nOn leaving that historic home of the most pronounced, not to say remarkable, character in American history, I could but remark on the judicious judgment in selection and the good taste in its development. Everything evinced the eye and touch of the natural artist in all of its concomitants and surroundings. The \"Hermitage neighborhood\" had long been a synonym for refinement, high tone, and hospitality, up to the outbreak of the war, as I can aver from frequent visits thereabouts later on in early manhood. The fertility of the soil and adaptability to agriculture were in keeping with those exalted traits of the owners. In the heart of that lovely region it was that the hero of the most wonderful battle, and one of the most unique and phenomenal careers on record, built his house and reared his beautiful and peaceful home in\n\nPage 27\n\nthe latter part of one of the stormiest and yet withal one of the most uniformly successful lives, on a grand historic scale, that any man can point to.\n\nHis previous homes, from the one-room cabin in Western North Carolina, in which his grand old Irish mother had blessed the world at large, but more especially her newly adopted country, with a hero, a sage, a statesman, and, above all, a MAN. His homes, I say, and surroundings, had not been of the highest aesthetic type, but he was at home where-ever he was, from the aforesaid cabin to the Presidential mansion. He was a marked figure in every sphere and station of life. This power of adaptability to change of conditions and circumstances has been adduced by a great thinker as one of the most infallible proofs of inborn gentility, if not of highest order of genius. He was right, and here was an exemplar of the combination. Of him it may be said, if of any, - \"And thus he bore, without reproach, the grand old name of gentleman\"; the best definition of which rare character, as given by Thackeray, is - \"It is to be gentle and generous, brave and wise, and having these qualifications, to exercise them in the most graceful manner.\" This he exemplified always, as Bayard might have done at times, Chesterfield never.\n\nOf him was said by a newly arrived French ambassador: - \"This, Mr. Secretary of State, is the surprise of my life. I went in with you expecting to find a boor in your Chief Magistrate, and I tell you now, in all soberness, that I know not his counterpart for refinement in the court of my own country.\" High praise that from a Frenchman.\n\nIn that lovely section of country, he drew around him on neighboring plantations many of his wife's kindred, having none of his own. These, and other congenial homes in the surrounding country, made it one of the most famous residential quarters in the entire country. Such was the fitting\n\nPage 28\n\nretreat of the old hero in the closing years of his most remarkable career. Here it was rounded off some six or eight weeks after the visit referred to, in peace and good will with all mankind, as he declared to his beloved pastor, Dr. Edgar, some time before the end came. No man ever had such hosts of warm, devoted friends, and few, such virulent and implacable foes. The first he owed to his undeviating sincerity, utter fearlessness, and devotion to duty, both public and private. The last were due, in great measure, to his self-assertiveness whenever his conscience told him he was in the right. Assertive he usually was when so convinced; needlessly aggressive, most rarely. Most marked instance of this last was his quarrel with a brother-giant, Mr. Calhoun, whose nature was cast in a kindred mould.\n\nHe ever met the puppy impertinence of \"unworthies,\" whether on his own social plane or not, with silent and sovereign contempt, until it called for the cane, the cowhide, or the pistol. It must be confessed, too, that in his earlier manhood he fought cocks, raised and ran race-horses, and deported himself generally like an untamed young war-horse of the young country in which his lot was cast. But there was no duplicity or sniveling or hypocrisy in his make-up. He wore his badge upon his sleeve, and it bore the impress - \"truth, courage, honor, country, charity,\" and his escutcheon was never belied. True, perhaps, at that stage he was not a model specimen of approved orthodox \"high society,\" a \"400\" sort of artificial thing; but he was what that pack of popinjays could not evolve in a million years - a MAN, - such as the poet called for -\n\n\"Give me a man that's all a man,\n\nWho stands up straight and strong;\n\nWho loves the plain and simple truth,\n\nAnd scorns to do a wrong.\"\n\nThere he was!\n\nPage 29\n\nThe last time I visited this tomb of a hero was just three years ago, on the occasion of the Confederate Veterans' Reunion in Nashville, in 1897, in company of my wife, youngest daughter, and Mrs. Mary Donelson Wilcox of Washington, daughter of President Jackson's Private Secretary, Andrew J. Donelson, and the first child ever born in the White House. It was a privilege to have this accomplished woman for a cicerone midst the scenes of her girlhood days, replete with incident and childhood memories of Uncle Andrew. It was one of the mysterious charms that he possessed, that all children loved him after their brief acquaintance. He seemed to crave the company of the little ones, probably because he and Rachel had none of their own, and he, not a known relation in the world. The great man was lonesome.\n\nPage 30\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nPerhaps, it may be said by some that the preceding chapter is a little too effusive in laudation of this extraordinary man. To such be it said, that the estimate given is the mature conviction of life-long reading and reflection in maturer years. In boyhood days, he was far from being one of my ideal heroes, for that period had been passed in the strongest Whig county, I believe, in the United States, where party passion ran to the highest pitch, and my juvenile mind had been unconsciously tinctured with antipathies against our neighbor, just over the Wilson border, closely akin to what had until lately been felt for the devil. And yet, here was a philosophic Warwick, who made Presidents and shaped policies, in his voluntary retiracy. Tell me not, ye partisan bigots, that this man was not a giant among giants. He stands on the historic scroll so inscribed, and all the puny malignity of partisan and sectional hate cannot wipe it out. In all reverence, be it said; God be praised, he was a North Carolinian.\n\nI come now to speak of another character of kindred type, if not the same effulgent shine - my father.\n\nGeneral Thomas Jefferson Green; a sketch from the North Carolina University Magazine, 1892, No. 5, by his son, W. J. Green.\n\nDespite the possible imputation that praise of a near kinsman is only a sort of reflected self-laudation, I venture to give the outline of the life-story of my nearest male progenitor, premising that if space permitted a fuller recital, the lives of few would furnish more varied and startling incident.\n\nTo briefly summarize. In the fifteen years of his active public life he had been a representative in one or the other branch of no less than four different State legislatures, a\n\nGENERAL THOS. J. GREEN\n\nPage 31\n\nbrigadier-general in command during the Texan revolution, had laid the foundation of three cities now in train of full-fledged development, had by legislative enactment established the boundary line between Texas and Mexico, which led to the war between the United States and Mexico and the resulting acquisition by us of New Mexico, Arizona, California and Nevada; and was the first active advocate of a railroad to the Pacific, giving as reason imperative public necessity, gauged simply from a military standpoint, and without reference to the great East Indian trade, which has been the making (omitting unmaking) of every State claiming its monopoly. There is a record, and a sustainable record, of which no man need be ashamed.\n\nBorn amidst the throes of political revolution, of which Jefferson and Hamilton were the incarnate embodiment of antagonizing ideas, he received the name and espoused the teachings of the first, and clung to them with unwavering tenacity until his final dissolution amdist the mighty clash of arms resulting some three-score years later on. He ever held that his namesake was the wisest political thinker of all times, and that Mr. Calhoun was his worthy disciple. No public act of his did he ever deplore or deprecate, save his ungenerous persecution of a kindred intellect and on the same line of thought. Speaking of this last, self-poised and self-reliant, shipwrecked by emotional clamor and the force of circumstances, he has been heard to declare that \"the best-directed bullet that ever left the mouth of a pistol was when Colonel Burr pulled trigger on the heights of Weehawken.\"\n\nHe once took that unfortunate gentleman as text to inculcate a lesson to me. \"Whilst Colonel Burr pushed his contempt of invidious public opinion to a fatal extreme, I would nevertheless have you, my son, imitate him to the extent of not attaching undue weight to the fulsome praise of overzealous friends or the covert dispraise of inimical mouthers.\n\nPage 32\n\nHe, whose life motto is 'mens sibi conscia recti,' will not be unduly elated or depressed by either.\"\n\nHe was partly educated at Chapel Hill, and partly at the United States Military Academy. Returning home, he was elected to the General Assembly shortly after attaining his majority. Shortly thereafter he married the daughter of Hon. Jesse Wharton, of Nashville, Tennessee, who had figured in both houses of Congress from that State. Thereupon he removed to Florida, then a territory, and engaged in planting until the death of his young wife five years later, having represented his county in the Legislature during that time. He thereupon repaired to Texas, which had lately declared her independence of Mexico, and tendered his services to the young republic, just then emerging into statehood. It is safe to assert that no corresponding population of any age or country ever possessed such a galaxy of adventurous, daring spirits, and brilliant, brainy, cultured men. They poured in from all sections and many countries, but notably from the Southern States. A common impulse actuated all, namely, to throw off the Mexican yoke and to erect a new republic identical with that on the other side of the Sabine.\n\nWhen it is taken into account that the incipient State covered an area about seven times greater than North Carolina, and was occupied by a meager population, barely exceeding that of Wake County to-day, and that these had deliberately resolved to measure blades and try conclusions with an adjacent nation nearly two hundred to a unit in excess of numbers, the purpose ranks either as the superlative of madness or the sublimity of heroism. They dared to do it, and they did it.\n\nOdds considered, it eclipses all the revolutions of antecedent time. Of course minimum in numbers had to be compensated by maximum in men, and so it was. There were no dwarfs or cowards there, but \"men, high-minded\n\nPage 33\n\nmen,\" and mostly of good old English stock. By any others the attempt would have been the acme of lunacy. Consider but a few of them, for small as their number was, it was too extended for a muster-roll. There was Branch T. Archer, \"the old Roman,\" the father of the revolution; Albert Sidney Johnston, by a later war catalogued with the recognized few greatest captains of all time; John Wharton, \"the keenest blade that flashed on the field of San Jacinto,\" and William, his well- mated brother; Mirabeau Lamar, statesman, soldier, poet, philanthropist, with inherent intellect permeating every drop of his blood. There was Felix Huston, of fame punctilious, and grand old Ruske, and Henderson, Hamilton, Houston, Burleson, Burnet, Hunt, Milam Travis, Crockett, Bee, Hays, McCulloch, Moore, Fisher, Sherman, Wilson, Anson Jones, Lubock, Smith, and a legion of others too numerous to mention - heroes, one and all.\n\n\"Souls made of fire, and children of the sun,\" were they, imbued with hatred of oppression and love of adventure. General (and afterwards Governor and Senator) Foote places the subject of this memoir in the forefront rank of those gallant spirits for services rendered his adopted country. (Vide \"Texas and Texans.\") We challenge any historic State, numbers considered, to mate at juncture that matchless chivalry in all the lofty attributes of true manhood. Let the slur of witlings be admitted that some there were in that heterogenous population \"who had quit their country for their country's good.\" I, for one, will maintain, if need be, before a college of cardinals, that self- sacrifice that prompted the following of such as these condoned much previous offending.\n\nCharity is first in the eye of the Most High. Where can higher illustration be found than in heroism which prompts self- immolation for principle and for posterity? Who knows that when the golden gates are being besieged by clamorous\n\nPage 34\n\nclaim for admittance, \"Goliad\" and \"The Alamo\" will not constitute better passport to the sympathetic old janitor, who upon a generous impulse could chop off an ear, than will psalmody, unsupported by regard for the rights of others? I can but believe that Peter will strain a point when Crockett and Travis and Fannin knock.\n\nArriving in Texas in 1836, he was commissioned brigadier- general and directed to return to \"the States\" and raise a brigade. This he promptly did, absorbing his entire fortune in the effort. Whilst so engaged in New Orleans a ludicrous incident is reported to have occurred in one of the Episcopal churches of that city. There was a striking likeness between his kinsman, the Rev. Leonidas Polk, and himself. One Sunday some of his recruits chanced to stray into a church where the later-on fighting bishop was officiating. One of them, mistaking him for his senior officer, who was not over-clerically inclined, remarked, loud enough to be heard by most of the congregation: \"Well, boys, who'd a thought it? Uncle Jeff a-preaching, and in his shirt-tail at that.\" It is needless to add that an unorthodox smile spread over the worshippers.\n\nIn the meanwhile the decisive battle of San Jacinto had been won against overwhelming odds, and the Mexican Generalissimo was a puling prisoner. Fate so ordained that General Green should arrive at Velasco on the identical day that Santa Anna was released and placed on a war vessel to be carried to Vera Cruz. General Green, believing this to be an unauthorized exercise of power on the part of some one, protested against its being carried out. Together with Generals Hunt and Henderson, under authority of President Burnet, he went on board and brought him ashore. This action was fully sustained by the government, and the tyrant was consigned to his custody for safe keeping. During the time, he was my father's guest and bed-fellow. When their relations\n\nPage 35\n\nwere subsequently reversed, General Green was made to feel acutely his long pent-up venom. The Mexican assassin ordered him heavily ironed and made to work the roads. This last he emphatically refused to do, though threatened with death as the alternative. (See his Journal.)\n\nFor a while the young republic enjoyed comparative immunity after her big neighbor had been taught on the San Jacinto the sort of material she was made of. But later on Mexico relying on numbers and resources, and her President having partially recovered from his panic, incident to the San Jacinto 'grip' and consequent confinement, began his incursions again, and carried them on in a most merciless and demoniac spirit, scarcely equalled in barbaric atrocity by any civilized people since the devastation of the Palatinate.\n\nThen it was, as if by common consent of the sturdy settlers; a counter-invasion was resolved upon. A force of two or three thousand was assembled, and all clamorous for retaliation. But, through executive, sharp practice and chicane, President Houston being opposed to the movement, the bulk of them was induced to disband and return to their homes. Some seven hundred, however, resolved to remain, and, under command of General Somerville, an appointee of President Sam Houston, crossed into Mexico. Their commander, however, imitating the King of France, marched over, and then marched back again. Then, under implied executive authority, he started homewards with something like one-half of his command.\n\nThree hundred and four gallant fellows, however, refused to go, and determined to recross the Rio Grande and try conclusions on the enemy's ground. The battle of Mier was the consequence, in which two hundred and sixty-one (261) Texans, after inflicting a loss of over three times their number upon a force of two thousand three hundred and forty\n\nPage 36\n\n(2,340) under General Ampudia, were cajoled into a surrender by false claim and falser promise. It is well-established fact that General Green, the second in command, protested most loudly against such promise, and called for a hundred volunteers to cut their way through the enemy's lines. These not being forthcoming, he was surrendered with the rest, after firing with effect the two last shots and breaking his arms.\n\nThey were then started on foot for the Castle of Perote for safe keeping, that being the strongest fortress in Mexico; Colonel Fisher, General Green, and Captain Henrie as interpreter, being kept in advance as hostages for the good behavior of the others. When considerably advanced in the country, he found means to communicate with the command, and enjoined upon them to make a break if opportunity occurred, without regard to himself and the other two. This they did at Salado, overpowering and disarming a guard of more than twice their number, and started back for Texas. Subsequently they were recaptured in the mountains, in a starving condition and perishing of thirst. Then ensued one of the crowning infamies of Mexico's President - the tyrant, Santa Anna. By his bloodthirsty order, every tenth man of that little band of heroes was, by lot, taken out and assassinated. Upon receipt of news of it, a halt was called and the hostages told to dismount in order to carry out his orders to shoot them.\n\nAll preliminaries to the command \"Fire!\" being arranged, the captain, who was a devout son of the Established Church, bethought himself of one oversight. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, through the interpreter, \"would you not like priestly consolation before we part company?\" \"Tell him no,\" was my father's rejoinder; \"that we belong to a race that knows but one Father confessor, and He seems to be unknown in this God-forsaken country.\"\n\nPage 37\n\nBeing then asked if he would like to make a dying speech, the reply was: \"Tell him yes, Dan, I have a dying speech to make; that I had begun to think we were in charge of a gentleman and a soldier, but now discover the mistake; that, like most of his mongrel race, he is only a d--d cowardly assassin and hireling butcher.\"\n\nPoor Dan, who taught me Spanish a little later on, and who was by act of the United States Congress a little later recognized hero of \"Encarnacion,\" was of incalculable service to General Taylor on the eve of Buena Vista, by information conveyed by him by means of one of the most reckless escapes ever made after that surrender. The incident deserves more than passing notice. Captain Henrie (Dan) was an ex-midshipman in the United States navy, and laughed at danger as he did at most other things. He was amongst the first to volunteer in the Mexican war, giving as a reason that he intended \"to get even with the green-backed mulattoes over the Grande.\" When Colonel Clay's command, on advanced service, was surrounded and captured at Encarnacion, Dan was of the number. General Ampudia, recognizing him, remarked: \"And so, Captain Henrie, we are to have the pleasure of your company back to Perote!\" \"Excuse me General,\" was the saucy reply; \"when I travel I generally select my own company.\" The Colonel, who was riding a high-mettled thoroughbred by courtesy of the captor, rode up to Dan shortly after the march was begun, and told him in undertone that it was all-important that General Taylor should be advised that the enemy were concentrating in overwhelming force in that quarter. \"Get me in your stirrups Colonel, and I'll take it to him, or die,\" was the prompt reply. This was effected on the plea that he, the Colonel, would like for one of his men to tone down his charger. Dan, of course, was the man selected. As soon as he was in the saddle he began to make the noble animal restive by a sly application\n\nPage 38\n\nof the spur, and then suddenly driving them both in to the rowels, he rode through and over half a dozen mustangs and their riders, and, though a thousand \"escopitas\" were emptied at him, he and his horse escaped without a scratch. Waving his hat, he yelled back: \"Adios, Ampudia; tell old Peg-Leg (Santa Anna) we'll give him hell.\" In briefest time possible the news was conveyed to \"Old Zack.\" In recognition of the feat, Congress voted the hero six thousand dollars ($6,000) and two thousand (2,000) acres of land (if I am correct as to quantity), and Dan lived upon it like a fighting cock for three whole months, and a little later on died in the Charity Hospital, St. Louis, true to the last to man's noblest instincts and to all of his host of friends, except himself.\n\nCaptain Henrie, I say, used laughingly to remark that whilst the General's \"dying speech was rendered in my best and most expressive Castilian,\" I took the liberty of adding on my own hook: \"Captain, them's not my sentiments; I know you to be muy valiente.\" Dan further added that the effect produced by the \"dying speech\" was electric, and just the reverse of that anticipated. \"Tell him,\" exclaimed the Mexican officer, \"he is not mistaken. If General Santa Anna requires paid butchers, he will have to find a substitute for me. Mount, gentlemen, and let's push on.\"\n\nClose shaving, that! Finally, the whole party were locked up in Perote's dungeon keep. Before they had well gotten their new quarters warm, objecting to the cold comfort they afforded, sixteen of the most resolute determined to vacate them and re-immigrate to Texas. To do this they had to cut through an eight-foot wall composed of a volcanic rock harder than granite, and with most crude and indifferent utensils to work with. It was a conception sufficient to have appalled even Baron Trenck, whom all the State prisons of Prussia could not restrain. It required weeks and months of unremitting work to do it, but finally it was done; and on the night\n\nPage 39\n\nof July 2, 1843, they crawled through the narrow aperture, which six months of starvation made easier for them, let themselves down by means of a small rope to the bottom of the moat, some twenty or thirty feet below, scaled the opposite side and a \"chevaux de frise\" beyond, and stood up free once more, but carrying their lives in hand. Here they separated, by preconcert, into parties of two; General Green and our old friend, Captain Dan Henrie, going together and striking out for Vera Cruz. Eight of them, after incalculable sufferings, hardships and hairbreadth escapes, including the two last named, got back to Texas. The other eight were recaptured.\n\nAll of the special details, incidents and anecdotes connected with these splendid achievements were graphically told by General Green in \"The Texan Expedition Against Mier,\" an octavo volume of some five hundred pages, published by the Harpers in 1845, a work extensively sold, which many of your older readers will doubtless recall, now out of print.\n\nShortly after his arrival at home, he was returned to the Congress of Texas, where he was unremitting in his efforts to effect the release of his unfortunate comrades whom he left in Mexican dungeons. This was finally effected, some twelve months later on, after some of their original number had paid the extreme penalty that cowardly tyranny can extort from freedom's champions when the opportunity offers. This imperfect tribute to their valor and endurance is being penned on the forty-ninth Christmas anniversary of that wonderful fight.\n\nDuring his legislative service he introduced the bill making the Rio Grande the boundary line between the two contending countries, which became a law, the \"Neuces\" being the extreme limit that Mexico would either directly or indirectly recognize. It was upon the basis of claim then set up that President Polk, after annexation, ordered troops under General Taylor to the mouth of the first-named river, which\n\nPage 40\n\nresulted in the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca and the war ensuing. That the acquisition of the vast and indispensable territory by the treaty of peace was worth hundreds of times more to the United States than the cost of the war amounted to, is now generally conceded.\n\nOn the eve of annexation he returned to the United States, and shortly after married the widow of John S. Ellery, of Boston, a lady of rare worth and manifold attractions.\n\nFour years later (1849) we find him journeying alone through Mexico, from Vera Cruz to Acapulco, on his way to California, which was just then looming into consequence by reason of large gold discoveries. After working in the mines for a while, he was elected to the first Senate of that State and served out one term, being a prominent candidate for the United States Senate in the ensuing year.\n\nWhile in that State he projected and laid out the towns of Oro and Vallejo, the last for a while the recognized capital, and both now places of considerable repute. During his citizenship in Texas he, in connection with Dr. Archer and the Whartons, had purchased and laid out Velasco at the mouth of the Brazos, now of recognized importance, owing to recent deepening of water on the bars.\n\nDuring his sojourn in California he was made major-general of her militia and sent with an adequate force to suppress Indian disturbances in the interior, which was done. But a greater work was the defeat of what was known as the \"Divorce Bill\" in that first Legislature, which authorized absolute separation upon mutual request of man and wife. Unless mistaken, this infamous measure, making marriage a practical nullity, had passed the House and was about to be brought up in the Senate, with every indication of an almost unanimous vote, if taken on that day. At the time, there being few women in the State, the far-reaching and pernicious effects were not duly weighed and considered. Senators\n\nPage 41\n\nGreen and McDougall (afterwards Governor and United States Senator) were amongst the very few in opposition to the measure; but they were earnest, and, after exhausting all the devices of parliamentary strategy possible, succeeded in postponing a vote, thereby defeating the measure.\n\nDuring the same session he introduced and had passed a bill for the establishment of a State University, which has grown to be one of the most flourishing and best endowed schools on the continent. That world-renowned scholar, Professor Daniel C. Gilman, was called from its presidency to fill the same position in the Johns Hopkins University, which he has done in a way to elicit the admiration and astonishment of the scholastic world.\n\nThe reader will, I trust, pardon a personal reminiscence in this connection of the narrative. Shortly after Mr. Polk's inauguration as President, General Green returned to the United States, and taking me, then a small boy, with him, repaired to the Hermitage and passed the greater part of the day with his old and honored friend, ex-President Jackson. It was a visit ever to be remembered. Although but six short weeks intervened between that day and the one that saw him borne to the corner of his garden for interment, his old-time vigor of expression and enthusiasm seemed in nowise abated. The old hero had himself lifted out of bed, and whilst sitting upright in an easy chair, entered warmly into conversation with his visitor upon the current topics of the day, upon men and upon horses. Upon the question of Texan annexation he said: \"Let me live to see it, and I can truly say 'Let Thy servant depart in peace.'\" As we were leaving, he arose with an effort, and placing his hand upon my head gave me his blessing.\n\nSome four and forty years thereafter, almost to the day antedating dissolution, it was my singular good fortune to have been present at the death-bed, as it were, of another\n\nPage 42\n\npatriot hero, sage, and statesman. Some six weeks before his death, and by his invitation, I passed three or four days with ex-President Davis in his quiet and lovely retreat of \"Beauvoir.\" It was indeed a personal privilege to have seen and heard those two immortal men at the same stage of their sunset. In grand heroic qualities they were of kindred type, and cast in kindred mould. Self-reliant conviction, and devotion to conviction pedestaled on high principles, was the ruling trait of each. It was the ruling trait of Cæsar, and, in lesser degree, of Cromwell, of Frederic, and of Napoleon. Coupled with high genius, and the hero is the inevitable outcome.\n\nIn those two old men I see, and methinks posterity will see, the two most pronounced and Titanic figures of this country during the century. But a truce to digression, and return to our subject. That he was the friend of such, and of Calhoun and Albert Sidney Johnston, is a no mean letter of credit of itself.\n\nDuring the pending annexation negotiations he was tendered by Mr. Polk's administration the post of confidential agent in that matter, but declined on the ground that he was then a citizen of the other contracting power. Later on, he was indirectly offered by President Pierce another important diplomatic appointment, but again requested that his name might not be sent to the Senate.\n\nIn his declining years he returned to his native county and settled on a plantation on Shocco Creek, known as \"Esmeralda,\" and passed his remaining days in the cultivation of corn and tobacco, old friendships and old-fashioned hospitality. He had long foreseen and foretold as inevitable the great political crisis which resulted in the clash of arms between the sections in 1861. Whilst devoutly attached to \"the Union of the Constitution,\" nevertheless, when he saw the trend of events and could deduce therefrom but the one alternative of sectional domination or sectional assertion, he did\n\n\"ESMARALDA\"\n\nIn Warren County, North Carolina, my residence until final removal hence to Tokay Vineyard, Cumberland County, where I still reside.\n\nPage 43\n\nnot hesitate which to espouse. In fact, he may be said to have been what few now are willing to confess themselves to have been - an \"original secessionist,\" a secessionist per se. He reasoned that the solution of the dread question \"by wager of battle\" was unavoidable, and each recurring census told him that the longer it was deferred, the worse it would be for the assertive and weaker side. The unceasing regret of his latter days, and hastening cause of his death, was that when the mighty crisis came he was debarred by chronic disease (the gout) from taking part.\n\nHe died, as some have said, from a broken heart, sequent upon a succession of disasters in 1863, including Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Port Hudson, and operations incident to these last.\n\nHe died on the 12th of December, 1863, and was buried in his garden whilst the writer was a prisoner of war on Johnson's Island.\n\nIn manner he was suave, gentle and polite, although strangers might have thought him a little brusque. In form and feature, one of the finest specimens of physical manhood ever seen. Simple and straightforward in his bearing and intercourse with all, he loathed duplicity and hypocrisy in others. Especially did he hold in unutterable abhorrence vulgar upstart pretension and pretenders, whether of the purse-proud, official, or any other variety, mattered naught. Had he made accumulation and money-making the primary object of life, he had died wealthy, for few ever had such opportunities.\n\nThis poor notice of a pronounced and historic character and gallant gentleman cannot be more fittingly closed than by an excerpt from an address of a gifted young friend, Mr. Tasker Polk, of Warrenton, North Carolina:\n\n\"Among all her illustrious sons of the past, there is not one at the shrine of whose memory Warren County looks with greater love and reverence than at that of General Thomas J. Green. He was generous to a fault, noble and grand, fiery\n\nPage 44\n\nand impulsive; heard the Texan cry for freedom, left a home of luxury, sought the field where blood like water flowed, and unsheathed his sword in defense of a stranger land, nor sheathed it till that land was freed. The cry of the oppressed reached his ear, and was answered by his unselfish heart - that heart which gave the first beat of life 'neath Warren's sky.\n\n\"Bravely and gallantly he fought. His blood stained the plains and broad prairies of Texas, the cause for which he fought triumphed, the \"Lone Star State\" was saved from Mexican persecution, and his chivalric nature was satisfied. Years passed, but the memory of old Warren still remained fresh in his mind.\n\n\"He returned to spend the remainder of his illustrious life among his people, and many yet there are who remember with pleasure how 'Esmeralda's' door, whether touched by hand of rich or poor, ever swung on the hinges of hospitality.\"\n\nPage 45\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTo return from this digression. We reached Nashville two hours later, and, after a week's delay, continued on north by steamboat, stopping over in Louisville a few days. At that time and place was being held a religious council, conference, convocation, or whatever the appropriate designation may be, which was pregnant with most momentous consequences a little later on.\n\nIt was beyond my ken to grasp its import at the time. My father did, and remarked to me, when the decision was announced dividing the great Methodist Church into two bodies on sectional lines:\n\n\"That, my son, is the entering wedge which is destined to split this Union asunder and to deluge the country in blood. Yankee bigotry, impudence, and numerical count with each recurring census, have long held the hellish purpose in contemplation, and only bides the odds that cowardice demands to set about its execution. Whilst it will prove (whatever the issue) the greatest calamity that ever befell a free people, nevertheless, if they will have it, let it come, and the sooner for us the better, owing to the aforesaid census-taker of succeeding decades.\"\n\nWas he a prophet?\n\nThe question at issue on that grave occasion, as it recurs after a lapse of intervening years, involved the right of a bishop of that persuasion holding slaves, whether hereditary bondsmen or otherwise. The verdict rendered on that occasion by that oracular body was reproof, reprimand, insult, not only to that high dignitary, but to every subordinate canonical who might aspire to that high pinnacle. Nay, more; the vile insult reached out by implication and included every member of the laity who was or might be possessor of\n\nPage 46\n\na \"chattel in black,\" either by ancestral devise or by purchase from New England \"negro-traders,\" ab initio, or later on. Every other church, except two, I believe, soon followed the pernicious example set.\n\nThus, these in alliance with a cackling flock of fussy old maids, some in petticoats and some in breeches, with a lot of old Congressional emasculates thrown in for seasoning, was set a-boiling this hell broth of brotherly hate, which required sulphur and saltpetre, and most plethoric supplies of the combination, to tone it down. Moral: Let the church or churches attend to legitimate duties, and let extraneous ones severely alone; let the class of nondescript sex just named forswear political meetings as above their reach and comprehension; let them stay at home and rock the cradle, not of home-production contents, which nature, with wise forethought, has denied that unfortunate class, but let them borrow of their more fortunate neighbors. The advice is well meant, and if adopted will keep that whole tribe out of political pow-wows and caterwaulings, and check their insatiate and insane craving for notoriety. Let us give gratitude that our section is not favorable to such noxious, hermaphroditic, fungus growth.\n\nIn due time - that is, about four times what it now takes - the Federal Capital was reached. Barring the public buildings, which were even then creditable to a new country, despite later-on comparisons, when they stand, as to-day, the finest in the world, the city of Washington gave little promise of its subsequent marvellous development. Muddy and unpaved streets, dwellings and stores of common structure and two or three stories in height, vacant lots almost reaching out to the dignity of corn-fields, sloshy crossings between streets! A sluggish, murky creek ran, or rather crept, through the town, euphemistically or derisively called \"The Tiber.\" Garbage heaps and cesspools there were on all hands. Such was a most uninviting village, as seen by me and the snob Dickens\n\nPage 47\n\nmuch about the same time. It was about midway between this day and the one on which President Washington and his French protege, L'Enfant, first began work on the metropolis that was to be, half a century intervening.\n\nWhat a contrast between the straggling village and the city of to-day! What a contrast between then and now! Except in numbers, rivaling the proudest capitals in the world to-day in grandeur and magnificence, and suggesting those of ancient fame on the banks of the Tiber and Tigris. What it is destined to be at the middle of the dawning century baffles the imagination and \"must give us pause.\" For the past last half its growth and artistic development have kept pace with the material progress of the country, which, until lately, was bounded by oceans on every cardinal side save one, until in an evil hour, lust for more land and imperial sway made oceans far too contracted for our boundary lines. The \"mad sons\" of Macedon and Corsica were actuated by the same boundless outreach of desire. May not republics profit by the outlined warnings of tyrants and would-be all-ruling and out-reaching despots, wearers of purple and crowns though they be? Our tribe are mighty good imitators on that line, as is now being developed.\n\nIt has been said that only three men in recorded history have essayed the task of building a big city by systematic plan and method, who succeeded in the undertaking. These, I believe, are Alexander, Constantine, and Peter of Russia, each of whom left a monument behind adding to the immortality of its builder, whose name it bore. Here stands catalogued a fourth! Each was built by the pride of men, by subsidies and largess out of the public coffers.\n\nWhile I was in Washington I was introduced by my father to President Polk and most of his cabinet, as well as to numerous prominent gentlemen in both houses of Congress, amongst them being Hon. Robert J. Walker, Secretary of the Treasury,\n\nPage 48\n\nwho, by common consent of most competent judges, is held to be the ablest financier who has ever held that high position. Ten years later he did me the honor to take me in his law office as junior associate with himself and Mr. Louis Janin in the capital city, having just been admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nFrom Washington the journey was continued to Ridgeway, North Carolina, to make the acquaintance of my paternal grandmother, then eighty years of age. This venerable lady impressed one from the start as one born to command, and such was the reputation that tradition gave her, after raising a dozen full-grown boys and girls. Her right to command was recognized of all, and most of all by the old campaigner who had just returned after a ten-years runaway. I am persuaded that in the even tenor of her way she instilled a wholesome respect for petticoat government on all of her immediate offspring, omitting not a progenitor of the masculine gender, who enjoyed the singular felicity of being my grandfather. And yet she was a very little woman.\n\nHere I remained for the next few months, studying Spanish under my father's old prison-mate, Captain Dan Henrie, and indulging my fondness for miscellaneous reading, besides getting acquainted with my paternal kindred, none of whom were previously known. As a rule, they turned out to be, like those on the maternal side of the house, a very creditable connection. Then returned to Washington and passed the winter at the old \"United States Hotel,\" at the time one of the best caravansaries in the city, but in the march of subsequent progress now difficult to find. It stood on Pennsylvania avenue, near Four-and-a-half street.\n\nDuring that time I had for room-mate one of the most remarkable men of his age, Dr. Branch T. Archer, to whom allusion has already been made. He was the admitted first instigator to revolt against Mexican tyranny in the newly\n\nPage 49\n\nfledged commonwealth (Texas), and that in a town garrisoned by a thousand Mexican soldiery. He had sent out circulars to every American settler, within a radius of thirty miles, to be on hand at appointed time with rifle and bowie knife. Some three or four dozen of the sturdy fellows were there to meet him. In burning words he told of the wrongs and outrages to which the young colony had been subjected by irresponsible satraps and their minions, and appealed to their Anglo-Saxon manhood to rise on the spot and put an end to the crying shame of white men longer submitting to the sway of mongrels and mulattoes.\n\nHis words went home, the little band rose to a man, and killed, captured or expelled the entire garrison, and Texas thence on was to all intents a free, sovereign and independent State. Never was more daring experiment tried by a single man for grander purpose. It might aptly be termed a single handed hero lynching a Regiment, or rather, as results prove, an Empire, and for the only cause that justifies lynching. Let Horatius take a back seat. Fearless as he was by nature, he could but realize the apparent foolhardiness of the venture, and had a fine thoroughbred saddled and ready at hand in case his appeal failed to strike fire. Strike it did, and won for him the proud title which he ever wore, and wears, of \"Father of the Texan Revolution.\" Gentle and kind-hearted he was to a degree; but proud, haughty, and punctilious to a fine point, in the face of unwarranted and arrogant assumption. He was, on the whole, a sort of living embodiment of Lever's inimitable character, Count Considine, barring his superior culture and refinement. He and my father had been for long like twin brothers, living under the same roof, and the love he bore the father was naturally continued to the son. His society was ever more congenial to me than that of younger persons of more suitable years. Although he could\n\nPage 50\n\nhave had the entree to any society at the capital, I was vain enough to think that he preferred mine, as I did his.\n\nIn one of the evening chats over the fire, conversation leading thereto, he remarked with much feeling:\n\n\"Jackson, never step on any man's toes; but be equally careful, my boy, that no man steps on yours. It has been my rule of conduct through life, and I have never regretted it.\"\n\nThe remark is given for a purpose. In earlier manhood he had a close kinsman and bosom-friend, though differing in politics. In an evil hour a deadly insult was passed, which only blood could atone. With high attainments, keen sense of honor, and blood the bluest of the blue, it was well understood that one or the other had to die. Dr. Archer, as was well known, made every possible effort to avert the inevitable, even apologizing on \"the field\" and imploring his kinsman to pause and consider. The first shot settled all difficulties, and some there were who felt inclined to envy the man who had caught the bullet, for thence on the other was rarely known to smile; and yet it is hard to believe that the conscience of the survivor reproached him for what was done. The remark given above is in support of that conviction. The necessity of the act, doubtless, embittered his subsequent life, \"grand, gloomy, and peculiar\" as it was.\n\nSuch was the man whom my father selected for my mentor at a most impressionable period of young life, while he was in New York superintending the publication of his book, \"The Mier Expedition.\" I honored him then, and honor him now, for one of the bravest, straightest and brainiest gentlemen whom it has been my good fortune to know. Perhaps he was not a shining light, according to the modern acceptation of the term. He could not have made his million or millions, for the simple reason that he despised superfluous wealth and its possessors, and was essentially a high type of God's noblest handiwork - an honest man. It was\n\nPage 51\n\nnot in him to attain high political preferment, because he would have scorned policy as too near akin to falsehood or subterfuge. \"He would not flatter Neptune for his trident, or Jove for his power to thunder\"; far be it from pot-house politicians and self-constituted village Warwicks. His was a plane far above the reach of such things as these.\n\nUpon Dr. Archer's departure I was transferred to a boarding-house nearly opposite (a Mrs. Porter, unless mistaken), mainly taken up by members of Congress without their families. One of these kept a sort of supervisory outlook over me, at my father's request. He was then in the prime of life, about thirty-seven years of age, and a widower - a new member, and comparatively unknown. Before two decades had rolled around, his name and fame were resounding around the world. He was my friend then, as he was ever after. More of him further on. Suffice it now that his name was Davis.\n\nIt should have been said that before quitting the United States Hotel I had been brought to know one of the most remarkable men - it is needless to add greatest, when his name is called - of this or any preceding century. Mr. and Mrs. Calhoun had rooms on the same floor, and only two or three doors from ours. With loving womanly impulse, the good lady took me in hand and would have me in her parlor every evening or two, whilst her grand husband would be looking over his papers. Notwithstanding the weighty matters with which he was always burthened, he usually found time during the course of my stay to address a few kindly remarks to me, and yet he was, as I have since learned, the biggest man in the world. Intercourse with others of high kindred nature has led up to the conclusion that simplicity is ever one of the predominant attributes of the loftiest natures. Reading and reflection confirm the conclusion.\n\nIn the galaxy of immortals with whom it has been my\n\nPage 52\n\nproud privilege to be brought into casual contact, and the friendship of some of whom I have enjoyed, I place unhesitatingly the last two, Calhoun and Davis, as easily first in profundity of political thought and lucidity of expression and inculcation. Their great preceptor, Jefferson, was, of course, the equal of either, as he was the superior of all their predecessors in these high attributes. Patriotism, purity of life, and self-abnegation at the mandate of principle, were the other crowning life jewels in the two I knew. Of course, the estimate formed of these illustrious men is derived from subsequent reading and reflection. Their teachings and monitions have been the political vade mecum of my life. Jackson and Calhoun constituted, beyond a doubt, as long as it lasted, the strongest and most marked presidential combination that the country has ever known, each conspicuous for strong, unbending will-power and native intellect of the highest order, the last but partially cultivated in the first, but carried to a pitch of refinement and absolute governmental brain culture in the other. It is not strange that it proved an incongruous and ill-assorted team, in spite of the superlatives ascribed to each. Paramount intellect and lofty patriotism were neutralized by unyielding self-will in both, greatly to the cost of constitutional government ever since. Calhoun was superseded and set aside - tell it not in Gath, publish it not in Askelon - by Martin Van Buren, as successor.\n\nSuch is my deliberate estimate of those last two great moulders of political thought, John C. Calhoun and Jefferson Davis (omitting Thomas Jefferson), whom over-cultured and dogmatic New England would fain consign to the lumber-room of political failures. Possibly, in the thousand years to follow, that complacent section may be able by strenuous effort to evolve one such. So far, she and her congeners have not approximated in production either of the immortal triumvirate of political thinkers and teachers. Nay, more: it is\n\nPage 53\n\ndoubtful whether Old England, in her palmiest period, the closing half of the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth century, can furnish such a historical parallel of transcendent genius in the most exalted field of intellectual development. This marvelous outcrop, of itself, should forever shame and silence the scoffs and sneers of witlings and fools as to the demoralizing effects of African slavery on the moral and intellectual outcome of the ruling race - stereotyped absurdity of assinine assumption and self-satisfied stupidity.\n\nIn Mr. Davis the world recognizes the efficient actor, as well as the profound thinker - the grandest Revolutionist of all time, according to the Honorable Mr. Roebuck in the House of Commons.\n\nIt was no mean privilege to have had this grand man for friend in my boyhood days, and to have that friendship continue to the end of his life. As proof of this, he bequeathed me his ink-stand as memento in the closing hours of his well-rounded life. From its sable contents were transmitted to paper the emanations of his glorious soul. It is a priceless heirloom to me, as I trust it will be to my grandson and his. The best wish that can go with it is that he and they, in succession, may take the donor for model and exemplar, and make their lives conform as near to his in aim and lofty aspiration as may be. Let it be a stimulus ever to noble effort.\n\nPage 54\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nIn the early part of 1846 I was entered at my first boarding school, Georgetown College (now University). From the first it was evident that the strict monastic rule and ritual of that institution did not comport to my taste and the genius of a peculiar constitution. And yet, at the expiration of six months, I was very summarily transferred therefrom by paternal mandate in apprehension that a longer continued stay might lead to counter-bias, to the point, in fact, of becoming a novitiate in the noble order of Loyola. Looking back, after the lapse of time, methinks his apprehensions were entirely groundless.\n\nBe that as it may, the \"governor\" (if the Lord will forgive me the use, for the first and last time, of the low, vulgar, slang expression of mannish young America as applied to the author of their being) was scared, and issued unmistakable orders to \"pack up my traps and get out of that den of Jesuits.\" The order was most acceptable, and was obeyed with alacrity. It is written, the school was not to my liking. In justice to the school, and in perfect candor, it must be confessed that after sampling some half a dozen others, it was not my good fortune to acquire a hankering for any.\n\nPossibly my rough initiation in the rudimentary branches of education, to which allusion was made in passing, is mainly responsible for deep-seated antipathy to pedants, pundits, and high scholastics later on. Of course, such a confession is discreditable, but it is honest truth, and that passes, without question, as better far than a gilded lie. In extenuation, will add that, whilst an enforced curriculum of cut-and-dried textbooks went ever against the grain, I have, nevertheless, been through life an unremitting student and investigator, based on solid, not superficial, research, history and its concomitants -\n\nPage 55\n\nbiography, travel, essays, memoirs, approved poetry, and an occasional dip, by way of interlude and recreation, into the great romancers of the stature of Thackeray (greatest of them all), Scott, Fielding, Boccacio, Cervantes, Bulwer, Dickens, Lever, George Eliot, Hawthorne, Poe, Lesage, Cooper, and a few others of kindred calibre, not forgetting dear old Miss Porter of blessed juvenile days. Of course, the list would be incomplete if it did not embrace the old, now almost unread English classics. Some of these must needs come in. What? Leave out \"The Vicar\" and \"Rasselas\"? Why, I would as soon leave out Colonel Esmond, Colonel Newcome, Captain Shandy, the old convict in Les Miserables, or Captain Crusoe. Have rarely taken much stock in the so-called \"current literature of the day,\" unless kidnapped into something of the sort by my good wife, who is not only the best woman in the world in all other respects, but one of the most omnivorous readers and judicious critics whom I have ever known. \"Just let me read you a page,\" she begins, and that always means the book. Have gotten much mighty good reading that way.\n\nThere was drilled into my noddle at school, or rather schools, the usual amount of stereotyped pedagogic pabulum, including the preliminary classics and higher mathematics, belles-lettres, ethics, political economy, French, and the law courses, etc. Upon such an incongruous foundation it was mine to build the superstructure of an imperfect education, after closing the academic doors behind. That there were glorious opportunities neglected shall not be denied, but that there were shoals that were shunned can be truly claimed.\n\nAfter being given the whole scope of schools from which to make choice, and tried many, too many, it can be truthfully said that whilst rarely classed amongst the \"first mite men\" in any study, having by instinct a no exalted estimate of college honors, I, nevertheless, escaped with but slight attaint or\n\nPage 56\n\nsuspicion of college contamination, and ever of low or unworthy association. This last I have tried to keep up through life.\n\nNeither dicer nor drinker did I learn to be in that ordeal period of life, although inducements were not wanting. For the last I have ever felt the keenest pity. For the other class (yclept, the gambler) loathing and scorn, far surpassing that entertained for the \"gentleman-highwayman.\" Nor is such contempt confined to the \"professional,\" the sleight-of-hand man who is up to little tricks, like slipping a card up the sleeve, or loaded cubes accessible. The thimble-rigging fraternity is but the parent stock of a kindred class a thousand times more baneful and pernicious, the light-fingered brother who can on the Stock Exchange despoil thousands to swell his plethoric horde of millions. Yes! give us bold Turpin every time to the wheedling rogue, who mercilessly despoils widows, orphans and confiding friends by superior sharp practice. This class may have its utility in the public weal, just as the small-fry jeremy-diddler, the centipede, the vampire, and the bed-bug may have in the animal economy, but there are some folks who cannot exactly see it.\n\nRecurring to foregone estimate of college honors, the subsequent may as well be here premised. From candid statement here given, and further to follow, it can hardly be inferred that I have ever set undue value on such puerilities, or kindred trivialities later on, all of which, at the turning-point of \"life's fitful dream,\" have been, and are still, held in due subordination. Reason for contempt of academic laurels has already been forecast in part, viz., instinctive repugnance to pedagogic tyranny and assinine assumption on the part of the wielders of the ferule, both of high and low degree. Perhaps, the feeling was intensified by comparison oft-times between the winner of school-boy honors in the curriculum\n\nPage 57\n\nand the champion of those later on in the hard tussle of actual life.\n\nPerchance such sentiments may be deemed heterodox and ill-advised, especially by those of the professor-torial fraternity, whose name is legion, beginning with the old-time dominie, puffed up with a little brief authority, and the learned Doctor Profundus LL.D., of the University of all the Ologies. Professors all they are to-day, from the imp who shines your boots to the other artist who lathers your face. The learned Porson was nothing more!\n\nI believed then, and know now, that in natural ability I was the match, and more, of most of my school-mates, but realize, in looking backwards and taking a retrospective glance over the sad field of \"might-have-beens,\" both then and since, that many of them possessed an attribute far more essential in the long race, known as stability, as contradistinguished from ability. Bear it in mind ever, O son, both in the class-room and in the far more important struggle to follow.\n\nFather Æsop was right in one of the many instructive stories he tells - the one about the foot-race between the tortoise and the hare. Slow-plodding perseverance is almost sure to tell against rabbit-foot, if not in a quarter race, in the elongated life race, which is most unerring test of \"bottom.\" Stick to stability, and cultivate \"bottom,\" my boy, if you would win success in life's handicap or the globe-trotter's merry-go- round. Or if you are of sporting proclivities, back the terrapin every time for his staying qualities - slow, but sure. Close observation has led unerringly to that conclusion, despite celerity and scintillation of start on the part of competitors.\n\nAlthough laying only moderate claim to \"Molly Hare's\" facility of getting over ground, it will nevertheless be borne in mind that a modest arrogance has been set up on claim of average ability. And yet in the metaphorical scrub-race referred\n\nPage 58\n\nto, candor compels the admission that I have seen the veriest mud-turtles, creepers and crawlers, give me the go-by and grasp the puny prizes most excitant to mundane effort and emulation. And so, if you would carry off the \"Grand Prix,\" my boy, on which your heart is set, be it professional or political fame, accumulation of useless horde, or sublime official head of \"My Lord High Executioner,\" or, descending from the sublime to the ridiculous, \"My Lord High Village Patronizer,\" who, like inflated Malvolio's \"I extend my hand to him thus\" (every little town has one such factotum), exulting in the serenity of his sublimity. Young man, whichever of these Himalayan altitudes you propose to climb, follow the recipe here enjoined, and you will be apt to reach it, be it the pinnacle of President or patronizer or moneyed potentate. First, make deliberate selection of the cloud-capped summit you would scale, and then fix an eye single on the topmost peak, and go for it with the tortoise for exemplar. Crawl and creep, and on occasion cringe, and you will get there.\n\nJAMACIA PLAINS.\n\nNear Boston. The residence of my first wife, Esther Sargent Ellery.\n\nPage 59\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nIn the latter part of the last-named year, or, to be precise, on the twenty-fourth day of October, 1846, occurred an event which has had the most material and important bearing on all my subsequent life. On that day my father was married to his second wife, Mrs. Adeline Ellery, of Boston. She was the widow of John S. Ellery, of that city, who was one of the most successful business men of his day. A woman of remarkably fine personal appearance, and of the kindliest, gentlest nature that I have almost ever known. For eight and thirty years thereafter, she was my mother, not only in name, but in maternal love and all else, barring the ties of nature. She was ever indulgent to the follies and foibles of her self-willed step-son, and ever ready with motherly judicious counsel. The only compensation in my power was paid to the full, - in filial affection to this noble woman.\n\nAlthough much given to society, her charity was universal and unbounded, but not always judicious. While of ample means, her pension list was ever disproportionate to income, and yet she was not a religionist in the ordinary acceptation of the term. Such as it was, I would not exchange it for that of the Sorbonne or an ordinary Consistory or College of Cardinals.\n\nShe and my father were almost of the same age (forty-four), and of remarkable congeniality of tastes. Most of the time was passed in travel and at hotels. They were a remarkably fine-looking couple, and always moved in highest circles, not of the dollar-and-cent variety as standard.\n\nThe wedding took place in Grace Church, New York, Rev. Dr. Taylor officiating. By inadvertence or oversight, the stereotyped head-lines of the modern newspaperial chronicler are omitted, to-wit, 'the large and fashionable audience ' 'the\n\nPage 60\n\ngrande marche from Hohenzollern and hautboys,' and ushers of the blackrod, and all of the other et ceteras and concomitants on such occasions essential. Any village newspaper nowadays can supply such material and all-important omissions.\n\nA gawky country lad of fifteen can hardly be thought to have been \"an fait\" in dilettante literature of this high order over half a century ago. All that comes back now is that the aforesaid lad and a sweet, spoilt little blonde girl of seven walked just behind the high contracting parties, as quasi \"consentors and givers-away.\" Ten or twelve years later on the performance was repeated, but the performers were reversed, - the boy and girl taking the leading roles. Each was an only child.\n\nBetween the two weddings I saw little of the family thus augmented, except for brief space at long intervals. A child was the result of the first marriage a year or so later, but died in infancy; and so there was no additional connecting link between the little girl and the boy until the second event came on, each being much over-spoilt by respective step-parent, the girl especially by hers. If she had been his own flesh and blood, he could not have indulged her more. Every wish, whim and caprice had to be gratified, regardless of consequences. The result, as might have been foreseen, was a very deficient and imperfect education, with a no hesitating assertion of self-will in dealing with others. How she and I got along as well as we did in after life can only be explained upon the principle of mutual forbearance and concession, superinduced in each by the recognized necessity of it.\n\nI was fully conscious that she had been gratified and indulged to the extreme limit, and felt the propriety of its continuance in all rational regards, believing then, as I do now, that she loved me with her full and entire heart. As illustration of this, let it be mentioned to her eternal credit\n\nPage 61\n\nthat when the immediate forecast of coming events pointed, unmistakably, to war between the States, she urged her husband to obey the call of duty and his sense of honor in espousing side, clearly giving him to understand that in her belief he had resolved on the right course. She further proclaimed her willingness to put up with plantation provision as long as he could remain in camp.\n\nBut two or three years later on came the supremest test of inborn truth and wifely devotion. On the eve of the mightiest of all conflicts precaution was taken to retain two or three of the very ablest lawyers in Boston to look after her interests and guard against the possibilities of confiscation. In the latter part of 1864, while a prisoner of war on Johnson's Island, I received what might be construed into a conjoint letter from these three distinguished and most worthy gentlemen, in effect as follows: \"Urge your wife to come on at once, if you wish to stave off threatened, if not imminent, danger.\" Well I knew the portent of that dread message, but followed the wiser course, as it turned out, in responding - submitted it to my little wife.\n\nConscious I was that her rejoiner would be in accord with my desire, as it proved. It was to all intents, slightly amplified, that of the lovely and poetic Ruth - \"His people shall be my people,\" etc., and \"we'll live on hog and hominy awhile longer whilst patriot heroes are battling for their rights.\" The grandeur of her resolve rises into the moral sublime, when it is stated that it was taken entirely of her own volition and that the estate involved was close to a half-million dollars and, as I learned later, proceedings of confiscation had actually been begun, which, through the instrumentality of my honored friends, General Caleb Cushing, Judge Levi Woodbury, and Hon. Benjamin Dean, were continued from term to term, and never reached judgment until it was too late for it to be rendered.\n\nPage 62\n\nAn anecdote leading up to this result may, perchance, be introduced further on. Let it be added, that all this while she was like all of her neighbors practically destitute of the commonest comforts, if not necessaries, of life, such as tea, coffee, sugar, salt, calico, etc. Such was the outlook on the plantation! Ease and affluence and boundless luxury across the Potomac!\n\nWithout my knowledge she had previously disposed of her wedding jewels in order to bridge over pressing necessities and make both ends meet at home, whilst extending a helping hand to her still more needy friends and neighbors. All this was done in the seclusion of quiet country life, and without the slightest attempt at parade or ostentation. It may well be questioned whether in those dark days of long suffering by our brave, noble, heroic women, any bore the inevitable hardships of the dread ordeal more uncomplainingly than she; and yet she was, as it then stood, of foreign and hostile lineage, inured to all the comforts and luxuries of life, within her reach at any time to resume. If marital veto had been interposed, ground would have been broken for ninety-and-nine full-fledged divorce suits in the regions of thoughtless marriage and loose morals.

It was then one of the most flourishing schools in the South. Mr. Lovejoy was a ripe scholar, supported by competent assistants, a worthy man in the main, and a rigid disciplinarian of the 'old school.' It was an unseemly boast of his that he had never promised a boy or a full-fledged man, of whom there were many under his sway, a flagellation without inflicting it, and tradition of the boys bore him out. There was one boy, however, to whom that promise was unfulfilled; he very courteously told the promising party that he had for long had a lurking suspicion that in his day and generation he had been the recipient of an overplus of the extract of birch, and did not propose to take another dose. Am glad to say the good man held a restraining hand.\n\nIt may thus be surmised that too much congeniality of temperament was not conducive to long protracted relationship. Still there was a sort of mutual forbearance maintained for a year and a half, when another transfer took place, this time, to a select preparatory school four miles from Boston, Massachusetts, kept by Mr. Ste"
