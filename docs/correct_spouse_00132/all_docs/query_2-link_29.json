        "text": "My sister’s sister-in-law, Ann, is the queen of cookies. I’m lucky to be one of her guinea pigs for her new recipes. I’ve tasted countless chocolate chip cookies – the winner being the recipe with brown butter and sea salt. But last night she brought four batches of my fave cookie, the snickerdoodle, for us to taste. The winner was the one with white chocolate chips and the highest amount of cinnamon.\n\nFor me, the brilliance of the snickerdoodle is a very cinnamon forward taste, with a crunchy exterior and a luscious, chewy interior. Ann told us what gives the snickerdoodle both its traditional tanginess and its chewiness is cream of tartar. And inclusion of this magic ingredient is what separates a standard sugar cookie from a snickerdoodle. As an acidulant, tartaric acid has a taste that is naturally sour and gives food sharp, tart flavors.\n\nCream of tartar, also known as tartaric acid is an acidic regulator in food systems. It enhances fruit flavors and stabilizes batter systems and color. Its particularly known to stabilize whipped egg whites or meringue. It also prevents sugar systems from crystallizing, and is a leavener. It’s part of the two ingredient system of baking powder, which includes it and baking soda. The tartaric acid neutralizes the bitterness of baking soda, but allows it’s leavening super powers to unfold. If you don’t have Cream of Tartar, equivalent substitutes are lemon juice or buttermilk.\n\nThe chemical name of tartaric acid is dihydroxybutanedioic acid. It was first isolated in 1769 by a German born chemist in Sweden by the name of Carl Wilhelm Scheele. Scheele was born in Pomerania, in the northwest corner of the Germanic kingdoms that is now part of Poland. Although winemakers knew about tartaric acid for centuries as a biproduct of fermentation of the grape, he was the first to develop a technique to extract the crystalline organic acid chemically.\n\nScheele is an obscure chemist, never given full credit for all his work. His most famous discovery was oxygen, which he called “fire-air” because it helped in combustion. The problem was another scientist beat him to the printer and wrote about it before he could. As it turns out he was the Jan to many scientific Marshas who took credit for the work he did. He went on to discover six elements – barium, chlorine, molybdenum, manganese, nitrogen and tungsten. British chemist Sir Humphrey Davy took credit for chlorine and barium. Peter Jacob Hjelm took credit for molybdenum.\n\nScheele was known to taste and smell his experiments, and as a result he died prematurely in his forties in 1786, the official cause of death, mercury poisoning. On his deathbed, Scheele married the widow of the town’s drugstore, who was his ‘housekeeper’ so she could inherit the pharmacy. He has a statue in Sweden erected in his honor and a poisonous pigment with his name.\n\nThe one legacy given to Scheel is a poisonous compound known as Scheele’s Green, that over the years has killed untold number of people, including perhaps Napoleon. Scheele’s Green is a yellow-green pigment that was used to dye paper, wallpaper, cotton, linen, and some children’s toys. It is a compound of the super-poisonous arsenic. Back in his day, the toxicity of arsenic was not known, so people used his pigment in wallpapers in their rooms, ladies’ dresses, newspaper ads. During Napoleon’s exile in St. Helena, he resided in a house with rooms painted bright green, his favorite color. Although he died of stomach cancer, arsenic exposure is known to increase the risk of gastric carcinoma. And analysis of samples of Napoleon’s hair revealed significant amounts of arsenic.\n\nI spent a good portion of last week in the Florence, Erlanger, Ft. Wright, area of Northern Kentucky. I noticed a new chicken chain, Guthrie’s, who was clucking their tenders to the market. Having never heard of them, I thought I had to find out their story. In the midst of the Fast Food Fried Chicken Sandwich wars, a new local entrant is an important data point.\n\nAs it turns out, they make the claim for inventing the American fast food chicken finger in 1978. Their catchy little motto is “Golden Fried since ‘65”. Chick-fil-A, by the way, claims they invented the fast food fried chicken sandwich. Hal Guthrie is the founder and opened his first drive through restaurant in Haleyville, Alabama in 1965. In 1978 he announced to his wife that they were going to start serving chicken fingers at their restaurant.\n\nHal knew he needed a phenom dippin’ sauce to go with his unique breading, so he initiated a contest with his three kids for the best sauce. His son Hud won the contest and made restaurant industry history by inventing what is now the standard Southern chicken sauce that is the basis for Raising Cane’s sauce, Zaxby’s Zax Sauce, and Chick-fil-A sauce. That formula is basically ketchup, mayo, worchestershire sauce, garlic and herbs. It’s a close sibling to Mississippi’s comeback sauce, and a cousin to Louisiana’s remoulade sauce, which has the addition of horseradish and mustard.\n\nConsumption of fast food fried chicken on the bone is in decline in America. Apparently we just don’t have time to sit and pick around a bone. We only have time for bite sized, extruded, randomly shaped ‘nuggets’, or a patty in a bun. Whole muscle chicken fingers offer something a bit more natural than the extruded, mechanically separated chicken. I know it sounds grose. You should watch British chef Jamie Oliver demo the making of mechanically separated chicken fingers to West Virginia kids. They cringe in horror, but still eat the nuggets he made.\n\nIn 1982, Hal’s oldest son Chris, talked Hal into coming to Auburn to help start a Guthrie’s restaurant there. At first they only served hamburgers, steak sandwiches and chicken fingers. But after only a short time they dropped the beef for chicken only. And to the best of their knowledge, this is the first American restaurant that served chicken fingers only.\n\nThe restaurant became a popular college spot and Chris opened more locations in Athens, Georgia, and Tallahassee, Florida; Hal opened in Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Hud in Birmingham and Auburn, and daughter Anna Margaret in Jasper and Haleyville, Alabama.\n\nZach McLeroy was the first to copycat Guthrie’s. He became familiar with the chain while attending University of Georgia. His first Zaxby’s was established in Statesboro, Georgia, in March 1990, near the Georgia Southern University campus. The company’s first restaurant outside of Georgia was opened in September 1994 in Bowling Green, Kentucky. They now lead the chicken finger market with over 900 locations, but they also serve wings, sandwiches and salads.\n\nRaising Cane’s was founded in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1996, by Todd Graves, who had worked at Guthrie’s in college at University of Georgia in Athens, and was the inspiration for his business. He followed the “open near a University” model by locating his first store near LSU. It’s the chicken version of our chili parlors – Unis instead of movie theatres. There are now 570 locations of Raising Cane’s in the U.S., while there are only 40 Guthrie’s locations in Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida.\n\nMost of the burger joints and all the chicken joints have their own chicken strips, but the Chicken War hasn’t advanced onto the strips front. There are now three locations of Guthrie’s in Northern Kentucky – in Ft. Wright, Burlington, and Hebron. The Ft. Wright franchise is owned by Bill Aseere and Michael Ash of the Space Cowboys Restaurant Group. The only location in Ohio is Cleveland.\n\nThere are several bakeries in Cincinnati that make an elevated pop tart. Now there’s a Syrian food stall – Olive Tree – in the new Oakley Kitchen and Food Hall, that makes a Syrian version of our ‘fig’ newton. In this case, though, it’s a date newton. It’s called the ma’amoul and its made by Aleppo, Syrian immigrant Ibtisam Masto. Ma’amoul is a date filled shortbread cookie that is used to break the fast during Eid or Ramandan, the Muslim religious festival that requires fasting from sunup to sundown. These buttery cookies are the perfect reward after a month of fasting during Ramadan or Lent.\n\nMa’amoul, as it’s called in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, goes by kombe in southern Turkey, and as kahk in Egypt. Kahk seems to be the indisputable ancestor of ma’amoul, as it’s depicted in temple paintings and carvings dating to the Pharaonic era. Like ma’amoul in other countries,kahk in Egypt is traditional for both Easter and Eid. But in addition to nut fillings, Egyptians also have versions stuffed withagameya (a honey-walnut concoction) and loukoum (Turkish delight). It has close cousins in the date filled Jewish rugelach, and the Slavic kolache.\n\nMasto and her husband and six children escaped Jisr al-Shughur, a city in northern Syria, after the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2013 and were placed in Cincinnati by the UN Refugee Committee with help from Catholic Charities. Her five youngest kids help at the food stall. Mohammed-Nour, a snarky 11 year old boy adds comic relief to the jovial headscarved sisters Amal and Asmaa, who ring you up at the counter. I’m fond of their Syrian chicken and I’d put their secret recipe Aleppo hot sauce on shoe leather. They need to bottle it and sell it in the hot sauce vending machine at the Oakley Kitchen. I’ve convinced Masto to sell the hot sauce to me in a containter, but she’s not giving up her secret recipe…. yet.\n\nMa’amoul falls into a whole category of foods that survived a war. Members of this club include the currywurst of Berlin after WWII; our own Hanky Panky, amped up from SOS served in canteen kitchens in WWII; the dominostein cookie of Dresden, Germany during WWII; and the franzbrotchen pastry that came out of Napoleonic occupation of Prussian Germany.\n\nSome Syrian bakers make their ma’amoul with both rosewater and orange blossom and fill with walnut and pistachio fillings. Others also add mastic, a sun-dried resin from trees, and mahlab, a spice made from the inner kernels of the St. Lucy cherry pit, to their dough. Mahlab is a unique spice that adds a bit of bitter almond, cherry, floral and vanilla flavors to Mediterranean sweets. In Syria ma’amoul is served alongside strong Arabic coffee and chocolate to guests.\n\nI met Ibtisam in 2016, at the inaugural Stir cooking class, hosted by Kate Zaidan of Mediterranean Imports at Findlay Kitchen. Ibtisam and I were both food demonstrators at the event. A Project Grant from local philanthropic lab People’s Liberty gave Zaidan the kick-start she needed to host a series of six cooking classes in Findlay Kitchen. Our class was titled, Migration and Immigration in Cincinnati. I demonstrated the Germanic immigrant dish goetta and Masto demonstrated her famous kibbeh, which seems to be a cousin of goetta. We bonded over grain sausages.\n\nI highly recommend trying Olive Tree and immersing yourself in a taste of Syria in Cincinnati.\n\nThe modern American candy nougat was invented in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the early 1920s by the Pendergast Candy company. It fills the centers of our favorite American candy bars like the Snickers, Milky Way, and Three Musketeers bars. This new nougat fueled the candy bar wars between World War I and II, producing hundreds of different curiously named candy bars. Nougat originally came from the Mediterranean countries like Italy, borrowed there from Persia and Syria, where honey, nuts, and sometimes candied fruit were beaten into egg whites and then sun dried into a hard, but semi-chewable confection.\n\nThere are two historical types of nougat. The first is called Persian or white nougat. White nougat first appeared in Allicante, Spain in the 15th century, and then in Montelimar, France, in the 18th century. The Montelimar nougat was made famous in the opening line of the 1968 Beatles song, Savoy Truffle, as a chocolate truffle flavor of the famous Mackintosh’s Candy Company.\n\nThe second type of nougat is black nougat, which is made without egg whites and is harder and crunchier than Persian nougat. There are several variations, like Viennese nougat, which has finely ground hazelnuts inside and is what the Germanic and Scandinavian countries think of as nougat. There was one Italian white nougat available at the old Markets International when I was growing up that had pistachios and dried cherries that I thought was the height of class. It was called La Florentine, and had an image of Leonardo da Vinci’s La Belle Ferroniere on the tin. Italian white nougat or torrone, is distinctive because it has citrus added.\n\nIn the 1920s the candy makers at the Pendergast candy company were trying to come up with a manufacturable chewy nougat. They screwed up with the formula and put in too much egg albumin, and the result was not chewy, but a fluffy, airy, puffier nougat. This became known as the Minnesota or Minneapolis nougat, as regional candy makers began copying this fluffy nougat and making new candy bars.\n\nBefore the nougat discovery, Pendergast had decided to call their chewy nougat bar the Emma, which was a popular girl’s name at the time. With the new lighter, fluffier, and bigger nougat, they decided to rename it the Fat Emma. They integrated walnuts into the nougat and the bar became a fave. You would think this was an unfortunate name for marketing, but it became maybe the most licensed candy bar name in American candy bar history.\n\nThe first company they licensed to was the Sanitary Candy Company of St. Paul, Minnesota, which made a 2 oz. Fat Emma for a while. Another license was George Willamson of Chicago, who had invented the O Henry! Bar, a chocolate covered, peanut laced creamy caramel bar. It was named after a boy who came into Williamson’s candy company to flirt with the girl candy dippers. His Fat Emma was the female counterpart to the O Henry, and he even hired a local high school girl to be the spokesmodel. The Sperry Candy Company of Milwaukee made a Fat Emma bar for a while in the 1930s. And it even made it across the northern border to London, Ontario, Canada, where McCormick’s Candy Company made a Fat Emma bar from 1927-1939.\n\nFrank Mars saw the potential, and in Minneapolis at the time, introduced his Milky Way. Pendergast, which was bought by Hollywood Candy Company in 1928, countered with their version of the Milky Way, a Double Milk Shake malt-chocolate flavored nougat candy bar. Fenn Brothers of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, made the Walnut Crush nougat bar. Two Walnut Hills walnut-studded, nougat-filled candy bars like the Fat Emma, were made -one by the Redel Candy Corporation of Milwaukee, in the 1920s and 1930s, and the other by Candymasters of Minneapolis, in the 1940s.\n\nCandymasters had been formed by two former employees of the Pendergast (now Hollywood Candy Company) who had moved back to Minneapolis from Centralia, Illiniois, to go off on their own. They made several other nougat filled candy bars – the Coffee Dan, the North Pole, and the Brazil Hill, maybe the only nougat candy bar in American history with the Brazil nut.\n\nCandy bar companies distinguished themselves by adding a variety of nuts to their nougats. The Hollywood Candy company even came out with a new American nougat variation called the Divinity Nougat, which was the center of their Smooth Sailin’ bars. Divinity is a Southern nougat- like confection made of egg whites and has the texture of marshmallow, fudge, and chewy vanilla taffy. If the corn syrup is replaced by brown sugar, Divinity is known as Sea Foam.\n\nI have found no reference to any Cincinnati candy companies that made a nougat candy bar. We were much more concerned with Opera Cream filled chocolates. And, oddly enough, there was no Opera Cream candy bar either, only truffles. Cincinnati truly missed out on having our own Opera Cream Flavored Cincinnati Nougat.\n\nA discussion with a friend about a childhood scouting favorite, campfire potatoes, brought up a discussion of two seasoning salts. Campfire potatoes – or Hasselback potatoes to the gourmand -are basically a potato you slice in thinnish cuts not completely through the potato. In between the cuts, you place butter, seasoning, bacon bits, or whatever else you want, wrap it in aluminum foil and place it on hot rocks or smoldering campfire coals. My friend said they used Lawry’s seasoning salt on their campfire potatoes. I suggested that you could also use Gripple, or the seasoning salt left at the bottom of the potato chip bag from Grippo’s Bar-B-Q potato chips, because it’s basically the same thing as Lawry’s salt. And it was meant to season a potato. Now you can buy Grippo’s Bar-B-Q chip seasoning separate as its own spice at Kroger groceries across the U.S.\n\nThis discussion led me to explore the difference between Lawry’s and Grippo’s Bar-B-Q spices – physically and historically. What I found is that one has a glamorous Hollywood origin, the other has a small town Italian origin. And both have pretty cool logo stories too. Lawry’s has inspired dozens of seasonings, marinades, and breading mixes, and Grippo’s is starting to inspire a brand new generation of local and regional chefs.\n\nAs a kid I always thought Lawry’s was called Lori’s salt, because I had a cousin Lori who liked it. It was a standard in my grandparents and my parents’ spice cabinet. We used it on steaks, scalloped potatoes and freshly steamed stringed beans. Before Kroger made it available in separate spice packages, and when I was a frugal college student, I used to save the Grippo’s powder at the bottom of a chip bag as my mom and grandmother used to save bacon grease for use later. I’d sprinkle it on pasta, chicken and pork.\n\nAs far as ingredients go, the main difference between Lawry’s and Grippo’s is yeast and natural smoke flavor. Grippo’s also seems to be more powdery, while Lawry’s is more granular. Lawry’s ingredients list salt, sugar, paprika, turmeric, onion powder, garlic powder, and cornstarch. In addition to those ingredients, Grippo’s lists Torula yeast, MSG, caramel flavor, and natural hickory smoked flavor.\n\nLawry’s salt was introduced to the market in 1938 at Ralph’s grocery stores, but before that was used exclusively at Lawry’s The Prime Rib Restaurant in Beverly Hills. Originally called Seazn-all, it was developed by Lawrence Frank at his first restaurant, Tam O’Shanter, and served only to guests.\n\nThe fanciful “L” logo on the package was created in 1959 ala Madmen by type designer Saul Bass, who was famous for designing the titles for classic movies like Vertigo and West Side Story. Another cool design story associated with Lawry’s The Prime Rib Restaurant is the pure art deco stainless steel carts they used to serve their famous Prime Rib. They were designed by Lawrence Frank and were heated by pans of charcoal in the lower section. A fully loaded cart weighs nearly 900 pounds, so heavy that asphalt tile had to be installed in the original restaurant to make sure the floor wouldn’t collapse. In 1937, one of these carts cost $3200 to make. Today the same cart would cost nearly $32,000.\n\nThe spicy sweet Grippo’s flavoring has a less glamorous Hollywood style origin The Grippos Company was formed in 1919 as the Grippo’s (Ice cream) Cone Company by Italian immigrant Angelo Grippo (1892-1956). He had immigrated to Cincinnati from the town of Senerchia, Avellino, Italy, in the state of Campania, where Naples pizza and the snail-like pastry sfogliatelle also hail. Coming from the area in the alps where ice cream was supposedly invented, he saw that Cincinnati was an ice cream town and took advantage, making cones in a small garage in downtown Cincinnati. And, Italians were dominating the ice cream trade in the U.S., despite our dominant Germanic-Graeter’s. But Angelo also saw that it was a pretzel town with our plethora of Germanic beer gardens and saloons where pretzels were engulfed as quickly as the beers. So, he invented the loop or teardrop pretzel in 1923, the same year the Hollywoodland sign went up in California.\n\nAs ingenius as Angelo was regarding pretzels, it wasn’t he who invented our venerated Grippo’s Bar-B-Q chips. It was his wife, Emma Louise Abrecht Grippo, about four years after his death. Her father, Paul Abrecht had immigrated to Cincinnati with his brother Otto from Lengau, Switzerland, to work at the Cincinnati beer breweries. He worked at the Hudepohl Brewery until his retirement. So, being exposed to the brewery and beer drinking crowd, Emma was probably familiar with snacking along with beer drinking and the fact that spicer snacks induce more beer drinking. So in 1959, she added salty potato chips to the Grippo’s snack line, shortly thereafter adding their iconic Bar-B-Q chips.\n\nThe business passed on to their daughter, Dorothy Grippo Pagel, and to her son, Ralph William Pagel (1947-2017), and now is in the hands of the third and fourth generation of the same family.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Hesmer’s potato chips of Evansville, Indiana, needed to find a new production home. So then president Allan Proctor contacted the Grippo’s Pagel family. They formed an agreement where Grippo’s would co-pack the plain chips for Hesmer’s, but would not manufacture barbecue chips for another label.\n\nThe cute little Grippo’s Bar-B-Q grilling boy mascot has an interesting evolution story. Originally he was the teardrop pretzel boy for the wax paper package developed by Angelo Grippo in the 1920s for his new pretzel line. Instead of carrying a bag of charcoal in his right hand and a bag of Bar-B-Q chips in his left as he does on the Bar-B-Q bag, the boy held a teardrop pretzel in his left, and a pretzel log or pretzel stick in his right if he was on those bags. But Hessmer’s Bar-B-Q chips had a leaner, taller grilling man mascot on a black and red foil package with script that is identical to Grippo’s. So, the pretzel boy mascot became the grilling boy mascot, and the Grippo’s Bar-B-Q bag took on an almost identical design to the Hessmer’s bag, which Grippo’s refused to co-pack for Hesmer, and which were eventually phased out in favor of Grippo’s Bar-B-Q in Evansville. So the Hesmer’s Bar-B-Q grilling man became the Grippo’s Bar-B-Q grilling boy. Grippo’s Grilling boy has even recently got a new update with a red grilling apron that he sports on the spice container label. In addition to the Grilling Boy, Grippo’s has a potato chip head chef for their regular potato chips, and a thin dancing onion girl for their green onion potato chips.\n\nGrippo’s Bar-B-Q chips have as much of a cult following in Evansville as they do in Cincinnati, and their local chefs have embraced them as an adder to mac and cheese, pizza, and even to a brownie sundae.\n\nI’m a sucker for finding an historic candy bar wrapper and the story it tells. That’s because it’s truly an American food invention, and there were hundreds, maybe even thousands of local and regional candy bars that have since gone the way of the dodo bird. So I was super-excited over the weekend to find a Tuesdae Candy Bar wrapper at the Lawrenceburg Antiques fair for a buck. It was from the 1940s and was in its original, but incredibly brittle wax paper wrapper. It even contained the original cardboard tab that the candy bar sat on, showing its small size compared to today’s candy bars, which are about one quarter inch larger than war era candy bars. After dampening the wax paper, I unfolded the wrapper flat, as wrapper collectors recommend for preservation.\n\nSo, of course, I had never heard of the candy bar, nor its maker, the Hollywood candy company, which the wrapper said existed in Centralia, Illinois, outside of Chicago. Reading the ingredients, the Tuesdae bar was a peanut based candy bar around a whipped corn syrup nougaty-caramel like center. And, as it turns out, it was offered at the same time as the company’s other candy bar, the Payday, and may have first been called the Sundae Nut Bar, which was the grandfather to the Payday Bar.\n\nThe Payday Candy bar was first introduced in 1932 by the Hollywood Candy company of not Hollywood, California, but of Hollywood, Carver County, Minnesota by former macaroni maker Frank Martoccio, an accidental entrant into the competitive candy market. The Payday Candy bar was marketed during the Great Depression as a meal replacement because of its dense peanut outer layer – perhaps the beginning of the energy bar industry. Frank had bought the defunct Pratt and Langhoft Candy factory in 1911 to replace one of his macaroni factory’s machines that had burned out. In 1927 he purchased the Pendergast Candy Company of Minneapolis and changed the name to Hollywood brands in 1933. He moved the entire operation to Centralia, Illinois, in 1938.\n\nTwo innovations came out of Hollywood Candy company. Pendergast Candy had discovered, by happy accident, the way to make a fluffy nougat for candy bars, which were taking off around the first world war. This was later copied by Frank Mars in his Milky Way bar, which he introduced in 1923, and later with his Snickers and Mars bars. The Hollywood Company counteracted Mars in 1927 with introduction of the Milkshake bar, which like the Mars had caramel and nougat covered in chocolate, but their nougat had a more malted flavor than the Milky Way. Its nougat was also lighter and fluffier than the Milky Way and could be frozen and eaten like an ice cream bar in the summer. The Milkshake was discontinued in the early 80s, but has quite a cult following.\n\nThe other innovation that came from Martoccio himself was a coating for his candy bars to keep them from melting in warm temperatures, which was a problem for summer candy bar sales. Using only real cocoa butter and eggs, he was able to sell it for 3 cents versus the 5 cents Hershey sold theirs. This technology became the Zero bar, or the Double Zero bar when it was first released in 1920. It was the first and maybe the only surviving “white chocolate” coated candy bar. It had a large blue and silver wrapper, which made it stand out at the candy counter from other bars. I was excited to learn Hollywood made the Zero, because it was my grandfather’s favorite candy bar. He introduced us to it as kids and to this day, he is the only person I know, besides us, who love the Zero bar.\n\nGrandpa was a baker, so he was particularly the sommelier of sweet tastes and confections. So for him to fall in love with what was then and still is a bit of an obscure candy bar, made it even more special to me. It’s a combination of caramel, and peanut and almond nougat, covered with its trademark layer of white chocolate fudge. In the 1950’s the Hollywood Candy company owned a Cincinnati-made Crosley Super Sport with the Zero logo and hired actor Max Bournstein as Mr Zero, to drive around promoting the candy. Perhaps this Cincinnati connection helped sway my Grandpa to the Zero Bar.\n\nThe Hollywood Candy company had numerous candy bars over their lifetime – the Payday and the Zero being the only two that survived. Mars and Hershey copied their, especially nougat technology, and rode their technology coattails. Hollywood’s rival to Mars’ Snicker bar, was the Hollywood bar, a bar with dark chocolate coating caramel, nougat and peanuts. The family sold the company in 1967 to what would become Sara Lee Brands. It has been owned by the Hershey company since 1996.\n\nWhile the Payday was named the #3 most popular candy bar in the 2019 LA Times Candy Bar Ranking, the Zero bar has received less notoriety. It’s been called the white chocolate snickers, even though it predates Snickers by a decade and is maltier and more delicious. In 2020 it was rated the Worst Candy Bar in America. But for me, because this now 100 year old American icon’s nutty nougat, malted milk and white chocolate decadence was good enough for Grandpa, it’s certainly still good for me."
