        "text": "Early 2000s sitcom Girlfriends ran from 2000 to 2008, picking up the baton passed from shows like Living Single and A Different World that examined friendship within the Black community, particularly those of professional Black women.\n\nWhile stars Tracee Ellis Ross (Joan Clayton), Jill Marie Jones (Toni Childs), Persia White (Lynn Searcy), and Golden Brooks (Mya Wilkes) — as well as co-star Reggie Hayes (William Dent) — carried the UPN-turned-CW show’s both hilarious and sometimes heartbreaking plot points, many celebrity guest stars popped in occasionally to bring a little unexpected magic to the already beloved series.\n\nStars were plentiful while the series aired, with cameos from several musicians, athletes and actors known for other shows and films. Here, VIBE has compiled a list of ten of our favorite celebrity guest appearances that may have slipped your mind, as well as the season and episodes in which they appear."
