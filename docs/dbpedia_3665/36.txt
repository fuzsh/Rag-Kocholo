This movie was still amazing after the second time I watched it. This movie is about a boy named Percy who finds something about him which will change his life forever. These 2 hrs transported me into a different realm. I loved everything about the movie. Would defenitely recommend this movie to People who love Action, Fantasy and adventure films and Also to people who like Greek Mytholigy. I hope you like this film.
