        "text": "“ No. You are half-bloods. One of thy parents was mortal, but the other was an Olympian. ”\n\n–Zoë Nightshade on demigods, talking to Bianca and Nico di Angelo in The Titan's Curse.\n\nDemigods, or half-bloods, are a race of beings that are half-mortal and half-god. They possess mortal souls and are vulnerable to old age and death though they have longer than average human lifespans; however, their divine blood endows them with supernatural abilities that allow them to achieve feats usually not possible by humans.\n\nDescription[]\n\nDemigods are the end result of a god and a mortal (often a human) having a child together. Because these children are half god, they have enhanced physical characteristics, near-inhuman reflexes, an affinity for the Greek or Latin language, and may have some level of control or skill over the realm of their godly parent. Most of them also have ADHD and dyslexia to help them learn Latin and Ancient Greek and to help them concentrate in battle (though some possess one of these abilities only while others possess none).\n\nWhile most demigods are created much like regular humans, children of Athena are born from their mother's thoughts merging with their father's. In this way, Athena remains a virgin goddess and it reflects how she herself was born, sprouting from the head of Zeus. It is unknown if other virgin goddesses or gods in general have a special way to have children like Athena. Apollo, a male god, is also capable of having children with mortal males, but the specifics of how this works is not mentioned.\n\nWhen a demigod reaches a certain age, normally early teens, their powers begin to manifest. At this time, demigods will release a scent that monsters are able to detect and this scent will become stronger if the child learns they are a demigod. Also, if the demigod is a child of a powerful god, the scent can become even stronger. If the child never learns that they are a demigod or they are a child of a minor god, monsters may overlook them. It is around this time that they are escorted to Camp Half-Blood usually by satyrs, where they are placed in one of the cabins, each honoring a different god or goddess.\n\nMost demigods wait to be claimed. Children of Athena are claimed at birth, while others have to demonstrate some form of their parents' trait to be noticed, either through cunning, powers, skills like archery, or even beauty. Otherwise, they are placed in Hermes' cabin, as he is the patron to travelers, anyone is welcomed there, including children of minor gods who aren't important enough to have a cabin. After the Second Titan War, Percy Jackson made all of the gods swear on the River Styx to recognize all of their children at the age of thirteen, and that each god and goddess (including the minor gods and goddesses) would get a cabin at Camp Half-Blood.\n\nFew demigods have full-blooded siblings (with the exception of twins), as their godly parent will usually leave their mortal consorts not long after a child is born, or sometimes even before that. However, some examples of demigod siblings in the series include Hylla and Reyna Ramírez-Arellano, Nico and Bianca di Angelo, Connor and Travis Stoll, Jason and Thalia Grace (who have the same father, but in different aspects).\n\nGreek demigods often go on quests given to them by the Oracle of Delphi, who is currently in the body of Rachel Elizabeth Dare. Roman demigods are usually issued a quest by an augur or, in at least one instance, a Roman god.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nDemigods are completely indistinguishable from humans. They do not have a divine form, however they do inherit some traits from their godly parent. For example, Percy inherited Poseidon's black hair, sea-green eyes, and brooding look, while Annabeth Chase inherited Athena's startling grey eyes. Thalia and Jason Grace inherited Jupiter’s electric blue eyes and regal features (Thalia also inherited Zeus' black hair) and Nico and Bianca di Angelo inherited Hades' black hair, dark eyes, and pale skin. The children of Aphrodite inherit her beauty and appeal. The children of Hermes inherit his elfish facial features and some, like Luke, inherited his blue eyes. Children of Ares inherit his sneer and tall, bulky appearance. Children of Hephaestus, such as Leo Valdez, Jake Mason, Harley, Nyssa, and Beckendorf inherit his skills with mechanics, resulting in them normally having large muscles and calloused hands (from working in the forges all day long). They also inherit his ugliness, or in Leo Valdez's case, his curly dark hair. Children of Apollo inherit his healing powers and archery prowess. Some, like Will Solace, inherit his blond hair and blue eyes. Magnus inherited Frey's long blonde hair and Alex Fierro got his/her sly smile from Loki. According to The Crown of Ptolemy, when an Egyptian god looks at a Greek demigod, they see them as a human surrounded by \"a powerful ultraviolet aura.\"\n\nIt is unknown whether a demigod's eye and hair color depends on what form their godly parent took while consorting with their mortal parent. Some demigods with the same divine parent have a different color.\n\nTraits[]\n\nThere are ways to hide or mask the smell, but if a demigod realizes who they truly are, their scent will reach its peak. The scent of children of the Big Three is much more potent than that of the children of lesser gods. Demigods' personalities tend to vary based on their divine parenthood; for example, Percy is reckless and rebellious, resembling Poseidon and the untamed seas, Annabeth inherits her mother's wits and intelligence, Clarisse is very violent and belligerent like her father, Jason and Thalia are strict and mature like their father Zeus/Jupiter, Leo is crafty and creative and understands machines more than people, like his dad, Hephaestus. Nico is very dark and moody like his dad and enjoys spending time with the dead more than the living like his father Hades, and Connor and Travis Stoll are mischievous and cunning and like to play pranks and steal things similar to their dad, Hermes. There are currently four known children of the Big Three since the death of Bianca di Angelo (a daughter of Hades) and Jason Grace (a son of Jupiter): Percy Jackson (son of Poseidon), Thalia Grace (daughter of Zeus), Nico di Angelo (son of Hades), and Hazel Levesque (daughter of Pluto). Most demigods also have ADHD and/or dyslexia (though it varies from demigod to demigod). Demigods are relatively (or extremely in some cases) stronger, more agile, and more durable than regular mortals, and have more resistance to diseases.\n\nDemigods are often labeled as 'troublemakers' at school. This is due mostly to the result that most demigods have ADHD. A trait shared by demigods is their feeling of not being able to belong, since they don't quite belong in the mortal world, and don't quite belong on Mount Olympus.\n\nDemigods have a distinct scent due to a spell cast by Lamia, a monstrous daughter of Hecate, which allows monsters to find them. It is also extremely dangerous for a demigod to use a cell phone, as Monsters are attracted to demigod voices traveling through the air. Many demigods indirectly change the course of history and demigod conflicts usually mirror conflicts in the real world, such as how when the Roman and Greek camps fought each other during the events of the American Civil War. Some powerful demigods can directly change some of the courses of history and can manipulate the minds of mortals in some events, using the Mist to change what mortals see. Currently, Hazel Levesque, Thalia Grace, Percy Jackson, and the children of Hecate have this ability.\n\nAccording to The Crown of Ptolemy, when an Egyptian god looks at a Greek demigod, they see them as a human surrounded by \"a powerful ultraviolet aura.\" Demigods also have the ability to act as a host for an Egyptian god for at least a short period of time despite not being Blood of the Pharaohs, a requirement for Egyptian magicians to safely channel the power of a god and host one.\n\nGreek Demigods[]\n\nGreek demigods are a subset of demigods who train at Camp Half-Blood, located in Long Island. They are born when a god conceives a child with a mortal while in their Greek aspect. As such, Greek demigods have an innate predisposition towards Ancient Greek and possess instinctive battle skills which manifests as dyslexia and ADHD respectively. Egyptian magic doesn't harm them as seen in Demigods & Magicians.\n\nThe children of humans and Titans are considered demigods rather than demi-Titans, such as the children of Hecate.\n\nThey are assigned to a cabin dedicated to their divine parent once they are claimed. Most Greek demigods die in their teens because they are prone to being attacked and killed by monsters either before making it safely to Camp Half-Blood or during quests and battles. Very few survive to make it past their twenties. If they do make it to their twenties, they are less likely to attract monsters, with the odds of monster attacks decreasing as they get older.\n\nRoman Demigods[]\n\nRoman demigods, such as Jason Grace, are a subset of demigods who train at Camp Jupiter, which is located near San Francisco. They are born when a god conceives a child with a mortal while in their Roman aspect. They naturally speak and read Latin, as opposed to Ancient Greek to Greek demigods, and are trained in the style of the Roman legions instead of Greek warfare. Roman demigods often make it to adulthood and can live in New Rome once their decade of service is over and are able to start families. Like their Greek counterparts, they are less likely to attract monsters the older they get.\n\nMuch like their Greek counterparts, children of humans and Roman Titans are considered demigods.\n\nRoman demigods start their lives at the Wolf House. It is there that Lupa decides if the child is strong or not. If she believes they are, she will spend time training the demigod skills that they will need to survive. Should the demigod make it through the training alive, Lupa will instruct them to follow their instincts to Camp Jupiter, home of the Roman Legion. However, if Lupa doesn't believe the demigod is strong enough or shows fear, it is said that they will be eaten by her and her wolves. Upon making it to Camp Jupiter, a praetor will decide if the demigod can join the Legion before sending them to have their augury read. If it is favorable, the demigod can then officially join the Legion. Like the Greek demigods, they were unaware of the existence of their counterparts at Camp Half-Blood in Long Island, but some demigods like Octavian had their suspicions.\n\nThis is due to a conflict between the two groups back during the American Civil War (and likely many other wars before), after which the gods manipulated the Mist as tightly as possible to stop the two groups from ever meeting each other again, although there have been some close calls. The head of their camp are the camp's two Praetors, who are elected demigods from the camp.\n\nIt is stated that some demigods, such as Janice and Claudia, are children of former legionnaires and gods, making them both demigods and legacies.\n\nNorse Demigods[]\n\nThey are the progeny of the Norse gods with mortals. Unlike the Greek and Roman demigods, they do not have a formal training camp nor are dyslexic or have ADHD, and are not claimed by their parent in the same manner as the Olympian Gods, instead having their parentage revealed in Valhalla or by the parent themselves telling them.\n\nIt is not uncommon for Norse demigods to be told and believe they are hallucinating. They are given medication and sometimes end up on the streets.\n\nNorse demigods also include the children gods have with Dwarves and Elves, such as Blitzen, the son of Freya and a Dwarf. As well as any child a Jotunn has with a mortal, such as Samirah al-Abbas and Alex Fierro, the children of the Jotunn Loki.\n\nUnlike other pantheons, they view the siblings of their divine parent and their children as family, such as Magnus seeing Freya as his aunt and her svartalf son Blitzen as his cousin.\n\nHindu Demigods[]\n\nNot part of Riordanverse\n\nThe following article/section is from the Pandava Quintet continuity under Rick Riordan Presents and not the Riordanverse canon.\n\nThe demigods of the Rick Riordan Presents series the Pandava Quintet, which is non-canonical with the Rick Riordan penned books. While Indra was mentioned by Apollo and Dionysus was mentioned to have battled Brahmas in the past, it is unknown if the following applies to them outside of the Pandava Quintet.\n\nThey are not the same as other demigods. Certain ones have a god/goddess as a father/mother and a mortal as the other parent, but the Pandavas specifically are reincarnated versions of the Pandava brothers. They don't have a god as their literal parent, but the god has helped create their soul. These are only Pandavas however, and other demigods in Hinduism are the regular kind.\n\nThey also don't have dyslexia or ADHD like the Greek/Roman demigods. It is unknown how non-Pandavas are claimed, but Pandavas are claimed by arrows shot at them, and eventually the parental god will stop it in whatever means the specific god does. An example is how Aru Shah was saved by Indra's lightning net.\n\nMayan Demigods[]\n\nNot part of Riordanverse\n\nThe following article/section is from the Storm Runner/Shadow Bruja continuity under Rick Riordan Presents and not the Riordanverse canon.\n\nMayan demigods are the children of humans and the Mayan Gods. They are referred to as Godborns. The children of these unions have some sort of physical handicap, medical issues, or mental issues, which is because the blood of humans and supernaturals are not meant to be mixed.\n\nUnlike other demigods, who can inherit multiple abilities based on their divine parent's attributes, godborns only inherit one of their parent's attributes, as too many powers are dangerous for a godborn. For example, Zane can only control fire and not storms in addition to his flames.\n\nDue to the Prophecy of Fire, the gods made a pact to not have godborn children, and if they broke the oath, then both the god and their children would be tortured to death. However, as revealed by Ixtab, the oath has been broken before Zane was born, but these godborns were hidden away and have long since died by the time Zane was born. After the events of The Fire Keeper, the Mayan gods do away with the pact and agree to claim and train their children.\n\nIn the past, they were sent to train at the Shaman Institute of Higher-Order Magic. The practice was stopped after the Prophecy of Fire was foretold, but reinstated after the gods elected to end the pact preventing them from having any more godborn children.\n\nMesopotamian Demigods[]\n\nNot part of Riordanverse\n\nThe following article/section is from the Sikander Aziz series continuity under Rick Riordan Presents and not the Riordanverse canon.\n\nAs Mesopotamian Gods have been mentioned to exist in the main universe, how much of the following from the Sikander Aziz series applies to the Riordanverse is unknown.\n\nGilgamesh is a Mesopotamian demigod and one of the most famous in history, known as two-thirds god and one third mortal (though Ishtar claims the more accurate term is a half-blood with a higher pedigree).\n\nWhen Gilgamesh or another Mesopotamian demigod use their powers, their eyes glow.\n\nOther Demigods[]\n\nAs of The Dark Prophecy, demigods of the Yoruba mythology, an African mythology tied to that of Voodoo practices, are known to exist. Olujime is the only known Yoruba demigod, also called élomirian. Further details on the specifics of these demigods are as of yet unknown.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nMain article: Demigod Abilities\n\nMost demigods born to Olympian gods have ADHD (although it varies between demigods and doesn't seem to be the case with Norse demigods at all), which hard-wires them for battle, and dyslexia, which they have because their brains are hardwired for reading either Ancient Greek or Latin. Demigods inherit some control over their divine parent's domain, such as Percy's ability to manipulate water or Leo's ability to manipulate fire. Some demigods also show some control of magic or curses, such as when the Apollo's Cabin cursed the Ares cabin to speak in rhymes, or children of Hecate, who have an innate ability to use it. Demigods also have a wide variety of other abilities that they all share, but these abilities vary depending on their godly parent, including superhuman strength, speed, superhuman senses, agility, above-average healing-factor, intelligence, durability, and endurance.\n\nThe Lost Hero mentions that the gods have influence over certain special powers that their children can receive, such as Hephaestus with his children's pyrokinesis (such as Leo Valdez), Aphrodite with charmspeak (such as Drew Tanaka and Piper McLean), Apollo with precognition (such as Halcyon Green, Idmon, and Octavian), and Pluto with ferrokinesis (such as Hazel Levesque). In addition Loki reveals in The Hammer of Thor that he is able to control his children through their shared powers if he so chooses, though this can be resisted with the correct training.\n\nTheir blood (one female demigod's and one male's, respectively) can revive ancient deities in their sleep, like Gaea. The \"sacrifices\" can be chosen by the god or goddess in question or other chosen. According to Khione, these actions taint the place of the ritual for generations.\n\nList of Demigods[]\n\nGreek Demigods[]\n\nHistoric Greek Demigods[]\n\nRoman Demigods[]\n\nJason Grace, son of Jupiter (deceased)\n\nDakota, son of Bacchus (deceased)\n\nHazel Levesque, daughter of Pluto\n\nFrank Zhang, son of Mars\n\nHylla Ramírez-Arellano, daughter of Bellona\n\nReyna Avila Ramírez-Arellano, daughter of Bellona\n\nLarry, son of Mercury\n\nMichael Varus, son of Janus (deceased)\n\nLeila, daughter of Ceres\n\nMichael Kahale, son of Venus\n\nLavinia Asimov, daughter of Terpsichore\n\nMarilyn, daughter of Euterpe\n\nBlaise, son of Vulcan\n\nJanice, daughter of Janus\n\nJulius, son of Mars\n\nMimi, daughter of Mefitis\n\nClaudia, daughter of Cardea\n\nHistoric Roman Demigods[]\n\nAeneas, son of Venus\n\nDiocletian, son of Jupiter\n\nHercules, son of Jupiter\n\nPhineas, son of Neptune\n\nRomulus and Remus, twin sons of Mars\n\nTarquitus, son of Faunus\n\nLouis XIV of France, son of Apollo\n\nMamurius Veturius, son of Vulcan\n\nJack London, son of Mercury\n\nNorse Demigods[]\n\nMagnus Chase, son of Frey\n\nSamirah al-Abbas, daughter of Loki\n\nGunilla, daughter of Thor (deceased)\n\nThomas Jefferson Jr., son of Tyr\n\nLars Alhstrom, son of Thor\n\nBlitzen, son of Freya\n\nUnnamed son of Odin\n\nUnnamed daughter of Heimdall\n\nAlex Fierro, child of Loki\n\nMallory Keen, daughter of Frigg\n\nHistoric Norse Demigods[]\n\nFjolnir, son of Frey and Gerth\n\nHelgi Hundingsbane, son of Borghild (Personification of the evening mist/moon)\n\nLeif Erikson, son of Skírnir\n\nJohn Henry, son of Thor\n\nYoruba Demigods[]\n\nOlujime\n\nHindu Demigods[]\n\nAru Shah, daughter of Indra (Pandava)\n\nYamini Kapoor-Mercado-Lopez, daughter of Dharma Raja (Pandava)\n\nBrynne Rao, daughter of Vayu (Pandava)\n\nNikita, daughter of Nasatya (Pandava)\n\nSheela, daughter of Dasra (Pandava)\n\nMayan Demigods[]\n\nZane Obispo, son of Hurakan\n\nRen Santiago, daughter of Pacific\n\nMarco, son of Nakon\n\nSerena, daughter of Ixchel\n\nLouie, son of Chaac\n\nAlana, daughter of Ixtab\n\nAdrik, son of Ixtab\n\nKenji, son of Ah-Muzen-Cab\n\nDiamante, daughter of Akan\n\nEzra, daughter of Yohualli\n\nHistoric Mayan Demigods[]\n\nJordan, son of Jun Jun'japu\n\nBird, son of Jun Jun'japu\n\nMesopotamian Demigods[]\n\nHistoric Mesopotamian Demigods[]\n\nGilgamesh, son of Ninsun\n\nEtymology[]\n\nMany demigods' names seem to relate to their Olympian parent (its possible that the godly parent either influence or give them their children's name):\n\nCastor and Pollux, twin sons of Dionysus - They share the same names as the twins of the Gemini.\n\nClarisse La Rue, daughter of Ares - A LaRue OBR is a type of rifle.\n\nConnor and Travis Stoll, sons of Hermes - 'Travis' is a pun on the word 'travel', since Hermes is the patron of travelers, and 'Connor' is a pun on the word 'con', since Hermes is the god of thieves and con men, which was brought up in the Sea of Monsters. Also, their surname is a homonym for 'stole', again, since Hermes is the god of thieves.\n\nFrank Zhang, son of Mars, legacy of Poseidon - Frank means bow and spear and his dad is the god of war. Zhang is Chinese for 'Master of Bows', as mentioned in The Son of Neptune.\n\nJake Mason, son of Hephaestus - Mason means \"one who works with stone\".\n\nJason Grace, son of Jupiter - He was named after the original Jason to appease Hera's wrath because Jason was her favorite hero.\n\nKatie Gardner and Miranda Gardiner, daughters of Demeter - Demeter is the goddess of the harvest and their last names refer to one who gardens or works with plants.\n\nLee Fletcher, son of Apollo - A fletcher is someone who makes archery arrows.\n\nLeonidas \"Leo\" Valdez, son of Hephaestus - Leo is the zodiac sign for a lion, and the element for Leo is fire, Leonidas also means \"lion\". It may also be a reference to Leonardo da Vinci, a famous inventor.\n\nMichael Yew, son of Apollo - Yew is a favorable choice of wood to use for longbows.\n\nNico di Angelo, son of Hades - Nico is most likely derived from the Greek prefix Necro, to mean \"dead\". Di Angelo means \"of angels\" in Italian, so then \"Angel of Death\".\n\nPercy Jackson, son of Poseidon - Percy claims his mother named him Perseus, after the son of Zeus. Perseus is a Greek name that means \"destroyer.\" The name is a reference to Poseidon, who is known to cause destruction like storms, earthquakes, shipwrecks, etc., when angered.\n\nPiper McLean, daughter of Aphrodite - Piper was named \"Piper\" because of her charmspeak, bestowed by Aphrodite.\n\nSilena Beauregard, daughter of Aphrodite - Beau Regard is French. It literally means \"beautiful looks.\"\n\nThalia Grace, daughter of Zeus - The name of one of the three Graces (and nine Muses) is Thalia. She too was a daughter of Zeus. The Muse Thalia sired the Corybantes, with Apollo. This Thalia was also attracted to Apollo, saying that he was \"hot.\"\n\nValentina Diaz, daughter of Aphrodite - Her name could likely be a play on Valentine's Day, which is fitting for a daughter of Aphrodite.\n\nWill Solace, son of Apollo - Though Solace really means \"to comfort in distress\", just as Will comforted and healed his boyfriend Nico, Solace could also be a play on the word \"Solar\".\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAccording to Alabaster, in Son of Magic, most demigods don't live past twenty years of age. However, this may only be referring to modern demigods, as demigods back in Ancient Greece were known to live to old age and die peacefully like Perseus. Roman demigods have been shown with entire families while living in New Rome (Legacies- the children of a demigod, and a mortal or the children of two demigods- are also found living there).\n\nHistorical Demigods alluded to in the series such as George Washington, Frederic Bartholdi, and Alfred Hitchcock, among others lived past their 60s and 70s. Harriet Tubman in particular lived to at least the age of 90.\n\nIn The Chalice of the Gods, Percy Jackson once theorized that if a demigod manages to graduate high school while receiving proper training, then they are considered strong enough to survive on their own and the monsters would likely leave them alone because they're no longer easy to kill.\n\nBecause demigods are commonly referred to as half-bloods, certain people whose parents aren't the same race tend to take offense to the name, such as Piper McLean (who is half-Cherokee and half-European) and Carter Kane (who is half-African and half-European).\n\nIn The Lost Hero, Piper wondered how Aphrodite could have so many children around the same age. But since gods can be in several places at once, Aphrodite can probably be pregnant in several different forms at the same time. Percy's gestation would seem to be accelerated, as his mother conceived him and gave birth within a single summer. Goddesses can also control the length of their pregnancy e.g., Aphrodite with Piper, as an accelerated pregnancy would have tipped off Piper's father Tristan to the divine nature of his daughter's mother.\n\nAs explained in The Last Olympian, there's no problem with demigods with different godly parents dating each other (like Charles Beckendorf of Hephaestus and Silena Beauregard of Aphrodite). Genetically speaking, gods don't have DNA as they're personifications of nature, so demigods are not biologically related to each other at all. The only exception to this are half-siblings with the same godly parent.\n\nWhile the offspring of a god and a mortal is called a demigod or half-blood, the child, grandchild, etc. of a demigod is called a legacy.\n\nThe word demigod literally means \"half-god\".\n\nLyrus was the brother of Aeneas, but it is unknown if he was a son of Aphrodite or Venus.\n\nAccording to The Crown of Ptolemy, when an Egyptian god looks at a Greek demigod, they see them as a human surrounded by \"a powerful ultraviolet aura.\"\n\nAs shown in The Crown of Ptolemy, demigods can host Egyptian gods, with Percy Jackson being the first known one to ever do so.\n\nTitans and nymphs can sire half-mortal children, who are also referred to as demigods, as Potamoi are known for having many naiad daughters who occasionally mate with humans and Oceanus had a mortal grandson by the name of Hypseus [1] Helios had a demigod son named Phaethon.\n\nA few demigods have names that are anagrams with extra letters to the names of their godly parents, such as Janice, Claudia, Annabeth, and Clarisse.\n\nEven though all demigods were capable of great achievements, in the original Greek and Roman myths not all of them were gifted with special abilities, and when they did, it was because of their divine parent willed it so, like a blessing. An example of this was Euphemus, one of the Argonauts, whose father, Poseidon, granted him the power to walk on water.\n\nGallery[]\n\nMain Universe[]\n\nGreek[]\n\nModern Day Demigods[]\n\nHistoric Demigods[]\n\nRoman[]\n\nModern Day Demigods[]\n\nHistoric Demigods[]\n\nNorse[]\n\nModern Day Demigods[]\n\nHistoric Demigods[]\n\nRick Riordan Presents[]\n\nHindu[]\n\nMayan[]\n\nMesopotamian[]\n\nHistoric Demigods[]"
