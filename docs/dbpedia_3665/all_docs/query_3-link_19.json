        "text": "We update studies as the Lord Jesus leads us. You can find the latest update of this study at ChurchAges.net\n\nGreat Tribulation lasts for three and a half years\n\nA time can refer to a year.\n\nTimes (plural) can be two years.\n\nThen half a time, would be half a year.\n\nSo obviously, this can mean 3½ years?\n\nThat would suit the length of time in Scripture for the period known as great Tribulation, which occurs just before the battle of Armageddon. This will be the worst time of trouble that the world has ever experienced.\n\nDANIEL 12:1 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people:\n\nand there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time:\n\nand at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.\n\nAt the end of great Tribulation, Jesus will finally deliver the surviving Jews from the powerful destruction of the final antichrist Pope.\n\nDANIEL 12:7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.\n\n\"For\" a time, times, and a half speaks of a time interval that lasts 3½ years.\n\nA time, times, and an half a time will be three and a half years.\n\nThis agrees with another Scripture where Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles.\n\nThe Gentiles will trample the holy city of Jerusalem for 3½ years.\n\nREVELATION 11:2 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.\n\nThis is the time of great Tribulation.\n\n42 months is 3½ years.\n\nREVELATION 11:3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.\n\nThese are the two Jewish prophets Moses and Elijah, who guide the 144000 Jews to receive the Lord Jesus in great Tribulation time.\n\nA Bible year is 360 days.\n\nThus a Bible month is 30 days.\n\n42 x 30 = 1260\n\nSo 42 months equals 1260 days.\n\nThis is only possible if each Bible month is 30 days.\n\nDANIEL 12:7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be\n\nfor a time, times, and an half;\n\nand when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.\n\n\"For\" a time, times, and a half speaks of a time interval that lasts 3½ years.\n\nThe scattering of the Jews will finally be accomplished by the end of 3½ years. Then the 144000 Jews will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and Jesus shall deliver them.\n\nREVELATION 12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.\n\nAn eagle has amazing eyesight, which represents the amazing Scriptural insight that a prophet has. The two wings represent the two Jewish prophets, Moses and Elijah, that use their supernatural power to protect the Jews when all the nations have rejected them.\n\nThe face of the serpent is the final Pope who takes over the world as a dictator.\n\nThe succession of Popes is the figurehead of the man-made denominational beast system that rules the Roman Catholic Church and will finally take over all the churches.\n\nREVELATION 17:8 ... when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.\n\nThey claim Peter as the first Pope. And they claim that the Popes are the successors of Peter. Thus the \"beast always was\" right from the beginning of the church as Peter was the first apostle to be chosen.\n\n\"And is not\". The Pope dies.\n\n\"And yet is\". A new Pope is elected.\n\nThe succession of Popes never ends. It is the longest line of rulers in the Western world.\n\nThis is the snake, the trail of the serpent in the New Testament.\n\nThis snake is just waiting for the final Pope, who will be the face of the serpent as he rules in great Tribulation. He will be Satan's mastermind and superman.\n\nAll these previous Scriptures are in agreement for a three-and-a-half-year great Tribulation.\n\nBut then comes a slightly different Scripture.\n\nDANIEL 7:25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.\n\n\"Until\" a time, times, and a half speaks of the time interval before the 3½ years that ends when the 3½-year time interval begins.\n\nCaution: There is no quick and easy answer to this prophecy of Daniel. We have to dig deep and think hard.\n\nMany Scriptures have a double meaning\n\nHOSEA 11:1 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.\n\nThis is obviously referring to when Moses called the Jews, the children of Israel, out of Egypt in the first exodus.\n\nBut it also has a second meaning. Jesus coming out of Egypt as a young Boy so that in the second Exodus, He could lead the church out of Judaism.\n\nMATTHEW 2:14 When he arose, he [Joseph] took the young child [Jesus] and his mother [Mary] by night, and departed into Egypt:\n\nMATTHEW 2:15 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.\n\nPlease remember that any prophecy can have two interpretations.\n\nOne verse can refer to events that are 2000 years apart\n\nISAIAH 61:2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;\n\nJesus only fulfilled part of this verse.\n\nISAIAH 61:2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD [this refers to the ministry of Jesus], and the day of vengeance of our God [this refers to the 3½ years of great Tribulation]; to comfort all that mourn.\n\nThe ministry of Jesus was separated by 2000 years from the 3½ years of great Tribulation.\n\nSo one verse refers to two events separated by 2000 years.\n\nWhen Jesus read from Isaiah, He only read the first half of the sentence.\n\nLUKE 4:19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\n\nLUKE 4:20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.\n\n:21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.\n\nJesus knew His ministry only applied to the first half of this verse.\n\nThus, statements that are written next to each other in a verse of Scripture can refer to different events that have nothing to do with each other.\n\nConfirming a covenant is not Making a covenant\n\nThe prophecy that the churches have really got wrong is in Daniel Chapter 9:27\n\nDANIEL 9:27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease,\n\nChurch-goers assume “he” is the Antichrist who will “make” a covenant with the “Jews” for 7 years. This automatically makes a 7 year Tribulation.\n\nCaution. The Bible never says \"the Antichrist\" or \"the antichrist\".\n\nI JOHN 2:18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.\n\nModern-day churches assume the covenant is with the Palestinians who live in Israel so that the Jews can rebuild the Temple on the Temple Mount where the Dome of the Rock is. All this is conjecture, also known as wishful thinking.\n\nWe just project the verse into the future and then we cannot check it. We have to keep waiting to see if that happens. This masks the fact that devoted followers of man-made interpretations are easily deluded.\n\nBut there are two major problems with this interpretation.\n\nFirst, if the Antichrist “confirms” the covenant, he does not “make” a covenant.\n\nSo the Antichrist would have to be on earth for much longer than 7 years in order to first make the covenant, and then later confirm it.\n\nSecondly, if a covenant is confirmed, then it cannot be broken.\n\nThere is no mention of breaking the covenant in Daniel 9:27.\n\nThe prophecy just says that the Temple sacrifice will cease in the middle of a 7-year period.\n\nSo, Who made the covenant?\n\nWho confirmed the covenant?\n\nWhat stopped the temple sacrifices in a way that did not break the covenant?\n\nDespite stopping the sacrifices, the covenant remained confirmed.\n\nGod made the covenant with Abraham\n\nGod made a covenant with Abram (later called Abraham) in Genesis Chapter 15, which involved sacrifice.\n\nGENESIS 15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram,\n\nThen God confirmed this sacrificial covenant in Christ at Calvary.\n\nGALATIANS 3:17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ,\n\nHow did Jesus confirm the covenant made with Abram?\n\nA woman symbolizes the church. God used two female animals to show that His Old Testament sacrifices were referring to the future salvation of the church.\n\nThe ram speaks of the sacrifice of Jesus. Isaac should have died but the ram took his place.\n\nWe Gentiles should have died for our sins, but Jesus took our place.\n\nThe scapegoat carried the Jews's sins far away. So Jesus carried our sins far away down to hell and dumped them on the devil.\n\nThe red heifer was burned to ash. Our sins were burned to ash down in hell so that we can be free from them. The blood of the red heifer was sprinkled seven times. The blood of Jesus sanctified the church through 7 church ages.\n\nLet us look at the covenant God made with Abram and then see how Jesus confirmed that covenant by giving it a much deeper meaning.\n\nGENESIS 15:9 And he (God) said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.\n\nGENESIS 15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.\n\nOne bird represented salvation, and the other one represented divine healing. Healing and salvation cannot be separated from the Sacrifice of Jesus at Calvary.\n\nThe carcasses were cut in half, and the two halves were laid facing each other.\n\nThese two halves represent the Old Testament and the New Testament that face each other across the four Gospels. The ministry of Christ in the 4 Gospels links the Old and the New Testaments.\n\nGENESIS 15 :12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.\n\nSunset. Abram fell asleep. This has two meanings. A deep sleep is symbolic of death. The horror of death is hell fire where we start to pay for our sins.\n\nThe second meaning of falling asleep is that Abram could in no way contribute to his side of the covenant by his good works.\n\nOur good works cannot save us. The covenant that saves us from hell was entirely won by the efforts of Jesus. We could not do any works to get our sins forgiven.\n\nGENESIS 15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.\n\nWhen Jesus died, the sun went down at midday for three hours of darkness. The smoking furnace of the pit of hell. The wages of sin is death and then hell fire.\n\nThe burning lamp was the Holy Ghost. When Jesus died between the two halves of the Bible, the physical Old Testament, and the spiritual New Testament, then His Holy Ghost left His Body and carried our sins down to the pit of hell. There He overcame the devil and dumped our sins on Satan in order to win our salvation.\n\nThereby God used the Sacrifice of Jesus to confirm the covenant that He had made with symbolic sacrificial animals with Abram.\n\nThis sacrifice on Calvary is a covenant that will never be broken. This confirmed Sacrificial covenant will last for all eternity.\n\nBut the sacrifice of Jesus ended all the animal sacrifices that were made in the Temple. They became obsolete. No more oblations in the Temple.\n\nAn oblation is something that is offered to God.\n\nThere is nothing that we can offer to God to atone for our sins.\n\nGod still owes the Jews three and a half years\n\nDANIEL 9:27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease,\n\nGod made a covenant with Abram that was looking forward to the ministry of Jesus.\n\nThe ministry of Jesus was supposed to be 7 years.\n\nThis can be called one week as a day can represent a year.\n\nLaban said to his son-in-law Jacob:\n\nGENESIS 29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n\nDANIEL 9:24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city\n\nSeventy weeks were left to the Jews. Weeks of years.\n\n:25 ...unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks\n\nA score is 20. Three scores will be 60.\n\nJesus as Messiah came after 7 + 62 = 69 weeks\n\nThus, when Jesus began his ministry, the Jews only had one week left. Seven years.\n\nJesus started near the end of the year AD 29 and was killed in the year AD 33 when the Jews cut Him short after half a week. So Jesus only had a ministry of 3½ years.\n\nSo God still owes the Jews half a week, 3½ years.\n\nGod will turn to the Jews in the 3½-year great Tribulation.\n\nIn the meanwhile, God has turned to the Gentiles in the seven church ages that cover 2000 years.\n\nSo the 2000 years of the Gentile church ages pushes apart the two halves of the last week (or 70th week) of Daniel’s prophecy.\n\n7 and 12 are key numbers\n\nLook at a diagram of the Old Testament Tabernacle.\n\nIn the Holy Place was a seven-branched candlestick representing the 7 church ages that had the light of the Gospel.\n\nAnd a table with 12 loaves of shewbread representing the 144000 Jews in the Tribulation from the 12 tribes of Israel. This bread had to be eaten in the Holy Place. That is why the Jews have to be back in the Promised Land of Israel during great Tribulation.\n\nYour head is connected to your body by your backbone.\n\nJesus is the Head of the church and the Head of the Jews.\n\nThe neck has 7-vertebrae representing the 7 church ages.\n\nThen comes the 12 vertebrae connected to the 12 ribs, representing the Jews of the 12 tribes of Israel.\n\n12 and 7 were the number of baskets of rejected scraps that the disciples collected after the 5000 and 4000 were fed.\n\nJesus expected the disciples to understand why 12 and 7 baskets of rejected scraps were collected.\n\nMATTHEW 16:9 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?\n\n:10 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?\n\nBread represents doctrine. Leaven is the error of the Pharisees and the Jewish religious leaders who made the Jews reject the Gospel in Pilate’s Judgement Hall.\n\nThe disciples would collect this rejected Gospel and write and spread it as the New Testament to the seven church ages. Then, when the Gentiles reject the revealed written Word of God at the end of the 7th church age, these rejected truths will go to the 12 tribes of Israel in the time of great Tribulation.\n\n12 and 7 are key numbers.\n\nLet us return to Daniel’s prophecies.\n\nWe need to understand Chapter 9 in order to explain the time, times, and half a time.\n\nSome quick background.\n\nA Bible year is 360 days\n\nREVELATION 11:2 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.\n\n:3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.\n\nGreat Tribulation time of 3½ years is given as 42 months or 1260 days. (A score is 20).\n\nThus each month is 30 days. 1260/42 = 30\n\nThus a Bible year of 12 months is 12 x 30 = 360 days.\n\nBut our Gentile or Roman years are 365.24 days\n\nSo each year, we have 5.24 days extra.\n\nSo in 69 years we have 5.24 x 69 = 361 extra days which is virtually equal to an extra Bible year of 360 days. (The error is less than half of one percent. 99.6% accurate, which is close enough)\n\nSo 69 of our years equals 70 Bible years.\n\nEvery 70 Bible years sees us having one less of our longer Gentile years.\n\nIn prophecy a day can represent a year.\n\nLaban said to Jacob:\n\nGENESIS 29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n\nSo 70 weeks = 70 x 7 = 490 days = 490 Bible years.\n\nBut 490/70 = 7\n\nSo there are 7 less of our longer Gentile years.\n\nEvery 70 Bible years we lose one Gentile year. So in 490 Bible years we have 7 Gentile years less.\n\nThus 490 Bible years = 490 – 7 = 483 Gentile years on our calendar.\n\nDANIEL 9:24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city,\n\nGod promised the Jews another 490 Bible years which is 483 years on our Roman or Gentile calendar.\n\nDANIEL 9:25 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.\n\nThis commandment to rebuild the wall around Jerusalem was given to Nehemiah in 446 BC in the 20th year of the king of Persia.\n\nNEHEMIAH 2:1 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king,\n\nThe gates were rebuilt where the streets met the city wall.\n\nNehemiah built the wall in 52 days.\n\nNEHEMIAH 6:15 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.\n\nThese were troublous times because the builders had to hold a weapon in one of their hands.\n\nNEHEMIAH 4:17 They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.\n\nMany encyclopedias give the date as 465 BC, when Artaxerxes began to reign.\n\nSo his 20th year will be 446 BC. (dates can be a little tricky).\n\nThe red number indicates that his first year was in 465 BC.\n\nSo Daniel’s 490 Bible years (483 of our Gentile years) begins in 446 BC.\n\nThere are three time periods.\n\nDANIEL 9:25 … unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks:\n\n7 + 62 = 69 weeks to Messiah and then one final week to make the 70th week.\n\nWhy a period of 49 weeks?\n\nDr. Scofield gives the time of the prophet Malachi as 397 BC.\n\nThis is 49 years from 446 BC.\n\nSo the first time of 7 weeks was when the Jews had prophetic guidance.\n\nThen followed longer times of 62 weeks when there were no prophets.\n\nLUKE 3:1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,\n\nThe 15th year of Tiberius is 14 + 15 = AD 29.\n\nJohn the Baptist emerged in AD 29, and after a 6-month ministry, he baptized Jesus Who was about 30.\n\nLUKE 3:23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age\n\nMessiah’s ministry began near the end of the year AD 29 when He was baptized.\n\nJesus was almost 30.\n\n7 + 62 = 69 weeks\n\n69 x 7 = 483 days = 483 Bible years\n\nThere will be 7 fewer of the longer Gentile years.\n\nSo it will be 483 – 7 = 476 Gentile years.\n\nFrom 446 BC to AD 30 = 446 +30 = 476 Gentile years on our calendar.\n\nSo the dates agree. Towards the end of year 29, will be almost AD 30.\n\nDANIEL 9:26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.\n\nMessiah started near the end of AD 29 and had a ministry of 3½ years, which is half a week.\n\n“And the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary”;\n\nThe Romans destroyed the city and the Temple sanctuary in AD 70.\n\nSo the Romans are the people of the antichrist prince that shall come.\n\nToday, the prince or world ruler that will come from Rome is the Pope.\n\nThe Pope is the only world-wide influential figure in Rome.\n\nThe church ages are the dividing of time\n\nThe seven church ages are the mystery interval that the Jews knew nothing about.\n\nGod rejected the Jews in AD 33 when they killed Jesus.\n\nSo God stopped counting time for Israel.\n\nDaniel’s last week or 70th week of 7 years was split in half.\n\nThe last seven years were divided into two equal portions that were pushed apart by the seven church ages.\n\nWhen the church is caught up, then God will return to the Jews for their last half-week of 3½ years.\n\nDANIEL 9:27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.\n\nIn the middle of the last week or 70th week that began at the end of AD 29 (a week is 7 days) the sacrifice of Jesus in AD 33 caused all the Old Testament Temple sacrifices to cease as animal sacrifices became obsolete.\n\nThe Pagan Roman Empire crucified Jesus and then destroyed 1,100,000 Jews in AD 70 when they destroyed Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple. Between AD 132 - 136, the Roman emperor Hadrian killed another 580,000 Jews, and further desolated the city, and buried the Temple site. He scattered the remaining Jews into slavery and exile. This desolation of the Temple site continues to this date.\n\nDuring the almost 2000 years when the Jews were scattered into the desolation of exile, endless persecutions and pogroms were poured out onto them in the different nations where they tried to settle.\n\nAfter the death of Messiah, God left the Jews and turned to the Gentiles. The Gentile church would pass through seven different church ages during the 2000 years of history.\n\nThen Jesus will catch up the true church to meet Him in the air.\n\nThe world will go into great Tribulation, which will last 3½ years.\n\nThat will be the last half week of human history as we know it. During that time God will turn to the Jews, using His two prophets Moses and Elijah, and the 144000 Jews will turn to Jesus as Messiah and receive the Holy Ghost baptism.\n\nThey will then all be killed.\n\nThe price for Jewish salvation will be that they must die for their faith.\n\nThe Jews demanded the death of Jesus. They and their children took responsibility for this awful decision. They have to keep paying for that decision.\n\nMATTHEW 27:25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.\n\nIn the following diagram the red years are Bible years.\n\nSo another meaning of “a time, times, and an half” are the three time periods allocated to the Jews from the command to rebuild the wall to the time of rejecting and killing Messiah.\n\n“A time” of 7 weeks where they still had prophetic guidance.\n\n“Times” which added up to 62 weeks where the Jews were left to their own devices and ended up with unscriptural Old Testament leaders like Rabbis, Pharisees, and Sadducees that had arisen during their Babylonian captivity.\n\nThen the \"half a time\" of the ministry of Jesus.\n\nUnder the Maccabees the Jews gained political freedom from the Greeks. Around 100 BC they conquered Idumea, which was not in the Promised Land. They forced the Idumeans to adopt the Jewish religion. Herod came from Idumea and was thus able to take over as king of the Jews, by claiming to be a Jew. Herod became the cruelest of all Jewish kings and tried to kill Jesus.\n\nIsrael became a spiritual desert which was aggravated when Rome conquered them.\n\n“And an half”. The ministry of Jesus the Messiah lasted 3½ years. Then He was killed.\n\nThus one meaning of “a time, times, and an half” was the length of time from the commandment given to Nehemiah to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, to the death of Messiah.\n\nThis was the length of time in which God dealt with the Jews until God rejected them and turned to the Gentiles.\n\nThe Jews forced the Romans to crucify their Messiah.\n\nThe High Priest Caiaphas preferred to kill one Man rather than have the Jewish priesthood lose their place or position of power over the people. Rather than have the Romans take away the Jewish nation that the elevated priesthood corruptly ruled.\n\nJOHN 11:47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.\n\n:48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.\n\nThus it was better for one Man to die, rather than have the greedy and self-important Temple priesthood deposed.\n\nBut by killing Messiah, the Temple lost all its spiritual power as the inner veil was torn, and God had left the Holy of Holies.\n\nThe Law was finished when the High Priest tore his garments.\n\nLEVITICUS 10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.\n\n(If the High Priest tears his clothes, that is the end of the Law. And the nation will burn. Which is what happened in AD 70 when the Temple and Jerusalem burned).\n\nAaron was the High Priest. The High Priesthood went to his sons when he died.\n\nThen, in the days of Jesus, the High Priesthood got corrupted into a family business of father-in-law and son-in-law.\n\nLUKE 3:2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests,\n\nJOHN 18:13 And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.\n\nHuman traditions had replaced Scripture. The High Priest position went from a man to his son-in-law instead of to his son.\n\nThen it got worse as the High Priest Caiaphas rent or tore his clothes.\n\nMATTHEW 26:65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, …\n\nThis broke and thus ended the Law.\n\nMATTHEW 27:50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.\n\n:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom;\n\nCaiaphas tore his clothes. God tore up the inner veil and left the Temple.\n\nFrom then on, the Temple was a spiritual desolation. A religious pretense.\n\nThen about 37 years later, these same Romans came back to destroy the Temple in AD 70 by fire.\n\nThus they also destroyed the elevated priesthood. Those who served in the Temple were slain. Jewish robbers and Zealots took over the temple and murdered the High Priest just before the Temple was destroyed.\n\nThe Jewish nation was destroyed with over a million killed and 90000 Jews taken to Rome as slaves. The Temple treasure was taken to Rome and used to build the Colosseum, where Christians were later fed to the lions. Most of the rest of the Jews were scattered into exile amongst the nations. Of those who managed to stay in Israel, a further 580,000 were killed in AD 135 by the Roman emperor Hadrian, and the rest were scattered amongst the nations.\n\nDANIEL 12:7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.\n\nThis verse has a double fulfillment.\n\nFrom the commandment to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem to the death of Messiah was “a time” of prophetic guidance (49 Jewish years), followed by “times” of Jews striving to govern themselves until finally conquered by Rome (62 x 7 = 434 Jewish years) and then the arrival of the forerunner, the prophet John the Baptist. Then the final week began at the end of AD 29 but was cut off at the half-way mark after 3½ years at Calvary.\n\n“And an half week”. This was the 3½ years of the ministry of Christ.\n\nThen the Jews were cut off from God and scattered.\n\nThen came the two thousand years of the seven church ages.\n\nIn the future lies the last half week, which is the 3½ years of great Tribulation.\n\nSo this Scripture also describes the 3½ years of great Tribulation. This gives the Scripture a double meaning.\n\nA time (one year), times (two years), and an half (half a year).\n\nThis is 3½ years.\n\nThen the 144000 Jews who accept Jesus during great Tribulation as well as their two prophets will be killed at the end of the 3½ years of great Tribulation.\n\nThat scatters the power of the holy people of Israel.\n\nThen Jesus steps in for Armageddon.\n\nREVELATION 12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.\n\nTwo great prophets, Moses and Elijah, protect Israel during the 3½ years of great Tribulation from the onslaught of the final man of sin who hijacks the position of Pope. This gives him worldwide spiritual power as the head of 1.4 billion Catholics.\n\nPlus the incredibly vast wealth of the Vatican.\n\nTen dictators will give him their military power.\n\nHe will isolate Israel from all the nations, leaving them in a wilderness of being unwanted, where everyone hates the Jews and nobody wants to know the Jews.\n\nSo this time, times, and a half also refer to the 3½ years of great Tribulation when we apply this prophecy to the Jews.\n\nBut now we come to a very subtle difference.\n\nThis next prophecy looks the same but is very different. This prophecy does not refer to 3½ years.\n\nDANIEL 7:25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.\n\nThis verse refers to the enemy of truth, the Roman Catholic church, attacking the true church who are the saints of God. This has got nothing to do with the Jews in great Tribulation.\n\nThe key word that makes a huge difference is “until” the time, times, and …..\n\nNot “an half time” of the 3½ years but a “dividing” of time.\n\nThis is a new word that is easily misunderstood.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n“Until” does not indicate an exact length of time, but it points out when the time period ends.\n\nThe “dividing of time” refers to the 7 church ages.\n\nThe enemy wears out truth until the dividing of time is over. Until the 7 church ages are over.\n\nMan-made church traditions and commandments will always oppose Scriptural truth until the 7th church age ends.\n\nThe 7 church ages push apart the two half-weeks of Daniel’s prophecy.\n\nThe 3½ years of the ministry of Jesus (first half-week) to the Jews ends time for the Jews as God turns to the Gentiles after Calvary.\n\nThen the church ages end as Jesus catches up His church to Heaven and turns back to the Jews.\n\nSo the Jews get their second half of Daniel’s 70th week in great Tribulation.\n\nIn between these two half-week periods come the 7 church ages.\n\nThe 7 church ages divide this last time of 7 years (the 70th week) into two equal blocks of time.\n\nThus the 7 church ages are “the dividing of time”.\n\nThis is the timeline that God used for the Jews, so He uses the same timeline for the church.\n\nPagan Rome mutated to become the Roman Catholic church\n\nDANIEL 7:23 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.\n\nDANIEL 7:24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise:\n\nWhy is the fourth beast, the Roman beast different from the kingdoms of Babylon, Persia, and Greece?\n\nBecause the pagan Roman Empire was destroyed by the Barbarians and then out of the ruins of the Roman Empire arose the power of the Roman Catholic Church that was based on these pagan traditions. Thus the pagan traditions of the Roman Empire that had started in Babylon infiltrated the Roman Catholic Church. The mysteries of Babylon entered the Roman Catholic Church and turned that Church into Mystery Babylon the Great. The mother of the Protestant harlots who came out of her.\n\nThe beast with 10 horns and one head refers to the pagan Roman empire.\n\nThe 10 horns refer to a certain 10 of the many barbarian tribes that helped break up the Roman empire.\n\nBut these 10 barbarian tribes, intentionally or unintentionally, then played a major role in the rise of the Roman Catholic Church to conquer the barbarian conquerors of the pagan Roman empire.\n\nRome always conquers its conquerors. So the Roman Catholic church will conquer the Protestants.\n\nLook at the pagan Babylonian and Pagan Roman beliefs that were sugar-coated with Christianity and are in the church systems.\n\nNeedless to say, all the following terms are unscriptural.\n\nPontiff, Cardinal, Christmas, 25 December, Christmas tree, Lent, Easter eggs, Easter bunnies (Remember Hugh Hefner’s immoral Playboy empire where women were dressed up as bunnies. Why?).\n\nThen “Trinity” and “God the Son”. “God the Holy Ghost”. Confessionals. Monks. Nuns. Rosary. Sign of the cross. Rosary. “One God in three Persons”.\n\nSigns of the Zodiac.\n\nSomehow Santa got into Christmas. Why?\n\nMove the “n” in Santa to the end of the word, and you get Satan.\n\nChurch-goers are easily fooled.\n\nDANIEL 7:25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.\n\nRoman Catholic errors will be believed by the Protestant churches and wear out the few people who try to resist these mistakes.\n\nDisagree with the Trinity and with Christmas, and you will not be wanted by your church or by your family or friends. This rejection and isolation will wear out many and cause them to reject truth and just stay with church errors for the sake of peace and acceptance by the church community.\n\nThis intense mental bullying will continue UNTIL the end of the dividing of time.\n\nUntil the last church age ends when the Lord catches up His church into the air.\n\nMATTHEW 24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.\n\nChurches are so against baptism in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nThey baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit but cannot tell us what that name is.\n\nTrinity has fooled them into thinking that three titles are a name.\n\nMATTHEW 10:22 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.\n\nThis is not salvation from the Lake of Fire. That salvation is by grace through faith. Not by works.\n\nThis salvation by endurance to the end means we will only be saved from great Tribulation if we keep on believing the revealed Scripture and opposing unscriptural church beliefs. We must keep on being Scriptural despite church opposition, right until Jesus comes to fetch His saints up to Heaven.\n\nUntil the end of the seventh church age.\n\nThe only relief that the true church will get is when Jesus finally catches them up to Heaven.\n\nLUKE 18:8 … Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\n\nJesus will not find much Scriptural faith when He comes back.\n\nROMANS 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\n\nBecause church-goers are no longer Scriptural in what they believe, the Trinitarian church-goers will wake up with a jolt in great Tribulation. Their whole world will be turned upside down as the churches become killers of all those who dissent.\n\nREVELATION 13:15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.\n\nAll the saved Christians (the foolish virgins, clean women) who were fooled into believing unscriptural ideas by their church leaders, will perish.\n\nThe only real power of God will be displayed by the two Jewish prophets, Moses and Elijah.\n\nWhat will the foolish virgins learn from them?\n\nREVELATION 15:2 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.\n\nThe sea of glass where sins and unbelief and Bible errors are cleansed away is full of fire.\n\nThese previously saved souls now have their denominational unbelief, and church errors burned off them in the horrors of great Tribulation, where they will be killed for their faith.\n\nCompare this with Revelation Chapter 4, where John is caught up to Heaven, symbolizing the catching up of the true church, the Bride, who are the wise virgins.\n\nWhat does he see?\n\nREVELATION 4:6 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal:\n\nThe sea of glass is clear like crystal. No fire. The Bride will not go through great Tribulation.\n\nThe wise virgins had oil (the Holy Spirit) that could burn and produce light. Thus they had enough light to read the Scriptures so that they understood the verses. Thus their unbelief had been removed as the Holy Spirit taught them the truth from Scripture.\n\nThe evidence of the Holy Spirit is being able to understand the truth of Scripture.\n\nJOHN 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth:\n\nA Spirit-filled Christian will never deny the revelation of truth.\n\nBut what do the foolish virgins hear in the Tribulation from Moses?\n\nREVELATION 15:3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.\n\nThe Lamb, Jesus, is Lord God Almighty.\n\nREVELATION 15:4 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.\n\nOnly Jesus is holy.\n\nThus there can be no Trinity as the other two Persons would not be holy.\n\nIt will take the savage brutality of great Tribulation to knock the Trinitarian beliefs out of the minds of the foolish virgins."
