        "text": "Positive Role Models\n\nvery little\n\nCharacters show a sense of entitlement, behaving snobbishly and superior to others. Kindness is shown by some, but their motivations are blurred. Felix comes from an ultra-wealthy, aristocratic family. He shows kindness to Oliver by taking him under his wing, inviting him to his family home. However, it's suggested that he sees Oliver as a \"toy\" rather than a friend. Oliver is in awe of Felix, his family, and their lifestyle -- to the point of obsession. He's willing to do anything to become a part of it. While most of Felix's family shows warmth toward Oliver for the most part, they do look down their noses at him, while Felix's cousin, Farleigh, treats him appallingly.\n\nDiverse Representations\n\nsome\n\nThe entire film is set within an ultra-wealthy and upper class British society. Most of the cast is White, although a prominent supporting character, Farleigh, is played by Archie Madekwe who is of part Nigerian descent. Farleigh is gay and his sexuality is openly discussed but never diminished or judged. Further racial diversity among party goers, as well as the staff that work at the estate with a conversation about race occurring off the back of this. Although the story centers around the relationship between two young men, there are a number of female characters who are given agency and are integral to the plot. The cast includes actors from Ireland (Barry Keoghan), Australia (Jacob Elordi), as well as England, and the film is written and directed by the female filmmaker Emerald Fennell. References to mental health, bulimia, and addiction, though these aren't explored in any great depth.\n\nDid we miss something on diversity? Suggest an update.\n\nSex, Romance & Nudity\n\na lot\n\nFull male nudity including an extended dance routine. Characters are seen making out and undressing each other. Some non-sexual nudity shown from behind. Two characters are interrupted having sex -- no nudity shown. A character spies on another masturbating in the bath. They then drink the remains of the bath water sticking their tongue in the plug hole. A character masturbates and performs oral sex on someone while they are on their period -- both are seen with blood on their faces. A character surprises another in their bed and proceeds to masturbate them under the sheets. A character pulls down their trousers and underwear and proceeds to \"have sex\" with a recently dug grave. A character says they were a lesbian for a while but found it \"too wet for me.\" References to \"threesomes,\" \"sucking off,\" \"hand jobs,\" and \"jerking off.\"\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for Sex, Romance & Nudity in your kid's entertainment guide.\n\nGet started\n\nParents need to know that Saltburn is a dark, mature dramedy/thriller with sex, full-frontal nudity, strong language, drinking, smoking, and drug use. Written and directed by Emerald Fennell (Promising Young Woman), it centers on young Oxford University student Oliver (Barry Keoghan), who finds himself drawn into a world of privilege when he befriends Felix (Jacob Elordi) and spends the summer with him at his aristocratic family's enormous country estate. Lavish parties are thrown with characters drinking and smoking to excess, sometimes to the point of vomiting. There are also several scenes involving cocaine use. Sex and obsession run throughout (potential spoiler alerts ahead). A character performs oral sex on a woman who's menstruating, and after someone masturbates in the bath, a character who was secretly watching drinks the remains of the bath water. After a funeral, a character \"has sex\" with the muddy grave. Several characters die off-screen; their bodies are seen, including someone lying in a bath full of blood with a razor blade beside them. Language is quite strong, with regular use of \"c--t,\" variants of \"f--k,\" sexual terms, and more. There are few positive messages or role models here, with deception, manipulation, and snobbery the prominent themes.
