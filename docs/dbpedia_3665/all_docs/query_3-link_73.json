        "text": "HOW #VMS WORKS SIMPLY SETUP * All client hierarchies approval workflows and approval limits loaded * All preferred vendors, vendor contacts, vendor SOW profiles, contractor profiles and required job profiles with rate cards are loaded * All vendor contracts loaded * All client contacts via manual or an HRIS system loaded * All active assignments loaded SOW or contingent and all required paperwork security clearances, background checks, personality profiles if required, credit checks and all contractor and SOW details. ASSIGNMENT MANAGEMENT * at the time of requisition all rules are adhered to preferred vendors are notified for candidate or SOW submission and do it in accordance with the rules set up * Time is entered in accordance with SOW‚Äôs or hourly contractors mapped to the approved rate card that information is entered on a particular schedule which then routes to the designated approvers * Performance management is tracked and compliance to the SOW also tracked * Attendance is tracked as is any overage on time ex 37.5 vs 40 hrs per week or worse 50 hrs a week. * Multiple assignments are tracked across multiple departments as is overtime to ensure fraud avoidance. Permanent employees are also cross referenced for conflict of interest or contractor assignments. INVOICING and REPORTING * invoices are generated by department either consolidated or by vendor the vendor also uses the system for receipt of invoicing * reporting on all aspects of this data is done in real time by department, by user, by vendor from performance to compliance It struck me that a lot of people don‚Äôt know how effective these tools are at fraud avoidance, compliance management, performance management and you can see how effective they can be at ensuring procurement compliance. When these tools were first developed the majority were vendor funded. That‚Äôs changed today as has the functionality to include enhanced applicant tracking via #AI and comprehensive reporting. There are policies, company wide rollouts, communication plans and timelines and project plans to be considered and training. This often involves stakeholders in the many thousands. My largest 40,000. In my career I‚Äôve done this over 50 times and I wouldn‚Äôt suggest you do it without expert guidance. Each time I‚Äôve found timesheet fraud in the many many millions. It happens everywhere. Now imagine the power some companies have that have been using these for years. They have the most powerful database of contingent and permanent employee candidates that exists because your proven contractors are your best source for potential hires. If they choose to use it. There are lots of tools to choose from but only 2 that I‚Äôd recommend. I‚Äôve written roadmaps and configured these tools my entire career dating back to the first #VMS a little company called White Amber who I worked for in 2000 so 24 years ago. Results extremely powerful. So when you hear the term #VMS now you know what it is.\n\nüíî Mourning the Loss of Susan Wojcicki I am mourning the loss of Susan Wojcicki, a leader whose influence extended far beyond her remarkable tenure as CEO of YouTube. Susan‚Äôs resume is legendary‚ÄîGoogle wouldn't be Google without her. Her pragmatic yet inspirational leadership, coupled with an insatiable curiosity, shaped the very fabric of the tech world as we know it. She was a visionary, a pioneer, and someone who always pushed the boundaries of innovation. What truly set Susan apart was her character, her kindness, and her ability to connect with others on a deeply human level. Susan had an extraordinary gift for making everyone feel heard, regardless of their role or rank. She cared not just about the work people did but about who they were as individuals, paying attention to the details that made each person unique. üí¨‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôll never forget a moment that perfectly encapsulated Susan‚Äôs curiosity and compassion. I was hosting her and her leadership team for an offsite with my Google team in early November. Susan noticed that I was wearing a poppy and, true to her nature, she was genuinely curious about it. She asked me why I was wearing it, and we ended up having a meaningful conversation about the significance of the poppy and my special relationship with my grandfather who stormed the beaches of Normandy. That simple exchange spoke volumes about her‚Äîhow she always sought to understand the world around her and the people in it. üå∏ Susan Wojcicki was a leader in every sense of the word, but more importantly, she was a kind soul who made the world a better place by caring deeply about those around her. Her legacy will live on, not just in the companies she helped build, but in the hearts of those who had the privilege of knowing her. Rest in peace, Susan. You will be dearly missed. üïäÔ∏è https://lnkd.in/giW_FzSs"
