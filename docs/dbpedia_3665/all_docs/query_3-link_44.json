        "text": "May the blessings of light be upon you,\n\nLight without and light within.\n\nAnd in all your comings and goings.\n\nMay those who love us love us.\n\nAnd those that don't love us,\n\nMay God turn their hearts.\n\nAnd if He doesn't turn their hearts,\n\nMay he turn their ankles,\n\nSo we'll know them by their limping.\n\nMay you live as long as you want,\n\nAnd never want as long as you live.\n\nMay you always have walls for the winds,\n\nA roof for the rain, tea beside the fire,\n\nLaughter to cheer you, those you love near you,\n\nAnd all your heart might desire.\n\nMay you have love that never ends,\n\nLots of money, and lots of friends\n\nHealth be yours, whatever you do\n\nAnd may God send many blessings to you!\n\nMay the Irish hills caress you.\n\nMay her lakes and rivers bless you.\n\nMay the luck of the Irish enfold you.\n\nMay the blessings of Saint Patrick behold you.\n\nFor each petal on the shamrock\n\nThis brings a wish your way\n\nGood health, good luck, and happiness\n\nFor today and every day.\n\nMay God grant you always...\n\nA sunbeam to warm you,\n\nA moonbeam to charm you,\n\nA sheltering angel, so nothing can harm you.\n\nMay you live long,\n\nDie happy,\n\nAnd rate a mansion in heaven.\n\nMay your glass be ever full.\n\nMay the roof over your head be always strong.\n\nAnd may you be in heaven\n\nhalf an hour before the devil knows you're dead.\n\nAlways remember to forget\n\nThe things that made you sad.\n\nBut never forget to remember\n\nThe things that made you glad.\n\nAlways remember to forget\n\nThe friends that proved untrue.\n\nBut never forget to remember\n\nThose that have stuck by you.\n\nAlways remember to forget\n\nThe troubles that passed away.\n\nBut never forget to remember\n\nThe blessings that come each day.\n\nMay the enemies of Ireland never meet a friend.\n\nMay the road rise to meet you.\n\nMay the wind be always at your back.\n\nMay the sun shine warm upon your face.\n\nAnd rains fall soft upon your fields.\n\nAnd until we meet again,\n\nMay God hold you in the hollow of His hand.\n\nHere's to you and yours\n\nAnd to mine and ours.\n\nAnd if mine and ours\n\nEver come across to you and yours,\n\nI hope you and yours will do\n\nAs much for mine and ours\n\nAs mine and ours have done\n\nFor you and yours!\n\nMay the roof above us never fall in.\n\nAnd may the friends gathered below it never fall out.\n\nHere's a toast to your enemies' enemies!\n\nRye bread will do you good,\n\nBarley bread will do you no harm,\n\nWheaten bread will sweeten your blood,\n\nOaten bread will strengthen your arm.\n\nMay you have warm words on a cold evening,\n\nA full moon on a dark night,\n\nAnd the road downhill all the way to your door.\n\nFor each petal on the shamrock\n\nThis brings a wish your way,\n\nGood health, good luck, and happiness\n\nFor today and every day.\n\nMay you have warm words on a cold evening,\n\nA full moon on a dark night,\n\nAnd the road downhill all the way to your door.\n\nMay there be a generation of children\n\nOn the children of your children.\n\nMay you live to be a hundred years,\n\nWith one extra year to repent!\n\nMay the Lord keep you in His hand\n\nAnd never close His fist too tight.\n\nMay your neighbors respect you,\n\nTrouble neglect you,\n\nThe angels protect you,\n\nAnd heaven accept you.\n\nWhen we drink, we get drunk.\n\nWhen we get drunk, we fall asleep.\n\nWhen we fall asleep, we commit no sin.\n\nWhen we commit no sin, we go to heaven.\n\nSo, let's all get drunk, and go to heaven!\n\nHere's to your coffin!\n\nMay your coffin have six handles of finest silver!\n\nMay your coffin be carried by six fair young maids!\n\nAnd may your coffin be made of finest wood\n\nfrom a 100-year-old tree,\n\nthat I'll go plant tomorrow!\n\nMay the saddest day of your future be no worse\n\nThan the happiest day of your past.\n\nMay there always be work for your hands to do,\n\nMay your purse always hold a coin or two.\n\nMay the sun always shine warm on your windowpane,\n\nMay a rainbow be certain to follow each rain.\n\nMay the hand of a friend always be near you,\n\nAnd may God fill your heart with gladness to cheer you.\n\nMay your troubles be less\n\nAnd your blessings be more.\n\nAnd nothing but happiness\n\nCome through your door.\n\nThere are good ships, and there are wood ships,\n\nThe ships that sail the sea.\n\nBut the best ships are friendships,\n\nAnd may they always be.\n\nBless you and yours\n\nAs well as the cottage you live in.\n\nMay the roof overhead be well thatched\n\nAnd those inside be well matched.\n\nMay the luck of the Irish\n\nLead to happiest heights\n\nAnd the highway you travel\n\nBe lined with green lights.\n\nMay brooks and trees and singing hills\n\nJoin in the chorus, too.\n\nAnd every gentle wind that blows\n\nSend happiness to you.\n\nMay you be poor in misfortune,\n\nRich in blessings,\n\nSlow to make enemies,\n\nAnd quick to make friends.\n\nBut rich or poor,\n\nQuick or slow,\n\nMay you know nothing but happiness\n\nFrom this day forward.\n\nMay you have food and raiment,\n\nA soft pillow for your head,\n\nMay you be forty years in heaven\n\nBefore the devil knows you're dead.\n\nMay your thoughts be as glad as the shamrocks.\n\nMay your heart be as light as a song.\n\nMay each day bring you bright happy hours,\n\nThat stay with you all year long.\n\nMay peace and plenty be the first\n\nTo lift the latch on your door,\n\nAnd happiness be guided to your home\n\nBy the candle of Christmas.\n\nMay green be the grass you walk on,\n\nMay blue be the skies above you,\n\nMay pure be the joys that surround you,\n\nMay true be the hearts that love you.\n\nMay the face of every good news\n\nAnd the back of every bad news\n\nBe toward us.\n\nHere's to the four hinges of society.\n\nMay you fight, steal, lie and drink.\n\nWhen you fight, may you fight for your country.\n\nWhen you steal, may you steal away from bad company.\n\nWhen you lie, may you lie at the side of your sweetheart.\n\nAnd when you drink, may you drink with me.\n\nMay the roof over our heads never fall in.\n\nAnd may we as friends never fall out.\n\nMay you have\n\nNo frost on your spuds,\n\nNo worms on your cabbage.\n\nMay your goat give plenty of milk.\n\nAnd if you inherit a donkey,\n\nMay she be in foal.\n\nMay you be poor in misfortune,\n\nRich in blessings,\n\nSlow to make enemies,\n\nAnd quick to make friends.\n\nBut rich or poor, quick or slow,\n\nMay you know nothing but happiness\n\nFrom this day forward.\n\nMay you get all your wishes but one\n\nso you always have something to strive for!\n\nMay I see you gray and combing your grandchildren's hair.\n\nA sunbeam to warm you, Good luck to charm you.\n\nA Sheltering angel, So nothing can harm you,\n\nLaughter to cheer you, Faithful friends near you,\n\nAnd whenever you pray, Heaven to hear you.\n\nMay you be poor in misfortune,\n\nRich in blessings,\n\nSlow to make enemies,\n\nAnd quick to make friends.\n\nBut rich or poor, quick or slow,\n\nMay you know nothing but happiness\n\nFrom this day forward.\n\nMay your heart be warm and happy\n\nWith the lilt of Irish laughter\n\nEvery day in every way\n\nAnd forever and ever after.\n\nThere are only two kinds of people in the world,\n\nThe Irish, and those who wish they were.\n\nHealth and a long life to you.\n\nLand without rent to you.\n\nA child every year to you.\n\nAnd if you can't go to heaven,\n\nMay you at least die in Ireland.\n\nCount your blessings instead of your crosses;\n\nCount your gains instead of your losses.\n\nCount your joys instead of your woes;\n\nCount your friends instead of your foes.\n\nCount your smiles instead of your tears;\n\nCount your courage instead of your fears.\n\nCount your full years instead of your lean;\n\nCount your kind deeds instead of your mean.\n\nCount your health instead of your wealth;\n\nLove your neighbor as much as yourself.\n\nGet on your knees\n\nand thank the Lord\n\nyou're on your feet.\n\nMay your home always be too small to hold all your friends.\n\nMay the most you wish for\n\nBe the least you get.\n\nMay good luck be your friend\n\nIn whatever you do.\n\nAnd may trouble be always\n\nA stranger to you.\n\nMay your pockets be heavy and your heart be light.\n\nMay good luck pursue you each morning and night.\n\nMay God grant you many years to live,\n\nFor sure He must be knowing.\n\nThe earth has angels all too few,\n\nAnd heaven is overflowing.\n\nMay you always walk in sunshine.\n\nMay you never want for more.\n\nMay Irish angels rest their wings right beside your door.\n\nAs you slide down the bannister of life,\n\nMay the splinters never point the wrong way!\n\nMay your troubles be less\n\nAnd your blessings be more.\n\nAnd nothing but happiness\n\nCome through your door.\n\nMay I see you gray\n\nAnd combing your grandchildren's hair.\n\nWherever you go and whatever you do,\n\nMay the luck of the Irish be there with you.\n\nMay the hinges of our friendship never grow rusty."
