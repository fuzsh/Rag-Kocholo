        "text": "Background Checks / Screening\n\nEmployees and volunteers help the church flourish and are crucial to our parish and school communities. Our parishes and schools must be safe places. There’s an assumption that churches and schools are filled with people who love children and can be trusted. How often do you find children wandering away from their parents and other adults at a parish or school event, whether to the playground or even the bathroom? Yet, in any place where a group of people is gathered, whether it be a parish or school function, a parish festival, or a regular parish event, there is always a risk of unwanted incidents that could harm children. Running background checks for ALL employees and volunteers can help deter criminals and sexual predators from participating in any parish or school ministry or event. If a criminal understands that they’ll have to undergo a background check, they will less likely attempt to volunteer. This helps weed out potentially dangerous people before they even begin serving.\n\nRegular background checks add another layer of security to keep kids safe. Not allowing potential criminals and sex offenders around children is critical. Completing background checks and rescreens protects children from harmful people and creates a safe environment for all. Background checks can also help identify adults who should not drive children and vulnerable adults.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Detroit uses the Michigan State Police’s ICHAT system for most background checks in our parishes and schools. The ICHAT is a simple process; it only requires inputting a person’s name and date of birth. We do not need a person’s social security or driver’s license number."
