Currently, it is home to a two day a week half-day program for three-year-olds, and a three day a week half-day program for pre-Kindergarten students.\n\nThe enrollment process for the 2020-21 school year will begin February 1, with church members and prior AGC families given admission priority. The preschool is open to community members of all faiths."
