        "text": "Ah, Sovereign Lord, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you.“I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me”? Jeremiah 32:17,27.\n\nWhen you are young, you’re always learning and growing. We should always keep learning and growing even if we’re 90 years old!\n\nDo you like to draw and put things together?\n\nDo you like to ride a bike? Learning is an adventure.\n\nAnd what about books and learning to read?\n\nWe love books. They take us to other places.\n\nCan dogs sit and read with you or join you in your Lego or train play?\n\nNo way. They’re animals. They can’t learn to read.\n\nIn the Bible, the first Book is called Genesis, we can read that “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1).\n\nGod is all-powerful. He’s all-knowing. He’s Everywhere at one time. “My God is So big, so strong, and so mighty, there’s nothing our God cannot do, for you.” This is true. Do you know this?\n\nWe learn this from our Bibles. It is truly Good News for all who will believe.\n\nGod created animals and man on the 6th day. But Adam, (the first man) and Eve, (the first woman), the Bible tells us were created\n\nIn His own image.\n\nIn the image of God he created them;\n\nmale and female he created them Genesis 1:27.\n\nThe image of God? What makes us different than the animals? As we already mentioned, we can build with Legos or read a book. We know that animals can’t join us in these things, except to get in the middle of it all and make a mess of it all.\n\nWe have eyes that can see, but we know an eagle can see much better than people. How about our noses? We love to smell pizza or homemade bread, but dogs can smell amazingly better than people.\n\nWhat about our hearing? Well, it is found that the moth hears best of all created creatures, as well as the elephant. This makes sense because Elephants have huge ears, but moths? Yes, they hear the sound best of all the creatures.\n\nBut think about the human hand. Think of all the things you can do with your hands. Talk about them for a bit.\n\nWhen we think of amazing hands, the Bible is a huge Book that reveals the greatest of hands, unlike any other. God’s hands. And God let us see His hands, even though we can’t see God,\n\nGod gave His only Son to us. He came from heaven to earth to show us God’s ways, to walk the earth with us. Do you know who I’m talking about?\n\nYes, Jesus came to earth to heal and to touch hurting people, but most importantly,\n\nJesus came to willingly pay a debt we owed. Do we owe a debt?\n\nYes, on the first 2 pages of the Bible, we learn the glorious beginnings of the creation of everything including Adam and Eve, (Genesis 1 & 2).\n\nAnd God created all the beautiful plants for the animals and Adam and Eve to eat. In fact, they could eat from every tree in the garden,\n\nexcept one. Or they would die. All the fruit is good for food, except the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. You can read it in the Bible:\n\nBut the LORD God warned him, “You may freely eat the fruit of every tree in the garden— except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat its fruit, you are sure to die Genesis 2:16-17.\n\nBut Eve was right there by the One Tree.\n\nAnd who else was there? A serpent.\n\nHe asked Eve, “Did God really say you can’t eat from this tree?\n\nYes, God did say. But Eve didn’t know God’s Word well, and she was tricked by the serpent and she ate the forbidden fruit. And then, Adam outright disobeyed what God had told him and he ate too. (Read Genesis 3 for this complete story).\n\nThen Adam and Eve realized, they were naked and they were ashamed. They never were ashamed before. They didn’t know they were naked. But now they do. And they hid from God.\n\nWho told you that you were naked?” the LORD God asked. “Have you eaten from the tree whose fruit I commanded you not to eat? Genesis 3:11.\n\nAdam and Eve had covered themselves in some itchy leaves.\n\nBut God covered them. With the skins of an innocent animal, He covered their nakedness.\n\nRight here in Genesis, the first Book of the Bible, God’s Word, we see a picture of Jesus and how He paid a debt and “covered” our sin. He is the “Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.” How do we know?\n\nThe Bible tells us so: John the Baptist in the New Testament, when he saw Jesus coming, said, Behold the Lamb of God!\n\nYes, He is more than a covering for the disobedience, shame, and guilt we all have. He paid our “Sin debt” in full.\n\nJesus willingly gave His life. He stretched out His hands for you and me. For everyone who will believe in Him, (an invitation to every person on this planet) will receive from the glorious hands of God, Eternal life. Life now and forevermore.\n\nFor God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life..\n\nFor God did not send His Son into the world the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through Him John 3:16 & 17.\n\nJesus is the Lamb of God who died in our place. He is God the Son. He didn’t stay dead. He rose again on the third day. This is the good news. There’s so much to learn in our Bibles.\n\nNow we can better understand verse 2 of Jesus Loves Me:\n\nJesus loves me, He who died. Heaven’s gate to open wide. He will wash away my sin. Let His little child come in. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me, the Bible tells me so.\n\nFaith is believing. Believing God.\n\nIf you don’t have faith, ask God to give you a willing heart to receive His invitation of love and grace.\n\nAlso found on Toni & Kids Sing Bible Youtube.\n\nI hope you know even better how Jesus really, truly loves you, especially you.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHelp for parents, grandparents, elementary school teachers, and more to talk to kids about God, His Word, and the Gospel message.\n\nJesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” Matthew 19:14.\n\nWhat Does God Say About Children?\n\nA small team of ours at present goes into the public schools for an Afterschool Good News Club.\n\nA little kindergartener came into the room and the first words out of her mouth were, “I love God!”\n\nSpending time with children is healthy and good for us all. We watch their joy, confidence, and curiosity. It makes us happy. It’s as if they sense God loves them before anyone tells them. The Bible tells us,\n\nWe all need to become like children and believe in God’s love. If you’re a child, be thankful to God! All your children shall be taught by the LORD, and great shall be the peace on your children Isaiah 54:13.\n\nYoung children and old alike learn and know well one particular song by the time they’re 2. Can you guess what that song might be?\n\nYes, “Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so.”\n\nTake a minute and sing this favorite song. Think of these words. Do you believe this is true?\n\nTo believe takes faith. Children have faith from an early age.\n\nJesus spoke of children and their faith in the Bible,\n\nJesus called a little child to him and put the child among them. Then he said, “I tell you the truth, unless you turn from your sins and become like little children, you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven. So anyone who becomes as humble as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven Matthew 18:1-3.\n\nI want to enter the kingdom of heaven, do you? We must be as a child. Why does Jesus say this? And what does this mean?\n\nBecause children believe Jesus loves them. This they know. The Bible tells them so! Children have faith. They believe in God. And they love to sing, Jesus loves me! These elementary things are the foundation that keeps our “house” steady and secure.\n\nHere is something God wants us to know about children:\n\n“Children are a gift from the Lord;\n\nthey are a reward from him.\n\nChildren born to a young man\n\nare like arrows in a warrior’s hands.\n\nHow joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them!\n\nHe will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates” Psalm 127: 3-5.\n\nThis is God’s Word. Parents and children are encouraged by it. Children are important. To God, especially!\n\nIt’s good to look in the Bible to find out what God says about something. God’s Word might be quite different from the attitudes and opinions of others.\n\nLet’s continue to sing the old favorite song: “Little ones to Him belong. They are weak but He is strong. Yes, Jesus loves me.”\n\nDo you and I believe this? We know we are weak at times, but do we believe God is strong?\n\nThis makes me think about another foundational favorite “little kids” song: “My God is so big, so strong and so mighty, there’s nothing my God cannot do. For you!”\n\nWe should never outgrow needing to think about how great and strong our God is. As adults, our troubles and trials become so large we forget God.\n\nGod is strong and mighty, He is God the Creator of the world and everything in it. He is Spirit. He’s everywhere at every minute of the day.\n\nFaith is believing in God. He is and can do impossible things, the Bible tells us so.\n\nI faced a very scary and life-threatening sickness, and God reminded me, that Abraham was counted as righteous by God because of his faith.\n\nYes, to believe God is faith. I asked everyone I knew to pray. We asked the mighty and powerful God to heal me completely, in Jesus’ name. It wasn’t overnight, but He did impossible things. He guided me in His word, He directed me, and He healed me!\n\nJesus loves us, and this we must know. The Bible will help us grow. It’s God’s love letter of hope and rescue for all His children, young and old.\n\nElla sang this for me. I think it’s a great way to end our 1st God talk. And I added Created to praise Him as well.\n\nIt reminds us, we are His special creation. Knit in our mother’s womb, created to praise Him. We are fearfully and wonderfully made.\n\nHappiness and joy are being like a child to know that very well!\n\nSee you next time.\n\nSONG: My God is so Big.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMost days, I wake up with praise to God on my lips, but as the evening comes, I often am tempted to grow weary and discouraged.\n\nWhen I say, “praise on my lips,” this means a “thank You” song or a psalm, hymn, or God’s Word on my mind, instead of situations, lack, or loss.\n\nBut when my body grows fatigued, my mind begins to dwell on the happenings of this world and life circumstances, faith flies away like a bird disrupted by a loud noise.\n\nHow we need reminders of good things and words of direction and help. God’s Word is our safe place to run. I often have kid’s voices in the back of my mind, singing the Bible songs God gave me, to help me throughout my day:\n\nAnd without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him Hebrews 11:6, NIV.\n\nIn the Book of 2 Chronicles 20, Jehoshaphat, king of Judah became informed of a huge army coming against them. Circumstances hit us like this.\n\nJehoshaphat . . . prayed to the Lord. He sought the Lord for His instruction, just as in Isaiah 55:6: 8&9:\n\nSeek the Lord while he may be found;\n\ncall on him while he is near Isaiah 55:6.\n\nJehoshaphat gathered the people. Then, he proclaimed a fast for all of Judah (2 Chronicles 20:3).\n\nThen Jehoshaphat stood up . . . at the temple of the Lord . . . and he prayed with all the people:\n\n“Lord, the God of our ancestors, are you not the God who is in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations.\n\nPower and might are in your hand, and no one can withstand you . . .\n\nIf calamity comes upon us, whether the sword of judgment, or plague or famine, we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our distress, and you will hear us and save us” (2 Chronicles 20: 6-9).\n\nWe must, I must do the same. I must remind myself of who God is and cry out to Him in faith. The time is now.\n\nThen the Spirit of the Lord came on Jahaziel . . . as he stood in the assembly.\n\nHe said: “Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the Lord says to you:\n\n‘Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God’s.\n\nGod’s Word reminds us of truth, when we often believe we must work it out with our own thoughts, as the kids sing the verses:\n\nFor my thoughts are not your thoughts,\n\nneither are your ways my ways,\n\ndeclares the Lord.\n\nAs the heavens are higher than the earth,\n\nso are my ways higher than your ways\n\nand my thoughts than your thoughts Isaiah 55:6,8-9.\n\nTomorrow march down against them . . .\n\nYou will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the Lord will give you, Judah and Jerusalem.\n\nDo not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, and the Lord will be with you.’”\n\nJehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the Lord” (2 Chronicles 20: 17-19).\n\nEarly in the morning . . . Jehoshaphat stood and said,\n\n“Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem!\n\nHave faith in the Lord your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful.”\n\nAfter consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the Lord and to praise him for the splendor of his holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying:\n\n“Give thanks to the Lord,\n\nfor his love endures forever.”\n\nAs they began to sing and praise, the Lord set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated” (2 Chronicles 20:20-22).\n\nThe battle you and I face today is not our battle. It’s the Lord’s battle.\n\nLet’s continue to infuse our minds and spirit with God’s truth. May kids from Toni & Kids Sing Bible restore faith, bring joy, and help us keep a song of truth in our hearts and minds today:\n\nAnd without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him Hebrews 11:6, NIV.\n\nSeek the Lord while he may be found;\n\ncall on him while he is near.\n\nFor my thoughts are not your thoughts,\n\nneither are your ways my ways,\n\ndeclares the Lord.\n\nAs the heavens are higher than the earth,\n\nso are my ways higher than your ways\n\nand my thoughts than your thoughts Isaiah 55:6,8-9.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt was a day, years ago, touched by the ever-living power of the Word of God, Psalm 95 had me pick up a pen and my slightly twangy guitar to put down a song.\n\nThe Lord put the gospel message on my heart as I meditated on His exhortation, “Come let us worship and bow down.\n\n“Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker” Psalm 95:6.\n\nWe all are created by God. And His greatest gift to us, He lets us decide whether to believe or not.\n\nHe desires we all “talk to Him,” seek His Word and spend time with Him. His love is so great. He is love.\n\nLove came down.\n\nJoy? It’s a gift of His Holy Spirit. When we turn our hearts to Him and call on Him (for who He is, the Savior of the world), we receive (His) love. His Spirit comes and washes our sins. He makes us a new creation, today, in Him.\n\nGod the Father gives us His love through His Son who paid our debt in full and gave us His Spirit as a guarantee.\n\nWe bow down, He turns the “light on” in our souls. He breathes in us His breath of life. We become whole, filled with joy.\n\nAnd we must not forget, peace. Jesus takes all our garbage and sin and gives us new birth.\n\n“In Christ,” we become new creations. Born a second time into life, here and now, and for all eternity.\n\nHis Spirit calls . . .\n\n“Come, let us worship.”\n\nTalk to the Lord, not half-hearted but with all your heart.\n\nIs it time to make Him your God, who lives and dwells with you?\n\nA Call to Worship and Obedience\n\nPsalm 95 Oh come, let us sing to the Lord!\n\nLet us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation.\n\n2 Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving;\n\nLet us shout joyfully to Him with psalms.\n\n3 For the Lord is the great God,\n\nAnd the great King above all gods.\n\n4 In His hand are the deep places of the earth;\n\nThe heights of the hills are His also.\n\n5 The sea is His, for He made it;\n\nAnd His hands formed the dry land.\n\n6 Oh come, let us worship and bow down;\n\nLet us kneel before the Lord our Maker.\n\n7 For He is our God,\n\nAnd we are the people of His pasture,\n\nAnd the sheep of His hand.\n\nToday, if you will hear His voice:\n\n8 “Do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion,\n\nAs in the day of trial in the wilderness,\n\n9 When your fathers tested Me;\n\nThey tried Me, though they saw My work.\n\n10 For forty years I was grieved with that generation,\n\nAnd said, ‘It is a people who go astray in their hearts,\n\nAnd they do not know My ways.’\n\n11 So I swore in My wrath,\n\n‘They shall not enter My rest.’ ”\n\nMake today, your day of salvation. Enter into the “joy” of the Lord!\n\nAnd make sure you tell someone about your new-birth in Christ.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhen the kids were young, we set out to memorize Psalm 139. Many years have passed and this Psalm is a continual “present help” to me in times of trial.\n\nSo, I wrote a song to sing in my heart when life seemed cloudy and dark. It’s called for now, “My Psalm 139 Song.” My in the title was to imply a personal connection for anyone who “sings” this song in heart and mind, or aloud with voice.\n\nDo you have a mysterious trial you are walking through?

He alone is able to transform our whine into a “new song,” because He gives us His Spirit when we receive Jesus.\n\nYes, Jesus.\n\nHe alone has power to give us a new song:\n\nBut thanks be to God . . . His Voice, His Word is greater and good, and able to transform our whine into a “new song,” over and over again.\n\nPut sound on this glorious song:\n\n“Sing to the Lord a new song;\n\nsing to the Lord, all the earth.\n\nSing to the Lord, praise his name;\n\nproclaim his salvation day after day.\n\nDeclare his glory among the nations,\n\nhis marvelous deeds among all peoples” Psalm 96:1-3.\n\nDo we choose to live as Noah in his day, focused “up” on the eyes of the Lord, finding grace and goodness? Noah “proclaimed salvation day after day” to unbelieving people who mocked and enjoyed the joke of his build of the ark and his message.\n\n4 For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise;\n\nhe is to be feared above all gods.\n\n5 For all the gods of the nations are idols,\n\nbut the Lord made the heavens.\n\n6 Splendor and majesty are before him;\n\nstrength and glory are in his sanctuary.\n\n7 Ascribe to the Lord, all you families of nations,\n\nascribe to the Lord glory and strength.\n\n8 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;\n\nbring an offering and come into his courts.\n\n9 Worship the Lord in the splendor of his[a] holiness;\n\ntremble before him, all the earth.\n\n10 Say among the nations, “The Lord reigns.”\n\nThe world is firmly established, it cannot be moved;\n\nhe will judge the peoples with equity.\n\nIn my distress I cried to the Lord, and He answered me. Deliver me, O Lord, from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue . . .\n\nWoe is me, that I sojourn with Mesheck, that I dwell beside the tents of Kedar [as if among notoriously barbarous people]!\n\nMy life has too long had its dwelling with him who hates peace. I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war” Psalm 120: 1,2,5,6,7.\n\nThe ancient Word speaks as if written today. They prove to be an accurate prayer from our heart at present.\n\nWe have not experienced anything the Lord has not walked through and experienced. The old hymn,”O Sacred Head, Now Wounded,” makes this clear in our mind’s eye:\n\n“With grief and shame weighed down. Now scornfully surrounded With thorns Thine only crown; How pale thou art with anguish, with sore abuse and scorn!\n\nOur Jesus, how He knows our sadness and losses, our persecutions, and abuses. He took all our shame and failures on Himself, on the tree:\n\n“What Thou, my Lord hast suffered Was all for sinner’s gain; Mine, mine was the transgression, But Thine the deadly pain;\n\nWhat is our response when we view so clearly His willingness to face our curse?\n\nDo we take a hard look? Do we see Him now?\n\n“Lo, here I fall, my Savior! ‘Tis I deserve Thy place; Look on me with Thy favor, Vouch-safe to me Thy grace. (O Sacred Head, Now Wounded. Based on Medieval Latin poem. Ascribed to Bernard of Clairvaux.)\n\nTogether, we speak aloud the next Song of Ascents as we press forward into 2021. We won’t lean on our own understanding, but boldly proclaim in an ever-growing faith:\n\nI will lift up my eyes to the hills, . . . From whence shall my help come? My help comes from the Lord, Who made Heaven and earth. He will not allow your foot to slip or to be moved; He Who keeps you will not slumber Psalm 121: 1-3, Amplified.\n\nWe can trust the Lord in all things. We remind ourselves these things:\n\nThe Lord will keep you from all evil;\n\nHe.\n\nWill.\n\nKeep.\n\nYour life.\n\nThe Lord will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and for evermore. Psalm 121: 7,8. A Song of Ascents.\n\nLaws are made by man to protect the people, but move to close the doors of God’s house.\n\nGod is Spirit. His Church is not a building. The hearts of His people speak in confidence continuously, . . .\n\ndespite the location:\n\n“I was glad when they said to me, Let us go to the house of the Lord! Our feet are standing within your gates, O Jerusalem . . . Pray for the peace of Jerusalem!\n\nMay they prosper that love you [the Holy City]! Psalm 122: 1,2,6.\n\n“We pray for the peace of Jerusalem dear Lord!”\n\nFor He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation,\n\nhaving abolished in His flesh the enmity, Ephesians 2:14,15.\n\nHe is our peace? Our peace isn’t good circumstances. Our peace is a Person! What is His name?\n\nGod saves us once from sin and death for salvation in Jesus. And to all who receive Him and believe in His name, He calls us His children. Children of God.\n\nHe saves us daily from our “natural selves.” Our brokenness, our anxieties, doubts, jealousies, hatreds, and our rage. Jesus calms the wind and the waves. He can tame our flesh. In Christ alone . . .\n\nThat He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity . . .\n\nFor through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father Ephesians 2: 16,18.\n\nWe’re not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. We have access by the Spirit of God to the Father. These are not mere “positive thoughts.” God’s Word, the Gospel message is the power of God to salvation.\n\nStep by step, breath by breath we speak, meditate, pray His Word, and become more and more empowered and hopeful:\n\n[Earnestly] remember the former things which I did of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God and there is none like Me.\n\nDeclaring the end and the result from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying,\n\nMy counsel shall stand, and I will do all My pleasure and purpose. . . Listen to Me. . . Isaiah 46: 3,9.\n\nHe, Jesus, keeps us in perfect peace when we keep our minds on Him! (Is. 26:3.)\n\nPsalm 123. A Song of Ascents. Unto You do I lift up my eyes, O You who are enthroned in heaven . . .\n\nInstead of worry, we worship and wait in ever-growing faith in God, the Creator of the Universe, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the lover of our souls:\n\nBetter is one day in your courts\n\nthan a thousand elsewhere;\n\nI would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God\n\nthan dwell in the tents of the wicked.\n\nFor the Lord God is a sun and shield;\n\nthe Lord bestows favor and honor;\n\nno good thing does he withhold\n\nfrom those whose walk is blameless. Psalm 84: 10,11.\n\nWe speak aloud and are changed from glory to glory being transformed by the renewing of our minds in Christ:\n\nBlessed are those whose strength is in you,\n\nwhose hearts are set on pilgrimage.\n\nAs they pass through the Valley of Baka,\n\nthey make it a place of springs; . . .\n\nThey go from strength to strength,\n\ntill each appears before God in Zion Psalm 84: 5,6,7.\n\nBecause He lives, I can face tomorrow\n\nBecause He lives, all fear is gone\n\nBecause I know He holds the future\n\nAnd life is worth the living\n\nJust because He lives.\n\nWe can rest in our Jesus. He is our hope and stay. Do you join me in an “Amen?”\n\nAmen!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMy heartstrings become “out of tune,” immediately when they’re hit with news of the world today.\n\nSo, I fight to think of something good. This hymn always rescues me:\n\nCome, thou Fount of every blessing,\n\ntune my heart to sing thy grace;\n\nstreams of mercy, never ceasing,\n\ncall for songs of loudest praise, (Come Thou Fount, Robert Robinson, 1758).\n\nThis is the prayer I can’t find to pray when I’m hit with sudden heaviness. I need a heart tune-up.\n\n“Come thou Fount of every blessing!”\n\nSo, I talk to the Lord,\n\n“Jesus, Your greatest work is You died on the cross, for me. For the “sins of the world, You are the Lamb of God.”\n\nI think of the two guilty men on either side of You, each on a cross. You were innocent, without guilt, shame, or sin.\n\nYet, one of the guilty men was changed in an instant. He watched You, listened to You, and he believed. And he rebuked the other criminal.”\n\nSo, I opened God’s Word to read the account.\n\nEverything became crystal clear to him:\n\nOne of the criminals who were hanged there was hurling abuse at Him, saying, “Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!”\n\nBut the other responded, and rebuking him, said, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our crimes; but this man has done nothing wrong.”\n\nAnd he was saying, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!” And He said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise”\n\n(Luke 23: 39-43).\n\nThis thief and liar was instantly changed. In the presence of the Lord, He watched. he heard. He believed. That’s what the Lord is showing me I must do. Everyday.\n\nMy heaviness and attitude are lifted and softened. I look at Jesus in His Word and hear what He says.\n\nThe hymn reminds me: I need continual reminders of the power of God, whom I believe.\n\nI’ve got to fight the fight of faith all day long with praise and prayer:\n\nTeach me some melodious sonnet,\n\nsung by flaming tongues above.\n\nPraise the mount I’m fixed upon it\n\nmount of God’s redeeming love (Come Thou Fount, Robinson).\n\nI went to a “melodious sonnet,” in Psalm 98. I discover again, my heavy heart becomes hopeful, with faith, to believe God is great again. I have thankfulness again.\n\nGod’s Word is living:\n\n“Sing to the Lord a new song,\n\nfor he has done marvelous things;\n\nhis right hand and his holy arm\n\nhave worked salvation for him.\n\nThe Lord has made his salvation known\n\nand revealed his righteousness to the nations.\n\nHe has remembered his love\n\nand his faithfulness to Israel;\n\nall the ends of the earth have seen\n\nthe salvation of our God” Psalm 98: 1-3.\n\nGod’s reminding me, “Keep your eyes on My marvelous works and pray to Me. Ask of Me!\n\n“Do you love My ocean? The sound of My rivers? My sunrises, My sunsets?\n\nLet the sea resound, and everything in it,\n\nthe world, and all who live in it.\n\nLet the rivers clap their hands,\n\nlet the mountains sing together for joy;\n\nlet them sing before the Lord,\n\nfor he comes to judge the earth.\n\nHe will judge the world in righteousness\n\nand the peoples with equity. Psalm 98:7-9.\n\nGod is Big. There’s nothing our God can’t do!\n\nThere is power in the name of Jesus. There’s life in His Word. This is my safe place.\n\nToday, will you join me to lift our eyes, and, yes, even our hands in faith and praise the Lord, together? Today,\n\nHere I raise my Ebenezer\n\nHere by Thy great help, I’ve come\n\nAnd I hope by Thy good pleasure\n\nSafely to arrive at home.\n\nJesus sought me when a stranger\n\nWandering from the fold of God\n\nHe to rescue me from danger\n\nInterposed His precious blood.\n\nProne to wander, Lord I feel it\n\nProne to leave the God I love\n\nHere’s my heart, oh take and seal it\n\nSeal it for Thy courts above (Come Thou Fount, Robinson).\n\nAs an orchestra, with eyes up, yes, and even arms raised, let’s be changed in an instant in faith of God through Jesus, His Son:\n\nHere’s my heart\n\nOh take and seal it\n\nSeal it for Thy courts above.\n\nTell someone of your heart change, your new attitude.

(For all eternity, to be exact.)\n\nIf you have a Bible on your shelf or can open an app on your device, it’s time to hear God’s voice instead of man’s highest wisdom.\n\nI sound so dramatic, don’t I? And I’m a nobody. I have no large platform. “Oh, Toni’s always telling us to read our Bibles. Isn’t that just like her?”\n\nNO! I’m not just talking flowery, or “religious” words!

He’s holy. Jesus came. He died on the cross, as the “Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world,” John 1:29.\n\nHis blood was shed to wash our lies, our impatience, our envy, our pride, our anger, our hate . . . all our sin away.\n\nIt’s time to believe in Him, the Rock of our salvation, and stop building our “houses” of our souls on fear and unstable foundations that continue to change, crumble, and fall.\n\nIt’s time to humble ourselves and agree with God, “whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” John 3:16.\n\nThe endless lies and “new” definitions about Jesus, family, humankind, marriage, babies, freedoms, justice . . . the Bible speaks on all of this in Genesis, Revelation, the Book of John, the Book of Proverbs, in all of the 66 Books of the Bible. Open The Book and hear it for yourself, not “hearsay!”\n\nI spent my whole summer meeting up with children and bringing them the story of Noah in Genesis 6-8.\n\nCan you believe, for 120 years Noah worshiped God, built an ark for a huge rain that no one believed would come, and told the people, “Come through this door and you will be saved from the destruction!”\n\nNo one listened. Everyone laughed and mocked, except his immediate family.\n\nNoah wasn’t talking about the “end of the world,” he was talking about a saved life in a new earth. Noah was inviting people for safety, security, provision, protection, covering—\n\nYear after year, month after month, day after day. Noah loved and obeyed the Lord.\n\nThe worldwide flood did come. We can go to the zoo and thank Noah he obeyed God and remained faithful to build the ark with the help of God’s Spirit and instruction. (Genesis 6-8).\n\nAs in the days of Noah, Satan is working overtime. Are there lies? Is there violence, stealing, and hatred in our world? What does the Bible have to say about Satan:\n\n“. . . He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies” John 8:44.\n\nWhat did Jesus have to say?\n\n“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” John 10:10.\n\nJesus told us He is life. We can read it ourselves when we spend time individually, intentionally, and whole-heartedly with Him.\n\nAs Noah, we are to “build each other up,” (not be tearing each other apart,) and talk of the wonderful works of God.\n\nToday, I talk about God’s greatest work. His gift of Jesus. He is the “Door,” to deliverance from evil, salvation, and life. He is the Good Shepherd. He is our only hope:\n\n“My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.\n\nAnd I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand.\n\nMy Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father’s hand.\n\nI and My Father are one” John 10:27-30.\n\nDo you feel the Lord tug on your heart? Is your soul thirsty for Living Water? Do you feel the need to turn around to the Lord of love?\n\nWe are at the last hour. There was a day when God said, “Noah, get on the ark.” And only days later, God shut them in. The time is short.\n\nDo it today. Make today the first day of the rest of your “eternal life,” and pray to Jesus,\n\n“Dear Lord, You have touched my heart. I need a Savior. I need to turn back to you. You alone can help me. Take my anger, my critical spirit, my hurts, my pains, my brokenness. Heal me, Jesus.\n\nTake my life and come in to make me new. I need “new.” Fill me with Your Holy Spirit.
