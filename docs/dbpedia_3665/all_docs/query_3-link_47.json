        "text": "1. Move Toward the Light\n\nWhen I was an airline captain, I would sometimes fly my Boeing 747 from Germany to the West Coast of the United States. On those flights west, across oceans and continents, the daylight seemed never to end. We took off in Germany at 1:00 p.m., and 10 hours later we touched down in California—at 2:00 p.m. the same day! The sun never set on us.\n\nThe opposite happened when flying east. Sunset came more quickly than it normally would. Leaving at 1:00 p.m. meant that in just a few hours we were engulfed in darkest night. Yet because of our direction and speed, in a few more hours we found ourselves bathed in blazing and often blinding light.\n\nBut whether I traveled west or east, the sun itself never changed course. It held its position, steadfast in the heavens, providing warmth and light to the earth. My access to that warmth and light depended on my location, direction, and speed. Similarly, God is in His heavens. He never changes. He never retreats. He does not alter His course.\n\nBut we do.\n\nWe all need God’s light in our lives, and yet we all have periods of time when we feel that we are in darkness—sometimes long periods of time.\n\nWhen those times come, we can be assured that God, like the sun, is always there. When we incline our hearts to Him, He embraces us and fills our souls with light, warmth, knowledge, and guidance.\n\n2. You Are Better Than You Think You Are\n\nEven the most successful among us need this message from time to time. Consider, for example, Fred Astaire—the iconic actor, dancer, and singer. He starred in dozens of Broadway and Hollywood shows. When the American Film Institute ranked the top 25 male film legends of all time, Fred Astaire was number five on the list.¹\n\nIn one of his early auditions, they said of him: “Can’t act. Can’t sing. Balding. Can dance a little.”² Those close to Fred Astaire knew that he was tormented with feelings of inadequacy. Even so, through persistence and hard work, he developed his abilities and became known for his “elegance, grace, originality, and precision.”³\n\nHe was not the only one who struggled with self-doubt or endured criticism.\n\nWalt Disney was fired from a newspaper because “he lacked imagination and had no good ideas.”⁴\n\nLast year, one of Vincent van Gogh’s paintings sold for more than $15 million.⁵ However, during his lifetime, Vincent van Gogh sold only a very few paintings—and most of them went to family and close friends.⁶\n\nWe find many similar examples in the Old Testament. The reluctant warrior and hero Gideon thought of himself as an ordinary farmer. He said, “My family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house” (Judg. 6:15). But an angel of God called Gideon a “mighty man of valour” (Judg. 6:12) and told him that with the Lord’s help, he would liberate his people from the oppressive yoke of a conquering nation.\n\nThe Lord took that self-doubting, humble farmer and turned him into a national hero—someone whose faith still inspires us today, more than 3,000 years later.\n\nThat seems to be the Lord’s way. He has always used the small and weak things of the world to bring about His glorious purposes (see Alma 26:12; 37:6).\n\nJeremiah believed he was too young to be a prophet (see Jer. 1:6–7).\n\nMoses doubted himself because he was “slow of speech” (Ex. 4:10).\n\nEnoch felt inadequate to preach repentance because, in his words, “all the people hate me” (Moses 6:31).\n\nThe Lord often accomplishes the most with those who feel the least accomplished.\n\nHe took a young shepherd and made him mighty in slaying an imposing giant and leading a fledgling nation into greatness (see 1 Sam. 17).\n\nHe took a young priest serving a wicked king and made him the leader of a band of refugee believers. Later, God called this same man to lead the entire church of the Nephite nation (see Mosiah 17–18, 23–27.\n\nIn our dispensation, God took a young, unschooled farm boy and mentored him until he became the great latter-day prophet who began “a marvelous work and a wonder” (2 Ne. 25:17; 27:26) that is now rolling forth unto every nation of the world.\n\nPerhaps, at times, we see ourselves as a little less than we are. Unworthy. Untalented. Nothing special. Lacking the heart, mind, resources, charisma, or stature to be of much use to God.\n\nYou say you’re not perfect? You’re not good enough? Well, welcome to the club! You may be just the person God is looking for.\n\nThe Lord chooses the humble and meek—partly because they are humble and meek. In this way there is never a question regarding the reason for their success. These wonderful, ordinary people accomplish great things not because of who they are but because of who God is! For “what is impossible with man is possible with God” (Luke 18:27, New International Version).\n\nGod does not need people who are flawless. He seeks those who will offer their “heart and a willing mind” (D&C 64:34), and He will make them “perfect in Christ” (Moro. 10:32–33).\n\nAre we susceptible to the same mistake today? If we were to brainstorm, I am sure we could compile a list of latter-day expectations that would rival those amassed anciently. It is not to say that these rules and gospel topics are not important or valuable. They are part of the whole—they are branches of the tree, but they are not the tree. And if they ever become separated from the tree, they will have no life. They will not bring forth fruit that will remain (see John 15:16). They will wither and die (see John 15:1–12).\n\nWhen we meet the Savior at the judgment bar, we will account for how we lived the two great commandments (see Matt. 25:31–39). We could use these commandments as a two-point diagnostic exam to evaluate ourselves as disciples of Jesus Christ and servants in His kingdom: How can we be better parents? How can we be happier? How can we better magnify our callings in the Church?\n\n1. Love God.\n\n2. Love our neighbor.\n\nYes, we cherish all the principles of the gospel. We “live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God” (D&C 84:44). And yet we must always remember that “all the law and the prophets” point to the two great commandments (Matt. 22:40). It is the foundation of who we are as His followers.\n\n4. Conflict Is Inevitable, but Contention Is a Choice\n\nHave you noticed that in many movies there comes a moment when someone says, “At least things can’t get any worse”? As soon as you hear those words, you know that things are about to fall apart. Do you ever feel like a character in one of those movies?\n\nJust when it seems as though we have faced all the trials and heartaches we can handle, bigger ones come along. These conflicts come in a variety of shapes and sizes: An unwanted medical diagnosis. A wandering child or friend. The loss of a job. The passing of a loved one. A global pandemic.\n\nSometimes we think how pleasant life would be if only we didn’t have so much opposition.\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ—our model of perfection—did not live a life free of conflict. He was opposed throughout His ministry, and in His final hours He was betrayed by a friend, accused by false witnesses, slandered, beaten, bloodied, and crucified.\n\nWhat was His response?\n\nTo some, He did not speak a word. To others, He spoke the simple truth—not in anger but with calm majesty. As others contended with Him, He stood in His place—trusting in His Father, calm in His testimony, and firm in the truth.\n\nHe that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention. . . .\n\n. . . This is my doctrine, that such things should be done away. [3 Ne. 11:29–30]\n\nWhen God speaks—even when He calls us to repentance—His voice is not likely to be “a voice of thunder, neither . . . a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but . . . a still voice of perfect mildness, . . . [like] a whisper . . . [that pierces] even to the very soul” (Hel. 5:30).\n\nAs followers of Jesus Christ, we follow this example. We do not shame or attack others. We seek to love God and serve our neighbors. We seek to joyfully keep God’s commandments and live by gospel principles. And we invite others to do the same.\n\nWe cannot force anyone to change. But we can love them. We can be an example of what the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is all about. And we can invite all to come and belong.\n\nWhen others throw insults at us, do we return fire?\n\nThere is a better way—the Lord’s way: To some, we say nothing. To others, we state with quiet dignity who we are, what we believe, and why we believe. We stand confident in our faith in God, trusting that He will uphold us in our trials.\n\nLet us emulate the gentle Christ. And we do that through learning to love God and reaching out to bless others. Yes, there will still be conflict. But our all-powerful Father in Heaven has promised that He will fight our battles for us.\n\nRecent Devotional Highlights\n\n“Above all else, we must trust God. Because knitting hearts requires molding into one the individual wills and hearts of each member of a community, it requires abilities beyond those of the most skilled human surgeon. In the end, it is a task that only God can perform. Knitting our hearts together requires that we trust Him completely with the one thing that is uniquely ours: our will.”—Kevin J Worthen (BA ’79, JD ’82), “Hearts Knit Together in Love,” Sept. 7\n\n“The Savior has commanded us to not be afraid, even when the unexpected storms of life are raging around us. This commandment is often easier to articulate than to implement. But, fortunately, the Savior has also promised us that ‘if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.’”—Peggy Sealey Worthen (BA ’03), “Preparing for Life’s Unexpected Storms,” Sept. 7\n\n“I would suggest to you that our use of agency, a gift from God, is not to determine whether the prophet is right but rather to choose whether or not to follow the counsel of the Lord as directed by the prophet.”—W. Christopher Waddell, “Stay Connected: Making It Safely Home,” Oct. 12\n\nIf not for the Atonement of Jesus Christ, such moments would drag us down, discouraging us from moving forward. Instead, the Savior invites us: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matt. 11:28). He offers forgiveness and strength to improve. Because of Jesus Christ, we can leave our burdens behind, resolving each day to better follow Him, the Perfect One.\n\nOur Heavenly Father is the God of new beginnings. Every day, every hour, can be a fresh start—an opportunity to renew ourselves in the Holy Spirit and become better at walking as true and faithful disciples of the Savior. His gospel is the good news that we can begin again; we can become new creatures in Christ (see 2 Cor. 5:17).\n\nI am not suggesting that we diminish or trivialize our sins and mistakes. We do not brush them under the carpet or try to hide them. On the contrary, to receive God’s forgiveness, we must confess our sins. Only when we fully and honestly acknowledge our weaknesses and failures can we learn from them and overcome them. We must humbly assess where we are before we can change course and progress to where we want to be.\n\nIn other words, we must repent!\n\nAs you partake of the sacrament, remember the covenant you made at baptism to take the Savior’s name upon yourself and to walk in the path of discipleship. Approach the mercy seat of God and, in humility, lay your sins before Him as an offering of sacrifice and plead for His mercy. Recommit to loving and serving Him and to loving and serving others. Ask for His blessing as you dedicate your thoughts and actions to His service—and you will feel the hand of God stretching out over you.\n\nThe God of the universe will infuse you with the strength and motivation to do better. There will be mistakes and stumbles in the future. But just as each sunrise signals the beginning of a new day, each time we repent, we make a fresh start on our path of discipleship. Over and over, day after day, we can begin again.\n\nGod yearns for you to come to Him. His mercy is sufficient to heal your wounds, inspire you to move forward, cleanse you of sin, strengthen you for trials to come, and bless you with hope, wisdom, and His peace.\n\nIf you desire it with all your heart, God will guide you through this mortal life, and He will wait with open arms to embrace you in the Resurrection. No matter our shortcomings, no matter our flaws, God can heal, inspire, and cleanse us. For He is the God of new beginnings."
