The maximum number of volunteers varies by site and session and FMSC reserves the right to alter volunteer capacity as it sees fit. Our online Volunteer Registration System will always reflect the current availability.\n\nThe minimum age for volunteering is 5 years old. For safety reasons, children under the age of 5 are not allowed to participate in packing sessions.\n\nWe recommend that groups of youth be third grade or older.\n\nFor schools, churches, sports teams, or other large groups of youth, please follow our student-to-adult ratio when registering:\n\nGrades K-2: 1 student to 1 adult\n\nGrades 3-6: 3 students to 1 adult\n\nGrades 7-12: 4 students to 1 adult\n\nPlease Note: Everyone under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult (an adult is someone 18 years of age or older).\n\nHIGH SCHOOL GROUPS\n\nAt least half of the required chaperones must be non-student adults (teachers, advisors or parents). If needed, a few 18-year-olds will be allowed to fill in as chaperones.\n\nFMSC staff members reserve the right to amend volunteer scheduling.\n\nI plan to bring a group every month. Is there a way to set up a recurring group?\n\nNot at this time.\n\nAssorted volunteer questions:\n\nAre masks required to volunteer?\n\nMasks are optional for all volunteers and staff. For more information, please visit cdc.gov\n\nWhat is the minimum age for volunteering?\n\nThe minimum age for volunteering is 5 years old. For safety reasons, children under the age of 5 are not allowed to participate in packing sessions.\n\nWe recommend that groups of youth be third grade or older.\n\nWe require the following adult to child ratios for school and church groups:\n\nGrades K-2: 1 student to 1 adult\n\nGrades 3-6: 3 students to 1 adult\n\nGrades 7-12: 4 students to 1 adult\n\nPlease note: Everyone under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult (an adult is someone 18 years of age or older).\n\nHIGH SCHOOL GROUPS\n\nAt least half of the required chaperones must be non-student adults (teachers, advisors or parents). If needed, a few 18-year-olds will be allowed to fill in as chaperones.\n\nFMSC staff members reserve the right to amend volunteer scheduling.\n\nHow do I get credit for my community service hours?\n\nPlease reach out to your local packing location for site specific verification information.\n\nCoon Rapids, MN: CInfo2@fmsc.org\n\nEagan, MN: eaganinfo@fmsc.org\n\nChanhassen, MN: CInfo@fmsc.org\n\nAurora, IL: aurorainfo@fmsc.org\n\nLibertyville, IL: LibertyvilleInfo@fmsc.org\n\nSchaumburg, IL: sinfo@fmsc.org\n\nRichardson, TX: RIverifications@fmsc.org\n\nMesa, AZ: Mesainfo@fmsc.org\n\nAre donations required?\n\nUnless clearly marked as a Fully Invested Session, donations are not required to pack; however, we humbly request them. Each volunteer packs about $50 worth of food. FMSC receives no government aid. We can only send meals as we have funding. FMSC relies on donations from volunteers like you. Nearly everyone is able to contribute something, but we leave the amount up to you. Many groups and individuals make advance fundraising a fun part of their service project. As you're willing and able, you may donate on the day you volunteer (by cash, check or credit card), or donate online before or after you pack. Please share this information with every member of your group and prayerfully consider the impact you can make.\n\nDo I need to arrive early for orientation?\n\nPlease plan to arrive 10-15 minutes prior to your packing session to check-in. Your orientation and packing instructions will take place during your scheduled shift time.\n\nAre we supposed to wear any particular clothing?\n\nWe highly recommend all volunteers wear closed-toed shoes. If you volunteer in the warehouse, closed-toed shoes will be required. Otherwise, please come in clean, comfortable clothes.\n\nCan we wear jewelry while packing?\n\nDue to FDA compliance for food manufacturing plants, NO jewelry may be worn in the packing room. Please review our Jewelry Policy and share with fellow volunteers.\n\nCan I volunteer if I'm sick/have been sick?\n\nIf you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, please stay home. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you must be symptom-free for 24 hours and it must be at least five days since the onset of symptoms. Please consult your medical provider if you need further information.\n\nPlease do not come to our facility to volunteer if you have any of these symptoms (excluding conditions related to seasonal allergies or known non-contagious medical conditions):\n\nFever or chills\n\nCough\n\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n\nFatigue\n\nMuscle or body aches\n\nHeadache\n\nNew loss of taste or smell\n\nSore Throat\n\nCongestion or runny nose\n\nNausea or vomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nIf you've had any of these symptoms within the last 24 hours, we ask that you reschedule your packing time.\n\nBegin by going to our main webpage at fmsc.org. LOGIN with your email address and password. Then hover over the MY ACCOUNT button in the top right corner and click on MANAGE MY RESERVATIONS.\n\nClick EDIT next to your group.\n\nClick RESCHEDULE\n\nClick on another time & date that would work for you.\n\nSpecial volunteer requests:\n\nMay we volunteer at a time other than your listed packing sessions? (i.e., earlier or later than the start time or on a Sunday)\n\nNo. We only hold food-packing sessions during each permanent site's regularly scheduled shift times.\n\nPlease note: All volunteers must go through orientation and training at the beginning of each session. Please arrive 10-15 minutes before your scheduled start time and plan to stay until the end of your session.\n\nIf we have already been through volunteer orientation, do we need to go through it again?\n\nYes. We want to offer the full volunteer experience to all volunteers, both returning and new, and we need to ensure that proper packing procedures are followed. Volunteers must attend both the FMSC orientation and the packing orientation each time they visit.\n\nMay we bring birthday parties?\n\nWe are honored to serve as the activity for birthday parties of volunteers who meet the minimum age requirements to be a volunteer! If you celebrate your birthday with us, you will receive a free FMSC t-shirt and an optional \"Happy Birthday\" serenade by fellow volunteers. Please note that none of our facilities can accommodate treats or gathering spaces. Please celebrate with goodies off-site.\n\nAccessibility for volunteers:\n\nAre there sit-down jobs for volunteers?\n\nYes! We reserve one of our most important tasks for sit-down volunteers. Volunteers can sit while labeling bags—this is a vital step to the packing process. This task entails putting our FMSC label on each bag before it is filled with food.\n\nAre your sites handicap accessible?\n\nYes! Each site is accessible and has a job for everyone!\n\nCan you accommodate special needs groups?\n\nWe ask that special needs/transition groups contact the FMSC Site Manager to schedule a volunteer time. Please do not register your group on the online registration system without contacting the Manager first.\n\nI have food allergies. Can I see a list of ingredients I would be exposed to in the packing room? If I'm allergic to one of the ingredients is there something I can still do?\n\nFMSC advises volunteers with food allergies to exercise caution when determining whether or not to participate in food packing. We are able to provide a complete list of ingredients in FMSC's food products, but we cannot guarantee the environments of our ingredients' manufacturing. Volunteers with extreme food allergies or allergies to any of the listed ingredients are advised not to pack.\n\nFinancial:\n\nWhat is a Fully Invested session & why do you require a donation for your special Fully Invested shifts?\n\n\"Fully Invested\" packing sessions take place on days when our sites are normally closed: Sundays or holidays. These sessions require all volunteers to support us with a donation of $63 per person or $189 per household. The $63 donation will fund 216 meals for children who desperately need our help. These shifts are designed for those who would like to help with their hands and also pay for the food they will be packing.\n\nEveryone who signs up for a Fully Invested session must acknowledge that they understand this is a special session that requires a donation. All of our other packing sessions that are not clearly marked as \"Fully Invested\" do not require a donation.\n\nHow much does the food cost?\n\nEach meal costs less than 30 cents to make.\n\nHow much of my donation goes to the food?\n\nFMSC devotes more than 90 percent of total donations to feeding kids. Less than 10 percent goes to fundraising, administration and overhead combined.\n\nWhere do you get your financial support from?\n\nMost of our support comes from individuals, followed by churches, foundations and corporations.\n\nDo you buy the ingredients for the meals?\n\nYes. We purchase all of the raw ingredients: rice, soy, vegetables and vitamin flavoring. The ingredients are one of FMSC's main expenses.\n\nDo you have any fundraising ideas or resources?\n\nYes, we do. Feel free to check out some fundraising ideas.\n\nFaith:\n\nDo you have to be a Christian to pack meals?\n\nNo. We welcome people of every faith to participate in our life-giving mission.\n\nDo you require delivery of a Christian message when the food is served?\n\nNo. Our food is given to the neediest children, regardless of their faith or whether a Christian message is delivered. All of God’s children deserve to be fed.\n\nDistribution:\n\nHow do you determine who receives the food?\n\nAll partners first apply for meals online. We evaluate applications for partnership based on the percentage of children being fed, funding availability and customs clearance experience before presenting them to the FMSC Distribution Committee for prayerful approval or denial.\n\nMeals are allocated to existing partners a year at a time, giving partners a stable food supply they can count on. Our first priority is to serve the requests of existing partners. We consider new partners as we have the capacity.\n\nWhere do you send your food?\n\nWe have sent food to nearly 70 countries in our history. Check out a visualization of where we've sent FMSC food.\n\nDo you feed children here in the United States?\n\nNot very often. Our meals were designed for the severe undernutrition that is more common in the developing world. Its taste and texture is not as well received in the U.S. When we get requests from domestic hunger programs, such as following a disaster, we send a sample box. This has not led to any large-scale requests. International hunger is “what we do best.”\n\nDo you sell the food?\n\nNo. All of our food is donated to the recipients. We do ask that the partnering (or recipient) organization pay for the shipping charges.\n\nPartners:\n\nAre you affiliated with any other organizations?\n\nNo, we are not associated with any other feeding businesses. We are not the same company as Kids Against Hunger, Feed the Children, Impact Lives or any other feeding group. We are a Christian 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. We are independently audited every year and have received an \"Exceptional\" rating by the Charity Navigator, indicating our organization exceeds industry standards and outperforms most charities in its cause.\n\nWho are your partners?\n\nHalal certification:\n\nWhat is Halal certification?\n\nHalal certification means our three MannaPack™ meal formulas have been examined and declared permitted or lawful for Muslim people to eat. Our meals are verified to contain no pork, meat slaughtered improperly or alcohol and have not come into contact with any substances that could violate Islamic dietary laws.\n\nWhy has Feed My Starving Children pursued halal certification?\n\nThe seal helps us achieve our mission: getting nutritious meals through to the children who need them most. FMSC distributes food in many countries where Muslim people are the predominant population, including Afghanistan and Somalia. To avoid any potential barriers in shipping, transportation, distribution and acceptance, we applied for and received the halal seal to print on our meal bags and boxes. It is a food security measure, along with many others we take. Throughout our nearly 30 years in operation, more than 99 percent of our meals have reached the children they’re intended to serve. We want to preserve that strong track record.\n\nDoes the halal seal compromise the Christian foundation of FMSC?\n\nNo. FMSC has not changed our Christian mission: to feed starving children in the name of Jesus. In fact, the seal helps us to serve better in the pattern of Jesus—across cultural barriers. We have changed none of our beliefs and, in fact, we pray in Jesus’ name over every meal we produce. The seal does not mean FMSC agrees with Muslim theology. It simply means the meals comply with Muslim dietary laws, nothing more.\n\nWhy does FMSC serve Muslim people?\n\nFMSC regards all people equally. We believe and practice Jesus’ teachings to love and serve everyone unconditionally. FMSC is called to a kingdom mission that transcends political or nationalistic alignments: to be the hands and feet of Christ on earth.\n\nWho declared the meals halal?\n\nThe Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America (IFANCA) carefully examined each ingredient in our three meal formulas, as well as the sources and suppliers of each ingredient. This process focused strictly on food content. There was no Muslim prayer or ceremony involved, nor has FMSC come under the authority of any Muslim cleric or religious law.\n\nDid you have dietary and cultural experts help with the process?\n\nYes. We were guided through the certification process by Dr. Joe Regenstein, professor of food science at Cornell University. Dr. Regenstein is an expert in halal (Muslim) and kosher (Jewish) food certification. A friend of FMSC who has supported our MobilePack meal-packing in Ithaca, New York, Dr. Regenstein recommended FMSC receive this certification to nullify any cultural barriers to our mission around the world.\n\nWill FMSC also obtain kosher certification?\n\nWe do not plan to pursue the kosher seal at this time because there is no identified need. We have not been asked for food aid by organizations working in predominantly Jewish communities or in the nation of Israel. We could readily apply for kosher certification if the need arises."
