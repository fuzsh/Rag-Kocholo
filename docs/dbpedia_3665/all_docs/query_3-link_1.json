        "text": "October 28, 2014\n\nMost of the time I stick to reading the predictable Young Adult fiction. I decided to step out of my comfort zone and read \"All God's Children,\" simply because the Westboro Baptist Church is 30 minutes away from my current residency. Finding out facts about the Westboro Baptist Church was the only expectation I had for this novel.\n\nAnd I was so wrong.\n\nThis book was AMAZING! The personal narrative sucks you in from the beginning. I felt like I could finally relate to a mystery protagonist. The stories and voices of all these different characters being woven together made this a \"good read\". The writing was well done, the characters were complex and interesting, and the storyline is thick.\n\nThe other thing that put this book over the top for me was the ending. I'm fine with predictable endings, just because most endings are predictable. But when an ending is unpredictable, it jumps up and grabs you. This ending is so unpredictable, so gut-wrenching, it's insane. I was mad at the author for days because I was so emotionally attached to her characters, and I was so angry at what they did. I won't spoil it for you, but I know if you read this you will feel the same.\n\nI have read both books in the Grace McDonald series and I WANT MORE NOW!!\n\nI'm in love with this author and I can't wait until she writes more books.\n\nMarch 27, 2016\n\nA powerful book and intriguing story reflecting rigorous research and social work insights of the author. Characters are likeable, compelling, and multi-dimensional. A cautionary tale about the way religious extremism impacts and distorts the normal development of children and the consequences of oppression. A must read!\n\nDecember 8, 2014\n\nI am absolutely stunned. I don’t like giving absolutes for novels, but this is one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life, and I am so grateful to be able to read this kind of profound literature. That’ll be the entire theme of this review: profound. I have never read something so thought-provoking that was also realistic, intensely gripping, and factual. I read the last half of this book within two days, because at a certain point putting it down is almost impossible. All of the characters are three-dimensional, and I was (and still am) very emotionally attached to them. The plot has nearly-masterful pacing, and the writing is some of the best quality I have ever read, with perfect one-liners that almost made me fall out of my chair multiple times with emotion, and the entire work is unquestionably unique in the best possible way. Overall, All God’s Children puts all other 10/10s I have ever given to shame.\n\nI was actually really nervous to read this book because of what it’s about. First of all, it’s the second book in a series, which concerned me. I did miss the big point of character development of what happened to the main character, Grace’s husband, but apart from that I feel this book could work as a stand-alone, so that wasn’t an issue. The other concern of mine was the sheer gravity of the topic of All God’s Children. This novel isn’t about just any religious cult, it’s about the religious cult. I know that Kraus’ research process was very hands on and extensive (read more in the upcoming interview), and it definitely shows through the plot of the book. Though sometimes the factual statements are not spread out very well and seem unnatural, I’m not sure there would have been a better way to do it, given that those facts are very important to the story.\n\nThe worrying part is that an issue like this, one that is so serious, controversial, and real, needs to be tackled in a manner so as not to take one side, but also not to down-play the issue itself. The main plot point is so sensitive that I was extremely skeptical it would be done well at all. Never have I been more wrong. Somehow Kraus acknowledges the horrifying nature of the Westboro Baptist Church without being one-sided or seeming anti-religious. She takes it a step further with David’s character, and actually portraying what goes on within the church compound. Though David is only an innocent child, the too-quiet utopian community David seems to live in has an underlying eeriness to it that is tangible between the lines of writing. We receive two very different first-hand accounts of the late Fred Phelps. David provides a mostly positive outlook with a few very symbolic scenes, while the brief appearances of Peter in the story show the dark side, the only one the public seems to see. The contrast between what the WBC is perceived as and what it really is, especially to the people who are part of it, is another profound theme of this novel.\n\nAs far as general plot points, everything Kraus writes about is gold. There are a perfect amount of sub-plots, creating a contrast between a more average mediation case and the one involving the WBC. The sub-conflicts also illustrate literary themes in the novel, such as maternity. Just when the novel seems on the brink of slow pacing, the climax hits, and my heart stopped. I wanted to race to finish the rest of the book, to find out what happens to the characters I had become so emotionally attached to, but I also wanted to devour it slowly and savor the amazing writing style. I have rarely felt such intense emotions for characters as I did in this novel, practically from beginning to end.\n\nOne thing that truly pushed this book’s score from a 9.8 or 9.9 to a 10 is that there is a character mentioned briefly in the beginning, with the most minor of conflicts that isn’t mentioned throughout the middle chunk of the book, and at the very end her small conflict is resolved. I don’t know why but for some reason this just did it for me. It shows how hard Kraus must have worked on the perfect timing of this novel, and that one plot point ties the entire book together. As far as the major conflict resolution is concerned, it is the perfect amount of “openness.” It is not so ambiguous as to create anger or frustration, but it is open for debate on exactly why it happened, what character’s motives were, how the characters will continue to live out their lives. In order to tackle a major national issue like this, the entire storyline must be perfectly executed. This is rarely done: but Kraus pulls it off almost flawlessly.\n\nThe characters in All God’s Children are remarkably written; they are extremely three dimensional. I feel the balance between the horror and humanity of the Westboro Baptist Church works because of the diversity in age of the characters. The story deals with mostly three generations: the older, the younger, and the child. David’s character is the one that stands out to me the most. Kraus is able to get inside David’s mind and put the reader there as well. His change from being practically a brainwashed robot to starting to develop the beginnings of thinking for himself doesn’t unrealistically happen right away, nor is it linear; it’s a process. Becca, Luke, and other members of the church create a conflict in the novel: was Mike even right in wanting custody over David? The anxiety that being with Mike causes David is difficult to read about, but shows that no one is solely bad or good in this novel.\n\nMike, Becca, Molly, and the other parental figures are fascinating to read about. They each provide a unique perspective on raising children, and what must be done for the greater good to improve their children. Margaret and Don, though minor characters that have little to do with the church conflict but are a big part of the overall theme of the novel, are also three-dimensional. I have yet to read a novel where the supporting characters feel as real as they do in All God’s Children. Perhaps Luke is the greatest example of this: though he is one of the members of the unimaginable Westboro Baptist Church, he is the perfect example of the beautiful yet terrible potential that lies within the minds of children.\n\nI wasn’t as much of a fan of the main character, Grace, as I was of the others. I couldn’t seem to connect with her as strongly, but that may be because I didn’t read the first novel of this book, which appears to me to be much more about her development than this novel. It could also be because I’m not a parent or a grandparent. She is a well-written character however, who is both realistic yet unapologetic. She does what she has to do, and that’s somewhat refreshing of a female character. She is far from a perfect parent, but no one in this novel is, which only enhances the point. In reviews I often discuss whether the plot shapes the characters in the particular novel or the characters shape the plot. In All God’s Children's case, I think it's a mixture of the two, a perfect balance of plot and character development.\n\nI’m sure with me gushing about the plot and characters, it’s pretty clear that the writing of All God’s Children is fantastic. One thing I often take off points for in novels is if the author poorly uses different points of view. In Kraus’ novel, she switches points of view from an older character, to a younger adult, to a child. She does this with ease, accuracy, and with amazingly different thought patterns corresponding to each character. I cannot express the rarity of an accomplishment like that, because many other authors attempt something similar, and each character sounds exactly the same. In Kraus’ case, each new point-of-view adds a new voice and perspective to the already deep and complex novel.\n\nKraus has a way of digging a knife into my heart, which every book-lover knows as the best kind of feeling. She has amazing one-liners that really impact both the story and the reader. I read this on the Kindle, and I highlighted more in this novel than I think I ever have. She effortlessly times her well thought-out symbolism and parallel events to have the greatest possible emotional reaction from readers. There is a perfect proportion of description and dialogue throughout the entire novel, so there is never a dull or insignificant moment. The narrative style sucked me right into the novel, and I didn’t let go until the very end.\n\nThe originality in All God’s Children results from a combination of a controversial issue as the main plotpoint, characters with a wide array of ages, and a special kind of writing style. Of course the obvious “uniqueness” to the book comes from the fact that not many people are willing to commit as Kraus does to research such a controversial issue. And if they do, rarely does anyone not fictionalize the event, or come up with a different name for it, or something of the sort. But truly, the literary elements and value that this book holds is the true uniqueness, because so rarely does one find a book rich in both suspense and thought-provoking ideas.\n\nOverall: All God’s Children by Susan Kraus, one of the best books I have ever read, is a thought-provoking, suspenseful novel rich in literary value. The three dimensional characters combined with a unique writing style, controversial issue, and the perfect amount of subplots make this book truly enjoyable. Finally, the emotional ending will leave any reader wanting more, and more importantly, wanting to debate the themes found in this profound novel.\n\nwww.goodbadanduglybooks.net\n\nFebruary 12, 2022\n\nSlightly shocking ending (no spoilers)\n\nGrace is a psychologist and a mediator/conciliator, with most of her cases handed to her by the court. In this book, second in a series but my first encounter with her, she's dealing with two, primarily. The first and main case has to do with a man who has recently discovered that a long-ago college relationship produced a son, and he now wants joint custody of the boy, who is ten years old. The main problem with that is that the child's mother is a member of Westboro Baptist Church, sometimes called \"the most hated group in America\". (You may remember the phrase \"God hates fags\" if nothing else.) She has married to a man within the church, who has legally adopted the boy, and the boy thinks of this man as his father, having known no other. They are staunchly against any arrangement that may take the boy away from the church in any manner, as members don't allow their children to associate with people outside the church, even though they attend local public schools and the older children may hold jobs within the community. A secondary plot concerns a couple who can't stop fighting over their joint custody and visitation rights, even though they were supposedly settled over a year previously. The wife continues to trash her ex-husband to their children until finally, in disgust, he takes the children and vanishes with them for several weeks. The book continues through several twists and turns through some odd revelations and some disturbing occurrences until a shocking event occurs. But the resolution is even stranger and the end has a twist that may shock you even further, at least mildly.\n\nI am absolutely no fan of the WBC, but I applaud the author for what I consider her even-handed treatment of them in this book. They are not treated as total villains, and there are explanations of their beliefs throughout the book. You may regard them as hateful or strange, which is absolutely within your right. I won't comment on how I think of them, but I'm sure the author's collaboration with one of the former members of the church who has long since left it was very helpful in her writing. Even Fred Phelps himself is not portrayed as evil or hateful, and the most visible members (to the outside world, anyway) are not even mentioned, or are mentioned only in passing. It was all very interesting, and I felt like I learned a great deal I hadn't expected to.\n\nFebruary 7, 2023\n\nI decided to start the year reading books with titles from A to Z. First up was All God's Children. It's a genre-crosser with elements of a mystery (involving an attack on a child) and a family drama (two custody battles, one more traditional and one involving a Westboro baptist mother). The main character (Grace) helps resolve both the mystery and the custody battles, all while adjusting to her new life, back in Kansas, helping take care of her grandson.\n\nKudos for having a main character who is a woman in her fifties and lots of diversity in the book. Grace's grandson has autism, her best friend is Creole (mixed race), a client is Latino client, and a policewoman is Native American. Westboro's attitudes towards LGBTQ+ are rejected by the other characters (the book includes Bible passages that counter the ones that Westboro sites).\n\nRespect is also due for having consulted expert and inside sources about Westboro. The author could have vilified these characters but she found some good in them - even in the founder, who was shown to be a nice grandpa even though he was rigid and vengeful man who believed in a rigid and vengeful God. As a psychologist and mediator, the main character didn't agree with Westboro beliefs and protests, but she worked hard to understand the Westboro characters and achieve the best possible outcome for parents and child.\n\nYou don't have to have read book 1 in the series before starting this one, but I would highly recommend it - if anything, it's even better! I've already bought book 3 in the series and am looking forward to reading it.\n\nI've already bought the next book in the series,\n\nMay 10, 2020\n\nIt is not easy to write a review of this book. Reminds me of a real patient fisherman. He plays with a fish for awhile...letting it get used to his bait...no rush...then, all of a sudden...HE HOOKS IT! That is what Susan Kraus does in this book. It is interesting. Too interesting to stop reading...but exactly where is it going. I mean, is it really going to be worth your time when all is said and done. She tells us about her life, her loss, her family, her abrupt move far away from her home, her daughter and her grandson. She lets us learn about her life and what she does for a living. Some of the cases she works on. Then, along comes a rather interesting case. And just when she is starting to land you - she's set the bait and is just starting to reel you in - making you think this will be an interesting philosophical dilemma - BANG - YOU ARE HOOKED AND IT IS SOME RIDE! It is a book that raises more questions than it answers. Makes you think longer and deeper than you like. But, in the end, you know it was more than worth it and you can't wait to read the next one. This is a perfect book for a book club as it raises so many interesting issues. A MUST READ!\n\nAugust 15, 2021\n\nI’m Susan’s social media person, but she doesn’t pay me to say nice things about her books (I do it anyway because she is a master at writing!)\n\nThis book had a different feel from the other two in her series, but I adored it nonetheless. While Grace is still a central character, the plot is mainly driven by Mike and Daniel, two characters I really came to love. Susan tackles a lot of difficult issues in this novel and her extensive research is clear in how she presents such controversial topics. The last 100 pages were exhilarating! I never saw anything coming.\n\nApril 17, 2021\n\nA therapist and family mediator is handed a custody case pitting faith, the Kansas Phelps clan cult, honor, duty and the rights of parents v. Children. There were no clear villains or heroes, and the protagonist realistically dealt with multiple cases concurrently with her own problems. This was a compelling, thought provoking book. I only deleted a star because I doubted the breaches of confidentiality.\n\nJuly 24, 2023\n\nBreath Taking\n\nThis is a difficult story. It sucks you in and you can’t put it down.\n\nMike a soldier suffering from PTSD and mTBI, finds out he has an 11 year old son. Problem is he wants joint custody and the mother and stepfather are members of the Westboro Baptist Church.\n\nGrace has to help come up with a visitation plan. Grace tends to go overboard trying to help her clients.\n\nAugust 5, 2023\n\nWBC\n\nWhat freaking weirdos. I had to stop reading several times to online research this group; I couldn't believe they were real. They have a FB page, but give no information on who they are. Steer clear of Wansboro, Kansas!\n\nAugust 18, 2023\n\nA Great Awareness of Others!\n\nIn this fascinating novel based on her actual counciling and mediating experiences, Kraus shares the reality of human discourse being resolved, in most cases, through professional guidance in a most informative and interesting manner.\n\nDecember 11, 2020\n\n“All God’s Children” by Susan Kraus is the second book in the Grace McDonald series that I’ve read. “Fall from Grace” was an edge-of-your-seat murder mystery. “All God’s Children” was totally different, but equally engrossing and well researched. Grace is a therapist and mediator and is assigned a custody case that deals with the son of a combat veteran with PTSD who didn’t know he had a son, and a member of the notorious, controversial Westboro Baptist Church. WBC, an extremist, fundamentalist group, has been called, “the Most Hated Family in America.” Yet Susan tackles delicate issues with grace and empathy. Nobody in this book is vilified. “All God’s Children” is a captivating, thought-provoking read, and I highly recommend it.\n\nFebruary 10, 2015\n\nTalk about a relevant and well-researched novel. Susan Kraus has written a real page-turner with this rare custody battle story laced with themes of religious tension and self-exploration. The Phelps family, who are notorious for protesting soldiers funerals (and who everyone should consider the zit on the face of humanity), come off as close knit and narrow minded, even if their stunts bring up one of my favorite topics: The First Amendment. I felt that even though All God's Children is a work of fiction, the stories of the Phelps children's upbringing was based in truth, which makes me sad. It's no surprise, with the author being a therapist and mediator in real life, that the story centers around human relationships, both functional and dysfunctional. The reader gets the feeling a lot of times that there's hope for the dysfunctional ones. There are stories of growth and of overcoming cultural obstacles in this book. The rituals and traditions of the Westboro Baptist Church are front and center in this custody battle when one of the Phelps own {gasp} gets pregnant by her short-lived boyfriend who leaves to fight in Afghanistan without knowledge of his unborn child. Upon return, he discovers he has a son and experiences the joys, and extra level of complication, that goes along with being a daddy to a Phelps kid. He deals with his feelings about that, his strong beliefs about the Phelps' activities and his PSTD. It's all interesting. All God's Children reads pretty much like a stand alone book so if you don't read the prequel - or if it's been awhile since you've read it - you won't be scratching your head over loads of missed plot lines, characters and details. But the characters are worth getting to know and the setting is very familiar if you're from a certain city in Northeast Kansas or another ;)\n\nNovember 26, 2014\n\n5 star book review at http://mysterysequels.com/all-gods-ch...\n\nThe second book starts a few years after the first one ended. Her two children, Molly and Alex are adults. Molly is back in town, with a small child, Max, and no sign of a husband. The child is autistic and suffers from Asperger’s, so Molly has more than her hands full with raising him. She needs help, and she needs her mother badly.\n\nSo Grace sold her business in Alaska and came back to Kansas to help Molly her very difficult grandchild.\n\nGrace is now back, juggling several cases, some more interesting than others. Her most interesting (and scary) case in this book evolved around the infamous Phelps family.\n\nBecca, a Phelps family member had a child with a Hispanic young man, Mike, some years ago. When she realized she was pregnant, she cut off all ties with Mike, and she never told him about the existence of the child.\n\nDavid, the 11 year old kid is now living happily as a member of the Phelps family. Mike, who recently came back as a war veteran, learned about the existence of the child and contacted Grace to mediate regarding his parental rights, to which he had no access for all these years.\n\nFrom here starts a very consuming drama involving all of them – Becca, Mike, Becca’s husband, and especially David, the innocent child. Everyone wants a piece of him, and the decisions involved will change all of their lives entirely.\n\nOverall I loved this second book as much as the first one. I am now looking forward to reading the first book and following Grace along her journey to finding herself again and coming to terms with her new life. I was glad to read that she has become a strong woman who can stand on her two feet and fight for what she thinks it’s right.\n\nJanuary 6, 2015\n\nSo, I finished Book 1 earlier and immediately had to read Book 2, All God's Children. I read the whole book in about 5 hours. I loved it. I am also wishing now I had saved it for Book club because wow did it spark a desire for discussion! This book touches so much on many dynamics of parenting and asked the reader to face some tough questions as the characters are faced with tough decisions. Also as a mother of an autistic child, I loved the side story of Max and Molly and how Susan Kraus managed to show a bit of insight into that world (she spoke volumes in a little), as a person married to a soldier the touch on PTSD spoke volumes in a little (I did feel that portion could have been furthered developed in the investigation but I don't feel the book was less for it not being) and as a Christian, wow did it make me face some questions (and just to throw it in as someone who lived in Kansas I love that both books mentioned it's not totally flat ;) ).\n\nSome final comments, I hope there is another book because I want to see some kind of resolution to Grace's relationship with her son Alex. Also, I love that Grace is not a perfect character, none of them are. She get's angry, has selfish moments, gossips when she shouldn't, is a bit smart-alecky and admits she isn't perfect. She asks repeatedly in this book if it makes her a bad grandmother and I say No, it makes her relatable and human.\n\nAs you see I loved the book and look forward to more being written\n\nApril 11, 2016\n\nI do not read as much as I would like because I am easily distracted, but this was not a problem at all while reading All God's Children, and I had a blast reading it. Because I went to school with several of the older Phelps children in Topeka, KS, I wanted to read this book. The whole custody dilemma was so interesting, and I enjoyed how the law always gave Grace McDonald the upper hand over the members of the WBC. I love the way the author had several stories going on throughout the book, and would bounce from one to another. As in the first book in this series, the author writes with a witty and sarcastic sense of humor, which I am very fond of. The book has an element of suspense that grows as you get more and more into the book, and peaks in the last quarter. This book has all the qualities needed to keep someone like me from getting bored or distracted. I cannot wait for the 3rd book in the Grace McDonald series.\n\nFebruary 11, 2015\n\nThis book I could not put down! It was so addictive! The way the author weaves the story of Westboro Baptist Church members (they are the ones who picket military funerals), a young military father, and the story of a crime committed in the community was so enthralling! If you need a diversion from everyday stress, this is the book to read!\n\nMarch 26, 2015\n\nThis was a really good book. It was hard to put down. It had some mystery, engaging and interesting characters and a fascinating story. We were lucky enough to have Susan Kraus attend our book club discussion. She was fun, easy to talk to and full of interesting background information. She answered all of our questions and we had a great discussion. Looking forward to her next book!"
