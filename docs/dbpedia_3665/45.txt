Cleaning closets, garages, under beds and in dressers, discarding what is no longer needed or that which has never been used is the beginning of many New Year rituals.

Some people set their sights on town-wide garage sale dates while others just pack up the car and drop off their unwanted items for charity.

According to All God’s Children’s Preschool Director Valerie Johnson, Mahomet residents are already dropping off items for AGC’s annual garage sale fundraiser.

The 2020 garage sale will take place on Jan. 25 from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Lutheran Church of Mahomet.

Aside from providing Mahomet residents with a way to give back through donating to the garage sale, it also helps to provide affordable items to those looking for gently used clothes, toys and household goods.

The long-standing January tradition has helped the preschool purchase supplies and equipment like markers, books and toys along with bigger items like a sand table and playground equipment.

Funds raised also allows the preschool to provide student scholarships.

Items that do not sell at Saturday’s event will be boxed up and donated to Salt & Light.

All God’s Children was founded more than 30 years ago. Currently, it is home to a two day a week half-day program for three-year-olds, and a three day a week half-day program for pre-Kindergarten students.

The enrollment process for the 2020-21 school year will begin February 1, with church members and prior AGC families given admission priority. The preschool is open to community members of all faiths.
