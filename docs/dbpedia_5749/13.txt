NBCUniversal is an American media/entertainment company, currently owned by Comcast. The company owns a large number of networks and local stations and is one of the leading producers of television programs.

NBCUniversal was formed in May 2004 by the merger of NBC and Vivendi Universal Entertainment. NBC owner General Electric initially owned 80% of the new company, while the French multinational media company Vivendi owned 20%. In January 2011, transactions were completed, which made GE a 49% owner, with Comcast Corporation taking over as NBC's majority holder, owning 51% of the company.

On March 19, 2013, NBCUniversal became fully owned by Comcast, following its purchase of GE's 49% stake.
