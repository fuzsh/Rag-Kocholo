        "text": "The major networks are unveiling their offerings for the coming television season to advertising buyers in Manhattan this week, at a series of events known as the upfront presentations. Money, prestige and cultural import are at stake. Two New York Times reporters who specialize in media — John Koblin and Sapna Maheshwari — assess what they saw during the NBC presentation at Radio City Music Hall on Monday, the first from the four major broadcast networks.\n\nJOHN Right before NBC’s upfront began, we got a reminder of what a strange affair these presentations are these days: CBS filed a lawsuit against Shari Redstone and is officially at war with its corporate owner, Viacom. So while NBC greeted us with musical performances (Jennifer Lopez, fronting a team of dancers, sang “Dinero” at Radio City), stand-up routines (thank you, Seth Meyers) and lots of glitz and pageantry, the CBS lawsuit was a sobering reminder what a precarious position media companies are in. But, hey, let’s party!\n\nSAPNA I felt a wave of déjà vu because I was just at Radio City a week and a half ago for another big media company pitch to advertisers — except that one was from YouTube. While J. Lo performed briefly today, the YouTube executives hired Ariana Grande, OK Go and Camila Cabello. The new media crowd also invited their thousands of attendees to a huge party right afterward on NBC’s turf — by the rink outside 30 Rock. Alas, that was not the case today.\n\nJOHN NBC used to throw a lavish upfront party, when times were better! This time we were subjected to a two-hour presentation meant to stir up good will toward the many brands that fall under the NBCUniversal banner, which, once again, did not work for me. What is the through line from the talk-show host Andy Cohen giving a shout out to “Bravoholics” — he did do this — to WWE wrestling and “Squawk Box?” I’m still dizzy.\n\nSAPNA Bravo will be dishing out more of the things that make it Bravo: “Project Runway” will return to the network, which will apparently also roll out five new real estate and design series, including “Sweet Home,” which takes place in Oklahoma City, and “Flipping Exes,” about a former couple that flips houses together. As one of my friends put it: “Interesting, Bravo taking on HGTV. Soon I will only need Bravo for mindless hung-over chatter.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
