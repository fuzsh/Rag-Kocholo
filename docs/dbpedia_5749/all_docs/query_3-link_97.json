        "text": "(Reuters) - Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal will name its upcoming streaming service \"Peacock,\" offering a broad slate of original content, including \"Dr Death\" starring Emmy and Golden Globe winner Alec Baldwin, the company said on Tuesday.\n\nPeacock, which will also offer classic sitcoms like \"The Office\" and \"Parks and Recreation\", is scheduled to launch in 2020, NBCUniversal said. The company owns traditional television network NBC, whose logo features a peacock.\n\nThe service will compete with streaming giant Netflix Inc and Walt Disney Co's upcoming Disney+ streaming service as well as other digital subscription options, as traditional media companies seek to attract online viewers.\n\nDetails on pricing and distribution will be announced closer to launch, the media company said.\n\nReuters had reported in January that an ad-free version of the NBC service will be available for about the same price as other subscription video services.\n\nPeacock will also have other shows such as a reboot of \"Battlestar Galactica\" and original comedy \"Rutherford Falls\", the company said.\n\n(Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"
