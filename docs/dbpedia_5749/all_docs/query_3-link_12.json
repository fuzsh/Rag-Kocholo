        "text": "NBCUniversal has unveiled a broad range of programming for the first slate of originals for its streaming service, which has officially been dubbed Peacock.\n\nPerhaps the biggest titled announced for the service is a reboot of the classic sci-fi series “Battlestar Galactica,” with “Mr. Robot” creator Sam Esmail executive producing. This is the third version of the series to make it to television. The original aired for one season in 1978 on ABC, which was followed by a short-lived continuation called “Galactica 1980.” Sci Fi Channel (now Syfy) then rebooted the series back in 2003 with a three-hour miniseries whose cast included Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell among others. The success of that project led Syfy and Sky Television to commission a new series with the cast of the miniseries returning. That show ran for four seasons and also spawned two TV movies, wrapping up in 2009. A prequel series, “Caprica,” aired on Syfy for one season in 2010.\n\nPeacock will also be home to a revival of “Saved by the Bell,” with original series cast members Mario Lopez and Elizabeth Berkley reprising their roles in addition to serving as producers. Likewise, the previously announced “Punky Brewster” sequel series starring Soleil Moon Frye has been ordered to pilot at the streamer.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn addition, the series adaptation of Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World,” which was ordered straight-to-series at the NBCUniversal cable channel USA Network, will now move to Peacock instead, marking the latest example of a media company moving a project from its linear cable portfolio to a streamer. “Dr. Death” — based on the podcast of the same name and starring Jamie Dornan, Alec Baldwin, and Christian Slater — has also been set up at Peacock with a series order, as has the limited series “Angelyne” starring Emmy Rossum.\n\nThe upcoming second “Psych” movie, which is titled “Psych 2: Lassie Come Home,” will debut on Peacock rather than on USA Network. An individual with knowledge of the situation said the film could play on USA Network following its debut on Peacock but no decisions have been made.\n\nOther originals include the comedy “Rutherford Falls” co-created by Mike Schur and starring Ed Helms, the pilot “Straight Talk” starring Jada Pinkett Smith, and the late-night series “The Amber Ruffin Show.” It had previously been announced that “AP Bio,” which was recently canceled by NBC after two seasons, will return for a third on Peacock.\n\nIt was previously announced that Peacock would be the exclusive streaming home of the NBC series “The Office” beginning in 2021 when the show’s current deal with Netflix expires. Peacock has announced that it will also stream shows including: “30 Rock,” “Bates Motel,” “Battlestar Gallactica,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” “Cheers,” “Chrisley Knows Best,” “Covert Affairs,” “Downton Abbey,” “Everyone Loves Raymond,” “Frasier,” “Friday Night Lights,” “House,” “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” “King Of Queens,” “Married…With Children,”“Monk,” “Parenthood,” “Parks and Recreation,” “Psych,” “Royal Pains,” “Saturday Night Live,” “Superstore,” “The Real Housewives,” “Top Chef,” and “Will & Grace.”\n\nThe platform will feature more than 3,000 hours of Telemundo’s content, including an original dramedy “Armas de Mujer.” Finally, classic films from the Universal Pictures and Focus Features libraries will be available, including those from the “Fast & Furious,” “Bourne,” and “Back to the Future” franchises. Universal Pictures is also developing original films and animated series to debut on Peacock, while DreamWorks Animation will create original animated content.\n\nPeacock will launch in April of 2020. It will be both advertising and subscription supported. Details on pricing and distribution will be announced closer to launch.\n\nRead the full credits and loglines for all of the Peacock originals below.\n\nTHE AMBER RUFFIN SHOW\n\nLogline: Each week “The Amber Ruffin Show” will showcase Amber’s signature smart-and-silly take on the week.
