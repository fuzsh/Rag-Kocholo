        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Who needs a “Plus” or a “Max” when you can use the plumage of a colorful bird? Such is the thinking at NBCUniversal, which announced on Tuesday that its new streaming service would be named Peacock.\n\n“For us, it’s the perfect nod to the legacy without being too on the nose,” said Bonnie Hammer, chairwoman of the upcoming streaming service. “From my point of view, it screams that we are proud and we are bold.”\n\nWhen Peacock makes its debut in April, it will join the growing list of new streaming services, including Apple TV Plus (Nov. 1), Disney Plus (Nov. 12) and HBO Max, which is also to start in April. These platforms will enter an increasingly competitive arena that already includes the established services Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime.\n\nTo compete, Peacock intends to have 15,000 hours of content from its vast library available on both its ad-supported and subscription-based services. Highlights will include complete seasons of “Parks and Recreation,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” “Cheers,” “Downton Abbey,” “Everybody Loves Raymond,” “Friday Night Lights” and “Frasier.” In June, NBCUniversal paid a $500 million to regain the rights to “The Office,” according to a person familiar with the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity because the terms were not public. The show will become available on Peacock in 2020.\n\nCompetition for older network shows has become fierce in the streaming era. On Monday, Netflix won the rights to “Seinfeld,” beginning in 2021, paying more than $500 million, according to two people familiar with the deal. In July, WarnerMedia secured the streaming rights to “Friends” for its service, HBO Max. And shortly before the introduction of Peacock on Tuesday, WarnerMedia said that HBO Max now has the rights to “Big Bang Theory,” the first time the long-running hit comedy will be available for streaming in the United States.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
