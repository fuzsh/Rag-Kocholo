Instead, a few highlights:\n\nKimmel arguing in real time with Former President 91 Charges, and quipping, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it past your jail time?‚Äù Kimmel was apparently instructed to not read the post on-air, but he did it anyway, and we are all better for it.\n\nKimmel roasting the Academy for not nominating Greta Gerwig and Margot Robie:\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòBarbie‚Äô was a monster hit. What an achievement to take a plastic doll nobody even liked anymore. Before this movie, you had a better chance of getting my wife to buy our daughter a pack of Marlboro Reds than a Barbie doll. Now, Barbie‚Äôs a feminist icon thanks to Greta Gerwig, who many believed deserved to be nominated for Best Director. I know you‚Äôre clapping, but you‚Äôre the ones who didn‚Äôt vote for her, by the way. Don‚Äôt act like you had nothing to do with this.‚Äù\n\nJimmy Kimmel roasting the Directors Guild of America for immediately folding during the strikes.\n\n‚ÄúWe were on strike for a long time, for 148 days. For five months, this group of writers, actors and directors, the people who actually make the films, said we will not accept a deal,‚Äù Kimmel praised. ‚ÄúWell, not the directors, you guys folded immediately.‚Äù\n\nCord Jefferson urging Hollywood to invest in smaller movies when accepting his Oscar for American Fiction (which is a wonderful film, by the way):\n\n‚ÄúI understand that this is a risk-averse industry, but $200 million movies are also a risk. But you take the risk anyway,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúInstead of making one $200 million movie, make 20 $10 million movies or 50 $4 million movies.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI want other people to experience that joy. The next Martin Scorsese is out there. The next Greta [Gerwig] is out there. The next Christopher Nolan is out there. They just want a shot. And we can give them one.‚Äù\n\nHE‚ÄôS NOT WRONG.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm Just Ken.‚Äù Perfect. No notes.\n\nNaked Cena.\n\nBeautiful people in beautiful clothes.\n\nBarbieheimer.\n\nThe playing of ‚ÄúP.I.M.P.‚Äù when Anatomy of a Fall won Best Adapted Screenplay (If you haven‚Äôt seen the movie, it‚Äôs a big part of the story)\n\nThe Bradley Cooper guest spot on the episode of Abbott Elementary that aired immediately after the Oscars.\n\nBUT HOW DO YOU SIDELINE LANCE REDDICK, TREAT WILLIAMS AND NORMAN LEAR?\n\nBut honestly, this series is all the Oscars you really need:\n\n@theangryinfj\n\nPoor Dear Pamela, RIP #filmtok #oscars #oscars2024 #academyawards #saltburn #barbie #poorthings #americanfiction #careymulligan #katemckinnon #sterlingkbrown #ryangosling #markruffalo #funny #series #movies\n\n‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Angry INFJ\n\n@theangryinfj\n\nReplying to @_skinnyem_ Part 5 There were too many clips from Bottoms to choose from #filmtok #oscars #oscars2024 #academyawards #poorthings #barbie #americanfiction #saltburn #bottoms #emmastone #ryangosling #movies #funny #series\n\n‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Angry INFJ\n\nMax is about to be the next streamer to crack down on password sharing, enraging parents of college kids everywhere.\n\nIke Barinholtz is no dummy.\n\nApparently, Jeopardy! isn‚Äôt Brits‚Äô cup of tea.\n\nYeah, I‚Äôm not sure people who have already had some success in the music business should be allowed to compete on The Voice. I also don‚Äôt think people with such stupid hair should be allowed on TV. I don‚Äôt know how you enforce either of these things, though.\n\nThere is a whole other universe in which De La Soul was the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, where I guess they slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars, too.\n\nApple TV has expanded its film offerings, adding more than 50 new movies, most in 4k.\n\nAnother day, another update on the mythical Community movie.\n\nWAR OF THE HOUSEWIVES: a bunch of Real Housewives have come to Andy Cohen‚Äôs defense against the allegations lodged at him by Leah McSweeney and Brandi Glanville.\n\nSounds like a Mandalorian movie is replacing a fourth season.\n\nThe creators of Evil have no plans to shop it elsewhere after being canceled at Paramount+.
