        "text": "NBCUniversal is going through another restructure.\n\nDonna Langley, who was Chairman, Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, is being promoted to oversee all of the company’s entertainment divisions including film and TV.\n\nSusan Rovner, Chairman, Entertainment Content for NBCUniversal’s Television and Streaming division, is leaving.\n\nMark Lazarus, Chairman, NBCUniversal Television and Streaming, and Frances Berwick, who is now Chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment are also getting promoted.\n\nThe moves come as Comcast President Mike Cavanagh puts his stamp on the company after taking over following Jeff Shell’s exit after an investigation into sexual harassment.\n\nCavanagh will continue to lead NBCU as President of Comcast and will not name a new CEO. Instead, he will hand responsibility to four operational heads: Donna Langley, Mark Lazarus, Cesar Conde and Mark Woodbury; and four key corporate leaders: Kimberley Harris, Anand Kini, Adam Miller and Craig Robinson.\n\nAs part of this new structure, Langley will oversee the NBCUniversal Studio Group, the NBCUniversal Media Group will be led by Mark Lazarus, and an expanded NBCU News Group will led by Cesar Conde with Mark Woodbury overseeing the Universal Destinations & Experiences Group.\n\nLangley will become Chairman, NBCUniversal Studio Group & Chief Content Officer. In this role, she will oversee the Film and Television Studios including Universal Pictures, Focus Features, DreamWorks Animation, Universal Television, Universal Content Productions, Universal Television Alternative Studios and Universal International Studios.\n\nLangley was previously Chairman, Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, where she was responsible for the global creative strategy and business operations for the motion picture group.\n\nShe has overseen franchises including Fast & Furious, DWA’s How to Train Your Dragon, Jurassic World, the Bourne series, Pitch Perfect, Illumination’s Despicable Me as well as Fifty Shades, Mamma Mia, Ride Along, and The Purge.\n\nLazarus will become Chairman, NBCUniversal Media Group. In this role, he will run the company’s TV and Streaming platforms, distribution and monetization. He will continue to run the television networks, Direct to Consumer business, including Peacock, as well as the NBC Sports Group and NBC affiliate relations.\n\nFormer Warner Bros. TV President Rovner took the role in October 2020 and has worked closely with Frances Berwick. She was in charge of programming across NBC, Bravo, E!, Oxygen, Syfy, Universal Kids, USA and Peacock and oversaw the teams in charge of development and current programming for scripted, unscripted, late night and specials as well as the first-run syndication unit.\n\nRovner has overseen hits for NBC such as Night Court and has lead originals on Peacock such as the critically acclaimed Poker Face, Pete Davidson’s Bupkis, The Traitors, which became a breakout reality hit, and the incredibly unusual Paul T. Goldman.\n\nAs part of the move, Berwick has been promoted to Chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment, a newly formed role reporting into both Lazarus and Langley. In this role, Berwick will add original content across broadcast, cable and Peacock to her current responsibilities running our linear entertainment networks.\n\nPearlena Igbokwe, Chairman, Universal Studio Group, will continue to lead the four television studios.\n\nCavanagh, a former investment banker who has been close advisor to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, has now taken over NBCU in the post-Shell era. Given that Cavanagh’s profile is far higher in finance and business circles than in Hollywood, initial speculation has been that he was a placeholder who would search for Shell’s successor. As Comcast’s former chief financial officer, Cavanagh has significant experience steering a series of reorganizations as NBCU navigates an increasingly hostile climate for traditional media companies, so the sense is that he has been entrusted by Roberts to take a firm hand with the entertainment operation.\n\nLangley has been with Universal since 2001, when she was named SVP, Production. In 2013, she was promoted to Chairman of Universal Pictures and later upped in 2019 to Chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group.\n\nShe has worked closely with the likes of CEO Chris Meladandri, who just recently delivered the biggest film of the year in Super Mario Bros., Jason Blum and his Blumhouse Pictures as well as, more recently, Christopher Nolan, whose next tentpole Oppenheimer, is being distributed by Universal following two decades at Warner Bros.\n\nNote From Mike Cavanagh\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nIt has been two and a half months since I stepped in to lead NBCUniversal, and I want to thank all of you and the leadership team for keeping the business humming during this time. I’ve had the privilege of spending time with many of you as I visited with all of our businesses. I’ve been deeply immersed in the day-to-day business of NBCU, which has reinforced what I already knew – that NBCU is a very special place with tremendous opportunities ahead.\n\nHere are some of my specific observations:\n\nWithout a doubt, consumer trends such as cord cutting and new competitors, particularly from the technology sector, present challenges for us. But I firmly believe that we have the business strategy, management depth, and financial strength to emerge as long-term winners and value creators as the media landscape evolves.\n\nWith that goal in mind, I’m pleased to announce a new leadership structure for NBCU that takes advantage of the strengths of our leadership team and the power of the business as a whole. I will continue to lead NBCU as President of Comcast and will not name a new CEO. Instead, I will hand responsibility to a core leadership team to work with me in pursuit of the opportunities outlined above. The new leadership team will be made up of four operational heads: Donna Langley, Mark Lazarus, Cesar Conde and Mark Woodbury; and four key corporate leaders: Kimberley Harris, Anand Kini, Adam Miller and Craig Robinson. This new structure will facilitate a streamlined decision-making process and foster even more collaboration across our company.\n\nAs part of this new structure, we will create the NBCUniversal Studio Group led by Donna Langley, the NBCUniversal Media Group led by Mark Lazarus, and a broadly expanded NBCU News Group led by Cesar Conde – plus the rapidly growing Universal Destinations & Experiences Group led by Mark Woodbury.\n\nDonna Langley will become Chairman, NBCUniversal Studio Group & Chief Content Officer. In this role, Donna will oversee a unified content strategy across the broad NBCUniversal portfolio, bringing together our Film and Television Studios. Donna will oversee NBCU’s suite of creative teams including Universal Filmed Entertainment Group (Universal Pictures, Focus Features, DreamWorks Animation) and Universal Studio Group (Universal Television, Universal Content Productions, Universal Television Alternative Studios, Universal International Studios). Donna has been shaping the cultural conversation and creating the framework for what a modern-day studio can accomplish through bold content, impactful marketing and business model innovation. She will leverage her longstanding relationships with the creative community and ability to partner with the most prolific storytellers in our business to unlock a seamless cross-portfolio creative strategy including programming, distribution and marketing across Film, Television and Streaming. Pearlena Igbokwe, will continue to lead our four powerhouse TV studios under the Universal Studio Group umbrella. Under Pearlena’s three-year tenure, Universal Studio Group has seen an impressive revenue increase and year-over-year volume growth. The studio, which has 108 active series currently airing or streaming globally, is consistently responsible for 5 of the top 10 broadcast series and several #1 series across multiple streaming platforms. This unique combination will leverage the creative power, talent relationships, and valuable IP from both film and TV.\n\nMark Lazarus will become Chairman, NBCUniversal Media Group. In this role, Mark will run the company’s TV and Streaming platforms, distribution and monetization. He will continue to run our television networks, Direct to Consumer business, including Peacock, as well as the NBC Sports Group and NBC affiliate relations. Mark will permanently oversee advertising sales, which will continue to report to Mark Marshall, Interim Chairman, Global Advertising and Partnerships. He will now also oversee our content distribution business, which will continue to report to Matt Bond, Chairman, Content Distribution. Together, these businesses comprised more than $20 billion in revenue last year. Mark’s decades of experience running television, sports and advertising sales – both within NBCUniversal and earlier in his career – will be critical to the long-term growth of NBCUniversal’s media business.\n\nAs part of this restructure, Susan Rovner has decided to step down, and Frances Berwick will be elevated to Chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment, a newly formed role reporting into both Mark Lazarus and Donna Langley. In this role, Frances will add original content across broadcast, cable and Peacock to her current responsibilities running our linear entertainment networks. Susan has agreed to remain with us for a bit to help ensure a smooth transition for her team and our creative partners. During her time here, Susan and her team have played an integral role in developing and greenlighting hit programming across NBCU’s entertainment portfolio, including brand-defining series for Peacock as well as breakout hits for NBC and the continued success of our Bravo franchises, almost all of which have seen year over year growth under her leadership. We appreciate all of Susan’s valuable contributions and thank her for all she’s done during her time at NBCU.\n\nCesar Conde will expand his role as Chairman, NBCUniversal News Group (NBC News, CNBC, MSNBC, NBC News NOW) to include overseeing NBCUniversal Local, which will continue to report to Valari Staab, Chairman, NBCUniversal Local; and the NBCU Telemundo Enterprises Group, which will continue to report to Beau Ferrari, Chairman, NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises. Under Cesar’s leadership, the NBCU News Group became the most-watched news organization in the country across all platforms and created the largest and fastest growing streaming news network. In his expanded role, Cesar will oversee NBCUniversal Local, which includes among other businesses 43 NBC/Telemundo stations across the country. He will also oversee Telemundo Enterprises, which includes its Entertainment, News, Sports and Studio operations. Cesar previously led NBCU International and Telemundo when it became the number one Spanish-language network in prime time for the first time in history. Based on that experience as well as his excellent record leading the News Group, he is the ideal person to take on this expanded role. NBCUniversal Local and Telemundo Enterprises Group will fit seamlessly with our News Group and will enable even more growth and collaboration across the division.\n\nMark Woodbury will continue to be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Universal Destinations & Experiences, where he oversees the company’s destinations worldwide, including Universal Orlando Resort, Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal Studios Japan and Universal Beijing Resort, as well as the company’s growing consumer products and merchandise group. Mark will lead the charge as we continue to expand our growing Destinations & Experiences business. This includes projects such as Epic Universe, opening in 2025, as well as new experiences in the works, such as the recently announced park specifically for younger audiences in Frisco, TX, and the first year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas, NV. Mark and his team will continue to bring our unique content and IP to life, and to be trusted stewards of great IP from external partners as well, such as the recently opened Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Hollywood.\n\nThis core leadership team will also include: Kimberley Harris, Executive Vice President of Comcast Corporation and General Counsel of NBCUniversal; Anand Kini, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Comcast Corporation and Chief Financial Officer, NBCUniversal; Adam Miller, Executive Vice President, NBCUniversal, who oversees Communications, Human Resources, Operations and Technology; and Craig Robinson, Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer.\n\nI’m very excited to work with this team to build on our great momentum and drive NBCU forward. Thank you to all for your efforts and hard work.\n\nMike"
