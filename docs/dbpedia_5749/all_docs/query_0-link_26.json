        "text": "Marlon Brando had a strange life.\n\nHe was French-Polynesian-island-owning wealthy and beyond-famous, of course, having made his mark during Hollywood's golden age as the epitome of the gorgeous, sensitive, vaguely dangerous leading man, decades before he played the titular patriarch in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather and firmly cemented his status as a living legend. Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Sean Penn, Javier Bardem and Ryan Gosling are a small sampling of the male stars who've worshiped at the altar of Brando the artist.\n\nHis gravelly voice, quirky mannerisms and brooding intensity became fodder for both loving homage and, eventually, parody. But the enigmatic actor's life also got off on an unstable foot, growing up with an alcoholic mother and emotionally remote father who split up when he was 11. The charismatic kid from Omaha, Neb., spent time in military school, where he became quite the prankster, and then made his way to New York to try his hand at acting.\n\nHe made his Broadway debut at 20 and won his first Oscar at 30, romanced countless women, including Marilyn Monroe, and over the course of five decades became a father to at least nine children.\n\nBrando didn't discuss his three marriages or many kids in his 1994 memoir co-written with Robert Lindsey, Songs My Mother Taught Me, stating that the book was in part to correct all the rumors and misconceptions about him for his children's benefit, so that they \"can separate the truth from the myths that others have created about me.\"\n\nMissing from the narrative, however, was the most publicly tumultuous chapter of Brando's sprawling family history to date, which had unfolded a few years prior to the book's publication—and the memoir's release came just months before the episode's tragic coda.\n\nMarlon Brando's Hard-to-Follow Family Tree\n\nBrando and his first wife, Anna Kashfi, had a long, bitter custody battle—one day, she slapped Brando in court in front of everybody, including reporters—over Christian after they divorced in 1959. Their son remembered the tumult vividly years later. \"I've been coming through those doors since I was a kid,\" Christian told the LA Times in 1991, referring to being in and out of court with his warring parents.\n\nThey were only married for a few years, and \"I think they married because she was pregnant,\" Sarah Broughton, author of the book Brando's Bride, about Kashfi, told Fox News in 2019. \"At that point, it was still very scandalous for a woman to have a child without being married. And it would have been scandalous for him, too, not being married to the mother of his child. He told friends that he didn't think the marriage would last. But he really wanted a baby, so he would give it a go.\"\n\nThe author noted how the newspapers at the time dutifully chronicled their tumultuous custody proceedings, which lasted for years. \"They were seen arguing in school and were just extremely volatile with each other,\" Broughton said. \"[Kashfi] testified in court she had broken into his house and smashed his table. On another occasion, he had broken into a hotel room where she was staying with her son and took their child.\"\n\nFirst Kashfi, who died in 2015, was given custody of Christian, but what a judge called her \"reliance on drugs and alcohol\" and related anger issues resulted in Brando being granted full custody when the boy was 13—the age at which Christian later recalled embarking on what would be his own life-long battle with alcoholism and drug use.\n\nBrando married Movita Castaneda in 1960 and they had two children together, son Miko in 1961 and, after the actor had married Teriipaia, daughter Rebecca in 1966.\n\n\"My family's so weird and spaced out,\" Christian told the LA Times in 1991, recalling summers spent working at his dad's hotel on Tetiꞌaroa, the French Polynesian atoll Brando bought in 1966, having fallen in love with the area while shooting Mutiny on the Bounty in Tahiti. \"We'd have new additions all the time. Like I'd sit down at the table with all these strange people and say, 'Who are you?'\"\n\nThough some reports from 1990 still referred to Teriipaia as Brando's wife, she had divorced him in 1972 after 10 years of marriage. Before Cheyenne was born, they had son Simon Teihotu Brando together in 1963.\n\nBrando later had three children—daughter Ninna in 1989 and sons Myles in 1992 and Timothy in 1994—with his longtime housekeeper Maria Cristina Ruiz, and adopted his longtime assistant Caroline Barrett's daughter Petra.\n\n\"My mom was his girlfriend for seven years,\" Petra explained in a 2019 interview for GoldenGlobes.com, \"and for over 25 years she was his right hand and best friend, she worked with him on location doing his dialogue and organized every aspect of his life.\"\n\nIn her 2005 memoir Marlon, My Love, My Suffering, published the year after he died, Teriipaia alleged that Brando had originally wanted her to get an abortion when she got pregnant with Simon, but she refused. She wrote that, despite their divorce and his many subsequent relationships and dalliances, Brando remained a dominant presence in her life for the rest of his, even when she tried to move on romantically.\n\n\"We lived terrible tragedies and we all suffered a lot,\" Teriipaia said in a conversation with her co-author Lionel Duroy for Paris Match when the book came out, according to Reuters. \"Marlon never spoke about it. I wanted our children, all our grandchildren to know our history.\"\n\nChristian Brando Faces His Fate\n\nChristian ended up pleading guilty to the lesser count of voluntary manslaughter in January 1991.\n\n\"This is a very emotional day for Christian,\" lawyer Robert Shapiro (who'd go on to be a member of O.J. Simpson's murder defense team starting in 1994) told reporters outside the courthouse. \"Not only has he admitted to a manslaughter, but he admitted it to the entire world.\"\n\nBrando, who had been in court on most days pertaining to the case, wasn't present for his son's plea, as he was \"in no emotional position to come out today,\" Shapiro said.\n\nThe plea bargain was agreed to after Cheyenne, who gave birth to son Tuki in June 1990,, was declared mentally incompetent, and therefore unable to testify, in December by a French court in Tahiti, where she had returned to live after Drollet's death. She had attempted twice to take her own life that November.\n\n\"She was placed yesterday under conservatorship,\" Cheyenne's attorney Michael Nasatir told the judge in Santa Monica Superior Court after the legal development in Tahiti, per the LA Times. \"She has been declared incompetent to handle her own affairs,\" including the care of her baby.\n\nHis son may have had his problems, Brando said, but he wasn't some spoiled rich brat, either. \"Of all my children—and I have nine—Christian is the child who from the very beginning has been the most independent,\" the two-time Oscar winner said. \"I've offered money to Christian and he wouldn't take it...He wanted his own identity and he worked hard to get it.\"\n\nFrom the stand Brando also tearfully apologized in French to Drollet's family.\n\nBefore being sentenced, Christian addressed the Drollets in court, \"I'm sorry. It's not my family, it's me. I'm at fault in this. If I could trade places with Dag, I would.\"\n\nL.A. Superior Court Judge Robert W. Thomas gave him 10 years in prison, six for the manslaughter and four for aggravating circumstances for using a gun, calling it \"a tragic situation for both families, for Christian Brando.\"\n\nChristian was released on parole in January 1996 after serving less than five years. He died from complications of pneumonia in January 2008 at the age of 49.\n\nBrando, who died July 1, 2004, at 80, lamented in an audio recording unearthed in the 2015 documentary Listen to Me Marlon, \"Christian was burdened with emotional disorders and psychological disarray, the kind of trouble that I had in life.\"\n\nThe killing of Cheyenne's boyfriend on May 16, 1990, and the crime's endlessly tragic consequences figured prominently in the film, director Stevan Riley telling British GQ, \"The terrible thing that happened at that house that night is the ideal intersection at which to cross-examine the themes concerning Marlon Brando's myth.\"\n\nBut those who loved Brando in life, warts and all, were happy to see what they felt was the real him come across after he spent his days alternately courting and shirking the spotlight, a paradox that resulted in more rumors and assumptions than anything else.\n\nThe actor's daughter Rebecca told the magazine, \"He would have been proud, I hope\" of the film. \"He knew those tapes would be found and used in some way—he was no dummy. I feel this was his document, his diary unlocked for us to discover. He could have destroyed them if he wanted to. In a way, the film is my father coming back to us, a very personal part of his legacy.\""
