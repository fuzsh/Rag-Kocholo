        "text": "-Netflix Won’t Share Crucial Data, So TV Producers Are Piecing It Together Themselves: Lauren Iungerich knows that her Netflix show, “On My Block,” was one of the most-searched-for on Google in 2018. She knows Netflix included it on a list of its most binge-watched programs that year. She knows how many Twitter followers the actors have, which she considers a sign of the show’s popularity among the young and social-media obsessed. But the one thing Iungerich doesn’t know is how many people watched the coming-of-age comedy, which debuted its third season in March. “I’m not sure what that audience is, but it feels like our show is important,” she said. In Hollywood, knowledge is power, and creators who deliver high audience ratings on broadcast and cable earn millions. But streaming has upended the old order by allowing companies like Netflix Inc. to rope off the viewer data that empowers writers and producers. In the first quarter, Netflix added nearly 16 million paid subscribers who had nothing but time during the coronavirus pandemic to binge watch “Tiger King” and “Love Is Blind.” With the rise of streaming, creators are unable to answer a very basic question: How many people watch their shows? On Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, viewer numbers are closely guarded. “They’re so secretive about their metrics,” star comedian Ali Wong, who had two buzzy Netflix specials, told Conan O’Brien on his podcast in March. “To this day I still don’t know how many people watched either of those specials.” Instead, Wong measures their popularity based on the attendance at her live shows. Before the first one, she couldn’t sell out a comedy club and put tickets on Groupon; after the first special premiered, her next show sold out in two minutes. Nielsen, which for decades guided executives with its ratings estimates, is trying to count viewers on streaming services, but the services have disputed the findings and say that audience size is only one metric they use to decide whether to keep a show alive. Since last year, Netflix has started sharing some viewership data with producers and creators, such as the number of households that watch two minutes of a movie or one episode of a series and how many watch 90% of a movie or one season of a show in the first seven and 28 days. Hulu, owned by Walt Disney Co., doesn’t share weekly viewership numbers with show creators, but does relay audience trends, like how many subscribers were still watching a show after three episodes or where they dropped off. Amazon.com Inc. didn’t respond to requests for comment. For some showrunners, the ignorance is bliss. They say they do their best work without the pressure of ratings. For others, knowing how many people are watching is valuable when negotiating. It’s also human nature. Which is why some TV people have developed their own highly unscientific methods for determining if their shows have entered the zeitgeist.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-06/how-many-people-watch-netflix-shows-tv-producers-don-t-know\n\n-L.A.’s Video Game Industry Becomes a Safe Haven in Times of Uncertainty: It's hard to believe that residents across vast areas of the U.S. are about to enter their third month of quarantine as a result of COVID-19. With millions of businesses forced into complete shutdown during these unprecedented times, there have been few, if any, positive outlooks for any industry. But hidden amongst dispirited stories across hospitality, real estate, retail and many other markets, there are glimmers of hope for industries that this crisis may actually be a catalyst for. Gaming is undoubtedly one of the markets seeing an uplift during the pandemic. According to Verizon, video game internet traffic is up 75%, while 95% of the country shelters at home. Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard, one of the gaming industry’s largest holding companies, has seen its stock go up around 10% so far in 2020, while the S&P 500 has dropped around 15%. Well over half of Americans are gamers and during this crisis, which is taking as much of a mental toll as a physical one, there is no better medium for escaping our current reality. However, the amount of time on consumers’ hands is increasing their desire for experiences that extend beyond the status quo. A rct studio survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers found that right around 1-in-3 people are bored of the same entertainment options during the quarantine and are searching out new virtual experiences as they shelter at home. In this sense, gaming will likely be the gateway during this crisis to new VR experiences. In doing so, it may finally bring VR mainstream. Here’s three reasons why I think that will happen. While the percentage of VR gamers continues to only hover in single-digit percentages, the crisis has shifted the use of VR technology from a nice-to-try to a need-to-have. Can't access your favorite gym? No worries, you can access a better workout with your Oculus Quest. With movie theatres shuttered, theme parks closed and concert halls muted, it turns out VR is one of the few technologies that can keep the entertainment industry relevant in these trying times. Our own research shows that the use of AR and VR is up 49% during the pandemic. Additionally, the latest Steam data shows over one million active VR users in March alone. Through their headsets, consumers can embark on exhilarating journeys that may not even be possible in post-COVID-19 times. Whether it’s taking in the sites at Machu Picchu or diving into the action-packed survival horror game Half-Life, the relief experienced through VR right now from societal anxieties is enormous. And for developers of VR headsets, supply is buckling under this unprecedented demand. Devices like the Oculus Quest — which retails between $399.99 and $499.99 — have become virtually impossible to buy without paying a huge markup. These prices will likely continue to rise the further the quarantine is extended and consumers’ appetite for novel forms of entertainment grows. If interacting with our physical communities continues to be a challenge as we respond to COVID-19, we shouldn't expect any of these VR gaming needs or demands to dwindle. More than 7 in 10 online gamers in the UK and U.S. have noted they feel part of a gaming community. Never has this community been as critical as consumers seek out some connection amid lockdown and separation. New virtual landscapes will offer even more opportunities for connection that feels human. Next-generation VR environments are already being built with new ways for players to communicate and collectively alter storylines in real-time while they explore virtual worlds.\n\nhttps://dot.la/column-ttkktkt-2645917034.html?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2\n\n-Coronavirus May Force Disney to Reevaluate Streaming Strategy: Movie theaters may be closed due the coronavirus pandemic, but The Walt Disney Company says it still believes that cinemas are a critical component in the rollout of its big blockbusters. However, Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Chapek did acknowledge that the disruptions caused by the public health crisis may require the company to send more movies to its streaming service Disney Plus or to have them debut on premium video-on-demand (PVOD). “We very much believe in the value of the theatrical experience overall for large blockbuster movies,” Chapek told analysts and investors on Tuesday. “We also realize that either because of changing and evolving consumer dynamics or because of certain situations like COVID, we may have to make some changes to that overall strategy just because theaters aren’t open or aren’t open to the extent that anyone needs to be financially viable.” The Disney chief’s comments come as other competitors such as Universal have more fully embraced PVOD, debuting films such as “Trolls World Tour” that was once intended to bow in theaters, in the home. With cinemas closed, Disney has re-scheduled most of its major upcoming releases, such as “Mulan” and “Black Widow.” There was one exception: “Artemis Fowl,” an adaptation of a popular tween book series, will instead debut on Disney Plus. Chapek said that was due to the film’s “demographic appeal.” “We’re going to evaluate each one of our movies on a case-by-case situation,” he said. The Disney chief also addressed the production shutdown for the company’s films and television shows. He noted that he wasn’t certain when it would be safe for people to return to sets, but predicted that when they do, there will be new safety regulations. “We’ve got no projections of exactly when we can do that, but we will be very responsible in terms of masks and the same type of procedures that we would hope to implement into our parks,” Chapek said. Disney announced that it will reopen its resort in Shanghai on May 11, but there will be changes to the customer experience. In addition to reducing the number of guests in the park, there will be temperature checks and customers will be required to wear masks.\n\nhttps://variety.com/2020/film/news/disney-coronavirus-movies-streaming-1234598851/\n\n-Global Recorded-Music Revenues Topped $20 Billion in 2019, but Streaming Growth Is Slowing: With the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy, any look back at 2019 financial performance feels like an exercise in nostalgia, but the data released by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry on Monday shows that the streaming boom’s impact on recorded-music revenues was already starting to level off. For 2019, total revenues for the global recorded-music business grew by 8.2% to $20.2 billion, with streaming revenue growing 22.9% to $11.4 billion — accounting for more than half of total revenue for the first time, at 56%. Physical sales continued their long decline, but at a slower rate — 5.3% — than in 2018. The growth was powered by a 24.1% increase in paid subscription streaming with nearly all markets reporting growth. There were 341 million users of paid streaming services at the end of 2019 — up 33.5% — with paid streaming accounting for 42% of total recorded music revenue. Taylor Swift was the world’s top-selling artist for the year, as announced by the IFPI in March.\n\nhttps://variety.com/2020/biz/news/global-music-revenues-20-billion-streaming-slowing-1234596953/\n\n-Pluto TV And Verizon Break Ground With Streaming Distribution Agreement: EXCLUSIVE: Pluto TV and Verizon are breaking some new ground in streaming, unveiling what they call the industry’s first comprehensive distribution deal spanning pay-TV, connected TV and mobile, Deadline has learned. Both parties remained tight-lipped about financial terms. Pluto, the free, ad-supported service owned by ViacomCBS, has more than 20 million monthly viewers. Under the deal, it will have placement across Verizon’s wireless network, which is the largest in the U.S., as well as on its connected platforms like Stream TV and on its pay-TV service FiOS. Along with rival AT&T, Verizon has been emphasizing 5G technology via its Ultra WIdeband network, which the telecom giant says will be a vital backbone for streaming over the coming years. Verizon has just shy of 116 million wireless customers, plus 4 million video subscribers on FiOS and another 6 million FiOS broadband customers. Viacom paid $340 million to acquire Pluto in January 2019. At that time, it had about 12 million monthly active users. Backed by an expanded parent company after the late-2019 merger of Viacom and CBS, Pluto has increased its additions of new channels, which now number in the hundreds. The streaming service expects to end 2020 with more than 30 million monthly viewers. An editorial team of curators at Pluto work to ensure that the branded channels it carries (AMC Networks just announced four new ones last week) do not interfere with existing carriage agreements with pay-TV operators. Channels, which are displayed in a linear-TV-like programming grid, are often geared toward show brands or characters, with recent ones centering on the James Bond franchise, The Walking Dead and MTV’s The Challenge.\n\nhttps://deadline.com/2020/05/pluto-tv-verizon-streaming-distribution-deal-5g-1202925273/\n\n-Golden Globes Sets New Foreign Language Film Eligibility Rules: The Hollywood Foreign Press Association has made additional temporary changes for the 93rd Golden Globes. The organization behind the annual award show announced Friday adjustments to the foreign language motion picture category. In the past, movies had to be released in their country of origin during the 15-month period — from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31 of the following year — prior to the awards. But in the wake of the coronavirus and the closure of movie theaters, the HFPA has suspended the criteria for the 2021 show. The HFPA has already implemented similar rule changes for all other categories. The temporary new rule states: “Foreign-language motion pictures that had a bona fide theatrical release planned to begin in their country of origin during the period from March 15 until a date to be determined by HFPA when cinemas in that country have generally reopened, may instead be released in any country in any format (e.g. a motion picture format such as in theatres or on pay-per-view or a television format such as subscription streaming service, subscription cable channel, broadcast television, etc.) and will still be eligible for the Golden Globe foreign-language motion picture awards.”\n\nhttps://variety.com/2020/film/awards/golden-globes-foreign-language-eligibility-rules-1234601813/\n\n-Covid-19: US media content production, distribution to be permanently changed: A far-reaching industry analysis by MoffettNathanson has warned that after heading into 2020 with the fundamental pillars of US media starting to crack, these foundations will crumble as customer behaviour permanently shifts to streaming models on the back of the coronavirus crisis.In its investigation, the leading media analyst firm accepts that there is a lack of clarity on when the Covid-19 lockdowns will come to an end by suggest that fundamentally the impact of the virus will be felt in both the traditional TV ecosystem and the film industry as content producers re-examine the economics of producing linear TV content and feature films. MoffettNathanson noted that in its 20-year career it had witnessed three recessions and a national tragedy and that when facing unplanned declines in revenue, spending decisions have to be quickly re-examined as individuals and corporations re-assess the relative money for value hierarchies in their world. It adds that the one constant has been the continual disruption of emerging technologies that work in tandem with negative economic headwinds to play havoc with once seemingly stable industries. Looking at the ramifications of Covid-19 on the media industry, MoffettNathanson believes there will be four huge changes to the US TV industry: cord-cutting will likely accelerate; the pivot to OTT will accelerate; the bundle will serve consumers looking for live content; the next round of new sports contracts will make things worse. As a result of all of these dynamics in play, the analyst predicts that Disney will be the only company with what it calls ‘a big enough lifeboat’ and the organisational will to come out of the imminent secular changes in a strong position while Fox’s focus on live news and sports remains the right strategy. It also predicts that as a result the top streaming platforms – Netflix, Amazon and Disney – will emerge with the lion’s share of scripted content creation.\n\nhttps://www.rapidtvnews.com/2020042758403/covid-19-us-media-content-production-distribution-to-be-permanently-changed.html\n\n-Ted Sarandos Explains How Netflix Productions Are Resuming in Several Countries: Netflix chief content officer Sarandos has explained how some film productions can adapt to working under the coronavirus pandemic, outlining different approaches that the company is undertaking around the world. “Filming typically takes place in intimate, high-touch environments, with scores of artists and craftspeople working closely together on tight deadlines,” Sarandos wrote in an op-ed published in the LA Times on Monday. “While we will need to change this process — in some cases dramatically — to ensure the safety of cast and crew during this pandemic, the closed nature of sets also offers some advantages. Not least that they provide a relatively controlled environment, where we can track who comes and goes.” While productions in the United States remain shut down, Netflix has already restarted operations in South Korea, Japan and Iceland. The company also plans to start shooting again in Sweden this month and in Norway in July. Arguing against a blanket approach for all productions, Sarandos explains how Netflix has adjusted to the situation on a case-by-case basis. In Sweden, where testing is scarce, workers self-quarantined for 14 days before returning to work, and then quarantined together throughout an 11-day shoot. Meanwhile, in Iceland, tests are more widely available.\n\nhttps://variety.com/2020/biz/news/ted-sarandos-netflix-productions-resume-coronavirus-pandemic-1234597295/\n\n-Pluto TV Partners with TiVo to Expand the TiVo+ Content Network: TiVo and Pluto TV announced a partnership to bring more content to TiVo, allowing users to easily find and launch Pluto programming. The free streaming service includes over 250 live, linear channels. “Launching Pluto TV in an integrated way with TiVo aligns perfectly with our goal to provide a friction-free viewer experience with our distribution partners,” said Tom Ryan, CEO, Pluto TV. “Today, over 22 million people a month in the US tune in to stream our programming which spans across all genres of movies, news, TV shows, sports, and documentaries, and we look forward to reaching many more together as part of the TiVo+ video network.” With the new partnership, TiVo customers will be able to seamlessly access to both the live Pluto TV channels and on demand content, alongside the subscription services they already use on their TiVo devices. “We launched TiVo+ because we wanted to bring entertainment together in one easy place for viewers, and this partnership allows viewers to easily discover an awesome array of 50,000 hours of free programming from Pluto TV via TiVo+,” said Dave Shull, president and CEO, TiVo. “Now we can definitively say we’re catering to everyone’s tastes and preferences, making finding, watching and enjoying something they love easier than ever before.”\n\nhttps://www.cordcuttersnews.com/pluto-tv-partners-with-tivo-to-expand-the-tivo-content-network/\n\n-YouTube plans to let news publishers sell off-platform subscriptions through their channels: YouTube’s latest olive branch to news publishers extends to publishers’ own subscription businesses. YouTube is developing a tool for news publishers to sell subscriptions to their owned-and-operated digital properties through their YouTube channels, according to publishers that have been briefed on the matter. YouTube has told publishers as recently as April that it plans to begin testing the subscription sales tool by the end of this year. A YouTube spokesperson declined to comment. YouTube has been talking with publishers about the subscription sales tool since 2019. The tool’s development is part of YouTube’s involvement in the Google News Initiative, a program that YouTube’s parent company formed in March 2018 to support the news industry. However, some details still need to be sorted out, such as YouTube’s cut of each subscription sold and what subscriber information will be shared with publishers, according to the publishers. YouTube’s subscription sales tool for publishers would resemble the channel memberships tool it introduced in June 2018 for channels to offer perks, such exclusive access to live broadcasts, to people who pay a monthly fee. In lieu of on-platform perks, people would pay for a subscription to access content that otherwise sits behind the paywall on a given publisher’s site or apps. News publishers have been looking for platforms like YouTube to step up their efforts to help publishers make money. Publishers receive a share of revenue from the ads sold against their YouTube videos — typically 55% goes to the publisher — but news publishers, in particular, have a harder time attracting ad dollars because advertisers remain wary of their ads appearing next to controversial topics. The situation has become more acute since March as publishers have seen their YouTube CPMs fall by more than 20% despite an increase in viewership. At the top of publishers’ YouTube monetization wish lists is for the platform to pay publishers to license their videos, as Facebook began doing for articles last year. Short of that, publishers would like a higher percentage of ad revenue. By comparison, publishers consider the subscription sales tool to be potentially beneficial but unlikely to offset their ad-related monetization issues.\n\nhttps://digiday.com/future-of-tv/youtube-plans-to-let-news-publishers-sell-off-platform-subscriptions-through-their-channels/\n\n-Disney Plus Reaches 54.5 Million Subscribers, ESPN Takes Big Ad Sales Hit: Disney Plus has reached 54.5 million subscribers worldwide, the company said Tuesday as it unveiled quarterly earnings that reflect the huge hit to the bottom line caused by the shutdown of Disney’s theme parks and other businesses. The subscriber update for Disney Plus marks a gain of 4.5 million since April 8, when Disney disclosed it had topped 50 million subscribers. Bob Chapek, who was named CEO of Disney in February just as the outbreak began to make headlines overseas, said the lockdown conditions for millions have only heightened the value of Disney Plus to consumers. “Our company’s top priority and the key to our growth is our direct to consumer (assets),” Chapek said in his first earnings call with Wall Street since becoming CEO. Despite the pandemic disruptions, Disney Plus made its debut in Western Europe in late March followed by India. The Nordic countries, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal are next up for expansion, Chapek said. Losses for Disney’s direct to consumer and international unit grew to $812 million, driven by Disney Plus and the costs of consolidating Hulu. Disney chief financial officer Christine McCarthy said the DTCI unit would generate $1.1 billion in losses in the current quarter, which is Disney’s fiscal second quarter. Disney’s ongoing investment in programming for Disney Plus and ESPN Plus will mean a $420 million year-over-year hit to operating income.\n\nhttps://variety.com/2020/tv/news/disney-plus-subscribers-earnings-coronavirus-1234598746/\n\n-NBCUniversal to Combine TV, Streaming Operations in Broad Restructuring: Andy Lack will exit as head of NBCUniversal’s news operations at the end of the month, concluding a tenure marked by several controversies. Cesar Conde, chairman of the Telemundo Spanish-language channel and NBCUniversal International Group, will head a newly expanded news unit. The news division has been through a tumultuous few years, including an experiment with former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly that flopped and the exit of morning star Matt Lauer after sexual harassment allegations, which he denied. The changes are part of a broader restructuring the media company is undertaking in a rapidly changing media landscape. It is putting streaming video at the center of its entertainment operations as it plans for the future, making its Peacock streaming service part of a new unit that will include the NBC broadcast network, cable channels such as USA and Bravo, and international networks. That unit, NBCUniversal Television and Streaming, will be led by Mark Lazarus, who will also continue to helm the NBC sports group and NBC-owned TV stations. he sweeping reorganization shows that NBCUniversal Chief Executive Jeff Shell, who took over this year from longtime boss Steve Burke, is starting to put his stamp on the company. The changes are meant to put NBCUniversal, a unit of Comcast Corp., on stronger footing as consumers move away from traditional TV to streaming and get more of their news on digital platforms.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/nbcuniversal-to-combine-tv-streaming-operations-in-broad-restructuring-11588622043\n\n-Here’s Everything on Amazon Prime Video in May 2020: https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/heres-everything-on-amazon-prime-video-in-may-2020/\n\n-Quibi Turns To YouTube For Audience Growth, Uploading Full Episodes Of Select Originals: Newly-launched Quibi is turning to YouTube. The shortform video streamer has made the first episode of three shows–Liam Hemsworth-starring Most Dangerous Game, thriller The Stranger, and Anna Kendrick comedy Dummy–available on its YouTube channel, where it had previously been posting trailers and teasers for its original programming. Quibi (which debuted April 6 and has been downloaded at least 2.7 million times) has uploaded each of the ten-minute episodes twice: once in horizontal format, and once in vertical. That’s to mimic the functionality of its signature Turnstyle feature, which let users watching in the Quibi app flip seamlessly between horizontal and vertical views. Users watching on YouTube can’t flip, but they can choose which format to watch. So far, it looks like more YouTube viewers prefer horizontal than vertical, but none of the series boast a staggering amount of views thus far. The horizontal version of Most Dangerous Game has 3.8K views, which the vertical has 1.2K; The Stranger has 3.5K in horizontal, 1.1K in vertical; and Dummy has 2.2K in horizontal, 1.3K in vertical. While those view counts are slim, Quibi’s YouTube channel (70K subscribers) has actually proved pretty popular with users; it netted a not-unimpressive 57M views in February, then 88M in March, and 66M in April. The two most-viewed videos on its channel are a teaser for The Stranger (uploaded Feb. 14, with 38M views) and a trailer for Most Dangerous Game (uploaded March 24, 26M views)–though it’s very possible that that viewership was bolstered by ad-spend. Dummy is its No. 8 most-watched (April 16, 10M), so it makes sense that it’s also among the shows Quibi chose to port over.\n\nhttps://www.tubefilter.com/2020/05/01/quibi-youtube-free-episodes-the-stranger-dummy-most-dangerous-game/\n\n-Twitch is working on ‘live and interactive’ reality TV shows: Amazon is working on more interactive games for streaming, as well as releasing its own premium titles like Crucible and New World, but what else can separate Twitch in an increasingly competitive streaming market? Bloomberg reports that the company is seeking pitches for “unscripted” television shows (read: reality TV) targeting male gamers between 18 - 24, and the 18-24 age group more generally. According to the document they saw, game shows, dating shows or talk shows that can be produced on a budget of $50,000 - $250,000 per week are preferred. That should make for something better than your average video podcast on YouTube or multi-window Zoom chat, but isn’t in the ballpark of most traditional shows. Clearly plugging in a PS4 and setting up in front of The Playroom isn’t enough to cut it these days, but Amazon is willing to pay up for content that makes viewers stick to the platform even if they’re not focused on the gaming stars that so many companies are bidding for.\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/twitch-is-working-on-live-and-interactive-reality-tv-shows-060100186.html\n\n-Google Lens can now copy and paste handwritten notes to your computer: Google has added a very useful feature to Google Lens, its multipurpose object recognition tool. You can now copy and paste handwritten notes from your phone to your computer with Lens, though it only works if your handwriting is neat enough. In order to use the new feature, you need to have the latest version of Google Chrome as well as the standalone Google Lens app on Android or the Google app on iOS (where Lens can be accessed through a button next to the search bar). You’ll also need to be logged in to the same Google account on both devices. That done, simply point your camera at any handwritten text, highlight it on-screen, and select copy. You can then go to any document in Google Docs, hit Edit, and then Paste to paste the text. And voila — or, viola, depending on your handwriting."
