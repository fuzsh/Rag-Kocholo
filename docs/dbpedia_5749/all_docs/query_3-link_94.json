        "text": "Peacock, NBCUniversal's new streaming service, will launch on July 15 with 20,000 hours of programming. Here's what you need to know...\n\nThe streaming service field is becoming more fractured, as more and more media companies break from Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu in favor of creating their own streaming services. NBCUniversal—the Comcast Corp. division that owns NBC, MSNBC, USA, and the Universal Pictures movie studio—is next up with new streaming service Peacock.\n\nPeacock will feature content from NBC, Bravo, USA Network, SYFY, Oxygen, E!, CNBC, MSNBC, NBCSN, Golf Channel, Universal Kids, A&E, ABC, CBS, The CW, FOX, HISTORY, Nickelodeon, Showtime, Universal Pictures, DreamWorks, Focus Features, Illumination, ViacomCBS, Paramount, Lionsgate, Warner Bros., and Blumhouse.\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nPeacock Release Date\n\nPeacock was made available to Comcast’s Xfinity X1 platform subscribers on April 15, 2020. The service will officially roll out to the rest of the country on July 15, 2020. NBCUniversal has plans for an international release of the service but no timeframe has been announced yet.\n\nAd\n\nAd – content continues below\n\nPeacock Price\n\nWhat is Peacock going to cost? Well…that’s complicated. NBC is deviating from WarnerMedia, Disney, and Apple by incorporating pricing tiers into its service at launch. Peacock has three potential pricing options: free, $4.99, and $9.99. Here is what you’ll get at each price point:\n\nPeacock Free includes 13,000 hours of NBCUniversal content, including still-airing series a week after they premiere. It will also feature advertisements.\n\nPeacock Premium (with ads) is the $4.99 option and will include everything that the streaming service has to offer (over 20,000 hours of content) including Peacock originals and next-day availability of current TV shows…but also dumb old commercials.\n\nPeacock Premium (without ads) is $4.99 for Comcast subscribers and $9.99 for everyone else. It will include the full spectrum of Peacock content with no ads.\n\nPeacock Platforms\n\nPeacock is available to be streamed on the following platforms:\n\nApple devices including iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD.\n\nGoogle platforms and devices including Android, Android TV devices, Chromecast and Chromecast built-in devices.\n\nMicrosoft’s Xbox One family of devices, including Xbox One S and Xbox One X; and VIZIO SmartCast™ TVs and LG Smart TVs.\n\nComcast Xfinity X1 and Flex users, as well as eligible Cox Contour customers, can use Peacock Premium included with their service at no additional cost.\n\nStarting the week of July 20, Peacock will be available Sony PlayStation 4 andPlayStation 4 Pro.\n\nNotable absences on this list include two of the most popular streaming device providers in Roku and Amazon Fire. Just as WarnerMedia was unable to cut deals with either company for HBO Max, so too was NBCUniversal unable to do so with Peacock.\n\nAd\n\nAd – content continues below\n\nPeacock Originals\n\nNBCUniversal has revealed the first batch of original programming coming to the service:\n\nAvailable July 15\n\nPsych 2: Lassie Come Home\n\n“Santa Barbara Police Chief Carlton Lassiter is ambushed on the job and left for dead.
