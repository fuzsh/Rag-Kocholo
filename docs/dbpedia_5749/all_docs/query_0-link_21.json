Click here to sign up and get it delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nAmerica’s bemused affinity for the French first took root when a fancy badass named Lafayette helped George Washington punt all sorts of rump during the Revolutionary War, and but for the occasional frosty interval, we’ve been regular pals ever since. The alliance is such that the origins of some of our shared vocabulary aren’t always clear; depending on which etymologist you choose to believe, either the word “sport” was lifted from the Old French desporter or our Gallic chums (and pretty much everyone else in Europe) borrowed the lexeme from the English.\n\nAs much as the French remain as bewildering to our noisy, unrefined sensibilities as they’ve ever been—while les Français were busy cooking up Existentialism, the most popular radio program in the U.S. featured a ventriloquist and his equally unseen dummy—the mutual fascination endures. And often as not, that age-old camaraderie bleeds into the TV ratings.\n\nWhen France hosted the 1992 Olympics, CBS averaged 29.1 million viewers per night, marking the third-biggest turnout for the Winter Games in the modern Nielsen era, trailing only the 2002 event in Salt Lake City (32 million) and the Nancy Kerrigan/Tanya Harding-fueled soap opera in Lillehammer (43.2 million, 1994).\n\nAll of which should make the gang at NBC Sports feel pretty how-you-say “psyched” about their prospects in Paris this month, although you don’t have to go all the way back to the tail end of the Père Bush administration to get a sense of how the Olympics will fare here in the U.S. The ratings for NBCUniversal’s coverage of the U.S. Olympic Gymnastics Team Trials were uniformly fantastic, as Simone Biles qualified for the Paris Games in front of a peak audience of 8.2 million viewers, marking the highest turnout since 2016.\n\nNBC Olympics president Gary Zenkel cautioned there is “no straight math from the Trials to the Games in terms of audience deliveries,” but the exec who oversees all the business elements of the company’s biennial extravaganzas acknowledged he was pretty fired up when the ratings data started pouring in. Even if the June numbers are directional at best, the demonstrable enthusiasm for the qualifiers hasn’t been lost on NBCU’s ad sales team.\n\n“In a world where media consumption has been fragmented at an aggressive pace, to grow ratings in such an environment is really spectacular,” Dan Lovinger, president, Olympic and Paralympic Sales, NBCUniversal, said. Beyond the sheer volume of impressions that NBC scared up throughout the qualifiers, advertisers were rewarded with a tide of downstream perks, as message recall was 22% higher than any non-Trials programming, while ensuing brand-search activity was up 27%. Such results underscore why a record number of marketers have invested in the Summer Olympics, which are on track to generate some $1.25 billion in ad revenue.\n\n“You’ve got massive ratings in an incredibly useful and impactful environment, and that spells opportunity for advertisers,” Lovinger said. “Those results are just one of many reasons why we think these upcoming Paris Games are going to be spectacular.”\n\nWhile Lovinger wouldn’t forecast how these Olympics might shake out across NBCU’s various platforms (“I don’t predict ratings for a living, and I’m not going to start now”), there’s really nowhere to go but up. After the temporally challenged, COVID-delayed Tokyo Games eked out the lowest average viewership for an Olympics (15.5 million viewers), this month’s event promises a welcome return to normalcy. Paris may not do the sort of numbers that London scared up five cycles ago—the 2012 Summer Olympics averaged 31.1 million primetime viewers, which will be hard to match given even the big-reach broadcast networks have seen their penetration fall to just 66% of all U.S. TV households—but deliveries in the neighborhood of 25 million viewers per day are well within the realm of possibility.\n\nHowever things shake out on the ratings front, NBCU takes great pride in making certain its marketing partners are fully covered. “When people buy the Olympics they’re not looking to be made whole in an inferior programming environment, so we always hold back inventory to make sure that those advertisers [hit their guarantees] within the Games themselves,” Lovinger said. “We’ve got a perfect record on that score, and we intend to keep it perfect in Paris.”\n\nIn advance of putting the Olympics inventory on the market, Lovinger and his team plot out what a worst-case scenario would look like and then salt away a sufficient cache of units to serve as potential ADUs. (That’s shorthand for “audience deficiency units,” which is TV Land argot for the ads used to offset under-deliveries.)\n\nSometimes, as was the case in London, the ratings surpass the internal targets, whereupon NBCU will find itself with a whole gang of units to sell off in scatter. Because spots that are sold during the Games are priced at a premium compared to the rates negotiated upfront, NBCU can walk away from a successful Olympics with a lot more money than it had originally anticipated; in 2012, the company booked some $200 million in bonus sales after it sold off all of its insurance units.\n\nSuch a scenario may play out in Paris. “Based on the success of the Trials, we expect to be selling all the way through the Games,” Lovinger said. “But if in fact we’re off, we have reserved enough inventory, we believe, to make everybody good.”\n\nAs has been the case during the last several Olympics cycles, NBCU is guaranteeing deliveries across all platforms, including its linear TV networks and the streaming service Peacock. Unlike most TV inventory, which is still largely sold against a couple of key demos (adults 18-49 and 25-54), NBCU’s Olympics units are bought and sold with an eye toward overall deliveries of people aged 2 and up. This time around, Lovinger’s team is combining the results of a new 2 p.m.-5 p.m. EDT daypart with the impressions served up by its traditional primetime window, an effort that will fuse live coverage deliveries with a glossily produced series of recaps and narrative pieces that will comprise the bulk of NBC’s traditional nightly broadcasts.\n\nThe ad loads in the two dayparts will be unique, as the primetime slots will be wholly different from the spots that air during the live daytime coverage. In other words, while NBCU will derive its average deliveries by blending the impressions from the two programming blocks, advertisers’ guarantees will be limited to whatever dayparts they happen to buy.\n\nNone of which is to suggest that NBCU’s Olympics ratings aren’t ripe to be misinterpreted by the press. Because the primetime results are likely to leak well before NBC researchers have crunched the numbers on its six hours of daily cross-platform deliveries, some outlets are almost certain to report what amounts to a fraction of the overall data. Lovinger is resigned to that sort of thing.\n\n“I’ve pushed back on the way the ratings have been covered for quite some time,” he said. “People tend to get fixated on what that primetime NBC broadcast number looks like, even though that’s really a vestige of the past. Because a) that’s not how we sell, and b) that’s not how people watch and consume live sports.”\n\nNBCU is also facing an uphill battle as far as historical precedent is concerned. In a sense, the blending of the two blocks makes for a whole lot of imminent apples-to-Orange Juliuses comparisons, although any misrepresentation of the official ratings picture will have zero impact on the advertisers. Marketers are fully aware of how many impressions they’re buying and what targets they need to hit to get their money’s worth, even if the general public may struggle with innumeracy.\n\n“The comparisons to the past are almost irrelevant now,” Lovinger said, before adding that he believes the Olympics turnout should be sufficiently robust to neutralize any distortions or miscalculations from the cheap seats. “We’ve got Paris, which as a location is about as good as it gets, and we’ve got a roster of stars who are doing their job, who are showing up in full force. So, we feel really good about what these Games have in store.”"
