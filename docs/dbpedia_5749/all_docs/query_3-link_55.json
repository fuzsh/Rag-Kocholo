        "text": "With several days of Olympic competition remaining, NBC has “surpassed 17 billion minutes streamed for the Paris games -- the vast majority on Peacock -- exceeding the streaming minutes for all of the previous Olympics combined,” according to David Bauder of the AP. The Paris Games are “powering a much-needed rebound for Peacock,” a streaming service “often the target of ridicule during Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 and Beijing in 2022.” NBCUniversal Media Group Chair Mark Lazarus said it has “been a real turnaround.” Bauder noted rather than “detract from it,” Lazarus believes that Peacock “has helped NBC’s television outlets to a ratings performance in Paris that has network honchos giddy with joy.” Lazarus had “ordered a teardown of Peacock’s Olympics operation,” as the streamer was “hard to navigate and plagued with glitches.” NBC also “admits to failing to deliver on promises that Peacock would be the comprehensive Olympics experience.” But the whip-around “Gold Zone” product has \"proven enormously popular.” Most importantly, there are “effective navigation tools leading people into all Peacock has to offer.” With Paris being six hours ahead of the eastern U.S., there are no live events available for its prime-time show, but it is a \"bonanza for Peacock users in the afternoon.” Lazarus speculated that “more people working at home in the post-COVID era is also helping Peacock” (AP, 8/7).\n\nALL COMING TOGETHER: WIRED's Brian Stelter wrote Peacock's presentation of the Paris Games is a “rare instance of fragmentation being to streaming’s benefit,\" as the Olympics \"illustrate how all the shattered pieces can be stuck back together.\" Eight of Peacock's 10 most-streamed days of all time have been from these Olympics. It has been a “complete turnaround” for the streaming service, which “disappointed users with a meager selection of streams” during the 2021 Tokyo Games. This time, “it just works.” Live streams “load quickly,” and on-demand clips “seamlessly play, one after another.” NBC has “managed to avoid what every streaming distributor dreads: Headlines about server meltdowns and software glitches.” Peacock President Kelly Campbell said, \"For the first time, I really feel like we've solved the conundrum of navigation.” Stelter noted NBC internal research showed “nearly a third of new Olympics viewers say that clips on social media are driving them to tune in.” The company's sports social media channels “picked up a combined two million new followers in the first week of the games.” Peacock’s editorial team has “adjusted and reorganized video content on the fly.” Viewers and reviewers have been “buzzing about Snoop Dogg’s segments,\" so the team \"set up a scrollable playlist of Snoop clips” (WIRED, 8/7).\n\nSOUNDS REAL: In Phoenix, Bill Goodykoontz noted NBC is employing an AI-generated Al Michaels for Olympic highlights every night in a feature called “Your Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock.” Viewers can \"personalize it to the kind of highlights you want.\" Goodykoontz: \"I gave it a try and, honestly, it’s pretty good. Really good, in fact, which is to say it pretty much sounds exactly like Al Michaels\" (ARIZONA REPUBLIC, 8/4)."
