The network said that Today personalities Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, Craig Melvin, Al Roker, Carson Daly, Willie Geist, Jenna Bush Hager, Sheinelle Jones, Dylan Dreyer, Kristen Welker and Peter Alexander will be featured.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\n'The Amber Ruffin Show' Will Launch \"Sooner Rather Than Later\", Says Seth Meyers & Peacock Originals Chief\n\nPeacock Chief Matt Strauss On Building A Streaming \"Start-Up\" In Turbulent Times, Avoiding \"Casino\" Feel Of On-Demand Rivals\n\n'The Office': Peacock Brass Exploring \"Creative Ideas\" For Series' Launch, Including Possible Reunion; No Reboot Talk\n\nIt’s unclear how much of Today All Day will be original and how much will be repurposed from the four-hour broadcast. The service will be free but ad supported.\n\nIt’s also the latest expansion of the 69-year-old Today brand, which is now four hours per day. The show expanded to three hours in 2000 and to four hours in 2007.\n\nPeacock has been emphasizing some of the news and non-fiction programming to distinguish itself from other streaming platforms. Today All Day will be available under the channels tab on Peacock and Today.com/allday on the show’s website.\n\nLast year, the network launched NBC News Now, drawing on the network’s news division resources. The network said that Today has won the 25-54 demographic for 19 straight quarters and 58 consecutive months.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nU.S. Coronavirus Update: Numbers Skyrocket As New Cases Hit Record Highs 3 Times In Past 10 Days - Update\n\nCoronavirus: Movies That Have Halted Or Delayed Production Amid Outbreak\n\nHong Kong Filmart Postponed Due To Coronavirus Fears; Event Moves Two Weeks Before Toronto"
