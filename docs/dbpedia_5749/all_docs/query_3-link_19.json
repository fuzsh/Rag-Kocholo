        "text": "On Tuesday, NBCUniversal unveiled the name and initial content slate for its upcoming streaming service, Peacock, which will roll out in April. The service, which will be supported by both ads and subscriptions, will feature more than 15,000 hours of content when it debuts, comprises a deep slate of library programming like the comedies 30 Rock, The Office and Parks and Recreation, plus a number of original series, including reboots of Battlestar Galactica, Punky Brewster and Saved by the Bell.\n\nWhile Peacock’s original and library titles certainly generated buzz, but there was something else about the service that people couldn’t stop talking—and, in some cases, snickering—about: its name.\n\nPeacock\n\nWORK SMARTER - LEARN, GROW AND BE INSPIRED.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nTo Read the Full Story Become an Adweek+ Subscriber\n\nView Subscription Options\n\nAlready a member?
