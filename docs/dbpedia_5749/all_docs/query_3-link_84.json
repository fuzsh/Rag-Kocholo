        "text": "The free ad-supported streaming service Pluto TV has recently been adding a lot of NBCUniversal programs, including Murder She Wrote, NBC Sports, and Little House on the Prairie. Now, Pluto TV has added two more NBCUniversal Channels to its lineup of free channels.\n\nHere are the channels Pluto TV added today:\n\nUniversal Action: Buckle up and hold on tight! Helicopters, fast cars, and fight scenes are packed into this channel. Here you’ll find riveting shows that are sure to get your heart pumping and adrenaline flowing, such as “Magnum P.I.,” “Knight Rider,” “The A-Team” and many others.\n\nGolfPass: GolfPass brings together thousands of lessons from the game’s biggest instructors, exclusive series, GOLF Channel news and features, and much more.\n\nHere are some of the other channels Pluto TV recently added:\n\nNBC Sports is a 24/7 of sports content. The channel offers a collection of videos from NBC Sports’ different platforms and shares the same name with the now-defunct NBC Sports Network. You will also find highlights from programs like the “The Dan Patrick Show”.\n\nMurder She Wrote is a classic crime drama TV series starring Angela Lansbury as Jessica Fletcher, a small-town mystery writer and amateur sleuth. The show first premiered in 1984 and ran for 12 seasons.\n\nLittle House on the Prairie is a western drama series that followed the daily lives of the Ingalls family — Charles, Caroline, Laura, Mary, and Carrie — on a farm in Plum Creek. The show, which premiered in 1974, was based of the children’s book by the same name penned by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The series ran for nine seasons.\n\nThe channels were part of a batch from NBCUniversal. Last month, Pluto TV said it was adding more channels to its service in February including The Jack Hanna Channel, BBC Earth, Crunchyroll, Earthday 365, and Supernatural Drama along with six new channel categories — Competition Reality, History + Science, Lifestyle, Home + Food, Animals + Nature, and Anime.\n\nThe service is also adding a pop-up category for Black History Month called The Black Collective. The section has channels like Black Cinema, Black Throwbacks, Black Classics, BET Pluto TV, BET Her, Bounce XL, AspireTV Live, Love & Hip-Hop, Vevo R&B, and XITE Gospel."
