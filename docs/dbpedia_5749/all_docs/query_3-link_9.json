        "text": "Apples Never Fall, a drama series from NBCUniversal Global Distribution’s slate, is based on Liane Moriarty’s novel of the same name.\n\n“With its very well-known IP and an internationally renowned cast (Sam Neill and Annette Bening), this show is sure to captivate audiences around the world,” says Belinda Menendez, president and chief revenue officer.\n\nMary & George and The Irrational are also on offer. Produced by Hera Pictures in association with Sky Studios, the historical drama Mary & George tells the true story of how Mary Villiers has her son, George, seduce King James I and become his all-powerful lover.\n\nThe procedural drama The Irrational follows a world-renowned behavioral science professor, who lends his expertise on human behavior to an array of high-stakes cases.\n\n“Coming out of a very successful LA Screenings, we are looking forward to reconnecting with our global partners at MIPCOM,” comments Menendez."
