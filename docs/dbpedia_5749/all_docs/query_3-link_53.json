        "text": "The streaming landscape will get a little more crowded this year with the arrival of Peacock, the streaming video service that launched in April from media conglomerate Comcast’s NBCUniversal. The service is currently available to some Comcast TV subscribers, but when it goes public July 15 it will offer multiple tiers of free and subscription-based plans offering access to a library of new and classic movies and TV series, from original projects to fan-favorite sitcoms and films.\n\nWith so many streaming services currently available and upcoming, it can be difficult to decide which ones to invest in — and what you get for your money can be as important a factor in that decision as how much you spend. In order to make that choice a little easier, we’ve put together a list of everything expected to be available on Peacock through 2021.\n\n(Note: NBCUniversal hasn’t specified how the content on its free, ad-supported tiers and its paid, Peacock Premium tier will differ at this point, so some of the content on this list might not be available via the free tier.)\n\nCurrent NBC shows\n\nPeacock users will be able to stream new episodes of many NBC and Telemundo series the day after they air, with earlier episodes and full seasons also available to stream. Some of the shows specifically announced for next-day streaming availability include:\n\nAmerica’s Got Talent: Champions\n\nBlindspot\n\nBluff City Law\n\nBring the Funny\n\nCaso Cerrado\n\nChicago Fire\n\nChicago Med\n\nChicago P.D.\n\nEllen’s Game of Games\n\nHollywood Game Night\n\nLaw and Order: SVU\n\nMaking It\n\nManifest\n\nNew Amsterdam\n\nOperación Pacífico\n\nPerfect Harmony\n\nSongland\n\nSunnyside\n\nSuperstore\n\nThe Blacklist\n\nThe InBetween\n\nThe Wall\n\nThis Is Us\n\nTitan Games\n\nWorld of Dance\n\nThis list will also include new and upcoming shows such as Council of Dads, Indebted, Lincoln Rhyme: Hunt for the Bone Collector, The Kenan Show, and Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist.\n\nPeacock users will also be able to watch the latest episodes of late-night talk shows The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Late Night with Seth Meyers several hours before the episodes’ on-air broadcast time.\n\nDaily news\n\nLive news segments, rebroadcasts of earlier segments, and live election coverage will be available from the company’s various news networks, including NBC News, Sky News, MSNBC, and CNBC.\n\nSports\n\nPeacock is betting big on its coverage of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and is positioning Peacock as the primary hub for streaming coverage of Olympic events. The service will reportedly provide live coverage of major competitions and commentary from NBC analysts.\n\nPremier League fans will have streaming access to 2,000 hours of programming and more than 140 live matches during the season, while golf fans will be able to stream NBC’s coverage of the Ryder Cup, with live broadcasts of key moments.\n\nThe service will also provide various documentaries and original content and clips from its various sports networks’ coverage through the years. Some of the original projects announced so far include the documentary In Deep with Ryan Lochte, the Nike documentary Run Through the Line, and Lost Speedways, a documentary series hosted by Dale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nOriginal series and revivals\n\nThe service will also include a robust lineup of original series and new revivals of classic shows. The following projects will be available when the service has its public launch in July:\n\nBrave New World\n\nBased on Aldous Huxley’s groundbreaking 1932 novel of the same name, this series explores a utopian society where privacy, money, family, and human history have been outlawed to establish peace and stability.\n\nThe Capture\n\nThis thriller is set in modern-day London and follows a soldier whose arrest exposes a far-reaching conspiracy rooted in the darkest corners of the surveillance world and misinformation campaigns.\n\nIntelligence\n\nThis workplace sitcom follows the members of a relatively boring British intelligence agency whose lives are upended by the arrival of an American agent.\n\nPsych 2: Lassie Come Home\n\nThe popular comedy series gets another made-for-TV movie that brings back the original cast members for yet another mystery.\n\nIn Deep With Ryan Lochte\n\nOlympic swimming champion Ryan Lochte, whose triumphs were overshadowed by a scandal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, attempts to prove he can still make the cut on Team USA and that he’s learned from the mistakes of his past in this documentary series.\n\nLost Speedways\n\nCelebrated driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. hosts this series that explores some of the greatest speedways in racing history that have faded from memory over the years.
