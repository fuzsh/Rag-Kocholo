        "text": "Perhaps the hot button topic of this offseason for Phils fans has been the question of why the Phillies couldn't keep Cliff Lee? It's been discussed to the point of exhaustion and still people can't quite get over it. I was talking to a guy at a party a few weeks ago who made it seem like Ruben Amaro Jr. stole his car and slept with his girlfriend. This dude was pissed that Cliff Lee is no longer wearing a Phillies jersey.\n\nWell Ruben kind of sees your point and says he ain't no dummy.\n\nScott Lauber caught up with Amaro yesterday at the Sports Writers Association banquet and got the puppet master to discuss the issue once again.\n\n“I was talking to some people the other day,” Amaro recalled, “and I\n\nsaid, ‘I’m not a dummy. I know what Cliff Lee means to our rotation in\n\naddition to Halladay and [Cole] Hamels.\n\nIt’s a no-brainer.’ … Our goal is to be a contender every year — not\n\njust to be a competitor, but to be a contender every year. That’s\n\nreally my job. As an executive of the club, it’s my job to do what I\n\ncan to try to maintain that level of talent on the club and that hope\n\nfrom the fans. So, yes, I’d like to have a championship, but not at the\n\ncost of having our organization not be good for 10 years. Absolutely\n\nnot. That’s not the goal. The goal is to be a contender every year. And\n\nonce you get to the World Series or get to the playoffs, it’s really a\n\nmatter of who’s playing the best baseball, who’s hottest, who has the\n\nkarma.”\n\nKarma, huh? I know one guy who probably believes in karma. I think that's what they call it.\n\nBut let's play devil's advocate for the sake of argument. Does Ruben really believe that if they currently didn't have Phillipe Aumont, Tyson Gillies, and Juan Ramirez in their system right now that it would cost them to \"not be good for 10 years?\"\n\nJust sayin'."
