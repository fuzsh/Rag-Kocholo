Apples Never Fall, a drama series from NBCUniversal Global Distribution’s slate, is based on Liane Moriarty’s novel of the same name.

“With its very well-known IP and an internationally renowned cast (Sam Neill and Annette Bening), this show is sure to captivate audiences around the world,” says Belinda Menendez, president and chief revenue officer.

Mary & George and The Irrational are also on offer. Produced by Hera Pictures in association with Sky Studios, the historical drama Mary & George tells the true story of how Mary Villiers has her son, George, seduce King James I and become his all-powerful lover.

The procedural drama The Irrational follows a world-renowned behavioral science professor, who lends his expertise on human behavior to an array of high-stakes cases.

“Coming out of a very successful LA Screenings, we are looking forward to reconnecting with our global partners at MIPCOM,” comments Menendez.
