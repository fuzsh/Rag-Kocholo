        "text": "Saved! is a 2004 comedy film about a girl attending a Christian high school who becomes pregnant and finds herself ostracized and demonized, as all of her former friends turn on her.\n\nDirected by Brian Dannelly. Written by Brian Dannelly and Michael Urban.\n\nHeaven Help Us.#taglines\n\nMary\n\n[edit]\n\n[voiceover] Veronica was adopted by her parents when they were missionaries in Vietnam. Hilary Faye sees her as an example of God's will triumphing over a savage, Godless nation.\n\n[to a cross, after discovering she's pregnant] Shit! Fuck! [under her breath] Goddamn.\n\nHilary Faye\n\n[edit]\n\n[to Mary regarding Dean] Come on, you're not born a gay, you're born again.\n\n[when she crashes her car] I crashed my van into Jesus!\n\n[when throwing a Bible at Mary] I am FILLED with Christ's love!\n\n[when talking to Rowland about Jesus] Of course he's white.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\n...After asking Hilary Faye to 'save her'.\n\nCassandra: So anyways, I finally managed to duct tape a piece of bacon into her locker.\n\nPeople are running from Hilary Faye asking what 'that smell' is.\n\nHilary Faye: Hey Cassandra, how do you feel?\n\nCassandra: I'm a whole new girl, Hay Faye.\n\nHilary Faye: I told you! How great is Jesus?\n\nCassandra: Yeah, about that...I've decided to devote my life to Satan, instead. But thanks!\n\nMary: I need to tell you guys something.\n\n[Van suddenly haults]\n\nHilary Faye: Eew.\n\nVeronica: Eew.\n\nRoland: WHAT? Wasn't like it was some kind of secret. The guy was like a one-man gay pride parade.\n\nPastor Skip: (to Hilary Faye, Veronica, and Tia) Listen, I'm concerned about Mary. Something's going on.\n\nHilary Faye: Yeah, me too.\n\nPastor Skip: She's part of your posse, and I think that you could help her. I'm gonna need you be a warrior out there in the front line of Jesus.\n\nTia: You mean like shoot her?\n\nPastor Skip: (laughs) No, no, no ... I was thinking of something a little less gangsta. I need someone who's spiritually armed to help guide her back to her faith--the love and care that only Jesus can supply. You down with that?\n\nHilary Faye: Yeah, I'm down with that.\n\nPastor Skip: She's pretty vulnerable right now, so I'm gonna need you to be extra gentle.\n\nHilary Faye, Veronica, and Tia meet Mary and shove her into Hilary Faye's van. While Veronica holds her down and Tia holds up a picture of Jesus, Hilary Faye stretches her hand toward Mary.\n\nHilary Faye: In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you, leave the body of this servant of God ...\n\nMary: You're performing an exorcism on me?!?!? Get off me! [she shoves Veronica aside and gets out of the van]\n\nTia: Where are you going? Get back here!\n\nHilary Faye: Mary, we've gotta get rid of the evil in you.\n\nTia: [holding up a picture of Jesus] It's God's will!\n\nMary: God's will?\n\nTia: Christ died for your sins!\n\nHilary Faye: OK, wait a second. [pushes Tia aside] So are you not gonna accept our intervention here?\n\nMary: You mean kidnapping? No!\n\nHilary Faye: You are backsliding into the flames of hell.\n\nVeronica: You've become a magnet for sin! We've all witnessed it.\n\nMary: Sure, Veronica acting all pure--what about last spring break at the Promise Makers' rally, huh?\n\nHilary Faye: Oh my God ... you are making accusations as we're trying to save your soul? Mary, turn away from Satan. Jesus, he loves you.\n\nMary: You don't know the first thing about love.\n\nHilary Faye: I am filled with Christ's love! [throws her Bible at Mary] You are just jealous of my success in the Lord.\n\nMary: [Mary hands Bible back to Hilary Faye] This is not a weapon, you idiot.\n\nMary: So, what do you think of the new ride?\n\nVeronica: Oh, you're so lucky, Hilary Faye.\n\nHilary Faye: Yeah. I could have had a Lexus Gold Edition, you know. [indicating Roland]\n\nVeronica: Wow. Roland is blessed with such a thoughtful sister. In countries like China, Hilary Faye probably would have been killed at birth.\n\nHilary Faye: Yeah... and then where would you be, Roland?\n\nRoland: [deadpan] China.\n\nHilary Faye: You know, smoking isn't just bad for you; it's bad for all of us. Secondhand smoke kills.\n\nCassandra: I'm counting on it. [throws the lit cigarette at Hilary Faye]\n\nHilary Faye: [after Roland spills sauce onto her pants] Do you wanna go wait in the van again? Do you know these are new pants! You're handicapped but get it together.\n\nCassandra: Hey, Roland, how about we get outta here and you can give me a little spin in that thing? Release his parking brake, Hilary \"Fake.\"\n\nHilary Faye: [to Cassandra] You smell like Tia's dad, have you been drinking? [camera shows Tia with a sour look on her face]\n\nCassandra: Hey, isn't that --\n\nRoland: Mary?? What's she doing downtown?\n\nCassandra: There's only one reason Christian girls come down to the Planned Parenthood!\n\nRoland: She's planting a pipe bomb!?\n\nCassandra: Well, two reasons.\n\nRoland: With Dean? I think there's a better chance of that pipe bomb.\n\nLillian: I keep trying to remind myself that when Jesus closes a door he opens a window.\n\nMary: Yeah, so we have something to jump out of.\n\nPatrick: Do you wanna go out sometime?\n\nMary: What, are you gonna take me out on your scooter?\n\nPatrick: Come on. I'm like, totally adorable. Besides, it'd drive Hilary Faye crazy.\n\nMary: I can't. I'm not...dating right now.\n\nPatrick: What about tomorrow night? Will you be dating then?\n\nMary: Good night, Patrick.\n\nMary: [about the Virgin Mary] I know this is wrong, but do you ever wonder if she just made the whole thing up? I mean, it's a pretty good one. It's not like anyone can ever use virgin birth as an excuse again. [pause] I don't really think she made it up, but I can understand why a girl would.\n\nMary: Why would Dean's parents send him to a place like that?\n\nLillian: They probably didn't think they could handle it.\n\nMary: What do you mean?\n\nLillian: Well, having a child is like owning a car. I can change the oil, fill the gas tank, take it to a car wash, but if the carburetor broke, I wouldn't have a clue as to how to fix it.\n\nMary: So, you're saying you'd just send me to a place like Mercy House?\n\nLillian: Oh, Mary, please don't tell me you're a lesbian!\n\nMary: Mom...\n\nLillian: Do I need to worry about you? No. No, you're perfect. I don't have to worry about you.\n\nMary: [voice-over] My mom just compared me to a car, so me having a baby is definitely under the category of things she couldn't handle.\n\n[Mary is going into labor and is being carried into an ambulance]\n\nParamedic: I only got room for one of you.\n\nDean: I'm the father.\n\nPatrick: I'm her boyfriend.\n\nMitch: [points to Dean] I'm HIS boyfriend.\n\nParamedic: That's nice, but I've still only got room for one of you.\n\nLillian: [climbing into the ambulance] Starting the party without me?\n\n[Mary and Lillian are watching a game show]\n\nLillian: I hate this show. [switches channel]\n\nAnnouncer on TV: Coming up on Lifetime: Valerie Bertinelli stars in Bitter Harvest, a sensitive portrayal of one woman's struggle with cancer.\n\nLillian: Oh, this looks good.\n\n[many minutes later]\n\nValerie Bertinelli: There was a feeling of twilight in the air. All honeydew and lilac. God wasn't just smiling down on me; he was...jumping up and cheering! And then, well...I thought I was pregnant. I'd been throwing up every morning and I hadn't had my period in two months, so I took a home pregnancy test.\n\nWoman, off-camera: What happened?\n\nValerie Bertinelli: ...found out I wasn't pregnant. It was the cancer.\n\nMary: She found all that out from a home pregnancy test?\n\n[in the gym; Cassandra and Mary have to help Hilary Faye decorate for prom. Cassandra's hanging a sign on a rafter]\n\nHilary Faye: You better be wearing underpants this time. No, seriously, move it higher. Higher!\n\nPastor Skip: Oh, you're doing a great job, Cassandra. It's looking really phat.\n\nCassandra: [mocking voice] I'm so glad.\n\nTia: I thought you were going to ask Patrick to the prom.\n\nHilary Faye: Tia, would you just shut up? Do you want to go back to being invisible girl with bad hair? 'Cause that could easily happen.\n\nCassandra: You can tacky up prom on your own. I quit!\n\nHilary Faye: Oh my gosh, you can't quit!\n\nCassandra: Watch me! Watch me walkin' away! Watch me walkin' away from Jesus!\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nHeaven Help Us.\n\nGot Passion?
