I'm Terry Gross.\n\nIf you haven't seen Macaulay Culkin since the \"Home Alone\" era, you may be\n\nsurprised by the kind of offbeat, independent movies that he's making and what\n\na good adult actor he's developed into. Last year he starred in \"Party\n\nMonster,\" based on the story of Michael Alig, a New York club kid who gave\n\nwild parties and is now serving time for killing his drug dealer. Now Culkin\n\nis starring in the new film \"Saved!\", a comedy set in a Christian high school\n\ncalled American Eagle. The film was produced by Michael Stipe's company,\n\nSingle Cell. A little later, we'll hear from Brian Dannelly, the movie's\n\ndirector and co-writer.\n\nThe story revolves around the girls in the school's Christian rock band. Jena\n\nMalone plays a girl who tries to save her boyfriend's soul by helping him\n\nprove he's not really gay. Unfortunately, she becomes pregnant in the\n\nprocess. Mandy Moore plays the school's most preachy Christian. Macaulay\n\nCulkin plays her skeptical brother. As a result of a childhood accident, he\n\nneeds a wheelchair to get around. He becomes close with the school rebel who\n\nis also the school's only Jewish student, played by Eva Amurri. In this\n\nscene, Culkin and Amurri are talking at an outdoor cafe just across the street\n\nfrom the Planned Parenthood office.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Saved!\")\n\nMs. EVA AMURRI: (As Cassandra) What's the matter? Scared to be seen in\n\npublic with a stripper?\n\nMr. MACAULAY CULKIN: (As Roland) No. Scared of being seen with a cripple?\n\nMs. AMURRI: (As Cassandra) I've been seen with worse.\n\nMr. CULKIN: (As Roland) Hilary Faye's gonna freak out when I'm not there\n\nwaiting for her.\n\nMs. AMURRI: (As Cassandra) Who cares?\n\nMr. CULKIN: (As Roland) It's just that I don't get out much on my own.\n\nMs. AMURRI: (As Cassandra) I'm not really a stripper, you know.\n\nMr. CULKIN: (As Roland) I'm not really a Christian. So how'd you end up at\n\nAmerican Eagle? I mean, you're Jewish, right?\n\nMs. AMURRI: (As Cassandra) Well, after I got expelled from my last school,\n\nit was either here or home schooling. Figure I could handle these freaks\n\nbetter than my parents.\n\nMr. CULKIN: (As Roland) Wow. Lucky me.\n\nMs. AMURRI: (As Cassandra) Are you playing footsies with me?\n\nMr. CULKIN: (As Roland) Wheelies.\n\nMs. AMURRI: (As Cassandra) Hey, isn't that...\n\nMr. CULKIN: (As Roland) Mary? What is she doing downtown?\n\nMs. AMURRI: (As Cassandra) There's only one reason Christian girls come down\n\nto the Planned Parenthood.\n\nMr. CULKIN: (As Roland) She's planting a pipe bomb?\n\nMs. AMURRI: (As Cassandra) OK, two reasons.\n\nGROSS: I asked Macaulay Culkin why he wanted to be part of the film \"Saved!\"\n\nMr. CULKIN: I mean, it was just a smart movie. It was so smart and funny,\n\nand I kind of just loved how it approached issues and I loved just the\n\nstructure of it. I loved the fact that it kind of--you know, all these\n\ncharacters start off as these kind of, you know, almost cliches or caricatures\n\nalmost of teen movies or of Christianity even. I love how they kind of break\n\ndown or are torn down throughout the course of the film and are kind of\n\nexposed for what they really are. And I just love the subject matter. I\n\nmean, I'm not a very, very religious person, but at the same time, I was one\n\nof those people who was--I was raised Catholic, which means I'm an\n\nex-Catholic. Ha ha ha. But, you know, I went to Catholic school, you know,\n\nmath, English, Jesus Christ; it's kind of part of the curriculum. And so, you\n\nknow, it was just something that, you know, I've always found interesting.\n\nSo, yeah, I just wanted to be a part of it. And I met Brian Dannelly, the\n\ndirector, once I got back to America, and he was just, you know--he just\n\nreally got it. He was so cute, you know. He was a, you know, first-time guy,\n\nand he had his little notebook of, you know, his vision of the movie. You\n\nknow, you could just tell. I could totally picture him sitting Indian style\n\nin his living room with a pair of scissors and magazines, cutting out pictures\n\nand stuff. You know, he had pictures of Jena in there and he had pictures of\n\nme and other potential cast members. He even had, like, a spec-like poster\n\nfor the movie. It was really kind of cute. And it was just kind of one of\n\nthose moments where I think we kind of just both acknowledged that, you know,\n\nwe had the same idea in mind, that we wanted to make the same movie. And it\n\nkind of went from there.\n\nGROSS: What did you relate to about the character that you play in \"Saved!\"\n\nMr. CULKIN: Well, I love--you know, he was very cynical, 'cause he's, you\n\nknow, in a wheelchair in the movie, and his older sister--or actually younger\n\nsister, Hilary Faye, played by Mandy Moore, is always kind of wheeling him\n\naround like he's some sort of merit badge. Like, you know, `Look how good of\n\na Christian I am. I take care of my brother who's in a wheelchair.' And it\n\nkind of exposes him to the manipulative aspects of religion, of Christianity,\n\nand so he rejects it basically. And I think by the end, he kind of comes full\n\ncircle and he eventually kind of ends up finding how he's right with Jesus\n\nbasically and finding his religion.\n\nGROSS: Did you end up going to Christian schools or Christian concepts as\n\nresearch for the film?\n\nMr. CULKIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Brian Dannelly, he's very big into\n\nresearch. I mean, you should see all the things that we got. I mean, just\n\nprintouts from Web sites and things like that, conversations he was having\n\nwith other Christians who had read the script, and he even sent me some\n\npamphlets on how paraplegics have intercourse, not that it's ever addressed in\n\nthe movie. He just wanted to make sure that, you know, I knew that my\n\ncharacter had a very healthy sex life and things like that. It was very cute.\n\nBut one of the things that we always did was we went to Christian rock\n\nconcerts, Christian, you know, youth rallies, things like that, and it was\n\namazing. I remember when I read the script, you know, I was kind of aware\n\nthat this world was going on, that there was this kind of modern Christian\n\nmovement going on. But to see it first hand, you know, it just made us all\n\nthe more want to stay true to it. We went to this big one at Edison Field,\n\nyou know, or Anaheim Stadium, wherever the Angels play in Anaheim, and it was\n\n40,000 born-again Christians who were all blonde, by the way, all born-again\n\nChristians who were blonde, and it was amazing. I mean, it was like these\n\nChristian rock bands, like the U2 sound-alike Christian rock band and the\n\nRadiohead sound-alike Christian rock band, and all very uplifting songs, and\n\nthe pastor's up there and he's quoting Pink and Madonna as much as the Bible.\n\nIt was quite amazing.\n\nAnd I remember, you know, I was walking out of there and it was just, you\n\nknow, kind of this odd experience. And there were all these people picketing\n\noutside. I couldn't believe there were people picketing and passing out all\n\nthese pamphlets saying, `Oh, you're choosing the wrong path and, you know,\n\nso-and-so is the Antichrist or whatever.' And they were Christians. They were\n\nlike fundamentalists, like Christians who were kind of just against the\n\nconcept of Christian rock music or whatever, and you know, it was just odd to\n\nme that the Christians were picketing each other. And I just remember I\n\nturned to one of my cast mates and said, `You know, if these Christians are\n\npicketing each other, what makes us think we can get away with making this\n\nmovie, which is kind of an odd satire on them?'\n\nGROSS: What have you found so far? Did you go to any of the screenings, any\n\nof the advanced screenings?\n\nMr. CULKIN: I have not seen--I've kind of been hearing more and reading some\n\nof the kind of advanced--I don't know--either reviews or opinions or whatever.\n\nIt's interesting. The people who are represented in the movie, kind of the\n\nnew-wave Christians, but they're actually kind of digging it. They see it for\n\nwhat it is. But no, some of the fundament--I mean you should see. I just\n\ncame off of a press tour and a junket and one of the things--you know, I\n\nfielded basically every single question I could possibly field about, you\n\nknow, my faith and just the movie in general. And one of the things this guy\n\npulled out was like a printout from this Christian Web site or something. It\n\nwas saying about the movie, `Oh, you know, this is going to drive kids to\n\nsuicide. This is the reason why teen-age mothers have abortions and things\n\nlike that.' And it was just really sad because you could tell the person\n\nobviously had not seen the movie. It's kind of very sad that some people felt\n\nthe need to go out there and say those things just because from the surface\n\nwe're dealing with these issues. We're dealing with teen-age mothers and\n\nhomosexuality, so of course, you know.\n\nBut overall, I think, you know, the Catholics love it, of course, you know.\n\nBut, yeah, I think overall, I think, you know, it's going to get a pretty good\n\nreaction from everyone.\n\nGROSS: OK. So you go to this stadium concert with around--What?--40,000...\n\nMr. CULKIN: It's like 40,000 born-again Christians. I mean, it's all types.\n\nGROSS: OK. Right.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Like I said, there was, like, you know, goth Christians there.\n\nThere were, like, you know, kids with, like, dyed black hair and, like, you\n\nknow, a crucifix tattooed on the back of their hands and things. I mean,\n\nreally all types. It was interesting.\n\nGROSS: What was the reaction to you? Didn't people recognize you?\n\nMr. CULKIN: Yeah. It was very odd. It's not that normal, like, `Hey, can\n\nyou do the face?' or, you know, `Can I have your autograph?' or something like\n\nthat. No, I mean, it was actually, like, it was this interesting reaction of\n\njust, like, they were sincerely happy to see me there. They just, like,\n\nalmost thought I was one of them or something, you know. But it was this kind\n\nof really cool thing where they were just, like, `Yeah, you're here. Well,\n\nyou know, enjoy the show.' And there was this odd feeling of just, like, you\n\nknow, they just wanted me to be there, you know. They didn't want anything\n\nfrom me other than my presence and I don't know, my faith, I guess.\n\nGROSS: Well, I have to say, I think you've made such really interesting and\n\nin a way daring choices in the movies that you've decided to make as an adult.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Oh, thank you.\n\nGROSS: You know, you took, like, a hiatus of, I don't know, eight or nine\n\nyears away from acting.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Something like that, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Then you did a play on the West End in London.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: And then your re-emergence in movies was \"Party Monster\" in which you\n\nplayed a gay drug-addicted club kid who'd become so adult, he murders his drug\n\ndealer. Let me play a short clip from the movie, and this comes from early in\n\nthe film when you're doing a voice-over narration, telling the viewers about\n\nthe story of your life, and your narration intersects a little bit with your\n\nmother's description of your childhood.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Party Monster\")\n\nMr. CULKIN: (As Michael Alig) Hi. I'm Michael. I grew up in the Midwest.\n\nUsual story: felt different, really didn't fit in, but I wasn't going to turn\n\nthe other cheek, no siree. I started selling candy in school, jacked up the\n\nprices several hundred percent.\n\nMs. DIANA SCARWID: (As Elke Alig) This is my Michael. He was always making\n\nmoney. He just--he had a knack for it. Yeah. My little candy man. Mr.\n\nCULKIN: (As Michael Alig) Let's see. What else? Oh, once when I was 10, my\n\nSunday school teacher took me back to his house. He taught me how to French\n\nkiss, among other things.\n\nMs. SCARWID: (As Elke Alig) He really took my boy under his wing, very nice\n\nman.\n\nMr. CULKIN: (As Michael Alig) His mother caught us in the basement and she\n\nscreamed, `I told you not to bring them here!' And he said, `Don't. You'll\n\nfrighten him away!'\n\nMs. SCARWID: (As Elke Alig) One night Michael gave me a goodnight kiss that\n\na little boy should not give his mother.\n\nMr. CULKIN: (As Michael Alig) I thought everyone kissed like that.\n\nGROSS: Now you look and sound and so different in this movie than, say, in\n\nyour child movie era. I'm interested in that kind of voice that you got for\n\nthe film.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Oh, yeah. Well, you know, 'cause we were playing real people.\n\nWe kind of really tried to stay true to who they were. I mean, there's kind\n\nof certain rules that apply to playing a character like that, 'cause you want\n\nto try your best to talk like them. You want to try your best to move like\n\nthem, and things like that. And these people were very, very specific about\n\nthe way they talked and the way that they just kind of moved their arms and\n\nthings, and so we kind of had to play within those rules basically. But, you\n\nknow, me and Seth just went out there. And I remember, 'cause when he first\n\nsigned on to it, 'cause we kind of talked about doing this and we kind of had\n\na plan about how we're going to prepare and how we're going to just do all\n\nthese things.\n\nGROSS: This is Seth Green, your co-star.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Seth Green, my co-star. And so, yeah, he calls me up on the\n\nphone, he goes, `Hi, you know. Hi, Michael. It's James, you know. I was in\n\nNew York, but I'm sorry I missed you, and blah blah blah blah blah.' You know,\n\nhe kind of just leaves you this message on, like, a dead-on James St. James\n\nimpression. I couldn't believe it. Actually I listened to it on the phone\n\nand replayed the tape, and I couldn't believe it. And I was like, `Gosh, I\n\ngotta get on my game, too.'\n\nSo I started kind of messing around with the voice and basically playing\n\nrepeat-after-me games with the VCR and, you know, any kind of footage I could\n\nget of him, and I went to a voice person who kind of just literally was kind\n\nof almost phonetically write out some of the stuff. But, you know, `Just talk\n\nlike Michael,' you know. `Oh, James.' I called him up. I'm like, `James, I'm\n\nsorry I missed you when you were in town, you crazy,' you know, and just,\n\nlike, sending all these weird, you know, like, voice messages to each other.\n\nIt was fun, you know. And we really just wanted, like I said, we wanted to\n\ntalk like them and move like them as much as possible but at the same time not\n\nmake caricatures of them, and at the same time, you wanted enough creative\n\nfreedom within the characters to maneuver and do kind of whatever you felt was\n\nappropriate for storytelling. So it's a fine line we tread, but I think, you\n\nknow, we pulled it off all right.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Macaulay Culkin. He's starring in the new movie \"Saved!\"\n\nWe'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Macaulay Culkin, and he started\n\nmaking movies again after an eight- or nine-year hiatus, and he starred in\n\n\"Party Monster,\" a movie based on the true story of Michael Alig, and now he's\n\nstarring in \"Saved!\", which is set at a Christian high school.\n\nOne of the things I found really interesting about your portrayal of Michael\n\nAlig in \"Party Monster\" is that in one respect, he's the opposite of you, and\n\nhere's what I mean. You become a star at the age of--What?--eight or\n\nsomething, 10...\n\nMr. CULKIN: Mm-hmm. Yeah, basically.\n\nGROSS: ...you know, in \"Home Alone,\" and by the time you were 14, you wanted\n\nout of that whole star-making machinery stuff. You wanted to stop acting, and\n\nyou wanted out of show business, at least for a while, whereas he, he comes to\n\nNew York and he wants to be a star. I mean, he is living to be famous. He is\n\nliving to be seen.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Yeah. No, he's spent his entire life running towards fame, and\n\nI spent half my life running away from it.\n\nGROSS: Well, as someone who was a star as a child and who wanted to leave\n\nthat whole thing, did you understand what being famous, what being a star\n\nwould mean to somebody like Michael Alig? Did you understand what it meant to\n\nbe desperate or why somebody would want it?\n\nMr. CULKIN: It's interesting, because I truly don't understand fame. I kind\n\nof just accept it. You know, I mean, I've been doing this since I was four\n\nyears old, and it's just, you know 19 years now, and you know, for a while\n\nthere, you know, from when I was about eight years old on, I was playing the\n\ngame at a pretty high level overall. And so I don't know. It wasn't like I\n\nwas consciously saying to myself, `Oh, gosh, I want to be famous.' You know,\n\nit just kind of like, I had a lot of energy, and I enjoyed the attention that\n\ncame with being on stage. And it wasn't about the attention that came--not\n\nall the other attention, like, you know, photographers hiding in your bushes,\n\nyou know. I could definitely do without that and could've done even when I\n\nwas eight years old without that. It was that fame had nothing to do with it\n\nwith me, so it was kind of fun to get in there and kind of just--you know, why\n\nwould he want that? Where does this come from?\n\nYou know, it was coming from this kind of almost need to fit in almost, and he\n\nkind of took it to this hyperreality basically and created his own world where\n\nhe was famous, you know, 'cause in that world, you have to understand, back in\n\nthe club days, back in, like--you know, after Andy Warhol basically passed on,\n\nthe club scene was basically dead. Before, you'd go to these clubs and, `Oh,\n\nlook, there's Liza Minelli. Oh, and look over there. There's Cher.' And that\n\nwas kind of the way it was. And so but not they're all gone. All these kind\n\nof club idols were gone.\n\nAnd so Michael kind of swept in and created these celebrities basically. He\n\nbasically just said, `I'm famous because I say so, and I have absolutely no\n\nsubstance to me whatsoever, but that doesn't matter because I'm famous.' And\n\nit was just this weird concept that, you know, the celebrity without a cause\n\nkind of thing, you know. It was just, `famous because I say so.' You have to\n\nunderstand, all these people were coming from this world, this high school\n\nworld basically where you know, insiders and outsiders, and they were\n\ndefinitely the outsiders. They were homosexuals, they didn't dress right,\n\nthey didn't look right. There was a lot of things wrong with them. And so\n\nthen now they come to New York City and they're the kings of the clubs. Now\n\nall the people, all those like people who played high school football and all\n\nthose people who were really cool in high school were now standing outside of\n\ntheir clubs, wanting to get into their world, and they would kind of turn the\n\ntables on the entire world and said, `You know what? No, you're not in.\n\nYou're not allowed into our little world.' And it was interesting. It was\n\nkind of more coming from that than almost a need to be, like, you know, famous\n\nand on the cover of magazines. It was more kind of just turning the tables on\n\nthe entire world.\n\nGROSS: Now you mentioned that when you were eight, you already had tabloid\n\nphotographers hiding out in the bushes.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Essentially, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Man, what was that experience like at the age of eight, to have the\n\npaparazzi lying in wait for you?\n\nMr. CULKIN: You know, it was weird. I mean, at this point, it's almost like\n\nI don't know any better almost. I mean it was definitely odd, and I\n\ndefinitely have a very--I have just defense mechanisms, you know, in my mind\n\nwhenever--you know, every time I'm outside, I'm always kind of checking out\n\nthe horizon, seeing if there's anything weird out there, you know. I can\n\nrecognize a paparazzi by his bag. I swear to God. I mean, it's terrible.\n\nAnd so I don't know. It's kind of just the way it is, and I accept it and I\n\ntry my best to protect myself. And that was one of the reasons why I went\n\naway for so long, was that I couldn't. I didn't want to deal with that stuff,\n\nand even when I wasn't working, they were still out there and they were still\n\nkind of interested in some perverted kind of, you know, way. And so I just\n\ntried my best to protect myself and kind of just stay away from it and, you\n\nknow, I just try my best not to have my life end up as tabloid fodder,\n\nbecause, you know, that's not what it is, you know. I just live my life.\n\nAnd it's so funny. When someone's a celebrity, even the most normal aspects\n\nof their life become crazy. There's so many things about my life that are\n\ncrazy. It's like, oh, you know, I remember when I got married, it was such a\n\nbig deal. It was so, wow, you know. Like, you know, isn't he nuts? And it's\n\njust, I was just doing anything a normal human being would do. I went to high\n\nschool, I fell in love, I married the girl. Big deal, you know. But it's\n\njust so funny, you know.\n\nThere was this story I was actually just telling someone, like, not even an\n\nhour ago. I went to the Michael Jackson big reunion kind of concert he had.\n\nIt was, like, two or three years ago or something like that, and I brought a\n\nfriend of mine with me, and so I introduced her to Michael, and it was kind of\n\njust this, you know, average exchange. She goes, `Hi. Nice to meet you.' And\n\nhe goes, `Hi,' you know. And he goes, `Hey, you know, it looks like rain\n\ntonight. I hope it doesn't rain,' and you know, my friend was like, you know,\n\n`Yeah, you know, da da da.' And so after the conversation, I was talking to my\n\nfriend. She goes, `He's so weird.' I'm, like, `What do you mean?' She's like,\n\n`Well, you introduced me and then he starts talking about the rain.' I'm like,\n\n`He was talking about the weather.' I'm like, `There's nothing more normal\n\nthan that in the entire world. Actually I think it was one of the most normal\n\nthings he's done in the last 30 years, is talk to you about the weather.' But\n\nfor some reason, it becomes this crazy, outrageous thing because he is who he\n\nis, and I guess a conversation like that couldn't be more normal.\n\nSo there's just this weird thing around celebrities that even the simple\n\nthings in life are, you know, now crazy. You know, like in Us magazine, you\n\nknow, they'll have all kinds of pictures of, like, celebrities going and\n\ngetting coffee. Like, big deal. Like, really? You think that's interesting?\n\nGROSS: What are some of the differences for you between acting as a child and\n\nacting now as an adult. Yeah.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Well, it was interesting. I mean, when I was younger, it was\n\nkind of just more about--I had a lot of energy, and like I said, I enjoyed\n\nattention or at least the good kind of attention that came with being on\n\nstage, and so that was really all it came from. And a lot of the things I did\n\nwhen I was younger were literally just kind of--when you're a child actor, the\n\nmost important thing--the most important thing is you have to know your lines.\n\nIt's amazing. That's all they really care about when they're casting a kid,\n\nis know your lines.\n\nAnd so my father, you know, for everything that he was, he was still a very\n\nclever man, and so one of the things he did for the audition process was, you\n\nknow, they'd send me the script and they'd say, `Oh, do scene 22 and scene\n\n12,' or whatever, and they're very, very short, simple scenes. So what he'd\n\ndo is he'd go through the entire script and find the two longest speeches and\n\ntwo longest, hardest scenes and have me memorize, 'cause I had a pretty good\n\nmemory and, you know, so I remembered the whole thing. And so when I got into\n\nthe room, me being a cute little nine-year-old, they'd say, `Hey, can you do\n\nscene 12?' And I'd go, (gasps) `Wait, but I studied scene 30,' you know. And\n\nthey'd go, `Oh, no. It's OK, little kid. Just do what you studied.' And then\n\nI'd go out there and I'd reel off this long thing, and the next thing I know,\n\nI'd have the part, you know. And so like I said, it was more about having a\n\nlot of energy and learning your lines basically, whereas now it's different,\n\nyou know. You definitely can't just do that, you know. And so, you know, I\n\nmean, I try to bring more to my work. I mean, I'm definitely a more\n\nexperienced human being and so I just try to bring those kinds of things to\n\nthe table and just try to, you know...\n\nGROSS: And you get to choose your roles now.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Yeah, exactly. You know, after a while, I mean, I wasn't\n\nchoosing anything. It was just kind of like, `Oh, by the way, don't make any\n\nplans this summer because you're doing a movie,' and things like that. So now\n\nI'm in a position where I'm making my own choices. I'm putting stuff out\n\nthere that I want out there, and so it's cool. And so I just try and do\n\ndifferent kind of things, and you know, I just try to, you know, do good work.\n\nThat's all.\n\nGROSS: Macaulay Culkin will be back in the second half of the show.

I'm Terry Gross, back with Macaulay Culkin. He's\n\nstarring in the new film comedy \"Saved!\" He's returned to films after leaving\n\nthe industry for several years. He became famous as a child for his starring\n\nrole in the 1990 movie \"Home Alone.\" Here's a scene from early in the film,\n\nwhich he's fighting with his mother, played by Catherine O'Hara.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Home Alone\")\n\nMs. CATHERINE O'HARA: (As \"Mother\") Got 15 people in this house, you're the\n\nonly one who has to make trouble.\n\nCULKIN: (As \"Kevin\") I'm the only one getting dumped on.\n\nMs. O'HARA: You're the only one acting up. Now get upstairs.\n\nCULKIN: I am upstairs, dummy. Third floor?\n\nMs. O'HARA: Go.\n\nCULKIN: It's scary up there.\n\nMs. O'HARA: Don't be silly. Fuller will be up in a little while.\n\nCULKIN: I don't want to sleep with Fuller. You know about him. He wets the\n\nbed. He'll pee all over me. I know it.\n\nMs. O'HARA: Fine, we'll put him somewhere else.\n\nCULKIN: I'm sorry.\n\nMs. O'HARA: It's too late. Get upstairs.\n\nCULKIN: Everyone in this family hates me.\n\nMs. O'HARA: Then maybe you should ask Santa for a new family.\n\nCULKIN: I don't want a new family. I don't want any family. Families suck.\n\nMs. O'HARA: Just stay up there. I don't want to see you again for the rest\n\nof the night.\n\nCULKIN: I don't want to see you again for the rest of my whole life, and I\n\ndon't want to see anybody else either.\n\nMs. O'HARA: I hope you don't mean that. You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up\n\ntomorrow morning and you didn't have a family.\n\nCULKIN: No, I wouldn't.\n\nMs. O'HARA: Then say it again. Maybe it'll happen.\n\nCULKIN: I hope I never see any of you jerks again.\n\nGROSS: Was it your parents' wishes or your own wishes to start acting and to\n\ngo into movies?\n\nMr. CULKIN: It kind of just happened. It's this weird thing. You know,\n\nwhen I was six years old--you know, I started when I was four. I did some,\n\nlike, local community theater things and things like that. But when I was six\n\nyears old we got--a family friend of ours lived around the corner from us and\n\nshe was a stage manager at this off-off-Broadway theater called the\n\nEnsemble Studio Theater here in New York. And so what she--they were doing\n\nthis play and they needed, you know, a six-year-old boy and so, you know,\n\nthere was this--I'm third of seven. I'm this big, Irish family. And so she\n\nfigured, `Heck, you know, there's that big family. There's got to be someone\n\nthe right age and the right gender for this part.' And so she kind of just\n\ncomes on over and plucks me out. And I go to the audition, and I think at\n\nsome point I ended up on the table, I think. Just kind of doing my lines,\n\nstanding on top of a table. The next thing I know, I got the part. And it\n\nkind of just all went from there, really. It all happened really, really fast\n\nfrom that point, because I did that--it was, like, a one-month program and\n\nthen The New York Time reviewed it and then I did, I think, two or three more\n\nprograms with the Ensemble Studio Theater and then, literally, jumped right\n\ninto my first movie.\n\nAnd that--and then kind of the next one and the next one and the next one.\n\nAnd by--you know, I think my fourth movie was \"Uncle Buck.\" And then from\n\nthat point on, it was kind of just everything was almost in this kind of semi\n\ncruise control because on the set of that--you know, kind of--John Hughes, who\n\nalso wrote the \"Home Alone\" movies wrote that, and so kind of got the idea for\n\nthe \"Home Alone\" movies from this whole thing, and kind of had me in mind for\n\nit, but couldn't give me the part because he wasn't directing it, and so I had\n\nto meet with Chris Columbus. And, yeah, the next thing I know, I nailed that\n\none down and the rest is, shall we say, history.\n\nGROSS: You know, it's so easy, I think, to become a praise junky when you're\n\na kid. You know, if people are praising you...\n\nMr. CULKIN: I...\n\nGROSS: ...a lot.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Yeah, I really wasn't so much. I wasn't--you know, my parents\n\nwere pretty good overall. Like, they never told me how much money I was\n\nmaking or things like that. All that stuff kind of was news to me, and when I\n\nturned 18, I kind of--I found out how much money I'd made.\n\nGROSS: Weren't you reading the newspapers? I mean, I knew how much money you\n\nhad made.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Yeah, but you know what? No one does. That's the whole thing.\n\nPeople still don't. You should hear the kinds of numbers people throw out. I\n\nmean, they're either way too high or way too low.\n\nGROSS: Oh. Oh, OK.\n\nMr. CULKIN: I don't know. There's all kinds of numbers being thrown out\n\nthere. I don't release my financial records. It's not something that's all\n\nthat important. I mean, yes, it's important. It's--I'm definitely glad I\n\nhave the money. But at the same time, it's not like something--I don't\n\nrelease my numbers to Forbes magazine or something like that. But, yeah--no,\n\nI mean, it wasn't like I was doing it for even the gratification. I was just\n\nhaving a blast. I--you know, I enjoyed the people on set. You know, I liked\n\nworking with Chris Columbus. I liked--you know, I really liked--I loved the\n\nstunt people. They were always my favorite, you know? Like I had a good time\n\non set. And so it really wasn't...\n\nGROSS: When did that start to change? When did the good times start to not\n\nbe as good?\n\nMr. CULKIN: Well, you know what? I always liked the people on set. I always\n\nliked the hair and makeup people. I always liked the wardrobe. They were\n\nalways really cool people, and I always really got it. They understood the\n\nposition that I was in, really. And so it wasn't even that. It was kind of\n\nlike I needed a break. And I remember--I said this to my father and he kind\n\nof just wasn't listening. And next thing I know, I'm on the next set and then\n\nI sort of told, like, anyone who'd listen, but, you know, obviously I was\n\nwrong because no one was listening, and it was kind of this crazy thing. And\n\nso when my father was out of the picture and I was in a position to say, you\n\nknow, `I don't want to do this anymore,' I did. And so I went to whoever was\n\nlistening or whoever was out there and just said, `Listen, you can call it\n\nretirement, you can call it a break, you can say I quit, it doesn't really\n\nmatter because it's yours now. It's not mine. You guys can--you know, that\n\nMacaulay Culkin public persona is yours, you can do whatever you want with it.\n\nI'm gonna go to high school and I'm gonna do whatever else from there, but I'm\n\nprobably never gonna act again, and that's it. You know, I hope you made your\n\nmoney because there's no more coming from me.'\n\nGROSS: When you were young and getting paid, you know, millions and millions\n\nof dollars for--for movie roles, did you have a sense of what was riding on\n\nyou, financially? Not just your family, but like the director's future, the\n\nmovie company's future, you know, and all the people working for them? I\n\nmean, the--the movie had to be a success. Your name had to really...\n\nMr. CULKIN: Yeah, I know. I had--no, there was this weird kind of thing.\n\nPeople were kind of building this odd industry around me and it was kind of\n\nthis weird thing. And I mean, I don't know. I mean, I guess they tried their\n\nbest to shelter me from a lot of that stuff, but at the same time you can't\n\nreally hide from that, you know, just the overall pressures of it, but it\n\nwasn't anything that, like, made me crack or, you know, shattered me\n\nemotionally or something. It was just kind of--honestly, it was almost at a\n\npoint where I almost didn't know any better. You know, I mean, I understood\n\nthat other nine-year-olds weren't doing the same things I was, but at the same\n\ntime, it wasn't like I knew what Little League was like, you know, or what\n\nsummer camp was like. I mean, this is my life, and so I didn't really know\n\nanything else. So, you know, I mean part of it was, like, a little too much\n\nand that was one of the things why I got away, but it wasn't something I was\n\nconsciously saying to myself. You know, like, `Ooh, gosh, you know, I really\n\nhope we make that $50 million so the studio will hire me for their next\n\nmovie,' because at that point, I really didn't care.\n\nGROSS: You said that your father really pushed you. What are some of the\n\nthings you think he did wrong in terms of how hard he pushed you or what did\n\nhe push you to do?\n\nMr. CULKIN: It's funny. You know, it's one of these things where--I don't\n\nknow. I mean, people kind of have this weird thing about me and my father, at\n\nleast our relationship. They're always kind of like, `Oh, you know, isn't\n\nthat sad that, you know, you don't really see your father anymore or anything\n\nlike that. And it's like--you know, and that everything turned out the way\n\nthat it did.' But what people don't understand was that it was always like\n\nthis. That like, you know, he was not a good guy long before we were rich and\n\nfamous. It was kind of just a part of his personality. And from a very early\n\nage, I pretty much knew that, you know, I was, you know--either he was going\n\nto be gone or I was going to end up moving out of the house very early. It\n\nwas one or the other, and I knew that from a very early age, before fame,\n\nbefore money, before anything. And so...\n\nGROSS: What was it that he did that made you realize it?\n\nMr. CULKIN: He just--honestly, I--you know, I wish it was that easy. I wish\n\nI could point out to one incident or one thing and say that was it. I mean,\n\nhe was just not a good person. I mean, you have to understand. I mean, later\n\non, I mean, it was like, you know, I was making who knows how much money and I\n\nwas sleeping on the couch in the living room. Like I didn't even have a bed.\n\nI didn't have a room or a bed. I mean, you should have saw his room. I mean,\n\nyou should have saw the size of his bed, his television and things like that.\n\nAnd it wasn't--you know, it wasn't about making me, you know--it was kind of\n\nmore just putting you in your place and making sure that you knew who was in\n\ncharge of the whole thing. And it's kind of like--and he played those games\n\nwith you and he was always playing those games with you.\n\nAnd so, you know, even from a very early age, I knew what kind of person he\n\nwas and I knew--you know, I watched him very closely. I wanted to make sure\n\nhow I wasn't with my children and how I did not want to treat my wife and\n\nthings like that. I mean, I knew that from a very early age. I mean, I\n\nremember he was the first person I ever cussed at, ever. I was like four\n\nyears old and, you know, he's--I don't know. I forgot what he was doing or\n\nwhat I was doing, but, yeah, I told him to F off. I couldn't believe it, you\n\nknow? Like, wow, I didn't even believe it then. I was like, `Wow!' I was\n\nlike three or four years old and that came out of my mouth. It was just\n\nlike--but that was our relationship, that was the way it was.\n\nGROSS: Do you worry that as you say this he's listening now and feels bad\n\nhearing this?\n\nMr. CULKIN: There's a distinct possibility, you know, and that's kind\n\nof--that's a part of it. You know, I mean, I try--you know, it's just one of\n\nthese things where it's like it's hard not to talk about him because\n\neveryone's always asking and I'm not going to--you know, I don't hold back.\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. CULKIN: You know, I talk very candidly about him, but at the same time,\n\nyou know, I don't want to encourage him, you know, because he's far away and\n\nthat's a good thing.\n\nGROSS: You know, there's so many child stars who just are emotional cripples\n\nby the time they reach adulthood. You seem to have, like, emerged OK.\n\nMr. CULKIN: I guess so. I don't know. I mean, I--yeah, I understand that\n\nI'm a part of, like, some weird fraternity in some weird kind of convention\n\nor, you know, group of cliches or whatever and, you know, I understand that.\n\nBut at the same time, I don't--you know, I'm aware of it, but I don't try\n\nto--I don't fight it. Things are not...\n\nGROSS: Are you really OK?\n\nMr. CULKIN: Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry about me (pretends to sob). No, no,\n\nman, I feel good. I think--you know, and a lot of that had to do with me\n\ntaking some time off and me getting away from everything, you know, and\n\njust--I think--I feel like I'm a good--I'm a strong person because of it. I\n\nknow what I want out of life and I'm not kind of just doing this because I\n\ndon't know any better. I mean, I see a lot of--you know, not a lot but, you\n\nknow, there's a good amount of these child actors or former child actors who\n\nc--trying to make that transition into adulthood, but never really took the\n\ntime to live and never really took time to exist. And so how do you expect\n\nsomeone to act like a human being when they've never had the chance to be a\n\nhuman being?\n\nGROSS: Well, we're out of time. I want to thank you so much for talking with\n\nus.\n\nMr. CULKIN: Well, thank you for having me.\n\nGROSS: Macaulay Culkin is starring in the new movie \"Saved!\"\n\nComing up, we'll meet the writer and co--coming up we'll meet the director and\n\nco-writer, Brian Dannelly.

My guest, Brian Dannelly, directed and\n\nco-wrote the movie. Reviewing \"Saved!\" in the Chicago Reader, Jonathan\n\nRosenbaum wrote, quote, \"Brian Dannelly's first feature is audacious and\n\nlikeable, not only for its satirical treatment of fundamentalist Christian\n\nteen-agers and a couple of their elders, but also for its sympathy toward\n\nthem. It's been a long time since I've seen a teen movie as lively, as\n\nunpredictable, as generous and as tough-minded as this one,\" unquote.\n\n\"Saved!\" was produced by Single Cell, a company co-founded by Michael Stipe of\n\nthe band R.E.M.\n\nBrian Dannelly, welcome to FRESH AIR. What gave you the idea of doing a high\n\nschool comedy about cliques and gender confusion, teen pregnancy, a rock band,\n\nbut setting it at a Christian high school?\n\nMr. BRIAN DANNELLY (Director/Co-writer, \"Saved!\"): I think we sort of\n\nattacked it from a lot of different angles. I had to write a script while I\n\nwas a grad school at AFI, so one of the first rules about writing is you\n\nwrite...\n\nGROSS: The American Film Institute.\n\nMr. DANNELLY: American Film Institute, yeah. One of the first rules of\n\nwriting is you write about what you know. And I had gone to a Catholic\n\nelementary school, a Jewish summer camp and a Christian high school, so I was\n\nsort of familiar with this world, and that was interesting to me. I also\n\nhad--you know, it was right about--around the time that Columbine was\n\nhappening and Bush was getting elected and so that was interesting to me, and\n\nI realized sort of all these kids sort of were expressing their faith really\n\nopenly in sort of mainstream America. And that was different from when I had\n\ngone to a Christian high school. And the other sort of approach was loving\n\nteen movies, having grown up on John Hughes movies and sort of taking the idea\n\nlike what if you did sort of a John Hughes-style movie and had subversive\n\nundertones and, you know, sort of had everything in the movie that you would\n\nnever have seen in those movies? So it was kind of--that was how we\n\napproached it when we started writing it.\n\nGROSS: Now it's interesting. I mean, you're satirizing religion in it, but\n\nthe people at the end of the film, I mean, they still have faith. What you're\n\nreally satirizing in a way is the self-righteousness and the way that certain\n\nreligious people use their faith to justify selfishness, jealousy and pride,\n\nsaying that it's all for the sake of Jesus.\n\nMr. DANNELLY: Well, it's really, you know, taking a look at fanaticism and\n\nzealotry, you know, and sort of putting it in the micro-cosmo of the high\n\nschool, which seemed like kind of the best way to address that, because when\n\nyou're young, you're sort of more open to a lot of different ideas, but you're\n\nalso more vulnerable. So that's sort of where that came from.\n\nGROSS: When you were going to Christian high school, were most of the\n\nstudents in the school--did they want to be there? Did they want to be, like,\n\nfull-time Christians, if you know what I mean, or were they often rebelling\n\nagainst the teachings in the school?\n\nMr. DANNELLY: There wasn't a lot of rebellion. There was the--a lone Jewish\n\ngirl that went to my school, so...\n\nGROSS: Oh, there's a character like that in the movie.\n\nMr. DANNELLY: Yeah, Cassandra. Everything in the movie is based on fact,\n\npersonal experience or extensive research, which was really, really important\n\nto me when I was making the film. But there was this lone Jewish girl, and,\n\nyou know, people were always trying to get her saved, and she was very tough\n\nin this atmosphere. I have no idea why she went to this school, probably a\n\nsimilar circumstance to my own, but--so that was sort of interesting. And I\n\nremember there was this other sort of rebellious girl who--you know, she was\n\nthe first girl I ever kissed, and, you know, five years later she turned out\n\nto be, you know, a big lesbian. So it's kind of a very interesting\n\nenvironment to grow up.\n\nGROSS: What were some of the rules that you had to follow in your high\n\nschool?\n\nMr. DANNELLY: In my high school, we couldn't dance, we couldn't be more than\n\n10 inches from the opposite sex, you know, girls' skirts had to be three\n\ninches from their knee if they were kneeling. So it was pretty strict. It\n\nwas much stricter than the current movement, you know, sort of the Jesus rocks\n\nmovement, which is--you know, it's such a mirror for pop culture.\n\nThere's--it's really hard almost to tell the difference sometimes if you're,\n\nyou know, attending one of these assemblies or one of these rallies or rock\n\nconcerts. So that's a huge difference from my experience.\n\nGROSS: Were there school dances in which you were allowed to get closer than\n\nsix inches to someone of...\n\nMr. DANNELLY: No.\n\nGROSS: ...the opposite sex?\n\nMr. DANNELLY: No dancing allowed. Our senior prom was a puppet show at the\n\nPeter Pan Inn, so we were safe.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Brian Dannelly, and he co-wrote and directed the new\n\nmovie \"Saved!,\" which is a comedy set in a Christian high school. I want to\n\nplay a scene from \"Saved!,\" and this is a scene in which the whole student\n\nbody is assembled in the auditorium. The girl band, the Christian girl band\n\nhas just performed, and now Pastor Skip is coming in and he's the pastor who\n\nthinks he's really down with the young people, and he comes in by doing a kind\n\nof a somersault, by doing a flip, and then he starts, you know, talking in all\n\nthis hip-hop language because he's so hip. So let me play that scene.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Saved!\"; cheers and music)\n\nMr. MARTIN DONOVAN: (As Pastor Skip) Welcome to the first assembly of the\n\nyear. Give it up for Jesus, who's in the house!\n\n(Soundbite of cheers)\n\nMr. DONOVAN: All right! All right! All right! Let's get our Christ on.\n\nLet's kick your Jesus style. Y'all want to rap with the ultimate rapper,\n\nright? The ultimate CEO?\n\nUnidentified Student #1: Yeah.\n\nMr. DONOVAN: The biggest celebrity of them all? Who's down with G-O-D?\n\n(Soundbite of cheers)\n\nUnidentified Student #1: Down with the G-O-D! That's right! Whoo!\n\nMr. DONOVAN: All right! Jesus rules!\n\nMr. DONOVAN and Students: (In unison) Jesus rules! Jesus rules! Jesus\n\nrules! Jesus rules!\n\nMr. DONOVAN: All right! All right!\n\nGROSS: And that was Martin Donovan as Pastor Skip, a scene from the new movie\n\n\"Saved!\"\n\nBrian, did you ever see anything quite like that?\n\nMr. DANNELLY: Absolutely. That character in that sort of assembly is a mix\n\nof actual assemblies and also sort of larger Christian, you know, rallies,\n\nyouth groups, Christian concerts, that there is a certain set-up that's very\n\nsimilar to all of them, and Pastor Skip character is sort of a creation of a\n\nbunch of different sort of young youth pastors. A little bit of Carman, who's\n\non TBN. He's sort of this pastor who, through the years--he's been around for\n\nmaybe 15 years, but who like with every sort of change in pop culture, he\n\nchanges with it. Like he was hip-hop, he did rap, he did disco. He's sort of\n\nkind of all over the place, and so I sort of found that fascinating.\n\nAnd they do. You know, like I said earlier, it's such a mirror for pop\n\nculture that they really sort of have adopted so much of the language and the\n\nstyle of, you know, contemporary culture that you do find a lot of the\n\npreachers kind of talking in this awkward cool, you know, language.\n\nGROSS: There's a lot of pop culture that has its parallel in Christian pop\n\nculture, so there's, like, a lot of Christian rock bands and metal bands and\n\npunk bands and there's probably Christian hip-hop bands.\n\nMr. DANNELLY: All of it, yeah.\n\nGROSS: All of that, yeah. What were some of the surprising things that you\n\nfound in Christian pop culture when you were doing research for the movie?\n\nMr. DANNELLY: I think one of the sort of--I don't know if ironic's the right\n\nword, but you know there's this whole sort of concept of not idolizing anyone\n\nbecause it's a sin, but you go to these concerts and you have these bands and\n\nyou have all these kids sort of screaming for the band, and a lot of the\n\nbands, because they're really conscious of that, don't have pictures of\n\nthemselves on the T-shirt. They use symbols. So it's sort of a way of\n\naddressing that, but I sort of found it an interesting conflict, you know,\n\nwithin that community.\n\nThe other thing that's really important to say about this film is the\n\nfundamentalist community is so varied that it's really hard to say\n\nfundamentalists are like this, because we'd go to a Christian rock concert,\n\nsay, in Anaheim, and there'd be Christians protesting the Christians inside,\n\nand you know you have, you know, Jerry Falwell just called the movie the most\n\nhateful movie to come out of Hollywood in years. But I just did an interview\n\nwith Christianity Today with, like, a pastor, a teacher and a student, and\n\nthey loved the movie. So it's a very--you know, it's a very diverse community\n\nthat I don't think there's a hard-core center of it.\n\nGROSS: Now I read that scenes that you wanted to shoot in a church--after the\n\nchurch that you had selected as a location found out more about the script,\n\nthey asked you to leave?\n\nMr. DANNELLY: It's funny. I always tell this story, but somehow--somewhere\n\nearly on, someone asked Michael Stipe what the film was about and he said it\n\nwas like a vampire movie, but the Christian teens are vampires. So that was\n\nall over the Internet. So when we were, you know, actually shooting the film\n\nand looking for locations, and if people typed in \"Saved!\" that was the quote\n\nthat came up and, you know, we lost locations and we lost, you know, Christian\n\nmusic because of it.\n\nSometimes it wasn't the script. Sometimes it was just the scene. And I can\n\nunderstand anyone reading a certain scene out of context could be disturbing.\n\nAnd also it's really hard to tell the tone of a film by reading the script, so\n\nI think that when people see the movie, I think they're actually surprised at\n\nhow it's funny but it's also gentle, it's sweet, it's very affirming. I\n\nalways say it affirms and offends. You know, it has sort of a mixture of both\n\nthose things. But, yeah, we definitely lost locations.\n\nGROSS: So what church did you finally get?\n\nMr. DANNELLY: It was a Unitarian church, and those guys were great. I mean,\n\nwe shot the exterior of the church and we shot the interior scene where Mary\n\nsort of questions the validity of the Virgin Mary, you know, having a\n\nmiraculous birth.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Brian Dannelly. He directed and co-wrote the new movie\n\n\"Saved!\" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of a cappella song)\n\nGroup of Singers: (Singing) Do do do do do do, do do do do do. Do do do do\n\ndo, do do do do do. Holy, holy, holy! Lord God almighty. Early in the\n\nmorning our song shall rise to thee. Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty.\n\nGod in three persons, blessed Trinity. Holy, holy, holy! All the saints\n\nadore thee, casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea; cherubim\n\nand seraphim falling down before thee, who was, and is, and evermore shall be.\n\nHoly, holy, holy! Lord God almighty. All thy works praise thy name in earth\n\nand sky and sea. Holy, holy, holy...\n\nGROSS: My guest is Brian Dannelly. He directed and co-wrote the new movie\n\n\"Saved!,\" a comedy set in a Christian high school.\n\nHas \"Saved!\" been a difficult film to market because it could be perceived as\n\nvery controversial by some Christian fundamentalists? On the other hand, I\n\ncould see a lot of Christian fundamentalists, teen-agers particularly, really\n\nloving it.\n\nMr. DANNELLY: I think it's been a real challenge for MGM/UA, and I think\n\nthey've done a pretty amazing job. I mean, sort of their approach has been,\n\nwe've been at like every single film festival. It's been screened for, you\n\nknow, gay kids. It's been screened for cinephiles. It's been screened for\n\nthe religious community. It's been screened for, you know, regular, you know,\n\naverage Joe people. We've screened for--you know, we've done everything we\n\ncan to get the word out--or MGM's done everything they can to get the word out\n\nabout the movie, and it's a little bit confusing 'cause, like I said, the\n\nChristian community is so diverse, I know that they've gotten some slack for\n\npresenting the film to a Christian audience, but what I don't think people\n\nrealize is that there is a large portion of that audience that really embraces\n\nthis movie.\n\nGROSS: Do you think that \"The Passion of the Christ\" is affecting the\n\nmarketing of the film or affecting how the film will be perceived?\n\nMr. DANNELLY: You know, I think absolutely. We had no idea about \"The\n\nPassion of Christ\" when we made the movie, and because of \"Passion of the\n\nChrist\" we've gotten so much attention that I'm not sure we would have had had\n\nit not been released. So I mean, I think we got--we didn't set the release\n\ndate because of \"The Passion of the Christ.\" It was all sort of very\n\ncoincidental. But I notice like on the chat boards a lot of people from\n\n\"Passion of Christ\" chat boards are on the \"Saved!\" chat boards, so there's\n\ndefinitely this dialogue going on that I think that that opened up for us.\n\nGROSS: What's the dialogue been like? Have you heard...\n\nMr. DANNELLY: It's--the dialogue, it's amazing. We're getting like--what's\n\nreally kind of amazing to me is we're this little $5 million film that we shot\n\nin 28 days that no one made any money on, that I don't think people were even\n\nsure how it would be received into the world. So like right now we're at,\n\nlike, the number seven top movie on IMDb, and that's sort of with no\n\nadvertising and not a lot of awareness about the movie. The dia...\n\nGROSS: That's the Internet Movie Database.\n\nMr. DANNELLY: Yes, which I--because it's my first film, I obsessively\n\n(unintelligible) everything about the film every single night, literally every\n\nnight. It's sick. But the dialogue is really interesting, because most of\n\nthe controversy is coming from people who haven't seen the film. But sort of\n\nbeyond the film itself, a lot of the dialogue is between, you know, Christian\n\nkids and kids who are secularists and, you know, there's just sort of this\n\ndialogue going back and forth, like, `Well, I went to a school like this. My\n\nfriends are Christians and they were really cool.' Or, you know, `I went to\n\nschool like this and Christians were really mean and it was awful and'--I\n\nmean, it's just back and forth. I think we're getting hits like every 20\n\nminutes now on the Web site, which is--and some of the stuff is scathing and\n\nmean and, you know, talking about this film was made by, you know, a New York\n\nJew and Michael Stipe, who's an atheist and, you know--it premiered at the\n\nJewish Music Fest in Park City and just like really anti-Semitic stuff. And\n\nit's a very bizarre thing to read at night.\n\nGROSS: May I ask you about your faith, if you consider yourself to have\n\nfaith, to practice any form of religion?\n\nMr. DANNELLY: You know, it's always changing. I wouldn't say after--it's a\n\nreally odd experience, because I had a lot of faith when I was making the\n\nfilm. I mean, I literally would pray every day. I had this very close\n\nconnection, making sure I was always doing the right thing, that I wasn't\n\ngoing too far, that, you know--so I felt like I had this really close\n\nrelationship with, you know, God, while I was making the movie. And then,\n\nlike, 9/11 happened and the war happened and I started, like, reading\n\ndifferent books about, you know, Iraq and different policies, and really I\n\njust totally lost faith, which was really interesting to me, because, you\n\nknow, I was like, well, your first job as a human being is personal\n\nresponsibility and kindness, and that you shouldn't rely on being punished or\n\ngoing to hell or, you know, going to heaven. Like, you just have that--it's\n\nan innate responsibility that you have to be responsible for. And so it was\n\nkind of weird for me to live in a world where, you know, for a period of time\n\nI didn't believe in God.\n\nBut, you know, the whole time you think you don't believe in God, you're\n\nconstantly having dialogue with him, so it's like kind of a strange\n\nexperience. And it's only been recently where, you know, I've just sort of\n\nopened myself up to it again. It's a very--you know, I find it very\n\nconfusing.\n\nGROSS: Hmm. And is the fact that you find it confusing one of the reasons\n\nwhy you wanted to make the movie?\n\nMr. DANNELLY: Absolutely. Because I think there are so many different\n\nreligions in the world and, you know, you--again, I go back to that line,\n\n`They can't all be wrong, but they can't all be right,' you know. I mean,\n\n`They can't all be right, but they can't all be wrong,' right? Because it\n\njust makes so much sense to me, and I think it's so dangerous to say that\n\nthere is just one way to find God, and to judge people on that.\n\nGROSS: Brian Dannelly directed and co-wrote the new movie \"Saved!\"\n\n(Credits)\n\nGROSS: I'm Terry Gross.\n\nWe'll end with the closing credit music from \"Saved!\" performed by Mandy\n\nMoore, one of the film's stars, and Michael Stipe, one of the producers.\n\n(Soundbite of \"God Only Knows\")\n\nMs. MANDY MOORE: (Singing) I may not always love you, but long as there are\n\nstars above you...\n\nMs. MOORE and Mr. MICHAEL STIPE: (Singing) ...you never need to doubt it.\n\nI'll make you so sure about. God only knows I'd be without you.\n\nMs. MOORE: (Singing) If you should ever leave me, well, life would still go\n\non, believe me."
