        "text": "From the straight-laced preacher’s daughter in “A\n\nWalk to Remember” to an over-protected president’s\n\ndaughter in “Chasing Liberty,” Mandy Moore has\n\nestablished her ability to play the good girl, and she plays it\n\nwell.\n\nBut her upcoming film, “Saved!,” a teen comedy about\n\na Christian high school that serves as a battle-ground for teenage\n\nJesus lovers and their outcasted counterparts, is sure to raise the\n\nquestion ““ has this good girl finally gone bad?\n\nMoore plays Hilary Faye, the domineering popular girl of\n\nAmerican Eagle Christian High School, who controls the school with\n\nher own blind faith and an iron fist. In one scene, Hilary\n\norganizes a mandatory prayer circle with the outward objective of\n\nsaving the soul of a classmate, Dean, who is revealed to be gay,\n\nall the while knowingly tormenting her close friend Mary, played by\n\nJena Malone, who is Dean’s girlfriend.\n\n“It’s always more fun to play this kind of\n\nbitch,” Moore said. “My character is a little\n\nover-zealous, but she means well at the end of the day; she’s\n\njust a little misguided.”\n\nAs her first independent film, Moore joined the ranks of such\n\nseasoned veterans as Malone and Heather Matarazzo. According to\n\nMoore, although joining the cast at first was a lot like being the\n\nnew kid in school, passing up the opportunity to be in\n\n“Saved!” was never a consideration.\n\n“This was sort of a no-brainer; I couldn’t say no to\n\nthis movie,” she said. “Beyond the script being so\n\nfunny and so different and much cooler and interesting than\n\nanything I have really read before, (there was) this amazing cast\n\nof young great people that I have so much respect for.”\n\nAnd while Moore’s singer-turned-actress image might have\n\nstuck out like a sore thumb in this group of actors, proving she\n\nhad talent was no easy task, especially with such a challenging\n\ncharacter.\n\n“You could read the script and totally see her as this\n\nover-the-top caricature, and I didn’t want her to be like\n\nthat because there had to be a reason why people liked her and why\n\nshe was popular,” said Moore. “If she was just mean and\n\nrunning around all the time, there’s no way that she would be\n\nin that position at her school.”\n\nAnd she does it well. According to the film’s director\n\nBrian Dannelly, she even improvised many of the scenes that made it\n\ninto the final cut.\n\n“I mean, who knew? In fact, by the end of the movie I was\n\neven encouraging her to (improvise) in every scene,” said\n\nDannelly.\n\nThe cast did research, including going to a few Christian\n\nconcerts, to make sure their characters on screen didn’t seem\n\ntoo much like cartoon versions of real people they were\n\nportraying.\n\n“The great thing about the film is that it’s not\n\nmean-spirited; it’s not mocking anyone,” said Moore.\n\n“These are real people, and while they do show up as\n\nstereotypes ““ you have the good Christian, the villain, the\n\nboy in the wheelchair, the Jewish girl ““ the film really\n\nbrings a reality to who they are and the situations they are\n\nin.”\n\nMoore’s own situation may be different, but it’s\n\njust as complicated as her character’s. Her next film\n\nproject, “Romance & Cigarettes,” is a musical\n\ncomedy written and directed by John Turturro and set for larger\n\ndistribution. But she’s also considering her future in\n\nindependent films.\n\n“It’s fun to just have a bit more creative\n\ncontrol,” said Moore. “You don’t have a bunch of\n\npeople standing around the monitors and going up to the director\n\nand whispering ideas.”\n\nWhat she’ll do with that control is another issue. While\n\nshe hopes to continue to grow and mature as an artist, she\n\ndoesn’t deny that her good-girl image will probably stick\n\nwith her for a while.\n\n“I’m so edgy,” she said jokingly.\n\nWhile Moore might not be the next Courtney Love, she’s\n\npushing the envelope with her career decisions. Since her 1999\n\nbreak-out as the sugar-coated 15-year-old pop princess who\n\nplayfully belted out the hit “Candy,” Moore seems to\n\nhave left the days of so-sweet-it-hurts music behind her.\n\n“Sometimes people say, “˜Mandy Moore, she’s\n\nsweet,’ or “˜she’s cute,'” she said.\n\n“I was really young, and it’s not necessarily that\n\npeople still see me in that light, but they see me as the good\n\ngirl, and it’s hard to break out of that.”\n\nBut her days atop the TRL charts might not be over yet.\n\nCurrently in pre-production of a new CD that she’s looking to\n\nrecord this summer, Moore maintains that both singing and acting\n\nare what she wants to pursue. While her last album,\n\n“Coverage,” didn’t thrive atop the Billboard\n\ncharts, it did achieve critical acclaim for its ingenuity. Covering\n\nsongs from earlier generational greats such as Elton John, Carol\n\nKing and even Joni Mitchell, Moore proved she had a wider range of\n\nmusical tastes than some people twice her age.\n\nOf the new things she’s taking on, Moore says that writing\n\nher own music is one of the most important things to her. But\n\nfollowing the time-tested favorites on “Coverage” is a\n\nhard act to follow.\n\n“I’ve been writing a lot, literally sitting down and\n\nstarting and finishing a song,” said Moore. “It’s\n\nnew for me and it may sound cheesy, but it’s exciting ““\n\nI’m going to be able to go on stage for as long as I’m\n\na recording artist and sing my own music that comes from me, my\n\nheart and my mind.”\n\nBut changing her image has required more than just learning to\n\nwrite music. From chopping off her girlish golden locks in exchange\n\nfor a more sophisticated brunette look to being pickier about the\n\nmovie roles she selects, Moore maintains that she’s more than\n\nwilling to do what it takes to achieve success. Or at least almost\n\nanything.\n\n“I’m not going to be an amateur porn star or\n\nanything, but sometimes it’s hard to change people’s\n\nperceptions of you,” she said.\n\nAnd keeping her clothes on, as well as her dignity, has always\n\nbeen something Moore has prided herself on. After emerging into an\n\nera dominated by scantily-clad peers Britney Spears and Christina\n\nAguilera, in the past Moore had been both praised and criticized by\n\nthe media for her comparatively conservative look.\n\n“The media wanted someone on the other side, who was doing\n\nthe exact opposite,” said Moore. “But people\n\ndon’t have it wrong ““ I am a good girl; I literally go\n\nout once in a blue, blue moon.”\n\n“I don’t like that world,” she added. “I\n\ndon’t like being around a bunch of drunk people.”\n\nWhile Moore might avoid the Hollywood club scene, that\n\ndoesn’t mean she spends all her time in Bible study, like her\n\ncharacter in “Saved!” She said she falls in line with\n\none of the main themes of the film: That in the end, faith and\n\ncaring for your fellow man transcends any particular religion."
