        "text": "Fresh off being nominated for eleven Academy Awards for his wonderfully surreal new film Poor Things, Yorgos Lanthimos’ next project is set to see him remake 2003 South Korean fantasy comedy Save The Green Planet.\n\nWhile it’s a somewhat left-field move, it’s also a very Lanthimos move. Directed by Jang Joon-hwan, the original film’s plot follows a young amateur ufologist living in Korea who believes an alien invasion is imminent. His next move is to abduct political and business leaders who he suspects are aliens in disguise, taking them to an underground torture chamber. Soon the police hire a disgraced private detective to track him down, while he’s having his own problems convincing his devoted girlfriend that he’s not totally cuckoo.\n\nAs you can see, it’s a wild story, but one you can totally imagine Lanthimos adapting with his signature comedy and off-kilter aesthetic. So far, the only cast rumour is that Emma Stone is in talks to play the girlfriend, which would be their third time collaborating. While we wait for more info, watch the original trailer below."
