        "text": "Welcome to the Save Me film and accompanying resources. The film is dedicated to all young people suffering the hardships of exploitation. It was first created to highlight that extra-familial harm can happen in schools, peer friendship groups and in local communities.\n\nIn 2018, Enfield Council made a successful bid and was awarded funding from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities formally known as Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government. Enfield council commissioned Aviard Inspires production company to produce and direct the short film, due to his past successes and experiences working with young people.\n\nYoung people from KRATOS (KRATOS stands for ‘power and strength) who are part of Enfield Care Council and the Young Leaders within Enfield were consulted on the storyline, the script and took part in filming which took place in various locations in Enfield.\n\nWe want this resource to be seen by young people, to be used by professionals who provide direct work to children, families and carers and community leaders to safeguard our children. We want parents to be aware and understand what it’s like to walk in a young person’s shoes.\n\nSave Me trailer\n\nWatch the trailer of Save Me.
