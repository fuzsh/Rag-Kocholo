        "text": "American film director and screenwriter\n\nBrian Dannelly is a German born American film director and screenwriter best known for his work on the 2004 film Saved!\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nDannelly was born in Würzburg, Germany then moved with his family to Baltimore, Maryland at age 11.[1] He was raised Catholic; he attended a Catholic elementary school, Arlington Baptist High School in Baltimore, and a Jewish summer camp.[2] He was expelled from first grade for hitting a nun,[3] and later expelled from high school—which he describes as \"one of the strictest schools in the nation\"[4]—for excessive demerits.[2] He started questioning his sexuality in high school, saying \"I remember I'd pray every night that I wasn't gay, and please God, please God, anything I could do—just don't make this happen.\"[5] He came out at the age of 17 and was thrown out of his house by his parents, who eventually came to accept his sexuality.[5]\n\nDannelly graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County with a degree in visual arts in 1997.[6]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nDannelly wrote and directed the short film \"He Bop\" in 2000, and in 2004, he made the feature film Saved!, which he directed and co-wrote with Michael Urban. He had begun to write the Saved! script after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, which he claims took him \"back to [his] roots\" in a Christian high school.[7] He and Urban began writing the script while attending the American Film Institute Conservatory.[8][9] Much of the story was drawn from his own experiences with \"conservative Christian subculture\", including Christian rock concerts, being \"this gay kid in a Christian school\"[10] and having visions of Jesus.[5] He said \"In the Baptist school there was the one Jewish girl that everyone was trying to save, there was a girl who got pregnant, there was a gay kid\"—all principal characters in Saved![11] He claims that nothing in the film came from his imagination: \"Everything in the movie comes from either something I experienced, or something I witnessed, or something I researched.\"[10]\n\nAfter Saved! was released, Dannelly became a regular series director on the television show Weeds.[1] He also directed the 2006 pilot episode of Help Me Help You and Pushing Daisies' 2007 episode \"Corpsicle\". His most recent film, Runner Up, about a beauty pageant queen who organizes a pageant in a women's prison, is currently in production.[1] He was set to direct a film based on The Guided Man by L. Sprague de Camp, but the project was shelved.[12] He has written the spec script titled Army Geek.[1]\n\nIn 2017, Dannelly worked as a director on two episodes of the second season of the Netflix series Haters Back Off, starring Colleen Ballinger (Miranda Sings), Angela Kinsey and Erik Stocklin.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
