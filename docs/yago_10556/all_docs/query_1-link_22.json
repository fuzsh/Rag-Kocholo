Bring us your motion picture and sound elements so we can get them indexed and help you find a safe berth.\n\nFor celluloid, cold storage at a non-profit archive is ideal. If your film is in a digital format, it may be at even greater risk. Help us help you to protect ephemeral digital files\n\nReactivate\n\nIn association with discerning exhibitors and distributors and the support of sympathetic journalists, we are getting these fantastic films to new audiences.\n\nNationtime and Cane River had never been released. Now they’ve entered the canon and are changing the way we view Black cinema and American cultural and political history."
