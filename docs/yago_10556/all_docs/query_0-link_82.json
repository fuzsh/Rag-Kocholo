        "text": "On Stage: Another Idol Pays Her Rent, and More\n\nAmerican Idol Season 1 finalist Tamyra Gray will join the cast of Broadway's Rent on May 29. During her run, she'll share the stage with original players Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp, who, despite middle age, return to their humble roots July 30.... Nathan Lane and Luke Duke himself, Tom Wopat, have been invited to appear in a workshop of Catch Me If You Can, a musicalization of the Steven Spielberg film. The same team that turned Hairspray into a Broadway blockbuster hope to cast Lane in the Tom Hanks role and Wopat as the juvenile con's dad. No word on who will fill Leonardo DiCaprio's disguises.... Weeds scribe Rinne Groff and others are turning Saved! into an off-Broadway musical to premiere next spring. &#151;Reporting by Raven Snook\n\nWeeds Dealer's Beau Is a Keeper\n\nTonight at 10 pm/ET, Showtime's highest-rated series,&nbsp;Weeds is back, to give fans another seasonlong buzz. When last we tuned in, Nancy (Emmy nominee Mary-Louise Parker's pot-peddlin' mama) had finally bedded her new beau, Peter, only to learn that he is (of all things!) a DEA agent.

TVGuide.com: After watching Weeds' first-season finale, I figured you wer\n\nScrubs Hold on a sec — let me...\n\nScrubs Hold on a sec — let me make sure I fully understand what's going on here. Not only do we get an entire episode celebrating the honor and glory of the great American air band, but we also get air versions of Loverboy, Boston, Fountains of Wayne and Bel Biv DeVoe? Somebody pinch me. And for those of you who adored Turk's \"Kung Fu Fighting\" sequence last month, I submit for your approval the sheer magic that is his performance of BBD's \"Poison.\" (Why do I have the sneaking suspicion that Donald Faison has had that choreography in his back pocket since junior high? Three words: aged to perfection.) Now that I've gotten that out of my system, I suppose I'm ready to move on to our relevant bit of sweeps-related stunt casting. Get it? Beca"
