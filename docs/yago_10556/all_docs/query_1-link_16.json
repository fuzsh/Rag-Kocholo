        "text": "Emma Stone, who just won a BAFTA for her performance in “Poor Things” and is nominated for an Oscar, is in talks to reunite with Yorgos Lanthimos on his remake of South Korean fantasy comedy “Save the Green Planet.”\n\nThe project, which is expected to start shooting in the summer in the U.K. and New York, has been in the works for several years. Jang Joon-hwan, who directed the original South Korean movie, was previously attached to helm the English-language remake, based on a screenplay by Will Tracy, whose credits include HBO’s “Succession” and Searchlight’s “The Menu.”\n\nAn eccentric black comedy, the story of “Save the Green Planet” revolves around a disillusioned young man who captures and tortures a businessman whom he believes to be part of an alien invasion. A battle of wits ensues between the captor, his devoted girlfriend, the businessman and a private detective.\n\nStone would most likely play a supporting role. The project would mark Lanthimos and Stone’s sixth collaboration. The pair first worked together on “The Favourite” and will next have “Kinds of Kindness,” an anthology film which also stars Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe and Margaret Qualley. “Kinds of Kindness” is slated to be released later this year and could world premiere at Cannes. “Poor Things” is nominated for 11 Oscars, including best picture, director, actress and supporting actor, among others.\n\nThe remake project also reteams Lanthimos with Ed Guiney and Andrew Lowe at Element Pictures for the sixth time. The banner will produce the movie alongside Ari Aster’s Square Peg and CJ ENM (previously named CJ Entertainment).\n\n“Green Planet” became a cult hit and festival favorite for CJ Entertainment when it came out in 2003. It won prizes at fantasy festivals including those in Bucheon, Buenos Aires and Brussels, and markets including Rotterdam, Tokyo Filmex and Moscow. It also earned Jang the Golden Bell Award for best new director in Korea."
