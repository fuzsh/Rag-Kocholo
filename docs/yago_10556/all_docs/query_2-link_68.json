        "text": "The smarty pants folks at Universal have decided to push up the release date for \"Oblivion\" to April 23rd 2013 from it's original release date of July 10th. The movie stars Tom Cruise as soldier who's court marshaled and shipped off to a deserted planet only to find he isn't alone. I think I'd move to another planet too if I was promised I'd be alone with Tom Cruise. Not for the reason you're thinking, sicko! It's so I can have sex with him.\n\nThe only thing worse than beating a dead horse is beating a dead vampire. I don't think that makes any sense. But my point here is that Alcon Entertainment has tapped Brian Dannelly to direct their new vampire comedy \"Suckers\". I'm not going to bother explaining the plot because you can probably guess it. but Dannelly has directed episodes of \"Weeds\", \"The United States of Tara\" and \"Pushing Daisies\" so it might not be too shabby. But I'm a glass half full kind of guy.\n\nYou tell me Danny Trejo, Anthony Michael Hall and Mickey Rourke are going to be in a movie and I listen my friends. The movie is called \"Dead In Tombstone\" and apparently Trejo comes back from the dead to bring the hammer down on his half brother after being double crossed in a mine robbery. This might be the most perfect movie ever made. Minus Mickey Rourke actually. That guy creeps the hell out of me.\n\nPeople are going to throw a fit but honestly Lionsgate teaming up with WWE to remake \"Leprechaun\" might be amazing. There's no script, no cast, and no real other news but what the hell can go wrong. And while we're at it I think Jennifer Aniston is delightful. There, I said it."
