Try as she may, Mary can't pray ... or sleep ... the gay away. Much to her surprise Mary discovers that she's pregnant. Criticized for her acceptance of Dean by her holier-than-thou classmates led by the pious Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore, A Walk to Remember), Mary will find acceptance from kindred spirits: the school's geeks, including Hillary Faye's wheelchair-bound brother, Roland (Macaulay Culkin, Home Alone) and the school's only Jewish student, Cassandra (Eva Amurri, The Life Before Her Eyes). Directed by Brian Dannelly (Struck by Lightning) from a screenplay by Dannelly and Michael Urban, Saved! features Patrick Fugit (Almost Famous), Heather Matarazzo (Welcome to the Dollhouse), Martin Donovan (Agent Cody Banks) and Mary-Louise Parker (Fried Green Tomatoes) in supporting roles.\n\nSpecial Features[]\n\nCommentary by Brian Dannelly (Co-Writer and Director), Sandy Stern (Producer), Michael Urban (Co-Writer) On/Off\n\nCommentary by Mandy Moore and Jena Malone On/Off\n\n\"Heaven Help Us\" Featurette\n\nDeleted/Extended Scenes\n\nBloopers\n\n\"Saved!
