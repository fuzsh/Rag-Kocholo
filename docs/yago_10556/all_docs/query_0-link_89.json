        "text": "Playwrights Horizons has cancelled the World Premiere of the new musical Saved, which was scheduled for the 9 May 2008, due to technical problems. The musical will still open on 3 Jun 2008 and play through to 22 Jun 2008, as originally scheduled.\n\nIn Saved, good girl Mary (Celia Keenan-Bolger) and her domineering best friend Hilary Faye (Mary Faber) are starting their senior year at the top of the social food chain at American Eagle Christian High School ï¿½ that is, until Maryï¿½s boyfriend (Aaron Tveit) tells her he thinks heï¿½s gay. When Jesus (Daniel Zaitchik) appears in a vision, and Mary heeds his message ï¿½to do everything she can to help him,ï¿½ her good deeds are met with dire consequences, and Mary is forced to question everything sheï¿½s ever believed. Through it all, she finds faith in unexpected places and learns what it truly means to be saved.\n\nDirected by Gary Griffin and choreographed by Sergio Trujillo, Saved features Celia Keenan-Bolger (Mary), John Dossett (Pastor Skip), Julia Murney (Lillian), Mary Faber (Hilary Faye), Josh Breckenridge (Shane), Juliana Ashley Hansen (Lana), Curtis Holbrook (Roland), Van Hughes (Patrick), Jason Michael Snow (Zac), Aaron Tveit (Dean), Emily Walton (Tia) and Daniel Zaitchik\n\n(Jesus/Mitch/Nurse). Saved has music & lyrics by Obie Award winner Michael Friedman (The Civiliansï¿½ Gone Missing) and book & lyrics by 2-time Olivier Award nominee John Dempsey (The Witches of Eastwick) & Obie Award winner Rinne Groff (The Ruby Sunrise), based on the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer motion picture written by Brian Dannelly & Michael Urban.\n\nThe Saved design team features three Tony Award winners: scenic designer Scott Pask (The Coast of Utopia, The Pillowman), costume designer Jess Goldstein (The Rivals) and lighting designer Donald Holder (The Lion King), with sound design by Brian Ronan."
