        "meta_description": "This teen satire set in a Christian high school is an admirable attempt to acknowledge the powerful influence of religion in contemporary American youth culture. The director Brian Dannelly resists easy, smug caricature, but the picture ultimately fails both as comedy and as sentimental melodrama, veering from not-very-funny jokes to canned speeches about tolerance and human fallibility. This is a shame, since the bright young cast (especially Mandy Moore, relishing the chance to play a villainous, self-righteous teenage queen be) performs with conviction and high spirits. Jena Malone plays Mary, who becomes pregnant while trying to cure her gay boyfriend and whose crisis separates the pious hypocrites from the decent folk. In the end, &quot;Saved!&quot; is an exercise in liberal humanist piety, a peace offering in the culture wars that is sadly unable to realize its good intentions, or to make you laugh. â€” A. O. Scott",

        "text": "''Saved!,'' a teen comedy set in a Christian high school, is an admirable attempt to acknowledge some aspects of contemporary American social reality that many movies shy away from. It pokes satirical fun at the religious sentiment currently sweeping though the popular culture while at the same time partaking of some of the energy and idealism that the Christian youth movement has brought to the entertainment industry, especially pop music.\n\nThrowing foam-rubber darts at easy targets, the film, directed by Brian Dannelly, also wants to be a peace offering in the culture wars, suggesting that the polarization of our society is a smoke screen for our own internal confusion about values, morals and desire.\n\nAll of which makes me wish I could say that ''Saved!,'' which opens today in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Washington, is actually a good movie. It has a bright young cast and a clever, eclectic soundtrack, but the tone veers unsteadily from mockery to preachiness, and the story loses its breath, hopping from one clumsily paced scene to the next.\n\nThe heroine, Mary (Jena Malone), lives with her widowed mother (Mary-Louise Parker), who may be carrying on an affair with Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan), the youthful and dynamic principal of the Eagle Christian Academy, where Mary is about to start her senior year. Skip, a descendant of the guitar-strumming ministers of an earlier era, peppers his speech with obsolete hip-hop jargon (''Let's kick it for Christ''), and Mr. Donovan has the wit to play him not as a buffoon, but as, all things considered, a pretty cool guy.\n\nMr. Dannelly (who wrote the script with Michael Urban) is careful not to turn his characters into caricatures. In nearly every respect, from their social interactions to their clothes and cars, the students at Eagle Christian Academy are indistinguishable from those at any other big-screen or small-screen suburban high school.\n\nHilary Faye (Mandy Moore) is a kind of mean girl for Jesus, sitting atop the school pecking order as the leader of a clique called the Christian Jewels. Ms. Moore, who played a saintly preacher's daughter in ''A Walk to Remember'' and a sassy rebel in ''How to Deal,'' turns to adolescent villainy with obvious relish, savoring every nuance of Hilary Faye's self-righteousness and vanity. (She also sings a couple of full-throated devotional anthems.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
