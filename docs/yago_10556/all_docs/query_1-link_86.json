        "text": "Thanks to hilariously weird directorial efforts, including What We Do in the Shadows (2019) and Thor: Ragnarok (2017) Taika Waititi has emerged as one of the most exciting and unique comedic figures in years. If those films didnât convince you of his brilliance, the show Our Flag Means Death (2022), in which he portrays a queer reimagining of infamous English pirate Blackbeard, is proof enough. So, upon reading that he voiced a talking rabbit in an animated film that was shortlistedopens in a new tab for an Oscar for Best Animated Short this year, it would be fair to assume that itâs a quirky romp full of lighthearted banter.\n\nBut Save Ralphopens in a new tab (2022), which has 14 million YouTube views, is a serious and impactful endeavor. Written and directed by Spencer Susser, the short film depicts the harsh reality of how animals are treated while being used for beauty product testing. Save Ralph was produced for and released by the Humane Society International (HSIopens in a new tab) as part of its global campaign to ban animal testing for cosmetics.\n\nArt (Unfortunately) Imitating Life\n\nThe four-minute piece is admittedly hard to watch, but thatâs why itâs so important â and powerful. It opens documentary-style with Waititiâs Ralph introducing himself to the camera and discussing his role as a âtester,â noting that heâs half deaf, half blind, and covered in chemical burns. Throughout Save Ralph, the titular rabbit is visibly strained but emotionally subdued, ultimately accepting his fate in the process.\n\nAfter Ralph announces that itâs all worth it for the âsuperiorâ humans, he details his extensive family lineage of being test subjects. The film then follows Ralphâs gruesome day at the lab, which involves a brutal eye injection. According to the HSI, this procedure is whatâs known as the Draize testopens in a new tab, an experiment used to evaluate chemical irritation to the eyes and skin. It was developed over 70 years ago and involves zero pain relief for the animal subjects. While modern non-animal approaches are available, companies continue to employ this approach.\n\nSave Ralph highlights the inhumane truth that, of course, these creatures have no choice in this matter. Thanks to its gut-wrenching exposure of the subject matter, emotional stop-motion animation, and stellar additional voice cast, including Zac Efron, George Lopez, and Olivia Wilde, sheds light on a long-gestating problem.\n\nThe Realities of Animal Testing\n\nThe HSI reports that over 500,000opens in a new tab animals continue to suffer and die every year globally from animal testing. As of 2022, 10 states in the U.S. have passed laws to ban animal testingopens in a new tab and 42 countries have also banned or limited this practice. In addition, Lush, Unilever, P&G, Avon, and LâOrÃ©al have have all pushed back opens in a new tab on animal testing requirements. But sweeping legislation, namely the Humane Cosmetics Act opens in a new tabin the U.S., has yet to be passed.\n\nIn fact, animal testing is legally required for products, such as fragrances and clothing dyes, before going to market. Across the globe, government regulations demandopens in a new tab âanimal-poisoning testsâ be performed on laboratory animals before chemicals, pesticides, or medicinal products can be distributed to the public. The HSI notes that as many as 10,000 animals are killed for every new chemical tested.Â Here are just a few of the companiesopens in a new tab outsourcing their animal testing in countries where it remains legal."
