        "text": "Q: How did you get the role of Mrs. Alves in HALLOWEEN II?\n\nGG: The director, Rick Rosenthal, was in my acting class and recommended me for the audition. Although, I was more than 25 years too young, he felt that I was authoritative enough to pull it off. I auditioned and they felt I was too young, but eventually they came around (they being Debra Hill and Nancy Jacoby). Mrs. Alves was written as a 55-year old white woman. Needless to say – it’s not typecasting for me.\n\nQ: I just have to say that you look absolutely fantastic after all these years after “Halloween 2”. I’m sure it was a dream working with Jaime Lee Curtis, she’s a doll, I adore her. I was wondering what your immediate impression was when you were cast in HALLOWEEN II seeing that the original was such a sensation and so much buzz. (From Michael in Nova Scotia)\n\nGG: Thank you for the compliment. My immediate reaction was thrilled. I was excited to work with Rick, and some of the other actors in the cast were in my acting class – so I knew them. And, yes, the buzz was a part of the excitement. Jamie Lee is a passionate, considerate, generous actress and I’ve worked with her twice and she’s the best.\n\nQ: Your character was tough as nails, and as a kid I was more scared of you than Michael Myers! However Mrs. Alves death scene always confused me, to this day, because it seems rather “injected” into the film without much explanation? Was that the way it was intended or is the actual death scene cut? Thanks for your years of entertainment! (From Ryan Hunter)\n\nGG: That’s funny – I teach acting now and the students say the same thing – hmm!!! I taught at the American Film Institute for 6 years – teaching writers and directors in the Masters’ Program – and they thought I was very strict. Twelve years Catholic School educated – I learned it from the nuns! (Patty Jenkins who directed “Monster” and Brian Dannelly who directed “Saved” were two of my students there.) The “death” scene was always written that way. I’m happy about that. “Dying” on screen is very difficult and emotional. When I found out it was going to be “off screen” I was glad. As it turned out, it was just as grueling to be on the gurney for hours, surrounded by “blood” and unable to leave the scene when everyone broke for lunch. Couldn’t disturb “the blood”. I remember the room, and the lights were low and it was actually a good rest period – although I couldn’t go to the restroom either.\n\nQ: What exactly happened between you and Myers? As an actor, did you imagine the bustle between you two? If so, what did you use as motivation for the scene?\n\nGG: Good question. I imagined that I heard the sounds of something and expected it to be one of the nurses and one of the ambulance drivers at it again – and went to investigate. I imagined that he grabbed me and we fought and he strangled me. I was still semi-conscious but weak. Then he put me on the gurney and hooked me up to a machine and drained my blood from me and I slowly faded away.\n\nQ: How was it working with Jamie Lee Curtis? (From John)\n\nGG: Jamie Lee has a great sense of humor. She always made it a party just before the actual shot and then she quickly got into character and was 100% present to do the work. When “cut” was called – she was back to making jokes and putting the other actors at ease. She never tried to be “the star” – although she very much is one. She was young with great energy and smart as a whip. Great actress to work with. We worked together again on “The Dorothy Stratten Story”. Then I worked with her husband on “This Is Spinal Tap”.\n\nQ: What do you recall about working with Donald Pleasence during the shooting of Halloween II? What was he like? (From Corey)\n\nGG: I met Donald but we had no scenes together, so I can’t answer that one.\n\nQ: What was the rest of the cast like? Pamela, Leo, Lance, Ana, Tawny, Dick? Did you get along with everyone?\n\nGG: Starting with Leo Rossi, I’ve worked with him a few times and we knew each other from acting class. He’s a trip. He’s a smart, funny, mischievous actor and I loved working with him. Lance Guest, was young and vulnerable and dedicated and easy to work with too. Pamela had good experience already when she took this role so she was the consummate pro. Ana – another classmate of mine – was also interesting. We had done scenes in acting class and had a natural ambitious, friendly competitiveness going. Easy to work with. She’s dedicated.\n\nI met Tawny on this movie. She’s just like her character, adorable and likable and fun. I didn’t have real contact with Dick. I loved working with Ford Rainey, the doctor. What an amazing actor! He was funny and charming and excellent to work with. But do you notice that Dana Carvey is in the movie? He had a line or two as a member of a news crew and I remember talking to him at length. He doesn’t really mention this movie in his bio, but I have pictures.\n\nQ: Was it creepy watching your death scene after the movie was released? (From Ryan S)\n\nGG: Yes, it was creepy. But worse for the girls who had to die on screen.\n\nQ: I was just wondering what It feels like knowing that you’ve become a Halloween Icon? Do people ever walk up to you on the street and go “Hey! Your from that one movie!”? (From Zach)\n\nGG: It surprises me that after all these years there is such interest in the film. But the director, Rick, took pains to make sure that we didn’t treat the film like a joke Instead we all had to do research at a hospital and took our “jobs” seriously. We learned how to work with the patients and how to handle instruments and observed. Rick was amazing.\n\nQ: Before you got the role of Mrs. Alves, were you a fan of the first film? (from Sonny)\n\nGG: Whoops, I hadn’t seen the first film at that time.\n\nQ: How many days were you required to be on set during the filming of H2? (from Mark)\n\nGG: I don’t remember exactly, but it could have been three or four weeks.\n\nQ: My question is, what got you into acting? And also, was it your idea to play your character as strict as possible or was it the writer’s? Thanks! (From James)\n\nGG: First – it was always written that “Mrs. Alves” was strict. Casting a much younger actress, in 1981, a black actress as the boss was innovative and keeps the film timely, if you ask me. What we take for granted now, multicultural casting, had begun to fade out in the 80’s and it seems perfectly natural now to see a young, non-stereotypical, actress in the role. Rick was ahead of his time. It made the character not a cartoon. Strict and strong. That’s usually my casting. I studied acting in college but I was a Political Science major. I got the lead in the play my first quarter in college – Lorca’s “Blood Wedding” – Spanish not horror. But, I continued to pursue my thoughts of becoming a lawyer. I married young – my college sweetheart – and had a son and then became a social worker in NYC after graduation.\n\nI was in grad school for Criminology, being a mom and wife, and then I went to Bloomingdale’s and became the first black executive in NYC for the big store. I stayed there for a few years, moving up the corporate ladder, when another executive said prophetic words to me: “You don’t like playing this game here, Gloria, why don’t you find a game you want to play.” I quit my executive job, starting taking acting classes at night and the first night of classes at HB Studios in NYC, I did an improvisation. I knew that night that I would act for the rest of my life. Four years later, I was on Broadway.\n\nQ: Do you own a copy of Halloween 2? If so, how often do you watch it?\n\nGG: Yes, I do own a copy. I haven’t watched it through in quite a few years.\n\nQ: How do you feel now, 25 years later, realizing that you are a part of the most successful horror film franchise ever? (From Cameron)\n\nGG: Great. What a great franchise to be a part of. I did “This Is Spinal Tap” and “D.C. Cab” and I find that the Halloween fans are more exciting and enthusiastic than others. I like it alot.\n\nQ: What do you remember about the deleted scenes from the film?\n\nGG: The deleted scenes??? I’d have to check it out to find out what they were.\n\nQ: Would you like to return and have the opportunity of being in another Halloween film? (From Nolan)\n\nGG: Yes, Yes, Yes. I’d like “Mrs. Alves” or her “sister” to appear in the film that Mr. Zombie’s doing right now.\n\nQ: What are you up to now?\n\nGG: I’m acting in independent films (did a film with Margaret Cho last year), acting on television (did “E.R.”, “The Practice”, “Son of the Beach”, three years of “Tracey Takes On”, etc.). I am also a pretty well known acting teacher in Hollywood (Gloria Gifford Conservatory. Efren Ramirez (Pedro in “Napoleon Dynamite” is one of my students. Jenna Elfman was too. As well as Larry Thomas – the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. I am also hosting a short film festival – we’re going into our second year – The Rebel Planet Short Film Festival of Hollywood (Rebel Planet… we’re presently accepting submissions through withoutabox.com. And I’m in rehearsal for a play that I’m directing that I’m very excited about. It is: OUR LADY OF 121ST ST by Stephen Adly Guirgis. Guirgis’ plays have only been directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman when done in NYC. It took me a year to get the rights and I have an incredible cast – we’re double cast – so I’m lucky lucky to have strong, brilliant actors. We open November 17 at the Matrix Theatre in Hollywood.
