        "text": "Saying the quiet part out loud. Somehow, this has always felt like the bleeding heart of The Matrix movies. Under the simulation theory, cool bullet-dodging, and even cooler soundtracks, the movies are about pointing out the facades and fakery that surround us. Evil forces are trying to placate everyone and it’ll only stop if you talk about it. That is perhaps why so many people expressed relief when Lilly Wachowski, who wrote and directed the original Matrix trilogy with her sister Lana, seemingly confirmed that the series was, in some ways, a transgender narrative.\n\nFans had been speculating about it for years, particularly after the Wachowskis came out as trans, but then one of them finally said it.\n\nTypically, saying the quiet part out loud means accidentally revealing a secret motive. In the case of The Matrix, the (not) hidden agenda is just about the importance of individualism. The red-pill-or-blue-pill of it all is whether you choose to accept reality. This is why, as my colleague Jason Kehe pointed out a few years ago, Matrix Resurrections put a mirror up to the self-hatred and nostalgia baked into its own audience. To love The Matrix is to love something perfectly comfortable with screaming its own intentions—and imperfections.\n\nWhich is why, on this weird April day, I find myself asking: Why is Drew Goddard making the next Matrix movie? No offense to Goddard, but the man is nothing if not earnest. Painfully so. He made The Martian better, though far less wry, than the book. Alias, Cloverfield, Lost, Cabin in the Woods. He’s got the mystery box thing down. His projects, though, are rarely what one would call edgy. They’re crowd-pleasers. Matrix movies never felt crafted to please anyone. That’s what made them so much fun.\n\nAccording to Jesse Ehrman, president of Warner Bros. Motion Pictures, Goddard got the gig because he came to the studio with “a new idea that we all believe would be an incredible way to continue the Matrix world.” I’m also compelled to note that Lana is executive producing, so it’s not that there is no Wachowski involvement here, but it’s unclear what anyone’s motive is for continuing a franchise that could’ve been left alone.\n\nThe Monitor is a weekly column devoted to everything happening in the WIRED world of culture, from movies to memes, TV to Twitter.\n\nNormally the answer to this question would be “money,” but the last Matrix—2021’s Resurrections—didn’t, relatively speaking, make a ton of it. Perhaps that’s what Goddard’s emplacement is an attempt to fix. Ever since the Warner Bros.–Discovery merger, the company has been focusing on surefire winners and sending movies like Batgirl to the dustbin. Maybe handing Goddard the keys to the Nebuchadnezzar provides an opportunity to make a Matrix with a little more mass appeal. Saying the quiet part out loud, maybe it’s a chance to make a less weird, bankable hit.\n\nSigh.\n\nAdmittedly, I’m wont to bristle at the idea of a Matrix reboot, even when the result turns out surprisingly well. There’s a chance The Matrix 5 (or The Matrix Rebrand, etc.) will be fantastic, even if it doesn’t come directly from the minds of the Wachowskis. But after watching The People’s Joker this week, it’s been hard not to ponder what happens when someone completely reimagines worlds everyone thought they knew. Director-star Vera Drew’s parody is unlike any Batman movie before it. The Joker serves as hero and Bruce Wayne is a media mogul. There’s no quiet part; it’s just loud. A template for the Matrices to come.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Scales New Heights of Cinematic Self-Awareness\n\nDeadpool’s first foray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe is all about giving fans more Easter eggs and references than they can catch. Will it also score Disney a hit?\n\nThe 52 Best Shows on Disney+ Right Now\n\nArctic Ascent With Alex Honnold, X-Men ’97, and Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures are just a few of the shows you should be watching on Disney+ this month.\n\nThis Is the Year Comic-Con Bounces Back\n\nAfter being upended by Covid-19 cancellations and Hollywood strikes, Comic-Con International in San Diego has a chance to come back in a big way this year.\n\nThe 51 Best Movies on Netflix Right Now\n\nWicked Little Letters, Lumberjack the Monster, and Godzilla Minus One are just a few of the movies you should watch on Netflix this month.\n\nThe 62 Best Movies on Disney+ Right Now\n\nThe Beach Boys, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor’s Version), and Fantastic Mr. Fox are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Disney+ this month.\n\nThe Untold Story of How Ridley Scott Saw Star Wars—and Ended Up Making Alien\n\nIn 1977, Ridley Scott was considering making a medieval period piece. Then he saw Star Wars and set about making two sci-fi classics, Alien and Blade Runner.\n\nThe 30 Best Movies on Max (aka HBO Max) Right Now\n\nLove Lies Bleeding, Dune: Part Two, and Beetlejuice are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Max this month.\n\nThe Week of Brat Summer Will Go Down in Internet History\n\nAfter Charli XCX declared that Vice President Kamala Harris “IS brat,” nothing was the same."
