        "text": "The film, penned by Colfer, is directed by Brian Dannelly and centers on Colfer's character, a teenager who has been struck and killed by a bolt of lightning. A series of flashbacks then chronicle his exploits as he blackmails his classmates into contributing to a literary magazine he's publishing.\n\nJanney will play Colfer's mother in the film. Other actors added to the cast include Christina Hendricks (\"Mad Men\"), Sarah Hyland (Grey Gardens), Dermot Mulroney, Angela Kinsey, Allie Grant, Ashley Rickards, Brad Henke, Robbie Amell and Carter Jenkins.\n\n\"Struck by Lightning\" began shooting July 11 in Los Angeles and will continue through the summer before Colfer begins production on the third season of \"Glee.\"\n\nDavid Permut produces alongside Rob Aguire and Evil Media Empire's Mia Chang. Colfer and his manager Glenn Rigberg are executive producers with Jason Michael Berman.\n\nColfer, who won the Golden Globe for his performance as Kurt Hummel in \"Glee,\" has also penned a pilot that the Disney Channel will shoot, entitled \"The Little Leftover Witch\"; he will publish two books with Little, Brown Books for Young Readers that will be released in summer 2012."
