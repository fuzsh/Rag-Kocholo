        "text": "Produced by REM’s Michael Stipe, this satiric indie teen comedy takes aim at American fundamentalism and religious intolerance. Mary (DONNIE DARKO’s Malone) is a member of Hilary Faye’s top gal gang at their Christian high school. She has it all until she gives away her virginity to save the soul of her gay boyfriend. Cue ostracism to the fringes of high school society A witty script and excellent cast of actual teen dreams and indie idols combine to make SAVED! a funny and irreverent treat. Sat 30 Oct, 10.25pm – SAVED! Pyjama party. Come along in your Pyjamas (slippers optional!) and receive £1 off the ticket price of the film and be eligible for a SAVED! goodie bag."
