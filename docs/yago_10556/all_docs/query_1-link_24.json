        "text": "The modern renaissance in horror filmmaking continues through 2023, with fans enjoying plenty of terrific new entries in the genre. Huesera: The Bone Woman, Pearl, M3GAN, Scream VI, and a host of other excellent movies and streaming series have graced screens big and small so far this year, and newcomer No One Will Save You is among the top tier as the best horror film of 2023 so far.\n\nA 20th Century Studios production, No One Will Save You was released directly to Hulu. Which is surprising, because it’s so good — and the trailer is so compelling — that even a modest marketing campaign alongside its low budget should’ve been enough to give it a profitable theatrical run, even a limited one.\n\nWith soft box office attendance the past few weeks and not much competition around Halloween, I suspect audiences would’ve been happy to have something this good and unique to draw them back to theaters.\n\nForbesCan 'Oppenheimer' Top $1 Billion Box Office? The Clock Is Ticking.\n\nThere’s so much to praise in No One Will Save You. The film is expertly paced and gets endless mileage from its premise. It’s one part Signs, one part Body Snatchers, and a whole lot of Cronenberg, all of which I love independently and am thrilled to see combined here.\n\nIt’s full of nice Spielberg homages like storm clouds rolling in, the famous Close Encounters lit-up-door-silhouette (with a window this time), and certain aspects of UFOs that I won’t spoil.\n\nThe lack of dialogue is something you might not even notice at first, that’s how good the visual storytelling and performances are. I’ll get more into this shortly, so for now just know that the largely dialogue-free approach might sound gimmicky or distracting, but it’s neither and highlights how well written, directed, and performed the whole thing is.\n\nForbes10 Essential Superhero Movies That Are Great Cinema\n\nI also appreciate that it introduces the alien element early and doesn’t keep it shadowed for long. Once we see aliens, everything is out in the open and weird as hell. And I appreciate that some of the weirdness is left unexplained.\n\nIt’s not without its faults, however.\n\nI’m a bit tired of the jerky-motions and arched-backs trope in zombie & alien movies. They look like they’re doing a bad break-dance. And alien voices and creature noises also need a new popular style, the “auto-tuned screech” is ho-hum by now.\n\nThe film has a few moments and concepts that don’t get used to their fullest potential, and I’m left wondering if some ideas didn’t get developed because there wasn’t enough time or budget. It’s not distracting, but it’s also not hard to imagine how a couple of things could’ve played out more significantly and helped link some key moments together.\n\nForbesWatch These 10 Essential Movies About AI\n\nBut any complaints are minor in comparison to how well the film works to engage you and keep you on edge for the ride, in large part due to the brilliant lead performance by Kaitlyn Dever.\n\nDever carries the vast majority of the film as the only person in the shots, and with no dialogue, and she does a masterful job at it. Her panic, confusion, terror, and rage at various moments all fell entirely legitimate, as does her sorrow and loneliness. It’s a performance that juggles so many complex emotions ranging from deep grounded loss to pure reaction fight-or-flight. Lead performances are crucial to horror films, and Dever’s is among the finest in recent memory — again, all without really speaking more than a couple of words in the entire film.\n\nBrian Duffield also deserves praise for his writing and directing, which keep up with Dever’s performance to craft a thoughtful, exciting, scary picture that deserves a large global audience who appreciate this type of storytelling effort and this level of respect for the audience’s intelligence.\n\nForbesWhite Western Movies Dominate 2023 Awards Season. It Has To Stop.\n\nNo One Will Save You also has a wild ending that you’ll be thinking and talking about long after you see it. I’ll just say whatever you wind up thinking and believing, it’s worth remembering that the opposite — and many alternate versions of any given perspective — are also possibly true, if you think hard about what you just experienced. And in a sign of how well it works, the ambiguity makes the whole thing all the more satisfying."
