        "text": "A group effort involving many Grand Islanders went into making the David Kaufmann documentary.\n\nWatching the film, local residents will notice that Stuhr Museum’s Railroad Town plays the role of early-day Grand Island.\n\nIt’s also fun to spot many Grand Islanders playing roles in “A Life Well Lived: An Account of David Kaufmann.”\n\nThe man who arrived in Grand Island in 1904, surveying the city portrayed by Railroad Town, is played by Mike Bockoven. The middle-aged Kaufmann is played by Bart Qualsett.\n\nOther characters in the documentary are portrayed by Jim Truell, Laura Fentress, Rod and Sue Clement, Christine Kier, Ty Havranek, Steve Fosselman and many others.\n\nThe Liederkranz is used as a location early in the film, when Bockoven, as Kaufmann, meets with Don Deitemeyer, who plays well-known Grand Island businessman S.N. Wolbach.\n\nEight organizations or individuals provided funding of $2,500 or more for “A Life Well Lived.” Among them were the Bud & Gloria Wolbach Foundation, Five Points Bank, the Kaufmann-Cummings Foundation and the Hall County Historical Society.\n\n“A Life Well Lived” had its premiere Sunday at the Grand Theatre.\n\nAmong those on hand were Michael Moehring of Omaha, the film’s producer and director, and cinematographer Bryan Boorujy.\n\nMayor Roger Steele proclaimed Sunday as David Kaufmann Day in Grand Island.\n\nBefore a 2 p.m. showing of the film, Moehering and Boorujy were joined onstage by Michelle Setlik of the Hall County Historical Society.\n\nBoorujy, who lives in Titusville, Florida, said he’s worked on documentaries all over the world. But he’s never seen as much community support as he has with “A Life Well Lived.”\n\nKaufmann, a native of Germany, was convinced to move to Grand Island by Wolbach, who met him in New York. When he arrived in Grand Island, Kaufmann felt he’d been sold a bill of goods, Moehring said in an interview. The dusty streets of Grand Island didn’t measure up to the rosy portrait painted by Wolbach.\n\nBut Kaufmann grew to love the city, opening a five- and 10-cent store in 1906. As the film shows, he helped Grand Island’s less fortunate, leaving food and clothing on the store’s loading dock for anyone to claim.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nOn a larger scale, Kaufmann helped many of his fellow Jewish people move to the U.S., saving their lives.\n\nMoehring and Boorujy are involved with Chimney Rock Media. That company was engaged to do the documentary by the Hall County Historical Society and the Institute for Holocaust Education, an agency of the Jewish Federation of Omaha.\n\nMoehring devoted four years to the project, traveling to Denver, Florida and Arizona.\n\nAttending the premiere were some descendants of the recipients of Kaufmann’s benevolence.\n\nDorothy Resnick and Marcel Kahn, both interviewed in the film, brought their families to Grand Island for the premiere.\n\nIn the documentary, Setlik points out the tremendous paperwork that was required for Kaufmann to carry out his mission of mercy. Not only that, but there was a huge bottleneck of people from Germany and Austria attempting to flee to the U.S.\n\nKaufmann came to the U.S. to build a better life for himself. “But he ended up building a better world,” says Scott Littky, executive director of the Institute for Holocaust Education.\n\nMoehring said Kaufmann’s story inspires people to take an extra step. We all need to do what we need to do, he said. But if we do a little bit more, we might impact the lives of thousands of people.\n\nThe documentary points out that the descendants of Kaufmann’s protectors continue to have an impact on the world today.\n\nInterestingly, the film was shown in a theater that once belonged to Kaufmann.\n\nIn 1930, when it was still known as the Lydia, it was purchased by Kaufmann and Harry Schiller.\n\nMoehring and Boorujy interviewed a number of Grand Islanders who remember Kaufmann.\n\nAmong them are Annette Davis, Craig Hand, Fred and Kaila Roeser and the late Gus Katrouzos. Another interviewee is David Mangelsen. Those interviews were shown Sunday at the end of the 45-minute documentary.\n\nKaufmann died in 1969 at the age of 93, leaving no children.\n\nThe producers of the film hope to have it shown on PBS.\n\nThe documentary ends with a 1934 quote from Kaufmann: “Most of us have more good thoughts than we have bad ones, and all we have to do is to follow the good thoughts. The handicap is that often the good thoughts are not followed by required action.”\n\nStay up-to-date on what's happening\n\nReceive the latest in local entertainment news in your inbox weekly!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nJeff Bahr\n\nReporter\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
