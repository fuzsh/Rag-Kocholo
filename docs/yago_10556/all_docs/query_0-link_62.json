And today we are welcoming a guest very close to my heart - Writer, director, producer (and so much more), Brian Dannelly! I first became familiar with Brian when he directed and co-wrote my Favorite Movie, SAVED, but his great work didn’t stop there, and I’ll just name a few. From directing the Chris Colfer film, Struck By Lighting, and working on iconic television hits like Weeds and Pushing Daisies, to now being a director on the upcoming Paramount+ series, School Spirits, we had a lot to talk about! Are we getting a Saved 2? What was the original plan for Hilary Faye? Does the upcoming murder mystery have a lot mores going on than the trailer hints at?
