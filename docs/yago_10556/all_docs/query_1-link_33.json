        "text": "How The Hampsters Saved Winter was a straight-to-DVD lost animated movie about Hampton and the Hampsters going on a \"snowy adventure where they help make a family's dream come true.\" It is unknown who directed or starred in the movie, but it was produced by Abatis International LLC and animated by a company in New Jersey.\n\nThe movie was listed for sale (as well as released) on April 2nd, 2009, on the Hampster Dance website, with a link to order it through the site Kunaki. The DVD was available to purchase as late as 2012.[1] However, now when someone clicks on the link, they would be directed to a page that says \"product not available.\"[2]\n\nThe movie's existence was confirmed in an article from 2018 where Bill Porfido, owner of the Hampster Dance property, confirmed \"roughly 2,000 copies\" of the movie were sold.[3] No clips, trailers, or audio exists of the movie. Only the DVD cover and the original price of $7.99 is all that exist online. However, screenshots do exist via a game on the website called Hamster Hijinks.[4]\n\nOn January 23rd, 2020, the Hamster Dance's official website domain was shut down and is currently seeking renewal. However, considering the website hasn't been updated since 2011, renewal seems unlikely.\n\nAvailablity\n\nOn January 13th, 2022, on the Lost Media Wiki discord, user Jen (she/her) announced that she had a copy of the film, sharing an image of a signed copy on a blank DVD. Jen explained that her father was friends with the director and that he gave her the DVD when she was a kid. Jen would later upload the entire film and the subsequent music videos on the DVD onto Archive.org.\n\nGallery\n\nImage\n\nScreenshot of the film 1/4.\n\nScreenshot of the film 2/4.\n\nScreenshot of the film 3/4.\n\nScreenshot of the film 4/4.\n\nHamster Dance The Album (cover).\n\nHamster Dance The Album (back).\n\nJen's signed DVD of the film.\n\nGallery\n\nVideos"
