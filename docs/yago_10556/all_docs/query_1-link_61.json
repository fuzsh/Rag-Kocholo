        "text": "Matt Damon and Casey Affleck have made their way to Apple TV+ in the latest thriller comedy, The Instigators, directed by Doug Liman. Liman has a roster filled with critically acclaimed and loved-by-fans movies, including The Bourne Identity, Edge of Tomorrow, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and more recently, Jake Gyllenhaal starrer Road House.\n\nNow, it is time to venture into Liman’s latest project for Apple TV+, which brings us back to The Instigators. This movie has a heist, some typical buddy drama, and plenty of bickering.\n\nIf you are still unsure whether or not you want to stream this movie, keep reading our review!\n\nDeadpan Comedy Paired with Predictable Action\n\nThe Instigators starts with a rather depressing tone but it does help us understand the main character, Rory, a little better, or at least the desperation in his life. Rory, played by Matt Damon is poised to be the star of the movie, but for an opening scene, we weren’t engaged enough to look forward to what’s to come next.\n\nBut, we can thank the movie’s official trailer which urged us to stick around.\n\nShortly after, Casey Affleck’s character, Cobby, is also introduced in the movie and is presented as the classic ex-con who won’t take shit from anyone but won’t do much to change his life either.\n\nRory and Cobby are two very different from each other, but the underlying similarities between the two help bridge the gap and create some room for comedy in The Instigators.\n\nAdmittedly, it takes a while for the ball to get rolling in this movie, even though the plan of robbing the Mayor is laid out pretty early in the movie, but something about it just seems forced and slow.\n\nAlbeit, for a moment, let’s keep the premise, Damon and Affleck aside, only to appreciate Jack Harlow’s involvement in the movie, which is shockingly refreshing, even though it doesn’t last very long.\n\nThe real action in the movie starts somewhere at the 40-minute mark, and that’s when The Instigators picks up its pace. One of the best scenes of the movie involves a car chase, which should come as no shocker, but it is during that car share that the personalities of Cobby and Rory really shine through, and having a therapist involved helped elevate the overall quality.\n\nThe premise and action of the movie felt fairly dull compared to what we had expected, especially with Damon’s involvement in the movie, and Liman’s direction.\n\nBut, the occasional comedy from Affleck and the bickering bond between the protagonists served as the saving grace. If you watch The Instigators today, watch for Damon and Affleck, and nothing else!\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are a fan of Matt Damon or Casey Affleck, we highly recommend streaming The Instigators, however, if you’re here for the plot, there might not be much in store for you. Do let us know in the comments what you think about this movie!"
