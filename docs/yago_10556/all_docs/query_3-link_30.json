        "text": "2004\n\nCity Locations\n\nVancouver, British Columbia (Canada)\n\nLocation Types\n\nSchool\n\nLocation Styles\n\nModern Building, Colonial, Retreat, School\n\nAbout Saved!\n\nJourney back to 2004 and submerge yourself in the world of \"Saved!\", an independent, satirical black comedy film. With Brian Dannelly at the helm as director, the film showcases a remarkable ensemble of actors, including Macaulay Culkin, Jena Malone, Mandy Moore, Eva Amurri, Patrick Fugit, and others. The movie's narrative revolves around Mary Cummings (Jena Malone), a student at a Christian high school. She finds herself pregnant and soon outcast by her peers after trying to \"cure\" her gay boyfriend through sexual intercourse. \"Saved!\" cleverly navigates themes of faith, tolerance, and the quintessential struggles of teenage life. Although the film seesaws between critical acclaim and criticism, it boasts a 61% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Esteemed critic Roger Ebert lauds the movie's bold political statement and refreshing challenge of mainstream Christian values, awarding it 3.5 out of 4 stars. Despite its independent status and limited release, \"Saved!\" turned heads at the box office, grossing over $9 million domestically and an additional $1.2 million internationally. Although the film did not secure significant awards or nominations, it has paved its way into cult classic status and earned appreciation for its satirical take on religious norms and teen movie conventions. In 2008, the movie's impact reached beyond the silver screen and gave birth to a musical adaptation. The theatrical version was brought to life by Playwrights Horizons, with musical scores and lyrics crafted by Michael Friedman and the script penned by John Dempsey and Rinne Groff. Despite its short run, the musical echoed the persistent relevance of the themes explored in \"Saved!\".\n\nSaved! Locations\n\nThe 2004 \"Saved!\" utilized the stunning backdrops of British Columbia, Canada, for its production. Most scenes were shot in Surrey and Vancouver, offering a blend of urban and natural settings that added depth to the narrative. Clayton Heights Secondary, located in Surrey, was used extensively for the school scenes, providing an authentic high school environment. Although the narrative unfolds in Maryland, the filmmakers chose British Columbia for its unique landscapes and diverse architecture. Surrey, with modern skyscrapers and lush parks, is ideal for filming city scenes. Meanwhile, Vancouver, known for its bustling port and scenic mountains, offered various backdrops for filming. In terms of landmarks, Surrey is home to the historic Surrey Museum and the beautiful Redwood Park, while Vancouver boasts iconic sights such as Stanley Park and Granville Island. These locations not only enriched the visual aesthetics of the movie but also provided worthwhile destinations for film fans or travelers in general. Visiting the filming locations of \"Saved!\" would be a worthwhile trip. Not only do these locations offer a chance to step into the scenes from the movie, but they also provide an opportunity to explore the beauty and culture of British Columbia. Whether walking the hallways of Clayton Heights Secondary or exploring the vibrant streets of Surrey and Vancouver, a trip to these locations offers a unique blend of cinematic history and Canadian charm.\n\nMary Cummings (Jena Malone), a devout evangelical Christian, is embarking on her senior year at American Eagle Christian High School near Baltimore. She's part of a girl group named the Christian Jewels, alongside her friends Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore) and Veronica (Elizabeth Thai). Clayton Heights Secondary, a public high school located in Surrey, British Columbia, provided the backdrop for the high school scenes. The learning institution opened its doors in 1999 and pioneered a contemporary Industrial/Concrete design. This architectural style later became a trend among other schools, such as Sullivan Heights, Fraser Heights, Kwantlen Park, and Panorama Ridge. During the filming of \"Saved!\", the school was operational, and many students were used as extras, adding an extra layer of authenticity to these scenes. In the main hallway of Clayton Heights Secondary, you'll find a plaque signed by the director and cast of \"Saved!\", a testament to the school's brief brush with Hollywood. Still, you should contact the administration if it's possible to visit. Clayton Heights Secondary is situated not far from Surrey. To visit, one can fly to Vancouver International Airport. From there, Surrey is about a half-hour drive along BC-91 and BC-10 E. You can use public transport, taking the SkyTrain's Expo Line from Vancouver to Surrey.\n\nWhile swimming in his pool, Dean (Chad Faust), Mary's boyfriend, confesses to her that he believes he might be gay. Taken aback, Mary (Jena Malone) suffers an accident and hits her head, leading to a vision where Jesus instructs her to help Dean. Convinced that Jesus will pardon her actions, Mary decides to lose her virginity to Dean, hoping this act could somehow revert his sexuality. This pivotal scene was filmed in Vancouver, the largest British Columbia city. Known for its stunning natural landscapes and cosmopolitan charm, Vancouver offers a diverse backdrop for filming. It is nestled between the Pacific Ocean and the Coast Mountains, providing an array of picturesque settings. One of the most notable features is its extensive waterfront pathways that stretch almost 30 kilometers, enveloping some of the favorite Vancouver neighborhoods. This includes the famed seawall around Stanley Park, a location that adds to the local allure. For those planning a visit, Vancouver is quite accessible. If flying, Vancouver International Airport serves as a convenient entry point. From there, the Vancouver public transportation system, including the SkyTrain, buses, and ferries, provides comprehensive city coverage. For those who prefer to drive, Vancouver is well-connected by several major highways and bridges.\n\nThe final scene happens in a hospital where Mary (Jena Malone) gives birth to a daughter. Outside, Skip (Martin Donovan), who brought flowers, hesitates about entering the hospital. As a nurse snaps a photo of the group, Mary's voice-over reveals her renewed faith in a God who loves and assists those who love and help others in need. Like many others in the film, Surrey, British Columbia, was the setting for this scene. Although the exact location isn't specified, Surrey offers a vibrant backdrop. Incorporated in 1879, Surrey is steeped in history, previously home to several Halqemeylem-speaking indigenous groups. For fans hoping to visit, Surrey has much to offer. One notable site is the Peace Arch Provincial Park, where a white arch signifies the international boundary between Canada and the U.S. The Ocean Point Shoreline Walk in Boundary Bay is another charming spot winding along Crescent Beach. Bird enthusiasts will appreciate Blackie Spit, a gathering place for migrating birds. Lastly, the Historic Stewart Farm, a late-1800s pioneer home, provides a glimpse into Surrey's past. Reaching Surrey from Vancouver is straightforward. It's a mere 30-minute drive via the Trans-Canada Highway, the BC-1 East, for those traveling by car. Alternatively, there are both bus and train services available for convenience.\n\n\"Saved!\" is a compelling blend of satire, adolescent angst, and thought-provoking themes. The film follows a traditional teenage comedy blueprint, featuring a popular clique and a band of outcasts at American Eagle Christian High School. This formula may seem familiar, but \"Saved!\" infuses it with a fresh twist by having the teen queen, Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), as an overzealous religious follower, cleverly challenging her good-girl image. The performances in the film are noteworthy. The actors convincingly portray their characters, imbuing them with depth and authenticity. The script is witty and insightful, exploring complex themes under the guise of teen comedy. What makes \"Saved!\" stand out is its filming locations. Shot amidst the picturesque landscapes of British Columbia, Canada, the film uses Surrey and Vancouver's urban and natural settings to enhance its narrative. Clayton Heights Secondary in Surrey served as the primary location for school scenes, lending an authentic high-school atmosphere to the movie. \"Saved!\" is more than just a comedic romp; it significantly contributes to the film industry. Amidst a cultural climate where censorship seems to be gaining ground, \"Saved!\" delivers a powerful message about acceptance and tolerance encapsulated in the teachings of Jesus. The film doesn't aim to overthrow mainstream Christian values but highlights and embraces them, offering a refreshing perspective on religion. \"Saved!\" is a testament to the power of satirical storytelling. Its humor, teen drama, and social commentary are worth your time. It's a reminder that even within the constraints of a genre, filmmakers can still explore profound themes and deliver impactful messages."
