        "text": "âPod Save Americaâ cohost Tommy Vietor thought foreign policy was boring and complicated until he got the education of a lifetime working for President Obamaâs National Security Council. On âPod Save the World,â he and former deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes break down the latest global developments and bring you behind the scenes with the people who were there.

Do you hate the polls but canât quit them? Well, we have a podcast thatâs just for you (and us!). Pollercoaster is Crookedâs new home for exclusive in-depth analysis across the biggest national polls, latest voter trends, and closest races up and down the ballot. Join former White House Communications Director and Pod Save America host Dan Pfeiffer and a series of expert guests to break down the polls, unpack what they actually mean, and whether or not itâs time to hit the panic button.

Inside 2024 is just the show! Each monthly episode features a rotating cast of former White House officials including Tommy Vietor, Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett and Alyssa Mastromonaco as they look ahead to the 2024 Presidential election and share the gritty (and often hilarious) reality of running for president and the many, many ways candidateâs decisions can spectacularly backfire. Expect campaign trail stories on everything from debate prep and convention speeches to campaign ads and botched media appearances.
