        "text": "The legacies of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson is incredibly well known.\n\nGerry and his wife Sylvia produced incredibly ahead-of-their-time puppet shows like Thunderbirds, Stingray and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons that captured the imaginations of youngsters across the country during the 1960s and 70s.\n\nThe shows showcased the adventures of heroes like the Tracey brothers in Thunderbirds, and the submarine captain Troy Tempest in Stingray.\n\nREAD MORE: Amazing 1960s pictures show Thunderbirds being filmed in Slough\n\nIn the 80s, another show appeared. It followed a similar sci-fi formula, with a futuristic team of heroes battling evil space monsters to save the Earth.\n\nThis programme was called Terrahawks and show is one of the newest additions to Amazon Prime. As an 80s kid, I just had to watch it.\n\nWhy? For the simple reason the evil android witch Zelda and her cronies used to reduce me to fits of weeping terror as a young lad.\n\nOne of my earliest childhood memories is running down the hall in a hospital shrieking with terror because Zelda appeared on the television screen.\n\nLooking to overcome this childhood trauma, I dipped back into the series.\n\nWho are the Terrahawks?\n\nThe Terrahawks are a top secret government organisation whose task is to protect the Earth from a group of extraterrestrial androids and aliens led by the evil Zelda.\n\nZelda and her son Young-star (age 99) and sister Cy-star, have seemingly limitless access to a range of weird and wonderful alien monsters who are sent to Earth to try to destroy the Terrahawks.\n\nLike all good villains, Zelda truly believes the human race are a bunch of selfish scumbags who need eradicating.\n\nThe Terrahawks are Dr \"Tiger\" Ninestein, Captain Mary Falconer, Captain Kate Kestrel and Lieutenant Hawkeye. They are aided by Lieutenant Hiro, who runs their Spacehawk space station.\n\nThey are also aided by a seemingly endless brigade of spherical troops called Zeroids. All of which have comical, human-style voices. I felt the commander 55 sounded a lot like Windsor Davies in It Aint Hot Mum.\n\nIt turns out that is because he was!\n\nHe also has the handy ability to increase his mass to the same as a black hole.\n\nOthers have extremely stereotypical accents, like a Frenchman, complete with a curly moustache, and a Glaswegian whom no one can understand.\n\nAnd with all this incredible technology at their disposal, this must be set way into the future, as humans have travelled to and colonised Mars and regularly visit Jupiter.\n\nWhat year could this be? Aah yes, 2020, and there no PCR tests or masks to be seen.\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nLike a lot of things in the 80s, the episodes are essentially good vs evil.\n\nZelda cooks up a scheme to destroy Terrahawks, it looks like it's working and then the valiant heroes overcome the odds to send the baddies packing.\n\nThere's very little variation on this throughout the episodes.\n\nIn fact, there's none, the plot of each episode is exactly the same.\n\nHas Terrahawks stood the test of time?\n\nFirst, off the best thing by miles about Terrahawks is the music. An absolute banger.\n\nIt is important to point out the show was made nearly 40 years ago, where attitudes as to what's acceptable and what's not acceptable were completely different.\n\nHaving said that, you can bet your life that a character like Lieutenant Hiro would not make it to the screens in 2021. He's portrayed as a very crude Japanese stereotype.\n\nSadly, not only does he mix up the letters L and R, with \"hilarious\" consequences but the other characters also adopt this trait when they talk to him.\n\nHe's portrayed as being ludicrous because he talks to his flowers and says things like: \"I shall never understand the Western brain.\"\n\nNot good.\n\nIs Terrahawks any good?\n\nTerrahawks, which was largely filmed at Berkshire's famous Bray Studios, is quite fun, but also rather peculiar.\n\nMost TV heroes of the time are chiselled, charismatic types.\n\nDr Ninestein is humourless, arrogant and, actually, thoroughly dislikable.\n\nHe's constantly horrible to the Zeroids (who are the best and funniest thing in Terrahawks), as well as his far braver co-workers who he regularly sends into the hairiest of situations.\n\nHe then always takes credit for saving the day.\n\nAnother curious aspect is that of Kate Kestrel. She's seen as the link between the Terrahawks and the outside world, because not only is she a spacefighter pilot, she's also a world-famous pop star.\n\nWhat this means is that long sections of each and every episode are dedicated to her singing her electro-pop hits.\n\nHawkeye is given very limited air-time, which is quite good because he only speaks in rhyme, and Mary Falconer is a rather bland character who speaks like Joanna Lumley.\n\nZelda and her cronies are like all 80s baddies - completely and utterly useless.\n\nThey have seemingly limitless resources and each and every week unleash what they see as the perfect plan, which always fails.\n\nThe other question I found myself asking is who is Terrahawks for?\n\nAs proved by my own hysterics all those years ago, Zelda and co, with their horrific faces and horrible, shrill, shrieking laughter will send young children running for cover.\n\nOlder kids are unlikely to warm to Ninestein, because he is so fundamentally dislikable, and the rest of the characters are just rather bland.\n\nLike always with Anderson and co, the design is terrific, but the goodies aren't good enough. It very much needs a Virgil Tracey to give it that heroic boost.\n\nZelda and co look great, and some of the aliens they unleash are really scary looking. But they're just so useless.\n\nI say give the Zeroids a spin-off, they're by far the best."
