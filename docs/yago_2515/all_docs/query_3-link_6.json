She was also interviewed Filmed in Supermarionation - both the book and documentary.\n\nShe would voice Great Aunt Sylvia - a character named after her - in the Thunderbirds Are Go! episode Designated Driver.

She said \"I felt that I’d been on a wonderful Thunderbirds adventure. You, the fans, will I'm sure, appreciate the sensitive adaptation and I'm personally thrilled that the production team have paid us the great compliment of bringing to life our original concept for the big screen. If we had made it ourselves (and we have had over 30 years to do it!) we could not have improved on this new version. It is a great tribute to the original creative team who inspired the movie all those years ago. It was a personal thrill for me to see my characters come to life on the big screen\".\n\nThunderbirds Are Go![]\n\nGreat Aunt Sylvia (voice)\n\nGallery: Characters Voiced by Sylvia Anderson[]\n\nBiographies[]\n\nGallery[]\n\n[]"
