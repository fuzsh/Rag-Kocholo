        "text": "The spotlight turned to Sylvia, with devastating personal consequences. “I had become important because of Lady Penelope,” Sylvia recalled . “Being one of the few successful female producers at the time, I got a lot of attention and my husband found that hard because he was doing great work.\n\n\"Whenever we were interviewed I always had to step back a bit but then that would frustrate Gerry too and he’d say, ‘Go on then, go speak to your reporters.’ He felt I was upstaging him.”\n\nDuring a press tour of Scotland, Gerry accused Sylvia of undermining him. She left him but then realised she was pregnant and went back to him. They had a daughter, Dee, and a son, Gerry Junior, but the marriage deteriorated further when Gerry moved on to making live action dramas.\n\nAs Sylvia put it, “He had actresses around him not puppets.” He announced he was leaving her in 1975 at the wrap party to mark the end of the first series of the cult drama Space: 1999. They divorced five years later.\n\n\"Things had changed,” said Sylvia. “When we were both poor and working very hard I was a help. He didn’t really want a woman who was going to compete in any way although I didn’t realise I was competing at the time.”\n\nSylvia cut all ties with their company and reinvented herself as a talent scout for the American cable TV company, HBO and published her memoirs, My FAB Years (a reference to the number plate on Lady Penelope’s car).\n\nGerry took little pride in Thunderbirds and died in 2012, having never achieved the same success with live actors. He refused to have anything to do with the 2004 live action adaptation but sulked when he did not appear in the credits.\n\nSylvia, on the other hand, endorsed it and acted as production consultant. She also embraced the 2013 remake Thunderbirds Are Go! which used CGI technology. Actress Rosamund Pike voiced Lady Penelope but Sylvia featured in one episode as Lady P’s eccentric aunt. In her way Sylvia Anderson kept on pulling the strings."
