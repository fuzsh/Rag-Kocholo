        "text": "May 9, 2016\n\nI’m here recounting my interview with Sylvia Anderson. Unfortunately, we experienced some technical difficulties during recording, so I want to recreate it for you. The last portion of our talk focused on the challenging position of her team, including helping people in crisis and supporting them.\n\nI asked Sylvia how she keeps strong for her clients. She has to keep herself refreshed, or she gives out stale water, she said. One way is that when she’s off the grounds she leaves her work at the office.\n\nSince we’d been talking about how they make it clear to their clients that they’re the same, I wondered how transparent are they with clients? “We have to be careful because clients are in their own crisis, and if we share our current crisis, then they jump on board to solve our issues. It’s a welcome but unhealthy diversion, so we only share situations that we’ve come through and had victory in or have learned lessons from.” “Everyone needs a support system.” Current staff struggles are saved for sharing outside the EGM circle. Sylvia continued that everyone needs to have a support system of two people in their lives; one we can let see us in our weakness and another who can be a truth teller, who has permission to take us aside and share a hard truth we need to hear.\n\nSo to give back, I wanted to show you how you can learn more about the mission. You can go to their website at www.EGmission.org. They offer poverty awareness training, volunteering opportunities, and tours. They’re always happy to talk about their mission. There are resources for all people in the community who need help, whether they are homeless, struggling to maintain their home, or dealing with the associated struggles.\n\nI asked Sylvia for any final thoughts. She said, “We have a responsibility to the poor. Isaiah 43 says ‘bring my sons from afar and my daughters from ends of the Earth, everyone who is called by my name who I created for my glory whom I formed and made.’ That’s what we’re doing; bringing in God’s sons and daughters, and if we’re not giving away to people who have no way to give back to us, then we’d better check our faith.”\n\nI’ve worked with Sandy before so I had utter confidence in what she suggested as a listing price. When she listed it I signed the papers and two seconds later the sign went up and about an hour and a half later I can’t even begin to tell you how many agents walked in with their clients. That was on a Thursday and we had all the offers that we needed by Saturday. What more can I say. I was hysterical because I didn’t expect it to happen that fast. She was very calming to me because I really was [hysterical]. I thought I’d have a couple weeks or something, I didn’t expect to have an offer in two days. She not only calmed me, she had an open house. You know I was saying let’s forget the open house and she said no, this can make the difference between the listing price or less. So I said okay, fine. In order to prep the house she had equipment that I could borrow that was so very necessary such as a power washer, a rug cleaner. This woman is on the ball. I will tell you at the close of sale things went a little screwy and she knocked herself to make things right for me. I can’t praise her enough.\n\nShow Less\n\n“We had been trying to sell our house with a different agent. [Then] we got Sandy. Very much of a go getter and which was appreciated because my husband and I didn’t have a whole lot of time to set up things like open houses and what not. I mean she did a lot of work setting up open houses and marketing it. [She] had a great photographer come in. If something needed to be checked at the house, my husband and I were both out of the house for a time, and sometimes we’d need a quick turnaround on looking at something and we wouldn’t be able to make it up and so she’d actually go over and handle it. Like I think there were a couple times she took the garbage can down from the road. Which I wasn’t even expecting her to do that. But that was fantastic. We had a question of the square footage and she actually went over and measured the whole house and you know did a quick estimate there just to do a quick sanity check. So that was really good.”\n\nShow Less\n\n“Oh Sandy was great, we really appreciated her help, she was awesome. We were going to see some houses that she had listed that she found for us to look at and on the way my wife saw an open house. We stopped, we liked that place and it wasn’t listed with Sandy, we told her about it and she said would you like to make an offer, we made an offer and she coordinated the whole thing with the other realtor and we ended up getting the house and it was fantastic for us throughout the whole process. She was available night and day no matter what time or always willing to listen to our questions, was very responsive, text, email, or by phone [we] could always get ahold of her or she would be calling us back or contacting us right away whenever we had any type of questions, concerns, or misunderstandings. [She] was very patient but also really good at communicating and helping us through the whole process and teaching us how the whole thing worked and she was great.”\n\nShow Less\n\nWe got a house we wanted, we got rid of a house we didn’t want. In spite of all the little things that were caused by other things outside of her control it went really well. The buyers of our house that we were [selling] were making it difficult and she was going out of her way to help us get everything taken care of. Getting it repaired, she actually supplied us with a moving truck and couple of strong guys to help us move since we got behind the 8-ball between the buyers of our old house and getting into our new house. I mean considering all the stuff that happened it went really well. I mean there was a lot of things that got in the way, a lot of circumstantial stuff that doesn’t normally happen in the process of buying and selling homes and she was working for us on the selling and the buying aspect. Considering all the stuff that tried to sidetrack us it all went really well and she kept going above and beyond to get us where we needed to be and get into the new house.\n\nShow Less"
