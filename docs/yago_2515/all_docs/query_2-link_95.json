        "text": "The world of television was today in mourning at the loss of one of the most innovative and creative individuals to have graced the medium with his presence. Gerry Anderson, the man who produced the classic puppet series of Thunderbirds, Joe 90 and Captain Scarlett has passed on at the age of 83.\n\nGerald Alexander Abrahams was born in the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Obstetric Hospital in Bloomsbury and lived the early part of his life in Kilburn, London. Born of Jewish descent, the family’s ancestral name was Bieloglovski, his grandfather having fled from Eastern Europe. The family name was changed on arrival by British immigration in 1895 and was changed again by his mother who liked the sound of the name Anderson.\n\nAfter finishing National Service in 1950, Gerry Anderson worked in photographic portrait work and in air traffic control but it is his work in television that will forever endear him to the memories of children and adults alike. After a puppet series called The Adventures of Twizzle, Gerry Anderson’s first memorable series Thunderbirds came into being on the I.T.V. channel in 1965. This iconic series with the Tracy family and International Rescue was a huge hit with children everywhere. From there he developed the stunning series of Captain Scarlett and The Mysterons, Joe 90 and the 1980’s hit Terrahawks.\n\nGerry Anderson’s time with television was not just confined to marionettes. In the 1970’s Gerry Anderson and his wife Sylvia, who had voiced the iconic Lady Penelope in Thunderbirds, produced the television series Space 1999 which starred Hollywood legend Martin Landau, Barbara Bain, Barry Morse and Catherine Schell.\n\nIt was during the filming of Space 1999 that the pair’s marriage started to break down irrevocably and a partnership that had been so victorious was torn apart.\n\nGerry Anderson also had success in the world of cinema. In 1969, the film Doppelganger: Far Side of the Sun was released. The film, which starred Roy Thinnes, Herbert Lom and Ian Henry had as its premise the joint venture between N.A.S.A. and the European Space Exploration Council to investigate a planet on the direct opposite side of the Sun on Earth’s same orbit. Although panned by critics, it has become a cult film in its own right.\n\nNick Williams, chairman of Fanderson, the Gerry Anderson Appreciation Society, said, “To those who met him Gerry was a quiet, unassuming but determined man. His desire to make the best films he could drove him and his talented teams to innovate, take risks, and do everything necessary to produce quite inspirational works. Gerry’s legacy is that he inspired so many people and continues to bring so much joy to so many millions of people around the world.”\n\nActor Brian Blessed, who worked with Anderson on shows including The Day After Tomorrow and Space 1999, told the B.B.C. News: “I think a light has gone out in the universe. He had a great sense of humour. He wasn’t childish but child-like and he had a tremendous love of the universe and astronomy and scientists.He got their latest theories, which he would expand on. He was always galvanised and full of energy\n\nIn the last couple of years of his life he has suffered with Alzheimer’s Disease, a condition he had had since 2010. His son Jamie on the announcement of his father’s death said, “He died peacefully in his sleep at midday today having suffered with mixed dementia for the past few years.”\n\nHaving been diagnosed with mixed dementia at the age of 81, he and his son Jamie became active supporters of Alzheimer’s Society, recently taking part in the Society’s flagship fundraiser Memory Walk.\n\nHe requested that any fans wishing to make donations in honour of his father should contribute to the Alzheimer’s Society.\n\nOn a personal note, as someone who was very fortunate enough to meet Gerry Anderson at a memorabilia fair in Birmingham, it was evident just speaking to him that he was a man of great depth, very giving in his life to his fans and one of the most interesting people to have worked in television. The passing of Gerry Anderson is a sad loss to all his fans. He gave an outstanding gift to boys and girls through his creations, the continuing ability to dream and create.\n\nGerry Anderson (born Gerald Alexander Abrahams), born 14th April 1929: Bloomsbury, London. Died 26th December 2012\n\nIan D. Hall"
