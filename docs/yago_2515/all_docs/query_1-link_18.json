        "text": "Sylvia Anderson, best known as the voice of Lady Penelope in the TV show Thunderbirds, has died after a short illness, her family has confirmed.\n\nAnderson co-created the hit science-fiction puppet series, which ran from 1965, with her late husband Gerry.\n\nIn a career spanning five decades, she also worked on shows Joe 90 and Captain Scarlet, and for US TV network HBO.\n\nShe died at her Berkshire home, aged 88. Her daughter described her as \"a mother and a legend\".\n\n\"Her intelligence was phenomenal but her creativity and tenacity unchallenged. She was a force in every way,\" Dee Anderson said.\n\nHer former husband Gerry Anderson died in 2012 after suffering from Alzheimer's.\n\nNick Williams, Chairman of Fanderson - a fan club dedicated to the work of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson - told BBC Breakfast she was a \"huge influence\" on the entertainment industry.\n\n\"She was one of the first really prominent women in the film and TV industry,\" he said, adding that Anderson leaves behind \"an amazing legacy of fantastic television, really groundbreaking entertainment.\"\n\nRae Earl, writer of the My Mad Fat Diary television series, tweeted, external: \"Sylvia Anderson was responsible for some of my favourite TV.\"\n\nWhen he started his own company, AP Films, she joined him, and the couple began making puppet shows.\n\nThey developed a production technique using electronic marionette puppets, called Supermarionation, in which the voices were recorded first, and when the puppets were filmed, the electric signal from the taped dialogue was hooked up to sensors in the puppets' heads.\n\nThat made the puppets' lips move perfectly in time with the soundtrack.\n\nIn 1963, the couple came up with the idea for Thunderbirds, which told the story of the Tracy family who form a secret organisation dedicated to saving human life, set in the future."
