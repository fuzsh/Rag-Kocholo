        "text": "Thunderbirds co-creator Sylvia Anderson , best known for voicing Lady Penelope in the hit TV show, has died aged 88.\n\nThe producer and writer created the Supermarionation puppet series with husband Gerry in 1965.\n\nShe died at her home in Bray, Berkshire, following a short illness.\n\nMany of the show’s puppets were handmade by John Blundell’s puppet workshop at the mac in Cannon Hill Park, Birmingham.\n\nIn 2014, the Birmingham Mail’s Graham Young interview Sylvia about the world’s most famous puppets.\n\nShe told him how she remains extremely active, and was rarely asleep before midnight and up by 7am at her riverside Berkshire home.\n\n“It’s the way I’ve always been,” said the mother of two and grandmother of four. “I’d hate to get to 10am and think I’d wasted half a day.”\n\nSeveral times during the interview, she told of her unwillingness to revisit the acrimonious break-up of her marriage to Gerry, who suffered from Alzheimer’s in his later years and died on Boxing Day 2012, aged 83.\n\n“So much has been written... and I don’t like people speaking on my behalf,” she said.\n\n“If I went down the spite and anger route, I wouldn’t like myself.\n\n“Gerry met someone working for us.\n\n“I’ve got over all of that. I’ve had another life. It was all a muddle. I try to keep well clear of that. He wanted to come back but I had had enough and it’s all a long time ago.\n\n“Thunderbirds was a very happy time.”\n\nGerry remarried but Sylvia didn’t.\n\nThe pair continued to go their own separate ways at Pinewood, Gerry working on shows like Space Precinct, Sylvia as the England-based original programming representative for US company HBO.\n\n“I have a nice house, not too big, near to the Thames,” she said. “I like the garden and people come to visit me.\n\n“And, because I love reading, the house is full of books. I love the smell of them and always have two or three on the go at once.”\n\nSylvia revealed how the husband and wife worked together on the show that was the background to so many childhoods.\n\n“Gerry did all the boys’ own stuff and I used to write the characters,” she says.\n\n“People would write to me, saying they’d had a terrible childhood, but how much they’d enjoyed switching on at certain dates and times and that ‘what made my childhood bearable was watching your shows’.”\n\nIn the early days, she says the Andersons were both looked after – and then effectively sold down the river – by Lew Grade, the boss of ATV.\n\n“As a writer and actor voicing the characters, I wasn’t worth a lot,” she admits.\n\n“We had no choice but to sell the rights.\n\n“Lew had been very good to us and we owe a lot to him. He gave us creative freedom and would say ‘so long as you do it right and show it to me when it’s finished’.\n\n“But he was also a businessman. When Lew bought us out, he gave us the least money possible. And if you didn’t own the whole of ATV, you just had to go on to the next thing.\n\n“Because I did a lot of the voices, I get some repeat fees, but it’s not huge. You just have the pleasure of knowing you’ve done something that people think is fantastic.”\n\nLooking back at the original shows, some of the puppet parts were made in Birmingham by John Blundell’s puppet workshop at the mac in Cannon Hill Park.\n\n“Each puppet had a duplicate in case anything happened,” recalled Sylvia. “They would also need interchangeable heads, one to blink, to look sad, fierce and so on.\n\n“We’ve never yet been able to produce a puppet that can stand, sit down and blink at the same time.”"
