        "text": "Sylvia Anderson's daughter Dee has said she would like her late mother to be remembered as \"the first lady of sci fi\".\n\nBest known for voicing Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward in Supermarionation puppet series Thunderbirds , the co-creator of the enduring show has died aged 88.\n\nThe London-born star recently worked as head of programming for HBO in the UK and had been writing a show with her daughter entitled The Last Station.\n\nThe pair had also planned The Pink FAB Ball, a charity ball in aid of Breast Cancer Care, which will now go ahead on May 6 in memory of Sylvia Anderson.\n\n\"'Retirement' was a dirty word to her,\" her daughter told the Press Association.\n\n\"She taught me a lot about creativity, about writing. She was the strongest person I've never met - she never gave up.\"\n\nA producer and writer, Thunderbirds was just one of the shows Ms Anderson created with husband Gerry, who died in 2012 aged 83 after suffering with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe couple had divorced in 1981.\n\nOn the subject of Ms Anderson's contribution to Thunderbirds, her daughter said: \"I know that Gerry had his name above the title because in those days women weren't really recognised, but she said to me that she didn't really care.\n\n\"I spoke to her about it recently and I said, 'Weren't you upset that Gerry got all the kudos?' and she said 'No'.\"\n\n\"They were all film-makers, they weren't interested in creating so all her ideas got put forward and that made her happy.\n\n\"She didn't care about being recognised.\"\n\nMs Anderson portrayed Lady Penelope in the puppet series from its debut in 1965 until 1968.\n\nShe played the aristocrat's great aunt in Thunderbirds Are Go, ITV's 2015 remake, which features David Graham reprising his original role as Parker, Lady Penelope's driver.\n\n\"She was also very emphatic that all the characters she created have an emotional connection to the audience,\" her daughter stated.\n\n\"She said that's why the show has lasted as long as it did - because people cared about the characters.\"\n\nMs Anderson added: \"I hope I've inherited some of her tenacity and strength.\n\n\"I would like her to be remembered as somebody who loved the industry she was in, cared about it and cared about people.\n\n\"I'd like her to be remembered as the first lady of sci fi.\"\n\nLondon-born Graham, who will forever be associated with Parker, hailed the late TV industry figure as \"very generous\".\n\n\"It was only recently I was on The Graham Norton Show with her and it was a sort of goodbye as she was looking a little frail,\" he said.\n\n\"I always had a very good professional working relationship with her.\n\n\"She was always very generous to work with and she had a wonderful, creative mind.\"\n\nIn addition to Thunderbirds, her screen credits also include puppet series Supercar, Fireball XL5 and Stingray.\n\nGraham called her \"one of the great innovators of entertainment\".\n\n\"She will long be remembered for that and I'll remember her with great affection,\" he said.\n\nComedian David Baddiel also paid tribute.\n\nHe wrote the Thunderbirds Are Go episode Designated Driver, which featured Ms Anderson.\n\nOn Twitter, he posted a message saying he was \"very sad\" to hear of her death.\n\n\"She was in my Thunderbirds Are Go episode last year and was fantastic, and lovely,\" he said.\n\nThe British Film Institute tweeted to say they were \"saddened\" and Sky News' Kay Burley also took to the social media site to express her thoughts.\n\n\"RIP Sylvia Anderson - voice of Lady Penelope,\" she wrote."
