        "text": "The co-creator of Thunderbirds has died aged 88.\n\nSylvia Anderson not only invented the show with her late husband back in the Sixties but also voiced the character of Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward.\n\nShe died at her home in Bray, Buckinghamshire, following a short illness, her daughter Dee Anderson confirmed.\n\n‘Sylvia was a mother and a legend – her intelligence was phenomenal but her creativity and tenacity unchallenged,’ her daughter said. ‘She was a force in every way, and will be sadly missed.’\n\nSylvia’s husband Gerry died in 2012 aged 83 after suffering with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nTheir Supermarionation puppet series was a hit with adults and children alike, and as well as voicing Lady P from 195 to 1968, she worked on Joe 90, Captain Scarlet and Stingray.\n\nThe south London-born puppeteer worked in the TV industry for fifty years, and was most recently the head of programming for HBO in the UK.\n\nIn the Thunderbirds reboot, Thunderbirds Are Go, a character called Great aunt Sylvia was inspired by and voiced by Sylvia.\n\nThe outfit she wears was based on Lady Penelope’s outfit from the classic episode The Duchess Assingment.\n\nSylvia and her daughter were working on a TV show called The Last Station before her death, as well as a charity ball for Breast Cancer Care, which will now go ahead in May in her memory.\n\nShe is survived by her daughter, who is a singer-songwriter, son Gerry Anderson Junior, an anaesthetist, four grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.\n\nMORE : As Thunderbirds turns 50, this new manual shows exactly what those classic craft look like on the inside"
