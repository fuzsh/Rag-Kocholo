        "text": "Sylvia Anderson, the co-creator of Thunderbirds who was best known for voicing Lady Penelope in the hit TV show, has died aged 88.\n\nThe producer and writer devised the Supermarionation puppet series, one of Britain's most fondly-remembered children's TV shows, with husband Gerry Anderson in the 1960s.\n\nMrs Anderson - who husband Gerry died in 2012 aged 83 after suffering with Alzheimer's disease - passed away at her home in Bray, Berkshire, following a short illness.\n\nConfirming her death on Wednesday morning, her daughter Dee Anderson said: \"Sylvia was a mother and a legend - her intelligence was phenomenal but her creativity and tenacity unchallenged.\n\n\"She was a force in every way, and will be sadly missed.\"\n\nAs well as voicing Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward in Thunderbirds from its debut in 1965 until 1968, Sylvia also worked on Joe 90, Captain Scarlet and Stingray.\n\nBorn in south London to a boxing champion and a dressmaker, she went on to have a career in television spanning five decades.\n\nShe recently worked as head of programming for HBO in the UK and had been writing a show with her daughter entitled The Last Station.\n\nMrs Anderson's daughter said she \"would always find time to take care of people who were suffering or in need of support\".\n\nThe pair had planned a charity ball for Breast Cancer Care, which will now go ahead in May in her memory.\n\nMrs Anderson is survived by her daughter, who is a singer-songwriter, son Gerry Anderson Junior, an anaesthetist, four grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.\n\nSpeaking last September, Mrs Anderson said she had had \"fun\" playing a great aunt to her original character, voiced by Oscar nominee Rosamund Pike, in ITV reboot Thunderbirds Are Go.\n\nShe had a \"creativity and genuine love for her characters\" that touched fans around the world, her daughter said.\n\nWhen asked if she saw herself as a pioneer for women in television during the 1960s, Mrs Anderson was modest.\n\n\"I never waved the flag or anything about being a woman, but I was a woman with a group of men,\" she said."
