She usually directed the bi-weekly voice recording sessions, and provided the voices of many female characters, most memorably Lady Penelope in the Thunderbirds television series and subsequent films. She and Gerry Anderson married in 1960 and were divorced in 1980 following a 5-year separation.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Sylvia Anderson, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​",
