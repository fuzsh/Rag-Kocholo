        "text": "Here's our run-down of the Marvel movies in order, both chronological and release. As the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is ever-expanding, and with new movies being released this year, what better way to get fully caught up, or relive your favorites, than by watching the movies in order?\n\nYou'll need a Disney Plus subscription if you're going to watch the Marvel movies in order as the streaming platform is the home of the MCU these days. It's also home to the TV shows that Marvel Studios has produced, but they don't feature in this guide. If you are going to follow an order, we recommend watching the movies in chronological as opposed to release order, so you can follow the timeline accurately.\n\nThere's no shame in only wanting to watch the best Marvel movies or just the movies that feature infinity stones. But, just because the Infinity Saga is over, Marvel Studios doesn't intend on slowing down. Whether you're a Spider-Man superfan or an Avengers advocate, watching the Marvel movies in order is the ultimate superhero marathon and the best way to get a galactic dosage of out-of-this-world content.\n\nWe'll be with you every step of the way as you make your way through all the Marvel movies, and yes, we are aware that'll take some time. Below, we've included movies exclusively in the MCU, so movies like Mobius, Venom and Madame Web don't appear. If Marvel isn't enough to scratch your sci-fi itch, you can check out our guides to the best movies and TV shows on Disney Plus, Netflix, Amazon and Paramount Plus. But, if you want to watch the Marvel movies in order, scroll down below.\n\nThere are light spoilers ahead for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. You've been warned!\n\nMarvel movies in chronological order\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger\n\nCaptain Marvel\n\nIron Man\n\nIron Man 2\n\nThe Incredible Hulk\n\nThor\n\nThe Avengers\n\nThor: The Dark World\n\nIron Man 3\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron\n\nAnt-Man\n\nCaptain America: Civil War\n\nBlack Widow\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming\n\nBlack Panther\n\nDoctor Strange\n\nThor: Ragnarok\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp\n\nAvengers: Infinity War\n\nAvengers: Endgame\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\n\nEternals\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\n\nThor: Love and Thunder\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\n\nThe Marvels\n\n1. Captain America: The First Avenger\n\nRelease date: July 22, 2011\n\nCast: Chris Evans, Hayley Atwell, Hugo Weaving\n\nIf you want to watch all the Marvel movies in chronological order then you have to start with Captain America: The First Avenger. Not the best Marvel movie by a long shot, but given it takes place during World War 2, in 1942 to be exact, its setting is certainly the oldest. Travel back in time to watch Cap fight HYDRA masquerading as Nazis and fall for Peggy Carter, only to be frozen in ice so he could conveniently leapfrog through time to the present day and eventually team up with the Avengers. This is where it all began...\n\n2. Captain Marvel\n\nRelease date: March 8, 2019\n\nCast: Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jude Law\n\nNext, you'll jump forward in time to the 90s where Captain Marvel discovers grunge as well as a community of Skrulls hiding in plain sight on Earth. Set in 1995, Marvel gave us a strong blast of nostalgia with this origin movie, which saw appearances from 90s icons such as Blockbuster, payphones, and Nine Inch Nails. Plus, it was the first Marvel movie to have one of its main characters de-aged using some impressive CGI so a young Nick Fury could kick ass right alongside one of the most powerful superheroes in the franchise.\n\n3. Iron Man\n\nRelease date: May 2, 2008\n\nCast: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard\n\nThat brings us to Iron Man, the very first Marvel movie made, but the third in chronological order. Set in 2010, this origin movie started it all for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Tony Stark creates the Iron Man suit to escape his captors and then become a powerful but arrogant superhero. With his P.A. Pepper Potts and friend Col. James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes along for the ride, Tony eventually takes down baddie Obadiah Stane who arranged Tony's kidnapping so he could take over Stark Industries.\n\n4. Iron Man 2\n\nRelease date: May 7, 2010\n\nCast: Robert Downey Jr., Mickey Rourke, Gwyneth Paltrow\n\nLess than a year later Tony is back in hot water as the son of a former Stark Industries employee, Ivan Vanko, tries to kill him using his own version of Tony's Iron Man suit technology. And, as if that wasn't bad enough, Tony finds out that the palladium core in the Arc Reactor that keeps him alive and powers his suit is actually killing him. All in all, Tony isn't having a great year, but thanks to a little help from Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff, aka S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Black Widow, he eventually cures himself and takes down Vanko.\n\n5. The Incredible Hulk\n\nRelease date: June 13, 2008\n\nCast: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth\n\nAt the same time, Bruce Banner is trying to find a cure for his condition which sees him turn into a big, raging, green monster anytime he feels a bit irritated. Set in 2011, Banner is being hunted by General Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross who sends special forces soldier Emil Blonsky to take him down. Unfortunately, Blonsky is no match for the Hulk which is why he agrees to be injected with a similar serum to the one that turned Banner into the Hulk. The problem is, it also makes him insane. Eventually becoming Abomination and going on a killing rampage, Banner convinces Ross to let him stop Blonsky and save the day.\n\nWhether this movie counts as part of the MCU is up for debate - Disney/Marvel say no, but it was very clearly meant to be in the MCU when it was created, as evidenced by Tony Stark's post-credits cameo.\n\n6. Thor\n\nRelease date: May 6, 2011\n\nCast: Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman\n\nAlso at the same time (yes, seriously, 2011 was a busy year for the MCU), God of Thunder Thor is banished to Earth by his dad Odin and discovers he's no longer worthy enough to lift his favorite hammer. There he meets scientist Jane Foster and learns how to live as a mortal for a while. Meanwhile, on Asgard, Thor's brother Loki, the God of Mischief, finds out he's actually adopted and doesn't take it particularly well. Eventually, Thor proves himself worthy enough to once again wield his hammer and returns to Asgard to stop Loki from causing any more trouble, only to witness his brother supposedly die.\n\n7. Avengers Assemble\n\nRelease date: May 4, 2012\n\nCast: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson\n\nSurprise! A year after Loki's 'death' and he's back trying to take over Earth, which leads to the creation of the Avengers in 2012. A recently unfrozen Cap, Iron Man (who's trying to be slightly more of a team player), a reluctant Banner/Hulk, and Thor (who's traveled to Earth to stop his brother) all team up to stop Loki. They're also joined by Black Widow and her pal Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye. Long story short, a huge battle ensues destroying most of New York, but eventually ends with Loki being captured and taken back to Asgard for a spanking.\n\n8. Thor: The Dark World\n\nRelease date: November 8, 2013\n\nCast: Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston\n\nFresh off the back of taking down his brother, Thor returns to Earth and runs into Jane who has accidentally absorbed a dangerous substance called the Aether, and is more than a little upset Thor didn't call her when he was in town. After discovering that the Aether will kill Jane, Thor enlists the help of his wayward brother to trick dark elf Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane. Loki is, once again, supposedly killed during the confrontation and Malekith tries to use the Aether to wreak havoc on Earth, but is stopped by Thor and Jane.\n\n9. Iron Man 3\n\nRelease date: May 3, 2013\n\nCast: Robert Downey Jr., Guy Pearce, Gwyneth Paltrow\n\nWhile this is all happening, Tony is struggling given his experiences during the Battle of New York. Convinced that the only way to protect Earth and the ones he loves is with more Iron Man suits, he spends the better half of 2012 creating suit after suit after suit, only for bombs to start going off all over the place, allegedly orchestrated by the Mandarin. During his investigation into the Mandarin, Tony discovers that scientist Aldrich Killian is really behind the attacks and that he's kidnapped the President. Tony teams up with Rhodey to save the President, eventually destroying all his suits and promising Pepper he'll tone down the superhero thing for a while.\n\n10. Captain America: The Winter Soldier\n\nRelease date: March 26, 2014\n\nCast: Chris Evans, Sebastian Stan, Scarlett Johansson\n\nAfter the events of Avengers Assemble, Captain America is spending 2014 continuing to adjust to present-day life when an assassin called the Winter Soldier starts causing trouble for S.H.I.E.L.D. It turns out that the Winter Soldier is actually Cap's old friend Bucky from 1942 who's been brainwashed and periodically kept on ice by HYDRA. Oh, and HYDRA has taken over S.H.I.E.L.D. as well. Cap, along with Black Widow and his new friend Sam Wilson, aka Falcon, help bring HYDRA/S.H.I.E.L.D. down, but Bucky ends up on the run.\n\n11. Guardians of the Galaxy\n\nRelease date: July 31, 2014\n\nCast: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Lee Pace\n\nThat same year Star-Lord is roaming the galaxy trying to find a buyer for a powerful Infinity Stone he's stolen when he gets ambushed by Thanos's adopted daughter, Gamora, and bounty hunters, Rocket and Groot, who are also all after the stone. After being sent to prison and meeting Drax, the unlikely friends team up, break out, and decide to sell the stone to keep it from baddie Ronan, who wants to use it to destroy Xandar. All doesn't quite go to plan and they end up in a big battle with Ronan, which ends with an awkward dance-off and victory for the Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nNotably, Guardians of the Galaxy sent the MCU into space for the first time (if you don't count Iron Man's very brief spaceflight in Avengers Assemble).\n\n12. Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2\n\nRelease date: May 5, 2017\n\nCast: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Kurt Russell\n\nNo sooner had the Guardians of the Galaxy defeated Ronan, then they were faced with another big baddie in the same year, this time with some added family drama. Star-Lord's estranged, but very powerful daddy, Ego, turns up and announces he wants to teach Star-Lord his skills. But, before they can get very far with the lessons, it turns out that Ego is a mass-murdering psychopath and the Guardians have to destroy him, which isn’t as easy as it sounds. At least they made a new friend in the form of empath Mantis.\n\n13. Avengers: Age of Ultron\n\nRelease date: May 1, 2015\n\nCast: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth\n\n2015 saw the Avengers having to reform to defeat another villain, except this time it was one of their own making. Well, Tony's anyway. Still desperately trying to protect humanity, he creates an A.I. robot called Ultron which is more interested in enslaving humanity than saving it. The heroes have to work together – along with some new friends in the form of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch – to stop Ultron, but it comes at a high price, with the destruction of Sokovia.\n\n14. Ant-Man\n\nRelease date: July 17, 2015\n\nCast: Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly\n\nWhile the Avengers were taking down Ultron, ex-con Scott Lang was breaking into Hank Pym's house and accidentally stealing his Ant-Man suit. After getting caught, Hank reveals he set up the whole thing to see if Scott was good enough to become the next Ant-Man. The good news is he passed, the bad news is that Hank needs his help to stop his former protégé and all-round jerk, Darren Cross, from developing his own suit. After training with Hank and his daughter Hope, Scott finally gets the shrinking thing down and saves the day.\n\n15.
