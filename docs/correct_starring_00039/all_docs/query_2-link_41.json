        "text": "The Bridget Jones film trilogy has returned to Netflix UK ahead of the fourth film.\n\nAll three films – Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004) and Bridget Jones's Baby (2016) – are now available to watch on the streaming service, as filming on the anticipated fourth movie continues.\n\nBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy was officially announced in April this year with Renée Zellweger back as the famous rom-com heroine. The film is set to land in UK cinemas on Valentine's Day next year.\n\nRelated: Bridget Jones' Renée Zellweger joins new TV show\n\nThe Bridget Jones movies are based on the popular newspaper-column-turned-book-series by Helen Fielding. The journalist and author published bestseller Bridget Jones' Diary in 1996, following up with Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason in 1999.\n\nBoth novels were translated into big-screen adaptations in the early noughties, with Zellweger in the title role. In the first movie, Bridget finds herself in a love triangle with charming publishing boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) and high-profile lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), with the original movie's plot loosely based on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.\n\nThe second film once again saw our hapless romantic heroine tested in her pursuit of love, seeing her choose again between Cleaver and Darcy.\n\nRelated: Bridget Jones 4 is bringing back more original cast members\n\nBridget Jones's Baby followed over 10 years later, based on a new screenplay by Fielding. As the title suggests, the film sees Bridget preparing for motherhood, with Grey's Anatomy star Patrick Dempsey joining the cast as a new love interest, Jack Qwant.\n\nGrant was noticeably absent from the third film as Cleaver – but the franchise left room for a return in the future, with the ending of Bridget Jones' Baby confirming his character was in fact alive after being feared dead in a plane crash.\n\nWhilst Grant is back for the upcoming fourth film, Bridget fans will not be seeing Firth reprise his role as Darcy. This is due to Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy being based on the events of Fielding's third book of the same name, released in 2013.\n\nAdditional cast members back for the next Bridget instalment include Sally Phillips, Shirley Henderson, James Callis and Sarah Solemani respectively as Bridget's firm friends Sharon, Jude, Tom and Miranda.\n\nJim Broadbent and Gemma Jones will also be back as Bridget's parents Colin and Pamela, with Emma Thompson returning as Doctor Rawlings from the third film.\n\nCast newcomers include Doctor Strange's Chiwetel Ejiofor and One Day's Leo Woodall, in addition to Now You See Me's Isla Fisher, Anatomy of a Scandal's Josette Simon, The Last of Us' Nico Parker and I Hate Suzie's Leila Farzad.\n\nBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy will be released on February 14, 2025.\n\nCheck out Digital Spy's curated round-up of the best Amazon Prime Day deals for 2024 here\n\nYou Might Also Like"
