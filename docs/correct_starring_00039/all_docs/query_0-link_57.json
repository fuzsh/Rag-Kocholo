        "text": "Chiwetel Ejiofor is on his way to becoming one of Hollywood’s biggest stars, and he doesn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon. You might recognize him from his role as Mordo in Doctor Strange, but he’s also starred in films like Love Actually, The Martian, 2012 and 12 Years A Slave, which earned him an Academy Award nomination and a BAFTA for Best Actor—and he was also recently cast as Scar in Disney’s upcoming Lion King.\n\nEjiofor will be making his directorial debut with a film adaptation of The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind, starring newcomer Maxwell Simba. The film follows 13-year old William as he is kicked out of school due to his family not being able to afford it, and how he still finds a way to save his village from starving by using his father’s (Ejiofor) bicycle to build a windmill.\n\nThe film will feature strong themes of environmental sustainability and the importance of accessible education in countries like Malawi, where resources are there but opportunities are scarce. The cast also features Noma Dumezweni (Hermione in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child), Aïssa Maïga, and Joseph Marcell (The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air).\n\nWhat do you think about this? Are you excited to see the book come to life on the big screen? Let us know in the comments below!"
