Perhaps the strangest thing about 2012 is that the bad parts of the film are among the most enjoyable, b...\n\nAmerican Gangster\n\nAmerican Gangster is compelling in the same way that many mob-related motion pictures are compelling, but it fails to achieve the greatness that the best of them attain.
