        "text": "Marvel Studios is reportedly courting Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor for a key but unspecified role in Doctor Strange.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, talks between Marvel and the 12 Years a Slave actor's reps are in \"early stages.\"\n\n\"Several sources have intoned that Ejiofor is wanted for a villainous role but some insiders have pooh-poohed that. The villain is likely to be classic bad guy Baron Mordo,\" the trade claims. \"If Marvel feels like mixing up ethnicities, a possible role could be that of Wong, the monk servant to Strange who is adept in martial arts. Another possibility is the role of the Ancient One, a semi-immortal mystic who mentors Strange and is the Sorcerer Supreme of this dimension.\"\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch plays the title role in the Scott Derrickson-directed movie, which opens November 4, 2016.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor's screen credits include Serenity, Children of Men, 2012, Redbelt, and American Gangster. He'll next be seen in a pair of sci-fi films, Z for Zachariah and Ridley Scott's The Martian."
