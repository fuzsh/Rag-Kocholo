        "text": "Marvel star Chiwetel Ejiofor has said that the movie industry needs to embrace diversity in order \"to survive\".\n\nTalking to Digital Spy for the release of Netflix's The Old Guard, Ejiofor spoke about the diversity and inclusion in the movie, both in terms of its cast and the story, and how it is a sign of how movies can move forward.\n\n\"That was already in the script, but [director Gina Prince-Bythewood] was going to enhance all of those elements of inclusion and representation that are really going to be, I think, a fundamental and very important part of this industry going forward.\n\n\"And has to be if it wants to survive really, and it wants to engage with audiences. She was somebody who really is able to do that and to create that kind of atmosphere and so I love that part of being in this project.\"\n\nReflecting on her own experiences, Prince-Bythewood told Digital Spy that any movie she makes that \"centre Black women\" are the \"hardest to make\".\n\n\"I feel like I've just been in the sustained fight for 25 years to make these films. I'd like to not have to fight so hard because our stories deserve to be told, and the world needs to see our stories, they need to see us in every genre.\n\n\"And not just consider a film with some Black characters in a Black film. We should be in a Western, we should be in sci-fi, we should be in love stories... Black filmmakers should have the opportunity to tell all types of stories.\n\n\"You know the fact that in 2020, we're still having firsts is sad. It is incredibly sad. But my hope is that in having success with this film that that can open the door and others can get this opportunity.\"\n\nPrince-Bythewood cited Ryan Coogler's impact with Black Panther and how the industry needs \"more of that\" going forward:\n\n\"It changes the dynamic, it changes the storytelling, it changes what it's focused on and again I think that's what the audience needs, that's what Hollywood needs, because that can absolutely change the world.\"\n\nEjiofor's co-star Harry Melling also praised the diversity in The Old Guard, both in the movie and on set.\n\n\"It was wonderful to work on set and to see just how everyone's being represented there and I remember from the off, that was a really important aspect,\" he recalled. \"It was a wonderful thing to be a part of that.\"\n\nMatthias Schoenaerts added that even though The Old Guard is very action-fuelled, it's the diversity and inclusion that adds an extra element to it.\n\n\"It always starts from an emotional place, and the diversity component is definitely something that you feel is a very rich texture to the movie and the project as a whole. That's an element that fuels the enthusiasm that we have through the shooting,\" he said.\n\nPrince-Bythewood also spoke to Digital Spy about how The Old Guard is planned as the start of a trilogy.\n\nThe Old Guard will arrive on Netflix on July 10.\n\nFor more information on how you can support Black Lives Matter, please visit its official website or donate here.
