        "text": "by Cookie N Screen\n\nA little while ago, not many people knew the name of Chiwetel Ejiofor. Especially outside the British Film Industry and even then his name was unknown to audiences everywhere. This is a massive shame because Ejiofor has been an undeniable talent and an incredible actor, conquering the stage in productions as brilliant as Othello. None of this was more clear than his stellar Oscar nominated turn in 12 Years A Slave which saw him happily scoop up the BAFTA for Best Actor this year. Taking the pain and hope of Solomon Northup, a free man sold into slavery, Ejiofor collected plenty of much deserved awards, recognition and hopefully, will continue increasing his status for years to come as one of Britain’s most diverse and impeccable actors.\n\nBut before his career spirals so prolifically, let’s have a look at his other works that you need to watch.\n\nDirty Pretty Things\n\nThis is a powerful drama by Stephen Frears who has achieved critical acclaim for his recent works on Philomena and The Queen. However, the seedy unbelly of London took centre stage for the director as he gives us this incredible and thrilling piece. Exposing the exploitation of immigrants in laborous roles, Ejiofor lead a stellar cast as Okwe, a taxi cab driver and a hotel porter. The hotel he works for freely uses illegal and legal immigrants and degrades them thanks to their desperation. Ejiofor is ingenius as the African man who gets too heavily involved when he finds a human heart in one of the hotel rooms. It’s an absorbing performance.\n\n2012\n\nStarring opposite John Cussack and being one of the most enjoyable things in the movie is no easy fete. The mostly misjudged apocalyptic sci-fi adventure that is much better than The Day After Tomorrow. Set around a now disregarded Mayan prophecy that said the world will end in 2012, Ejiofor is American scientist Adrian Hemsley (who is also a massive fan of the leads work too, because, you know Cussack is a lead.) Hemsley, however, is the guy who figures out what is going on and tries to warn people that impending doom is happening.\n\nChildren of Men\n\nAlfonso Cuaron may have scooped the Best Director Oscar for his film Gravity but many (me) will argue that he should have won or at least be nominated for his dystopian drama The Children of Men. Set where fertility is non-existence, Theo (Clive Owen) is charged by his ex wife to protect the only pregnant woman from terrorist groups and the government. Ejiofor plays Luke, a double agent who is asked to look after them, only to turn on them for political reasons. It is a true magnificent thriller that is a terrifying look into the future. Ejiofor proves his work as a realistic villain.\n\nSerenity\n\nSerenity is the much loved movie from the epic television series Firefly that was cancelled after one season. Since it has become a cult hit, and was developed into a film to wrap up the plots. If you are any sort of geek, you’ll know this film as an agency tracks down River Tam and her brother Simon, killing anyone in their way. Ejiofor was the main antagonist only known as The Operative. Whedon specifically wanted him for the role but studios said no. That is how you know you are an incredible actor when one of the greatest directors of all time specifically asks for you! Ejiofor is terrifying and fun all at the same time. It makes for a master villain."
