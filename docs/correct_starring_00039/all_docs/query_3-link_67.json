        "text": "As soon as I’d heard the song “Cinema” by Benny Benassi I fell in love with it. (Specifically the Skrillex remix, radio edit.) My geeky obsession this year is movies; I haven’t really played many video games. Every time I listened to this song I would think of scenes from 2012. I decided to make a music video with my favourite movies, but soon changed it to my “desert island movies.” (If you’re unfamiliar with this term, it refers to the list of, usually, five movies you would want to have with you if you were stranded on a desert island. Keeping in mind that these are the only five movies I would see for the rest of my life, some of my current favourite movies didn’t make that list; however, I adore them no less.) I only have four currently on that list, and chose three of them for the video. (The one not featured in the video is The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.)\n\n2012 (2009)\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada (2006)\n\nSpider-Man 2 (2004)\n\nOne random fact that I had realised about the video, after I had already started making it, was that each of the three featured movies has an actor from the 1998 film The Impostors (Oliver Platt, Stanley Tucci, and Alfred Molina), which is one of my current favourite movies. So in a sense, there are four movies; three of my desert island movies and one hidden movie I simply adore.\n\nYou may or may not have noticed that for the first couple of months this year I only had two posts. This is because I was stuck in an extended fandom where all I cared about for two months was two movies. I went back-and-forth between watching The Three Musketeers and 2012 over and over again. The longest extended fandom I had was in 2005 — for the entire year I was obsessed with Spider-Man 2 and didn’t care much about anything else. (That, however, is a whole other story deserving its own entry. First, let’s talk about 2012.)\n\nI saw 2012 once after it came out –whether in a theatre or on DVD, I don’t recall– and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love a good doomsday movie. While I don’t find it to be an all-star cast, I recognised many people, even just in more background parts. There were more obvious parts in leading roles such as John Cusack, Danny Glover, and Oliver Platt. Lesser roles such as “the boss from Just Shoot Me” (George Segal), John Billingsley (who played Dr Phlox in Star Trek: Enterprise), and Woody Harrelson. Then, there are the tiny parts that may have had a line or two, or even none at all! “Sheriff Andy from Eureka” (Ty Olsson) had a line on Air Force One, and “King Midas from Once Upon A Time” (Alex Zahara) was part of the bridge crew on Ark 4. (Yes, there were many more from each category, but instead of wasting time listing them all, I’ll just let you consult IMDb for yourself.)\n\nI’m going to skip giving a summary of the movie and go straight to talking about it.\n\nIf you know only one thing about me by now, it’s that I adore movies surrounding “the apocalypse.” Imminent collisions with asteroids (such as Armageddon and Doomsday Rock), atmospheric/Terran catastrophes (such as 2012, Arctic Blast, The Day After Tomorrow and The Core), destruction/zombification by human error (such as I Am Legend and the 2002 movie The Time Machine), and the list just keeps going. I’m not sure why I get so excited about the end of the world, but it’s so fascinating! It really gets my imaginative wheels turning and makes for great stories (whether I write them or not). They also make the best dreams!\n\nThe story of this movie is so much more complex than any B movie. (Hollywood really knows their stuff!) I love how the many individual stories come together by the end (whether or not they make it there alive), including grave mistakes that may end up saving someone, and are all integral to the ultimate survival of humanity. In the end, the good guy wins. (Eat it, Anheuser!)\n\nI’d spent enough time mentally in the world of 2012 that of course I started coming up with fan fiction in my head. Once, I had even set out to write it. I even went so far as to doing research into the history of the character I’d created. (Not only did it help me figure out who she was exactly, but it also helped perfect her story from the lame one I’d had originally.) However, after only writing a tiny bit of it I was done. I’ll leave the fanfic to the ones who are still allowed to write. (I happened across a 2012 fanfic called “The Last Day of the Cruise Ship” which I’m looking forward to reading.)\n\nKeep up the good work, movie makers. 2012 is one film that made this moviegoer very happy. Putting out more movies like this one sure wouldn’t disappoint me.\n\nAll screenshots by lilyZ at FanPop.com."
