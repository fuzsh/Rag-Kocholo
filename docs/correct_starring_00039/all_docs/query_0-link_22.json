        "text": "If the world was collapsing tomorrow, the land was sinking into the sea and if the fate of 6.79 billion people was hanging in the balance, who would you want in charge? Well, according to the makers of 2012, a new mega-budget disaster movie, we’d all turn to Chiwetel Ejiofor. For the 35-year-old East London-born actor plays the movie’s brain-box hero and White House scientific advisor Adrian Helmsley — the only man who can provide explanations, who is aware of the solution, who can stare at a piece of graph paper and say, straight-faced: “For the first time ever the neutrinos are causing a physical reaction.”\n\nIt’s a smart casting choice by the film’s director Roland Emmerich, master of the “if-it-ain’t-broke-demolish-it” school of disaster"
