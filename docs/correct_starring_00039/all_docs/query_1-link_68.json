It’s based on the Walter Tevis novel of the same name, which inspired a 1976 film starring glam rocker David Bowie in the title role.\n\nMore from TVLine\n\nFrasier Revival Eyed at Paramount+\n\nPatrick Stewart and Stephen Colbert Greet Paramount+'s New 'Residents' in Super Bowl Ad — Watch It Here\n\nYellowstone Prequel Series in the Works at Paramount+ -- Plus, Get Your First Taste of Its Deadly Tone\n\n“Chiwetel Ejiofor’s stage and film career are staggering in their bravery, commitment and quality,” co-showrunners and executive producers Alex Kurtzman and Jenny Lumet (Star Trek: Discovery, Clarice) said in a statement. “He’s everything we could imagine and a million things we can’t. We couldn’t be more thrilled.”\n\nEjiofor is primarily known for his film work, particularly for playing kidnapped and enslaved Black man Solomon Northup in the 2013 film 12 Years a Slave, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. His other major film roles include Doctor Strange, The Martian and 2012. But he has also appeared on the small screen in a number of British crime dramas like Trust, Dancing on the Edge and The Shadow Line.\n\nBest of TVLine\n\nTV Roles Recast: 25+ Times a Show Changed Actors Midstream (and Why)\n\nStars Who Almost Played Other TV Roles — on Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, Lost, Gilmore Girls, Friends and Other Shows\n\nTV Stars Almost Cast in Other Roles"
