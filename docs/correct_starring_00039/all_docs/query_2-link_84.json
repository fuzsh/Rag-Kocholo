        "text": "Who might make the final cut when this year's Bafta film nominations are revealed on Wednesday morning?\n\nIf previous years are anything to go by, Hollywood heavyweights will rub shoulders with the cream of British talent on the Bafta red carpet at the Royal Opera House next month.\n\nLikely to appear among the nominees in the best film category are space thriller Gravity and harrowing drama 12 Years a Slave, both of which have featured heavily on awards tipsheets for several months.\n\n\"The lovely thing about Gravity,\" says film critic Mark Kermode, \"is that it has Hollywood stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and is directed by Alfonso Cuaron, but it relies on British talent. It was shot at Shepperton and Pinewood and the extraordinary effects work was done by Framestore, a London company.\n\n\"You can think of it as a very British movie.\"\n\nOther best film hopefuls include Saving Mr Banks, about the making of Disney's Mary Poppins, Somali piracy thriller Captain Phillips, and Philomena, based on the true story of an Irish woman trying to find the son she was forced to give up for adoption.\n\nSome 275 films have been entered this year for consideration by more than 6,500 Bafta members. The first round of voting closed last Friday, and the second round commences once the nominations are announced.\n\nThis year, there will be six - rather than five - nominations for outstanding British film. The trophy was taken last year by the James Bond film Skyfall.\n\nIt would be a surprise if Stephen Frears' Philomena, starring Dame Judi Dench, didn't appear on this shortlist, and other contenders could include Gravity and Saving Mr Banks, both of which qualify as British films.\n\nAmerican film producer Harvey Weinstein, who is promoting Philomena on this year's awards circuit, says he expects the film to get a nomination, but worries that Frears may miss out in the director category because the film's \"not as flashy\" as some others.\n\nFrears, previously Bafta-nominated for Dangerous Liaisons and The Queen, \"is one of England's greatest directors,\" says Weinstein. \"He deserves to be recognised.\"\n\nThe Hollywood producer adds it's been \"a fabulous year for British movies\" with the release of Philomena, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom [both Weinstein films], 12 Years a Slave and Saving Mr Banks.\n\nBut with a short voting cycle this year, he says Bafta's members will not have time to see all the eligible films, meaning critics \"will have more influence\".\n\n\"My hope is that Bafta and the Academy discover the gems themselves and they don't have a kneejerk reaction to the critics,\" he adds.\n\nOther independent films that could make the cut include Dexter Fletcher's romantic musical Sunshine on Leith, featuring the songs of The Proclaimers; and Filth, which stars James McAvoy as a corrupt police officer.\n\nKermode has hopes for The Selfish Giant, Clio Barnard's story of two young boys growing up in an underprivileged town in Yorkshire, which he describes as \"a really terrific piece of work\".\n\nHis own favourite film of 2013 was Good Vibrations, the story of Terri Hooley, Northern Ireland's punk godfather, who opened up a record shop in the midst of the \"troubles\" in 1970s Belfast.\n\n\"It would be nice to see that nominated but I don't think it got seen by as many people as it ought to have done,\" says Kermode.\n\nAlso submitted for consideration as outstanding British film are motor racing drama Rush; vampire fantasy Byzantium; Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom; the yet-to-be-released dance comedy Cuban Fury, starring Nick Frost and Rashida Jones; and The Invisible Woman, directed by and starring Ralph Fiennes as Charles Dickens.\n\nIn the acting categories, expect to see British stars Dame Judi Dench (Philomena) and Emma Thompson (Saving Mr Banks) up against Blue Jasmine's Cate Blanchett for best actress. And will Kate Winslet make it onto the list for her role in Labor Day?\n\nThis year will see Bafta recognising five films in the documentary category, rather than the usual three.\n\nAmong the hopefuls are The Act of Killing, Blackfish, Cutie and the Boxer and Pussy Riot - A Punk Prayer. And could Morgan Spurlock's pop doc One Direction: This Is Us also step into the Bafta spotlight?\n\n\"It's been a year of great diversity,\" says Kermode. \"Any year where you've got the blockbusters like Gravity and then 12 Years a Slave or something like The Selfish Giant is a very good year.\"\n\nThe EE British Academy Film Awards take place on Sunday 16 February at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden. Stephen Fry returns as host and the ceremony will be broadcast on BBC One.\n\nThe full list of nominations will be announced by actors Luke Evans and Helen McCrory at 0735 GMT on Wednesday 8 January. It will be streamed live on the Bafta website, external and on the BBC News website.\n\nWith additional reporting by Sarah-Jane Griffiths"
