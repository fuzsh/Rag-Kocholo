        "text": "Actor Chiwetel Ejiofor poses for a portrait during the 2006 Film Festival on January 21, 2006 in Park City, Utah.\n\nThe actor, born to Nigerian parents in London, is an Academy Award Best Actor nominee for his latest film, \"12 Years a Slave.\"\n\nBy CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan\n\n\"Amistad\"\n\nWhile studying at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts, he received a call for an audition for his first major film role, Steven Spielberg's \"Amistad.\"\n\n\"Right before a choir class I got the note to call my agent. These were the days before mobile phones!\" he told correspondent Lee Cowan. \"Traditionally, I don't think they really allow people to audition so much whilst you're still at the school. This was an exception because it was Spielberg and because it was this kind of historical epic, which people recognized [as] a real opportunity. I think that they normally sort of narrow it down so people aren't constantly skipping off to do a television job or a small theatre gig and then try to come back to school and so on, which would just disrupt the whole idea of it. But I think also they didn't expect anybody to get the part! So they allowed me and a couple of other people to go along and audition.\"\n\n\"Amistad\"\n\n\"I was amazed,\" he said of his first major film. \"But when you're young - I guess I was 19 - there's a kind of precociousness that you have. It's all a surprise, and it's all kind of amazing. But also you think, 'Well, maybe this kind of thing just happens!' Like, you don't quite put it within all of its context until you're much older.\"\n\nFilm, he said, hadn't been on his radar as an actor: \"The only plan I had was to be a theatre actor. I loved films actually, but I never saw myself in films, in cinema somehow. It felt very removed. It felt thousands of miles away.\"\n\n\"Dirty Pretty Things\"\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor as a Nigerian doctor in London, with Audrey Tautou (\"Amelie\"), in the 2002 thriller, \"Dirty Pretty Things.\"\n\nEjiofor said his experience filming \"Dirty Pretty Things,\" and working with director Stephen Frears (\"The Grifters\"), hooked him on movies:\n\n\"I became very excited to learn about films and to really discover filmmaking and the artistry of all of it -- this really amazing director, who took me on when I was 24 playing 35, even though he didn't quite know that, 'cause I slightly fudged that a little bit!\" Ejiofor laughed. \"A little bit, but not much. He found out later.\"\n\n\"Love Actually\"\n\nIn \"Love Actually\" (2003), Richard Curtis' omnibus film set at Christmas time, Chiwetel Ejiofor played the husband of Keira Knightley.\n\n\"Do you still find people coming up to you around Christmas time and recognizing you from 'Love Actually'?\" asked Cowan.\n\n\"I do, yeah,\" he laughed. \"In fact, that's how I know it's Christmas. That's how I know it's time for me to think about my shopping, is when people start meeting me, like, on the street and talking about 'Love Actually'!\"\n\n\"Melinda and Melinda\"\n\nRadha Mitchell and Chiwetel Ejiofor in Woody Allen's \"Melinda and Melinda.\"\n\n\"In theatre,\" said Ejiofor, \"even though it is incredibly inclusive in the room, there's always the distance of the fourth wall, the distance of stagecraft, of having to maintain your voice over a certain number of days or months, weeks, knowing that you have to go down stage left at a certain point, otherwise that side of the house can't see and that light can't reach - there's always those things going on. They create a sense of distance with an audience and with the performance itself.\n\n\"And there was something in film I [became] very aware of, how the removal of all that craft is really interesting. Just having a kind of raw entity and feeling your own humanity in front of a camera is a completely different way of being, as an actor, and very freeing.\"\n\n\"Melinda and Melinda\"\n\nAmanda Peet, Radha Mitchell, Woody Allen, Chiwetel Ejofor and Chloe Sevigny arrive at the Kursaal Palace during the first day of 52nd San Sebastian International Film Festival on September 17, 2004 in San Sebastian, Spain.\n\n\"Four Brothers\"\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor as crime boss Victor Sweet in the 2005 drama, \"Four Brothers.\"\n\n\"Serenity\"\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor as an Alliance operative in \"Serenity\" (2005), Joss Whedon's big-screen adaptation of his cult sci-fi series, \"Firefly.\"\n\n\"You've done a fair amount of science-fiction stuff - 'Children of Men, 'Serenity,'\" said Cowan. \"Do you like doing that kind of stuff?\"\n\n\"I do like it, yeah,\" said Ejiofor, adding, \"It's never about genre for me. It's always about character.\n\n\"There was a time when I was first approaching '12 Years a Slave,' that it had that 'Alice in Wonderland' feeling, the slip down the rabbit hole into a kind of surreal universe. It had that idea that you could easily transplant the themes of the story and set them on Mars and have a kind of science-fiction story that was all about somebody being removed to another place, you know? Genre's always so interchangeable.\"\n\n\"Kinky Boots\"\n\nIn the 2005 \"Kinky Boots\" (inspiration for the current Broadway musical), Chiwetel Ejiofor played a drag queen who helps turn around a struggling factory show manufacturer.\n\n\"Kinky Boots\"\n\nCowan asked if the role in \"Kinky Boots\" was \"a bit of a risk\"?\n\n\"Not really,\" Ejiofor replied. \"When I read 'Kinky Boots' I just was desperate to play the part. I just thought it was brilliant. It was heart-breaking. It was a beautiful character. I thought there was so much that I was going to learn on that job, so many places that I was going to try to reach that not having a part like that, I wouldn't have had access to.\"\n\n\"Inside Man\"\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor and Denzel Washington in the thriller, \"Inside Man.\"\n\n\"Children of Men\"\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor starred with Clive Owen in Alfonso Cuaron's dystopian future tale, \"Children of Men.\"\n\n\"Children of Men\"\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor, Charlie Hunnam, director Alfonso Cuaron, Clare-Hope Ashitey and Clive Owen pose at the premiere of \"Children of Men\" at the Village Theater on November 16, 2006 in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\"Talk to Me\"\n\nDon Cheadle and Chiwetel Ejiofor in \"Talk to Me\" (2007).\n\n\"Talk to Me\"\n\nTaraji P.
