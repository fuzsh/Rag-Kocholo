        "text": "2012 - Day after Tomorrow on Steroids !!\n\nEOTW (End of the World) movies have come a long way since On The Beach by Neville Shute. I thoroughly enjoyed Day After Tomorrow (DAT) and 2012 was done by, basically, the same people which prompted me to buy it. While the personal drama between the characters is not as deep or as complex as that developed in DAT, the special effects more than compensate for this loss.I DO wish they had included English subtitles for the dialog that took place in Chinese, Indian and and a couple of other languages. Also, unlike DAT the science involved was somewhat more sketchy - connate water, for example, would NOT be clear and pretty as the stuff seen bubbling in the capped well at the bottom of the mine in India was. The geology crowd must have been laughing their butts off. One a more cosmic sense the movie raises questions about the following: our government, what we really get told by the media, the nature of the human species, and what we ( I, you etc.) do as individuals each day. Definitely worth watching... probably 2 or 3 times.Read full review\n\nSplendid Story You Cared About In This Apocalyptic Film\n\nThe film starts in the then present year 2009. American geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) travels to India to meet his friend Satnam, who has discovered that neutrinos from a massive solar flare have penetrated the Earth and are causing the temperature of earth's core to increase rapidly. Adrian returns to Washington D.C. to inform White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) and US President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) that this will soon culminate in a chain of events that will bring mass destruction to the earth's crust, which, in turn will snuff out man completely. After attending the 36th G8 summit in 2010, other heads of state and heads of government are made aware of the situation. They collaborate on their efforts on a secret project intended to ensure the continuity of human life, strategically choosing 400,000 people for admission on a series of gigantic ships (called arks) soon to be secretly constructed in the Himalayas. To help fund the venture, additional individuals are allowed to purchase tickets for a billion euro-dollars each. Roland Emmerich really knows how to connect the audience with the characters in this film. We even seem to care for the oddball character that Woody Harrelson plays at the Yosemite National Park, Charlie Frost. Charlie comments upon the crest, \"This marks the last day of the United States of America. And, by tomorrow, all of mankind. And we will be visible from the Milky Way as a tiny little puff of smoke. I'm watching the earth crumble before my eyes. The giant ash cloud created by this super-volcano will first envelop Vegas and then St. Louis and then Chicago and then, at long last, Washington, D.C. will have its lights go out!\" I was indeed not disappointed when I finally saw this at the movie theater even still a month after it was released to DVD. Viewing on the big screen gives you a much greater perspective about the total annihilation of the planet on the large screen. Some would argue that the film was presented over the top, but Roland wanted to make the biggest disaster film of all and said since it would be his last, that he wanted the film to be the biggest. Much humor was used in making this film thrown in with a sense of irony and even surprise. The subtle nuances of total secrecy, unfairness, and self preserving greed were used perfectly to play on your inner anger and extreme imaginings of conspiracy theories you find hard to swallow, yet with 2012, you can see now why anything is possible and believable first hand. John Cusack was just likable enough to believe that indeed he could get swallowed up by a crack and climb out of it. We also had a sense of satisfaction several times along the way and at the end when the story-line turns a twist and decides that death should indeed befall certain people that we may a may not have liked our even related to. This is not a children movie at all and I would not even recommend traumatizing your child with all this calamity. Even adults sometime have a hard time dealing with this sort of subject, yet most are willing to watch this kind of genre with a bit of unbelief, but still wish to know what might be the worst way for mankind to perish. The whole psychology of apocalyptic films drive us either away from our beliefs or toward them. Some may say \"So what\" and some may say \"Oh No\". Regardless, it's always best, in my opinion, to face your fears at any cost. IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEW, PLEASE VOTE.Read full review"
