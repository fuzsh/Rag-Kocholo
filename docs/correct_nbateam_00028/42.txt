2008: Boston Celtics

The 2007-08 season saw the Boston Celtics generate a shift in the NBA landscape when they added Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen to a team that also sported perennial All-Star Paul Pierce. Finishing last in the East in 2007, Boston went from the bottom of the barrel to NBA Champions within 12 months - Allen was crucial to that success.

Through Boston's 66-win season, Allen was the third-leading scorer for the team. He averaged 17.4 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 3.1 assists on 44.5% from the field and 39.8% from three on 2.5 made per game. While Allen was no longer the focal point of his team's offense, he should that he remained of the league's most efficient scorers.

Allen was named an All-Star for the 2007-08 NBA season before going on to win his first NBA title in his first season with the Celtics. His numbers dropped in the post-season, just 15.6 points per game on 42.8% from the field and 39.6% from three, but his position as an All-Star level role player earned him his first ring and set a new precedent for how NBA teams would create their ideal roster.

2013: Miami Heat

After five seasons with the Boston Celtics, where he reached the NBA Finals twice, Allen made the controversial move to join their Eastern Conference rival Miami Heat. While Boston fans and teammates didn't appreciate his relocation, Allen's move to the reigning NBA Champions proved excellent for his career aspirations. Now 37 years old, Allen would lend his shooting prowess to the near-unstoppable trio of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh.

Despite being the second-oldest player on the Heat, beaten only by 39-year-old Juwan Howard, Allen was Miami's fourth-leading scorer, averaging 10.9 points per game on 44.9% from the field and 41.9% from three-point range. His production and consistency were crucial to Miami's success, playing in 79 of 82 possible regular season games at 37 - more than any of Miami's big three players.

While Allen didn't receive any individual awards through the 2012-13 NBA season, he did cap off the season with his second and last NBA Championship ring. Facing the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals, Allen's clutch three off a Bosh offensive rebound to tie Game 6 will always be remembered as the turning point that helped push Miami to their second NBA title.

Comparing Ray Allen's Rings to the Winningest Players in NBA History

Ray Allen stands among an elite group of players with two NBA Championship rings to his name. However, as he earned his titles late in his career, Allen failed to make a Championship run as the star player.

Ray Allen's two rings are considered modest compared to some of the winningest players in NBA history. Never one of the NBA's most dominant individual talents, Allen earned his championship as a role player amongst other great players.

Ray Allen's NBA Finals Appearances Compared to NBA Legends

Ray Allen reached the NBA Finals four times in his career. Twice with the Boston Celtics and twice with the Miami Heat. He split all four Finals series with the Celtics and Heat, resulting in his two NBA Championships.

Allen was a key contributor for both the Celtics and Heat, fulfilling his role as a designated marksman. With the Celtics, he lost in the Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers and Kobe Bryant - his fellow 1996 NBA Draft member who earned his fifth title. And with the Heat, they lost their Finals rematch with the San Antonio Spurs 4-1.
