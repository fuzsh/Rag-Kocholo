        "text": "Ray Allen felt right at home in Milwaukee on Friday night, though the city looks a lot different from when he played for the Bucks over two decades ago.\n\nBefore attending the Bucks' game against the Memphis Grizzlies at Fiserv Forum, in which the team distributed 10,000 bobbleheads of his likeness, Allen cruised around the place where he lived after joining the Bucks in a draft-day trade in 1996 until his franchise-altering deal to the Seattle SuperSonics in 2003.\n\nAllen had some food at Sweet Diner in the Third Ward, though he waxed nostalgic about hanging out at Ma Fischer's after bowling at Landmark Lanes on the East Side. Allen even swung by his old house in Mequon and surprised the current residents by knocking on the door.\n\n\"It’s amazing,\" Allen said before the game. \"My only regret is that I didn’t do it sooner. Because this place, it raised me. Still have good friends here. My family lived here. My extended family lived there for some time after I left.\"\n\nThe biggest difference for Allen, of course, is that the Bucks no longer play in the Bradley Center. He retired after the 2013-14 season, also playing for the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat, so he never got the chance to play at Fiserv Forum, which opened in 2018.\n\n\"I give huge credit to this organization,\" Allen said. \"How (the new owners) came in, I don’t know the first year when they came in, but there was a plan.\n\n\"Building this building, like, revitalizing this part of downtown, you just see it. If you build it, they’ll come. Now the apartment buildings, growing and getting built. You see a lot of people utilizing the downtown. It was very quiet when we were here. You would come in, a couple things here and there, but now you see more people. There’s more cars, there’s more restaurants.\n\n\"Having a viable sports franchise in the city like it is ... I think about Seattle and what happens when you lose it (when the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City). But here, they turned it up. And then you win the championship (in 2021) and what that brings is more people move to the city of Milwaukee. The economy is sprawling and growing.\"\n\nThe Bucks game had a familiar feel for Allen, with the team wearing the purple, 1990s-era jerseys. He also kicked off the pregame throwback video that included a couple highlights of his sweet-shooting younger self.\n\nMore: With No. 1 seed secured, Bucks play only reserves in loss to the Memphis Grizzlies at Fiserv Forum\n\nAllen, though, didn't get to see his old No. 34 jersey in action with Giannis Antetokounmpo sitting out the game after the Bucks already locked up the No. 1 overall seed in the playoffs. Antetokounmpo reminds Allen of a former running mate who is now on the Milwaukee coaching staff.\n\n\"Vin Baker, he had a game that was dominant like that on the block,\" Allen said \"He didn’t handle the ball as much in transition, facing the basket. But he was that type of player.\n\n\"And the game was different back then. I believe that if Vin played in the game today, he would have developed along those same type of lines. Vin was so dominant. Giannis, he has a great motor and you can tell he’s not stuck on what he’s done. He’s constantly evolving and trying to get better.\"\n\nThere's no hard feelings for Allen that his jersey isn't hanging in the rafters. Allen scored 9,681 points for the Bucks, and he helped lead Milwaukee to the Eastern Conference finals in 2001 alongside Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell. That era came to an abrupt end when Allen was traded two years later, and Milwaukee didn't get past the first round of the NBA playoffs until the 2018-19 season.\n\n“It’s been interesting, because the places that I’ve been, including college, people have worn my uniform, my jersey afterwards,\" Allen said. \"I guess my ego isn’t big enough to warrant some type of emotion or sadness or whatever people may assume or feel.\n\n\"Getting your jersey retired is a big deal. But I think it’s always about the people you played in front of and how you made them feel.\"\n\nAllen, who lives in Miami, was acknowledged by the crowd in the second quarter. There was no lingering ill will about the trade that abruptly ended Allen's time in Milwaukee. He was just happy to be back and basking in the ovation of the crowd.\n\n\"Coming in this building, coming back to Milwaukee, just brought me peace,\" Allen said during a Bally Sports TV interview before the game.\n\nMore: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's scoring with the Milwaukee Bucks, by the numbers"
