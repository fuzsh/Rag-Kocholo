        "text": "PISTONS: Larry Brown's agent and Detroit president of basketball operations Joe Dumars spoke about the coach's future with the team, but did not reach a resolution.\n\n''When Ray became a free agent and had chance to explore opportunities, we were able to report back to the Sonics on what the market was dictating and they essentially responded accordingly,'' Babby said during a conference call. ''We tried to get it done over these many months, but both sides needed verification from the marketplace.''\n\nSeattle spokesman Marc Moquin said the team couldn't comment on the agreement.\n\nAllen's contract expired at midnight last Friday, and the response from other teams was swift. Babby said when he got into his office that morning, his voice mail was full of messages from interested suitors.\n\nThat day, Babby and Allen held conference calls with interested teams in Babby's Washington, D.C. office. Some of the teams had room under the salary cap, while others were seeking possible sign-and-trade options.\n\n''It was a tremendous amount of interest,'' Babby said. ''It was gratifying to Ray in the sense of where he stood.''\n\nThe pair then went back to the Sonics.\n\nAllen earned about $14 million last season, and Seattle could have given him a maximum $97 million, five-year extension. The two sides tried to negotiate a new deal during the regular season, and started talks again after the playoffs.\n\n''Joe Glass and I have started talking about Larry's situation and we are continuing to discuss the matter,'' Dumars said in a statement released by the team. ''As of right now there is nothing new to report.''\n\nGlass told The Associated Press he did not have another conversation scheduled with Dumars.\n\n''There's no timeframe on when we're going to talk again,'' Glass said in a telephone interview from his office in New York."
