        "text": "Turn off your mind and suspend reality; forget about how the relationship between Ray Allen and the Boston Celtics ended. Instead, for SB Nation's Theme Day \"Bring Back a Player,\" consider the state of the Celtics and the team's main position of need: shooting guard. When I look at this squad, I see a lot of young potential at power forward and center, a star point guard, and a potential star at small forward; but I don't see any top-end talent at shooting guard.\n\nSo, what former Celtics player would I love to see them bring back in their prime?\n\nRay Allen.\n\nThere have been a lot of great two-guards in Celtics history but Ray Allen's style of play would fit perfectly with this year's team. Allen is obviously one of the greatest three-point shooters ever and he proved that as a Celtic, breaking Reggie Miller's three-point record in 2011. Not to mention the fact he hit countless jaw-dropping game-winning jump shots.\n\nThe shot that always pops up in my mind is the one versus the Charlotte Bobcats from early in the 2007 season. The way the play happened is imprinted in my memory. The inbounds pass was totally botched and the ball bounced high in the air, but somehow the ball finds it's way to Ray and he drains it. And of course Mike Gorman's call on the play makes it even better.\n\nIt feels great to wallow in nostalgia, doesn't it?\n\nAnyway, as incredible as Ray Allen was with the C's, he was even more dynamic with both the Milwaukee Bucks and Seattle SuperSonics. In his prime Allen was very much overlooked on the East Coast, but he was one of the best players out West. Allen had the ability to put the ball on the floor and pull up from anywhere. He was an underrated defender and was a terrific teammate, passing the ball at a high-rate.\n\nWith the Celtics he primarily came off of screens or roamed and found the sweet spot, but if Allen were a Celtic in his prime, he'd give the team a legitimate number one scorer, opening things up for the rest of the team.\n\nWith a young frontcourt this roster would still have it's struggles depending on the opponent, but more often than not, a backcourt of Rajon Rondo, Ray Allen in his prime, and Jeff Green would be an incredibly tough matchup.\n\nIf this fantasy were a reality, I believe we'd be talking about the Boston Celtics as potential contenders this season.\n\nWould you bring Ray Allen in his prime back to the Celtics? Would you bring him back now? Let me know in the comments below!"
