        "text": "Ray Allen was a shooting guard who helped the United States win gold in basketball at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He played in college at the University of Connecticut and was a first-round draft choice (fifth overall) of the Minnesota Timberwolves in 1996. His #34 was retired by the University of Connecticut.\n\nAllen’s NBA career lasted from 1996-2014, starting with the Milwaukee Bucks from 1996-2003, then the Seattle Sonics from 2003-07, the Boston Celtics from 2007-12, and the Miami Heat from 2012-14. He won NBA titles in 2008 with the Celtics and 2013 with the Heat. He was a 10-time NBA All-Star (2000-02, 2004-09, 2011), and was named second team All-NBA in 2005. He also received the NBA Sportsmanship Award in 2003.\n\nAllen was considered one of the greatest pure shooters ever, averaging .400 for 3-point attempts during his NBA career. For many years, he was the career leader in 3-point shots made, until his mark was bettered by Stephen Curry. His 2005/06 season mark of 269 3-pointers was a record at the time and is the only season before 2010 in the top 25 all-time (as of 2023), but was later surpassed due to the proliferation of 3-point attempts in the new modern style of basketball. Allen won the NBA 3-point Contest in 2001, and for his NBA career he averaged 18.9 ppg, and 3.4 assists/game.\n\nAfter his NBA career, Allen went into acting, appearing in several movies and commercials. He was named an NBA Spokesperson for the Jr. NBA / Jr. WNBA program and was selected as an NBA Spokesman for the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. He was appointed by President Obama to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council and has been a supporter of the Holocaust Memorial Museum. In August 2017, he penned a first-person article for The Players’ Tribune, entitled “Why I Went to Auschwitz”. He has also been a spokesman for the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and he and his wife started the Ray of Hope Foundation to assist charitable organizations."
