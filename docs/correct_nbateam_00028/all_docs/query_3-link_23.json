        "text": "The Milwaukee Bucks have had their ups and downs as a franchise, but a few players have etched their names in the team’s history. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Giannis Antetokounmpo can be considered the greatest to ever wear a Bucks uniform, given that they delivered a chip.\n\nRay Allen’s career night for the Bucks\n\nAfter Abdul-Jabbar’s departure, the Bucks remained a lower-tier team for a long time. However, that trend started changing with Ray Allen’s arrival. He was picked by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1996 draft but got traded to the Bucks before beginning the season. He had a couple of seasons to settle in, after which his athleticism and skill earned him All-Star recognition during the 1999-00 season.\n\nThe following year he furthered his growth, enabling the Bucks to a 50-win season after around 14 years. His best performance for the Bucks came that year when he dropped 43 points against the Utah Jazz – shooting 60.9% from the field and 57.1% from deep. Allen was on fire that night, dropping 30 points in the first half.\n\n“That first half was the best half of basketball I’ve ever had,” Allen told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel back then.\n\nAllen’s stint with the Milwaukee Bucks\n\nAlthough Allen could not deliver a chip to the Bucks franchise, he brought hope. He played six complete seasons for the franchise and took them to the playoffs in three of them. Allen was named an All-Star in three of those seasons, representing the team among the best players in the league."
