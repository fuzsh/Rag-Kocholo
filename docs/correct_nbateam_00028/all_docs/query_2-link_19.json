        "text": "While Ray Allen hasn’t played a minute in the NBA for more than two seasons, he just made his retirement official earlier this week. Thus, now is the time for us to reflect upon Allen’s game and his place in history. What was he doing on the court that was so special? Who in history has shared elements of his approach? What innovations did he bring to the table that were unique to him? And finally, what might we realistically expect the impact to look like, in a historic since, for a player that combines all of the elements that Ray Allen displayed in the NBA for two decades?\n\nIf you’re talking about Ray Allen, then obviously you have to start with that shot. That beautiful, perfect, absolutely lethal shot. I remember a commercial from years ago, when Ray said something along the lines of, “When my shot is on…it is ON.” And that sums it up perfectly.\n\nRay Allen was the first player that I ever saw use the 3-pointer as a weapon to the extent that he did. He volume-shot treys in a way that helped make jump shooters some of the most efficient shooters in the NBA. It used to be canon that a big man shooting near the rim was the most efficient shot that you could get in basketball, and offenses were therefore usually built from the inside out. However, as analytics and the Golden State Warriors of today will tell you, offenses built around volume 3-point shooters from the outside-in have made the center-out model obsolete. And a lot of that is due to one Ray Allen.\n\nBecause Ray didn’t just shoot a lot of 3s…he actually made them at a clip that was rarely if ever seen. When Ray got an open look from downtown, be it off the spot-up, moving off of a screen, or even off the dribble, if it was open it was a bucket. Or at least, that’s how it felt. And his percentages bore that out…Ray made percentages from behind the line that some volume scorers struggled to shoot from inside the line.\n\nThus, Allen was able to be a unique type of best player on contending teams. Ray had a good all-around game, as a shooting guard that could handle the ball well enough to run the offense for extended stretches in both Milwaukee and Seattle. He was athletic enough to finish reasonably around the rim and grab a solid share of rebounds from the backcourt. People forget that Ray was once in the Slam Dunk contest, that he had hops like that.\n\nBut while he was a very good all-around player, Ray was neither a point guard (like Oscar Robertson or Magic Johnson) nor was he an athletic monster on the wing (like Julius Erving, Michael Jordan or his peer Kobe Bryant). No, he was something different.\n\nThe historical comp that most obviously fits Ray Allen is Reggie Miller. Or perhaps, Reggie Miller with just a hint of Jerry West mixed in.\n\nIn the generation before Ray, Reggie had first shown how a team built around a 3-point shooting marksman could aspire to contend for championships. This space is more about styles and mechanisms than numbers (though a numerical comparison between the two would be fun, wouldn’t it…hmmm…), and mechanistically there were a lot of similarities between Reggie and Ray.\n\nThere was the obvious dead-eye shooting, at volume, from behind-the-arc. There was the way that both were so lethal off of screens that their teams would often set plays where bringing them off screens for a trey was plan A and, if that didn’t work, they’d just run them off more screens to get them a trey as plan B (or C, if it came to it).\n\nThere was also the propensity of both to be MEGA clutch. Reggie built a huge part of his identity and legacy around his big-shot heroics, especially as they pertained to the New York Knicks in the playoffs. And the way that he could scale his scoring average up from the regular season to the playoffs while maintaining his mega efficiency was truly superb. But Ray had (more than) his own share of big shots. When sites started measuring crunch-time stats or game-winning shots, Ray was always near the top of the list. And who can forget his crazy 3-pointer in the 2013 Finals that saved the Heat season and let to their championship? And this was at the very END of Ray’s career.\n\nBut, there were also clear differences between Reggie and Ray. Reggie was the long-distance-version of the epitome of the shooting guard from the pre-Jordan era. His primary job was to SHOOT. Reggie didn’t handle the ball a lot, he didn’t rebound, he wasn’t much of a defender…his job was to shoot. He was, therefore, the leading scorer on his team while operating almost entirely off the ball. His very presence on the court, running off picks, had a great spacing impact that opened up the court for his teammates, but he wasn’t often the one directly creating the shots.\n\nRay, on the other hand, was the long-distance-version of the epitome of the shooting guard from the post-Jordan era. His primary job was to shoot…but he also was expected to be able to run the offense, to be able to create his own shot off the dribble, to help out on the glass on occasion. That’s why I say that Ray was like Reggie with a hint of Jerry West mixed in, because he was a mega off-ball threat but he also created more for both himself and his teammates off the dribble. In fact, Ray’s ability to create and make high-efficiency 3-pointers off the dribble while in Milwaukee and Seattle was one of his more unique innovations to the game. In a way, even though he nominally plays point guard, Stephen Curry is more the evolutionary version of Ray Allen than he is any other player.\n\nBut while Reggie Miller was his best historical comp, there was a player drafted the same year as Ray that he would consider to be his contemporary rival…\n\nRay Allen was the fifth pick in the 1996 NBA draft out of UConn, while Kobe was the 13th pick in the same draft out of high school. They were both destined for Hall of Fame careers while playing the same position, so some level of rivalry is natural. But there were persistent reports that the two of them just genuinely didn’t like each other. That always makes a rivalry more interesting.\n\nIn general, Kobe was seemingly the better player. He accumulated more impressive box score stats and accolades, measured out with a higher impact, and won more titles. Kobe was one of (the?) face(s) of his generation of the NBA. Ray wasn’t. So, by most measures, Kobe won.\n\nBut Ray was never one to back down. Immediately prior to the 2008 NBA Finals, Ray held his own in head-to-heads with Kobe (sorry, gotta toss a few numbers in here):\n\nKobe vs. Allen (28 games)\n\nAllen - 20.6 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 5.1 apg, 1.5 spg, 43.4% FG, 91.4% FT, 2.5 TOs\n\nKobe - 23.6 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 4.6 apg, 1.3 spg, 42.8% FG, 82.3% FT, 2.6 TOs\n\nAnd of course, Ray and Kobe were the starting shooting guards that faced each other in the 2008 and 2010 NBA Finals, their teams splitting the rings in two epic match-ups.\n\nConclusions\n\nRay Allen retires as one of the most unique, influential shooting guards in NBA history. He took the ultimate shooter torch from Reggie Miller and passed it to Stephen Curry, went head-to-head and held his own with the greatest shooting guard of his generation, and oh by-the-way earned the name Jesus Shuttlesworth and made out with Rosario Dawson and two porn stars in a Spike Lee movie. He had success as “the Man” in Milwaukee and Seattle, he won a title (and came a smidge of age/injury short of another) as a main lieutenant in Boston, and he rode off into the twilight as the ultra-clutch veteran shooter that earned LeBron James his second ring in Miami.\n\nSugar Ray Allen is in the argument for greatest shooter of all-time, and is a shoe-in Hall of Famer. Not bad, Ray. Not bad at all.\n\nRelated articles\n\nMechanisms of greatness: Scouting Kevin Garnett’s defense\n\nMechanisms of greatness: Scouting Kevin Garnett’s offense at his peak\n\nA legend hangs up the Spurs: Part 1 of Duncan’s career perspective\n\nMechanisms of greatness: Part 2 of Duncan’s career perspective\n\nMechanisms of greatness: Kobe Bryant’s career perspective"
