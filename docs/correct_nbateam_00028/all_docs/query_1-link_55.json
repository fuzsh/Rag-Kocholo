        "text": "It's not an everyday occurrence that a two-time NBA champion speaks to fans in Tokyo.\n\nWhich is why Ray Allen's promotional visit to the Japanese capital was a rare treat for basketball aficionados who got to hear his perspective on the sport ― and soak up his knowledge on improving as a player, too.\n\nAllen appeared in exactly 1,300 NBA regular-season games in a successful career that spanned from 1996 to 2014. Along the way, he played for the Milwaukee Bucks, Seattle SuperSonics, Boston Celtics and Miami Heat, winning NBA Finals titles with the Celtics in 2008 and Heat in 2013.\n\nAn exact replica of the NBA Finals trophy, officially known as the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy, accompanied Allen on his goodwill visit to Tokyo, which included a stop at the Japan men's national team's training camp on Friday, June 14.\n\nAdvice for Japan's National Team\n\nDuring his visit to watch a Japan men's national team practice session on Friday, Allen issued a challenge to head coach Tom Hovasse's players as they prepare for tuneup games before the Paris Olympics.\n\nIn doing so, Allen offered some perspective from his own career. He suited up for the gold medal-winning United States squad at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\n\"I am still proud of the fact that I have competed for my country,\" Allen told the players. \"Past numbers and rankings don't matter. The greatest respect for your opponent is to fight to the best of your ability.\"\n\nA motivational question followed.\n\n\"What does each of you have to do for the team?\" he asked.\n\n\"I want you to have the desire to improve even by one percent, cherish each and every day, and continue to grow until the final match,\" the retired NBA icon said. \"All you have to do now is to prove yourself on the court. I wish you the best of luck.\"\n\nAllen Shares Insights on His NBA Career\n\nOn Saturday, June 15, Allen attended an NBA Finals viewing party in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward, as the Dallas Mavericks thumped the visiting Celtics 122-84 in Game 4 to stave off elimination. Allen participated in an outdoor basketball clinic for students, ranging from elementary school age to age 18. And he also spoke with reporters after the clinic.\n\nAllen, a 10-time NBA All-Star, who averaged 18.9 points per game in his career, shared some thoughts on the importance of practice.\n\n\"What I'm trying to focus on is keeping myself in good condition,\" the University of Connecticut legend said. \"When I get tired, I tend to take shortcuts to make it less difficult.\n\n\"The way you use your body in basketball and in your personal life is completely different. It is important to keep yourself in good condition so that you can play basketball using muscles that you don't normally use without getting tired.\"\n\nAn NBA Icon Accentuates Positivity\n\nIn keeping with his reputation as an upbeat player throughout his NBA career, Allen reminded the clinic participants to encourage one another during games and practices.\n\nThat positive teamwork, he insisted, is a building block of success.\n\nAllen provided a vivid example, pointing out that a simple congratulatory gesture is a good thing.\n\n\"Hey guys, do you know how important the high-five is?\" Allen asked the enthusiastic players. \"There is also data that shows that teams that do the high-five have a higher chance of winning.\n\n\"So if a kid on your team makes a good play, please give them a high-five. Let's also end today's meeting with a high-five.\"\n\nThe players gathered together around Allen.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nA unified high-five, of course, with a chant that the onlookers and participants will easily remember decades from now.\n\n\"One, two, three, NBA!\"\n\nIt was an appropriate, fun closing moment at the NBA clinic.\n\nRELATED:\n\nJapan's First NBA Basketball School Opens Amid Hoop Fever\n\nTominaga Joins Curry Brand as a Brand Ambassador\n\nAspiring NBA player Keisei Tominaga has finalized a multi-year endorsement deal with Curry Brand, in partnership with Under Armour.\n\nTominaga has become the first international athlete to sign a contract with Curry Brand, it was announced on Friday, June 14. Curry Brand is a global showcase for NBA superstar Stephen Curry's footwear and apparel.\n\nPer terms of the contract, the former University of Nebraska standout is committed to wearing Curry Brand sneakers and clothing on the court. He's also set to perform brand ambassador duties. A news release also stated that Tominaga will be involved in \"community impact initiatives.\"\n\nTominaga said he's excited about this opportunity.\n\n\"It is an incredible honor to join Curry Brand and be among its elite roster of athletes,\" Tominaga said in a statement. \"Steph has always been one of my basketball heroes and I have worked hard to emulate his game in my own basketball career, so to be able to represent his brand and everything he stands for is a dream come true.\"\n\nTominaga is affectionately known as the \"Japanese Steph Curry,\" a nod to his skills as a sharpshooter.\n\n\"We are excited to have Keisei join the Curry Brand family as we continue to extend our mission internationally,\" company president Stephen Curry said. \"He has a dedication to the game and continues to be an inspiration for athletes across the globe. I love that we are growing this amazing roster of Curry Brand athletes, and Keisei along with our other athletes are continuing to create an impact and changing the game of basketball.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the NBA Draft on June 26, Tominaga has participated in workouts for the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers and Sacramento Kings in recent weeks.\n\nTominaga is expected to play for Japan in the upcoming Paris Olympics.\n\nRELATED:\n\nNebraska's Keisei Tominaga Finishes College Career With a Strong Performance in NCAA Tournament Loss\n\nCoach Mizuno Leaves the Crane Thunders\n\nAfter two seasons at the helm, Guna Crane Thunders coach Kota Mizuno's contract has expired, and the B.League team is not renewing the deal. Gunma made an announcement on Friday, June 14.\n\nThe Crane Thunders had a 29-31 record in 2022-23, followed by a 31-29 record in 2023-24. They missed the playoffs both seasons.\n\nMizuno, who served as the Alvark Tokyo's top assistant coach from 2018-22 before joining Gunma, said he was frustrated that the Crane Thunders didn't advance to the playoffs in either season.\n\n\"I am grateful to the front office for entrusting me with the head coach position for two seasons, a period of growth for the club,\" he added in a statement. \"Most of all, I would like to thank all the players and staff who helped and supported me. Thank you very much.\n\n\"The time we spent fighting for the same goal will always be an important asset for me.\"\n\nRELATED:\n\nCrane Thunders Make Winning Debut at Open House Arena Ota\n\nFilipino Standout Kiefer Ravena Joins B-Corsairs\n\nVeteran guard Kiefer Ravena, who spent the past three seasons with the Shiga Lakes (formerly known as the Lakestars), will play for the rebuilding Yokohama B-Corsairs in the 2024-25 season, it was announced on Friday.\n\n\"I'm very much excited to play for the Yokohama B-Corsairs said in a team-issued news release. \"This will be a new chapter in my career and I hope I'm able to bring my experience and competitiveness to the team. I'm excited to meet and play for the boosters and make a run for the championship.\"\n\nHis younger brother Thirdy Ravena, who suited up for the San-en Neo Phoenix from 2020-24, is currently a free agent.\n\nKiefer Ravena averaged 12.4 points and 5.5 assists in 59 games for the Lakes in 2023-24, helping the team earn promotion from the B.League second division to B1.\n\nSurfing\n\nNakashio Wins World Surf League Pro Junior Event in Indonesia\n\nKana Nakashio, 20, triumphed in the World Surf League's Nias Pro Junior women's competition on Friday, June 14 at Lagundri Bay in Nias, Indonesia.\n\nNakashio outpointed Japanese compatriot Sumomo Sato in the final, posting a total of 13.27 points in their head-to-head duel. Sato finished with 11.07. Also for Japan, Mirai Ikeda had 9.76 points in the four-woman final and Cocona Kawase received 8.47 points.\n\n\"I'm so happy to get this win,\" Nakashio said, according to the World Surf League website, before adding, \"I knew there were lulls in the swell so I had to wait and only take the best waves, so I waited for my opportunity.\n\n\"On my first wave, I got a good score, so I felt like I was in tune with the wave. I just had to wait for the next chance. Finally, just at the end of the final, I got my opportunity, and I got the score to win it.\"\n\nWith the victory in the tournament that ran from June 8-14, Nakashio solidified her spot atop the WSL Asia Regional Pro Junior rankings.\n\nRELATED:\n\nConnor O'Leary Named to Japan's 2024 Olympic Surfing Team\n\nTennis\n\nNishikori, Osaka Eligible to Play in Paris Games\n\nAccording to the International Tennis Federation's official protocol, a national Olympic committee can designate up to four players to participate in the men's and women's singles draws if they are ranked 56th or higher as of June 10.\n\nBut there are exceptions to the rule.
