        "text": "The last time he was at the TD Garden as an opponent, Ray Allen drew a routine amount of attention.\n\nHe was a member of the former Seattle SuperSonics on March 9, 2007 and scored 22 points while making only 2 of 9 shots from 3-point range in a 118-103 loss to the Celtics.\n\nNearly six years later, Allen returns to Causeway Street this afternoon as a Celtics’ foe, and it is safe to say he will be receiving a lot more than just a routine amount of attention.\n\nAfter spending five successful seasons wearing No. 20 for the Celtics and winning an NBA championship, Allen left the organization in a bitter divorce last summer, signing as a free agent with the reigning kings, the Miami Heat.\n\nIt was a move that did not go over well in these parts as the Big 3 of Allen, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, formed in the summer of 2007, was broken up.\n\nSo it will be interesting to see what type of response Allen receives from the crowd of 18,624 when he steps onto the parquet floor today wearing a No. 34 Heat jersey.\n\nWill he be feted for being such a key contributor to a successful five-year run the Celtics had after many seasons of the franchise being down and out?\n\nOr will Allen be given the Johnny Damon treatment and booed from start to finish?\n\nHe returns to the Garden to face a former team that is reeling with six straight losses for the first time since April 2007 and a 20-23 record. The end of the good times in the Garnett era has arrived, a point driven home when the Celtics couldn’t even hold a 27-point lead in Atlanta on Friday night.\n\nThe 37-year-old Allen elected to leave the Celtics behind after a series of factors combined to sour him on the situation in Boston.\n\nAfter struggling with ankle issues last season, he was dropped from the starting lineup in favor of defensive specialist Avery Bradley. There was a poor relationship with fellow guard Rajon Rondo. And the constant threat of being traded at the deadline in February upset Allen.\n\nOff he went to South Beach, signing a three-year contract worth $9.5 million rather than taking the two-year, $12 million offer the Celtics extended to keep him in Boston.\n\n“I don’t feel like we lost Ray,” Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said last July. “I feel like Ray left us to go to Miami. We tried to get Ray back. He chose to go to Miami.”\n\nLosing Allen hit the Celtics hard, as was evident when Garnett said in training camp that he had lost the guard’s phone number. Garnett then snubbed Allen when he went over to the Celtics bench on opening night and tried to shake hands.\n\nThe Celtics signed Jason Terry and Courtney Lee, hoping the combination would offset the loss of Allen, but that has clearly not happened. It is obvious the Celtics’ offense is desperately missing Allen’s long-range shooting.\n\nTerry, signed through the 2014-15 season, is hitting only 43 percent from the floor and has been a far cry from what the Celtics have expected. Lee has been a capable defender, though his offense is spotty.\n\nAllen has come off the bench in all 39 Heat games and is fourth on the team in scoring, averaging 11.4 points in 25.5 minutes. He is shooting 48 percent from the floor, including 44 percent from 3-point range, and leads the team with 70 3-pointers.\n\nThe Heat are clearly getting from Allen what they wanted, a dependable bench scorer, which is something the Celtics sought when they tried to re-sign him. Allen’s ego took a hit in Boston, though, and he wanted an escape, finding the best team in the league to continue his career.\n\n“I’m not doing the things that I’ve done in my years past,” Allen recently told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. “I can’t say it’s like a severe adjustment. I’m not scoring in the areas I’ve known I’ve scored in the past.\n\n“When I got to Boston is when Doc (Rivers) kept me from handling the ball and just kept me on the perimeter and kept me over in the corner, which I wasn’t particularly happy with. I just adjusted to what I needed to do there.”\n\nHe adjusted and was a main attraction during a successful Celtics’ era. Whether a move to the Heat negates all that and results in wall-to-wall boos today remains to be seen."
