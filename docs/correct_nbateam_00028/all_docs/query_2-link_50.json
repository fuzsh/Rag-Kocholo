He entered the NBA in 1996 as the fifth overall selection, selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves, but was immediately traded to the Milwaukee Bucks. In the NBA, he developed into a prolific scorer for the Bucks, featuring alongside Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell as the team achieved playoff success. However, the trio were unable to capture a championship, and Allen was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics. In Seattle, Allen's reputation as a scorer was solidified; he would break several league records for three-point and free throw shooting. Despite this, a title still eluded Allen, and he was traded to the Boston Celtics in 2007.\n\nIn Boston, Allen and new teammates Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce formed a \"Big Three\" and had immediate success, winning an NBA championship in 2008 against the Los Angeles Lakers, to give the team its 17th championship. He remained with the franchise for five seasons, before departing in free agency to join the Miami Heat for two seasons. In Miami, Allen accepted a reserve role, emphasizing spot-up and clutch shooting, which allowed him to capture another championship in 2013. His clutch three-pointer to tie Game 6 of the Finals against the San Antonio Spurs with 5.2 seconds remaining is regarded as one of the most memorable and clutch plays in NBA history.\n\nAllen's list of individual accolades are extensive; he gained ten NBA All-Star designations, he won an Olympic gold medal as a member of the 2000 United States men's basketball team, and he also holds NBA records in career three-point field goals made in both the regular season, and has additionally scored the third most three-pointers in the postseason. He is widely considered one of the best shooters of all-time.\n\nDuring his NBA career, Allen acted during some offseasons. He is best known for his role as basketball prodigy Jesus Shuttlesworth in He Got Game (1998). Allen's performance as Shuttlesworth was greatly praised by critics, and the name was borrowed as Allen's basketball nickname.\n\nEarly Life\n\nThe third of five children, Ray Allen was born at Castle Air Force Base near Merced, California. A military child, he spent time growing up in Saxmundham in England, Altus in Oklahoma, Edwards Air Force Base in California, and Germany. He attended high school in Dalzell, South Carolina, where he led Hillcrest High School to a basketball state championship.\n\nCollege\n\nAllen attended the University of Connecticut from 1993-1996 after being recruited by assistant coach Karl Hobbs. While at UCONN he earned All-American status and was named USA Basketball's Male Athlete of the Year in 1995.\n\nIn 1995–96, his final college season, Allen was a first-team All-American and won the Big East Player of the Year Award. Allen finished his UConn career third on the Huskies' career scoring list with 1,922 points and set a single-season school record by connecting on 115 three-pointers in 1995–96.\n\nIn 2001, he was named honorary captain of the 25-member UConn All-Century Basketball Team. On February 5, 2007, his name and number were honored at Connecticut's Gampel Pavilion during the \"Huskies of Honor\" ceremony at halftime of the men's basketball game against the Syracuse Orange.\n\nNBA career\n\nMilwaukee Bucks (1996–2003)\n\n1996-1999: Early years in Milwaukee\n\nAllen was drafted out of the University of Connecticut by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the fifth pick of the 1996 NBA Draft. Immediately after his selection, Allen and Andrew Lang were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for the rights to fourth pick Stephon Marbury. On July 24, 1996, Allen signed a 3-year, $6.2 million contract with the Bucks. Allen made his NBA debut on November 1, 1996, where he started and played 28 minutes and scored 13 points in a win against fellow rookie Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers. On January 12, 1997, Allen put in one of his strongest efforts of the season in a win against the Golden State Warriors, contributing 22 points, 6 assists, 3 steals, and a new career high of 9 rebounds. In February 1997, Allen competed in the Slam Dunk Contest during the All-Star Weekend, where he finished fourth. Continuing his strong rookie season, on March 25, 1997, Allen scored a new career high of 32 points in a loss to the Phoenix Suns. Allen was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team.\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Allen played and started all 82 games for the Bucks. In the season opener, he put up 29 points, including 6 three-pointers in a win against the 76ers. On December 20, 1997, Allen set a new career high of 35 points against the New York Knicks. On the brink of missing the playoffs for the second straight year, on April 18, 1998, the last game of the regular season, Allen tallied a 40-point double-double with 10 rebounds.\n\n1999–2003: Building his legacy\n\nOn February 10, 1999, following the 1998–99 NBA lockout, Allen signed a six-year, $70.9 million extension with the Bucks, making him the highest paid player in franchise history at that point. The 1998–99 season saw Allen make his first playoff appearance, with the Bucks earning the seventh seed. There they were swept by the Indiana Pacers in the first round despite Allen averaging 22.3 points per game. The following season, on January 20, 2000, Allen recorded a career-high 13 assists in a loss to the Seattle SuperSonics. On February 3, 2000, Allen scored 36 points and grabbed 8 rebounds in a 102-99 win against the Utah Jazz. A month later, Allen played in his first All-Star Game, where he had 14 points in 17 minutes. During the 1999–2000 season, Allen led the Bucks in scoring during the regular and post-season.\n\nOn February 7, 2001, Allen recorded his first career triple-double with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists against the Boston Celtics. A few days later, he participated and won his first 3-point shootout during All-Star Weekend. Allen, alongside Sam Cassell and Glenn Robinson, helped lead the Bucks to the Eastern Conference Finals. Allen recorded a new playoff career high with 41 points in a Game 6 victory over the 76ers, but the Bucks ultimately lost in seven games. Allen earned All-NBA Third Team honors in 2001.\n\nSeattle SuperSonics (2003–2007)\n\nAllen remained with the Bucks midway through the 2002-03 season, when he was dealt to the Sonics, along with Ronald Murray, former UConn teammate Kevin Ollie, and a conditional first round draft pick, in exchange for Gary Payton and Desmond Mason. After an injury-riddled 2003-04 season, he was named to the All-NBA 2nd Team and, alongside teammate Rashard Lewis, led the Sonics to the Conference Semifinals in 2005.\n\nAfter the 2004-05 season, Allen signed a 5-year, $80 million contract extension. In the 2006–07 regular season, he averaged a career-high 26.4 points per game while adding 4.5 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game.\n\nDuring his Sonics tenure, Allen achieved many individual accomplishments. On March 12, 2006, Allen became the 97th player in NBA history to score 15,000 points. On April 7, 2006, Allen moved into second place on the NBA's list of all-time 3-point field goals made, trailing only Reggie Miller. On April 19, 2006, Allen broke Dennis Scott's ten-year-old NBA record for 3-point field goals made in a season in a game against the Denver Nuggets. The record has since been broken by Stephen Curry.\n\nOn January 12, 2007, Allen scored a career-high 54 points against the Utah Jazz in a 122–114 overtime win, the second most in Sonics history. Shortly after, he had ankle surgery on both ankles and missed the remainder of the 2006–07 season.\n\nBoston Celtics (2007–2012)\n\n2007-09: First championship and Finals upset\n\nOn June 28, 2007, the Sonics traded Allen and Glen Davis, the 35th overall pick in the 2007 NBA Draft, to the Celtics in exchange for Delonte West, Wally Szczerbiak, and the fifth overall pick, Jeff Green. Shortly after acquiring Allen, the Celtics acquired Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett to play alongside Allen and Paul Pierce. The trio formed the core of the new \"Big Three\" era in Boston. Upon joining the Celtics, Allen changed his jersey to number 20 because Pierce already had number 34 in Boston.\n\nOn November 4, 2007, Allen passed 17,000 points for his career with his first of two 3-pointers in overtime in a 98–95 victory against the Toronto Raptors, in which he sank the game winning 3-pointer with three seconds remaining in overtime.\n\nOn February 13, 2008, Allen was named by NBA Commissioner David Stern to replace injured East All-Star Caron Butler of the Washington Wizards, who was out with a left hip flexor strain, for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans. While LeBron James was given the All-Star MVP Award, many analysts, including the TNT commentators of the game, felt it should have gone to Allen, who scored 14 points in a stretch of 2 minutes and 30 seconds in the fourth quarter to seal the win for the East team.\n\nOn March 28, 2008, Allen was honored as the 3rd best of the 20 greatest players in franchise history during Milwaukee's 40th Anniversary Team Celebration, but could not attend the festivities because of the Celtics' game against the New Orleans Hornets. The Celtics finished 66-16, and were the #1 seed in the 2008 NBA Playoffs. The Celtics struggled in the first two rounds of the playoffs, losing every single away game, but maintaining a undefeated playoff record at home. The Celtics had defeated the #8 seeded Atlanta Hawks 4-3 and then defeated the #4 seeded Cleveland Cavaliers 4-3 as well. They advanced to the NBA Finals after a 4-2 Conference Finals series win over the Detroit Pistons.\n\nOn June 12, 2008, Allen would play all 48 minutes and contribute greatly with 19 points and 9 rebounds in what would become the largest comeback in NBA Finals history, with the Celtics coming back from a 24-point deficit at one point in the second quarter and a deficit as large as 20 in the third. In that game, Allen would make the game clinching layup with 16.4 seconds remaining to give the Celtics a 5-point lead and put the game away.\n\nOn June 17, 2008, in the series-ending Game 6 of the NBA Finals, Allen tied an NBA Finals record with seven three-pointers in the Celtics' 131–92 victory of the Los Angeles Lakers, and also broke the record for three-pointers made in a NBA Finals series with 22, eclipsing the previous record of 17 by Dan Majerle and Derek Harper.\n\nOn February 5, 2009, Allen was named as the All-Star replacement for Orlando Magic point guard Jameer Nelson. This marks Allen's ninth time on the All-Star team and the second straight year he has made it alongside teammates Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce.\n\nOn February 22, 2009, with his streak ending at 72, Allen broke the Celtics franchise record in consecutive free throws made previously set by Larry Bird (71).\n\nIn the first round of the 2009 Playoffs against the Chicago Bulls, Game 1 proved to be tough for Allen. He ended up shooting 1–11 from the field, and the Celtics lost by two. In Game 2, however, Allen nailed the game winning three-pointer at the end of regulation with two seconds left to cap off an impressive 30 point night. In Game 6, despite a Boston loss, Allen managed to score 51 points. Boston ended up winning the series in 7 Games. He reunited with former teammate and co-captain of the Seattle SuperSonics, Rashard Lewis in the Conference Semifinals, this time as opponents, however. After 4 games and a 2–2 series tie, his highest scoring game was a 22 point performance in a Game 2 victory.\n\n2009-12: Later seasons\n\nOn December 10, 2009, Allen scored 18 points to reach the 20,000 point total for his career.\n\nOn June 6, 2010, in Game 2 of the 2010 Finals in a 103–94 victory against the Los Angeles Lakers, Allen set the record for most three-pointers made in an NBA Finals game on 8–11 shooting. He broke Michael Jordan's record of six three-pointers in one half by hitting seven in the first half and had tied Scottie Pippen and Kenny Smith's record for most three-pointers in one game in the NBA Finals by half time. Allen also became the first player in NBA history to have two separate games of scoring at least seven three-pointers in the NBA Finals. In the following game, on June 8, 2010, Allen was one miss shy of tying the NBA Finals record of most consecutive missed shots, going 0–13 from the field, including 0–8 from the 3-point line. He did, however, manage to score 2 points from the free throw line.\n\nAfter becoming a free agent on July 1, 2010, Allen re-signed a two year-deal with the Boston Celtics on July 7 worth $20 million.\n\nDuring a game against the Lakers on February 10, 2011, Allen became the all-time NBA leader in total 3-point field goals made (2,562), surpassing Reggie Miller's record of 2,560. The 35 year-old shooting guard finished the game with 20 points, but the Celtics eventually lost 92-86. In the 2010-11 season, Allen was named to his tenth All-Star game alongside teammates Rajon Rondo, Paul Pierce, and Kevin Garnett. Also during All-Star Weekend, Allen competed in the 3-Point Shootout, but lost to James Jones of the Miami Heat. Allen became an unrestricted free agent after the season.\n\nMiami Heat (2012–2014)\n\nAfter feeling unappreciated and non-prioritized during the 2012 off-season, Allen rejected a two-year, $12 million offer to return to the Boston Celtics and accepted a three-year deal with the Miami Heat, who were limited to their mid-level exception amount of slightly more than $3 million per season. During Allen's first season with the Miami Heat, he averaged 10.9 points per game and made 88.6% of his free throws while playing an average of 25.8 minutes per game. On April 25, 2013, while playing Milwaukee in Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, Allen made his 322nd career three-pointer in the playoffs, which broke Reggie Miller's record for most three-pointers made in NBA playoff history. Allen returned to his favorite #34 jersey upon joining the Heat.\n\nIn Game 6 of the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, as the Heat trailed by three points, Allen made a game-tying 3-pointer near Tony Parker with 5.2 seconds left in the fourth quarter to force overtime after receiving a pass from Chris Bosh. Having rallied from a 10-point deficit at the end of the third quarter, the Heat won in overtime 103–100 over the Spurs and forced a seventh game in the series. With the Heat leading 101–100, Allen stole the ball from Manu Ginóbili under the Spurs' basket and drew a foul with 1.9 seconds remaining in the overtime period. Allen made both ensuing free throws to put Miami up 103–100. Allen played 41 minutes in Game 6 off the bench and scored 9 points on 3-for-8 field goal shooting; his game-tying three-pointer was the only three-pointer he made in three attempts. Allen also had one defensive rebound and two assists. In Game 7, which the Heat won 95–88 to win its second consecutive championship, Allen played 20 minutes off the bench. Although he made none of 4 field goal attempts and had 3 turnovers, Allen recorded 4 defensive rebounds, and 4 assists.\n\nOn June 29, 2013, Allen picked up his $3.23 million player option to stay with the Heat through the 2013-14 season. During the regular season, Allen played in 73 games, starting 9 of them, averaging 9.6 points and shooting 37 percent from three-point range. In the playoffs, Allen scored 19 points on 4–7 three-point shooting in Game 4 of the conference semifinals against the Brooklyn Nets. Then in Game 3 against the Indiana Pacers in an Eastern Conference Finals rematch, Allen hit four 3-point shots in the fourth quarter and put them up 2–1 in the series. The Heat won the series in six games to advance to the NBA Finals for the fourth straight year and Allen's second straight, and fourth overall. The Heat faced the Spurs again in the Finals, but they lost the series in five games.\n\nRetirement\n\nAllen became a free agent in the 2014 off-season, and after much anticipation of a return at some point during the 2014–15 season, he announced his decision to sit out the season and focus on 2015–16. However, he did not end up joining a team for the 2015–16 season either. In July 2016, Allen began mulling a comeback, and admitted he was \"intrigued\" by the possibility of competing for another championship. The following month, Allen had talks with the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks regarding a possible return, but ultimately decided to officially retire from the game on November 1, 2016. In September 2018, Allen was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In February 2019, Allen played in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game. In October 2021, as part of the NBA's 75th Anniversary, Allen was honored as one of the 75 greatest players of all time, by being named to the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team.\n\nActing career\n\nIn 1998, Allen co-starred alongside Denzel Washington in the Spike Lee film He Got Game as high school basketball phenomenon Jesus Shuttlesworth. Roger Ebert praised his performance and said Allen \"is that rarity: an athlete who can act,\" while New York magazine described him as \"graceful and fast in the basketball scenes\" while giving \"a somberly effective minimalist performance.\" His role as Jesus Shuttlesworth earned him that name as a nickname from teammates and fans. Allen also appeared as Marcus Blake in the 2001 film Harvard Man. In 2015, Allen co-starred alongside Kyrie Irving, Baron Davis, and J. B. Smoove as Walt in the fourth episode of \"Uncle Drew\", a series of Pepsi Max advertisements written and directed by Irving.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAllen married singer/actress Shannon Walker Williams on August 16, 2008, after having dated since 2004. They have four children together.\n\nAllen says that he has a borderline case of obsessive–compulsive disorder, to which he attributes his consummate shooting style.\n\nAllen served as NBA Spokesperson for the Jr. NBA / Jr. WNBA program and was selected as NBA Spokesman for the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.
