        "text": "WALTHAM - Celtics executive director of basketball operations Danny Ainge said Thursday night he was ‘‘excited’’ about bringing Ray Allen to Boston and that captain Paul Pierce was ‘‘thrilled to death’’ with the draft-day deal. But you have to figure that the man in the organization happiest of all about the dramatic move is Doc Rivers.\n\nFor a coach who has seen his record get worse and worse over the past three years as his team has gotten younger and younger, the idea of picking up a seven-time All-Star who is considered among the NBA’s consummate professionals - as opposed to another borderline teenager in the draft - had to have been a tremendous relief.\n\n‘‘We still have our young guys,’’ Rivers noted, ‘‘I don’t know if we have gotten that much older. But (bringing in Allen) is different from a 20-year-old, or a 19-year-old, where it’s ‘someday.’ It’s nice having a guy who you know can play.’’ If all the deals had fallen through, and the Celtics had picked No. 5 Thursday night, you can be sure Rivers would have turned up the television charm and put on a happy face as he talked about the potential of a Corey Brewer, Jeff Green or Yi Jianlian. But after two seasons of spoon-feeding professional basketball to one high school kid and college underclassman after another, you can bet he will welcome the sight of a 12-year veteran coming off one of his most productive seasons.\n\nBeyond what Allen brings as a complementary scorer to Paul Pierce is what he could bring to a developing roster looking for guidance.\n\nPierce has been a great model for the likes of Al Jefferson, Gerald Green and Tony Allen with his warrior mentality and tremendous skill, but he was never ideally suited as a counselor for young players - preferring, instead, the tough-love approach of telling them: ‘‘You get beat up in the schoolyard enough times and eventually you learn to punch back.’’\n\nAllen’s exemplary reputation around the league suggests he may be a less abrasive example to follow and do the type of teaching only a teammate can.\n\n‘‘They can benefit from just watching Ray Allen and his actions,’’ Rivers said. ‘‘One of the things we struggle with having all the young guys was that they didn’t have a lot of guys in their locker room showing them the professional way. Besides Paul and Wally (Szczerbiak) we didn’t have a lot of veterans.\n\n‘‘So every time you add a veteran,’’ he continued, ‘‘especially a guy like Ray Allen, who has great work ethic and great character, just his presence and how he does his job every day will be very important. For Gerald Green, especially, because he plays the same position.’’\n\nWhen it’s game time, the NBA’s fifth-leading scorer from last year (26.4 points per game) will also give Rivers a trustworthy option next to Pierce on the perimeter that Szczerbiak (because of injuries and diminishing speed) and Ricky Davis (because of inconsistency and tendency to break plays) were unable to provide the past two years.\n\n‘‘I love it,’’ Rivers said. ‘‘I had it my first year here (with Antoine Walker) and we did pretty well. I think this is a better situation. We still have some holes, but the fact that Al has progressed at the same time (helps too). You could make the case that Al is a No. 2 guy too. Now, at times, those guys will change on and off who it is.\n\n‘‘I just like that we have a post player and two wing players,’’ he added, ‘‘two terrific wing players.’’ For a team that was incapable, at times, of doing anything offensively when Pierce was injured or on the bench last year, Rivers said he isn’t worried that suddenly there will be a lack of touches to go around.\n\n‘‘I don’t think shots are going to be a problem,’’ he said. ‘‘If you are hustling, get rebounds and play some defense you can get as many shots as you want. Usually, when you get two guards together they pass to each other, and overpass, and so my goal is to get them as aggressive as possible and then figure it out.’’ At least he now knows that when he does figure it out, he will have two players with the talent and experience to go out and execute the directive.\n\nAfter two years of rubbing his fingers raw on the dry-erase board trying to explain things over and over again, that is something the coach should very much be looking forward to seeing."
