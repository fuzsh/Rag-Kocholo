        "text": "Proud graduates and families celebrated their achievements over the weekend at graduation ceremonies in Storrs and one of the esteemed UConn grads was former Huskies basketball great, Olympian and NBA star Ray Allen.\n\nThe 47-year-old who played basketball for the UConn Huskies from 1993 to 1996 returned to Gampel Pavilion Sunday in a cap and gown, 27 years after hitting his last jump shot in the building.\n\nAllen sat in the stands with other graduating students, under a banner commemorating the retirement of his UConn jersey, then took his place in the procession to receive his bachelor's degree in general studies.\n\nThe two-time NBA champion was greeted with a loud ovation as he was handed his diploma and gave a thumbs up to his family.\n\nAllen is also an Olympic gold medalist. He was part of the gold-winning basketball team in Sydney in 2000."
