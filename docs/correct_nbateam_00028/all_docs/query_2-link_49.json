        "text": "Former Milwaukee Bucks star Ray Allen, the NBA's all-time leader in three-point field goals, officially announced his retirement on The Players Tribune on Tuesday.\n\nThe 41-year-old Allen has not played since the 2013-'14 season with Miami, but he had kept open the possibility of a return during the past two seasons and even this summer.\n\nAllen played his first seven NBA seasons with the Bucks and helped lead them to the Eastern Conference finals in 2001, falling one game short of the NBA Finals. He formed a \"Big Three\" with Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell.\n\nSTATS: Ray Allen's career statistics\n\nBut the Bucks sent Allen to Seattle in an infamous deal on Feb. 20, 2003, acquiring Gary Payton and Desmond Mason in exchange for Allen, Kevin Ollie, Ron Murray and a draft pick. Allen went on to star for the SuperSonics, Boston Celtics and Heat, and he won two NBA titles, one with Boston in 2008 and another in Miami in 2013.\n\nPayton played in only 28 games with the Bucks before signing with the Los Angeles Lakers as a free agent.\n\nAllen wrote a letter to his 13-year-old self in The Players Tribune, telling that youngster what he could expect from an NBA career.\n\nAllen wrote in one section: \"But this game is not a movie. It's not about being the man in the fourth quarter. It's not about talk. It's about getting your work in every single day, when nobody is watching.\"\n\nBucks guard Jason Terry, who ranks third on the league's all-time three-point list, praised Allen for that work ethic.\n\n\"I competed against him when he was with the Bucks,\" the 39-year-old Terry said after the team's shootaround on Tuesday. \"I always wanted to emulate greatness, and he was one of the guys I tried to emulate.\n\n\"What I stole from him was his shooting routine. He had to make 10 in a row (from 3-point range) before he finished his workout, from each spot. I still use it today.\"\n\nThe Bucks traded for Allen on draft night in 1996, making a swap with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Milwaukee chose Stephon Marbury with the fourth overall choice and the Timberwolves selected Allen fifth.\n\nIt proved to be a wise trade. Despite only playing seven years in Milwaukee, Allen still ranks among team leaders in several all-time categories: ninth in points (9,681); first in three-pointers made (1,051) and second to Jack Sikma in free throw percentage (87.9%).\n\nAllen's scoring average of 19.6 points with the Bucks puts him sixth on the franchise list and he is 10th in games played (494).\n\nHe ended his NBA career with 2,973 three-pointers made, the most in league history.\n\nThe debate about the best shooters in league history certainly includes Allen. Golden State's Stephen Curry, a two-time league most valuable player and prolific three-point shooter, is the NBA's current version of Allen.\n\n\"Ray is in that class with Reggie (Miller),\" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. \"Just a pure shooter. You talk about Larry Bird and the great shooters in this league. It comes to an end because everybody thought he might come back and play. It just puts an end to that question.\"\n\nAllen pondered a return to the NBA as recently as this summer, but the Bucks had signed several free agents in early July and discussions never got serious about a possible return to Milwaukee. Eventually, the team signed Terry to provide leadership and add to its perimeter shooting.\n\nKnown for his sweet shooting stroke, Allen hit a dramatic game-tying three-pointer in the final seconds of regulation in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals. Miami went on to win that game in overtime and prevailed in Game 7 to defeat San Antonio for the championship.\n\n\"That's one when you talk about big shots in the moment,\" Kidd said. \"A lot of players want to be in it. A lot of players are in it and find out real quickly they can't deliver. He's always enjoyed that position, wanting the ball late and being asked to make a shot. Everybody knows he's getting the ball, and he delivers. That just shows how good a player he really was.\"\n\nAllen combined with Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce to bring the Celtics a title before moving on to Miami as a free agent to join LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. He finished his 18-year NBA career (1,300 games) with a scoring average of 18.9 points and shot an even 40% from three-point distance.\n\nAllen also won an Olympic gold medal as a member of the U.S. team in the 2000 Sydney Games."
