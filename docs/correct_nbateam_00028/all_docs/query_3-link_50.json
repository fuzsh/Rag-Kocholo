        "text": "Former Milwaukee Bucks superstar Ray Allen was recently asked to name his all-time starting five and a sixth man. While his starting five was composed of all-time greats, his selection for the team's sixth man raised a few eyebrows as he picked his former Miami Heat teammate, LeBron James.\n\nIncredible quintet\n\nRay Allen did not bat an eyelash in naming who's on his starting five. He started with Chicago Bulls icon Michael Jordan. After all, who else would be the first name on anyone else's mind when it comes to assembling the best of the best? Allen then completed his backcourt with former Los Angeles Lakers great Magic Johnson.\n\nThe two-time NBA champion continued by naming Boston Celtics legend Larry Bird. For the big men, Allen chose Hall of Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Shaquille O'Neal. The starting five was already an incredible quintet, but the team's sixth man further cemented Allen's lineup: four-time NBA champion LeBron James.\n\nSuper Sixth Man\n\nThe decision took some time for Allen, but he eventually named LeBron to be this team's off-the-bench sparkplug. As curious as this call is, it's hard to argue against it. LeBron's immense talent, prolific scoring, and natural passing ability would give Allen's dream team a formidable edge over any other hypothetical all-time five.\n\nPlus, as dominant of a ball player as LeBron is, he's always been about winning. Over his career, he has never been shy about sacrificing individual accolades in order to make the team better. This selflessness could be of great use as a sixth man off the bench for this all-time squad."
