        "text": "Shane DePutronCorrespondent I\n\nRay Allen and the Deadliest Three-Point Shooter From Every NBA Team\n\n0 of 30\n\nJim Rogash/Getty Images\n\nThe field for the NBA All-Star Weekend Three-Point Shootout was recently named to consist of reigning champion Paul Pierce of the Boston Celtics, Ray Allen, also of the Celtics, Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder, James Jones of the Miami Heat, Dorell Wright of the Golden State Warriors and Daniel Gibson of the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nWith the competition taking place on February 19, Allen, who won in 2001, will make his sixth appearance—a testament to his long-time status as one of the league's premier shooters from deep.\n\nConsequently, he is likely considered to be a favorite to win the competition, despite his Pierce returning after last season's victory.\n\nTherefore, it seems as though Allen is in the unique position of being the best three-point shooter on his team.\n\nNevertheless, there are lots of great deep-ball shooters out there who are not on the Celtics.\n\nThis list was designed to give recognition to some of those players, taking a look at all of the teams in the NBA and naming the deadliest three-point shooter on each club.\n\nAtlanta Hawks: Mike Bibby\n\n1 of 30\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks have their fair share of quality three-point shooters, but one stands out from the crowd—Mike Bibby.\n\nAt this point in the season, Bibby leads his team in both treys made per game, at 2.0, and three-point percentage, at 44.0 percent (eighth in the NBA).\n\nAnd although he is currently 32 years old and on the decline of his career, Bibby's impressive deep shooting has certainly assured him a place in the league for some time to come.\n\nBoston Celtics: Ray Allen\n\n2 of 30\n\nElsa/Getty Images\n\nAt 35 years of age, the Boston Celtics' Ray Allen still stands among the NBA's best three-point shooters.\n\nWith averages of 2.3 threes per game on 46.2 percent shooting, Allen ranks third in the league in both, and also leads his team in both categories.\n\nConsequently, it appears that Boston was wise to re-sign Allen in the offseason, as his strong play has earned him an All-Star appearance, while helping to propel the Celtics to the best record in the Eastern Conference.\n\nCharlotte Bobcats: Stephen Jackson\n\n3 of 30\n\nStreeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nStephen Jackson narrowed edged out his teammate D.J. Augustin for the title of the Charlotte Bobcats' best three-point shooter.\n\nAlthough Augustin shoots the three at a slightly higher percentage, Jackson's 33.5 percent shooting is still respectable, and his 1.9 treys per contest is certainly impressive.\n\nAnd Charlotte will need each and every one of his threes if they are going to keep fighting to stay in the playoff picture.\n\nChicago Bulls: Kyle Korver\n\n4 of 30\n\nDoug Pensinger/Getty Images\n\nThe Chicago Bulls acquired Kyle Korver during the offseason for one reason—his three-point shooting.\n\nIn only 21 minutes per game, Korver has managed to knock down an average of 1.5 deep balls on 41.2 percent shooting from beyond the arc.\n\nAnd when Joakim Noah returns from injury, finally allowing the Bulls to play a significant period of time with both Noah and Carlos Boozer down low, then Korver will certainly get more outside opportunities since opposing defenses will look to double down in the post.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: Daniel Gibson\n\n5 of 30\n\nMike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n\nAs a participant in the Three-Point Shootout, Daniel Gibson will be the only member of the Cleveland Cavaliers participating in the NBA All-Star Weekend.\n\nYet by sinking 1.9 threes per game at 40.5 percent, while playing on an extremely depleted roster, Gibson did all he could to earn his spot.\n\nNevertheless, the Cavs will need much more than his outside shooting in order to end their record-losing streak and turn things around.\n\nDallas Mavericks: DeShawn Stevenson\n\n6 of 30\n\nRonald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nWhile playing only about 19 minutes per game, DeShawn Stevenson has still managed to connect on 1.7 threes on average for the Dallas Mavericks—leading the team.\n\nFurthermore, he has been successful on 41.3 percent of his attempts, making him a few tenths of a point shy of being the team leader.\n\nHowever, should Peja Stojakovic step in and perform well, Stevenson could soon see his position as the team's biggest deep-ball threat fade away.\n\nDenver Nuggets: Chauncey Billups\n\n7 of 30\n\nDoug Pensinger/Getty Images\n\nThe Denver Nuggets' Chauncey Billups has been one of the better three-point shoots in the NBA for a while now—and 2010-11 has been no exception.\n\nCurrently, he is shooting 44.4 percent from beyond the arc, while averaging 2.0 threes per contest, good for sixth and eighth in the league, respectively.\n\nAnd while his teammate Arron Afflalo deserves some recognition for shooting 44.9 percent from deep, Billups' long-term consistency and clutch play from outside have helped to solidify his position as Denver's best.\n\nDetroit Pistons: Ben Gordon\n\n8 of 30\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nTo put it lightly, things have not gone as planned for Ben Gordon since be joined the Detroit Pistons.\n\nHe is not even leading the Pistons in either three-pointers made thus far in 2010-11, as that honor goes to Charlie Villanueva (who is putting up career numbers from three).\n\nNevertheless, he is still netting 1.4 treys per game and converting at 38.4 percent from long range on the year.\n\nHowever, should those stats increase and approach his career numbers, Gordon could both shore up his spot as Detroit's best three-point shooter and help to get his team into the playoff picture.\n\nGolden State Warriors: Dorell Wright\n\n9 of 30\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nDorell Wright has certainly benefited from his offseason move to the Golden State Warriors.\n\nAfter all, Wright currently sits atop the league in threes made at 2.5 per contest.\n\nHowever, that is not all, as he has achieved this while shooting at 40.9 percent from three, thereby earning himself a spot in the NBA All-Star Three-Point Shootout.\n\nAnd such an impressive performance was necessary to for him to oust his teammate Stephen Curry as the best deep-shooting Warrior.\n\nHouston Rockets: Kevin Martin\n\n10 of 30\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nIn 2010-11, Kevin Martin has clearly settled into his role with the Houston Rockets.\n\nWith a per-game average of 2.3 threes (fourth in the NBA) on 40.6 percent shooting, Martin has led his team in both categories, helping to provide the deep shooting the Rockets have missed due to injuries to Aaron Brooks, the 2009-10 NBA three-point leader.\n\nHowever, with the team will need Martin's shooting if they are to make a late-season run and fight their way into the playoffs.\n\nIndiana Pacers: Danny Granger\n\n11 of 30\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nIn 2010-11, Indiana Pacers forward Danny Granger has seen his three-point totals dip significantly.\n\nHowever, Granger is still hitting 2.1 per game (sixth in the NBA), while shooting a solid 38.4 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nAnd while his teammate Mike Dunleavy is shooting a higher percentage making a slightly few threes per contest, it is Granger's potential knock down threes in bunches which makes him the Pacers' biggest threat from deep.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers: Eric Gordon\n\n12 of 30\n\nStephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers have shown a good deal of promise throughout 2010-11, led by by a few promising young players.\n\nOne of those individuals is Eric Gordon, the Clippers' leading scorer and three-point shooter, who is connecting on 35.9 percent of his attempts, for a total of 2.0 deep-balls per game.\n\nAnd although the 22-year-old guard is currently missing time with a wrist injury, the Clippers can expect Gordon to come back strong and provide the team with some of the exciting play which the team has been missing for the past few years.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers: Shannon Brown\n\n13 of 30\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nKobe Bryant has been a solid three-point shooter throughout his career with the Los Angeles Lakers, however lately that has become less of a focal point in his game.\n\nHe still leads his team with 1.3 threes per game, but his teammate Shannon Brown is only slightly behind that with an average of 1.1.\n\nFurthermore, Brown is shooting 38.4 percent from deep, much high than Kobe's 31.5, and he is doing it in only 18 minutes per game.\n\nSo should Brown see any increase in playing time, he would certainly shore up his spot as the Lakers' clear-cut best shoot from beyond the arc.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: Rudy Gay\n\n14 of 30\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nOver the summer, the Memphis Grizzlies locked down Rudy Gay with a huge five-year contract, worth upwards of $80 million.\n\nAnd while it's still too early to tell if they overpaid for his services, one thing is certain—the 24-year-old Gay is one of the league's better players.\n\nHe's currently making 1.1 threes per game at a team-high (and career-high) 39.7 percent, but his improved play in this area certainly makes him the best three-point threat Memphis has to offer.\n\nMiami Heat: Tie, James Jones and Eddie House\n\n15 of 30\n\nAfter bringing in LeBron James and Chris Bosh and re-signing Dwyane Wade, it was clear that the Miami Heat would need one more thing—some shooters to fill out their roster.\n\nAnd that is exactly what they did with guys like James Jones and Eddie House.\n\nAt this point, Jones is netting 1.8 threes per game on 42.5 percent shooting, while House is knocking down 1.4 treys on 44.1 percent shooting (seventh in the NBA).\n\nAnd so long as they are playing alongside stars who command double teams and set them up with open looks, expect these two players to continue to thrive from deep.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: Brandon Jennings\n\n16 of 30\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nDespite struggling with some injury woes and going through somewhat of a sophomore slump, Brandon Jennings is still having a rather solid campaign for the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nCurrently, he is sinking 1.6 threes per contest at a 35.0 percent clip, although once the 21 year old fully recovers from his recent foot surgery and gains more experience, it would be reasonable to expect his numbers to significantly increase.\n\nConsequently, he has been able to edge out teammate Carlos Delfino, who has only played 18 games and shot 31.9 percent from deep, while making 2.0 treys per game, as the team's most dangerous option from three.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: Kevin Love\n\n17 of 30\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nAlthough it would seem unlikely that a 6'10\", 260-pound forward-center would be a team's biggest threat from deep, Kevin Love has done exactly that for the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nKnocking down 1.4 threes per game and shooting 43.9 percent (10th in the NBA) while doing so, Love has been instrumental to the T-Wolves' success in 2010-11.\n\nAnd although his team is still struggling to compete on a nightly basis, expect the 22-year-old Love, his all-around offense and his tenacity on the boards to play a large part in the future of Minnesota basketball.\n\nNew Jersey Nets: Anthony Morrow\n\n18 of 30\n\nAnthony Morrow has performed well since signing with the New Jersey Nets during the offseason, quickly establishing himself as the team's best three-point shooter.\n\nWith a 43.3 three-point percentage, Morrow has managed to convert on 1.9 threes per game—both team-highs.\n\nAnd as he continues to play with an inside talent like Brook Lopez, Morrow will consistently receive great looks from deep, thereby allowing him an opportunity to be one of the NBA's better deep-ball specialists for years to come.\n\nNew Orleans Hornets: Chris Paul\n\n19 of 30\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nIn his sixth year with the New Orleans Hornets, Chris Paul has been among the best point guards in the league since he first stepped on an NBA court.\n\nHowever, an often underrated portion of his game is his three-point shooting.\n\nAlthough he only attempts a few threes, he connects on 1.1 per contest, good for 45.2 percent shooting—fourth-best in the league.\n\nAnd his Hornets are going to need every one of his threes as they continue to fight for a seeding in the top half of the playoffs in the Western Conference.\n\nNew York Knicks: Shawne Williams\n\n20 of 30\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nDanilo Gallinari is often considered to be the best three-point shooter on the New York Knicks—and for good reason, as he leads the team with 1.8 threes per contest.\n\nHowever, offseason-acquisition Shawne Williams may have done enough to steal that title from Gallo, as he has posted a per-game average of 1.4 treys in only about 18 minutes per night.\n\nMoreover, Williams has posted a scorching 50.6 percent shooting from beyond the arc—the highest number in all of the NBA.\n\nConsequently, if the 24-year-old forward can maintain his efficiency from deep, expect Williams to become a major feature of the Knicks' offense moving forward.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: Kevin Durant\n\n21 of 30\n\nStephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nOnce again, Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder is leading the NBA in scoring.\n\nAnd in order to do so, he has utilized a diverse offensive arsenal, with the three-ball being playing a significant role.\n\nTherefore, he has managed to sink 1.9 threes per game, while shooting 34.7 percent.\n\nHowever, Durant will have a chance to prove that he is among the leagues best from deep when he appears in his first NBA Three-Point Shootout at the 2011 All-Star Weekend.\n\nOrlando Magic: Tie, Jason Richardson and Ryan Anderson\n\n22 of 30\n\nPlaying alongside a dominant post player does wonders for a team's three-point shooting.\n\nAnd for evidence of this, look no further than the Orlando Magic, who, due in large part to the interior play of Dwight Howard, have two of the league's best deep shooters in Jason Richardson and Ryan Anderson.\n\nCurrently, Richardson, who also spent part of the season with the Phoenix Suns, is hitting 2.3 threes per game (second in the NBA) on 39.0 percent shooting, while Anderson is knocking down 2.1 treys (seventh in the NBA) on 39.3 percent shooting.\n\nHowever, if the Magic are truly going to prove to be one of the elite teams of the Eastern Conference, then these two will have to continue to efficiently knock down their shots from beyond the arc.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: Jodie Meeks\n\n23 of 30\n\nLately the Philadelphia 76ers have been surging, and the play of Jodie Meeks has played a large part in that.\n\nOver the past six games, when the Sixers are 4-2, he has hit a per-game average of 2.7 threes at a 50.0 percent clip.\n\nAnd while his numbers on the whole season are not at that level, they are still a respectable 1.7 per contest on 40.7 percent shooting.\n\nConsequently, as the 23 year old continues to improve and garner increased playing time, he will have a chance to earn a name for himself as one of the better deep-ball shooters in the NBA.\n\nPhoenix Suns: Tie, Channing Frye and Vince Carter\n\n24 of 30\n\nLed by two-time MVP point guard Steve Nash, the Phoenix Suns have an exciting, high-octane offense, but without great outside shooting, it would likely fall flat.\n\nThat is where Channing Frye and Vince Carter come in.\n\nAfter a slow start, Frye has picked things up on his way to a per-game average of 2.0 threes (10th in the NBA) on 37.7 percent shooting.\n\nSimilarly, Carter struggled early on, but has been invigorated by his trade from the Orlando Magic to the Suns.\n\nOn the year he is making 1.7 deep-balls per contest at a 38.3 percent clip, although when only considering his number since joining Phoenix, those numbers sit at 2.3 and 40.9 percent.\n\nAnd seeing as though the Suns are in the midst of a multi-team battle for the final playoff spot in the West, they will need both Frye and Carter to continue killing it from downtown.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: Wesley Matthews\n\n25 of 30\n\nSacramento Kings: Omri Casspi\n\n26 of 30\n\nRonald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nThroughout 2010-11, the Sacramento Kings have been near the bottom of the NBA in three-point shooting.\n\nHowever, that is no fault of Omri Casspi's.\n\nCurrently, Casspi is maintaining a per-game average of 1.6 threes on 38.7 percent shooting—both team-highs.\n\nFurthermore, as the 22-year-old Israeli continues to progress as a player, it would not be surprising ton one day find him among the league's better outside shooters.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: Matt Bonner\n\n27 of 30\n\nHarry How/Getty Images\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs have a number of talented three-point shooters, including guys like Manu Ginobili (2.2 per at 36 percent), Richard Jefferson (1.7 per at 42.8 percent) and Gary Neal (1.6 per at 39.7 percent).\n\nHowever, Matt Bonner stands out as the team's preeminent threat from downtown.\n\nIn a mere 22 minutes per game, he manages to knock down 1.8 treys at an extremely efficient 50.4 percent shooting (second in the NBA).\n\nAnd with that type of outside efficiency, it's a shame that the 6'10\" Bonner won't have an opportunity to participate in this year's Three-Point Shootout.\n\nToronto Raptors: Jose Calderon\n\n28 of 30\n\nDoug Benc/Getty Images\n\nThe Toronto Raptors are very likely the NBA's worst three-point shooting team, as they only connect on 4.3 treys per game (29th overall) on a meager 30.8 percent shooting (30th overall).\n\nConsequently, it's difficult to classify any of their players as deadly outside shooters.\n\nHowever, if one player had to don this title, it would be Jose Calderon, the Spanish point guard who is currently making only 0.9 threes per contest, but doing so on a respectable 39.5 percent shooting.\n\nUtah Jazz: Deron Williams\n\n29 of 30\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nDeron Williams of the Utah Jazz is another one of the NBA's best point guards, and in 2010-11 he is having his best scoring campaign to date.\n\nAnd needless to say, the three-pointer has been an essential component to this.\n\nCurrently, Williams is sinking a career-high 1.7 treys per contest, all while connecting on 34.6 percent of his attempts.\n\nAnd while those numbers are by no means eye-popping, when combined with his 21.6-point and 9.6-assist averages, Deron William's outside shooting will very likely be important to his Jazz continuing to fight to carve out a place for themselves in the Western Conference.\n\nWashington Wizards: Nick Young\n\n30 of 30\n\nGreg Fiume/Getty Images\n\nIn his fourth NBA season, Nick Young is finally having his long-anticipated breakout year for the Washington Wizards.\n\nOn the year, the 25 year old is hitting 1.7 threes per game, while shooting a solid 39.5 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nAnd playing alongside a talented young core of players like point guard John Wall and forward-centers JaVale McGee and Andray Blatche, expect Young to continue to develop into once of the better shooters in the league.\n\nX"
