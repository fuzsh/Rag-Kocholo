        "text": "With the sports world on hold, we present a countdown of the 50 greatest moments in Wisconsin sports history over the past 50 years. This is No. 36.\n\nFollowing the 1988-89 season, the Milwaukee Bucks didn't win a playoff series for nearly three decades except for one lonely oasis, when they became the toast of the town.\n\nThe 2000-01 season. George Karl. The Big Three. The conspiracy. It was finally a return to the exciting teams of the 1980s, as Milwaukee's powerhouse trio of Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen and Sam Cassell helped the Bucks finish second in the Eastern Conference with a record of 52-30, four games behind the Philadelpha 76ers for the top seeding in the league playoffs.\n\nThe Bucks beat the Magic in the first round and survived the upset-minded Hornets in seven games. Robinson finished with 29 points and Allen had 28 in a Game 7 victory at the Bradley Center, a 104-95 win that put the Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1986.\n\nThe 76ers, led by dynamic guard Allen Iverson, were waiting.\n\nGlenn Robinson's look at the buzzer bounded out in Game 5, leaving the Bucks with a 89-88 loss and a 3-2 deficit heading home for Game 6 at the Bradley Center on June 1, 2001.\n\nAllen, whose seven years in Milwaukee began with a memorable draft-day swap and ended with one of the most infamous trades in Wisconsin sports history, was a player cherished by Bucks fans. And Game 6 was his Milwaukee magnum opus.\n\n\"When we play basketball like we're capable of playing, we don't have to worry about anything else,\" said Allen, whose 9 three-pointers tied a league playoff record in the 110-100 victory. \"We don't have to worry about the referees, we don't have to worry about the opponent we're playing. This is the style we're capable of playing.\"\n\nRay Allen's personal 17-0 run\n\nYou knew it was going to be a special night in the crowd before the tip, when George Karl and his green blazer drew a standing ovation.\n\nThen, power forward Scott Williams registered the game's first four points, including a 2-on-1 dunk that kept the energy at a premium buzz.\n\nWith 5:15 left in the first quarter, the Ray Allen show began. It started with a jumper, then a tough finger roll through traffic. Then, the triples began. He was in the midst of scoring 19 consecutive Bucks points and on his way to a personal 17-0 run against the Sixers.\n\nHe made another three-pointer to open the second quarter, and perhaps the loudest boom inside the building came when he was open for a sweet rhythm three-pointer with 10:38 to go to cap his legendary 19-point surge. Milwaukee was ahead, 33-15.\n\nWhen the first half was over, Allen had connected on 6 of 8 from three-point range and 8 of 14 overall for 25 points. He hit his final two from long range in the final stretch of the quarter, including the final basket of the half – defended well in the left corner – that gave Milwaukee a staggering 60-31 lead at the break.\n\n\"I don't know if we can play better than we did in the first half,\" Karl said.\n\nAllen was on his way to a playoff career-best 41.\n\nThe 'conspiracy'\n\nThe primary conversation topic before the game, and even on the television broadcast throughout the first-half barrage, centered on Allen's comments about the officiating in the series.\n\n\"The league, as a marketing machine, the bottom line is about making money,” Allen said after Game 5, expressing frustration with the two flagrant fouls and technical foul called on Milwaukee in the tight Game 5 loss. “It behooves everybody for the league to make more money, and the league knows that Philadelphia is going to make more money with L.A. than we would with L.A. (in the finals).”\n\nAllen backtracked on those comments before Game 6, but the seed had been planted for everyone who followed the Bucks. Was there a conspiracy afoot?\n\nThe Bucks were called for 165 fouls in the series to Philadelphia's 122, and a moment in Game 6 became far more pivotal in retrospect. Williams wound up suspended for Game 7 after NBA vice president Stu Jackson re-evaluated an elbow Williams threw against Iverson in Game 6 as a Flagrant II. It was originally ruled a Flagrant I, but the re-evaluation meant Williams had surpassed the limit of “points” against him on flagrant fouls in the postseason. Williams found out on the team plane en route to Philadelphia that he wouldn’t be allowed to suit up in Game 7.\n\nIt left a sour taste in Bucks' fans mouths when the franchise struggled to re-discover what it had in 2001. But at least for that night, Milwaukee was awash in good vibes.\n\nAllen opened up the second half with a three-pointer within the first 20 seconds, then added an old-fashioned three-point play off a breakaway to make it 66-33. The arena was once again up for grabs.\n\n\"We weren't worried about the refs and good calls or bad calls or any of that stuff,\" Bucks center Ervin Johnson said. \"We just wanted to go out and play in the flow of the game and do what we needed to do to win the game.\"\n\n\"What happened in Game 5, we let that go,\" Cassell said. \"People were trying to label us as whatever, but no matter what they say, we played hard. And we did it again.\"\n\nBucks hold off Iverson\n\nAllen Iverson, who had been MIA during Milwaukee's magical first half (shooting 6 of 16), whirred to life in the second and finished with 46 points. The 2001 NBA MVP spearheaded a 69-point effort for Philly overall in the second half. The Sixers got within 10 points but Robinson (22 points) and Johnson (8 points, 12 rebounds) helped keep Philadelphia at arm's length.\n\nBut it was probably a harbinger of gloom ahead. Milwaukee won Game 6 but dropped Game 7 two days later in Philly, 108-91.\n\nThat was despite 20-point performances from all three of Milwaukee's stars:\n\n» Robinson, the first overall pick in the 1994 draft out of Purdue.\n\n» Allen, drafted fifth overall by Minnesota in 1996 but acquired by Milwaukee in exchange for fourth pick Stephon Marbury and another first-round pick in 1998 (used to draft Rasho Nesterovic).\n\n» Cassell, also acquired via trade from the Timberwolves, this time in 1999 in a three-team trade.\n\nWith Karl as the architect, Milwaukee rode all three to impressive heights. But after winning 52 games in 2000-01, Milwakee only won 41 or 42 the next three years before dipping even lower.\n\n\"It's a great opportunity to represent Milwaukee,\" Karl said after Game 6. \"It's a great opportunity to represent the fans who have supported us unbelievably this year, and it's a great opportunity to play pride basketball.\n\n\"You don't get this opportunity very often.\"\n\nHow the moment lives on\n\nAs fun as it was, there's something unfulfilling about this memorable playoff run, starting with the obvious that the Bucks didn't win Game 7 nor another playoff series for the Bradley Center's life.\n\nOn February 20, 2003, the Bucks traded Allen, Ronald Murray, Kevin Ollie and a first-round pick in exchange for Desmond Mason and Gary Payton. There had been tension between Allen and Karl, but the trade was despised in the moment and outright crushed in the aftermath when Payton spent 28 unmemorable games in Milwaukee before leaving for the Lakers.\n\nMason spent four decent seasons with the Bucks, but nothing could replicate Allen, who was inducted into the Pro Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nThe 2001 series will always be associated with the \"conspiracy\" beliefs harbored by many fans. Milwaukee had gone 8-0 in 2000-01 against the four best teams in the Western Conference, including the eventual NBA champion Lakers, and it leaves many feeling like Milwaukee could have seriously contended to win the championship had it reached the finals.\n\nThe disappointments\n\nOur 50 in 50 has emphasized the great moments of the past 50 year in Wisconsin sports history. Where would you rank the Ray Allen trade among the most pivotal negative moments?\n\nMay 12, 1974: The Boston Celtics defeat the Bucks, 102-87, in Game 7 of the NBA Finals at the Milwaukee Arena.\n\nJune 16, 1975: With Kareem Abdul-Jabbar asking to go elsewhere, the Bucks trade the NBA's all-time leading scorer and Walt Wesley to the Lakers in exchange for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters and two draft picks (Dave Meyers and Junior Bridgeman).\n\nOct. 20, 1982: The Cardinals rally for three runs in the sixth and defeat the Brewers, 6-3, in Game 7 of the 1982 World Series. Milwaukee has not been back.\n\nOct. 30, 1993: Sixty-nine people are injured in a crush of bodies at Camp Randall Stadium after the Badgers beat Michigan.\n\nJanuary 25, 1998: The Packers become one of the biggest upset victims in Super Bowl history with a 31-24 loss to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXII.\n\nJuly 14, 1999: A giant crane collapses at construction for new Brewers stadium Miller Park, killing three workers and delaying the stadium's opening.\n\nSept. 30, 2000: Legendary Wisconsin distance runner Suzy Favor Hamilton drifts from the front of the pack and then falls – a stumble she later admitted was intentional – in the 1,500 meters final at the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.\n\nJuly 9, 2002: The MLB All-Star Game in Milwaukee ends in a tie.\n\nJanuary 11, 2004: On the cusp of a trip to the NFC Championship Game, the Packers allow Philadelphia to convert on 4th and 26 and tie the game on David Akers' field goal. Akers hit another in overtime to hand the Packers a 20-17 loss.\n\nJan. 20, 2008: Packers quarterback Brett Favre's final pass in a Green Bay uniform is a costly interception and the New York Giants shock the Packers in the NFC Championship Game, 23-20 in overtime. A messy divorce followed in which the Packers and Favre ultimately agreed to a trade to the New York Jets.\n\nSept. 24, 2012: The \"Fail Mary,\" a poorly adjudicated final play by replacement referees, allows Seattle to defeat Green Bay, 14-12. The play was the final NFL moment before the league came to a labor agreement with its regular referees.\n\nJuly 22, 2013: Brewers slugger Ryan Braun is suspended for the rest of the season, a 65-game ban tied to his violation of the game's drug agreement. Braun had first been suspended in 2012 for using performance-enhancing drugs but was able to get the initial suspension overturned on appeal, employing an approach that clouds his legacy today. Additional evidence led to the 2013 ban.\n\nJanuary 18, 2015: Brandon Bostick can't handle an onside kick, the highest profile of a series of errors that cost Green Bay a trip to the Super Bowl. Seattle won the NFC Championship Game in overtime, 28-22.\n\nApril 6, 2015: Justise Winslow touched it! The Badgers drop a 68-63 battle to Duke in the NCAA championship game.\n\nRules of the 50 in 50 series\n\nMoments are recorded over the 50-year window from 1970 to 2019 (sorry 2020, but you're disqualified)\n\nThese are moments and not achievements, although that largely goes hand-in-hand.\n\nThese are \"greatest\" 50 moments, so you won't see moments that are pivotal but ultimately heartbreaking (like the NFC Championship loss to Seattle, Kareem getting traded, etc.)\n\nYou also won't see (many) moments that came to be recognized for their greatness later, such as the day the Bucks drafted Giannis Antetokounmpo or the day the Packers traded for Brett Favre.\n\nMoments considered include teams based in Wisconsin and Wisconsin athletes competing in individual sports or as part of national teams (such as the Olympics), or moments on Wisconsin soil.\n\nThese are singular moments. You're supposed to remember where you were when they happened."
