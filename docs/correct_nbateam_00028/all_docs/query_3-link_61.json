        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nOne of the best and most well-rounded shooting guards in NBA history: an elite and record-setting 3-point shooter who was also a deft passer who took care of the basketball. Almost automatic on free throws. Mostly clutch, and could carry his team offensively for stretches. A winner. Wasn't much of a defensive playmaker (and didn't log a lot of steals for a guard) and could have been more of a rebounder. Not generally very durable."
