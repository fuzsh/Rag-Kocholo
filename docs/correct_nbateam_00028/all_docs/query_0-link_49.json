        "text": "Ray Allen says he doesn't want to do anything to diminish Paul Pierce's star in Boston. He feels he is just the kind of player who can help elevate it.\n\nAfter years of looking for another option to take the burden off Pierce, the Celtics acquired the seven-time All-Star in a five-player trade on draft night. But with two wing options used to being the focal point of their respective offenses, some worry there will suddenly be a shots crunch.\n\nAllen sees the pairing as a way to make getting shots easier for everyone.\n\n\"He is somebody I would say is one of the eight or nine best players in the league,\" Allen said of Pierce. \"I will look to do whatever I can to make him better and make this team better.\"\n\nThe 12-year veteran and former UConn star said at a press conference yesterday that, while he hasn't spoken with Pierce yet, he hopes to within the next couple of days and that he is happy the days of them being rivals are over. He referenced his time in Seattle with Rashard Lewis, and in Milwaukee with Sam Cassell and Glenn Robinson, as examples of how he tailored his game to improve the games of other celebrated scorers.\n\n\"When I played with Rashard, I knew what he could and couldn't do,\" Allen said. \"When I had the ball, I made sure I put him in situations where he could prosper. I will learn Paul's game and know where I can get him the ball.\"\n\nAllen, who averaged 21.0 shots per game last season in scoring a career-best 26.4 points through 55 games - before season-ending surgery on both ankles for bone spurs - knows there will be times when his primary role is to get Pierce (25.0 points on 18.1 shots over 47 games) the ball as often as possible.\n\n\"The players in this league - and Paul is one of those guys - who have the ability to score in bunches, you have to ride that and let that go,\" said the 31-year-old Allen, who proclaimed his ankles will be \"perfect\" after two months of recuperation. \"A lot of times you marvel at (Pierce) and his ability. That's my ability, to let him be who he is and me be who I am alongside him.\"\n\nCeltics executive of basketball operations Danny Ainge said having each other will help keep Pierce and Allen stay fresher as the season goes along - and should allow them to keep something in reserve for the defensive end of the court.\n\n\"It is hard work in the NBA to create offense,\" Ainge said. \"You watch tape of Ray and Paul and you see that the energy they expend to score a basket, or score six straight points, is ridiculous. Now they can share those responsibilities.\n\n\"In Detroit,\" he continued, \"they play what I call 'take turns basketball.' With us, Paul has had to go out and score all the time, every second of the game when he is on the court. He won't have to do that anymore.\"\n\nIn a star-driven league, though, teams are often classified as property of the franchise player. Allen, who gave up the No. 34 he shared with Pierce in favor of his old No. 20, said the key to making this marriage work is for all the players to have a stake in its success.\n\n\"I think you as the media will determine how you write your stories based on who's the man on this team,\" he said. \"My philosophy as a player is not to worry about it. What Paul does in the market is what he does. I hope to help him on the floor. Wherever that falls, it falls.\n\n\"Ego on my part, or any type of animosity, will cause this thing to cave,\" he added. \"In order for us to be great we have to exist together and help each other out.\""
