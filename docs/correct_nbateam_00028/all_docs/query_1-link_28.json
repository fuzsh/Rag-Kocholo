        "text": "Ray Allen's reserved seat was right below his retired No. 34 jersey. It was a perfect grace note to a college journey that began 30 years earlier.\n\nAllen, who started his Hall of Fame NBA career as a cornerstone for the Milwaukee Bucks, graduated from the University of Connecticut on Sunday with a degree in general studies.\n\nAllen left UConn after three seasons and became the fifth pick in the 1996 NBA Draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, though he was immediately traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for the fourth pick (Stephon Marbury) and a 1998 first-round pick that was later dealt back to Minnesota for center Andrew Lang.\n\nAllen played six-plus seasons with the Bucks, making three-all-star teams, authoring an unforgettable Game 6 performance in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2001 and becoming the franchise's all-time leader in 3-pointers made (since surpassed by Khris Middleton). His trade to Seattle in an exchange that brought Gary Payton back to Milwaukee in 2003 is regarded as one of the most hated trades in Wisconsin pro sports history.\n\nAllen played another 11 seasons after 2003, making seven all-star teams, winning two NBA championships and becoming the NBA's all-time leader in 3-pointers (since surpassed by Steph Curry).\n\n“It’s hard to really describe the feeling connected to it because it’s been a pursuit of mine for such a long time,\" Allen told Joe Arruda of the Hartford Courant. \"You start as a kid in elementary school and you’re just on this journey your whole life to try to graduate high school and then go to college. I loved my time here as a student-athlete. Fortunately and unfortunately for me, I had a higher calling at the time and it was sad for me because I left here and I really enjoyed being here as an athlete.\n\n“But there was always a stone left unturned for me to be able to graduate.”\n\nAllen said he'd been taking one course a semester even during the final years of his playing days but was spurred on toward completion thanks to the time afforded by the COVID-19 pandemic and seeing his daughter, Tierra, graduate from Quinnipiac.\n\nAllen, who wore the same jersey number that Giannis Antetokounmpo wears today, is the only men's basketball player to have his number retired at UConn.\n\nAllen attended at game at Fiserv Forum in April, when the Bucks distributed a bobblehead of his likeness.\n\n\"My only regret is that I didn’t do it sooner,\" Allen said about returning to Milwaukee. \"Because this place, it raised me. Still have good friends here. My family lived here. My extended family lived there for some time after I left.\""
