        "text": "Ten-time NBA All-Star Ray Allen, a two-time champion with the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat, will be enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame on Friday, and he tells The Athletic that he will not retire with one specific team.\n\nWhile Allen says he has reconciled his relationship with 2008 Finals MVP Paul Pierce, he does not believe he will talk to or receive a congratulatory message from any of his marquee teammates on the Celtics title team, such as Kevin Garnett and Rajon Rondo.\n\n“No, I don’t expect to,” Allen said.\n\nAllen is the NBA’s all-time leading 3-point shooter (2,973), a self-made star built upon his trademark work ethic. In a one-on-one with The Athletic leading up to his enshrinement, Allen discussed having Reggie Miller welcome him into the Hall; his work ethic, derived from his father Walter Allen and growing up in a military household; entering the NBA with the vaunted 1996 NBA draft class in the middle of a transitional era; his stints in Milwaukee, Seattle, Boston and Miami; today’s game and shooters; how close he ever was, or wasn’t, to making an NBA return after 2014; and his all-time favorite shooters and teammates.\n\nYou’ve chosen Reggie Miller to enshrine you on Friday — why and was Reggie surprised?\n\nI’ve always watched him and there’s been a hate-love relationship with Reggie. I appreciate what he’s done and his skill, but he was such a competitor that you wanted to root against him because he was playing against Michael Jordan, demolished the Knicks in eight seconds and single-handedly dismantled their defense. He’s had so many great moments in his career that I watched, so I was always competitive with it. As a player coming in, I just said, “Man, this is a guy that I somewhat want to be like.”\n\nReggie was really blown away and excited and appreciative. He said he would love to present me, that it was an honor, and for me it’s an honor to ask him. I’m in esteemed company because so many of these guys and ladies have had prestigious careers. Regardless if someone’s younger or older, we’re in the same class. It’s special. He’s set a bar that I didn’t know existed. When they told me that I was going to break the 3-point record, I didn’t know it was a thing. That isn’t something we can’t achieve if he doesn’t do what he does.\n\nWhat was the role your father, Walter, played in your work ethic?\n\nGrowing up in a military household, my dad went through working in military fatigues every day. He couldn’t just wake up one morning and say I can’t go to work. You have to get up and do your job. I always knew that I had to be accountable. Even when I didn’t want to, I have to step up and do your job.\n\nWere there other values entering the league?\n\nI didn’t play for accolades, and I didn’t play for money. I always knew that. I always felt it. It was about trying to really become great at this game and someone your team could count on. Values were important to me. It’s tough being around individuals that aren’t connected to anything. I want people that are connected because we all have higher callings. We all have people that we have to be accountable to. I like being around people of integrity. We get loose, but everyone knows their job because it’s not just about you. Life isn’t about one individual, this Earth isn’t about one individual. It’s about collectively, growing your community and leaving the world a better place. When people feel accountability, you see real magic start to happen.\n\nThat draft class — Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash — was one of the best ever. It was an era of transition, with Michael Jordan in the final couple years of his run with the Bulls. Is that how you guys felt coming in?\n\nWe were a product of the late ’80s and ’90s, MJ, Magic, Michael, Larry, Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson … I guess I could call it the NBA Jam era. You played with all those guys on a video game growing up. Larry Johnson, Penny Hardaway, Alonzo Mourning. We grew up idolizing those guys and wanted to be like them. When we came in, that was the age of superstardom starting to grow. It was hard-nosed, lunch-bucket basketball. When we came in the league, there was no easy way to go to the basket. You got knocked on your butt if you didn’t come correctly with it. We got drilled, and we learned and grew.\n\nThe number one key to being successful is being available. You can’t stick around and do anything if you don’t make yourself available to be out there. Eighteen years, I was able to touch different individuals and expand generations.\n\nAnd could still go today, right?\n\nPeople still look at me and say I could still play, saying “you got younger since I saw you last.” I look at my career as an education. Father Time is undefeated.\n\nMilwaukee, Seattle, Boston, Miami — is there a way to sum up the chapters of the book in your career?\n\nI compare it to playing Kung-Fu Fighters. You went through levels, people throwing knives at you, low kicks and high kicks, and at the end of every floor, you had to face some great kung-fu master. Once you beat him, then you went to the next level. That’s how my career was in each city. There were lessons that I needed to learn, and once I moved on, I had to reassess and figure out how I’m going to use lessons.\n\nIn Wisconsin, I grew and understood the NBA and how to be a professional. Then I go to Seattle, and basically get my own team. It’s like the captain in the navy, getting my own ship after a while because I had so much experience. That’s how it was in Seattle. Then I’m really at war in Boston, because we’re fighting for a championship. Miami was still war and so many challenges, being around younger stars that are equally as talented.\n\nHow was the Seattle chapter?\n\nI had the most fun in Seattle because I was around young guys who were really talented and loved to play. We just had to learn to win. The locker room was always fun and everyone appreciated each other. It was my most enjoyable years.\n\nCompared to Boston and Miami?\n\nWhen I get to Boston and Miami, it’s enjoyable, but so much more stressful because you’re expected to win and the pressure is on you. In Seattle, there were no expectations. We could have not made the playoffs every year, and people would have talked about us a little bit and it would have been over with. It was a little less stressful. In Boston, you lose one game and it was comparable to losing five.\n\nIt’s common knowledge that the relationship deteriorated with your old championship Celtics teammates after you left to join Miami in 2012. Where does that stand today?\n\nI talked to Paul a year ago today, and we patched it out. So much was made about my decision, and they were upset with me because I left for Miami. But it will never change what went on between us in 2008.\n\nAny communication with KG, Rondo, Glen Davis?\n\nNope.\n\nHow about shooters today, the game totally opening up?\n\nOne thing I always try to impart on them is focusing on their efficiency more than their volume. If you work on the ability to make shots more efficiently, you have an opportunity to have a greater impact. It’s a different league today. There are more 3-pointers shot now than when I came in.\n\nYou also played during the start of the rise of 3-pointers era of today. Could you see it coming in 1996?\n\nNo one could have seen it coming. There are some teams that shoot a lot of threes, shoot too many threes. I think some big men need to be playing on the block more because efficiency-wise, it gives you greater opportunity to score. It’s great to lean heavily on the 3-point shot, but I still believe you have to have a dose of scoring on the block as well.\n\nSome teams get too far gone … there aren’t many big men in the game now that can score. I believe you will see that take shape in the next couple of years, when bigs are going to plug holes again. There’s such an opportunity for them now.\n\nYour shooting allowed you to continue playing, so when you left in 2014 there had to be an opportunity to return?\n\nI was never close to coming back, man. Nobody presented anything tangible to make me question and say, “You know what: I like this opportunity, it’s sound, it makes sense. Let’s look at this.” Nobody did that. So I stayed retired. As much as I put in to being prepared, it’s tougher as an older player to stay ready because you get tight quicker. So I was curious what teams that wanted my services, if they were actually going to use me.\n\nSome teams were discussing having me at the end of the bench mentoring our younger players. I don’t think I wanted to come back like that. I wanted to play to help if I came back. Don’t look at me and tell me that I could still play. We want you to play, but we want you to sit on the bench and mentor the younger guys. What was tricky was, it was all about what a team would offer me financially, because that was their commitment to me that they were going to play me in their rotation because I can help them win.\n\nOh yeah, I can compete today. I’m so stubborn that I’ll run as much as I need to, to be in shape. Lift weights every single day before practice. Once I’m in it, I’m committed to it.\n\nWhich guys did you work closest with, giving knowledge out, when you played?\n\nMichael Redd is someone I’m most proud of. He was a second-round pick and not much was guaranteed to him. Same thing with Damien Wilkins. Damien was on the verge of being cut. I was proud to have those guys as teammates. They looked up to me and they wanted to have a piece of what I have, so to be able to mentor those guys and see them have great NBA careers is something I always appreciated. It’s something to have success yourself, but seeing them was special.\n\nFavorite teammate?\n\nToss-up between Sam Cassell and LeBron James. Sam was a guy you wanted to go to battle with. He wouldn’t quit on you and do whatever he could. He never wore bad body language. LeBron is a guy who you’ll have fun with, he’ll compete with you, but he is always one of the guys. He never made himself bigger than the next man.\n\nFavorite shooter — before you played, when you played and now?\n\nMichael Cooper. Dell Curry. Bradley Beal. I see myself a lot in Beal.\n\nAny regrets over your career?\n\nI didn’t know what winning a championship meant. So when I signed my five-year contract extension with Seattle [in 2005], I didn’t know what I was signing when it involved winning a title. That’s what our mission were supposed to be. I signed with the team hoping they gave me the best chance at winning. But I learned playing in Boston and Miami that we were just playing around in Seattle. I loved the team, I loved the city, but the organization, at the time, wasn’t serious. They weren’t putting anything in place to get us in title position. We would lose guys from the previous years based on playoff success.\n\nI would have thought more about leaving, and seeing who really was serious about winning. Now players have the power and control to make decisions to go wherever they want.\n\nHow Ray Allen remembers The Shot\n\nThe yellow ropes began to surround the court in Philadelphia in June 2001, and Ray Allen remembers time still remained in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals. He had led the Milwaukee Bucks to the brink of the NBA Finals, and 12 years later Allen found himself in the same position when the yellow tape and Larry O’Brien trophy was summoned to the floor of the Heat-Spurs Finals series in 2013. Allen still receives questions about The Shot — his 3-pointer from the right corner, across from the Heat bench, to tie Game 6 in the fourth quarter.\n\nAllen admits he hasn’t discussed The Shot much, which capped one of the most improbable victories in league history. First, Allen witnessed the yellow ropes and championship trophy being carted to the court with under a minute left in Game 6.\n\n“It hurt,” Allen told The Athletic. “It hurt so bad. I was angry. I was so pissed because the game wasn’t over with yet.”\n\nThe Heat called a 20-second timeout after Manu Ginobili’s free throws gave the Spurs a five-point lead with 28 seconds left. As Ginobili stepped to the line, the security staff inside American Airlines Arena kneeled down with the tape in their hands, preparing to step forward and shield the court for a championship celebration. LeBron James knocked down a 3-pointer to bring the Heat within two with 20 seconds, Kawhi Leonard went 1-of-2 at the foul line, and it all set up Ray Allen and possibly the shot of the decade.\n\n“I just remember 2001 when we lost to Philadelphia, the ropes came out and they celebrated the Eastern Conference championships early,” Allen said. “That was going through my mind watching the yellow ropes come out, and seeing the trophy …\n\n“I was so pissed because the game wasn’t over with yet. That’s what happened in 2013, too, when they were assuming that the Spurs were going to win. It was that same feeling that I had in 2001. It was anger. That’s why you just don’t give up and fight until the end.\n\n“I remember us never giving up, never letting our own arena feel we gave up.”\n\nIn his mind, there isn’t one favorite shot in his Hall of Fame 18-year NBA career, but how about The Shot?\n\n“I don’t rate my shots, but it was special,” Allen told The Athletic. “There are so many shots that I have been a part of. The shot is one thing, but I know what I have done to get in that position. The things that happen in practice mean more to me than anything. The games are what fans see, but practices are really how I was made.”\n\n(Top photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)"
