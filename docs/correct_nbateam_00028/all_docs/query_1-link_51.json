        "text": "Ray would probably be ahead a little more if he didn’t miss so much time in his 27-28 years. I thought his offensive game was a little more versatile since he was better at taking the ball to the rim, at least when he was younger and has less mileage on his legs.\n\nBut other than that, they are pretty similar. It was cool to see Reggie congratulate Ray at the game last night. Very sportsmanlike.\n\nThe eyes tell me that Ray Allen is smoother and generally had a weaker supporting cast around him than Reggie. They also tell me that Ray plays better on defense and is indeed more of a complete offensive player than Reggie. Not surprised at all that the numbers were so even, despite what the eyes say.\n\nAll that said, both will obviously be remembered as two all time snipers – but with Ray still going strong he might end overtaking Reggie in peoples eyes (and minds).\n\nHeresy from a Hoosier: Jesus was a better dribble drive player in his prime than Reggie. He could do an OK job of running the offense from the top. He still seems quicker than Reggie ever was. He can shoot while running near top speed better than anyone I’ve ever seen. During his best years Ray hit more 3s than Reggie’s best at similar or better percentage. e.g. Reggie only shot more than six 3s a game once; Ray did that 8 times. Usage/efficiency argument all over again I guess though.\n\nReggie had an edge about him…he played a little dirty. Used his elbows and knees, knicked his feet out on shots (which made the NBA change the rules iirc) and wasn’t above getting in scuffles. He made MJ fly off the handle, so that has to count for something. I also think he plays better than Ray on the road in big games, but I could be wrong.\n\nBut when the Pacers were at their best from 98-2000…was he even the fourth most productive player on the team?\n\nRandom observation (probably confirmation bias): ever since he’s been on the Celts, Ray is a laughably bad fast break player. He’s OK if someone passes it to him. But if he has the ball it’s gonna be a turn over or missed layup unless the other team bails him out or gets weird luck (like he’ll make a dumb pass, but it’ll somehow go off the other team’s leg and roll to an open team mate or something)."
