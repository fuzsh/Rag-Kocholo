        "text": "Before even Giannis Antetokounmpo picked No. 34 and made it an iconic number as the best Milwaukee Buck ever, there was once a player known as Ray Allen who made it a symbolic digit of his greatness and promise.\n\nWhile the Bucks record books tell that Allen has been part of their history for seven and a half seasons, his representation of Milwaukee remains unknown for many, even for some other unfamiliar Bucks fans.\n\nThis absence of regard made Allen even more elusive about his legacy as a Buck. In an interview a few years back, the sharpshooting legend dropped a swiping word against the team and its fandom that didn't even believe his sky-high potential at first.\n\nA subtle jab\n\nWhen he landed in Boston in 2007, Ray Allen quickly wore that utmost pride of being a Celtic – boasting an identity that beams a light full of history and success built by plenty of notable greats of the game. Years passed, and he eventually went on to help the franchise clinch its 17th title. His critical contribution convinced every C's fan to put him in the godly green club that is forever remembered with the likes of Bill Russell, Larry Bird, and many others.\n\nIn contrast, Allen notes a different side for Milwaukee, noting that the Bucks' icons aren't as much talked about as they must have been.\n\n\"I think about anything Larry [Bird] has done, that [Kevin] McHale has done, that Robert Parish has ever done, and they are icons forever in Boston,\" Ray said.\n\n\"You can accomplish great things in other cities, and the historians might take note, or the real sports junkies, but I was in Milwaukee for six and a half years, and Kareem [Abdul Jabbar] was the best player that franchise ever had outside of Oscar Robertson, and not a lot of people talk about either one of them... Here? You are immortalized.\"\n\nAppreciation for one of the forgotten Bucks legends\n\nThis statement is perhaps a tirade by Allen towards the Bucks and its fans who rode his brilliance during the early 2000s. Ray was once a beloved franchise centerpiece, a promisingly athletic two-guard who helped the squad obtain competitive relevance.\n\nWith him at the front alongside Sam Cassell and Glenn Robinson, the Bucks were just one win away from reaching the NBA Finals in the 2000-01 season.\n\nBut all of these great runs and representations were turned to ashes when both Allen and the Bucks had an ugly divorce. Years have passed, and the former form of Allen as a Buck has just faded away from the memories of many as the Hall of Famer is now relatively known for his past stints as a Celtic and a Miami Heat player.\n\nAs such, before everything ends, every Bucks fan has to give their flowers to Allen – a figure of their past relevance who helped pave the way for what the franchise is right now."
