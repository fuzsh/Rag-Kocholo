        "text": "Ray Allen has not played an NBA game for the past two seasons, but that fact is not keeping some NBA teams from considering signing the sharpshooter at age 41 for the 2016-17 NBA season.\n\nIn an interview with the Hartford Courant this weekend, Allen indicated the Celtics are one of the teams he’s talked to about a potential comeback.\n\nThe Spurs and Clippers have been mentioned, also, but Allen said he has spoken with the Celtics, with whom he won a championship in 2008, and the Bucks, his first NBA stop.\n\n“I would love going back to those places if it worked out,” Allen said, “because both teams are good, too. It doesn’t necessarily have to be championship-or-bust for me to go back to the NBA.\n\n“I want to be in a situation where I thought I could help, play a little bit and help where they have good young talent.”\n\nThere’s no question that the Celtics would still have use for the veteran shooting guard if he still has anything left in the tank. Boston finished 28th in the league in 3-point shooting percentage last season and Allen is a 40 percent career shooter from beyond the arc. In his final season at age 39, he still hit 37.5 percent of his attempts from 3-point range.\n\nThe Celtics currently have 18 players signed for next season’s roster but Danny Ainge can ink up to 20 players before the regular season cutdown date in October. The team also has the Room Level Exception for $2.9 million available for Allen, if needed.\n\nAllen last played for the Celtics in 2012. He turned down a two-year contract with the franchise that summer in order to sign with the rival Miami Heat for less money. The 10-time All-Star spent five of his 19 NBA seasons in Boston after being acquired in the summer of 2007 via trade."
