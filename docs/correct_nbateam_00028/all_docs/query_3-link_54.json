        "text": "There is an outbreak of the never-ending “Two Cultures” argument happening on social media over the last few days that seems even more aggressively stupid than usual. I flagged a bunch of tweets as things to comment on, but it’s a little too maddening for first thing Monday morning, so I’m going to go with something light and fun instead.\n\nThe weather forecast for Saturday was pretty dire, so I reserved an indoor batting tunnel for a half-hour at a place about half an hour away, so The Pip could get his daily swings in. This degenerated slightly because they had a three-wheel pitching machine, so we ended up spending some time dialing up weird-ass breaking balls that nobody playing 12U travel ball will have in their bag, but it was fun. On the way home, though, he posed a question that I’m borrowing for this post:\n\nHe initially phrased it as “same letter as your first name,” but this quickly expanded. So, for example, to use me as a starting point, the All-Time C-Initial All Stars would be (we decided after much discussion and some Googling):\n\nPG: Chris Paul\n\nSG: Clyde Drexler\n\nSF: Carmelo Anthony\n\nPF: Charles Barkley\n\nC: Chris Bosh\n\nFirst off the bench would be Chris Mullen, and I guess if you needed size you could go Carlos Boozer at the 5. That’s not a bad team, but it is weirdly loaded with guys in the “Best [position] Without a Ring” conversation.\n\nIf you wanted to go with The Pip, you could have the T-Initial All-Stars (his choices, not mine):\n\nPG: Tony Parker\n\nSG: Trae Young\n\nSF: Tracy McGrady\n\nPF: Toni Kukoc\n\nC: Tim Duncan\n\nAnd the P-Initial All-Stars:\n\nPG: Pete Maravich\n\nSG: Paul Pierce\n\nSF: Peja Stojaković\n\nPF: Pau Gasol\n\nC: Patrick Ewing\n\nOr, you could go with the first letter of his actual given name, rather than his nom du Net:\n\nPG: Damian Lillard\n\nSG: Dwayne Wade\n\nSF: Dominique Wilkins\n\nPF: Dirk Nowitzki\n\nC: David Robinson\n\nThose are all pretty solid collections of talent.\n\nThis is a fabulous sports-bar discussion topic, as it combines “Remember Some Guys” with the potential for silly legalistic arguments to try to make the strongest team possible. For example, do you count nicknames? If you do, you can put Manu Ginobili and Magic Johnson together with Michael Jordan on the M team; if not, they probably still end up together, but with Elgin Baylor. Go one way and you can put Bill Russell and Bob Cousy together on the B team, go the other and they’re split up to play with Wilt Chamberlain and Ray Allen.\n\n(The Pip’s other inspired suggestion was that Yao Ming could hold down the 5 for the M team, since “Yao” is his family name. If you count nicknames, it almost doesn’t matter who the fifth guy is at that point (Moses Malone, probably)…)\n\nThere’s also the question of alternate spellings and disused names: The Pip was pulling for putting Olajuwon on the A team since when he was younger most media spelled his first name without the H, but I’m dubious about that. Another list he Googled up (we are, unsurprisingly, not remotely the first people to think of this game) had the L team anchored by Lew Alcindor, which is definitely cheating…\n\nWe spent a bunch of time on this, and eventually decided that there seemed to be a clear winner for the best overall collection of talent (assuming you get players in their prime, and trying to put people at somewhat plausible positions). The likely champion of the All-Initial Team Tournament is the K Team:\n\nPG: Kobe Bryant\n\nSG: Kawhi Leonard\n\nSF: Kevin Durant\n\nPF: Kevin Garnett\n\nC: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\n\nThat’s a terrifying collection of talent. The best hope for any of the other letters would be that these are a bunch of kind of prickly personalities, so there’s a chance of a catastrophic collapse of chemistry leading to a complete meltdown. Otherwise, I don’t know what you do with these guys.\n\nAnyway, that was our Saturday diversion, which I offer up on Monday as a happier alternative to the stupid shit happening on social media. If you want to float some alternative teams— the whole point of this sort of exercise is to argue about the options, after all— the comments will be open:\n\nLeave a comment\n\nThis is not my usual line of content, but as I said, it was fun on Saturday and might help some other folks ease into the work week. If you want more of this down the road, or just hope to see me eventually respond to the stupid shit I referenced, here’s a button:"
