        "text": "Ray Allen is known for many things. Between 2011 and 2021, he was the NBA's all-time leader in three-pointers made. He won NBA championships with the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat in a decorated 19-year career that ended with a spot in the sport's Hall of Fame.\n\nBut on Sunday, the 47-year-old Allen accomplished a goal nearly 30 years in the making.\n\nAllen gets his bachelor's degree\n\nThis weekend saw Allen receive a degree in general studies from the University of Connecticut, where he played for the Huskies basketball team between 1993 and 1996.\n\nAllen declared for the NBA Draft after his junior season, then embarked on a wildly successful pro career -- which even included an acting role, as Allen portrayed high school basketball star Jesus Shuttlesworth in the 1998 film \"He Got Game.\"\n\nNow, nearly seven years after he announced his retirement, Allen has completed his studies at UConn and graduated with the class of 2023.\n\n\"It's never too late to learn\"\n\nSpeaking to the Hartford Courant, Allen explained his motivations for returning to school after so many years away.\n\n\"When I was in school there was a couple of RAs that were in their 30s and I thought, 'Wow, they're still in school.' It's never too late to learn,\" he said.\n\nDuring commencement, Allen took photos with fellow students, including one under his retired #34 jersey.\n\n\"This day isn't about me, it's about the people that helped me along the way to finish this mission, be on this journey to graduate from college. ...These kids are on their individual journeys, so I was so inspired to be sitting next to them and talking to them,\" he said."
