NBA teams are not allowed to sign free agents until Thursday.\n\nThe deal was first reported by ESPN.\n\nAllen, who turns 35 this month, averaged 16.3 points last season as the Celtics reached the NBA finals for the second time in three years. After Boston lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in seven games, Allen said, “It’s obvious I don’t want to be anywhere else.”\n\nAllen joined the Celtics in the summer of 2007, joining with Pierce to lure Garnett to Boston to form a new Big Three that won an NBA title in its first season together. The next year, with Garnett injured, the Celtics lost in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nWith the team struggling at the All-Star break this year, general manager Danny Ainge considered trading Allen and trying to make the team younger by rebuilding around point guard Rajon Rondo.
