        "text": "Winslow Townson\n\nRay Allen's legacy with the Boston Celtics might be a bit murky now — given both the way it ended and his still frosty relationship with some of his teammates. But there's no doubting that the sharpshooting guard put together quite the run during his five seasons on the parquet floor.\n\nAhead of his induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame on Friday, here’s a look back at Allen’s top 15 moments with the Boston Celtics.\n\nSteven Senne\n\n15. Allen arrives from Seattle - June 28, 2007\n\nIn a transformative 2007 offseason that saw the Celtics go from cellar dwellers to instant championship contenders, Allen was the first domino to fall in Danny Ainge’s grand plan.\n\nFollowing the disappointment of losing out on either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant in the 2007 NBA Draft, Ainge made his move — dealing the No. 5 overall pick (Jeff Green), Delonte West and Wally Szczerbiak to the Seattle Supersonics in exchange for Allen and the Sonics' 35th pick — which turned out to be Glen Davis.\n\nJust three days later, Ainge struck again — acquiring Kevin Garnett from the Timberwolves in a megadeal. The rest is history.\n\n“This is definitely a great opportunity, I’ve been in the league and I have a great respect for this organization,” Allen said. “I remember going back to the days when this organization battled against the Lakers and every time they came in here they were afraid to walk into the Garden, and I think those are the days we’re headed back to here. You know, an opponent walking into this building knowing that they have a lot to be afraid of, and not just from one position.”\n\nElise Amendola\n\n14. Allen buries the Bobcats in double overtime - April 1, 2009\n\nWith Kevin Garnett still hampered due to a knee injury, the Celtics were pushed to the brink against a Bobcats squad on their home court, trailing, 109-108, in the closing seconds of double overtime.\n\nUltimately, an unguarded Allen provided the heroics — drilling a trey in the right corner with 2.1 seconds to go to close out the 111-109 win for Boston.\n\nMatt Slocum\n\n13. Allen sinks buzzer-beater in Philly - Feb. 3, 2009\n\nBefore Kevin Garnett’s season was sidelined by a knee injury in late February, the 2008-09 Boston Celtics were an absolute wagon — opening their defense of an NBA championship with a dominant 44-11 record.\n\nAlong the way, Boston posted win streaks of both 19 and 12 games over the first four months of the season.\n\nAllen helped cap Boston’s 12-game win streak in dramatic fashion against the 76ers out on the road — drilling a 3-pointer over Thaddeus Young with 0.5 seconds remaining to erase a 99-97 deficit and clinch a 100-99 victory.\n\nOh, what could have been with that team.\n\nMike Ehrmann\n\n12. Allen forces overtime in Miami - May 30, 2012\n\nEven in games where his shooting stroke went cold, you could still always count on Allen to at least sink one or two big baskets when needed.\n\nLook no further than Game 2 of the 2012 Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat. Allen finished 5-of-11 from the field with 13 points, but he delivered in a big moment — sinking a 3-pointer with 34 seconds to go to force overtime.\n\nDespite Allen’s clutch shot — and a dominant 44-point showing from Rajon Rondo — the Heat held on for the win on home court, 115-111.\n\nElsa\n\n11. Allen hits first game-winner with Celtics - Nov. 4, 2007\n\nIt didn’t take long for Celtics fans to realize what Ray Allen could bring to the 2007-08 Celtics.\n\nIn just his second game with Boston, Allen delivered in crunch time — with the Celtics tied, 95-95, with the Raptors in the closing seconds of overtime.\n\nFreeing himself from a pursuing Raptor off a pick, Allen collected an inbound feed from Paul Pierce and calmly buried his shot from beyond the arc, giving Boston a dramatic 98-95 victory.\n\nNick Laham\n\n10. Allen sinks 8 3-pointers against Knicks in Game 3 - April 22, 2011\n\nThe Knicks never had a chance in this series, did they?\n\nAlready trailing 2-0 in the first round of the 2011 NBA Playoffs, New York was shellacked by Boston at MSG — with Allen drilling eight 3-pointers in what was a 113-96 win.\n\nAllen finished 8-for-11 from behind the arc and tallied 32 points in the win, complimenting a 38-point showing from Paul Pierce and a triple-double from Rajon Rondo. During the four-game series against New York, Allen sank 17 treys and shot 65.4 percent from 3-point range.\n\nElsa / Getty Images\n\n9. Allen sinks Knicks in Game 1 - April 17, 2011\n\nWell, that’s one way to kick off a postseason run.\n\nLeading for a grand total of 60 seconds in the second half against the Knicks, the Celtics still managed to hang on for a win in their postseason opener — with Allen once again leading the charge.\n\nAlong with a team-high 24 points, Allen gave Boston the lead for good, sinking a go-ahead 3-pointer with 12 seconds left in the fourth to close out an 87-85 victory. Boston ultimately swept the Knicks in the first round of the 2011 postseason.\n\nStreeter Lecka\n\n8. Allen takes down the Bobcats (again) - Nov. 24, 2007\n\nFor the second time in his first month with the Celtics, Allen made another team pay in crunch time.\n\nDown by two with just over three seconds to play, Paul Pierce started off the sequence by tipping a Charlotte pass and coming away with the steal. With barely any time to react, Pierce fed the ball to a waiting Allen from deep.\n\nAs expected, Allen connected — giving Boston a dramatic 96-95 win at the buzzer.\n\nLisa Blumenfeld\n\n7. Allen makes nasty reverse layup in Game 4 comeback vs. Lakers - June 12, 2008\n\nWho could forget this game?\n\nTrailing 35-14 after the first quarter of Game 4 of the 2008 NBA Finals, the Celtics seemed primed to settle for a 2-2 series deadlock against the Lakers. But bit by bit, Boston chipped away at the deficit, orchestrating a 22-3 run in the second half and eliminating a 24-point deficit for one of the biggest comebacks in postseason history.\n\nAllen, who finished with 19 points in the win, helped build Boston’s slim lead in the closing minutes of the fourth with this slick move, going baseline and blowing past Kobe Bryant before finishing a tough reverse layup just past the reach of Pau Gasol.\n\nThe clutch bucket gave Boston an 86-83 lead with 3:18 left — a slim bit of breathing room ahead of the 97-91 final.\n\nJed Jacobsohn\n\n6. Allen cooks Sasha Vujacic, clinches Game 4 win over Lakers - June 12, 2008\n\nAllen’s reverse layup gave Boston some breathing room in Game 4, but this bucket essentially put a nail in the Lakers’ coffin in the 2008 NBA Finals.\n\nWith Boston holding a 94-91 lead with 22.5 seconds to go in Game 4, Allen matched up against Sasha Vujacic — blowing past the Lakers guard and banking in a layup off the glass to put an end to any whispers of a LA comeback.\n\nAllen did not sit for a single second during Boston’s Game 4 comeback over the Lakers, which served as the backbreaker for the Celtics’ postseason foe.\n\nChris Carlson\n\n5. Allen sets Finals record from deep - June 6, 2010\n\nAfter a lackluster showing in Game 1 of the 2010 NBA Finals (12 points, 0-2 from 3-point range, 27 minutes), Allen bounced back in a major way days later.\n\nBoston evened the best-of-seven series with the Lakers in Game 2, 103-94, with Allen setting an NBA Finals record with eight 3-pointers. Allen connected on seven of his treys in the first half, finishing with a game-high 32 points.\n\nAllen’s Finals record lasted for eight seasons, as Steph Curry sank nine treys in a 122-103 win over the Cavaliers in Game 2 of the 2018 NBA Finals.\n\nWinslow Townson\n\n4. Allen drops seven 3-pointers, helps Celtics clinch Banner 18 - June 17, 2008\n\nIn what was an anticlimactic end to the 2008 NBA Finals, the Boston Celtics annihilated the Lakers in Game 6 at TD Garden, clinching their 18th championship off of a convincing 131-92 result.\n\nJust about every player on the Celtics’ roster contributed in the blowout win, with Allen sinking seven 3-pointers and scoring 26 points — tying Kevin Garnett for the team lead in points.\n\nDuring the 2008 NBA Finals, Allen averaged 41 minutes and 20.3 points per game while knocking down 22 3-pointers.\n\nCharles Krupa\n\n3. Allen beats Bulls in Game 2 - April 20, 2009\n\nThe 2009 first-round matchup between the Chicago Bulls and KG-less Celtics was downright bananas — and might be one of the most impressive stretches in Ray Allen’s storied career.\n\nAllen was a force in the seven-game series, averaging 23.4 points and 40 minutes per game while knocking down 27 3-pointers.\n\nAfter dropping Game 1 at home against the seventh-seeded Bulls, Allen and the Celtics faced the dire scenario of heading to Chicago down 0-2 — with both teams locked in a 115-115 deadlock in the closing seconds of Game 2.\n\nBut Allen was there to bail out the Celtics, sinking a buzzer-beater to clinch the 118-115 victory for Boston. After tallying just four points in Game 1, Allen scored a team-high 30 in Game 2.\n\nEven after this performance, Allen was far from finished in this series.\n\nJonathan Daniel\n\n2. Allen drops 51 points in triple-overtime thriller vs. Bulls - April 30, 2009\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves: 58 minutes, 51 points, nine 3-pointers.\n\nWhile the Celtics ultimately came up short in an absurd triple-overtime thriller against the Bulls in Game 6, 128-127, Allen put together one of the most impressive postseason performances in Celtics history, knocking down half of his shots from 3-point range and keeping Boston in the fight.\n\nIt wasn’t just the way that Allen torched the Bulls all night long, but also the timing of his baskets. None were as big as in the final seconds of double overtime, with Allen drilling a three over Kirk Hinrich’s face to force yet another stretch of OT play.\n\nElise Amendola\n\n1. Allen becomes NBA’s 3-point king - Feb. 10, 2011\n\nIt was with the Celtics that Allen became the NBA’s new record holder for career 3-pointers made, surpassing Reggie Miller with a trey against the Lakers on Feb. 10, 2011.\n\nAllen, who will be formally inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield Friday night, closed out his impressive NBA career with 2,973 made 3-pointers."
