        "text": "Welcome to the NBA 75, The Athletic’s countdown of the 75 best players in NBA history, in honor of the league’s diamond anniversary. From Nov. 1 through Feb. 18, we’ll unveil a new player on the list every weekday except for Dec. 27-31, culminating with the man picked by a panel of The Athletic NBA staff members as the greatest of all time.\n\nWhen the man who laid claim at the time to the title of “Greatest Shooter In the World” rose from the corner and flicked his right wrist to let fly one of the most clutch shots in NBA history, there wasn’t a soul in the Miami Heat’s arena who didn’t think it was going to fall — except for Walter Ray Allen.\n\nAllen’s 18-year career was defined by his relentless, borderline-maniacal preparation. His meticulous pregame routine was the stuff of legend. His practice regimen was constructed around the goal of committing to muscle memory any possible sequence that would lead to him with the ball in his hands and the game on the line. He had taken thousands upon thousands of those corner 3s in his life, in games, in practices, at the park. Of all of the shots that he let fly over the years, that one in the closing seconds of Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs felt … off.\n\n“I remember the ball left my fingertips, and it floated different from any other time,” Allen told The Athletic. “It felt like it was low, like it wasn’t going to make it.”\n\nFrom the media section high above the court and on the opposite end of the arena from where Allen’s shot unfolded, it looked perfect. His footwork was balletic, tiptoeing from the paint back to the corner once he saw that Chris Bosh was in position to grab the offensive rebound of LeBron James’ miss, making sure that his toes were behind the 3-point line and his heels were in front of the sideline. His posture was flawless — back straight, shoulders square, elbow at a perfect 90 degrees — as he took the pass from Bosh and rose in one motion. The arc of the shot, while flat to Allen, looked as if the ball was an arrow off an archer’s bow headed straight for the target.\n\nThe noise in the arena, in the stands and on the court was cacophonous in the moments before Allen’s shot. James, Bosh, Dwyane Wade and the defending champions were down, 95-92, in the game and down, 3-2, in the best-of-seven series. They were on the ropes, quite literally. The league and arena security had yellow ropes around the baseline to keep fans off of the court while they readied for a trophy presentation to the Spurs. Some Heat fans were streaming toward the exits. Mario Chalmers took the inbound and headed up the court, and you could feel the desperation in the Heat and a fan base stunned to be in this position.\n\nWhen James rose to take the first 3 of the possession, there was a collective shriek in the crowd as if everyone knew it was all slipping away. But as the ball found Allen in the corner, there was an entirely different feeling that was easy to detect from those seats, which were practically embedded in the crowd behind the Spurs’ basket. It was hope.\n\nThe Heat got Allen for just this moment. He came to Miami to do exactly this and was (and still is, for the moment) the NBA’s career leader in 3-pointers made. Allen made 42 percent of his 3-pointers in his first season for the Heat, in 2012-13, and 40 percent in his career. At that moment, the crowd drew in its collective breath because it could not believe that Allen was going to fail them.\n\nIf it looked frantic on the court from afar as the Heat scrambled to extend the game, in Allen’s mind, it was quiet.\n\n“If I can just describe everything around me, it was like everything had stopped. There was no noise,” Allen said. “Then the ball goes through the net, and there’s just this roar of excitement and thunder.”\n\nThe shot didn’t win the game, but few had higher stakes. Miss, and the mighty Heat — that team that was assembled to win “not three, not four, not five” championships — may have only won one in the James-Wade-Bosh era. When it splashed through, the Spurs looked like they had seen a ghost, a team so resilient and professional that could not recover. The Heat won Game 6 in overtime and then prevailed in Game 7 in Miami to clinch their second title. San Antonio would exact revenge the next season, but the victory preserved back-to-back titles for James and the Heat, allowing that group to reach a different plane in the league’s hierarchy of champions.\n\nAllen checks in at No. 52 on The Athletic’s list of the NBA’s 75 greatest players, one of the purest shooters the game has ever seen, with mechanics that were born out of two things: repetition and fear. The same doubt that was in the back of Allen’s head when he let that shot go in Game 6 is what drove him to become the best shooter in the league during his nearly two decades with the Bucks, SuperSonics, Celtics and Heat.\n\n“To be told you’re one of the 75 greatest of all time, it’s like, man, I felt that I was not that good, and that’s why I had to work so much harder throughout my career,” Allen said of being named to the NBA’s 75th-anniversary team. “Being announced in that Top 75 was validation for all that work. It taught me that you were doing what you were supposed to be doing.”\n\nThroughout his playing career, Allen operated as if his secret was about to be discovered at any moment. That he was not good enough, that he could not play, that he did not deserve to be on this stage getting these shots.\n\n“If you delve deep into the psyche of a lot of people who have achieved greatness in their life, whether in professional sports or entertainment, there is that insecurity that you feel you don’t belong,” Allen said. “That’s why you find a way to work, because you feel like you’re not going to measure up.”\n\nSo he worked for hours and hours, intent on proving to himself that he was worthy of the platform. The result was 2,973 career 3-pointers made in the regular season, another 385 made in 11 playoff runs, 10 All-Star appearances and two titles, one that restored the Boston Celtics to the NBA’s elite and the one that cemented the Heat’s legacy. While Allen was piling up all of those accolades, that fear of falling short sat on his shoulder the whole way.\n\n“Even in the games, if I don’t play well today, they’re going to find out that I’m not that good,” Allen said. “That makes you overprepare. At no point do you ever think you’re that good. Because if you think you’re that good, then you stop working.”\n\nHe has been on top of the 3-point mountain since surpassing Reggie Miller in 2011, but those days were numbered. Warriors star Stephen Curry has usurped Allen as the man widely believed to be the best shooter ever.\n\n“I did my part,” Allen said. “He’s carved out a channel of his own with the way he shoots the ball and how great he’s been.”\n\nHe is at peace with what he did then and now. In retirement, Allen wrote a book entitled “From the Outside” and has been a vocal advocate for players taking control of their own stories. He tells every player he comes across to write a book of their own to give their perspectives on their careers. He is active on Instagram, going down memory lane with basketball and preparation occasionally but also addressing topics of social justice, inequity in the criminal justice system and advocating for people of color.\n\n“As a Black man in America, this is my country. I love it. And I fight for it, and I speak out for it,” Allen said. “That doesn’t mean because I don’t like something that’s going on that I’m going to leave. That’s what’s great about this country is you can speak out about things you don’t agree with.”\n\nCurry will pass Allen in the record books, but Allen occupies a place in the fabric of the game that is indelible. Not just for the shot against the Spurs, not just for the titles with the Celtics and the Heat or all of those 3s. In some ways, his NBA life can take a back seat to his basketball exploits on the silver screen.\n\nHis role as Jesus Shuttlesworth in Spike Lee’s movie “He Got Game” elevated Allen to another level in the hoops consciousness. The 1998 film examined the recruiting process and all the pitfalls much earlier than it had entered into the public discourse — and, to this day, is a movie referenced by players who have come up through the ranks to the NBA.\n\nThe climactic scene features Jesus in a one-on-one game against his father Jake (played by Denzel Washington), who was temporarily released from prison to try to convince Jesus to commit to play college ball at Big State, a decision that would have earned Jake early parole. The scene initially called for an 11-0 wipeout by Jesus, but Washington started hitting shots during the filming.\n\n“It was almost like he had the wind gods with him that day; he was way out, and he would shoot it, and the ball would hit the backboard and go in,” Allen said.\n\nAllen needed no such mystical help when the ball was in his hands. The work he put in, the fear of falling short and the determination to prove that he belonged were more than enough.\n\nCareer stats: G: 1,300, Pts.: 18.9, Reb.: 4.1, Ast.: 3.4, FG%: 45.2, FT%: 89.4, Win Shares: 145.1, PER: 18.6\n\nThe Athletic NBA 75 Panel points: 357| Hollinger GOAT Points*: 80.9\n\nAchievements: Two-time All-NBA; 10-time All-Star, 3-pointers made champ (’02, ’03, ’06), NBA champ (’08, ’13), Hall of Fame (’18); NBA 75 team (’21)\n\n*A rating of a player’s accumulated accomplishments at the highest levels, based mostly on comparable historical factors, determined heavily but not completely by contemporary evaluations (i.e. awards and All-Star selections).
