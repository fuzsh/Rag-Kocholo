For five seasons, the Boston Celtics’ lineup featured the championship-winning trio of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen. During the summer of 2012, Allen decided to sign with the Miami Heat.

Allen’s departure from Boston added fuel to the Celtics-Heat rivalry. It’s reported that Garnett and Pierce were not on good terms with the 10-time All-Star for several years.

As captured by the Dan Le Batard Show, Pierce discussed what created tension between the Celtics and Allen.

“Before the series was over, we heard Ray Allen was already looking for houses in Miami… while we were trying to beat them to go to the championship… he didn’t tell us, warn us, or give us a phone call.”

Pierce felt betrayed by his former teammate.

“You go to war with your brothers, and you do family stuff with them… then next thing you know, you go to the team we’re trying to beat and you don’t even tell us… that did feel like a betrayal.”
