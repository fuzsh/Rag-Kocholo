Dedicated to his work but at the same time devoted to his loyal girlfriend, Tess Trueheart, Tracy finds himself torn between love and duty. His relentless crusade against crime becomes even more difficult when he gets saddled with an engaging orphan and meets seductive and sultry Breathless Mahoney, a torch singer determined to get the best of Tracy. A faceless character, the Blank, threatens both Tracy and Big Boy, and it takes all of Tracy’s skills to save the city. Released on June 15, 1990. Directed by Warren Beatty. A Touchstone film. 105 min.
