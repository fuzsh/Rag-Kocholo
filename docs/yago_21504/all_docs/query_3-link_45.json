        "text": "Dick Tracy is a 1990 comic-book film made by Touchstone Pictures (a division of Disney), based on the comic-strip franchise of the same name. It has backstory and developmental connections to the history of the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.\n\nSummary[]\n\nThe movie takes place in the fictional city of Homeville, U.S.A. in the year 1938. The plot revolves around police-detective Dick Tracy in a game of cat-and-mouse with various grotesque mobsters lead by the evil crime-lord, Alphonse “Big Boy” Caprice.\n\nTower of Terror connections[]\n\nFiddler, Fifer & Practical Cafe[]\n\nIn this cafe there is a poster for Big Boy Caprice's nightclub the Club Ritz, advertising the Silver Lake Sisters as performing there. The poster features silhouettes of various gangsters from the film, the most recognizable of whom being Flattop.[1]\n\nSunset Boulevard[]\n\nDisney over-estimated the planned success of Dick Tracy, largely due to its prolific promotional campaign and visible influence from the classic 1989 film Batman. Due to this, the movie was planned to have park tie-ins at Disney's MGM Studios (later renamed to Disney's Hollywood Studios), including a shooting-attraction on Sunset Boulevard known as, \"Dick Tracy's Crime-Stoppers\". The underwhelming reception of the film in-addition to concerns about Disney having a ride revolving around playing as a cop shooting people resulted in the attraction being scrapped, contributing to the development of the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.\n\nSunset Boulevard did however feature the, \"Dick Tracy Diamond Double Cross\", a live-show themed to the film and hosted in the Theatre of the Stars venue. This coincided with multiple characters from the film making live appearances at Disney's Hollywood Studios. This show lasted in Walt Disney World from the May of 1990 to the February of 1991.\n\nOther connections[]\n\nDisney's Hollywood Studios[]\n\nIn the Backlot Tour there was a poster on the wall, promoting District Attorney Fletcher for mayor.[2] In the film, Fletcher was a corrupt DA working for Big Boy Caprice while running for mayor only to be murdered by the Blank.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nDick Tracy and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1989) are both Touchstone Films which were planned to have larger influences on Sunset Boulevard and Disney's Hollywood Studios, contributing to Tower of Terror history.\n\nThe Club Ritz and South Seas Club from the Rocketeer are both fictional 1930s nightclubs from 1990s films based on comics which the Fiddler, Fifer & Practical Cafe has posters identifying the Silver Lake Sisters as having performed in.\n\nGallery[]"
