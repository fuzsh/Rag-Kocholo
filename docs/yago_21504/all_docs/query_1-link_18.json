        "text": "A decade has passed since my initial stab at a post on Warren Beatty (b. 1937). It is focused on one of his more obscure movies, Mickey One (1965) mostly because this blog was narrowly focused on show business per se back then, and in Mickey One he plays a hack comic in the Milton Berle mold, Since then, we have also had occasion to write about several of his other pictures to one degree or another: Splendor in the Grass (1961), The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1961), All Fall Down (1962), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971), The Parallax View (1974), Shampoo (1975), Heaven Can Wait (1978), Ishtar (1987), and Dick Tracy (1990). Please read these posts! The wild thing is, in a career spanning over 60 years (though he’s been mostly retired for over 20 of them) he made fewer than two dozen movies. That is incredibly few! But on the positive side, that also means it’s practicable to touch on about just about all of them.\n\nBeatty, as most people know, is the kid brother of Shirley MacLean. The siblings grew up in Virginia. A good looking, studly football player, he came to New York to study with Stella Adler right around the time his sister was beginning her screen career in Hitchcock’s The Trouble with Harry (1955). His best performances, one finds, are his naturalistic ones, just as he was taught. But he is clearly infatuated with straight-up show business, it crops up in several of his best known films, though when he tries to “go big” performance-wise, the results are not as fortunate.\n\nHe began his career with an extended William Inge period. He was in the original Broadway production of A Loss of Roses (1959), followed by the aforementioned Splendor in the Grass, and All Fall Down (1962). The Inge connection is interesting in light of the fact that the woman he eventually married, Annette Bening, is a Kansas Girl. During the Inge period he was also in The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone, adapted from a Tennessee Williams novel, not a huge leap from Inge. The directors of these early pictures were no lesser lights than Elia Kazan, Jose Quintero, and John Frankenheimer. The first two were giants in the theatre, the latter one was big in live TV dramas. As a side note, we should mention that Beatty initially dabbled in television as well. He guested on Playhouse 90 and similar shows, and had a recurring part as a snooty rich kid on The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959-60), excellent audience preparation for his first movie role in Splendor.\n\nBeatty retained his association with theatrical people over his next couple of films. The dated curiosity Lilith (1964), about a psychiatric worker’s fascination with a damaged patient (Jean Seberg), was the last film of Robert Rossen, who also wrote the screenplay, adapted from a novel. This was followed by Mickey One (1965, directed by Arthur Penn), and Promise Her Anything (1966), an early film of Arthur Hiller, written by William Peter Blatty. Jack Smight, fresh off of Harper (1966) with Paul Newman, directed Kaleidoscope (1966), the last offering of Beatty’s formative period.\n\nThus far, Beatty had succeeded in becoming a likeable and popular star, about on par with, say, George Hamilton, but little more. It was at this stage that he took the initiative on a gambit that not only elevated his own career, but transformed Hollywood. It’s usual for many who write and talk about New Hollywood to privilege directors. Beatty of course also became a director later but the big shift came when he decided to produce some (later all) of his own pictures as many of the top stars such as Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas were doing. Thus it was Beatty, as opposed to Arthur Penn (who had been hired by Beatty and was working for him as an employee), who was the true motive force behind the crucial New Hollywood film Bonnie and Clyde (1967). The actor-producer-director is an interesting phenomenon, one close in spirit to the old actor-managers of the 19th century. For some strange reason, we continue to regard them primarily as actors, and tend to short change their roles as producers, directors, and screenwriters. But they are bigger than actors. In most Hollywood films, actors are cogs. They hit their marks when told to, and try to give someone else what they want. Beatty, however, is a film-maker, a film-making star. That’s how he ought to be regarded.\n\nThat said, after the smash success of Bonnie and Clyde, Beatty didn’t immediately jump into doing similar projects with the same formula. He was probably exhausted. His next film wasn’t for three years, and he went back to being a jobbing actor for the next eight years. Only two of those films took flight, Robert Altman’s McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971) and Alan J. Pakula’s The Parallax View (1974). Two others have been swallowed up by time, but have their interesting points. The Only Game in Town (1970), a two-hander with Elizabeth Taylor, was the last movie directed by George Stevens. The heist comedy $ (1971) with Goldie Hawn, written and directed by Richard Brooks, did okay at the time, but is essentially forgotten fluff (not helped by the puzzle of how to spell its title, which is also sometimes rendered as $ (Dollars), Dollar$, or just Dollars, and in the UK, the much more sensible The Heist.\n\nWith Shampoo (1975), directed by Hal Ashby, Beatty really began his ascension to auteur status. Going forward the only films he did without producing, directing of co-writing as well were his next one, Mike Nichols’ interesting failure The Fortune (1975), and the even bigger financial flop Town and Country (2001). And at this juncture, we enter the the post Spielberg and Lucas phase of the new Hollywood era, which might be called the Neo-Classical Period. Going forward, most of Beatty’s completed films are in some sort of dialogue with the Classic Studio Era. Heaven Can Wait (1978), co-directed with Buck Henry and co-written with Elaine May, is a remake of Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), merged with Beatty’s own past as a football player.\n\nNext came his probable masterpiece Reds (1981), a romantic historical epic in the tradition of David Lean’s Dr. Zhivago (1965), intercut with documentary interview footage with actual historical figures. I will inevitably give this movie its own post — I rewatched it recently and it has much to commend it.\n\nAfter Reds, Beatty contemplated making a comedy about a man who falls in love with a mermaid, to be directed by Herbert Ross, but they were beaten to the finish line by Ron Howard’s Splash (1984). Then, since he’d had such a good experience with Elaine May on Heaven Can Wait, came the disaster of Ishtar (1987). I tried to rewatch this one again recently too, but (as on previous occasions) I could not get all the way through it. After this he worked a bit on developing a bio-pic about Edie Sedgwick starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, I’m assuming based on the Jean Stein–George Plympton book, but it died on the vine. Al Pacino was to play Warhol!\n\nThen Beatty had another big success with Dick Tracy (1990), based on the old comic strip. As I wrote here, I’m not a huge fan of the movie, for many reasons. He had an affair with Madonna, who played Breathless Mahoney, during this period. There is documentary evidence of it in the 1991 rockumentary Truth or Dare — you can see and hear Warren hovering around the edges in a couple of scenes. He makes a fairly cutting remark at one point about her self-involvement as I recall. They broke up soon after. Then came Beatty’s last unqualifiedly excellent movie Bugsy (1992), directed by Barry Levinson — which I ALSO rewatched recently! No wonder I’m writing this post. That one will also get its own post in a few months (on Bugsy Siegel’s birthday, natch). A lot of Hollywood glamor in that one, too. The sparks flew between Beatty and co-star Annette Bening. The pair married the following year and have been one of the top Tinseltown couples ever since. (Sorry, am I beginning to channel Robin Leach?)\n\nAs good as Bugsy is, I was fairly mortified when Beatty and Bening co-starred in Love Affair (1994) and never even considered watching it — it seemed pretty self-indulgent, and he seemed too old. Having learned now that the film is a remake of well known films made in 1939 and 1957, and that Beatty had been obsessed with the original version since he was a kid, I’m willing to give it a shot some time. I did, however see Bulworth (1998) when it came out and found that hip hop stuff and the on-the-nose middle-brow political messaging fairly mortifying. There are those who give it respect, but to me it seemed like the work of an out-of-touch sexagenarian trying to connect with the youth.\n\nI don’t know that Beatty specifically set out to retire after this, but the 1,2,3 failures of Love Affair, Bulworth, and Town & Country surely set him back on his heels. In the new century, there was chatter about sequels to Bulworth and Dick Tracy (and he did make some weird appearances in little TV sketches as Tracy for screenings on TCM, the latest as recently as last year). At one point, he was attached to Megalopolis. He was also developing a movie based on the same book that eventually became Steven Soderbergh’s Liberace bio-pic Behind the Candelabra. And there were several other projects. Finally in 2016, at the age of 79, Beatty re-emerged with Rules Don’t Apply (2016) in which he played Howard Hughes. It, too, fared terribly at the box office. He had been working on the project since the 1970s.\n\nWhile Beatty’s track record in turning out blockbusters is impressive, he also has made a surprisingly large numbers of flops or turkeys or whatever you want to call them. Nearly half of his movies were disasters of one kind another, typically on a rather massive scale. The operative phrase is, I think, is that he’s a “risk taker”. Some of them score, some of them don’t, but as most other commercial producers never seem to learn, it’s risks that generate rewards. I much prefer that spirit than the shooting-fish-in-a-barrel MCU approach to picture making."
