        "text": "Hey folks, Harry here... Now, it's a bit of a loss leader saying he'll ever make this, Warren Beatty doesn't NEED to work, so he rarely gets around to it. He enjoys life, always has. It's sort of why I love Warren Beatty. He's a definite character. And while he's been talking about doing a HOWARD HUGHES movie forever... we've still yet to see that one, but at CinemaCon he mentioned a serious desire to do a sequel to his 4 Color Comic Strip adaptation of DICK TRACY from 1990.\n\nI know, people thought he was too old to play DICK TRACY back in 1990. They were wrong. And before you start pointing out that Warren Beatty is currently 79, I might have to ask you... how much do you know about Dick Tracy. Chester Gould, the creator of Dick Tracy, drew the strip from 1931 to 1977... Tracy wasn't frozen in time like so many characters. Gould adapted the Tracy family and clan. Even having a granddaughter on the Moon colony. The first DICK TRACY film was very faithful to the silliness of Tracy's early career, but twenty years later - or 25 or 30 knowing Beatty - he could go retro-sci-fi with his DICK TRACY, which would still be a future for us, given Dick Tracy had Moon activity before we did. And certainly much more advanced. Beatty should cast Domhnall Gleeson as the adult Junior Tracy, who would marry a Moon maid and have a baby called Honey Moon, I have this doll - which has MAGNETIC HANDS, just like the character in the newstrip - and kids would love today. (maybe) Especially with those adorable antennae.... Antennae are so cute on babies!\n\nNow - allegedly we'll be seeing this HOWARD HUGHES film this Fall, so could Beatty really pull together the financing for a big DICK TRACY film - illustrating a different period in the great character's career - allowing his Tracy to be a Grandfather? I kind of hope so. Beatty's DICK TRACY is a visual wonder and a very entertaining film!\n\nIf Beatty went this route with his DICK TRACY sequel, it'd be very apt... I mean, we are finally as a society seriously having a discussion about off Earth habitats and living. Dick Tracy told us that in the 60's and it's time we celebrated that!\n\nKeep it cool,"
