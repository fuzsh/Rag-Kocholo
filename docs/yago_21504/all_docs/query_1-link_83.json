        "text": "FILM 2141: DICK TRACY (1990)\n\nTRIVIA: Al Pacino has stated that Madonna flashed him during rehearsals for this movie, opening her coat to reveal that she was naked underneath. Pacino joked that when he is old if he is observed with a beatific smile on his face, it will be because he is recalling the incident.\n\nDanny Elfman was hired to compose the film score because Warren Beatty was impressed with his work on Batman (1989). On working with Beatty, Elfman has said \"Warren was insane\".\n\nThe highest-grossing film of Warren Beatty's career.\n\nMacaulay Culkin was considered for the role of The Kid, but turned it down, as he preferred to do Home Alone (1990) over this film. Catherine O'Hara, who played Culkin's mother in Home Alone (1990) and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) has a cameo as Texie Garcia.\n\nRight before the five villains at the poker game are killed, The Brow gets two pair, aces and eights. This is widely known as the \"dead man's hand\", since famous sheriff Wild Bill Hickok of Deadwood, South Dakota was holding it when he was shot and killed in 1876.\n\nWarren Beatty considered appearing in, and even directing, Misery (1990), but chose to do this film instead. This film still features James Caan and Kathy Bates.\n\nSean Young was originally cast as Tess Trueheart, but was fired after a few days of filming by Warren Beatty. Afterwards, Young publicly accused Beatty of firing her because she \"wouldn't sleep with him\", though Deborah Ruf, Charlie Korsmo's mom, later disputed this saying that \"the rumor was that she had become too demanding, and they just decided not to put up with it\". Beatty issued a statement saying, \"I made a mistake casting her in the part, and I felt very badly about it.\"\n\nMadonna was paid just $35,000 for her performance in this film.\n\nAccording to his autobiography, comedian Gilbert Gottfried was nearly cast in the role of Mumbles based on his distinctive voice. He was perplexed that he and Dustin Hoffmanwould even be considered for the same role, joking that \"the only way our names would appear together in the same Hollywood conversation would be in the sentence, 'I've seen Gilbert Gottfried's acting, and he's no Dustin Hoffman'.\"\n\nMadonna and Warren Beatty were dating in real life during filming. When he proposed to her, and she stalled on the question of marriage, he ended their romance and claimed what he had given her was just a \"friendship ring.\" That was in August 1990. They had been an item since February 1989.\n\nThe back-up dancers and singers supporting Breathless Mahoney were all skilled Broadway performers, who were taught how to intentionally sing poorly for comedic effect.\n\nWas one of the last films to be made with paintings as backgrounds. Hollywood was ditching this for computer graphics imagery (CGI). This saves a lot of time and money, but has a massive drawback: the camera must remain still. This is why the movie has a \"big budget on-stage play\" feel and look. When watching the movie, notice that the camera never \"pans\" or swivels left or right. Warren Beatty warned his camera people to not do this, because it would make it clear to the audience that the backgrounds were paintings.\n\nWhen Tracy leaps off the side of the building onto a lamp post, he smashes his face into the pole (which is actually seen in the final film). Warren Beatty was asked about the scene years later and if he felt bad for the stunt person seen on-screen injuring himself. Beatty's response was \"That was me.\"\n\nThe film cast includes five Oscar winners: Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Estelle Parsons, and Kathy Bates; and four Oscar nominees: James Caan, Charles Durning, Seymour Cassel, and Michael J. Pollard.\n\nDustin Hoffman played Mumbles as a favour for Warren Beatty."
