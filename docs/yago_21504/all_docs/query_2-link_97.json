        "text": "LISTEN: APPLE | SPOTIFY\n\nThis episode of the Capes and Tights Podcast, Justin Soderberg welcomes comic book retailer Paul Eaton back to the show to discuss 1990 Dick Tracy movie.\n\nHard-boiled detective Dick Tracy is searching for evidence that proves Alphonse “Big Boy” Caprice is the city’s most dangerous crime boss. He may have found the key to unraveling the crimelord’s illegal empire in Breathless Mahoney, an enigmatic barroom singer who has witnessed some of Caprice’s crimes firsthand. However, she seems more set on stealing Dick away from his girlfriend, Tess, than helping him solve the case of his career.\n\nWarren Beatty produced, directed and starred in the film alongside Al Pacino, Madonna, Glenne Headly and Charlie Korsmo. Dustin Hoffman, James Keane, Charles Durning, William Forsythe, Seymour Cassel, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O’Hara, Ed O’Ross, James Caan, James Tolkan and Dick Van Dyke also appeared.\n\nThe film hit theaters on June 15, 1990.\n\n#158: Dick Tracy Movie Review with Paul Eaton\n\nAUDIO"
