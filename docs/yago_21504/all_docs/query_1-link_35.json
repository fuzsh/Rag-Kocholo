        "text": "Alex (BBats) here, doing a lil’ scouting in LA. Oh my oh my!\n\nThis past weekend, I had the pleasure to revisit Dick Tracy (1990) on the big screen courtesy of the Los Angeles Times Hero Complex Film Festival. The film hasn’t aged a day due to that rich pulp style that seeps through every set piece, costume, matte painting, and actor. The main draw was a Q & A with Warren Beatty after the film! Now, I was battling the flu and taking notes as fast as I could, so keep that in mind and I wouldn’t say anything below was a direct quote.\n\nBeatty stood in the wings as the film’s end credits rolled. Big applause for the film followed and I saw a big smile grow across his face. The moderator brought him out to thunderous ovation (duh). He seemed a little cagey and very careful in selecting his words; this Q & A was for the Los Angeles Times, he pointed out, and would be in print the very next day.\n\nHit the jump for some Beatty, Dick, and a lil' Bening action!\n\nOn Stephen Sondheim\n\n'He did great stuff for this…I’m such a fan of Sondheim’s. Everytime I see one of his shows, I just fall apart on the first song.'\n\nOn the film itself\n\n'I’m disgusting because I really do like it a lot.'\n\nBeatty had been attached to the propertry since 1976. The moderator asked why he chose Dick Tracy. Beatty said that he didn’t want to do some picture where everything got blasted around, and that Dick Tracy was this guy who had been around forever and wanted to start a family. He paused and said he thought of it as a gentle picture. (Aside: I love when people call movies \"pictures\". Super classy.)\n\nThis next part is so funny, let's get it right by quoting directly from the Los Angeles Times.\n\n“Little by little I found myself caught up enough in it to actually go and make a movie about it, because it was hard for me. … I always think of making a movie like vomiting. I don’t like to vomit, but I get to the point where I think, ‘I’d better go ahead and do this, and I’ll feel better.’”\n\nEveryone rolled with laughter. The vomiting reference also maybe gives us a little glimpse as to why he hasn’t directed a film since Bulworth (1998). But back to the Q & A.\n\nBeatty began to compliment everyone in the cast and the moderator honed in on certain performances and how he cast the roles. Interestingly, Beatty compared the casting process to writing. When you cast someone it's an instant rewrite, even if you don’t change a word.\n\nMadonna sings \"MORE\" in Dick Tracy and you know you want more, too: Bening, Pacino. Hoffman, Oscars and Dick Tracy sequel nuggets after the jump.\n\nOn Al Pacino\n\nBeatty said he had a certain actor in mind for the role but couldn’t get him (Sady, he wouldn’t reveal who it was) when he saw Al Pacino in a restaurant in Burbank. He asked Pacino who he thought would be good in the role, but he didn’t ask Pacino (!!!). Pacino said he’d think about it and call him later. Pacino called a few days later and asked if Beatty was serious in casting him in the roll of Big Boy. Warren was stunned for a second but said yes. Beatty knew that Pacino had just done a run of The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui as the title character and asked him to bring that to the roll. Beatty said that was very shrewd thinking (big laugh). Pacino was a dream to work with and Beatty respected him immensely. As an actor directing, you learn to respect actors more quickly and that no group has more intellect or better suggestions. Beatty talked about acting and directing simultaneously which is confusing and challenging; the actor’s job is to be somewhat out of control and the director's is to be somewhat in control.\n\nOn Dustin Hoffman\n\nBeatty wanted Hoffman for the roll of \"Mumbles\", but went about it from an indirect angle. They both used to do an impression of a mutual friend (He wouldn’t reveal a name, but it sounded a lot like Robert Evans if you ask me) and he told Hoffman he was going to ask Harry Dean Stanton (!!!) to do that impression for the character. Hoffman wanted to do it immediately instead. Hoffman shot his interrogation scene (with that amazing polar bear water cooler) the day after he won the best actor Oscar for Rainman (1988) and while he had a fever of 102 degrees.\n\nOn Dick Van Dyke\n\nBeatty said Van Dyke could always do these incredible comic falls without hurting himself. So then he fell and hurt himself on the set of Dick Tracy! Beatty said he felt so guilty about it that he sent Van Dyke a stairclimber. (I thought that was very funny for some reason). Beatty still seemed to feel bad about it .\n\nColors, Oscars, Madonna...\n\nThe main influence was the original Chester Gould strip from the 1930’s. Beatty explained that it had a paint-by-numbers key that would have a car that had a “1” on it and flowers with a “1” on them and the legend had “1=Red”. I tried to find an example online, but was unable (reader help?). He complimented everyone in the crew for there fantastic work.\n\nBeatty was very happy with the critical success of the film, which includes three Oscar wins, and when asked if he got a good chunk of the profits, he grinned and nodded.\n\nI was very happy with my chunk.”\n\nBig big laugh from the crowd.\n\nThen the moderator asked about Madonna, to which Beatty responded she was very fun to work with (a lot of people in the crowd bit there tongues). He also said she was very funny and that the scene with when Big Boy is trying to teach Breathless a new dance routine was particularly hilarious.\n\nThen Beatty dropped the bombshell...He said he was working on a new Dick Tracy movie.\n\nPeople giggled at first, but he was serious. Everyone cheered. During the audience Q&A, several people asked him about the new movie which he didn’t answer, instead saying that the more you talk about making a movie, the less likely it will happen. After one question about the use of digital backgrounds a la Sin City, he said that conversations go on and on and on with his production team. Indicating his personal leanings in the matter, he revealed that matte paintings “move” him.\n\nThen Beatty started taking questions from the audience. He personally pointed to people. (So charming!)\n\nAudience Question Tidbits\n\nOn directing Charlie Korsmo \"The Kid\": He was a good actor, didn’t need much direction. Korsmo is now teaching law in D.C.\n\nOn a speculative Director’s Cut: This was the director’s cut. “I always have final cut.” (Big applause.)\n\nOn the stylish makeup: They decided to use that style early on. Beatty put \"Little Face\" in the very beginning of the movie so that the audience could agree to believe the world and suspend their disbelief. Once that agreement is made, the audience will go with the picture.\n\n3D?: “Don’t go there.” Beatty said to big applause. Then he brought up a very interesting point about variable ticket prices per movies. The iconic star thinks its nonsense that theaters charge the same amount for every film and that a higher price for 3D shouldn’t be the point. (I personally love the idea of paying less for independent films, though would theaters carry them then?)\n\nPlans for a Dick Tracy Blu Ray? Beatty took a long pause, “…..yes.” Big eruption of cheers. (YES!!!)\n\nWhat movies made him fall in love with movies? The audience member asking said that Dick Tracy was that film for him. Beatty was so touched by that comment. He said early on it was “probably Bambi.” Also Laurel & Hardy and funny movies as a kid. Didn’t go past that though.\n\nThen...\n\nI GOT TO ASK WARREN BEATTY A QUESTION!!!!\n\nAAHH! Super sick with the flu, a little delirious, and very nervous, I went totally mush mouth for a few seconds before I regained my marbles and asked my favorite question to actors and directors, “What are some of your favorite performances and films of the last few years?” “Oh don’t get me started,” he answered. Suddenly someone from the crowd yelled, “Anything with Annette!” and Beatty said, “Good answer!” There was a big laugh and then Beatty talked about how much he loved both The Kids are Alright and Mother and Child. (awww!)\n\nHe took more and more questions but I couldn’t keep up, the sickness conquering me. Beatty was so charming and funny; it's no wonder he’s a star. He even signed items for fans, but I made a quick exit. I spent the next four days in bed doing my best to breathe. I’m all good now, but please excuse this tardiness of this write up. (Pauses for forgiveness...) Ahhh thanks y’all!"
