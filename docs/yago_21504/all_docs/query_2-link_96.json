        "text": "Revisit is a series of reviews highlighting past releases that now deserve a second look.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the state of the Hollywood blockbuster was in turmoil. Just a year before, Tim Burton’s cartoony gothic take on Batman revolutionized the concept of the comic book movie, while simultaneously annihilating box office records and demonstrating canny use of cross-marketing in the form of themed Prince singles and extensive merchandising. Ghostbusters II was released to mixed reviews and with the reluctant cooperation of its principals, requiring studio pressure to get it made. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade seemingly closed the book on one of the last standing iconic action heroes of the decade. In short, things must have been a bit confusing for filmmakers looking for the next hit.\n\nWhile director/star Warren Beatty had been developing a adaptation of the classic comic strip Dick Tracy since 1975, the film released in 1990 could not be more blatantly a product of its time. A series of legal issues (including film rights being passed from studio to studio, multiple discarded scripts and the involvement of strip creator Chester Gould) may have delayed the eventual finished product of Beatty’s Dick Tracy, but the film that resulted could not be conceptualized than in any other cinematic environment except one that was still adapting to the titanic success of Batman. Some critics pointed out at the time, somewhat fairly, that Dick Tracy took more than its share of cues from Burton’s film, including hyper-stylized nostalgia, visually grotesque villains and surprisingly casual violence. And while this is true, Dick Tracy is also a remarkable movie in its own right.\n\nWatching Dick Tracy is a bizarre experience on multiple levels. The characterization of Tracy (Beatty), his primary antagonist “Big Boy” Caprice (Al Pacino) and assorted gangsters, cops, flatfoots, crooks and reporters is about as good vs. evil as it comes. Tracy is good, noble and unwavering in his dedication to the law. Caprice is evil, sniveling, deformed and borderline insane in his quest to unify the criminals of the city under his rule. There’s no middle ground, period. While that completely fits with the (literally) black and white mentality of Gould’s original strip, it’s strange to see in the context of modern storytelling. Suitably, the visual impression of the film is just as broadly drawn, which is not to say that it’s crude; reportedly, Beatty insisted on a color palette of seven colors, again emulating the look of the original comic strip. In effect, everything in Dick Tracy looks exaggerated and cartoonish, yet the subject matter is itself grim and violent, with murder, robbery and child abuse all occurring in the first few minutes.\n\nBut it’s that contradiction that makes Dick Tracy a fascinating film, at least on an abstract level. The combination of outlandish, almost Expressionistic elements such as villains so distorted by their evil, like Pruneface (R.G. Armstrong) or Flattop (William Forsythe), that they look inhuman with relatively straightforward gangster machinations keeps a viewer off balance. The fact that the protagonist, his girlfriend Tess (Glenne Headley) and protégé the Kid (Charlie Korsmo) all deal with these horribly countenanced villains without any comment as to their appearance is equally odd and wonderful. Similarly, the amazingly detailed matte painting backdrops seamlessly blended with the live action onscreen contribute to a sense of a hyper-reality in the film. It’s not that it looks fake, or even truly like a comic strip, but something so bright and clear that it’s more than real.\n\nDick Tracy is baldly imitative of Batman, with a ruthless protagonist hunting down colorful villains in a stylized urban landscape. But it’s also a distinctive movie, with an almost ridiculously overqualified cast providing color for a relatively dry plot. In particular, Pacino seems to be having a scenery-chewing ball as the unhinged Caprice, and Madonna delivers possibly her finest screen role as the femme fatale Breathless Mahoney, both looking and sounding the part to a tee. In the end, it feels as much a response to a cultural phenomenon as the comic strip that inspired it, but it’s not a lesser film for that. It’s just that much stranger."
