        "text": "Full Name: Henry Warren Beatty\n\nProfession: Actor and Filmmaker\n\nBiography: Beatty broke onto the scene with 'Splendor in the Grass' (1961). Then at 29, he produced and acted in 'Bonnie and Clyde' (1967)—from there he continued this successful transition from a young actor to a respected producer.\n\nThose that knew him in his early acting years would hardly have found this surprising, with him admitting his ambition and evincing it in the many suggestions he made even as a young actor.\n\nSince making it, Beatty has acted in and produced a number of prominent films: 'Heaven Can Wait' (1978), 'Dick Tracy' (1990), 'Bulworth' (1998), etc. He has been nominated for 18 Golden Globe Awards, of which he was won six.\n\nBorn: March 30, 1937\n\nBirthplace: Richmond, Virginia, USA\n\nAge: 87 years old"
