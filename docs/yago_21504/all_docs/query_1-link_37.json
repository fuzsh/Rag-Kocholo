        "text": "“No words. Should’ve sent a poet.”\n\nThat’s where I come in.\n\nThe George H.W. Bush years are some of our most culturally significant in terms of oddness. The Reagan years were over and it was no longer morning in America. It was early afternoon and there was a strange cultural hangover from the eight years of red state repression and red scare conformity. Something was coming. Nobody knew it was an economic boom led by a charismatic pedophile but it was coming. Only in retrospect do those tea leaves make any sense. And one of the biggest and clearest is 1990’s Dick Tracy, the story of a tough-on-crime pervert with a politician’s good looks and a politician’s moral vacuum in…\n\n97\n\nThe totality of artifice. A reminder that we were once inspired by the palette and production design of Tim Burton, serials, comic-book television, and Film Noir, and not the esteemed filmography of Jon Favreau. Batman 89 kicked a few of these copy-cats into gear, and Dick Tracy, above all, is the elusive, romantic cousin that ignores the flab and cuts straight to the point. Basically a caped-crusader movie if it was made by an aging proponent of New Hollywood. It's absolutely insane. Dustin Hoffman plays a character named 'mumbles', Madonna is there to just be Madonna, Al Pacino is so hammy and dedicated to his preposterous motions that I'm shocked that he even recovered. It's all a joy -…\n\nLots to enjoy here, including Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, Richard Sylbert's production design, Stephen Sondheim's songs, the makeup, the matte paintings, Al Pacino hamming it up, etc. You know all this. Lots to not enjoy as well, including the lumpy pacing, the total lack of narrative momentum, and Warren Beatty's gaping void of a central performance. You know all this too, because this movie endures. Not as a classic, nor even as a movie that people like, but as a movie that you've seen.\n\nA clue to why this movie didn't work can be found in Dick Tracy Special, the notoriously half-assed 2010 TV special that Beatty made solely to be able to keep hoarding the film rights to the character.…\n\nThe airline cancelled my flight, so I had time to kill in the scorching hot City of Noo Yawk. Saw that the Museum of the Moving Image was playing this on 35mm, and nobody had to twist my arm to make a beeline for Astoria. I had an excellent time. Every word of my review from last time still stands, but what could be better during a heat wave than taking in the primary colors, matte paintings, and latex? Just wish the museum could've provided a popcorn, a soda, and an official Dick Tracy \"I Saw It First\" opening-day t-shirt to complete the summertime vibes.\n\nThis owes a lot more to Batman '66 than '89, notably in its irreverent Pop…"
