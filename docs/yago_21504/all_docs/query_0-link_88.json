        "text": "Touchstone Pictures\n\nStarring: Warren Beatty, Neil Summers\n\nDirected by: Warren Beatty\n\nSynopsis: Chester Gould’s comic strip detective hero is brought to life on the big screen via prosthetics, bright colors and big-name stars.\n\nPurr Blur: At the beginning of the film a young boy (Charlie Korsmo) stumbles into a warehouse where a group of nefarious criminals are playing cards. As the boy sneaks closer he hits a metal container. The crooks are immediately alert and look in the kid’s direction. Just then a black cat jumps up on one of the cans. The crooks assume the cat made the noise and resume their card game.\n\nKitty Carnage Warning! The cat approaches one criminal named The Rodent (Neil Summers). The man calls nicely to the cat then picks it up by the neck and hurls it across the warehouse.\n\nFinal Mewsings: Boys and cats need to steer clear of criminal hideouts.\n\nRelevant Links:"
