        "text": "The bold black headlines of The Daily Paper, which is what the daily paper is called, proclaim the dread details of the crime wave gripping the large city: ''Gangland Toughs Break Arms of News Dealer.''\n\nIf still small of scale, civil disorder mounts. Toughs also shatter the kneecaps of a shoeshine man. What next?\n\nCivilization is in peril, or at least civilization as it is known in the comic-strip world of Chester Gould's Dick Tracy, and in that world as it has been gloriously reinvented in Warren Beatty's new film, ''Dick Tracy.''\n\nSummer hasn't officially arrived yet, but it's unlikely to offer a big-budget commercial movie as thoroughly entertaining as this stylish real-life cartoon, a comedy-melodrama produced and directed by Mr. Beatty, who also plays the title role of the stolidly dauntless police detective.\n\n''Dick Tracy'' has just about everything required of an extravaganza: a smashing cast, some great Stephen Sondheim songs, all of the technical wizardry that money can buy (plus the knowledge of how and when to use it), and a screenplay (credited to Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr.) that observes the fine line separating true comedy from lesser camp.\n\n''Dick Tracy'' is a great uninterrupted grin. It goes from ear to ear, from the pretitle opening sequence to the ending in which Tracy may or may not commit himself to his patient companion, Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly). It's a movie that finds funniness in the most unexpected places and characters.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
