        "text": "Aarón Díaz and Kate del Castillo had a love relationship for more than five years, until 2011 when they announced their separation. Despite the fact that a decade has passed since his breakup, the actor is still questioned about his romance with the Ingobernable actress.\n\nIn a talk with the Live Chisme program, Aarón Díaz answered if he would work with Kate del Castillo and his response surprised the anchors.\n\n“Will we see you work on a production with Kate, now that She is a producer? Would you like it? “, the reporter asked Aarón Díaz, who replied:” What Kate, sorry? ” Once the reporter pointed out that he was referring to his ex-wife, Kate del Castillo, the actor expressed his surprise and clarified if he would be willing to film a movie or series with her. “Imagine, it’s been more than a decade that I didn’t even hear the name, so I don’t think so. Don’t expect that,” said Aarón Díaz.\n\nHis attitude has since caused controversy because his statements suggests he does not remember Kate. Fans called Aarón Díaz a “clown”, “fired up”, “rude” or who even seems to be a man who “hates being famous” while others say he’s only ensuring the past remains the past.\n\nOthers think it’s a revenge for an interview Kate granted years ago stating that they were both pressured by their parents to get married. “The truth, and I hope I don’t offend Aaron at all, is that I never wanted to get married. I always said that I didn’t want to get married again and in the end my parents wanted us to get married, his parents wanted us to get married and he wanted to get married too, so I decided to take a chance. The break up with Aaron was very hard, but it was something we decided together, “\n\nFrom his gestures during the interview, it is evident that he knows which “Kate” the journalist is referring to, However, instead of giving rise to speculation or comment, he chose to respond sarcastically."
