        "text": "ST. PETERSBURG — With everything Jose Caballero did to make the over-the-shoulder catch in shallow centerfield for what would become the final out of Thursday’s 5-4 win over the Yankees, he wasn’t going to let it slip away.\n\nWhile the other Rays, Yankees and the second-largest Tropicana Field crowd of the season anxiously waited for umpires to relay the decision on the replay review of whether he had the ball long enough before dropping it, Caballero said there was no reason to worry.\n\n“I was just running that way, I kind of lost (the ball) with the roof, and I was able to see it at the end and make a catch on the play,” Caballero said. “I was so excited that I caught the ball, and I hit my glove and it fell out. But I knew I had it with me enough to be an out.”\n\nCaballero was right, as the call was confirmed. He had dropped the ball after raising, then pumping and crossing his arms. And the Rays, after the slight delay, could celebrate the tense victory that gave them their sixth series win in their last seven and improved their record to 46-47.\n\n“As they say, all’s well that ends well when they signal it was on the transfer,” closer Pete Fairbanks said. “Unlike (Cowboys receiver) Dez (Bryant in a controversial 2014 playoff game against the Packers), he caught it.”\n\nThe dramatic ending capped a night in which the Rays got a couple of the clutch hits they were missing in Wednesday’s frustrating 2-1 loss and a series of key outs by a sextet of relievers, some of whom created the trouble they escaped.\n\n“They made the pitch when they had to,” manager Kevin Cash said.\n\nThe Rays took a 2-0 lead on Randy Arozarena’s first-inning homer, but starter Shane Baz allowed the Yankees to tie on solo shots in the second and third. The Rays rebuilt the lead to 5-2 in their half of the third.\n\nYandy Diaz led off with a searing double, hit at a career and team second-ever-hardest 117.4 mph. Brandon Lowe singled him in. A walk by All-Star Isaac Paredes, an Amed Rosario double and a Jose Siri sacrifice fly resulted in two more.\n\nThat started the bullpen brigade. The Rays used Kevin Kelly (who took over in the fifth for Baz and allowed one of his runs to make it 5-3), Garrett Cleavinger, Jason Adam, Colin Poche, Manuel Rodriguez and Fairbanks to get the final 14 outs.\n\nAdam did, arguably, the most challenging work, setting down Orlando Cabrera, Alex Verdugo and dangerous Juan Soto on a four-pitch strikeout in the seventh. He came back out in the eighth for a rare extended appearance and struck out the more dangerous Aaron Judge.\n\n“That was huge,” Cash said. “Those four outs were the big outs going right through the teeth of that lineup. You don’t see Juan Soto take swings like he did on those change-ups. And then to be able to take a breath, go back out there and be ready to go to get Judge, who’s — we all know how good he is — to get him out.”\n\nThere were more challenges to come. Colin Poche allowed his first two batters to reach base and fell behind Jose Trevino 3-0 before getting a strikeout, maybe with some help on a call or two.\n\nRecently called up Manuel Rodriguez was next, and he walked Anthony Volpe to load the bases before getting Trent Grisham to fly out.\n\n“It’s not always easy out there,” Adam said. “There are days where it feels really hard. And they did a great job of not giving in. Those were really tough pitches and big pitches. At the end of the day, the job’s to win the ballgame, so they did that. We all did that. And it was a great team win.”\n\nFairbanks closed it out, but not without some of his own drama before Caballero’s catch.\n\nHe walked leadoff man Oswaldo Cabrera, had to make a play himself on a slow roller for an out, then walked Soto to bring Judge up as the potential go-ahead run. Fairbanks got the Yankees slugger to pop out but allowed an RBI single to Ben Rice that made it 5-4.\n\nThen Fairbanks got Gleyber Torres to pop up and watched as Caballero, with no one calling the ball, beat Jose Siri and two other teammates to it, made the catch and then waited to see if it counted.\n\nDiaz said he was “scared,” as he thought Caballero had dropped it. Cash said the Rays’ replay tech “assured them” it was a catch. Adam said “there was never a doubt” in his mind.\n\n“An out is an out,” Fairbanks said. “I’m glad that the ball came out of his glove when he started celebrating and not prior to that.”\n\n• • •\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida."
