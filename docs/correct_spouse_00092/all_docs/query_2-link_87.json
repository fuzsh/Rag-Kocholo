        "text": "Craig Kimbrel was arguably the biggest All-Star snub this past weekend as the veteran closer has a 2.10 ERA, 0.90 WHIP, 23 saves, and 52 strikeouts on the year. Over his past 21 innings, Kimbrel holds a 34.2% strikeout-minus-walk rate and 1.76 SIERA. Even with the shaky April, Kimbrel still ranks top three amongst closers in strikeout rate, strikeout-minus-walk rate, SIERA, and saves for the entire season. There was a point in early May where it seemed like the Orioles would be in the market for a closer at the deadline, but they will just be looking to add another setup option and middle relief help now.\n\nNotes\n\nRaisel Iglesias continues his rise in the ranks and it really just comes down to consistency with him over guys like Muñoz and Miller. Iglesias has allowed just 3 earned runs over his past 18.1 innings and that also comes with a 26.1% strikeout-minus-walk rate and 36.1% CSW (top amongst closers over this period). As long as the velo he’s seen recently remains (it did drop a little in his most previous outing), there should be no concerns about rostering Iglesias.\n\nAndrés Muñoz on the other hand has really struggled since the beginning of June and has now gone five straight games without a strikeout. Since June, he has held just a 4.4% strikeout-minus-walk rate and 4.44 SIERA and it’s clear that the back injury he’s been dealing with is effecting his stuff.\n\nMason Miller also appears to be running out of gas just a little bit now as his velo has declined since the start of the season. Miller has still been pitching well, but he just hasn’t been the dominant guy we saw from April through mid-May. Over his past 17.1 innings, he holds a 23.2% strikeout-minus-walk rate and 2.92 SIERA, which both are very good, but not elite enough to put him in the top tier when he is only able to produce six saves since the beginning of May.\n\nAlexis Díaz is still struggling but it appears it won’t lead to him losing his role as the sole closer for the Reds so as long as he is healthy, he’s at least a top-25 closer by default, at least through the trade deadline. He’s been better over his past 7 innings, not allowing any earned runs, but it still only comes with 19.2% strikeout-minus-walk and 10.6% swinging-strike rates along with a 3.48 xFIP.\n\nMichael Kopech’s days as the White Sox closer may be getting close to an end, as hopefully, we will see him traded to a team that can help him figure things out in the bullpen. There’s a lot to like here still, but he will need to improve his fastball command and find a secondary offering he trusts to throw more than 9% of the time.\n\nHéctor Neris has actually looked quite dominant over his past five outings, with a 38.9% strikeout-minus-walk rate and 1.56 SIERA. Now it is only 4.1 innings and comes with just an 8.4% swinging-strike rate but it’s great timing for the Cubs who will want to trade him this month. Keep an eye on Julian Merryweather potentially closing out games over the final two months of the season.\n\nAnd if you want more daily reliever updates, please check out our Reliever Ranks series\n\nWatch List\n\nRank Pitcher Change 1Emmanuel ClaseT1-2Josh Hader-3Edwin Díaz-4Raisel IglesiasT2+25Craig Kimbrel+36Andrés Muñoz-27Mason Miller-28Trevor Megill+49Ryan HelsleyT3-210Evan Phillips+111Pete Fairbanks-212Jhoan Duran-213Tanner Scott-14Kyle FinneganT4-15Robert Suarez-16Clay Holmes-17Camilo Doval-18Kirby Yates-19Paul SewaldT5-20Kenley Jansen+121José Alvarado-122Carlos Estévez-23Alexis Díaz+224James McArthurT6-25Michael Kopech-226Jason Foley-27Héctor Neris+228Chad Green-129Aroldis Chapman-130Jalen Beeks-"
