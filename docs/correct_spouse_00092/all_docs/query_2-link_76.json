        "text": "Last week, we revealed who should start the NL All-Star game based on PLV statistics. This week, it’s the ALs’ turn, and we have the actual starting lineups to compare to this time.\n\nBefore we jump in, here’s a reminder of the criteria. Each hitter must have seen at least 1,000 pitches through June to qualify. The only exception was at catcher, which we lowered to 800. The Hitter Performance category was the dominant selection driver, but we looked at all the categories to find the players with the best overall PLV profiles. Like the official ballot, we went with three outfielders regardless of where they typically play and slotted them in left, right, and center based on the best fit. All of the stats below are through June 30.\n\nCatcher: Connor Wong"
