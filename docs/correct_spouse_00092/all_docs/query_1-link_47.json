Her passions, and professional focuses, are in the areas of reproductive health and justice, criminal justice reform, and building LGBTQIA+ political power in the state. As a Cuban American raised in Hialeah, FL being a progressive, queer, pro-choice, woman was not something that was visible or acceptable in the Cuban community. Her strong desire to breakdown the stigma, and the rampant misinformation in Hispanic communities surrounding reproductive rights, queerness, the patriarchy and racial inequity motivated her to get involved, uplift, educate and advocate around these issues. She is an active member of the political community in Broward County.\n\nShe currently serves as a Director for the Dolphin Democrats, the state's largest LBGTQIA+ caucus, a member of the Floridians for Reproductive Freedom coalition, a Steering Committee member for the Human Rights Campaign, and has previously served on the boards of Ruth's List Broward County, and Women's March Broward County.

She believes music is medicine (especially when it's live and loud), coffee should be black, and women should be in charge.\n\nKevin Parker (He/Him) is a long-time Central Florida resident and is one of the Central Florida Community Organizers. Kevin is highly involved in his community and currently serves as a member of his local democratic executive committee, president of Osceola Young Dems, a co-founder of his local coalition group, Osceola Peopleâs Coalition, and serves as a board member of the Democratic Progressive Caucus of Florida, and Progressives for Democracy in America FL Chapter.\n\nKevin has always had a passion for helping people and did whenever he could. After the 2020 Pandemic hit he knew that advocacy and fighting for people was what he wanted to do. As a queer black man, his advocacy centers around LGBTQIA+ and African American issues, but also does advocacy in intersectional issues such as Immigration, Gun Rights, Education, Housing, and Environmental Justice.
