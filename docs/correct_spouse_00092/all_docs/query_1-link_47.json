Her passions, and professional focuses, are in the areas of reproductive health and justice, criminal justice reform, and building LGBTQIA+ political power in the state. As a Cuban American raised in Hialeah, FL being a progressive, queer, pro-choice, woman was not something that was visible or acceptable in the Cuban community.
