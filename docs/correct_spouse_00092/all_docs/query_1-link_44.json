After graduating from high school, she served two years in the Israeli Defense Forces as a drill sergeants assistant. Due to her job in the military, Lee was exposed to all sorts of military trials. This exposure set Lee on a path to law and inspired her desire to be a litigator.\n\nAfter her service she attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where she graduated cum laude with a degree in philosophy. She was also a part of the Honors Collegium program. After graduating, Lee worked as a case assistant at Seyfarth Shawâs Century City office.
