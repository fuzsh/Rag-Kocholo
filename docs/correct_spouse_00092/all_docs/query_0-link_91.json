Is Kate del Castillo married?\n\nIntroduction\n\nKate del Castillo (birth name – Kate del Castillo Negrete Trillo) is a Mexican-American television and film actress who began starring as the First Lady of Mexico in the Netflix drama Ingobernable in 2017.\n\nIn 1998, Kate was nominated for a TVyNovelas Award for Best Young Lead Actress for her role in La Mentira. But, the actress is best known for starring in the popular Telemundo series – ”La Reina del Sur.”\n\nBiography\n\nShe was born on October 23, 1972, in Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico.\n\nKate is the daughter of Eric del Castillo, a Mexican actor in television, film, and theater who played in over 45 soap operas.\n\nDel Castillo debuted in the film The Last Escape in 1980.\n\nIn 1995, the actress appeared in the music video “Fuego de Noche, Nieve de Día” by Ricky Martin. The music video tells the tragic love story of a young woman (portrayed by Kate) and a young man (portrayed by Ricky). It was included on 17 DVDs in 2008 and La Historia DVD in 2001.\n\nIn 2006, Kate starred alongside Jennifer Lopez in the film Bordertown, an American drama motion picture. The film also features Martin Sheen and Antonio Banderas. The film was produced by Tracee Stanley-Newell, Barbara Martinez-Jitner, Cary Epstein, and David Bergstein, and written by Gregory Nava. The film ended up grossing $8,327,171 worldwide.\n\nIn 2009, she was appointed Ambassador for the Mexican Commission on Human Rights to combat human trafficking.\n\nIn the same year, Kate became a L’Oreal spokesperson.\n\nIn 2011, she starred as “Queen of the South” in La Reina del Sur ($10 million budget), a prime-time telenovela for Antena 3 (Spain) and Telemundo (NBC/Universal). It has been renewed for a 2nd season which premiered on April 22, 2019.\n\nLater that year, she was named one of the “50 most beautiful” and “25 most influential women” by People en Español magazine.\n\nIn 2020, she portrayed Isabel Aretas in Bad Boys for Life.\n\nEl Chapo\n\nJoaquín Archivaldo Guzmán Loera, better known as “El Chapo,” is a Mexican drug lord and former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel.

In 2019, El Chapo was found guilty of several criminal charges and sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years.\n\nIn 2012, Kate attracted El Chapo’s attention when she made a post on her social media account about him and his cartel. She wrote:\n\n“Today I believe more in El Chapo Guzman than in the governments that hide the truth from me even though it is painful.”\n\nIn 2015, del Castillo helped Sean Penn interview El Chapo. At that time, the Mexican media thought Kate and Sean Penn were possibly dating.\n\nAfter the interview, Sean Penn wrote an article during which he stated that El Chapo wanted to have a movie made about his life and only trusted the story to Kate.\n\nLater, it came out that the meeting between El Chapo and Kate & Penn had helped the Mexican authorities track down and arrest the drug lord.\n\nSean has denied allegations that he helped lead authorities to arrest El Chapo.\n\nThis sequence of events turned Kate’s life upside down. Her text exchanges with Guzman were leaked to the press, and the actress was investigated for possible money laundering. Also, the investigation left del Castillo unable to return to Mexico for 3 years.\n\nIn 2018, del Castillo sued Mexico’s former government for $60 million in material and moral damages for an “unjustified” investigation over money laundering allegations.\n\nShe said:\n\n“I’m broke. I’ve been paying lawyers in the United States and Mexico for so many years.”\n\nIn the same year, del Castillo said that she is no longer in touch with Sean and believes that the actor betrayed her. She said:\n\n“Sean Penn apparently helped in the location and detention.”\n\nKate went on to say:\n\n”I was not aware of that situation, and that is why I have always referred to it as betrayal.”\n\nDuring a recent interview, the actress said about her meeting with El Chapo:\n\n“It was an experience I will keep in myself and will last forever.”\n\ndel Castillo later added:\n\n”I regret that I didn’t follow my instincts in many ways.”\n\nHusband\n\nKate del Castillo married Luis García on February 3, 2001. The couple divorced on September 1, 2004.\n\nOn August 29, 2009, Kate del Castillo married her second husband, Aarón Díaz, a Mexican actor who was cast in the ABC thriller series Quantico.
