        "text": "ViX has aligned with Reconexión Productions for the travel documentary series Reconexión: Mexico, hosted by Mexican-American actor Aarón Díaz (Quantico, Tierra de Reyes/Land of Kings, Santa Diabla/Saint Devil).\n\nThe ten-episode series follows the actor as he reconnects with his roots while traveling through all 32 Mexican states. Throughout the show, he will explore places off the beaten path, meet with local people and give audiences a unique perspective of the beauty and magic of Mexico.\n\nDíaz serves as a producer on the series alongside Tim Sexton and Fernando Mills, co-founders of Reconexión Productions.\n\n“Reconexión: Mexico is a project I’ve always dreamed of doing, where I get to explore my beautiful country in-depth and, at the same time, bring the audience on this adventure, so ViX is the perfect partner for it,” said Diaz.\n\nAugusto Rovegno, senior VP of content ViX at TelevisaUnivision, said: “We are thrilled to kick off Reconexión: Mexico, which explores in depth the incredible known and not-so-known places that Mexico has to offer. We feel very proud of partnering with the Reconexión team and Aarón Diaz as we embark together with the audience on this exciting journey to discover the beauty and richness of Mexican culture across the country.”"
