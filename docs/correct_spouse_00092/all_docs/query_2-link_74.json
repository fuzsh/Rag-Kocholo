        "text": "Have good vibes returned in time for the All-Star break? The Yankees stand on the precipice of a massive sweep in Baltimore, one that would thrust them back into first place in the AL East if they can pull it off. The Yankees playing the Orioles takes their most interesting rival off the table for the purposes of this exercise, but there was still plenty of good baseball played across the American League on Saturday. Let’s run through it all.\n\nCleveland Guardians (58-36) 4, Tampa Bay Rays (47-48) 2\n\nCleveland and Tampa Bay battled through a pitchers’ duel on Friday, with the Rays pulling out a 2-0 shutout win. It was the Guardians that managed a tight win on Saturday, with late heroics from Jhonkensy Noel helping Cleveland even up the series.\n\nZack Littell and Gavin Williams dueled in this one, with each allowing just one earned run and an unearned run. Williams worked five frames, Littell surviving through six innings.\n\nThe Rays struck first, Yandy Díaz doubling home Richie Palacios in the third for a 1-0 lead. Tampa could’ve done more damage, but Will Brennan and Andrés Giménez combined for one of the craziest defensive plays you’ll ever see:\n\nCleveland struck back in the fifth, with young sparkplug Angel Martínez taking Littell deep to tie the game. The Guardians nudged in front on an RBI single by Giménez later in the inning, but the lead was short lived. Palacios tripled to leadoff the bottom of the fifth, and scored on a groundball by Johnny Deluca.\n\nNeither side could do much until the eighth, the tension building as the teams sent out their strongest relievers. The Guardians broke the stalemate in the eighth. With a man on, Noel pinch-hit for Brennan, and unleashed a monstrous blast off Garrett Cleavinger:\n\nNoel gave Cleveland a 4-2 lead they wouldn’t relinquish, with All-Universe closer Emmanuel Clase earning his 29th save and lowering his ERA to 0.81 in the process.\n\nTexas Rangers (45-50) 2, Houston Astros (50-45) 1 (10 innings)\n\nThis was a unique game, one in which both teams put a run across in the first before failing to score again until the game went to extras. Despite the lack of run scoring, it was a thrill ride, with the Rangers narrowly prevailing in ten scintillating innings.\n\nMarcus Semien started the game off with a bang, hitting the first pitch of the night out to left for a solo homer off Spencer Arrighetti:\n\nIt was the 13th dinger of the year for the workmanlike Semien. But rather than set a tone for the matchup, it represented Texas’ last show of offense for quite some time.\n\nHouston quickly tied things up in a zany home half of the first. Alex Bregman and Yordan Álvarez singles set things up, and Yainer Diaz lined a single of his own to tie the game. Bregman narrowly avoided the tag at the plate:\n\nHouston appeared to take the lead after Jon Singleton singled and Jonah Heim was called for catcher interference, but the ruling was overturned upon a challenge, with starter Nathan Eovaldi retiring Jeremy Peña and Jake Meyers to leave the bases loaded.\n\nThe bats on both sides went silent from there. The two offenses managed just one combined hit over the next four frames, taking a 1-1 game into the sixth. There, the Rangers loaded the bases with two outs. Texas appeared to take the lead, with Nathaniel Lowe legging out an infield single and two runners scoring on the play. But Houston challenged, and replays showed Arrighetti just barely beat Lowe to the first-base bag:\n\nArrighetti departed after six, striking out seven and allowing only two hits. Eovaldi managed seven innings, scattering eight hits, striking out seven and walking none.\n\nBryan King relieved Arrighetti and got into trouble in the seventh. He issued three walks to load the bases, but pumped a fastball past Josh Smith on a 3-2 count to escape unscathed. The Astros repeated the trick in the eighth, with the Rangers loading the bases once again, this time Seth Martinez whiffing Leody Taveras to preserve the 1-1 tie.\n\nThe game went to the tenth, and with two down and a runner on third, Lowe came up huge, lining a single to score Smith and give the Rangers a 2-1 lead:\n\nTexas was able to hang on, thanks in no small part to a couple of old friends. David Robertson did stellar work, striking out three in two scoreless innings of relief of Eovaldi, and All-Star closer Kirby Yates slammed the door in the tenth to earn his 15th save. The defending World Series champs are five games under .500, but they remain within shouting distance in the AL West at six games behind Seattle (and five back of Houston).\n\nOther Games\n\nBoston Red Sox (52-42) 5, Kansas City Royals (52-43) 0: Kutter Crawford is on a heater. A week after dominating the Yankees across seven shutout innings in the Bronx, Crawford repeated the feat, shutting out the Royals over another seven stellar while allowing just two hits. The 28-year-old now has a 3.04 ERA on the year. Reese McGuire opened the scoring for the Boston with an RBI double off Seth Lugo in the second, and the Red Sox broke things open a bit with a three-run third inning. Rafael Devers put the finishing touches with a solo homer over the Green Monster in the fifth. It was the superstar third baseman’s 22nd of the season.\n\nLos Angeles Angels (40-55) 2, Seattle Mariners (52-45) 1: The ever reliable George Kirby turned in another strong start for Seattle, but it wasn’t enough as the Mariners’ bats went quiet. Kirby allowed just two runs (one earned) and three hits over six, striking out seven. But Seattle wasn’t able to score outside of an RBI single from Julio Rodriguez in the first. Jose Soriano was money otherwise, holding the Mariners to the one run over six frames. Jo Adell came up with a two-run single off Kirby in the second, giving the Angels a 2-1 lead that they would hold for the game’s duration. Ben Joyce, Luis García, and Carlos Estévez were stellar in relief to close out the win.\n\nMinnesota Twins (54-41) 4, San Francisco Giants (46-50) 2: Carlos Santana played the hero, breaking a 2-2 tie with a milestone homer. Santana strode to the plate in the sixth and lined a homer off Taylor Rogers just fair down the left-field line:\n\nThe dinger made Santana just the third active player to homer in all 30 current ballparks, joining Manny Machado and Giancarlo Stanton. The Twins added a run in the ninth to give themselves some breathing room, with Jhoan Duran pitching a clean inning to earn his 15th save."
