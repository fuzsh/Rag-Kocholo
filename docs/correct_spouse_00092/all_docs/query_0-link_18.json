        "text": "Telemundo stars Kate del Castillo and Aaron Diaz divorced in 2012, and in a new interview with People En Español, the \"Dueños del Paraíso\" star talks about her ex-husband.\n\n\"I come across him all the time at Telemundo,\" she said about Diaz, who is the star of \"Tierra de Reyes.\" \"I care for him very much. I'm always going to care for him. His parents are divine. They are always showing me pictures of his two daughters. I love it. He's happy. He wanted to have children, and he's an excellent dad.\"\n\nDel Castillo also talked about being single. She explained everyone needs a time when they are alone to put themselves first.\n\nThe actress clarifies she wasn't having a bad time before when she was in relationships, but she simply felt she needed a break from being with someone else.\n\nShe is currently not in any rush to get married again or have children.\n\n\"I've never wanted to be a mom,\" she said. \"I don't know if one day I will want to be, but if I would have wanted to be, I would have been one a long time ago. I'm not scared of marriage, but I don't believe in the institution. To love someone, you don't have to sign a paper. It's something man created for profit, to create problems and fears.\"\n\nHer latest telenovela, \"Dueños del Paraíso,\" recently debuted on Telemundo.\n\nShe is playing Anastasia Cardona, a drug trafficker living in Miami in the 1970s. Del Castillo has played a drug trafficker before in \"La Reina del Sur,\" but the actress said she is not afraid of getting pigeonholed into this kind of role, according to La Prensa.\n\n\"The truth is that I am not afraid of being pigeonholed into the drug trafficker role,\" she explained. \"What I am afraid of is that they don't give me work. I have done many things after the series 'La Reina del Sur' that have nothing to do with drugs, such as the role where I interpreted a transvestite in the film 'K-11,' so I don't think I have been pigeonholed.\""
