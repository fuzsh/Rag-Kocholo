With a $10 million budget it is the second most expensive telenovela ever produced by Telemundo.[10] The series later was renewed for a second season, that premiered in 2019.[11] del Castillo continued her collaboration with Telemundo in 2015, starring in Duenos del Paraiso. The telenovela is inspired by the drug trade of Miami in the 1970s.[12] She also appeared in a number of American television shows, include CSI: Miami, Grimm and Dallas. In 2015, she had a recurring role as Rogelio de la Vega's ex-wife in the CW comedy series, Jane the Virgin.[13]\n\nOn November 20, 2015, Del Castillo launched a new brand of tequila named Honor del Castillo in association with the Vivanco Family. She serves as the spokesperson for the brand. Del Castillo has also appeared in advertising campaigns for L'Oréal and Ford.[14]\n\nIn 2012, Del Castillo starred in the Mexican film Colosio: El asesinato, which centers around the assassination of the Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. The following year, she starred in the American prison drama film K-11.

The marriage was dissolved on September 1, 2004. In August 2009, del Castillo married Aarón Díaz in a Las Vegas ceremony. On July 26, 2011, it was announced that Kate and Díaz were separating. Del Castillo was briefly romantically connected with Sean Penn from 2015 to 2016, although the actor's representatives contest this.[25] It has been frequently asserted in the media that del Castillo was romantically involved with Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, allegations that the actress vehemently denies.[citation needed]\n\nOn August 22, 2005, it was reported by the LAPD that del Castillo's new house in Los Angeles had been broken into by thieves, who took some jewelry from the actress. Del Castillo was in Los Angeles filming Bordertown, a film about the female homicides in Ciudad Juárez, when the burglary occurred. A frequent activist for a variety of causes, she posed in a 2012 PETA ad campaign encouraging pet owners to \"fiercely protect\" their dogs and cats by keeping them indoors.[26] She became a citizen of the United States in September 2015 and resides in Los Angeles.[27]\n\nRelationship with El Chapo\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 9, 2012, del Castillo publicly posted an essay on Twitter (using Twextra) discussing social issues in Mexico[28] that included controversial statements directed towards Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, the infamous head of the Sinaloa Cartel. The essay included requests to Mr. Guzmán to \"deal with love, with good things\" and to \"[begin to] traffic in love.\" The most controversial portion of the essay stated: \"Today I believe more in Chapo Guzmán [than in] the government that hides painful truths from me, that hides the cure for cancer, AIDS, etc., for their own benefit and wealth.\"[29][30][31][32][33][34][excessive citations]\n\nUnbeknownst to del Castillo, Guzmán was a longtime fan who harbored romantic feelings for her. Authorities found DVDs of La Reina del Sur at the safe house stormed during Guzmán's initial capture.[35] Del Castillo was contacted by Guzmán's lawyer to discuss producing a biographical film about Guzmán in 2014.[36] As a result of the meetings, she obtained the rights to his life and was unknowingly placed under CISEN surveillance. Communication increased following Guzmán's escape from prison in July 2015.[36] She received a cell phone and the code names Hermosa and Dama from Guzmán.[37] She brokered an interview between American actor Sean Penn and Guzmán in October 2015, shortly before Mexican Marines recaptured him (del Castillo claims in her documentary for Netflix that she did not know Penn intended to interview the drug lord during the meeting).[38] CISEN later released photographs of del Castillo at the meetings with Guzmán's lawyer and of the arrival of the actress and Penn to Mexico.\n\nAftermath\n\n[edit]\n\nSean Penn and Del Castillo's actions remain under investigation by the Attorney General of Mexico.[37] She was subpoenaed on January 18, 2016, and was to testify before the public prosecutor at the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles.[39] Del Castillo was originally under investigation for money laundering in relation to the planned movie about Guzmán and her tequila brand Honor del Castillo.[40] The investigation was suspended in 2017 as there was no evidence that proved that Guzmán ever paid del Castillo any money.[citation needed]\n\nOn February 5, 2016, a Mexican judge granted del Castillo's petition for an injunction against any arrest related to the federal investigation into her ties with Joaquín Guzmán. The Mexican Attorney General issued a detain-and-interrogate order on del Castillo; however, that would only become effective if del Castillo set foot on Mexican soil. That order was issued after she did not heed a request to voluntarily appear before Mexican prosecutors.[41]\n\nKate del Castillo did not return to Mexico until December 2018 and therefore since the injunction was issued[42] in 2016 and 2017 filming locations for Ingobernable were changed to San Diego to accommodate restrictions on her travel.[citation needed]\n\nThe Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story premiered in 2017 on Netflix, based on the events surrounding del Castillo's communications with El Chapo.[43]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1978 Los de abajo 1990 El último escape Bárbara 1997 Educación sexual en breves lecciones Ana Reclusorio Estrella Uribe Segment: \"Sangre entre mujeres\" 2004 Avisos de ocasión Amanda 2005 American Visa Blanca 2006 Bordertown Elena Díaz Lime Salted Love Isabella Triebel 2007 El precio de la inocencia / Trade Laura The Black Pimpernel Consuelo Fuentes Under the Same Moon Rosario Reyes 2008 Julia Elena Bad Guys Zena 2009 Down for Life Esther 2011 Without Men Cleotilde Huaniso 2012 Colosio: El asesinato Verónica K-11 Mousey 2013 A Miracle in Spanish Harlem Eva 2014 The Book of Life La Muerte (voice) No Good Deed Alexis The Popcorn Chronicles Kate / Rosario Visitantes Ana 2015 The 33 Katy Valdivia de Sepúlveda 2016 El Americano: The Movie Rayito (voice) 2018 All About Nina Lake 2019 El Chicano Cartel Leader 2020 Bad Boys for Life Isabel Aretas 2022 Hunting Ava Bravo Ava Bravo 2023 Dora and the Fantastical Creatures Ale (voice) Short film 2024 The Casagrandes Movie Sisiki (voice) TBA Trap House TBA Post-production TBA The Biggest Fan Lana Cruz Post-production TBA A Cuban Girl's Guide to Tea and Tomorrow[44] TBA Post-production\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1991 Muchachitas Leticia Bustamante Television debut 1992 Mágica juventud Fernanda 1994 Imperio de cristal Narda Lombardo 1995 Mujer, casos de la vida real Unknown role Episode: \"Aunque parezca mentira\" 1996 Azul Alejandra 1997 Alguna vez tendremos alas Ana Hernández Main role 1998 La mentira Verónica Fernández-Negrete Main role; 100 episodes 2000 Ramona Ramona Main role 2001 El derecho de nacer María Elena del Junco Main role 2002 American Family Ofelia 10 episodes 2003 Bajo la misma piel Miranda Murillo Ortiz 2004 Kate Del Castillo en La Riviera Maya Kate Television film 2009 The Cleaner Josefina Episode: \"Does Everybody Have a Drink?\" 2009 Weeds Pilar Zuazo 5 episodes 2009 El Pantera Coco 2 episodes 2011–present La Reina del Sur Teresa Mendoza Main role; 183 episodes 2011 CSI: Miami Anita Torres Episode: \"Killer Regrets\" 2012 Grimm Valentina Espinosa Episode: \"La Llorona\" 2013 Dallas Sergeant Marisela Ruiz Episode: \"JR's Masterpiece\" 2014 Killer Women Esmeralda Montero Episode: \"Queen Bee\" 2015 Dueños del paraíso Anastasia Cardona Main role; 69 episodes 2015 Jane the Virgin Luciana Leon 3 episodes 2016 Telenovela Kate Episode: \"The Rivals\" 2017–2018 Ingobernable Emilia Urquiza Main role; 27 episodes 2017 The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story Herself Main role; 3 episodes 2021 Mr. Mayor Victoria Santos Episode: \"#PalmTreeReform\" 2021 Maya and the Three Lady Micte, the Goddess of Death Main role; 9 episodes 2022 Monster High Selena Wolf 'Til Jail Do Us Part Ángela Main role; 8 episodes 2023 Volver a caer Anna Montes de Oca Main role 2024 Dora Ale the Alebrije (voice) Guest role[45] 2024 The Cleaning Lady Ramona Sanchez Main role\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nAwards and nominations Year Award Category Nominated work Result 1992 Premios TVyNovelas\n\nBest Female Revelation\n\nMuchachitas\n\nNominated 1995 Best young actress\n\nImperio de cristal\n\nWon 1998\n\nAlguna vez tendremos alas\n\nNominated 1999\n\nLa mentira\n\n2005 American Visa 2006\n\nColón de Plata for Best Actress\n\nWon 2008\n\nPremios Diosa de Plata\n\nBest Actress\n\nNominated 2011\n\nBest Actress\n\nLa Reina del Sur Won Best Couple (with Iván Sánchez) Nominated Best Couple (with Rafael Amaya) 2018\n\nBest Actress in a Miniseries or TV series\n\nIngobernable Nominated\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nDraper, Robert (March 21, 2016). \"The go-between : the Mexican actress who dazzled El Chapo\".
