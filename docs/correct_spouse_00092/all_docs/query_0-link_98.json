        "text": "I agree with you on the Caballo-Sandra Paola relationship; too bad it ended. Too be honest with you, I didn't really get him being with Gaby(Sherlyn). Their pairing was one of the weirdest.\n\nAlso, I know its weird to bring this up, but I thought it was weird what they chose to do with the character of Juan David. For some reason, he came off as being more mature in the early episodes (when he was having the affair with the Susan Vohn character) than in the recent episodes. Ever since they made him into John David (with Caballo doing all the singing in the background), it seems that they made Juan David into a totally immature punk. It's a complete deviation from the young kid who, along with Caballo, played such a vital role in helping Francisco clear himself of the false sexual abuse accusations that Sandra Paola made against him. I always thought that it was cool that Juancho stuck by Francisco, considering that they never really got along.\n\nI know I read in some magazine that Iran Castillo was going to be appearing in a telenovela opposite Valentin Lanus; Angelica Maria is supposed to play Castillo's mother. What I don't know if it's the same novela that's going to start on Monday (Sept. 1).\n\nI also read that Roberto Gomez Fernandez, son of Chespirito and producer of \"Locura de Amor\" and \"Juego de La Vida,\" was already in the planning stages of his next telenovela; rumors suggested that Ana Layevska would be among the cast members. Maybe he should consider giving Sara Maldonado a call. She already proved that she has a lot of potential with her performance in both \"Juego de La Vida\" and \"Clase 406.\"\n\nP.S. I didn't really watch the episodes on a regular basis after Jorge Poza (Francisco) left. Whatever happened to Ivan, Magadelena's would be suitor, and to Juan Esteban, Ana Maria, and Chacho.\n\nreply share"
