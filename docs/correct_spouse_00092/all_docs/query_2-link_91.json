        "text": "ST. PETERSBURG — The Rays are trying to salvage their season, keep their boss from trading away key pieces and make another run to the playoffs. With the benefit of an unexpected soft spot in their schedule, facing the struggling Yankees, they could regain needed momentum by winning another series.\n\nThey certainly had their chances Wednesday.\n\nLots of them, actually.\n\nBut the Rays failed repeatedly to take advantage of prime scoring opportunities and lost, 2-1.\n\n“That’s simply frustrating,” first baseman Yandy Diaz said via team interpreter Manny Navarro. “Nobody wants to fail, and I think we failed a few times (Wednesday). We were all trying to do the best that we could, but that’s the game.”\n\nThe details were somewhat ugly. The Rays went a season-worst-matching 0-for-10 with runners in scoring position. They left 12 men on, one shy of their season high. In four consecutive innings, they got at least two runners on but didn’t get any in. They rapped 10 hits and drew five walks but scored only the one run.\n\n“It sucks not to get guys in,” rightfielder Josh Lowe said. “I’m very frustrated with the way (Wednesday’s) game went. I felt like I probably had two solid opportunities to tie the game. ...\n\n“But it’s baseball, man. The game gives you opportunities. You’ve got to capitalize. The team who capitalizes the most is the team that’s going to win ballgames. We didn’t do that (Wednesday), so we’ve got to find a way to come out and do that (Thursday).”\n\nThe loss dropped the Rays to 45-47. After winning five straight series, they will have to win Thursday’s rubber game to avoid losing a second in a row. They face the American League-best Guardians this weekend in their final series before the All-Star break, then play at the Yankees and Blue Jays before returning home to take on the Reds ahead of the July 30 trade deadline.\n\nA byproduct of their anemic offensive showing was wasting a strong start by Zach Eflin, who went seven innings, allowing only the two runs on four hits and a walk. He struck out six while throwing a season-high 103 pitches, retiring 12 of the last 13 batters he faced.\n\n“I felt pretty good,” Eflin said. “Most of the game, it felt like we were keeping them off-balance. (Catcher) Ben (Rortvedt) did a great job behind the plate and called a great game. But at the end of day it was a loss, so it’s hard to feel good about how I threw.”\n\nThe Yankees, who had lost 16 of their previous 21, took advantage of a couple of plays the Rays didn’t make.\n\nIn the second inning, Trent Grisham drove a ball into the leftfield corner that Rays leftfielder Randy Arozarena chased toward the low wall but pulled up a few steps short. The ball hit off the yellow padding and stayed in play as a run-scoring double.\n\nIn the fourth, with Gleyber Torres on first after a leadoff walk, Diaz gloved Anthony Volpe’s grounder and stepped on first base for one out but sailed his throw to second. Torres went to third on the error and scored on Grisham’s sacrifice fly.\n\n“Just a bad throw,” Diaz said. “I simply just overthrew it. I tried to get the out, and I couldn’t do it.”\n\nThe Rays got their first two batters on in the fifth and four of the first five but scored only run, which turned out to be an omen of what was to come.\n\nEx-Yankee Rortvedt led off with a single and Taylor Walls followed with another, putting runners on the corners. Diaz’s grounder to third scored Rortvedt, and the Rays went on to load the bases. The Yankees brought in Tim Hill. Manager Kevin Cash let Josh Lowe stay in to face the lefty, but he struck out and Arozarena lined out to right.\n\nCash said he liked the matchup and, since it was only the fifth inning, the chance to keep Lowe in the lineup. “It ended up he came up again twice, but just as a whole we just did not get the big hit,” Cash said.\n\nThe Rays had another prime chance in the sixth after Richie Palacios and Jose Siri got them started with singles. But Rortvedt couldn’t get a bunt down against Hill and struck out, and Walls grounded into a double play.\n\nIn the seventh, Brandon Lowe and Isaac Paredes drew one-out walks, but Josh Lowe, who was 0-for-5 for the night, flied out and Arozarena struck out.\n\nThey looked like they might break through in the eighth when Rortvedt singled with two outs, Walls walked, and Diaz laced a ball off closer Clay Holmes to right-center that would have put them ahead had it landed, but Grisham ran it down.\n\n“Baseball is going to baseball,” Eflin said. “It just felt like it wasn’t our night.’'\n\n• • •\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida."
