Back then all you heard concerning women + H!P was like that episode of the waitress at a restaurant publicly posting on her mixi about how disgusting she thought all the wota customers at work were.\n\n2: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 18:56:16.77 0.net\n\nI think it was definitely in large part thanks to them uploading so much material on YouTube. Young girls nowadays don’t watch any TV, they just sit in their rooms watching YouTube on their smartphones.\n\n5: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 19:00:43.87 0.net\n\nI remember laughing about how they called us all “kibonnu.”\n\n3: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 18:58:36.34 0.net\n\nTen years ago I attended a handshake event for v-u-den’s Ajisai, and only about 20 of the 1200 people there were girls.\n\n22: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 19:05:51.08 0.net\n\nThere’s no one left to deny that there really are more female wota nowadays, right?

It’s obvious that the office now mainly focuses on attracting more female fans, and little by little it looks like their plan is working. I think eventually they hope to become something like a new Takarazuka.\n\n59: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 19:37:48.22 0.net\n\nAnd do you have some kind of a source as to the number of female fans having actually increased?\n\n61: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 19:39:47.06 0.net\n\n>>59\n\nHow about actually attending an event or a concert and seeing for yourself?\n\n36: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 19:16:05.94 0.net\n\nAt concerts it’s only about 30% women, but when you go to live viewings it’s more like 60%.\n\n37: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 19:16:50.75 0.net\n\nI guess the costume coordination corner is effective.\n\n43: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 19:22:30.98 0.net\n\nI’ve been going to their concerts since 2004. Back then there simply were no women.\n\n44: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 19:22:41.53 0.net\n\nI swear, Michishige’s graduation live viewing was pretty much all girls.\n\n74: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 19:46:54.90 O.net\n\nThere started to be more female wota in around 2010 — I’m guessing that was in large part thanks to AKB. But what I don’t get is how, in recent years, when you go to an event you’ll see that pretty much literally half of all wota are females. Why is this?\n\n102: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 20:02:09.75 0.net\n\nIt was so weird being at Michishige’s graduation tour last year. I only went to Osaka, but there were so many girls there it was silly. At least 25% were women, and not only that, but most of them were young and pretty, too. I think there might have been more women there than at Perfume’s tour.\n\n111: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 20:08:08.47 0.net\n\nI got into H!P when I was starting to get tired of Perfume. This was around 2011.\n\n104: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 20:02:53.74 0.net\n\nMeet the H!P wota of today:\n\n121: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 20:17:00.91 0.net\n\nhttp://rocketnews24.com/2014/11/12/508775/\n\nhttp://rocketnews24.com/2014/10/02/493364/\n\nhttp://rocketnews24.com/2014/09/16/486681/\n\n138: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 20:36:45.48 0.net\n\nI spoke to the young girl sitting next to me at a °C concert before it started. By the time we started hitting it off talking about the Kenshuusei, I was pretty much ready to propose to her.\n\n168: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 21:02:05.49 0.net\n\nWhen I went to the Berryz Budokan live viewing, sitting to the right of me were these two really cute gyaru type girls, and to the left of me was this insanely cool old guy who looked like Kitaouji Kinya. I just thought to myself, “man, H!P’s fan base has a really wide age range.“\n\n3. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月27日 23:08 ID:9te44PQW0\n\nAt a 2014 Budokan concert, honestly 70% or 80% of the people around me were all girls, and they were all university age or girls who’d just began their OL careers. Anyway, if you wanted to know the why, it’d be faster to just ask the girls directly.\n\n7. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月27日 23:48 ID:HuOwhvUk0\n\nSerious reply: I think it’s basically people who’ve gotten bored of AKB or Momoclo and they’ve moved on to H!P as a result. That’s how it happened to most of the female wota around me anyway. It just makes me feel like they’re going to get bored of H!P, too, before long.\n\n8. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 00:13 ID:8FSTDiWX0\n\nI, too, got bored of Perfume and got hooked on H!P through Berryz. It’s not that I hate Perfume now or anything, but hearing girls like Risako, Karin-chan or Miyabi-chan, I just thought “wow, these girls can really sing.” Their talks are funny too, thanks in large part to Momochi, and thanks to their long history they have so many awesome songs, too. And above all, the concerts are just so much fun.\n\n9. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 00:13 ID:cj8Lu.EC0\n\nI don’t think there are that many “pairing” wota. The only fans who view them like that must come from an anime otaku background or something. I personally got to know the current Musume through Dream Morning Musume, and I was just surprised to see how much Takahashi Ai-chan had grown (because I still had an image of her being the way she was when she’d just joined.) I got hooked on them instantly. They’re such good singers, they’re so cute, their dancing is amazing… I just thought H!P is amazing. Then I got hooked on Berryz and °C-ute and noticed how cute everyone in Kenshuusei was, too.\n\nI now totally get the feelings of the wota who feel like they want to watch over the members in a parental way. The top members of H!P have real talent, so there’s a lot there for girls to admire, too.\n\n10. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 00:18 ID:nW2L0v620\n\nThe Morning Musume boom happened when I was in elementary school. They were at the top of the charts and on TV constantly so you’d hear their songs almost as if by accident, and then during the 5th gen auditions I remember thinking how cute Takahashi Ai-chan was. But then their fame just fizzled away.\n\nMuch later I happened to see the news about Takahashi Ai-chan’s graduation and I wondered what Morning Musume was up to these days, so I looked them up on YouTube and got hooked. I felt like I wanted to hear Ai-chan singing live at least once before her graduation, so I joined the fan club, bought some concerts tickets, got even more hooked on their songs, and then attended my first concert.\n\n12. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 00:40 ID:mKGWXzdy0\n\nThe “pseudo-lesbian thing“? Excuse me? (laughs) So even guys are aware of that sort of thing. But honestly, that’s something that’s been around for ages (the part of the fandom who love the member couplings). I don’t think that’s the main reason H!P attracted so many new female fans.\n\nPersonally I have some dance experience as well, and I got hooked after seeing Rihoriho’s super energetic dancing in One Two Three. The fact that they now have so much support from fellow girls really proves their ability in my opinion. I think many girls also like Johnny’s because they have some of the same appeal as H!P: they both have members who are pushed to the background because they’re unable to show their true ability, they both have that sense of the members being rivals as well as good friends, and because they’re all dedicating their youth to improving their singing and dancing skills.\n\nI don’t think “Cool Hello” is necessary — as long as H!P has the above things, the female fans will keep on coming. ^^ I know from experience that female wota do buy the goods with cute outfits as well (like photos and stuff). °C’s Sekai Ichi, for example, was very popular with women, too.\n\nSooner or later the “Era of Warring Idols” will end, and I think the only groups who will remain after that will be the ones with true ability.\n\n13. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 01:56 ID:e9zTrquW0\n\nI was watching AKB one day and I just thought to myself “I wonder what H!P are doing nowadays?” So I checked out some videos and was instantly hooked. This was back in 2010. Oh, and yeah, I’m a female wota. I like how it feels like they didn’t get to where they are now because of some sales tactics or whatever, but because of hard work. (laughs) (Although there are times I wish the office would work a bit harder yet. (laughs))\n\n15. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 02:17 ID:LU0cv5tI0\n\nI used to be super into H!P between around 2001 and 2005. I got bored of them around the time I started university, and when I got back to them after graduate school in 2011, I once again became a wota thanks to YouTube. The office seriously owes a lot to YouTube.\n\n20. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 06:27 ID:THZ.EdK20\n\nI kind of feel a little bit lonely that it’s no longer this meeting place solely for us chosen ones; the perverted gentlemen. At the same time, I bet the members themselves are happy about having more female wota.\n\n22. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 08:27 ID:1UPkJsVd0\n\nI was watching Shugo Chara when I saw Buono! during the commercial break and thought they looked somehow familiar, so I looked them up and realized they were the same elementary schoolers I saw back when Musume was still popular. I further researched them on YouTube and got hooked on Berikyuu. ( ＾ω＾ ) I think it was around two years later that I actually started going to their concerts.\n\n23. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 08:47 ID:tb7C9Ij60\n\nIt really feels like the seeds they earnestly planted during Platinum Era finally bloomed during Colorful Era. I, too, first got hooked on them after seeing the dance to Naichau Kamo and the live video of SONGS on YouTube. I think there might be quite a lot of girls who became fans because they looked up to Ai-chan and Sayu.\n\n31. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 16:00 ID:MoU4FdyM0\n\nI think we’ll see a decrease in the number of female fans in a year or two.\n\n33. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 18:52 ID:KdhKEyjZ0\n\nSpeaking as a female wota, I just want to say that Cool Hello had nothing to do with me becoming a fan! On the contrary, I wish they’d go back to their old style of wota T’s, and that they’d bring back °C’s old logo. Also, guys might not understand this, but Tsunku♂-san’s songs are a very important part of it. I can sympathize so much with lyrics featuring powerful females.\n\n34. 春風 2015年04月28日 20:44 ID:oWgtU9wnO\n\nI love Tsunku♂-san’s lyrics! (^-^) And I love Momochi!\n\n35. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 20:46 ID:oWgtU9wnO\n\nI just think it’s amazing that they can dance like that and not lip-sync.\n\n37. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 21:12 ID:mv3BX5oj0\n\nI was originally into them during Golden Era, but I lost interest in 2004. Then just two or three years ago I was suddenly wondering whatever happened to Berryz Koubou, so I looked them up and started getting more and more drawn to them, and that’s how I got back into H!P. It might be mainly because I liked Miyabi-chan and Risako’s sense of fashion. Plus, they’re cute.\n\n39. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月28日 23:20 ID:6wLJJ8AJ0\n\n① The generation of fans who liked Minimoni, Koharu and Berikyuu as kids have grown up and are now able to support themselves financially.\n\n② Thanks in part to AKB, people now have less hangups about actually attending events or concerts.\n\n③ Smartphones and such have become much more popular.\n\nEspecially with H!P and groups like Berikyuu where you can go back and find records of what they’ve been doing starting from the very day they joined Hello! Project up until the present day, ③ is what lets people easily find out about all that greatness.\n\nNow, as for popularity-increasing ideas the office itself comes up with…? Well… (^o^;)\n\n44. 名無しプロジェクト 2015年04月30日 22:40 ID:TjxDW.WO0\n\nIt started with me just saving Sayu’s selfies that I found on the net. Then I started listening to the songs, beginning with Wagamama Ki no Mama Ai no Joke. I learned that the members were updating their blogs every day, I found an easy-to-read matome site to follow, and I started watching Hello! Station to stay up-to-date. I got hooked on Sayu’s live videos and the perverted talks on her radio show. I felt like I had to see her live at least once before her graduation, and that’s how I came to attend my first concert.\n\nI don’t really follow any of the other groups. I wonder why I chose H!P…?\n\nThe one thing I can say is that I highly respect all of their members.\n\n198: 名無し募集中。。。 2015/04/27(月) 21:23:34.02 0.net\n\nYou know, I actually think The Girls Live might’ve played a pretty big part in attracting so many new female fa-… Wait. No. No, it didn’t.\n\nHenkka: For many years, my girlfriend (more recently, wife) used to hate Hello! Project and idols altogether. When I say she hated them, I really do mean she hated them; this wasn’t mere disinterest or anything cute like that. Being Japanese, she knew exactly what idols and Hello! Project were about and she fiercely hated everything about it. She didn’t want to hear about it or know about it, and if given the choice, I reckon she probably would’ve rather had me not be a fan of Hello! Project either. (She never did actually ask me to give up my hobby because, thankfully, she isn’t a shitty person.) In other words, she was the last person you would’ve expected to ever be into idols in any meaningful way, and this remained the case for several years after we first met.\n\n(Can you sense a “but” coming?)\n\nBut, much like myself, she had always been a big music lover. So one day in 2013 when Tsunku put out another one of his recent masterpieces — a song I would to this day describe as fucking amazing — I figured I had to have her hear it. Remembering her dislike of idols, I did the sensible thing and played her the instrumental version.\n\nThat’s pretty much all it took. It wasn’t a very long process from that day until her hate of Hello! Project had entirely transformed into love. She discovered her first oshi, sang her first H!P songs in karaoke, began watching their TV appearances and such regularly, bought her first H!P books, and attended her first event — when I explained to her that the event itself was free to attend and you only had to buy a CD if you wanted a round of handshakes with Morning Musume, she quickly explained to me that she would be buying the CD because, as she put it, “I want to touch them.”\n\nThe other day, I asked her if she remembers how she used to deeply hate H!P not that long ago. She did, and she couldn’t explain why exactly this had been the case. Obviously a big part of her overcoming it was the music, but then the good music has always been there: we’ve since gone through the archives together and she’s realized she loves old H!P music (from the time she was supposed to hate them) just as much as she does the newer material. So why did she not realize the music was right up her alley until I pointed it out to her? Surely her musical tastes hadn’t changed that much over the years, we agreed.\n\nI proposed something that she did not necessarily fully agree with, and yet, she agreed I might’ve been on to something. I said that perhaps she’d simply been at the right point in her life to finally become a fan: maybe she hated me being a fan of idols five years ago because some part of her figured they were somehow in direct competition with her; that she thought I enjoyed them in part because they had something that she did not; because she felt inferior to them.\n\nI was reminded of the interview with Inuyama Kamiko I translated some time ago.\n\nInuyama: The fact that I can now say “I like H!P” is because of my new way of looking at them, or rather because I’m not trying to compete with them anymore. Back when Momusu was first popular I was the same age as them, so it was difficult for me to cheer them on. I knew they were cute and everything but because we had our ages in common, it somehow made me not want to recognize that. But now at this age the only thing I have in common with them is my gender. Now when I see a cute girl like that, I can genuinely say “aww, she’s so cute!”\n\n[…]\n\nWhen I watch them, it’s no longer my 31-year-old self; it feels like I’m back to being the same age as them. […] For people who in their student days got the appeal of idols but didn’t want to admit it to themselves, people with regrets like “I would’ve wanted a life of sparkles and glitter like that“, people who despised cool or sexy girls, thinking of themselves as somehow inferior — for people like that who have grown up and who can now finally freely admit that they like idols, it might be something that allows them to feel like they’re reliving their youth.\n\nSome years ago I had my wife watch a °C-ute music video and and I asked her what she thought. All she really had to say back then was that she thought they looked ugly. Now: she wishes she could sing like Airi, that she could be friends with Okai, and that she could somehow have Maimi’s face. (She still thinks Nacky kind of looks like a fish, but doesn’t everyone?)\n\nAll of which is just a long-winded way of saying: for this particular woman, her becoming a H!P fan was — in more or less equal parts I suppose — thanks to the music and the passage of time."
