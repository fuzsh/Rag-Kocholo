        "text": "The purpose of this study was to understand the experiences of media consumption of Japanese popular culture among Malaysian young adults. Such a study is important in order to understand the consequence of the consumption of foreign cultural products since the development of information and communication technology has brought changes to media entertainment consumption styles, especially among the younger generation. This article discusses the ‘accumulation’ of Japanese popular culture as part of media consumption experiences. Through the interpretation of some young Malaysians’ experiences, the accumulation was found to be an important part of media consumption in developing the young Malaysians’ mindset towards specific formats, genres or products from Japan despite the differences that exist between the lifestyles of the Japanese and the Malaysians. The paper highlights that the contents of Japanese popular cultural products are crucial. Without a sophisticated depiction of ‘an essential human aspect’ to which young Malaysians could relate, Japanese popular culture would not be well-liked.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to understand the media consumption experiences of Japanese popular culture among Malaysians. Such a study is important in order to understand the consequence of the consumption of foreign cultural products since the development of information communication technology has brought changes to the consumption styles of media entertainment, especially among the younger generation. The hermeneutic phenomenological approach, a qualitative research methodology, was employed in this study. This approach was considered the most appropriate for describing and understanding individual media consumption experiences in a particular context. Twelve Malaysian young adults were selected by criterion and snowball sampling techniques. In-depth interviews, which lasted between fifty minutes to three hours, were conducted by this researcher. Each interview was recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed via thematic analysis. The other documents related to the production,...\n\nYoung people of today have been described as ‘digital natives’ (Prensky, 2001a, 2001b). Interest is growing worldwide, not only in the west. However, this idea is criticised as being essentialist, technologically deterministic or western-centered. This chapter briefly discusses general criticisms concerning the discourse of digital natives as well as relevant discourses within the social context of Japan. Secondly, I outline the history and current trends of mobile internet use among Japanese youth, before investigating Japanese youth and mobile media in everyday life, using data from my ethnography, conducted between 2000 and 2010. I discuss freedom and control, opportunities and risks, and de-traditionalisation and reflexive traditionalisation. Finally, I examine the implications for young people, digital media and education in today’s mobile-saturated society.\n\nFrom the theoretical perspective regarding communication as culture, this article focuses on the communicative dimension of cultural processes in contemporary times. Its objective is to report and discuss the widespread image of the social group referred to as Otaku, which is characterized by great ambivalence resulting from its Japanese origin and its subsequent insertion into mediatized imagery on a worldwide scale. In Japan, Otaku imagery carries the negative connotation of individuals who are fanatical about the consumption of entertainment-industry products, have little inclination for social life, and are associated with psycho-pathological and criminal behavior. In Asia and Brazil, the term Otaku has come to designate fans of Japanese pop culture but is characterized by its reference to a youth in search of informational exchanges and new modes of social interaction within urban life. It is concluded that Otaku imagery in the mundialized culture is altered to the extent that ..."
