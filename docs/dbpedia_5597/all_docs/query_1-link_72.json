This latest cross media product (the Code Age franchise already exists as a comic and a cell phone game) arrived at Japanese retail in PS2 threads for the first time. IGN will have full impressions for you next week, but those considering an import should do so without hesitation. While we had some problems with the game's control initially, we've gotten involved with the storyline and the character customization elements, and can't wait to play more.\n\nIn other news from Japan, budget titles are showing no signs of letting up -- a good thing for consumers, considering how expensive Japanese games are. The PSP will soon get a couple of budget series. From D3 comes the Simple 2500 Series, a line of 2500 yen titles exclusively for the PSP. The company's similar DS lineup already has 8 entries, with the PS2 lineup having crossed the 90 mark! D3 won't have the budget market to itself on the PSP, though, as Sony and its third parties have announced plans to make their early PSP titles available at 2800 yen starting this November.\n\nThis week's Gaming Life in Japan has, in addition to lots of pics from around Tokyo, a look at two magazines and a few commercials and print ads just a few pages down.\n\nBut first, turn the page for Ginza Walking.\n\nGINZA WALKING\n\nDo you remember the \"Store Joutai Get\" section that we used to have every-so-often (well, pretty much every week, actually) here in Gaming Life in Japan? It's back, only now we're calling it Something-Something Walking. We'll occasionally take our cameras out as we go game shopping, and take pictures for you, often being very sneaky about it since the polite sales clerks in Japan raise a big fuss when customers take pictures.\n\nPreviously, we went out on a trip to Shinjuku. This was followed by a trips to Ikebukuro and to Akihabara. Last week, we visited Shibuya on the eve of the Advent Children and GB Micro launches.\n\nFor this week's XXXX Walking column, we headed out to one of Tokyo's more lavish spots, Ginza. Known for its high class brands and equally high prices, Ginza is the last place you'd expect to go for a videogame hunt. However, the main strip in Ginza is home to the official Sony Building, which just started Sony's new PlayStation Spot download service. Since we had to go there anyway to take a few pictures of the new attraction, we decided to see what other videogame shops we could find in the area.\n\nAny questions about these pictures? Any Japanese-based game pictures of your own to share? Send your goods to the IGN Japan mailbag.\n\nTurn the page for the past week in review.\n\nTHIS WEEK'S TOPICS\n\nIn this section, we list all our Japanese content from the week prior.

Print them out and hold them in your hand as you read!\n\nFAMITSU -- NO. 880\n\nAnother issue of Famitsu, another girl on the cover. The lovely Mami Yamasaki takes the honors this week. Mami-chan is an Osaka native who was born September 20, 1985, and now some 20 years later, stands a tall, sexy, sexy, tall 169cm (1 inch = 2.5 cm). Somehow, Mami manages to be attractive despite being blood type B. There's no game connection here, but Mami is a regular on an English language learning program on NHK, which we're sure is viewed by Xbox owners eager to figure out what the latest World Collection game is about.\n\nFamitsu has a few big scoops in this issue. First up is an interview with Mistwalker's Hironobu Sakaguchi, discussing the studio's all-new ASH: Archaic Sealed Heat for the DS. We've already provided details from the interview over at IGNDS. The DS theme continues with a full report on Nintendo's new WiFi program.\n\nOther games getting big coverage in the magazine include Super Donkey Kong 3 for GBA, which now has a release date of 12/1, and Baten Kaitos II, also due on 12/1. The magazine features the debut of Nintendo's GameCube Densetsu no Quiz and Sting's Game Boy Advance Yggdra Union as well as first details on the Japanese version of King Kong, which is set for PS2 release through Ubisoft in December. Also debuting in this issue is the Simple 2500 series. This time, D3 brings the simple idea to the PSP.\n\nWe're accustomed to Famitsu providing a look back at the first half of the year in one of its July issues. This mid-October issue also has a huge look back at the first half of the year -- the financial year, that is. The magazine gives a huge sales reports games and hardware for the period between 3/28 and 10/4.\n\nThe best selling game over the period was Konami's World Soccer Winning Eleven 9 for PS2, which managed sales of 884,130. Nintendogs managed second place, with 697,940 units across its three versions. Nintendo's Otona no DS Training came in third with 615,074 units, followed by Bandai's PS2 Super Robot Taisen Alpha 3, which managed 592,506 units. Following this are Mushi King (Sega, GBA, 559,772), Yawaraka Atama Juku (Nintendo, DS, 531,750), Romancing Saga (Square Enix, PS2, 454,321), Gundam One Year War (Bandai, PS2, 424,591), Powerful Pro Baseball 12 (Konami, PS2, 423,640) and Jump Superstars (Nintendo, DS, 375,745).\n\nIn hardware sales, DS comes out on top, with 1,312,173 units. PS2 follows at 848,511. Following these two top sellers are PSP (761,089), Game Boy Advance SP (335,440), Game Boy Micro (228,886), Game Boy Advance (13,340) and Xbox (5,961).\n\nAlso featured in this issue is a huge survey. Famitsu polled 2,082 people on a number of gaming issues. The magazine reached people from all over Japan, although Tokyo, Chiba and Kanagawa got the most feedback. Of those who listed their sex, girls numbered 197 while boys numbered 1,195. Responders came from a variety of backgrounds, with the 29.5 percent working at companies, 18.8% high schoolers, 14.4% losers who live their life by taking on part time jobs and 12.6% college students.\n\nThe next generation is of most interest in this survey. First, Xbox 360. The magazine asked for opinions on the 39,795 yen price. Of the 1,887 responders, 55.3% thought the system was a bit too pricey, with 22.7% feeling it to be way too high and 17.8% feeling the price point is just right. The remaining 4.2% want to pay more!\n\nInterest in the Xbox 360 seems to be pretty low. Only 23.9% listed that they want the system, with 25.2% stating that they don't want it. Of those who want it, 82.8% listed that the controller design is nice, with 53.9% listing that they like the system's capabilities, and 41.9% giving the nod to the removable hard disk. Strangely, 23.7% believe that the system will be able to play most Xbox games -- uh oh!\n\nPS3 seems to command more interest, with 63.2% of the 1,943 responders stating that they want it, compared to just 4.9% who state that they don't. Those who want the system primarily like its functionality, with a strong software lineup coming in second and backwards compatibility third. A few responders even like the controller design.\n\nResponders expect the PS3 to cost quite a bit, with 40.9% of the 1,954 responses listing an expected price of 30001 to 40000 yen (this is the PS2 price range). The next most popular price bracket is 40001 to 5000 yen. The extremes get some representation as well: 0.7% for 80001+ yen and 2.5% for below 20000 yen.\n\nIn terms of software, for Xbox 360, Dead or Alive 4 garners the most interest, followed by Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, Ridge Racer 6 and Final Fantasy XI. For PS3, Metal Gear Solid 4 is the clear winner, followed by Resident Evil 5, the Final Fantasy series, Devil May Cry 4 and the Dragon Quest series (the latter was never announced... but oh well!).\n\nRevolution is, of course, the more mysterious of the three next generation systems. Of the 1836 responders, 36.0% stated that they want the system while 10.4% stated that they don't want it. The largest group, 40.6%, claimed to be unsure at the moment. These people want to wait and see the software lineup (72%) while others have worries about the system's functionality (60.6%) and the system's price (49.3%).\n\nThe controller seems to be a somewhat polarizing issue. For those who claimed to want the system in the above question, the controller was given as a reason by 41.7%. For those who don't want the system, 24% list the controller design as a problem. When asked if seeing the controller changed their desire for the system, 35.6% said that there wasn't much of a change, but 31.1% stated that they want the system more.\n\nMany expect the Revolution to cost less than its competitors. The 20001 to 30000 yen price bracket (the range for the Cube) is the most popular, taking 51.2% of the 1,686 responses. The second most popular response was 30001 to 40000 yen, selected by 31.9%. Coming in third is 20000 yen, selected by 7.0%.\n\nThe portable systems lead this week's review list.\n\nGAMESYSTEMPUBSCOREBurnout RevengePS2Electronic Arts9,9,9,9Shuffle on the StagePS2Kadokawa Shoten4,7,5,6Simple 2000 Series Vol.79: Akko ni Omakase!

While the magazine has a few pages devoted to the PSP sequel, the big focus of the issue is Shadow of the Colossus, with ten pages of artwork, screenshots, game details and even an interview with the producer and director.\n\nOther PS2 games featured in the issue include Gensou Suikoden V, Rogue Galaxy, Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence, Tales of the Abyss, Gundam Seed: Federation VS Z.A.F.T., Biohazard 4, Kingdom Hearts II, Shin Onimusha, Ryu ga Gotoku and Soul Calibur III -- all part of a preview section sponsored by one of IGN's favorite Japanese retailers, Tsutaya (where else by Tsutaya will you find hot girls browsing the racks of the videogame magazine section?).\n\nWhile Famitsu tends to get most of the big game scoops, Dengeki occasionally gets a few exclusives. The last issue featured the world exclusive on Disgaea II. This month, the magazine has first details on a few smaller games, including Fragments Blue, Galaxy Angel II, Caltagura, and Kino no Tabi II The Beautiful Worlds.\n\nContinuing strategy guides are included for the likes of Code Age, Tales of Legendia and Rhapsodia. For Rhapsodia, the magazine is continuing with its ratings for the game's cast of characters. Each character is reviewed by two reviewers, complete with a score. The magazine reviews fourteen characters this issue, of which Kika scores the highest, at 95 and 95 from both reviewers.\n\nJust a few reviews in this week's issue. Yes, it's the slow part of the month.\n\nGAMESYSTEMPUBSCORECode Age CommandersPS2Square Enix85,80,85,75Prince of PersiaPS2Ubisoft85,85,90,80Fuku Fuku no ShimaPSPSCE95,70,90,70Rasatsu AlternativePS2Kogado Studio80,75,80,65D1 Grand Prix 2005PS2Yukes65,70,65,70\n\nAny questions or thoughts on these magazines?
