        "text": "What a strange title. And so I thought this might be a strange but interesting isekai anime. But yeah, I misinterpreted the title because Okashi Na Tensei isn’t about some strange reincarnation but a reincarnation of a dude who is going to create his own sweets kingdom in this isekai. Heh. What a play on words. And so this season we have yet another isekai anime and this time the pastry/sweets/candy/confectionary theme gets its turn for isekai glory. Sort of. When an up and coming young chef dies in this world, how can he fulfil his dream of creating his own sweets kingdom? That’s right. Reincarnating in isekai is always the answer. What a piece of cake. Cakewalk. Now that’s just sweet.\n\nEpisode 1\n\nIn some world pastry tournament, some guy thinks he can win this and make his dream come true. Only, the huge candy sculpture he made crashes on him! OMFG! WHAT THE HECK DID HE PUT INTO THAT SCULPTURE THAT COULD KILL???!!! As he lies dying and regretting if only he could make his own sweets kingdom, I guess blaming God did the trick because God now grants his wish! OMFG! Are you kidding me?! And so he is reincarnated in this fantasy world as Pastry “Pas” Mille Morteln. He is the son of Casserole, a fief of his land. He toiled it for 20 years and now it is successfully growing wheat and barley. Now Pas is 9 years old and they have a bumper crop this season thanks to Pas’ wisdom in planting the crops. Obviously he retained memories of his past life and can’t reveal it to others. Casserole’s retainer, Sheet Beatwin reports that bandits have escaped from Retes County and are most likely to run into this village in 2 months. There’s about 50 of them. While Casserole can use his authority to seek help from the count, this however would give the count a bad reputation. As such, in the future they won’t get more reinforcements. So the only obvious solution is to let them ravage the land? WTF?! Sheet has a plan but it is a huge gamble. It involves Pas and this means having him undergo some sanctification ceremony in the capital. It might be a bit too young for him but Casserole has judged Pas good with the sword and pen so I guess he is accomplished. Next day, everybody sees the father and son off. First time Pas is at the capital and he is excited to see all kinds of foods and ingredients. Can’t wait to make different types of sweets. Especially those sweet juicy apples. WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY ARE CALLED BONKAS?! Are you bonkers?! They see this panda priest who starts the ceremony. Uhm, looks like some torture? Because Pas being tied up and blindfolded in a room with nothing. Some explanation how hardship will bring out one’s magic. Whatever. After 2 days, it ends. Pas doesn’t even feel a thing since his mind was preoccupied with making sweets. As the priest reads the scripture, Pas feels some sort of magic coming into him. It appears he has acquired some power unheard of this world. Casserole pays the priest as thanks but later as we see, he is some sneaky traitor because this amount of money isn’t going to make him keep his mouth shut. Pas and Casserole return home as they enjoy the best apples they bought. Oh sorry, it’s BONKAS!\n\nEpisode 2\n\nLooks like the bandits have ravaged a village. Nothing left. With word of this reaching Casserole, he knows they’ll arrive here soon as expected. Everyone works hard to fortify their village. Pas’ childhood friends, Marcarullo “Marc” Doroba and Luminito “Lumi” Aidilichpa offer to help as his ‘lieutenants’. Pas has an idea and has them gather rocks. But as dusk falls, the kids hear the sound of horse gallops inching closer in the distance. The bandits are here. They rush back to tell everyone as Casserole revs up everyone’s spirits to fight the bandits and protect their village. They then discuss if the bandits will attack at night. Obviously the villagers have home ground advantage but Casserole believes the bandits are low on supplies and will attack out of desperation. He and Sheet will head out as decoy to ambush the enemy and Pas will be in charge while they are gone. Casserole and Sheet manage to ambush the bandits. In disarray, the duo then lead the bandits to chase them. Once the bandits are in place, the kids start throwing rocks (some with fire?!) at the bandits to throw them off their course. This might not be enough to defeat them but it is all part of Pas’ plan to cause chaos and buy enough time for Casserole and Sheet to manoeuvre freely. The bandit boss makes a daring move by leaping over the moat (damn, is he a long jumper?!) and climbing up the wall (is he a wall climbing pro?!). With some of his men also breaking through, all hell breaks loose. Some villagers get slashed as they fight back. Bandit boss plays dirty by targeting the kids. Pas protects them and gets his arm cut. Pas is then taken hostage. What now? Pas notices a bandit squirming in pain from the fire rock. He uses his magic to replicate that pain on all the other bandits. After Pas is freed, the rest knock out the bandits. Wow. That was easy. So why didn’t Pas use this earlier? Must they be in a certain range?\n\nEpisode 3\n\nAll the bandits are rounded up and put in the shed. Casserole plans to talk to their count for proper compensation and reward. But first, he rewards his villagers for their effort. This includes giving Marc and Lumi a sword and a bag of barley. Later Marc and Lumi want to go see the bandits. They think it would do them some good to learn since they will one day help govern this village. So as they sneak in, the bandit boss claims Marc is holding his sword. Since he will die, he wants to pass it down before his execution. Learning it will also allow him to use magic. So come closer and he’ll whisper in your ear. Naïve Marc does so despite Lumi’s warning. Bandit boss’ ropes are already loose so he kicks Marc and takes the sword to free himself. Then he makes a slash on Lumi’s guts (but not fatal), takes Marc as hostage and flees on a horse. He won’t bother to even help free his men. When word goes out, Pas immediately chases after them. Casserole also learns of this but is told by Sheet to remain to maintain the villagers’ morale. He will go after Pas. Bandit boss walks into a trap set near the field. Pas then fights him but his sword broke. Before he gets cut, some magic happens. As Sheet is tracking down Pas and finds no sign of him, his worst fear comes true when he sees the broken sword. How will he tell his lord? But when he returns, he is shocked to see Pas at home. How did he miss him even on the way back? This is when Pas reveals his magic is to replicate things including other people’s spell. Hence he replicated Casserole’s teleport magic. Though, the bandit boss got away. Of course Pas gets lectured by father about the dangers of using magic in battle. Thank goodness his magic worked well otherwise who would’ve known what effects it would have on him. He forbids him to let anyone know about this. Pas and Marc go visit Lumi who is doing well. Marc feels ashamed and apologizes although it is no big deal for Lumi. Pas makes apple pies to reconcile. Oh I’m sorry, it’s bonka pies! He even has a sour version of it. This is a lesson that despite from the same fruit, real skills are needed to harmonize the flavours. Hence all this is a lesson for Marc to help deepen his character. Glacage (Lumi’s dad) might sound he is not happy about his daughter wounded. But he lets it slide as long as Marc takes responsibility by marrying her! Lumi doesn’t mind. That’s another experience to deepen the flavour for him!\n\nEpisode 4\n\nWith all the rebuilding, looks like they’re running out of money. Pas wonders if asking his grandparents would help but as Casserole points out, his marriage to Agnes was against their parents’ wishes. So they eloped and cut ties with them. As Pas brainstorms with Marc and Lumi on how to make money, this leads to them asking Pas to show off his magic by replicating their kiddie drawings on the ground on to their hand. Exact duplicate. This leads to Lumi wondering if he could replicate something real as a picture and this gives Pas a great idea. He talks to father about a great way to make money. His sister, Josephine is now at a marriageable age. By noble standards, she has to be paraded to make herself known. The most efficient way to do that is a ball but that is expensive. This is when Pas uses his magic to replicate a picture of mom onto a piece of wood. They can use this detailed photo to get some money and pitch to parents who are seeking arranged marriages. While this might expose Pas’ magic, they will only make it known to others that it is only applicable to pictures. After all, can’t hide it forever, no? Casserole and Pas soon make their way to Retes County to see Brioche Salgrade Mille Retes. As her predecessors died in war, she became the heir at a young age. So as they start with all the formalities, Pas surprises her when he initiates the negotiations, especially about the need for proper compensation from the attack. Brioche feigns ignorance even when accused the bandits escaped from her territory. And when she asks for proof they defeated the bandits, they show one of the bandits’ sword. It has her family crest on it. This proves they have failed to contain them. Brioche has no choice but to compensate them. But with Pas negotiating for higher, Brioche gives in. This is a small price to pay so as not to lose the king’s trust. Brioche admits defeat but also asks Pas since he seemed unsatisfied with the tea and snacks served. He claims it was too sweet and should’ve balanced the flavours and sweetness, etc. Casserole shuts up his son since they should be taking their leave now. Don’t get too high on their horses. Pas leaves Brioche with a parting gift. Using his magic, he replicates a picture of her on a handkerchief. Lovely.\n\nEpisode 5\n\nCasserole and Pas attend a coming of age ceremony hosted by Elisebio Hazbunois Mille Kadlecek who then introduces his grandson, Squale. Quite a panicky fellow. Pas is cooler than him. Pas then uses his magic to make a picture of Petra Mille Hubarek on a handkerchief as a gift. Daughter of Donachel Mille Hubarek, because he is always feuding with his neighbour, his daughters have a hard time leaving the land and so they were tasked to introduce her on his behalf. Instantly Squale takes the bait as he has fallen for Petra’s beauty and would love to attend her coming of age ceremony soon, much to Elisebio’s dismay. Don’t worry, Casserole can arrange for everything to proceed smoothly. Pas assures Elisebio that Donachel may have ulterior motives. Growing tired of the feuds, he might want to end the fight by diminishing his opponent’s will to fight and thus he might be seeking a match for that purpose. Squale then personally wants to talk to Pas. Sorry, it’s not about making sweets but rather if he can make this picture of Petra a little sexier. Gosh… Soon the good news arrive as Squale and Petra are engaged but will be announced privately when she comes of age. This means Casserole will be getting quite a handsome amount for this matchmaking. But now the problem is keeping that engagement a secret. Despite the church being neutral, they can still talk if bribed enough. Casserole can teleport her to safety but they still need guards to protect her. Pas then has an idea for a place where she can certainly be safe. Remember the sanctification ceremony? Yes, put her in there until the announcement. So they’re like locking her in? After all, since she is going for the coming of age ceremony, she too will have to take this ritual. This way, they don’t have to spend on hiring mercenaries and can pocket the money. But Pas soon gets another lecture from father as he ordered crates of bonkas and sugar. Don’t spend money unnecessarily! Casserole and Pas go meet Donachel to help escort Petra and her twin sister, Licorice. Knowing bandits are watching them, the plan is to enter the church under pretence of undergoing sanctification. Once inside, they’ll teleport her into the church at the capital. As they arrive, bandits attack as predicted. I guess they must not being paid enough because after a few short skirmishes, they flee. Yeah, some losing to a kid. What an embarrassment! The girls are scared but thanks to Pas’ bravery, it looks like Licorice has taken a liking for him.\n\nEpisode 6\n\nA fallen noble named Armire hires a group of mercenaries led by Strudel. He tasks them with an easy money of kidnapping Petra alive. As they accept this task, they know something is not right. Strudel deduces doing so is to either disgrace the Kadlecek house for letting the bride get kidnapped or perhaps Armire wants to save Petra himself and to look like the hero and marry her. Yeah. It’s creepy. As Petra is taken away to start her duties, Pas is left to accompany Licorice. So as they wait in a room, suddenly a huge hole in the floor pops from beneath. They fall though. Casserole tries to follow down the deep hole but it got him nowhere. Pas and Licorice are kidnapped in the kidnapper’s base. He talks to the sole guard watching them to find out more. Putting on his best act, he manages to find out that a noble is behind this kidnapping. From his dilapidated surroundings, it could be the home of a fallen noble. One whom the Kadlecek or Hubarek house were involved in their fall. And Pas remembers Armire’s name coming up as he is the only name on the list of potential troublemakers they have that fits all the criteria! Just wow. With this info, he uses his magic to teleport his ribbon filled with these info back to father. Now they know what to do. Strudel comes back very mad as he is going to kill Licorice. Pas teleports to protect her but gets beaten up. Strudel is made because Armire won’t pay as they got the wrong girl. Now he won’t leave any witnesses. Before he could kill her, Pas takes up his sword to fight him. How did he recover so fast?\n\nEpisode 7\n\nCasserole is here with an army of noble retainers. Father and son corner Strudel. Knowing he cannot win, he uses his magic to make a hole for his escape. With the mercenaries arrested, so is Armire who tried to escape and failed. Story has it Armire house sold info to the enemy. They were investigated and found guilty and stripped of their title. Pas and Casserole return to hunt Strudel. Pas notes something strange about Strudel because he didn’t sense great magic from him. Plus, how did he escape if their forces surrounded the area? Then they realize he is still hiding in the hole! His trick is to wait for everything to settle down before really escaping. Pas has a one on one duel with him. Strudel is careful not to underestimate him but his sword breaks and gets defeated. Yes, Pas replicating the cracks on the wall to his sword! OMFG convenient! With Squale and Petra having a very happy engagement party, Pas talks to Elisebio about the recent kidnapping. Because it seemed all too perfect except for the fact they got the wrong target. Could it be that the wrong info was fed to them? That means there is a third party at work who might benefit greatly gain from all this. Elisebio thinks he suspects him but Pas soon rubbishes this fantasy theory. Pas then suggests he offer some monetary aid for their land. And if he refuses, who knows his tongue might slip. Oh well, I guess that settles it as Elisebio indirectly admits he was the one behind this whole thing so as to destroy the enemy in one fell swoop although it was not his intention to bring harm to his grandson’s fiancée or her sister. Donachel then comes running to Pas to thank him for saving Licorice. Asking if he has anyone he likes or has settled with anyone, Pas claims none. But it is all a trap and bait because now Donachel wants him to be engaged to Licorice! Because if he says no, is he saying his daughter is not perfect and has flaws?! My, of all the negotiations, Pas for the first time can’t worm his way out of this one! With Casserole forced to give his blessings, everybody makes it public their engagement! Yeah, from bonka pies to now a wedding cake! Double happiness! We can call Squale and Petra your brother and sister now, eh?! Pas’ day is salvaged as Licorice bakes him some delicious cookies.\n\nEpisode 8\n\nUhm, could Casserole have worded it better to Agnes? Because he apologizes he has a new woman in his life! She tries to be reasonable and patient but the more he explains, the more he sounds ambiguous. Obviously she blows her top at him for cheating until of course it is revealed that Pas is engaged to Licorice. Now she is happy to have another girl in the family. News of this engagement reaches Brioche. The union has caused with the Kadlecek house has increased Hubarek’s influence. So by having a union with the Morteln house, this could mean they see potential in this house. After all, they were given a wasteland to govern but over the years, it has grown into bountiful crop fields. She won’t be surprised if Pas is the brains behind this and Casserole may have noticed his potential, putting her in a disadvantage now. As part of the engagement agreement, the Kadlecek house has sent tree saplings to Pas. He hopes to grow it into nectars which will make many sweet stuffs. That is why he has set his sights on this undeveloped land for this purpose. Sheet tells Casserole the great news that the influx of new villagers (those who survived the bandits’ attack), their village will grow further. However the bad news is that Pas and his friends have headed to that land. Time to bring back that naughty boy. Pas uses his magic he copied from Strudel to make holes in mountains! He is so happy with this power. He creates a huge hole that will serve as a reservoir and plant trees around it. His daydreaming ecstasy is brought to an abrupt halt as daddy is here. Oh dear. Time for another lecture. As Brioche continues to be concerned of Pas, she rues she has no heir and would’ve made the same decision as Casserole. Even more so, the Kadlecek and Hubarek house have ganged up to go over to his side. When her retainer, Coaton Engels suggests marrying him, she didn’t like this bad joke at first but then has an idea to make him under her wing. Soon a letter inviting Pas to Brioche’s tea party to ask his opinion on her teas. But this only makes Pas suspicious she asked specifically for him. She must be up to something. But that have to wait as Licorice visits. Actually, she intends to stay with him for a while.\n\nEpisode 9\n\nDonachel’s reason to send Licorice to stay with Pas is to have Brioche get off his back. He knows Brioche knows of Pas’ potential and will try to control him. Even more so with the timing of this tea party. So by having Licorice accompany Pas, she won’t be able to manoeuvre easily over him. Pas shows Licorice his kitchen as he bakes a few sweets for her, namely the hard candy. Agnes, Josephine, Lumi and Marc are spying on them. The girls are not impressed Pas isn’t taking any aggressive initiative. Pas of course calls them out and knows they’re spying. Well, gotta go! Pas and Licorice attend the tea party. They are greeted by Coaton who is also tasked to keep an eye on them. Coaton introduces them to the crowd and this is a chance for Pas to show his village’s specialty. He has everyone try his hard candy. He is willing to give more for free as long as they don’t impose sugar tax. With everyone agreeing, Brioche makes her appearance and would love to hear more about this idea. She will talk to Pas privately and this makes Licorice nervous since she will be waiting alone outside. In her room, Brioche wants to know his goal but he lets her taste his hard candy. Good of course. Pas explains the ingredients they are made from and hopes to produce them all in his land. Then he expects to mass produce them in 3 years. This shocks Brioche because the land is barren. But knowing it is Pas, he can perhaps pull it off. She is interested to see his endgame and will aid him in any way she can. After all, she wants to profit and control this future of his. Licorice gets depressed as she feels she doesn’t fit in and wants to go home. As Brioche and Pas leave and return to the party, Brioche flatters Pas’ fiancée. Since he is pretty shy to talk about it, she hugs him and won’t let him go until he admits his true feelings. Just then, Licorice walks in and sees this. Oh my…\n\nEpisode 10\n\nAs expected, Licorice runs away. Pas gives chase and after he catches up with her, he tries to explain himself. Licorice is sad because she heard many women in the hall talking about Pas. She started imagining awful things and at this rate, she fears he will not love her if someone else expresses her love for him. She goes on to compare herself to Petra who is more outgoing and social. Pas assures he likes her the way she is now. He hopes she will put her full trust in him. So he has her wait as he teleports home and soon brings back a candy apple for her to try. You mean it’s not candy bonka?! Anyway, he made this specially for her and says there are many names to this that includes apple of love. So it’s still not a bonka, huh? He wants to make her happy and smile (because it’s only right for his sweets kingdom) and as the mood is right for them to kiss, their retainers make themselves known. Oops, almost. When they return home, Agnes can’t help smother Pas and wants to know the whole story. This could be much fearsome than Brioche. Speaking of which, Pas gets the last laugh as he wraps the hard candy using a picture of Brioche hugging him. He distributes the candy all over and now everybody thinks Brioche is a shotacon! Lots of proposals from young boys streaming in! You bet Brioche is mad like hell! She’ll get that sneaky kid yet! Donachel receives word that his feuding neighbour, the house of Lutoroute is going for war. He is forced to seek reinforcements. Pas talks to Sheet about the use of goat milk and the importance of chickens not for meat but eggs. A whole lot of wonderful pastries can be made from eggs, right? Pas is also experimenting in making his own sugar so his land can produce it themselves. Pas and his friends then try to make a juicer to extract juice from fruits. Uhm, why the heck did he make them so high that Lumi sitting on Marc’s shoulders can’t even reach it? In fact, they even broke the lever! Back to the drawing board. It is then Licorice suggests a juicer in her place. One where it makes wine whereby you just turn the lever around. Pas will go talk to Sheet about this but soon he gets the bad news from Casserole that war has begun.\n\nEpisode 11\n\nLutoroute and his men are planning their war. But when he hears Squale is currently staying at Donachel’s manor, he hatches a devilish plan. Meanwhile Pas and Licorice are sad that men have to go to wars for unknown reasons. I guess in such times, kids like them can only do what they do best: Bake sweets! As Pas promises to bake her cheesecake, he is expecting the arrival of some goats. But to his horror, it seems Baron Lunzvage has swiped them. Actually, he coerced the men into selling the goats to him. So, Pas is going to turn into a bad guy and not forgive him who gets in his way of his dream?! Luckily the adults calm him down to talk some sense into him. As the land is at war, food is very much needed. Even more so, Lunzvage did not steal them. The only one ‘harmed’ is Pas himself. If he insists on pursuing this, Lunzvage may use this excuse to start a war to dismiss him. So now you know why men go to war!!! For now, they have to go help Donachel as he has requested for reinforcements. Pas agrees. Because this is to get back his goats! I guess he isn’t really letting that one go. When Donachel receives word that Lutoroute’s forces are way smaller than as reported, he decides to send Squale to the front lines for his first battle to earn some credit. Little does he know that this is all part of Lutoroute’s plan to break up the Kadlecek and Hubarek house. If Squale wins, obviously Kadlecek will be grateful towards Hubarek. Now imagine if their son dies. See where this is going? When that happens and no support left, Lutoroute will launch all his attack on Hubarek house. Casserole and Pas arrive as they see Donachel who updates them about the situation and the enemy positions. But they feel something strange about it. Why would an enemy who is invading beef up their defence solidly? They put themselves in the enemy’s shoes and suggest points they would attack. This is where Donachel realizes his mistake. Because this place is where Squale is headed and is right for the enemy’s ambush. Immediately Casserole and Pas rush there. Squale and his men realize too late about the trap when the enemies surround them. No way out. Their soldiers are being taken out. Before the inevitable happens, here comes Casserole and Glacage to cut down the enemies. OMFG! Only the 2 of them and they can defeat the enemy???!!! This is not even magic! It is dumb plot convenience! Squale is happy to see Pas who is tasked to aid him.\n\nEpisode 12\n\nWith Squale saved and returned to base, Lutoroute is not happy with this. Because of his plans foiled, he retreats and the war is called off. Despite everybody praising Squale for his bravery and all, Squale himself doesn’t feel good. A lot of his men have died so it’s natural he is depressed. They don’t blame him but oh well, it’s hard to shake off that feeling. Since Petra can’t help him, Pas is tasked to do something about it. Oh right. Bake some sweets. During the party to celebrate their victory, Squale continues to put a forlorn figure. Until of course Pas comes to give him tarte tatin. He explains the story how a pair of sisters made this dish out of failures. Ah yes, that’s that taboo word. However if not for that failure, this dish would not have been made. So the lesson is for Squale to build upon this failure to become better. Petra is proud of him because he was worried about his men than celebrating and because he kept his promise to come back alive, she couldn’t be happier. With that, Squale’s blues are blown away as he promises to become stronger. Back home, not sure what kind of devilish negotiations Casserole and Pas came up but they’re going to get back double from what Lunzvage took from them. So not only they got lots of goats but a few fine horses as well. Everyone returns to their normal peaceful life as Pas as promised, makes a cheesecake from goat’s milk for Licorice.\n\nBittersweet Pie In The Sky: The Cake Is A Lie!\n\nSorry, not exactly cherry/icing on the cake. But yeah. All is fine and everybody is happy living out their lives as long as no stupid wars take place! Just remember, whenever you are stressed always have desserts because that is what it is when spelt backwards. Sorry for the cheesy line but I guess it fits a cheesy show like this! Heh! Next time to prevent any wars, may I suggest Pas just bakes those delicious treats and send them over to the enemy?\n\nHonestly, I am not sure if I should be feeling disappointed with the storyline of the series. Oh heck, maybe I should. Because as usual, I formed by own expectations of what this story is going to be. Yes, this is going to be somewhat a wholesome and BORING anime about a reincarnated guy happily making sweets and pastries every single day. Oh yeah. Even if it was going to be like that, I figure I could stomach it since I have sweet tooth and I would certainly very much welcome the types of tasty treats that he will bring us even if they are all just pictures and 2D visuals. Yum! Nothing but making sweets and candies from start to finish. Perhaps telling us a few basic and secret recipes in making some common or rare or unique confectionaries in between. Oh wow. May be boring stuff and a person like me who can’t cook, at least visually I could feast my eyes on it and salivate at all the good looking food. YUM! I can’t wait to see what this kid bakes!\n\nAnd then… Guess what… Instead of all that boring sweet wholesomeness, what we get from this series, a big majority of it is just medieval style politics and wars! OMFG! Are you f*cking kidding me???!!! Did the series just deceive and lie to us?! Sure, we have some pastries featured but that is by far and few in between. So after a dozen episodes, we only have a handful that are featured. Apple pie (oh sorry, bonka pie), hard candy, debatably the candy apple (sure it’s not candy bonka?) and tarte tatin. Count ‘em! Oh, can I count that cheesecake as cameo too? This is what we get from a series that is supposed to put its focus on the sweets theme?! Even Princess Connect! Re:Dive has more food features than this one! And that is not even supposed to be a food themed series. Just saying. Sad to say, the sweet treats here feel very secondary and not even a prominent feature. Because if I were to remember and think back on this anime, sweets are not the first thing that will pop up in my mind!\n\nSorry if I feel a bit sore and disappointed but yeah, looks like at this rate Pas will not be able to create his dream sweets kingdom. He is still at the starting point if I should say. Hence if I am really going to nit-pick on the title, I guess in this very context, it was really a strange anime. Yeah. Hontou ni okashi desu yo! Thus we didn’t get the sweets but rather the strangeness. Is this supposed to be the shock factor to us viewers? The double meaning in the words?! Can’t say I like it very much. Without my sugary sweets, now I’m just pissed off! GGGGRRRRRRRRR!!! GIVE ME MAH F*CKING SWEETS!!!!\n\nEven in this isekai context, the whole story seems to be average and paltry. We just see Pas somewhat enjoying his isekai life and using his genius (I would rather call it his retained memories from his former life) in creating some so called pastry miracles. But that is so much about it. Because instead of spending most of his time in the kitchen or in the field, what we mostly see Pas doing is to attend noble events and even fight off bandits to protect his own village! Worse, he even went to war as the season reaches its end! Sure, sure. If he wants to make a peaceful sweets kingdom where everybody can smile and enjoy all the sweet sugary stuffs, he has to put in the sweat to fight all that comes his way, blah, blah, blah. Oh come on. Give him a break. He is just a kid. Even more so an isekai one! Couldn’t he use his magic to just end all the war or at least create the best tasting sweet for the enemies?! I’m sure nobody wants to fight and just sit down and enjoy his pastries once they’ve tasted it! WHY HAS HE NOT THINK ABOUT THAT???!!! Don’t bother thinking why men go to war. What’s the solution to it?! Oh right. That candy slab that killed him may have killed a lot of brain cells when he reincarnated over.\n\nThe characters are pretty bland and boring. Like Pas who perhaps check off the list on what a reincarnated isekai main character should be. Trying to say it all here would make me sound like a broken character. Oh heck, who am I kidding? I’m just too lazy to say it since Pas didn’t really impress me. Even more so his magic that can replicate things, it just screams freaking plot convenience AKA BS. Imagine, replicating cracks on a wall onto a sword. CRACKS ON A WALL! My goodness. If this was a different genre, the government might want to kidnap him to force him to do experiments on human cloning! Heh. So yeah, nice and good hearted kid trying to create his own sweets kingdom. Cool. Fine. But the way I see it, he is being dragged into adult stuffs and his dream is really looking more like a dream than reality. To spice things up, he gets engaged but I guess that is double the happiness because now he can share his lovely treats with someone he loves than the usual family. It is also necessary to help improve Licorice’s character from a coward to one who at least opens up and have more confidence in herself a little in the end. Thank goodness she got engaged to the right man boy. How sweet.\n\nOther characters just really unmemorable. Like Casserole is a good leader and father and I suppose most of his role or I should say, his running joke is to scold and lecture Pas when he goes out of line. Sure, he did say to keep his magic a secret. This is why Pas doesn’t openly use it which may have saved the world and stop all stupid wars. But I guess that’s not the case. Then there is Sheet who is Casserole’s good right hand man but the only thing I want to nit-pick is why the official subtitles call him as Feuille. If that is his nickname, I can understand but they clearly call him Sheets. Trying to confuse the hell out of us? Trying to distract us from the strangeness of the series? Maybe many of the characters here have names that sound close or related to food and it would be freaking strange for him as a major supporting character not to have one. I don’t know, that’s just some dumb conspiracy theory of mine but yeah, whatever.\n\nThen there is Agnes and Josephine who are so underused, like as though they shouldn’t even exist in the first place. All I remember is that they play cheeky pranks on Pas an small occasions like dressing him up as a girl but other than that, nothing much. Pas is like the apple of their eye? Oh sorry, bonka of their eye? Then there is Marc and Lumi as Pas’ best friends but I guess it’s best to hook them up to give them more character and significance. And then we forget all about it. Don’t worry, these 2 will always be together, right? Finally there is Brioche who is slightly more interesting but I can’t fathom why she wants to be a bully so badly. Is she bored in life? She thinks she’s smart but plot convenience says otherwise. Now eat humble pie! And the rest of the baddies are just a paltry. They act tough but get easily defeated. Once that happens, you never heard from them again. Like that bandit boss in the early episodes. What happened to him? Yeah, maybe he fell into a ditch and died.\n\nArt and animation are just moderate. Because the characters here lean towards the cute side, on the first looks, this may look like some sort of show for children. After all, when you have Pas as a kid and the main character, it is not hard to think otherwise. Series with a young child as the lead character such as Tensei Kizoku No Isekai, Isekai Yakkyoku and Hachi-nan Tte Sore Wa Nai Deshou seem to have this sort of style of visuals. Yeah, don’t such kids look somewhat the same? Hence this one is no different. Even the overall backgrounds, colouring and hues are mostly bright and livid so yeah, one may mistake this to be a show for younger audiences. This show is done by SynergySP who did Zettai Karen Children, Kirarin Revolution, Mermaid Melody and the Metal Fight Beyblade spinoffs. Mostly shows that are targeted for young kids so you can see why their visuals are mostly so.\n\nVoice acting also feels average. Recognized a few veterans lending their talents here such as Youko Hikasa as Brioche, Takehito Koyasu as Donachel and Kouji Yusa as Lutoroute. The rest are Ayumu Murase as Pas (Luck in Black Clover), Hiroshi Tsuchida as Casserole (Grisha in Shingeki No Kyojin), Yuu Wakabayashi as Sheets, Kaede Hondo as Licorice (Echidna in Yuusha Yamemasu), Kaya Okuno as Petra (Kaya in Wake Up Girls), Natsumi Fujiwara as Marc (Damian in Spy x Family), Maaya Uchida as Lumi (Lily in DanMachi) and Wataru Katou as Squale (Touka in Yuusha Ga Shinda). The opening theme, Brand New Day by Sana is a dramatic rock piece and I thought it would fit better for a battle shonen anime genre. The ending theme, Fuumi Zekka by Yuni feels like some sort of slow hip hop added in some sound effects. Can’t say I like it very much.\n\nOverall, I find this series to be disappointing as well as underwhelming. Should have been some sort of isekai cliché spamming all the sweets wholesome goodness but instead we get distracted by politics and war of the backwater noble kind. That didn’t really sweeten the deal! I don’t know if I should be feeling happy about that since it was not what I expected as it was slightly a bit off. Oh heck, who am I kidding? I’m not! I want to label this one worse than the Chuuka Ichiban remake but changed my mind because the food theme here is about pastries, candies and confectionaries, those sweet sugary stuffs that I love but never got to experience. Can’t stay mad all the time. Can’t have my cake and eat it. That’s the way the cookie crumbles for viewers alike. And to think they really renamed the apple here as bonka. Couldn’t have picked a better name, huh? Bonkers! I wonder what kind of name they’ll have for other fruits. Whatever they are, I bet it’ll sound bananas and nutty as a fruitcake!"
