Throughout its run, the show has released three studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, nine video singles, eleven singles, five soundtrack albums, and twelve music videos.\n\nKoharu Kusumi from the Japanese idol girl group Morning Musume made her solo singing and acting debut as the main character, Kirari Tsukishima; portraying the character both in the anime and in a real-world context made her one of the pioneers of the \"idol voice actor\" crossover beginning in the late 2000s.[2] Along with providing Kirari Tsukishima's voice for the series, Kusumi released music as Kirari under the name Kirari Tsukishima starring Koharu Kusumi (Morning Musume) (月島きらり starring 久住小春(モーニング娘。)), including providing the opening and ending themes to Kirarin Revolution.[3]\n\nFrom June to September 2007,[4] Mai Hagiwara from Cute was cast as the anime-original character, Hikaru Mizuki, and became part of the in-show idol subunit Kira Pika with Kusumi; Hagiwara would also make live television appearances portraying the character[5] and appeared as a special guest during Kirarin Revolution's final concert event on May 4, 2009.[6]\n\nThe second season, Kirarin Revolution Stage 3, cast Sayaka Kitahara and You Kikkawa from Hello Pro Egg as the anime-original characters Noel Yukino and Kobeni Hanasaki, who form the in-show Japanese idol group MilkyWay with Kirari.[7] Takuya Ide and Shikou Kanai were cast as the new voice actors for Hiroto Kazama and Seiji Hiwatari, the members of the in-show group Ships.[8] Like Kusumi, MilkyWay and Ships released music and made appearances at concerts and other television shows, such as Haromoni and Oha Suta, as their characters.[7][8]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Album details Peak chart positions Sales
