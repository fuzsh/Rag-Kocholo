As a member of Project LUMINOUS, I'll catch everyone's hearts! Cheer me on, please♪ Kyaha☆\"\n\nCharacter Description\n\nAccording to her first Starlight Stage Memorial commu, Producer first meets Nana in an Akihabara underground concert venue where he notices her performing to a small audience in a maid outfit.[1] After performing her latest song, she starts to market her CDs which are entirely homemade. Disheartened that the applause is getting weaker and weaker, she mutters to herself about the possibility that she'll never leave the underground idol circuit. Working part-time at a maid café, Nana finds it hard to balance work and her dream to become a singing & dancing seiyuu idol. As her past clientele at the maid café aren't coming back and her old co-workers are getting married, she feels she's reached a dead end with her fizzling dream. During her distress, Producer approaches her to carefully strike up a conversation. Nana, thinking Producer is a fan, invites him to come and take a picture with her. Unexpectedly, he pulls out his business card and introduces himself as an idol producer of a large agency. Flustered, Nana mistakenly asks him for an autograph then starts to appeal to him using her usual idol tactics. Introducing her as an forever 17-year old, she tells him that she came all the way from Planet Usamin in a \"carrot carriage\" to achieve her dream of becoming a seiyuu idol. Nana notices the audience members are getting tired of her sthick, but she amusingly rebuffs that her backstory isn't something that should be boring. Producer finds her comment funny, recruiting her on the spot. Nana is shocked at the news, but overwhelmingly happy that her big break is finally coming. She says she'll do anything in terms of work, starting by first being cast as \"High School Girl A\" in an anime. Leaving the underground venue to a new type of stage, Nana starts her idol journey.\n\nNana can be described as an eccentric ex-part-time maid of dubious age, claiming to be a \"forever 17-year-old alien\" from Planet Usamin. As with all good idols, her gimmick is strong and memorable. According to Nana, her backstory is that she crash landed on Earth from Planet Usamin to become the best \"singing and dancing seiyuu idol\" in the universe. Her nickname is also \"Usamin\" like her home planet. She will often communicate with Planet Usamin with her rabbit ears; they are actually antennae that send radio waves between Earth and Planet Usamin. This telepathic communication is often expressed by Nana using sounds like \"Piipii☆\" and \"Minmin!\" One of her other catchphrases is \"Kyaha~☆\", which she says after something cute happens. Drawing her power from her home, Nana's character is also a magical girl who fights evil that threatens her home planet. Using the phrase \"Märchen Change!\", she gains magical powers in order to protect both Earth and Planet Usamin akin to popular children's anime like PreCure and Sailor Moon. Since the beginning of her career, Nana has shown to be very enthusiastic about world-building and telling stories about her character, evident through the content of her self-made songs and CDs. When Producer first scouted her in an underground venue, she was seen performing the song \"Usamin Legend: The Final Chapter (Episode 4, Part 8).\" In later cards like [Cinderella Girl], it's seen that Usamin was thought of when Nana was still a child. Many classmates made fun of her, saying that Planet Usamin didn't exist. However, she still vowed to become a princess of Planet Usamin someday. Nana has accrued many children as fans as a result of her gimmick, often promising to bring them to Planet Usamin herself.\n\nThough most people know that Nana's character is just for show, some people (most children) are oblivious, even enthused, by the fact that she's an forever-17-year-old alien. Children, both fans and fellow idols, are so enthusiastic about Usamin that they often ask what it looks like or if they can visit. Additionally, many idols of the production discuss topics that unintentionally lead to discussion about Nana's age. Nana gets very flustered and defensive when her claims to forever 17-year-old-hood are challenged. Notably scatterbrained and weak at improvising, she often nervously tangles herself in a web of lies to preserve the image of her idol persona. Unfortunately for her, this complicates things rather than clearing up her image. Fans affectionally call this the \"Usamin-Style Multi-Stage Grave Digging Technique.\" Nana often blurts out the first thing that's on her mind when she's in a state of panic, sometimes even entering a conversation she wasn't part of in the first place. Many of her lines and comic appearances feature her clearly panicking and making things up as she goes along. Due to her not keeping track of the Usamin stories she tells, she often creates noticeable contradictions or invents impossibly fanciful scenarios that even defy the imagination of children. Some examples are Nana saying that Planet Usamin is \"one hour by train\" and telling bunny-loving Chie that there are more rabbits on Usamin compared to Earth. Adding insult to injury, the other Cinderella Girls idols constantly shoot holes in her alien fantasy, making Nana say more contradicting statements that only further embarrass her. Other than blushing, other physical phenomena that show Nana's dishonesty include excessive flailing of limbs, shaky legs, and her eyes swirling.\n\nNot actually being forever-17, there are many signs that point to Nana being over 20 years old. Her height and appearance is similar to that of a normal teenager, so no one initially is suspicious of her age. But like with Usamin, Nana herself tends to inadvertently slip phrases, memories, or comments that indicate she's older than seventeen. In her CINDERELLA MASTER CD, Nana gets a call from her mother in the middle of her CD interview. Nana’s mother reminds her to vote, meaning that in reality, she is at least 20 years old as that is the minimum voting age in Japan. Nana also frequently reveals things she did or said in her teenage years that aren't applicable to current-day high school students. When talking with other teenage idols, they find that Nana's mannerisms are oddly quite outdated. For example, she often uses outdated terms (e.g. \"moe\"), is unaware of newer slang (e.g. getting flamed), talks about old high school habits (e.g. wearing bloomers in gym class), and is paranoid with leaving objects of her past in plain sight (e.g. her high school graduation album). In her card [Uniform Usamin], it's implied that she wears the \"Planet Usamin High School Uniform\" she made herself because she got rid of her real one a long time ago. Additionally, Nana is often grouped with the older idols like Shin, Sanae, and Mizuki in joke contexts concerning age. Whether it's feeling lonely as an older lady during the holidays, discussing joint and muscle pain, or talking about skincare to maintain a youthful glow, Nana always has a noticeably worried expression or dialogue in these scenes.\n\nUnderneath her silly and scatterbrained character, Nana is a hardworking and resilient idol who has experienced many obstacles on the road to realize her dream of being a \"singing and dancing seiyuu idol.\" As stated before, Nana has dreamed of being a \"princess of Planet Usamin\" since she was a child. Her parents have always supported her dream since she was a young girl, motivating her to take risks to achieve her goals. After graduating from high school, Nana worked as a part-time maid in a maid café to raise money for outfits, merchandise, and CD production as an indie idol. It's implied that she puts most of her paycheck towards her idol career, living in a small, cheap apartment and mostly eating convenience store food. Wanting to reach her dream through her own power, she never asked for handouts from her parents (only sending her peanuts from back home). Nana's schedule was busy but became gradually routine, spending days working at the maid café and her nights performing in Akihabara underground venues. Though Nana hoped this work would help her find her big break, it never appeared. She grinded exhausting days and volatile nights, only to yield miniscule results. Fans came and went, employees at her café joined and left, fellow underground idols grew to stardom or gave up on their dreams, but Nana remained stagnant. While her surroundings changed, Nana herself stayed the same. She often felt disheartened and frustrated that she would never escape the underground idol circuit, getting older and older whilst the idols around her were getting younger and younger. However, Nana never gave up. No matter how rough the seas were, she would keep on sailing. Along with her parents, her indie-era fans and fellow maid café workers encouraged Nana to persevere. Wanting to protect the smiles she cherished, Nana would always personally greet each fan and took time to form meaningful bonds that would last forever. In her [Twilight Usamin] card, her maid café employees prided her on earnestly aiming to fulfill her childhood fantasy. Rather than Usamin being a \"character\" or a \"fad,\" her co-workers regarded it as a \"dream.\" Though things like maid cafés wax and wane in popularity, a \"dream\" is something that will never burn out unless you snuff the flame yourself. In her struggles and newfound relationships, Nana learned that staying the same is not always a bad thing. She never changed her image to fit more popular idol trends and braved the idol landscape being her most authentic self. Though Usamin's popularity as a character gradually decreased in the underground scene, Usamin as her dream gave her the willingness to endure the pain of failure and to embrace the possibility of triumph.\n\nEntering the Producer's agency, Nana saw this as her first step towards becoming a \"singing and dancing seiyuu idol.\" Not wanting to squander her big chance, she became very enthusiastic and took all auditions and jobs she could manage. Whether going on scary rollercoasters or practicing until her body gives out, Nana does all of her idol activities with gusto and passion. Though she loves all kinds of work, voice acting is her greatest passion. Before becoming an idol, she practiced dubbing over lines when she watches anime everyday. Due to her love of anime and magical girls, her dream job is to voice a main character in one of those shows. Nana cites these magical girl anime theme songs for being one of the reasons why she enjoys singing on stage. As a child, she would perform these theme songs at summer festivals every year. She took many small voice acting roles, such as \"Citizen\" or \"High School Student A,\" at the start of her seiyuu career. In her card [Dreamin'☆Usamin], she finally made her big break in the anime industry performing the theme song to in-universe magical girl anime \"Kyunderella V.\" Since then, many of Nana's jobs have revolved around magical girls such as the Decoboco Speedster and Otaku is LOVE! events.\n\nAfter debuting as an idol and working hard, Nana gained major popularity for her eccentric and funny character (both in the in-game universe and real life), including getting voted as the 7th Cinderella Girl. Though she has gained her deserved fame, Nana wholeheartedly embraces her past as an indie idol. She is grateful for the bumpy road she traveled and looks back on those memories with fondness. In her 4th memorial commu in Starlight Stage, she tells Producer she wants to visit her old underground venue before she made her major debut. Likewise, she visits her old maid café that has closed down in her card [Twilight Usamin]. Both of these places are sentimental to Nana, being instrumental in shaping her into the person she is today. It's a habit for her to cry thinking about her past and how far she's come. Additionally, she was apologetic for not being able to personally greet her fans like she used to when she was still in the underground scene. Even though Nana can't get as personal to her fans like before, she tries to connect with the fans on the most intimate level preferring to do activities like personal signings and meet-and-greets. Along with her hard work, she is very thankful towards Producer for giving her the opportunity to shine. From scouting her to lessons to the work she's done, Nana thinks of Producer as \"raising her\" in terms of her idol growth and giving her the \"magic\" she needs to transform into the idol she dreamed of becoming. Every time she looks back on what Producer has done for her, Nana almost always breaks down into tears.\n\nAt the agency, she cares for all of her fellow idols and acts like a mentor to them. Many idols think of Nana as their \"big sister\" figure, helping them memorize lines, covering for them, and making sure they are taken care of. It's a common joke for Nana to give off \"maternal energy\" as she is good at taking care and entertaining the younger idols and is good at giving advice to others due to her experience as an indie idol. She is close to adult idols like Shin, Mizuki, and Sanae often eating hot pot together or discussing their status as lady idols (despite Nana being forever-17). Concerning Shin, her and Nana have a popular duo unit called \"Sugarmin.\" Shin is known to called Nana \"Paisen\"/\"Nana-senpai\" even though she is older than her (26 vs. forever-17). Due to her love of anime, she is also friends with Nao Kamiya and Hina Araki. They often spend their time at Hina's house, watching and discussing retro anime all night. Nana usually falls asleep first and doesn't last the whole night like the other youthful two. Nana is also associated with Miku, another animal-eared Cute attribute idol with a strong gimmick; Nana plays a huge part in Miku's character and idol development in the second cour of the anime.\n\nDeremail Questions Originally posted on 06/25/2020. Translation source. Nana: Be-beep. I just received some \"DereMail\". So, today, good ol' Nana here will answer them. Straight from Planet Usamin, Marc Marc Min Min! Question: Tofu recipe? Nana: Nana recommends \"Momen Tofu Karaage\"! #DereMail Nana: It's healthy and nutrious. And more than anything else, it's quite filling! It really helped me a lot! Question: I hope to know your preferred time when boiling pasta Nana: The pasta I had at home was done in 7 minutes! Nana: But, since it's scary to overcook it, we end up turning it off early, right? Question: Usamin, hello! I'm sorry if this turned out to be some life counselling, but I'm torn about giving up on pursuing my dream I had ever since I was young and finally settle down. I don't want to make my parents worry anymore so I'm starting to think that this is it for me. I would like to hear some advice from you, Usamin. Thank you for your time. Nana: I think chasing after one's dreams and learning when to let go are both equally important. Nana: Chasing after a dream makes one encounter all sorts of worries and difficulties, so I cannot just haphazardly endorse support for one going after this path; but even so- Nana: I think that as one continues living, their dreams continue to change shape as well. Nana: I believe that goes the same for looking for a life partner. Prioritizing one now doesn't mean that you'll abandon the other. Nana: Look for that someone who'll support your dream and grab that dream with all you've got together! Isn't that wonderful! Nana: Oh, looks like my Carrot Ride has come so that would be it for today. I'll be waiting for more of your mail!\n\nGame Appearances\n\nTo view Nana's Cinderella Girls and Starlight Stage card quotes and data, click here.\n\nTHE iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls\n\nNana first appeared on February 22nd, 2012 as a new idol that was part of the \"1 Million Players Celebration Slot LIVE Campaign\" Event in the game.\n\nNana appears in the Events listed below:\n\nEvents Event Duration Cards\n\nTHE iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls Starlight Stage\n\nNana appeared on September 3rd, 2015 as one of the initial idols in the game.\n\nNana appears in the Events listed below:\n\nEvents Event Featured Song Type Duration Cards Atashi Ponkotsu Android Token 9/25/2015 - 10/5/2015 Gokigen Party Night LIVE Groove 12/31/2015 - 1/8/2016 Not a featured card.

It is also the 7th stop on the Tokyo-Chiba train line, coinciding with her name Nana.\n\nShe always ranked in the Top 15 of Cinderella Girl polls until the 7th poll in 2018, where she finally became the Cinderella Girl.\n\nThe name of her unit with Shin, SugarSugar☆Mi~n, seems to be a reference to the fan name for the couple (Sugarmin, a combination of Shin's self-given nickname \"Sugar Heart\" and Nana's supposed home planet \"Usamin\").\n\nIn the MobaMas collab with Super Robot Wars, she helms the Shirogane along with Aiko Takamori. She wears a costume inspired by Azuki Sawa.\n\nFan Culture\n\nFans speculate her actual age to be 27, due to her story episode in Starlight Stage appearing as the 27th episode, \"Marchen Debut\" having 27 stars on Master difficulty, and the song containing exactly 27 separate notes on Debut difficulty. She has also recently stated that Planet Usamin (her apartment) is 27km away from Tokyo.\n\nDue to a rather nonsensical video that became an instant meme on nico nico douga, Nana and Shin are often associated with the 1989 song \"Be My Baby\" by Complex.\n\nNana has a lot of popular tags that concern the discrepancy between her apparent and actual age, two of which are Usakitsu and Usamin Jidai.\n\nUsakitsu (Usamin + Kitsune) is used in fanart that displays Nana doing cutesy things that a 17-year-old would do while showing signs of overexertion. The tag references kitsune and their ability to live for long periods of time and shapeshift into young-looking humans.\n\nUsamin Jidai (Usamin Age) is a video tag where AMVs and Deresute/Starlit Season videos are overlayed with 80's retro effects simulating old VHS tapes. Fanart in this tag usually has Nana dress up as personalities or show characters from the Showa era to reflect her actual age.\n\nThere is a popular tag called あべななさんじゅうななさい (Abenanasanjyuunanasai) used by fans that changes meaning depending on where you put punctuation. It can be read as あべななさん、じゅうななさい (Abe Nana-san, jyuunana-sai) meaning \"Nana Abe-san is 17-years-old\" or あべなな､さんじゅうななさい (Abe Nana, sanjyuunana-sai) meaning \"Nana Abe is 37-years-old.\"\n\nThis tag is used when Nana does or says something that points to her actual age and doesn't match the behavior of an actual high schooler.\n\nDue to her supposed association with Kikuko Inoue, she has become somewhat associated with Nanami Asari, who is voiced by Kikuko's daughter.\n\nShe eventually sings a song, Zenkai! Miracle Adventure! with Nanami and also Miku Maekawa, who has been associated with both for different reasons.\n\nCharacter Gallery\n\nAnimated LINE Stickers\n\n\"Welcome back♥\"\n\nAnimated Loading Characters\n\n[Happy New Usamin]\n\n[Space☆Usamin]\n\n[Christmas Usamin]\n\n[Summer☆Usamin]\n\n[Wonderland Rabbit]\n\n[Warm Usamin]\n\n[Bride☆Usamin]\n\n[Fantastic☆Usamin]\n\n[Cinderella Girl]\n\n[Anniversary Princess]\n\nCinderella Post Images October 30th, 2018\n\nat 6:32 P.M.
