The stuck-up girl will constantly engage the heroine, who usually doesn't pay attention to these efforts, or even the challenger.\n\nExamples of Schoolgirl Rival include:\n\nAnime and Manga[]\n\nPeach Girl: Momo and Sai for a bit.\n\nA Little Snow Fairy Sugar had Greta constantly challenging Saga, who was usually distracted by the fairies' antics.\n\nIn ROD the TV, Anita was also challenged by one of her classmates.\n\nAzumanga Daioh shows Kagura doing this to Sakaki upon the former's transfer into Yukari's class.\n\nIn a manner more in tune with the show's absurd nature, Tomo challenges everyone in whatever their best field is.\n\nNatsume in Hidamari Sketch is Sae's self-proclaimed rival, but she's really doing it because she has a Tsundere crush on Sae.\n\nNaturally occurs in Kujibiki Unbalance with the one-sided rivalry between Tokino and Renko- Renko holds a grudge against Tokino from elementary school, but Tokino is so ditzy she doesn't even realize Renko is antagonizing her.\n\nOccurs in the backstory of Mahou Sensei Negima. When Asuna arrived as Mahora, Ayaka declared that they were rivals. As Asuna was an Emotionless Girl at arrival, it took her several years to notice. This, of course, means that, given her lack of authority figures, Asuna was basically raised by The Rival, to the extent that what emotions she did develop were developed in response to an annoying Ojou bothering her all the time. Explains a lot, really.\n\nKaede and Mana also seem to have this type of relationship; pretty much every time we see them interact they're either fighting or trying to one-up each other.\n\nAlthough this has less to do with them being schoolgirls and more to do with the fact that they're both fantastically accomplished warriors.\n\nWith wildly contrasting styles, no less--one is a Ninja, the other a Gunslinger.\n\nEiko Magami and Biko Daitokuji from Project A-ko.\n\nChitose in Hitohira flips back and forth between being this to Mugi and being supportive.\n\nIn the supplementary manga of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, no sooner did Fate become a New Transfer Student did she gain a schoolgirl rival in Alisa after the latter overachiever of a student learned that the former was way too advanced for the curriculum.\n\nSeto no Hanayome has Lunar transferring into the school for the sole purpose of being Sun's rival. It actually starts a war among the students.\n\nErina Ogura in Kirarin Revolution is Kirari's \"rival\" because she's jealous of Kirari's increasing popularity - even though Kirari thinks them to be good friends.\n\nIn B Gata H Kei Kyouka instigates one with Yamada after Yamada beat her in a beauty pageant.\n\nInverted in Street Fighter Legends Ibuki with the titular heroine being from the school and new transfer student Makoto. Worth noting that Makoto isn't stuck up or rich at all and financially struggles to run a gym alongside Ibuki herself is the girly girl, though not stuck up, and Makoto is the tomboy.\n\nVideo Games[]\n\nSakura Kasugano and Karin Kanzuki in Street Fighter Alpha. The storyline connecting them, and Karin herself, are Canon Immigrants from the Sakura Ganbaru! manga.\n\nEven after Karin and Sakura is out of High School Karin still shows shades of this but it is more because of her battle hungry desire. Whenever Sakura mentions she has another female friend Karin still wants to battle said friend in V with Ibuki first and later much more notably against Akira.\n\nWestern Animation[]"
