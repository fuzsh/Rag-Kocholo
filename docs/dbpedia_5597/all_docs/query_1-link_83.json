Maybe the staff thought too many \"DEATH\"s are inappropriate.\n\nThe Japanese word \"desu\" (です) is a copula (= to be). The Eastern Japanese almost drop \"u\" of this word, so the word \"desu/des\" sounds like \"death\". And someone started writing \"DEATH\" instead of \"です\" (desu). It makes sense only where the Japanese word \"desu\" is expected to come. The title \"BABYMETAL DEATH\" means only \"We are BABYMETAL.\" No relation to the death itself.\n\nI'm not sure of its origin, but I saw long before such a character as a vampire or a death metal singer in a comic and all his \"です\" (desu) were replaced with \"DEATH\" to emphasize his character. With such an air, it works well. Without such an air, it probably doesn't work.\n\n[ii] Is This Death Metal?\n\nThere is a genre named \"Death Metal\". The sound of this tune seems to fall within that genre, and the lyric writer may have put many \"DEATH\"s to emphasize the Death-Metal-ness. It might be alright to use many \"DEATH\"s without thinking of death if some of Death Metal bands also chose their style just to differentiate themselves rather than driven by the feeling about death. But I don't know the Death Metal well.\n\nROMAJI LYRIC AND NOTES ARE BELOW.\n\nReleased on 2013 Jan. 9th, coupled with IJIME, DAME, ZETTAI (included in the regular edition).\n\nLyric: EDOMETAL / Music: NARASAKI / Arr.: NARAMETAL\n\nCatch Me If You Can\n\n[One, two, one, two, three, four.]\n\n[[Hey!

About songs \"IJIME, DAME, ZETTAI\", \"BABYMETAL DEATH\" and \"Catch Me If You Can\".\n\nThis video is a copy of http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xxhkdt with English subtitles. This is a translation of 18 min. part of a TV program \"HOT WAVE\" broadcasted on 2013 February 13th by TV Saitama. Both videos on DailyMotion were deleted in 2019 Aug., so I uploaded this to Google Drive on 2019 Aug. 19th.\n\nPlease note that the letters \"DEATH\" you see in the video mean only \"to be\" (= DESU / DES_), written so only to add heavy-metal-ness, and no serious meaning is contained. About Osaka dialect which this MC speaks and his role, plaese see [Note [i] of Talking on HotWave 2]\n\nClick [CC] or \"Settings\" at the bottom-right if the subtitles are not displayed.\n\nI'm sorry the subtitles are sometimes difficult to read with overlapping the original captions. Watching on full screen may improve the readability somewhat.\n\n[i] The letters \"DEATH\" only means \"to be\" (= DESU/DES_).\n\nIn this video you see the letters \"DEATH\" many times. I'm afraid you may think why these girls smile while talking about the death. No. It's not the case. The Japanese word \"DESU\" is a copula (=to be), and the Eastern Japanese pronounce \"U\" of this very weak (they almost drop it). So the word \"desu\" or \"des\" sounds like \"death\", and someone started writing \"DEATH\" in stead of \"desu\". The title \"BABYMETAL DEATH\" means nothing but \"We are BABYMETAL.\" No relation to death.\n\nI'm not sure of its origin. But I saw long before such a character as a vampire or a death metal singer in a comic and all his \"desu\" were replaced with \"DEATH\" to emphasize his character. With such an air, it will work well. Without it, it won't work.\n\nNotes\n\n\"We beg your kindness.\" is for Japanese \"Yoroshiku onegai-shimasu.\" This is literally (a polite form of) \"We hope you to do (all) things properly (=in our favor)\". It stands in for \"Nice to see you\", \"Thank you in advance\", etc.\n\nSakura Gakuin (=Cherry Blossom School) is a girl group. It has 12 members as of 2013 Aug. It is compared to a school. Its sub groups are called \"club activities\". Their fans are called \"fathers and elder brothers\" (=guardians). And a member graduates from (=leave) the group when she graduates from junior high. SU, born on 1997 Dec. 20, graduated on 2013 Mar., and thereafter BABYMETAL is no longer its club activity while YUI and MOA still belong to Sakura Gakuin. Please see Wikipedia or else for more information.\n\nIn Japan, popular music was once called \"light music\" and the club activity is still called \"keiongaku-bu\" (=light music club) or \"keion\". So \"juuon-bu\" is rather \"heavy music club\" than \"heavy sound club\".\n\nThe students that don't belong to any club are sometimes called (a member of) \"kitaku-bu\" (=the go-home club).\n\n\"Nido-zuke\" (=double dipping) is to put a food into a dipping source, take a bite, and put it back in. It's a bad manner. He suggests that an entertainer should not react twice.\n\n\"Getemono\" (originally \"low quality\") has a negative feeling. It is used for every bizarre thing (food, fashion, etc). There is another word \"chinmi\" (=rare taste food), but it means almost \"delicacy\".\n\nA girl, a top, a bottom, shoes and accessories are painted on a transparent card. These cards are layered on each other to make a coordinated fashion. These are Tomy's products \"Millefeui Cards\".\n\nA stamp-size sticker is called \"seal\" and it is often used to seal the envelope.\n\nIn Japan, the graduation is typically late in March, and the entrance is typically early in April. And Somei-Yoshino, typical cherry trees, bloom in this period in most of Japan.\n\nThey don't speak any words between the tunes, but at last they call \"We are...\", the audience respond \"BABYMETAL!\", and with their \"See you!\", the live ends.\n\nBABYMETAL officials write \"No more bullying\", but I think \"ZETTAI\" (=absolutely) is indispensable. [Here] is my translation of this song and notes.\n\n\"BABYMETAL DEATH\" is a tune of death-metal-like? sound. It has no melody, only saying \"B, A, B, Y, M, E, T, A L. / SU-METAL des_. YUIMETAL des_. MOAMETAL des_. BABYMETAL des_.\" repeatedly. For \"DEATH\" and \"des_\", please see note [i].\n\n\"Catch Me If You Can\" is based on children's play \"kakuren-bo\" (=hide-and-seek). Many words are borrowed from it. [Here] is my translation and notes.\n\n\"Keeki\" is for \"cake\", and \"genki\" is for \"energetic\".\n\nMushi Production is an anime studio started in 1961 by Osamu TEZUKA, the Godfather of Anime.\n\n\"Nanja korya?\" (=nanda korewa) means \"What is this?\". It is male language of some dialects. It may be the superlative of \"nanda korewa\".\n\nIt is famous as Yusaku MATSUDA's word in a TV drama in 1974. A detective was unexpectedly shot by the man he had protected. Seeing his own bloody hand, he said \"What's the fuck?\" and then fell down dead. Yusaku himself plotted this part.\n\nThe transcription (.srt file) is below.\n\nIn Short: About songs \"MEGITSUNE\", \"Onadari Dai Sakusen\" and \"AKATSUKI\". About concerts, the live band, WoD, mosshusshu, headbanging, etc.\n\nSource: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1124zs (this video is other's.) This is a translation of 18 min. part of a TV program \"HOT WAVE\" broadcasted on 2013 June 19th by TV Saitama. A kind person pbh19950 subtitled based on my translation. http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x146rc8\n\nThe notes are below. No Japanese words corresponding to the enclosed words (It's not disguising), (intension) and (terrible) were spoken, but I insert them to complement those sentences.\n\n[i] The Man from Osaka or About Japanese Dialects\n\nThough it is broadcasted in Saitama, near Tokyo, the MC is from Osaka and speaks Osaka dialect.\n\nSU-METAL is from Hiroshima (more west than Osaka). YUIMETAL is from Kanagawa (near Tokyo). They speak Standard Japanese. MOAMETAL is from Nagoya (between Tokyo and Osaka). She also speaks it, but only at 03:02 she speaks Kyoto-Osaka-like dialect (\"ku~tsu_ko~wa~re~\" instead of \"ku_tsu~ga_ko_wa~re~\"; ~:high, _:low). She may have grown under some influence of that region.\n\nStandard Japanese is based on Tokyo dialect. While dialects have been reevaluated since about 1980, the youth's dialects have become milder under the influence of TV (the accents are preserved but the conjugations etc. have become a little like Standard Japanese). Most people (try to) speak Standard Japanese on formal occasions or when in Tokyo. But many people of Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe and Nara (=core of Kansai region) speak their dialect even in Tokyo.\n\nPeople of Kansai are in general good at conversation, and they (e.g. Yoshimoto comedians) are often selected for the host of nationwide TV talk show. They are good at drawing interesting responses from the guest, and treat them well (sometimes they fail). These hosts speak Kansai dialect and it has become familiar to other regions.\n\nStereotyped Osaka people are \"too frank\", and in many comics and amines appears a frank character who speaks Osaka dialect. Recently some people use a phrase of foreign dialect to wear such a stereotyped image. This is called \"dialect cosplay\". Saying \"Nametara ikan zeyo.\" (Kochi dialect) is such one.\n\nNotes\n\nI found \"I beg your kindness.\" on the Yahoo BBS. An American interpreter in Japan proposed it for \"Yoroshiku onegai-shimasu.\" This is literally (a polite form of) \"I wish (you) (to do) properly\". More detailed \"I wish you to do (all) things in my favor (=properly)\". This is often translated to \"Nice to see/meet you.\", but it is obviously a kind of requesting, and also stands in for \"Thank you in advance\".\n\n[Here] is my translation of \"MEGITSUNE\" and notes.\n\n[Here] is my translation of \"Onnedari Dai Sakusen\" and notes. The lyric contains \"[From angel's face comes devil's whisper.]\" , \"I will ask Dad for it in secret from Mom.\", etc.\n\n\"Kakko\" is for parenthesis or bracket, and \"kakkoii\" is for \"cool\".\n\n[Here] is my translation of \"AKATSUKI\" and notes.\n\nX-Japan is a Japanese heavy metal band peaking in 1990's. Its fans often say \"Akatsuki\" is very X-Japan-like.\n\nBowing deep so that one's head touches to the ground, dogeza is an act of showing a deep deference, apology, or entreaty. But I think that Dogeza Headbanging is so called only because of the resemblance of posture and it doesn't have such meanings. Today I Learned Dogeza Headbanging originated from a visual-kei band \"the GazettE\".\n\nI insert \"kindly\" for Japanese \"-te-kureru\". it is something like \"(do something) for us\". \"Kureru\" alone is \"to give (us)\". It is used to show the perceiving of other's favor and the gratitude to it. For example, Japanese \"the audience sing with us.\" without \"-kureru\" suggests something like \"We don't care whether the audience sing or not\". BABYMETAL are well trained and use many \"-te-kureru\" but I drop most of them.\n\nI insert \"(we) get a chance to (do)\" for Japanese \"-sase-te-morau\". \"Morau\" alone is \"to receive\". Usually it is dropped and the translation is simple \"we do/did\". But it suggests \"We know someone helps us to do so and we appreciate it\" (originally? someone = Amitabha Buddha). If there is no actual help, it suggests only \"We are allowed to do so.\" or \"We have the right to do so\". It's redundant. I drop such ones.\n\nShifting-up (=shakuri) is the singing technique typically used in enka. The singer starts the note at lower pitch (one whole tone or more) and shifts up (quickly) to the target pitch. The range, speed and curve of shifting and which note to shift up, all are important.\n\n\"Tsugaru Kaikyo Fuyugeshiki\" is a famous typical enka, released in 1977, sung by Sayuri ISHIKAWA. The lyrics are like: \"When I got off the night train from Tokyo Ueno, the Aomori Station was already veiled with snow. There was a crowd going back to the North but all were silent. I could hear only the sea roaring. I too got into the ferry ship. Watching a sea gull freezing, I kept on weeping. Ah, this is a winter scene of the Tsugaru Strait\". ...\"Farewell, my darling.\" comes on the second chorus.\n\nMasako NATSUME is the actress who said \"Nametara ikan zeyo\" in a movie in 1982 and made it famous.\n\nThe transcription is below."
