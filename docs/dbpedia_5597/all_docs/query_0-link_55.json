After well over five years of research and writing, this journey has taught us as much about the state of Japan’s space politics, policy, and technology as about what their combination may mean for Japan’s security directions. This book surprised us in many ways, the most important of which is that it was not the one we started out to write. As industry analysts, we began very modestly with a focus on the major pillars of Japan’s space technology—space launch vehicles, satellites and spacecraft, and emerging technological niches—as well as the set of public and especially private actors who make them. In connecting the dots for this book, we learned that, as in other countries, space technology in Japan did not proceed in a vacuum. The more we studied the sector’s twists and turns, the more we learned to place Japan’s space technology in its proper evolutionary context—that is, in the flow of technical and paradigmatic changes worldwide, as well as the currents of political and social changes in Japan. Early on, we came to the joint conclusion that the entire tenor of Japan’s space program was shift ing from what we could best describe as the market-to-the-military. By this we mean that it is no longer commercial but national security paradigms that are ever more critical in driving Japan’s space policy forward. Of course, only the excellence of Japan’s civil space program could have brought Japan to consider making such a shift. We are not unmindful of the many criticisms that have been levied against Japan’s civilian space program— some of which are well deserved—but there is also much there with which to xi\n\nxii PREFACE\n\nbe impressed. No matter what the criticisms, we are certainly impressed: with the sheer ingenuity of its engineers, with the stunning technological progress on a dime and with few huge disasters, with the subtle ways in which the legal and institutional structure was stretched to fit the technological realities, and also with the dogged persistence with which its leaders stressed autonomous and independent access to space at every turn. Because not everybody shares our enthusiasm for the minutiae of Japan’s space technology and policy, we also worked to make this a book of wider interest to space analysts, academics, policymakers, Japan and Asia specialists, technology experts, corporations, and businesses. The book is aimed specifically at those seeking to understand the broad contours of Japan’s spacerelated history and trends, those looking to understand the role of Japanese public actors and, especially, private corporations in advancing it, and also those seeking to understand what the discrete components of Japanese space developments may potentially mean for the country’s security policy in this new century. Stripped to its essentials, our point is simple: Japan has the technical wherewithal to be marked as a military space power and now has placed national security as the centerpiece of its space development strategy. Having developed a range of military space technologies that came about in its civilian space program, Japan is actively advancing space as a keystone of its security and diplomatic strategy. This reality will affect the substance and direction of the country’s national security in this new century. The militarization of space assets in Japan is not so much a game of numbers as it is an issue of technological realities, and now also the legal and institutional orientations that are beginning to reflect them. The story of how and why these technological realities came about and what they mean concretely for Japan’s defense glues our narrative together. There has certainly been news about Japan’s space programs in the Japanese media. But much of it has blandly focused on the big successes and failures of Japan’s rockets and satellites, as well as the activities of various Japanese astronauts. There has not been much analysis of the military angle, excepting the case of Japan’s spy satellites. Most foreign obser vers also report on Japan’s space program much in the same way, saying very little, if anything, about its relation to military and defense realities. Of course, for most of the postwar period, the Japanese government has itself never even remotely hinted at anything other than a civilian space program—until the spy satellites, until Ballistic Missile Defense, and, more\n\nPREFACE\n\nxiii\n\nimportant but much less well known, until the Kawamura initiative, and, most transformative of all, the new Basic Space Law all came along. To make our case clear, we show how distinct components of Japan’s space technology fit historically in the militarized aspects of space technologies in other countries at every turn possible. We are deeply grateful to the following people, who may well agree or disagree with the contents and interpretations presented in this book, but without whose time and keen insights over the years our analysis of Japanese space policy would not have been possible: Yasunori Matogawa, former director of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA); Masakazu Iguchi, former chairman of the Space Activities Commission (SAC); and Masakazu Toyoda, secretary-general at the Secretariat of the Strategic Headquarters for Space Policy (SHSP); as well as Kazuto Suzuki, Setusko Aoki, Akira Kubozono, Hirohisa Mori, and the countless other government and corporate officials interviewed over the years by Paul Kallender-Umezu. We also thank the following people who provided comments on part or all of the manuscript: Chris Hughes, Andrew Oros, T. J. Pempel, Ken Pyle, Robert Pekkanen, John Pekkanen, and Richard Samuels, as well as the very helpful reviewers for Stanford University Press. We thank our research assistants for their timely and superb work: Jacob Brown, Vitaliy Pradun, Hiro Sasada, Jessica Leitham, and Tasuku Watanabe. We also thank Stacy Wagner, our editor at Stanford University Press, for her incisive and thoughtful commentary on this manuscript and for taking it forward. Above all, we thank each other as good friends and colleagues over the years: SMP thanks PKU for tolerating her tendency to speak academically with such great good humor back in the real world and for so generously sharing his expertise; PKU thanks SMP for following along in his tracking of the actual twists and turns in the everyday news when we were seeking the big picture, and most of all for listening carefully back in the ivory tower. Finally, and most important, we thank our spouses and families for giving us the love, time, and space that made our long journey possible.

japan’s capabilities in space, with a view to understanding their progression over time.1 In the face of repeated commercial disappointments and continuing scientific uncertainties, Japan has managed to develop and maintain an indigenous space industry—one that today marks it as a military space power. Certainly, these developments in the industry have taken place in plain sight of the public within a steadily advancing civilian space program.2 Were all this part of a long-term coherent national strategy, of course, it would be understandable and perhaps play a part in the current debates refashioning our understanding of Japanese grand strategy. Inconveniently for the theorists, however, Japan’s commitment to the space industry long predates the very recent formulation of anything like a coherent national strategy, which came with the passage of Japan’s first ever Basic Space Law in 2008, and the subsequent Basic Space Plan in 2009. How, then, can we understand the long-term and significant commitment the country has made to space? How do we begin to understand the shift from what we call the market-to-the military in space developments? This latter question is all the more important because the new Basic Space Law matters in a fundamental and transformative way. It means that Japan’s space policy has officially transitioned from one that exists only for peaceful purposes (a distinct defi nition that originally limited Japan from the development of any space technology that could be used for military purposes) to one with a strong—and, at long last, visible—emphasis on national security and the use of military space as a critical component of Japan’s strategic defense.3 1\n\n2\n\nIN DEFENSE OF JAPAN\n\nImportant answers lie in the market. To be clear, the market was the driver not because of corporate success, but because of corporate setbacks. Through a conjunction of historical accidents rather than overarching purposeful design, corporations found their choices narrowing over time. With investments already in the commercial space industry that were not turning a profit, corporations looked to salvage or bolster their bottom lines by pushing their allies in the government to develop military space projects. Because of the unusual prevalence of dual-use technology in the space industry, this could be economically profitable and, as it turned out, politically attractive and legitimately possible over time as Japan faced rising external security challenges.4 These elements make up the essence of the market-to-military trend. In the meantime, through small twists and turns, the strategy of militarizing Japanese space assets—as observable through formal laws, institutions, reports, plans, policies, and so on—continues to reflect the economic interests and especially capabilities of the private makers of space technology. Why might a focus on space development be important at all? This is a dualuse sector, with assets that yield both civilian and military value and that are difficult to distinguish neatly across these very dimensions.5 Whether right or wrong, desirable or not, governments and militaries around the world increasingly mark space as a strategic asset and see it as a primary provider and enabler of of war-fighting capabilities. For most of the postwar era, because of tightly held constraints on the kinds of technology it could develop for space use, Japan never remotely hinted at the militarization of its space program. By this, we mean the recognition, value, and use of space assets for military, or national security, purposes. In the context of space-based military capabilities, we follow the key mission areas identified by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff as well as the United States Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).6 These include the abilities of a government to provide space support (i.e., to be able to get to and maneuver in space with functioning launch vehicles and spacecraft) and space force enhancement (i.e., to be able to increase the combat and success potential of a combat force). Both of these have long been seen without controversy, at least outside Japan, as force multipliers in that the technology increases the potential of traditional forces across a range of operations. But then there is the possibility of weaponization of space assets, which has also been carefully excised from mention in Japan’s civilian space program. This takes us into the nebulous—and, we believe, largely indistinguishable— realm of space control and counterspace (i.e., to be able to reap advantages of\n\nTHE MARKET-TO- MILITARY TREND\n\n3\n\nspace assets while others cannot through surveillance, protection, prevention, and negation); and also space force application (i.e., to be able to overtly engage in weaponization), which is highly controversial in terms of cost and effectiveness in the long run. The dimensions above are certainly relevant to an analysis of Japan’s space developments, and this is essentially what we undertake in this book. The market-to-military trend in Japan’s space sector is very much in keeping with worldwide trends, which showcase the importance of land, naval, air, and increasingly space, as dominant theaters of operations. As the most prominent example, since 2001, there has been a corresponding concern at the highest echelons of the U.S. government about protecting the nation’s ever-burgeoning reliance on space assets for both commercial and, especially, military purposes— a trend we will show is also reflected in Japan’s case in successive stages and across technologies.7 Other observers have of course provided commentaries on the shifting priorities of Japanese space policy from the late 1990s onward, foreseeing either a continuing and deepening national security role or an opportunity to be managed by major space players like the United States.8 To date, however, detailed analyses of the concomitant space systems—rockets and missiles, satellites and spacecraft, guidance, reentry, command, control systems, and so on—needed for Japan to develop an independent strategic military capability have not been available. We take steps in this general direction, with the goal of showing the range of systems Japan has and is developing with its space technologies that can be used for its national defense goals. From a global perspective, this is hardly controversial. The fact is space is not a true sanctuary from military activity by governments around the world—Japan now explicitly included.9 There are, of course, caveats in our Japan-centered narrative—failures, underdeveloped technologies, wrong turns and twists. Nevertheless, we maintain that Japan’s cutting-edge space technologies, and now its institutional and legislative changes, mark Japan as a military space power. To put it in the more wellknown dimensions above, we show how Japan long ago traversed space support, is now deeply engaged in space force enhancement, and may well have discrete elements of both space control and space force application well under way. UNDERSTANDING JAPAN’S SPACE POLICY\n\nIn this book we focus on space policy in Japan in a thematic and chronological fashion—the legal and institutional context, the players, the industry, and\n\n4\n\nIN DEFENSE OF JAPAN\n\nespecially the technology—to show how and in what ways Japan has been able to develop military capabilities in space. This is pertinent at a time when there are changes in Japan’s security policies that fuel debates about the country’s security directions and, popularly put, re-militarization ambitions.10 As recently as the start of 2008, it seemed that the debate over the scope and contents of Japan’s defense had emerged forcefully from its postwar shadows, with even nuclear options no longer as taboo in Japanese public discourse as they once were.11 As some suggested outright, it may well be true that Japan’s military posture has not been this robust since before the Pacific War.12 A number of small but concerted institutional and legal moves have interacted with geopolitical developments to move Japan steadily down the path to ever more assertive security postures.13 In early 2007 these moves resulted in the transformation of the Japan Defense Agency (JDA) into the Ministry of Defense (MOD)—the symbolic upgrading of Japan’s defense concerns most visible to an audience both at home and abroad. But the complicated fact is that such discrete elements in domestic politics, and the din associated with them, are now coalescing across people, parties, institutions, and laws in new struggles over how best to secure Japan in this new century.14 Nobody is quite sure what all this tumult means, or where it may be headed. In the meantime, these struggles continue to highlight ongoing controversies on a number of significant dimensions—the constrained but increasing nature of Japan as a military actor, the push and pull of Japan’s continued dependence on the alliance with the United States, and possibly the residual but eroding anti-militaristic sentiments across Japan.15 They also certainly continue to energize debates about retrenchment and radicalism in Japan’s security policy.16 Even with the gathering storm over Japan’s re-militarization debates, however, the case for Japan as a military space power is difficult to make all around. There are at least three reasons for this, the last of which segues into the analytics. First, a focus on Japan’s actual military capabilities is a small part of the debates over Japanese security policies. Seen in this light the very idea of Japan as a military space power seems misplaced given disputes over Japan’s status even as a conventional military power. However, earlier works have broken considerable ground in correcting impressions of Japan as a military pygmy.17 Even a very cursory examination we undertake below in line with these works shows that Japan continues to be on par with other countries in terms of military expenditures and even, to some extent, force capabilities.

Putting aside the United States, whose expenditures dwarf those of all others, it shows that Japan’s known value of military expenditures is comparable to that of other dominant players.18 Despite the 1 percent ceiling, estimates over roughly a fiveyear period place the country’s military expenditures among the highest in the world.19 Table 1.2 shows Japan’s military capabilities in comparison to other dominant military players, especially in the Asian region. In keeping with other estimates, it presents a mixed picture of Japan’s defensive and offensive capabilities across the ser vices.20 Japan’s Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) continues to lack any serious offensive capabilities for land warfare abroad, but can certainly defend its own turf.21 The Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) may also be somewhat stronger on defense, being able to protect its airspace using its fighters for defense and its Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft for coordination to improve situational awareness. Although Japan does not field offensive ground-attack missiles or air-to-ground munitions, ASDF pilots have begun to practice dropping live bombs, done first in Guam in July 2007, using F-2s that are jointly produced by the United States and Japan.22 The ASDF has also moved to improve its aerial refueling capabilities, and to modernize its own fleet.23 Finally, the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) has considerable defensive and offensive powers and is the strongest part of Japan’s military capabilities. It has a significant number of modern cruisers/destroyers, with the Kongō- and Atago-class destroyers also to be\n\nMaritime Forces\n\n (all modern)\n\n (all modern)\n\nFrigates/corvettes\n\nAttack submarines, nuclear-powered\n\n\n\nConventional medium-range ballistic missiles\n\n (all modern)\n\n\n\nConventional short-range ballistic missiles\n\nCruisers/destroyers\n\n, total (all modern)\n\nAttack helicopters\n\n ( modern)\n\n,\n\nArtillery pieces\n\nAircraft carriers\n\n\n\nLight tanks\n\n,\n\nAir Force\n\n,+ (all modern)\n\n,\n\nNavy\n\nMain battle tanks\n\n,\n\nArmy Reserves\n\nGround Forces\n\n,\n\nArmy\n\nPersonnel\n\nUnited States\n\nMea surements\n\n\n\n (all modern)\n\n ( modern)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ( modern)\n\n,\n\n\n\n (all modern)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\nJapan\n\n\n\n ( modern)\n\n (all modern)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ( modern)\n\n,+\n\n\n\n, (, modern)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,, (all ser vices)\n\n,\n\nSouth Korea\n\nJapan’s Conventional Military Forces in Comparative Perspective\n\nSer vice\n\nTable 1.2.\n\n\n\n ( modern)\n\n\n\n\n\n~ ( modern)\n\n?

North Korea’s conventional missiles information is taken from “North Korean Missiles,” available online at www.globalsecurity.org (accessed 18 July 2007). The chart represents the numbers present in the original sources, although not necessarily orga nized or added in the same fashion. For example, in any given country, SAMs operated by all ser vices are added for a single numerical value. Because different militaries orga nize the same assets (like SAMs) under different ser vices, to facilitate side-by-side comparisons, assets in the chart are orga nized according to their role, rather than what ser vice they are under in their original countries. Hence, instead of using the more conventional army, navy, and air force rubrics, the chart uses the ground, maritime, and air forces rubrics. note: Modern equipment is defi ned as a design that is not outclassed by systems widely deployed throughout the world but is not limited to cutting-edge.

Our purpose in highlighting them is to suggest that, like conventional ones, Japan’s space-based military capabilities also deserve attention as a cohesive whole. This is because, in line with the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA)— which only underscores the importance of space assets and technologies to national defense—the SDF no doubt recognizes that its advantage over regional rivals will come not so much in the quantitative upgrading of conventional capabilities across its ser vices.26 Rather, it is bound to come in the technological and qualitative enhancements in space-based resources. Such an analysis is especially valuable today as Japan is thought to have a much more effective military than it had in the postwar period—that is, in terms of internal management and organization, foreign integration, and work with the United States, and, of particular interest to us, use of intelligence and technology.27 As we attempt to show in the rest of the book, Japan’s considerable military capabilities are made more considerable by the country’s already advanced space technology prowess. Features like its reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities, as well as the country’s burgeoning ballistic missile defense (BMD) system, will continue to be upgraded and integrated into its military space infrastructure by domestic players. Therefore, like its conventional capabilities, Japan’s space capabilities should not be underestimated, and deserve to be better understood by allies or rivals. A second reason why it has been difficult to appreciate Japan’s military capabilities in space is because any such cohesive emphasis has been absent at the national level, both in terms of strategy and organizational coherence. As we document more thoroughly in Chapters 2 and 3, from the time that Japan launched its historic Pencil rocket in 1955 to the passage of the Basic Space Law in 2008, there was much contestation over and many changes in the governance even of civilian space activities, let alone military oriented ones. Indeed the one element that was supposed to color all of Japan’s space actitivites in relation to defense was the Diet’s Peaceful Purposes Resolution (PPR) in 1969, which pointed in the opposite direction to space militarization in terms of\n\nTHE MARKET-TO- MILITARY TREND\n\n9\n\nofficial policy. Great care was taken by the government to express all its subsequent interpretations and policy changes under this rubric, and the emphasis was generally on the commercialization of space assets and the scientific explorations of the heavens. Independent access to space was certainly part of the official rhetoric and policy, but any hint of its relation to boosting Japan’s defenses was absent from public documents and statements. To be sure, the saga of Japan’s spy satellites and BMD drew much attention, but these were treated almost as isolated developments in the larger debates about the peaceful purposes resolution and Japan’s re-militarization rather than as discrete elements of a military space infrastructure. By and large, what attention there was focused on the negative facets of Japan’s civilian and commercial space activities: the lack of progression and failure to commercialize Japanese space technologies in global markets, the lack of space planning at the highest levels, mixed signals from top committees supposedly controlling space activities, endless reviews following depressingly familiar failures, a devastating downgrading of Japan’s space activities to the second rank of national scientific priorities, and attacks on Japan’s international space activities by a budget-conscious Ministry of Finance (MOF). Compounding these negatives was the fact that the research, development, and testing of specific space technologies, was spread across a morass of public institutions and private corporations that themselves went through successive bouts of changes. All this made it difficult to pinpoint, much less assess, the potential military applications of legitimate civilian space technologies. While this morass of players, especially on the public side, was often pinpointed as a source of national incoherence in space policy, it also had the effect of shielding the development of technologies from negative budgetary, political, or public attention. Component by component, even highly controversial militarized space technologies, such as potential reentry warheads or anti-satellite (ASAT) systems, continued to be researched, manufacturted, and tested under legitimate civilian uses and goals. Third, as we now turn to showing more specifically in terms of the analytical framework of the project, the construction of academic and policy debates on Japan’s security policies has not exactly allowed a comprehensive focus on Japan’s space capabilities. From a political economy perspective, the debates have generally favored analyses based on ideas and institutions, but not so much interests. Specifically, existing debates on Japan’s militarization have focused attention on the importance of theoretical paradigms and constitutional\n\n10\n\nIN DEFENSE OF JAPAN\n\nchanges. As discussed below, controversies about such approaches are broadly important in framing our market-to-military thesis concerning Japan’s space technologies. However, we argue that, by and large, a focus on the concrete private interests behind Japan’s space technologies lends greater specificity to explaining Japan’s space policy over time. We therefore concentrate as much as possible on the activities of defense-related corporations that are central to advancing the actual state of Japan’s space technologies—the kinds of products they are able to produce and what those products suggest for the market-tomilitary thesis over the postwar period. This, then, is a book about Japan’s space-related technologies and policy and not a book about Japan, international relations theory, or legal change. Nevertheless, below we situate and relate our focus to broader questions of Japan’s security along these very dimensions to show how and in what ways they might be relevant to our question. This clarifies our own positions on some of the existing controversies and puts our specialist focus in broader contexts. Our emphasis allows us to assess whether and how realist approaches (emphasizing power and techno-security concerns) and constructivist frameworks (emphasizing pacifist and anti-militarist norms) were relevant to the course of the space technology that came into play in the postwar period. It also allows us to get a clear sense of whether constitutional norms constrained the militarization of space assets over the same period. Analytical Approaches\n\nThis section draws out three possible ways of analyzing the market-to-military trend: realist and constructivist approaches, as well as constitutional concerns, both of which have figured prominently in larger debates about Japan’s militarization, and interest-based approaches that have not. We do not provide any definitive or competing tests of these theoretical paragdigms or analytical approaches; rather, we assess their interplay in the evolution of Japan’s space saga. Our focus is largely on the interest-based approach that we think is most relevant to the advancement of space technologies in national defense. In some of the more prominent debates over Japan’s militarization, scholars have focused on a long-running debate that pits theoretical perspectives in the study of international relations against each other. At the center of the controversy is the school of realism, with its historical emphasis on self-interest, relative power, competition, and security as the prime determinants of outcomes among states.28 These concerns are reinforced by Contested Theories\n\nTHE MARKET-TO- MILITARY TREND\n\n11\n\nthe persistent presence of anarchy in the international system, which has itself led to a fundamental divergence in contemporary realism, whether of the neorealist (focused on international outcomes) or neoclassical realist (focused on foreign policy strategies) variety. Simply put, offensive realism holds that anarchy provides strong incentives for offensive action as a means to security; however, defensive realism gives greater weight to moderation and prudence in the search for security.29 Such intra-realist divisions are not necessarily clear-cut conceptually or practically as states’ motivations stem from a range of interrelated security, power, and expansion concerns. But for realists of all stripes, the imperative for Japan (as other states) in contemporary international politics is clear: militarize or else! This is not an issue of autonomy or international collaboration, which is indeed a false dichotomy, whether in conventional or space assets.30 As the Council on Security and Defense Capabilities (CSDC), a highly influential advisory group to the prime minister, noted pragmatically at the end of 2004, whether a state like Japan militarizes by direct acquisition of military goods from abroad or by indirect indigenization of related technology at home is less important than the fact that it must do so in its own interest.31 Following realist premises, this is because the consequence of anarchy in world politics for Japan, like all other positional states, is that it cannot ultimately count on anyone; that it must above all seek to survive by evaluating its power relative to other states; that the only certainty is uncertainty; and that there are never iron-clad guarantees of security for any state even from allies or alliances in a fluid geostrategic environment. This fluidity is evidenced today in the relationship between the United States and the former Soviet Union: their strict bipolarity is gone, and other strategic competitors are rising. Not surprisingly, as discussed earlier, scholars have shown a great deal of interest in understanding the potential impact of these structural changes on Japan’s security policy. Although it is fair to say that there is ever more support for a realist framework in the latest emerging literature on Japan’s security policy, it is still difficult to pinpoint definitive backing for either offensive or defensive realism across the board because it is difficult to categorize security postures neatly across these dimensions. Perhaps more on point is whether Japan’s acquisition of military-related—specifically space-related—technology has implications for the offense-defense balance.32 Although alluring in its simplicity (balance shifts based on technology affect the likelihood of conflict) and predictive power (technology favoring the offense increases the\n\n12\n\nIN DEFENSE OF JAPAN\n\nlikelihood of conflict), the offensive-defensive balance of military technology also remains controversial. Chief among the controversies is that scholars have found it very difficult to come up with objective and robust criteria for distinguishing between offensive and defensive technologies (and postures)— which in turn means an emphasis on both tangible and perceptual elements. Such problems are especially acute in dual-use space technologies, and for this reason we stick to the more nuanced earlier emphases on space support, space force enhancement, space control, and space force application in our assessment of Japan’s space technologies. Contrary to realist impulses, scholars have used constructivism to argue that Japan is and will remain disinclined toward militarism. At its core, the constructivist paradigm accords centrality to ideological, ideational, and social processes in world politics and from that persepective asserts that they can have a causal impact on actors’ behavior even in what has long been analyzed as a materially oriented realpolitik realm with self-interested actors.33 Put simply, the “international” is not some given and absolute reality but one that is socially structured and unstructured by interacting actors with shared identities and interests that are themselves socialized over time across institutions and issues. Collective beliefs and values have a profound impact on the behavior of actors, the way they see the world, and the way they wish to see it. From this vantage point, then, even realpolitik is constructed. It is constructed not in the heads of self-interested actors or in material capabilities but, more importantly, in practices, processes, and normative expectations in the international system. Nor is all of this some reactive slam on rationalist approaches. After all, at any given time, actors may well strategize rationally to reconfigure existing sets of preferences and identities and even the broader social context. From studies asserting the importance of state identity and cultural-institutional context as having an independent impact on national security policies to those stressing the ways in which these elements determine defense politics at a given time, the focus is on carefully tracing processes and empirics to provide ammunition for central claims about the importance of norms and changes in social construction. Central to constructivist-oriented paradigms about Japan is its alleged “culture of anti-militarism,” with its roots in antipathy toward the collective memories of uncontrollable militaristic actions during the Pacific War.34 Given the realities of Japan’s postwar defeat and surrender, analysts focus on a set of institutionalized norms that have shaped and, some believe, continue to\n\nTHE MARKET-TO- MILITARY TREND\n\n13\n\nconstrain postwar Japanese security policy—strict civilian control, penetration by economic ministries, constraints of Japan’s peace constitution, and anti-militaristic public skepticism. In short, pacifist and anti-militarist norms pervade Japanese society.35 Whether sympathetic to the school of constructivism or not, others have also often lent indirect support over the years to such constructivist claims with their broad-based assertions that Japan is not militarizing commensurate with its economic might in the global system as realism might predict or that it continues to remain a political or security pygmy.36 Like the realist paradigm, the constructivist one is compelling but also questionable in practice. As they cannot use it to explain both continuity and change, those who helped pioneer studies on the culture of antimilitarism in Japan are, for example, more cautious about its continued importance in the future of Japanese military security.37 This is not to say that the normalization of Japan’s defense posture commensurate with the use of force exercised by powers such as France or Great Britain will take place anytime soon, but that both Japan’s military and its military operations are now accepted across domestic politics. Others have also acknowledged that, although long-standing anti-militarist constraints continue to be at play, decisions such as the development and deployment of surveillance satellites do ultimately reflect a progression toward realist-oriented security policies.38 Even those who downplay potential shifts in Japan’s security postures or identity on the grounds of tepid or incremental responses in legislation, policies, technologies, and direction are mindful of the realities of change in Japan.39 At the very least, their works suggest that the social construction of defense politics for Japan (independent of actors and material capabilities as constructivists stress) has changed domestically and internationally. To put it in constructivist terms, then, the point is that Japanese actors may now be engaged in the social reconstruction of a new defense paradigm for Japan. The slower recognition and acknowledgment in this direction thus far may be because constructivism overemphasizes the role of social structures and norms and does so at the expense of understanding the role of agents who can create and change them in the first place—which segues into our own argument about the importance of following the interests of private actors.40 For the purposes of simply framing our central concern with the marketto-military trend, the bottom line from these nuanced academic works is this: if realist paradigms (of any stripe) are valid, we should expect to see a greater\n\n14\n\nIN DEFENSE OF JAPAN\n\nemphasis in the direction of military capabilities in space and to see such an emphasis come to the fore more visibly with the increasing geopolitical uncertainties for Japan; but if constructivist paradigms are valid, we should expect to see that the specific set of norms considered important significantly swayed or checked the market-to-military trend over the postwar period. Parallel to the academic debates, there are also controversies over constitutional limits and interpretation that are more pragmatically relevant in the real world. Although such controversies serve as the fount for the constructivist paradigm related to Japan, they stand on their own for most lawyers and legal scholars. The most well-known controversy concerns Article 9 of the 1947 Japanese constitution, by the existing provisions of which the Japanese people not only forever renounce war as a sovereign right but also the threat or use of force to settle international disputes. To give effect to this aspiration, the provisions also make clear that Japan will never maintain land, sea, and air forces, as well as potential war materiel.41 From its inception, the revision of the American-imposed constitution has been a cornerstone of conservative politics in Japan.42 Formal activities to revise the constitution date back as early as 1955, the same year that Japan launched its historic Pencil rocket. Even the Americans backtracked under the exigencies of the Cold War early on, beginning with calls in 1950 for Japan to support U.S. efforts during the Korean War. Successive LDP governments were also committed, to varying degrees, to what can best be described in the pragmatic interest of Japan’s defense as constitutional bypassing. By the mid2000s, a number of concerted steps by conservative leaders signalled strong interest in constitutional change—researching the right to collective selfdefense, pushing through a new educational law focused on instilling patriotism in schools, upgrading the JDA to ministry status, revising the SelfDefence Force (SDF) law, and most directly on point, suggesting a timetable for constitutional revision.43 The question perhaps is no longer whether or not the Japanese constitution will be changed. Rather, the critical question may well turn out to be in which direction, to what extent, and with what ultimate purpose constitutional changes will come about, as the various legislative changes as well as public proposals show.44 The pragmatic politics of Japan’s contested constitution came to the fore when the Japanese government dispatched the SDF personnel for the multinational force in Iraq in December 2003.45 In turn, this triggered several highContested Constitutionalism\n\nTHE MARKET-TO- MILITARY TREND\n\n15\n\nprofi le responses from the United States and Japan, with the United States suggesting that Article 9 hindered U.S. as well as Japanese defense interests at several levels. Diplomatically, the United States’ support for Japan’s efforts to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council was contingent on the willingness and ability of Japan to deploy military forces in the interests of the international community. Domestically, the presence of constitutional interpretations prohibiting the exercise of Japan’s right to collective self-defense also needed to be revised in order to strengthen the military alliance between the two countries, pressures for which built as Japan geared up for missile defense deployment in the 1990s, as we detail in Chapter 6.46 In fact, the old domestic taboos and regional reservations about dispatching Japanese forces had already been melting away at that point, as incrementally the SDF began to play a greater visible role in foreign operations since 2001.47 At that point, in the wake of 9/11, Japan dispatched ships of the Maritime Self Defense Force (MSDF) to the Arabian Sea to provide rear-area logistical support for the U.S. military operations, both against Al-Qaeda and against the Taliban in Afghanistan. To make that possible, in October 2001 the AntiTerrorism Special Measures Law (ATSML) was enacted, and it expanded the scope of permissible noncombat operations for the SDF. The LDP and the DPJ have moved to consolidate their party positions on issues of national security. In contrast to most of the postwar period, they can do so quite visibly in a domestic political environment in which there is growing public support for revision or amendment of a U.S. imposed constitution.48 Politically, structural changes in Japan’s electoral system toward a hybrid mixed-member electoral system, institutional reforms that have increased the prime minister’s crisis and security policymaking capacity, as well as a decrease in inter-party differences over security issues bode well for Japan’s militarization.49 Efforts at distinguishing policies across parties are certainly important in that they continue to gain media visibility around the world when they do crop up. The July 2007 Upper House election, in which the DPJ came out ahead and the LDP was trounced, was a forceful reminder that the passage of further constitutional or defense-related legislation is not exactly assured.50 Of par ticu lar interest was that although many insiders believed that the proposed space bill would be signed into law without much trouble, the loss of LDP control delayed its passage.51 Such legislative battles might be thought to be even more relevant as of August 2009, because the DPJ is in power, and Japan appears to have gone beyond a one-party system. One view\n\n16\n\nIN DEFENSE OF JAPAN\n\nis that as genuine party differences on legislation and policies come increasingly to the fore, electoral politics across parties and individuals may well become a more viable force to contend with in shaping defense policies over the years.52 However, on the front line of current space development, ideological or party differences on Japan’s military space policy appear to be less relevant. The Basic Space Law, which enacts Japan’s military space development over the next ten years, was passed with strong support by the DPJ. Another clear measure of this can be found directly in the space budget passed in January 2010, which has kept all the dual-use and military space programs mandated by the Basic Space Law.53 At this stage it can safely be said that differences on security issues have become less ideological on the left-right divide, are far more pragmatic in character, and now run primarily within rather than across political party lines.54 Since 1994, when the voters effectively dismantled the Left in Japanese politics as the Socialists accepted the premiership for their principles (strict interpretation of Article 9 and opposition to the U.S.–Japan alliance and the SDF forces), it has been clear that there is currently little of the Left remaining in Japanese politics. There are, in other words, few credible adherents of the strict postwar pacifism now left across the full spectrum of Japan’s political parties; and, judging from the patterns thus far in the new security environment, there are probably few pacifists left who are not willing to compromise on boosting Japan’s defense, maybe even through some sort of revision of the existing constitution. In the end, rather than high-profile electoral maneuvering, what needs to be watched with regards to Japan’s defense are incremental moves within and across party lines.55 Formal steps toward revision of the Japanese constitution have been taking place since 2000, and that trajectory to date is worth noting.56 In January 2000, Constitutional Research Commissions were set up in both the Upper and Lower Houses of the Japa nese Diet. By December, basic principles and drafts plans for a new constitution began to be circulated by political parties like the Liberal Party (which went on to merge with the DPJ in 2003) and the LDP. In October 2001, discussions by the Constitutional Research Commission in the Lower House revealed that there was broad consensus in favor of constitutional revision, regarding Article 9 and the exercise of collective defense, among the specialists invited by both the LDP and DPJ. A year later, in November 2002, the same Constitutional Research Commission submitted an interim report calling for constitutional revision in light of the shift ing\n\nTHE MARKET-TO- MILITARY TREND\n\n17\n\ndomestic and international environment. In March 2005 the Lower House Constitutional Research Commission passed the draft for its final report, which enjoyed the support of the LDP, DPJ, and New Kōmeitō, although both the LDP and DPJ continued to circulate their own textual revisions and draft constitutions. By April 2005 the Upper House also issued its final report. Given the economic stakes evident in the militarization of space-related technologies that we stressed earlier, business interests in Japan have also weighed in on the constitutional revision debate. In April 2003, Japan’s highly influential and very powerful business lobby group, Nippon Keidanren, called for constitutional revision and legal restructuring in areas like foreign policy and national security; in January 2005, it went on to produce a report that advocated the revision of the constitution and the enactment of legislation to allow a national referendum on revisions to the constitution. All this activity led to an even more concrete result, as far as enabling procedures for formal revision. In April 2007, the LDP and New Kōmeitō used a majority vote to push forward the national referendum bill to amend the constitution in the Lower House; the bill then also cleared the Upper House a month later in May over the express objections of the then DPJ opposition.57 At the very least, the procedural way is now paved for Japan to mould the U.S.-imposed constitution from a bygone era into one that speaks to Japanese interests in the unfolding new geopolitical game. As of 2010, constitutional revision in Japan remains an open-ended story, fueling controversy over changes such as the newly enacted anti-piracy law that allows the government to dispatch the MSDF (along with the Japanese Coast Guard) abroad to combat piracy, and the coming into effect of the National Referendum Law.58 The constitutional dance has always generated much controversy and interest because of what it implies about Japan’s reassertion of its sovereign military rights in the international and regional system. We cannot say for sure whether and how Japan’s constitution and Article 9 in par ticu lar, will indeed change even with the procedural steps locked in place.59 From our vantage point as industry analysts, we also have a slightly different perspective on the matter. Seen through the prism of development of space assets, the controversies over constitutional revision are, in our judgment, less a barometer of Japan’s remilitarizing ambitions; instead, we believe they are far more instructive today in showing that the Japanese government and industry have come a very long way from that episode in Japan’s postwar history in which they consciously chose to avoid association with defense production.60 The bottom\n\n18\n\nIN DEFENSE OF JAPAN\n\nline here is that, given the wording of Article 9, we should expect to see the constitutional text, norms, and interpretations check the progress of militarization of space assets. Focusing on Economic Interests Framing our approach with existing theoretical paradigms and constitutional controversies is important because they not only provide a rich context but also ensure against excessive dogma. While mindful of their importance, however, we believe that far more relevant for the advancement of Japan’s space technologies are the industrial and electronics companies, who are also Japan’s primary defense contractors, and who have also operated under the same social and political exigencies as other actors in postwar Japan. The starting point for understanding their activties is the contemporary geopolitical context, which has been uppermost in explanations of Japan’s ever more visible realist orientations. The type of threats Japan faces at the tumultuous start of the twenty-first century, with two nuclear-armed neighbors in northeast Asia, means that, more than ever, Japan’s military defense requires a sophisticated technological response—one that has long been entrenched and is now openly being acknowledged, across sectors and over time.61 In an open interview, Gen Nakatani, former JDA director-general and later member of the House of Representatives, pointed correctly to the changed nature of threats for Japan’s security in the region.62 These have moved from concerns about outright invasion to ones that highlight the more sophisticated link between technology and security, such as ballistic missile attacks, surveillance and intelligence, and the presence of spy ships in Japanese waters. In laying out its visions for Japan’s security needs in the new century, the CSDC began a 2004 report by noting that the complex nature of threats Japan now faces range from terrorist attacks by nonstate entities to traditional warfare.63 The unstable external environment was also the launching theme for the National Defense Program Guideline released in 2005 by the then JDA.64 The Special Committee on Space Development, under the Policy Affairs Research Council of the LDP, took its cue from the rapid development of missile launches by North Korea and China’s burgeoning space program to heavily criticize the existing institutional and strategic space policy structure for its failure to consider integrated space development and utilization in a way that spoke to Japan’s national security.65 The timing of nuclear testing by North\n\nTHE MARKET-TO- MILITARY TREND\n\n19\n\nKorea in 2006 played into the hawkish orientations of the incoming Abe government and further underscored the necessity of an integrated riposte such as the institutionalization of a Japanese version of the U.S. National Security Council (NSC), which has not come to fruition, and the upgrading of the JDA to a full-fledged MOD, which has.66 As of 2009, a range of events and opinions suggest that regional military realities are coloring Japan’s security discourse—chief among them North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile tests, as well as China’s rising power over the long run.67 But the external still has to be fi ltered through the domestic lens. We believe that ultimately, of course, the specific turns and twists in Japan’s defense will be determined by domestic factors, including the fate of institutionalized norms that already, contrary to expectations even a decade ago, appear to be more belligerent.68 Thus our line of reasoning is simple but solidly situated in the flow of geopolitical realities in which Japan finds itself: Largely because they can profit from the shifting parameters of Japan’s security concerns by pushing the militarization of space technologies, the interests and capabilities of private actors have become increasingly critical to the future of any general debates about Japan’s militarization. This focus in the broader security picture of Japan is not new. In fact, private industry and defense contractors have long been embedded in and were central to Japan’s militarization saga across historical periods.69 Our emphasis that Japanese space-related corporations have moved to advantage themselves economically in the contemporary shifting geopolitical landscape has resonance in the interwar period as well. Nor is our emphasis analytically controversial from the perspective of political economy in which, relative especially to diff use interests, the greater influence of concentrated interests on economic policymaking is considered to be a well-established proposition.70 Generally, political economists expect policy to be biased in favor of special or concentrated interests because publics or electorates may well be confounded by the effect or technical complexity of such policies. However, this is not to discount the importance of diff use interests, which can have a powerful impact given factors such as preference intensity on a par ticular issue or policy, patterns of group organization, and domestic political institutions. Thus although we emphasize the importance of space-related enterprises in the context of Japan’s space policy, we too remain attentive that the anti-militaristic sentiments of the Japanese public has thus far constrained the outright militarization of Japan’s space technologies, whether by public or private enterprises.\n\n20\n\nIN DEFENSE OF JAPAN\n\nThus, to sum up, our simple underlying contention is that space-related technologies can, have been, and are increasingly being shifted from the market to the military in the interest of Japan’s national defense. As Japan’s external security concerns rose to the fore of public discourse, we contend that in seeking to survive over time, a specific set of Japanese corporations has shifted more visibly than ever before from commercialization to militarization of space-related technologies—a process that has had and will continue to have important implications for Japan’s space military capabilities for national defense. We also contend that as the security discourse in Japan has changed, this market-to-military trend, vocalized by the corporate sector, began to be reflected in the national space strategy. Developments as recently as 2005, such as the Kawamura initiative discussed later in this book, made clear that the policymaking structure for Japan’s space development would shortly reflect the market-to-military trend. If our underlying reasoning is correct, we can expect to see several interrelated things: that the underlying space technologies are transposable from civil to military uses; that a key set of corporations with concrete interests remain pivotal in advancing space technologies on both fronts; that the more commercial prospects seem shaky, the more likely it is that the military angle looms large over civil space-related ventures; and that, fi nally, the fabric of political and legal structures reflect military space concerns. Although not doctrinaire and certainly mindful of other elements that come into play, we will trace these essential themes through the narrative. Over the course of the first decade of the 2000s, we have seen the market-to-military trend come to center stage in Japan’s space policy, with important consequences for Japan’s defense and security debates at a pragmatic level.71 At the end of 2002, as our research for this book got under way, the trend was barely detectable, even in an integrated analysis of the technological and legal developments in Japan’s space sector. In 2009, as we went to press, the covers of this trend were being lifted more quickly than we had anticipated, revealing a much more overt militarized stance in official Japanese space policy. Mindful of the historical complexities, as well as theoretical and constitutional controversies outlined above, we want to be clear about what we are not saying: We are not claiming that corporations were the only players in shaping Japan’s space policy or the broader nature of Japan’s defense politics. In addition, we are not claiming that the development of space technologies, the functionality of which can be more critical in military systems, is the solution to\n\nTHE MARKET-TO- MILITARY TREND\n\n21\n\nall of Japan’s defense concerns in the future. But we do maintain that corporate interest and competence are critical elements in the market-to-military trend. By concentrating on the space industry, we seek to show that the technological state of Japan’s militarization is far more advanced than appreciated, given the range of space-related technologies that are already at play within the portfolios of relevant corporations and government agencies. To that end, we are focused, first and foremost, on carefully tracking the incremental but concrete changes in specific space technologies across the postwar period. If the historical experience of other space powers is a guide, we should fully expect Japan to also exploit the dual-use strategic nature of space technology. Perhaps more significant, Japan’s own historical experience attests to this leaning as military production was dual-use right from the start, and private contractors have long been central to technological diff usion across private and public spheres.72 Such changes and advances in Japan’s space technologies have not come about overnight; rather, as we show, the technologies were painstakingly acquired by Japanese corporations, often in conjunction with government agencies, over the course of several decades. As discrete elements and to the untrained eye, these technologies do not themselves appear to be anything other than what they are—solid rockets to launch scientific satellites, liquid rockets to launch heavier satellites, communication and Earth observation satellites, highly precise positioning systems, pod de-orbiting ability, satellite inspection technologies, and so on. But the critical point, as stressed earlier, is that many space technologies are inherently dual-use, making it difficult even for professionals to distinguish their civilian and military uses from each other. The most salient recent example came in early April 2009 with North Korea’s rocket launch. When North Korea asserted that its rocket launch was only a satellite mission, Japan and the West charged that any such rocket could also be linked to a ballistic missile program that had the capability to deliver a nuclear weapon.73 The same logic can also be brought to bear on assessing Japan’s civilian space program. To those familiar with space technology and applications, those very same precise positioning systems, pod de-orbiting systems, and, especially satellite inspection technologies just mentioned, for example, are also basically military applications that Japan can legitimately say it developed for expressly peaceful purposes. At the most basic level, it is this duality embedded in Japan’s technoeconomic security that allows us to posit the basis for a comprehensive Japanese\n\n22\n\nIN DEFENSE OF JAPAN\n\nsecurity policy in the space sector in the long run.74 Japan’s well-established doctrine of comprehensive security—one that pragmatically recognizes the twin importance of economic and military security—as a means of advancing its national interests is critical.75 As a nation beholden to the U.S.–Japan alliance—where a weaker state like Japan faces the attendant risks of entrapment or abandonment from its more powerful partner—Japan’s quest for technological autonomy through defense production has undoubtedly allowed much of its strategic military capability to be couched within the postwar goal of economic growth.76 By focusing on what private actors have been able to achieve, we show how this line of reasoning resonates, albeit unevenly, across a range of Japan’s space activities. A ROADMAP FOR THIS BOOK\n\nThe story of the militarization of Japan’s space technology is inextricably bound with unfolding geopolitical realities. Within them Japan’s defenserelated corporations have moved successfully to exploit the changing external and internal security atmosphere in the interest of their own commercial survival and profitability. Thanks to their efforts, there is little question that spacerelated assets have made progress in boosting Japan’s military capabilities and, as we enter the next decade, military space will become an essential, fundamental, deployed, and strategic component of Japan’s defense. When the changes in the space sector in Japan are examined cumulatively and carefully over time—in particular, the products from private actors—they suggest that Japanese militarization has moved well beyond the theoretical and constitutional dimensions. Concerns with space-sector funding notwithstanding, we aim to show that taken together, the incremental market developments within this sector over the postwar period are coalescing into a strategic military capability.77 Japanese space development, in short, has moved from the fi rst phase of catch-up, through the second phase of attempted commercialization, and well into the third phase in which the market-to-military trend is increasingly evident. With this as background, empirics take center stage in the remainder of the book: What are the notable activities and products in Japan’s space industry? What do space-related technologies imply about Japan’s military capability over time? What, in turn, does all of this imply about Japan’s tangible militarization prospects in the near future? The remainder of the book illustrates the market-to-military trend in a thematic and chronological fashion. Chapter 2 sets out the actual evolution of Japan’s space policy that has brought efforts to\n\nTHE MARKET-TO- MILITARY TREND\n\n23\n\nmilitarize space technologies over the course of the 2000s into sharp relief. It provides an account of space development in Japan from the postwar period to the close of the 2000s, focusing on the historical, institutional, and corporate elements that have coalesced to push Japan further down the path from the market to the military. Chapter 3 turns to the Japanese players in the space militarization saga, laying out the key players, their motivations, and tactics. The next three chapters then turn directly to the historical development of specific space assets, drawing out links to the ways in which they have been or are being militarized in the interest of defending Japan. Chapter 4 focuses on one of the stated official pillars of Japan’s space program, namely rockets. This includes both liquid and especially solid rockets that have implications for Japan’s acquisition of ICBM technology. Chapter 5 focuses on the second official pillar of Japan’s space program: satellites and spacecraft, which are critical for reconnaissance and, less appreciated, for supporting military communication networks and counterspace, particularly anti-satellite (ASAT), capabilities. Chapter 6 focuses on specific cutting-edge space-related technologies that are currently under development, particularly with Operationally Responsive Space (ORS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4SIR), and counterspace technologies. Chapter 7 concludes by assessing Japan’s capabilities, drawing out the analytical and policy implications of the country’s space capabilities. It also reexamines our findings under the newly minted Basic Space Law and the new Basic Space Plan, which for the first time in Japan’s postwar history give the country a comprehensive national space strategy.\n\n2\n\nEVOLUTION OF JAPAN’S SPACE POLICY\n\nin this chapter, we turn to the historical onset of space development in Japan, paying close attention to the country’s institutional structure governing space policy, as well as the ups and downs the Japanese space industry faced in global competition in the postwar decades. During this period, there have been a range of legal and political constraints put in place to govern the development of space assets as shown in Table 2.1, and some of these were designed specifically to guard against the military uses of space. Over time, however, the militarization of space-related technologies became an ever steadier component of the overall space policy rubric in terms of rhetoric, planning, and industry demands. Using the principal constraints on Japan’s space policy as set out in Table 2.1, this chapter focuses on tracing such developments in two parts, one focusing on government-centered changes and the other on industryrelated demands. GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR SPACE ACTIVITIES\n\nIt is helpful to begin with a clear understanding of the fundamental legal and institutional context in which the Japanese government has operated. This section provides a brief discussion of the main instruments set out in Table 2.1, with a par ticu lar focus on those restraining the military uses of space that have long been of pragmatic interest to defense-related actors in the public and private spheres. In 1969, Japan’s industrialization of space began with two events, both of which indicated a clear and unequivocal official commitment to peacefulonly, nonmilitary development.1 The first of these was
