On June 29, 2008 she released her debut indie, Manopiano.\n\nShe's been featured as the opening act in various of her senpai's concerts (Abe Natsumi, Morning Musume, Berryz Koubou and C-ute), starting in August 2008.\n\nHaving received piano lessons since kindergarten, Mano's solo work within Hello! Project prominently features her the playing piano parts of her musical releases, providing the vocal and piano parts of her songs while performing in concerts and at live events.

She's sent to Japan as a spy for the Queen of England, and ends up passing an idol audition, so she has trouble with her espionage duties. The theme song of the show is \"Matsuge no Saki ni Kimi ga Iru\" (from Mano's first album). The show will begin streaming on internet on January 26 and will be broadcasted on BS-TBS on February 27.\n\nShe also was in a new drama called DEATH GAME PARK.\n\nOn July 1, 2010, Mano made her US debut in Los Angeles. Kai-Ki: Tales of Terror from Tokyo, a Japanese horror film in which she starred, had its world premiere at Club Nokia. Mano also had a short mini concert, a mini Q and A and an autograph session for the fans who attended the event.\n\n2011\n\nIn 2011, Mano Erina's radio show, \"Mano-Deli\", was replaced by Morning Musume 9th gen member Sayashi Riho's \"Riho-Deli\" Also in 2011, It was announced that Mano would star in a short film called \"Miyuki's Wind Bell\".\n\nIn 2011 Mano Erina had her another solo concert named, Mano Erina’s Concert Tour 2011〜Hatachi no Otome 801DAYS.\n\nIn July Mano Erina made a public appearance at South Korea to attend the Puchon International Fantastic Film which would film her movie.\n\nActivities outside Japan\n\nIn July 2010, Mano Erina had her first appearance outside of Japan.
