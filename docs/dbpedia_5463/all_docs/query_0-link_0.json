I thought they sent them out already for some reason, they sent it to me and asked me who else to send it too. Strange.\n\nYeah, it's odd because I know people definitely have it haha. I'm assuming it'll get sent out soon, especially with it being released in only a couple weeks anyway\n\nHonestly now having a studio version this might be in my top 5 for this band. Easily top 10. Gimmie a year with the studio version and I might even put it top 3.\n\nThe EP was fun. Direction has held up as a really important album for me. The idea of new music from them is really exciting. I'm looking forward to hearing what TSL sounds like in 2016.\n\nIM GRILLED BY A SPOT LIGHTTTT.\n\nNeed them to play that song live soon. They haven't played it in a long while.\n\nI actually disagree. I do love Luck, but I really really enjoy Anyways too. Quitter is the one song I could do without.\n\nThat's their one album I haven't really checked out at all (besides Island). I'll get on that soon"
