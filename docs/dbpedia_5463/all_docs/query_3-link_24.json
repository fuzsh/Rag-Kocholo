        "text": "A malaise teetering on despair and fear that we may be careening toward violence: the mood of America in the year 2024.\n\nWith perhaps the most fateful presidential election in at least two generations in America plunging into dark and swirling waters of uncertainty; with two wars raging with no end in sight in Ukraine and Gaza; with front page news like today’s New York Times about a well-to-do Long Island suburb training what looks like a militia; and with an economy that continues to do well for Wall Street but leaves just about everyone not presiding over a stock portfolio feeling broke and anxious – it should come as no surprise that punk rock is having something of a resurgence.\n\nI came of age in the late 1970s at the height of punk with The Clash, The Ramones and the Sex Pistols blaring in basement speakers over scratchy vinyl. By the time the beautifully rogue Celtic punk band, The Pogues, came on the scene in the mid-1980s, when I was reporting for the New York Daily News, they had my full attention with “Fairytale of New York.”\n\nBut I have to be clear that I was never anything close to a punk rocker. That said, I definitely understood the rage and felt the best of these bands were right on the money for the time we lived in. And so it is no surprise to me that punk rock is finding a way back with bands like Rancid, Bombpops and Get Dead all releasing new albums. The 1990s pop punk band Green Day also has a new studio album out this year titled “Saviors” that has been praised by the New Yorker as “amazingly relevant” and even top-of-the-charts artist Olivia Rodrigo is seeing her pop-punk version of “get him back!” surging.\n\nSo what is going on? I think it is safe to say that the expression of rage and anxiety that punk has always captured is profoundly needed these days. Drive through America in once strong economic engines like Youngstown, Ohio, and faded upstate New York factory towns and all through the Rust Belt and you can feel this theme coursing through the music people are listening to, from the new albums that are out, in the old vinyl that might be pulling out of their collection or through searches on Spotify.\n\nBut why am I writing about a resurgence of punk and this genre’s relevance today?\n\nThe answer comes as a question: how is the tribe of American journalism doing in exploring these themes? How close are we getting to what we might call the ‘ground truth’ of the lives of people in this era of anxiety and loathing? Honestly, I do not see enough reporting that takes us there in a way that feels up close and personal and truthful.\n\nThat is why this week we are highlighting the work of KT Kanazawich, a photographer who was a Report for America corps member in 2020-2022 at Flint Beat in Flint, Michigan. There, she helped the newsroom find its voice visually when it was in its earliest years. Kanazawich is now working as a freelancer and curating her body of work, which explores the kind of proximity that is required to understand these times we live in.\n\nGroundTruth’s Director of Photography, Ben Brody, has followed Kanazawich’s work closely, particularly a personal project where she has documented the local punk and hardcore scene in her native Binghamton, NY for the last 15 years, and offered some mentoring along the way as she has been pulling together her work and finding a theme that runs through the images.\n\nAs Brody writes in his latest column for GroundTruth, “For readers who would never find themselves in a basement hardcore show in the Rust Belt, KTs pictures provide generous points of entry. Far more than pictures of musicians performing in extremis through sound and fury, KT deftly photographs broader indicators of culture, particularly relationships. Her pictures articulate the fine line between infatuation and disgust that defines so many young romances.\n\nThe music itself serves as connective tissue bridging layers of documentation: Rust Belt Americana, communities growing and changing, relationships between men and women, and an undercurrent of violence that is partly performative and partly real. KT’s images make subtle connections but never stray from the essential energies of the punk movement.”\n\nThe first photograph in the collection of a young man writhing on the floor in a basement punk show in Binghamton is a testament to her commitment to the long arc of her work and the image—with the young man writhing on the concrete floor and winding up in a fetal position—seems a perfectly rational reaction to the times we live in. Hang in there."
