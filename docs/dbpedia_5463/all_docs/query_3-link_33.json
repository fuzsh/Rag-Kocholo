Music plays important roles in religious contexts: Among other things, it connects worshippers to spiritual realms; centers practitioners within continuous traditions; distinguishes between sacred and secular spaces (and places); enables communal cohesion; facilitates transcendent experiences; imbues everyday activities with religious intent; orients believers to ritual practices; and contributes to religious identities, both at the individual and at the collective (or congregational) levels.
