        "text": "Among the many gripping moments in the video for Good Charlotte's recent single \"Hold On,\" the most gripping of all may well be a close-up shot of an/sordinary-looking middle-aged man -- not a band member or an actor but Bob Burt, a high school coach who lost his 19-year-old daughter to suicide. \"It's not the right order of things,\" he says, his face creasing in grief. \"You're not supposed to bury your children, they're supposed to bury you.\"\n\nThe \"Hold On\" video is an avowed attempt by this double-platinum pop-punk band to talk suicidal kids back from the brink. \"Hold on if you feel like letting go/ Hold on, it gets better than you know,\" the singer Joel Madden keens as the black-clad, heavily tattooed band plays in a dilapidated little house whose walls are scrawled with words like \"fear,\" \"lonely\" and \"pain.\" The music breaks for a series of other heart-/srending sound bites from friends and relatives of those who have committed suicide.\n\nMade in conjunction with several suicide prevention organizations, the video closes as a tearful young woman, her voice breaking, says: \"It's OK to get help. You're going to miss out on so much.\" A black screen lists hot line phone numbers and the Web address of the American Federation for Suicide Prevention.\n\n\"It's almost like a public service announcement,\" Madden recently told MTV.com. If so, it's a hugely popular one: \"Hold On\" is a big hit on MTV, played heavily and featured on the channel's \"Total Request Live,\" which showcases viewers' favorite videos. (It's not the only song on Good Charlotte's latest album, \"Young and the Hopeless,\" that addresses suicide; another is called \"Day That I Die.\")\n\n\"Hold On\" is a perfect specimen of a new strain of teenage-oriented music -- call it therapy rock -- that uses the language of punk music to address, and sometimes even attempt to assuage, many adolescents' powerful feelings of alienation and despair. Of course rock has long addressed itself to the emotionally wounded teenager. What's new is this genre's astonishing frankness, its wide popularity and its active, earnest attempt to lend troubled fans a helping hand.\n\nMusicians from a few different/spunk-related genres are exploring therapy rock: the up-and-coming \"emo\" genre, which features hyperdramatic, almost mawkish rock delving deeply into personal upheaval; rap-metal, an aggressive hybrid that has lately turned more introspective; and pop-punk, a slick version of punk that's deceptively up-tempo and not generally noted for its profundity. But it is bands in the last category -- like the hugely popular Good Charlotte, Sum 41 and Blink-182 -- whose songs most often amount to vivid case studies in adolescent mental health issues. The group A Simple Plan, who are also receiving heavy play on MTV, might have expressed pop-punk's attitude most directly: \"I'm just a kid/ And life is a nightmare.\"\n\nConsider Blink-182. With more than 10 million albums sold, it's one of the biggest bands in the country. Its new self-titled release is punctuated by evocations of depression like \"I'm so lost, I'm barely here/ I wish I could explain myself but words escape me/ It's too late to save me.\"\n\n\"Adam's Song,\" from Blink-182's previous album, was based on a fan's suicide note; it profiled a character struggling to overcome hopeless thoughts. (Unlike the real-life inspiration, the song's protagonist survives his crisis.)\n\nWith their messages of care and support, these bands give the lie to the hoary stereotype of the nihilistic punk rocker. And not only do some of them make videos that are specifically designed to serve a public health function; they've found other novel ways to guide their fans through emotional troubles.\n\nThe annual Take Action Tour, mostly featuring punk-derived \"screamo\" bands, raises depression and suicide awareness and benefits the National Hopeline Network (which oversees the anti-suicide hot line 800-784-2433). This summer the network sent a gleaming new semi full of information on the popular Warped Tour, which featured Rancid, the Used and AFI among many major acts. (The benefit album \"Take Action, Volume 3\" includes multimedia content based on \"Suicide: The Forever Decision,\" a book by Dr. Paul Quinnett, as well as a self-test for depression.)\n\nSome songs in this genre are downright prescriptive, counseling kids to be patient and tenacious through the lonely, bewildering years of adolescence. (Many other tracks merely depict depression, in hopes that teenagers might at least find comfort in knowing someone else understands what they're going through).\n\nIn \"Hang On\" (not to be confused with Good Charlotte's \"Hold On\") the pop-punk band Smashmouth exhorts, \"Things are gettin' weird/ Things are gettin' tough/ Nothing's makin' sense/ But you keep on lookin' up.\" Virtually every song on the bad-boy pop-punks Sum 41's hit record \"Does This Look Infected?\" is about profound alienation, depression or imminent emotional breakdown, but on \"Hell Song\" the band urges listeners to look for solutions, instead of wallowing in despair: \"Everybody's got their problems/ It's just a matter how you solve them/ And knowing how to change the things you've been through.\"\n\nOther songs recommend solidarity: \"I was confused/ And I let it all out to find/ that I'm not the only person with these things in mind,\" Linkin Park's Chester Bennington sings on the band's hit single \"Somewhere I Belong.\"\n\nIn 1967 the Beatles sang \"Getting Better All the Time,\" whose lyrics now read like a gentler version of the prototypical therapy rock song. (Sure enough, Smashmouth covers the song on \"The Cat in the Hat\" soundtrack.) Four years later the Who famously sang, \"Don't cry, don't raise your eye/ It's only teenage wasteland\" on the classic rock staple \"Baba O'Riley.\" Heavy metal and industrial rock have profiled psychological imbalance for decades, and many current bands worship the '80s mope-rockers the Cure. (Robert Smith of the Cure even sings a tune on the new Blink-182 album.)\n\nBut therapy rock has its most direct roots in the genesis of American punk rock, a movement founded by a tiny coterie of troubled misfits and outcasts. The pioneering Southern California punk band Black Flag's landmark 1978 debut EP was called \"Nervous Breakdown\" and themes of insanity, alienation and depression have been a hallmark of punk lyrics ever since.\n\nThe first stirrings of therapy rock's introduction to a mass audience came in the early '90s, when alternative rock, inspired by punk music and led by Nirvana, apotheosized a generation of disaffected and confused latchkey kids. \"Lots of music now comes from Nirvana, and a lot of people identify with what Kurt Cobain was saying,\" said William, 16, of New York City. In what many interpreted as the defining event of a generation, Cobain killed himself with a shotgun blast in April 1994.\n\nThe tuneful punk revivalists Green Day picked up the ball of teen angst in the mid '90s, and thereafter various pop-punk bands ran with it all the way to commercial glory. American youth welcomed songs about the emotional difficulties of being a teenager. The audience for therapy rock was always there, it was just waiting for punk rock's popularity to catch up with it.\n\nSince commercial success and punk credibility are virtually antithetical, the new pop-punk bands embrace themes of emotional distress as a way of asserting their authenticity and musical lineage. (They cleave to punk orthodoxy musically as well, having progressed remarkably little from early Southern California punk bands like the Descendents and Bad Religion.)\n\nAs a result therapy rockers fetishize depression like gangsta rappers fetishize the thug life, publicizing their plight while asserting their credibility. Just as the group Public Enemy once called rap the \"CNN of the streets,\" therapy rock claims to report from the front lines of suburbia. In other words, it's cool to be bummed out. And it sure sells records."
