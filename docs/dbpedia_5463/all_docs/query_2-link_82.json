        "text": "WORK, LEARN, PLAY, AND GROW\n\nWe need you! Get paid to accomplish needed conservation work on public lands. Work on historic structures, restore native species, disappearing trails, and the eradication of invasive species.\n\nThe application period is open for the 2024 YCC Season! The list of participating parks will continue to be added over the next few months. In the meantime, you can view a list of 2024 participating parks and consider applying.\n\nWhat is the Youth Conservation Corps?\n\nThe United States Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) is a youth employment program that engages young people in meaningful work experiences at national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and fish hatcheries while developing an ethic of environmental stewardship and civic responsibility. YCC programs are generally 8 to 10 weeks and members are paid at least the state or federal minimum wage (whichever is higher) for a 40-hour work week. YCC opportunities provide paid daytime work activities with members who commute to the Federal unit daily.\n\nPlease note, Yellowstone National Park is the only residential program. All other YCC programs are non-residential programs, which means that no housing is available at the site, and participants must independently provide their own transportation to the site each day. If you have questions about eligibility, please visit the park's webpage to contact them directly before completing the application.\n\nWho is eligible?\n\nYouth, 15 through 18 years of age, who are permanent residents of the United States, are eligible for employment without regard to social, economic, racial, or ethnic backgrounds. Youth with physical or other challenges who can effectively participate in most YCC activities are eligible. Youth must have no history of serious criminal or other antisocial behavior that might endanger their safety or that of others; have or be able to obtain a work permit as required under the laws of their State; have a Social Security number or have made application of one. Please note, the Youth Conservation Corps is a local program, so participants need to be able to commute to and from the site daily. Transportation to the site will generally not be available.\n\nWhat would I do?\n\nYouth Conservation Corps members work in a healthful outdoor setting on a variety of projects including building trails, maintaining fences, cleaning up campgrounds, improving wildlife habitat, environmental education planning and teaching, stream restoration, historic building preservation, and more! You'll also participate in educational field trips where chances are you'll see wildlife or history before your eyes, hike and stand on a mountaintop, or gaze at an ancient ruin.\n\nHow do I find an opportunity?\n\nLooking for a Youth Conservation Corps program in a national park near you? Check out our list of opportunities for 2024, or find a federal site near you and inquire if they have a YCC program or other opportunities. Other locations include:\n\nU.S. Forest Service\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service:\n\nNational Fish Hatchery System\n\nNational Wildlife Refuge System\n\nWhat benefits would I get from participating?\n\nNot only would you get paid to work in some of the coolest places in the country, but you will also have the chance to learn about careers with the National Park Service and gain valuable work skills that can help you get your next job! You will be working with other incredible people and hopefully you will build a lifetime bond. If you like to hike, backpack, climb, kayak, bike, horseback ride, etc national parks are perfect for that!\n\nHow do I apply?"
