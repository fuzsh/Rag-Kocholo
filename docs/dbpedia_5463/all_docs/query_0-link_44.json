        "text": "Pop punk died in 2009. “But The Wonder Ye—” Stop. It died. It lives on in the underground, as music always does, but 2009 was the death knell of mainstream pop punk. Emo had been chipping away at it for years, its main practitioners had imploded, eroded, or evolved away, and “Scene,” the most generic name for a scene, had arrived. And that’s where I draw the line between Millennials and Generation Y.\n\nI hate being called a Millennial. I was born in 1988. I remember when Generation X was a buzzword (and, thanks to Pepsi, Generation NeXt). For a short time, I was part of something called Generation Y (it comes after X, you see). I remember only having three channels (3, 46, and 55 at home; 9, 36, and 55 at my grandparents’ across the street, and 18, 46, and 55 at my grandparents’ in the next county). I remember people freaking out about Y2K. I remember seeing 9/11 unfold on TV in middle school. I remember payphones being common; I’ve even used them! And I’m now called a Millennial because people insist on named generations spanning two or three decades, but I don’t care where Wikipedia redirects Generation Y to, the experiences I just listed mean I am very explicitly NOT a Millennial.\n\nReal Millennials were born when That 70s Show was causing everyone to abandon gelled, frosted hair for less douchey but stupider-looking mops. They went to preschool during a different Gulf War, and don’t remember a life before Terrorism. They had smartphones in elementary school, while I got my first flip phone in high school. Many are younger than SpongeBob (first aired May 1, 1999). And virtually none of them ever went to the library to use the internet to hunt down Pokémon cheats on Yahooligans. They grew up with in-home internet, and it probably wasn’t dial-up.\n\nAlso, their music is weird. Not bad, any more than everything else, just markedly different from what preceded it, particularly in lyrical themes. Astute readers will rightfully suspect this is where the pop punk bit comes in. See, in my formative years, pop punk was more than a fad. It was a force of nature.\n\nPop punk spoke to the heart of Gen Y from the late 90s to mid 00s. Mostly, it spoke about failed romances and not fitting in. It had an often-immature sense of humor that came across as an attempt to mask some pretty serious insecurity. It lashed out at everyone who’d ever wronged it, from bullies to parents to exes—but despite the vitriol, those attacks felt like the ineffectual thrashing of someone with no other outlet; there was a helplessness beneath it all.\n\nThen, right around 2005, give or take six months, things started to change. I call it the Great Maturening, because “more mature” was the only way anyone could come up with to describe the multitude of new releases from Blink-182 (Blink-182), Good Charlotte (The Chronicles of Life and Death), Green Day (American Idiot), Simple Plan (Still Not Getting Any), Sum 41 (Chuck), and many, many others that all dropped at that time. As to the cause, I’m not sure. Bands change and evolve, but it was weird to see so many hit that point at once, regardless of where they were in their careers (Blink was on their fifth album and Green Day their seventh, while Simple Plan and Sum 41 were only on their second and third, respectively). Maybe it had something to do with war weariness: most of those bands’ pre-Maturening releases came shortly after 9/11, before the interminability of the War on Terror had set in and their audience was still mostly too young to care about it.\n\nRegardless of the cause, the Great Maturening of pop punk was indicative of a shift in the greater alt rock landscape, as indie and emo bands, some of which had been active outside the mainstream for years, began to rise to prominence. Bands like Brand New, Death Cab for Cutie, and Taking Back Sunday brought an emotional vulnerability and honesty to the fore, smoothing much of the rough edges of pop punk along the way. While the subject matter was largely the same as it had always been in pop punk—that is, romance and a lack of belonging—this new movement lacked the posturing that pop punk bands hid their confessions behind. Meanwhile, bands sonically closer to pop punk, like My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy, demonstrated that this new emotionalism wasn’t confined to a particular “sound” of band. In a way, it was the last gasp of Gen Yism: “We…we tried. And now it’s over. Good night, and good luck.”\n\nThen, several things happened, some of which had been brewing for half a decade or more. Metalcore exploded, exposing more mainstream listeners to a new level of aggression during a time when aggression was notably absent from emo/indie-flooded airwaves (and giving millions of people an excuse to misuse the word “screamo”). The music end of Myspace took off, and YouTube followed shortly after, injecting a wealth of previously obscure sounds into a sea of angry-criers. The Great Recession set in. The Gen Y kids that had fueled the pop punk of the late 90s and early 00s graduated and went to college, or tried desperately to join a hostile workforce. The younger half of the generation, the real Millennials, saw all this and responded with a collective “lolwut?” Then things got weird.\n\nThe Hot Topic demographic plowed into the passing fruit cart of Myspace bands. Near-death growls took up residence beside saccharine, autotuned vocals over dubstep-influenced instrumentals. Black band shirts were replaced with neon highlighter combinations not seen since the early nineties. Band names stretched into grammatically questionable sentences. Lyrics were offensive for no apparent reason (they didn’t seem to be mad about anything and any humor that was there was of the “random” variety) and often made little sense, as did song titles—but not in an avant garde, prog rock way, more like they were born of inside jokes the rest of us weren’t privy to. People went into the pit at concerts not to bounce around and have fun, but to start fights by flailing around like a bugsprayed grasshopper. If the movement had a goal, it was to alienate everyone who wasn’t into it, much like metal decades before. But unlike metal, it didn’t seem to be a reaction to anything so much as it was the result of kids getting together and saying, “You know what would be funny….” Parents didn’t like it, as they never do, pop fans dabbled in it for street cred, as they do, and the Gen Y pop punk old guard largely despised it for being an abrasive, unlistenable slap in the face of the sincerity they’d worked so hard to express. The scene had become Scene.\n\nThen something unexpected happened. While those of us in our twenties lamented the kids these days and complained about how much Warped sucks this year, Millennials still mostly in their teens had their own Great Maturening. The music calmed down, or at least gained focus. But this time around, things were different. The First Great Maturening came on the back of a pop punk environment that had embraced isolation even as it lamented it. We were all outcasts, even together, and our Maturening let us come to terms with that. The world was falling apart around us just as our personal lives were in shambles. We’d given it our all and failed. Even if it didn’t apply to everyone, we all appreciated the sentiment.\n\nThe Second Great Maturening didn’t have that baggage. Scene came along as the Great Recession was ending. The Millennial fans were young enough not to have career worries weighing them down. They had their angsts, but mostly they seemed to look at the wreckage of Gen Y in pity and resolve not to go down that road. A new pop punk began to take shape, with a sound partly Scene and partly Gen Y nostalgia. But this time around, the message was less “life sucks and nobody understands” and more “life can suck, but you’ll be okay, buddy.” Platonic friendship became a major theme on par with or even surpassing romance. Many of the sentiments were the same—this town sucks, parents don’t get me—but the tone was different: where Gen Y had impotent rage and eventually resignation, Millennials tried their best to be reassuring at every turn.\n\nI don’t know how apparent the difference is from the outside looking in, but for those of us who lived it, the thematic divide between pre- and post-Scene pop punk is the same line that divides Gen Y—the older half of what Old People call Millennials—from the real Millennials. Gen Y’s Millennial Entitlement comes from wanting things to go right for just once. After all, we spent our formative years getting rejected by crushes, coming to terms with how much the world seemed to oppose us, and taking comfort in the fact that, surely, things would get better after high school, only to have the economy itself kick us right in the teeth when we crossed that threshold.\n\nPost-Scene Millennial Entitlement has different roots. They never knew better than what Gen Y had at their worst; they started already in the pit without experiencing the trauma of how Gen Y got there, letting them avoid the disillusion that smacked Gen Y so hard. They were optimistic, and it worked (strength of causal link irrelevant). The economy got better, great strides were made for inclusiveness, social justice, and generally not being a dick. Being a friend was more effective than self-martyrdom.\n\nSo what’s next? Will Gen Y and real Millennials finally coalesce into the one big demographic everybody but ourselves has always lumped us into as the younger ones catch up and our experiences begin to merge? Was the divide never as sharp as I imagine, and nothing will change because it wasn’t that different to begin with? Will another downturn in the universe violently disillusion younger Millennials so hard that they give up on their optimism, leaving Gen Y to shake our heads and mumble something about how we always knew it would end this way? Will Blink-182 ever make another good album? How should I know, I’m one of those Gen Y grognards still stuck in the bottom of the hole. But if those damn kids have taught me anything, it’s that we’ve gotta look out for each other if we’re going to climb out.\n\nAnyway, here’s a song:"
