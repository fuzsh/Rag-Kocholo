        "text": "polyphony, in music, the simultaneous combination of two or more tones or melodic lines (the term derives from the Greek word for “many sounds”). Thus, even a single interval made up of two simultaneous tones or a chord of three simultaneous tones is rudimentarily polyphonic. Usually, however, polyphony is associated with counterpoint, the combination of distinct melodic lines.\n\nIn polyphonic music, two or more simultaneous melodic lines are perceived as independent even though they are related. In Western music, polyphony typically includes a contrapuntal separation of melody and bass. A texture is more purely polyphonic, and thus more contrapuntal, when the musical lines are rhythmically differentiated. A subcategory of polyphony, called homophony, exists in its purest form when all the voices or parts move together in the same rhythm, as in a texture of block chords. These terms are by no means mutually exclusive, and composers from the 16th through the 21st century have commonly varied textures from complex polyphony to rhythmically uniform homophony, even within the same piece.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nSound Check: Musical Vocabulary Quiz"
