        "text": "(updated 6/18/24)\n\nRULE UPDATES\n\nHere are some important updates for the Savage Race PRO heat that affect you, if you are signed up for SavagePRO.\n\nNew for 2024: Runners have two hours to complete the course to be eligible for awards. If males start at 8 am, they must complete the race by 10 am. If the female race starts at 8:15 am, they must complete the race by 10:15 am.\n\nObstacle completion is required for all podium spots including age group awards. Podium spots will NOT be filled by athletes who do not complete 100% of the obstacles.\n\nThere will be two pro start times starting at 8am for males and 8:15am for females.\n\nAll pro runners must start in their respective start time to be eligible for any award.\n\nBesides top overall finishers, your finish time and placement will be determined by chip time. We will do our best to group age groups together, but in some cases this might be not possible. It’s possible that someone who starts after you and finishes after you could have a better race time, and beat you.\n\nOnce the race results have been finalized, the overall and age group awards ceremony will be held on the main stage. You must pick up your award at the event; they will not be mailed post-race.\n\nThe cutoff time for award eligibility will be 2 hours after respective starting times.\n\nAll other standard pro rules in the “General Rules” section below apply to this event.\n\nBoth the course and obstacles are NOT available for preview or practice prior to the race.\n\nIn order to qualify for podium spots and awards, SavagePRO runners must complete 100% of the obstacles, finish the race with their velcro SavagePRO band, and complete the race by the cut-off time of 2 hours after respective starting times. This includes overall, age group, and team awards.\n\nFor teams, only those members who complete 100% of the obstacles will have their race times count toward team awards. The fastest three members who complete 100% of the obstacles will have their times count toward award-status.\n\nGENERAL RULES\n\nOverall – Athletes must complete all obstacles as specified in the SavagePRO Rules in order to be eligible for awards and cash prizes, which are awarded to the Top 3 Male and Top 3 Female athletes competing in the SavagePRO heat. Cash prizes are only available at Point Series events.\n\nRule Changes – For safety or logistical reasons, Savage Race management may change/alter the rules for an obstacle at any time. If a race official or obstacle attendee instructs you to do something that is contrary to the written rules of an obstacle, follow their verbal instructions. Should you disregard verbal instructions from race officials or obstacle attendees, you will be reported to Savage Race management who will then rule on the matter.\n\nCourse Previews – Both the course and obstacles are NOT available for preview or practice prior to the race.\n\nAttempts – Obstacles may be attempted an unlimited number of times. (There are no workout alternatives.) If you are unable to complete an obstacle on your first attempt, you may use any lane to try the obstacle again, however, you must go to the end of the line if people are waiting for the lane you want. If there is an open lane that nobody is waiting for, you may restart immediately. This is to avoid impeding athletes behind you who are attempting an obstacle for the first time.\n\nTo be eligible for an age group podium, racers must give an honest “good faith” attempt at each obstacle. Any obstacle directly bypassed without solid attempt will be grounds for disqualification from age group medals.\n\n***Race etiquette – Age group racers should let potential Overall (Top 3 Male/Female) finishers have immediate access to an obstacle without waiting. (Example: Top 3 men are already across finish line, on-course men are to give way to all females at obstacles so as to not impede their progress, until top 3 females are finished)\n\nTime Limit – To be eligible for awards and cash prizes (Point Series only), SavagePRO athletes MUST cross the finish line before 2 hours after respective start times.\n\nSavagePRO Velcro Timing Straps and Fail Pail – SavagePRO runners will now be issued TWO bands and timing chips. One standard band with timing chip, and one Velcro band with timing chip. The Velcro chip is used to give instant finisher results upon crossing the finish line. SavagePRO runners will no longer need to wait to find out their placement on the 100% completion rankings. As long as a runner crosses the finish line with both chips, the system will automatically place the runner into the correct 100% completion rankings. A SavagePRO runner who failed one or more obstacles and surrendered their Velcro timing chip on course, will automatically be grouped into the Pro Award Non-Eligible group.\n\nThe fail pail is a 5 gallon bucket placed at each difficult obstacle that a SavagePRO runner may fail. Along with the bucket there will be a feather flag to increase awareness of the bucket’s location. If a SavagePRO runner fails to complete an obstacle after many attempts, they must surrender their Velcro band and place the band in the Fail Pail. Timing chips are very costly, therefore, the goal of the bucket and feather flag is to collect all surrendered bands. The bucket will always be in a highly visible location on the exit side of an obstacle. If the runner cannot find the bucket and flag, they should hand the Velcro band to the volunteer or medic stationed at the obstacle.\n\nAssistance – No physical assistance is allowed at any time during the race. Do not help another athlete with any obstacles. If assistance is provided or received, this will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nBib/Bib Number – SavagePRO athletes MUST display either their bib or bib number prominently on their person at all times during the race. If you don’t like to wear a bib, write your bib number where it can easily be seen by Savage Race staff out on the course: arm, head, back, etc.\n\nCourse – Athletes must follow ALL course markings. If you become lost, please return to the last known “on course” location. If you cannot find your way back, find a member of the Savage Race team and they will assist you. Savage Race Management will have decision-making authority if any issues arise with completing the course as intended.\n\nObstacles – If you do not understand how to complete an obstacle, please ask a race official or obstacle attendee and then follow instructions as specified.\n\nFair Play – You may not intentionally impede the progression of another competitor. This behavior may result in obstacle non-completion and the loss of your SavagePRO wristband.\n\nChecking Your Results – SavagePRO results will be broken down into two categories: one for those who successfully completed all obstacles and kept their Velcro wristband and finished before the cutoff time, and the other for those who did not successfully complete all obstacles and lost their Velcro wristband and/or did not finish before the cutoff time.\n\nCategory 1 (eligible for cash prizes*/awards)\n\n1 – SavagePRO Male – 100% Completion\n\n1 – SavagePRO Female – 100% Completion\n\nCategory 2 (not eligible for cash prizes*/awards** )\n\n2 – SavagePRO Male – Non Complete or Time Cutoff\n\n2 – SavagePRO Female – Non Complete or Time Cutoff\n\n*Cash prizes are only awarded at PRO Series events.\n\n**See Age Group Awards (below) for the exception to this rule.\n\nAge Group Awards – Athletes must complete all obstacles as they are intended prior to the 2 hour cutoff time in order to be eligible for Top 3 Male & Top 3 Female age group awards. Obstacles can be attempted as many times as needed. There are no workout alternatives. Athletes MUST be present at the awards ceremony to receive cash prizes (top 3 male/female only) or age group awards. We will not mail prizes/awards out after the race. Checks are given out on race day. Cash prize winners will be required to complete a W-9 before they’re given their check. See age groups here.\n\n…..\n\nMasters Division – The SavagePRO Masters Division is an overall award category for athletes age 40+. All SavagePRO athletes age 40+ are automatically eligible for Masters Division overall awards. The top three males and top three females in the 40+ age group will receive Masters Division 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place overall awards. There are no cash prizes for Masters Division overall award winners. Athletes can only win one award. If a Masters athlete places 1st, 2nd, or 3rd overall (out of all SavagePRO athletes, not just age 40+), they will receive their overall award and cash prize (Point Series only) but will not receive a Masters Division overall award or an age group award too. All other SavagePRO rules, including mandatory obstacle completion, still apply.\n\nTeam Awards – The Top 3 Teams in the SavagePRO heat are awarded medals. Each team’s score is calculated by adding up the three fastest finish times by that team’s members who also complete 100% of the obstacles and finish by the 2 hour cut-off time. Those three individuals are given medals. Athletes MUST be present at the awards ceremony to receive their medals. We will not mail prizes/awards out after the race.\n\nShoes — Absolutely no shoes with metal spikes or cleats. Immediate disqualification for anyone caught wearing metal spikes or cleats. Participants must finish the race with the shoes they started the race with. If a participant removes their shoes to complete an obstacle, they must bring the shoes with them for the rest of the race, whether by carrying or putting them back on. A racer may set their shoes to the side, complete an obstacle, and then return to pick up their shoes.\n\nEquipment — Absolutely no shoes with metal spikes or cleats. Immediate disqualification for anyone caught wearing metal spikes or cleats. Participants must complete every obstacle with all of the equipment they started with (shirt, shoes, gloves or mittens, chalk, hat, etc…)\n\nOBSTACLE GUIDELINES\n\nNote: All obstacles MUST be completed in the manner in which they are designed to be completed. Using alternative methods to complete an obstacle will result in either a required additional attempt using the correct method to complete the obstacle OR forfeiting your SavagePRO Velcro wristband due to obstacle non-completion. (For example, you MAY NOT use the support braces on The Great Wall to help yourself climb over.) This goes for any obstacle. If you are unsure how to complete an obstacle, ask the volunteer or staff member at that obstacle.\n\nBoth the course and obstacles are not available for preview or practice prior to the race.\n\nNew for 2024\n\nVoulez Vous Lache – NEW OBSTACLE – Racers must start with both hands on first bar and lache their way across obstacle to make contact with the bell before hitting the ground. Bells can be hit with any part of the body.\n\nBruiser – NEW OBSTACLE – Racers must traverse their way across the obstacle using the suspended rope. Feet must be off the ground before racers hands pass the marker Racers may not use the truss to assist in complete the obstacle and hit the bell before touching the ground.\n\nGORUCK Jerry Can Carry – NEW OBSTACLE Racer must carry one GORUCK Jerry Can from the pallet they are on, go around the loop, and place that Jerry Can back on the pallet after completing the loop.\n\nPremier Obstacles\n\nAnchors Aweigh –Before stepping up onto the starting bar, participant shall grab two (2) gymnast rings out of the blue barrel on either side of the structure. Using the two rings, participants will swing from anchor to anchor, using the ring to hook onto the anchor. Participants hands may only hold onto the rings for the entire obstacle. Participants can not touch the anchors or aluminum structure. Participants must cross this obstacle without their feet ever touching the ground. The obstacle is considered complete when participants ring the bell AND then return BOTH rings to the container from which they pulled the rings. Participants may touch the bell with their hand, the ring, or any body part including their feet. If both rings do not get returned to the container the obstacle is not complete and the participant must do what is needed to return the rings to the containers. Once the bell is rung, the participant will not be required to re-complete the obstacle, but will be disqualified if they do not return the rings to the containers. Participants shall not hand the rings off to another participant, nor shall they receive the rings from another participant. Rings must be retrieved and returned into the blue barrel. If a participant falls off the obstacle, but a ring is left hanging on the obstacle, they can only retry the obstacle with the same two rings they started with.\n\nBack Scratcher – Athletes must go over the walls and underneath the bottom section of barbed wire. Athletes may not use wall legs to boost themselves over walls. Going over any part of the barbed wire or using the wall legs for assistance will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nBarn Door – Athletes must climb over the top of the fence walls. Climbing around the side of any wall will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nBig Ass Cargo Net – Athletes must climb up the cargo net on the designated entrance side of the obstacle, and then down on the opposing side of the obstacle. Participants may not grab, hold onto, or climb, on the vertical running truss pieces in the middle, or side, of the structure. Touching the horizontal running truss pieces is OK.\n\nBig Cheese – Climb the wall using the holes, and down the ladder. Do not climb on the support structure.\n\nBlock Party – Athletes must pull their designated cinder block from behind the pulling line. Crossing the line will result in obstacle failure. Once the block has touched the wood base by the athletes’ feet, the athlete must pick up the cinder block and carry it back to its original position for the next athlete. Failure to do so will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nChutes and Ladders – Participants must start on start pipe, pull ropes attached to rings and use the ring to slide down the first pipe, climb ladder to second ring and slide down the second pipe to hit the bell before touching the ground. Racers may not use truss or attachments to aid their completion.\n\nClotheslines – Crouch underneath the wires and continue on course.\n\nColossus – Athletes must run up the ramp to get over the quarter pipe and on to the platform. Athletes may (but do not have to) use the rope to climb up onto the platform. Once on top of the quarter pipe, athletes must use the ladders to climb up to the top platform before going down the water slide. Athletes then must wait for the go ahead from the medical staff or Savage Race personnel before going down the slide. Athletes must exit the pool at the bottom of the slide at the opposite end from where the slide enters the pool. Exiting the sides of the pool will result in obstacle non-completion. As a reminder, any assistance given to or received from other athletes on this or any other obstacle may result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nGibbon Take – Racers must use one ring and one dowel to traverse the accessories, starting on the start pipe, to hit the bell before touching the ground. Then racers must return ring and dowel to bucket at the start of obstacle.\n\nKiss My Walls – Athletes must use only the handholds and footholds provided. Use of the top ledge of the wall is prohibited and will result in obstacle non-completion. Before stepping down from the footholds, ring the bell to signal completion of the obstacle. Touching the ground before ringing the bell will also result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nLow Crawl – Athletes must stay under the barbed wire for the entirety of the obstacle. Failure to do so will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nLumberjack Lane – Athletes must carry at least one block of wood around the designated course area and place the wood back in its original resting place. Failure to do so will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nMega – Athlete must run up the ramp to get on top of the platform. Use of ropes attached to the top is optional. Athlete will then use the descending cargo net to exit the obstacle.\n\nMe So Thorny – Athletes must maneuver under and between the barbed wire in one of the designated lines. Failure to do so will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nMud N’ Guts – Athletes must remain below the barbed wire and within the outer boundaries of the obstacle. Failure to do so will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nMud Walls – Athletes must use designated lanes and be submerged in the mud. Climb over each wall in the designated lanes. Failure to do so will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nMystery obstacle – Athletes must scale the obstacle alone. Athletes are not allowed assistance from anyone.\n\nNutt Smasher – Athletes must cross this obstacle using only one beam at a time. Racers may change beams but not touch two at one time. Hands may be used on the beam. However, if any part of an athlete’s body touches the pool of water, this results in obstacle non-completion.\n\nPedal for the Medal – Runners must use only their feet to turn the spools, winding the rope until the tire touches the “finish rope.” Once the tire touches the finish rope on the ground, the runner should pick up the tire and return the tire to the starting area beyond the traffic cone line. If anything but your feet or legs touch the spool, you have failed the obstacle and must return the tire to area beyond the traffic cone line, then repeat the obstacle after waiting in any line. If a runner drops the tire before the starting area identified by the traffic cone line, they may pick the tire back up, and drop it in the correct area.\n\nPiece of Queso – Participants must begin from the starter bar and cannot touch the ground until they’ve rung the bell at the finish end. Participants may grab onto the top of the walls but must NOT hold the chains at the top of the walls. Any participant who touches the ground with any body part, or fails the obstacle in any way, must start the obstacle over from the beginning.\n\nPrairie Dog – Athletes must crawl under the roof of the obstacle and remain in their designated lane. Failure to do so will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nRamp Wall – Climb over the wall without using support legs.\n\nRhythm Race – Racers must use blocks, starting outside the white line, to travel down lane, around a fixed point, then back down the lane, and across the white line. No forward progress is permitted if racers fall off the blocks.\n\nRig over Water– Participants must cross this obstacle without falling into the water. Feet may NOT be used to traverse rings or monkey bars. Feet MAY be used on suspended ropes and pipes. Participants may NOT use any part of the rig structure to assist in crossing the rig. Participants may not hang from the top parts of the structure at any time; they may only use the attachments such as rings, monkey bars, ropes, and pipes. Participants may use the chains or hanging apparatus to navigate the obstacle. The obstacle is considered complete when participants reach the other side of the pool.\n\nRise n’ Shine – Athlete must use accessories in their lane to make it across the obstacle without touching the ground. Athlete may not use truss to support their weight at any point during attempt.\n\nSavage Rig – Athletes must cross this obstacle without their feet ever touching the ground. Athletes must start on a step up pipe and negotiate each accesory on the rig in their lane only. Feet may only touch suspended ropes, rope ladders, fire crackers or specific accessory as stated by Savage staff. Athletes may NOT use any part of the rig structure to assist in crossing the rig. The obstacle is considered complete when participants ring the bell. If participants touch the bell but it does not ring, the obstacle is not considered complete. Participants must attempt to ring the bell again, the bell MUST ring before their feet touch the ground or the obstacle is considered failed and must be attempted again.\n\nSawhorses – Athletes must go over each log presented to them. Failure to do so will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nSawtooth – Athletes must use one of the designated lanes and may use only their hands on the rungs. Athletes must start on step up pipe and hit bell for completion. Use of feet or legs will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nScornhole – To begin the obstacle males will pick up an all black 40lb slamball, and ladies will pick up a black with pink accent 20lb slam ball (this ball is also smaller). Runners will throw the ball through the the hole. Once the ball travels through the hole it will automatically return to the bottom without any help needed from the runner. As soon as the ball travels through the hole, the runner will exit the obstacle to the side (do not crawl under or over the Scornhole boards) and continue on the course.\n\nRunners may take as many attempts as needed to complete the obstacle. After any failed attempt, the runner should use the same ball to attempt the obstacle again. If the ball rolls away from the obstacle, the runner must retrieve it again and their attempt count remains the same. PROTIP: Do not let the ball roll past you on a missed attempt.\n\nRunners may touch or lean on the structure but are NOT allowed to climb on the structure.\n\nShelf Help – Racers must start of the start bar, traverse their way across the wooden rung without touching the ground to hit the bell with any part of their body. Racers may not use the truss, climb on top of the structure or use their feet.\n\nShriveled Richard – Athletes must be completely submerged in the ice water and go under the baffle in the middle of the obstacle. Athletes must enter and exit the obstacle using the platforms on the front and back end of the obstacle. Entering or exiting the obstacle from any side without a platform will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nSling Ring – Racers must throw the tire onto telephone pole and it must stay on the pole. Racers cannot touch ground on far side of the log, including after throw is released. Male and female lanes are separate and designated by signage.\n\nSlippery Incline – Athletes must scale the wall in one of the designated lanes, which are designated by ropes hanging from the top of the obstacle. Failure to do so will result in obstacle non-completion. Please note that the use of a rope for assistance is not mandatory.\n\nSqueeze Play – Runners must go between the two sets of barrels, over the horizontal pipes, and through the rope to complete.\n\nSwamp Ass – Athletes must stay within the designated course marking. Failure to do so will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nTeeter Tuber – Athletes must maneuver completely through the tubes. Before entering the tubes, athletes must wait for the entrance side of the tubes to be completely on the ground. Climbing into tubes when the entrance point is not touching the ground will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nThe Great Wall – Climb over the wall without using the legs of the wall to boost yourself over. Use of the legs to get over the wall will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nThor’s Grundle – Athletes must use one of the designated lanes and be submerged in the mud or water. Athletes must go under each baffle presented to them in their designated lane. Failure to do so will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nTree Hugger – Participants must cross this obstacle without their feet ever touching the ground. Participants are allowed to start the obstacle over from the beginning if their feet touch the ground. Participants must stay in their lane at all times. The obstacle is considered complete when participants ring the bell. If participants touch the bell but it does not ring, the obstacle is not considered complete. Participants must attempt to ring the bell again, the bell MUST ring before their feet touch the ground or the obstacle is considered failed and must be attempted again.\n\nTree Hugger 2.0 – Racers will use rope and telephone pole to climb up and hit the bell. Racers cannot jump to the bell or use the truss or chain holding the pole.\n\nTwin Peaks – Runners may not stop, wait, or move backwards before scaling the second wall. As runner descends first wall, they must immediately continue up the second wall. Running back up the first wall to gain momentum and then run up the second wall is not allowed. If a runner falls or stalls, they will be required to start back at the first wall, without an attempt at second wall.\n\nTwist and Shout – Racers must enter net and twist with the net to move the twist behind them to open up the exit hole. Racers may not use truss to aid in their completion.\n\nVenus Guy Trap – Athletes must scale the inverted side of the first wall, down the angled wall into the mud, up the opposite angled wall to get out of the mud pit, and over the backside. Failure to do so will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nWheel World – Runners must begin the obstacle from the step up bar when one is available (usually when obstacle is built over land and not water). If the runner touches the ground after the step-up bar but before ringing the bell then they have failed the obstacle and must try again. Runners must cross the water using only one row of wheels. The use of legs for assistance is not permitted and will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nWindow Wall – Climb through the wall without using the legs of the wall to boost yourself through. Use of the wall’s legs to get through the wall will result in obstacle non-completion. *As a reminder, any assistance given to or received from other athletes on this or any other obstacle may result in obstacle non-completion.*\n\nWrecking Wall – Athlete must begin on step up pipe, go up and over the wall and make contact with bell at the end. Athlete cannot touch the ground until the bell is hit.\n\nYank My Chain – The athlete must use the rope to pull the chain up until the rope knot at the top of the chain makes contact with and stops at the pulley assembly. This rule applies to men and women. Women’s chain weight: 95 lbs. Men’s chain weight: 125 lbs.\n\nClassics\n\nBattering Bird – Runners must begin the obstacle from the step up bar when one is available. If the runner touches the ground after the step-up bar but before ringing the bell then they have failed the obstacle and must try again. Runners must use the blue “shuttle” to cross the obstacle and then transfer to the handles/mops before ringing the bell to complete the obstacle. Runners may not touch the ground, aluminum, or gray pipe that the shuttle slides on at any time. If at any time the runner fails the obstacle, they are required to start back over from the beginning.\n\nBattering Ram – Runners must begin the obstacle from the step up bar when one is available (usually when obstacle is built over land and not water). If the runner touches the ground after the step-up bar but before ringing the bell then they have failed the obstacle and must try again. Runners must use the blue “shuttle” to cross the obstacle and ring the bell to complete the obstacle. Runners may not touch the ground, aluminum, or gray pipe that the shuttle slides on at any time. If at any time the runner fails the obstacle, they are required to start back over from the beginning.\n\nBlazed – Athletes must jump over the fire pit within the designated course. Failure to jump over the pit will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nChopsticks –Participants must begin the obstacle from the starting bar and must not touch the ground before they complete the obstacle by ringing the bell at the other end. Participants may not touch any part of the aluminum structure at any time, only the wooden “chopsticks.” Any participant who touches the ground with any body part, or fails the obstacle in any way, must start the obstacle over from the beginning.\n\nHangarang – Athletes must cross this obstacle using by walking/running across the log. Crawling across the log will result in non-completion. Hands may be used on the chains and rope only. Hands MAY NOT touch the log. If a participant touches the log with their hands it will result in non-completion. If any part of an athlete’s body touches the pool of water, this results in obstacle non-completion. Athlete’s may not use the aluminum truss structure to help complete the obstacle.\n\nHoly Roller – Use hands and feet to traverse underneath the pipes. Hit the bell for completion. Touching the ground or truss is considered failure. Do not stand on or lay across pipes.\n\nHoly Sheet – Runners must begin the obstacle from the step up bar when one is available (usually when obstacle is b/uilt over land and not water). If the runner touches the ground after the step-up bar but before ringing the bell then they have failed the obstacle and must try again. Runners must use the hanging apparatuses to cross the obstacle and ring the bell to complete the obstacle. Runners must hang by ONLY their hands or arms, and may NOT use their feet or legs on the apparatuses to cross the obstacle. Runners may use the chains or hanging apparatus to navigate the obstacle. Runners may use their feet to ring the bell at the finish. Runners may not touch the ground or aluminum structure at any time. If at any time the runner fails the obstacle, they are required to start back over from the beginning.\n\nInversion Therapy – Participants must mount the obstacle without touching the water, then shimmy across the obstacle to the other side and ring the bell, then dismount onto land. As long as the bell is rung prior to touching the ground or water, the participant has completed the obstacle. Participants must complete the obstacle without their hands or feet touching the water at any point. (Butts may skim the water.) Touching the perpendicular truss pieces at the transitions (pipe to spinner, or spinner to ladder) will NOT result in obstacle failure.\n\nObstacle over land: Participant must mount the obstacle completely from behind the orange starting tape on the pipe. Once hands or feet cross the orange line on the pipe, all parts of the body must be off the ground. Hands or feet may not touch the ground at any time between the orange starting line on the pipe and ringing the bell on the finishing end. (Butts may skim the ground.) Touching the perpendicular truss pieces at the transitions (pipe to spinner, or spinner to ladder) will NOT result in obstacle failure. Participants may NOT scoot their butt across the ground and hold their feet in the air. Participants must make an honest effort to keep their hands and feet on the pole/ladder at all times.\n\nMad Ladders – Runners must cross the obstacle by using each hanging apparatus without touching the ground or the aluminum truss structure. Runners will start on their first rope ladder and must finish the obstacle by ringing the bell at the opposite end. If a runner fails to cross the obstacle and ring the bell without touching the ground, they must start the obstacle over.\n\nMissionary Impossible – Athletes must lie on their back and up the hill under the cargo net. Use of both hands and feet is permitted. Failure to climb the hill under the net will result on obstacle non-completion.\n\nOn the Fence – Athletes will scale the chain-link fence to cross the water pit. Athletes are not allowed to place their hands or feet on the frame (top, middle, or bottom). Athletes must use their fingers/hands/feet on the actual chain-link fence part of the panel. If an athlete falls into the water pit, they may exit the pit on either side, and attempt the obstacle again.\n\nPipe Dreams – Athletes must cross using only one overhead hanging pipe. The use of legs for assistance is not permitted and will result in obstacle non-completion.\n\nPole Cat – Participants must traverse the obstacle using the two parallel poles. Athletes must use their feet on one pole and their hands on the other pole where the athlete’s body will be suspended over the space between the two poles. If an athlete falls into the pit below, they will be required to exit the pit and restart from the beginning.\n\nTwirly Bird – Runners must begin the obstacle from the step up bar when one is available (usually when obstacle is built over land and not water). If the runner touches the ground after the step-up bar but before ringing the bell then they have failed the obstacle and must try again. Runners must use the hanging apparatuses to cross the obstacle and ring the bell to complete the obstacle. Runners may use the chains or hanging apparatus to navigate the obstacle. Runners may not touch the ground or aluminum structure at any time. If at any time the runner fails the obstacle, they are required to start back over from the beginning."
