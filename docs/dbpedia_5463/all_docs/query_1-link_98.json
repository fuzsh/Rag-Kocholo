        "text": "This is STP, from start to finish!\n\nStart Line\n\nLocation: University of Washington, Seattle, Parking Lot E-18 (map)\n\nFriday Services Starts Ends Packet Pickup 6 p.m. 9 p.m. Bag Drop-Off ($) 6 p.m. 9 p.m.\n\nSaturday Services Starts Ends Packet Pickup 4:45 a.m. 7:15 a.m. Bag Drop-Off 4:45 a.m. 7:15 a.m. One-Day Riders 5 a.m. 5:30 a.m. Two-Day Riders 5:30 a.m. 7:30 a.m.\n\nFood Stops\n\nThere are three types of food stops on the STP route:\n\nOfficial Rest Stops - Food is free, sports drink available, Honey Buckets onsite, full medical staffing, and mechanic onsite.\n\nOfficial Mini Stops - Food is for purchase, water may be for sale, Honey Buckets onsite, self serve First Aid kits, and some have mechanics onsite.\n\nUnofficial Stops - Community groups, kids with lemonade, and others set up stops along the route. Some offer free food, some offer food and drink for purchase. No additional services have been arranged at these sites. They are often unknown to the organizers until the day of the event. Riders are encouraged to use any and all stops along the STP route that fit their personal needs.\n\nOur fully supported 200+ mile ride is kept at a comparatively low cost with five free food stops on route. Participating in mini-stops helps the communities along the route raise funds for their community work and allows us to keep your registration fee at a minimum. Food at official stops is not a three course meal; food is chosen for caloric intake and meant to keep you fueled. If you have multiple food allergies we suggest carrying bars that you know you can eat. The route goes through many small towns where grocery and convenience stores are readily available.\n\nOfficial Rest Stops\n\nMile Marker Location Saturday Hours Sunday Hours Mile 19 Kaiser Permanente, Renton, WA 5:30 - 9 a.m. (Not open) Mile 54 Spanaway Middle School, Spanaway, WA 7 a.m. - 2 p.m. (Not open) Mile 106 Chehalis Recreation Park 9:30 a.m. - 2 p.m. (Not a full stop on Sunday) Mile 144 Riverside Park, Lexington, WA 1 - 6 p.m. 8 a.m. - 2 p.m. Mile 176 St. Helens Elementary School, St. Helens, OR 2-6 p.m 9 a.m.- 5 p.m.\n\nChehalis will host the one-day rider (or any points beyond Chehalis) stop this year.

Look for the big blue \"WATER\" flags.\n\nA refresh station will be available for you to quickly spritz off on NE 11th Ave.\n\nShowers are available at the nearby Lloyd Athletic Club for a $20 day pass. Day use lockers and towels available. Riders must sign a waiver and sign in on each entry to the gym.\n\nRoute Support\n\nRider support # (206) 841-9665\n\nThis number is printed on your bib and map. Only works during the event hours.\n\nOfficial support hours\n\nSaturday 5:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m.\n\nSunday 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m.\n\nSupport vehicles\n\nTen support vehicles will patrol the route to pick up riders unable to continue. These vehicles will circle the course until the support hours end. While we keep an eye on the last riders and when they will finish, please be mindful that there is a point where we will end official support.\n\nThe Gold Wing Touring Association will be on route with up to 60 motorcyclists who patrol the route. They are equipped with radios and first aid kits. Gold Wings respond to mechanical problems, minor medical situations, and support traffic and crowd control in case of a detour, unforeseen hazard or emergency.\n\nMechanical support\n\nEach official rest stop and most mini-stops provides mechanical support for your bicycle. Supporting bicycle shops provide volunteer labor, but charge for parts. Come prepared to pay for bicycle repairs that you may need on the route. Many mechanics are cash only, but a few will accept credit cards. Tips for service are appreciated.\n\nMedical support\n\nEach year up to 60 people (medics, firefighters, police officers, nurses and doctors) volunteer to ride the STP as members of the Medical Team. These volunteers are identified by red medical team jerseys or helmet covers.\n\nAdditionally, the five official food stops and the finish line will be staffed with volunteers from local Medical Reserve Corps, fire departments and more. All other mini stops on the route will have first aid supplies available for riders, but will not be staffed.\n\nOutriders\n\nCascade Bicycle Club Outriders are a team of trained and experienced Cascade volunteers and ride participants. They are well versed in Cascade events and are available to help with minor mechanical issues, fixing a flat and can answer any questions you may have about the ride. You’ll see them wearing the green, white and black Outrider jerseys. Flag them down if you need assistance. The safety of ride participants is their first priority.\n\nStay supported\n\nIf you are not able to keep up a pace of 10 miles/hour (including stops), you will fall behind support. Our drivers will assist you as much as possible and will often offer “bumps” to get you back into the areas of support.\n\nIf you are not coming to the start line, calculate your pace and your start time accordingly or you will be ahead of support. Do not leave the start line area after 7:30 a.m. or luggage trucks will be closed and you will be behind support services.\n\nOperations Center\n\nOur operations and support crews on STP are crucial to the success of the event, receiving phone calls and messages from the rider support line, dispatching SAG vehicles or escalating issues to first responders, and communicating with services like bike mechanics along the route.\n\nPersonal Support Vehicles (PSVs)\n\nSTP riders are well-supported with plenty of food, mechanical support, and medical support.\n\nIn past years, we have seen an excessive number of PSVs on the cycling route, leading to unsafe and unpleasant riding conditions. If you must rely on a personal support vehicle, we ask that your driver and support team follow this etiquette. Please see ourGoogle Map with easy navigation tools to meet up points. See the .pdf document for written instructions.\n\nSupport Vehicle Etiquette"
