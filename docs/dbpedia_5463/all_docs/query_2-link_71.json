It can also be found on your Number Pick-up Card.\n\nOnly official runners with a B.A.A.-assigned bib number will be allowed to enter the start area.\n\nCorrals & Corral Loading\n\nIn order to exit the Village and enter the corrals in an efficient and orderly fashion, runners will leave the Athletes’ Village according to their assigned wave, bib number, and corral assignment.\n\nNOTE: Your starting corral is in a square box printed on your bib. Follow signs to your particular corral.\n\nWhat to Know:\n\nAfter exiting the Athletes’ Village, all athletes will be lined up by corral. The Start is a .7-mile walk from the Athletes’ Village.\n\nAll runners are numbered according to qualifying times, facilitating a start and pace comparable to others with similar qualifying times. Runners should line up in the wave and corral they have been assigned.\n\nYou may move from your assigned Wave and Corral to a later Wave or Corral. For example, if you are assigned to Wave 1, you may move back to Wave 2, Wave 3, or Wave 4 in any corral EXCEPT the first corral in any Wave. However, you may NOT move to an earlier Wave or Corral. Violators are subject to penalties and/or disqualification.\n\nOnly official runners with a B.A.A.-assigned bib number may enter a corral.\n\nParticipants who do not follow race guidelines are subject to disqualification\n\nSTART TIMES\n\nDIVISION/PROGRAM START TIME* Military March 6:00 a.m. ET Men's Wheelchair 9:02 a.m. ET Women's Wheelchair 9:05 a.m. ET Handcycles & Duos 9:30 a.m. ET Professional Men 9:37 a.m. ET Professional Women 9:47 a.m. ET Para Athletics Division 9:50 a.m. ET Wave 1 10:00 a.m. ET Wave 2 10:25 a.m. ET Wave 3 10:50 a.m. ET Wave 4 11:15 a.m. ET\n\n*Start times are subject to change.\n\nUnauthorized Participants\n\nThose who are not officially registered in the Boston Marathon will not be allowed to participate.\n\nOfficial participants are asked to discourage family and friends who are not officially registered participants from entering the course in any manner.\n\nMany people want to participate in some way in the Boston Marathon as a display of support, but those who are not official participants are asked to refrain from entering the course for the safety of the official entrants and themselves.\n\nAnyone on the course for any distance who has not been assigned, or is not displaying, an officially issued bib number from the B.A.A. is subject to interdiction.\n\nThe B.A.A. reserves the right to remove any person from the course who is not displaying an official bib that has been assigned by the B.A.A.\n\nSimilarly, units or groups such as military ruck-marchers, unless officially sanctioned, and cyclists will not be allowed to participate.\n\nParticipant Shuttle In Hopkinton\n\nLimited parking for participants is available at the 52 and 80 South Street lots in Hopkinton. This parking is for participants only, and a bib is required to access the participant shuttle system. Participant shuttle buses will run throughout race morning to Athletes' Village.\n\nHopkinton Spectator Parking\n\nLimited parking for spectators is available at Hopkinton State Park on race morning.\n\nHopkinton Volunteer Parking\n\nIn Hopkinton, volunteer parking is available at 176 South Street, with shuttles running to Athletes' Village and back."
