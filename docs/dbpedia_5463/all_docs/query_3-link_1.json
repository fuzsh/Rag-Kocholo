        "text": "Background:\n\nThe style I have chosen for this work is pop-punk because it is the one I identify with the most. It is also, along with traditional punk-rock, my favorite style of music, and the one I am most informed about. Pop-punk has had, has, and will have a very significant influence from a social perspective on millions of people, especially in the United States. Pop-punk emerged as a derivative of punk-rock, retaining many key factors of the style such as rhythm or the instruments used. However, it differentiated itself from themes like politics or ideologies to focus on more adolescent or youthful themes, while also softening the melodies from earlier punk-rock, punk, or hard-rock years. I believe pop-punk can be defined as the generation of young people who grew up with punk bands like Bad Religion, Misfits, Black Flag, Sex Pistols, Dead Kennedys, among others, and decided to adapt it to the new era of the nineties and later the early years of the new century, expressing in the new genre the typical problems of the age they were living in, namely, teenagers or twenty-somethings. As Billie Joe Armstrong (vocalist of Green Day) said in an interview: “Never Mind the Bollocks was one of the first punk albums I listened to. For me, it had a great impact. Everything about it, from the lyrics to the guitar sounds and the songs, I thought it was just perfect.”\n\nTo place ourselves a bit at the beginning of pop-punk, we would have to go back to the nineties in the United States, specifically in California, where pop-punk and subsequent music would have a starting point. We can see that in this state, the most famous punk-rock and pop-punk bands emerged, along with other great artists from other genres like Guns N’ Roses within hard-rock, as well as some of the bands mentioned earlier. This gave great hope and influence to the young people of the state. From this point, we can see areas like Los Angeles, the California coast, or one of the cities most famous for the three major bands within punk and pop-punk it has produced, which is Berkeley, where Green Day, NOFX, and Rancid were formed, as well as derivatives among members of different groups such as The Armstrongs (formed by Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day and Tim Armstrong of Rancid) or Operation Ivy, which includes members of Rancid.\n\nIn this context that I am explaining, punk is still too recent. Bands like Green Day are still immersed in the atmospheres of punk haunts like 924 Gilman Street (one of the most legendary punk venues along with New York’s CBGB), so there are still some years before the establishment and expansion of pop-punk, which will definitively occur in the late nineties and early two thousands.\n\nThemes and thoughts:\n\nWhen we arrive at the period we ended with in the previous paragraph, it is essential to know the context in which this music is involved. Punk is behind, music is more consumed and therefore more commercial. Since the eighties and nineties, many record labels have emerged, focusing on the success of this music, especially after the success of Green Day’s “Dookie” in 1994. In this transitional period between centuries, much of the music that emerges is consumed by young people, so it is not surprising that it has more youthful themes. Bands like The Offspring emerged with their album “Americana” in 1998, where several music videos feature young people with problems, without a future, addicted to drugs, facing family issues, and similar social situations.\n\nThis theme of troubled youth is what ignites the flame of pop-punk and how the themes will develop, focusing on them, partly because of the stories written in song form and partly because of the stories lived by the authors themselves and much of the American youth society of that time, who saw how television, commercial, or technological progress contrasted with many bad life situations that affected them and their surroundings. In this heyday of pop-punk, we have some examples of songs with the aforementioned themes. For example, “Why Don’t You Get A Job?” by The Offspring tells the story of people who want to change their lives. Also, from The Offspring’s aforementioned album, we have songs with themes of radical change or life changes over time, such as “She’s Got Issues,” which reflects what the title suggests, or “The Kids Aren’t Alright,” which mentions how people from a neighborhood that seemed lively and bright in childhood have fallen into drug abuse or situations like suicide. Another of my favorite examples, as it is my favorite song by Simple Plan, is “Perfect,” released in 2002, which tells the story of how the band’s drummer disappoints his parents. For me, the song that best reflects all these situations is my favorite Green Day song, “Jesus of Suburbia,” released in 2004 on the album “American Idiot,” which tells the story of a punk youth dealing with family problems, romantic disappointments, as well as drug addiction or self-harm, always with his desire to escape from his city and his life in mind.\n\nRegarding Descendents, the group that could be considered the pioneer of pop-punk, it was said that this genre was music made for losers, and I believe that pop-punk hooked part of American society that felt that way. All those people who saw that life was slipping away from them for one reason or another found their stories reflected in songs of this kind. Another of the associations that I have read and particularly like regarding this generation is “The Ritalin Generation,” which refers to a treatment for ADHD. This medication appears, for example, in “Blame It On My Youth” by Blink-182 or “Jesus of Suburbia” by Green Day.\n\nAnother characteristic of pop-punk that is very present is a provocation to society or going against the established norms, although in a much softer way than in punk, a form of expression that was also very present in part of American society, as we will see later in several examples of series or programs, as well as songs. They no longer used radical political propaganda as in the case of Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols but rather immature or immodest attitudes. For example, frequent themes in songs include the exaggerated use of vulgar words related to sex or sexuality, dark humor, recreational drug use, nudity, obscene gestures, challenging any kind of authority, immaturity, or attempting to act in a way that does not correspond to one’s actual age. For me, there are two main groups that are the references for this attitude, as well as being two of my favorite groups, which are Bowling For Soup, which is not as well known, and of course Blink-182, especially in the 1999 era and their album “Enema Of The State” and some of their big hits from the albums “Take Off Your Pants And Jacket,” which already warns us of the content of the album, and “Dude Ranch.” Although of course, talking about immaturity and precisely not wanting to act according to one’s age, the two great songs of this genre are “Fat Lip” in 2001 by SUM 41 and “What’s My Age Again” by Blink-182 in 1999. In the first, a phrase clearly indicates it, “Don’t tell\n\nme how to behave, I’m tired of acting my age,” says Deryck Whibley while in the background there are obscene gestures, mosh pits, people skating, and typical punk mohawks, while in the second, Mark Hoppus mentions: “What’s wrong with me? My friends tell me to act my age, but what’s my age?” and later he comments, “Why would you wish that on me? I’ll never act my age,” while he, Tom DeLonge, and Travis Barker (the three members of the band) walk naked down the street bothering people.\n\nPop-punk outside of music:\n\nAs I mentioned before, music is not the only aspect where this immature change in American youth society was shown. Programs began to appear and be successful that highlighted this immaturity and were closely related to pop-punk. Some examples include American Pie, movies that largely deal with the sexuality of various immature young people where Blink-182 had a cameo. Or Jackass, a program that features adults engaging in self-injurious activities. These adults are well-known for their relationship with pop-punk and drug abuse. Probably the most famous is Steve-O, who has a podcast talking about his anecdotes on Jackass or drug abuse with participants like Tom DeLonge, Tommy Lee, or Corey Taylor (the latter two are not considered pop-punk, but they can be seen as inspiration for some artists).\n\nSubsequently, pop-punk was brought into fashion in skateboarding, surfing, or similar brands related to pop-punk. Some of the most famous ones are those promoted by the Blink-182 trio, with Mark Hoppus with Atticus, Tom DeLonge with Hurley, and Travis Barker with his own label Famous Star and Straps. Another scenario where pop-punk arrived was television, with SUM 41 as part of the soundtrack for Spider-Man or Green Day and Bowling For Soup in Phineas and Ferb.\n\nWith all this, I want to highlight what pop-punk meant for a part of the society of the time and how through the songs of these groups we can know the feelings and context of the people who like and create this genre.\n\nPop-punk, “new wave pop-punk,” or “pop-punk revival”:\n\nDuring the early years of the two thousands, pop-punk spread not only through the United States but also through the United Kingdom or Canada. Groups emerged in other areas such as The Good Charlotte in Maryland or many groups from Florida. Subsequently, pop-punk began to have a similar but mixed audience with other genres that had a large audience at the same time as pop-punk, such as rap or more hardcore tones like Rage Against The Machine, Linkin Park, pop-punk with power-pop Avril Lavigne, also known as the princess of pop-punk. Members of leading groups began to lean on other emerging genres or form other groups, for example, Box Car Racer or +44 formed by members of Blink-182 with some variations, Travis Barker of Blink-182 with Tim Armstrong of Rancid in The Transplants, and in recent years, some groups took a path close to pop, such as Fall Out Boy. The point is that during all these years, the themes have been practically the same, always the fact of artists seeking comfort by composing and listeners seeking it by listening.\n\nShortly before the pandemic began, a new wave of pop-punk emerged known as “new wave pop-punk” or “pop-punk revival.” In this wave, artists like Machine Gun Kelly, Yungblud, or Jxdn stand out. Practically many of the new artists have been embraced by artists from previous eras, like John Feldmann of Goldfinger who welcomed Girlfriends, and of course, the greatest exponent of all the current pop-punk production: Travis Barker, who has collaborated with hundreds of artists and has taken the new wave of pop-punk to the top of the charts.\n\nThe reflection I want to make here is the following: People who were inspired by the music of the eighties in the nineties to give it a more melodic rhythm are the ones who are helping the generation of new pop-punk to make current music inspired by the pop-punk of the nineties. Therefore, I believe the chain continues, and it is worth analyzing how the themes remain the same because youth continues to have the same concerns and fears in each era. Many of the current songs also deal with topics such as drug use, immaturity, questioning authority, but at the same time, they have introduced topics such as suicide or mental health. I prefer the pop-punk of the nineties and the two thousands to that of today, but I consider that as long as the message remains unaltered, the social function of this genre will continue to be the same as it has been for the past thirty years."
