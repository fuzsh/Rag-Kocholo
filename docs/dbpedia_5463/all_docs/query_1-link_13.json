        "text": "Richie Havens\n\nFrom the Prison\n\nGet Together\n\nFrom the Prison (Reprise)\n\nThe Minstrel from Gault\n\nI’m a Stranger Here\n\nHigh Flying Bird\n\nI Can’t Make It Anymore\n\nWith a Little Help from My Friends\n\nHandsome Johnny\n\nStrawberry Fields Forever > Hey Jude\n\nFreedom (Motherless Child)\n\nWatch Havens perform Freedom.\n\nHavens as a live performer earned widespread notice. His Woodstock appearance in 1969 catapulted him into stardom and was a major turning point in his career. As the festival’s first performer, he held the crowd for nearly three hours. In part, Havens was told to continue playing, because many artists scheduled to perform after him were delayed in reaching the festival location with highways at a virtual standstill. He was called back for several encores. Having run out of tunes, he improvised a song based on the old spiritual Motherless Child that became Freedom. The subsequent Woodstock movie release helped Havens reach a worldwide audience. He also appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival in late August 1969.\n\nSri Swami Satchidananda\n\nSri Swami Satchidananda opened the 1969 Woodstock Music Festival in Bethel, New York on August 15, addressing a crowd of approximately 500,000.\n\n“My Beloved Brothers and Sisters:\n\nI am overwhelmed with joy to see the entire youth of America gathered here in the name of the fine art of music. In fact, through the music, we can work wonders. Music is a celestial sound and it is the sound that controls the whole universe, not atomic vibrations. Sound energy, sound power, is much, much greater than any other power in this world. And, one thing I would very much wish you all to remember is that with sound, we can make—and at the same time, break. Even in the war-field, to make the tender heart an animal, sound is used. Without that war band, that terrific sound, man will not become animal to kill his own brethren. So, that proves that you can break with sound, and if we care, we can make also.”\n\nRavi Shankar\n\n“Raga Puriya-Dhanashri/Gat In Sawarital”\n\n“Tabla Solo In Jhaptal”\n\n“Raga Manj Kmahaj (AIap, Jor, Dhun In Kaharwa Tal)”\n\nThe Indian music genius Ravi Shankar was for sure someone very special for the Woodstock festival. He made his first appearance to the western world at the Monterey International Pop Festival in 1967, followed by an invitation from Beatle George Harrison. In the wake of spiritualism and the search for new influences his music became very popular but Shankar wasn’t fond of the drug-consuming and partying crowd of young people.\n\nShankar started at about 10 pm on Friday evening and played for over 40 minutes throughout the rain.\n\nMelanie Safka\n\n“Close to It All”\n\n“Momma Momma”\n\n“Beautiful People”\n\n“Animal Crackers”\n\n“Mr. Tambourine Man”\n\n“Tuning My Guitar”\n\n“Birthday of the Sun”\n\nMelanie’s solo set was short but sweet though you can hear her anxiety in her voice. She performed at 11 pm on Friday, the 15th. Melanie played instead of The Incredible String Band who refused to play while it was raining. In an interview with WAMC Radio in Albany, NY broadcast on December 20, 2007, Melanie stated that the producers of the Woodstock Festival maintained offices in the same building that she did. Due to this, Melanie asked to be part of the Festival. During her set the audience lit up candles to accompany the music. Later she wrote a song about that which was a great hit: “Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)”.\n\nArlo Guthrie\n\nComing into Los Angeles\n\nWheel of Fortune\n\nWalking Down the Line\n\nArlo Speech: Exodus\n\nOh Mary, Don’t You Weep\n\nEvery Hand in the Land\n\nAmazing Grace\n\nArlo Davy Guthrie (born July 10, 1947) is an American folk singer.[1] Like his late father, Woody Guthrie, Arlo is known for singing songs of protest against social injustice. Guthrie’s best-known work is “Alice’s Restaurant Massacree”, a satirical talking blues song about 18 minutes in length. His song “Massachusetts” was named the official folk song of the state in which he has lived most of his adult life.\n\nJoan Baez\n\n“Oh Happy Day”\n\n“The Last Thing on My Mind”\n\n“I Shall Be Released”\n\n“Story about how the Federal Marshals came to take David Harris into custody”\n\n“No Expectations”\n\n“Joe Hill”\n\n“Sweet Sir Galahad”\n\n“Hickory Wind”\n\n“Drug Store Truck Driving Man” duet with Jeffrey Shurtleff\n\n“I Live One Day at a Time”\n\n“Take Me Back to the Sweet Sunny South”\n\n“Let Me Wrap You In My Warm and Tender Love”\n\n“Swing Low, Sweet Chariot”\n\n“We Shall Overcome”\n\nThe female counterpart to Bob Dylan, folksinger and anti-war protester Joan Baez, was the last act on Friday evening. She started at about 1:00 am. Appropriately, she wished everybody a good morning. Her perfectly arranged set combined with her beautiful and skillful voice was a fine finish for a chaotic and exhausting first day. During her performance it was drizzling, and then after her she finished it started to rain heavily.\n\nSantana\n\n“Waiting”\n\n“Evil Ways”\n\n“You Just Don’t Care”\n\n“Savor”\n\n“Jingo”\n\n“Persuasion”\n\n“Soul Sacrifice”\n\n“Fried Neckbones and Some Home Fries”\n\nWatch Santana perform Soul Sacrifice.\n\nSantana brought the Latin Rock Fusion to Woodstock. They started at 2:00 pm on Saturday, the 16th. Relatively unknown for the audience, Santana hit the nerve of the party crowd quite well. Their debut album Santana was released in the same month. The band had just played local gigs in the San Francisco area so they were relatively unknown. Their set was powerful and magical at the same time. Santana used to have a massive percussion section at that time and drummer Michael Shrieve added his personal note, especially during the drum solo of “Soul Sacrifice”.\n\nCanned Heat\n\n“I’m Her Man”\n\n“Going Up the Country”\n\n“A Change Is Gonna Come / Leaving This Town”\n\n“Too Many Drivers at the Wheel”\n\n“I Know My Baby”\n\n“Woodstock Boogie”\n\n“On the Road Again”\n\nCanned Heat turned to audience favorites after their Woodstock gig. In 1969 they had already added psychedelic elements to their blues influenced songs and their Boogie Rock kept the people dancing. They hit the stage on Saturday, the 16th at about 7.30 pm. The gig took place during sunset which occurred at 7.56 pm. The sky was cloudy so it was a little bit darker than usual. The set list was wisely chosen and featured their greatest hits: “Going Up the Country” and “On the Road Again”, the last one as the encore. The song “Woodstock Boogie” is basically an almost 30 minute jam, also including a drum solo. On their album Boogie With Canned Heat (1968) the song is called “Fried Hockey Boogie”.\n\nThe Grateful Dead\n\nSt. Stephen\n\nMama Tried\n\nDark Star\n\nHigh Time\n\nTurn On Your Lovelight\n\nThe Grateful Dead are their own phenomenon. Influenced by Blues, Jazz, Country, Folk and of course Rock ‘N’ Roll, they used to stretch their compositions to incredible lengths, improvising solos and lyrics. The Grateful Dead came late on stage because Owsley Stanley (a.k.a. “Bear” – their soundman and electrical engineer) wanted to fix the electrical ground on stage. Also their heavy equipment had squashed the turnable stage. Further, the rain had flooded the stage and the band was in danger of electric shocks. Songs got delayed because of long breaks between them. After a while, it all ended in an almost everlasting “Turn On Your Lovelight” after which the band left. The Dead started at about 10:30 pm on Saturday the 16th. Their gig was supposed to be a little longer than the other bands because of the breaks. So they finished around midnight.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival\n\nBorn on the Bayou\n\nGreen River\n\nNinety-Nine and a Half (Won’t Do)\n\nCommotion\n\nBootleg\n\nBad Moon Rising\n\nProud Mary\n\nI Put a Spell on You\n\nThe Night Time Is the Right Time\n\nKeep on Chooglin’\n\nSuzy Q\n\nWatch Creedence Clearwater Revival at Woodstock.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival’s catchy music was one of the true highlights of the whole festival. Though they started late in the night from Saturday to Sunday (around 12.30) their blend of R&B, Folk- and Country-Rock didn’t fail to impress. However, John Fogerty complained that the long set of The Grateful Dead delayed their set so most of the audience went to bed when CCR performed in the middle of the night.\n\nThe Who\n\nHeaven and Hell\n\nI Can’t Explain\n\nIt’s a Boy\n\n1921\n\nAmazing Journey\n\nSparks\n\nEyesight to the Blind (The Hawker)\n\nChristmas\n\nAcid Queen\n\nPinball Wizard\n\nThe Abbie Hoffman Incident\n\nDo You Think It’s Alright?\n\nFiddle About\n\nThere’s a Doctor\n\nGo to the Mirror\n\nSmash the Mirror\n\nI’m Free\n\nTommy’s Holiday Camp\n\nWe’re Not Gonna Take It\n\nSee Me, Feel Me\n\nSummertime Blues\n\nShakin’ All Over\n\nMy Generation\n\nNaked Eye\n\nThe Who were scheduled as the second to last act (before Jefferson Airplane) to play on Saturday, August 16th. When they actually started playing it was already Sunday morning around 5:00. They played their exceptional Tommy album, a Rock Opera dealing with the struggle of a deaf, dumb and blind boy who later finds a cure and gains stardom with his messianic movement. The finale of this performance took place during sunrise which occured at 6:05 am.\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nThe Other Side of This Life\n\nSomebody to Love\n\n3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds\n\nWon’t You Try / Saturday Afternoon\n\nEskimo Blue Day\n\nPlastic Fantastic Lover\n\nWooden Ships\n\nUncle Sam Blues\n\nVolunteers\n\nThe Ballad of You & Me & Pooneil\n\nCome Back Baby\n\nWhite Rabbit\n\nThe House at Pooneil Corners\n\nWatch Jefferson Airplane perform Somebody To Love and White Rabbit.\n\nJefferson Airplane was quite the biggest band of the San Francisco scene. Their roots date back to the year 1965 and by 1967 (mostly because of the Monterey International Pop Festival and the proclamation of the Summer of Love) they had gained stardom. The dual and sometimes triple voice was their trademark. They combined Psychedelia as well as Blues in their songs. The Airplane became the archetype of the new, young and rebellious generation: free and successful, living together as a family (or at least as good friends), making music, taking drugs. Jefferson Airplane were scheduled as the headliner for Saturday, the second day of Woodstock, but finally started in Sunday morning around 8.00 am (or earlier).\n\nJoe Cocker\n\nWho Knows What Tomorrow May Bring (without Joe Cocker)\n\n40,000 Headmen (without Joe Cocker)\n\nDear Landlord\n\nSomething’s Coming On\n\nDo I Still Figure in Your Life\n\nFeelin’ Alright\n\nJust Like a Woman\n\nLet’s Go Get Stoned\n\nI Don’t Need No Doctor\n\nI Shall Be Released\n\nHitchcock Railway\n\nSomething to Say\n\nWith a Little Help from My Friends\n\nJoe Cocker was the first officially scheduled act on Sunday. He went on stage at about 2.00 pm. Though Cocker was in the music business for quite a while he was hardly known. But after his triumphal success at Woodstock the man with the soulful voice became famous everywhere. Especially well received was the Beatles’ cover song “With a Little Help from My Friends” which was already the second performance after Richie Havens’ version on the first day. Cocker’s backing band at that time was the superb Grease Band – a formation that lasted only two years.\n\nShortly after Cocker’s gig a heavy thunderstorm washed over the festival and everything was brought to stop for several hours.\n\nCountry Joe & The Fish\n\nRock & Soul Music\n\n(Thing Called) Love\n\nNot So Sweet Martha Lorraine\n\nSing, Sing, Sing\n\nSummer Dresses\n\nFriend, Lover, Woman, Wife\n\nSilver and Gold\n\nMaria\n\nThe Love Machine\n\nEver Since You Told Me That You Love Me (I’m a Nut)\n\nShort Jam (instrumental)\n\nCrystal Blues\n\nRock & Soul Music (Reprise)\n\n“Fish” Cheer > I-Feel-Like-I’m-Fixin’-To-Die Rag\n\nLike a few other artists of the Woodstock Festival Country Joe & The Fish have also appeared on the other major U.S. music festival of that time: The Monterey International Pop Festival in 1967. Since then they have released their most important albums, reformed their line-up and become severe critics of the raging war in Vietnam. Country Joe & The Fish resumed the festival after the thunder storm on Sunday, August 17th. That must have been around 6.30 pm.\n\nJanis Joplin\n\nRaise Your Hand\n\nAs Good as You’ve Been to This World\n\nTo Love Somebody\n\nSummertime\n\nTry (Just a Little Bit Harder)\n\nKozmic Blues\n\nCan’t Turn You Loose\n\nWork Me, Lord\n\nPiece of My Heart\n\nBall and Chain\n\nJanis Joplin and her former band Big Brother & the Holding Company gained stardom at the Monterey International Pop Festival 1967. Unfortunately in late 1968 she left the band to move on to a solo career. Of course, Janis ended up in Woodstock together with a full ensemble of musicians. She played in the night of Saturday to Sunday at about 2:00AM. The show was still strong but it lacked somewhat of Janis Joplin’s power and improvisation of her backing band. Nevertheless, this gig is a worthwhile document of time.\n\nTen Years After\n\nSpoonful\n\nGood Morning Little Schoolgirl\n\nHobbit\n\nI Can’t Keep from Crying Sometimes\n\nHelp Me\n\nI’m Going Home\n\nThe British band Ten Years After hit the stage on Sunday, August 17th at about 8.15 pm. They were known for heavy blues rock, and long guitar and drum solos. But what could have been a world-shaking performance failed due to technical reasons: the high humidity caused the instruments to go out of tune, the sound recording partially failed, and the camera team was just able to film the last song, “I’m Going Home”, an intense performance which was one of the highlights of Woodstock.\n\nThe Band\n\nChest Fever\n\nDon’t Do It\n\nTears of Rage\n\nWe Can Talk\n\nLong Black Veil\n\nDon’t You Tell Henry\n\nAin’t No More Cane on the Brazos\n\nThis Wheel’s on Fire\n\nI Shall Be Released\n\nThe Weight\n\nLoving You Is Sweeter Than Ever\n\nOne of the most appreciated bands, The Band, started on Sunday, the 17th at ca. 10.00 pm. They were known for excellent Folk-Rock, almost better than most US-based Folk bands, succeeding their mentor and former employer Bob Dylan. What can be said about this set? This is the renaissance of Folk-Rock performed at this historic musical event. “I Shall Be Released” is played so sweet that even Mr. Dylan would have smiled. The Band had only one album by hand so far: The cult album Music From Big Pink, released in 1968. But their music didn’t fall short. In fact they had been around for many years. They played seven of the eleven songs from that album, taking a careful try at Bob Dylan, too but not as excessive as for instance The Byrds. “The Weight” is their last song (before the encore), a song that was already made famous by the biker movie Easy Rider.\n\nJohnny Winter\n\nMama, Talk to Your Daughter\n\nLeland Mississippi Blues\n\nMean Town Blues\n\nYou Done Lost Your Good Thing Now > Mean Mistreater\n\nI Can’t Stand It (with Edgar Winter)\n\nTobacco Road (with Edgar Winter)\n\nTell the Truth (with Edgar Winter)\n\nJohnny B. Goode\n\nJohnny Winter is a Blues legend from Texas. He played at Woodstock at midnight on the night of Sunday to Monday (17th to 18th). Johnny Winter played an electrifying 65 minute set of his signature electric blues highlighted by slide guitar amd amazing solos. “Leland Mississippi Blues”, “Mean Mistreater” and the amazing “Mean Town Blues” (probably the highlight of the show) are compositions from his first two albums. The rest are cover versions from well-known Blues and Rock ‘n’ Roll artists: a lengthy but never boring version of B. B. King’s “You Done Lost Your Good Thing Now”, a wonderful “I Can’t Stand It” ( Bo Diddley) or the Chuck Berry classic “Johnny B. Goode” as the encore. Generally all of his performed songs are very strong and dominated by Winter’s immense guitar skills. It is questionable if the audience could grasp this music at this midnightly hour (Johnny Winter started around 12:00 am) but in retrospective it is for sure a very fine concert.\n\nSly & The Family Stone\n\nM’Lady\n\nSing A Simple Song\n\nYou Can Make It If You Try\n\nEveryday People\n\nDance To The Music\n\nMusic Lover\n\nI Want To Take You Higher\n\nLove City\n\nStand!\n\nVery late on Saturday evening, or rather Sunday morning, came Sly & The Family Stone: 3:30 am. Led by Sly Stone, they were pioneers of Funk-Rock which was still based on Soul and R&B added with some psychedelic elements as well as Gospel. The band consisted of black and white members, men and women, which wasn’t that usual at that time. Given their late appearance Sly & The Family Stone were remarkably fresh and powerful. The Woodstock show is widely considered as one of their best performances.\n\nBlood, Sweat & Tears\n\nMore and More\n\nJust One Smile\n\nSomething’s Coming on\n\nMore Than You’ll Ever Know\n\nSpinning Wheel\n\nSometimes in Winter\n\nSmiling Phases\n\nGod Bless the Child\n\nAnd When I Die\n\nYou’ve Made Me So Very Happy\n\nBlood, Sweat & Tears had a distinctive R&B sound and gained a huge popularity in the 60s. Their first few albums were well received and it was no big surprise that they ended up in Woodstock, too. They started around 1.30 am in the night of Sunday to Monday. So it was already the 18th of August, the last day of the festival.\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash (and Young)\n\nSuite: Judy Blue Eyes\n\nBlackbird\n\nHelplessly Hoping\n\nGuinnevere\n\nMarrakesh Express\n\n4 + 20\n\nMr. Soul\n\nI’m Wonderin’\n\nYou Don’t Have to Cry\n\nPre-Road Downs\n\nLong Time Gone\n\nBluebird Revisited\n\nSea of Madness\n\nWooden Ships\n\nFind the Cost of Freedom\n\n49 Bye-Byes\n\nTheir first gig was on August 17, 1969 at the Auditorium Theater in Chicago, with Joni Mitchell as their opening act. They mentioned they were going to someplace called Woodstock the next day, but they had no idea where that was. They began their second set that night with the same line they uttered at Woodstock, “This is only the second time we’ve performed in front of people. We’re scared shitless.” They opened with “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” before launching into a harmony-drenched version of The Beatles’ “Blackbird”. Their second show was a baptism by fire at the Woodstock Festival. CSNY’s recording of the Joni Mitchell song memorializing Woodstock would later become a hit and the recording most associated with the festival.\n\nPaul Butterfield Blues Band\n\nBorn Under a Bad Sign\n\nNo Amount of Loving\n\nDriftin’ and Driftin’\n\nMorning Sunrise\n\nAll in a Day\n\nLove March\n\nEverything’s Gonna Be Alright\n\nThe Paul Butterfield Blues Band is known as one of the few original Chicago Blues followers. In 1965 and 1966 they made their legendary albums with the original line-up: the self-titled Paul Butterfield Blues Band and the Indian influenced East-West. Among others they played at the Monterey International Pop Festival 1967, too. The Paul Butterfield Blues Band played in the morning hours of Monday, the 18th. The starting time is supposed to be 6.00 am.\n\nSha Na Na\n\nGet A Job\n\nCome Go With Me\n\nSilhuettes\n\nTeen Angel\n\nJailhouse Rock\n\nWipe Out\n\nBlue Moon\n\n(Who Wrote) The Book of Love\n\nLittle Darling\n\nAt The Hop\n\nDuke Of Earl\n\nGet A Job (Reprise)\n\nSha Na Na was a Rock & Roll act that featured dancers on stage. Even for 1969 they were anachronistic focusing on 50ies music and outfits. The group was founded in 1968 and didn’t have an album contract by the time they played at Woodstock. They were the next to last act of Woodstock succeeded by Jimi Hendrix. They performed at 7.30 in the morning of Monday, 18th of August.\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\nJimi Hendrix and his band were known under several names. But besides his backing band, it was just Jimi Hendrix playing. The band was scheduled as the last performance of the festival, Sunday night. Due to several delays, they eventually played on Monday morning, 9:00AM, when most of the audience had already left.\n\nWatch Jimi Hendrix perform The Star Spangled Banner\n\nIntroduction\n\nMessage to Love\n\nGetting My Heart Back Together Again > Hear My Train a-Comin’\n\nSpanish Castle Magic\n\nRed House\n\nMastermind\n\nLover Man\n\nFoxy Lady\n\nBeginning > Jam Back at the House\n\nIzabella\n\nGypsy Woman\n\nFire\n\nVoodoo Child (Slight Return)\n\nStepping Stone\n\nStar Spangled Banner\n\nPurple Haze\n\nWoodstock Improvisation\n\nVillanova Junction\n\nHey Joe"
