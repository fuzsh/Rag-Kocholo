        "text": "Savings EP “Get Well Soon” out NOW | Review\n\nJune 30, 2023\n\nA song by song review –\n\nAmerican Psycho\n\nAs an album opener, I think it sets a good pace for the rest of the EP. It’s very melodic while still fitting into the pop punk genre. Not as catchy as some of the other songs, lyrically, but the instrumentals really help keep you engaged in the song.\n\nYou Mean to Tell Me a Head of Lettuce Sunk This Ship?\n\nThis song really grabs my attention right away with the first few notes and as we get into the lyrics it slowly picks up. It’s slower paced than the song before but it’s still keeping my attention. At 2:08 it really picks up in beat while still keeping that melodic tone within the voice that follows through the rest of the EP.\n\nAlter Ego\n\nWe return with some high energy instrumentals compared to what we’ve heard so far on top of having lyrics that are rhythmic and would make it easy for a crowd to engage with, this would definitely be a song I would look forward to hearing if I ever got a chance to see them live.\n\nChin Up, Champ!\n\nWe slow it down again with this one, but it still keeps those catchy vibes. This is what I would consider the slowest paced song on the album. The first couple lines of lyrics feeling very powerful and it’s conveyed throughout the song\n\nI Found a Date for the Holidays\n\nThe closing sounds very much like Modern Baseball, which the band takes a lot of inspiration from as it’s highlighted on their TikTok. That inspiration makes itself present in this song by sounding like an instant anthem that’s begging to be screamed out every time it comes on\n\nOverall,\n\nThe name of the album “Get Well Soon”, reminds me of the kind of feelings you’d have while going through a hard time and the songs lyrically would remind me of what I would sound like talking myself through it. It’s not often you see a whole set of songs encompass the same theme or feelings but that is the vibe I got from this whole EP right down to the album artwork.\n\nI found the transitions between the songs to be smooth and natural, not trying to be too hard and flowing well into one another. I like that there are dynamic variations within the instrumentals and the harmonizing throughout the songs and I think that comes from the inspirations within the pop punk genre not unlike Modern Baseball (as mentioned earlier) but I find Savings still has a sound that makes them unique.\n\nEach release is better than the next and I am always looking forward to new music from Savings.\n\nListen here | Review by Quinn Hall\n\nKeep up with us on social media! Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube\n\nSilverstein with special guests The Plot In You and Can’t Swim | Silverstein 20th Anniversary Tour | 11/19/21 | Photos + Review\n\nDecember 29, 2021\n\nSilverstein Sells Out Their 20 Year Celebration In Los Angeles\n\n11/19/21 at The Belasco Theater in Los Angeles, CA\n\nIn March of 2020, Silverstein was set to go out on their 20th Anniversary Tour. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the tour was postponed twice. Finally setting out on tour in November and December of 2021, the band now hit their 21st anniversary as a band. To prepare for just a significant anniversary, the band prepared one of the longest sets I’ve ever seen a band play, and they brought along with them The Plot In You and Can’t Swim for the ride. This lineup made for a night of diverse music that kept fans entertained from start to finish.\n\nFirst up was Can’t Swim from Keansburg, New Jersey. I’d best describe the band’s sound in the subgenre known as “easycore.” Easycore is basically the merging of pop-punk and metalcore. Similar bands in sound would be A Day To Remember, Chunk! No, Captain Chunk, and more. The band started with the song “Set The Room Ablaze,” which comes from their newest album, “Change Of Plans,” released in 2021 via Pure Noise Records. This song has a heavy edge, with metalcore-inspired riffs courtesy of Danny Rico and Mike Sanchez. This song also features some raspy screams from guitarist Chris LoPorto. The song’s studio recording features Caleb Shomo from Beartooth, which honestly pushes the song over the edge. This is easily my favorite song from the band and having them open up with it was incredible to witness. The band then went on to play their song “Sometimes You Meet The Right People At The Wrong Time” from their 2018 record “This Too Won’t Pass,” released via Pure Noise Records. This song has an overall pop-punk feel, with the stand-out elements being the drum patterns and overall atmosphere. I focused during this song on drummer Blake Gamel, who was absolutely smashing those drums like crazy. Bassist Greg McDevitt also did a superb job on backup vocals, adding amazing harmonies that pushed the songs to another level. The third song in the set that I captured was their song “Sense of Humor,” which has a very lighthearted feel in the melodies and atmosphere. The song changes up about two-thirds of the way through with a breakdown, adding an extra layer of contrast and depth to the song that kept me jamming while in the photo pit. The band was tight as hell during their set and had incredible energy. They absolutely blew away my expectations. They played a nine-song setlist, playing songs from four of their releases. They’re a fantastic band, and I highly recommend attending their headlining tour in the spring if it comes near you!\n\nSETLIST\n\nSet The Room Ablaze\n\n“Sometimes You Meet The Right Person At The Wrong Time”\n\nSense Of Humor\n\nPrick\n\nDeliver Us From Evil\n\nPower\n\nMy Queen\n\nYour Clothes\n\nStranger\n\nUp next was The Plot In You Hancock County, Ohio. This was my second time ever seeing The Plot In You, with the first and only other time being back in 2016 when they were headlining their “Happiness In Self Destruction” tour in support of their album they had released the year prior of the same title. The band has made quite the transformation since then. The band was previously a through and through metalcore band. They experimented with more melodic elements in the album “Happiness In Self Destruction” before diving deep into their new sound in 2018’s “Dispose” via Fearless Records. Going more towards a post-hardcore and progressive rock sound, the band has genuinely diversified their more recent records. The band opened with the song “Face Me” from their 2021 record “Swan Song,” also released on Fearless Records. Face Me opens up with a beat, and vocalist Landon Tewers before the full band comes in during the chorus. The band really brought the theatrics, with a gorgeous light show that really brought their performance to the next level. The instrumentals have a truly modern vibe to them. The bass from Ethan Yoder is vibrant and prominent, the guitar is deep and full from Josh Lewis Childress, and the drums are clean and solid from Michael Cooper. The band then went on to their second song, “Fall Again,” which is my favorite track from the new record. This song plays with the band’s heavier elements, bringing in some nu-metal inspiration in the guitar tones and vocalizations. Landon Tewers is truly on fire vocally on this record, showing his vast repertoire and prowess. The band then went on to play their song “Enemy,” which has an r&b feel to it, while still dialing into their post-hardcore sound. I love the new addition of the electronics into the music, as it adds a whole other layer to their sound. The crowd was eating them up, jumping, and singing along to every word. The band played a total of ten songs, spanning from “Swan Song,” “Dispose,” and “Happiness in Self Destruction,” which are three albums that really meld nicely in the band’s current discography and their more modern sound. The Plot In You has truly grown a lot since I last saw them, and I cannot wait to see them again.\n\nSETLIST\n\nFace Me\n\nFall Again\n\nEnemy\n\nNot Just Breathing\n\nTime Changes Everything\n\nParadigm\n\nOne Last Time\n\nToo Far Gone\n\nDisposable Fix\n\nFeel Nothing\n\nSilverstein from Burlington, Ontario, Canada, hit the stage next. Hitting two decades for a band in the heavier music genre is a massive milestone for bands in our genre and music in general. It can be easy to burn out and give up, but Silverstein has proven that a band can not only succeed but push themselves further and thrive through perseverance, growth, and rebuilding. For those who somehow have never heard Silverstein, they are that perfect blend of metalcore, post-hardcore, pop-punk, and punk rock. They started out as one of the classic emo bands and have constantly expanded upon their sound to keep previous fans impressed and gain a new, innovative following. For their 20th Anniversary Tour, the band went the whole nine yards, preparing three sets in total. They also brought an extensive amount of colorful and vibrant lighting, timed and themed perfectly to their music. The first set Silverstein played was a greatest hits set, performing songs from their whole discography. They opened with one of their newer singles titled “Bankrupt.” This track is an explosive and heavy track with a deep guitar groove courtesy of Josh Bradford and Paul Marc Rousseau. The crowd went bonkers, with crowd surfing and moshing galore. This track showcases vocalist Shane Told’s intense screams and solid clean vocals. He is a powerhouse vocalist and truly showcased that with this song. The band then went into the song “Massachusetts” from their 2013 album “This Is How The Wind Shifts,” which has a lighter sound compared to “Bankrupt.” Those intricate drum patterns from Paul Koehler are a standout in this song for me. The next song the band went into was “Smashed Into Pieces” from their debut album “When The Broken Is Easily Fixed,” which really has that classic emo and post-hardcore vibe the band founded themselves on. Bassist Billy Hamilton was on point with those harmonies and backup screams on this song, and that deep bass grove really helped push it over. The band then went into songs like “Bad Habits,” “It’s Over,” “Infinite,” and “The Afterglow.” The band even did a massive melody of songs, which included “The Artist,” “Sacrifice,” “I Am The Arsonist,” “The Continual Condition,” “My Disaster,” “Vices,” “Je Me Souviens,” and “Broken Stars.” After a short interlude, Shane Told came out to do an acoustic set while a few members joined during a song or two. The acoustic set consisted of “Rescue You,” “Untitled” by Social Distortion, “Red Light Pledge,” and “Where Are You,” all of which once again showcased how diverse and strong Shane Told’s vocals are all these years later. The band came on for their third set just a minute later to play their second album, “Discovering The Waterfront,” in its entirety. Songs like “My Heroine” and “Call It Karma” were standouts on the album for me, so to hear them live, along with the rest of the songs, was absolutely incredible. The band gave us a special treat for their encore to top it all off. As a final song, the band played “Bleeds No More” from their debut album. However, they changed things up, putting Shane Told on bass and having Billy Hamilton absolutely demolish those vocals. He was on fire, and Shane was plunking away at those chunky bass notes. This song finished off their set on such a high note. Silverstein again proves why they are a staple in their cohort, and I cannot wait to see them again in the new year.\n\nSETLIST\n\nBankrupt\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSmashed Into Pieces\n\nBad Habits\n\nThe Artist/ Sacrifice / I Am The Arsonist / The Continual Condition / My Disaster / Vices / Je Me Souviens / Broken Stars\n\nIt’s Over\n\nInfinite\n\nThe Afterglow\n\nReplace You\n\nUntitled (Social Distortion Cover)\n\nRed Light Pledge\n\nWhere Are You\n\nYour Sword Versus My Dagger\n\nSmile In Your Sleep\n\nThe Ides Of March\n\nFist Wrapped In Blood\n\nDiscovering The Waterfront\n\nDefend You\n\nMy Heroine\n\nAlways And Never\n\nAlready Dead\n\nThe Hours Back\n\nCall It Karma\n\nENCORE\n\n24.

All three bands played amazing sets and made the crowd go NUTS. Give some love to all of these bands and go see them live when they hit cities near you!\n\nSilverstein | The Plot In You | Can’t Swim\n\nPhotos + Review courtesy of Jamie Kaufman | Instagram | Facebook | Twitter |\n\nKeep up with us on social media!

The lineup was stacked, and with some of my all-time favorite pop-punk bands were all on this – State Champs, Four Year Strong, Real Friends, Just Friends, and Bearings.\n\nFirst up was Bearings. The crowd was slowly starting to pour in before they took the stage. I remember the first time I saw them, and I didn’t know who they were. I instantly fell in love with their music because of the lyrics in the songs they played and was upbeat and happy. The type of music that makes you want to jump around and start singing along. I wasn’t expecting to see many crowd surfers during their set, but to my surprise, there was and their frontman, Doug Cousins even jumped off stage to help people coming over the barricade. They played songs off their newest album, “Hello, It’s You,” and some of their older songs from the past. Bearings set the show off with energy to carry on throughout the night.\n\nFollowing Bearings, Just Friends was up next. It’s been a few years since I had last seen them live on Sad Summer Fest, and I wasn’t sure what to expect from them. It was the strangest yet most hypnotizing band I’ve seen in my years of going to concerts. They danced and swayed to the music and got the crowd hyped during the opening song, “Supersonic.” I’ve never seen a band like them with their energy and stage presence. At one point, most of the band turned around and started shaking their butts to the crowd. Everyone was cheering while Eric Butler slapped the bassists’ butt and taking a phone out, and taking selfies and random pictures of the other band members on stage during “Never Gonna Bring You Down” and “Flex.”\n\nNext, we had one of my favorite bands playing – Four Year Strong. I’ve been listening to them since 2009 and have seen them countless times over the years, and they never disappoint. Starting off with “Heroes Get Remembered, Legends Never Die” the crowd exploded while the lights flashed, and everyone was singing along. The set was a mix of songs from multiple albums, including their newest, “Brain Pain.” released last year. People were slowly coming back over the barricade crowd surfing, but even more, came during the third song they played, “It Must Really Suck to Be Four Year Strong Right Now.” The tempo was upbeat and fast-paced and the whole time. I always lose my voice when I see them live as the music is so much fun to listen to and scream to the top of your lungs.\n\nReal Friends came out next. I was excited to see them live as this was my first time. I have almost every single album from them, and once I heard in 2020 that they parted ways with Dan Lambton, I was sad but excited to see what the future held for them. Cody Murano, formerly of Parting Ways and Youth Fountain, they came back with their newest album, “Torn in Two.” It’s been on repeat since it came out for me, and they played a mix of songs from that album, as well as older classics such as “I Don’t Love You Anymore,” “Late Nights in My Car,” and “Me First.” I was impressed with the sound, the lighting, and the energy they had on stage.\n\nThen, it was time for the headliner – State Champs. Yet another band I’ve seen countless times over the years since I first discovered them. They started off with “Secrets” while cryo and streamers emerged from the stage. The venue was packed with people; everyone was singing along, more people came over the barricade, crowd surfing while the photographers did their best not to get hit or kicked in the process for the three songs. I was singing the whole time as they’re one of my favorite bands, and the energy they show on stage is unmatched. They played older songs such as “Elevated,” “Criminal,” and “Mine Is Gold,” as well as some of the newer songs they’ve released recently like “Just Sound” and their cover of Fall Out Boy’s “Chicago Is So Two Years.” After the last song, the house lights stayed off, meaning that they have encore songs. They came out from behind the stage and ended the night with more pryo and playing “All You Are Is History” and “Dead and Gone.” The whole show was full of energy throughout the entire night, making it one of the favorites I’ve been to in the last 19 months since the pandemic started.\n\nState Champs | Real Friends | Four Year Strong | Just Friends | Bearings\n\nPhotos + Review courtesy of Jess Kelly | Instagram | Twitter\n\nKeep up with us on social media! Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube\n\nState Champs w/ Four Year Strong, Real Friends, Just Friends, and Bearings | Pure Noise Records Tour 2021 | Photos + Review\n\nOctober 15, 2021\n\nState Champs and co. Slay The Belasco on the Pure Noise Records Tour\n\nDate: 10-6-21\n\nVenue – The Belasco in Los Angeles, CA\n\nI’ve taken in music like a sponge for as long as I could remember going to shows. Being so open-minded musically, I listen to everything from classical to death metal. However, as a photographer, I’ve photographed a ton more metal than I have other genres. Since shows have come back post lockdown, I really wanted to broaden my horizons and photograph and see bands that have always been on my bucket list. State Champs was one of those bands for me. They have always been on my radar with catchy, high energy, and derived from classic pop-punk. But when running a publication, I have to pick and choose my shows and have typically gone for the heavier metal tours over pop-punk as I know others on the team will cover it instead. With the announcement of the Pure Noise Records Tour, I knew this was finally my chance to see and photograph State Champs, but to once again see Four Year Strong, along with other bands I’ve wanted to see and photograph for years and years, like Real Friends, Just Friends, and Bearings. This showcase of bands from the Pure Noise Records lineup was excellent!\n\nFirst up was Bearings from Ottawa, Canada. The quintet can be best described as the perfect blend between pop-punk and alternative. They opened up the set with “Better Off Yesterday,” which acts as somewhat of a title track off their newest album, “Hello, It’s You,” released in 2020 via Pure Noise Records. Off the bat, vocalist Dougie Cousins took command of that stage, belting out those words in tune with the major key. A staple element to any pop-punk band is that most songs are in major keys, which is a massive change-up compared to the metal I typically see and photograph. I’m all here for a change and branching out here. Guitarist Ryan Culligan acts as a backing vocalist, sometimes singing lead parts and adding harmonies that add the extra touch to the band’s songs. The second song in the set was “Aforementioned” from their 2018 release “Blue In The Dark.” This song definitely incorporates some of their indie and alternative influences, and drummer Mike McKerracher was pounding away at his drum kit with a big smile on his face throughout the whole song. Bassist Collin Hanes and guitarist Ryan Fits were grooving along during the third song, in particular, that being “Over Now,” which once again came from their 2020 release. The band just seems to really enjoy what they’re doing, and with the music they create, and you can’t help but vibe and headbang along with them. Bearings was incredibly endearing and had positively infectious energy throughout their six-song set. I cannot wait to see and photograph them again!\n\nSETLIST\n\nBetter Yesterday\n\nAforementioned\n\nOver Now\n\nDreams\n\nEyes Closed\n\nSway\n\nUp next was Just Friends from Dublin, California. The band is best described as “funk rock,” but to me, they are honestly a melting pot of genres. They have a blend of funk-rock, alternative rock, pop-rap, ska, and a slight emo vibe that I LIVE for. They had some technical difficulties at the start of their set. Still, co-lead vocalist Brianda “Brand” Goyos Leon did a good job entertaining the crowd during the downtime. In fact, she was asking us if we had bought anything cool recently, and I held up my hand sanitizer holder, which is a unicorn cat whose horn lights up when a button is pushed. Well, Brand held it up to the crowd and yells “LOOK HOW COOL THIS IS!!” I started dying laughing, and it’s now kind of an inside joke between us, which I now have looped you all in on too! After the band fixed their technical difficulties, they started the set with their song “I Wanna Love You” from their 2018 album “Nothing But Love,” released in 2018 via Pure Noise Records. I love the vocal dynamics between Sam Kless and Brand throughout their set, with Sam providing the rapping and some singing and Brand providing her bluesy tones that really amp everything up. The next song was the band’s most popular single, “Supersonic.” This song gets the crowd dancing. You can see guitarists Brandon Downum and Matt Yankovich, along with bassist Kevin Prochnow, dancing to choreographed moves to the song while playing their instruments. It’s an absolute bop and a half of a song, so much so that I couldn’t help but stop shooting for a second and dance along with them. The band played a total of five songs, each truly showcasing their talent and range as a group. They were an absolute blast to see and photograph, and I would absolutely love the opportunity to do so again!\n\nSETLIST\n\nI Wanna Love You\n\nSupersonic\n\nFever\n\nStupid\n\nSunflower\n\nReal Friends from Tinley Park, Illinois, was up next. Coming fresh off their new EP “Torn In Two,” released in 2021 via Pure Noise Records, the band set out on this tour as their first tour post-lockdown. This new release for the band was a new chapter in a couple of ways. It was their first release under Pure Noise Records, as they were previously signed to Fearless Records before this. The EP was also their first release with vocalist Cody Muraro. The band opened their set with the song “Nervous Wreck” from this new EP, showcasing their new music right off the bat. Cody is incredibly high energy, constantly jumping, hyping up the crowd, and owning every inch of that stage. The band came prepared for this tour, with a simple yet effective lighting set up behind them, adding a lot of contrast between the darkness and light behind them. Guitarist Dave Knox provided his excellent backing vocals and high energy when not being the mic. The band then moved on to “Me First,” from their last release on Fearless Records released in 2018 titled “Composure.” You could just see how happy the members were to be playing again. Drummer Brian Blake was constantly smiling while playing those fast pop-punk beats. Bassist Kyle Fasel held down the rhythm section with Brian, strumming those deep bass tones that bring the band’s sound to the next level. The band then moved on to the song “I Don’t Love You Anymore,” which came from their 2014 album released via Fearless Records titled “Maybe This Place Is The Same, And We’re Just Changing.” This is where I really honed in on rhythm guitarist Eric Haines, who strummed his parts with precision and seemed ecstatic to be performing again. To finally see these guys after many years of listening to them brought me a ton of excitement. Their pop-punk meets emo sound makes their sound both current and new yet feels like an homage to the music that has come in the scene before their emergence. Their nine-song set did a beautiful job of showcasing songs from each release, including two off the new EP. I cannot wait to see and photograph them the next time they come out here. If this new EP shows a glimmer of what’s to come for the band, there’s no stopping this band!\n\nSETLIST\n\nNervous Wreck\n\nMe First\n\nI Don’t Love You Anymore\n\nLate Nights In My Car\n\nStoryteller\n\nI’ve Given Up On You\n\nGet By\n\nMess\n\nFrom The Outside\n\nFour Year Strong from Worcester, Massachusetts, was up next to the stage as direct support. As one of the pioneers of the easycore genre, Four Year Strong blends Pop Punk with elements of Post Hardcore. Think of it like pop-punk with breakdowns. These guys were by far the heaviest band on this lineup. I previously saw them at the Rockstar Disrupt Fest back in 2019, and they didn’t have much energy on stage that day I saw them. When I tell you these guys blew my expectations out of the water this time around would be an understatement. The band opened their set with the song “Heroes Get Remembered, Legends Never Die” from their 2007 album “Rise or Die Trying,” released via I Surrender Records. The band showcased their insane light show from the gate, something they did not have when performing at the outdoor music festival I last saw them at. The light show the band had with them was fast-paced, just like the band themselves are. Four Year Strong has a unique dynamic, with two co-lead vocalists who both play guitar for the band, Alan Day and Dan O’Connor. This dynamic of their vocals going back and forth add a lot of energy and superb dynamics to their music. The band then moved on to their second song being “Get Out Of My Head,” from their 2020 album “Brain Pain,” released via Pure Noise Records. Brain Pain is by far my favorite album by Four Year Strong, as it truly showcases the perfect blend of the band’s sound. Get Out Of My Head is a more pop-punk heavy song with lots of punchy energy. There’s a deep bass groove heard throughout the song, which is provided by bassist Joe Weiss. Joe is an energetic bassist, constantly moving about and engaging with the audience. They then moved on to their third song, “It Must Really Suck To Be Four Year Strong Right Now,” from their 2010 album “Enemy of the World,” released via Universal Motown Records. I honed in on drummer Jake Massucco during this song, and that dude RIPS it on drums. As I said, Four Year Strong’s vocals are incredibly fast-paced, and Jake really keeps up with those fast songs, laying out the foundation needed in this kind of music. I am beyond stoked to have seen Four Year Strong again and am stoked that they blew my expectations out of the water! They absolutely killed it throughout their entire nine-song set, and I cannot wait to see them again next time they come through Southern California!\n\nSETLIST\n\nHeroes Get Remembered, Legends Never Die\n\nGet Out Of My Head\n\nIt Must Really Suck To Be Four Year Strong Right Now\n\nLearn To Love The Lie\n\nWe All Float Down Here\n\nBrain Pain\n\nGo Down In History\n\nTalking Myself In Circles\n\nWasting Time (Eternal Summer)\n\nFinally, State Champs from Albany, New York, hit the state to absolutely slay the house down! State Champs have been on a steady rise in popularity within the pop-punk and alternative music scenes, starting with their EP “Overslept,” released in 2012 via Pure Noise Records. The band prepared a lengthy sixteen-song set for their headlining set on tour, showcasing songs from each release, starting with “Secrets” from their 2015 album “Around The World And Back.” The band came out the gate with insanely high energy. Vocalist Derek DiScanio had the crowd practically eating out of the palm of his hand the second he came on stage, with crowd surfers galore coming over the barricade throughout my time photographing the set. Like Four Year Strong and Real Friends, the band brought an extensive amount of lighting equipment that made the set feel larger than life and bright as all hell. Guitarist Tyler Szalkowski jumped onto the platform at the start of the set, amping the crowd up. Between the first song, “Secrets,” and the second song, “Crystal Ball,” a fan threw their underwear onto the stage, which landed right in front of bassist Ryan Scott Graham. With a visibly shocked face, Ryan picked up the underwear and put them on his’ mic stand as they proceeded to play “Crystal Ball” from the band’s 2018 album “Living Proof.” This song had bright blue and pink backlighting, which shined bright and vibrant. This is where I saw touring guitarist and backing vocalist Cameron Hurley, who absolutely kills it on stage with the band and meshes right in with their easy-going energy and vibe. The band then went into the song “Frozen,” coming from “Living Proof.” Drummer Evan Ambrosio seemed to be right on par with the rest of the drummers we’ve seen tonight, joyful with lots of smiles and absolutely DOMINATING that stage with his’ beats. The band’s incredibly high energy was evident, and they absolutely did not disappoint. The crowd was heavily engaged, and the band had the most crowdsurfers for any band thus far in the night. During “Frozen,” so many crowd surfers were coming over the barricade that we photographers got kicked out of the photo pit half a song early. I was a bit disappointed, but I got all the shots I needed and got to be up close and personal with a band I’ve wanted to see and photograph for many years at this point. The rest of the set consisted of songs from the band’s releases, a couple of covers, and lots of CO2 cannons shooting out confetti. It was a wild set that I am grateful I was able to witness and capture!\n\nSETLIST\n\nSecrets\n\nCrystal Ball\n\nFrozen\n\nOutta My Head\n\nMine Is Gold\n\nEasy Enough\n\nStitches (Shawn Mendes Cover\n\nChicago Is So Two Years Ago (Fall Out Boy Cover)\n\nCriminal\n\nJust Sound\n\nRemedy\n\nSlow Burn\n\nLosing Myself\n\nElevated\n\nENCORE\n\n15.

All five of the main stage bands had 45-minute sets, where they were truly able to showcase their talents with full on lighting and theatrics. Although all of the acts performed on one stage, they truly made it look and feel special for the main stage bands.\n\nThe first of the main stage bands up was Atreyu from Yorba Linda, California. Atreyu has been a staple in the metalcore scene for quite some time. Although they had a 3-year hiatus from 2011-2014, they have still released 7 truly incredible albums over their career. I personally got into Atreyu in 2010 when their song “Ravenous” was on the video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock. Although they didn’t play Ravenous, the band prepared a 10-song set filled to the brim with fan favorite songs, including “Bleeding Mascara”, “Becoming The Bull”, and their infamous Bon Jovi cover of “You Give Love A Bad Name”. This five piece consists of vocalist Alex Varkatzas, drummer and co-lead vocalist Brandon Saller, guitarists Dan Jacobs and Travis Miguel, and bassist Marc “Porter” McKnight. I had never seen Atreyu live before this date, but I had been listening to them for years. Although I had somewhat high expectations, Atreyu still blew my expectations out of the park. Their stage presence was amazing, with band members jumping off risers and truly using every inch of that stage. The band somehow sounded even better live than on album, which is difficult to do with a band that sounds as good as Atreyu does on album. I was blown away from the moment they hit the stage to the moment they left the stage!\n\nSETLIST\n\nOur Time Is Now\n\nRight Side of the Bed\n\nBecoming The Bull\n\nEx’s and Oh’s\n\nWhen Two Are One\n\nYou Give Love A Bad Name (Bon Jovi Cover)\n\nBleeding Mascara\n\nFalling Down\n\nHouse of Gold\n\nBlow\n\nUp next was Circa Survive from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Circa Survive’s sound is best described as a mixture of post-hardcore and progressive rock. I first got into Circa Survive when their song “The Difference Between Medicine and Poison is the Dose” released on Rock Band in 2007. A big highlight moment of their set was when vocalist Anthony Green jumped on the barricade and embraced fans during the first song “Act Appalled” from their 2005 album Juturna. The band played a 9-song set, which showcased songs from their whole discography minus Violent Waves. The band really got into their set, grooving with every note and truly showcasing a set filled with emotion and raw energy. The rest of the band consists of guitarists Colin Frangicetto and Brendan Ekstrom, bassist Nick Beard, and drummer Steve Clifford. I will say that Anthony Green’s vocals sound raspier in person, which honestly added to the band’s sound. I was thoroughly impressed with their set and I’m stoked to have finally seen them after listening to them for so long.\n\nSETLIST\n\nAct Appalled\n\nRites of Investiture\n\nChild of the Desert\n\nThe Difference Between Medicine and Poison is the Dose\n\nHolding Someone’s Hair Back\n\nIn the Morning and Amazing…\n\nLustration\n\nStop the Fuckin’ Car\n\nGet Out\n\nSum 41 from Ontario, Canada was up next. Sum 41 is the perfect mixture of pop punk, punk rock, and post-hardcore. The sun went down just as their set was starting, which made the lighting truly stand out. For their set, Sum 41 prepared an 11-song set that showcased songs from a majority of their discography. They were extremely tight and very high energy. I thought the colored smoke cannons added to the experience and created some truly amazing moments to capture. This five piece consists of vocalist and rhythm guitarist Deryck Whibley, lead guitarist Dave Baksh, bassist Jason McCaslin, rhythm guitarist Tom Thacker, and drummer Frank Zummo. It was so cool to finally see Sum 41. Their songs “In Too Deep” and “Still Waiting” were staples in my childhood and were played in several movies and TV shows I watched so it was surreal to finally see them. Their stage presence was energetic and engaging. They truly slayed!\n\nSETLIST\n\nThe Hell Song\n\nMotivation\n\nOver My Head (Better Off Dead)\n\nWe’re All To Blame\n\nOut For Blood\n\nFake My Own Death\n\nWalking Disaster\n\nWe Will Rock You (Queen Cover)\n\nIn Too Deep\n\nFat Lip\n\nStill Waiting\n\nThe Used from Orem, Utah was the second to last band to hit the stage. The Used was actually the second band in the post-hardcore genre, next to Escape the Fate, that truly helped me get into the scene as a whole. Their song “Blood On My Hands” was a staple in my middle school life and hearing them play it live was something I’ve waited to hear again for years. The Used started their set with an animation projected on a curtain with a dramatic curtain drop going into their first song “Take It Away”. Once the curtain dropped, it was a spectacle of a set, with LED screens behind the drummer, smoke machines, and the infamous heart hanging from the ceiling. They not only set the scene with special effects but with a setlist that matched the whole look and feel. This four piece consists of vocalist Bert McCracken, bassist Jeph Howard, drummer Dan Whitesides, and guitarist Joey Bradford. Bert McCracken was like a little kid on stage. He was living his’ extra life on that stage and his’ positive energy truly radiated throughout the entire Amphitheatre. The Used is one of the top bands in the genre and it is apparent as to why, they demolish any stage they step foot on. I cannot wait to see them again next time they’re out here!\n\nSETLIST\n\nTake It Away\n\nThe Bird and the Worm\n\nListening\n\nAll That I’ve Got\n\nI Caught Fire\n\nWonderwall (Oasis Cover)\n\nBuried Myself Alive\n\nThe Taste of Ink\n\nBlood On My Hands\n\nPretty Handsome Awkward\n\nA Box Full of Sharp Objects\n\nClosing out the night was Thrice who were playing their hometown in Irvine, CA. This band has accumulated a large arsenal of music over their 20-year career, releasing 10 albums over that time. They showcased songs from several of those releases in their 11-song set. Thrice’s sound can best be described as a mixture of post-hardcore, progressive metal, experimental rock, and alternative rock. Their set was very atmospheric, with very colorful lighting and smoke to match. This four piece consists of vocalist and rhythm guitarist Dustin Kensrue, lead guitarist Teppei Teranishi, bassist Eddie Breckenridge, and drummer Riley Breckenridge. I was not only impressed by their musical talents, but their whole aesthetics and stage presentation made their performance into a full on spectacle. There is no doubt why Thrice is still one of the biggest bands in the scene. They leave everything out on the stage and blew me away. I actually wound up ordering 4 of their CDs after watching their set. I was thoroughly impressed by Thrice and they were a perfect way to close out the Rockstar Disrupt Festival.\n\nSETLIST\n\nYellow Belly\n\nThe Artist In The Ambulance\n\nOnly Us\n\nUnder a Killing Moon\n\nJust Breathe\n\nOf Dust and Nations\n\nIn Exile\n\nDeeper Wells\n\nBeggars\n\nBlack Honey\n\nThe Earth Will Shake\n\nThe Rockstar Disrupt Festival was an amazing festival that gave the best of both worlds, a festival vibe and an amphitheater vibe all in one. I was so happy to check so many bands off my bucketlist to photograph all in one day. The bands truly went above and beyond and so did Rockstar for putting this whole festival together. I cannot wait to attend again next year!

I went to the Vans Warped Tour yearly with my Dad from 2011 – 2018 so seeing the Five Point Amphitheater with merch tents and a Rockstar booth, I felt like a new tradition starting that still held close ties to the previous one. The Rockstar Disrupt Festival had two tiers of bands: the festival stage bands and the main stage bands. On my date, however, all of the bands played on the same stage. So, the festival stage bands were treated like Kings and Queens for a day.\n\nI unfortunately missed Hyro the Hero, due to a family emergency, but arrived just in time to catch Juliet Simms. Juliet Simms was in a few bands but really hit it big once she competed on the reality competition show “The Voice” where she placed second. Since then, she has garnered a large following, especially in the Warped Tour and alternative scenes, which lead to her signing to Sumerian Records in 2019. She has released 3 albums over her career, which she showcased in her 6-song set. Juliet pleasantly surprised me with her stage presence and vocal style. I would describe her musical style as a mixture of alternative rock, indie rock, and pop rock. Her vocals are very raspy, and I was thoroughly impressed. I was slightly getting some Janis Joplin vibes. Her backing band consisted of drummer Lindsay Martin, guitarist Evan Potter, and bassist Justus Dixon. Juliet put her heart on that stage, and I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.\n\nSETLIST\n\n100 Little Deaths\n\nSay Hello\n\nTrouble Finds You\n\nTake Me\n\nWild Child\n\nBad Love\n\nNext up was Memphis May Fire from Denton, Texas. Memphis May Fire is one of the first bands I got into when I was getting more into metalcore. When I found out that I would finally be photographing them, I was ecstatic to say the least. Memphis May Fire brought out songs from five of their six albums for their set, showcasing how diverse of a band they are. I personally got to photograph them during one of my favorite songs in their entire discography “Prove Me Right” from their 2012 release “Challenger”, which is still the bands bestselling record to date, reaching 16 on the top 200 Billboard Charts. Memphis May Fire would best be described as on the border between metalcore and post-hardcore, with some songs more on the hard rock side. The current lineup consists of vocalist Matty Mullens, lead guitarist Kellen McGregor, bassist Cory Elder, drummer Jake Garland, and touring rhythm guitarist Samuel Penner. Not only does Memphis May Fire truly slay in terms of sound, their stage presence was insane. I always love seeing Memphis May Fire and am so glad I finally got the chance to photograph them!\n\nSETLIST\n\nThe Old Me\n\nProve Me Right\n\nCarry On\n\nNo Ordinary Love\n\nHeavy Is The Weight\n\nVices\n\nThe Sinner\n\nThe next band up was Four Year Strong from Worcester, Massachusetts. Their sound is commonly referred to as “Easycore”, as they mix pop punk with post-hardcore and melodic hardcore. Coming on after Memphis May Fire would be hard for many bands to top. But, despite not moving to much, no one could deny Four Year Strong’s sound was truly amazing that day. They played four songs from their 2010 album “Enemy of the World”, which is still their bestselling album to date. Along with those four songs, they played two songs from their 2015 self-titled album “Four Year Strong”, two songs from their 2007 album “Rise or Die Trying”, and one from their 2014 EP “Go Down In History”. This band has had a long history in the scene, and the reason for their popularity is shown through their catchy music with riff-heavy melodic verses and choruses mixed with breakdowns. I have lived for Four Year Strong for years and am so glad to see them still going strong.\n\nSETLIST\n\nManiac (R.O.D.)\n\nGo Down In History\n\nHeroes Get Remembered, Legends Never Die\n\nWhat the Hell is a Gigawatt?\n\nWho Cares?\n\nFind My Way Back\n\nIt Must Really Suck To Be Four Year Strong Right Now\n\nWe All Float Down Here\n\nWasting Time (Eternal Summer)\n\nAndy Black came up to the stage next. Andy Black is also known as Andy Biersack or as his previous stage name “Andy Six”. I used to listen to his band Black Veil Brides almost religiously, but even though I don’t listen to them anymore, I was looking forward to seeing what he had to offer in a solo performance. While Black Veil Brides’ sound centers around hard rock and heavy metal, Andy’s solo music is a good mixture of alternative rock, pop rock, and synth pop. Andy played a 7-song setlist, showcasing songs from his’ two albums “The Ghost of Ohio”, which was released in 2019 via Republic Records, and “The Shadow Side” which was released in 2016 via Republic Records. He also played a Billy Idol cover, which was pretty cool to hear. During the first song of his’ set, Andy went into the crowd and hi fived a bunch of the crowd members. It was cool to see him interacting with fans and truly engaging with the crowd. The support band behind him consists of drummer Sage Webber, bassist Niles Gibbs, and guitarist Lonny Eagleton. Although I am not the biggest Andy Black fan in the world, I was still thoroughly impressed by his’ showmanship and his musical style!\n\nSETLIST\n\nRibcage\n\nThey Don’t Need To Understand\n\nStay Alive\n\nWestwood Road\n\nDancing With Myself (Billy Idol Cover)\n\nGhost of Ohio\n\nWe Don’t Have To Dance\n\nClosing out the Festival Stage was Sleeping With Sirens from Orlando, Florida. Sleeping With Sirens, like Memphis May Fire, was one of the first bands I got into in the scene. I fell in love with their post-hardcore style and unique vocals courtesy of Kellin Quinn. The rest of this very talented band consists of drummer Gabe Barham, guitarists Jack Fowler and Nick Martin, and bassist Justin Hills. The band played a 7-song set, filled with fan favorites and 2 songs off their upcoming album “How It Feels To Be Lost”, which will be released via Sumerian Records on September 6th, 2019. One thing Sleeping With Sirens delivers consistently is a stellar performance. They are extremely tight as a band and are extremely high energy. They utilize every inch of the stage and truly slay. Sleeping With Sirens also delivers on sounding even better live. They are already stellar on record, but that unbeatable energy drives each song further and engraves that live experience into the brains of their viewers. It truly brought me back to how I felt when I first discovered their music years and years back. I loved their set and believe they were the perfect band to close out the festival stage.\n\nSETLIST\n\nKick Me\n\nDo It Now, Remember It Later\n\nLeave It All Behind\n\nBetter Off Dead\n\nBreak Me Down\n\nIf I’m James Dean, You’re Audrey Hepburn\n\nIf You Can’t Hang\n\nThe festival stage bands on the Rockstar Disrupt Festival showcased a variety of bands of many different styles that meshed beautifully. It truly set the stage for the main stage bands to come. I was truly excited to see bands like Sleeping With Sirens and Memphis May Fire again, and to finally photograph them, so it was a dream come true.\n\nSleeping With Sirens | Andy Black | Four Year Strong | Memphis May Fire | Juliet Simms\n\nPhotos + Review courtesy of Jamie Kaufman | Instagram\n\nKeep up with us on social media!
