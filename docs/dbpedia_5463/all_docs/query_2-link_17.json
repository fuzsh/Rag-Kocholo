Let’s go!\n\nWhat Is an Email Subject Line?\n\nAn email subject line is a brief preview or a one-line summary of the content of an email that appears in the inbox. The best email subject lines grab readers’ attention, provide value to the recipient, and encourage them to open the email.\n\nHere is an email marketing subject line example.\n\nIt is usually the subject line that determines whether a reader would open your email or ignore it.\n\nWhy Is a Good Email Subject Line Important?\n\n47% of email recipients open an email based on the subject line alone. At the same time, 69% of email recipients report emails as spammy based solely on the subject line.\n\nIn other words: your subject lines can make or break your email marketing campaigns.\n\nBy using good email subject lines, you can increase open rates, which can help improve click-through rates and conversions.\n\nEmail marketing subject lines are important for several other reasons as well, such as:\n\nGrabbing Attention: Subject lines are the first thing recipients see when they receive an email, and they play a crucial role in grabbing their attention and encouraging them to open the email.\n\nSetting Expectations: Subject lines also set expectations for the content of the email. A well-crafted subject line should give the recipient an idea of the email and what they can expect to find inside.\n\nAvoiding Spam Filters: Certain words and phrases can trigger spam filters, causing your email to be marked as spam and potentially end up in the recipient’s spam folder or not being delivered at all. Crafting subject lines that avoid these trigger words and phrases ensures deliverability.\n\nHigher Open Rates: An engaging subject line can significantly increase the recipient’s likelihood of opening the email. This is especially important in email marketing campaigns, where open rates often measure the campaign’s success.\n\nEncouraging Engagement: Subject lines can also encourage engagement with the email’s content. A catchy email subject line can entice the recipient to read further, click on links, or take other desired actions.\n\nThe subject line is the first impression that the recipient will have of the email. It’s important to make it count.\n\nLet’s see 184+ catchy email subject line examples and the proven principles that make them work.\n\n184 Best Email Subject Lines (and Why They Work)!\n\nFOMO (Fear of Missing Out) Email Subject Lines\n\nOne psychological principle that is practically impossible to resist is FOMO, the fear of missing out. You can use this fear in your subject lines by adding an element of scarcity (limited availability) or urgency (limited time).\n\nEmail subject lines that include words that imply time sensitivity, like “urgent”, “breaking”, “important” or “alert” are proven to increase email open rates.\n\nHere are some great sample subject lines for emails that use the fear of missing out:\n\nWarby Parker: “Uh-oh, your prescription is expiring”\n\nJetBlue: “You’re missing out on points.”\n\nDigital Marketer: “[URGENT] You’ve got ONE DAY to watch this…”\n\nDigital Marketer: “Your 7-figure plan goes bye-bye at midnight…”\n\nDigital Marketer: “[WEEKEND ONLY] Get this NOW before it’s gone…”\n\nJersey Mike’s Subs: “Mary, Earn double points today only”\n\nGuess: “Tonight only: A denim lover’s dream”\n\nCuriosity Inducing Email Subject Lines\n\nHumans have a natural desire for closure. We don’t like having gaps in our knowledge. You can leverage this desire for closure by leaving your subject line open-ended so subscribers will be curious, like a cliffhanger that can only be satisfied by opening the email.\n\nYou can make subscribers curious by asking a question, promising something interesting, or simply saying something that sounds strange or unusual.\n\nHere are some great examples of curiosity-inducing subject lines:\n\nManicube: “*Don’t Open This Email*”\n\nGrubHub: “Last Day To See What This Mystery Email Is All About”\n\nRefinery29: “10 bizarre money habits making Millennials richer”\n\nDigital Marketer: “Check out my new “man cave” [PICS]”\n\nDigital Marketer: “Is this the hottest career in marketing?”\n\nThrillist: “What They Eat In Prison”\n\nEat This Not That: “9 Disgusting Facts about Thanksgiving”\n\nChubbies: “Hologram Shorts?!”\n\nThe Hustle: “A faster donkey”\n\nMary Fernandez: “? a surprise gift for you! {unwrap}”\n\nFunny Email Subject Lines\n\nIf your subject line makes your subscribers laugh, they must open it. After all, have you ever read a subject line that tickled your funny bone and didn’t read it?\n\nBeing humorous and catchy requires more thought and creativity, but it can pay off in terms of your open rates.\n\nHere are some funny email subject lines to make your subscribers laugh:\n\nEater Boston: “Where to Drink Beer Right Now” (Sent at 6:45am on a Wednesday.)\n\nOpenTable: “Licking your phone never tasted so good”\n\nGroupon: “Deals That Make Us Proud (Unlike Our Nephew, Steve)”\n\nThe Muse: “We Like Being Used”\n\nWarby Parker: “Pairs nicely with spreadsheets”\n\nUncommonGoods: “As You Wish” (A reference to the movie The Princess Bride.)\n\nTravelocity: “Need a day at the beach? Just scratch n’ sniff your way to paradise…”\n\nTicTail: “Boom shakalak! Let’s get started.”\n\nThrillist: “Try To Avoid These 27 People On New Year’s Eve”\n\nBaby Bump: “Yes, I’m Pregnant. You Can Stop Staring At My Belly Now.”\n\nGozengo: “NEW! Vacation on Mars”\n\nThe Hustle: “Look what you did, you little jerk…” (This one’s a reference to the movie Home Alone. We hope.)\n\nVanity Appealing Email Subject Lines\n\nEveryone has a bit of vanity. People love to be liked, accepted, and even revered by others. It’s just a part of being human.\n\nThat’s why some of the most clever subject lines use vanity to get you to open the email. To do this, you can either promise something that makes the subscriber look better to their peers or invoke the fear of being shamed.\n\nHere are some great examples of clever email subject lines that leverage vanity:\n\nGuess: “Don’t wear last year’s styles.”\n\nFabletics: “Your Butt Will Look Great in These Workout Pants”\n\nJeremy Gitomer: “How Have You Progressed Since the Third Grade?”\n\nRapha: “Gift inspiration for the discerning cyclist”\n\nLa Mer: “Age-defying beauty tricks”\n\nPop Physique: “Get Ready. Keep the Pie Off Your Thighs Returns.”\n\nRapha: “As worn in the World Tour”\n\nSephora: “Products the celebs are wearing”\n\nGreedy Email Subject Lines\n\nYou may not think of yourself as a “greedy” person, but it can be tough to pass up a great deal, even if you don’t need the item right now. That’s why sales, discounts, and special offers work well in your subject lines.\n\nHowever, be careful about offering massive discounts; the higher the percentage, the less reliable its effect on your open rates (perhaps because consumers don’t believe large discounts are real).\n\nRegardless, you can usually expect an increase in click-through rates whenever you offer a discount in your subject line. That’s because the people who open these emails are interested in your offer, so they’re naturally inclined to click.\n\nHere are some great email subject line ideas for hitting your subscriber’s “greed” button:\n\nTopshop: “Meet your new jeans”\n\nTopshop: “Get a head start on summer”\n\nHP: “Flash. Sale. Alert.”\n\nHP: “New must-haves for your office”\n\nSeafolly: “A new product you won’t pass on”\n\nGuess: “25% off your favorites”\n\nRip Curl: “Two for two”\n\nLa Mer: “A little luxury at a great price”\n\nRapha: “Complimentary gift wrap on all purchases”\n\nThe Black Tux: “Get priority access.”\n\nCatchy Email Subject Lines\n\nCatchy email subject lines create excitement and encourage readers to open the email.\n\nThere are many different ways to grab your readers’ attention. For example, you can create an attention-grabbing catchy email subject line by being controversial, confident, or conversational.\n\nYou can also give readers an easier way to achieve their goals by offering a shortcut or a helpful resource (e.g., a lead magnet) that saves time and energy.\n\nHere are a few catchy email subject line examples that capture the readers’ attention in one way or another.\n\nSyed from OptinMonster: “✔ 63-Point Checklist for Creating the Ultimate Optin Form”\n\nSyed from OptinMonster: “Grow your email list 10X ⚡ faster with these 30 content upgrade ideas”\n\nRamit Sethi: “How to email a busy person (including a word-for-word script)”\n\nDigital Marketer: “Steal these email templates…”\n\nDigital Marketer: “A Native Ad in 60 Minutes or Less”\n\nDigital Marketer: “212 blog post ideas“\n\nCustomer Pain Points Email Subject Lines\n\nIf you understand your buyer persona, you should know their biggest pain points. Use those pain points to get subscribers to open your emails by solving that problem.\n\nHere are some examples of email subject lines that bring out the subscriber’s pain points and offer a solution:\n\nPizza Hut: “Feed your guests without breaking the bank”\n\nIKEA: “Where do all these toys go?”\n\nIKEA: “Get more kitchen space with these easy fixes”\n\nHP: “Stop wasting money on ink”\n\nSephora: “Your beauty issues, solved”\n\nUber: “Since we can’t all win the lottery…”\n\nThrillist: “How to Survive Your Next Overnight Flight”\n\nGuess: “Wanted: Cute and affordable fashions”\n\nEvernote: “Stop wasting time on mindless work”\n\nDuolingo: “Learn a language with only 5 minutes per day”\n\nRetargeting Email Subject Lines\n\nRetargeting emails are sent to subscribers when they fail to complete an action or a step in your sales funnel (e.g., when they abandon their cart or fail to purchase after their free trial). These emails serve to bring your subscribers back to your sales process.\n\nYou can write effective retargeting subject lines by overcoming objections, offering something to sweeten the deal, or alerting them that something bad will happen if they don’t take action.\n\nHere are some excellent examples of retargeting email subject lines:\n\nNick Stephenson: “How you can afford Your First 10,000 Readers (closing tonight)”\n\nBonobos: “Hey, forget something? Here’s 20% off.”\n\nTarget: “The price dropped for something in your cart”\n\nSyed from Envira: “Mary, your Envira account is on hold!”\n\nSyed from Envira: “I’m deleting your Envira account”\n\nUgmonk: “Offering you my personal email”\n\nAnimoto: “Did you miss out on some of these new features?”\n\nPinterest: “Good News: Your Pin’s price dropped!”\n\nUnroll.Me: “⚠ Unroll.Me has stopped working”\n\nVivino: “We are not gonna Give Up on You!”\n\nPersonalized Email Subject Lines\n\nEmail subject lines that use personalization by including a name boost open rates by 10-14% across industries.\n\nBut including your subscriber’s name is only one way to make personalized subject lines. You can also use casual language, share something personal, or use copy that implies familiarity or friendship.\n\nHere are some examples of personal email subject lines that work:\n\nGuess: “Mary, check out these hand-picked looks”\n\nRent the Runway: “Happy Birthday Mary – Surprise Inside!”\n\nBonnie Fahy: “Mary, do you remember me?”\n\nKimra Luna: “I didn’t see your name in the comments!?”\n\nJohn Lee Dumas: “Are you coming?”\n\nUrbanDaddy: “You’ve Changed”\n\nInfluitive: “So I’ll pick you up at 7?”\n\nJames Malinchak: “Crazy Invitation, I am Going to Buy You Lunch…”\n\nBrooklinen: “Vanilla or Chocolate?”\n\nSam from The Hustle: “I love you”\n\nRyan Levesque: “Seriously, Who DOES This?”\n\nJon Morrow: “Quick favor?”\n\nMary Fernandez: “you free this Thurs at 12PM PST? [guest blogging class]”\n\nMary Fernandez: “? your detailed results…”\n\nSyed from OptinMonster: “300% increase in revenue with a single optin + a neat growth trick from my mastermind!”\n\nRevolution Tea: “Thanks for helping us”\n\nHarry’s: “Two razors for your friends (on us)”\n\nStraightforward Email Subject Lines\n\nWhen in doubt, make your subject line simple. Contrary to what you might think, these “boring” subject lines can convert well.\n\nThe key to making this work for your list is consistently providing value in your emails. Only send an email if you have something important to say: always make sure your campaigns are packed with value. If you do this, you’ll train your subscribers to open your emails no matter what the subject line says.\n\nFor help with writing better emails, check out our post on 19 quick and dirty tricks for writing better emails.\n\nHere are a few examples of email marketing subject lines that get straight to the point:\n\nAl Franken: “Yes, this is a fundraising email”\n\nAYR: “Best coat ever”\n\nBarack Obama: “Hey”\n\nAnd these “boring” subject lines performed the highest out of 40 million emails, with open rates between 60-87%.\n\n“[Company Name] Sales & Marketing Newsletter”\n\n“Eye on the [Company Name] Update (Oct 31 – Nov 4)”\n\n“[Company Name] Staff Shirts & Photos”\n\n“[Company Name] May 2005 News Bulletin!”\n\n“[Company Name] Newsletter – February 2006”\n\n“[Company Name] and [Company Name] Invites You!”\n\n“Happy Holidays from [Company Name]”\n\n“Invitation from [Company Name]”\n\nSales Email Subject Lines\n\nSales email subject lines are specifically crafted to promote and sell a product or service to potential customers.\n\nThese subject lines grab the recipient’s attention and create a sense of urgency or exclusivity. They often use phrases like “limited time,” “exclusive offer,” or “sneak peek” to entice the recipient to open the email and take advantage of the promotion.\n\nThey often include a clear call to action, such as “Shop now” or “Learn more,” to encourage the recipient to take action and purchase.\n\nHere are a few examples of effective sales email subject lines that work very well:\n\n“Limited time offer: Get 20% off your first purchase!”\n\n“Don’t miss out on our biggest sale of the year!”\n\n“Sneak peek: Introducing our newest product line”\n\n“Upgrade your [product/service] and save 10%”\n\n“Exclusive offer: Buy one, get one free!”\n\nNewsletter Email Subject Lines\n\nNewsletter email subject lines are used to promote and share regular updates, news, or information with subscribers.\n\nNewsletters, often sent regularly, such as weekly or monthly, are intended to keep subscribers engaged and informed about the latest developments related to the brand or industry.\n\nHere are a few examples of newsletter email subject lines:\n\n“Stay in the know: Our monthly newsletter is here!”\n\n“5 must-read articles for this week”\n\n“New product announcement: Be the first to know”\n\n“Your weekly dose of inspiration and motivation”\n\n“Exclusive content: Subscribe to our newsletter for access”\n\nLearn more about newsletters in the following articles:\n\nHow To Create An Email Newsletter in 5 EASY Steps\n\n27 Awesome Newsletter Ideas That Will Keep Subscribers Engaged\n\nFollow-up Email Subject Lines\n\nFollow-up email subject lines are used to remind or follow up with a recipient after an initial email has been sent. They are often used for cold emails in sales or networking situations, where a prompt response is needed to close a deal or establish a relationship.\n\nHere are a few examples of follow-up email subject lines that work:\n\n“Quick follow-up on our meeting”\n\n“Just wanted to touch base on [topic]”\n\n“Checking in on your progress”\n\n“Friendly reminder: [Action needed]”\n\n“Don’t miss out: Last chance to [offer]”\n\nCold Email Subject Lines\n\nCold email subject lines are used to outreach prospects or potential customers.

They often use phrases like “introducing,” “would you be interested,” or “let’s chat” to communicate the purpose of the email in a friendly and non-invasive manner.\n\nThey often include a clear value proposition or a statement of how the sender can help the recipient further establish the potential benefits of engaging with the email.\n\nHere are a few examples of cold email subject lines:\n\n“Introducing [Product/Service] – A solution to your [problem]”\n\n“Would you be interested in [Value proposition]?”\n\n“Can we help you achieve [Goal]?”\n\n“Let’s chat about [Topic]”\n\n“Reaching out to explore a potential partnership”\n\nTop Email Subject Line Keywords\n\nMany studies have analyzed the effectiveness of using specific email subject line keywords. Use these keywords to boost your open rates even further when crafting your email copy and subject lines.\n\nAccording to Alchemy Worx, which analyzed 21 billion emails sent by 2,500 brands, the top five most effective subject line keywords were:\n\n“upgrade”\n\n“just”\n\n“content”\n\n“go”\n\n“wonderful”\n\nIn another study from Alchemy Worx, which analyzed 24.6 billion emails, the top subject line keywords for open rates were:\n\n“jokes”\n\n“promotional”\n\n“congratulations”\n\n“revision”\n\n“forecast”\n\n“snapshot”\n\n“token”\n\n“voluntary”\n\n“monthly”\n\n“deduction”\n\nBased on Digital Marketer’s analysis of 125 million emails, some top subject line keywords to try are:\n\n“free”\n\n“ICYMI”\n\n“$ today, $$$ tomorrow”\n\nnumbers (e.g. “7-figure plan”, “212 ideas”, “60 minutes or less”)\n\n[brackets] (e.g. “[EMAIL MARKETERS] $95 today, $995 tomorrow,” “[In Case You Missed It] Our best-performing blog post of all time,” “[NAME’s Last Reminder] Up to 90% off our best-selling products gone in 3…2…1…”)\n\nAdestra analyzed over 2.2 billion emails and found the following top subject line keywords:\n\n“free delivery”\n\n“available”\n\n“new”\n\n“alert”\n\n“news”\n\n“update”\n\n“summer”\n\n“weekend”\n\nIn another study from Adestra, which looked at over 125K email campaigns, the top-performing subject line keywords were:\n\n“thank you”\n\n“*|*|*|*|” (i.e. a subject line that has multiple stories delineated by pipes.

This can increase open rates and engagement.\n\nAvoid Spam Trigger Words: Avoid using words that are commonly associated with spam, such as “cash,” “earn money,” “free,” or “act now.” These can trigger spam filters and cause your email to be marked as spam, ultimately affecting your email deliverability. This applies to both the subject line and the body of the email.\n\nBe Clear and Specific: Your subject line should indicate the content and purpose of the email. Avoid vague or overly general subject lines that don’t give the recipient a good idea of what to expect.\n\nUse Action-Oriented Language: Use strong verbs and action-oriented language to create a sense of urgency and encourage the recipient to take action. This can include words like “limited time offer,” “urgent,” “today only,” or “ending soon.”\n\nUse Personalization: Include the recipient’s name or other personalized information to make the email more relevant and personalized.\n\nKeep A/B Testing: A/B test different subject lines to see what works best for your audience. Try different lengths, formats, and styles to see what resonates with your subscribers.\n\nCommon Mistakes To Avoid in Email Subject Lines\n\nWhen you’re creating that perfect email subject line, try to avoid the following mistakes:\n\nUsing Clickbait or Deceptive Language: Avoid using misleading or exaggerated language to entice the recipient to open the email.\n\nUsing All Caps or Excessive Punctuation: Using all caps or excessive punctuation can make the subject line appear spammy and turn off recipients.\n\nMaking False Promises: Only promise something in the subject line delivered in the email’s body.\n\nBeing Too Vague or Generic: Make sure the subject line is specific and provides value to the recipient.\n\n3 Bonus Tips for Crafting Catchy Email Subject Lines\n\nBefore choosing a subject line at random, remember these tips for the highest possible open rates.\n\n1. Most People Open Emails on Mobile\n\nRegardless of which of the above techniques you use, make sure your subject line is optimized for mobile users.\n\nWhile mobile access to email saw a dip at the end of 2018, it’s still the preferred way people access their email.\n\nYou can use free marketing tools like Zurb’s TestSubject to see how your subject line will appear on various popular mobile devices.\n\n2. Originality is Key\n\nAlso, remember that being original is the key to sustainable success with your email subject lines.\n\nThe truth is subscribers get bored easily. If you want to engage first-time openers and long-term inactive subscribers, you don’t want them to read your subject line and think, “There’s that weekly newsletter again that I always ignore.”\n\nYou should keep things fresh and exciting. And writing good subject lines for emails is the best way to do that.\n\n3. Try Out Emojis\n\nAccording to a report by Experian, using emojis in your subject lines can increase your open rates by 45%.\n\nWe’ve also been testing this at OptinMonster, and we can confirm that the email subject lines with emojis beat the plain text ones!\n\nHere are the top 15 emojis by subject line appearance.\n\nThese aren’t necessarily the “best” ones but the most popular. You can get creative with emojis and emoji combinations for your email subject lines.\n\nThat’s it! We hope you found these 184 best subject lines for emails helpful in creating your next subject line. If you did, consider downloading the cheat sheet, so you can always have this guide handy.\n\nEmail subject lines are critical to any email marketing campaign, especially for those in the eCommerce industry.
