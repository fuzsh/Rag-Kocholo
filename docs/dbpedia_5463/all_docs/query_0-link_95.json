        "text": "Highland Square porches will once again be the stages for local musical acts when PorchRokr takes over the neighborhood for the 12th year Saturday, Aug. 17.\n\nThe annual outdoor music festival will feature performances from more than 150 artists across 37 stages, playing everything from math rock and rockabilly to experimental funk and electric blues.\n\n“We try to be as Akron-centric as possible when we’re picking those bands. I would say a good 95% of them are from Akron at least,” said Cody Stanley, a volunteer with the Highland Square Neighborhood Association, the group that produces PorchRokr.\n\nThe music starts at 11 a.m., and each act will play an hour-long set. This year’s headliner, Free Black, will perform at 7:30 p.m. on the main stage — located in the parking lot behind I Promise HealthQuarters at 527 W. Market St.\n\nWhile music is PorchRokr’s main draw, the event will also feature more than 100 vendors, as well as food trucks and tents, a photo booth, live demonstrations from Akron Glass Works and karaoke in the beer garden.\n\nStanley’s go-to karaoke song? “Piano Man” by Billy Joel.\n\n“I’m not gonna toot my own horn, but I did kill it,” he said, referring to his karaoke performance at last year’s festival.\n\nThose who would rather watch karaoke than perform can enjoy a pint of Kölschrokr, the festival’s signature beer created by the Cincinnati brewery Rhinegeist.\n\nParents of little ones can stop by the Kids Zone on Hawthorne Avenue for activities from Summit Metro Parks, PBS Kids and Akron Children’s Museum.\n\nEarly risers can start their PorchRokr experience with a free outdoor yoga class at 9:30 a.m. at The Merriman (209 Merriman Road), courtesy of Yoga Squared. More of a night owl? Stick around after the music ends for a silent disco at 9 p.m. at House Three Thirty. Headsets will be available to rent for $5.\n\nAttendees are welcome to bring chairs and blankets to the event, which takes place rain or shine. Stanley also encourages people to bring reusable water bottles to refill at hydration stations throughout the festival. Parking is tight on a normal day in Highland Square, and even more so during events. Stanley recommends attendees carpool, use Uber or Lyft, bike or take the METRO RTA, which is free this month on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nUnited Disability Services will also provide shuttle service around the festival, Stanley said.\n\nStanley said the event is still in need of volunteers, especially in the beer tent. Those interested in helping should fill out PorchRokr’s volunteer sign-up form.\n\nCheck out PorchRokr’s complete lineup below.
