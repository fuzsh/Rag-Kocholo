        "text": "Pop-punk outfit New Found Glory have a lot going on this year. In a few months they will be releasing a new covers album From the Screen to Your Stereo 3, out May 3, and will be embarking on a tour.\n\nThey released the first song from the upcoming album, \"The Power of Love\" from Back To The Future. Watch the video here. They also recently released \"This Is Me\" from The Greatest Showman, which you can check out here.\n\nThe tour, dubbed From the Screen to Your Town tour, will include support from Real Friends, The Early November and Doll Skin and will kick off May 30 in Charleston, S.C. See all of the dates here.\n\nIn honor of their upcoming endeavors, we asked New Found Glory decided to rank their favorite pop-punk songs from movie soundtracks. The band have had the honor of being featured on movie soundtracks several times, so you may see some familiar tunes on the list. See drummer Cyrus Bolooki's picks below:\n\n10. Clockstoppers (2002)\n\n“The Minute I Met You” — New Found Glory\n\nThis was the first time we specifically wrote a song to be released for a movie. This was a fun song to record as we got to work with once again with Neal Avron (who produced our first three major-label records) and record in a legendary studio in Miami (Criteria Records) and use a song that we thought would never see the light of day.\n\n9. The Benchwarmers (2006)\n\n“Hit or Miss” — New Found Glory\n\nYes, we’re on this list twice with the same song (see below), but why not? Besides, our music got to be played in a scene with the legendary Reggie Jackson, and I know that makes Ian [Grushka, bassist], who is an avid baseball collector, proud!\n\n8. Dude, Where’s My Car (2000)\n\n“Playmate Of The Year” — Zebrahead\n\nI’m sure everyone thinks of “Right Now” by SR-71 or “Little Things” by Good Charlotte when they think of this movie, but to me one of the best songs on this soundtrack (and one of the best songs in Zebrahead’s catalog) is “Playmate Of The Year.”\n\n7. Not Another Teen Movie (2001)\n\n“If You Leave” — Good Charlotte\n\nThis movie is just all Good Charlotte, isn’t it? They’re on the soundtrack and they appear in the movie. I’m sure in 2001 every high school kid dreamed of having Good Charlotte play their prom!\n\n6. Spiderman 2 (2004)\n\n“Vindicated” — Dashboard Confessional\n\nI know this is supposed to be a pop-punk list, but I’ve got no problem including our great friend Chris Carrabba on this list. It was awesome to see (and hear) a track from our hometown friend and tourmate basically become the theme to this movie and still to this day be one of his biggest hits.\n\n5. Clueless (1995)\n\n“Where’d You Go?” — The Mighty Mighty Bosstones\n\nI remember seeing this movie and thinking that it was so awesome that a punk band was not only on the soundtrack, but actually in the movie. I think it was only a few weeks before the release of this movie that I was at a club in South Florida watching the Bosstones perform, and I ended up catching one of their drumsticks after the show—something that I still have to this day!\n\n4. Eurotrip (2004)\n\n“Scotty Doesn’t Know” — Lustra\n\nThis has to be the most famous soundtrack song by a band that practically no one had ever heard of before…and still probably doesn’t know. Honestly, I didn’t even know the name of this band until I looked it up, but the song was undeniably (if not annoyingly) catchy.\n\n3. American Pie (1999)\n\n“Mutt” — Blink-182\n\nThis is the movie that made pop-punk soundtracks become a household thing, and I’m sure every kid from that day remembers not only the movie, but the fact that Blink-182 made a cameo in the film. It set the bar for pop-punk movie soundtracks for the next few years to come.\n\n2. American Pie 2 (2001)\n\n“Hit or Miss” — New Found Glory\n\nAlthough we weren’t on the actual soundtrack, this was the first time our music appeared in a movie, and I remember all of us, while on tour, going to some random theater in the middle of nowhere in Colorado to watch the movie. I remember being blown away when the opening chords to “Hit or Miss” starting playing right after one of the most pivotal scenes in the movie. You can be sure that we stayed in the theater long enough to see our names in the credits, and then just sit there to ponder how crazy it was that we actually had our names on the big screen!\n\n1. Angus (1995)\n\n“J.A.R.” — Green Day\n\nOne of the first truly pop-punk (or at least “cool”) soundtracks in my day, this is the one started it all for me. I remember being so excited to know there was a new Green Day song out, but also being so confused as to why I could only find it on a movie soundtrack."
