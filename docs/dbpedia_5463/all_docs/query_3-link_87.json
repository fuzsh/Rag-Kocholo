        "text": "Punk: Beginnings\n\nPunk Rock developed out of the aggressive and musically minimal styles of groups such as Iggy Pop and the Stooges, MC5, and the themes of alienation and anger of groups such as the Velvet Underground. Punk is characterized by the “garage band” sound. Tempos are often fast and erratic, vocals are often shouted or speech-like, with little indication of traditional melody (often on one pitch, known as monotone), the guitars are distorted, and most often the songs are based on 3 or 4 simple chords rather than riffs or melodic hooks. These chords themselves are usually simple 2-note chords known as “Power Chords” for the simple yet strong sound. Power chords are the musical building blocks of punk rock much in the way riffs were the musical building blocks of heavy metal and hard rock.\n\nBeyond purely musical characteristics, Punk Rock is associated with a feeling of “Authenticity”, where the performers are trying to be as real as possible, without shame or censorship. This was the new generation’s way of continuing the tradition of rock & roll risk taking and danger. Remember, musicians like Elvis and Little Richard were innovators that were considered dangerous at the time they came out. Rock and Roll by the early 1970s was viewed by many punk rockers as complacent and bloated, fake, a big business that had little to do with its origins. Punk sought to bring the real and the dangerous back to the stage. Groups like the Velvet Underground accomplished this with the content of their music, singing about drug use, taboo sexual tendencies, and prostitution on their groundbreaking debut album Velvet Underground and Nico from 1967."
