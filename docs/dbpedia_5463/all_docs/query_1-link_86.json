        "text": "The Stampede Parade presented by Suncor is an iconic part of Calgary’s cultural identity. Since 1912, the Stampede Parade has served as the official kickoff of The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth. Each year, the Stampede Parade entertains our community with a showcase of colourful floats, majestic horses and the high-energy marching bands.\n\nIt's not just a parade marching down a street; it is a march through tradition, history and Calgary’s culture.\n\nJoin us on Friday, July 5, 2024! The Parade Prelude begins at 7:30 a.m. and Parade begins at 9 a.m.\n\nView Parade Route\n\nThe iconic Stampede Parade presented by Suncor returns on Friday, July 5, to kick off The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth.\n\nThe Calgary Stampede is honoured to announce that actor Owen Crow Shoe will lead the 2024 Stampede Parade as our Parade Marshall.\n\nCrow Shoe is from the Piikani Nation and Blood Tribe of the Blackfoot Confederacy. His acting career started on the set of the Oscar winning film, The Revenant, where he worked as a stunt rider. Since then, his roles have taken him across the country and around the world, including to California where he's currently filming Dream.\n\nThis summer Crow Shoe co-stars alongside 2022 Parade Marshal Kevin Costner in the movie Horizon: An American Saga, but on July 5 he'll be returning home to southern Alberta to kick off Stampede 2024.\n\nIn addition to leading the Parade, Crow Shoe will be part of the 2024 Calgary Stampede Powwow as a Master of Ceremonies. His voice will fill the Saddledome on July 7th and 8th as he announces competitors and guides the audience through an extraordinary day of competition.\n\nLearn More"
