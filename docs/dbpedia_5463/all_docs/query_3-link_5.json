        "text": "Back in the early aughts, pop-punk was largely homogenous: a sea of predominantly white men who took over the stages of Warped Tour in their black Converse, lamenting their ex-girlfriend or small-town existence with few exceptions. But 20 years later, the genre has shape-shifted and redefined itself — and it may be more omnipresent than ever.\n\nWhile pop-punk isn't necessarily at the forefront of mainstream music the way it was in the mid-2000s, it's undoubtedly permeating culture. Two of the biggest artists in 2023 — Olivia Rodrigo and SZA — incorporated the pop-punk playbook into their songs; Travis Barker has become a go-to collaborator for a slew of rising acts blurring genre lines; pop-punk stalwarts like blink-182, Fall Out Boy and Sum 41 are returning to the genre with massive albums and tours; and When We Were Young Fest continued leaning into the nostalgia of it all, while celebrating both legendary acts and newcomers.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of the new wave of pop-punk popularity is that it's no longer defined by white cisgender males. The genre has become a more inclusive place than ever, with some of the most interesting and impressive music coming from women or people of color. Bands like Meet Me @ The Altar, Magnolia Park and Pinkshift have been pivotal to making the scene more inclusive.\n\nAs pop-punk continues to evolve, what will it look like? How will it continue to take steps toward diversity and inclusion? GRAMMY.com invited several leaders and luminaries of the industry to discuss its current state, how it infiltrated the mainstream, and the genre's ever-growing community.\n\nQuotes from these interviews have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nWhat has 2023 meant for pop-punk?\n\nAda Juarez, Meet Me @ The Altar drummer: 2023 has been a great discovery year for pop-punk. Lots of pop-punk bands have been touring and playing festivals and getting their names put out there for new people to hear!\n\nSean Mackin, Yellowcard violinist: 2023 is maybe the biggest year for the genre. There are new bands that are inspiring and changing what music means to them – and it was strong enough to bring Yellowcard back from the afterlife, so for me personally it means a lot!\n\nJoe Horsham, Magnolia Park drummer: 2023 is a pretty good year for pop-punk because it's officially getting mainstream recognition, and I keep seeing more and more pop-punk bands getting on rock festivals. So the demand is high.\n\nLouis Posen, Hopeless Records founder: Pop-punk continues to be an important sub-genre in our community. In the 2000s, the community broke into the mainstream which expanded the community to a level where you can see now, in the most full circle way, the impact it had on fans then.\n\nMorgan Freed, Emo Nite co-founder: Who would have thought that 2023 meant anything for pop-punk 10 years ago? The fact that it's alive and well, growing and thriving with younger artists who've turned what their version of pop-punk is into their own, as well as bands we've loved forever either making a comeback, reuniting or throwing together new tours with newer artists, is remarkable and meaningful. It says a lot about where we are as a country, as a community and as people that are going through their teens now or have been alive long enough to see its return.\n\nBen Barlow, Neck Deep singer: 2023 was a great year to revitalize the genre and give it a platform for even more in 2024. We saw the return of blink-182, Green Day and Sum 41 releasing new music, as well as a whole bunch of smaller, up-and-coming artists doing good things, too.\n\nJon Foreman, Switchfoot singer: [It] feels like every decade or so a younger generation discovers the beautifully dissonant energy that we all loved when we were young — and pop-punk returns from the grave like a phoenix reborn. 2023 has felt like the crest of that wave, with guitars and drums finally ringing out loud and proud once again.\n\nIn 2023 pop-punk seemed to reach an even more ubiquitous level. How have you seen the genre regain relevance in recent years?\n\nJuarez: Pop-punk has been a genre that tends to come and go in mainstream society. These past few years I've seen pop-punk get really popular once again — especially with blink-182 having their comeback and festivals like Adjacent Fest, Riot Fest, and When We Were Young having such pop-punk-filled lineups. Not only that, but trailblazers like Travis Barker collaborating with artists outside of the pop-punk realm and introducing their listeners to a whole new sound bring a whole new generation of pop-punkers.\n\nTristan Torres, Magnolia Park guitarist: Pop-punk has been bubbling since 2020, especially because of Travis Barker collaborating with new artists like KennyHoopla. But now pop-punk is pretty much synonymous with rock/alternative. It seems to be the go-to move for even pop artists when they do a rock song, such as Demi Lovato.\n\nMackin: 2023 is really a culmination of listeners showcasing their passion and love for music. I think it's a time of celebration and healing after a couple of sheltered and dark years.\n\nJohnny Minardi, Head of Fueled By Ramen: Bands are having fun again and I think that's contagious. The tours are selling more tickets than ever even without gigantic mainstream hits.\n\nFefe Dobson, singer/songwriter: I saw that pop-punk was being championed and celebrated much more. It wasn't only musically through charting, but through fashion and culture.\n\nJohn Feldmann, singer/songwriter and producer: Hearing Fall Out Boy on Sirius[XM] Hits 1, selling out the When We Were Young Festival, watching the Punk Rock Museum blow up, seeing both blink-182, and Green Day have bigger live numbers than ever. it's undeniable!\n\nDayna Ghiraldi-Travers, Big Picture Media founder: For me personally, it never went away. I have been working with New Found Glory since 2014's Resurrection and with Neck Deep since 2012's Rain in July EP, and haven't stopped since. I do think the return of Tom [DeLonge] in blink-182 did a lot for the genre, but overall the genre has held its ground quite nicely over the last decade.\n\nBarlow: Nostalgia and youthful exuberance will always be a part of pop-punk. It's a broad spectrum in terms of the sound, the message and the subject matter, and so it appeals to people on a number of levels. [It] also maybe [has] something to do with rap, pop and electronic music taking inspiration from the genre allowing it to slowly filter into the mainstream.\n\nWhy do you think this music — whether old or new — is resonating so strongly again?\n\nJuarez: Old pop-punk never truly \"died\" or \"got old.\" We hear the iconic pop-punk songs we all loved growing up constantly in today's day and age! Personally, I spend a lot of my time listening to older pop-punk, such as blink-182, Green Day, and Simple Plan; even newer than those, like The Story So Far, Knuckle Puck, and Neck Deep. It never fails to send me through a whirlwind of emotions, happiness, angst, nostalgia. It's a great genre to feel different emotions, and that's why it'll never truly get old.\n\nMackin: Music does go through cycles, and we are in a really refreshing time where the energy and the angsty sort of nature just collide, and it feels new again.\n\nKennyHoopla, musician: History always repeats itself. On top of that, the world is going through a lot right now and pop-punk/emo music has resembled that. People are naturally in an emotional state right now.\n\nDobson: For myself, I crave songs that I can sing at the top of my lungs and let all my emotions hang out unapologetically. I think we just needed that release, and pop-punk has that rebellious and raw, honest quality to it.\n\nVince Ernst, Magnolia Park keyboardist: I think this style of music is pretty relevant because it just has a youthful energy. The messages of those songs such as heartbreak, feeling like you don't fit in and wanting to be your own person will always resonate with the younger generations. Also, the classic songs of the past like \"Misery Business,\" \"Sugar, We're Going Down\" and \"All The Small Things\" are just great songs. And great music will always stand the test of time.\n\nMinardi: Lyrically, the genre has always been relatable for any mood. I don't think other genres do that as much, especially for younger fan bases.\n\nForeman: Sometimes it's helpful to step back and look at the broad strokes of adolescent development or even to associate a Jungian archetype to a specific age demographic. Post-pubescent humans are challengers, dreamers: questioning the established rules, pushing back on boundaries and societal norms. Punk music provides a perfect venue for these doubts and questions. Punk thrives when society is riddled with hypocrisy, greed and injustice. Punk rock is an organism that feeds on the dark, ugly, shameful parts of our culture, exposing these social ills to the light. Punk rock asks questions and challenges the status quo. Fortunately for punk-rock, (and unfortunately for humans) these dark times provide ample fodder for punk songs.\n\nFreed: I think we're going through a time where the world is so f—ed, and the information we receive is so quick and vile that we yearn for something like nostalgia (I wish there was a better term). There are also always going to be teenagers, and teenagers need something to listen to that speaks to them in a way they can understand and relate to. They're smart and see through manufactured, overly-produced s—. And that time is now. The teens have discovered emo and pop-punk, and that rocks.\n\nGhiraldi-Travers: I think this music brings an energy that other genres do not. After a worldwide pandemic and the political climate, we need that high-energy and politically charged anti-establishment inspiration that we get out of pop-punk to keep pushing us along.\n\nBarlow: There's a realness and an honesty to pop-punk, as well as energy. Something undeniably fun and catchy, the soundtrack to your best times and the arm round the shoulder in your worst times.\n\nFeldmann: I think people want to have fun again at shows, and now that the pandemic is over people are actually going out and living their lives! I think the indie bedroom thing, (i.e. music to do homework to) is still super relevant, but people want to see live instruments being played and actually have an experience.\n\nPosen: Pop-punk has a very close connection between artist and fan. They're almost one and the same and they are in it together. That makes for an incredibly connected community that wants to help and promote each other.\n\nHow can pop-punk make more space for marginalized artists?\n\nDobson: When my first album came out, I remember feeling like I didn't quite fit in, which I was already kind of used to growing up. I didn't really know where my space was at first but I did find a sense of community in the genre with a few other artists. I think it was because we celebrated each other's individuality. We shopped from similar stores, we enjoyed similar influences and we just wanted to be truly seen and heard — some of us for the first time ever.\n\nForeman: If punk rock is the definition of anti-establishment, then the genre has an obligation to be leading the way forward in making room for the marginalized and championing the causes of the ones who don't fit in.\n\nJuarez: Pop-punk can always make more space for marginalized artists by just being open-minded with show lineups, festivals and even with communities! The more we talk about the bands around us, the more those bands get opportunities, too. Many people and artists from various walks of life listen to and/or play pop-punk — we all deserve these opportunities.\n\nKennyHoopla: By doing it in the places that really matter. Helping local bands and giving your support to local scenes. I've seen fundraisers for dying venues, free shows, collaboration within the scene [help].\n\nJosh Roberts, Magnolia Park singer: Pop-punk, as we all know, has been dominated by mostly white guys, so it's been a little difficult for marginalized artists to have a space. For example, we get a lot of racist comments. But I think we can make the space safer by just taking the time to educate ourselves and being open to the messages that these artists bring to the table, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\nBarlow: With pop-punk being part of the alternative scene, it's very inclusive and welcoming. Everyone is bound by the shared love of something that often feels like more than music. However, it's historically been pretty white and we can always do better, so, no matter who you are, who you love, the color of your skin, welcome, you'll love it here. Start a band, get involved in your local scene in whatever way you can [and] know that this is a world where everyone can thrive and have a voice.\n\nPosen: We can be more aware of artists and fans who share the same passions, interests and values but find themselves outside the community. If we raise awareness, both those in the community would reach out and those outside would feel more welcome. At Hopeless, we make it part of all our conversations about signings, hiring and other decisions to make sure we aren't unconsciously leaving anyone out. One of the results is a current artist roster where front people are more than 50% female or non-binary identifying artists.\n\nGhiraldi-Travers: If the most established artists take younger bands out on the road with them, it is the best way for the marginalized bands to gain new fans. It would also be great for the more popular artists to give a space for features on songs they are releasing that connect directly to that new band's Spotify account.\n\nFreed: I feel lucky that this scene is the most accepting community I've ever encountered. My wish is that as new generations of artists emerge into the scene and create new spaces within the pop-punk community, [so] inclusivity will be so ingrained into the scene that it won't even be a question.\n\nHow has When We Were Young helped give pop-punk a more mainstream boost?\n\nJuarez: A festival as exclusive and influential as When We Were Young was a huge boost for pop-punk in the mainstream — it's a great opportunity for such a community of people to come together and listen to their favorite artists in the same place and create memories. Everyone talks about it, everyone posts about it, people who missed out wish they were able to be there.\n\nPosen: The When We Were Young Festival has played a significant role in the rise in popularity and excitement around iconic artists from our community and the connection they have to the newer generation of artists.\n\nMackin: Yellowcard grew up dreaming to one day be on the Vans Warped Tour, and in our career we were included in their lineup nine separate times. So playing WWWYF really felt nostalgic, and getting to share the stage with so many of our friends in one place, I think it showed other people and listeners (who may not have already been familiar with the scene) how many people love this sub-culture of music.\n\nMinardi: Beyond the 85,000 [people] in attendance each day, the social media presence that goes viral with announcements covers a lot of ground that standard roll out plans for music don't always hit.\n\nFeldmann: When my band Goldfinger played When We Were Young, we had close to 50,000 people watching us. I would say 80% of them had never seen our band. I think it was a great place for young people to see some of the legacy acts and also see some of the new current pop-punk bands. That festival was huge.\n\nForeman: I love to see a lot of my friends on the bill, bands that haven't really toured for years are getting back together to play the festival. And I love that the world is getting to hear their songs again.\n\nGhiraldi-Travers I was lucky enough to attend When We Were Young in 2022 and was hired to run the press room at the 2023 festival and the energy of this festival is palpable. You walk the grounds and see ages of fans who are small enough to be on their parents shoulders and fans in their sixties. It has brought together all types of music lovers and is incredible to witness a sea of emo/pop-punk/rock fans flood the streets of Las Vegas.\n\nFreed: I think When We Were Young took all the best bands and brought them back into the spotlight. I hope that people who have been hooked back into the scene by WWWY's nostalgia focus are also able to check out the passionate and heartfelt work that other artists/creatives are doing to push the needle forward on emo.\n\nWhich artists do you believe are bringing pop-punk into the future and why?\n\nJuarez: There are many artists out there bringing the genre into the future and some of them are us, Olivia Rodrigo, Anxious, Willow Smith, KennyHoopla, Daisy Grenade, Pool Kids, Pollyanna, and Citizen! The list goes on and on. All these artists are bringing something new to the table, whether it be a new sound or merging pop-punk with other genres. It's refreshing and new — as it should be.\n\nKennyHoopla: Neck Deep, Hot Mulligan, Magnolia Park, Knuckle Puck are taking pop-punk into the future.\n\nFreddie Criales, Magnolia Park guitarist: TX2 is someone who is bringing pop-punk to the future. Not only is his music good, but he also makes it a point to make his shows a safe space for marginalized groups. He speaks out against a lot of the injustices that are put on people in the LGBTQIA+ community, and I think that's pretty important. Stand Atlantic is another band that comes to mind. They are really good at infusing a lot of futuristic sounds into their music, and I think that's important because that keeps the music modern, fresh and inspiring to the next gen.\n\nMinardi: Games We Play, jxdn, Meet Me @ The Altar, Hot Mulligan and Anxious are all doing it in their own authentic way and kicking ass.\n\nFeldmann: Turnstile, Hot Mulligan, Heart Attack Man, KennyHoopla, Alexsucks, 408...there's too many to mention here!\n\nGhiraldi-Travers: I see incredible potential in House Parties, NOAHFINNCE, Greyson Zane, Hot Mulligan, Felicity, Action/Adventure, Magnolia Park, Spanish Love Songs, and of course, Meet Me @ The Altar.\n\nDobson: I think Avril [Lavigne] continues to bring the genre into the future. I love that she's always been herself and stuck to her vision, which is something that isn't always easy to do in this industry.\n\nFreed: Title Fight, Meet Me @ The Altar, Noelle Sucks, Pile of Love, Captain Jazz, Home is Where, charmer, Egbert the nerd, Petey, awake but still in bed, Heart Attack Man, Alien Boy, Carly Cosgrove, Dogleg, Hot Mulligan and tons of already popular artists switching their styles to pop-punk/emo.\n\nBarlow: I think KennyHoopla, for sure. To see a Black-fronted pop-punk band — shout-out Magnolia Park — is hugely inspiring and nothing but a good thing for the scene. [Josh Roberts] has insane energy and a captivating stage presence. He writes from the heart and takes little drops from other genres which will absolutely push the genre forward.\n\nPosen: From the Hopeless roster, artists like Scene Queen, NOAHFINNCE, TX2, LOLO, Pinkshift, phem, and others are leading us into the new chapter of our scene. They are not stuck on sounding a certain way, looking a certain way or saying a specific thing. They represent how young people feel today.\n\nWhere do you think the genre is headed in 2024 and beyond?\n\nDobson: Pop-punk, though [it] wasn't in the spotlight or \"mainstream\" for a minute, never really went anywhere. It's always been there.\n\nKennyHoopla: It's either going to blow up, or show that it was truly just a just a moment that paired well with the world's events. Only time can tell, but there will always be a space for those who grew up listening to pop-punk and just never grew out of it.\n\nJuarez: I think pop-punk will continue to mold itself into a genre that many different people want to be a part of. It's more than a genre — it's also a community. The pop-punk community is vast and should be accepting and open-minded.\n\nMinardi: Hopefully it's headed to a place that can help launch the next batch of great artists versus only supporting the legacy.\n\nRoberts: I think pop-punk will be something that people use to infuse into their sound — like a hyper-pop artist who uses a pop-punk vocal cadence. Or, a pop artist using a pop-punk guitar riff. At this point, artists aren't really making one type of genre. They infuse a bunch of different genres together to make something new. So I think pop-punk will be more of an integration than a standalone genre. But of course, there's still gonna be a few artists just doing the classic sound.\n\nPosen: The newer pop-punk and other related genres in our community are becoming more diverse with less boundaries [in terms of] sounds, look, historical culture and other differences. It's so cool to see the melting pot of people, sounds and ideas create music and a scene with far less limitations creatively and otherwise.\n\nGhiraldi-Travers: The genre is more solidified than ever and is only going to continue to grow. The established talent is cranking out some of the best albums of their career which is only going to inspire up-and-coming musicians to keep playing and keep growing. They see longevity, and it is inspiring.\n\nBarlow: The current crop of bands are the best they've ever been, and the heavy hitters are still very active which makes for a healthy scene. The scene is strong enough right now to keep making waves and growing, old fans rediscovering and new fans being made. Plus, it's only a matter of time before the next blink-182 are found in the mountains of California, farting and laughing at dick jokes.\n\nWhy 2002 Was The Year That Made Pop-Punk: Simple Plan, Good Charlotte & More On How \"Messing Around And Being Ourselves\" Became Mainstream\n\nWhen it came to making his latest album, When the Music Stops, jxdn knew wanted to return to the art of storytelling. No chasing hits or trying to go viral on TikTok — it was all about the songs once again.\n\n\"It's more valuable for me to love music than it is for my music to work online,\" jxdn, whose birth name is Jaden Hossler, tells GRAMMY.com of the demand for viral smashes. \"For me, personally, it took the love out of the music.\"\n\nTo help craft his latest project, jxdn tapped Travis Barker, who signed the singer to DTA Records after he went viral on TikTok in 2019 and collaborated with him on his 2021 full-length debut, Tell Me About Tomorrow. That LP spawned hits like \"Angels & Demons,\" \"Comatose\" — which garnered more than 20 million streams and landed him a record deal — and \"So What,\" which entered the Top 10 of Billboard's rock and alternative charts. Jxdn has since become one of pop-punk's leading Gen Z voices, thanks to the authenticity he brought to his influencer platform and for his candor about his struggles with mental health.\n\nJust as his star was rising, jxdn lost his best friend, Cooper Noriega, to an overdose in 2022. The loss made jxdn reevaluate his own relationship with hard drugs; he's now abstained from them for over a year. \"When my best friend died, I died, too,\" the 23-year-old artist tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nThat loss ultimately prompted jxdn to rethink his approach to creating music. His 2022 singles \"Beautiful Boy\" and \"Even in the Dark\" were dedicated to his late friend; the pop-leaning track \"Sober\" which was intended to kick off \"new era\" for him. In 2023, jxdn announced that he would temporarily return to using his given name and would pivot to a more pop-centric sound. The following release, \"Chrome Hearted,\" jxdn found himself at.\n\nBut even with the success that he's experienced so far, jxdn still feels like a misunderstood newcomer. His second album, due June 28, reacquaints fans with the person beneath the shiny veneer of fame. When the Music Stops is also another opportunity for jdxn to reinvent himself.\n\nWhile his full pivot to pop may not have stuck, there’s an undercurrent of glossy production throughout many of When the Music Stops' songs, such as \"What the Hell.\" But the album oscillates between pop-punk anthems (\"You Needed Someone I Just Happened To Be There\"), vulnerable acoustic tracks (\"What Happens When the Music Stops\") and nu metal-tinged numbers (\"STRAY\").\n\nJxdn’s latest LP also became a way for him to process his past reliance on substances and his grief. The airy but infectious \"Drugs\" digs into his depression and drug spiral: \"Oh, the drugs don’t work anymore / Yeah, I’ve tried them all before.\" And on the raw \"Sad October,\" jxdn talks himself out of his grief: \"It only gets worse before it gets better / We only get hurt when we think it’s forever.\"\n\n\"When the Music Stops was very literal,\" he asserts. \"I didn't listen to music last year, really, or the year before. Ultimately, jxdn says, he \"went numb.\" \"I think this album is the coping process.\"\n\nAhead of the album's release, jxdn sat down with GRAMMY.com about how coping with grief and the woes of fame helped him find self-assurance — both musically and personally.\n\nHow has your relationship with Travis Barker grown from your work together on 'Tell Me About Tomorrow' to 'When The Music Stops?'\n\nWe've been through a lot over the past four years, and I think it's a bond much stronger than just putting out music. Every song I've ever put out has been with him, which is such a crazy thing to think about.\n\nThis project was really not for anybody else except for me and him. After I had my whole situation with \"Chrome Hearted\" and changing my name, I needed that so bad. I needed to see past the veil in my personal life, and I looked at Trav and was like, \"I don't want to make a single hit.\" And he was like, \"Perfect. I don't want to, either.\"\n\nI just want to make good music. Nobody makes good music anymore. They just make f—ing hits for online [virality]. So I think that common passion for the art of it all really put us in a good place.\n\nTell me the story behind the title of the album.\n\nIt had to do with the story of when I put out my last album to now. I got a lot of success really early on, a lot of opportunities I necessarily wouldn't have [had] if it weren't for people like Travis and MGK. I took advantage of them, and it was great, but as streams started dwindling, you feel your label and other people being like, \"Let's do more. Let's do more.\" And it just took me to a place of insecurity and lack of identity.\n\nThen, this all came together right when my best friend passed away two years ago, and I came up with the idea of \"when the music stops.\" It wasn't even for a project or for anything — I just wrote it in my notes. I came back to it whenever we were making the album, and the last song I made on the album was \"When the Music Stops.\" It's a very literal representation of [how] the music in my life stopped. It was the worst I've ever felt as a human being, and I never wanted to feel that way again. So this project was the healing of it all.\n\nHow have you coped with fame and found a way to balance the attention?\n\nThe reason I believe in myself so much — and I know I'm going to be who I'm supposed to be — is because my story is so unique. And [how grounded I am] really doesn't make sense for a lot of the positions that I've been in — even down to my reach, [which] is much bigger than my music. The situations and relationships I've been in...[they] just turned me off to the whole thing.\n\nCoping with fame, I don't know if anybody has ever really figured it out. I made a lot of hard decisions getting out of relationships and putting myself around people that not only have the same passion for music as me, but the same passion for me and my love for music.\n\nThese days, I go to three shows a week. Spending more time in the world and not thinking about songs. I got off TikTok. I'm not doing that anymore — because if that's going to make me a star, then I don't want to be a star. I want the music to speak louder. And for the first time in my life, I really believe that I'm letting that happen.\n\nWhat was your grieving process like?\n\nFunny enough, I didn't really grieve. I didn't handle it well. Luckily, there's some people that came into my life [and] kept me somewhat sane. But I really just went numb.\n\nThat's why I put \"When the Music Stops\" as a single out first, because it's not a single, and I wanted people to understand my purpose with this album from the get-go. And it's also the last song on the album.\n\nYou've struggled with drugs in the past. How has your relationship with substances shifted at this point?\n\nYeah, I'm not a big fan of drugs. I live in Cali, so weed isn't a drug and alcohol isn't a drug, but they are. But hard drugs, especially big pharma, and opiates, and barbiturates, and everything like that, I haven't done that in over a year, so that's been really amazing.\n\nMore so these days I'm really obsessed with being present, because I wasn't present for a long time. And even so, I drink, and I'll smoke here and there, but at the end of the day, I'm just in tune with myself, so on the days that I need to be more present, there's no need to be on anything.\n\nI find that I'm a lot better with words these days, because I'm choosing to articulate how I'm feeling rather than just saying a bunch of words. It makes it a lot easier when you just don't do drugs in general. If I'm being honest, music's my drug, and the fans and being at these shows are also my drug — and I mean that very literally. It gets me high, and that's what fills my cup up.\n\nIn terms of this record, which artists influenced you?\n\nDeftones, The Strokes, EKKSTACY. A lot of indie rock. But this album is just the entire spectrum of rock music. I learned my lesson not to put myself in a box. So I took inspiration just based off feeling.\n\nWe made a brother-sister record, basically — meaning each song has a song that has the exact same feeling. We did that pretty intentionally.\n\nI also took reference from my own music. There's two records — three, actually — that sound like [they] came off the first album, because I wanted to show the evolution of growth. There's a lot of acoustic records, which is cool for me. I think my fans will enjoy that.\n\nThe difference is, I wasn't thinking about if it was going to work online or if it was going to work on radio. I was thinking about the live show. And it's such a live album. It's really cool. There's only two songs on the record that I didn't want on there.\n\nWhich songs are those?\n\n\"Wreck Me\" and \"What the Hell,\" and they're both songs that my fans f—ing love. But I care more about my fans than I do about my own ego. The compromise is I get to talk about how I didn't want to put it on the record.\n\nWho do you dream of collaborating with in the future?\n\nJulian Casablancas. The past six months, I've just fallen deeply in love with The Strokes. Everything late '90s and early 2000s in the alternative scene was really cool. I also love dark wave, like Bauhaus, the Cure, Joy Division. But I've found particular liking and likeness to The Strokes. Julian reminds me of myself so much because he's so unapologetically himself, so weird.\n\nAlso, I want to collab with Daft Punk.\n\nWhat do you want fans to get out of this record?\n\nReally, I think the overall theme is hope, because hope kind of keeps you going. And I want to know what people have to say — [the album] is more of a question than it is an answer.\n\nI don't need the reaction of people right now. I know what [this project] is doing for me and my career and me as a human being. I hope my fans can just understand that there's more to come — and whatever they feel in it is exactly what it's supposed to be.\n\n11 Pop-Punk Artists To Watch: Taylor Acorn, American Teeth & More\n\n\"Hey, hey, you, you!\" There's simply no debate: when it comes to the world of pop-punk, Avril Lavigne has always been the people's princess. Bursting onto the scene with her 2002 debut Let Go, the then-teen singer/songwriter was dubbed an overnight sensation with hits like \"Complicated,\" \"Sk8er Boi\" and \"I'm With You.\"She soon became one of the primary artists driving the pop-punk explosion of the 2000s — and remains one of the genre's primary legends more than 20 years later.\n\nLavigne's appeal went far beyond the mass of skaters and suburban kids who devoured her early music. Within months of Let Go's release, she had earned five GRAMMY nominations (tying fellow newcomer Norah Jones for the most nods of 2003) and a year later, she racked up three more.\n\nAs pop-punk's first wave began to crest, the singer broadened her sights beyond the genre she'd helped pioneer, exploring everything from power pop to confessional alt-rock to Christian rock, as well as collaborations with artists as varied as Marilyn Manson and Nicki Minaj. And when pop-punk's second wave hit at the start of the 2020s, Lavigne made a triumphant return to the genre with 2022's Love Sux and the 20th anniversary reissue of Let Go.\n\nNow, she's set to release her first-ever Greatest Hits compilation on June 21, spanning more than two decades, seven albums and nearly two dozen hits on the Billboard Hot 100. To commemorate the album (and its coinciding Greatest Hits Tour), dive into 15 tracks that assert Lavigne's undeniable title as the \"motherf—in princess\" of pop-punk — from hits like \"Sk8er Boi\" to deep cuts like \"Freak Out.\"\n\n\"Complicated,\" 'Let Go' (2002)\n\nWhat better way to begin than with the song that started it all? Released as her debut single in the spring of 2002, \"Complicated\" declared a then-17-year-old Avril Lavigne as a major talent to watch.\n\nEventually, the pop-rock ode to teenaged authenticity became one of the biggest songs of the year, and led to her debut full-length, Let Go, becoming the third highest-selling LP of 2002 in the U.S. (It's since been certified 3x platinum by the RIAA and sold more than 16 million copies around the world.)\n\nIt's hard to overstate just how influential Lavigne's breakout year was, starting with \"Complicated.\" The track peaked at No. 2 on the Hot 100, helping the newcomer earn nominations for Best New Artist, Song Of The Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album (for Let Go) at the 2003 GRAMMY Awards. Its runaway success also helped launch pop-punk's explosion into the mainstream, and the proliferation of artists and female-fronted bands that followed — from Paramore, Ashlee Simpson and Kelly Clarkson to Gen Z hitmakers like Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish and Meet Me @ The Altar — are indebted to Lavigne's trailblazing success with the song.\n\nRead More: Why 2002 Was The Year That Made Pop-Punk: Simple Plan, Good Charlotte & More On How \"Messing Around And Being Ourselves\" Became Mainstream\n\n\"Sk8er Boi,\" 'Let Go' (2002)\n\n\"He was a boy, she was a girl, can I make it any more obvious?\" From those 15 words, Lavigne spun a pop-punk fairy tale for the ages.\n\nIf \"Complicated\" was an introduction to her talent, \"Sk8er Boi\" was the new star's real coronation as the reigning princess of the genre. Everything about Let Go's second single is nothing short of iconic, from the star-crossed love story between a skater destined for punk rock greatness and the ballet dancer who wasn't brave enough to love him, to the lip ring and striped tie Lavigne sported in the music video (the latter of which you can still purchase to this day from her official store).\n\n\"Sk8er Boi\" dispelled any notion that the teenage upstart would be a flash in the pan relegated to one-hit wonder status. In fact, the song notched Lavigne a second consecutive Top 10 hit on the Hot 100, and landed her a fifth GRAMMY nomination at the 2003 ceremony, for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. But the cherry on top of it all? The eleventh hour twist in the track's bridge that the ballet dancer's loss was Avril's gain.\n\n\"My Happy Ending,\" 'Under My Skin' (2004)\n\nAfter all the commercial success and critical acclaim showered on her in the wake of Let Go, Lavigne chose to forgo taking the easy road with another pop-infused mainstream win. Instead, she plunged into the darkness for 2004's Under My Skin, exploring post-grunge, nu metal and even hard rock influences on the punk-infused LP. The biggest hit from the album was second single \"My Happy Ending,\" which became Lavigne's fourth No. 1 at Top 40 radio and spent four weeks in the Top 10 of the Hot 100, peaking even higher on the latter than \"Sk8er Boi\" had two years prior.\n\nThe downcast breakup anthem was the first time Lavigne put her broken heart on display (\"All this time you were pretending/ So much for my happy ending,\" she lamented as the piano-driven verses swirled into a guitar-heavy chorus), and the result was an electric kiss-off delivered with equal parts anger, shock and a tinge of bitter sarcasm.\n\nThe singer may not have gotten her happily ever after, but turning the doomed relationship into a scathing goodbye certainly earned her the last laugh: the song helped propel Under My Skin to becoming one of the top-selling albums of the year worldwide.\n\nRead More: Loving Olivia Rodrigo's \"Vampire\"? Check Out 15 Songs By Alanis Morissette, Miley Cyrus & More That Reclaim The Breakup Narrative\n\n\"Girlfriend,\" 'The Best Damn Thing' (2007)\n\nIt wasn't all doom, gloom and angry tears on Under My Skin, however. Lavigne proved she was equally adept at bouncing back from a particularly disappointing Sk8er Boi with a devilish grin and a chip on her shoulder on the bouncing \"He Wasn't.\"\n\nWhile the brash ditty wasn't officially released as a single in the U.S. — instead being pushed to radio in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and her native Canada — it quickly became a fan favorite from the album. Nearly 20 years on, the song and its rowdy music video (come for Avril wearing fairy wings and a bright pink tutu, stay for her shattering a camera with the butt of her guitar) rather perfectly encapsulate the singer's place as one of the rare female voices at the forefront of the second-wave post-grunge movement.\n\n\"Freak Out,\" 'Under My Skin' (2004)\n\nGiving authority figures the middle finger has long been a hallmark of Lavigne's brand, and nowhere is that more clear than on Under My Skin deep cut \"Freak Out.\" \"Try to tell me what I shouldn't do/ You should know by now I won't listen to you,\" she scowls before ratcheting up the lyrical drama on the booming chorus.\n\nThe track's second verse serves as a veritable manifesto for an entire generation of emo kids, as Lavigne offers the following advice to her fans: \"You don't always have to do everything right/ Stand up for yourself and put up a fight/ Walk around with your hands up in the air/ Like you don't care.\" When in doubt? \"Just freak out, let it go.\"\n\nIn retrospect, Under My Skin is often rightfully credited as one of the defining albums of pop-punk's 2000s heyday. And it's clear Lavigne is proud of the album's impact on both her career and the genre she helped pioneer, considering four of its singles — including \"Don't Tell Me\" and \"Nobody's Home\" — are included in the 20 tracks featured on her upcoming Greatest Hits compilation.\n\n\"Girlfriend,\" 'The Best Damn Thing' (2007)\n\nLavigne turned the power pop up to 11 for her third album, 2007's The Best Damn Thing, and traded the myopic grunge of her previous era for a blast of sugar-coated, self-confident sass. Lead single \"Girlfriend\" let the singer unleash her inner pop-punk princess like never before, as she played a mean girl with a flirtatious streak who somehow made stealing another girl's man seem lovable.\n\nThe unabashed bop was the first time Lavigne proudly declared herself \"the motherf—in' princess,\" and the song's relentless sing-song hook was so addictive that it became the star's first single to top the Hot 100. Lavigne broke several records with \"Girlfriend,\" which became one of the best-selling songs of 2007 and the most-viewed YouTube video of 2008 — as well as the first to ever reach 100 million views on the platform.\n\nStill can't get enough of \"Girlfriend\"? Hardcore fans know that the official remix with Lil Mama might even outdo the fizzy perfection of the original.\n\n\"The Best Damn Thing,\" 'The Best Damn Thing' (2007)\n\nFor the title track off The Best Damn Thing, Lavigne doubled down on the bright and bubbly persona she'd donned on \"Girlfriend.\" In fact, the song's opening rallying cry of \"Let me hear you say hey, hey, hey!\" and a call-and-response bridge are so downright peppy that it seems almost hard to believe they came from the same artist who thrashed her way through Under My Skin.\n\nReleased as The Best Damn Thing's fourth and final single, the song of the same name is more melodic than its chart-topping predecessor, with Lavigne unapologetically laying out the type of treatment she expects from a man in cheerleader fashion (\"Gimme an A! Always give me what I want!/ Gimme a V! Be very, very good to me!\"). After all, a pop-punk princess deserves a Cinderella story of her own.\n\n\"What the Hell,\" 'Goodbye Lullaby' (2011)\n\nRiding high off the commercial success of The Best Damn Thing, Lavigne kicked off the rollout for her fourth studio album, 2011's Goodbye Lullaby, with \"What the Hell,\" a playfully bratty banger that found her toying with a love interest and vowing, \"All my life I've been good/ But now I'm thinking, 'What the hell!'\"\n\nProduced and co-written by pop impresarios Max Martin and Shellback, \"What the Hell\" melded Lavigne's snarky songwriting sensibilities and penchant for bucking authority with a catchy, singalong refrain. But the lead single actually proved to be something of an outlier on the pop-punk princess' fourth go-around, as the rest of the album utilized a stripped-back sonic palette to lay her heartbreak bare in the wake of divorcing Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley.\n\n\"Bad Reputation,\" 'Goodbye Lullaby' (2011)\n\nGoodbye Lullaby may have been Lavigne's first foray into a more acoustic sound — complete with introspective lyrics and surprisingly sincere song titles like \"I Love You\" and \"Everybody Hurts\" — but she couldn't resist adding a little snarl to the album's softer, more sensitive proceedings. So for the deluxe edition of the album, she featured her take on Joan Jett's classic 1980 single \"Bad Reputation\" as a bonus track.\n\nLavigne had originally recorded \"Bad Reputation\" for the soundtrack to the Japanese anime feature film One Piece Film: Z (it even reached the top 10 on Japan's Hot 100!). But she apparently liked the cover so much that it ended up on the track list of not one, but two of her albums, as the song was also included on 2013's Avril Lavigne.\n\n\"Here's to Never Growing Up,\" 'Avril Lavigne' (2013)\n\nEven as she approached her thirties, Lavigne wasn't about to give up her spot as pop-rock's resident wild child. Case in point: \"Here's to Never Growing Up,\" the lead single off her fifth album, 2013's Avril Lavigne. Over a peppy stomp-clap rhythm, the singer shouts out an undying love of Radiohead, dancing on bar tops and making late-night memories with your best friends as the boombox blares all your favorite songs.\n\nThere's a thread of bittersweet nostalgia running through the midtempo jam — one that's sure to pierce the heart of any millennial listening as Lavinge sings, \"Say, won't you say 'forever'?/ Stay, if you stay forever/ Hey, we can stay forever young.\" It's not that the singer's refusing to acknowledge the cruel act of getting older on the track, she's just rebelling against the notion that adulthood should be a dreary slog of, you know, taxes and laundry and all of those lame adult responsibilities.\n\n\"Rock N Roll,\" 'Avril Lavigne' (2013)\n\nLavigne once again put her middle finger to the sky and re-upped her rock star credentials on the appropriately titled \"Rock N Roll,\" the second single off her self-titled album. The spirited singalong finds the singer reveling in her eternally bad attitude as she wails, \"I don't care if I'm a misfit/ I like better than the hipster bulls–/ I am the motherf—in' princess/ You still love it.\"\n\nThough \"Rock N Roll\" didn't make quite as much of an impact on the charts as some of the other hits on this list, it remains one of the most underrated bangers in her entire discography. Plus, the song gifted fans with the campy, comic book-inspired music video starring Lavinge, Danica McKellar, a drunk-driving Doberman and one very unlucky lobster as they race across a dystopian wasteland to save rock and roll from the clutches of an evil bear-shark. (Billy Zane shows up on a rocket-powered Segway at some point, too — just go with it.)\n\n\"Head Above Water,\" 'Head Above Water' (2019)\n\nProving that pop-punk doesn't always have to come with an in-your-face, \"f— you!\" attitude, Lavigne released \"Head Above Water\" — the lead single and title track to her 2019 album — five years into an often confusing, devastating and all-consuming battle with Lyme disease.\n\n\"One night I thought I was dying, and I had accepted that I was going to die,\" she revealed at the time of the song's unveiling. \"My mom laid with me in bed and held me. I felt like I was drowning. Under my breath, I prayed, 'God, please help to keep my head above the water.' In that moment, the songwriting of this album began.\"\n\nLavigne taps into a truly admirable well of resilience and hope on the spiritual ballad as she sings, \"Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for/ Can't part the sea, can't reach the shore/ And my voice becomes the driving force/ I won't let this pull me overboard.\" Unlike anything that's come from the singer's catalog either before or since, \"Head Above Water\" remains a powerful testament to the beloved pop-punk princess' inner strength.\n\n\"Bite Me,\" 'Love Sux' (2022)\n\nAs the 2010s gave way to a new decade, pop-punk made a surprise resurgence in popularity while Lavigne was making major moves of her own; she left BMG after just one album to sign with Travis Barker's DTA Records in 2021 (about which she fittingly declared, \"Let's f— s— up!\"). Partnering with the blink-182 drummer sparked some serious magic in the studio, as her seventh studio album, 2022's Love Sux was a wildly entertaining return to her pop-punk roots after the emotional catharsis of Head Over Water.\n\nOn lead single \"Bite Me,\" Lavigne effortlessly dusted off her crown and reclaimed her throne with an octave-jumping vocal performance. Along with proving she still has the chops, the singer simply sounds like she's having a hell of a lot of fun as she snaps back at an ex-flame who made the mistake of crossing her. Pop-punk's reigning princess? Try queen.\n\nRead More: How 'Love Sux' Led Avril Lavigne To True Love, Her First Fangirl Moment And An Album Process That Was 'Just Stupid Fun'\n\n\"All I Wanted\" feat. Mark Hoppus, 'Love Sux' (2022)\n\nLavigne collaborated with plenty of special guests on Love Sux, from blackbear (on love-drunk single \"Love It When You Hate Me\") to eventual tourmate Machine Gun Kelly (on delicious battle of the sexes \"Bois Lie\"), but no other duet on the album holds a candle to \"All I Wanted\" featuring blink-182's Mark Hoppus.\n\nThe supercharged deep cut features the two trailblazers rocking out in a whirling dervish of escapist bliss, playing a sort of pop-punk Bonnie and Clyde as they bust out of the town they're stuck in. And in doing so, they proved they're more than happy to show the new kids at the rock show just how it's done.\n\n\"Breakaway,\" 'Let Go (20th Anniversary Edition)' (2022)\n\nAnd finally, a proper celebration of Lavigne's status as pop-punk royalty wouldn't be complete without including the biggest song she ever gave to another artist. As the story goes, the singer/songwriter originally penned \"Breakaway\" for her debut album, but the hope-filled anthem didn't quite fit with the vibe of Let Go tracks like \"Complicated,\" \"Sk8er Boi,\" \"Losing Grip,\" and \"I'm With You.\" So instead, she gave it to a fresh-faced newcomer by the name of Kelly Clarkson, who had just come off of winning a little reality TV experiment called \"American Idol.\"\n\nAfter being featured on the soundtrack to The Princess Diaries 2, \"Breakaway\" became the centerpiece and title track of Clarkson's 2004 sophomore album, which helped turn her into a bonafide superstar — and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nLavigne started performing the song live for the first time on her 2019 Head Above Water Tour, which naturally left fans clamoring for a studio version. Blessedly, the pop-punk icon gave them exactly what they wanted by revisiting \"Breakaway\" in the recording studio for the 20th anniversary edition of Let Go in 2022. She even reinstated her original lyrics in the opening stanza (\"Grew up in a small town/ And when the snow would fall down/ I'd just stare out my window\") for a personal touch that connected back to her roots in Greater Napanee, Ontario.\n\nClarkson may have made the song famous, but the beating heart of \"Breakaway\" will always be Lavigne's story — one of a small-town girl who bet on herself, only to become a trailblazing artist whose legacy is forever cemented in the pop-punk history books.\n\nThe State Of Pop-Punk: A Roundtable Unpacks The Genre's Past, Present And Future\n\nDeryck Whibley didn't know Heaven :x: Hell was going to be Sum 41's final album when he began the process of making it.\n\n\"I was just listening to it as a finished record to see how close it was to being done — and it was almost done — but I thought, 'This to me feels like a record that I could call our last record.' I feel so proud of it, and it encapsulates the entire sound of the band and everything that we've tried to do over the years. It's all in one record,\" he explains over Zoom from his home in Las Vegas.\n\nTo be fair, the Sum 41 frontman, 44, had spent the past five years contemplating a future without the band that has defined him since their punk rock beginnings in 1996. \"I always knew if I was ever going to do something, I can't do two things at once,\" he explains. \"I didn't ever have a date or a time — I just knew it would kind of hit me.\"\n\nAmid the release of their 2001 debut album All Killer No Filler and the height of Warped Tour, Sum 41 became pop-punk pioneers of the early aughts. The five-piece — comprised of Whibley, Dave Baksh (guitar, backing vocals), Jason McCaslin (bass, backing vocals), Tom Thacker (guitars, keyboards, backing vocals), and Frank Zummo (drums, percussion, occasional backing vocals) — has since released seven more albums, even earning a GRAMMY nomination in 2012 for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance for the song \"Blood in My Eyes.\" Over the years, they've toured with artists including Good Charlotte, The Offspring, Mötley Crüe and many other titans in the punk and pop-punk world.\n\nWith their eighth studio album, Whibley believes it's the band's \"complete work.\" The 20-track Heaven:x: Hell is a testament to the band's expansive punk sound throughout their nearly three-decade-long career: Heaven's 10 tracks channel the energetic pop-punk sound that brought them to the forefront of the Warped Tour scene; while Hell taps into the band's affinity for experimentation and heavier elements with bombastic riffs and explosive anthems. To culminate their tenure, Sum 41 will hit the road for a massive farewell tour, kicking off on April 19 in Omaha and concluding with their final show in their native Toronto on Jan. 30, 2025.\n\nFor Whibley, life after Sum 41 remains a question mark. Perhaps he'll work on a solo project or maybe he'll work on some scripts. Ultimately, he believes that once he's faced with the uncertainty of his own future, his heart will gravitate toward what excites him the most. \"I love music,\" he sighs, \"but I like to think that there might be something else out there.\"\n\nAs the end of Sum 41 approaches, Whibley reminisces on the breadth of experiences the band has had over the years. Below, he details seven of his most career-defining moments to date.\n\nPlaying Warped Tour In 2001\n\nWe started the band by going to the first Vans Warped Tour that came through Toronto [in 1995]. All the bands that we were obsessed with at the time [were there] — NOFX, Pennywise, Face To Face, Unwritten Law, all these California punk rock bands. We were already in a band but as a different band [called Kaspir], and we just thought, This is the kind of music we listen to. This is the kind of tour we want to be on. We want to play with these bands and be like these guys. We need to start a new band. That was the moment we decided, let's start a band that could be one day on a tour like this.\n\nSo six years later, we ended up getting [on] the tour, and we became friends with a lot of those guys, like The Vandals, Pennywise. Fat Mike was on the tour. He wasn't with NOFX, but he was with another band. We used to be just watching them from the front of the stage. Now we're hanging out backstage, and we're parking our tour buses next to each other every single day on the whole tour for two and a half months, every single day. It just became this great thing.\n\nIt was also at the same time as our first record, All Killer No Filler,was taking off and our first single, \"Fat Lip,\" was taking off in the middle of that tour. So when we started, we were on MTV, but it wasn't a big song yet, and as the summer went on, it just got bigger and bigger. So we saw the growth happen while we were out on that tour. Everything really exploded in that summer on that tour.\n\nPerforming With Tommy Lee & Judas Priest's Rob Halford At MTV's 20th Anniversary\n\nThat was in August [2001], and we were on Warped Tour — we had to take a little break to go over to New York and do [the MTV performance]. That came last-second. When we started Warped Tour, we were on MTV, but it just started and in mid-July, [\"Fat Lip\" was doing really well.\n\nWe were still a new band, but MTV asked us to come and perform at their anniversary bash, and we were going to open the show. So in our minds, we were like, \"Why don't we do something cool that we've seen before?\" They do collaboration stuff with like Run DMC, and Aerosmith and stuff like that. So we asked if we could do that, and they said, \"Sure. Who are you thinking about?\"\n\nWe threw out a couple of names and we were like, \"Let's ask Tommy Lee, let's ask Rob Halford and we'll place some of these songs.\" We even said, \"Let's see if we can get Slash from Guns N' Roses and the Beastie Boys. Both Slash and the Beastie Boys were like, \"We're not going to show up. We're not doing that thing.\" But Tommy and Rob were like, \"F— yeah, sounds great.\"\n\nSo we met in New York, the night before the show, and worked on this little medley of different songs from Sum 41. We did a Beastie Boys song, we did a Mötley Crüe song, we did a Judas Priest song. We threw it together really quickly.When we opened the show, I thought we played like s—. Because when [we were] on stage, it just didn't sound good in our monitors. It felt a little weird, and you're playing to a lot of industry people. So you don't know if people like it or not.\n\nWe walked off stage, not really knowing if that was good or bad. But it all kind of blew up for us. When we walked off stage, the heads of MTV came by and they were just saying, like, \"That was phenomenal. We're gonna have a great relationship together. You guys are the next big thing. We're gonna get behind your whole thing.\"\n\nFrom that moment on, our video went into heavy rotation the next morning, it went all over the world, and \"Fat Lip\" became a No. 1 song. It just turned into a whole thing. That next day, we flew back to the Warped Tour, and our friends — all those bands — had watched it, and everybody was like, \"You guys are going to be massive. After that, nothing's gonna be the same.\" And it never was. Everything just took off from that moment on.\n\nTouring With The Mighty Mighty Bosstones\n\nWe were really young — this was still in the van days — and it was only the second tour we'd ever done of America. Flogging Molly was the [other] support band. Right from day one, even though we were these kids that nobody ever heard of, both the Bosstones and Flogging Molly treated us like family. We all became this great family for this whole tour.\n\nWe would go on the Bosstones' bus and Dicky Barrett, the singer, taught us all how to play dice and gamble. He took all our money every single night. He didn't even care that we were completely broke kids in a van who barely had $20 between all of us. We lost, he took it all. [Laughs]\n\nWatching [the Bosstones] every night was also such a learning experience. They would get in all their suits, and they all went out on stage. [Dicky] had a character. He's a character off stage, but he even had more of a heightened character on stage. He had banter and bits that he would do every single night. And I realized, \"Oh it's a show. You're putting on a real show.\" It's not just off the cuff — he put some time and effort into making it entertaining.\n\nThe other thing that was memorable about that tour was Dicky and I both kind of had a similar hairstyle, and within like five or six shows, all of a sudden, he started calling me his son. People thought we were related.\n\nA couple shows into it, the Bosstones were on stage, and I kept hearing over the PA, \"'Deryck, where is he? Get Deryck up here.\" I'm backstage, and people are saying, \"Hey, Dicky's calling you out on stage.' I didn't know for what. I walked out on stage, and he goes, \"There he is, ladies and gentlemen, give it up for my son.\"\n\nThe whole crowd starts cheering. He does this whole bit where he's like, \"I haven't seen my son in 20 years. This is my way of getting to know him, bringing him on tour.\" And he kept that bit up every single night to a point where if I see him, I saw him a couple of months ago, he still calls me his son. I still call him Dad. And that was from 23 years ago. He's my punk-rock dad.\n\nSetting Their First Tour Bus On Fire\n\nWe were so used to touring in vans, and we used to tour in this old 1982 Ford Econoline that had no air conditioning, no heat or anything. It had holes in the floor, so if you were driving in the rain or the snow, all the rain and snow would come through on your feet.\n\nSo finally, we get to the point where we're big enough that we're gonna get a tour bus. We were so excited, and we were pretty young. I mean, we're like 19 or 20 years old at that point, and we used to party all the time. We thought we were like Mötley Crüe — we just partied all day all night.\n\nThe first night that we had the bus, I said on stage, \"Hey, everybody, we just got our first tour bus. After the show, we're gonna have a party, so you guys are all invited.\" We kept doing it every night, but that first night, there was a lineup of 1,000 people trying to get on the bus, and our tour manager was there to allow a few people on and check IDs. But our bus was crammed with people.\n\nWe ended up partying really late, and I think one of us — it might have been me or it might have been Steve [Jocz], our drummer — was making food. It was 5 a.m., and we all passed out while the food was cooking. The toaster oven caught on fire and the whole bus filled with smoke.\n\nFinally, it woke somebody up, and you couldn't see anything. The whole bus was filled with smoke, and this thing was on fire. Obviously, we got it out and everything, [so] then we drove.\n\nWhen we woke up the next day — probably in the afternoon — there was some random person who had passed out in the back lounge from the other city. We're now seven hours away somewhere else, so we had to wake this guy up. We were like, \"We don't even know who this guy is.\" He's like, \"Oh s—, I live in Pittsburgh.\" I was like, \"You've got to get a train or something.\"[Laughs.]\n\nEarning An MTV Music Video Award Nomination\n\nWe were so excited and nervous. We were so brand new to this whole thing, and it was also in that heyday of pop music, so really big pop superstars were there — NSYNC, Britney [Spears] and Christina [Aguilera] — they were all the big talk the whole thing. We're these kids that were just touring in a van that all of a sudden are now at these awards with all these superstars.\n\nI remember the night before, we went out to a bar, we did a bunch of mushrooms, and we got really drunk. Other people from the award show [were] there, too. Nikka Costa was there, and she came by our table. Somebody introduced us, and our bass player ended up vomiting all over her feet when she came over to say \"hello\" because he was so high and drunk at the same time.\n\nWe ended up going to the awards show the next day [where] we were up for the Best New Artist award. And I remember Alicia Keys was up for it because it was her first single, [\"Fallin'\"]. None of us knew much about each other. We were all brand-new artists. And she went up to go perform that song — it was before our award was announced — and she was so f—ing incredible.\n\nIt was so amazing that instantly, I just was like, \"I don't want to win this award now. After seeing that, we don't deserve it. This person deserves this award. She's clearly talented, and we're just some punk band [that] can barely play our instruments.\"\n\nThen right after she was done, they said, and now the nominees for Best New Artist. The entire time I'm saying, \"Please don't win. Please don't win. Please don't win.\" And they say, \"The winner is Alicia Keys.\" And I was like, \"Yes! Thank God it was not us.\"\n\nGetting GRAMMY Recognition\n\nOne of the most unexpected phone calls I ever got was in 2011 from our manager telling me that we were nominated for our first GRAMMY. It was for a song called \"Blood In My Eyes.\"\n\nNot only was it an incredible honor, but it was for a song that our record company didn't think should be recorded for our album at the time. The reason they didn't want to have it on the album was because I was taking a long time to get the recording right and they felt I was dragging the process on and on.\n\nI put my foot down and got the song finished and for it to have been nominated for the highest musical honor was complete validation for all the time and work I put into the making of that song.\n\nMaking Heaven :x: Hell & Announcing Their Final Tour\n\nIt's a strange \"best moment\" because it is the end. When we announced that this was going to be a final album [and] final tour, I was not expecting it to be anything surprising, or for many people to really care. I felt like our core fan base would be upset, but I wasn't expecting much of a reaction. It was such a bigger reaction than I could ever imagine.\n\nWhen we put [out] the tour [dates], shows were selling out, and we're adding second dates, and that was selling out. Everything just blew up into a thing that I was not expecting.\n\nSo although it's bittersweet and sad that it's the end, in some ways, I'm happy. But I know there's a lot of people in our world that are upset by it. It was such a surprising moment for me to see how much people do care because I wasn't expecting that.\n\nThe way I work on things is that I put all my focus and energy and attention into one thing. I always knew if I was ever going to do something [other than Sum 41], I can't do two things at once, and would I ever get to a point where I'd walk away? I'm so focused on making this final tour the best it can be as a final tour. The point of this, for me, is to go try to find something new and do something different.\n\nSo I don't really think about, \"In a few years, we'll get back together.\" The goal is, this is a chapter I'm closing, and it's been great, but I would love to create a new chapter that's great. That's the plan. I don't know what that is.\n\nI think anything's possible, but it's also so possible that we never play together again. I have no plans for it. It's very possible we never get on stage together again, but I can't say \"Never say never\" because I don't know. Life is life, and you can't predict anything.\n\nThe State Of Pop-Punk: A Roundtable Unpacks The Genre's Past, Present And Future\n\nThese days, what happens in Vegas, slays in Vegas when it comes to the harder side of music.\n\nIt might have seemed unthinkable a decade ago, but as Fat Mike of NOFX and Fat Wreck Chords has been putting out there for a while now, Sin City is basically \"the most punk city in the U.S.\" at the moment. Some might find this statement debatable, but Vegas has long attracted subculture-driven gatherings, from Viva Las Vegas rockabilly weekend to the all-metal Psycho Las Vegas to the mixed bag that was Las Rageous. The latest slate of huge punk and punk-adjacent music events (from Punk Rock Bowling and When We Were Young to the just-announced new lineup of Sick New World 2024) back his claim even further.\n\nMike’s own Punk Rock Museum, which opened in April of this year, has cemented the city’s alternative music cred — even as it’s still best known for gambling, clubbing, and gorging at buffets.\n\nIn fact, A lot of the audacious new activity is centered away from the big casinos and in the downtown area and arts district of what is known as \"old Vegas.\" Just outside of the tourist-trappy, Times Square-like Fremont Experience, there’s a vibrant live music scene anchored by a few key clubs, and an ever-growing slate of fests.\n\n*Attendees at 2022's When We Were Young Festival┃Photo: Tim Mosenfelder/FilmMagic*\n\nLive Nation’s second annual When We Were Young Festival brought out a largely Millennial crowd to see headliners Green Day and blink-182 this past weekend, alongside over two dozen more recognizable openers from emo/pop-punk's heyday. Tickets sold so well when it was first announced, that a second day was added to the schedule.\n\nGreen Day didn’t stop with their fest gigs; the band played a \"not-so-secret\" pop-up show last Thursday night at one of the most popular venues in town for punk, alternative and heavy music: Fremont Country Club, just blocks from festival grounds. The show served as a warm-up gig as well as an announcement by Billie Joe Armstrong: His band will join Smashing Pumpkins, Rancid, and others for a 2024 stadium tour. The band also debuted a timely new track, \"The American Dream Is Killing Me.\"\n\nRead More: Why 2002 Was The Year That Made Pop-Punk: Simple Plan, Good Charlotte & More On How \"Messing Around And Being Ourselves\" Became Mainstream\n\n\"People who like punk and other heavy music want to be in a club environment like ours, not a big casino,\" says Carlos \"Big Daddy\" Adley, owner of Fremont Country Club and its adjacent music space Backstage Bar & Grill. Both have become live music hotspots not unlike the ones Adley and his wife/partner Ava Berman ran in Los Angeles before they moved to Vegas over a decade ago.\n\n\"Fremont East,\" as the neighborhood is called, will soon see a boutique hotel from the pair. Like everything they do, it will have a rock n’ roll edge that hopes to draw both visitors and locals.\n\n*Outside Fremont Country Club┃Photo: Fred Morledge*\n\nThe duo told GRAMMY.com that a visit to Double Down Saloon, Sin City’s widely-recognized original punk bar and music dive was what first inspired them to come to Vegas and get into the nightlife business there. Double Down has been slinging booze (like Bacon Martinis and \"Ass Juice\" served in a ceramic toilet bowl mug) and booking live punk sounds since it opened back in 1992.\n\n\"It's kind of a stepping stone for a lot of bands,\" says Cameron Morat, a punk musician and photographer, who also works with the Punk Rock Museum as curator of its rockstar-led tour guide program. \"People always assume that Vegas is just the strip, but that's only like four miles long. There's a lot more of the ‘‘other city.’ There are people who are just into music and into going to local shows who don't ever go to the main strip.\"\n\nIn addition to the Double Down, Morat says Vegas has always had a history of throwing local punk shows at spaces like the Huntridge Theater, which is currently being remodeled and set to re-open soon for local live music. He also points to The Usual Place as a venue popular with local punk and rock bands now, and The Dive Bar — a favorite with the mohawk, patched-up battle vest scene, featuring heavy music seven nights a week, including a night promoted by his partner Masuimi Max called Vegas Chaos.\n\n*Cameron Morat┃Photo: Kristina Markovich*\n\nWhile glitzy stage shows from legacy artists and mega-pop hit makers like Usher, Elton John, Katy Perry, Carrie Underwood, Gwen Stefani and Lady Gaga still get the most media attention, raucous local shows are starting to factor into a new generation’s vacation planning, too.\n\n\"There’s a really good scene here,\" Morat proclaims. \"It's funny because a lot of people, the sort of gatekeepers of punk, ask ‘why is the punk museum in Vegas?’ But it is a punk city, and not just because you've got all the local bands and the venues.\"\n\nRead More: City On Fire: X's Explosive Debut Album Los Angeles At 40\n\nMorat, whose own band Soldiers of Destruction, plays around town on occasion, also notes other acts such as Gob Patrol, Suburban Resistance, and Inframundo as having fierce local followings. He says there’s a certain voracious vibe in Vegas that lends itself to punk rock creation, performance and attitude. \"A lot of the anger from punk rock — like the disparity of wealth, for instance, is here,\" he says. \"Five minutes down the road, you've got people throwing away a million on the roll of a dice. But you've also got people who are doing like three jobs just trying to pay their rent.\"\n\nOver at the Punk Rock Museum, Morat, who moved from Los Angeles to Vegas about seven years ago, is keeping busy booking big-name guests to share inspirations and war stories, both weekly, and specifically timed with whatever big festival or event happens to be in town. He says he wants to feature artists that might not be thought of as traditional punk rock, but who have relevant backgrounds and stories to share.\n\n\"A lot of these people have punk history the public doesn’t know about,\" he says. \"I think if we just stick to a very small well of people, it's going to get pretty boring. So I'm trying to open it up for a bigger cross-section.\"\n\n*Imagery from \"Black Punk Now\" | Ed Marshall*\n\nThe museum is already showing the breadth of punk rock’s influence on music in general. During WWWY, the museum held events tied to its new exhibit \"Black Punk Now,\" curated by James Spooner, director of the 2003 documentary Afro-Punk. As Spooner spoke about the film’s 20th anniversary and his new book of Black punk authors, musicians playing the weekend’s festivities from Sum 41, MxPx, Bayside, Less Than Jake came through to talk too. Warped Tour’s Kevin Lyman and Fat Mike himself also took part in the museum’s new after-dark guided tour series.\n\nBringing in a wider audience and a new generation of rebellious kids who seek to channel their angst and energy into music is part of what the museum — and, it seems, the myriad of events in Las Vegas these days — is all about. Despite what some punk rock purists and gatekeepers might say, the inclusion of tangent bands and scenes is in the original punk spirit. He’ll be booking guests tied to next year’s Sick New World, the Viva Las Vegas rockabilly bash and even EDC in the future (electronic bangers are not unlike hardcore ones and even Moby was a punk before he became a DJ).\n\n\"I think that the museum is great for the punk scene here,\" he adds. \"People will literally come to town just to see the museum, and then if there's a band playing in town in the evening, they'll go. So it's broadening the support for all the bands, local and touring. Some punk bands used to skip Vegas completely on their tours, but not anymore.\"\n\nRemembering When We Were Young: Avril Lavigne, Jimmy Eat World & More Bands Reflect On The Peak Of Emo & Hardcore Ahead Of Vegas Fest"
