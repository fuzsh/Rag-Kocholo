        "text": "Aloha homies!\n\nFirst of all, no it's not Basket case hehe, but it sounds a little like to it.\n\nI've been looking for a song in about...20 years now or more, I think I was between 5-8 (born 89), and when I heard it at the Swedish music program \"Voxpop\" I was quick writing 50% of the artist+track name on a piece of paper. Think I lost it and I've been looking for the track since.\n\nHeard it in 2000'ish on a snowboard competition like Olympic Games or something, like 20 seconds before this guy was about to hit the snow, a time when smartphones weren't made and there was no Shazam. I actually called the tv-channel (well call me crazy hehe) and asked if someone knew and got a negative answer.\n\nI only remember the first 2-3 chords -will make a \"cover\" of it as soon as I have time, brought my macbook to work and will take 10 mins this lunch hehe, but found some 90s punk playlists on SPotify I've been through. Still can't find it.\n\nSo, I'm hoping perhaps someone...on this forum Might know, perhaps better after my \"cover\". I have the contact details to the guy who was the host, but perhaps he dosen't remember hehe,,,will chill on that for a while.\n\nBut at this point, I think I remember that somewhere in the video they were in a basement or a garage and there were many glass bottles, it Could be black&white.\n\nThe intro sounds exactly like the intro for Fenix TX - All my fault.\n\nFigured out it starts on a D, the melody was something like:\n\nÂ§||: f# g A. | b c# d c# F#. | something ... lower case are fast/8 notes and capitals are 4th notes or yeah, a long note. This is the best I can do for the scripting/notation online hehe.\n\nWill try make a \"remix\" in Logic, perhaps try it again with my Shazam, record it at my place so you will have something to listen to and someone...might remember the track.\n\nA little crazy post but, I can't get it out of my head and it'd be nice hear it again and be able to play it again. Sounds like Basket case or the voice melody sounds like it, and intro also reminds of it but more like the faster Fenix TX.\n\nThanks in advance guys,\n\nDaveman\n\nYou don't remember any lyrics?\n\n90s punk for snowboard could be so many things... Rancid, Green Day, Dillinger Four, Blink 182, Ramones even!\n\nSum 41, Swingin Utters, NOFX....\n\nman you're makin me nostalgic. I'm gonna go build some K'Nex\n\nHaha! Cool new avatar.\n\nListened now on all old Green day albums. The singer has some brittish accent or it is just in my imagination since I'm comparing it to Green day, but could be american.\n\nRamones - doesn't sound like their sound, more new 90's punk rock.\n\nBlink 182, nah they're my favorites, know them by heart\n\nDillinger Four - new name, will take listen. Rancid, not their style either, more skate punk from what I remember.\n\nWill listen more to Bodyjar and Goldfinger too, but it's not Goldfinger and I think Bodyjar is too new.\n\nNOXF, hmm...could be, haven't listened to them that much. But yeah, singer soounds very much like Billie.\n\nSum 41, ...not that certain, a little too far away I think.\n\nThanks a lot for the names pal!"
