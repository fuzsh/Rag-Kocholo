        "text": "90s teen comedy American Pie is definitely the film equivalent of pop punk music, and here are the reasons why!\n\nAmerican Pie is a piece of movie history. We may even go as far as to say it’s a piece of American history. It definitely pushed boundaries and spawned a whole new genre of teen films. And let’s face it, American Pie has pretty much become synonymous with American teenagers. Whenever we think of the typical American teenager, guys like Stifler, Jim and Oz come to mind.\n\nAnd as a lover of the American Pie franchise—hell I even like American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile and Beta House… yes, I’m aware that I’m probably the only person in history to like them—I always believed that the movies, especially the first and second one, were the epitome of pop punk. Not only is the soundtrack pure 90s pop punk goodness (including gems from Sum 41, Green Day, Lit, The Offspring and New Found Glory) but the film itself just has a sense of urgency, and the classic, ‘pretty optimistic for a pessimist’ view of life and the dreaded grown-up future.\n\nHere are the reasons why American Pie is the film equivalent of pop punk:\n\nIt’s about friends doing really, really stupid things – Some of these stupid things include having sexual relations with a pie, ejaculating into a beer (and someone drinking it), broadcasting a girl undressing on the internet, and naturally, accidentally sending the link to everyone in school. And being stupid is what pop punk is all about.\n\n“My Friends Over You” – The guys are all about friendship and brotherhood. If that isn’t the definition of pop punk, I have no idea what is.\n\nPop culture references – Every pop punk band is guilty of using a reference to a popular TV show or movie at least 5 times in their musical careers, and well, American Pie is just as punk rock. Not only is the movie actually named after the all-American pop song of the same name, but it also has a reference to the film The Graduate with its Mrs Robinson portrayal of “Stifler’s mom”. The song ‘Mrs Robinson’ is also used in the film.\n\nTeenage frustration – The whole movie is about teenage angst, and well, really, aren’t all pop punk songs?\n\nWorried about the future and getting old– Just as every great pop punk track suggests, teenagers just really don’t like growing up. The guys in the film, although want to, are scared to lose their virginities and leave high school.\n\nThe movie pays homage to legends blink-182 – Just as every pop punk band does. American Pie not only uses ‘Mutt’ in its soundtrack, but also features blink-182 as guys watching the Nadia broadcast. Mark Hoppus singing, “go trig boy, it’s your birthday…” is one of the most important moments of the 90s. Period.\n\nMost of the guys in the film go by weird semi-cool nicknames, or their last names – It’s fair to say that most pop punk bands have really weird, trendy band names, just like the nicknames of the characters: Stifler/Stifmeister, Oz/Ostreicher, Sherman/Sherminator, Finch/Shit-break (he doesn’t actually have a choice in that one).\n\nStifler actually looks like he belongs in a pop punk band – Stifler could literally join any pop punk band of the 90s. Get that dude some khaki shorts!\n\nOne of the main characters is actually in a band in real life – Thomas Ian Nicholas, who plays the leader of the pack, Kevin Myers, is actually the singer and guitarist of the Thomas Nicholas Band. The 4-piece rockers have even released a cover single of the American Pie theme tune ‘Laid’.\n\nMum and dad just don’t understand – Jim’s loving dad tries to help him through his difficult and confusing teenage years and fails miserably, instead thoroughly grossing out his son. Non-understanding parents is just so punk rock.\n\nParties galore – Having a party at Stifler’s house after a major life event is the norm for these guys. They are all about ragers, kegs, red cups and girls. And isn’t that really the music video/theme of most pop punk songs? Pop punk is definitely the party animal of the music scene.\n\nSo, to sum up, American Pie will always be stupidly awesome, no matter how much time passes, and it will always be the khaki-short-wearing, blink-182-loving, spiked haired kid of the movie world.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nElectronic\n\nIs Marshmello and an EDM God or more of a cult leader?
