        "text": "Images\n\nActivities\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\nPose the following question to students and briefly discuss: Is Rock and Roll something you listen to, or something you actively participate in?\n\nDistribute Handout 1: Comparing Musical Performances. Play the short clips of live performances from Emerson, Lake, & Palmer “Nutrocker” (1971), The Sex Pistols “Pretty Vacant” (1976), and The Clash “Garageland”(1977). Explain to students that “Nutrocker” is Emerson, Lake & Palmer’s Rock version of The Nutcracker Suite by classical composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.\n\nAfter students have completed the handout, briefly poll students on their answers and discuss with the class as a whole:\n\nWhy would a Rock and Roll band want to perform a version of a Classical composition? What does this suggest about how they seem themselves as artists?\n\nDo the artists in the Sex Pistols and Clash videos seem to view themselves the same way? Why or why not?\n\nIf you had to describe each performance in a single word, what would it be?\n\nWhat do you think are the main differences between the first performance and the second two?\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Divide students into groups of 3-4. Explain that they will be working in these groups to create an original album cover for a fictitious British Punk band of the 1970s. However, before they do so, they must investigate the origins of the Punk Rock movement to have a better understanding of what Punk artists were trying to express.\n\n2. Distribute Handout 2: Punk Rock Discussion Guide and Handout 3: Punk Rock Document Set to each group. Instruct students to use the documents to help them answer the following questions in the discussion guide. (Please note that all of the questions and images below are included in the discussion guide and document set).\n\nMusic\n\n“Virtuosity” is defined as having great technical skill. For which of the bands in the videos is virtuosity more important?\n\nAccording to the interview with Bono, what was Punk Rock’s attitude toward virtuosity? Does he believe you need to be a virtuoso to make Rock and Roll?\n\nLook at the track listings from two different albums. What do you notice about the lengths of the songs? How does the length of the songs on the Clash’s 1977 album reflect what Bono is talking about?\n\nDoes the music created by the virtuosic artists convey the same message as the music performed by the other groups? How might their messages differ?\n\nAudience\n\nWhat do you notice about the performers’ interactions with the audience in the two videos? Is the audience involved? What distinguishes the audience from the performers?\n\nHow would you describe the role of the audience in this picture of Led Zeppelin?\n\n​\n\nHow would you describe the role of the performer in this picture of Rick Wakeman?\n\n​\n\nWho do you think was going to the performance? Watch the clip of the “Sex Pistols Discussing the Music Scene” and speculate as to how they might react to such a concert.\n\nSocial Context\n\nAccording to the Graham Parker video, what was the outlook in Britain in the late 1970s? What are some of the specific words Parker uses to describe the general situation?\n\nWhat do you imagine the situation of young people in particular in this period would have been? What words do you think would best describe their outlook on life?\n\nWhy might young people turn to music to express themselves in this type of situation? If you had been living in this situation, how might you have gone about expressing yourself through music, even if you didn’t have any money or musical training?\n\nDo you think a young person living in this situation would have been more likely to attend a Stadium Rock concert or a Punk Rock show? Why? Do you think that one of the performances in the videos best represents the social and political events of the time? If so, which one and why?\n\nWhat do you imagine the music you would have made in this situation would sound like? (Note the words Parker uses to describe two album titles from this period, which include the words “howling” and “anarchy.”)\n\nCan Punk Rock be considered a form of protest music? If so, what were the people who created it and listened to it protesting?\n\nHow might Punk Rock have been empowering to young people in this time and place? Think about the role of the audience, the sound of the music, and the “DIY” attitude of Punk.\n\nAlbum Covers\n\nHow are the two sets of album covers different?\n\nElton John (1975) and Meat Loaf (1977)\n\nThe Sex Pistols (1977) and The Clash (1977)\n\nWhich covers seem to better represent the idea of virtuosity? The idea of “DIY”? Why?\n\nWhat message do you think the Sex Pistols and the Clash were trying to convey with these album covers? (Note: “Bollocks” is British slang with multiple meanings, but is generally taken to mean “nonsense” or “rubbish.”) Did they make them because they couldn’t afford professional artists to design their covers? What other reasons might there be?\n\nWhich album cover do you find most appealing, and why?\n\nWhy do you think the Clash decided to use this cover for their 1979 album London Calling? Compare it to this this cover from a 1956 Elvis Presley LP. What message do you think the Clash were trying to convey about their music? About how they saw themselves fitting in to the history of Rock and Roll?\n\n3. After students have examined all the documents and completed their discussions, write the following two sentence stems on the board:\n\nPunk Rock was a reaction against______________.\n\nThe main message of Punk Rock was___________.\n\n4. Poll each group for its completion of the sentences, and briefly discuss the similarities and differences among responses.\n\n5. Distribute Handout 4: Guidelines for Designing Your Album Cover. Distribute a piece of construction paper; crayons, markers, or colored pencils; scissors; and old magazines to each group. Ask students to use the materials, as well as the information in their document sets and the understandings gained from their discussions to create an original album cover for a fictitious Punk Rock band in the 1970s. Students may use any additional materials they have to complete the assignment.\n\nSummary Activity:\n\n1. Ask each group to present its album cover to the class as a whole.\n\n2. Ask each group to explain the choices it made in the design, and discuss each group’s choices with the class as a whole.\n\n3. Ask the class to discuss whether or not each group’s design and choices faithfully represent the ideas of Punk Rock.\n\nWriting Prompts:\n\n1. Ask students to use the two sentence stems above to write a journal entry or essay.\n\n2. Use the following quote from Malcolm McLaren, the manager of the Sex Pistols, as a starting point for an essay or journal entry on the origins of Punk Rock: “It’s a call to arms to the kids who believe that rock and roll was taken away from them. It’s a statement of self rule, of ultimate independence.”\n\nExtensions:\n\n1. Ask students to investigate the similarities and differences between the early Punk Rock movements in the United States and Britain. Have them watch the 1976 interview with Patti Smith and her performance of “Redondo Beach”, as well as the 1978 interview with The Ramones and their performance of “Sheena is a Punk Rocker”. To what extent do the ideas of Smith and the Ramones echo the themes about early Punk Rock in Britain discussed in this lesson? In what ways did American Punk reflect similar reactions to popular styles of music in the 1970s? How are Smith and the Ramones’ performances similar to/different from those of the Clash and the Sex Pistols? To what extent should early Punk be thought of as a cohesive movement, and to what extent did it reflect differences in both the social and artistic contexts of Britain and the United States?\n\n2. Using the interviews with Bono and Patti Smith as a starting point, have students create a short musical composition focusing on the idea of “making imagination your only limitation” and the idea of imagination as a source of “liberation.” After viewing and discussing the two clips, invite students (working alone or in small groups) to create a short song. Have students present their songs to the class.\n\nDiscuss as a class: Do students consider these good songs? What makes a song good? Does a song require musical complexity to be “good”? Why or why not?\n\nHandouts\n\nHandout 1: Comparing Musical Performances Handout 2: Punk Rock Discussion Guide Handout 3: Punk Rock Document Set Handout 4: Guidelines for Designing Your Album
