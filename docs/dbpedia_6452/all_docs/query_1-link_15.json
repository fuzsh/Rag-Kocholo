        "text": "Challengers (2024) is a romantic sports drama film from director Luca Guadagnino and writer Justin Kuritzkes. It stars Zendaya as Tashi, a former tennis phenom who enters her superstar husband Art (Mike Faist) in a local tournament to boost his confidence, only to find him facing his former best friend and her ex-boyfriend (Josh O’Connor). The film was originally slated for a debut at the 2023 Venice Film Festival, before the actors’ strike pushed its premiere back to April of this year. What propelled this to the top of the box office?\n\nMy interest in this movie has been high over the past year for several reasons. It is a perfect intersection of all kinds of movie elements we seldom see anymore: sports action, steamy romance, and mid-budget drama aimed at adults rather than family-friendly audiences. That, coupled with one of the most intriguing directors working today (Luca Guadagnino), made this a must-see for me when it came out in theaters late last month. My expectations were tempered somewhat by the news that this was delayed from August of last year (already a bad release date for both box office and awards prospects) to April (similarly dire in both regards), indicating that perhaps the studio had little faith in this as a player. Luckily, though, this movie is total aces: a winning drama with heart, intrigue, messiness, and great character designs that kept me riveted all the way through!\n\nThe movie starts and ends at the same place: the final match of a challenger event in some no-name town. The first scene sees the match begin, with us not really understanding who these two guys are and why this woman in the audience seems so invested in the outcome of their match. The end sees the match reach its climax, only a couple of hours later. But by that point, the audience is fully invested in their story, because of the clever use of flashbacks to deepen our understanding of these two men and the unique relationship both share with the woman in the stands. The non-linear storytelling works very well because it allows Kuritzkes to start the film right in the middle of the action and end it there too, while peppering in the story throughout without losing the audience with copious backstory and walls of exposition.\n\nThe way the flashbacks are interspersed throughout the story is also extremely well-done. For one thing, the structure of the final match between Art and Patrick mirrors that of their relationship: Patrick wins the first set as flashbacks reveal he won Tashi’s heart first; Art then wins the second set as his past self swoops in after Patrick fucks up in the relationship and marries Tashi himself. That sets up the proverbial third and final set, in which both men are unsure where they stand with Tashi (and each other) and must battle for supremacy. We also get key information at various points throughout the story that changes our understanding of their dynamic. For instance, at one point we learn that Tashi cheated on Art with Patrick just a few years ago; later we learn that Tashi met with Patrick the night before the final and asked him to throw the match. At every step along the way, Kuritzkes ups the ante and makes the stakes feel ever-higher and causes us to become even more invested in the results of their match (and relationship).\n\nThe marketing of the film plays up the steamy romantic aspects of the film, which are definitely present throughout and makes the film a helluva lot of fun to watch! Seeing Patrick and Art begin as friends and develop into rivals for the affections of Tashi was hilarious and heartfelt, and we really feel the passion between the three of them from the smallest to the grandest of moments. Guadagnino is a director who really GETS romance – all of his film nail the minutia of courtship and desire, from the little nonverbal signals to the significance of small physical acts of touch that make up a love affair. The only real critique I have is the overt homoerotic overtones of the first half between Art and Patrick – Guadagnino and Kuritzkes seem fixated on highlighting how sexy and flirty private male spaces like locker rooms and saunas can be. As a straight guy who played sports in his youth, this was not my experience at all and didn’t really resonate with me, but hey, I’m not the one telling this story so I won’t harp on it too much.\n\nI also have to compliment the technical aspects of the film, which are virtually flawless. One of the big risks with a sports film like this is that the audience will be able to tell that these are not professional athletes at the height of their powers. There are times this is mildly the case, but I totally bought all three as young phenoms and thought the tennis sequences were all well-shot to play around their weaknesses. It’s obvious at times that there is no actual, physical ball present that they are hitting, but all the other elements are there: postures, swings, physical ticks and mannerisms, and the general way they carry themselves between points, never breaking the immersion for me. Guadagnino keeps these sequences upbeat with snappy editing and flashy camera moves, and HOLY COW the score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is easily their best since The Social Network: an electro-house wet dream of pulsing beats and infectious rhythms that had me grinning from ear to ear.\n\nFinally let’s discuss the acting, particularly from our leads Zendaya, Josh O’Connor and Mike Faist. Zendaya gets her juiciest role to date as Tashi, an ambitious woman hampered by injuries and insecurity about whether she wound up with the right partner in life. I love that this script gives her the room to make mistakes and display negative character traits, making her feel more human and giving Zendaya more of a chance to show off her range of abilities. Josh O’Connor was also lovable as the rogue-ish womanizer Patrick, showing off his natural charm and charisma at every step. The script also makes it clear that he is “boyfriend material” only: good for short-term flings and passionate affairs, but not necessarily long-term commitment. Mike Faist impressed me as the more mature but under-achieving Art, perfectly embodying that kind of guy who is always there for you but is also somewhat boring to be with. The script gives him the least to work with, but he does a lot with a little and stands toe-to-toe with the other two, showcasing his character’s quiet intensity and simmering frustrations that he struggles to keep under the surface. As with any great script, subtext is key, and all three actors nail those small things left unspoken, the stuff in between the margins that make a character feel real rather than just words on a page.\n\nConclusion\n\nChallengers is a fucking blast! It’s the kind of movie they don’t make often enough these days: a steamy romantic action drama with hot stars, a banging soundtrack, and a fantastic screenplay that aims to do nothing but entertain. All three leads are superb and hopefully have long and fruitful careers ahead of them, particularly O’Connor and Faist, who have thrived in the indie space for a long time and desperately needed this mainstream breakthrough. Reznor and Ross deliver one of my favorite film scores in a while, and Luca Guadagnino continues to wow me with his wide range of subject matter and visual style in his filmography without sacrificing quality. A total winner!\n\nVERDICT: A\n\nAll image rights belong to United Artists and Amazon MGM Studios.\n\n-Austin Daniel"
