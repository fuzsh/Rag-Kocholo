The Board of Finance is looking to extend the formal part of the Capital Improvement Plan from five years to a full 10 years, and discussed the possibility at its August 12 meeting.Chairman Jim Gaston said he would like to have a 10 year plan and thinks expanding it beyond the current five year plan, with another five years being “suggestions,” is a “good idea.”“My thought is that the CIP is a fluid, moving document,” said Gaston. “The further out you go, the better it is.”Gaston said he would put together formal language for the policy change.The CIP is the town’s plan to help it schedule out large expenditures such as building improvements, new buildings, and other big ticket items and keep the town’s bonding levels as stable as possible. Generally the town budgets for $7 to $10 million in new bonding each year. This year on the CIP was a “bonding vacation,” with no new bonding added.First Selectman Jeff Capeci said he thought the five year plan “works well,” but it is also good to “keep sight beyond five years,” believing that the current plan having suggestions beyond five years was good enough.“I’m not sure if you add five additional years on, what that would look like,” said Capeci.Finance Director Glenys Salas was hesitant to weigh in, as it is her first year acting as the town’s finance director and her first time working on a CIP. She did note that she had not seen other municipalities using CIPs beyond five years, and felt the further out the plan, the more there is “significant variability” between the plan’s cost estimate and the actual cost of the project.BOF member Barney Molloy said that from his experience, “five years is a good working document,” but felt the town could “go beyond” for the next five years and make it “less aspirational and more of a guideline.”While he wasn’t concerned with the estimated costs of the project, he felt having a more solid time line on when projects would be committed to would be helpful to the town.“We should be more committed to what the plan looks like,” said Molloy. “Capital costs are not decreasing, times to build are not decreasing.”He noted that Public Works Director Fred Hurley “has a good grasp on when bridges and roads will be done” but Hurley will “not be with the town forever.”“Maybe the second five years may not be as precise, but it would be helpful bracketing where we are going to go,” said Molloy.Molloy also noted that the facilities study that the town is currently working on, to determine the operational lifespan of the town’s inventory of buildings, will be a “big nut to crack.”BOF member Bryce Chinault was curious on how often the town has stuck to what has been put into a five year plan. He also said that he was supportive of initiatives to look beyond five years.“Newtown will be here for a while, so it’s reasonable to look at it,” said Chinault.Editor Jim Taylor can be reached at jim@thebee.com.

Fire Reports Story Fire Reports | August 14-August 21, 2024 Fire Reports | August 18-24, 2021 News None\n\nTorrential Rain, Flooding Rampages Across Newtown, Surrounding AreaNewtown and surrounding communities are picking up the pieces after torrential rains and flooding on August 18.Newtown received 10 inches of rain and Sandy Hook received 12.17 inches, as rivers overflowed, roads washed out, some homes were flooded and a few destroyed, and motorists became trapped in flooded vehicles over the course of Sunday, August 18, into the early hours of Monday, August 19.By late Sunday afternoon, First Selectman Jeff Capeci declared a State of Emergency for Newtown due to continued flooding and sewer capacity issues. That declaration, he said the following afternoon, will allow the Town to secure state and federal aid. Capeci had been in touch, he said, with Governor Ned Lamont, State Representative Mitch Bolinsky and State Senator Tony Hwang, “who are mobilizing state resources to assist us.” Lamont also declared a state of emergency for the state.Newtown Emergency Communications Center Director Maureen Will issued multiple CodeRED announcements on Sunday, warning recipients of the dangers of the rain and subsequent flooding. Will repeatedly asked people to remain at home or where they were, and to not drive into any standing water.Those calling dispatch for help with flooding within their homes were cautioned that first responders would be dispatched to those locations only in the event of a life emergency.As was noted on the Newtown Police Department Facebook page, “We only have resources for true emergency calls.”One family did have a very close call on Sunday. Multiple agencies were sent to a home on South Main Street after a man became trapped in the basement there (see related story). The man was reportedly caught in up to six feet of water before first responders were able to rescue him.Many roads quickly became impassable due to flooding and/or debris causing damage. First responders and Town officials were inundated with calls for help once homes and buildings became flooded.Additionally, vehicles began getting stuck on roads after operators drove into water that was deeper than they realized. Botsford and Newtown Hook & Ladder firefighters, and Newtown Underwater Search And Rescue (NUSAR) members were among those called to the area of 220 South Main Street to perform multiple high water rescues after operators drove into high waters there. NUSAR, Botsford and Dodgingtown Fire were also dispatched to a water rescue near the area of South Main at Button Shop Road. NUSAR was also dispatched to assist with water rescues in Bridgewater and Redding on Sunday.At daybreak Monday, multiple vehicles were still being fished out of streams, including a series of vehicles that had been washed to the north of South Main Street/Route 25 opposite Bryan Lane by the surging Pootatuck River.An employee of Modzelewski’s Recovery & Repair told The Newtown Bee that by 8 am Monday, various Modzelewski’s crews working in Newtown, Southbury, Oxford, Redding and Weston had done “at least 100” vehicle rescues since the previous afternoon.With heavy rains continuing, many residents began seeing unexpected water in their homes. By 5 pm Sunday, 28 calls for help pumping water out of homes all across town had been recorded by Newtown Emergency Communications Center. Dozens of similar calls were recorded on Monday and early Tuesday.Amid those calls, first responders were still called on for “everyday” emergencies — medical assists, potential gas leaks, and car crashes also occurred during the storm.Damaged RoadsIn the immediate aftermath of the storm, 23 roads were closed and impassable due to structural damage/washouts: Currituck Road at Signal Post, Berkshire Road/Route 34 from Jordan Hill Road to the town line, Bradley Lane, Jordan Hill Road, Pond Brook Road, Great Ring Road at Sand Hill, Stony Brook, Mile Hill South, Sugar Loaf at Sherman Street, The Boulevard at Hall Lane, Taunton Lake Road, Meadow Brook at Huntingtown, Bennetts Bridge Road, Town End Road, New Lebbon Road, Lakeview Terrace Extension, Great Quarter near #77, South Main Street at Bryan Lane, Berkshire Road/Route 34 near #111, 100 Wasserman Way, High Bridge Road, Hattertown Road, and Turkey Hill Road.Some roads were added and others removed as repairs were completed over the following few days, with South Main Street/Route 25 near 220 South Main Street and Berkshire/Route 34 at the Monroe line being major town arteries that remained closed into Monday morning. South Main Street was reopened by mid-Monday morning, after the water receded and the last of the vehicles removed from the area. One lane of Berkshire Road remained closed as of midday Wednesday, with DOT crews directing the alternating lanes of traffic.Just over the town line, Roosevelt Drive/Route 34 at the Stevenson Dam had been completely washed out.On Tuesday, Capeci reported that Great Quarter Road, Saw Mill Road, and Lakeview Terrace Extension had become accessible. Most of the town parks, fields, and recreational facilities suffered “minimal damage.”Eichler’s Cove and Marina, however, “faced significant storm damage and the beach must remain closed for the rest of the season as Parks and Recreation staff focus on rebuilding, dredging, and preparing it for next year,” he stated in a midday update. Residents are asked to refrain from attempting to access Eichler’s Cove. Boat slip owners will receive a detailed email with specific instructions, according to the notice.Capeci said he had a chance to meet with US Senator Richard Blumenthal on Monday, and that he showed photos of the damage to public infrastructure and private property to the senator. A Newtown resident facing potential total loss of property on South Main Street also had the opportunity to speak with the senator, who discussed possible federal assistance through FEMA disaster recovery.Capeci also said that Rob Sibley, the town director of land use, is “documenting damage throughout the town to help us secure reimbursement for local expenditures.”On Monday, Capeci reported in his announcement that 36 locations had been recognized as suffering “severe damage.”“In four areas, residents are cut off, and Public Works is working on restoring their access to main roads,” the first selectman said.“Making all roads passable again will take several days to weeks,” Capeci cautioned. “As damage is evaluated and we are better able to forecast repairs I will update you,” he promised.Capeci is asking residents to allow Public Works and other Town employees to do their work undisturbed. They will be out, “assessing or repairing damage,” he said. “They are working long hours to make Newtown drivable again and deserve your patience.”As of Monday morning, no fatalities or serious injuries had been reported in Newtown.Washouts, Ruts And MudEd Lundblad was among the Lakeview Terrace residents walking around, assessing damage to their homes and the neighborhood on Monday. Lundblad’s house had water coursing through it on Sunday, he said, leaving mud and other debris inside.His waterfront property lost three of its retaining walls, and a deep crevice was dug into the southern area of his property.Just east of his home, a combined crew of LRM Inc and Town Public Works employees was working to clear and then fill a gaping hole left in the road. Residents of at least six homes were trapped behind the washout until it could be filled.Lakeview Terrace residents Gloria and Gary Milas were heading home early Sunday afternoon when the rain intensified. They attend church in Seymour and each had traveled out and back in separate vehicles. He was a few minutes ahead of her for the ride home.“Around 1:30, he called me to tell me the roads were bad,” Gloria said Monday morning. “I was scared, I was almost crying,” she admitted. “The rain was so heavy and I couldn’t see very well.”To get to their home, the Milases usually follow Bennetts Bridge until it becomes Lakeview Terrace. On Sunday, however, she made the decision to take Gelding Hill Road, which connects Bennetts Bridge to Lakeview Terrace, but circumvents the lowest sections of Bennetts Bridge and avoids a narrow bridge on a very tight corner.“Gelding Hill was a much better choice,” she said. “There were two big dips I had to drive through, but after that the rest of the drive on Lakeview was fine.”When they woke up Monday morning, the Milases were doubly glad they’d made it home the previous afternoon. Their driveway was gutted, with deep ruts that prevented most passenger vehicles from using it.“I called out of work,” Gloria said mid-morning. “We were stuck because of our driveway.”As they were assessing that damage, however, a stranger operating a Kubota mini excavator was en route toward the Lundblad residence. The driver stopped, offered his help, and within minutes the worst ruts were being filled in.The Milases never even got the man’s name. As he was leaving their driveway, the couple saw a neighbor walking toward them.“One neighbor came by with their kids, and another family came by with shovels,” she said. “People are stopping by and helping. They’re checking to see if we need anything. It’s been amazing.“This,” she said, “is what makes things so nice in Newtown.”Stevenson DamFirstLight, the owner of Stevenson Dam, which creates Lake Zoar, reported on August 21 that following the rain and associated flooding that impacted Southwestern Connecticut and the lower Housatonic River, “both man-made and natural debris made its way downstream and collected above the Stevenson Dam. Starting Thursday, August 22nd, FirstLight will begin a phased effort to safely address the debris field.“Smaller woody debris that made it past the boat barrier will be sent over the Stevenson Dam in the coming days, beginning Thursday. Where it is safe to do so, FirstLight will remove large man-made and woody debris from Lake Lillinonah and Lake Zoar, and in coordination with the Town of Monroe, FirstLight will stockpile the recovered man-made debris like docks and water vessels at the former Monroe Town Beach just upstream of the Monroe Boat Launch. Affected residents will then be able to recover their belongings from that area.“Those who recreate on Lake Housatonic, Lake Zoar and Lake Lillinonah should exercise extreme caution in the days and weeks ahead as debris makes its way downstream,” the statement noted.The storm impacted areas well beyond Newtown. Among the hardest hit were Southbury, Oxford, and Seymour.The CT Mirror reported that Oxford was one of the hardest hit municipalities in the region. In separate incidents, two women died after they were swept away Sunday evening as firefighters tried to rescue them from their vehicles, which were overtaken by floodwaters.“Oxford got sucker-punched yesterday and taken out at the knees,” said State Senator Eric Berthel, who represents the region in the legislature.“Our infrastructure is broken. Our main highway that runs through this town is broken. We have lost life. We have lost businesses,” Berthel added. “And we will need the full strength of the local, state and federal government to fix this beautiful town and to get it back running in the right direction again.”Officials Seek FEMA AidOn Tuesday, Governor Ned Lamont announced he had submitted a request to President Joe Biden and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) seeking a federal emergency declaration for Fairfield, New Haven and Litchfield counties in response to the extreme flooding from the historic rainfall that portions of Connecticut received earlier this week.The governor is requesting under such a declaration the support of direct federal assistance to supplement the state and its municipalities in meeting critical emergency protective requirements and providing restorative efforts that defend public safety. This includes a request for the US Army Corps of Engineers to provide support for the repairing of dozens of bridges, dams, and other infrastructure, as well as for the Environmental Protection Agency to provide support in response to the numerous oil tanks, propane cylinders, vehicles, vessels, and drums that are floating in multiple waterways. Additionally, the governor is also requesting assistance from the Federal Highway Administration for the numerous destroyed and compromised state roads.Crews from the Connecticut Department of Transportation, with the support of their local counterparts, have been working since the immediate aftermath of the storm to assess, clean, and repair washouts on state roads where possible, as well as secure these areas to prevent further damage. The state agency has also begun the process of developing plans for repairing the severely damaged Route 34 so that it can be reopened in a timely manner, as well as for other structures that need to be replaced.“This was an extreme amount of rainfall in an incredibly short period of time that resulted in historic levels of flooding in western Connecticut,” Lamont said. “Our state experienced two fatalities in which people were swept away from flood waters, and first responders bravely rescued and evacuated hundreds of people during and after the storm. Scores of state and local roads are washed away or compromised, dams and bridges have been affected, and oil tanks, vehicles, and other hazardous items were flooded into waterways. I appreciate President Biden and FEMA for considering this request to assist our state and municipalities with the immediate effort to protect public safety in the aftermath of this devastation.”This request for a federal emergency declaration is not to be confused with a request for a FEMA major disaster declaration, which could provide federal funding to support homeowners, businesses, and local and state governments with financial assistance for the costs of repairing and rebuilding infrastructure damaged in the storm. That type of declaration requires the state and local governments to provide FEMA with a detailed accounting of all public and uninsured private property damage incurred as a direct result of the storm and a cost estimate that can determine whether certain thresholds have been met. That process typically takes several weeks to complete, and the Lamont administration is already working with municipalities to conduct it. Any homeowners and business owners who experienced damage to their property from this storm are strongly urged to contact their town’s local emergency management office as soon as possible so that their damages can be documented as part of this effort.Also on Tuesday, State Senator Tony Hwang joined Lamont, Blumenthal, State Senate Republican Leader Stephen Harding, Berthel, DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, DOT Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto, and many other stakeholders to update impacted communities on the weekend’s severe storms. At a press conference that day, Hwang made a strong call for a federal declaration of emergency across impacted towns to allow federal emergency funds to be directed toward repairs of roads, bridges, and other key infrastructure.“I saw firsthand the destruction and devastation this weekend’s storms wreaked on Newtown and nearby communities,” he said.My deepest condolences go out to the families of the two women lost to the storm’s flooding. I was moved by the immediacy with which neighbors sprung into action to help their fellow residents who were impacted. This community has really come together in the last few days,” Hwang remarked. “I am working with all necessary stakeholders, including federal officials, to acquire necessary emergency funding to help heal our communities. Roadways used by thousands to commute and go about everyday errands have been severely affected, resulting in long detours and deleterious impacts on local businesses. A swift response is needed.”Hwang surveyed the damage in Newtown with local first responders and elected officials. During a visit to The Newtown Bee office on Monday, Hwang pulled up photos on his cell phone. “There is a car in Lake Lillinonah,” he said incredulously. “A car!”Witnessing the most severe damage firsthand, he committed to a robust storm response, coordinating with state and federal officials to ensure all necessary resources are allocated for community repair. He specifically noted the swift action needed to repair major travel routes in Newtown such as State Routes 25, 6 and 34.While Hwang said he is doing everything in his power to ensure a swift storm response, he also offered some long-term solutions to address these climate events. Hwang has long been a proponent of increased funding for storm resilience in at-risk communities. Storms have become more intense, and more frequent in recent years as the climate has changed, bringing costly damage. Funds could be used to implement bioswales, reinforce structures against flooding, provide augmented storm warning services, and much more.=====Managing Editor Shannon Hicks contributed to this story.Editor Jim Taylor can be reached at jim@thebee.com.-1-1Newtown received 10 inches of rain and Sandy Hook received 12.17 inches, as rivers overflowed, roads washed out, some homes were flooded and a few destroyed, and motorists became trapped in flooded vehicles over the course of Sunday, August 18, into the early hours of Monday, August 19. —Newtown Bee graphic-1-1One vehicle is to be removed from an area north of South Main Street, opposite Bryan Lane, after it was swept off the road during Sunday’s rain.

One of the FAQs we receive from visitors doing tours of our building is “Where do you get your story ideas from?” While many stories recap planned events such as Town board and commission meetings or sporting competitions, sometimes they walk right in our front door. We thought that happened about a week and a half ago, when Jan and John Holly stopped in the office. The Hollys visited because they held — or so they thought — documents that showed some of Jan’s ancestors were early settlers in our town. We made plans to sit down further with Jan and John after last week’s deadlines, took photos of the documents for some pre-interview reading, and even took their photos for a potential story. All was set … until Jan called back about an hour later and said they’d been able to meet Town Historian Ben Cruson. Ben took a quick look at the papers and clarified what they were looking at. It turns out Jan’s ancestors settled in then-named Newtown, N.Y., which was later renamed Jamaica. Jan called, still laughing over a very understandable error, and said John was already resetting the ol’ Garmin to help them find their way a little further south.The Hollys should be safely home by now. We hope they enjoyed Newtown, Conn., and Newtown/Jamaica, N.Y. I know we enjoyed meeting them, and now we all have something to laugh about if we’re lucky enough to see them again down the road.Final reminder this week that the annual maintenance at Newtown Community Center and Newtown Senior Center is scheduled for Monday, August 26-Sunday, September 1. The building will also be closed Monday, September 2, for Labor Day. Definitely mark your calendar so you aren’t disappointed by showing up any of those days to find the doors at 8 Simpson Street locked up tight. There will be activity inside the building, of course, but nothing for the public to take part in.I hope everyone is drying out after last weekend’s record-breaking rain. I give both paws up for those who responded to all the calls for help when people started having water pour into their homes or had other frightening things start happening because of surging water. I know many people are contending with water damage inside homes and elsewhere on property, and I feel for you. Others needed to call 911 after they drove into standing water and found themselves not only in vehicles that couldn’t go any further, but also in danger of being swept away.Props also to those who were out there on Sunday and beyond, repairing more than three dozen local roads that washed out. It was an amazing turnaround, going from about 40 roads that were fully or partially closed Monday morning, to just four or five still fully impassable by Tuesday morning. Those last few are going to be stubborn problems for a while, but we’re lucky everyone can now at least get around town again even if it means planning further ahead for potentially longer routes.The co-coordinators of Newtown’s National Night Out — already postponed from earlier this month due to weather — ended up cancelling the event this year, which had been rescheduled to Tuesday, August 20. It was a tough decision, according to co-organizer Matt Ariniello. The director of Newtown Community Center said on Monday that with “many of our local first responders … currently tied up assisting residents and their communities during the natural disaster … we have made the difficult decision to cancel this year’s National Night Out.” Similarly, fellow co-organizer Newtown PD on its Facebook page said it too had “made the difficult decision to cancel our National Night Out event in order to direct our emergency resources to flood recovery for the foreseeable future.” Fortunately, both entities mentioned looking forward to next year, so there’s that.If there hadn’t been so much rain and local damage, it would almost be ironic that a car wash planned for last Sunday was postponed ... due to the weather. Volunteers could have saved some water if the weather had cooperated just a little better — just look at how well the Knights of Columbus did back in April, when they had a Saturday morning car wash planned and there was rain at the onset of that event. They held on, the rain cleared, and the Knights still did well with their fundraiser. The Newtown High School Wrestling Alumni, Families & Supporters couldn’t follow the same game plan last weekend, however. Their August 18 car wash, a four-hour event to be conducted at Newtown Middle School, was postponed to Sunday, September 15. Washes will be done for donations and the event will still run from 10 am until 2 pm. If you’d like to support the team but can’t get to the event that day, they do accept Venmo (@NHSWrestling).I hope everyone who enjoys using our Town beach got their final swims in for the summer because Eichler’s Cove is closed for the season, a little earlier than planned following last weekend’s rain. Treadwell Park Pool was closed on Monday, but reopened Tuesday on its shorter late-season schedule. Lifeguards are currently working weekdays from 4 to 7 pm, and weekends from 9 am-7 pm. Treadwell Pool will continue on that schedule for the week of August 26-September 1. Hours for Labor Day Monday, September 2, will be 1-7 pm. The pool will then close for the season.Speaking of last weekend’s storm one final time, belated birthday wishes to Maureen Will. The director of emergency communications for Newtown spent a good part of her birthday Sunday with fellow Emergency Management directors at the Emergency Operations Center.Let’s look forward for at least a minute, shall we? Organizers of the 2024 Newtown Arts Festival this week announced the headliners for Friday night’s Music Under the Stars. Quietly, organizers still have a lot of volunteer openings for the three-day weekend that will dominate the Fairfield Hills campus September 20-22. This is a great opportunity for individuals, couples, families, friends — anyone! — or all ages to spend some time immersed within the arts. There are many openings still available as of this week, some beginning as early as Thursday, September 19. There’s everything from general site team assistance and artisan setup to musician assistance, traffic control and perimeter security, assisting with various activities, and even breaking down/cleanup. Visit newtownartsfestival.com/volunteer for full details.I hope that’s enough storytelling and information sharing for one more week.

Top of the Mountain Story Top of the Mountain Features None\n\nLabor Day Parade Plans Falling Into StepOrganizers are looking at dozens of groups planning to participate in the Newtown Labor Day Parade, which will step off at 10 am one week from today.With the extension of registration for the 62nd Newtown Labor Day Parade, organizers are looking at dozens of groups planning to participate in the town’s long-standing end-of-summer celebration.The parade will step off at 10 am Monday, September 2, from Main Street at Currituck Road. Participants will travel south on Main Street, turn onto and follow the length of Glover Avenue, and then turn left onto Queen Street. The route concludes at the intersection of Queen Street and Church Hill Road.Parade Marshals Sue and Jim Shortt will lead the celebration, along with their handpicked judges. That group will disembark from their ride in front of My Place Restaurant, where the reviewing stand will be set up between the popular eatery and neighboring Bank of America.Emcees will be stationed with the Shortts and their judges — Chris Locke, Eileen Marchese, Lee Paulsen, Theresa Salvatore, and Janet Volmer — on Queen Street. The Shortts will be chaperoned by Locke, and the judges will be transported over the parade route by Jimmy Johnson.This year’s parade theme is “Garden of Plenty.”After almost 30 years of organic farming, the Shortts have become a pillar in town feeding thousands through their farm store, community supported agriculture program, and by collaborating with Real Food CT. Earlier this year they opened an ice cream stand, which came on the heels of their farm becoming USDA certified organic.The farm, on Riverside Road in Sandy Hook, started in 1995 with just Jim and his mother, the late Dolly Shortt. It has continued since, and expanded, with Jim and Sue’s sons, James and Jesse, now involved in the family business. A small staff supplements the work done by the Shortts.Labor Day Parade Line of March Co-Coordinator Melissa Kopcik described the couple as “well-known, friendly faces around town” when announcing their appointment as Grand Marshals earlier this year. The committee was looking for unsung heroes of the town, she said in June, “and these two hardworking farmers were an obvious choice.”Parade NotesTwo escort divisions will again open the parade on September 2. Continuing a longstanding tradition, Newtown Police Department, Newtown PD Honor Guard and Newtown High School Marching Band & Color Guard will have the lead positions.Four divisions will make up the parade this year, with 71 organizations, clubs, bands, nonprofit organizations, businesses and others registered as of August 21.Kopcik is excited that many returning participants will be joined by some newcomers for this year’s parade.“Excitement is building and participation is strong this year,” she said August 19. “Among those joining us for the first time is Sporre Tree Service, Plato’s Closet, Pixie Dust Princesses, Tap & Pony Mobile Bar Truck, Danbury Hat Tricks Junior Hockey Players, and the one and only ‘Tina Turner.’”“Turner” will be joining returning impersonators Neil Diamond and Elvis Presley, who have made appearances in recent years.Newtown Forest Association, celebrating its centennial anniversary this year, “is back after a few years’ hiatus,” Kopcik also said. NFA plans to showcase the new Christmas tree it will be planting soon in Sandy Hook Center, she said.“This will be quite a sight to see,” she added. “We would like to give them a warm welcome back and look forward to viewing the new Christmas tree.”The Newtown 10U and 9U Hawks teams are also in the line of march. Both Newtown Babe Ruth Baseball teams have had tremendous summers. The 10Hawks won the state championship, then represented New England in the Cal Ripken World Series, where they went 3-1 in pool play. The 9U team finished its season in mid-July as runners-up in their age group at the New England Regional Tournament.Judges will again not only have some of the best seats along the route that morning, they will also be taking notes to compare with each other after the final participant passes their location. Honors will be announced for Best Float, Best Musical Entry Junior or Senior, Most Patriotic, Best School, Best Fire Company, Best New Entry, Most Fitting Parade Theme, Most Colorful Entry, Most Crowd Pleasing (a/k/a Rooster Award), and Best Non-Musical.The full line of march will be published in print and online next week.Fundraising ContinuesThe Newtown Labor Day Parade committee generally needs between $25,000-$30,000 to stage the Labor Day Parade, Kopcik said recently. While some of those funds are raised through participation fees, the committee relies on sponsorships and donations.Kopcik was happy to announce August 15 that the committee is “almost at our goal.”The parade, a 501(c)(3), is 100% self-funded and organized by volunteers.Donations can be made through newtownctlabordayparade.org. Checks payable to Newtown Labor Day Parade Inc can be mailed to Newtown Labor Day Parade, PO Box 746, Newtown CT 06470.The parade route will be closed to non-parade traffic by 9:30 am the day of the parade, and will remain closed until at least 12:30 pm or until the final unit finishes the route.=====Managing Editor Shannon Hicks can be reached at shannon@thebee.com.-1-1Tappan Zee Bridge Men perform during the 2023 Newtown Labor Day Parade.

August 27, 1999HOMETOWN NEWSPAPER OF Judy Benson.* * * * *David Merrill was not born in Newtown but his years of painting the murals in Edmond Town Hall have linked him intimately with the town’s history. His framed lithographs of Newtown are hung in many homes and buildings; his murals grace the walls of 18th Century houses as well as the staircases and hallways of the town hall. So when the Newtown Summer Festival Summer Committee selected the theme “Newtown: A Picture-Perfect Town” for this year’s Labor Day Parade, it was only fitting that they select the well-known artist for the honor of being the parade’s grand marshal.* * * * *It was another blue-ribbon year for Mary Ann Novaco at this year’s Bridgewater Fair. In meeting this summer’s drought head-on, the Newtown resident simply diversified. The prize-winning gardener and canner took home first place in four categories — best vegetable display, pearls, shallots, and beets.* * * * *Several hundred people attended the 23rd annual Ukrainian Festival at Olga Paproski’s farm on Hattertown Road on Sunday. The festival, sponsored by St Mary’s Ukrainian Catholic Church in Bridgeport, featured Ukrainian and picnic-style food, crafts, exhibits of native costumes, music, hayrides, pony rides, children’s activities, raffles, a display of old and antique tractors, and programs and Ukrainian songs and dances. Proceeds benefited the parish.* * * * *Patty Murren knew she would have to play over her head if she was going to win her first round qualifying match last Friday at the Pilot Pen International Tennis Tournament in New Haven. After all, Emilie Loit of France was the 90th ranked player in the world. And as good a player as Murren has become, the gap between the two was huge. The Newtown resident entered the match ranked 476. In the end, it was the 20-year-old Loit winning, 6-2, 6-4. … The former Immaculate/Wake Forest player, 25, turned pro three weeks ago. She took home $500 for last week’s effort.* * * * *Robert J. Murdy, son of Kathy and Rich Murdy, was officially awarded Scouting’s highest rank, that of Eagle Scout, at a Court of Honor held in the Newtown Meeting House. For his project, Robert gave Cullens Memorial a new face lift. Robert and 26 volunteers worked 302 hours over a five day period to scrape and polyurethane the wood floor, install carpet and paint the kitchen cabinets, windows, and trim. Robert said he appreciated the fact that Newtown Hardware, Home Depot, Mathison Floors, Sears, and Cullens Memorial contributed generously the supplies and equipment necessary to complete the project. He also extends his gratitude to the four scoutmasters that lead Troop 70. Robert will attend the University of Connecticut in September.August 23, 1974EDITORIAL INK DROPS — NOT THE RIGHT PLAN FOR NEWTOWN: A far too sparse gathering attended the public hearing on Tuesday evening at the Edmond Town Hall to hear the proposal of new zoning regulations which would permit the construction of cluster housing and condominiums in Newtown. This particular hearing has been a long time coming, for the town of Newtown is looked upon as an ideal target for this type of housing by outsiders and a good area to move in on. Looking at the picture from the inside, we do not share the same enthusiasm for such a rapid move to multiple housing.* * * * *Vandalism has struck the Town Park twice so far this week. On Monday night, August 19, a lead casting of a lion’s head, appropriately donated by the Lions Club, was unbolted from its mooring in the children’s pool and taken away. A screen window on the men’s room window was snipped as the vandals tried to open the window and enter. Most senseless of all, the brass plaque at the entrance to the park reading “A. Fenn Dickinson Memorial Park” was taken away. On Tuesday, Stop and Do Not Enter signs were uprooted and flung aside. These incidents follow a midnight assault on the park the week before on Wednesday, August 14, when six youthful vandals overturned a picnic table, tore shingles off a storage shed and tried to overturn that too. Park and Recreation Commission Chairman David Larson called the vandalism “malicious. Everything in the park was donated by somebody or some organization. Only recently has there been town capital investment in the park. I could understand protesting against the establishment, but in this case, the people are the establishment.”* * * * *Thirty-one residents and land owners attended a general meeting of the Pootatuck Park Association on Saturday evening, August 17, at the Town Hall, and actions to be taken by the recently incorporated association regarding road improvements have begun firming up. According to association president Mrs Socha Larsen, the Pootatuck Park residents, voting on the basis of funds accrued through payment of dues, have approved three roads for improvement, beginning in September with the assistance of the Town.* * * * *The survey for unlicensed dogs in Newtown is still continuing, with pooch after pooch being found without tags. However, according to Sgt Michael Fekete of the Police Department, persons who have been given notification to have their dogs licensed have been doing so. The survey will continue throughout the month, and residents are reminded that if they do not heed the notice to license their dog within five days, they are subject to a $25 fine. Licenses may be obtained at the Office of the Town Clerk in Edmond Town Hall from 9-5 week days.August 19, 1949The trustees of the Cyrenius H. Booth Library have in the past few days sent an appeal to all friends of the library to make a contribution to the annual drive for funds needed to augment its regular income. Townspeople who have long enjoyed the free services of this vital local institution are urged to contribute generously according to their ability but the appeal emphasizes that gifts of any amount are welcome. Every adult subscriber can afford a dollar or two — or more. Checks or cash can be mailed to Herbert C. Hubbell, treasurer or handed to him at the Newtown Savings Bank.* * * * *Caroline Hill, Betty Cox and Lucy James, classmates in Hawley High school, left last Saturday for a week’s stay at Lake Winnipesaukee. They were taken to Alton Bay, N.H. by Mr and Mrs Arnold Hill of Castle View Farm. While there the girls will occupy a cottage owned by Mrs Hill’s grandmother, Mrs Charles E. Bugbee, Sr, and are being accompanied by Mrs Hill’s mother, Mrs Charles E. Bugbee, Jr.* * * * *Visitors to Town offices on the first floor of Edmond Town Hall during the past two weeks have been curious as to the activities of a scholarly looking gentleman operating a microfilm camera on a table just outside the office of Town Clerk May Sullivan. The setup is rather formidable. A tri-pod supports camera, reflectors, photo floodlamps and two large wings that protect wandering eyes from the lights. On the table beneath the camera’s point of focus lies an open book of deeds or of wills. The films are gathering on their 35-millimeter surfaces, two pages at a time, vital records of Newtown.* * * * *Mr and Mrs Thomas Cunningham, formerly of Mile Hill road, wish to express their sincere thanks to the many friends who sent cards and flowers to their daughter, Kathy, who is home from a second visit at Lenox Hill hospital. She is progressing slowly.* * * * *On Tuesday evening of this week the Auxiliary of the Raymond L. Pease Post, 163, American Legion, elected Mrs Florence May president for the ensuing year. Other officers elected at the annul meeting held in Sandy Hook Hotel were as follows: Mrs Lauvisa Lane, vice president; Mrs Elsie Harris, secretary; Mrs Belle Lockwood, chaplain; Mrs Louise Mularcik, historian; and Mrs Joan Tani, sergeant-at-arms. Mrs Ellen Trolland of Nichols, past third district president, was present and obligated the incoming officers.August 15, 1924Miss Viola Geckle and brother, Louis, who recently purchased the Mah-John Ice Cream Parlor of Frederick Crouch, are reported doing excellent business. Besides handling ice cream, candy and confections, they will specialize in home made pastry. Advance orders on pastry will receive careful attention.* * * * *July 25, 1925. Dear Brother Allison and the rest of the Bee Force: The last time I wrote to you was from Paris. We went out to the battle grounds of Rheims and saw the destructive work in that city. Rheims was a prosperous city before the war of about 25,000. It was right in the path of the Germans and was bombarded for four years. Only about 150 houses escaped and the Rheims Cathedral, everybody has heard about. … Our next town was Geneva, Switzerland. All the way from Lyons, France the scenery was simply fine. … Our next place was Montreux, a four hours sail on Lake Geneva. Here we visited Chauteau of Chillon, an old relic of the 1500 and 1600 century and heard how cruel those old time Lords of the country were. There are many beautiful hotels in Montreaux, some of them way up in the hills, where no teams could go, only tram railroads. Perhaps the most interesting place we have visited is at Zerwatt, 5000 feet above sea level. … We are at Brigue, to-night, and expect to go on from here to Interlaken, and the rest of Swiss scenery. … Regards to all the force and love for yourself. Arthur J. Smith.* * * * *Weldon Miller, of Waterbury, pleaded guilty to the charges of operating a motor vehicle without registration, reckless driving and evading responsibility before Justice P.H. McCarthy, Saturday afternoon, and was fined $50 on the charge of reckless driving, $25 for evading responsibility and $1 for improper registration. The total fines with the costs attached amounted to $96.37. Miller with J.B. Allen, of Waterbury, was taking a motor ride through Newtown on the night of August 2, when he collided with a car operated by Constable Joseph Collins, of Sandy Hook, near the residence of Martin Henry. The Collins machine was damaged. Miller was arrested by State Policeman Leo Carroll of the Ridgefield barracks and was brought to Newtown by Officer Merran C. Hill, of the state police force at Waterbury.* * * * *H.G. Warner, S. Ernest Sanford, and John C. Beers put in the day fishing, Wednesday, at Lake Waramaug.* * * * *The Tax Collector is making an effort to close up the personal tax account for the year. There are a few delinquents who it is hoped will pay up before he is compelled to take drastic action. It would be well for those in arrears to pay up before the sheriff calls.* * * * *Without doubt, A.E. Brinton stands to-day the most successful grower of dahlias in Fairfield county, if not in the state when quality of bloom is taken into consideration. It is a hobby with Mr Brinton, and he could make it his livelihood, should he choose to. The editor paid a visit to his dahlia garden, Wednesday night, and we might say, Mr Brinton welcomes visitors. He has perhaps 125 or more varieties, and the largest blooms we have ever seen, and we have followed the flower shows for years.August 25, 1899When we say what is the heading, “the best concert Newtown has had for years,” we say it advisedly; the only question with us is whether we ought to make any qualification at all as to time. We rather think the merits of the case would justify us in saying that the concert at the Newtown Inn last Saturday was the best Newtown has ever known. The wording of the announcements seemed extravagant in station that the Taglia Trio had reached the top notch in the musical line, and that Mrs Alma Webster Powell possessed one of the great voices of the century. … The entertainment itself showed that the words had been chosen with discrimination and care. Mrs Powell’s voice is one of the great voices of the century.* * * * *Operator Lewis of the Hawleyville station has rented a part of Mrs Starr Blackman’s house and will move his family to town at once.* * * * *A.G.

The first part of the time was spent under the trees on the church grounds but adjournment was soon made to the Parish room. The children made the time pass quickly with games and other pleasures to all. The gathering lasted from 2.30 to 5 o’clock.Do you have photographs of people or places in town from a bygone era?

According to a booklet published after the anniversary events, “The first musical unit to come down Main Street proved to be a treat for the hometown spectators, since it was [this group] performing on its home ground. The group was in top competitive form and earned enthusiastic applause from the sidelines. Both high-stepping Eilene Wright, the drum majorette, and Kathy Nakouse, the diminutive twirler, took the lead like seasoned troupers.” Two weeks earlier, the corps offered a 250th anniversary prelude when it held its first home meet at Newtown High School, with 30 corps participating in junior and senior contests. —Bee file photo way we were Story way we were way we were_228 Features, Way We Were None\n\nHorvath Family Home Devastated By Storm, Appreciates Community Support To Help Rebuild A GoFundMe campaign is giving the Horvath family hope in the aftermath of a severe storm that caused historic levels of rainfall and resulted in the family losing vehicles, countless belongings, and the ability to live in their South Main Street home.In the aftermath of a severe storm that caused historic levels of rainfall on Sunday, August 18, the Horvath family has lost vehicles, countless belongings, and the ability to live in their South Main Street home. One family member nearly lost his life trying to save important papers before they were washed away.Yet in the aftermath, family and friends immediately began helping them recover what they can. A GoFundMe campaign is giving the family hope for the future while being reminded that they have always helped others.Days after the storm, there were still some drawers in the kitchen that have water inside of them. The house has no electricity. Furniture and countless other miscellaneous items are sprawled all over the patio and backyard waiting to dry.Tom and Maria Horvath, as well as family and friends, are working to sort through all of the damage caused by the storm. According to Maria, everything happened so fast late Sunday afternoon.“The water was up to the driveway … and then I saw it go all the way up to the patio. And I was looking at the radar and they said there will be another two inches of rain, so I thought we should be okay,” Maria said Wednesday morning, walking through her damaged home with The Newtown Bee. “Then we got almost 13 inches of rain.”This is especially devastating to the Horvaths, who immigrated as political refugees from Hungary to the United States in the early 1980s with the hope of building a better life for their children. Since buying their Newtown house in 2002, they have been rebuilding and working on improving their home.When they were looking at the property they were told it had a knockdown house, and that they would have to knock it down and repair it. Maria says she and Tom had to “rip out everything to studs,” and that just about everything had to be rebuilt.“I always said, ‘This house is never going to be finished,’ because you need money for everything and it takes time. But we invested into our boys, and when we came to this country, we came for freedom … we came here to have a better life for them,” Maria said.On Sunday, that dream house they spent decades raising their children and making memories in flooded with around five feet of water.A few rooms, such as the family room and the entrance room, have their floors torn off to now reveal wooden paneling. Much of the furniture will have to be thrown away after being ruined by water. Maria said this week “pretty much whatever was below five feet, this all has to go.”Outside, Maria’s raspberry patch was destroyed. Tom, who was excited to pursue a lifelong passion and start collecting cars after retiring a few years ago, had several of his cars get totally submerged. Those cars, Maria says, will at the very least be able to be donated for parts.The Horvaths live at 220 South Main Street. The Pootatuck River runs to the west and south of their property. The Pootatuck overflowed on Sunday, and then flowed over the Horvath property, including a large outbuilding and their home.The main issue they faced, Public Works Director Fred Hurley said this week, was the destruction of the railroad bridge on the opposite side of South Main Street/Route 25. When that collapsed, the debris that fell into the river blocked up the culverts and caused the water level to rise ten feet higher than normal. This was in addition to all of the rainfall.Maria also recently spoke to Land Use Director Rob Sibley, who said that in addition to the destruction of the railroad bridge, the collapse of two nearby dams also contributed to the high water levels.It was in front of their home, in fact, on South Main Street near Bryan Lane, that many vehicles were also caught up by the swollen Pootatuck on Sunday. Multiple water rescues had to be done by local first responders after drivers and passengers found themselves in danger by the same water that destroyed the Tom and Maria’s home, and very nearly took one of their lives.Rescue From The BasementAs Maria watched the water swallow her backyard on Sunday, she called 911. She was initially told they could not do anything since there was so much flooding on the roads, and that they could only go out if it was life or death. She says that she called a second time after the water rose even higher, but got the same response.With the water still coming in, Tom wanted to go down into the basement and save important belongings such as birth certificates and passports. He told Maria to stay where she was because he knew he would have to go down and wade through about five feet of water in the backyard to get to the basement door.Despite also having to wade through water in the basement, Tom says he was able to save at least some of the things he wanted. The moment he started to head out of the basement, Tom says that he saw the door he’d gone through just a minute before open.“As soon as I looked at the door, I saw that the water from outside was a foot higher, coming and gushing in through the door because we kept that door locked,” Tom explained. “But then the striker gave, so it ripped through because there was too much pressure there.”After trying and failing to close the door, Tom realized he could not leave the way he came. He knew he would be unable to swim against the incoming wave of water. He said he then started moving in the opposite direction, trying to escape through the stairway or hatch exits.“I thought, ‘If I’m up here right now, I’ll be going down into even deeper water, but that’s the only way to the stairway or the hatch way,’” Tom said.Maria saw the wave of water rush in, and, realizing that Tom was trapped, called 911 one more time.“Thank God Botsford [Fire Rescue] was close by. They came out and a policeman was rushing in, and I waved him down … and showed him the basement door,” Maria said.By then, the water had risen even further. Three Botsford firefighters came in, and Maria says that they tried to figure out what to do because they could smell something concerning. When one of them asked Maria where her electrical outlet was, she told them it was underwater. That’s when she was told they could not go in to the basement.“So one firefighter — thank God for him, and I’m going to go visit them after things clear up and thank them because they saved his life — came up and said, ‘If you have a broom, I’m going to go down and try to find him,’” Maria said.Tom could hear yelling and tried to yell back, but figured no one could hear him since no one directly responded to him. He said “the last thing I wanted to do is to make sure the power was off. In the meantime, the lights went out, so I knew that we lost power, but I still wanted to shut off the breaker.”By the time he was in the lower part of the basement, the water levels were around six feet tall. He knew that, he said, because he is 5’9” tall and had to go on his tiptoes to get air. It eventually got to the point where he could not walk and he had to swim against floating items, like the fridge and freezer, that blocked his movement, he said.The basement ceiling had also collapsed while Tom was down there, so he had to navigate against insulation and other rubble.“Finally I reached the stairway about four-five feet, and the guys were already on the low steps there, pushing a broomstick towards me. And that’s what I grabbed,” Tom said. “They pulled me to the stairway and luckily made it out.”Tom says he probably had about another minute with the way it was rising before he reached the rafters and would have had to take air between them.What kept Maria’s hope alive then was her belief in her husband and his strength. She reminded herself of his military background in Hungary, and how he rode his motorcycle to Alaska and back on his own all because he wanted to do it one summer.“So I said, ‘I know he’s gonna make it,’ but when I saw that ten feet of water, I said, ‘Please God, give enough strength for him,’” Maria said.Maria says she was also concerned because Tom had fallen on some rocks while they were trying to build a stone wall, and lost his glasses and hearing aid. Tom did go to the ER later that night because his wrist was swollen. He had fractured his wrist and is now wearing a brace.Maria said she is “incredibly grateful” towards all first responders, from 911 operators to firefighters to police, for their immense support and empathy.“The firefighters, they are heroes. Botsford is really our heroes, and everybody who is in the fire department, because they could not be nicer. And the police department, too ... They were unbelievable, and I can’t thank them enough for saving his life,” Maria said. “And I could hear it in the 911 operators’ voices that they feel bad that there wasn’t anything they can do because of the weather.”Looking To RebuildAfter the devastation that came with the storm, Maria and Tom have not been alone in rebuilding their livelihood. All three of Tom and Maria’s boys — Dayton, Tarren, and Nathyn — immediately traveled to the home of their parents when they heard the news.Tarren said, “as soon as we got the pictures Sunday night, there was no question. At 5 am Monday morning, we were on our way up.”Dayton drove up with his fiancée Jen from Washington D.C., Tarren from northern Virginia, and Nathyn from Hamden. Now the boys are going through old childhood belongings like music sheets and old boxes they made in school. Maria says it broke her heart because she could feel how much the situation hurt them, too.“We were ready to have our grandkids and family here for a lot more years. And then when you look at the property, it’s just scary at the moment,” Maria said.Tarren’s wife Jessica Horvath set up a GoFundMe to help support the family after the devastating flood. These donations will go towards home repairs, replacing lost belongings such as furniture and appliances, and immediate needs like temporary food, clothing, and housing.Maria says that she was hesitant to have a GoFundMe at first because she didn’t want to beg for help or ask for things, and that she was brought up to not be selfish and to always try to help others.“And then one of my friends said, ‘This is the time to [receive] back, because you feed everyone and give everybody so much.’ … I appreciate everything. I appreciate all those years of being part of the community, with such wonderful people,” Maria said. “I just can’t thank people enough for helping us.”To support the Horvath family, donate to their GoFundMe, gofundme.com/f/help-the-horvath-family-rebuild-after-devastating-flooding.=====Reporter Jenna Visca can be reached at jenna@thebee.com.-1-1Tom and Maria Horvath stand outside their home on Wednesday, August 21 after it was devastated three days earlier by the severe storm that came through the region. The home that they have owned and been improving since they bought it in 2002 was flooded with several feet of water. As it stands now, their home has no electricity, they cannot use their kitchen, and their home is uninhabitable. —Bee Photos, Visca-1-1Countless belongings, from furniture to clothing, are sprawled outside on the backyard and patio of the Horvath home three days after the storm. Tom and Maria have slowly been sorting through everything with the support of family and friends in order to determine what can and cannot be saved. -1-1When the storm hit on Sunday, Tom was trapped in the basement after he tried to go down and retrieve important belongings such as birth certificates and passports. Just as he tried to leave, a wave of water came in and tore open the closed basement door. The water was so strong that it lifted both the fridge and the freezer in the basement and caused them to float, among many other items. The ceiling also collapsed while he was inside, causing insulation and rubble to fall.-1-1The damage from the large amount of water pressure from Sunday’s storm can be seen at the bottom right of the basement door, which a huge influx of water had forced open.35201980Many random items washed onto the Horvath's backyard because of the storm, including a few tires, a red oil barrel, and this large stack of wooden planks. Maria said that she had no clue where any of these items could have even come from. 35201980Water from the storm found its way into many drawers in the kitchen, including the one beneath the oven.40323024One of the bathrooms in the house had most of the tiles displaced from all of the water.40323024The washing machine was lifted up and moved around from the force of the water, and can still be seen lopsided days after the storm. The drawers at the left of this area in the hall were also still full of water.35201818Water was still encroached onto a part of the driveway days later, with it still partially submerging some of the cars.
