The movie, which is based the life of late White House butler Eugene Allen, who served under eight presidents, has topped the box office for the last two weeks. Speaking on “Tom Joyner Morning Show” in a radio interview broadcast Tuesday, the President shared how the film moved him. “I did tear up,” said Obama, explaining, “I teared up just thinking about not just the butlers who have worked here in the White House, but an entire generation of people who were talented and skilled, but because of Jim Crow (segregation laws), because of discrimination, there was only so far they could go.” Obama also praised the acting in the movie, which has garnered early Oscar buzz. “All of the acting was terrific, and I thought Forest Whitaker was wonderful,” he said. “And Oprah, my girl, she can act.” Of his own White House staff, the President says, “I will tell you that the butlers who are now here in the White House, when we first arrived, when Michelle and the girls just — first arrived, they could not have been kinder to us and warmer to us.” He continues, “And part of it, I suspect, is they look at Malia and Sasha and they say, well, this looks like my grandbaby, or this looks like my daughter.” “And I think for them to have a sense that we’ve come that far was a powerful moment for them, and certainly a powerful moment for us,” says Obama, adding, “We love them to death. They look after us just wonderfully.”\n\n影视\n\n2016-36/0813/en_head.json.gz/1628\n\nRosamund Pike to Star in David Fincher's 'Gone Girl' (Exclusive) Tatiana Siegel FACEBOOK The \"Jack Reacher\" actress will play the female lead opposite Ben Affleck in the adaptation of the hit novel, while Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry are being eyed for supporting roles. David Fincher has found his Girl. Rosamund Pike has been offered and is expected to accept the starring role opposite Ben Affleck in the 20th Century Fox mystery thriller Gone Girl, which is being co-financed 50-50 with New Regency, sources said. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry are being eyed for supporting roles. PHOTOS: 11 Biggest Book-to-Big Screen Adaptations of the Last 25 Years Pike will play a wife who goes missing on her fifth wedding anniversary, as her husband (Affleck) becomes the prime suspect. Much of the story is told in flashbacks. The British actress, who recently starred opposite Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher, landed the role that had Hollywood’s thirtysomething female set jockeying for the chance to work with Fincher. A number of actresses including Charlize Theron, Natalie Portman and Emily Blunt had been reported to be in the mix, but all were ruled out for various reasons including availability. Abbie Cornish and Olivia Wilde also had been considered. Reese Witherspoon, who optioned the book last summer, is producing alongside Bruna Papandrea and Leslie Dixon. PHOTOS: Gillian Flynn and Reese Witherspoon, Stephenie Meyer and 'The Host' Cast: Authors With Their Stars The film is set to go into production in September. Author Gillian Flynn adapted the screenplay from her novel, which became one of the biggest sellers of 2012. Pike recently shot the dramedy A Long Way Down opposite Aaron Paul. The busy actress' upcoming films also include Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin's What We Did on Our Holiday, Fouad Mikati's Return to Sender and Peter Chelsom's Hector and the Search for Happiness.

John*Wells who owns the rights to this one? I might like to see it JeffWld Warner Bros. acquired it in the Lorimar buyout. Jay_B! would be nice if they DVD'd this one to capitalize on Jason Bateman R. Kay Would be nice if they released 'Three's a Crowd' to capitalize on Jeffrey 'Hey Now' Tambor. I don't see why we won't see TAC after Three's Company winds up. Tambor was on TAC too? I know he was on The Ropers. John*P I'd buy all seasons of Valerie/The Hogan Family on DVD for sure. Its one of the most underrated of 80s sitcoms, IMO. I agree that now would be a good time to release it, what with Jason Bateman back on the scene and all. Check out:The Hogan Family Online (watch the opening theme videos for a nostalgia rush) Amy Mormino It would probably have been better for this title if an independent company (like Anchor Bay or Shout!) had been able to acquire it than Warners. There have been so few 80s family sitcoms released (especially past the first season) that the odds of V/VF/HF being released are not great. ChrisCook Now with \"Family Ties\" finally coming to DVD, I wonder how close are we of seeing Warner Bros. release this? It just recently, once again, was pulled off ABC Family's schedule. I hope Warner Bros. is reading this, as I really would like to see this come to DVD. And if they're reading this particular thread, please restore the full, uncut opening and closing credits (with the correct title cards for their respective seasons) to Valerie/Valerie's Family/The Hogan Family, and that the episodes are uncut (as well as the music intact). Bonus material would be nice. Roger_S This series was being aired recently on ABC Family Channel but I hear they're pulling it, even though it's only been airing at 8am. There's a chance they could air it again at some point. Yes, they were airing \"Valerie's Family\" (and they were almost done with Season 3) when they pulled it this week. This is the second time they've pulled it (and at the same point in the series too). Considering that this show is another acquisition property, hoping for correct restoration doesn't look good after the \"Mama's Family\" fiasco. It's a situation ripe for Warner to sing the \"we didn't know they were cut\" song again. Of course this could be an opportunity for Lion's Gate to jump on board with this Lorimar production (a la \"ALF\") and release the syndication versions...all the while telling you that the 6th generation syndication versions are better quality than the uncut master tapes. ABC Family has pulled this show twice so far after airing it in 2 different time slots. That doesn't bode well at all. As much as I liked this show (and all it's incarnations) I have to say that it hasn't aged that well. Skimpy plots, strained jokes. But Edie McClurg is always a hoot ! Turning the Beat Around at Our Cool New Pad Retro Remixes I have very fond memories of this show through all incarnations but I haven't seen it in many years. I'll consider buying this series when it finally gets released on DVD, I'm just not sure I will still enjoy it. No, he wasn't on Three's a Crowd. What reason would there be to have Jeffrey Tambor (who played Stanley & Helen's stuffy next door neighbor on \"The Ropers\") on both spinoffs from Three's Company? 15 of 21 Ethan Riley Tambor guest-starred on several memorable episodes of Three's Company, in various roles. As for Hogan's...I dunno...I watched an episode a few weeks ago and didn't think much of it. I do remember it was one of my favorites when Valerie Harper was still on. It's just one of those shows like \"Full House,\" \"What's Happening\" or \"Family Ties\" where it's popular in its own time, but doesn't seem to exist well outside of its time. The only shows that hold up over time have some kind of a classic feel to them--some hook that makes you remember the show fondly--not just the show's premise as a whole, but distinct episodes. Lots of sitcoms don't age so well, or seem corny or out of date not long after their airings, and I think it happens when all the episodes are too similar; when the plots are too light. Take for example, \"One Day at a Time...\" does anybody really remember a single plot from that show, other than the fact that they were always standing around the living room? I sure don't, and yet I saw almost the entire run of the show. Same with \"Alice\"...there were no plots, all they did was sit around the diner and swap wisecracks. It's not like with \"The Brady Bunch\" when you go, \"oh yeah, I remember the episode where Jan wouldn't wear her glasses, or the episode where Greg became a pop star, or the episode where Peter saved the girl at the toy shop.\" That's just the way \"classic\" tv shows work--where you can later recall different episodes, not just the series as a whole. And I think that's what, unfortunately, \"Hogan's\" suffers from--too much sameness. I don't even remember the episode where Valerie died; they didn't make too much of it, if I recall; she died off-camera and she'd been in the ground for months before the new season started. I think this is what's keeping most of the 80s family sitcoms from dvd so far. Since Warner told me tonight that they will continue to evaluate this, I just wanted to add that not only is this a childhood favorite (and an unreleased \"holy grail\" for me), but Valerie/Valerie's Family/The Hogan Family holds a very special place in my heart. To see it again as it was originally broadcast, you don't know how happy this would make me Warner. younger1968 I was watching youtube the other night and the episode where Jason Batemen''s character on The Hogan Family had to deal with aids and his buddy Rich. That is one of the classic episode to touch on AIDS. I just hope this show is released on dvd. I have been collecting Mr Belvedere, Growing Pains, Family Ties and Silver Spoons and like the family sitcoms. TV today just does not reinforce the family values like the 1960-1980s accomplished. i still hope they release this show, it was one of the better family sitcoms. I would rank it up there with the Cosby Show, Family Ties and Growing Pains. TV today does not really have any family sitcoms and we wonder why there are issues with the core family values now. LizH I thought it was OK (Nothing terribly special about it, though.) Originally Posted by Ethan Riley ) Oracle Heaven The good thing about these forums there is no right or wrong, but, opinion. Yes, the shows were good at the time, because they tough issues and some of them may or may not be relevant today. However, these shows emphasize family values and how you can jungle careers and family. If you look at the fabric of families today is significantly different because the computer and video games have become keys in the household. The internet has brought information in realtime, when in the past it was morning or evening news.\n\n影视\n\n2016-36/0813/en_head.json.gz/1682\n\nWomen that Inspire Me by CaitTheRaggDoll created 20 Mar 2011 | last updated - 20 Mar 2011 Actress, Irreversible Monica Anna Maria Bellucci was born on September 30, 1964 in the Italian village of Città di Castello, Umbria, the only child of Brunella Briganti and Pasquale Bellucci.

Receiving the American Riviera Award — given to an American actor whose work has made an indelible mark in cinema — Bullock arrived solo and spent the next half-hour-plus graciously answering questions and posing for photographs on the red carpet. As a result, the 8 p.m. start time was pushed back significantly, but the audience didn’t seem to mind the delay. After a brief intro by SBIFF Board of Directors President Jeffrey Barbakow and a turn at the podium for mega sponsor Chopin vodka’s CEO, Bullock was invited onstage by the evening’s moderator, film critic Pete Hammond. SBIFF 2010 Sandra Bullock View thumbnails Looking gorgeous in a form-fitting black dress and sky-high heels, Bullock spent the next two-plus hours endearing the audience to her with her funny, self-effacing comments, openness, and sincerity. Hammond guided us through the expanse of Bullock’s life and career. Raised by two working opera singers, Bullock spoke of being on stage at an early age as “the dirty gypsy child” in her mother’s productions. This experience, she said, taught her a valuable lesson about the business. During one opera performance, the young Bullock was carrying out her “gypsy” role by collecting money that was supposedly being thrown onto the stage. Rather than remaining in the shadows, however, she trotted in front of the tenor, thus breaking a sacred rule of performance—don’t upstage the star. She’s never forgotten that, she said. Sandra Bullock with Forest Whitaker, who presented the Riviera award Throughout the evening, montages from Bullock’s films throughout her career were shown. It was interesting—and her comments often hilarious—to get the inside scoop on each film. “This is painful to watch,” she said after clips from A Time to Kill and While You Were Sleeping. While she delighted in the movies themselves, she said she could only see what she could have done differently (i.e., better) with her role. She spoke candidly about the poor decision-making involved in accepting the lead role in Speed 2. (“Obviously Keanu knew something that I didn’t,” she laughed.) In good humor she joked about asking, “When do we get a script?” not realizing, she said, “Apparently you don’t need one in an action film.” Still, Bullock has no regrets, claiming that she learned invaluable lessons from Speed 2 as well as the other flops she’s made. (Who’s seen Fire on the Amazon?) The evening closed with snippets from Bullock’s 2009 hit films The Proposal and The Blind Side. She did mention with sarcasm that she was surprised her other 2009 film, All About Steve — which was panned by audiences and critics alike — hasn’t been nominated for anything except a Razzie. “It’s a film before it’s time,” she said, laughing, and expects it to achieve cult status á la The Wizard of Oz or Rocky Horror Picture Show in 10 years. Regarding this year of serious award nominations she confessed, “This has been a big year and in a way I haven’t processed it yet.” Actor/director Forrest Whitaker then took the stage to present his friend with her award — he was her director in the 1998 film Hope Floats and she presented him an award at the festival a couple years ago — and gave a poetic speech about Bullock’s grace and depth to a rapt audience. Sandra Bullock Comes to SBIFF What’s Up With Film Fest Sandra Bullock SBIFF Peeps Creepy Feelings Forrest Whitaker was absolutely lovely. He kept stepping out of the lime light. Ushering himself very demurely around her with his hand always guiding the press back to Sandy while she slowly wound her way up the Red Carpet. His speech was the stuff of poetic legend. Describing her as a dancer...a perfect partner...a perfect follow...\"landing gracefully into every performance.\" He was loving,gentle and kind. She held back the tears...but a few slipped through. Forrest expressed the dedication and support that one saves only for the dearest in their lives. It was a wonderful speech and the wonder was amplified by Forrest's engaging ability as an orator. Lovely and amazing. All eyes were on her and he made sure of it. emenzies (Elizabeth Menzies)February 6, 2010 at 6:01 p.m. (Suggest removal)\n\n影视\n\n2016-36/0813/en_head.json.gz/1701\n\nMemento - Special Edition DVD (15) Review: Jack Foley DVD SPECIAL FEATURES: Disc One: Commentary with 3 alternative endings (109 minutes). Disc Two: Interview with Christopher Nolan (24 mins). Interview with Guy Pearce (13 mins). Anatomy of a Scene (26 mins). Biographies. Reverse version of feature Easter egg. Disc Three: Shooting Script split screen (109 mins). Memento Mori (34 mins). Galleries. Website. International trailer. IT SEEMS ironic that a film about someone's battle against memory loss should be so memorable, but the fact remains that Memento is the type of movie you will remember long after the final reel. As clever as The Usual Suspects and as intricate after the event as The Sixth Sense, Memento, directed by Brit Christopher Nolan, should not be missed by anyone who enjoys challenging movie-making which dares to be different. Guy (LA Confidential) Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, a former insurance investigator, now searching for the man who raped and killed his wife. Only trouble is, he suffers from short term memory loss and cannot create new memories, an affliction caused by the head injury he sustained while trying to prevent the men from murdering his beloved. Leonard can remember his life before the attack but anything since then is impossible to hold on to for longer than 15 minutes. As such, he can often forget where he is, what he is doing and who he is with. But driven by instinct and rage, Leonard is determined to uncover the truth and pieces together the facts using polaroids (for the people and places he needs to remember) and tattoos on his body (for the facts). Helping him is Joe Pantoliano's dubious Teddy, a man who may or may not be his friend, and Carrie-Anne Moss's Natalie, an equally untrustworthy bartender who may be using Leonard to solve her own problems. To complicate matters still further, Nolan's film is told backwards, so that the start is the end and matters unfold from there. So anyone expecting an easy couple of hours is best advised to steer clear, for this is demanding, even exhausting cinema which requires every ounce of attention just to keep up. That isn't to say the film is impossible to follow, merely it requires attention, but it is constructed in such a way that it never fails to command your attention. Interspersed with the main story is a vignette concerning Leonard's former life, about a case he investigated involving a man with a similar affliction, which is worth paying attention to for the answers it may hold. The proceedings also benefit from a great deal of humour (most of it dark), some well executed set pieces, and some blistering turns from all involved. Pearce, in particular, stands out as Leonard, a man clinging on to a former life in a bid to do the right thing. His frustrations, his anxieties and his utter confusion are brilliantly conveyed in a performance of quiet intensity, never more so than when he discusses the nature of memory. But Pantoliano and Moss (who last starred together in The Matrix) are no less impressive, revelling in shady roles which may hold vital pieces to the puzzle. Nolan's screenplay is equally breathtaking, providing viewers with some thought-provoking material before allowing them to see the complete picture via a well concealed twist ending. The path to the truth may, at times, be mentally fatiguing but the payoff is more than worth it. I can guarantee, you will be talking about it for days. Review Archive\n\n影视\n\n2016-36/0813/en_head.json.gz/1721\n\nThe actor has been busy since Bridesmaids, and it’s made him eager to return to his roots as an actor and Roscommoner. From the beginning of our conversation, Chris O’Dowd is enthusiastic. I only have my first two words out before he says, “Yes!” My first two words, “Moone Boy,” are the title of O’Dowd’s autobiographical coming-of-age comedy that is back for a second season after a near two-year hiatus and O’Dowd is rightfully exclamatory. As he will explain in a few seconds, the second episode of the second season aired hours before in Ireland and the U.K. and he’s on Twitter checking the reaction. It’s good.Immensely personal and culturally aware, “Moone Boy” may be O’Dowd’s favorite project right now because it connects him to his childhood home. In fact, many of the scenes are filmed in places he knew as an adolescent, and most of the storylines are drawn straight from his own experience growing up in Boyle, Co. Roscommon. It is of course embellished with sharp one-liners and O’Dowd, now 34, playing the imaginary friend to Martin Moone, the fictionalized version of his 12-year-old self, which he claims he never had. But “Moone Boy” is only the beginning of our conversation and O’Dowd’s burgeoning career. This year alone, he has four films making their U.S. premiers: The Double, an adaptation of a Dostoyevsky novella directed by Richard Ayoade, a former co-star in the U.K. hit sitcom “The IT Crowd” where O’Dowd had his first major break; St. Vincent de Van Nuys, a dark comedy in which he stars along with Bill Murray; Cuban Fury, which sees him partnered with both Rashida Jones (“Parks and Rec”) and Nick Frost (Shawn of the Dead, The World’s End) and promises a parking lot dance-off; and Calvary, the second feature by John Michael McDonagh (The Guard) and also starring Brendan Gleeson. Not only is O’Dowd appearing in these films, but beginning March 19, he will be on Broadway for a limited-engagement revival of John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men as Lennie, a large but simple-minded migrant worker, opposite James Franco who plays George, Lennie’s short-tempered companion.Since his appearance in Bridesmaids in 2011 as the handsome and huggable Officer Rhodes who falls for Kristen Wiig, O’Dowd has been in demand. Mostly, he takes this in stride, but recognizes the impulse to read too much into his characters as a reflection of himself. The roles he’s taken since his catapult to American fame three years ago have been mostly comedic, if bordering on melancholy. In 2012’s Friends with Kids he portrays with biting realism a husband trying to find the balance between reconnecting with his wife and enjoying alone time after the births of their children. And his performance as a washed-out cruise ship entertainer-turned-aboriginal soul-group band manager in the Australian film The Sapphires allowed him to demonstrate the full emotional range of a man struggling with his own mediocrity, using comedy as a crutch (a very funny crutch), and envisioning greater responsibility for himself.But although he’s a funny man on screen, O’Dowd is deadly serious about his craft and the work that goes into it. In our conversation below, he talks about the genesis for “Moone Boy,” the importance of women in comedy, his ideal schedule, and why he stopped playing Gaelic football (which he’s only possibly joking about).What made you want to go back to that time in your life when “Moone Boy” is set, or that period of transition in Ireland, the late 80s and early 90s, when you started the show a few years ago?It was just after Bridesmaids came out and I felt like I needed to go back and do something that reconnected with home so that it didn’t get washed away in the madness.And you studied politics and sociology at UCD.I did!Did that education influence the writing at all for “Moone Boy”? It’s a show about individual characters surely, but they’re often banded together or separated by their reactions to the political and cultural events at the time.I guess so; I don’t know! I don’t know if there’s much influence from the politics side, but I am very interested in politics, and I did do an episode in the first season with the first female president being elected. And sociologically, I guess at that time in Ireland the biggest change I think is the nature of women’s roles politically and socially. I like the idea that the show has very strong female characters in it. Even though the main characters are male, the female characters are strong, independent women. So that I guess would be the only part of it.And that comes from your own childhood growing up with your sisters and your family dynamic.Yes, obviously it’s a very similar makeup in my family. My dad did the same thing as the dad in the show, my mum did the same thing, I had three sisters, so it is pretty autobiographical.There’s a scene in the first season where Martin becomes an altar boy because they’re the cool kids at Mass, but then it turns out they’re actually involved in some light embezzlement, shall we say. Were you similarly part of an altar boy mafia?[Laughs] I was an altar boy. And it did have kind of a cult-like quality to it. Because I think at that age it’s almost like your own language that you develop amongst your friends as a way to disassociate with the rest of the world. So I’m sure there was a lot of that and I’m sure that’s probably where that idea came from.Is this the story you’d be telling if you had unlimited resources?That’s a good question. I mean, I think we’re lucky in that we’re fairly well supported. TV’s tough to make at any stage, particularly back in Ireland because it’s expensive. But it’s the show I like doing above all else. It’s my favorite job, writing and directing the show.I saw in an interview you gave elsewhere you said you turned down a few projects to work on this show. Is this something you think you’re going to transition into more, the writing, producing, and directing side of entertainment?I’d definitely like to get behind the camera more as time goes on. I love acting, but I’m not particularly a fan of being famous. So I love the idea of being able to do acting in theater, and then maybe write and direct TV and movies. That would be a perfect world for me if I have the opportunity.Speaking of theater, you’re coming up in Of Mice and Men. Which is a pretty big departure from your previous work. First, it’s on stage. And it’s a dramatic role; you’re Lennie. How did that come about?Honestly, I just got the call asking if I’d be interested. And I said I very much would. And I got really excited about it and then it just went away. And then like three months later they said, “It’s happening. Like, soon.” So I jumped on board. There was no thinking time needed by me, I just love the play, and the opportunity to do something on Broadway was just something I’d been looking for anyway.You’ve got kind of big shoes to fill. James Earl Jones was the last one to play Lennie on Broadway. Are you nervous?I know! I am absolutely shitting it, yea. But I’m trying to keep it together. We’re just in Chicago at the moment. We’ve just done our first week of rehearsals. We come to New York next week, and it’s going to be terrifying. But yea, I’m really enjoying it. And it’s an equal measure excitement and hand-wetting right now, and I’m interested to see how that equilibrium balances out or takes over in the coming weeks.Can you tell us a little bit about your preparation for the role?You know, I don’t really know. I tried to find out exactly what to learn. And in many ways it’s kind of hard. There’s a lot of different thinking, a lot of people have different thoughts on it. But he is essentially a guy who is cognitively disabled so I’ve been watching all sorts of stuff and trying to nail down the physicality of it and the vocals. And also he is essentially kind of like a big baby; he’s constantly referred to as a bear and a baby, and I guess I’m just trying to measure all of that together and try not to over-think it.It seems like there’s a lot of pressure for comedic actors to transition to more dramatic roles once they’ve established themselves in the public eye as comedians. Were you conscious of that when you chose to take on the role of Lennie?You know not really. I do sometimes feel pressure to do dramas, but then I’ll read the drama in question and just have no interest in it. I think there’s such kind of mediocre dramas being bandied about, but I found it hard to get excited about it. But this piece of work is so beautiful that it was a no-brainer. But I do find it odd that in nearly every interview I would do I would get asked when am I going to do some dramatic acting. And I think comedic acting is very, very difficult, which is why so few people can do it well. And I doubt very much whether dramatic actors get asked when they are going to do comedic acting.Why do you think that is?Snobbery.That dramatic roles win the awards?I guess so. I don’t even know what that’s about. You know, it’s like who can cry the best. I don’t know, like. Sometimes it’s great. And comedy in a lot of ways is a lot more difficult because in many ways it’s less open to interpretation. Something is either funny or it’s not; if people aren’t laughing, guess what, it wasn’t good. It’s as simple as that. Whereas I think dramas can get away with a lot because the shot looks nice.Do you think in the films you’re doing you’re beginning to be perceived as being type cast? Or you’re being cast for a very specific supporting reason?Not really, considering what I’m doing right now, no. Definitely people think of you in certain ways and that’s absolutely fine, but the roles I’ve got coming up they’re all very different, so it hasn’t really been my experience. I’m often drawn to similar things, but no, I feel like I’ve been given plenty of opportunities to do other stuff. You know you have to be careful not to do the same thing over and over again. Right after Bridesmaids and all that, I tried to avoid doing another romcom, and then tried to avoid another kind of sitcom like “The IT Crowd.” You know, try to get behind the camera and then go on stage. You have to actively diverge from what you’ve done before; it won’t just happen.After The Sapphires came out, Jack Coyle at The Huffington Post compared you to Bill Murray, in the 70s for enlivening the film “with your winning charisma.” And I wondered how you felt about that comparison. I read that Murray is one of your icons of comedy and that you just worked with him this last summer on St. Vincent de Van Nuys.Wow. I’ll take that! Yea he is, he’s one of my heroes. And I did. I briefly worked with him this summer and he was just the most charming and lovely man. So that just solidified him in my books as a cool dude. It’s a lovely comparison, of course I’ll take that all day, but I don’t know necessarily if it’s true. I’ve got a long, long way to go yet.Who are some of your other inspirations for acting and how did you get started in the industry?In terms of other people that I really enjoy watching, one of my heroes would be John C. Reilly. I feel like I could just watch him do anything. Philip Seymour Hoffman was a big hero of mine. Those guys were pretty great, and then you know someone like Will Ferrell who’s so consistently funny.I went to university and while I was studying I joined the drama society and started doing plays there. Essentially, I stopped being part of the “yearly facility,” as it were, [and only] did maybe two or three plays there a month. It was a great way to just get used to it. You did dozens of plays and they’re not necessarily the greatest quality, but you really get so much stage time and you get your confidence. Then I went to drama school in London. I went to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts and that was more of a traditional, almost like Shakespearian teaching. And I guess I thought of myself as a dramatic actor then, so the fact that I went into comedy was a surprise. I had three or four jobs that were dramatic and I just didn’t see comedy as a realistic thing that I could achieve or an option. But I’m glad that it was. What was the catalyst for the shift from perceiving yourself as a dramatic actor to a comedian?I played a comedian in a film called Festival. And it was a comedy but it was a relatively dramatic role; there was a lot going on. He was an alcoholic comedian who wins an award at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival and I ended up winning a BAFTA in Scotland for it and then I got a lot more comedy roles from that. “The IT Crowd” came from that, and sitcom is the purest kind of comedy you can do. It’s such a set-up-and-joke scenario. There’s no room for interpretation – what you’re doing is trying to make people laugh. That’s the raison d’ être of the sitcom and I love that in it’s own way because it’s its own little art form. From then on it was a lot more comedy I would get offered, and once I got into the mechanics of how comedy worked I was fascinated by it. And then I got to work with Judd [Apatow] (This Is 40), Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids), Lena Dunham (“Girls”), and all of those people over the last two years, which has been great.What’s it like coming from a traditional acting school and going to people like Lena Dunham and Judd Apatow and Christopher Guest who really encourage improvisation? Especially for something like Guest’s “Family Tree” where the dialogue is completely improvised. Was that new to you, or did improv come naturally?I guess it did to an extent. I hadn’t done improv on stage or anything before. I’d always done a little bit of it in some work I’d done, but not to the extent that we did in “Family Tree.” And that is quite a scary experience. But working with Lena and Judd, their scripts are already really strong so there’s definitely room to improv and those guys are so open to it, but there isn’t a huge need to do it, so the pressure isn’t as much, so you only do it if you feel like you’re going to add something to it. It’s a great scenario to do improv when it’s not totally necessary, where you’re hoping that you’ll add something to it but you’re not getting in the way. You often do it at the end of scenes and stuff so people can cut it out if it’s shit.My last question for you: You played Gaelic football. Can you tell us a little about the athlete Chris O’Dowd?Oh wow [laughs] yea! It’s a great sport and I still follow it. I played minor for Roscommon, actually all the ages – under 14, 16, 18, 21. And then I played in the Connaught finals and all that kind of stuff and, er, I guess I stopped playing once I really started enjoying Jamesons.“Moone Boy” premiers April 24 in the U.S. on Hulu.

The feature covers a wide range of topics relating to the film – including how plans Boal and Bigelow had to make a film about the failed attempt to capture bin Laden at Tora Bora fell apart in the aftermath of his death in 2011. While some filmmakers would have been crushed by the news that their project (one they’d been working for years) was now irrelevant, Bigelow and Boal simply shifted gears and found a better story in the process. The piece goes in depth in regards to how they made the transition – and Bigelow’s fanatical devotion to realism. That realism wasn’t lost on her cast, either. Actor Jason Clarke plays a U.S. agent in the early stages of the film – and one scene calls for him to interrogate a prisoner using the controversial method of waterboarding. Clarke subjected himself to a real-life waterboarding to gain insight into what was going on. Website Showbiz 411 reports that the actor told fellow star Jessica Chastain that he tried it out “and I can tell you, it’s not something you ever want to do. But I wanted to understand the experience.” That’s some pretty crazy method acting. Would you be willing to endure these kinds of things for a role? How excited are you to see Zero Dark Thirty?

Emily Elegado and Aaron �Is� Michalowski are rivals on the upcoming fifth season of �Ink Masters.� Goose Creek resident Emily Elegado has been �on vacation� for much of the summer ... She did not announce where exactly she was going, however, and simply told friends she would be back home around August.Elegado�s actual reason for leaving was to shoot the upcoming season of �Ink Master� in New York.Elegado was one of 18 contestants vying for a $100,000 cash prize, an editorial feature in �Inked� magazine and the bragging rights title of �Ink Master.� The show, now in its fifth season, airs on Spike TV. The upcoming season starts Sept. 2 at 10 p.m.The format of the show is like �Top Chef,� except for some of the country�s top and up and coming tattoo artists. However, season five of �Ink Master� comes with a twist: each contestant is coming into the competition with a personal tattoo rival.For Elegado, that rival is Aaron �Is� Michalowski, a tattoo artist from Tampa, Fla. He did guest spots at a tattoo shop she worked at in Panama City, Fla.�He always just kind of rubbed me the wrong way, and I didn�t really appreciate the way he treated the industry,� Elegado said. �He kind of made a joke out of a lot of things.�In April Elegado received a phone call from the producers of �Ink Master,� who said Michalowski had called her out as a rival of his, and the producers asked if she would be up for the challenge on the show.�I consider myself a very talented tattoo artist, so I was very willing to prove that on a national competition,� she said.Elegado has been a tattoo artist for six years. She works as a tattoo artist at Roses & Ruins Tattoo in Summerville, where she has been for 18 months. She previously worked at a tattoo shop in Charleston, and before that she was in Florida.Because the show hasn�t aired, Elegado is not allowed to reveal too much about the competition, but said the experience was intense.�No doubt about it � the most stress, the most insanity,� she said. �It was 18 people including myself living in a two-bedroom loft with two and a half bathrooms. We all had beds and everything but it was like living in a hostel, for sure.�On the show contestants go head-to-head with their rivals, but the goal is to be the last tattoo artist standing so all the contestants are essentially pitted against each other � thus there is a lot of fighting.�Competition makes you crazy,� Elegado said. �I�m a very nice person, I think you can ask anybody; I�m very easy to get along with, but when it comes down to $100,000 I can fight like an angry bear, and I fought as hard as I could on that competition, and I think people are going to definitely see that.�Contestants participated in challenges that tested the artists� technical skills as well as their creativity. They faced a panel of judges that consisted of Dave Navarro from �Jane�s Addiction,� tattoo artist Chris Nunez from �Miami Ink� and tattoo artist Oliver Peck from Elm Street Tattoo in Dallas, TX.All Elegado has seen of the footage is what has been posted online.�I look pretty mean,� she said with a laugh. �There weren�t a whole lot of friendships to be made � that�s not what I was there for, I was there to win a competition. I went in there, guns blazing, ready to rattle.�I guess when you get into people�s faces and tell them things they are not used to hearing you don�t make a whole lot of friends. No one was really safe.�A contestant will be eliminated on every episode. There are a total of 16 episodes including the live finale that takes place in December.�I was fighting for my career, for $100 grand that I could probably use,� she said.Regardless of the outcome Elegado feels she grew from the experience. Looking back, if Elegado had a chance she would do the show all over again.�I definitely learned a lot about tattooing,� she said. �Tattooing is one of those industries where if you don�t learn something new every day, you�re not putting the effort into it that you should be.�I learned a lot about people, and who you can trust and who you can�t,� she said. �I learned a lot about what I was capable of as a person � because, five years ago, I never would have thought I would be able to go through that stressful of a situation. It definitely made me grow as a person.�Elegado sports a lot of tattoos, including a sleeve on her left arm and more art on her right arm, neck, feet and knuckles.�When I first started tattooing I was really excited that I could turn people into walking private museums of my work,� she said. �The further I get in my career, it�s more making people happy. So many people come in with heartache stories or tattoos that they absolutely hate and want gone. Being able to cover something, or to memorialize something, or just to make someone feel good about themselves � that�s way more rewarding than people knowing I�m a tattoo artist.� Latest Videos\n\n影视\n\n2016-36/0813/en_head.json.gz/2198\n\nBob Hoskins, Veteran Actor Who Starred in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Dies at 71 Terry O'Neill/Getty British actor Bob Hoskins, whose varied career ranged from Mona Lisa to Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, has died at the age of 71.

Since first battling Patrick Troughton in 1967, the Warriors have appeared in six serials but haven’t been seen since 1974’s The Monster of Peladon. But now, after almost 40 years, Doctor Who’s executive producer Caro Skinner has revealed that they’ll be making their comeback in a new story set inside a submarine. “We've got the most fantastic episode by Mark Gatiss where we are bringing back the Ice Warriors on a submarine,\" she told SFX. \"We wanted to bring them back because they're wonderful. In the mix of stories that we were planning for this year it felt as if doing something very bold with a monster that hadn't been seen for a while would be really cool. \"Mark is an enormous fan of the Ice Warrior stories and came up with the idea. The sense of a monster of that scale and that size trapped in a really small, contained environment such as a submarine was a really brilliant story to be able to tell. \"They were such a beautiful original design, and are genuinely really scary in terms of what they look like as they're coming towards you in that armour.\" The Ice Warriors will make their comeback in the third episode of the new series of Doctor Who after the show returns to TV on Saturday 30 March. Unlike the Daleks or Cybermen, the Martian Ice Warriors haven’t always been villains in Doctor Who and were featured as neutral characters in the two 1970s Jon Pertwee serials The Curse of Peladon and The Monster of Peladon.

No pain for \"Hurt Locker,\" Bigelow HOLLYWOOD — \"The Hurt Locker,\" a film that was made with little cash but limitless willpower, defeated the highest-grossing film in history and won the best picture Oscar here Sunday night. The director of the spine-chilling war drama, Kathryn Bigelow, became the first woman to ever win the best director Oscar. James Cameron, director of \"Avatar\" — and her former husband — cried all the way to the bank. In what was expected to be a close race, \"The Hurt Locker\" took an early 4-3 lead and then pounded home with the best director and picture Oscars for a total of six. Its best film editing award correctly predicted the best picture winner, as it historically does. The three wins for \"Avatar\" came in the technical categories, as expected, including cinematography — not expected, since so much of the film was created inside computers. The final totals included two apiece for \"Precious,\" \"Crazy Heart\" and \"Up.\" In presenting the historic award to Bigelow, actress Barbra Streisand, never Oscar-nominated for direction herself, said, \"Well, the time has come,\" after opening the envelope. Bigelow did it, I believe, because she quite simply made the best film: The tension generated by the film was extraordinary. Yes, situations involving defusing bombs are common enough, but somehow Bigelow made the bomb scenes human, not technical. Perhaps that was the woman in her? Bigelow thanked writer Mark Boal \"for risking his life\" in researching the script. Only 29 when she started, Bigelow has been a masterful action director from the get-go, with \"The Loveless,\" \"Near Dark,\" \"Blue Steel\" and \"Point Break\" between 1982 and 1991. Ever since, her career has been a triumph over preconceptions. Sandra Bullock, an A-list star recently found in B-list roles, won the best actress Oscar for \"The Blind Side.\" She teared up in thanking her late mother \"for not letting me ride in cars with boys until I was 18 because she was right. I would've done what she said I was gonna do.\" It was a busy weekend for Bullock, who Saturday night accepted the Razzie Award as the year's worst actress for \"All About Steve.\" Jeff Bridges raised a yell from the audience when he won as best actor for \"Crazy Heart.\" Thirty-eight years ago, he was nominated for his first major feature role for \"The Last Picture Show\" (1972). Sunday night, he collected on the fifth. He saluted to his parents, especially father Lloyd, \"who taught me the basics of acting. Thank you, Mom and Dad, for turning me on to such a groovy profession.\" The movie came out of nowhere in December to pick up all the major critics groups' awards and then steamrolled over early favorite George Clooney (\"Up in the Air\") to win. Somehow this was the time for Bridges, once described in a New York Times cover story as \"the best unknown star in Hollywood.\" A mighty roar went up when Mo'Nique was named best supporting actress. She played the crude, abusive mother in \"Precious.\" She thanked the academy for proving \"it can be about the performance and not about the politics.\" And she also thanked Hattie McDaniel, the first black Oscar winner (for \"Gone With the Wind\"), \"for enduring all she had to, so that I would not have to.\" At that time, the Oscars were announced at an academy dinner, and McDaniel was required to sit at a table by herself. Mo'Nique's win was almost universally expected, but popular because this was her first major role and she stunned audiences with her power. Portrayed throughout as a vile monster, she has a monologue in which she haltingly explains herself, and we realize we are looking at a victim of exactly the abuse she was passing on to her daughter. Christoph Waltz was gobsmacked when he won best actor at Cannes in May 2009, and he was still astonished here when he won the supporting actor Oscar. It is his performance, more than any other, that distinguishes Quentin Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds,\" and in effect, he's the leading man. \"Quentin with his unorthodox methods of navigation, this fearless explorer, took this ship across and brought it in with flying colors, and that's why I'm here,\" Waltz said. \"This is your welcoming embrace, and there's no way I can ever thank you enough.\" \"The Hurt Locker\" began its successful evening with its Oscar for Boal's original script. Its construction was indeed original, depending as much on external suspense as on our tension about what the hero, the bomb disposal expert James, was capable of. The adapted script Oscar went to Geoffrey Fletcher for \"Precious,\" in an upset, since Jason Reitman's \"Up in the Air\" was thought to be the front runner. In a highly emotional speech, Fletcher dedicated the Oscar, as the film was also dedicated, to \"precious girls and boys everywhere.\" \"Up,\" a film so good it was also nominated for best picture, won for best animated film. Director Pete Docter of Pixar spread the credit in his acceptance speech, but he led the charge to change perceptions of animated films, and \"Up\" transcended categories to reach adults without kids as escorts. \"The Cove,\" produced by actor and Chicago native Fisher Stevens, won the best documentary Oscar. A thriller in the documentary format, it was about a dangerous attempt to film Japanese fishermen as they lured, entrapped and murdered dolphins. From their opening monologue, co-hosts Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin were surprisingly unfunny. Their opening lines would have been funny delivered by one emcee, but having them do alternate reads from the prompter was a mistake. Nor did either one seem to really be speaking in the first person. One major drawback of having 10 BP nominees is that 10 film intros robbed us of five best song performances. There was an impressive live-and-film tribute to musical scores, on the big silver Art Deco stage of the Kodak Theatre. Director John Hughes was too great a legend to be simply included in the traditional \"In Memoriam\" tribute. The special clip package of his work stirred desires to see his films again. They seemed good at the time, and in these dreary days, they seem miraculous. As the stars he made — his \"children\" —strode forward, it became one of the greatest moments in Academy Award history. The traditional memorial montage was well accompanied by pop-music veteran James Taylor. Every year they forget someone. This year it was a very big someone: Farrah Fawcett. \"Crazy Heart\" won for best song, to nobody's surprise. It's a rare song written for a movie that actually sounds as if it could have been a big hit years ago in the hero's career. T Bone Burnett, a tall drink of water in dark shades, strode on stage with co-writer Ryan Bingham, but to general disappointment, I suspect, didn't say anything. A guy named T Bone wins an Oscar, you wanna hear him talk. In the craft categories, \"Avatar\" won for its art direction and production design, which was only right, since its designers essentially designed a new world and everything in it. \"James Cameron,\" co-winner Rick Carter said, \"this Oscar sees you.\" Cameron oversaw the exhaustive detail work on the creation and even the biology of that world. \"Avatar\" also won for visual effects — a foregone conclusion —over \"District 9\" and \"Star Trek.\" The category also encompassed the film's 3-D presentation, which was central to its success. Lastly, \"Avatar\" won for cinematography, a choice I'm conflicted about. Wasn't much of the image creation done inside computers with CGI? Yes, the cinematographer had to fill needless scenes of actors before green screens, but the cinematography in \"Inglourious Basterds\" and \"The White Ribbon\" was so much more impressive. \"Star Trek\" won for makeup, in a category that also included only \"The Young Victoria\" and \"Il Divo\" — the latter a film in which you weren't supposed to notice the actor's makeup. Sandy Powell won her third costume design Oscar, after \"The Aviator\" and \"Shakespeare in Love,\" for \"The Young Victoria.\" She dedicated it to the costume designers of contemporary or low-budget films that are \"not about monarchs.\" At the evening's end, there was joy that \"The Hurt Locker\" won, but it was sort of a letdown because the ceremony lacked excitement. The choice of hosts Baldwin and Martin, which struck me as inspired, turned out to be a miscalculation. In years past, did co-hosts alternate lines? Comic timing depends on one person's delivery, unless we're talking about a seasoned comedy team. The two never felt like a team, and apparently didn't have their lines memorized, which led to tiny but fatal delays. So much went as predicted. I correctly chose 15 of the top 17 winners, was wrong in both script categories and can hardly be faulted for thinking \"Coco Before Chanel\" would win for costume design. I have a feeling Vegas cleaned up from people believing this year couldn't be that easy to predict. Next Article: The Winners!

Detour off the yellow brick road and dare to explore a different side of America’s favorite fairytale.Long before Dorothy’s coming-of-age adventures with Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion, two other young girls meet in the magical Land of Oz. Elphaba, a smart, fiery outcast born with emerald-green skin finds an unlikely friend in her college roommate Galinda, later Glinda -- the beautiful, popular blonde. One of Broadway’s biggest blockbuster musicals, Wicked explores the untold story of the witches of Oz. The Emmy Award-winning actress and comedian Nicole Parker brings the complicated character of Elphaba to life in the Broadway production of Wicked, which opens at the San Diego Civic Theatre on Wednesday. Known best for her work on MADtv, Parker fine tunes her funny woman ways on stage as the sardonic, misunderstood Wicked Witch of the West. Nicole Parker gives us a glimpse into her wicked role.Q: How do you prepare for the role of Elphaba?A: There is definitely a routine for surviving the role! Mentally I like to do some yoga and/or meditation, or walk on the treadmill. That takes care of you mentally AND physically. It quiets my brain and warms me up at the same time. Then I vocally exercise which is a slow process. I give myself plenty of time because every day is different, sometimes it takes your body longer to get on board. Last thing is to remind myself to tell the story. Right before I run out for my first entrance it's just a reminder to stay focused. And after that you just go on the ride!Nicole Parker+Read Caption Nicole Parker Share Photo✉Q: How is your personality off stage similar to or different from your character on stage?A: Well, at least with the younger act 1 Elphaba, I relate because I was kind of bookish and nerdy, and didn't always feel like I fit in. I was also very talkative and opinionated. I wore glasses, had a bad perm, etc... I was NOT a Glinda. So I definitely identify with Elphaba when it comes to being different, not mainstream, kind of an oddball. I used humor all the time to get through awkward moments or to survive amongst the cliques, much like Elphie uses humor to deflect her pain or anger. Nowadays, I think I still share her qualities of sometimes not letting people get a word in edgewise (ask my husband), a side effect of her/us being very passionate and sensitive. I do wish I had more of her courage and tenacity. But I certainly have got the nerd/outcast back story going for me. Q: What is your favorite scene in Wicked?A: It seems like a cheat, but this answer changes from time to time. One moment I always look forward to is the scene with Popular in it. It is the first scene for me in the show where things really slow down for a moment and we get to really see these two girls become friends. I love when Alli sings Popular, she is so funny and keeps it fresh every time. It's just a very enjoyable and special part of the show for me.Q: Memories of growing up watching Wizard of Oz?A: Absolutely. I remember it was such an event because the Wizard of Oz was only televised once a year. My sister and I were always so excited and it was always a family event. We made fresh popped popcorn every time and I was so happy when the opening credits would begin. It was so special, so that makes Wicked all the more special as well.Q: What are your back stage rituals?A: Oh, so many. The last time I did Wicked when I was in New York/Broadway, my husband got sent to the local grocery store for the same specific things so often that the checkout girls would ask,\"When is she due?\" I have all sorts of supplements and elixirs that I superstitiously believe keep me well: Wellness Formula, Entertainer's Secret, a spray I use, vitamins etc. I eat a steak on a two show day for the protein. There are certain cast or crew members I check in with at the same time every show, and that keeps me going!Q: Walk us through the makeup and wardrobe transformation.A: It is a surprisingly quick process. It takes about twenty-five minutes. It takes three people to do make-up, hair, and wardrobe, respectively. The green is applied with what looks like a paintbrush, we do my face and hands, and there is lots of powder involved so I don't make everybody that I touch green! My hair is pinned up under a nylon wig cap, then I wear two small body mics right on my forehead, and the Elphaba wig is fitted over those. After that we put the rest of the costume on and Elphie is ready to make her entrance!Q: In your opinion, why has Wicked become such a successful pop culture phenomenon?A: It's storytelling at its best. It's an accessible story that has a humanity that anyone can relate to, everyone can in invest in, and above all, the audience cares about these characters. There will always be someone out there in the audience who identifies with Elphaba, feels like the outcast, feels bullied, misunderstood. On the flip side, there will always be people who identify with Glinda, being popular, and misunderstood in their own way. People really respond to these women, their journey, their friendship, and it just resonates with audiences in a special way. Wicked's other incredible strength is that it is building on an iconic story, The Wizard of Oz. It is so embedded in our culture that most people come into the theater already having that backstory to build on, and there is already a nostalgia that touches an emotional core with them. It's visually and musically epic as well, which contributes to making Wicked a totally unique event.Q: When you’re not working, where can we find you?A: If I could choose to do anything would be going for a walk with my dachsund and my husband. In the summer his family spends a lot of time on the lake, wakeboarding and wakesurfing. So we do that. We love going to Hawaii to surf! I also perform improv at the Groundlings or UCB when I am in LA. I travel so much for work, that being home is unique!Q: What new acting projects are you working on this year?A: Some things are up in the air as of now so I can't say! I am always auditioning and it can take months for people to make decisions! I will be performing with Alli Mauzey (Glinda on tour) in several symphony concerts across the country starting in the fall. And I am always writing and developing new ideas! I would love to go back to Broadway!Q: The moment you knew you wanted to pursue acting?A: I grew up in Southern California in Irvine, and began taking acting classes for fun just like my older sister at South Coast Repertory's program for children. I was seven, and remember my first recital; I was singing a song, and I remember the audience's response, and I remember when I made them laugh. I was absolutely certain at that moment I wanted to do that forever. So I did several Young Conservatory Player's productions as well as main stage plays at SCR. I grew up in the theater. It is home to me. I continued performing throughout high school, and went to Indiana University for theater and voice. There I joined an improv comedy group, so my interests were varied. I did musicals, but also went to Chicago to learn how to write sketches and improvise. When I graduated, I got hired at a theater in Amsterdam called Boom Chicago, an all American theater in Holland that features a nightly sketch/improv show, much like Second City. I lived in Europe for two years, and learned so much. From that job, I had so many connections in the comedy world that even though I moved to New York to pursue musical theater, MADtv auditioned me and I got hired. That began another chapter in my life on Fox's sketch show that was so invaluable. Eventually I made it to Broadway with Martin SHort's one man show. I have been very lucky to have gained so much experience in two areas of entertainment that I equally love and enjoy.Q: Do you watch “Smash”? How is life on Broadway similar to / different from the characters and drama we see on TV?A: Of course I do! It's about a musical!! I also have so many friends on it, which is why it is so fun to watch. I would say the real drama behind the scenes of theater is sometimes even BETTER and crazier than anything on Smash! So yes, there are similarities. Of course they have dramatized certain aspects as you have to with any show because it needs to appeal to a mainstream audience, not just people who do theater for a living! There is most definitely competition in our industry, but it's not so in your face as it is on the show. When I show up to an audition and I see the usual girls I'm up against, everyone is always very friendly and respectful with each other, but inside everyone is thinking, \"Oh crap, she's here? She's so good!!! There's no way I'll get it!\" At least that's what I think sometimes! It's more under the surface, because it's not made for tv, people are more subtle in real life, although that's just my personal experience. But Smash portrays so many very real aspects of the business--the sacrifices, the disappointments, the rejection and the doubt, all of that is very real.Q: Do you visit San Diego often? What do you love about Southern California lifestyle?A: Of course! My sister went to UCSD and I used to visit her all the time. My family always used to go to the Hotel Del Coronado at Christmas time, and my husband was a Marine stationed at Coronado the first year we dated. So I have made the drive from LA to San Diego many, many times. I have so many great memories here. My husband proposed to me on the beach in front of the Hotel! I just love the laid back and relaxed, but active lifestyle of Southern California. It's so easy to live a healthy life here. The weather is so great, there is so much to do outdoors. Everyone is out, but the pace is easy. I also just love beach fashion. I don't know how many items I have from Roxy and Quicksilver but the number is high. I grew up on the beach, so for me, you can't beat a Pacific Ocean sunset.Wicked runs June 20 - July 15 at the San Diego Civic Theatre.

Neal Romanek reports. The UK’s Deluxe Digital Cinema, in partnership with Hewlett-Packard, is aiming to change European film distribution with a terrestrial delivery network that plans to connect more than 8,000 sites in the UK and Europe. The network will allow Deluxe to distribute on behalf of its clients — which include Fox, Sony, Paramount, Universal and others — directly to cinemas.“The real end goal was for electronic distribution that was terrestrial, as opposed to physical, ie, hard drives,” says Richard Fish, commercial director at Deluxe, “and it couldn’t cost any more than current delivery mechanisms. At the end of the day, getting a hard drive to site has proven to be cost effective and efficient, so to bring a new solution to market means we have to work within the boundaries of what it currently costs the distributor and the size of the file they can move by satellite or by hard drive.”The new network will be able to deliver a 500GB digital cinema package (DCP), with average connectivity of 50MBS. “We can deliver a terabyte too,” Fish says, “but that will just take a little bit longer.”Deluxe managing director Ken Biggins and digital cinema managing director Peter Wright had championed the idea of a digital distribution network for some years, but the technology was too expensive and too slow. When the right combination of fast speed and low cost arrived, Deluxe approached Hewlett-Packard. “We had quite a detailed cost model when we went into negotiations with Hewlett-Packard,” says Laurence Claydon, technical director at Deluxe. “They came back to us and that opened a few more doors than we expected. It made something that was a near-possibility into a reality.”Deluxe is being aggressive in rolling out the network. With the help of Hewlett-Packard’s field engineering and support teams, the company aims to be connected to 6,000 sites over the next 24 months, beginning with the UK and France then spreading to other European territories. Deluxe admits it is asking a lot of European telecommunications companies. Claydon says: “We need this network to be what the internet will be in about 10 years’ time, but we need it now.”Hewlett-Packard has a long track record of involvement with telecoms and content delivery network providers and was a natural partner choice for Deluxe. With the company’s help, Deluxe is riding on the next generation of broadband roll-out across Europe, choosing the sites where they can get the best connectivity and piggy-backing on these new deployments as they happen.Claydon says the Deluxe-Hewlett-Packard network will be far greener than current hard-drive distribution: “At the moment, we’re still shipping hard drives in vans and ships and planes. Ultimately, it will reduce the carbon footprint of feature film distribution, which will be welcomed by everyone. Electronic distribution via a network will only get cheaper and faster, whereas fuel prices are going to keep rising.”Tailored to local markets With hard drives and satellite, distributors need to deliver to a minimum number of sites to make the unit cost viable. The point-to-point nature of the Deluxe network will allow for greater localisation and flexibility without the number of screens on which a film runs being any financial barrier.Claydon thinks the network will lower the cost of entry to many independent and local films. “Because we’re putting together a European network, a lot of it will be based on local content for each territory, so we’ve partnered with vendors in territories, like Eclair in France, to increase volumes, making the network financially viable. In a lot of territories we distribute in, local content is a significant portion of the market.”Fish agrees the network will allow exhibitors to target local audiences more successfully. “If your cinema is in a seaside town, for example, over certain seasons you could target certain demographics coming in. A cinema could run different themes — films from the ’60s or ’80s or an animation season during school holidays. It will certainly allow exhibitors more flexibility, but our main aim is to distribute more efficiently on behalf of content owners.” ScreenTech: The return of film Digital’s phase two Inaugural UK Digital Cinema conference assesses the state of digital cinema Cannes Classics line-up revealed; Costa-Gavras guest of honour Deluxe Connect set for Germany trial Commensurate with local ex-pat rates Researcher Competitive CONTENT SERVICES TECHNICIAN - NIGHTS £24,775 - £27,864 per annum Find more jobs\n\n影视\n\n2016-36/0813/en_head.json.gz/2434\n\nWasabi is on-air Wasabi is sad his revolution failed.

Honestly, the sequels and rehashes just have me feeling pretty blah about the whole movie industry in general at the moment. But let's not kid ourselves, the good stuff comes out during the summer, and that's what I am taking a look at to ignore the slop that's out at the moment. Screw you March and April movies. You do not exist. Iron Man 3 - May 3I love Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark. Just seeing him on the screen makes me grin. This movie shows Iron Man floundering after the events of The Avengers. It also is the introduction of The Mandarin, one of the big bads from the comic series. The one thing I have seen so far in these ads that has sat wrong with me is Rhodes in the \"Iron Patriot\" suit. I don't particularly like the character much, and frankly him in one of those suits just bothers me. Don't get me wrong, I'm still going to see this, but I am prepared to be irked. Oh, and a new trailer is coming out on March 5, 2013.Star Trek Into Darkness - May 17I'm not going to lie to you, I am fangirl squee factor 10 excited for a new Star Trek movie. It looks dark, gritty, and completely different, which the franchise has needed for a bit. Something a little off center to bring you back around in the end to what the core ideals of that universe are about. Benedict Cumberbatch is the villain of the film, John Harrison. People have been wildly speculating that he was Khan, or some kind of rebooted Khan for a while now. There was also a lot of internet speculation about Carol Marcus being in this film, and if she and Kirk will hook up again. Needless to say, I will be there. The trailer, if you've somehow managed to miss this: After Earth - June 7I freely admit to having a Will Smith problem. He is not what I would call a typical action hero type, but he just rocks it somehow. This movie is set a thousand years after humanity had to escape Earth after a disaster to a planet called Nova Prime. Will Smith plays a general who is away from home frequently, coming back to his son, played by his own son, of course. They end up being whacked by an asteroid storm and crashing down on the now dangerous Earth. This is where the \"unfortunately\" starts coming into play, because Will Smith is dying and the story will follow Jaden's character. It's also directed by M. Night Shyamalan. This might be one Smith project I pass on with the mostly miss nature of most of Shyamalan's recent projects.Man of Steel - June 14 The trailer: The world needs another Superman reboot movie like it needs an infestation of termites. Personally, I don't particularly like the character of Superman. I find him to be an uptight Boy Scout who needs to realize that the world is shades of gray, and not black and white. The trailers I've seen so far don't really seem to indicate this movie will really be anything other than more of the same. The first thing I thought when I saw the Superman suit was, \"Hey isn't that Thor's outfit?\" Pacific Rim - July 12The story line posted for this movie directed by Guillermo del Toro details a group of creatures rising from the sea to start a war that consumes humanity's resources. They construct giant robots called Jaegers that are controlled by two pilots mind locked in a neural bridge. They don't seem to help unfortunately, and with humanity losing badly, two scrubs will come forward to pick up a supposedly obsolete Jaeger to fight once more.I'm not going to lie here, I'd never even heard of this before researching for this article. There's just something fun about giant mecha movies.The Wolverine - July 26The Wolverine director James Mangold said the film is actually a sequel to the last ensemble X-Men film. As Mangold said, \"Where this film sits in the universe of the films is after them all. Jean Grey is gone, most of the X-Men are disbanded or gone, so there's a tremendous sense of isolation for him.\" I'd link a trailer, but there doesn't appear to be one. This makes me mildly scared. Ok, the fact they're making another solo Wolverine movie makes me scared. The first one isn't exactly what I would call awesome, so I'm already skeptical going in on this one. Allegedly the trailer will start popping up at the end of March, but really, considering the other movies already pumping out media hype for summer movies, the lack of trailer is making people twitchy.The official synopsis is: Based on the celebrated comic book arc, this epic action-adventure takes Wolverine, the most iconic character of the X-Men universe, to modern day Japan. Out of his depth in an unknown world he faces his ultimate nemesis in a life-or-death battle that will leave him forever changed. Vulnerable for the first time and pushed to his physical and emotional limits, he confronts not only lethal samurai steel but also his inner struggle against his own immortality, emerging more powerful than we have ever seen him before. Elysium - August 9 Another movie I hadn't heard of, this one has Matt Damon and Jodie Foster in it. It's set in 2159 where the very rich live on a man made space station called Elysium and the rest live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. Foster is a douchebag politician who tries to stop any poor people from getting in, and of course, they try. Damon is a sap that gets screwed into taking a no-win mission to bring some equality to the people. It's tagged as sci-fi, but that synopsis makes me think it's more of a human rights or equality story. To be honest, I am left with a feeling of \"haven't I seen this movie before?\" after reading about it. It's entirely possible I've just read too many books with this kind of a story line, who knows. Nerd Fail... Other potential movies of interest that are coming out this summer include World War Z based on the book, Kick-Ass 2, Riddick, and 300: Rise of An Empire. I haven't read World War Z, I didn't watch Kick-Ass, I haven't watched any of the other Riddick movies, and I didn't watch 300, so I don't feel particularly like I have enough information to say anything about these other than they're coming.

The audience-grabbing potential is so obvious that this is actually the fourth time it's been done in the show's history. “Asylum of the Daleks” also gives showrunner Steven Moffat his first chance to write a Dalek story, having deliberately rested the creatures last year—the first season since the show was revived in 2005 that the Daleks were not used (except for a one-scene cameo in the finale). Without the additional pressure of introducing a new Doctor or companion, or setting up a season-spanning arc plot, Moffat's season opener is a successful standalone adventure with several touches of horror that call to mind his earlier efforts during the Russell T Davies era. A sombre mood is set from the outset as the episode opens on Skaro, the blasted, ruined homeworld of the Daleks. Inside a giant statue of a Dalek (“Hell of a choice of meeting place.” “They said I'd have to intrigue you”), the Doctor (Matt Smith) has come to meet a woman, Darla (Anamaria Marinca), who wants him to rescue her daughter from a Dalek prison camp. As we saw in last year's Christmas special, the Doctor is now determined to keep a low profile following his escape from the Silence's attempt to kill him, and so he is not pleased that this woman has somehow managed to get a message to him. Darla: “They say you can help.” The Doctor: “Do they? I wish they'd stop.” But he soon discovers that the whole thing is a trap—the woman is a Dalek agent, sent to capture him. Her human personality vanishes as a Dalek eye-stalk erupts from her forehead and a Dalek gun from her hand. The idea of the Daleks employing controlled humans as slaves is certainly not new (it goes back as far as the 'Robomen' in 1964's “The Dalek Invasion of Earth”), but it's never before been shown in such a creepy and graphic fashion. On board a huge Dalek ship, the Doctor is reunited with his erstwhile companions, Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), who have been collected from their lives on Earth by other Dalek agents. They find themselves in the “Parliament of the Daleks”—a massive amphitheatre filled with hundreds of the creatures, all chanting the last thing the Doctor expected to hear—“Save us! Save the Daleks!” It was rather amusing to see that, after the poor reception given to the “new paradigm” Daleks introduced in 2010's “Victory of the Daleks”, they are very much in the minority here. The Parliament chamber is populated almost exclusively with the older bronze models, although the few representatives of the new design we see appear to have been given a face-saving officer status. In any case, the setup for the main story follows, as we learn of the Daleks' legendary Asylum—a planet where the Daleks dump all their failures: “the battle-scarred, the insane…the ones even you can't control.” The Daleks have gone to the trouble of kidnapping the Doctor because the supposedly impenetrable Asylum has been breached. In a deliberately disjointed scene (typical of Moffat) after the opening titles, we see a young woman named Oswin, apparently alone and under siege in the Asylum, who identifies herself as a crew member of a spaceship that crashed on this planet. She has been hacking into the Asylum's systems and disrupting them. Realizing that this could open a way for all of the inmates to escape, the Daleks intend to beam the Doctor, Amy and Rory down to the Asylum, where they will be trapped until the Doctor can turn off the planet's protective force field, allowing the Daleks to vaporize it. I enjoyed the confrontation between the Doctor and the Dalek “prime minister”—a wizened creature in a glass tank very similar to the one seen as the “Emperor Dalek” in 2005's “The Parting of the Ways”—in particular, the designation of the Doctor as “the Predator of the Daleks,” and the following exchange: The Doctor: “You think hatred is beautiful.” Dalek Prime Minister: “Perhaps that is why we have never been able to kill you.” It's also worth taking a moment to give credit to the contribution of Nicholas Briggs, who has single-handedly provided the voices for all of the Daleks (as well as the Cybermen, and various other aliens) since the series was revived in 2005. His ability to create different characters for the various different types of Daleks is, I think, a very significant factor in the success the creatures have had in the new series. As they are beamed down to the planet, Rory gets separated from the others, falling down a deep hole into a large underground chamber, while Amy and the Doctor encounter Harvey (David Gyasi), apparently another survivor from the crashed spaceship. At this point Moffat rolls out an effective string of horror movie ideas, as Harvey takes the Doctor and Amy back to his escape pod, only for them to realize that his fellow crewmates are long dead…whereupon Harvey realizes that he's actually dead and has become “Dalek-ised” (just like the woman Darla) by the Asylum's “nano-cloud” which transforms all intruding organic matter into Dalek material. Then, no sooner have the Doctor and Amy fought Harvey off than his zombie crewmates rise up and threaten them in the same way. Moffat could be accused of recycling his previous concepts here—the nano-cloud is basically the same as the nanogenes from “The Empty Child,” and the idea of the walking corpse, unaware of its own death, harks back to the skeletons in spacesuits from “Silence in the Library”. But it's certainly a nicely macabre idea that anyone attacking the Asylum gets absorbed into its own security system. In order to protect against the effects of the nano-cloud, the Doctor and his friends are given special protective wristbands. These represent a rare failure in the design department—they are so large and bulky that Amy is left looking incredibly stupid on two occasions, when she fails to immediately notice that the attacking zombies have taken her wristband off her arm, and again later when the Doctor sneaks his own wristband onto her. The direction by Nick Hurran lives up to the high standard he showed on his debut last year with “The Girl Who Waited” and “The God Complex”. From the impressive CGI of the Parliament chamber, to the contrast between the vast snowy expanses of the planet exterior and the cramped, dingy underground tunnels infested with Daleks, the episode is full of memorable visuals. In particular, there's a lovely bit of dreamlike imagery when Amy, falling under the influence of the nano-cloud, sees a roomful of people, including a twirling ballerina, which then becomes a roomful of Daleks, with the ballerina replaced by a Dalek spinning serenely in place. Once the Doctor and the others are all underground, they have the problem of finding each other in the maze of corridors and chambers while avoiding getting killed by the mostly dormant but still dangerous Daleks. It was lovely to see many of the older Dalek designs from the classic series in these chambers (although some of them were a little difficult to make out under the layers of grime). I also particularly enjoyed the neat trick the Doctor employed to use one Dalek's self-destruct impulse to take out the others. Meanwhile, Rory is doing his best to keep out of the Daleks' way, although eventually he has to be rescued by the watching Oswin. Which brings me to the big surprise of the episode… It didn't take long before I realized that Oswin was being played by Jenna-Louise Coleman, who (as was announced months ago) will be portraying the Doctor's new companion Clara, starting from this year's Christmas special. I can only congratulate Moffat on managing to pull off this surprise, which required the co-operation of the press and preview audiences in several different countries. Particularly ingenious is that the trick succeeds regardless of whether the viewer is aware of Coleman's significance—for those who don't know that she is scheduled to become the next companion, the surprise will come at Christmas when the Doctor meets someone who reminds him so much of the woman he encountered in this episode. It remains to be seen whether there is any real connection between Oswin and the new companion, or whether they are simply being played by the same actress (as happened with Karen Gillan, who played a soothsayer in “The Fires of Pompeii” two years before she appeared as Amy). It's worth noting that, unlike Gillan's case (and earlier, with Freema Agyeman), Coleman's role in this episode would only have come about after she was cast as the new companion. So despite Moffat's stated intention to move away from last season's complex arc plotting, there are clearly still some connections being established between episodes. As if to remove all doubt on this point, Coleman gives a coy little glance directly into the camera as she delivers her final line: “Run, you clever boy. And remember…” As for her actual performance, I was very impressed. She's a natural at handling Moffat's comic dialogue, and her flirting with Rory and fast-talking banter with the Doctor was a delight. At the same time, she managed to project enough confidence and intelligence to make Oswin's labeling of herself as a “genius” believable. And when given the chance to emote more deeply, as Oswin's ultimate fate is revealed, she was well up to the task. I've never seen any of her work before, but based on this episode, I'm very much looking forward to her joining the show permanently later on. But enough about the companion-in-waiting; the relationship between the Doctor's current companions is the second major focus of this episode. The first five episodes of this season, leading up to a hiatus before the Christmas special, will bring the story of Amy and Rory to a close. In fact they are already partly out of the Doctor's life—their days as permanent travelers aboard the TARDIS ended in last year's “The God Complex,” and each episode since has faced the challenge of finding a way to involve them in the story. Here, they are collected by the Daleks to accompany the Doctor on the frankly flimsy justification that “it is known that the Doctor requires companions.” It's soon apparent that Amy and Rory's marriage is more than in trouble; when we first see them, they're actually signing divorce papers while exchanging barbed insults. Once on board the Dalek ship, Amy is annoyed at the realization that the Doctor will inevitably notice the distance between her and Rory and try to do something about it. In a stark contrast to her dreams of her magic Doctor when we first met her two years ago, she now dismisses his desire to help: Amy: “Don't give me those big wet eyes, raggedy man. It's life. Just life. That thing that goes on when you're not there.” When Rory realizes that Amy has lost her protective wristband and decides to give her his to buy her some time, they finally confront the cause of their split. We find out that thanks to her experiences on Demon's Run, Amy can't have the children that she knows Rory desires, which has led to her pushing him away.
