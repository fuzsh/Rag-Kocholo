        "text": "by Paul Batters\n\n“Mon cœur te choisit. Sans toi, je n’existe pas.” – Belle (Josette Day)\n\n(My heart has chosen you. Without you, I do not exist).\n\nThe beautiful story of ‘the beauty and the beast’ is one not unfamiliar to modern audiences. Younger generations will be familiar with the tale from the Disney animation production, as well as more recent versions which have told the story as a musical. Despite lavish production and box office clout, they pale in comparison to the 1946 film created by the brilliant Jean Cocteau. As a masterpiece of French cinema, La Belle et La Bete deserves respect for its innovative cinematography, brilliant set design, and strong emphasis on symbolism and surrealism. It’s a cinematic piece of poetry, with layered meaning and thematic concerns, that transcends time and stands as a legacy for those who love fantasy film.\n\nLa Belle et La Bette explores the transformative power of love and compassion, as well as the theme of inner beauty. Yet there are some other fascinating and more complex themes that the film conveys as well, and this article seeks to consider those and discuss them a little further.\n\nThe fairy tale tells of Belle (Josette Day), a young woman who sacrifices herself in place of her father who has found himself in an incredible predicament. Finding himself in the grounds of an enchanted castle, he takes a rose from the garden for his daughter. However, the master of the castle, the Beast (Jean Marais) appears and threatens him with death for plucking the rose. Imploring the Beast to let him go, he promises one of his daughters to the Beast in place of himself. The Beast agrees and Belle is sent to the castle. Though amazed at the magic she encounters, she faints in horror at the first sight of the Beast. His monstrous appearance is too much to bear but as time goes on those feelings will change. Belle’s initial terror and even disgust will be shed as she looks beyond his bestial appearance and finds the heart and soul that lie within the Beast. Thus, Cocteau seeks to examine the power of relationships and perhaps how there is hope for humanity if we can look beyond the superficial and truly find our own and each other’s humanity beyond the value of appearance.\n\nThe Beast is certainly a classic trope in the traditional fairy tale and Cocteau uses this to address the power of transformation through love and compassion. Underneath his terror-inspiring and monstrous appearance lies a gentle and kind spirit, and a cursed soul as the audience will discover. The curse of loneliness, of course, is upon him as well. Forced to live in solitude, the Beast is without even the most basic interactions of the most superficial relationship. He is too terrifying to look upon. Yet Cocteau also wants the audience to see the vulnerability of the Beast; for despite the fear and terror that he inspires, the Beast is desperate for love and acceptance. His power, both in the physical and in his enchantment of his environment both become meaningless in the face of losing his Belle, and the pain that he feels cripples him beyond measure.\n\nLikewise, Belle is also transformed through love and compassion. Seeing beyond the Beast’s terrible appearance and fearful demeanour, she sees the very heart of his desperate desire to love and be loved. An underlying subplot is her love for her father and Belle’s willingness to sacrifice herself to save his life. In that context, Belle is also willing to stay with the Beast which means giving up the life she has known. Of course, the classic theme of inner versus outer beauty is ever-present and the journey to discovering which is the most important and lasting, is fundamental to Belle’s journey. Of course, Belle is more than a beautiful young woman on the outside, with a deep inner kindness and goodness that the Beast recognises. This reviewer would suggest that it is this characteristic of Belle that the Beast actually falls in love with, and certainly Cocteau spoke of this being the deeper meaning behind the story, stating that “I understood that ‘La Belle et la Bête’ was the story of the real love that transcends appearances.”\n\nFurthermore, Belle’s willingness to sacrifice her own freedom for her father reflects the theme of selflessness and familial love. This act of sacrifice sets in motion the events that lead to the Beast’s redemption. Similarly, the Beast’s transformation from a cruel and selfish creature into a compassionate prince is brought about by Belle’s love and sacrifice. Indeed, love serves as a catalyst for transformation in the film. Belle’s love for the Beast is what ultimately breaks the curse and transforms him back into a human prince. Thus, Cocteau’s interpretation emphasizes the idea that love has the capacity to bring about positive change and redemption. Cocteau would state that ‘ love is born from sacrifice, and that is the basis of the human condition” and this is undoubtedly interwoven into the text of the film.\n\nAdditionally, Cocteau examines the need for forgiveness and compassion as crucial facets to the power and existence of love. This does include only forgiveness and compassion for others but the importance of being able to do for one’s self. The Beast learns to let go of his past mistakes and insecurities, embracing his true identity and capacity for love. He is able to do so because of Belle’s compassion and empathy towards him, but this is also true of his own ability to accept it himself. An acknowledgement of the heart finds the Beast finally transforming his own sense of self as well, declaring “It is the heart that sees clearly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.” Whilst this of course highlights the film’s theme of the inner self being far more important than outer appearances, it also amplifies the sense of revelation that the Beast feels. For it is love that casts out the darkness, and frees the Beast from the evil spell cast on him.\n\nCocteau, as film historian Sylvia Bryant pointed out, took the classic fairy tale narrative form and brought into a cinematic text keeping place the codified fairy tale characterisation. Perhaps it is the incredible talents which Cocteau possessed that allowed this to be done successfully. The audience finds itself in a dream-like fantasy world, with an atmosphere which is incredibly surreal punctuated by the reality of the emotions experienced by the key characters. Film Quarterly suggested that Cocteau’s work ‘transcends the confines of the fairy tale genre, offering a profound meditation on love, sacrifice, and the transformative power of redemption’. The other-worldly atmosphere and magic of the world in which the Beast, however, cannot conceal or dampen the pain and anguish that he feels. Nor is the love that he has in his heart able to be extinguished. Indeed, it heightens that very pain. Yet both he and Belle need to traverse through this pain and emerge free from their bounds, transformed by the very emotion which also fed their anxieties. The need to be vulnerable, as both Belle and the Beast make themselves, is thus fundamental to this transformation.\n\nThere is an ethereal and ever-present magic to Cocteau’s La Belle et La Bete. He said that he wanted to make something beautiful – and he succeeded.\n\nPaul Batters teaches secondary school History in the Illawarra region and also lectures at the University Of Wollongong. In a previous life, he was involved in community radio and independent publications. Looking to a career in writing, Paul also has a passion for film history.\n\nby Paul Batters\n\n“The whole world’s gone crazy. Am I the only sane one left?” Mr. Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold)\n\n“No, sir. Just the most frightened.” Grandpa Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore)\n\nFrom cinema’s earliest days (and particularly when film began to talk), film-makers have turned to the stage for great stories. Stage plays rely on dialogue to drive story and allow character development, whilst holding the attention and interest of the audience. It’s no wonder that during the first years of sound, the studios not only turned to actors and actresses who could speak and annunciate but they turned to writers who could write dialogue for the all-new talkies. It’s no surprise that the work and material of two legendary writers of Broadway, George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, would find its way to the silver screen. Such was the case with You Can’t Take It With You (1938), directed by Frank Capra, which would become one of 1938’s biggest hits in cinema theatres.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize winning stage play had an incredible successful run after it premiered on Broadway, with a grand total of 838 performances till it wound up in 1937. As with any play by Kaufman and Hart, the sharp, crackling and witty dialogue was delivered by a superb cast whose comedic timing wowed audiences. The critics were also impressed with the back-and-forth between the eccentric yet warm Sycamore family and the conservative and very traditional Kirbys. It’s no wonder that the play drew the attention of Hollywood, particularly director Frank Capra – it was a story that was his cup of tea. Whilst Paramount had an option on the play, it was Columbia who took the challenge on with Capra at the helm. Columbia’s powerful studio boss, Harry Cohn had his concerns, as Capra’s perfectionism and attention to detail often saw him go over budget and over time. It had not been that long ago when Columbia was one of the poor studios and in many ways was still not one of the majors. However, Capra would spare Cohn (relatively speaking) the headache of his obsessiveness and did not go too far over budget as well as wrapping up pretty much on time. Well four days over time. Like the play, the film be a huge hit; likewise wooing the critics. It would go on to win the Oscar for Best Picture and for Capra, an astonishing third Oscar for Best Director in the space of four years.\n\nOf course, the shaping of any book, poetic work or stage play into a successful film can be challenging. Naturally, there is a fine balancing act between maintaining textual integrity and shaping a script that is workable and transferable to the screen. Capra turned to regular collaborator Robert Riskin, the incredibly skilled writer who would co-write the screenplay. Together, they got the balance just right. The script retained the core elements of the play’s wit, humour and social commentary of the original, and enhanced it with visual gags and physical comedy that worked well on screen. Actor Jack Lemmon once said that ‘you don’t change George Kaufman unless you’re pretty damn good’; in this case Riskin was and the proof was in the final product. As Capra had done previously (and would become known for), the story’s warmth and humour were paralleled with the social commentary and thematic concerns that resonated with audiences living through the Depression. The timeless ideal of the pursuit of happiness in one’s passions and the sheer joy found in life, regardless of wealth, was more than a cliché or escape from reality. The Sycamores allowed audiences to embrace the unconventional and find joy in being authentic in one’s individuality. Indeed, the Sycamores prized individuality and the expression of oneself. Given the strictures of conformity and social conventions of the time, it must have been refreshing for audiences to watch the Sycamores become the personification of challenging those norms. Riskin and Capra were able to maintain the textual integrity of Kaufman and Moss and transfer their overall interpretation onto the screen with incredible success.\n\nOf course, none of this could work without an outstanding cast. Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur are superb, and their chemistry is more than evident. Capra naturally saw this, which would lead to the pair bringing that chemistry to the screen again the following year in perhaps Capra’s greatest film Mr. Smith Goes To Washington. Both Edward Arnold and Lionel Barrymore play the respective heads of the Kirby and Sycamore families; their status as two of the greatest character actors of their time needs no defence from this reviewer. All would bring a naturalness to their performances which was all the more endearing to audiences (and remains so). But the supporting cast is where the magic happens as well and they allow for the main players to work with scope and depth. Indeed, Spring Byington would be a nominee for Best Supporting Actress for her turn as Penny Sycamore. The cast’s overall comedic timing, incredible talent in hitting the mark and reacting to each other, complimented the tight and snappy dialogue. The interactions and dynamics between and within both families is a treat to watch. For Jimmy Stewart, most notably, it would mean a huge shift in his career that would hardly change bar his time in the Service during WW1. Capra saw in Stewart the epitome of American idealism and hope – the everyman who audiences connected with.\n\nAs important and affirming as the Oscar wins were, You Can’t Take It With You needs not the validation to have it sit amongst the best films of the 1930s. Yes, the cinematic experience is always going to be a departure from the realities of life and certainly audiences of then 1930s needed to escape the difficulties and harshness of the Depression. However, to describe You Can’t Take It With You as mere escapism or idealistic optimism misses the point. One could almost miss the biting criticism that Capra makes of society’s superficial drive and ambition for material gain, as well as the snobbery and ugly contempt that the rich and powerful have for the masses. During the dinner scene, Grandpa Martin (Lionel Barrymore) will challenge Mr. Kirby (Edward Arnold) for his scorn for the poor, questioning Kirby’s superiority and declaring him to be impoverished for having no friends. Later, Ramsay (H.B Warner), one of Kirby’s rivals, will call him a loser and a failure of a man. Despite the ‘happy’ ending that will result, the film’s themes are not posturing or shallow. They are one of the reasons that the film held such powerful sway over audiences of the day.\n\nUndoubtedly, the charm of the film undoubtedly pulled audiences into the theatres as well. But the beautiful portrayal of the Sycamores as a loving family filled with joy and accepting of others, despite all their eccentricities and problems, gave hope to people sitting in the audience. It encouraged the embracing of the individual and the joy in being oneself, as well as pursuing one’s dreams (a very Capraesque ideal as well). Most importantly, the film speaks for today’s audiences as much as it did then. In a time of political and economic uncertainty, after navigating the difficulties of a pandemic as well, we should heed the film’s message – that relationships and family we have are the true wealth that we possess. At times the film feels ‘stagy’ but not so that it takes much away from the experience. Whilst not as powerful or polished as some of Capra’s most celebrated films, You Can’t Take It With You Its wonderful quality remains, across all its elements and one where the best of Broadway and the best of cinema melded into an incredible experience for audiences for all time.\n\nPaul Batters teaches secondary school History in the Illawarra region and also lectures at the University Of Wollongong.

Charles Tobin (Otto Kruger)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock rightfully deserves his place in cinematic history as the master of suspense. From the silent era through to the 1970s, Hitchcock made some of the screen’s greatest films that still shock and thrill audiences. His name is part of the pantheon of great directors, and he was also one of the few directors whose name went above the film’s title and was enough to draw in an audience. As with all filmmakers, not all his films are perfect and indeed have flaws but even his weaker films are entertaining and still have great moments.\n\nSaboteur (1942) is not a film that cinephiles, film historians and fans of the great director would list as one of his best. Hitchcock himself did not consider it one of his best either and would make several criticisms about the final product. Despite this, the film did exceptionally well at the box office, which may reflect the mood of audiences in 1942 and the context of the film as well. Yet it is a film worth looking at and one whose thematic concerns are fascinating, at least to this reviewer. Indeed, the film’s thematic concerns are ones which Hitchcock himself would examine more than once, in some of his finest films. This article aims to not so much review Saboteur but rather look at those thematic concerns.\n\nThe story follows the character Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who is accused of starting a fire in a defense plant that kills his best friend. Despite his protestations of innocence, he is forced to go on the run, pursued by the police and the real saboteur, who is attempting to frame him for a series of attacks of sabotage across the United States. Along the way, Kane will seek refuge with a blind man who helps him, although his niece Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) initially aims to hand him to the police before becoming his ally. Both will evade capture and criss-cross the country, with Kane trying to clear himself and foil the Nazi conspiracy that is targeting American industry for the war effort. The film builds to a thrilling climax on the Statue of Liberty, where Kane confronts the true villain and clears his name. Overall, Saboteur is a classic example of Hitchcock’s mastery of suspense and storytelling.\n\nSaboteur is a product of its time; in that Hitchcock was making a film that had strong overtones of ‘patriotic propaganda’ as Robert Harris and Michael S. Lasky suggest out in their 2002 work The Complete Films Of Alfred Hitchcock. Both point out that it was his contribution to the ‘war effort’ but it was far beyond the usual fare that sold war bonds and boosted morale. The film tapped into the themes of loyalty to country and the need to defend America’s freedom and democracy, which resonated with audiences at the time. Saboteur also celebrates the American spirit of ingenuity and resourcefulness, as Barry Kane uses his wits and his skills to outsmart the saboteurs. While trapped in a basement, he triggers a fire alarm to get free. When Barry and Patricia are trying to evade the police, they end up at a circus. Barry improvises by putting on a clown costume and makeup in order to blend in with the performers and escape detection. Thus, it can also be described as an ‘American’ film, distinct from his prior work, as it reflects the nature of patriotic fervour that existed on the home front of wartime America. Hitchcock was also making his film in America, initially for David O. Selznick but eventually for Universal, and the leads were what Hitchcock had hoped would represent the ordinary American caught up in extraordinary circumstances. The main character’s journey takes him across America and its well-known cultural and historical landmarks; with the final landmark in the climax perhaps being the most significant and powerful in its symbolism. Nicholas Haeffner would describe Saboteur as a ‘picaresque thriller’; one which is ‘romantic’ in the original meaning of the term and Guy Cogveal adds that the theme of flight leads shapes the narrative into ballad form.\n\nWilliam Rothman quite accurately describes Saboteur as an American remake of The 39 Steps (1935) – and of course it’s here that an examination of the thematic concerns can begin. Like Richard Hannay, Barry Kane is the hero falsely accused and the lone, innocent man trying to prove his innocence against incredible odds. Unable to go to the police to clear himself, Kane is caught in the unenviable position that the only way to prove his innocence is to investigate and follow the trail of the actual villain. The cross-country chase becomes Kane’s odyssey and ordeal by fire, and as Haeffner illustrates must endure ‘a series of interlinked and colourful situations and episodes, confronting danger through various adversaries and life-threatening situations.’ Haeffner adds that Kane is like the ‘plucky and adventurous’ character following the tradition in the aforementioned The 39 Steps and Foreign Correspondent. Additionally, the character of Barry Kane is a further step in the development of what Cogveal describes as the ‘Hitchcockian hero’, that will finally crystalise in North By Northwest; a ‘rover’ escaping the clutches of the past, evading the police, society, or himself. Thus, the key theme sees ordinary people leading ordinary lives confronted with a political threat to their country and becoming actively involved in a struggle against fascism.\n\nHitchcock, as always, plays with his audience and inverts the concepts of trust and whom can be trusted. Again, like Hannay, Kane seeks help only to find he is in the hands of the very men seeking to destroy him. When tracing Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd) to the ranch of Charles Tobin (Otto Kruger), Kane discovers that Fry and Tobin are both saboteurs. An audience can find itself complacent in terms of the relationship of trust with the characters on the screen; feeling we know ‘the truth’ and yet being led up the garden path in the same way as the protagonist. In an interesting turn of events that parodies The Bride Of Frankenstein (1935), Kane seeks refuge with Phillip Martin (Vaughan Glazer), a blind man who believes in Kane’s innocence. Yet he faces danger again when Martin’s niece Patricia threatens to give him up. Barry manages to persuade her to believe his story by explaining the circumstances that led to his being falsely accused. He tells her that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time and that the real saboteur is still at large. They work together to uncover the real culprit behind the sabotage, and Barry’s persistence and resourcefulness in pursuing the truth begins to convince Patricia that he is indeed innocent. Additionally, as they spend more time together, Patricia begins to develop feelings for Barry, which also contributes to her growing trust in him. Here, there is an inversion of how the audience experiences trust and it also brings home the concept of the heroic loner; trying to prove their innocence whilst catching the actual villain. Of course, trust becomes an extremely rare and valuable commodity during wartime and in the context of World War Two, audiences would certainly have understood the problems with being too trusting, in the face of Nazi infiltration and sabotage.\n\nHitchcock’s ever-present desire to shock and exploit remains on display in Saboteur, to the point where the authorities had their misgivings about particular moments in the film. The best example of this is well-known to Hitchcock fans – the shot of the capsized Normandie – which was used in the film in a way that suggested sabotage. The U.S Navy were not happy with this, as the Normandie had suffered an accidental fire, not sabotage, as inferred in the film. As a result, the shot was edited out in some parts of the U.S, which is understandable given that it was wartime, and the fears of sabotage were very real. Hitchcock claimed, ‘it just happened to be there’ and it wasn’t planned but this reviewer casts doubts on this claim. There are brilliant moments of wry humour that appear to be Hitchcockian but probably owe more to the great writer Dorothy Parker, who was brought in to assist with the script. During the circus sequence, the Siamese twins argue over whether to help our hero, and at one point refuse to talk to each other. There’s even a discussion over insomnia between the two!\n\nHaeffner also makes the interesting observation that Hitchcock often uses a fascinating cinematic tool, ‘where art and life become interwoven as the barrier between spectacle and spectatorship is breached’. It is also a key theme that in in the DNA of Hitchcock’s films; the unexpected occurring in the least expected places and moments of one’s life. Before the stunning climax, Fry is chased into a cinema where he attempts to get away by running across the screen, appearing as a small silhouette with a gun in his hand. In the next instance a gun is fired onscreen just as the saboteur fires into the audience, killing a man who slumps into his wife’s lap. She assumes he’s laughing with the rest of the audience but when discovering he’s dead, she lets out a loud scream which sets the audience into a panic. The film continues to echo the real-life situation. The cuckolded husband on the screen says ‘Get out before I shoot you’, as audience members run out of the cinema. This confusion and discombobulation of reality and imagination is unsettling and, in this situation, horrific, yet it touches on Hitchcock’s own take on suspense and the building of tension:\n\n‘We cannot experience sufficient thrills at first hand. Therefore, to prevent ourselves becoming sluggish and jellified, we must experience them artificially. The screen is the best medium for this’.\n\nPerhaps the most celebrated moment in the film is the aforementioned exciting climax, which would later be replicated in North By Northwest and certainly uses symbolism to deliver one of the central themes of the film. Barry Kane pursues Fry to Bedloe Island, where Fry ironically hides inside the Statue of Liberty. The pursuit sees Fry fall from the platform on Lady Liberty’s torch, desperately hanging onto the statue’s hand. Kane’s attempts to save Fry will be in vain, as the Nazi saboteur plummets to his doom. It takes little to see the importance of the scene and the significance, particularly in 1942, of Hitchcock’s use of The Statue Of Liberty in the film’s climax. As a symbol of freedom and the values of democracy, this would have powerfully resonated with audiences in 1942. The irony of a Nazi desperately holding onto the hand of liberty to be saved becomes heightened by Kane’s efforts to save him as well. Hitchcock may have been making his ‘patriotic picture’ but the themes of loyalty to country and fighting against tyranny were more than tokenistic.\n\nSaboteur may not be one of Alfred Hitchcock’s greatest films standing alongside North By Northwest, Rear Window, Psycho and Vertigo. Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane were not Hitchcock’s choices and were ‘forced on him’ by the studio and Hitchcock would not speak fondly of the film. Yet, it’s a tense and highly dramatic thriller that still excites an audience.\n\nThis article is written for The 2023 Master Of Suspense Blogathon run by Maddy at Classic Film And TV Corner.

The need to see into the future and plan for it is one reflected in countless cultures, in some cases so inherently that it can shape and become deeply embedded and entrenched in the values and beliefs within that society or culture. Our fascination of visions of the future emerges in film, art and literature. Whole genres, such as science-fiction, are centred on future worlds, making the fantastic real and the impossible believable. These stories, as visions of the future, fascinate as well as entertain us and filmmakers know there exists something deep in the human experience and psyche that has us tapping into the possibilities of the future, seeking answers that explain not only where we are headed but even answers to why we have arrived at where we are.\n\nFritz Lang’s masterpiece Metropolis has a reputation which precedes it, and it has been long described as one of cinema’s most influential films. As K. Johnson outlines in his work Science Fiction Film: A Critical Introduction (2011), Metropolis is often ‘telescoped into the traditional, albeit brief canon’ of what are considered early science fiction films. Paul Meehan’s Tech Noir (2008) states that Lang created the ‘first tech-noir city of the future…’. Certainly, it has inspired several auteurs across styles and genres in shaping and capturing visions of the future, appropriating motifs and symbols, as well as investigating similar thematic concerns. Metropolis is certainly an important Modernist film and film historian David Golding has written at length on this as well. This article does not seek to make comment on the wisdom or lack thereof regarding this argument. Instead, it aims to looks at how Metropolis is a vision of the future, or at least uses a vision of the future to examine and comment on the divisions that exist in humanity and how they can be overcome.\n\nLang’s vision of the future is one where the city is dominant. He presents the audience with a dystopia that delves into the ancient past as well to create his vision of a possible future. At first, the audience is dazzled by the sheer grandeur and spectacle of the city, in a future that looks incredible and unbelievable. But this grandeur reflected through a dazzling prism is only kept alive through the pulsing of the Heart Machine; represented by the driving camshafts and flywheels. Without this incredible technology, the city would collapse. Of course, the concept of a beating heart keeping the whole of the body alive becomes more than superficial imagery; it becomes Lang’s central thematic concern.\n\nThe world of Metropolis is one of deep class division – of a small, ruling class whose power and privilege exists by maintaining the oppression and exploitation of the working masses. The famous opening scene of oppressed workers miserably walking in step to and from their long, punishing shifts like lifeless automatons is a bleak contrast to the playground where the sons of the ruling class play and enjoy their time with an array of women chosen for their pleasure. The disconnect is clear and the vision of a future where humans are but cogs in the machine will be reflected in later films such as Chaplin’s Modern Times. Yet the impacts of Futurism on Lang are also on display, with the sheer size, dynamism and opulence of the city dwarfing humanity. Like the ziggurats of Ur, the pyramids and temples of Egypt and the grandness of Rome, Metropolis is a city that dominates humanity. The master of Metropolis, Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel), has reduced the masses to mechanical parts that can be used and discarded without concern; they are subjects to his whims and his designs. All that matters is that the city is sustained. Fredersen oversees his city, in the same way that pharaohs and kings ruled their people; from a distance. Whilst a Marxist interpretation of Metropolis would suggest the obvious, Lang goes further in his vision of the future. Likewise, the city plays a key motif in Modernism – whilst we are amazed and in awe of the sheer size of the city and its many dimensions, we are also appalled and repelled.\n\nLang looks to examine the disconnect that exists between those who rule and those who are ruled, and the answer to bridging that chasm. Lang uses character to pursue that quest in the form of Fredersen’s son, Freder (Gustav Frohlich) who begins to discover what the workers and their families are enduring; challenging the status quo and questioning why this is so. His early meeting with Maria (Brigitte Helm) is a harbinger for what will follow, as they connect from that first moment. Freder senses there is something special about her, aided for the audience by Lang’s camera work, as well as foreshadowing that Maria will provide the answer to the question that Lang poses. Later, Freder has a vision of the great machine as the temple of Moloch devouring the people, feeding off their suffering and sustaining itself by consuming its own citizens. Freder’s sense of empathy and consciousness is further aroused after he witnesses a terrible explosion. The irony that Freder is a beneficiary of this oppressive and exploitive system is not lost on him, and that strong empathy becomes particularly heightened after he secretly trades places with an exhausted worker. Combined with his disgust at his father’s indifference to the workers’ suffering, Freder rebels and follows his own heart to a secret meeting of the workers where he again sees Maria.\n\nOf course, the very sense of ‘brotherhood’ and love that Maria espouses to her flock seems to be lost on not only the rulers of Metropolis but the workers as well. All that matters to the elite is the maintenance of the power they wield and enjoy, regardless of the cost to the masses. Likewise, the workers seem accepting of their position, albeit suffering in that oppressive state with little hope of change or succour. Yet there is an innate desire and hunger for hope and the workers come to listen to her message. Maria’s message provides hope for the workers but even more markedly the freedom she speaks of is for the rulers of the city as well. Instead of talking revolution and the overthrow of the system, Maria’s message is that all the inhabitants of Metropolis are ‘brothers’, only needing a mediator to bring them together. Frederson is also a prisoner of the disconnect. Despite the seeming impossibility of this message, it is enough to cause concern for the rulers of the city.\n\nThis reviewer senses an almost Rousseauian dialectic running parallel to a Marxist interpretation of the film. The stark division between the powerful and those subject to that power, according to Lang, comes into existence when humans begin building cities and ‘civilisation’ begins to grow and flourish. Progress and modernisation certainly benefit some, who flourish and enjoy the fruits of civilisation, and find themselves subjecting their fellow humans to oppression and hard labour, in order to continue enjoying that power. Yet the price paid is a loss of morality along with a loss of the connection to nature and their fellow humans. The powerful irony is apparent in the opening scenes, where the audience first sees Freder in the miracle of the Eternal Gardens, a place of natural beauty which has been artificially constructed far from the cold and impersonal concrete and steel that the masses exist in. The distance from what should be natural is made clear by the dominance of the city.\n\nOf course, the physical city itself is one of the most important and powerful images in film and one which has shaped visions of the future from 1930s serials like Flash Gordon to Ridley Scott’s Bladerunner (1982). The imposing home of Fredersen is like a ziggurat from the ancient city of Ur and the surrounding skyscrapers and bridges are certainly inspired by the imagery of Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand’s ‘Manhatta’ (1921). As Meehan points out, Lang would also be inspired by his visit to the U.S and viewing the city of New York at night. The images of the city of Metropolis find an emotional response from the audience in awe and terror. However, it also exemplifies the deep detachment and savage impersonality of the city – particularly when the masses who serve the city live underneath it in terrible conditions. These experiences, of course, are not imaginary – they reflect the painful and traumatic reality of the Industrial Revolution of the 18th to 19th centuries where millions were uprooted from their agrarian lives to become the new working class in urban nightmares. Lang uses these images to make clear that this disconnect is as much a physical barrier as well as a socio-economic and psychological one. Despite the incredible technological advancements in the city, how can the masses overcome this servitude and slavery and find their liberation? Is this a future where humans are slaves to machines or one where humans use the machines to enslave fellow humans? It is a question ever pertinent to us as we navigate a world of AI, exponential technology, and questions about what this mean for the future.\n\nLang’s powerful message is that the heart must be the ‘mediator’ to bridge the chasm between both the ruled and ruler. Personified by Maria, she becomes the Messiah-like messenger and vessel for the workers’ liberation through love and peace not violence and revolution. Likewise, she makes clear to the workers that their rich rulers are their ‘brothers’. Freder’s love for Maria and belief in her message sees him declaring that he could be that mediator. Yet despite her tale of the Tower of Babel (again a foreshadowing of the change to come through a powerful Biblical allusion) the workers will not heed the importance of this tale when the time comes. There is a particularly interesting turn on the allusion of Babel, of course – with the fall of the Tower of Babel, leaving humanity divided by language and thus unable to communicate. Alternatively, Metropolis sees humanity divided and unable to communicate via the building of its own massive structures. K. Johnson’s points out that the city of Metropolis is one which ‘relegates humanity to a secondary attraction…’. Visually, the set design, models and optical illusions create a vision of the future that dazzles the audience and achieves that very relegation of humanity to secondary importance. Hence, Lang defines a vision of the future where humans do lose themselves and thus lose their connection to each other. Again, the great city is what matters. But its façade of splendour, greatness and futuristic grandeur hides an unpleasant underworld of teeming masses transformed by industrialisation into cogs of the machine. The imagery of the steam whistle and the giant clock symbolise order and control – both ordered by machines. Michael Wedel’s own reflections on Lang draw on Tom Gunning’s work on Lang’s film; both of which see a recurrent motif in Lang’s films of a ‘destiny machine’. Here, Lang’s cinematic world is determined by symbols such as a clock or hourglass which highlight that control over the characters and their narrative. In one scene, Freder disguises himself as a worker to take on the menial, mind-numbing and exhaustive task of moving hands around a dial of flashing lights and numbers. Freder is eventually driven to near madness, and it becomes an allegory of the mind-numbing enslavement and experiences of the masses in an urban world of mass production. The freedom of the masses to pursue their own dreams, goal and happiness is subservient to the needs of the city – instead their existence and very pulse of that existence is determined by the sheer mundanity of a clock. There is a supreme and non-natural abnormality in such an existence that Lang alludes to.\n\nMaria’s doppelganger will be the antithesis of love and bring a message of violence and annihilation, as well as overt sexuality, that will lead the city to its near destruction. Desperate to drive his son Freder away from Maria and back to where he belongs, Fredersen goes to Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), an inventor whose appearance certainly has inspired the concept of the mad scientist. Rotwang shows his artificial creation – a robot like homunculus that will be given Maria’s likeness and destroy Maria’s influence on the workers. However, Rotwang has other plans that will go much further. His aim is to see the city destroyed and Fredersen along with it. Herein lies the irony; the near downfall and bringer of violence and hate is not a man possessed by evil, but a robot shaped by a man. Indeed, the robot created by Rotwang is not simply a technological achievement commensurate with the age; it is animated by sorcery and the dark arts from a distant past. Rotwang’s strange, old-twisted house is alien to the titanic skyscrapers of Metropolis. The five-pointed star hints at Rotwang’s use of satanic powers and a desire for destruction. The Medieval house of Rotwang, the ancient catacombs and even the ‘coming to life’ sequences of the Seven Deadly Sins in the old cathedral suggests that the answers to the struggles of humanity lie as much in the past as they do in this vision of the future. Additionally, the robot now transformed into the ‘evil’ Maria taps into the darker side of humanity, evoking lust and violence in men. The infamous erotic dance scene in the men’s club taps with leering and panting men certainly seems ridiculous by today’s standards and taps into the age-old sexist notion that female sexuality is dangerous, with men falling victim to these proto-femme fatales. Eventually, the ‘evil’ Maria will attempt far worse (whilst the real Maria is kept prisoner) and encourage violence and further division.\n\nTom Gunning’s outstanding book on Lang’s films certainly sees Metropolis as an allegory of the future; one which sees the ‘triumph of the machine’. This is certainly reflected in Freder’s vision of the machines as Moloch, the reduction of the workers into robotic automatons that are slaves to the machines and of course the iconic robot that transforms into the ‘evil’ Maria. However, Gunning provides a powerful insight into Lang’s vision of the future via his use of the story of Babel. One of the oldest tropes of the human story was shaped with the emergence of the city-state in ancient times – the workers are the hands, and the rulers are the brains of the city. The great rulers and builders of these cities believe in their ‘noble cause’ but lose themselves in this cause, and thus also lose connection and empathy with those doing the building. Likewise, those whose labour are used to build the city do not know or understand what the rulers are trying to do; all they know is the pain and suffering of their experience. Writer Dietrich Neumann likewise sees Lang’s city ‘a complex and compelling metaphor…as a being, whose individual but interdependent spaces – the skyscrapers, machine halls, and catacombs – fulfilled a body’s function as its heart, hands, and mind’. The near collapse of the city is due to the terrible truth of the very disconnect which keeps it alive – the exploitation of the masses. Thus, the disconnect – one which is more amplified than ever in Lang’s vision of the future.\n\nOf course, one of the oft repeated retrospective discussions about films which depict visions of the future is whether they got any of it right. Likewise, defining such films as Metropolis as ‘warnings about the future’ fall into the same category for this reviewer. Whilst this may be interesting at one level, too great a focus on this will mean we can miss the point of the film. As a vision of the future, Metropolis is also fascinating as a revelation of what perceptions of the future were at that time that may still ring true today. The Germany of the 1920s was a nation in a state of flux. It was trying to get off its knees after the defeat of WW 1 and dealing with its impacts, cradling a new-born democracy whilst the forces of the extremes of the political spectrum wanted to see it killed and seeking an identity in these new conditions. It was also a time when Lang and other German (and European directors) were at the forefront of cinema, creating new ways of storytelling on film. As Gunning states, one of the big discussions in Weimar Germany and in Europe as well was the nature of technology, its impact on humans and the connection to political power. Yet it was a fascinating time as well, with the flourishing of culture and new ideas. The huge growth in the American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, exemplified by cities like New York (far more modern than their European counterpart) is obvious in the glass and steel of the buildings in Metropolis. Likewise, New York also had teeming masses working in large factories and living in slums whilst the rich and powerful enjoyed the fruits of their success. What Lang would comment on was the alienation and disconnect that humans suffered in these great cities; a key concern in Modernism and one to be found in Metropolis. Richard Murphy in Modernism and The Cinema(2007) points out that these ideas are significantly present in Weimar cinema and German Expressionism, reflecting instability and uncertainty that existed in the inter-war period. (Incidentally, it was also a key motif and theme to be found in film noir, where Lang would also make his mark). It was in these conditions that Lang examined his concerns about humanity itself, not whether we’ll be traveling by planes around skyscrapers or whether the masses will be living in a subterranean hell. Ultimately, Lang also investigates our past to create his vision of the future. As this article has discussed, our perceptions of the future are linked to visions of the past and the depths and parameters of the human experience that link that past to the future. For Lang, despite the overtones of a Marxist dialectic that sees history as conflict, there is the hope for the bridging of distance within humanity through the power of the heart.\n\nThis article is written for Futurethon Blog event run by Gil at RealWeegieMidget Reviews and Barry at Cinema Catharsis.

In a modern, ordered and civilised world, that justice is processed through a legal system. In film noir, murder is a normal part of its dark and twisted world. In film noir, business partnerships aren’t dissolved by being bought out or through a legal process. Lovers or spouses don’t break up or get sent a ‘Dear John’ letter. People cheated out of money don’t get a visit from the police or face a civil suit. Those who have transgressed in any way are not dealt with in the usual ways. In the world of film noir, all are dealt with using a .38.\n\nIn the pantheon of film noir, murder is an ever-present trope because it is the ultimate crime. The characters who walk the streets of the film noir universe know it is present and even expect it to come their way. Having written previously on Death As Redemption In Film Noir, there are those who even welcome murder as a reprieve from the pains and sufferings of the world, or in particular as justice for their own indiscretions and crimes. The aptly named The Killers (1946) is a perfect example of the ever-presence of murder as a trope in film noir. Murder is the key tool used by professional hitmen, with their initial target Ole Anderson (Burt Lancaster), the key target. Interestingly, Anderson, after becoming aware that two professional hitmen are seeking him out, makes no attempt to escape or dodge his fate. He accepts what is going to come and acknowledges that his death is a form of redemption, and that murder is par for the course of a life of crime.\n\nTo describe murder in film noir as an occupational hazard, sounds like an understatement as well as a cliché. Yet it is not only an occupational hazard but a tool of the trade for the gangsters, hoodlums and killers that stalk the streets, occupy the cheap bars and hide in shadowy alleys in the world of film noir. The quintessential heist film and a sterling film which exemplifies this is John Huston’s The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Focused on a diamond robbery put together by ‘Doc’ Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe), violence is an integral part of the preparation for the heist. Doc recognises that the need for a hoodlum willing to commit violence is as integral as a reliable wheelman and a top-notch safe cracker. Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) is the man they need and whilst not a killer, he is a man that will use violence where necessary. Complications with the heist and a double-cross from the heist’s financial backer, corrupt lawyer, Alonzo D. Emmerich (Louis Calhern), sees that violence become a necessity. Whilst not strictly cold-blooded murder, Dix shoots and kills Bob Brannom (Brad Dexter) during the double-cross. It is a situation where the threat of murder is part of the business bargaining and an underlying reality to the dealings in the criminal world.\n\nThe same threat of menace and danger which pre-empts murder and death is as present for those working the legal side of the fence. This is especially evident in Anthony Mann’s T-Men (1947). The threat of murder is forever present as two U.S Treasury agents go undercover to infiltrate and bring down a counterfeit gang. In one particularly brutal scene, Moxy disposes of one of the gangsters by cooking him alive in a steam-room. It certainly gives new meaning to turning up the heat. With its brilliant use of deep black and stark lighting, the oppressive sense of violence is heightened and the sense of panic and terror likewise in the moments before death. To protect their business interests, murder is a powerful tool and one which in the world of film noir could be visited upon anyone. Likewise, the private detective, the knight in dented armour, is also more than aware that murder is a reality in his or her world. They certainly spend a great deal of their time investigating it and likewise avoiding it. The ‘gumshoe’ or ‘shamus’ walks a difficult line; they seek truth and justice yet are not part of the police. At times, they drift into illegalities and do not have the legal protections that are afforded the authorities. Indeed, they often annoy and irritate the authorities who see them as obstacles. As evident in The Maltese Falcon (1941) and Murder, My Sweet (1944), the dangers of murder are always around the corner. To avoid it, they work by their wits and experience.\n\nBut murder in film noir is not merely an occupational hazard, it becomes a way of solving problems and removing obstacles. In John Stahl’s brilliant Leave Her To Heaven (1945), writer Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde) marries socialite Ellen (Gene Tierney). Her obsessive and jealous nature is at first passed off by Richard as simply a love that is too strong. However, Ellen looks for ways in which she can isolate Richard from anyone she sees as a threat, including his family. In one of the most horrific scenes on film, Ellen encourages Richard’s younger, crippled brother Danny (Darryl Hickman) to swim deeper into the nearby lake, as she follows him in a rowboat. She watches as he struggles and lets him drown as he begs for help. Passed off as an accident, Ellen initially seems to have gotten away with murder and she has managed to remove what she deems to be an obstacle in her path to have all of Danny’s love and devotion. In Sorry, Wrong Number (1948), Henry J. Stephenson (Burt Lancaster) arranges the murder of his wife Leona (Barbara Stanwyck) to pay off his debts to gangsters. Stephenson sees murder as the only way to solving his problems and getting out of the mess that he has created. Likewise, in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity (1944), insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) sees murder as the only way to extricate himself and ‘get off the trolley car’, from the mess he has gotten himself into; ironically after himself committing murder for femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). He will finally realise that Phyllis intends to use murder to get rid of him as well. After all, he is not only a liability to her but he is no longer of any use to her.\n\nWhich brings us to the femme fatale, perhaps one of the most recognised characters in film noir. We’ve already had a brief look at two and it’s already noted that murder is a modus operandi for the femme fatale. Either they are murderers themselves or entice and seduce others to commit murder for them; whatever the reason. Two of the finest examples of the femme fatale are present in two films that this writer feels are two of the best example of film noir, particularly from the 1940s: Double Indemnity (1944) and Out Of The Past (1947). In Double Indemnity, the aforementioned Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) is a cold and despicable femme fatale. As Walter Neff discovers, Phyllis uses murder in numerous ways, either enticing others (like himself) to kill or to commit murder herself. In Out Of The Past (1947), Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) is likewise a cold and despicable woman, who betrays the men in her life. Murder is also an MO for Kathie, and she has no problem using murder to get her way, let alone throwing someone under the bus to save her skin. In. both cases, the fatal mistake that men make is that they fall in love (or lust, to be more cynical). Neff is dazzled at first sight and through a fatalist lens declares that he knew he would fall further for her. Indeed, Neff will suggest that he never knew ‘that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle’. The beauty, warmth and scent of the Spanish-style Dietrichson home on the outside hides the moribund, dusty and mundane interior. Phyllis, likewise, is beautiful on the outside but dead with corruption on the inside. Likewise, Jeff (Robert Mitchum) falls in love with Kathie and can understand why Whit (Kirk Douglas) does as well, even forgiving her double-crossing: ‘And then I saw her, coming out of the sun, and I knew why Whit didn’t care about that 40 grand’. It is the perfect line to describe the allure of the femme fatale, and how she can secure a man to commit murder for her.\n\nAs part of the audience, we all shake our heads in disbelief that these people would think that murder would get them out of trouble. It’s easy to ask the question – what makes them think they will get away with it? Yet the answer is clear. They all think they can buck the system and that they will not get caught. No-one, including the audience after leaving the theatre (or in this new brave world, turning off the wide-screen smart TV) can say that they have not fantasised about beating the system, breaking a mundane and boring life or ached to fulfil a desire that we know we cannot fulfil. The difference of course is that in the real world, the audience (mostly) is driven by values, morals, ethics, laws, fears etc to keep the law and steer the course of ‘normal’, mundane lives. In film noir, the audience seems characters make an ‘existential choice’, as Robert Porfirio suggests where the mundane is rejected for authenticity and that means freedom embodied in ‘sex, money, power and the promise of adventure’. However, as the characters in film noir discover, the attainment of these things stepping into the darkness and that often means murder. After all, in the world of film noir, murder and death are the norms.\n\nThis article is a proud entry into the CMBA Fall 2022 Blogathon – Movies Are Murder.

It’s my only weakness.”– Horace Femm (Ernest Thesiger)\n\nA howling storm, the terror of the night and a decrepit and eerie mansion hiding in the shadows, with who knows what inside its ancient walls. Such is the stuff of nightmares, dark fairy tales and one of the silver screen’s most fascinating films from the classic horror cycle of the early 1930s. Based on J. B. Priestley’s 1927 novel ‘Benighted’, The Old Dark House, directed by the legendary James Whales in 1932, remains a fascinating and interesting film, not only because it’s a ‘classic horror’ film but particularly due to its eccentricities, dark humour and very talented and exceptional cast.\n\nWhilst not exactly ‘lost’, The Old Dark House would disappear for some years and be somewhat forgotten, with other films from the Universal canon of classic horror given greater attention and accolades. The film had mixed reviews upon its initial release and Universal saw no advantage in pushing it further. Indeed, the copyright would lapse with William Castle initiating a remake. Like other lost films, particularly in the horror genre, The Old Dark House did find itself elevated to near-legendary status as a lost classic and sought after by aficionados and cinephiles. The proliferation of monster magazines, the rediscovery of classic film on television in the 1950s and 1960s and the interest in Karloff himself certainly helped to raise interest. However, it took the work of James Whale protégé, Curtis Harrington, to rediscover the negative and have it printed. As a result, this gothic horror classic flickered on the screen once more.\n\nHowever, The Old Dark House is also an eccentricity from start to finish. It is a film where Whale’s unconventional sense of humour prevails (and this has been discussed at length ad nauseum). Yet it is worth nothing that it does not meet the expectations of a run-of-the-mill ‘horror film’. It traverses a range of themes and ideas, which one would not normally associate with horror. The audience discovers this from the opening scenes with a wild storm occurring in the Welsh hills. Philip Waverton (Raymond Massey) and his wife, Margaret (Gloria Stuart) argue over the direction they are supposed to be taking as they drive through the howling darkness. In the back seat, seemingly unperturbed is the suave and debonair Roger Penderel (Melvyn Douglas) whose humour and lack of concern seems to bother Margaret particularly. Behind Penderel’s quips, wit and relaxed demeanour, however, is a cynical ‘forgotten man’ from that ‘lost generation’ who returned from World War One. Whilst Penderel verbally parries and fences playfully with his friends, his disillusionment and cynicism is often revealed, at times by his own admission. Douglas is quite apt at giving layers to Penderel and such disillusionment would have been quite understood and familiar to audiences of the day – perhaps all too familiar with the ‘forgotten man’. Penderel is correct in describing himself as the ‘man with the twisted smile’.\n\nOf course, the story shifts into the bizarre when the storm-soaked threesome seek shelter in the Femm house. The large, looming house in the shadows of the storm seems gruesome enough but they are greeted at the door by a scarred and spine-chilling face, who turns out to be the butler, Morgan (Boris Karloff). The slow reveal of Morgan’s face is chilling and is suggestive of what is to come. The leering, brutish and grunting Morgan is strange enough until the travellers are greeted by Horace Femm (Ernest Thesiger) whose skittish nervousness is coupled with a strange fondness for his ‘guests’. Far stranger is Horace’s God-fearing and salty sister Rebecca (Eva Moore), whose piercing cries of ‘they can’t have beds’ firmly suggests her attitude towards these interlopers.\n\nThat our shelter-seeking travellers are in a strange and conflicted house becomes evident. The audience discovers early that the house is one deeply entrenched with religious fervour on the one hand and atheism on the other. Horace is terrified that the storm will wash away the house and his fears are mocked and condemned by Rebecca for his disbelief in God and blasphemies. Rebecca evidently is unafraid as the house is ‘built on rock’ and she has her unaffected faith in God. Rebecca is not an old and slightly deaf woman – she’s also a religious fanatic who is unhinged and holds great power. When Horace orders Morgan to attend to the fire, he defers to Rebecca who gives him a quiet nod. Later when Horace mocks Rebecca’s giving thanks ‘to her gods’ before dinner, she silences him and he meekly sits with bowed head. Indeed, Horace himself introduces Rebecca as the head of the house. This God-fearing woman seems assured in her strength, exhibiting a silent power in the household.\n\nHowever, Rebecca’s religious fervour is underpinned by a complexity of layers. Rebecca’s frustration and deep running envies are revealed when she tells of her beautiful yet ‘godless’ sister who was chased by men and revelled in sin. Twisted and distorted images of Rebecca leave the audience even more uncomfortable yet they also reveal that the other side of Rebecca’s disapproval is a deeply hidden obsession. As Margaret strips off her wet clothes, Rebecca comments on her ‘fine stuff’ which will ‘rot too, in time’. There is a bitterness that Rebecca’s own long-repressed sexuality has also been long dead and re-defined by condemning those who enjoy sex. Margaret’s slim, white body re-awakens Rebecca’s own desires, and provides fuel for her religious fanaticism and frustrations at the same time.\n\nYet this repression is evident in a house gone rotten with madness and it finds expression in bizarre and indeed criminal ways. Morgan’s intentions for Margaret are quite clear which later emerge when he is ‘quite drunk’. His attempts to rape her are only thwarted, firstly by the intervention of her husband and finally by the tragedy unfolding in the film’s climax. The Femm household is one barely held together and seems to be constantly at odds with itself. Yet as Rebecca and later the feeble Sir Roderic Femm (played interestingly by ‘John Dudgeon’ aka Elspeth Dudgeon) declare, the house was one previously charged with sex and activity. It will also be Sir John who reveals that there is another Femm in the household who is the maddest and most dangerous of all, so much so that they need to lock him up which is why the Femms keep Morgan. The introduction of the eldest son, Saul (Brember Wills) will eventually shift the story into something more terrifying, as all we wants to do is destroy and kill. Saul, too, will use biblical allusions and his very name speaks volumes about his character as well.\n\nClass, status and the challenges to both thematically emerge in the film; all of which are looked at in great depth in Priestley’s book. The Femm household itself is from landed gentry but one fallen into decrepit near-collapse – perhaps a symbol of the old world of landowners and nobility finally seeing its demise. In its place has emerged a new, modern world born out of the industrial revolution and run by a new, ambitious business class. The loud, boisterous Sir William Porterhouse (Charles Laughton) has bought his title, yet does not (nor cannot) hide his origins nor his bitterness towards the upper class who still look down their noses at him. He cannot hide his thick Yorkshire accent nor does he have the manners and upbringing to match his bought title. Likewise Gladys (Lillian Bond) is a chorus girl, who as Sir William’s ‘companion’ is obviously with him for survival not for love. Horace Femm sniffs at the irony of her comments on taste and Rebecca Femm casts an equally dismal eye on Gladys. Yet she is honest and without airs, which Penderel admires and which will eventually see him fall for her. The middle-class Wavertons are also in this mix, which in total makes for a film with great focus on character.\n\nAll are caught in this strange and dismal house with far darker secrets existing upstairs; so dark that Horace does not want to venture upstairs. He finds all manner of excuses to avoid getting a lamp when the lights go out. He ends up locking himself in his room, leaving all the guests to their own fate. Even Rebecca fears what is upstairs, which is why they keep Morgan there as protection. Yet Morgan becomes as much a danger when he gets drunk and therefore out of control – and Rebecca cannot control him in his drunken state. Like her brother Horace, Rebecca locks herself in her room, after the warning she gives to the women goes unheeded. Without any of the Femms present and Morgan drunk and out of control, the house has become a dangerous place. Morgan will go even further and unlock the door at the top of the last flight of stairs, releasing the eldest brother, Saul. Saul’s arrival in the plot arrives after a slow build up of tension and from this point the suspense starts to take hold and the secrets of the old, dark house are revealed.\n\nAs previously mentioned, The Old Dark House is an odd film for a ‘horror film’. It certainly has all the hallmarks of a Gothic horror film, with a wild storm, a strange household steeped in madness and a chilling figure in the shape of Morgan. One feels the slow-burn while watching the first half of the film, and even amused at the dinner scene, where the audience experiences more of the aforementioned eccentricities of Whale’s humour. Indeed, the after dinner gathering around the fireplace allows the audience to discover more about the characters as well. As Kevin Maher points out, it feels like a drawing room farce. But despite all this, there are still plenty of frights for the guests in the benighted household and even some fairly shocking violence such as Phillips Waverton’s use of a lamp to stop Morgan assaulting his wife. The film drifts into the bizarre with the strange meeting with the terribly old Sir John in his bed and of course the climax of the film which sees Saul let loose on the guests.\n\nThe film is well-shot and Arthur Edeson’s camera work helps create the spooky atmosphere. The clever use of light and shadow, as well as distorted images and strange cross-cutting induces the fear and confusion of being in such a strange house. It’s not strictly a ‘haunted old house’ story but there are one or two stylistic throwbacks to Universal’s The Cat And The Canary (1927) such as the long corridor with open windows and billowing curtains or even the plot device of a lunatic let loose in the house. The use of diegetic sound such as the howling wind, the thunder and the rain is also effective in adding to the spooky atmosphere. The casting works and the contrast between the Femms and their guests is quite marked. Whale’s choice for a near-full British cast is interesting and according to Gloria Stuart saw some preferential treatment from Whale towards the British expats. Stuart stated that Whale always provided tea and crumpets for morning and afternoon tea but only the British cast was invited. Stuart and Melvyn Douglas were left to themselves but it did mean a friendship was born out of their isolation.\n\nKarloff’s casting came soon after his legendary and career-breaking role as It is well-known that Whale was cold towards Karloff and this was evident on the set of The Old Dark House according to Stuart who reported Whale calling him an ‘old truck-driver’. Karloff, of course, was always kind and courteous and gave his best in his strange role as the silent, lumbering butler. Karloff’s particularly emotional moment after the climax is particularly poignant, if not in complete contrast to the rest of his performance. It uncannily harkens to Ilya Repin’s 1851 painting of Ivan The Terrible And His Son with great effect. Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian feels that the film is delivered with tremendous gusto and theatrical dash, and this review couldn’t agree more.\n\nDespite an unevenness in the story, The Old Dark House is still worth watching and works as a chiller. It has suffered from some poor prints but the digital clean-up finally offers a superior opportunity to enjoy the film. There are quite a number of ‘old dark house’ films out there from the minor and Poverty Row studios which seek to mimic what happens in Whale’s film but they remain distant and forgettable in comparison. The Old Dark House remains worthy of the canon of film from the 1931 – 1935 golden age of classic horror. It has none of the supernatural elements that are present in Dracula, Frankenstein or The Mummy. Nor does it have the shape-shifting characteristics of The Invisible Man or Dr. Jekyll And Mr Hyde. However, it combines Gothic tropes with the eccentricity, humour and originality of James Whale, as well as a beautifully shot film with performances from a top notch cast. It’s thoroughly enjoyable and you’ll find yourself caught in the same predicament as the wary travellers stuck with a family of mad people in an old, dark house on a wild, stormy night.\n\nPaul Batters teaches secondary school History in the Illawarra region and also lectures at the University Of Wollongong.

Far be it for me to reveal more, so please visit Theresa’s page to read her work!\n\nGill at Realweegiemidget Reviews\n\nThe Medusa Touch (1978)\n\nWhen it comes to classic horror films I’m a 1970s kid at heart. Give me The Medusa Touch (1978) over any new horror film any day. Not only was it one of the first horror films I’ve ever seen and lovef but it is at times the most unintentionally amusing…\n\nThis film was one of many movies in the seventies which centered on the supernatural. It has a powerful performance from Richard Burton in the lead and I would argue a role he was born for.\n\nIt tells the story of John Morlar, a man haunted by his deadly gift for telekinesis. It also stars Lee Remick as a psychiatrist who aims to help him… As Morlar reminiscences about those people he’s killed including his parents, his nanny and more… and with more chilling scenes seen as he shows this psychiatrist his deadly talents…\n\nThere are treats for all Burton fans with both monologues and flowery speeches from Burton These are delivered in the way only he can so if you want to see Burton in a seventies horror, throw Exorcist II The Heretic (1977) to the side, and watch his moving performance…\n\nSean Batman, author of Sons Of The Shire and the upcoming Retro Ray\n\nPsycho (1960)\n\nIn the dimly lit one-bedroom apartment, I am white-knuckled, clutching at a recently knit crochet blanket. I have in moments considered pulling it over my eyes, especially as the knife plummets down again and again into a woman in the shower. But strangely, in those same moments, I cannot tear my eyes away. And that is the power of the film playing on the small television…\n\nThis was a ritual of sorts. My parents would drop my younger sister and me with my Grandmother, who was by far the greatest babysitter I ever had. Nan would feed us lollies and ice-cream and then she would put on Bill Collins and we would watch a classic film. Tonight’s screening was Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho. I was nine years old. Having watched the Universal Monster movies and some Hammer Horror films, I felt certain that anything black and white would be easy viewing. I was wrong. The slow-burn narrative, the ominous soundtrack, the old house on the hill and Nan’s frequent whispers about Hitchcock’s cinematography were life-changing. I’d never seen a film like it and only years later, watching John Carpenter’s Halloween, would I feel the same sense of dread.\n\nStill to this day, my memories of the apartment, doused in shadows and light, the unnerving plot twist – Norman Bates – both Mother and Son, smirking, knowing he will stay with me forever.\n\nJeffrey Jiraffe Simons – On Twitter @math4humans\n\nAlien (1979)\n\nMy parents divorced when I was very young. My mom met my stepfather when I was 8. They went on a weekend getaway, so all the kids were given to family or neighbors for the weekend. My neighbor worked at the local drive-in and she sat me in the cab of her truck parked next to the concession stand and said, “Lock the doors, come get me if you have any problem”.\n\nThe movie? Alien. I was barely 10. Talk about trauma lol but here is what I remember vividly.\n\nI was both horrified and paralyzed with fear, but utterly fascinated and engrossed with the plot, the tension, and the characters. Great introduction to my lifelong love of the horror genre and I didn’t leave that truck once. I was almost literally glued to my seat.\n\nRobert Short – Writer & contributor to the Warner Bros – First National Pictures 1923 – 1960 FB Page\n\nA CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE BEST KIND – My Initial Experience with Horror: Dracula (1931)\n\n“Listen to them, the children of the night. What music they make!”\n\nWith the passing of so many years, more than fifty in fact, it has become more and more difficult for me to recall precisely when my love and adoration of classic films in general, and classic horror films in particular, sprang forth; my fascination with the cinema of yesteryear must have grown silently and subtly within me. While I had undoubtedly watched my beloved “old movies” whenever I began watching television, by the age of twelve my love for them had certainly become a conscious element in my life.\n\nI initially gained familiarity with the classic Universal horror films through reading about them; during the late 1960’s, such movies as Frankenstein, The Mummy, and The Wolfman were relegated, at least in my viewing area in southern Ontario, to that venerable, and now long-gone, institution, the television late show, which I was not permitted to watch. I certainly recall the envy I felt in Grade 8 towards my school friends who were allowed to stay up and enjoy them.\n\nMy “maiden opportunity”, as it were, to actually watch one of these longed-for classic treasures finally manifested on a summer afternoon in 1969, during my school vacation between Grade 8 and Grade 9; an afternoon television showing of Dracula became my raisin d’être. From the musical strains of Swan Lake, underscoring the opening credits to the final title card reading “The End” I was transfixed; whereas an objective viewing of the film may bring forth observations of the artificiality of the dialogue and the overall staginess of the production, I was, on the contrary, absorbed and transfixed by the overall story, the eerie, otherworldly atmosphere, the sinister presence of Bela Lugosi. As our current wondrous technology, which can restore a ninety-year-old film to its original shimmering lustre, did not exist in my youth, old movies broadcast on television in the 1960’s showed their age, and to a thirteen-year-old any person or object thirty or more years old truly seemed ancient; sourced at that time from cheap, inferior 16mm print-downs prepared in rental packages for television airings, the films of this vintage contained their share of visual flaws, missing frames, and audio hiss. Yet, rather than serving as a detraction, these blemishes only enhanced my viewing experience of Dracula; the scratches, faded segments, and audio drop-outs appeared appropriate, given the age of the movie. The joy of watching my first classic horror feature simply transcended all physical imperfections.\n\nMy entry – Frankenstein And The Monster From Hell (1973)\n\nWhilst the Universal horror films always had my attention and imagination through childhood, it was a Hammer film that I remember as my earliest experience with horror. Frankenstein And The Monster From Hell (1974) was also the last of the Hammer Frankenstein series, with the late Peter Cushing (unwell at the time) reprising the Baron for the last time as well.\n\nAs with many childhood experiences, this was one which my parents would not have allowed under normal circumstances. However, an aunt was babysitting so my parents could attend a wedding and I enjoyed the luxury of staying up late to see the film. I can still remember being horrified and aghast at the large jar of eyes (with one actually moving in the jar!). Peter Cushing’s Baron was cold and controlling and his manner exuded confidence and authority. However, I still remember the terror of seeing the ape-like and hulking monster that never left me. The contrast of this horrific aberation holding a violin escaped me at the time yet still affected me; likewise the mute girl Sarah who I felt terribly afraid for.\n\nThat night (and many more after) I was certain that the monster was coming down the hallway for me. I could sense that it was there ready to lunge at me. It took a lot of convincing from my mother that there was nothing there. I’m also pretty sure that my mother had an argument with my aunt for letting me watch it. To my aunt’s credit, as well as my grandmother and my mother, I would actually enjoy many more late night films as a child – which is why I’m here now, in a love affair with classic film that will never come to an end.\n\nFrankenstein And The Monster From Hell is not a masterpiece but it’s a better film than the title suggests. It’s Hammer in all its colourful Gothic gore. And I will always have a place for it in my memories, as that first horror film that scared the heck out of me.\n\nAmanda Schulze – Creative Writer @aschulze2001\n\nMy first classic horror film was The Blob (1958). It was on during the day – I was around 10 years old – and I sat on the floor inches from the TV screen and watched the gooey slime swallow everything in its path. My favorite part was when the blob squeezed through the air vents in the theater. Though it wasn’t fast, it kept getting bigger and nothing was able to stop it. I loved it!\n\nRebecca Deniston – Writer and blogger at Taking Up Room\n\nI have never been a huge fan of horror, although it’s been kinda growing on me lately (Anyone else like “The Conjuring” series?). Slashers still aren’t my thing, though. Anyway, back in high school and junior high I wouldn’t watch horror films at all, probably because I didn’t want to repeat the experience I had with “The Curse of King Tut’s Tomb,” a TV movie which left me curled up on the couch, afraid to move but unable to look away. When I saw “Dracula” at the video store as a high school sophomore, though, curiosity got the better of me. My mom has never been a fan of horror, either, but she humored me because she had seen it on TV as a high-schooler in the nineteen-fifties. When we watched the film that night, it was a revelation. I didn’t feel scared so much as drawn in and curious, led along by Bela Lugosi, a man who created what we think of today as vampires. I didn’t know at the time how groundbreaking his portrayal really was; all I could think about was this character with the halting delivery, the elegant bearing and the hypnotic, piercing eyes. While it didn’t make me a horror fan, it changed my view of the genre completely, and on occasion I’m still drawn to visit with Mr. Lugosi in his iconic role.\n\nPaul Batters teaches secondary school History in the Illawarra region and also lectures at the University Of Wollongong.
