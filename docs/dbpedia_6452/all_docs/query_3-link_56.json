        "text": "Early in Star Trek Beyond, James Tiberius Kirk states that he doesn’t celebrate birthdays.\n\nThis is, of itself, a knowing reference to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Fans will recognise the nod immediately, as Doctor Leonard McCoy stops by for a birthday drink to reflect on what growing up actually means. It is one of several knowing homages that populate the film, acknowledgements of the franchise’s legacy and longevity. However, there is also a sense of truth to Kirk’s confusion. How exactly do you mark a milestone like a fiftieth anniversary, particularly for a cultural behemoth like the Star Trek franchise.\n\nThis is a question that will need to be asked with increasing frequency in this era of belated sequels and franchise reboots and recycled properties. The current entertainment ecosystem means that more and more franchises are living to ripe old ages, intellectual properties that need to mark the milestones as they pass. Indeed, the fiftieth anniversary of the Star Trek franchise comes only three years after the fiftieth anniversary of a revived Doctor Who. That was one year after James Bond hit his fifty years on screen with Skyfall.\n\nThis is to say nothing of the anniversaries that fall either side of that big five-oh. Characters like Batman and Superman are over seventy-five years old. Films like Jurassic Park and Independence Day are over twenty. These are milestones. It seems appropriate that we treat these milestones as anniversaries or birthdays, given how multimedia has come to treat intellectual property as a living thing – something growing and cultivated, something engaging with the changing world around it and with its own history.\n\nSo, how exactly do you celebrate a fiftieth anniversary for a franchise? Do you make a big occasion of it? Do you launch a thematic meditation on its core values? Do you deconstruct it so that you might reconstruct it? Do you add to the mythos? Do you revel in the continuity? Do you simply try to offer a reminder of what fans loved about the property in the first place? It is a delicate balancing act, and Star Trek Beyond struggles with it. It tries very hard to be all of these things and more, to the point that it can feel both overstuffed and underwhelming.\n\nTo be fair, there is a sense that Star Trek Beyond is somewhat hobbled by its format. Star Trek is a franchise that has always thrived on television more than in film. Various critics and producers and franchise veterans have argued repeatedly that Star Trek is a franchise that lives on television, that as exciting as the films might be that they are ultimately as supplemental as a mid-episode log update. The essence of Star Trek is in the continuity of a week-to-week television show, something that by its nature cannot be replicated in a film franchise with a new installment every few years.\n\nIn some respects, this handicaps Star Trek Beyond. The film strains to be all things to all people. Director Justin Lin, working along with writers Simon Pegg and Doug Jung, packs the script with heavy thematic dialogue and loving references to the franchise’s history. Star Trek Beyond is packed with deep (and loving) cuts from the franchise’s fifty-year history, but the two-hour runtime and the demands of blockbuster storytelling serve to hem in these elements of the narratives.\n\nIn contrast, Star Trek Beyond works best when it is content to be its own thing, when it is willing to go its own way and take advantage of its own unique position in the larger Star Trek canon. A seemingly minor revelation about the personal life of Hikaru Sulu services to be one of the most progressive creative decisions that the franchise has made in twenty years, a credit to the entire production team. In terms of storytelling, the reboot has been lucky to benefit from a phenomenal cast, and Star Trek Beyond really works when it trusts them to carry the weight.\n\nStar Trek Beyond opens with Kirk reflecting on the strain of command and the weight of his obligations, perhaps reflecting the weight that the production team must feel given the demands placed upon them by fandom expectations. This is a film that finds itself wrestling and grappling with fifty years of what has effectively become an American mythology, a set of iconography and imagery familiar to people who have never even watched a full episode. That is a lot for a single film to bear, and it is to the credit of the production team that they invite that upon themselves.\n\nAt the same time, the sequences in which Star Trek Beyond takes flight are those at which it feels confident enough to move under its own power. Perhaps that is the best way to mark the franchise’s fiftieth anniversary, celebrating what makes this iteration of the franchise unique and pushing it boldly forward instead of looking backwards.The strength of the rebooted Star Trek film franchise has always been in its cast. Indeed, it could legitimately be argued that the reboot has the most charismatic cast in the franchise since Star Trek: The Next Generation, a bunch of talented young actors who bounce well off one another and do an excellent job conveying a sense of personality and nuance to what are (and were also in the original iteration) essentially a set of stock roles. That said, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine retains the most talented ensemble in the franchise, pound for pound.\n\nStar Trek Beyond works best when it recognises this. In many ways, the plot borrows one of the stronger elements of Star Trek, shrewdly separating the cast so that it can then draw them back together for a big heroic climax. The result is that the plot gives the members of the ensemble a little space to bounce off one another, making sure that every character gets a “hero” moment. The film wryly splits the cast into smaller groups. Kirk and Chekov. Uhura and Sulu. McCoy and Spock. Scotty and Jaylah.\n\nThis decision is clever on a number of levels. From a purely plotting perspective, it allows the film to cover a lot of (literal and metaphorical) ground quite quickly. It helps to build a sense of momentum and create a sense of forward movement, as the film is never stuck in a particular place or with a particular character for too long. More than that, it allows the actors to play against each other in a way that emphasises their charm. Everybody gets something to do, whether it’s Uhura solving the mystery of Krall or Scotty discovering an antique.\n\nOne of the great successes of Star Trek Beyond is the vintage team-up of Spock and McCoy. The two characters had a long association on the original show, serving as two parts of the original “trinity.” Conventional wisdom positioned Spock as the superego and McCoy as the id, with Kirk balancing between the two as the ego. However, the reboot films have generally downplayed that dynamic, swapping out McCoy for Uhura. This is not a bad decision of itself; it emphasises the diversity that many Star Trek fans champion and it adds a novel twist to reboot dynamics.\n\nAt the same time, it is great fun to watch Karl Urban and Zachary Quinto play off one another as they attempt to navigate a hostile alien environment together. There is an interesting contrast at play in the dynamic. Of the recast leads, Karl Urban is the cast member most obviously and intentionally channeling the original actor; Urban’s interpretation of McCoy can veer close to an affectionate impression of DeForest Kelley at times. In contrast, Zachary Quinto is perhaps the cast member with the most unique interpretation of his character.\n\nThe result is a dynamic that encapsulates a lot of the charm and the appeal of the reboot. It captures a lot of what made the original so iconic, while offering just enough of its own little twist on that basic concept that it doesn’t feel like a rehash. Although very much marginal in terms of the actual plot, Spock and McCoy serve very much as the emotional heart of the film. Their interactions recall great Spock and McCoy moments like their pseudo-reconciliation in Bread and Circuses, but in a way that feels somewhat novel.\n\nPegg and Jung are careful to afford each of the cast and crew their own big moment. Sulu gets to (briefly) take command and fly an antique ship. (When Kirk asks whether Sulu can pilot the ship, Sulu responds with a wry, “Are you kidding me?”) Uhura gets to delve into the origins and backstory of the film’s antagonist. Chekov is perhaps the most underserved, although he gets to act as the very embodiment of youthful enthusiasm, whether chatting to young women or studying under Kirk.\n\nScotty gets to talk about the importance of the crew as a surrogate family unit, which feels like a thematically important point given that the dialogue is given to the film’s co-writer. In getting to know the scavenger orphan Jaylah, Scotty makes an appeal for unity and teamwork that provides the scripts strongest thematic throughline. Consciously harking back to the structure that made the first of the reboot films so successful, Star Trek Beyond is a story about how this group is so much more effective when they work together. That is a very Star Trek theme.\n\nTo a certain extent, there is a bit of franchise revisionism at play here; Gene Roddenberry did not really structure the Star Trek universe as a pacifist utopia until Star Trek: The Motion Picture or even The Next Generation. After all, it was not until The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine that the harmony and unity of the Federation was grotesquely mirrored in the terrifying homogeneity of the Borg or the frightful oppression of the Dominion. In contrast, the original Star Trek placed less emphasis on the unified utopian aspect of the franchise.\n\nStill, it feels like an appropriate theme for the franchise’s fiftieth anniversary. Certainly, the theme of unity within the cast works a lot better than the broader theme of unity as Star Trek Beyond tries to tie it to the larger continuity of the franchise. Indeed, this ties fairly well back to the original Star Trek. Although the show often neglected supporting players like Uhura or Sulu, there was always a sense watching the show that the crew represented the very best of mankind coming together in common cause even before the words “Starfleet” or “Federation” were uttered.\n\nThere is something very appealing about this core cast. Every single member of the crew is affable at the very least, and quite a few are far more than that. Chris Pine has a goofy improvisational charm that sits on the unlikely midpoint between William Shatner and Harrison Ford. Quinto finds pathos in moments that could easily descend to fan service. Zoe Saldana conveys a sense of certainty that anchors the character and the cast. The late Anton Yelchin is incredibly energetic as one of the franchise’s most gleefully eccentric creations.\n\nWatching this cast interact with one another that helps ease over some of the shakier plot logic or the fact that Star Trek Beyond hinges on an unnecessarily dense core mythology. Star Trek Beyond is full of likable actors allowed to be charming. In its own way, this idea of a coherent family forged from dysfunctional individuals is very much at the heart of the franchise, even stripping away all the franchise’s social relevance and commentary and utopianism. In its own way, each of the Star Trek shows is about found families, albeit of differing types.\n\n(Tellingly, this was also a central theme of Where No Fan Has Gone Before, the Futurama celebration of the original Star Trek that plays very much like an affectionate anniversary celebration of the franchise. In a moment of heartbreaking honesty, the central character Fry explains why the Star Trek franchise spoke to him. “When I had no friends, it made me feel like maybe I did.” There is a tiny grain of truth in that sadness, particularly for children who grew up with the franchise in syndication on afternoon television. Star Trek Beyond gets that.)\n\nThere are points at which this does feel like too much. Indeed, while Sofia Boutella makes a solid addition to the cast and Jaylah interacts well with Scotty, there is a sense that her personal grudge against one particular secondary antagonist is a character arc too many in a two-hour film with at least nine major characters. However, the emphasis on the cast dynamic helps to gloss over these little issues, and any awkwardness around trying give Jaylah her own arc are balanced out in her interactions with Scotty.\n\nThe structuring of Star Trek Beyond as an ensemble piece also makes for a nice structural homage. One of the more interesting aspects of the Abrams era films is the way that they each consciously mirror and parallel the original film series. Both Star Trek and The Motion Picture unite the crew to resolve a spectacular threat against Earth. Both The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek Into Darkness put Kirk into conflict with Khan Noonien Singh. It seems only appropriate that Star Trek Beyond should share a number of core attributes with Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.\n\nThe broader focus on the ensemble cast is one such attribute. With Leonard Nimoy absent following the death of Spock at the climax of The Wrath of Khan, the following film was able to diffuse its focus. The Search for Spock marks the first time that the franchise made a point to allocate plot beats to each and every member of the ensemble; it is the point at which Star Trek really grew beyond the trinity of Kirk, Spock and McCoy. As such, it seems appropriate for Star Trek Beyond to widen its focus in that way.\n\nOther parallels suggest themselves. Both Star Trek Beyond and The Search for Spock open with the Enterprise returning to Spacedock, exhausted and perhaps defeated. Both Star Trek Beyond and The Search for Spock find a cast member stepping behind the scenes, with Leonard Nimoy directing The Search for Spock and Simon Pegg serving as co-writer on Star Trek Beyond. Both films also feature an antagonist played by a veteran television star who is motivated by a deep-seated political objection to the expansionist tendencies of the United Federation of Planets.\n\nOf course, the most obvious parallel comes in terms of premise and setting. The Search for Spock famously featured the destruction of the Enterprise, with Kirk sacrificing his ship during his mission to save Spock as some sort of restorative trade. Following the destruction of the Enterprise in The Search for Spock, Kirk and his crew find themselves waging a ground war on the surface of the mysterious Genesis Planet. Star Trek Beyond follows a similar premise, with the trailers showcasing the destruction of the Enterprise as the crew try to survive on an alien world.\n\nStill, these are far from the only references to the Star Trek canon. As befits a fiftieth anniversary celebration, Star Trek Beyond is saturated with references and callbacks. The film opens on “day nine hundred and sixty six” of the five-year mission, at once a reference to the show’s September 1966 premiere date and to the truncated three-season run. “I tore my shirt again,” Kirk complains early in the film, an affectionate nod to William Shatner’s tendency to tear his uniform in exactly the same place each and every time.\n\nAlthough there is nothing quite as blatant as the lifts that Into Darkness took from The Wrath of Khan, fans will spot any number of sly in-jokes and references. McCoy visits Kirk in his quarters, as doctor and captain converse about the latter’s exhaustion in an obvious homage to The Cage, the very first (unaired) Star Trek pilot. There are repeated suggestions that the universe is a hostile place that can (physically and mentally) transform those who pass through it, a thematic nod to Where No Man Has Gone Before, the second (aired) pilot.\n\nAs with Star Trek and Into Darkness, there is a sense that Beyond is aspiring to be a big bold “pop” version of Star Trek, essentially a gigantic celebratory party mix of the franchise’s highlights. There are a lot of familiar beats. McCoy gets to utter “I’m a Doctor, not a –“ and complain about his organs being scrambled. Scotty gets to work miracles. Kirk gets to act impulsively. The Abrams era tends to draw a lot of criticism from fandom for drawing broadly on the mythos, but it does so to craft a broadly accessible version of Star Trek for a wide audience.\n\nHowever, Beyond digs a bit deeper into the franchise lore. There are lots of nods and imagery appropriated from the franchise’s fifty-year history, often from the most unlikely of places. The Enterprise crash sequence looks a lot like the crash sequence from Star Trek: Generations. The youth-chasing villain and the forest setting seems like they might have stepped out from Star Trek: Insurrection. There are also more recent nods; Scotty gets to hide in one of the man-sized torpedoes from Into Darkness and the film shares Star Trek‘s affection for multi-layered fight choreography.\n\nIndeed, there is even a sense that the Borg haunt the narrative of Beyond. Lin, Pegg and Jung seem to understand that introducing the iconic cyborgs into this rebooted continuity would risk a full-blown fan mutiny, but there is a very strong influence on Krall and his allies. Most obviously, Krall’s fleet is described as a “swarm” and likened to “bees”, with the key to defeating them lying in the cybernetic connections between them. There is also a recurring sense that Krall has been transformed and rendered monstrous through his pursuit of his objective.\n\nTo be fair, a lot of those similarities are purely thematic in natural. Krall has obviously and consciously designed to stand in thematic opposition to the crew. “Unity is not your strength,” he goads at one point. “It is your weakness.” As such, the hive mind working under Krall stands in sharp opposition to the strength that Kirk draws from the individualism of his crew. However, there is also a sense that the production team may have been inspired in terms of design aesthetic by the most popular of the franchise’s second generation aliens.\n\nHowever, the continuity references in Star Trek Beyond run much deeper than just surface references and aesthetic echoes. Even the macguffin that drives the plot is tied back to the “Ancient Ones” of Lovecraftian lore, which were carefully threaded into classic Star Trek lore as “the Old Ones” by Lovecraft aficionado Robert Bloch in scripts like What Are Little Girls Made Of? and Catspaw. None of this is essential information, as the plot logic driving Beyond is easy enough to follow, but it speaks to the level of Star Trek minutiae at which Jung and Pegg are working.\n\nSlightly more complicated is the way that Beyond integrates classic Star Trek continuity into Krall’s back story. Beyond keeps things relatively accessible in outlining Krall’s motivations and history, but it is threaded through a number of thematic and continuity references that are firmly entrenched in Star Trek lore. It is not just that these are very specific references of themselves, it is that they come from rather esoteric parts of the franchise history. Krall’s back story is rooted in a portion of franchise history that comes long after the mid-nineties peak."
