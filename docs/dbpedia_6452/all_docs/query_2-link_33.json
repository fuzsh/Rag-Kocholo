First Printing, With 1926 Date Oln Title Page. Light Usage, Spine Cloth A Little Worn And Faded But Gilt Lettering Mostly Clear And Bright. Ownership Signature Of Wallace Archibald Macdonald (1891 ? 1978, A Canadian Silent Film Actor And Film Producer. Per Wikipedia, Macdonald Was Born In Mulgrave, Nova Scotia, Canada, And Attended School In Sydney, Nova Scotia. He Started As A Messenger Boy With The Dominion Steel Company In Sydney, Nova Scotia. He Later Worked Up To Teller With The Royal Bank Branch In Sydney Before The Bank Transferred Him To Vancouver, British Columbia. From There, He Moved To California, Where He Acted On The Stage Before Making Inroads Into Hollywood. Macdonald Started As An Actor In Films In 1914 And Starred In Almost 120 Motion Pictures Between Then And 1932. He Had Notable Roles In Such Films As Youth's Endearing Charm In 1916 Working With Mary Miles Minter And Harry Von Meter. Late In World War I, He Returned Briefly To Nova Scotia To Enlist In The 10Th Canadian Siege Battery Where He Assisted In Recruiting For The Canadian Army. With The Advent Of Sound, Macdonald's Acting Career Diminished, And Most Of His Roles Between 1927 And 1932 Went Uncredited. He Retired From Acting In 1932 To Concentrate On Script Writing. However, By 1937 He Had Recognized The Potential Of Film Production. It Is In His Role Of Producer That Macdonald Is Now Probably Best Remembered. He Produced Well Over 100 Films Between 1937 And 1959. Macdonald Married Actress Doris May In 1921, And They Remained Wed Until His Death In 1978 In Santa Barbara, California. Films About Haiti And Produced In Haiti Are Scarce, Almost Non-Existent."
