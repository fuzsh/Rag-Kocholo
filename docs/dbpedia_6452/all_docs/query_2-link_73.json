        "text": "A series review worthy of The Last Airbender\n\nBy Jayvin Williams\n\nStaff writer\n\nBut when the world needed a review the most, he vanished.\n\nIn February 2024, the live-action adaptation of the animated Nickelodeon TV series, Avatar: The Last Airbender was released on Netflix. While the series stays true to the source material, it does derail in some of the most important parts of the original series that made it so good. However, the live-action series is still superior to the live-action Avatar movie that was released in 2010.\n\nKung Fu Panda 4 packs punch worthy of a Dragon Warrior\n\nBy Damani Edgington and Quinton Smith\n\nStaff writers\n\nWhen people heard that the Kung Fu Panda franchise was getting another movie, I’m sure some people were thinking, Wait–they still make Kung Fu Panda movies?”\n\nI’m sure when the producers made the first movie in 2008, they would’ve never thought that they’d make Kung Fu Panda 4 16 years later, which surpassed movies as big as Dune: Part Two at the box office.\n\nEven though the movie was very successful at the box office, the necessity of a fourth movie is still up for debate. Some people believe that you shouldn’t fix what’s not broken, especially if it’s not been broken for eight years straight (with Kung Fu Panda 3 coming out in 2016). Despite not being completely necessary, the movie held its own weight and was a well-crafted addition to the series.\n\nBy De’Rico Spires and Aaron McKrell\n\nStaff Writer and Editor\n\nDebating basketball’s greatest of all time\n\nEditor’s note: This is a column in which two big-time sports fans, 13-year-old De’Rico Spires and 33-year-old Aaron McKrell, debate some of the hottest sports topics of the day.\n\nDe’Rico Spires: Basketball was not better in the ‘90s because some of the people in the NBA were and are unknown.\n\nAaron McKrell: Coming in hot, huh? So, you’re saying that the competition wasn’t what it is today?\n\nDS: No, because we have better NBA players, and coming out of the ‘90s, players were not that athletic.\n\nAM: So let me guess: LeBron is your GOAT over Jordan?\n\nDS: No, LeBron’s trash. My GOAT has to either be Giannis Antetokounmpo or Anthony Edwards.\n\nNickelodeon cooks up a worthy sequel to the classic Good Burger\n\nBy Jayvin Williams\n\nStaff writer\n\nWelcome to Truth from the Youth, home of journalism, may I take your review?\n\nIn late November, the sequel to the Nickelodeon original film Good Burger was released on Paramount+. Good Burger 2 came 26 years after the original film. With all the time between the movies, did Good Burger 2 live up to the original, and was it worth the wait?\n\nEven though the sequel did not fully live up to the charm of the original film, it’s still a satisfying movie. Kel Mitchell and Kenan Thompson respectively reprise their roles as Ed and Dex, and their chemistry on screen still works decades later.\n\nBlue Beetle elevates DC to new heights\n\nBy Jayvin Williams\n\nStaff writer\n\nWith the announcement of Blue Beetle, many people worried if the film would hold up to the comics that began in 1939.\n\nAfter seeing the film, it’s clear that expectations were met, Blue Beetle was worth the wait and it was a win for DC Studios. The movie’s casting, costume design and cinematography make it a great film.\n\nBreakfast at Tiffany’s dazzles with charming love story\n\nBy Batoul Achy & Seidet Segura\n\nColumnists\n\nThis is the fourth installment of Movie Night with Batoul & Seidet, a monthly series in which Batoul Achy and Seidet Segura will collaborate on and taking turns writing classic movie reviews from a modern perspective.\n\nYou won’t be able to take your eyes off Breakfast at Tiffany’s! The 1961 film is strengthened by the aesthetic of it overall, the love story between Paul and Holly, and its humor. On the other hand, the racist stereotype towards Asians and the weird relationship between Paul and Holly at first glance is what weakens the movie. In general, Breakfast at Tiffany’s is a film that many admire, even to this day.\n\nSpirited superior to A Christmas Carol in telling the tale of Scrooge\n\nBy Batoul Achy and Seidet Segura\n\nColumnists\n\nThis is the third installment of Movie Night with Batoul & Seidet, a monthly series in which Batoul Achy and Seidet Segura will collaborate on and taking turns writing classic movie reviews from a modern perspective.\n\nThe 1951 film A Christmas Carol and 2022 film Spirited are both films that share a handful of similarities, yet differences. A Christmas Carol is a take on the book A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. Spirited is a modern retake with a plot twist of the 1951 film. Overall, Spirited is better since it feels more alive and the message is clearer than in A Christmas Carol.\n\nDisney’s Pinocchio falls short despite stellar animation\n\nBy Batoul Achy & Seidet Segura\n\nColumnists\n\nThis is the second installment of Movie Night with Batoul & Seidet, a monthly series in which Batoul Achy and Seidet Segura will collaborate on and taking turns writing classic movie reviews from a modern perspective.\n\nThe 1940 film Pinocchio is one of the most influential animation films, even after 82 years. The movie is well known for a bunch of great reasons, including Pinocchio’s physical features and its detailed animation. Although the movie is visually appealing, the plot and dramatic scenes fail to complete the movie entirely. Pinocchio isn’t the best, but definitely deserves credit for inspiring future generations of animated films.\n\n“Wizard of Oz” holds up well after almost a century\n\nBy Seidet Segura\n\nStaff Writer\n\nThis is the first installment of Movie Night with Batoul & Seidet, a monthly series in which Batoul Achy and Seidet Segura will collaborate on and taking turns writing classic movie reviews from a modern perspective.\n\n“The Wizard of Oz” is a timeless classic. This movie has been passed down by generations for a great reason.\n\nThe film’s lovable characters, catchy songs and surprising developments still hold up to this day.\n\nThere are a few parts that don’t complement the story, but overall this movie definitely leaves the audience impressed and satisfied.\n\nReview: King Richard serves up excellence\n\nBy Brikiera Franklin and Eriana Rutledge\n\nStaff writers\n\n‘King Richard’ was amazing. The movie showed what real-life tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams had to go through to accomplish their goals. The film shows how they achieved their dreams and how their father, Richard Williams, was always a part of their journey."
