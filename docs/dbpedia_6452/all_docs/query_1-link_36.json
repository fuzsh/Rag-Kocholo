From the drudgery of the farm the pretty child works out her own salvation and the end of the absorb ing drama finds her a beloved mem ber of a millionaire family in a great metropolis all of which she accom plishes by her unconscious under standing of human nature, her natur al cleverness and her youthful exu berance. No more ingenious plot was ever conceived for the exploitation of a talen'ed actress thin this Intensely Interesting Mary Miles Minter starring vehicle The rare beauty and excep tional talents of the li'tle star are shown to excellem advantage as the drama gives free play for both artis tic emotional work and refined light comedy, at the sainetime emphasiz ing the everlasting magnetic charm of youth, so .typical of the screen's youngest and most beautiful artist I'resented by a splendid company of well known players, Mary Miles Min ter in \"You'h's Kndearing Charm\" Is an exceptinally meritorious produc tion In addition \"A Deed of Daring.\" with Helen Holmes This is one of the sensational \"La-W of the Lumber lands\" plays and is the most thrillins up to date There are sensations up on sensations In this wonderful play.

The Oregonian of Decern bcr 3rd, said: Young Kaufman was heard In con cert at the Helllg theater October ;il and made such a good impression that his name was put on the Orpheum's emergency Ibit. His Orpheum engage ment Is his first recognition by vau deville, and the fact thai the young ster begins with the \"big time\" is r garded as a high honor for one of hi. years as it is customary for young ar tist to go through a probationary pe riod In the \"small time.\" The boy musician will be heard in a repertoire calculated to show h.-, great talent as a violinist. His selec tions will include a classical number or two and several popular pieces.

In Onions There is Strength A REEL REAL COMEDY. IF ITS GOOD YOU WILL SEE IT AT THE COSY and a few docks thrown In for good measure just to make the film a suc cess. Just how George attained the effect! is a mystery, as he refuses to dlvlge the secret, but the fact remains that he haa produced one of the most real istic fire scenes on record. He secured mi!. : n. ... i . ni.Mivt; FIRE roi \"THK lU'.RITAtiK OF II ATK\" The climax of \"The Heritage oft Hate,\" a Red Feather feature produc tion which will be seen at the Cosy i theater on Tuesday and Wednesday, is the burning of a whole dock and j ship that belong to John Bradley. It t is the culmination of the ruin thu has been planned so carefully by his illegitimate child and it breaks him entirely. Director Button George de serves a great deal of credit for th way that he has handled th's very difficult, scene. He could not get a picture of an actual fire, as there would noil be enough light to photo graph the conflagration with the de sired effect. Besides, no one mi\" kind enough to burn up a ship or sc .3 :.i . v i .V rTrmr. fir real dock and at night in some way managed to have light? arranged so that they s-em to glare with all the ghastly reality of a real fire.
