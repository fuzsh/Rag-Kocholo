        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nHe quickly walked through the hallways of the Red Keep, lightly pushing people aside and brushing shoulders with them as he made his way to the higher floors of Maegor’s Holdfast.\n\nThe castle was a true maze, he had always thought so, and even having spent his entire life in the Red Keep, he still sometimes struggled to understand its layout, the way the corridors and the halls were connected, how the staircases brought together different parts of the same castle, built in different eras, renovated not at the same time at all.\n\nMaybe because he was in a rush, but today, the way to his destination seemed particularly endless and winding, annoying him. All the courtiers were quick to bow to him; some even tried to ask for something, but he had no time for that, not when he was virtually running as fast as he could without raising suspicions.\n\nHe knew she would not appreciate him keeping the news from her even for one minute, and he loathed to be the messenger, but it was his duty.\n\nHis hand instinctively travelled to the pommel of his sword — there was no physical danger he had to fight off, but this was a gesture he had inherited from his father, the need to seek the odd comfort in knowing that his blade was at his hip, that he could unsheath it any second should the situation become worse.\n\nNot that running a sword through someone would help them now.\n\nAegon knew he would find his mother in the nursery — it was a fixed schedule of their lives, and she always spent these early hours of the day with younger children while the older ones went to the training yard. Daeron and Gaemon were still too young to train with them, and so their education at arms usually commenced in the afternoon, when the more serious part of drills was long over.\n\nMother observed his brothers’ lessons in history and languages before going to see Visenya — and Aegon was glad for the predictability of their routine, the way he could always count on finding her in the same predisposed place depending on the time of the day.\n\nAegon walked past the guards straight to the nursery — and there, standing at the threshold, he finally allowed himself to catch a breath, looking for his mother.\n\nThere she was, kneeling in front of Visenya, smoothing the girl’s dress. Aegon’s sister was already known for causing trouble at such a young age, and he had no doubt he was interrupting an important parenting moment, but he had no other choice.\n\nHis heart raced — both from the very brisk walk to the nursery and from the events of the day, anxiety threatening to break him in two. He knew why it had to be him talking to their mother, for he was the eldest and the most knowledgeable about what was to come should their worst fears be confirmed, but he still felt like a child standing there and looking at her.\n\nAged eight-and-ten, he might be carrying a sword, might be the second in line to the throne, might have been educated in all the intricate matters of governance and intrigue, but in front of her, he always ended up shrinking, losing the commanding and imperious demeanour and becoming but a child all over again.\n\nHis mother immediately switched her attention to him — Aegon knew not how she did it, but no change of his emotion could ever escape her trained maternal eye. She narrowed her eyes and squeezed Visenya’s little hand before slowly standing up, her gaze locked on him.\n\nAegon knew he had to say something, as quickly as possible, for every moment was precious, and time was mercilessly fleeting, but all he could do was stare at her as she walked closer to him, her hand resting on her lower abdomen.\n\nHow could he even find the words to tell her the news — when she was with child again, when he knew it was pernicious for her to worry and fret? Aegon was well aware that his mother did not get dismayed easily, and there had been just a handful of times he had seen her lose her composure and betray weakness, but surely, this would shake her and unsettle her.\n\n“Mother —” he began and immediately trailed off, his own fear making his throat close and his voice tremble. Why did it have to be him, why could she not learn from anyone else?\n\nAnd yet Aegon knew why — it was his duty as the firstborn, as her adult son, to break the news to her and make sure she did not suffer much at the realisation of the gravity of the situation.\n\n“Speak up,” his mother said, frowning. There it was — her stern confidence, the one she had tried to instil in all of them.\n\nAegon would probably always be in awe of how grand her character was — she did not shy away from anything, either from injustice or from punishment for it, and her head was always high, in the face of any challenge, any peril.\n\nAnd gods knew there had been quite a few for her in this life.\n\nHe was berating himself for his hesitance, so he took a deep breath and found the strength to speak. The longer he was keeping it a secret, the more disstressed his mother would be, and this was certainly not what he wanted.\n\n“There has been an incident in the training yard, Mother,” he said with a loud exhale, happy that at least he did not stutter, did not break down under the wave of emotions he was experiencing.\n\nUncertainty. Fear. Sadness.\n\nShould it truly come to the worst, he would need to protect them all — it would be his, Aegon’s, duty to ensure that his brothers and sister lived and that his mother did not face any opposition and injustice. He had been brought up with the knowledge of his mission — Mother had always been direct in her approach, never letting him forget the dangers that loomed over their shoulders wherever they went simply by the fact of being her children.\n\nFather preferred a more subtle approach, constantly drilling Aegon in his skills at arms and intrigue, but he could still see it for what it was — born first, he had a heavy burden on his shoulders and large shoes to fill eventually.\n\nHe had simply hoped it would happen later, not quite so soon.\n\nHis mother touched his cheek — and Aegon’s eyes immediately welled with tears, for he might be a Prince, might be eight-and-ten of age, but he was still their child, and the thoughts of the worst cut him deep, deeper than he could have ever imagined.\n\n“What kind of an incident?” She asked, her eyes racing, examining his face for signs of harm.\n\nAegon wondered if she had realised already — or maybe she was thinking about his younger brothers, Baelon or Aemon getting into some trouble or acquiring an unnecessary injury.\n\n“With Fath — ” Aegon began but then looked over his mother’s shoulder at Visenya, who sat on the floor and observed them with unadulterated childish curiosity. No, he could not call him that, not in front of the child who was still too young to understand the intricate embroidery of their lives. “With His Grace, Mother.”\n\nHe never learned to call him his grandsire, not even as a decoy — even when he was little, he could not quite call him that, even though it was not until much later that he learned the truth. Growing up, he looked at the King with adoration and always liked when His Grace found time for him, be it to read to him or to take him atop his dragon.\n\nEven in those times of childish innocence, he was always His Grace the King to Aegon, a title perhaps too heavy for a little boy to pronounce every time, but he must have always known that there was more to this connection than him simply being the King’s grandson.\n\nWhen Aegon was a child, there was still so much secrecy and caution — and as he grew, he realised there was no man to call “father”, not even in the shadows. Aware he had been born outside of wedlock, he started looking for a man who could have sired him in the faces of the courtiers and guards, entirely unaware of how children even came to be but still desperate to understand the secret of his mere existence.\n\nChildren were supposed to have fathers — and yet Aegon seemingly had none, for his mother never married, never invited anyone into her solar to break fast with them, and never encouraged his friendship with one of the men at court. Aegon had brothers, too, all three of them born one after another within four years, and yet he never saw anyone who could be the other half, the other parent creating him.\n\nHe remembered the first time she told him who his father was — he did not understand it back then, and it took him another couple of years to fully comprehend the truth of his existence, even if it all seemed so obvious to him now.\n\n***\n\n“Do we have a father, Mother?”\n\n“Of course you do, my sweet boy,” she replied, ruffling his hair as he sat on her lap, barely five years old.\n\n“Why is he never around us then? Does he not love us?”\n\nShe lowered her head to kiss his temple. “He is always around, my darling, and he loves you very much. Trust me, I would know.”\n\nHer words made little sense to him, so he frowned, thinking his mother was playing riddles with him. Other boys at court had their sires — they sometimes taught them to ride or to fight and took them on hunts and tourneys, but Aegon never had someone to look up to this way.\n\nHe only had the King, and he was the best of examples, but Aegon could not understand why his father would not want him — was he not a good son, not a source of pride? His mother always praised him, always wrapped him in affection and deep love — was it not enough for his sire?\n\nAegon’s lips quivered, for he wanted to cry at the outrageous thought of not being loved, and he kept persisting:\n\n“Where is he, then? Who is he?”\n\nHis mother adjusted him on her lap, cupping his cheek gently and wiping away a single tear that had escaped the corner of his eye despite his best efforts to appear grown up and strong.\n\n“Your father is the best man in the world, Aegon. The strongest, the fiercest, the wisest — and you are his firstborn son, a Prince, do you hear me?”\n\nHe sniffled then, her description matching only one man he knew in his short life. “Like our King, then?”\n\nHis mother smiled, her eyes bright, and nodded. “Yes, my love. Like our King.”\n\n***\n\nIt was not until he turned ten that he managed to understand what she meant by her words back then — and now, being an adult, he knew that it was not yet time for his younger siblings to learn the truth, for this knowledge robbed of innocence forever.\n\nNow, his mother was staring at him, not blinking at all — and Aegon was afraid he had said something wrong, that he had already failed in his mission to protect her above everything and everyone else. Those had always been his father’s instructions — to put his mother before anything else, to remember his main duty was to her — and yet Aegon was not sure he knew what he was doing.\n\nShe did not start crying, did not appear panicked. Instead, she took a deep breath and asked him:\n\n“Where is he now?”\n\n“His rooms, Mother.”\n\nShe nodded and turned to Visenya. The girl was still waiting on the floor, stretching her short arms to her mother and brother, wanting their attention, on the verge of a tantrum at being denied their warmth — but as much as Aegon wished to comfort the little girl, he knew it was not quite time for that.\n\n“Mother will be back soon,” she said calmly, nodding at the nurses to hold the little Princess. “I promise, darling.”\n\nWith that, she focused on him again, trying to read something on his face. It was amazing — how composed and calm she looked, especially since Aegon had expected her to cry or rage immediately.\n\nBut his mother was truly an enigma, and Aegon doubted he would ever fully understand her — perhaps it was inevitable, this gap between a mother and a son impossible to bridge, for there had been half of a lifetime for her before Aegon was born, half of a lifetime of maturing, of plots, of mistakes, of triumphs, of experience.\n\nShe did not need him to lead the way, did not expect him to say anything else — she simply moved past him, swift as the wind itself. Aegon kept up with her, but it was far from a leisurely stroll — she might not be quite running, the Princess of the realm that she was, never rushing, never letting the imaginary crown drop from her head, but there was still haste in her purposeful steps. He noticed her gather her skirts to walk faster, and her quick pace was the only sign of distress she offered the world.\n\nAegon was in awe of her strength — one could read it as indifference, as coldness of her heart and wicked anticipation of power, but he knew better than that.\n\nNo one loved the King as much as she did — and Aegon struggled to comprehend the depth of this devotion at times, even as he had reached adulthood and saw the world for what it was. Ever since he came to the realisation of the true nature of his birth and parentage, he had experienced various emotions — resentment and anger had been there, too, the helpless fury of a child who had been denied a proper family, a father he could call such openly, and the peace of uncalamitous existence.\n\nHis mother had told him many times that his very life was an object of so many people’s envy and ire, that he had to be careful and wise, that no one but her and the King truly loved him — and Aegon grew up with this knowledge engraved deep in his very soul, carved there like ancient High Valyrian glyphs.\n\nThey were a complicated family, but family was their main value — and they had no other choice but to hold tightly onto each other, protecting their own and offering claws and teeth to everyone else.\n\nThey all loved each other — it was not a surprise, really, not with how their parents raised them. Their mother was a headstrong woman, stern and too firm with them at times, but always affectionate, and even her harsh lessons were always wrapped in warmth and care. Wherever she explained how important it was to trust no one, how they only had each other to rely on, she might have appeared unkind and almost ruthless, always demanding near perfection from Aegon and his brothers, but all that stemmed from the profound need to protect.\n\nWhen Aegon was younger, he thought that he loved his father more — it was way easier to love him than his mother. The King was always kinder, more benign and more indulgent with them — at least so it seemed to a child who used to love skipping history lessons and sneaking out of the library, much to his mother’s dissatisfaction. As Aegon grew, he realised that the King was never lenient on them — forced to maintain appearances, he simply focused on other lessons, on something only a man and a King could teach them.\n\nThey really did make a perfect pair, Aegon mused, even when it came to raising them — two sides of the same coin, they complemented each other, both giving something to their children in a way that enriched the result, never contradicted.\n\nAnd their mother loved them dearly — she would die for any of them, Aegon knew, and her love was endless, her heart always growing to accommodate one more person to love with each child she gave birth to, but Aegon also knew that there was one person who rivalled her children.\n\nShe might have six of them, might carry another right now — but the love she had for her father was stronger than even the love for her offspring, and there were days when Aegon thought it unfair, thought it impossible to come to terms with, but now, he had long made his peace with it.\n\nHe did not doubt there were days she dashed as quickly to them — one of her children in need of help or comfort, her motherly heart guiding her to them and making her push past obstacles and annoying bystanders blocking her way. She never denied them tenderness and affection, always happy to hug, to kiss, to cuddle, to carry in her arms — but there was a call even stronger than this one, a pull she could never ignore.\n\nHis mother loved the King in a way that was incomprehensible to mere mortals — Aegon sometimes thought that he would never see anything like that ever again. This love had been condemned many a time, and they both had to pay for it, balancing on a tightrope more than once, but it prevailed, always, only growing stronger by the year, producing more children, more proof of its longevity.\n\nAnd there was certain pride to be found in coming out of such a union — it was unholy, and a great many people believed Aegon and his siblings to be abominations, insults to the faith, to their subjects, to the gods, to nature itself. But the fact that his mother laughed in the faces of their adversaries, the fact that they all still lived despite the rumours and vicious attempts to end their lives, filled Aegon’s heart with dignity and honour.\n\nAegon understood what most people did not — that his mother was a daughter first and foremost, and she and the King had decades to form this connection. No matter what happened, no matter how many children they had, there would always be a longer history between the two of them. They existed this way before Aegon was born, and there was no point in trying to defy the passage of time.\n\nShe could be an excellent mother, but even in this, she remained a dutiful daughter, raising her father’s children with fierce, unyielding care and striving to get the best for them.\n\nAs they moved through the castle, Aegon felt calmer and calmer. The confidence in her gait, the way she ignored people trying to talk to her, the way she simply made her way to familiar chambers — it all transferred to Aegon, filling him with certainty that everything could still be fine.\n\nSometimes, he struggled to comprehend how a woman like his mother could even need protection. Aegon and his brothers had been trained with swords, bows and lances, had studied martial strategy and tactics, and had attended the military council of their father as he planned operations to crush the rebels, but all that paled in comparison to their mother’s sheer inner strength and imperious demeanour.\n\nShe bent people to her will — and half of them hated her for it, spreading venom about her, but the other half admired her, at least in secret.\n\nThe King wielded the ancestral swords, he wore the crown, and he sat on the Iron Throne — but his main weapon must be his daughter, her tenacity and her resilience, borderline stubbornness and unfaltering pride.\n\nIt did not take them long to reach their father’s chambers — this part of the castle had been rebuilt some years ago, creating a separate wing with the King’s and Queen’s apartments. No longer were the rooms simply sitting at the end of the long hallway in Maegor’s Holdfast — no, they were enclosed now, guards posted outside the main door leading to the secret world that belonged only to Aegon’s parents.\n\nHis mother had been living in the Queen’s rooms for quite some time already — just opposite their father’s, needing less than a minute to cross the distance between herself and the King. No one but their trusted servants and children was usually allowed inside this space, the set of chambers separated from the rest of the castle by a new thick wall, but now, it was bustling with people.\n\nShe did not like that — annoyed at the intrusion, she frowned and wrinkled her nose, all those people irritating her. Aegon could see it on her face, how she rolled her eyes as she saw someone from the small council, as she walked past gossiping maids.\n\n“Why are they all here?” she asked him as they took the final turn, standing in front of the door leading to the King’s bedroom.\n\n“Because this is serious, Mother,” Aegon said carefully, clearing his throat. “They all… fear the worst.”\n\nIt crossed his mind that she might not understand the gravity of the situation — and he would prefer her remaining in the dark, peaceful and untroubled while the maesters did their job, but his mother was the heir to the throne and the consort in everything but name at the same time. For better or for worse, she belonged in that room, even if it broke Aegon’s heart to think that she would be afflicted by deep grief.\n\nShe huffed, unimpressed by his concerns — and Aegon thought this confidence was bordering denial now.\n\nAs they entered the chamber, she sighed loudly. He saw how she immediately focused on the bed — one could hardly see it, for it was swarmed by people, maesters and maids, servants bringing water, courtiers standing over it like it was a wake already, their expression solemn.\n\nAegon noticed his brothers — Baelon and Aemon — standing by the King’s bedside, too, old enough to understand what was happening and their true relation to the man. Quickly, he took his place behind them, his hands on both their shoulders.\n\nThe three of them were always together — born close to each other, they shared the nursery, the beds, the tutors, the training swords and the mischief. For quite a long time, they were the only children of the Princess, three boys without a known father, and they had always been inseparable, much to the King’s satisfaction and their mother’s pride.\n\nAnd yet Aegon was still the eldest — should everything crumble here, it would be his duty to lead the charge against their adversaries and their mother’s opponents. While his younger brothers could allow themselves to be confused and worried, sad at the uncertainty of the future, Aegon’s lot was to be composed, standing there like a hawk ready to descend on the prey or as a dragon ready to attack.\n\n“Will anyone explain what on earth is happening here?!”\n\nEveryone turned to the Princess, following her with their gazes as she dashed to the bed and effortlessly climbed onto it, ignoring all the norms of propriety and sitting by their father’s side.\n\n“Oh, Rhaenyra,” the King spoke slowly, opening his eyes. Their fingers intertwined immediately, some silent communication going on through touch and staring, and Aegon’s breath hitched.\n\nFor so long, he had been observing them and trying to make sense of the way they lived — how they managed to navigate the rough waters of being royals under so much scrutiny, how they managed to thrive despite the cursed predicament they had found themselves in, tangled in passion and secrecy that had birthed Aegon and his siblings.\n\nHe had attempted to try this life on, imagining himself in the same position — but he immediately got dizzy at how shaky and unsteady the ground his parents walked was.\n\nIt truly required some mystical strength to keep dancing this dance for almost two decades, bathing in the blood of those who cast stones, returning all the grievances to them tenfold, and always finding ways to emerge victorious even against the unfavourable odds.\n\nAegon looked at his father — he was pale and breathing fast and unevenly, but he immediately looked healthier at the mere sight of his eldest child. Like a flower opening its petals at the warm rays of sunshine, the King seemed to find some new energy within himself, striving to conceal his weakness in front of her — or perhaps genuinely healed at her touch.\n\nThe way she seemed to rule this chamber, knowing this space, this bed intimately, the way she confidently made her way and sat by his side, her legs crossed, the way she leaned forward so their faces were extremely close — there was so much ineffable devotion transpiring between them that Aegon thought, not for the first time in his life, that the two of them had truly changed the world.\n\nNo one seemed surprised or bothered by her display of affection, by how she looked way more like a wife than like a daughter — over the years, people had to get used to it if they wanted to keep their heads. So many had died for as much as trying to deny them this happiness, and those who wanted to live had to acquiesce and give in under the weight of their uncrushable passion and love for each other.\n\nSomehow, the world seemed to have forgotten they were actually a father and a daughter — so used had they become to this manner of living: two apartments opposite each other, six children without apparent father but all resembling the King in their features.\n\nPerhaps, over the years, she had become Queen in their eyes — a wife to the King more than his daughter.\n\nAegon, too, often found himself forgetting that this man was supposed to be his grandsire, not a man who fathered him. In a moment like this, and in so many others, they looked just like a regular married couple would — someone deeply in love, sharing memories and dreams, laughing together and being there for each other with the familiarity and support of someone who had been through a lot together.\n\nBut the only people who never forgot about their true relationship, their first bond, were Aegon’s parents themselves. Many might think them a peaceful, regular couple despite the obvious wickedness of this union, but they never quite stopped being a father and a daughter.\n\nThe world had moved on — at least those who valued their lives.\n\nBut these two were still who they were — they simply refused to surrender those parts of their identities, refusing to think of themselves as someone they were not.\n\nNo, they were always honest with each other, always true to their nature. It was easier for everyone around them, Aegon included, to see them as normal, willingly ignoring the sinful part of their connection, but the King and his Princess seemed to revel in it, thriving in the bond that predated the one of lovers and parents.\n\nShe never referred to him as anything but Father, reminding everyone that she was his favourite in more sense than one, that she was too special to fit into another definition. She was not his Queen, not his wife — not in name, at the very least, but no one could deny she was his daughter.\n\nWhereas others sought to put all this aside, to mould them into something they all could comprehend and accept, the King and his daughter loved each other because of who they were — Aegon was old enough to understand that they fell in love with each other not despite their primary relationship but because of it.\n\nFor so long, they must have been quite lonely, the world offering them little comfort — no mirror like each other, and Aegon could easily understand how natural it was to fall in love with one’s reflection, especially as perfect and flawless as his parents both were.\n\nIt often made his heart flutter to see them simply look at each other — how his mother let her chin rest on her palm as she listened to their father, engrossed in whatever he had to say, completely focused on him and him only.\n\nAnd yet they were never excessively overt in their relationship, not flaunting it, not acting to attract any special attention. The occasional candid display of affection came not as showing off but as something they considered a given. All this was natural to them, and they did not need to show everyone most precious pieces of themselves, but neither would they deny their love, not anymore.\n\nHe remembered catching them once — despite their long-lasting affair being common knowledge for many years, they still exercised caution when it came to overt displays of love and passion. It was rare to catch a glimpse of them doing anything grossly inappropriate, for they did not enjoy having witnesses — but in private, they were as free as they could be.\n\nAegon had been unlucky to venture into the castle library after nightfall — having inherited the passion for reading from both his parents, he struggled to sleep and wished to pick a book to entertain himself. Aged no more than four-and-ten, he was unaware of what he could involuntarily witness — and it was just a brief moment, a short scene he saw through the loosely closed door before turning away and returning to his bed.\n\nBut he would never forget what he saw — it was not the lechery itself that was etched into his brain and haunting him, a disturbing sight no child should be privy to, but the way they did it, how right it seemed to him even then. Joined as one, his mother’s legs around the King’s hips, they moved together, and her fingers were in their father’s hair — so similar to how she comforted him, her son, and yet so endlessly different, too, for it carried a distinctive meaning.\n\nThere had always been hands held discreetly under the dinner table or the pecks on the cheek she always offered her father, her lips sometimes lingering, but never betraying anything unforgivingly indecent. There had been hugs and strands of hair tucked behind her ear, something that spoke of fatherly pride more than lust. Aegon was no stranger to his parents touching each other whenever they could, sharing warmth, following each other with their eyes, but this was different.\n\nJust a glimpse of their shared ardour was enough for Aegon to understand why they had ordered the Holdfast rebuilt, why they always sought to hide, to shoo the entire world away — it was not shame or modesty driving them, for they had no qualms with perusing the castle library for such an activity, but the need to create something for themselves, just a father and a daughter, not a King and his heir.\n\nBehind the doors of the royal quarters, with curtains drawn and crowns taken off, they reverted to their first status — the original one, the essential one, far more important than titles and obligations of the outside world. They had created six children together, another opportunity to build something that was only theirs.\n\nNow, she was sitting in the King’s bed, her hand on his forehead like he was another babe of hers catching a fever, and Aegon watched the scene unfold with some kind of bizarre adoration.\n\nThe mood in the room seemed different now, too. When Aegon ran to fetch his mother, everyone was almost ready to go into mourning, the expressions solemn and grim. Terror in Baelon’s and Aemon’s eyes, confusion written all over the maesters’ faces, unnatural paleness of his father’s skin — all that, Aegon would not forget, and yet it appeared to have evaporated.\n\nAs soon as his mother entered the room, the sun seemed to start shining more brightly, some kind of hope blooming where only heavy sighs had previously been.\n\nAegon could only pray that one day he would grow to fill not only his father’s shoes, but his mother’s as well — once again, he looked at her and thought that there had never been a woman more remarkable than her.\n\nNo one was so strong, so determined, so perfect.\n\nThere used to be days he resented his parents for giving him a life like this — forever tainted by the mark of forbidden love, marred by sin, Aegon thought it was a curse to be a child of such a depraved union. He loved them both, looking up to them in everything, but at the same time, the knowledge that he was illegitimate, that he was seen as his mother’s weakness, as a crime, hurt.\n\nHe never mustered the courage to ask either of them why they had done this to him and his siblings — but then, he grew and started to see it, in every touch and smile, in crinkling eyes and smirks hidden behind goblets.\n\nBeing a man himself now, he could very well understand his father — try as one might, it was impossible to find a woman who would match his mother in beauty and sharpness of wits. Every inch of her skin was always white and perfect, and even if some called the days of her youth bygones, she was still gorgeous, easily blinding everyone in the room with her dazzling charms.\n\nAegon had even gone as far as imagining himself with her, taking the King’s place by her side and her bed — he would be mortified to admit this to anyone, but in the days of his early adolescence, he could close his eyes and play the imaginary game of pretend. After all, he would think, almost bitterly, she was not only his mother but his half-sister as well — and it was perfectly normal for Targaryens to intermarry.\n\nAnd besides, if a father could lay with his daughter, why could he not picture himself with his mother? How was that any different from what his parents had committed, crossing the line all the same?\n\nHowever, he could never really imagine himself by her side in any capacity but as her son. She was beautiful, and Aegon had seen many women in his eight-and-ten years, but no one came even close to her. Still, he knew that they would never turn their bond into something else, would never grow into anything more than a mother and a son.\n\nSo, he concluded, it was not possible for it to happen to everyone or on a whim — it must really be their destiny to love each other so deeply, and thus he had grown to be proud of his parents, too, for they had defied the whole world for the freedom to love and be together.\n\nOther couples could do it freely — it seemed deeply unfair to Aegon that his parents should be limited in any way, and he was glad that they had ignored the whispers and the accusations, giving him and five other children lives.\n\nHe had heard people call him a bastard — even though the word had been forgotten for quite some time now. It used to hurt, and for the longest time, he could not understand why anyone would hurl this harmful word at him — not when his dragon egg hatched, not when he had Targaryen features, not when he was every inch a Prince.\n\nThen, he grew and found out that this word was the only weapon their enemies had against their family. They were helpless to do anything but levy these accusations, and they became a laughable matter to Aegon.\n\nHe did not mind being his mother’s bastard — he was the King’s as well, after all, and he thought there was pride to be found in such a status. He smiled, almost waiting for someone to lose their mind and call him this slur now — Aegon would not hesitate to run his sword through someone should they be stupid enough to insult him or his siblings.\n\nThey were the only bastards in history to bear the Targaryen name — and Aegon was mature enough to understand that being born outside of wedlock like that was an honour, not a shame.\n\nHe and his siblings were born out of immense love — something not many other children could boast.\n\nThe maester’s firm voice took Aegon out of his musing, forcing him to look at the man in grey.\n\n“We believe it is His Grace’s heart, Your Highness,” he began, his hands clasped in front of him. “Sometimes, with age, its function deteriorates, and the fall can be attributed to the — ”\n\n“The fall?” She interrupted him, still entirely focused on the King, smiling at him.\n\n“Do not listen to him, Rhaenyra,” their father grumbled, gently caressing her knuckles with his thumb. Even in the moment of weakness, when everyone thought him gravely ill, he seemed to only care about her, not the maesters, not the councilmen waiting for him to either die abruptly or recover. “It was nothing, and I am not sure what all this fuss is about.”\n\nShe chuckled and shook her head — there was no sign of anxiety in her beautiful features, and Aegon straightened his back, once again feeling an influx of confidence rushing through his veins.\n\nIf his mother was calm and untroubled, then so should he — if the strongest man in the world said it was nothing, then he had to believe him.\n\n“Your Grace,” the maester almost implored. “You said you had difficulty breathing, and the Princes saw you — ”\n\n“Now, now,” the King raised his hand. “There is no need to paint the picture in such vivid colours. I am sure the Princess has got the gist of it by now.”\n\nEveryone turned to her then, seemingly waiting for her reaction or instructions. Still calm and composed, she hummed, looking at her father attentively, and then turned to the maids.\n\n“I will need lots of bark from white willow trees, as much as you can find on short notice. Bring it to me; do not bother with powdering it. This — and wild mint, again, as much as you can get.”\n\nThe servants bowed and scurried out of the room — accustomed to the Princess’ authority, they did not need the King’s approval for this simple task, knowing full well he would simply tell them to obey his daughter unequivocally.\n\n“Your Highness, what are you doing?” The maester asked as she took a pillow and helped the King sit in bed. “What does bark have to do with anything?”\n\n“I will brew it and add mint,” she said, not gracing the men with even a quick glance. “I thought it was rather obvious, but if you thought I would chew on it or weave leaves into my hair, then I am happy to assure you I will not.”\n\nAegon heard Baelon let out a chuckle and squeezed his shoulder harder.\n\n“This is sorcery! Surely, you cannot be possibly thinking — ”\n\n“Pardon me, Grand Maester, but I do not care about what you are thinking at all. We are doing it my way, and you may call it sorcery, but I call it simple herbalism.”\n\n“There are leeches being readied to help with His Grace’s blood pressure, and we have reached a consensus — ”\n\nFinally, his mother seemed to have had enough. Aegon knew this expression well — the roll of her eyes, lips tightly pursed together for a split second before she snarled:\n\n“You may put the leeches on your fat arses if you are so fond of them. Now, clear the room, all of you!”\n\nAegon’s breath hitched at her command — he was not surprised that she was angry at the court physicians, considering everything their family had been through, but he had not quite expected this ferocity.\n\nMaybe she was unsettled and worried, after all, her anxiety turning to anger in need to find an outlet.\n\n“Do as she says,” the King said. “She is your Princess and is quite adept in these matters, so let her do it.”\n\nEveryone could see that the maesters still wished to protest — after all, it was customary for a monarch to be cared for by them, the sagacious, educated men who had spent years in training, attending the Citadel and earning their links. To spurn them and trust the Princess, who was dabbling in potions and herbalism in her free time, was an insult.\n\nBut Aegon’s father was King — and he could do whatever he wanted.\n\nIt was true that their mother was fond of herbs and brews, often spending long evenings secluded in the library. Sometimes, Aegon and his brothers sneaked in, to simply watch her as she read something and took notes, her personal records always kept in her room for her use only.\n\nTheir father commissioned her books from across the Narrow Sea and often had to come into the library himself as she was doing the long hours, forgetting herself and the passage of time while lost in the myriad of ingredients and creating her own descriptions of remedies.\n\nThe court vilified her for that as well — countless times, Aegon’s mother had been accused of dabbling in dark arts, of crafting poison, of killing their opponents with shadows and spells. Seen as a witch, she instilled primal fear in many people, but Aegon knew the truth.\n\nShe was no witch, no sorceress — just a studious woman who had dedicated a lot of time to prevent the repetition of a tragedy that had almost killed them.\n\n***\n\n“What are you doing, Mother?” He asked, tugging on her dress. He wanted her to take him to Dragonpit to spend time with Stormcloud, but she appeared busy, standing by the table and examining the leaves and flowers brought into the room by the servants hours ago.\n\nAegon preferred animals over plants, so he could not quite comprehend why his mother was so busy with weeds when she could be going to see Syrax and Stormcloud with him.\n\nShe turned to him and smiled brightly. “Those are my ingredients, lovely boy.”\n\n“Ingridients for what?”\n\nHis mother put down the flower she was holding and crouched in front of him, taking his face in her delicate hands.\n\n“There is power, my dearest, to be found in flowers in weeds, in something we see in the garden every day, and in something that can only be found deep in the forest. One needs to know the secrets of nature to defend herself and her family.”\n\n“Why?”\n\nHe often asked her that question — about her working with plants, about her not having another baby after Aemon, about the colour of the sky and the salty taste of seawater. He was curious, always inquiring about everything around him — and his mother never ceased to indulge him, answering his every question with patience and a warm smile.\n\nA shadow briefly appeared on her beautiful face, and she frowned. Aegon wanted to frown, too, copying his mother’s expression, but she patted him on the head and then lifted him with some effort — he was no longer a little boy, after all, the King often said that — and held him over the table.\n\nThis way, he could better see the plants she had on display — flowers of different colours, leaves of different shapes, tree bark and some mushrooms, all waiting for her on a piece of white cloth, separated and arranged into some kind of system only she understood.\n\n“This,” she began, pointing with her free hand at the violet flower lying the closest to them, “is a hyacinth, my love. It looks pleasing, does it not? But these bulbs, when rubbed for long, can make one’s skin burn.”\n\nAegon listened to her carefully, hungry for her every word. He wanted to touch the flower, but at the same time, he was scared it would make him burn, and he gulped instead.\n\n“There is charcoal,” his mother continued, nodding at familiar lumps of black he and Baelon used to draw on parchment. “Those are not plants, but they are helpful nonetheless. Should one ingest poison, charcoal can be used to clear their stomachs and save their lives. Nature offers protection, my love, and one will never be defenceless if they know its secrets.”\n\nHe had heard many times about the need to be careful, to always step out of his room with a guard, but he was still too young to properly grasp the concept of danger.\n\nTo him, it was unthinkable someone would want to harm him, his mother or his brothers. They had the King watch over them, and the white knights offered their lives for them, and Aegon had not learned the hazards and perils of the world yet.\n\n“I want you and your brothers to be safe,” she added, putting him back on the floor. “And this is why I study. I started right after your birth, and this has grown into a deep interest of mine.”\n\n“Why?”\n\nShe sighed — but it was not annoyance speaking in her but something else, something too dark for Aegon to understand. He played with a button on his smock as she sat opposite him on the ground, using her legs as a pillow.\n\n“Because, my love, there are many people who wish us harm: you, me, the King, Baelon and Aemon. They are angry and evil, and do not love us at all.” She took a deep breath before continuing, as if assessing something in his reaction. “When you were very little, still in my belly, someone tried to kill us both, you and me.”\n\nAegon blinked, confused as to why anyone would want to do something as horrible as kill them.\n\n“Why?”\n\nHis mother grabbed his hand and squeezed it slightly. “You are the future King of the Seven Kingdoms, my darling boy. A day will come that you will sit on the Iron Throne — after me, after I die. Some do not want either you or me to ever wear the crown, and they will stop at nothing to tear us apart, to break us. You must never let them harm you or your brothers, do you understand, Aegon?”\n\nShe was looking at him attentively, her voice firm, and he had no choice but to nod. He knew he was a Prince, his mother’s firstborn, that he was in line to the throne. The thought of ever ending up on it was sad, though, for he did not wish for the King or his mother to die — he loved them both so much, and it was unsettling for a young boy to think of death. If he were to become King, it would mean that they were both dead, and Aegon was not sure he could bear it.\n\nStill, he wanted to be brave, so he tried to smile at her.\n\n“Yes, Mother.”\n\n“The King and I will do everything to protect you, my love. But you must also do your part — by being vigilant and careful, never trusting strangers, never taking any food or drink from them.”\n\nIt was one of her lessons that sounded almost scary at times, the way she expected him to understand the matters that meant little to him, but as Aegon grew and learned, more and more things started to make sense to him, his mother’s interest in poisons and antidotes, too.\n\n***\n\nLater, he learned about the assassination attempt in all the grisly details — how she had been poisoned while pregnant, how only a miracle saved them both, and swift thinking from their father, which did not allow the poison to spread. Aegon watched Corlys Velaryon die, years after the cruel act the man had ordered — the Princess waited and waited, wanting to be the one to make the arrogant lord pay.\n\nThere were others, too — his uncle’s wife, seemingly growing mad and telling everyone who would listen that her gown was strangling and burning her. Emerald-coloured silk clung to her skin as she was escorted out of the dining hall, writhing in the arms of the guards, and the rumour had it that her pampered skin was covered in ulcers and blisters when she was finally undressed.\n\nAegon knew it was his mother’s doing as well — a payback for earlier torment, for the way Alicent Hightower dared to call him and his brothers abominations.\n\nHis mother did not like to talk to them about it, keeping her secrets and preserving their innocence, but Aegon did not need her words to be in awe of her powers and knowledge.\n\nThe Princess did not speak to the dark gods or evil spirits, for she had the power of nature on her side, and Aegon sighed in relief as he looked at his parents again. If his mother knew what to do, how to treat their father, then there was no need to worry just yet.\n\nThe men had to obey, leaving the room with their heads low, mumbling something under their noses, angry at the Princess who, in their opinion, had overstepped again. Aegon did not bother straining his ears to catch the substantial part of the murmur — over the course of his life, he had heard it all already, accusations towards his mother spilling out of men and women day and night.\n\nThe three of them lingered in the room, not quite sure if their mother’s order to clear the room extended to them. They were family, but perhaps they had to step out as well, allowing their parents to discuss what happened in private.\n\nTheir father turned to them first and offered them a smile.\n\n“You may go, boys. Everything will be fine here.”\n\n“Do you promise?” Aemon asked, unable to stop himself, shifting on his feet, something urging him to dash towards his father, but the peculiar sense of danger stopped him.\n\n“Of course,” the King said with a warm smile. If not for his slow movements and pale skin, one would not even think him ill. “Now go and finish your practice.”\n\nAegon thought it ridiculous to return to the training yard after they had seen their father get out of breath and practically collapse, dropping his sword, but he appreciated the confidence in his father’s voice. It was a much-needed comfort — his suggestion to go back to their steady routines, to their organised lives.\n\nIt made it look like nothing was out of the ordinary, like it was just a temporary blunder, a mistake that was easy to fix and move on from.\n\nTheir mother turned to them as well, her lips stretched in a benign smile. She nodded at the door gently and spoke softly:\n\n“Go check on your brothers and sister, my dears. I will take it all from here.”\n\nAegon nodded — feeling like a child once again, he smiled involuntarily, coddled in this intimate comfort of having his parents tell him everything was going to be alright, that there was nothing to worry about.\n\nHe wondered if this would ever cease — he was a man in everyone’s eyes, but somehow, he never stopped feeling like a boy in front of them, as if his mother and father possessed some special magic to freeze him in time, preserve him as blameless and peaceful as they could.\n\n***\n\nOnce the doors shut behind the boys, Daemon shifted on the bed and exhaled loudly.\n\nHe did not feel as bad as they all made it sound and look — he certainly was not dying, and all this fuss was more exhausting than that unfortunate incident during training.\n\nHe could not understand why everyone got so agitated all of a sudden, and he definitely had not wished for Rhaenyra to be distracted from her peaceful routine of checking on the children and tending to day-to-day matters of ruling the castle. His daughter was busy as it was, and tearing her from their daughter’s embrace was not what he had planned or authorised.\n\nBut as they heard the click of the heavy door, Rhaenyra’s eyes immediately glistened, and she surged forward to claim his lips in a feverish, passionate kiss.\n\nWell, Daemon had to admit it was difficult to breathe, at least to an extent, and his heart started beating faster again, making the tension in his chest palpable. Still, it made him feel better immediately, and he held onto his daughter’s hips as she moved away from him just barely, their foreheads touching.\n\n“Now, Father, there are other ways to call me into your bed. There was no need for all this.”\n\nHe rolled his eyes and grunted. Never had he imagined being scolded by his own daughter, but if anyone in the world had the right to tease the King, it was certainly her.\n\n“I do not know what they are all on about, darling,” he grumbled. “It is simply embarrassing, the way they all swarmed me immediately and made it look like I was about to die right there.”\n\nRhaenyra smiled, her hand travelling to caress his cheek. “You did scare Aegon. He could barely contain tears as he found me, our sweet boy.”\n\nDaemon thought about his son who had volunteered to summon his mother — hardly prepared to be the bearer of the worst news, he must have felt awful for disturbing her like that, words heavy on his tongue.\n\nAegon was a sweet boy indeed — a man in the eyes of the realm, carrying a sword, attending the small council, learning to play a more active role in Westerosi politics, but a boy nonetheless. His features might have matured, and he was now towering over his own mother, growing tall and strong as an oak, but his heart was still soft and light — those of his brothers even more so, and Daemon smiled.\n\nSomehow, through all these calamitous years, they had managed to create and nurture children who were quite perfect — and could remain children for a little longer, for Daemon did not plan to die any time soon.\n\nIt was untimely, all this — Daemon wished he could turn the clock back and change something, skip the training or not pretend nothing was wrong when he first felt the pressure in his chest. He had thought it was just a night of bad, uncomfortable sleep, and when he felt the pain spread into his left shoulder, he did not think about it much either, up until he struggled to breathe and felt sweat rolling down his forehead with unusual intensity.\n\nAnd then, yes, he dropped the sword, alerting everyone, for it was not a regular sight to see the King lose grip on his ancestral weapon.\n\nNow Rhaenyra had to know about the whole debacle — Daemon could not blame his son for rushing to tell her, but at the same time, he could not help but wish all this had played out differently. Aegon did not have much experience with death, always fiercely protected by his parents, so it was no wonder their son got terrified of what was to come. Thus was the duality of being a firstborn — there was a heavy burden of responsibility, the acute realisation that the future of this family depended on him, but also the deep desire to postpone the inevitable, to remain a child for a little longer.\n\nBecause childhood did not end with the first trip to a brothel, with a knighthood, marriage or sixteenth nameday. Childhood lasted for as long as one’s parents were still there, ready to open their arms and welcome one into their embrace, taking all the pain and worries away.\n\nTheir children were lucky — they had been growing up with a mother and a father, and one day, they would realise the gravity and the extent of sacrifices that had been made to ensure their safety.\n\nPerhaps it was some kind of vindication finally finding them — in that case, Daemon was grateful it was he who got struck by divine vengeance. There was no denying that he was getting older and weaker, and even without the merciless sand of age slipping through the hourglass, it had been mostly him committing sins for the benefit of his family.\n\n“Have I upset you?”\n\nThey intertwined their fingers again, and Rhaenyra chuckled. “Upset me, Father? Never.”\n\nIt was true that while their sons seemed genuinely scared that he might actually die just like that, Rhaenyra seemed composed and unbothered by the display of his feebleness. The room was filled with the air of uncertainty and premature grief as the guards helped him into his bed, as maesters and councilmen stormed in, but the moment his daughter crossed the threshold, the sun seemed to come out again, illuminating the room and chasing away all the gloom.\n\nSome believed her a witch, cursing her name for what she had done to their enemies over the years — and perhaps she was, Daemon mused, for she seemed to heal him by her very presence, his beautiful, intelligent girl.\n\nOr perhaps that was simply love, undying and overpowering everything, even mending the failures of his ageing heart.\n\n“But you will have to do as I tell you, Father,” Rhaenyra continued, moving away and adjusting the blanket as if he were another one of her children in need of tucking in. “I meant what I said earlier.”\n\nHe wanted to scoff at how ridiculous she made it all look. Daemon did not like how he felt, did not like this burning ache in his chest, but it was dwindling already, and it was easier to breathe.\n\nHe was six-and-fifty — it was perhaps expected to experience some troubles with health, and he did not want them to mar his life and legacy. He had little desire to die miserable, one malady after another eating him from inside, dimming his inner fire until it could no longer be sustained — so if he had to die, he would much rather do it quickly, without the pain of having his whole family gathered around him and weeping as he let out his last troubled breath.\n\nHowever, Daemon also knew it was not yet time — this was an unfortunate accident, and he absolutely had more years in him, more things to do and marks to leave.\n\nSee the birth of his youngest child, for one.\n\nSo he rolled his eyes and pursed his lips, annoyed that his daughter had to waste her time taking care of him, but then, he nodded.\n\n“Whatever my Princess commands me.”\n\nShe stared at him for a couple of long seconds, and then her eyes crinkled, and she erupted with laughter, covering her mouth with the back of her hand.\n\nDaemon watched her with a gentle smile, proud of his flirtatious remark and the fact that he could still make her laugh so easily. Rhaenyra looked younger when she laughed like that, her eyes twinkling and the trill of her laughter melodic.\n\nIt was impossible to ignore the truth — they both had changed, but perhaps it was the difference between growing up and ageing. Rhaenyra was still blooming, still growing into her more mature features, girlish beauty giving way to the one of an actual woman, a mother, while still finding ways to manifest in carefree laughs like this, in the curl of her smirk, in the grace of her fluid movements when she danced.\n\nAge was a privilege, Daemon had learned a long time ago. Watching his own daughter grow and grow, from a wailing infant into a child, into a maiden, into a mother — he was lucky to witness every change in her, to hold her hand through all these stages of life.\n\nWherever she went, whatever she did, she always turned around and saw him. Her first steps, their children’s first steps — he had always been there, and he would still be, for years to come.\n\nNo matter the odd palpations of his heart.\n\n“I am serious, Father,” she said, gently smacking his shoulder. “Do not even think about disobeying my authority.”\n\nHe raised his hands. “Here? I do not recall ever disobeying you when you are in my bed, darling.”\n\nOr at all, for that matter — the bed was just decoration, and Daemon had been compelled to follow her every command, to obey her every wish, since she was a babe. Her desires grew with her, and this was precisely how he found himself having six more children, with another one on the way.\n\nShe wished for a son — he had given her one.\n\nShe then wished for a spare, then for another one. Then, she missed the weight of a newborn child in her arms. Then, she wished for a daughter.\n\nAnd Daemon never refused her a thing, especially not something as sweet and precious as this.\n\nRhaenyra pushed his hair from his forehead and frowned. “Can you believe they wanted to treat you with leeches? Leeches, Father! What do they even study in their Citadel?”\n\nHe smiled, watching the pout of her lips and the flickers of irritation in her eyes. Daemon trusted her unconditionally, and he would always pick her methods over whatever the old men in grey clothes had to offer — simply because Rhaenyra could never wish him harm. Everything she did, everything she had learned was for the benefit of their family, and taking a potion from her hands would always be easy.\n\nMany doubted her skill. Whereas some believed her to be a wicked witch, capable of killing men with a mere thought, some scoffed at her endeavours and knowledge, thinking that a royal woman was too stupid to comprehend the secrets of nature and tame it. Knowledge like this was for the studious men, they said, not for a spoilt Princess.\n\nBut Daemon could never question her powers — not after Alicent Hightower clawed at her lavish emerald dress at the feast, claiming it was killing her, her skin burning; not after Lord Corlys writhed on the floor, living up to his monicker, and she simply watched all this happen from her place at the high table.\n\nSince that damned day of her attempted poisoning, she had only grown in power, finding ways to fight for this family with more than just her looks.\n\nDaemon had trained her to be a weapon — he had envisioned her seducing men and discarding them effortlessly, learning their secrets and winning their loyalty, making them clash and lose their minds over her. Back then, the plan seemed impersonal — she was his daughter, after all, and he was supposed to let go of her one way or another.\n\nUntil he learned that he did not want to let go of her.\n\nUntil he learned that her place was not in someone else’s bed but in his.\n\nBut Rhaenyra remained his deadliest weapon, having evolved and trained herself to be way more than a pretty face and an alluring body. Terrified for the life of her son and herself by extension, she bounced back — but also gained in ruthlessness and confidence. His daughter had never been stupid, her mind always working restlessly on solutions to their problems, but she turned into someone truly brilliant that fateful night.\n\nAnd yes, her revenge took time — she had to learn, to polish her skill, to make mistakes and try again, but eventually, everyone who had wished for their son to die ended up paying the price.\n\nIf her hands could administer death, they could also soothe and heal, and so Daemon trusted her more than he could trust any healer.\n\nSomeone knocked on the door, and Rhaenyra told them to come in, rising from the bed. Daemon immediately missed her weight on the mattress, her soft touch and warm smile — but he knew she would be back, wrapping them both in a familiar, intimate haze.\n\nIt was a good idea to separate their apartments from the rest of the castle even further — additional walls were like a shield to their love and warm comfort. They had to surrender the secret to protect it better — there was no hiding once he had issued an order to rebuild this part of the Red Keep — but this way, they felt safer and more relaxed in their love. No one trespassed here, and Rhaenyra was always close, too.\n\nEven now, it was immediately easier to breathe once all the bystanders had left their chambers. Daemon was rather sure the crowd had contributed to him feeling worse, and he could not wait to simply hide behind the thick walls with his daughter, letting her do her part and brew potions and tonics for him.\n\nShe took the supplies out of the servants hands, thanking them for being swift with following her orders. They had also brought hot water already, and Rhaenyra made her way to the table by the window, setting everything there.\n\nHe watched her steep the plants with hot water, steam rising from the cup. Rhaenyra carefully stirred the mixture, and as Daemon watched her work, he smiled again.\n\nOne of them to wield the sword and strike with brutal force — and the other to bring more discreet pain or rid one of it. They did match even in this, complementing and enhancing each other. Both violent, for there was nothing soft about murder, and both kind, for at times, a swing of a sword was merciful, but sometimes, it was knowledge of how to put a person to sweet sleep that was a sign of respect and love.\n\nDaemon knew, deep inside, that most likely, he would die by her hand — not because she hated him, but because she loved him. One day, he would grow too old, too frail, would become a true burden to her and her cause, no longer a fierce defender. Aegon and Baelon were quite grown already and would only mature further; other boys would follow swiftly. She would have her small army of robust, mighty lads to defend her, and the trembling hands of old father would no longer offer her much.\n\nWhen the death started winning, he would ask Rhaenyra to be quick and merciful. Perhaps she would protest, teary-eyed, refusing to see reason, but perhaps she would know that some things could not be salvaged. Then, she would brew or mix something, just like she did now, and bring it to his lips. Daemon would drink willingly, knowing he had fulfilled his purpose in this life.\n\nBut until that day of inevitable farewell came, he strove to live.\n\nThere was still so much he had to do — see their younger children ride dragons, train Daeron and Gaemon at arms, and watch Visenya grow into a beauty second only to her mother. He needed to know that this seventh child of theirs was also healthy and well-adjusted, and, if Daemon was honest, he also hoped for grandchildren in the future.\n\nIn the eyes of the realm, he already had six — fatherless children birthed by an audacious, lecherous Princess who ignored every convention, every tradition, all to feed her lust. It had long become an open secret — every Rhaenyra’s child bore his features, and one could be willingly oblivious or obtuse enough to call it strong grandsire’s blood, but the majority of people surrounding them had figured it out a long time ago.\n\nThose who were particularly loud in their dissatisfaction had lost their tongues, lands and lives. Daemon had seen to strongholds being devastated by dragon fire at the mere suggestion that Princess Rhaenyra was disgracing the throne and the gods by her behaviour — and it had bore fruit. People had got used to the idea that this was the way things were done — those children were royal head to toe, Targaryen through and through, and no rebels, no saints could stop them.\n\nTheir six children never knew the actual taint of bastardy, born with royal titles and names, five Princes and one Princess from the very start. His authority was enough to quell all the rumours, even if it took years to root all the animosity and acrimony out.\n\nRhaenyra was no less fierce about protecting their hatchlings — there had been attempts and plots, fools thinking they could kill Daemon’s children, be it in their beds or in Rhaenyra’s womb. Some had dared say the boys and the girl never deserved to be born, cursed from the moment of their conception, but those whispers usually ended poorly for the reckless gossipers.\n\nSometimes, Daemon wondered if there was merit to their words. After all, he and Rhaenyra had doomed their children to an eternity of hearsay and unkind stares, to a myriad of enemies who wanted them dead. It pained him to see this realisation in the eyes of his sons, namely in Aegon’s, for the boy had survived a murder attempt even before he was born, and the shadow of it seemed to always haunt him, making the lad desperate to protect his younger siblings at all costs.\n\nHowever, he always believed they had given their children a life of joy. Daemon remembered fondly all those days of watching Rhaenyra play with her firstborn, how happy she looked to be Aegon’s mother. Back then, it was all new for her, but she always smiled at their boy, always offered him her best even when she was shaken by fear and grief — and Daemon knew their eldest son was her main pride since his very first breath, since the night he survived inside her despite the odds.\n\nIt was wrong to have favourites, and yet they all had them.\n\nDaemon’s favourite child would always be Rhaenyra — and he might feel it was unfair towards his younger children, but it simply could not change, no matter how many babes they had. Rhaenyra might have given him a dozen, and he would still love her the most.\n\nSome things were definitely written in the stars, impossible to change.\n\nWhen Rhaenyra finished mixing the herbs and ingredients together, she came back to his bed and sat on its edge, holding the cup of hot liquid in her hands. Daemon was ready to take it out of her hands, but she shook her head.\n\n“Are you going to drink it just like that? Without asking me first about its contents?”\n\nDaemon smirked. “You have announced them already, love — white willow bark, mint, a touch of your unique talent — ”\n\n“But how would you know what it does?” His daughter persisted, blowing on the cup to cool the brew down a little more. “What if it is a potion to ensnare you, make you a thrall to my charms?”\n\nHe laughed through the tension in his chest. “Do you not think it is a little too late for that, darling?”\n\nHer eyes were bright, warm fire of amethyst burning in them — he knew that she liked the sense of power she held over him, the way he always obeyed her and granted her favours with remarkable ease.\n\nShe might be a woman in her thirties now, but to Daemon, she would always be a little girl, a child who deserved all the best things in the world.\n\nAfter all, it was not that different to the bygone days of her childhood — when she played games, creating stories in her head and pretending to be different people. Rhaenyra had imagined herself a Queen, a goddess, a warrior, an archer, a maester, even, cutting the limbs off her rag dolls and then sewing them back in sloppy stitches.\n\nSometimes, those games involved her father — he was usually too busy to spend an entire day with her, but he always found at least a few hours of his time to dedicate to Rhaenyra without interruptions. Then, she would tell him about the game she was playing right now, showing him her dolls and assigning each a role and a name. He would do his best to listen and be involved, adding his input to enrich the story, and his girl beamed when he played along, travelling with her into the imaginary worlds.\n\nThen, she grew, and so did their games — she was no longer playing with porcelain and rag dolls, with glass figurines and wooden blocks, but with real people, showing them off to her father all the same, making them dance to her tunes and stick to their roles — should they be displeased, she grimaced and ran to the King, for it did not matter if she was six or six-and-ten.\n\nRhaenyra always liked him playing with her — and even though Daemon had given her plenty of toys, including living, breathing ones, she always preferred his company over being surrounded by dolls.\n\nHe could easily imagine this being just another game of theirs — with him being her newest doll, tucked in bed safely as she was tending to him, crafting a story about him being sick and needing care. It was better this way, Daemon mused, to treat all this as a game of pretend, of something unreal, made up in her bright mind.\n\nShe brought the cup to his lips, but he caught her wrist before she could urge him to open his mouth.\n\n“Do not be ridiculous, Rhaenyra. I can drink on my own — you are making me look like a feeble old man.”\n\nHis daughter smiled and shook her head. “No one is watching, Father, if this is what you are worried about. Let me care for you. Please.”\n\n‘Please’ was not a common word in her vocabulary — usually spoken only in borderline whining in bed, breathing heavily under him, but rarely in any other situation. She was a Targaryen Princess, and she never asked — she commanded.\n\nWith him, however, Rhaenyra seemed to remember this word even outside the context of lust and lechery. Perhaps it was because he was still her King, having more power than her, or because he was her father — his parental authority meant something to her, even if they had eroded all the pillars of relationships between parents and children.\n\nAnd so he was helpless when confronted with such a plea — just a simple word, something children were supposed to learn at an early age to appear polite and deferential, yet so special on Rhaenyra’s lips.\n\nYet another word reserved for him only — not for their children, not for their subjects, not for her former lovers.\n\n“Fine,” he grumbled. “But only because you want this, not because I cannot take care of myself.”\n\nRhaenyra smirked and helped him drink. Daemon knew she loved being a mother, and sometimes, these maternal instincts and urges resurfaced with him as well, no matter how odd it was.\n\nBut they were an unconventional family — a daughter being a wife, a grandson being the firstborn son, a mother being a sister. What was so strange about her growing into all the roles simultaneously, blending them together and making them one and the same?\n\n“This will help with your heart,” she promised, her voice hopeful. “And soon enough, we will forget about this misfortune once and for all.”\n\nDaemon was ready to forget and move on now — he had enough of all this attention and commotion making him feel older than he actually was. Even if he had allowed Rhaenyra to tend to him this way, he could not shake off the feeling that it was unnecessary and pointless — he surely could hold a cup on his own.\n\nBut he had dropped the sword, he thought bitterly. His hands trembled, for the first time in his life, enough to lose his grip on Dark Sister and embarrass himself in front of his sons and other knights training in the yard.\n\nWhat if he dropped the cup as well? What if Rhaenyra thought he was incapable of holding anything firmly anymore?\n\nShe could read his dissatisfaction in his deep scowl, so she squeezed his hand and smiled.\n\n“Do you remember how you treated me after Aegon was born? I could eat and drink on my own as well; I had maids to bathe me, and yet you did not allow anyone to be close to me — how is this any different, Father?”\n\nIt was vastly different, in Daemon’s opinion. His daughter had been poisoned, and they were still on a hunt for the culprit back then — he could not afford any danger to come at her again. She had survived that poisoning attempt, and so did Aegon — but no one was allowed into her chamber, not even her trusted maids, and Daemon remembered spending every night by her side, sword on his lap, fully prepared to fight anyone who would dare cross the threshold of her room.\n\nWhen she gave birth, she was weak and had to learn everything about herself all over again, everything about her body rearranged — it was difficult for her to even rise from the bed, and of course, he had to tend to her. As her father, as the father to the child she had birthed — he had an absolute duty to her, and it pained him to see her mistrustful of everyone, everyone but him.\n\nChildbirth was way more difficult and serious than this — but Daemon had let her play mother to him already, so he could not make her stop, not with her stubbornness.\n\nThe brew was not tasty, too bitter for Daemon’s liking, so maybe he would ask her to add a dollop of honey the next time she prepared it for him, but he did not complain. He had tasted worse things in his lifetime, and he was no petulant child to throw tantrums over the taste of the remedy.\n\nThat was for their Visenya.\n\nOnce he downed the cup, he sighed with relief because this display of weakness could be over now. Rhaenyra put it on the nightstand, having made sure every last drop had been drunk.\n\n“This should work just fine,” she promised again — and Daemon thought that she was trying to reassure herself more than him, for it really sounded like an attempt to affirm her own faith. “And if it does not, we will have to wait to try something else.”\n\nHe raised an eyebrow, wondering what exactly she meant, but Rhaenyra grinned cheekily and continued:\n\n“Just will have to wait for the milk to come in — that would certainly work like a charm, and you will be very eager for the treatment.”\n\nShe had no right to tease him with things so sweet, not when there were still moons before he could taste it again, the gift of her body that was absolutely driving him insane. Daemon did not really remember how they descended into the pit of this particular perversion, as some would call it, but it had certainly become one of his favourite things about Rhaenyra’s pregnancies.\n\nHe had made his peace with the fact that they were done with children and the clandestine activity both, with Visenya weaned and outgrowing the comfort of her mother’s breast, but they seemed to have got another chance to experience this unique sensation.\n\nDaemon was loath to think about the toll the stress of today was taking on Rhaenyra’s body and the child growing inside her. She should be the one getting all the care and attention, not offering it so freely to others, and he knew that he should send her away, should tell her to leave the matters to other people and get some rest herself — but he could not, not really.\n\nFirstly, because she would not listen. Rhaenyra was too headstrong and never enjoyed being told what to do, so he could not expect her to comply now. His daughter also would never trust another person to take care of him, and she might be insolent and bratty, her capriciousness knowing no limits, but she was deeply devoted to him, and she would never choose herself over being with him.\n\nIt was wrong, it really was — no parent should take so much space in their child’s heart, and yet Daemon was selfishly proud that he did.\n\nThe pain of thinking he had lost her all those years ago had waned, but he never stopped feeling unreasonably elated that his daughter always chose him.\n\n“I would not dare steal from the little one,” Daemon replied, licking his lips. “They would need it way more than your old, feeble father who cannot even drink himself.”\n\nShe snorted and shook her head. “Ah, yes, so very old. The last time you called yourself such, you ended up knocking me up, and even the tea was powerless to root your seed out.”\n\nDaemon shrugged and grinned, folding his arms behind his head. It was a point of pride that he still had it in him — even though this child of theirs was an accident, completely unplanned for and coming as a surprise to both of them.\n\nThey had agreed that six was more than enough — Rhaenyra had dreamed about a daughter, and after Visenya was born, they decided not to have more children, using all the precautions instead. The boys were growing, and, no matter how sad it was to think about it at times, Rhaenyra was not getting any younger, every next labour just making it riskier for her and threatening to deprive Daemon of a daughter and their offspring of a mother.\n\nIt was a good decision, the one he fully supported. His daughter was always supposed to be in control of her destiny and body, and he would accept her every whim and decision. They had been long past caring what other people thought about their relationship, and the heinous word bastards had not been pronounced within the castle walls in a while, but Daemon loved Rhaenyra not just as a mother — it was but one of her shapes and forms, one of the incarnations, and he did not need more children from her to keep worshipping what they had built together.\n\nNature, however, had found a way — it seemed that they might have been done with having babies, but fates were not quite done with them. Despite their best efforts to take precautions, it happened — to this day, Daemon could not wrap his head around the fact he would have yet another child, and he struggled to comprehend how this could have happened.\n\nMaybe there were some miscalculations with the proportions of ingredients for her tea, maybe she had eaten or drunk something that made the effect of it void, or maybe it was just some kind of divine intervention — one way or another, she was with child again, and perhaps it did serve as proof that he had not lost all of his virility yet.\n\nThere was no denying that he was not the same man as he was when giving her those intimate lessons and instructions — but she was not entirely the same girl either, and they seemed to have found solutions and means to adjust, to learn new ways of being close with each other, even when the familiar methods of ardent exploration failed them.\n\nBut he was also not that old to be completely unable to tend to her needs — if someone pressed their ear to the door of his chamber past nightfall, they would still hear the song of desire and passion, and Daemon pitied the knights posted to guard the doors to their apartments.\n\nIf he had it his way, they would have to endure the noise for years to come.\n\n“And besides,” Rhaenyra continued, climbing into the bed to lie by his side, her hand on his chest, seeking to alleviate the pain, take it away, “I believe you have outdone yourself with this one, Father.”\n\n“What do you mean, my dear?” Daemon asked, his fingers travelling into her hair.\n\nAs a mother, she now often had to wear her hair in braids — Visenya, in particular, liked tugging on it, clinging to her mother’s silver locks. The girl’s grip was strong even despite her young age, and Daemon understood why Rhaenyra did not enjoy wearing her hair down when tending to the children.\n\nStill, he loved the ritual of undoing her braids when they were finally left alone after a long day — the cool river of silver always streamed through his fingers, and Daemon simply could not get enough of this secret, tender way of professing love, something only the two of them shared.\n\n“Well, I have reasons to believe there are two of them this time. Which immediately disproves your claim of being old and useless.”\n\nHe stared at her, trying to understand if she was jesting. Her tone was light, and she lay with her eyes closed, smiling peacefully — but the words she spoke were not something off-passing, something meaningless.\n\n“What?” He whispered in disbelief.\n\nThey were not supposed to have this child at all, and it was some kind of inexplicable miracle, but to have two children on accident, at the same time, when it had never happened to them before?\n\nRhaenyra opened her eyes and touched his cheek again.\n\n“I am saying that we are about to have two more children, so I need you to get back in shape as soon as possible so I do not have to care for them alone.”\n\n“How would you know that?” Daemon asked, still taken aback by her confession — or suspicion, he knew not how to treat it. “We have never had twins before, dear.”\n\nShe did sound pretty confident, and she was the mother, so perhaps he should just trust her — but to think that three moons ago, they did not even think about having children ever again and now, they were having not just a miracle child but two at once was dizzying.\n\n“That is precisely how I know,” she murmured. “It is different this time, and I just know it. By the way, the midwife is actually in agreement with me.”\n\n“You have spoken to a midwife already? Without letting me know?”\n\nThey had not announced it to anyone outside their family yet — and even in that, they were cautious, only confiding in older boys and not their younger children, who could accidentally share the news with someone else. Daemon was worried about Rhaenyra — each time they went through this was a gamble, and the merciless passage of time made the game way less fair. He hated the idea of sharing the news too early or accidentally giving their enemies an insight into her temporary, sweet weakness.\n\nAnd now, she was so calm talking about birthing not just one babe but two at the same time — Daemon’s head was spinning, for he could not even imagine how much harder this ought to be.\n\n“Yesterday in the morning. I have not had time to talk to you about it, and today has been hectic enough.”\n\nHe hummed. “You do realise that it is almost dangerous, especially at your age, love?”\n\nThat was a huge mistake — he understood it immediately, biting his tongue as her cheeks got flushed in an instant. What was supposed to sound as a sign of his profound worry for her came out almost insulting — and he was really sorry for it.\n\n“At which age, Father?” Rhaenyra asked, indignant. “Do elaborate.”\n\n“I did not mean it this way — ”\n\nShe did not like being doubted or told she could not do something. After all, this was what had made her the youngest dragon rider in their family’s history — her parents telling her she was not yet ready, that she had to wait for longer before taking to the skies. It did not take her long after that to go to Dragonpit, and order Syrax saddled, a pout on her small lips.\n\nIf told she could not succeed, Rhaenyra would persist until she did, and then look at everyone with pride and arrogance of an undeniable victor — this applied to so many things in their lives, and perhaps to motherhood as well.\n\nSo many people had doubted her capabilities to become a good mother — she was known for her capriciousness, for being spoilt, for her reckless and unladylike ways. There were plenty of those who whispered that her offspring could not grow into decent people, inheriting her difficult personality — but Rhaenyra just laughed at them all, raising their boys into Targaryen Princes who would, without a doubt, leave marks on this world.\n\nDaemon should have known better than to question her abilities to do anything — and he could barely fight the urge to smirk, watching her breasts rise and fall as she got angrier and angrier at him.\n\n“Are you laughing at me?!”\n\nHe could not fight it any longer and let out a snort, which quickly turned into heartfelt laughter. His daughter looked just like she did as a child — the weight of years had seemed to disappear, for the devious fire of determination in her eyes was deeply and endearingly familiar to Daemon, and so was the pout of her perfect lips.\n\nHe also had an undeniable, flawless excuse — he was unwell, after all, so how could she blame him or punish him for his little mischief? It was not like she could take offence with a father in need of her care.\n\nBut he sensed that she was about to explode, her moods even more mercurial due to the children growing in her womb, and sought to prevent it. Quickly, he turned his head to catch her lips in a kiss, hoping it would suffice for a peace offering and soothe her.\n\nRhaenyra tried to pull away, but he grabbed the back of her neck to keep her in place. She did sink her teeth into his lips in the act of defiance, but Daemon did not mind — the maesters had believed he needed leeches to let out blood, but he had a better idea about who could make him bleed.\n\n“Still strong enough to catch and hold you, my little girl,” he murmured against her neck when they parted.\n\n“And apparently healthy enough to be rude,” she snarled, looking every inch a spoilt child and not a mother of six.\n\nGods, he loved her so much. Daemon had had his accomplishments in this life — all the children he had, the wars fought and won in his name, the traitors punished for their treason against the realm and Rhaenyra — but perhaps his greatest achievement was preserving her inner fire, letting her still be his child and not just a lover, a Queen, a mother to his sons and daughter.\n\nThere had been frights and disappointments, and he had failed to shield her from absolutely everything — and yet he still built a secret kingdom for her, their personal little world where she could go back to the days of being carefree and without any restricting shackles of a title or motherhood, back to when she was just Rhaenyra, blissfully oblivious to a great many things.\n\n“I do feel better with you in my bed,” Daemon said with a proud smirk. “Your touch is healing already.”\n\nRhaenyra rolled her eyes, still annoyed with him, so he dragged his fingers up and down her arm, trying to calm her down.\n\n“Will you be able to prove your health and potency to me, then? Perhaps you do not require nursing, then, if you are feeling so well already.”\n\nShe did not probably mean it as a barb, merely keeping up with their titillating game of push-and-pull, but Daemon’s breath still hitched. He knew what she meant, what she wanted, what she was always brazen enough to demand, but all of a sudden, he was confronted by the fear that he might not be able to give it to her for much longer.\n\nWhat if this affliction of his heart, no matter how minuscule in Daemon’s eyes, had ramifications? It did not hurt as much anymore, the sensation of burn and tension in his chest dwindling, but surely, such incidents could not just pass without consequences.\n\nAgeing was one thing, but being deprived of his virility and skill completely would be a most unfortunate development, with a daughter as hungry and needy as Rhaenyra.\n\n“Maybe I am not that hale and strong anymore,” he grumbled reluctantly. “Maybe it will not even work properly at all after this.”\n\nRhaenyra frowned, realising she had stumbled upon insecurity — he could get past the humiliation of being treated like a dying man, past the ungainly manner he was acting in as the guards helped him into his room and bed, past the eyes of their sons filled with fear, but he was suddenly distressed by the prospect of losing part of himself that had defined him for so long.\n\nDaemon was a man of lust, and his daughter knew it better than anyone — to imagine their days of the wild, wicked pleasures were over or nearing their end was upsetting.\n\n“Gods fashioned men to have fingers as well, Father,” Rhaenyra whispered with a sly smile, taking his hand in hers.\n\n“What if I develop gout?”\n\nShe was not caught by surprise at all. “Then you will still have your tongue, will you not? In a very distant future, we might resort to this, but not for years to come.”\n\nHer reassurances were heartwarming, and yet Daemon could not quite lie to himself. He was now older than many men get to live — older than his father ever was, older than his uncle. Yes, quite a few lords and Kings had lived for longer, well into their seventies, even, but his life had been a storm for too long to hope for a peaceful passing in his bed at the age when he would not be able to tell his children apart.\n\nThese stupid heart palpations, this pressure and burn, were only the first signs of age catching up on him, teamed up with all the vices of his youth, all the indulgencies and stress from governing the Seven Kingdoms and raising his recalcitrant, capricious daughter.\n\nDaemon swallowed thickly, wanting to say something, but Rhaenyra spoke first:\n\n“You will have to get well and energised for my nameday’s feast, Father. I absolutely refuse to spend it sitting at the table without someone to take my hand for dancing.”\n\nHe loved how she sounded demanding, imperious — ordering him to get well, to recover as soon as possible, motherly notes in her voice. But at the same time, he could read her too well to mistake this attitude for false, baseless confidence — deep inside, she was still a girl, not so different from Aegon and their other boys, afraid that he would never bounce back, that she was losing him.\n\nRhaenyra needed to remain in control, needed to take all matters into her hands to stop thinking about the worst, to do everything in her power to prevent it from happening. She was worried, not allowing her anxiety to resurface in front of him or their children, but also not able to chase it away fully, always a daughter, always needing him like a guiding light, following him hungrily.\n\nShe was giving him an order to recover, to put this incident behind them — but she was also looking for ways to fuel her own hope, to ignore the dreary thoughts.\n\nHis daughter might have changed greatly in many aspects, becoming more temperate, more patient — but at the same time, she never stopped demanding things, never learned to accept that some things, her father might be powerless to grant her. In her opinion, she was the moon and the sun, and everything should bend to her will eventually.\n\nAnd Daemon was keen to do everything in his powers to let it remain so — with him still alive, she was his child first and foremost.\n\n“You have three sons that are old enough to take their mother’s hand and dance with her all night if this is what she desires.”\n\nHis daughter rolled her eyes, traces of worry gone, giving way to annoyance.\n\n“If they dance with me again, Father, we will have to forget about the prospect of them ever getting married.”\n\nIt was a recurrent topic of their conversations lately — how their three older boys seemed disinterested in anything that related to marriage. They all were old enough for betrothals, Aegon and Baelon even fit to marry already, having reached the age of maturity, but it did not change much — their sons did not fancy young ladies, did not rush to make their own matches.\n\nDaemon desired their happiness above political alliances — they had not spent all these years crushing rebels and silencing those who opposed Rhaenyra and her succession to sacrifice their children’s happiness for some crossing or piece of land or dilapidated castle.\n\nGiven the freedom to marry whomever they pleased, their sons seemed not to want to marry at all.\n\n“It is a great regret of mine and a great failure, I know,” Rhaenyra continued, and it was Daemon’s turn to roll his eyes and sigh, for he had heard it all before, “that I was not able to give them sisters to marry, girls of appropriate age we might have betrothed them to from the start.”\n\n“Rhaenyra — ”\n\n“I have always wished for daughters, and it would have solved so many issues we are now facing. Not to mention that I should have given you daughters, someone to be with when I am old and dry and ugly.”\n\nHe groaned in frustration. This was one of his daughter’s favourite tunes — having birthed six children, she still found ways to berate herself for not doing enough. There was this notion in her pretty, bright head that Daemon required more girls from her — someone to substitute her when she was no longer young, no longer fertile or healthy.\n\nNo matter how hard he tried, he could not explain to her that it was not ever the fact of having a daughter that led them where they were now — he loved Rhaenyra because of who she was, and yes, she would not be as dear to him without being of his seed and blood, but it did not mean he would desire any daughter of his.\n\nVisenya was just that — a daughter, a young child to care for, to love, to adore, but she did not make his heart beat the way Rhaenyra did, even at her age. Daemon had a special bond with his firstborn, from the moment she was placed in his arms, and there had been a string connecting them ever since. There was a sense of predisposition, of being fated, from the very first cry escaping Rhaenyra’s lungs.\n\nHis other children were loved by him, incredibly loved, but there was only one Rhaenyra, and she did not have to copy herself for him to enjoy later in life.\n\nEspecially because she seemed to forget, yet again, that he was ageing as well, and they deserved to go through all this together, not switching their attention to someone else.\n\nHe used to be vexed by her complaints on the matter, snapping and telling her that perhaps she would be the one switching to the son of theirs when Daemon was no longer enough for her. Rhaenyra would then scrunch her nose and reassure him that she could never lust for one of their boys this way — but still inevitably continue worrying that she had not given him more girls.\n\n“But I hope these two are girls,” she said, placing her hand on her belly. “Not that it will solve the problem of our boys remaining unwed, but it will at least — ”\n\n“They will marry in due time, Rhaenyra,” Daemon interrupted her, unable to bear her talking about birthing a substitution for herself and desperate to switch the topic back to their sons. “It is difficult for them, coming from the family they were born into.”\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. “What do you mean, Father?”\n\n“They want what we have, love,” he said with a warm smile, covering her hand with his. “They have grown up watching us, not some lords and ladies married for gain or pretty face. The only kind of love they know is ours, and, well, it is not exactly easy to find, is it?”\n\nDaemon was convinced it did not exist for anyone else — he and Rhaenyra were the only ones who could truly love, past the inhibitions, past the restriction of titles, names, and familial ties. Their love had endured a great many things, but it crushed through every obstacle, it drowned their enemies in blood, it changed the world.\n\nOther people could only dream of finding something similar — and one might search the lands, the seas and the skies and still fail, for love like that happened only once in the history of humankind, Daemon was certain.\n\nPerhaps dragons loved like that — but definitely not other mortals.\n\nRhaenyra clicked her tongue. “Well, if one wants to fall in love with a daughter, one has to make her first, and there have not been any advances in this regard.”\n\nHe laughed at her clever remark — even though he did not mean that their boys wanted to copy their relationship exactly, the wicked, sinful aspect of it included.\n\nBut he realised that he did not remember the time before her that well anymore — yes, he used to be married once, yes, he had bedded that woman enough for her to give him a child, but the moment Rhaenyra was born, even his marriage became of less significance than the girl who was the product of it.\n\nHe did have to make her first — but the act itself, the circumstances of it, had long been forgotten.\n\n“Are you so impatient to become a grandmother, darling?” He asked and put a small kiss on her cheek. “You are still having babies of your own. Do not rush it.”\n\nRhaenyra sighed and intertwined their fingers. “I am only worried that we have done something wrong with them, Father. I do not even know… That we have broken something in them.”\n\nHe knew she was not regretful — it was not in his girl’s nature to be remorseful or to look back on her decisions and wish she had done something differently. Neither he nor Rhaenyra regretted being together, giving these children lives, making them, raising them — but he could still understand the motherly fear that sometimes got the best of her.\n\nBeing born out of such a cursed, loathed union was not an easy fate. Their older children knew the truth, and it weighted on them — Aegon specifically was afflicted by this eroding, burdensome need to live up to the legacy and protect this family from all harm.\n\nIt was no wonder that Rhaenyra was questioning their choices yet again today — in the face of a challenge, their boys were brave, but perhaps too brave, too ready for the worst, some lighter, naive parts of them there no longer.\n\nCould they blame their sons for not wishing to open up to other people, to take wives who would become privy to the secrets of the family? Much of what was going on inside these walls, behind these doors, was no longer a mystery, no longer possible or necessary to conceal, but there were other deeds they had committed, other secrets they were hiding.\n\n“They are brilliant, my dear,” he whispered. “Too brilliant at times, I would say — but they will grow into it, they will learn how to enjoy being who they are instead of cursing their existence.”\n\nAfter all, that was what he and Rhaenyra had done as well. They had to take a thorny path to get where they were now, snug in bed together, parents to great children — it took growth, and it took mistakes.\n\nDaemon hoped his other children would be spared the same wickedness and pain that came with desire so strong — no matter how much he wished for their happiness, he knew that it was hardly for everyone to endure so much before being able to reach the heights of bliss. He and Rhaenyra had to fight for their right to love — he sincerely hoped their sons would not have to do the same.\n\nShe hummed instead of giving him a proper answer. The conversation gradually died down, and he realised Rhaenyra was drifting to sleep, snuggling close to him.\n\nIt was to be expected — the day had been difficult for everyone, much more for an expecting mother, and her body had run out of strength with all the decisions she had to make today, with all the words exchanged. Rhaenyra’s breathing became more and more even with each passing moment, and there was a tiny smile on her lips.\n\nDaemon would let her nap — she had always loved falling asleep close to him, ever since she was a newborn, effortlessly calming down when placed in his arms or lying on his chest. She had grown; he had become older and perhaps weaker, but some things did not really change.\n\nShe might be a day old — or in her thirties, but she would still be his child forever, knowing on the deep, primal level that her father’s embrace meant comfort and safety.\n\nHe did not wish to sleep himself — perhaps it would do him good to get some rest so it could help with the recovery, but he could not really close his eyes and drift away. His mind was awake, his thoughts racing, because now, in the silence filled only with the unison of their breathing, he could truly think.\n\nIt was not his heart that troubled him in earnest — if he had survived this sudden sharp pain, he was not in direct danger anymore, Daemon knew. His daughter’s gentle hands and carefully brewed potions would help him get better in no time, and he would rise from the bed, he would ride his dragon, he would fuck and train and rule again.\n\nWhat made him truly worried was that he had dropped his sword for the first time today — and people had seen it. There were his sons watching, knights of the Kingsguard, and other noblemen sparring early in the morning. They all turned to look at him, and they saw, for the first time, that the King was not an invincible mighty dragon anymore, that his hands could tremble, that Dark Sister could fall on the ground and wait to be picked up.\n\nThis meant dwindling fear — how could one truly be afraid of a man who was out of breath and had to be helped out of the training yard? How could one fear the swing of the sword, the sound of Valyrian steel, when they saw it fall gracelessly from the hand of a mortal and not a demigod?\n\nDaemon had been ruling through commanding authority and fear. His subjects and councilmen were afraid to disobey him, afraid to demur, to cross paths with him — but not for longer, he had to admit.\n\nThe hand that dropped the sword once could do it many more times — and who would be afraid of a feeble man who could no longer lift his blade to annihilate his daughter’s enemies?\n\nPerhaps it was time to step down — place the crown on Rhaenyra’s head himself, give Blackfyre to Aegon and Dark Sister to Baelon, instructing them to be their mother’s fiercest defenders. Daemon had done his time as the monarch, having polished the iron seat enough over the course of his rather long reign, but what if it was time for youth to take over?\n\nNot now, of course, not when Rhaenyra was pregnant again and had to get all the rest she could.
