        "text": "Rose Wolves by Natalie Warner\n\nReviewed by: Alice Mitchell, Youth Services Manager\n\nGenre: graphic novels, fantasy\n\nSuggested Age: 4th-7th grade\n\nWhat is the book about?\n\nOne day, a little girl picks an unusual flower from an unusual bush in the forest. Overnight, the flower blooms and turns into a magical creature: a rose wolf, missing a leg just like she is missing an arm. Together, the new friends must go on a journey to find where they belong. (From Amazon)\n\nMy Review:\n\nThe parallels between the little girl and the rose wolf make the story incredibly meaningful. They both begin their story a little growly and with missing limbs, and wind up finding where they belong together.\n\nThe entire concept of the rose wolf is wonderful, from the non-threatening design to the actual rose tail. I was sad to see the petals on the tail falling off and what that could possibly mean for the story, but it all worked out okay in the end.\n\nWhat fantastic illustrations! I’ve seen a bunch of wordless picture books, but this is the first wordless graphic novel that I’ve read. This story has a lot of depth and doesn’t need words to get its message across.\n\nFind it in the Youth Services Department or on the hoopla app!\n\nThe Bangalore Detectives Club\n\nBy: Harini Nagendra\n\nReviewed by: Melissa Friedlund, Adult Services Specialist\n\nGenre: Cozy Mystery/Historical Fiction\n\nSuggested Age: Teen/Adult\n\nWhat is the book about? Young wife, Kaveri, moved to Bangalore a few months ago to live with her new husband, Ramu, a doctor at the local hospital. As she has slowly been acclimating to the social setting in Bangalore, she has been attending more and more outings, including a party at the Century Club. It is here where a stunning murder occurs sending ripples of fear and anxiety through the community. Kaveri’s curiosity takes hold and she can’t seem to stop herself from investigating. Her new friendship with Deputy Inspector Ismail of the local police department only encourages her onward. People continue to be attacked while Kaveri is relentlessly hunting the killer. Can she stay safe while closing in on the violent offender? Or will she be the next victim?\n\nMy Review: I found this book to be an enjoyable cozy mystery. The main character, Kaveri, is charming and likable. She has some progressive ideas about how she wants to live her life that clash with the culture of 1920’s British India. However, her supportive husband begrudgingly allows her the freedom to indulge her curiosity and investigate the murder like it’s a new hobby. That may be a bit fanciful, but the story wouldn’t work if Kaveri were held to firm caste and gender rules. I listened to the audiobook on hoopla and thought the voice actor’s performance enhanced the experience with authentic pronunciation and accents.\n\nThree Words That Describe This Book: Whimsical, Enchanting, Endearing\n\nGive This a Try if You Like…The No.1 Ladies’ Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith, The Widows of Malabar Hill by Sujata Massey, and A Disappearance in Fiji by Nilima Rao\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nFind it at the library!\n\nFolktales for a Better World: Stories of Peace and Kindness by Elizabeth Laird, illustrated by Mehrdokht Amini\n\nReviewed By: Chelsea Bunton, library volunteer\n\nGenre: Folklore\n\nSuggested Age: Children (7-10)\n\nWhat is This Book About? Folktales for a Better World is a short anthology collection of myths and folklore from seven countries who have all experienced strife due to conflict. Most of these stories hale from the Middle East, but all stories are connected by a central theme of humanitarian kindness. Through these tales, the reader can witness how a deeply human thing it is to experience forgiveness, inner peace, and gratitude. Though the stories may be old, the thematic experience is timeless and personal to us all.\n\nMy Review: I always enjoy reading folklore from various origins. I very much enjoyed this particular set as they were stories I had never encountered before. It was very humbling to see stories like these that are rooted in such a very mortal desire for peace, yet they come from countries that we often generalize with dissension today. I think these stories are a testament to what could be in this world if we only look within for that brotherly nature we have lost to instinctually forgive and love our fellow man.\n\nThree Words that Describe this Book: Hopeful, charming, mythical\n\nGive This A Try if You Like…Myths or other folklore, The Librarian of Basra by Jeannette Winter, One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights)\n\nFind it at the library!\n\nWhen the Moon is Low by Nadia Hashimi\n\nReviewed by: Dawn Dickey\n\nGenre: Fiction\n\nSuggested Age: Adults, Teens\n\nWhat is the book about?: Fereiba, a teacher, and her engineer husband, Mahmoud, are middle class parents in Afghanistan, raising their family of two amidst a quickly changing and dangerous political scene. After Mahmoud is murdered, things change drastically and for the worse for Fereiba. She plans a daring escape with her three children, the youngest of whom would never meet his father.\n\nMy Review: Opening this book, I was instantly drawn into Fereiba’s story. The characters and their experiences are true to life and could have been drawn from the news. Their story is compelling, containing both joy and tragedy and dangers I could never have imagined. I marveled at their courage, cried at their misfortunes, and was thankful for the help they received during their dangerous adventures. The tale alternated voices between Fereiba and her son, Saleem. This dual perspective made the audio book especially enjoyable. I highly recommend this book, in text or audio format!\n\nThree Words That Describe This Book: Courageous, enlightening, hopeful\n\nGive This a Try if You Like… We Are Displaced: My Journey and Stories from Refugee Girls around the World by Malala Yousafzai or A Long Petal of the Sea by Isabel Allende or While the Earth Sleeps We Travel by Ahmed M.

A classroom of diverse children share bits of their family history and highlight ideals they value that make them American, each family working in their own way to make our country great. Some describe how their family fled hardships in their homelands, and others describe their lives in this country. Indigenous nations are also highlighted through the story of a Muscogee child. While each story describes challenges these families faced or continue to face, they each have a message of determination and hope that we can continue to improve our communities and country as a whole. For every group highlighted there is a note in the back about the impact these groups have had on our country, as well as factors effecting immigration and their lives once they arrived here.\n\nMy Review: I greatly enjoyed this story and learning more about the vast number of diverse experiences of people in this country. Presenting each story as it relates to an American ideal like determination and freedom of expression made them stories I could easily relate my own family to. The back matter taught me a great deal that I want to read more about, like how there were laws allowing Indian men but not Indian women from immigrating to the United States and how, despite immigration from other Asian countries being barred, exclusion laws didn’t apply to Filipinos because it was a U.S. territory. While not hiding the challenges and discrimination that people faced, this book still presents an optimistic outlook for the future.\n\nThree Words that Describe this Book: patriotic, hopeful, historical\n\nGive This A Try if You Like… Blue Sky White Stars by Sarvinder Naberhaus; The Undefeated by Kwame Alexander; America My Love, America My Heart by Daria Peoples-Riley; My Red, White, and Blue by Alana Tyson; I is for Immigrant by Selina Alko; A is for Asian-American by Virginia Loh-Hogan\n\nRating: 5/5\n\nFind it at the library!\n\nThe Duke and I by Julia Quinn\n\nReviewed by: Susie Rivera, Adult Services Specialist\n\nGenre: Fiction\n\nSuggested Age: Adults\n\nWhat is the book about? Julia Quinn’s first book in the Bridgerton series won’t disappoint as it follows the charming love story between Simon and Daphne. Simon, the Duke of Hastings has grown up estranged from his verbally and emotionally abusive father. He has no interest in marrying anyone until he meets beautiful and clever Daphne Bridgerton. The two strike a mutually beneficial deal–they will enter into a fake courtship that will keep the Duke safe from the rabid mothers of the town, and make Daphne appear highly desired. The fake relationship starts turning into a real one, and then more drama ensues!\n\nMy Review: I’m getting ready for FDL’s Bridgerton Tea program on June 26. I am a big fan of the Bridgerton show, but I haven’t read any of the books. Fans of the show will find that certain characters and subplots that are in the show are not in the book. But, the main story between Simon and Daphne is about exactly the same. So, if you are a fan of the Bridgerton show, check this out and you may delve deeper into Julia Quinn’s books. She has quite a few in the series now!\n\nThree Words That Describe This Book: Charming, Spicy, Enjoyable\n\nGive This a Try if You Like…books by Lisa Kleypas, Tessa Dare, or Jane Austen\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nFind it at the library!\n\nWhat You Are Looking for is in the Library by Michiko Aoyama\n\nReviewer: Deb Alig, Circulation Assistant\n\nGenre: Japanese fiction\n\nSuggested Age: Adult\n\nWhat is this book about? There are five chapters in this book, and each chapter is about a main character who desires change in his/her life. The characters vary in age and occupation. They all live in present time Hatori, a fictional ward in Tokyo. There is Tamoka, a 21-year-old girl who recently graduated from junior college and now works at a women’s clothing store, but who desires to do more with her life. Then there is Ryo, aged 35. He works in the accounts department of a furniture manufacturer, but he dreams of one day owning an antique shop. Natsumi, aged 40, works as an editor for a popular magazine but gets demoted when she returns from maternity leave. She does not regret having a baby, but she one day dreams of working in publishing again and creating books. There is also Hiroya, a 30-year-old man who still lives at home, reads manga, and does not have a job. He is very artistic and would like to be a designer. Mostly, he wants to feel accepted. Finally, there is Masao, a 65-year-old retiree who feels bored in his retirement. On his last day of work he asks himself, “What am I going to do now?”\n\nThe one thing all of these characters have in common, aside from wanting to make changes in their lives, is that they stumble upon the Hatori Community House library where they meet Mrs.Komachi, the enigmatic reference librarian who asks them all, “What are you looking for?” Based on their responses, Mrs. Komachi types up a list of book recommendations on her computer. Unique to each list is a book about some random topic that doesn’t seem to have anything to do with what the patrons are looking for in the library. Yet, these random books, I think, prove to be the most helpful to them. Mrs. Komachi also gives each character a sort of charm that she creates using a needle and a ball of wool, a free gift for visiting the library.\n\nMy Review: I really enjoyed reading this book about a community library and its patrons. The Hatori Community House library is a lot like ours. Its entryway is inviting, the shelves are packed with books, people who reside in the community can get a free card, and the staff, though small, is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic. I was especially touched when I read about Hiroya. He was the patron in the book who felt like he didn’t belong anywhere. But once he started visiting the library, he happily thought, “It’s okay. It’s okay for me to be in this place.” He finally felt accepted. That’s how I want all of our patrons to feel when they come through our doors—welcome, safe, and comfortable answering the question, “What are you looking for?”\n\nThree Words That Describe This Book: charming, inspirational, inclusive, magical, heart warming\n\nGive This a Try if You Like: Days at the Morisaki Bookshop by Satoshi Yagisawa, Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi, Everything in Its Place: A Story of Books and Belonging by Pauline David-Sax\n\nRating: 5/5\n\nFind it at the library!"
