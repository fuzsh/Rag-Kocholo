        "text": "Denver Center for the Performing Arts 2024-2025 Auditions\n\nDCPA has completed their season auditions and EPA’s in both New York City, New York and Denver, Colorado.\n\nShow specific auditions will take place throughout our season (locally and nationally) at which point individual breakdowns will be released for the roles we will be seeking.\n\nAt this point in time, we are not accepting video submissions to be considered for the season.\n\nDenver Center Theatre Company Productions & Character Descriptions\n\nHAMLET\n\nPlaywright: William Shakespeare\n\nDirector: Chris Coleman\n\nLORT B Contract\n\nThe Wolf Theatre\n\nFIRST REHEARSAL: August 9th, 2024\n\nFIRST PREVIEW: September 13th, 2024\n\nOPENING: September 20th, 2024\n\nCLOSING: October 6th, 2024\n\nArguably one of the greatest plays in the Western canon, Hamlet is a psychological revenge thriller, political epic, and family saga that’s both grand and deeply human. Packed with unforgettable characters and famous lines, Artistic Director Chris Coleman will helm the DCPA’s iconic season opener. When Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, returns home after his father’s death, he finds his mother remarried to his uncle and his father’s spine-chilling apparition roaming the palace grounds. Commanded by his father’s ghost to avenge his brutal murder, Hamlet’s burden to reclaim the reins of the kingdom becomes a perilous journey through the psyche. Bound by duty yet tormented by the gravity of his mission, every scheme and equivocation will test his resolve, disrupt his relationship with the fair Ophelia, and pose the tragic dilemma of whether “to be, or not to be.” Join us for one of Shakespeare’s best-known tragedies as you’ve never seen it before, executed with the fierce attention to detail that you’ve come to expect from the Denver Center Theatre Company.\n\nBARNARDO – (Any gender identity, any ethnicity, late 20’s / Early 30’s) Also plays Player (Lucianus), Captain, Follower, Attendant, Ambassador. Versatile actor with strong language skills. They play a variety of military and court officials, so will need to be able to tap into different status levels. Earthy.\n\nFRANCISCO – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 30’s) Also plays Reynaldo, Player, Sailor, Osric. Versatile actor with strong language and comedic skills. He plays a variety of military and court officials, so will need to be able to tap into different status levels.\n\nHORATIO – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 30’s) Horatio is a scholar and warrior. His core is sincere and loyal. He is the only person in this world that Hamlet actually trusts. Bright, heart-centered, loyal.\n\nMARCELLUS – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 30’s) Also plays Player and Fortinbras. Versatile actor with strong language skills. Marcellus is a close friend of Hamlet’s who serves in the nightly watch protecting Elsinore. Fortinbras is the ambitious military leader and heir to the throne of Norway, with an eye on recapturing Danish territory lost in an earlier war. Earthy and strong. Earthy, physically powerful.\n\nCLAUDIUS – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 50) The current King of Denmark, Claudius conspired to murder his brother (the former King Hamlet), to take the throne and marry his wife (Gertrude). He is a powerful presence, with plenty of charm, and a ruthless drive to hold onto power. He has an innate sense of strategy and calculation. Strategic, ruthless, ambitious.\n\nGERTRUDE – (She/Her, any ethnicity, 48) Hamlet’s mother and Queen of Denmark. When her husband, the former King Hamlet, died suddenly, she agreed to marry his brother, Claudius two months after her husband’s passing. Attractive, sensuous, compassionate; a strong presence, leads from her heart. Her loyalties are supremely challenged in the play. Sensual, compassionate, conflicted.\n\nPOLONIUS – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 50’s or early 60’s) Also plays First Gravedigger. Polonius is Chief Advisor to the King of Denmark. He is politically savvy and a bit of a spymaster with a focus on keeping challenges to the throne neutralized. He is also a talker: he has a lot to say to most everyone and can get so wrapped up in the nuances of his point, that it can be hard to keep him on track. Calculating, suspicious, garrulous.\n\nLAERTES – (He/Him, any ethnicity, late 30’s /Early 40’s) Laertes has much preferred his cosmopolitan life in Paris to home in Denmark but returns to celebrate the crowning of a new King. With his father serving as Chief Advisor to the throne, he is acutely aware of the requirements of court life, but also impatient with it. When his father is murdered by Hamlet, Laertes rallies a mob and storms the castle. In one version of the play, he could end up on the throne. Athletic, focused, savvy, driven.\n\nHAMLET – (He/Him, any ethnicity, late 20’s / Early 30’s) When Hamlet’s father, the former King of Denmark, suddenly dies – his uncle steps in to take both the throne (which should rightfully be Hamlet’s) and to marry Hamlet’s mother. He sinks into a deep, confused depression. When the ghost of his father visits him and reveals the truth of the situation, Hamlet vows to avenge his murder. But, actually stepping up and committing murder (of the current King, no less) proves far more daunting a task than he initially imagined. A nuanced thinker and dazzling strategist with a razor-sharp wit, Hamlet spends the play growing into the destiny that has called to him. Dynamic, quick thinker, wide emotional range, strong language and comedic skills.\n\nVOLTEMAND – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 40’s or 50’s) Also plays Attendant, Priest Soldier, Follower. Primary role is an Ambassador to Norway. Versatile actor with strong language skills. He plays a variety of military and court officials, so will need to be able to tap into different status levels.\n\nHAMLET’S GHOST – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 50’s) Also plays Cornelius, Player King, Attendant, Follower, Gravedigger 2. Versatile actor with strong language skills and a sense of theatricality. The Ghost of Hamlet’s father is an aggrieved spirit, with a deep sense of betrayal – who appears to motivate Hamlet to avenge his murder. The Player King is a first-rate classical actor from the city – with a wide emotional range. The Gravedigger is an earthy, slow-witted clown. He plays a variety of military and court officials, so will need to be able to tap into different status levels.\n\nROSENCRANTZ – (Any gender identity, any ethnicity, 30’s) Guildenstern has been friends with Hamlet since their youth. He comes from a family of high status in the kingdom, has a strong sense of his own self-worth and is knowledgeable about the politics of the court. Witty, intelligent, and willing to shift loyalties for the promise of future gain. Witty, bright, cool.\n\nGUILDENSTERN – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 30’s) Guildenstern has been friends with Hamlet since their youth. He comes from a family of high status in the kingdom, has a strong sense of his own self-worth and is knowledgeable about the politics of the court. Witty, intelligent, and willing to shift loyalties for the promise of future gain. Witty, bright, determined.\n\nOPHELIA – (She/Her, any ethnicity, late 20’s) The daughter of the King’s most powerful advisor, Ophelia has grown up in and around Denmark’s court. Prince Hamlet, heir to the throne, grew up with her, and as they’ve matured has shown significant romantic interest in her. So much so, that her father and brother worry about the risk to her honor. When Hamlet, in a burst of rage, kills her father, the thread of her psyche begins to unravel. Open, innocent, lovely, a bit of a poet.\n\nPLAYER QUEEN – (She/Her, any ethnicity, 40’s or 50’s) Also plays Courtier, Messenger, Attendant. Versatile actor with strong language skills and a sense of theatricality. The Player Queen is a principal player in one of the top acting troupes in Denmark. This actor plays several other roles of higher status, with a strong sense of the politics of the court.**This production will be understudied**\n\nI’M NOT YOUR PERFECT MEXICAN DAUGHTER\n\nPlaywright: Isaac Gómez\n\nDirector: Laura Alcalá Baker\n\nLORT C-2 Contract\n\nThe Kilstrom Theatre\n\nFIRST REHEARSAL: August 30th, 2024\n\nFIRST PREVIEW: September 27th, 2024\n\nOPENING: October 4th, 2024\n\nCLOSING: November 3rd, 2024\n\nThis vibrant and poignant adaptation of Erika L. Sánchez’s New York Times Bestseller follows Júlia, a Chicago high schooler who is definitely not your perfect Mexican daughter. That’s her older sister Olga’s role. But everything in Júlia’s life weighs heavier after Olga dies in a tragic accident, leaving Júlia to manage her family’s grief and unravel the secret truth — that her sister may not have been so perfect after all. As she struggles with the all-too-real challenges of coming of age in Chicago and the sense that she’s failing to live up to her family’s expectations, Júlia barely clings onto her dream of becoming a writer and is left questioning what she really knows about anything. I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter is a love story to young Chicanas who, in trying to find the truth about the people and the world around them, end up finding themselves.\n\nJÚLIA – (She/Her/Hers, Mexican American/Chicana, appears to believably be/play 15 to 18 years old) Thicc/Chubby/Fat/Plus Size. Morena or morena clara, just like her dad. Chewed up nails. Wants more than anything to be a famous writer. The odd daughter out. Not your perfect Mexican daughter.\n\nOLGA – (She/Her/Hers, Mexican American/Chicana, early 20’s) Permanently twenty-two, but never looked or acted like a normal twenty-two year old. Tall, thin, and very light skinned. Almost guera. All she ever did was go to work, sit at home with her parents, and take one class at the local community college. The perfect Mexican daughter. Except… maybe not. Oh. And she’s Júlia’s sister. And she’s dead. Also plays PATTY, ANGIE, JAZMYN, MERMAID OLGA. When Olga doubles as other characters, she’s less different people, and more like Olga-versions of them; she’s a lot like what Júlia sees (or wants to see) in the wake of Olga’s absence.\n\nAMÁ – (She/Her/Hers, Mexican, 40’s/50’s) Probably more attractive than most people half her age. Also known as Amparo Montenegro Reyes. Very light skinned, almost guera. Almost. Has had a tough life and gives tough love to show for it. She cleans the houses of rich white people in Chicago and been doing that for like thirty years. Júlia and Olga’s mother. Well. I guess just Julia’s now. Also plays MAMÁ JACINTA, DR. COOKE, HOMELESS WOMAN.\n\nAPÁ – (He/Him/His, Mexican. 40’s/50’s) Very handsome with a dark mustache that quivers when he tries to hold back emotions. Also known as Rafael Reyes. Definitely rounder. Moreno or darker. Very important. Has lived to see more than most and keeps to himself, so you’d never know it. Works for a candy factory and has been there since he immigrated to Chicago with Amá back in the 1990’s. A softy at heart. Also plays TÍO BIGOTES, TÍO CHUCHO, JOSE LUIS, JUANGA’S DAD.\n\nLORENA – (She/Her/Hers, Mexican American/Chicana, appears to believably be/play mid to late teens) The craziest bitch in the entire school. Some might call her a hoe, but she calls herself sexy as f*&$ and has no shame in her body. Morena or morena clara. Has been through most teens her age and so her tough ass puta persona is a manifestation of that. No one is more loyal than her. Chola energy 100%. Aspires to be a nurse and is Júlia’s bestest friend in the entire world. Also plays BELEN.\n\nJUANGA – (They/Them/Theirs or He/Him/His, Mexican American/Chicano/e, appears to believably be/play mid to late teens) Also plays ESTEBAN. The newest member of the Lorena/Júlia group. They see him and he sees them. His real name is Juan Garcia, but everyone calls him Juanga. Femme as fuck and couldn’t be more proud of it. Moreno/e or Moreno/e claro. He can be kind of a bitch, but really just wants to be seen and loved. Makes his own identity so others will like him.\n\nCONNER – (He/Him/His, White, appears to believably be/play mid to late teens) The dreamiest white boy in all of Evanston. Yes, that’s right. Evanston. The richest, whitest, most colonialist suburb of the Chicagoland area. It’s okay though cause he reads a lot so he kind of knows what’s up. Total book nerd, video game nerd, movie nerd — just a total nerd. No one could be more enamored by Júlia than Conner.\n\nINGMAN – (He/Him/His, White, 40’s/50’s) Júlia’s high school English teacher. More passionate about teaching than most. He is one of those teachers you can’t help but fall in love with while learning from them. But he’s not a creep, and never abuses his relationships with his students, no. He just simply has a way of making them feel like they’re actual humans with thoughts, desires, dreams, passions, fears, and so on.**This production will not be understudied**\n\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL\n\nPlaywright: Charles Dickens, Adapted by Richard Hellesen\n\nDirector: Anthony Powell\n\nLORT B Contract\n\nThe Wolf Theatre\n\nFIRST REHEARSAL: November 1st, 2024\n\nFIRST PREVIEW: November 22nd, 2024\n\nOPENING: November 29th, 2024\n\nCLOSING: December 29th, 2024\n\nEssential to the holiday season in Denver, A Christmas Carol is a joyous and opulent musical adaptation for the whole family that traces money-hoarding curmudgeon Ebenezer Scrooge’s triumphant overnight journey to redemption. Based on Charles Dickens’ classic novel, the DCPA Theatre Company’s production is “a splendidly festive tradition” (BroadwayWorld) that illuminates the meaning of the holiday season in a way that has resonated for generations.\n\nEBENEZER SCROOGE – (He/Him, any ethnicity, mid-50’s to 60’s) Driven by greed and resentment, Ebenezer Scrooge is a man who has locked himself away from the world. Past disappointments have hardened into icy intolerance for anyone or anything that threatens his personal status quo. Flinty, tight-fisted and “solitary as an oyster,” Scrooge fears change above all else – but when it finally comes, this misanthropic miser transforms overnight into the man he was born to be generous, affectionate, and alive with childlike wonder.\n\nBOB CRATCHIT – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 30’s to early 40’s) Scrooge’s underpaid and overworked clerk. Good-hearted, caring and kind, Bob Cratchit just can’t help but wear his heart on his sleeve. He’s reticent in public, boisterous at home, and always does his best to stay positive – even when sickness and financial instability threaten the well-being of his beloved family.\n\nFIRST SUBSCRIPTION GENTLEMAN / DICK WILKINS / THE UNDERTAKER’S MAN– (He/Him, any ethnicity, 20’s) The First Gentleman is an up-and-coming businessman collecting donations for the poor of London; he’s never encountered anyone like Scrooge before. Dick Wilkins is young Ebenezer’s best friend, outgoing and confident. The Undertaker’s Man is a weaselly punk who sells the belongings of dead people on the cheap.\n\nFEZZIWIG / SECOND SUBSCRIPTION GENTLEMAN / OLD JOE – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 40’s to early 50’s) Mr. Fezziwig is Scrooge’s first employer, a man who knows how to make money and spend it for the benefit of others. He’s sprightly, exuberant, and more than a little zany – a whirling dervish whose dearest wish is to make everyone around him happy. The Second Gentleman is another philanthropic businessman raising money for the underprivileged; he really doesn’t want to let Scrooge off the hook. Old Joe is a lowlife fence for stolen goods. He’s funny and fond of putting on airs – but still plenty dangerous.\n\nFRED / THE FIDDLER– (He/Him, any ethnicity, mid to late 20’s) Fred is Scrooge’s nephew, a young professional with the proverbial heart of gold. He’s optimistic, cheerful, and a bit mischievous. Despite everything, Fred has great compassion for his difficult Uncle, and that same sense of empathy extends outward into the world at large. The Fiddler is a jovial sort who keeps things hopping every year at the Fezziwigs’ annual Christmas party.\n\nGHOST OF JACOB MARLEY / FRED’S PARTY GUEST – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 40’s) Jacob Marley is Scrooge’s former business partner, seven years dead and hungry for redemption. He’s possessed by sadness, rage and deep regret for a life horribly misspent. He also happens to be scary as hell – and an ironist of the first rank. Fred’s Party Guest is a friend of Fred’s from work, amiable and down-to-earth.\n\nGHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT / SCHOOLMASTER– (He/Him, any ethnicity, 40’s) The Ghost of Christmas Present is a big, bountiful spirit – jolly and wise by turns, he’s the very embodiment of goodwill. Christmas Present is a commanding, larger-than-life figure, but love and sympathy for humankind suffuse his every word and gesture. The Schoolmaster appears in one of Scrooge’s bittersweet childhood memories, and Belle’s Husband is a thoughtful fellow who understands the true depths of Scrooge’s loneliness.\n\nEBENEZER AS A YOUNG MAN / GHOST OF CHRISTMAS YET TO COME – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 20’s) In most things, Young Ebenezer is the polar opposite of his older self: he’s passionate, romantic, and open to new experience. The world is an exciting place for him, and Ebenezer envisions a bright future ahead. He’s deeply in love with his fiancé, Belle, but the desperate importance Ebenezer attaches to worldly success eventually spells doom for their relationship. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is a dark and looming phantom capable of great eloquence – despite the stony silence it maintains.\n\nPETER CRATCHIT / SUITOR #1 – (He/Him, any ethnicity, late teens) – The Cratchits’ oldest son Peter is earnest and attentive. He can be playful, too, but tries hard to be the man of the house when Bob is away. Suitor #1 is the youngest (and most awkward) of three young gentlemen paying court to the Fezziwig daughters.\n\nTOPPER / SUITOR #2 – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 20’s to early 30’s) Topper is one of Fred’s good chums, a somewhat rowdy bachelor with an eye for the ladies. He’s high-spirited and fun to be around. Suitor #2 is another irrepressible admirer of the three Miss Fezziwigs.\n\nMALE DEBTOR / SUITOR #3 / BELLE’S HUSBAND – (He/Him, any ethnicity, 20’s to early 30’s) The Male Debtor is an impoverished young husband anguished at the thought of going to prison. He’s vulnerable and very nearly at the end of his rope. Suitor #3 is the final member of that romantic trio enthralled by the Fezziwig girls. As Belle’s Husband, he is a thoughtful fellow who understands the true depths of Scrooge’s loneliness.\n\nOLDER BELLE / STREET SINGER / FEZZIWIG DAUGHTER #1 / FRED’S PARTY GUEST– (She/Her, any ethnicity, 20’s to early 30’s) Just as sweet and full of grace as her younger self, Older Belle is now happily married, but saddened at the thought of Scrooge being so alone in the world. The Street Singer is a charismatic and lovely-voiced young woman who first ushers us into the world of A Christmas Carol. Fezziwig Daughter # 1 is a heartbreaker, beaming and flirtatious. Fred’s Party Guest is in attendance with her husband. She’s a genial person with a nicely tart sense of humor.\n\nMRS. CRATCHIT – (She/Her, any ethnicity, 30’s to early 40’s) Bob’s supportive wife and the loving mother to their children, Mrs. Cratchit is adored by her family. She’s generous and hopeful by nature, but also determined and realistic. In tough times, she’s the pillar of strength that keeps all of the Cratchits going. She can also read her husband Bob like a book.\n\nTHE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST/ FEMALE DEBTOR – (She/Her, any ethnicity, 20’s to early 30’s) A benevolent spirit who seems either very, very young or very, very old, The Ghost of Christmas Past is an ethereal being made almost entirely of light. She’s compassionate, humorous, and so outwardly gentle with Scrooge that one might not notice the fierce determination which underlies her every action. The Female Debtor has been so worn down by poverty and the threat of imprisonment that she becomes almost unglued at the mention of a possible reprieve.\n\nMARTHA CRATCHIT / MAID #1 / FEZZIWIG DAUGHTER #2 – (She/Her, any ethnicity, late teens to early 20’s) Martha Cratchit is the eldest Cratchit child, industrious, cheerful, and full of tenderness towards her family. Just like her mother, Martha is someone who can always be depended upon. Maid #1 is among the many Londoners who help narrate the story. She’s perhaps a little flip about Scrooge and his ugly old house. Fezziwig Daughter #2 is the youngest of the Fezziwig Girls, vivacious and fun-loving.\n\nBELLE / MAID #2 / THE WIFE’S SISTER – (She/Her, any ethnicity, 20’s) Belle is a smart, caring, charming young shopgirl – and the only love of Scrooge’s life. She’s also forthright and strong enough to walk away from her engagement to Scrooge once his passion for money becomes overpowering. Maid #2 is another Londoner who helps tell our story. She’s a bit unnerved by the thought of Scrooge and his gloomy suite of rooms. The Wife’s Sister is one of the guests at Fred’s holiday party. She’s got something going on with Topper, and it makes her deliriously happy.\n\nMRS. FEZZIWIG / CHARWOMAN – (She/Her, any ethnicity, late 30’s to 40’s) Mrs. Fezziwig is a warm-hearted human being constantly on the lookout for ways to make other people happy. Energetic and expansive, she’s a big personality who seeks to turn every day into an excuse for joyous play. Mrs. Fezziwig loves singing and dancing – she more than matches her husband in sheer effervescence. The Charwoman is another one of the looters selling stolen merchandise to Old Joe. She’s crafty and pseudo-philosophical about life’s ups and downs.\n\nFRED’S WIFE / FEZZIWIG DAUGHTER #3 / LAUNDRESS – (She/Her, any ethnicity, 20’s) Fred’s Wife is kind and welcoming (even to Scrooge!), and witty to boot.

The odd bunch must then band together in an elaborate ruse to throw the constable off their scent. His investigation, however, reveals much more than murder motives and rabble-rousing.

He has assembled a raucous team of sous chefs, comprised of his beau Dwayne and close friends Big Charles and Isom. The four-man team is cooking with plenty of spice and innuendo on prep night until a family emergency thrusts Dwayne’s troubled nephew into the mix. Tensions boil over into heated arguments — and one team member starts messing with Cordell’s secret sauce. With the crown, prize money, and their relationship on the line, Cordell and Dwayne are forced to reckon with what it means to be a Black man, a father figure, and part of a loving family. Winner of the 2021 Pulitzer Prize, The Hot Wing King by Katori Hall is a boisterous, in-your-face dramedy that is guaranteed to leave you salivating for a second helping.\n\nAll actors should have whip-smart, sass-influenced, and biting – well-intended- senses of humor. All characters are Black and male-presenting. CORDELL, ISOM, DWAYNE & BIG CHARLES all identify as Gay, while EVERETT & TJ identify as Straight.\n\nCORDELL – (Male identifying; Black; 40s) – The head chef and leader of the clique. He’s caring, animated, and strong, but occasionally needs to be lifted up when things get stressful. Recently out of the closet, and living with his partner, Dwayne. Recently divorced from his wife with whom he has two children.\n\nDWAYNE – (Male identifying; Black; 40s) — The head of the household. Provider of stability, reason, and care of Cordell (in particular), and ‘the clique’. He’s a highly functioning success in his hotel management job. He has been a constant presence and mentor to his nephew, EVERETT.\n\nISOM – (Male identifying; Black; 30s) — a new friend and recent addition to ‘the clique’. He is near-obsessed with his music playlists that includes ‘Gospel’ and ‘Trap’ – and that’s exactly how he talks. Met Cordell and Dwayne at church.\n\nBIG CHARLES – (Male identifying; Black; 40s) — An old friend. Met Cordell and Dwayne at the barber shop. Observant, wise, laid-back, and serves a ‘a rock’ to the group dynamic. Preferably a physically imposing actor but will fully consider all who are ‘right’ for the role.\n\nEVERETT “EJ” – (He/Him; Black; appears to believably be/play age 16) — Dwayne’s nephew. Wrestling with his emerging manhood and is in need of guidance and a new home. Though he presents as tougher than he is, he’s basically a ‘good’ kid. Innately ‘smart’, and we find him at the crossroads where his life choices for himself could go either way.\n\nTJ – (He/Him; Black; mid 30s) — Everett’s father. A long-time dealer who is ‘about that life’. Struggles with teaching his son how to be(come) a man, and unsure of Cordell and Dwayne’s influence as potentially ‘good’ father figures to his son.\n\n**This production will be understudied**"
