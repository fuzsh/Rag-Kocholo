        "text": "Starting a review of Babylon is like figuring out how to angle your mouth when biting into a sandwich bigger than anything your jaw can accommodate. It only came out six months ago and yet its reputation has already gone through a myriad of Sonic the Hedgehog style loop-de-loops. Critics initially reviled Babylon as an excessive, 1920s-themed Heaven’s Gate, while audiences turned up their noses before flocking to Avatar 2: Blue Smurfcat Boogaloo instead. The consensus was clear: Babylon was a cringey mess, little more than an act of hubris on the part of its director.\n\nThen came the early months of 2023 and behold—the counter-backlash! Babylon was not a steaming pile of anachronistic elephant dung! It was both a bold love letter to The Movies and a hate screed to Hollywood! The haters are merely unable to appreciate the film’s ambition, which will one day be vindicated not unlike what happened with once-dismissed classics such as Blade Runner.\n\nIn the classic film sphere, the film was especially divisive, mostly leaning towards the hater side of the spectrum. Initial trailers made it clear that Chazelle played fast and loose with the look of the 1920s. And then there were all those reviews describing the amount of cussing, screwing, and pooping filling Babylon’s three-hour runtime. To top it off, the very title of the film is a reference to Kenneth Anger’s infamous tabloid tome Hollywood Babylon. What could we possibly expect save headaches?\n\nWell, my curiosity got the better of me. I have an irrepressible attraction to so-called epic failures. Or should I say misunderstood classic? Whatever one thinks, Chazelle took risks. As it is always with risk-taking, sometimes it pays off, sometimes it doesn’t, but the results are invariably interesting, no matter the outcome.\n\nOf course, calling Babylon merely interesting is like saying Antarctica is a bit chilly. The film is so aggressively weird that it’s not in danger of losing your attention, though certain scenes might make you lose your lunch. However, I wanted to watch Babylon on its own terms. Is it actually trying to give us a history lesson about the silent era? Is it meant as a fable about the eternal scumbag nature of Hollywood and the immaculate magic of cinema? Is it meant to make me vomit? The result of my pondering all of this is a review pretty epic in scope itself. For all its insanity, Babylon got me thinking about the purpose of period films and how the times they depict relate to the present.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\nA note on spoilers and screenshots: This review is rather loose with spoilers. The audience in my head while I was writing this thing wasn’t so much people who knew they wanted to see Babylon, but fellow classic film fans who are extremely reluctant to watch it and perhaps unlikely to watch it, so maybe this write-up will be the next best thing. So, if you want to watch this film, then maybe wait until you’ve done that before reading this post. Also, my screen caps are pretty bad. I took them from a standard DVD and I tried to make them look decent, but they blur a lot and my computer is ancient, so… sorry!\n\nThe lion’s share of the runtime covers the transition from silent films to “talkies,” intertwining the paths of five characters during this rocky period.\n\nThe most immediate is Manuel “Manny” Torres (Diego Calva), an idealistic immigrant with dreams of entering the movie industry. He’s the audience surrogate, not unlike Nick Carraway in The Great Gatsby. He goes from being menial help to an Eddie Mannix style studio executive, oscillating between producing movies and managing movie star misbehavior.\n\nNellie LaRoy (Margot Robie) is a party girl, cokehead, and wannabe starlet seeking to escape her abusive childhood through fame. Silent film fans will recognize her as a composite of “It Girl” Clara Bow and the lesser known Alma Reubens, a talented actress undone by drug addictions.\n\nJack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is an aging matinee idol emotionally invested in the possibilities of cinema as an art form and thus frustrated with having to make Hollywood schlock. Reviewers have been comparing him to Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and sometimes even Errol Flynn, but silent film fans will recognize him as an obvious parallel to John Gilbert.\n\nSidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo) is an ambitious and obsessive jazz trumpeter whose African-American identity serves as a roadblock in the white-dominated entertainment industry. He’s loosely based on jazz legend Duke Ellington, who made musical short films like Black and Tan in the late 1920s.\n\nLady Fay Zhu (Li Jun Li) is a lesbian cabaret singer and intertitle writer, as well as Jack’s occasional confidante. A blend of Anna May Wong and Marlene Dietrich, she’s the most alluring and enigmatic figure in the film (and alas, the most underused, but that’s a complaint for later).\n\nThe movie doesn’t have a “plot,” per se. If you wanted to break it down, the film is made up of two parts, followed by an epilogue set in 1952. The first part takes place during the final glory days of silent Hollywood. Scenes focus mostly on veteran star Jack and newly minted star Nellie making movies and basking in the limelight, while Manny slowly climbs his way up the corporate ladder, compromising his morality all the way.\n\nThe second part details the rise of the talkies and the tumultuous effect this has on the careers of the main characters. Ever adaptable to the needs of the moment, Manny continues to gain power, carefully eroding any “foreignness” about himself, while helping propel Sidney to stardom in a series of sound shorts and features highlighting black culture and music.\n\nHowever, everyone else isn’t so lucky. Fay is effectively banished from the industry when the tabloids start hinting at a love affair with Nellie, Jack’s public loses interest in him, and Nellie’s hypersexual screen persona starts falling out of favor with moral watchdogs. Even Sidney grows disillusioned with his success, particularly when Manny insists he wear blackface on camera lest southern white audiences think his lighter skin tone means the band is racially integrated.\n\nThroughout both halves, we get lots of partying in various venues, from late night orgies that suggest what Eyes Wide Shut might have been like had Baz Luhrmann directed it to an underground S&M dungeon owned by yellow-toothed gangster gremlin Tobey Maguire. These scenes have it all. Men snorting coke off women’s breasts. Pachyderms pooping on hapless handlers. Group sex. Drinking. Screaming. Flailing. Golden showers. Ass pinching. Musical numbers about female genitalia. Phallic symbols far and wide. A muscular dude eating live rats.\n\nAs you can probably tell from the synopsis, Babylon is not much of a focused character piece as a sprawling look at studio politics and amoral decadence, though that’s not to say the characters aren’t interesting in and of themselves. Considering how the negative reviews claimed they were all boring, I was stunned to find that wasn’t so. Unfortunately, the film’s focus on each character is not distributed evenly, leaving two in particular less developed than I would have liked: Fay and Sidney. Fay is multi-talented, a singer and writer whose cool head in a crisis makes her admirable among all the flailing and screaming, both at the coke-heavy gatherings and in the larger world of Hollywood machinations. Sidney is madly in love with his music (in one scene, he admiringly mentions a Russian pianist who broke his own fingers to make them longer and therefore more optimal for playing) but unwilling to compromise himself for a place on the dubious Hollywood pedestal.\n\nWhat’s especially interesting about Sidney and Fay is how they symbolize the way great talents like Anna May Wong, Paul Robeson, or Nina Mae McKinney were tragically underutilized by Old Hollywood due to racism and xenophobia. Alas, Babylon underutilizes Fay and Sidney as well because why waste time on interesting characters who act like adults when we can just cut to Nellie humping a phallic ice statue? Or hey, let’s waste time demonizing poor Roscoe Arbuckle in a scene where a corpulent actor giggles as a starlet pees on his face and calls him “piggy”?\n\nThis is something that frustrates me about Babylon: it’s too busy trying to shock us like a preteen who’s just learned some new four-letter words. It’s not because I’m a prude– for God’s sake, I’ve sat through movies like In the Realm of the Senses, a Japanese period drama with unsimulated sex scenes and a gory ending– but Babylon‘s excesses often feel juvenile. Three hours of that and I’m just tired at the end, like a babysitter ready to go home after an evening with brats high on pixie sticks. Depending on your taste, these scenes are either going to make you go “WTF LOL” or you might, uh…\n\nAnd yes, I GET IT, the party scenes do have a point. They’re meant as the seedy, Inferno-esque underbelly to the sophisticated and romantic image Hollywood presents to the outside world. Behind the glamor is only a fetid pit of incontinent elephants, little people on penis pogo sticks, and an overalls-clad Margot Robie wrestling a snake. I get it, yes. Do I get a cookie for every time Chazelle makes that point over and over again?\n\nAnyway, let’s get to the film’s recreation of the 1920s. Or rather, “recreation.”\n\nA lot of Babylon is anachronistic, despite Chazelle’s claims of heavy research. The dancing, music, and clothes are mostly all wrong, though I’ve come around on Nellie’s hair. Not because anyone necessarily wore their hair like that (even women who bucked the bobbed hair trend had their locks kept far less askew than Nellie’s), but because Nellie’s hair is meant to evoke the biblical Samson or a forest-dweller rather than Mary Pickford. This is emphasized later in the film, when the studio tries to reinvent Nellie as a sophisticate. Part of the makeover involves her distinctive locks being tamed and then frozen in short finger waves, representing a loss of the individuality that once made her unique.\n\nStill, Nellie’s “out of time” appearance would probably be a lot more revolutionary if the rest of the cast looked like they were actually inhabiting the Roaring Twenties. They do not. Ninety percent of the time (and even that is a modest figure), they dance, speak, and act like people from the 2020s attending a ’20s themed New Years party.\n\nAnother element lacking authenticity are the silent films themselves. Okay, there are a few details I liked, so let me share those first. I like that Babylon shows that female directors were indeed a thing in the silent era. I like the depiction of the use of “mood music” and the looser atmosphere on the sets. I liked the little nods to filmmakers like Dorothy Arzner and Erich von Stroheim. I like that they even show how dangerous it was for stuntmen in those days, with one of them ending up dead.\n\nBut as for the actual films being shot… well, yeah no. I do not like.\n\nDespite allegedly being about the magic of the late silent era, the silent films of Jack Conrad and Nellie LaRoy lack the stylistic sophistication that made the mid-to-late 1920s such a rich period in filmmaking. At the risk of being super nitpicky and annoying, I’m going to take a closer look at the big romantic scene in Jack’s medieval epic to belabor my point.\n\nDressed as a knight and illuminated by a glorious sunset, Jack kneels before a lovely woman in white before rising to embrace her. Then, as William Holden’s screenwriter character in Paris When It Sizzles would put it, “Two enormous, highly paid heads come together for that ultimately inevitable moment, the final, earth-moving, studio rent-paying, theater-filling, popcorn-selling kiss.”\n\nThis moment is meant to be an awe-inspiring encapsulation of the ethereal beauty of silent cinema. Think of the lush romanticism of Eleanor Boardman and John Gilbert’s boat ride through the willows in Bardelys the Magnificent, or the hot and heavy clinch between Greta Garbo and Gilbert in a moonlit garden in Flesh and the Devil.\n\nNeither is any all-time great, groundbreaking classic, but both are good showcases for how beautifully staged and photographed even your typical silent studio drama could be.\n\nIn comparison, Chazelle’s “popcorn-selling kiss” is damn underwhelming. The composition is pedestrian, the staging wants for imagination, and the image lacks the characteristic nitrate glow of early film (surely, they could have faked that with all the digital tools we have now?). You might roll your eyes at my protesting, but considering this shot is reused later in a montage meant to sell “the magic of the movies,” I think my criticism is fair. Jacobin critic Eileen Jones concurs in her acidic review:\n\n“Certainly Chazelle has no gift whatsoever for capturing the magic of the best of silent film imagery. Unlike the loveliest ’20s cinema, Chazelle’s compositions suck, and his lighting is muddy. The passionate embrace between a Jack Conrad character and his romantic ideal, which is apparently supposed to represent the height of the silent film effect of showing us gods and goddesses in the throes of romance, is shot so incompetently I was once again lost in confusion. Is Chazelle trying to make it look mediocre, so that the characters expressing an almost religious fervor about film just seem stupid?”\n\nNow unlike Jones, I do think Chazelle was trying to show how magical the late silent era was. He just didn’t do a good job.\n\nChazelle is much more adept at showing the frustrations of early sound filmmaking. The shooting of Nellie’s entrance in her talkie debut The Dean and the Dame is my favorite scene because it shows everything that rankled actors and crew about these new technologies. Because of the fixed position of the microphone, Nellie can no longer improvise her way through a scene. Her director can no longer give her directions while the cameras are rolling. The sound technicians usurp the director’s control of the set. Due to the concerns about excessive noise, the set isn’t even air-conditioned, causing Nellie to be coated in sweat both from heat and anxiety as she flubs take after take. The camera itself is encased in a sealed booth to shut out its noise, which results in the cameraman suffocating.\n\nJack’s career decline is also handled superbly. There’s this idea that silent film actors who could not transition to talkie stardom simply had ill-fitting voices or they were just bad actors who could not deliver dialogue– Lina Lamont Syndrome, if you will– but the truth was far more complex. Jack’s decline cannot be blamed on his voice not matching his image or an inability to deliver dialogue. Jack is not a bad actor. He embraces sound. And yet, Jack’s career fails. Like the biblical Job, he can only wonder what he’s done for this to be the case.\n\nLike Job, he does get an answer, though not from God. One wonderful character I’ve neglected to mention is Elinor St. John (Jean Smart), an erudite gossip columnist modeled on Adela St. Rogers and Hedda Hopper. In a tense moment with Jack, where he wonders why his career is eroding before his eyes, Elinor says frankly that there is no reason why other than his time has passed. There is nothing he could have done differently to continue his career as it was. This reminds me of the fate of silent movie greats like Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, and Richard Barthelmess. Their voices were fine. They were no less talented in 1930 than they were in 1920, but as far as the audience was concerned, they were relics. Good on Chazelle for not resorting to the “lol sexy silent movie man sounds like Mickey Mouse!!1!” trope.\n\nOf course, I have to puncture my praise with the admission that this speech is historically bullshit because the idea of film as a form of secular immortality was not a thing in 1932. Talkie-intoxicated studios allowed their silent films to rot when they weren’t deliberately destroying them, hence why something between 75 and 90% of silent films are lost forever. Jack would have believed he was going to be forgotten as audiences moved on to younger stars.\n\nAnd that brings me back to the film’s loose grasp of historical accuracy, and the question I see posed by so many fans of the film, “Does it really matter?” How many reviews have I encountered where people bemoan how silly complaints about historical accuracy are because clearly the film is not interested in that. Its concerns are grander, we tell you!\n\nWell, I’d probably complain less if Chazelle wasn’t bragging about his research, but let’s consider that rebuttal. Considering that I personally love plenty of historical movies that take liberties with what really happened or how past societies operated to varying degrees, I don’t want to be a hypocrite by dismissing Chazelle’s strategies out of hand. If Babylon is not trying to be super accurate, then what is its ultimate purpose in having a period setting at all?\n\nI am so conflicted over the answer. You see dear reader, I loathe the current trend in historical dramas where the creators excuse their anachronisms with the idea that modern people can’t connect to historical people if they actually act or dress like historical people. Hence the presence of contemporary rap and form-fitting dresses in Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby or 2010s prom dresses on 16th-century monarchy in Reign.\n\nHowever, I am not ignorant of the fact that historical fiction says more about the time in which it’s written than the time in which it’s set. I’m also not ignorant of how Old Hollywood and other world film industries also slapped contemporary fashions and thinking on their historical movies (ex. Lorretta Young’s plea for religious tolerance in Cecil DeMille’s 1935 medieval epic The Crusades is just as anachronistic as Orlando Bloom doing the same in Ridley Scott’s Kingdom of Heaven). Not everyone is going to be Stanley Kubrick about this.\n\nCreators often tend to be upfront with their lack of interest in documentary realism by introducing elements of travesty into their period films. What is travesty? Writing about Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette (a biopic which blends 1980s rock and anachronistic color schemes into 18th-century Versailles), Sight and Sound contributor Pam Cook defined it as “a common device in theatre and literature [which] irreverently wrests its source material from its historical context producing blatantly fake fabrications that challenge accepted notions of authenticity and value. It brazenly mixes high and low culture, and does not disguise its impulse to sweep away tradition.”\n\nThat is what Chazelle is doing: creating a funhouse setting which blends the 1920s and 2020s into an irreverent mashup. He’s not painstakingly reviving the past– he’s just combining weird anecdotes he encountered (ex. Nellie ices her breasts to keep them perky as Jean Harlowe did in the early 1930s) in a mythical version of Old Hollywood. And I do emphasize myth, because the way this film blends past and present goes beyond just the aesthetics and style. During the shooting of his medieval epic, Jack Conrad throws out ideas for movies in his tent between takes, referencing Gone with the Wind and The Terminator, both movies made years later. Like Nellie, Jack is someone with a foot in the future.\n\nBut what is the point of this, beyond Chazelle flashing his film buff card through zany, meta flourishes? I’d say it’s an attempt to comment on 2022 Hollywood by explicitly creating parallels to Hollywood’s collective past.\n\nIf you’ve been paying attention, Hollywood is experiencing yet another existential crisis: movie theater attendance has been on the decline for years and the COVID-19 pandemic only accelerated the trend. While some films have raked in the big, big money since the theaters re-opened, theater-going has not resumed its pre-pandemic numbers. Several films this year have emphasized the “magic of cinema” and specifically the theater-going experience: The Fabelmans and Empire of Light come to mind. Babylon is simply continuing the trend in its own way, though it also uses past Hollywood to craft a myth about the dual nature of Hollywood as both Dream Factory and Hell on Earth.\n\nWhat do I mean by myth? I don’t mean myth in the pejorative sense, like when we accuse something of being a lie. Myth, even when loosely based on historical figures, is not literally true so much as psychologically true. Take every historian’s favorite punching bag Braveheart: viewed as a historical recreation of the life and times of William Wallace, Braveheart is laughable, yet as a heroic myth about courage and fighting tyranny, it has great emotional resonance for many people. When I view Babylon as a myth about the inevitability of fighting against time, and the tension between the scumbag city Hollywood is and the beautiful dreams it inspires in artists and the audience, I can overlook most of the inaccurate clothes and historical liberties.\n\nWhile pondering that second theme, I was reminded of a far different period film that came out a few years ago: Hayao Miyazaki’s The Wind Rises. (No, I am not kidding!!)\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with it, The Wind Rises is a fictionalized biopic about Jiro Horikoshi, the airplane engineer who designed the Mitsubishi Zero that would decimate Pearl Harbor during World War II. Tonally, The Wind Rises and Babylon couldn’t be more different, but they both take liberties with history to emphasize the same thematic concern about the relationship between morality and art.\n\nMiyazaki presents Horikoshi as an idealist in love with his work. However, the wartime milieu in which he finds himself means that his creations will be used to kill. In a Fellini-esque dream sequence, Horikoshi speaks with his idol, the Italian engineer Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi laments, “Airplanes are cursed dreams,” and asks Horikoshi if he wants to “live in a world with pyramids.” That is, is he willing to create beautiful and awe-inspiring things in spite of the human cost?\n\nLike Marconi’s airplanes, perhaps the movies too are cursed dreams, flowers growing from a compost pile of human misery. The film’s final scene has a middle-aged Manny watching Singin’ in the Rain during its first-run, tears filling his eyes as the comedic fumbling of Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen amuses the audience but reminds him all too keenly of the human wreckage the talkie revolution left behind. For Manny, it must be like seeing your worst memories used as fodder for a musical comedy. (I have to admit, it’s a subversive way to frame one of Hollywood’s most beloved classics. Chazelle is openly inviting both admiration for his chutzpah and unbridled cinephilic indignation.)\n\nThen we get a film history’s greatest hits montage set to the film’s pulsing soundtrack. I suppose it’s to lend the finale an epic sweep, showing how Manny and his ilk were indeed a part of something greater: the whole of film history itself. Even if individuals are as ephemeral as a cresting wave, all belong to an even greater ocean. It’s a sentiment that goes beyond just film history, and it gives this scatalogical opus some ontological heft.\n\nOr as Tim Brayton puts it:\n\n“[Babylon] kind of hates itself, and it hates Los Angeles, where this was all shot, and it hates the way that movies are backbreaking work that exploits human beings with almost indescribable contempt for their humanity. And yet: Singin’ in the Rain exists, and it would be worse to be alive if it didn’t. Babylon isn’t trying to resolve that tension, so much as standing back in awe at that contrast.”\n\nI have to respect that lack of resolution. So many movies are terrified of leaving the audience without a lecture on “what it all means.” Babylon invites the viewer to contemplate the themes it brings up and knows not everyone is going to leave the theater with the same answer.\n\nUnfortunately, I think Babylon undermines itself a bit by keeping its head in the toilet, as Imogen Smith put it in her review. Going back to Miyazaki’s movie, The Wind Rises balances its depiction of xenophobia and wartime horrors with moments of quiet tenderness and beauty, which makes the film more emotionally potent. Babylon has a few tender moments, but they are rare across its three hours. It’s relentlessly ugly and cynical, undermining subplots which should be more cathartic, like the doomed romance between Manny and Nellie. Fans of Babylon call it “a love letter to cinema and a hate letter to Hollywood,” but it is far more preoccupied with the latter than the former. Not that I wanted the movie to pull its punches regarding the exploitation and ruthless backstabbing that goes on in Hollywood, but the whole movie is so entrenched in the muck that I don’t feel as much awe at the contrast as Brayton does.\n\nSo after all of that, did I actually think Babylon was any good? Overall, I would say it’s a daring work that probably tries to do a bit too much. The performances are wonderful and there’s energy to spare in the film’s best sequences. Even if I find the racier content grating, I will admit some of it made me laugh out loud (one scene in a public bathroom features a character asking if sound will really add anything to movies and this inquiry is punctuated by a loud shart).\n\nNow, whether or not any of this is enjoyable or worthwhile is up to you. You might find this irreverent and exhilarating, especially in the context of our superhero-saturated era. You might see this as overwhelmingly smug and relentlessly hideous. I do not blame people for having this reaction to Babylon. It will likely never be a favorite of mine and to say I relished the entire thing would be a lie. And by God, I hope no one leaves this movie thinking its presentation of history is a damn documentary. But I have not stopped thinking about Babylon since I saw it last weekend, and not all the impressions that run through my head are negative. I have to give it that much.\n\nSources:\n\n“Babylon (2022) – Movie Review” by Tim Brayton, https://www.alternateending.com/2023/01/babylon-2022.html\n\n“Babylon and the case of the missing bob haircut” by Esther Zuckerman, https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/movies/babylon-margot-robbie.html?searchResultPosition=6\n\n“Babylon: Damien Chazelle reaches for the stars, but his head is stuck in the toilet” by Imogen Smith, https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/reviews/babylon-damien-chazelle-reaches-stars-his-head-stuck-toilet\n\n“Babylon is so bad it will hurt your brain” by Eileen Jones, https://jacobin.com/2023/01/babylon-review-damien-chazelle-silent-era-movies-hollywood-film-industry?mibextid=Zxz2cZ\n\n“Babylon: The myths and true stories that inspired the classic Hollywood epic” by Farran Nehme, https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/12/the-myths-and-true-stories-that-inspired-babylon\n\n“Beginning of the end for John Gilbert” by Greenbriar Picture Shows, https://greenbriarpictureshows.blogspot.com/2006/07/beginning-of-end-for-john-gilbert-i.html\n\n“Portrait of a Lady: Sofia Coppola and Marie Antoinette” by Pam Cook, https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/features/portrait-of-a-lady-sofia-coppola-marie-antoinette\n\nA year has passed since my last breakdown of the top-grossers of 1921.

Like last year, I based my list off the one on Wikipedia—however, something weird happened this time. When Knighthood Was in Flower disappeared from the list in the middle of my writing process. I could not find a reason why this was so beyond someone questioning whatever source was previously used to justify its placement there. I tried to find more precise numbers for its box office in other sources, but I came across little more than claims that the film was a big hit.\n\nThis left me with a bit of a conundrum. I try to be as historically accurate as I can with this stuff, even if this still involves a lot of conjecture. I had already done research on other aspects of the film’s production. I’ve decided to post that review separately in the future, as a kind of bonus.\n\n—\n\n#5 – SMILIN’ THROUGH\n\nRelease date: February 13, 1922\n\nBox office (est.): 1 million\n\nSummary: Years ago, John (Wyndham Standing) lost his beloved fiancee Moonyeen (Norma Talmadge) when she defended him from the fatal attack of a rival for her hand, Jeremiah (Harrison Ford– no, not the one you’re thinking of). Years later, John is a bitter old man, only comforted by the love of Moonyeen’s orphaned niece Kathleen (also Talmadge), who he has raised as his own. When she falls in love with Jeremiah’s son Ken (also Ford), John tries to break up the lovers, but Moonyeen’s spirit seeks to soften John’s heart from beyond the grave.\n\nHas any major star ever well and truly dropped off the face of pop culture as sharply as Norma Talmadge? In the 1920s, she was arguably the most respected dramatic actress working in Hollywood, as well as a top fashion icon imitated by thousands of women across the country. Celebrated for her dark, expressive eyes and versatility, it’s astonishing how swiftly she fell from stardom into obscurity. When remembered at all, it tends to be through silly myths about the transition to sound (namely, the idea that a Brooklyn accent sank her career overnight) or in relation to her one-time brother-in-law Buster Keaton (and in that case, usually not in the most flattering light).\n\nTalmadge’s films have had only a scant presence on home media, making her difficult to re-evaluate. Not everyone is impressed by what they see, especially considering how Talmadge’s films are often described as prototypes for the “women’s film” genre that became popular in the 1930s. Compared to “women’s film” actresses like Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, Talmadge seems far more subdued, with a lot less fire.\n\nIn her book Silent Stars, Jeanine Basinger puts this sentiment across best:\n\n“Norma Talmadge’s bad reviews were usually for her material, not for her. She was too professional simply to walk through even her worst roles, yet despite all the different eras and settings in her movies, it becomes apparent that her work is about genre. She has beauty and skill, but she is basically serving the plots of her films, dressing them up with her presence. Her movies are star vehicles, but their significance today lies outside her. She was the genre she inhabited– the woman’s picture. This is not in and of itself a bad thing, but it denies her the significant place in film history that her popularity would ordinarily have earned her. She cannot stand the test of time.”\n\nI don’t know how much I agree with this sentiment. Talmadge’s screen persona is certainly less colorful than the likes of Crawford and Davis. However, I find myself fascinated by it. Talmadge’s characters exist at a crossroads between the Edwardian era and the Jazz Age. She isn’t a vamp or a flapper, and there’s a bit too much solemnity and world weariness in her to qualify as an ingenue. Her appeal seemed to lie in her ability to make the audience admire her characters, specifically their courage in the face of suffering, be it from an unjust prison sentence in Within the Law or from being forced to spend the night with a spurned former beau to save lives in The Woman Disputed. Journalist Adela Rogers St. John once said Talmadge should play Marie Antoinette and The Merchant of Venice‘s Portia, so that should give you a good idea of the types of parts people associated with her: noble, charming, troubled.\n\nIn her superstar heyday, Smilin’ Through was considered Talmadge’s signature film. Like a great many Talmadge vehicles, it was based on a hot stage property. Written in the wake of World War I, the play follows a bitter old man haunted by the death of his fiancée Moonyeen. Her ghost is always near him, but his rage prevents her from being able to make her presence known. The sentimental story touched the public deeply, making a film version inevitable.\n\nTalmadge got the juicy dual role of the crinoline and corseted Moonyeen and the more modern Kathleen. She acquits herself well in both parts. I wouldn’t call this Talmadge’s best film, but the script allows her to indulge both melodramatic and comic moments, from a touching death scene to a humorous interlude in which she has to ditch an unwanted beau at a dance. If anything, one might accuse this film of being a one-woman show. The other actors are competent, but the only other performance that stands out is Harrison Ford as Moonyeen’s jilted lover. He has a desperate, compelling energy that stands in stark contrast to the other performers, but he appears all too briefly.\n\nThe movie itself is handsomely produced. The story touches on themes of death and love, and the ghost angle is handled well. I was reminded of the spiritualist themes in 1921’s The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In the wake of the war, spiritualism came into vogue, with people hoping for a sign that their dead loved ones could still be reached beyond the grave. Smilin’ Through‘s appeal was no doubt indebted to this interest in the spirit world.\n\nBut the big attraction is still Talmadge. And while I don’t know if she will ever receive a proper, full-scale re-evaluation in the silent film community– let alone film history at large– Smilin’ Through is a good showcase for the expressive versatility Talmadge’s public so prized in her.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Hollywood Story by Joel W. Finler\n\n“The Lady of the Vase” by Adlea Rogers St. John, Photoplay, August 1923, Vol. 24, Issue 3\n\nSilent Stars by Jeanine Basinger\n\n#4 – GRANDMA’S BOY\n\nRelease date: September 3, 1922\n\nBox office (est.): 1.1 million\n\nSummary: A cowardly young man (Harold Lloyd) is given a magic talisman by his grandmother (Anna Townsend), who claims it makes its owner invincible. When a criminal starts terrorizing the town, the boy puts the charm to use, but will it work as planned?\n\n(Since Harold Lloyd is the star attraction of 3 and 4 on the list, I just decided to combine the two into one piece.)\n\n#3 – DR. JACK\n\nRelease date: November 26, 1922\n\nBox office (est.): 1.275 million\n\nSummary: The insidious Dr. Saulsbourg (Eric Mayne) gets rich off a supposedly ill young heiress known as the Sick-Little-Well-Girl (Mildred Davis), shutting her away from sunshine, socialization, and anything remotely resembling fun. The commonsensical Dr. Jack (Harold Lloyd) is called in to give the girl’s desperate father a second opinion, but Saulsbourg will do anything to prevent his patient’s recovery.\n\nFor most Americans in the 1920s, Harold Lloyd was the reigning king of comedy. He made more films than Charlie Chaplin and his films tended to have more staying power at the box office than Buster Keaton’s. The great appeal was that Lloyd’s “Glasses character” was closer to earth than the down-on-his luck Tramp or Keaton’s restrained persona—Lloyd was the boy next door, the energetic go-getter out to snag the American Dream by the coat-tails.\n\nIn 1922, two Lloyd pictures were top draws at the box office: the first was Lloyd’s debut feature Grandma’s Boy and the second was Dr. Jack. What strikes me most watching these two movies back to back is how versatile Lloyd’s screen persona is. In Grandma’s Boy, he’s a cowardly young man who has to grow into heroism, while in Dr. Jack he’s a confident but static character who rescues a damsel-in-distress from a bad situation. And yet both are undeniably the Glasses character—resourceful and optimistic.\n\nWhile neither film is as great as Lloyd’s third feature—the immortal Safety Last!—both are quick, charming treats. Lloyd keeps the action moving at a brisk pace and packs every scene with great business. Mildred Davis is the leading lady in both and I always thought it was a shame that she would shortly retire from the screen after marrying Lloyd. The two have sweet, natural chemistry—obviously a side effect of their real life involvement.\n\nOf the two films, I prefer Dr. Jack, if only because it’s slightly less sentimental than Grandma’s Boy. It also has one of my favorite sequences in any Lloyd feature: Dr. Jack pretends to be a homicidal maniac (don’t ask) and terrorizes everyone in a dark house. It’s like something out of a Scooby Doo episode and it’s absolutely wonderful.\n\nBut then again, Grandma’s Boy has the scene where Lloyd confuses a box of moth balls with candy, and then he starts making the most reaction image-worthy expressions possible…\n\nOh damn, I can’t pick between them after all!\n\nSources:\n\nThe Best Moving Pictures of 1922-1923 by Robert E.

He has everything, from fame to a loving wife (Lila Lee), but trouble comes in the form of Dona Sol (Nita Naldi), an aristocratic femme fatale out to make Gallardo her newest plaything. Consumed by a passion he can barely control, Gallardo finds everything he holds dear hanging in the balance.\n\nNineteen twenty-one had been Rudolph Valentino’s golden year. His stardom was established in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, then made secure by The Sheik. Both were massive box office hits. What could he do to top such an iconic duo?\n\nA more dramatic tour de force was in order. Embarrassed by the bodice ripping antics he’d been up to in The Sheik, Valentino returned to Ibanez for his next film, an adaptation of the 1909 novel Blood and Sand. The story of the rise and fall of a matador would allow Valentino to showcase a wider range. Juan starts the film as a wily youth and ends the film a chastened but sadder man. Seen as little more than a pretty boy, no doubt Valentino was eager to show the public his dramatic chops.\n\nProduction was frustrating for the newly minted star. Valentino wanted to shoot the movie on-location in Spain. Paramount figured a few costumes and props imported from Spain to a Hollywood backlot would be just as good (and far cheaper). Valentino wanted George Fitzmaurice in the director’s chair. Paramount claimed Fitzmaurice turned the offer down, then offered up Fred Niblo instead (Valentino would later learn from Fitzmaurice himself that the director was never even asked, much to the actor’s fury). Valentino learned real bullfighting moves, but the bulk of the scenes in the ring were cobbled from stock footage.\n\nThese setbacks irritated Valentino, but they weren’t enough to prevent the film from becoming the second-biggest hit of the year, as well as a critical darling. Some compared the film favorably to DW Griffith’s tear-jerker Broken Blossoms. The day of the film’s Rialto Theater premiere, patrons starting lining up before noon, eager to get a ticket. Mary Pickford was also a fan, saying she loved the picture enough to see it twice.\n\nBlood and Sand is a hotblooded melodrama, the sort that won’t appeal to everyone, but for those of us who go for that sort of thing, it is a delight. The atmosphere is sensual and torrid, and Nita Naldi is a campy delight as the femme fatale (she literally bites Valentino in lust at one point). If I have any issue with the film, it’s that it gets a bit overly moralizing at times, something that’s more downplayed in the film’s 1940 remake.\n\nHowever, I can’t fault this movie too much because it did give Valentino something he always desperately craved: the chance to exercise his dramatic skills. Juan is a fleshed-out character brought low by his own lust for life. The very quality that makes him such an appealing guy is also what makes him easy prey for Dona Sol. So while this isn’t close to my favorite Valentino vehicle, it is a great showcase for his talent, so often ignored in the glare of his tragic off-screen demise.\n\nSources:\n\nDark Lover: The Life and Death of Rudolph Valentino by Emily Leider\n\nThe Hollywood Story by Joel W. Finler\n\n#1 – ROBIN HOOD\n\nRelease date: October 18, 1922\n\nBox office (est.): 2.5 million\n\nSummary: Brash and jolly King Richard (Wallace Beery) rushes to the Crusades, leaving his cruel-hearted brother Prince John (Sam De Grasse) in charge of England. John’s tyrannical grasp inspires Maid Marian (Enid Bennett) to reach out to the dashing Earl of Huntingdon (Douglas Fairbanks) for help. Unwilling to pull his king from his “Holy Crusade,” Huntingdon runs back to England and takes on the persona of Robin Hood, giving aid to the poor and hell to John’s regime.\n\nDouglas Fairbanks racked up a great many hits in the 1920s, but arguably none were as loved as his 1922 Robin Hood. He’d already swashbuckled his way through The Mark of Zorro and The Three Musketeers, but Robin Hood would be produced on a scale that surpassed the both of them. Fairbanks had enormous sets constructed and collected a library of hundreds of reference materials related to Robin Hood and the Middle Ages. Immense labor and cost went into recreating medieval England, ensuring this would be Fairbanks’ biggest onscreen adventure to date. The effort paid off handsomely, with both the public and the critics won over by Fairbanks’ romantic yet brutal blockbuster.\n\nThough Robin Hood was Douglas Fairbanks’ greatest financial smash, it has become the most maligned effort of his golden period. The most common complaint is that the movie takes too darn long to get to the actual Robin Hood segments—the first 70 minutes cover the hero’s life as the noble Earl of Huntingdon, where he meets and falls for Maid Marian despite his fear of women, earns the enmity of Prince John and Sir Guy of Gisbourne due to his undivided loyalty to King Richard, and finds himself leaving the Crusades when he hears of how England is being oppressed by John. Having that contrarian streak in me that cannot be denied, I’m going to defend Fairbanks’ choice in delaying the appearance of the expected Robin Hood scenes.\n\nThis Robin Hood obviously cannot avoid comparisons with the later, more celebrated Errol Flynn film from 1938. That is a far leaner movie, having Robin Hood in Lincoln green the moment he first rides into the three-strip Technicolor frame. However—and to stave off the bringing out of the guillotine, none of this is meant as a insult to the 1938 version, which I consider a practically perfect movie—Fairbanks’ approach allows for a more epic and emotionally rich story. His Robin gets to come into his own as a hero, going from a callow youth to a man dedicated to “God, his king, and his lady.”\n\nNo one would deny the film is largely escapist, but there is a darkness to it too. Prince John’s tyranny is illustrated through some horrifying scenes, such as a man having his eyes burned out of his skull for daring to hunt in royal territory or a woman being whipped in front of her own child for refusing John’s “address.” At one point, Huntingdon believes Marian has died and his transformation into Robin Hood is prompted in part by grief. When he turns into Robin Hood, an intertitle describes his subsequent existence as “bitter but joyous.” There is always a dangerous edge to Fairbanks’ Robin Hood, a simmering rage that makes all the broad grinning and rabble rousing take on a slight air of the grotesque.\n\nDon’t get the impression that this is a mud and blood vision of the Robin Hood story though—we’re still miles away from the bitter, revisionist taste of movies like 1978’s Robin and Marian or Ridley Scott’s 2010 version. This is a film where Robin skips around like a five-year-old on cocaine—though admittedly, few five-year-olds on cocaine could break a man’s back with their bare hands, as Robin does here. This is also a film where the Crusades and King Richard are presented as noble, which would likely make any historian cringe.\n\nHowever, Fairbanks’ Robin Hood is not a documentary—it is pure cinematic mythology. It combines several different elements of the Robin Hood story that have emerged over the centuries, synthesizing them into a satisfying whole. Even the way its many long shots are composed and lit is reminiscent of 19th century paintings of medieval pageantry and scenes– no interest in gritty “realism” pervades the film in any sense. Watching it again, I was reminded a bit of John Boorman’s Excalibur, because both films do such wonderful work in evoking an otherworldly sense of legend, completely, thoroughly, and without any shred of irony or shame. And to be honest, in a cynical postmodern age, there’s something refreshing in that.\n\nSources:\n\nDouglas Fairbanks by Jeffrey Vance\n\nThe First King of Hollywood: The life of Douglas Fairbanks by Tracy Goessel"
