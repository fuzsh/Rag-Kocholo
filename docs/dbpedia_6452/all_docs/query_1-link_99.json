Released in the summer of 2001, Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick's A.I. introduced movie audiences to David Swinton,a robot boy, desperately seek- ing his mother's love. Brilliantly played by 1 3-year-old Haley Joel Osment, David searches for self, reality, and security through bizarre environments like Rouge City and Flesh Fair.Though the film is set in the distant future, Monica Swinton's portrayal of a mother, unable to meet the needs of the son she desired and \"imprinted\" with, rings sadly true in the real world of early-twenty-first- century America. Published earlier in 2001, Ron Taffel's The Second Family argued that in modern America \"most parents don't understand their teenagers\" and \"aren't able to pay the right kind of attention to them.\"Taffel,a child and family thera- pist, says the most common comment he hears from kids as they discuss their parents is the phrase \"They don't have a clue.\"On \"planet youth,\"asTaffel calls it, parents have little\"gravitational pull\"and the dominant ideology is\"live and let live.\" It is a world of moral relativism and rubbery rules, where the primary impetus is comfort, and the primary teacher is pop culture. What our children and adolescents learn from television, movies, music, and other media has become increasingly controversial in recent years. Media messages and marketing were the target of Republican presidential candi- date Bob Dole in 1 996 and Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieber- man in 2000. The way the movies and other media talk to and about adolescents has also attracted increasing academic attention. In August 2000, the Journal of ^3 Adolescent Health devoted an entire issue to the complex relationship between Generation media content, the nature and needs of adolescent audiences, and the con- Mukiplex text in which media messages are consumed. While much of this interest is dominated by a protectionist approach, there is some indication that a more balanced and constructive approach is also being considered. In June 2001, representatives of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy released a draft document on media literacy and substance abuse at the National Media Education Conference in Austin. Among other\"best practices\" noted in the position paper were the need to recognize the pleasure young people derive from the media,and the need to avoid media bashing. This view is consistent with Great Transitions, a 1995 report from the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development/The world of the adolescent,\" the report said, \"cannot be understood without understanding the profound influence of the mass media . . .in shaping young people's attitudes and val- ues.\" Pay It Forward, Welcome to the Dollhouse, This Boy's Life, Kids, and numer- ous other examples of the teen screen provide ample evidence of this. It is in this context that Timothy Shary's Generation Multiplex must be con- sidered. It represents an important contribution to our understanding of the relationship between youth and the mass media, in this case movies. From both a personal and a professional perspective, I welcome this work, which builds on themes and issues I addressed in The Cinema of Adolescence in 1 985. At the end of that book I said it was not intended as the definitive study of youth and the movies. Rather, I hoped that it would be seen as an attempt to \"map out a cinematic terrain, the geography of which must now be thrown open for further exploration.\" Generation Multiplex represents the ongoing need to respect and research both youth and youth culture. While the movies and other media talk constantly to young people about drugs, alcohol, sexuality, and other controversial topics, political pressures and the remnants of the nation's Puritan origins continue to complicate frank and open discussion on these same subjects. In June 2001, for example, Surgeon General David Satcher called for a national dialogue on sexuality and sex edu- cation that did more than simply advocate the teaching of abstinence. Con- servative groups like Focus on the Family immediately called for his removal from office. At the same time, conservative film critic Michael Medved's col- umn complained that teen movies like crazy/beautiful and The Fast and the Furious were guilty of \"sending utterly irresponsible messages directly to a youthful audience.\" Ironically, at the same time young movie patrons were gaining easy access El to these films,and Surgeon General Satcher was being criticized for advocating Foreword open communication with our young people, the Supreme Court overturned a Massachusetts law that aimed to protect young people from tobacco advertis- ing near parks or schools. We appear to have created a society where parents do not feel comfortable talking to their children about sexuality or other contro- versial issues; where conservative political pressures and curriculum constraints limit what teachers can say to their students; where the mass media, protected by the First Amendment, are free to say and show almost anything. Clearly we cannot continue to create an environment in which on the one hand we lament the negative impact movies and other media have on ouryoung, while on the other hand we refuse to take the matter seriously by providing young people with the skills of critical inquiry that enable them to both appre- ciate and critique the role of mass media in their lives and in society as a whole. In the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and other Western nations, me- dia literacy has long been an established and legitimate part of the curricu- lum.Television,advertising,and the movies are considered legitimate subjects of study.This movement remains in its infancy in the United States, surely the most mass-mediated nation on earth. But groups like the Alliance for a Media Literate America, the National Telemedia Council, and a small but growing number of campuses, including my own, are trying to nurture the movement. Properly understood and utilized, youth media can serve as a bridge be- tween the past and the present. In the process, it may well lay the foundations for our future. Those who fear and lament the influence media have on our young would do well to learn from that media. In A.I., David's mother and father do not possess the strength of character nor the moral fortitude to assume responsibility for the child they wanted. Instead, they abandon him to the woods and the wild where he struggles to be true, and real and unique, and most important of all, loved. Like so many modern parents, Monica found herself unable to tell her child about the world. In the end, he learned about it from other sources. So it is with so many of our young people and their families today. If the movies talk to them and we do not, dare we blame the children or the movies for what they learn? If, as adults, we are to have relevance and purpose in the lives of our chil- dren on their odyssey to adulthood, we must share David's dream. To put it simply, it is time for all of us to \"get real.\" DAVID CONSIDINE BOONE, NORTH CAROLINA SUMMER 2ool Generation Multiplex REFERENCES Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development.

PREFACE In any study of contemporary popular culture,the field of subjects changes so quickly, and often so comprehensively, that authors are stymied in making claims about\"current\"trends and themes. I have certainly found this to be the case with studying teen cinema for the past decade, as each revision of this project involved substantial changes not only to the films cited, but to the claims made about patterns in the movie industry, youth styles,and the films' overall significance. As this book goes to press at the end of 2001 , another wave of fascinating films about youth is bringing further changes — and complexity — to the rep- resentation ofteenagers in American media. Save the Last Dance and ThePrin- cess Diaries have had a surprisingly wide appeal, and freshly provocative fea- tures like Ghost World, Donnie Darko, L.I.E., Our Song, and George Washington are still gaining notoriety in more limited release. Perhaps the surest sign of a revived teen cinema is the appearance of nostalgic homages, such as Wet Hot American Summer and Not Another Teen Movie. Alasjust as I have been unable to give thorough analytic attention to some of the great teen films mentioned herein, I can only bring glancing coverage to many of the new youth genre products that are currently changing the cultural landscape. While I have incorporated the newest relevant films when- ever possible, this study is primarily focused on the period from 1980 to 1999. The teen films of the early twenty-first century will undoubtedly continue to be quite intriguing, and will certainly be worthy of further coverage in other studies, if not also a future edition of this book. I invite correspondence from readers who may wish to participate in such endeavors, and who have ideas on how the current volume may be improved. TIMOTHY SHARY WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS OCTOBER 2ool THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This book grew out of my doctoral dissertation at the University of Massachu- setts at Amherst, so first and foremost, I express my deep gratitude to my com- mittee — Carolyn Anderson (chair), Martin Norden,and Catherine Portuges — who were encouraging, informative, and supportive during the early produc- tion of this work. I owe Carolyn a special debt of appreciation, for her lessons have been indescribably valuable in shaping me as a film scholar,and her teach- ing has been inspirational: she is wise, witty, dedicated, ambitious, and end- lessly energetic. At the University of Texas Press, my sincere thanks go to Jim Burr for having faith in this book from the start and keeping the faith throughout the revision process, and to Leslie Doyle Tingle for seeing it through its final stages. My family — Cecilia, Robert, and Kevin — have been incredibly supportive in this endeavor as well, and I am as proud of them for enduring my struggle as they may be of me for surviving it. My sweet wife Rebecca Maloney has also provided me with the love, reason, and sheer fun that kept me going through the many years I worked on this project. So many friends came forth to help me with this book that I am sure I can- not name them all, but in one way or another all of the following people offered me advice, ideas, data, hope, sympathy, and/or willing participation in watching some of the most exciting and unusual films of the past genera- tion of American cinema: Richard Brown, Anne Gecko, Darci and Rich Cramer- Benjamin, Susan Ericsson, Chris Goodwin, Devin and Rachel Griffiths, Perrin Harkins, Sara Hunicke, Katie LeBesco, Nancy Inouye, Jon Kitzen, Chris LeBel, Gary Marcus, Mark Mierswa,Carolyn Moore,Kelly Mullaly,Nicola Paterson, Jesse Rossa,Tom Scully, John Shields, Mike Wolpe,ZachWoods,andZsofiaZvolensky. I would also like to highlight the contributions made to this book by two of d my former students, Jon Lupo (who helped me work out the title) and Louisa Generation Shein,both of whom provided significant advice, even under crunch conditions. Multiplex Major revisions of this book resulted from the thoughtful and careful cri- tiques of David Considine at Appalachian State University and Kathy Merlock Jackson at Virginia Wesleyan College; their suggestions helped shape my lengthy dissertation into an accessible book. For help with specific research aspects, I thank Brian Taves of the Library of Congress and Alexandra Siebel of New York University. Thanks to Christine Holmlund at the University of Ten- nessee for sharing valuable ideas on issues of youth sexuality. Further, I must thank my great students at Clark University, where I was first invited to teach a course on youth cinema in 1997 (thanks also to my col- leagues in the Screen Studies program, Marcia Butzel and Marvin D'Lugo). I have since taught newer versions of that course at UMass in 1999, and again at Clark in 2000. The students in these courses and others at Clark and UMass have helped me to develop and shape many of the ideas that are contained herein. The Higgins School of Humanities at Clark University provided a faculty research grant to support the final revisions of the manuscript in 2000-2001 ; my thanks to Higgins School director Janette Greenwood and assistant Lisa Coakley. At least one video supplier deserves special thanks:Video to Go in Amherst, Massachusetts. Stills were provided by Jerry Ohlinger's Movie Material Store, except figure 6.3 from Miramax Films and figure 7.1 from Paramount Pictures. Two teachers in my precollege years had perhaps the most profound ef- fect on my early education:Ty Walker, who taught me into my teenage years, and Lee March, who taught me out of them. Mr. Walker was the first teacher who demonstrated to me the legitimacy of studying movies as well as enjoy- ing them (he had seen Star Wars 17 times when I first met him), and Ms. March sparked my early academic film interests, pushing me to write my first essay on a movie, which prophetically turned out to be The Breakfast Club. These two teachers not only helped propel me in my educational pursuits,they pro- vided the models that I still follow, showing me and their other students the personal and passionate nature of being a great teacher. I can only hope that this work will similarly inspire other students, regardless of age, to study cin- ema and to make the most of their youth. GENERATION MULTIPLEX THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK American cinema in the late twentieth century revealed a curious and often inconsistent cultural fascination with stories about and images of young people. Various film trends catering to young audiences had emerged over past generations, but movies in the last 20 years of the century appeared al- most fixated on capturing certain youth styles and promoting certain per- spectives on the celebration (or really, survival) of adolescence. Many argu- ments persist as to why teenagers have been targeted by Hollywood: youth have disposable incomes that they enjoy spending on entertainment;today's children become the consumptive parents of tomorrow; filmmakers engage in the vicarious experiences of their own lost youth. All of these points are valid, yet this book argues not as much for the reasons behind youth repre- sentation as for the issues and trends that representation engenders. As evi- denced by the latest massive outpouring of American youth films in the late 1990s, and the parallel production of teen-oriented television shows, maga- zines, and multimedia outlets, as well as the attention paid to youth attitudes and behaviors in the wake of various scandals, crimes, and accomplishments, the imaging of contemporary youth has become indicative of our deepest social and personal concerns. Consider, for instance, Todd Solondz's 1996 film Welcome to the Dollhouse. As we approach the bittersweet climax, the awkward adolescent heroine, Dawn Weiner (Heather Matarazzo), is preparing to declare her unrequited ro- mantic longings to an older boy at a party. Dressed in a colorful but garish outfit, Dawn gazes at her crush until she decides that this is her moment: she stands holding her breath, fists clenched, mustering up all her strength to take this plunge, looking as if she could explode. In this one image, Solondz evokes the very intensity that is the nature of growing up, for Dawn is not only con- KB fronting her tormented affection for an older boy, she is facing the inevitable Generation conflict of becoming an adult. Multiplex All dramas thrive on conflict, and the process of maturing is a natural con- flict familiar to everyone by their teenage years. While many filmgoers freely participate in screen fantasies about the possibilities of life as a secret agent or of saving a loved one from the clutches of death, most of our lives are filled with less spectacular phenomena, such as how we come to be accepted by society, discover romance, have sex, gain employment, make moral decisions, and learn about the world and who we are in it. These are the phenomena that most of us first encounter in our adolescence, and how we handle them largely determines how we live the rest of our lives. The gravity of adoles- cence thus makes for compelling drama, even if many of us would rather for- get those trying years. Understanding how we learn and grow in our youth is integral to understanding who we become as adults. Since the 1950s the American cinema, with varying interests, has been relying on people under 30 to pay for movies about their daily dramas and fantasies. 1 However, there has not always been a prolific output of coming- of-age stories by Hollywood, and the themes of youth films have changed considerably since the days of young Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish in the early 1900s. One of the telling dilemmas of youth films since cinema began is that while they address young people they are not produced by young people, for children and teens are effectively restricted from the commercial filmmak- ing process. Thus, screen images of youth have always been traditionally fil- tered through adult perspectives. Virtually all feature films ever made about youth have been produced by filmmakers over 20, even though many are now produced by filmmakers under 30, and most recent youth films have become as complex and sophisticated as adult dramas, no longer content to show- case the trite frivolity of beach parties or the overwrought warfare of urban gangs and schools. Since the early 1980s a number of distinct subgenres and character types within the genre of \"youth/teen/young adult\" films have emerged and have offered richly provocative images that question the chang- ing concepts of youth in America. The specific number of these categories is arguable, and surely too large to detail in one volume, so I offer here an analy- sis of five subgenres — containing 18 of the most significant youth film styles and movie roles — to demonstrate the changing nature of teen representa- tion in American media during the past generation. 2 Young people have always been a concern in American film history, both in terms of their images on screen and their reception of films as an audience. In the earliest days of cinema there did not exist a distinct youth genre, nor U for that matter much of an agreed social sense of what constituted youth, introduction: Children in the early twentieth century often left school by the age of 14 to The Cinematic begin jobs (only 6.4 percent of young Americans completed high school in image ofYomh 1900) and many were married and having children by 18, a condition that kept the state of \"youth\" limited to just a few years between childhood and adulthood. 3 The reception of movies at that time was also affected by social fears about their corruptive potential, especially regarding their influence on children. Many early-1 900s moral guardians preached about the dangers of exposing children to typically adult-oriented dramas, and rather than make films that specifically catered to a young audience, the fledgling movie in- dustry tended to side with concerns over propriety. 4 By the 1 920s, Hollywood formed the Hays Office and began formal evaluations and restrictions on the moral content of American films, and despite a choice few popular films that featured young characters of the time — Lillian Gish in Broken Blossoms (1 919), Mary Pickford in Pollyanna (1 920), Jackie Coogan in The Kid (1 921 ), Baby Peggy in Captain January (1924) — the industry took a clear position on youth films by the 1930s: children were either preadolescent (such as Shirley Temple or the kids in Our Gang) or were developed into early adulthood (such as in the Andy Hardy series starring Mickey Rooney or the old-before-their-time Dead End Kids). In either case, young people certainly did not have on-screen dis- cussions about otherwise typical developmental issues like sexuality, drug or alcohol use, or family dysfunction. The notable youth films that followed in the years after the Great Depres- sion tended to be optimistic and endearing fables starring the likes of Deanna Durbin, Judy Garland, and Rooney, but these films were still directed at and most often seen by an adult audience, or by a family audience consisting of both parents and children. Hollywood studios promoted these small troupes of young stars (also including Frankie Darro,Bonita Granville, Freddie Bartho- lomew, Dickie Moore, and Joyce Reynolds) who came to represent the con- temporary ideals, if not the realistic conditions, of youth. Then with the reso- lution of World War II, a distinct population in America began to emerge: teenagers. Gradually the age between childhood and adulthood came to be codified, debated, celebrated, and perhaps mostsignificantly,elongated. 5 More young people stayed in school,and with the arrival of postwar prosperity, more began attending college. Other factors contributed to the burgeoning pres- ence of the teenager in the 1950s: the greater availability of automobiles, which allowed youth to travel and thus achieve a certain independence; the MM recovering economy, which gave many teens extra money for entertainment Generation outside the home;the popular reception of rock and roll music, which clearly Multiplex flew in the face of previous standards; and the influence of television, which, while giving all Americans a new common entertainment medium, also kept more adults at home. In terms of the U.S. film industry, two landmark legal cases set the stage for the eventual proliferation of young adult fare.TheTara- mount Case\" was handed down by the Supreme Court in 1948; soon thereaf- ter began the process by which major movie studios divested their holdings in theaters, giving rise to more small independent studios that would take advantage of their increased theatrical access by catering to niche audiences like teenagers. 6 Then the important so-called \"Miracle Decision\" by the Court in 1952 brought certain First Amendment protections to films, thereby open- ing the door for depictions of a wider range of moral issues on-screen; this development attracted young people to theaters where they could view more \"adulf'dramas than were available on television. 7 However, Hollywood studios did not suddenly bank on hedonistic teen roles in the 1 950s:their process of introducing the postwar teenager was care- ful if not apprehensive, as they gradually exploited the ephebiphobia — fear of teenagers — that was seeping into popular culture and politics. After a few notable\"clean teen\" performances in the 1940s by Jeanne Crain {Margie, 1946), Jane Powell (A Date with Judy, 1948),and Elizabeth Taylor {Little Women, 1949), the archetypal '50s teen performer was embodied in James Dean, whose per- formance in Rebel Without a Cause (1 955) is probably the most influential dem- onstration of pure teen angst in American cinema. Marlon Brando had already showcased the young rebel image in The Wild One (1953), but Dean's affected demeanor was more enduring. Hollywood then continued to mold other per- formers into troubled youth, as in the milder but still afflicted roles of Natalie Wood (in Rebel Without a Cause, Marjorie Morningstar [1 958], and West Side Story [1961]), John Saxon (in Rock, Pretty Baby [1956], The Unguarded Moment [1956], and The Restless Years [1958]), and Brandon De Wilde (in Blue Denim [1 959], All Fall Down [1 962], and Hud [1 963]). Perhaps a more notable trend than the emergence of these new young performers was the film industry's fresh confrontation with the conditions of youth. Rebel showcased the high school outcast who couldn't fit in (while also considering alcoholism, family dynamics, basic crime, and in more concealed terms, homosexuality); Blackboard Jungle (1955) dramatized the potentially violent conditions of urban high schools and tangentially introduced rock music to American cinema, giving rise to the teen \"rock movie\" that would Jim (James Dean) struggles to express his archetypal angst to his overbearing mother (Ann Doran) in RebelWithout a Cause (19^5). become a subgenre thereafter; and Peyton Place (1957) and Splendor in the Grass (1961) demonstrated the supposed dangers of teenage sexuality. Each of these films dealt with issues important to young adults, but now that Hol- lywood was finally making films about the difficulty of being young, a reac- tionary movement began, as usual in the film industry, in binary form: films were made that avoided or toned down the dilemmas of youth for the sake of celebrating its carefree aspects, or films were made to further exploit and enflame the dangers of teen delinquency and decadence. In other words,good kids were divided from bad kids. Thus appeared a wave of inane beach films in the '60s (many featuring Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello after their well-attended Beach Party in 1 963) as well as the popular Gidget series (start- ing in 1 959), alongside a lesser-seen but nonetheless visible output of youth exploitation films, a genre that emerged as early as 1936 with Reefer Madness and was carried on by City Across the River in 1 949 and sustained in such pro- ductions as Teenage Devil Dolls (1 952), Teenage Crime Wave (1 955), High School Confidential! (1 958), This Rebel Breed (1 960), Teenage Strangler (1 964), and The Wild Angels (1966). 8 As my study shows, this reactive and divisive pattern of the movie industry is a trend that persists to this day. By the early 1970s, after the implementation of the Motion Picture Asso- KB ciation of America's ratings system (in 1 968) and the national suffrage of 1 8- Gemration year-olds (in 1 971 ), not to mention the young ages at which boys were being Multiplex drafted to fight in Vietnam, American youth began to have a different sense of their identity than that which had been provided for them in so many of the happier, hipper '60s films. The dark and more rebellious aspects of youth that had emerged in the '50s teen films continued in counterculture produc- tions like Wild in theStreets (1968),Eosy/?/der(1969),/?.P.M.,and The Strawberry Statement (1 970). As was the case with films of the previous generation, most of these movies were not about adolescents but rather young adultsj'ust leav- ing high school or in college. In fact, Hollywood virtually abandoned its prac- tice of promoting teenage performers in the '60s and certainly had very few to account for in the '70s (the three prominent exceptions being Jodie Foster, Tatum O'Neal, and Robby Benson). After the dearth of teen stars and films in the 1970s, Hollywood could have maintained its lower output of youth films in the 1980s, but instead the in- dustry concentrated more on young adult dramas than ever before.The most likely factor contributing to this was the emergence of another icon of youth independence, the shopping mall. The mall became a scene of teen congre- gation where arcades and food courts replaced the pool halls and soda foun- tains of the past. Furthermore, since the '70s, following the dramatic decline of American movie theaters, Hollywood had come to rely on the centraliza- tion of multiple theaters in large retail centers to increase the number of screen venues and to offer moviegoers greater variety and convenience. Thus the multiplex was born. With the relocation of most movie theaters into or near shopping malls in the 1 980s, the need to cater to the young audiences who frequented those malls became apparent to Hollywood, and those audiences formed the first generation of multiplex moviegoers. The clearest result of the multiplex movement was a voluminous outpour- ing of films directed to and featuring teens, but in order to avoid a stagnating homogenization of the teen genre, Hollywood revised its '50s formula by in- tensifying the narrative range of youth films through placing teenage char- acters in previously established genres with more dramatic impact (gory hor- ror, dance musicals, sex comedies), and as a result, a new variety of character types grew out of this generic expansion. Given the categorical choices of- fered by the multiplex theater, teens in the '80s were then able to go to the mall and select the particular youth movie experience that most appealed to them,and Hollywood tried to keep up with changing teen interests and styles to ensure ongoing profits. This led to constantly evolving efforts by the film industry to maintain the youth market through further generic expansions mm and revisions; more significantly for the audience, teens were then exposed introduction: to a wider range of characters and situations that directly addressed their cur- The Cinematic rent social conditions, even if many of the films that did so clearly had puerile image ofYomh provocation as their motive. Unlike the '50s when screen teens were steered down relatively rigid, righteous paths, the '80s teens encountered a complex- ity of moral choices and personal options on which the multiplex movies thrived. This gave teenage movie audiences at the end of the twentieth cen- tury a greater sense of presence in popular media, a deeper potential to be influenced by the films they saw, and a wider range of options from which they could construct and compare their sense of self. The late 70s suggested the teen trends to come, as the popularity of such films as Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Grease (1978) with John Travolta — both of which combined music, sex (or the repression thereof), and style — created a segue to the more dynamic stories that young audiences would soon demand. A handful of other films truly inaugurated new cycles:two 1978 American films, the low-budget sensation Halloween and the college farce Animal House, as well as two unassuming Canadian films,Mearba//s (1 979) and Porky's (1981). These were the starting guns of the new youth subgenres of the '80s. Animal House, Meatballs, and Porky's were raucous comedies featur- ing goofy and/or hormonal youth pursuing pleasure at college, summer camp, and a '50s-era high school, respectively, and their successes spawned numer- ous imitations over the next few years that featured desperate variations on this storyline (with such suggestive titles as Goin'Allthe Way [1981], The Last American Virgin [1 982], Losin'lt, Getting It On, and The First Turn-On [all 1983], Screwballs, Joy of Sex, and The Wild Life [all 1 984]). The new abundance of teen sexuality on screen also coincided with an increasing awareness that the age of first intercourse was dropping for American youth, and the few earlier films that solemnly featured teens losing their virginity — for example, Rich Kids (1979), The Blue Lagoon (1980), Endlesslove (1981)— faded into the new ap- peal of carnal comedies about the plight of sexual pursuits. 9 At the same time, Halloween and similar films like Friday the 13th (1980) and Slumber Party Mas- sacre (1982) were capitalizing on the reactionary aspect of teen sexuality, slaughtering wholesale those youth who deigned to cross the threshold of sexual awareness, even though these films usually hinged on a major suspen- sion of realism. The early '80s then marked the beginning of a new era in Ameri- can youth movie production with the release of numerous popular teen hor- ror films in 1981 and the release of Fast Times at Ridgemont High in 1982, the KB first commercially successful hybrid of the contemporary sex, school, and de- Generation linquency elements. Multiplex Between 1980 and 1985, there were six major approaches to youth cin- ema offered by Hollywood, most revised from past trends in the genre: the horror film, the science film, the sex comedy, the romantic melodrama, the juvenile delinquent drama, and the school picture that often borrowed ge- neric elements from the rest. Of these approaches, the horror film tended to offer the highest grosses (literally and figuratively) and often showed the least knowledge of true youth conditions. These films were a runaway success in the early '80s and may in many ways be responsible for bringing a new im- age of youth to American cinema, however incomplete that image was. Within the youth horror subgenre, graphic depictions of sex and violence had come to be expected, and such previous taboos as the depiction of \"underage\" nu- dity were broached. The '80s youth horror subgenre depicted teens not only as sexually active but as morally culpable for their explorations of sexuality, paying with their lives for their indiscretions. The youth horror film — espe- cially in its \"slasher\" and \"supernatural\" varieties that I explore in Chapter 4 — has brought attention to teen sexuality and morality, and other issues, by the most dramatic means possible. The science film represents the smallest subgenre but I will argue that its inclusion is nonetheless crucial to understanding the industrial treatment of adult and youth difference. The youth science film had early stirrings in EI (1 982) but came into its own in 1 983 with WarGames and then continued with further nuclear-era projects like RealGenius (1 985) and The Manhattan Project (1 986). Youth science films then went into a clear decline as the Cold War came to a close, and even films featuring youth using computers and video games (Arcade in 1993, Evolver in 1995) were primarily relegated to smaller studios after the '80s, suggesting that Hollywood was aware of changing cultural con- ditions for youth using technologies of power but chose not to celebrate this liberatory potential. Considering the very vocal debates around children's in- creasing access to technology, the continuing lack of films about the topic may signal a certain repression. The sex comedy and romantic melodrama are companions, for despite the often gratuitous content of many of these films, they all consider the trial by fire that is the discovery of young lust and love. All youth love films can be categorized by identifying the obstacle to the protagonists' romance (class, race, age, distance), but in this study I focus on the obstacle most commonly portrayed since Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet: familial conflict.Throughout the early '80s, the depiction of teens' sexual pursuits was primarily ribald and MM explicit, as in Private School and Risky Business (1 983), but by the mid-'80s a introduction: distinct shift took place toward more serious and sensitive representations of The Cinematic teen relationships, particularly in the films of John Hughes, such as Pretty in image ofYomh Pink (1986). The stakes of young romantic and sexual practice grew higher in the era of AIDS, and by the mid-'90s, films about youth having sex portrayed a greater diversity of issues that sometimes accompany these practices, as with the three topics I address here: virginity, pregnancy, and homosexuality. The output of juvenile delinquent dramas has been the most voluminous of youth films, although their attention to contemporary realism is much de- bated, since they offer a rich appreciation for the aggressive expressions that teens most crave and parents most fear. A clear range of immorality can be studied across this subgenre,from the harmless mischief that youth enact in daily life — such examples as Ferris Beuller's Day Off (1 986), Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead (1991) and Snow Day (2000)— to the life-threatening crimi- nality of teen thugs in films like Class of 1984 (1982), China Girl (1987), Kids (1995), and American History X (1 998). I look at five specific delinquent styles that represent this spectrum, starting with movies about \"deviant dancing\" and concluding with the African American crime drama of the early '90s, a successful and influential trend that brought a distinct sense of harsh ten- sion to youth films but nonetheless faded in the mid-'90s. School films are probably the most foundational subgenre of youth films, yet they often consider teenage identities quite separately from other subgenres. In most school films, the educational setting becomes an index for youth issues, featuring a variety of youth culture styles and types, as best represented by The Breakfast Club in 1985. Five character roles played out in that film — the nerd, the jock, the rebel, the popular girl, and the delinquent — are the roles most commonly seen in all school films, and my study examines the impulse of smart students to transform, the impact of delinquents on school order, the threat of conformity to rebels, the sensitive depiction of ath- letes, and the effects of popularity on teen girls.The cycles in school films are thus best revealed through tracing the characters that embody those cycles, from the nerdly outcast of Lucas (1986) to the tormented clique queens of Heathers (1989) and the jock heroes of Varsity Blues (1999). These subgenres remained in place throughout the end of twentieth cen- tury American cinema, and with the ironic exception of the now-dormant sci- ence film, they still form the frame in which youth films are made and mar- keted in the early twenty-first century, even as a number of the particular styles BO within the subgenresfade or change. Looking back, after a boom in the early Generation '80s, the output of successful American youth films began to decline by the Multiplex late '80s, as the \"Brat Pack\" of popular teen stars in the mid-'80s began taking adult roles and Hollywood moved away from the limited market of teen sto- ries. Many little-seen youth films did continue to be made at this time, and while many were quite good, most were by small studios and thus had re- stricted releases. With the exception of a few notable films focusing on Afri- can American teens in criminal settings, this marginalizing effect continued until the mid-'90s, when Hollywood began to cultivate a refreshed interest in youth films, partially due to the recycling pattern of most film genres, but also in an effort to lure youth back to theaters and away from the proliferation of cable-TV channels and new teen-oriented Internet sites. By the mid-'90s,the latest expansion of youth movie production emerged, especially in the wake of highly successful and/or provocative youth films such as Clueless, Kids, Dangerous Minds (all 1995), William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, Scream, and Girls Town (all 1 996). The new Hollywood strategy worked: by 1997, the national teenager-demographic tracking organization Teen Re- search Unlimited announced that teens labeled \"going to the movies\"the most popular\"in\"activity,ahead of (in descending order) using the Internet, dating, partying, sports, and shopping. 10 In fact, just as they saved Hollywood profits in the early '80s, youth movies of the late '90s offered a much-needed boost to a previously sluggish film industry, with relatively low-budget productions such as Can't Hardly Wait, The Faculty (both 1 998), Never Been Kissed, She's All That, and Varsity Blues (all 1999) all yielding tidy revenues — not to mention the hugely budgeted and overwhelmingly successful Titanic (1 997),a film that owed much of its profit to a youth audience captivated by the film's teen ro- mance. Various media outlets began covering the escalating interest in teen culture, which was apparent not only at the multiplex but in television shows such as Party of Five, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, 7th Heaven, Moesha, and the rela- tively huge hit Dawson's Creek (developed by Scream screenwriter Kevin Williamson), and which thus had a synergistic effect in increasing the output of teen roles in the cinema. 11 The youth population at the end of the century was clearly witness to a new wave of films that catered to their interests and explored their images,and these films were and will continue to be undoubt- edly influenced by and built upon the evolution of cinematic youth repre- sentations in previous generations. The rich and compelling history of films about youth informs us of more than the changing social conditions and perceptions of young people; it gives us a special appreciation for how successive generations have endured the conflicts of claiming identity and seeking recognition for their actions. This introduction: endurance was seen most visibly in the post-World War II teen films as young The Cinematic people restively entered the Cold War era their parents created,and then again image ofYomh in the '60s counterculture films, and most recently at the turn of the millen- nium as youth face a future that will be far more fast-paced and removed from the traditions and mores of their parents' generation. This study exam- ines American youth films in the last two decades of the twentieth century to determine how recent generations of young people have been represented in American cinema and what that representation tells us about the various phenomena that constitute the contemporary coming-of-age process. Through this examination I demonstrate not only that youth films comprise a legitimate genre worthy of study on their own terms, but that they are im- bued with a unique cultural significance: they question our evolving identi- ties from youth to adulthood while simultaneously shaping and maintaining those identities. SOCIAL REPRESENTATION AND GENRE ANALYSIS This is a work of film criticism. I have viewed and analyzed hundreds of films that compose my primary texts of analysis, and my main analytical method uses genre analysis to study social representation. Social approaches to film studies seek an understanding of cinema based on group and individual rep- resentations in (and/or reactions to) films — for example, how films portray a given population or their conditions — under the tacit assumption that films are both aesthetic and cultural documents produced by an industry whose aim is to appeal to (often larger) populations who will find the films worth seeing. Genre analysis considers patterns, motifs, and trends across a spec- trum of films that share a commonality, usually subject matter and theme (such as science fiction, melodrama, Westerns), and further explores how the ele- ments of a genre are manifested and change over time. My study considers how American films about teenagers have utilized different techniques and stories to represent young people within a codified system that delineates certain subgenres and character types within the \"youth film\" genre. Unlike other genres that are based on subject matter, the youth genre is based on the ages of the films' characters, and thus the thematic concerns of its subgenres can be seen as more directly connected to specific notions of dif- ferent youth behaviors and styles. IS Pioneering cinematic image studies include Molly Haskell's examination Generation of women in film, From Reverence to Rape (1 974), Thomas Cripps's examina- Mukiplex tion of African Americans in film, Slow Fade to Black (1977), and Siegfried Kracauer's seminal investigation of German film and society, From Caligarito Hitler (1 957). 12 To this list we could also add many other studies, including those of Native Americans [The Only Good Indian, Ralph Friar and Natasha Friar, 1972), Jews {The Jewish Image in American Film, Lester Friedman, 1 987), and the dis- abled (Cinema of Isolation, Martin Norden, 1994). l3 The authors of these stud- ies employ various approaches to their investigations, all of which are built upon the belief that films are cultural artifacts revealing much about not only the people who are depicted in them but also those who make and view them. These approaches can be primarily interpretive, utilizing a subjective under- standing of the films and the population in question, or more quantitative, attempting an objective \"content analysis\" to reveal various features of the films. I study the images of youth in American cinema by combining both of these approaches. I feel that in any social study of cinema one cannot and should not rely solely upon quantitative and statistical information, and an \"objective\" study of a medium as personal and social as film would not be effective in such matters as attitude, nuance, and style. However, I also feel that relying solely upon inferential readings of films is equally problematic, for such a study can become so subjective as to be indifferent to other per- spectives. I therefore aim to understand the subtleties and possible interpre- tations of youth films while also exploring the social and industrial contexts of the films' productions; I try to identify and analyze the \"image\" of youth with as much information as possible about what inspired and manifested that image and how that image developed over time. I do not study the re- ception of youth images, and I leave such a study to those who can pursue thorough audience research. Rather, my study expands upon the work done by scholars whose analyses of the images of youth have provided a helpful foundation. Genre analysis has been developed more recently than social analysis methods. While many critics observed the social influence of movies on view- ers from the earliest days of cinema, serious genre examinations did not pro- ceed until after World War II. Paul Willemen (1983) describes the two func- tions that genre theory was then designed to fulfill: (1) \"to challenge and displace the dominant notions of cinema installed and defended on the ba- sis of the assumed excellence of the 'taste' of a few journalists and reviewers, appealing to the 'age-old canons and principles' of Art in general,\" and (2) \"in introduction: the wake of the realisation that any form of artistic production is a rule-bound The Cinematic activity firmly embedded in social history, [genre theory] set about discover- image ofYouth ing the structures which underpinned groups of films and gave them their social grounding.\" 14 Thus, as genre theories were staked out, many scholars argued alternately for political, aesthetic, social, and industrial methods for studying genres. Theoretical studies of genre appeared, such as Robin Wood's \"Ideology, Genre, Auteur\" (1 977), in which Wood claimed that genre films are \"different strategies for dealing with the same ideological tensions.\" 15 Rick Altman's ambitious \"A Semantic/Syntactic Approach to Film Genre\" (1984) proposed studying genre by combining the semantic view of genre study (\"definitions that depend on a list of common traits, attitudes, characters, shots, locations, sets, and the like\") with the syntactic (\". . .definitions that play up instead cer- tain constitutive relationships between undesignated and variable place- holders\"), an approach that he has since revised and expanded in his recent Film/Genre (1999). 15 Practical methods of studying genre were offered in Tho- mas Schatz's Hollywood Genres (1981) and Stuart Kaminsky's American Film Genres (1 985), while specific generic approaches were also hotly debated (e.g., Paul Schrader's take on film noir, Jim Kitses's study of the Western, Jane Feuer's and Rick Altman's books on Hollywood musicals). 17 Some writers insisted upon parameters for describing \"genre films,\" such as how one could claim that certain movies were indeed gangster films, or Westerns, or melodramas (Kaminsky called for a limited scope and definition to genre, in films with clearly defined constants). 18 However, an early critic of this concern, Andrew Tudor, in 1973 pointed to the \"empiricist dilemma\" of arbitrary definitions and post hoc descriptors that are often used to describe a genre, by which a genre is defined \"on the basis of analyzing a body of films that cannot possibly be said to be [a certain genre] until after the analysis.\" 19 Tudor sees two solutions to this dilemma:first, to \"classify films according to a priori criteria depending on the critical purpose,\"or second, more commonly and more preferably, to'lean on a common cultural consensus as to what con- stitutes [a certain genre] and then go on to analyze it in detail.\" 20 Still other writers remained grounded in the broader theories of genre, such as Steve Neale's contention in \"Questions of Genre\" (1990) that genres represent so- cial and industrial conditions indicative of alternating dominant forces, al- ID though using such a model demands an exhaustive and impractical study of Generation a myriad of discourses in order to be sound and is ultimately as interpretive Multiplex as other text-based approaches. 21 Genre criticism shares an important role with social criticism in revealing to scholars the complex tastes and trends of filmmakers and audiences. Schatz argues in Hollywood Genres that audiences \"write\"genres within limited con- texts, describing to the film industry what films should be made based on what films they go to see. Schatz thus claimed thaf'a genre represents a range of expression for filmmakers and a range of experience for viewers.\" 22 1 be- lieve this is a helpful way of considering genre, although the ranges of which Schatz speaks can be wide and difficult to define. In the case of the present study, I consider the image of the American youth population within certain ranges of experience that youth are afforded, such as school, relationships, and delinquency. These experiences are essentially what define the more pre- cise \"subgenres\" within the social genre of youth films. In terms of defining and analyzing the youth genre, both of Tudor's solu- tions to the empiricist dilemma can be employed: first, temporarily set aside cultural context in the definition of the genre by simply maintaining a defined and consistent limit on the genre (see \"youth picture\"described below). Then, in addressing the cultural context, be explicitly aware of the fallibility of gen- eralizing that remains an inherent danger in observing the characteristics of a genre and then extrapolating from those characteristics to make compari- sons to social conditions. Since my study argues primarily from the point at which images of youth are produced — the texts of the films — and not their reception within a historical reality of youth, nor their stylistic components (e.g., lighting techniques, editing patterns, use of sound), I can only offer in- terpretive arguments about the social milieu as well as about the industrial and narrative range of films themselves. While any study that deals with rep- resentation must necessarily consider the context of said representation, my study only applies recent historical and statistical information about youth as it is relevant to certain arguments. Conditions of education, employment, and lifestyle among young people are too complex to analyze within the scope of this study, although the representation of certain youth trends or practices in films against the historical or statistical \"reality\" of youth conditions is considered. One of the most conspicuous problems of genre analysis over the past generation has been the assumption by most scholars that a genre's charac- teristics and development can be discerned by studying only the most popu- lar and \"successful\" examples of a genre or else a random sample of its offer- ings. Obviously this approach presents a number of dilemmas: how the de- introduction: termination of \"importance\" is made for the sample selected, what is lost in The Cinematic the films not studied, and how claims about the genre may not apply to image ofYomh every film that can be argued to fit the genre's code. In the dissertation that was the source of this book, I insisted upon a generic methodology in which all of the available films within a genre, and its respective subgenres,are ad- dressed, since this is the only way to ensure complete knowledge of a genre. Nonetheless, a few problems with my approach arose as I wrote the disserta- tion and revised it into the current volume: many films that may fit within the youth genre are not available for viewing; the restrictions of space do not al- low for lengthy commentary on the many films in question; some films that are only partially germane to issues of youth representation may not contrib- ute to an examination of youth subgenres as a whole. The first problem cannot be avoided — there are simply many films that are so obscure as to be inaccessible, and a scholar is left with the faulty op- tion of making comments on a few films based on plot descriptions; thus, I only offer analyses of the relevant films I have been able to carefully view.The second problem is unfortunate, since it demands that some valuation be placed on films and styles that do warrant more extensive commentary, while others are given shorter coverage or omitted altogether. This and the third problem are indicative of the inevitably judgmental nature of generic definition: I must determine which films are most representative and which address youth issues \"significantly,\" as well as how they operate within the various youth subgenres. I argue that most youth films fall into one of five subgenres, but not all portray youth in such a way that lends deeper insight to the patterns and operations of the subgenres. In selecting the films that are the most germane to my argument and in focusing on the subgeneric categories that are most revealing of youth film trends, I have had to elimi- nate a number of wonderful films and important issues for the sheer sake of concentration and demonstration. I thus apologize at the start for the absence of numerous teen classics that you may otherwise find endearing, and which I can almost certainly promise have found or will find thorough coverage in other sources. The difficulty of this type of genre approach has been examined by Janet Staiger (1997) in her analysis of the \"purity hypothesis\" in genre study, for she claims thaf'Hollywood films have never been 'pure' — that is, easily arranged into categories. All that has been pure has been sincere attempts to find or- MM der among variety.\" 23 She does, however, go on to say that these sincere at- Gemration tempts are in the service of understanding larger structural and representa- Mukiplex tional patterns in film history, while questioning why scholars such as Tudor can point out the inconsistencies of genre study and then essentially pass over them in excessively precise efforts to study genre films. Thus, to this day an agreement within the field on how to conduct genre studies has yet to be reached, as is evident by the number of current texts that continue to debate the issue, although I proceed through a comprehensive analysis that expands upon the most complex and visible examples of the youth genre's output. 24 That films about youth actually constitute a genre has only recently been identified in film studies. After the pioneering work of David Considine and a few other authors in the 1980s, two genre catalogs offered codifications for the youth genre. In his massive compendium Films by Genre: 775 Categories, Styles, Trends, and Movements Defined, with a Filmography for Each ( 1 993), Daniel Lopez identifies the'Teen Movie/'which has also been called the\"'Juve' Movie,\" \"Teenage Movie,\" \"Teenpic,\" and \"Youth Picture,\" although he places undue emphasis on the exploitative nature of many films since the 1 950s that have featured teenagers. 25 He then divides the Teen Movie into subgenres, while cross-listing other relevant genres such as the \"Exploitation Film,\" the \"Juve- nile Delinquency Film,\"the\"Motorcycle Movie,\"the\"Rock Film,\"and the\"Youth Film.\" Of Teen Movie subgenres, Lopez offers the division of \"Beach Films,\" \"High School Films,\"\"Teen-Violence Films,\" and \"Teen Comedies\" — which he distinguishes from \"Teen Sex Comedies.\" 25 His further distinction ofthe\"Youth Film\"appears to be a matter of histori- cally specific semantics, since he only cites examples from 1 967 to 1 972 and claims that these films \"highlighted the concerns of young people querying the Establishment, society and its values,\" as if films before or since this time frame had failed to do so as well. 27 Such a dubious category exposes the diffi- culty of finding accurate descriptors for generic styles and movements, since Lopez would have done better to label the Vietnam-era films to which he was referring by theirthematic concerns, calling them perhaps\"Anti-Establishment Films,\"or placing them in a temporal subgenre such as the\"Vietnam-Era Youth Film.\" Lopez's attempt to define and divide films about youth is still signifi- cant, for he locates Teen Movies as a genre unto itself, and sees the necessity of making subgeneric distinctions. In 1995 the Library of Congress commissioned its Motion Picture/Broad- casting/Recorded Sound Division to study the cataloging of films by types, and by 1997 the group produced The Moving Image Genre-Form Guide, which relies on the work of archival sources (such as the Film Literature Index and The American Film Institute Catalog of Feature Films) to construct a descriptive introduction: structure for the various genres and forms of film. 28 This guide locates one The Cinematic comprehensive genre it labels \"Youth,\" which comprises \"fictional work por- image ofYomh traying aspects of the trajectory through adolescence, including high school years, peer pressure, first love, beach parties, and initial attempts at adulthood, along with strains in the relationship with family.\" 29 The emphasis in these films is on teenage characters, and the guide thus subsumes the distinction of \"Teen\" films within this category, moving films about characters aged 12 and younger to \"Children,\" and films set in a collegiate environment to\"Col- lege.\"These are essentially the same distinctions that I make (although I do include 1 2-year-old characters) in delimiting the genre that is the youth film. As Janet Staiger and other authors have continued to argue, many films do not easily conform to manufactured categories: some films may simply not fit into a clear (sub)generic classification, or may cross over so many themes and styles as to defy any single (sub)generic location. This is a dilemma of which I am keenly aware, and I attempt to address it by always foregrounding the existence of youth cinema as a genre itself, which has a relatively reliable denotative frame — that is, films in which youth appear.Then within that frame, I allow for much categorical interplay and cross-generic influence. Yet because not even aH\"films in which youth appear\" can properly be identified as youth cinema (usually because the young characters are secondary to adult leads), the larger generic frame under which I work is still sensitively constructed. This is a dilemma that I do not feel disrupts the process of examining how youth have been represented in cinema because so many youth images are still being studied;yetfrom a methodological standpoint, it does bear remind- ing, if only to argue that describing a truly reliable, consistent, internally and externally integrated model of genre study by social types may be an impos- sible goal. I believe that this book employs the paradigm that is best suited to the study of cinematic social representation through generic analysis, how- ever incomplete and arguable it may remain. What delimits youth in this context? For the purposes of my study, I con- sider the youth population to be between the ages of 12 and 20. This repre- sents a range of years that includes the actual teen years as well as the tradi- tionally recognized entrance into adolescence (or at least in the United States, the beginning of middle school, or junior high school), as well as late adoles- cence and entry into the post-high school world. (This is the same age range that David Considine analyzed in his work on adolescents in film, beginning HI with his dissertation and culminating in his book The Cinema of Adolescence. Generation It is also the same age range used by MarkThomas McGee and R. J. Robertson Multiplex in their study of juvenile delinquency in movies, TheJ.D. Films.) However, I do not analyze films that are about characters in college (who tend to be be- tween 18 and 24 years old) except for the rare cases where clearly defined adolescents attend college in the story.This is not to say that college-age char- acters are not youthful, but since the college genre has itself already been extensively covered in other studies, and further, because the ages of college characters are often vague and are usually implied as the\"early 20s,\"and most of all, because the majority of college films do not concern the same issues about youth as do teen and high school films, analyzing these films would detract from the primary focus of my study on teen representation. 30 There- fore, the chapters on horror, science, delinquency, and love and sex consider films about characters aged 1 2 to 20, while the chapter on school covers char- acters in junior high or high school (generally 1 2 to 18 years old). Using this subgeneric format allows for a clear demonstration of the diverse and yet con- fined images of youth that Hollywood produces. I further delimit my study by concentrating on feature-length films, al- though I do consider many straight-to-video movies that achieved recogni- tion outside of theatrical release. I do not examine films that,despite the pres- ence of young performers or their appeal to young audiences, are not about the youth experience. As Thomas Doherty and other critics have argued, Hol- lywood \"juvenilized\" its films after World War II to such an extent that virtually all movies can be said to appeal to youth. 31 Thus, given the comprehensive reach of what can be labeled \"youth\" films, I am not only concentrating on those films that are relevant to the dominant subgenres of youth cinema since 1 980, but I am omitting films that only tangentially or incidentally depict youth. A filmography of all youth films from 1980 to 2001 (many of which are ex- cluded from the present study) is included as Appendix A; this list is provided in the hope that a complete analysis of all youth films may someday be con- ducted. Assembling the filmography for this study proved to be an arduous task. Many of the so-called indexes of genres are incomplete or,as is the case with many generic categories, based on ambiguous or subjective judgments of what constitutes relevant films in the \"youth\" genre. I conducted numerous cross-referenced searches, generating an initial list of roughly 1,500 films, which I then began to narrow by consulting plot descriptions. This was by far the most reliable and complete method for compiling the filmography, which rounded out at just over 1 ,000 films, of which I was able to view and analyze introduction: about 420 examples. I believe this is the most complete filmography of youth The Cinematic films from 1 980 to 2001 that can be assembled. image offouth I have read what I believe to be all of the relevant literature on youth films since 1 980, as well as numerous published reviews on each film in the study. While I integrate these writings into my analyses, I do not believe that it is necessary or appropriate to focus on any specific authors' theoretical argu- ments about youth films, youth culture, or film reception in general. My ap- proach is meant to be pluralistic and inclusive,considering as many pertinent perspectives about these films as possible. For instance, many commercial developments at the end of the twentieth century — multiplex theaters, the availability of films on video, trends in youth fashion — not only have affected the output of youth films but also have changed the representations of youth within films. I thus also consider how certain financial conditions of the film- making practice have factored into the social and generic aspects of youth images in cinema. A note on terminology: I use the label \"youth films\" to refer to the entire universe of films made about young people. While I often label this popula- tion as \"young adults,\" I will occasionally divide \"teens\" from \"20-somethings\" when such a distinction is demanded. \"Adolescence\" is an ambiguous term that can be applied to youth before the age of 1 2 and after 20, so I reserve use of the term for when I specifically discuss the social or biological process of entering adulthood and leaving childhood. THE STUDY OF YOUTH, IN AND OUT OF MOVIES A study of cinema and youth offers an interesting historical parallel: motion pictures were invented in the 1890s and \"youth\" as an area of academic research emerged less than 20 years later in 1904, when social psychologist G.Stanley Hall wrote his pathbreaking two-volume tome Adolescence: Its Psy- chology, and Its Relations to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Re- ligion, and Education, which may be credited as the beginning of youth stud- ies. 32 That the proliferation of cinema and the founding of youth studies coincide within the same historical generation may not be indicative of a cause-and-effect relationship; however, the relationship between cinema and youth is significant. The twentieth century produced a series of \"moral pan- E9 ics\" around young people and social behavior, and the cinema — both as a Generation gathering place and as a site of influence — has been a perennial source of Multiplex those panics. 33 Of course children and teenagers existed before the twentieth century began, but the social perception of the preadult population was consider- ably different before the early 1900s, and certainly before the Industrial Revo- lution. Many girls and boys left school at preteen ages in the nineteenth cen- tury and started families soon thereafter, often entering the labor force in their early teen years or younger. As the modern era took hold, certain researchers like Hall (and later Havighurst, Piaget, Winnicott, Erikson, and Anna Freud) be- gan recognizing a distinct age of specialized development between child- hood and adulthood that had been initially described through characteris- tics of sexual development and was then later examined as a more complex sociopsychological manifestation of cultural and internal conflict. 34 This age of development was adolescence, and its study by researchers (including Keniston, who even divided adolescence from youth) and its acceptance by society during the progressing twentieth century resulted in a new notion of youth, if only to distinguish a crucial transitional period during the teen years between childhood and adulthood. 35 Until the 1960s the study of youth remained largely a discipline within the behavioral sciences as researchers studied the changing attitudes and \"pa- thologies\" of youth during the various cycles of twentieth-century life. Then in the '60s, certain global political events brought about a visible change in the activities of young people, not the least of which were the escalating war in Southeast Asia and the student revolts in France in 1 968. During this same decade Philippe Aries wrote the next paradigmatic study of youth, shifting attention away from behavior and toward history in Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life (1 962). 35 Throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the new research on youth history was taken up by the growing field of cultural studies, which eagerly consid- ered how the youth uprisings of that era could be representative of previ- ously repressed or diffused class, gender, and race conflicts. First appeared the work of James Coleman in his 1961 book, The Adolescent Society: The So- cial Life of the Teenager and Its Impact on Education, after which British schol- ars in the 1970s,among them Stuart Hall, Angela McRobbie,and DickHebdige, studied patterns of resistance and revolt within what was now called \"youth culture.\" 37 By the 1980s, as the Reagan/Thatcher era brought about a series of new moral panics based on the vision of the New Right, the trend in youth research shifted back toward studies of youth \"pathologies\" (e.g., teen preg- nancy, unemployment, crime) within a cultural studies method. 38 One of the introduction: first such studies was Hooligan: A History of Respectable Fears (1 983), in which The Cinematic Geoffrey Pearson claimed that essentially the same moral accusations about image ofYomh youth had been recycled for the past 150 years. One of the more notable later studies in this vein was The Road to Romance and Ruin: Teen Films and Youth Culture (1992), in which Jon Lewis relied much upon the observations and opinions of Hebdige and Hall as he studied various teen \"vices\" in recent cin- ema. 39 The influence of British cultural studies remains evident in more re- cent youth studies, such as Teenagers: An American History (1996), by Grace Palladino, which studies the emergence of the American teenage population in terms of its institutional identification through the rise of high schools in the early twentieth century, and its economic identification through the greater consumptive capacities that teenagers developed in the years after World War II. 40 Regardless of how youth studies have focused on deviance and development (psychology) and/or resistance and economics (politics), one aspect of youth studies has been undoubtedly clear since the 1 980s:youth culture is not homogeneous. The 1980s became a time of distinct change in youth studies as the trajec- tories of sociology, history, and cultural studies merged over concerns about refreshed conservative attitudes that were largely vilifying youth. 41 These con- cerns were legitimate given conditions of the time;however,these conditions were not necessarily being visibly addressed in the American cinema at this time. Most Hollywood films about youth in the 1980s relied upon formulas that exploited youth issues, especially sexual development, while gradually revealing an increasing tension and confusion about the role of contempo- rary youth. By the early '90s, in the wake of the Reagan and Thatcher years and the patriotic swell of the Persian Gulf War, teens in American films had been entirely reconfigured, if not often extinguished, as increasing emphasis fell on portraits of the post-teen \"20-something\" generation in movies after Slacker in 1991 (examples include Singles in 1992 and Reality Bites in 1994). Popular studies of youth thus shifted their attention: in July 1 990, Time maga- zine published an extensive and influential article entitled \"Proceeding with Caution,\" which debuted the skeptical \"20-something generation\"; over the next few years more magazines followed suit (including dueling cover sto- ries \\n Atlantic Monthly and The New Republic at the end of 1992) with studies of young adults now labeled \"Generation X\"after Douglas Coupland's epony- mous 1 991 novel. 42 \"Youth\" by the mid-'90s thus covered a wider age range E9 than ever before, spanning the first year of postelementary education (the Generation age of 1 2) to the first few years after college (or, considering that the majority Multiplex of young people do not complete college, at least the mid-20s). 43 This perception had already been supported in Susan Littwin's The Post- poned Generation: Why America's Grown-Up Kids Are Growing Up Later (1 986), in which she argued that American adolescents now require over 10 years after the onset of puberty (usually the early teens) to become adults. 44 Fur- ther evidence of the widening age range and the concentration on recent information about youth came from more demographic studies like Market- ing to Generation X by Karen Ritchie (1995) and Welcome to the Jungle:The Why Behind \"Generation X\" by Geoffrey T. Holtz (1 995). 45 These studies argue that \"youth\" has been reconfigured as a specialized and crucial age group for American commercial marketing, and they show how certain youth atti- tudes — notably cynicism and narcissism — have been amplified and exploited by advertisers, businesses, and even politicians. (Janet Weeks has suggested that part of the reason for the decline in youth films from the late '80s to mid- '90s was that Generation X youth were'less enamored of cinema\" than previ- ous and current youth, although considering that many Gen Xers were teens in the early to mid-'80s when American youth films were thriving, such a gen- eralized audience claim is likely specious. 46 ) Most recently, a psychosociological interest in studying youth conditions has emerged following Mary Pipher's very successful Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls (1 994), which chronicles the tales of a wide range of troubled teenage girls facing negative body images, difficult familial conditions, and confusing romantic and social experiences. 47 The shift in youth studies and the general perception of youth over the past generation thus makes for intriguing research; but studying how the im- age of youth has changed,and further how it has diversified into a heteroge- neity of styles, attitudes, and ages, offers insight into the significant and often contradictory notions of who young people are. The cinema, with its limited range of products with unlimited ranges of meaning, is a system of represen- tation that provides a useful index of issues about various conditions; and in the case of this book, the conditions studied are those of youth. In terms of general studies about youth in cinema,the most important and complete work to date is Considine's The Cinema of Adolescence. 43 Considine employs a method that most other studies omit or minimize: he provides nar- rative descriptions of virtually all the films he discusses within the context of a thematic examination of the history of a population he calls \"screenagers.\" His overall argument is that American youth films over the course of the cen- introduction: tury have lacked verisimilitude since \"the American film industry has been The Cinematic spectacularly unsuccessful in realistically depicting adolescence,\"and thus the image ofYomh image of youth in films has been distorted. 49 Considine proceeds chronologi- cally (up to the early 1 980s) through chapters divided into sections on family, school, delinquency, and sexuality, and thereby lays out a structure that other critics and I have followed. (I do not locate \"family\" as an individual subgenre of the youth film after 1980: few recent youth films actually concentrate on family issues — indeed, much of Considine's examination of family is from pre- 1970 films — or the family issues are contained within dramatizations more relevant to other subgeneric qualities.) Considine strikes the best balance between historical and social analysis of any study I have found (with emphasis on the sociological), and his study demonstrates quite well the ways in which Hollywood had portrayed youth until the early '80s, predominantly in negative images. I build from Considine's thematic model and narrative approach in The Cinema of Adolescence, updat- ing his study with a deeper consideration of how youth themes have become subgenres and how individual movies themselves became the paradigms for those subgenres. A less sympathetic study is The Road to Romance and Ruin by Jon Lewis. 50 As I have argued in \"The Teen Film and Its Methods of Study,\" Lewis preserves a thematic approach similar to Considine's (yet he never cites him), with a per- spective that is often pessimistic and occasionally condescending. 51 He pro- ceeds through six chapters, each of which addresses a different teen vice: anomie, delinquency, sex, consumption, rebellion, and regression. Lewis uses these issues to support his ultimate thesis thaf'despite stylistic, tonal, indus- trial, and by now even generational differences within the genre, teen films all seem to focus on a single social concern:the breakdown of traditional forms of authority.\" 52 Lewis works within a conspicuously limited range of films to demonstrate this argument, and ultimately the light he sheds on teen films and youth culture is as negative and misinformed as the selective films he examines. I agree with Lewis that genre \"begins with the text, not with industry in- tent or with target audiences,\" but Lewis often gives the teen texts he discusses scant coverage. 53 He ultimately does appear more concerned with teen films' audiences, moving away from film analyses to incorporate ideas MUM on youth movements (mods, rockers, punks), music, and to a lesser extent, Generation sociopsychological commentary. This could have resulted in a comprehen- Mukiplex sive study that would have cast new light on the conditions of contemporary youth culture, yet so much of what Lewis says about young people is recycled from notions that are two or three generations past. When he concludes/'For this [current] generation of teenagers, the present is dominated by images and narratives of their parents' youth, \"his overall argument is revealed as ex- aggerated and lacking in serious study of recent teen films, which are occu- pied much more by a nostalgia for the present — the instant recycling of, and ironic longing for, contemporary phenomena — than by scenes of an extinct parental history. 54 More focused overviews of youth films worth noting include Armond White's article \"Kidpix\" from 1985; Kathy Merlock Jackson's study of preteens in Images of Children in American Film: A Sociocultural Analysis (1 986);Thomas Leitch's \"The World According toTeenpix\"(1992);\"Teenage Films,\" a chapter in Randall Clark's At a Theater or Drive-in Near You: The History, Culture, and Poli- tics of the American Exploitation Film (1995); Wheeler Winston Dixon's essay '\"Fighting and Violence and Everything, That's Always Cool':Teen Films in the 1990s\" (2000); and Steve Neale's coverage of \"Teenpics\" in Genre and Hollywood (2001 ). 55 Murray Pomerance has coedited a collection of recent articles on youth in film and television, Pictures of a Generation on Hold: Selected Papers (1996), from a conference on the same topic; Pomerance is also the coeditor with Frances Gateward of a study of girls in popular media, Sugar, Spice, and Everything Nice (2002). 55 As of this writing, the newest comprehensive analysis of teens in films can be found in Jonathan Bernstein's popular book Pretty in PinkThe Golden Age of Teenage Movies (1997), which is an often refreshing although generally uninsightful examination of '80s teen films, since Bernstein only briefly men- tions the many significant social,political,and economic conditions of the time, a shortcoming that is more glaring when he then attempts to study the rep- resentations of youth in films. 57 What becomes quickly evident, as Bernstein admits, is that he has no intention of examining an \"exhaustive collection\" of these films, and even though he does address about 120 teen films (more than any book other than Considine's and the present study), his review pro- cess is rather skewed to easily fit his generalizing remarks about the hedo- nism and angst portrayed in the films he describes. This yields sentimental reflections that can be amusing, while Bernstein's arguments remain self- fulfilling and lacking in depth. In their 1980 reference catalog The Screen Image of Youth: Movies about Children and Adolescents, Ruth Goldstein and Edith Zornow describe a 1972 introduction: article by New York Times film critic Vincent Canby entitled \"Stop Kidding The Cinematic Around,\" in which he portrayed a 10-year-old boy who was so angry about image ofYomh the\"lies\"that films told about children that he was going to write a corrective book/The Image of the Child in Film.\" 58 Neither Canby nor the mythical boy ever produced such a book, although the critic did indeed recognize a sig- nificant need for research, revision, and appreciation for the ways in which young people are represented in cinema. Most of the authors above, know- ingly or not, have participated in fulfilling that need articulated by Canby 30 years ago, and I attempt to augment that tradition by examining young adult films in this book. YOUTH IN SCHOOL ..... You see us as you want to see us, in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. — BRIAN TO His principal IN The Breakfast Club I use my great IQ to decide what color lip gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew — veronica IN Heathers I'm fucking tired of being wrong before I open my mouth. LESTER TO A COP in Light It Up The school film is perhaps the most easily definable subgenre of youth films since its main plot actions focus on the setting of high school or junior high school campuses. The vast majority of school films present the educational building as a symbolic site of social evolution, with young people learning from and rebelling against their elders (and each other) in the ongoing cycle of generational adjustment and conflict. In certain instances, school films have actually considered how the design and structure of the educational facili- ties of a school impact upon the students and teachers, but most often the school itself is an indifferent location wherein various gender, race, class, and above all, popularity issues are contested among students. School is also a site of individual growth through not only educational achievements but also the earning of social acceptance. Young people learn very early that certain traits — good looks, money (in the form of nice clothes or cool toys), intelligence, athletic skills, toughness — yield special attention from their elders and their peers. The struggle for gaining attention in any school system is a complex contest for recognition of genetic privilege and W3M negotiation of social status, for young people without naturally attractive traits Youth in must learn to cultivate whatever characteristics will most successfully earn School them acceptance, unless they can deny the process of acceptance and adopt an alternate means of gaining self-identity and esteem. Yet by the teen years, with the onset of puberty and adolescent angst over conforming to the adult world, all young people are faced with even larger confrontations about ac- ceptance, and their physical placement in the school environment becomes a visible reminder of their plight. School may be a land of opportunity to dem- onstrate one's worth or a locus of oppression where one's attempts to gain worth are met with resistance or ridicule. The majority of American teens' socialization takes place at or around school. (Most school districts offer junior high school, or middle school, to stu- dents between the ages of 12 and 14, and high school to students age 15 through 18.) Since the school is thus a prime location for a wide range of youth development, movie studios have capitalized on the variety of applications to which the school setting can be utilized generically; all of the other subgenres in this study contain some films in which schools are used as vari- ous narrative devices. What makes the school film a specific subgenre is its focus on the actual socialization process at the school, as opposed to other youth issues which are less integral to the school setting, such as crime, sex, terror, or family (although these issues are often developed in films around school settings).This chapter examines the American school film as a subgenre dependent upon the social recognition of junior high and high school as con- tained milieux for the educational development and cultural disciplining of youth, where youth are most often clearly divided into distinct types with cer- tain levels of achievement and acceptance according to that development and disciplining. In environments of such change and containment, conflicts are inevitable; since such containment is rendered upon a population teem- ing with physical energy, sexual curiosity, and psychological tension, the dra- matic potential of those conflicts, and their resolutions, seems limitless. TRENDS IN THE SUBGENRE The school film as a subgenre has moved through discernible waves of popu- larity. From the debut of postwar high school discontent in such teen trouble films as City Across the River (1 949) to the more popular image of tense school conditions in the two 1955 classics, Rebel Without a Cause and Blackboard E9 Jungle, both major studios and smaller independents tapped into (or ex- Gemration ploited) the burgeoning cultural anxiety about reckless youth. With the rapid Multiplex proliferation of multiple teen subgenres, the school film became only one av- enue for representing teens, and as tensions of the 1 960s shifted to college campuses, fewer high school films were made. While the youth film market boomed in the 1980s after the tamer 1970s, the school film did not maintain any consistent popularity of its own. The film that perhaps presaged the '80s high school cycle (while openly borrowing from the '50s crime dramas) was Over the Edge in 1979. The film features a young Matt Dillon as a James Dean-style rebel who galvanizes a small group of suburban tough kids to fight for a certain liberation from their alcoholic parents and misguided school system. In one of the most extreme teen fantasies ever filmed (although the film's premise was based on a true story), the students ultimately lock their parents and teachers in the local high school and set their cars on fire.The film may now be viewed as an examina- tion of social anxieties about delinquency and discipline in the late '70s, al- though, according to Jonathan Bernstein, the film was in fact kept from pub- lic release for a few years because the studio feared copycat violence. 1 The next major school film of the era took a decidedly different approach. Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) arrived just as the new trend in teen sex films was developing (notable examples include Foxes and Little Darlings in 1980 and Porky's and Endlesslove in 1981), and while the film was at once a lighthearted portrait of suburban youth making their way through the cur- ricular and extracurricular maze of high school life, it also gave viewers a full array of sexual melodramas, complete with titillating nudity and sex talk. Many other school films of the early '80s also incorporated the same attitudes and themes about young sex, although the novelty quickly wore off as popular films such as Teachers (1984) and The Breakfast Club (1985) offered more fo- cused interrogations of schools and their effects on students. The later '80s marked a decline in the overall number of successful school films (although, as is the case with some other youth film subgenres, the num- ber of school films in total increased, even if many of these were barely seen by audiences). After the previous movement from sexual themes to charac- ter dramas based on school and family problems, the school films of the late '80s covered a range from such tasteful coming-of-age comedies as Lucas (1 986) to more tasteless attempts to agitate teen tensions, as in The Principal (1987) and Johnny Be Good (1 988). With the exception of Stand and Delivers 1988, which concentrated on the role of an inspirational math teacher, there were no school films between the seminal Breakfast Club in 1 985 and Heath- WMM ers in 1989 that matched their popularity. 2 Such a cycle would soon repeat Youth in itself, for after the release of a few more successful school films in 1989 and School 1 990 (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Dead Poets Society, Lean on Me, Pump Up the Volume),xhe school film again declined in recognition through the early '90s. As if the genre were on a prescribed cycle, it returned in 1995 with An- gus, Clueless, Dangerous Minds, and Powder, and then again in the late '90s with Can't Hardly Wait, The Faculty, and Rushmore (1 998), Election, She's All That, W Things I Hate About You, and Varsity Blues (1999). The reasons for the alternating wavelength of popularity in the contem- porary school drama may be deceptively easy to explain. As with all genres, new styles and approaches to the same subject matter appeal to audiences for only a short time. The sexual and narcotic hijinks of the early-'80s films may have been an initial reaction to the Reagan era's puritan ethic for youth (movies at least were a site where teens didn't have to \"Just Say No\"), but de- clining box-office returns for the ongoing imitations of Fast Times (e.g., Pri- vate School and Losin'lt in 1 983, and The Wild Life and Joy of Sex in 1 984) indi- cated that interest in rowdy teen sex stories was waning. Another certain factor was the emergence of Hollywood's first coherent teen screen machine in decades, the so-called Brat Pack. From 1984 to 1986, photogenic young performers such as Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Andrew McCarthy, Judd Nelson, Rob Lowe, Ally Sheedy, and Emilio Estevez found themselves in a series of successful teen dramas. Their appearance in the teen market was built upon wistful, tormented, and ultimately clean im- ages of mid-'80s youth who proffered occasionally sincere questions about sex and drugs as they engaged less in these practices (on-screen, at least) than their previous counterparts. The success of this troupe was nonetheless short lived, and by the late '80s the performers had either gravitated toward adult roles or faded into obscurity. As has been the case with child and teen per- formers throughout the century, the aging process swiftly carries young ac- tors out of their original personae,and few are welcomed into more assertive adult roles. Trends in American schooling and social fads are further factors in the os- cillating popularity of school films. Each high school \"generation\" itself lasts for only three or four years, and these short successive generations do not want to be associated with the outmoded styles and fashions of the groups that preceded them, lest they be perceived as unoriginal and conformist.Thus, the appeals of certain types of music, styles of dress, manners of speech, and KIM even social attitudes are bound to be limited to relatively short lifespans Generation among youth, especially those in school who are constantly monitoring the Multiplex changing cultural landscape. The same phenomenon applies to films about school: with the exception of the rarely successful period film {e.g., Dead Po- ets Society in 1989), young viewers pay to see their current conditions cel- ebrated and exaggerated on the screen, but the conditions of 1999 cannot look like those of 1 995 (or perhaps even 1 998). This brings up a final point that may explain the dips in school movie pro- duction and/or success. Given the critical acuity of youth audiences, studios must understand the hit-or-miss dilemma of marketing films about youth to a young audience. Whereas adult films that appeal to youth may at least draw a wide audience, contemporary teen dramas have a more limited appearand a financial investment in a school picture (unless it has the adult crossover potential of Stand and Deliver, Lean on Me, or Dead Poets Society, each of which featured a major adult star) is a considerable gamble for a studio. Even the late-'90s resurgence in school films was brought on by relatively low-budget hits like Clueless, She's All That, Election, and Varsity Blues. During the boom in African American youth films in the early '90s, major studios avoided tradi- tional high school movies while television took up the school setting in popu- lar shows like Beverly Hills 90210, Saved by the Bell, Blossom, and the nostalgic Wonder Years. Hollywood has more recently developed a synergy between film and television in school depictions, using popular shows and their stars to promote films, such as Buffythe Vampire Slayer's high school demon chaser Sarah Michelle Gellar starring in I Know What You Did Last Summer and Cruel Intentions. SCHOOLKIDS There has been little effort by filmmakers to experiment with or change the types of characters featured in school films, even as the conditions of the school environments and the context of youth images have inevitably con- tinued to evolve. Most school films before the 1 980s focused on one type of school character and his or her relation to others, such as the misunderstood rebel played by James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause, the sexually curious but nonetheless repressed virgins played by popular schoolgirl Natalie Wood and jock Warren Beatty in Splendor in the Grass (1961), or the outcast nerd played by Sissy Spacek in Carrie (1976). But by the 1980s, many school films began showcasing an ensemble of school characters, as was shown in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, based on Cameron Crowe's \"expose\" investigation of real 111 school life, and reaching an apex with the\"experiment\"of (stereo)typecasting Youth in in The Breakfast Club. School Both FastTimes and Breakfast Club feature the five basic characters of school films that permeate the subgenre: clean-cut and essentially repressed (and thus occasionally aggressive) nerds;delinquent boys and girls\"from the wrong side of the tracks\" who either pay for their crimes or learn to reform; psycho- logically distraught rebels who may dabble in crime but are usually looking for a more acceptable outlet for their malaise; \"popular\" types whom every- The Breakfast Club (198^) presents the five types of characters who populate schools in American youth films, and this publicity still demonstrates some of their traits. Delinquent John (Judd Nelson) lurks behind shades and working-class garb, rebel Alison (Ally Sheedy) is coiled up and nonconforming in the shadows, athlete Andy (Emilio Estevez) is tensely wrapped in his wrestling jacket, popular Claire (Molly Ringwald) exudes an elite nonchalance, and nerd Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) is drably trying to blend in on the edge. E9 one at school knows and who support their status through fashion, appear- Gemration ance,and attitude;and jocks, usually shown as physically focused and prouder Multiplex than their counterparts,dedicated to a given sport yet surprisingly emotional as well. These stereotypes can embody different ages, races, classes, and gen- ders, but as my study shows, there are indeed not only codifications for the behaviors of each type but also certain patterns that reveal narrative modes of acceptance within each type. The ways in which school characters are portrayed may offer an index of identifiers and signifiers for the young view- ers who are presumably meant to relate to one or more of these types, and thus the films can be seen to \"teach\" the proper mannerisms of each school persona. This chapter analyzes the five basic character types in school films through an evaluation of their primary conflicts: the ways nerds seek to transform, the means delinquents use to express anger, the actions rebels take to resist con- formity, the efforts popular girls make for notoriety, and the signals athletes use to show their sensitivity. TRANSFORMING THE NERD The roles of intellectually ambitious school characters in youth films since 1 980 — who are portrayed as socially inept and uncouth — indicate that nerds lack the respect of their teen counterparts, but most films featuring nerds (a.k.a. dweebs, geeks, dorks, brains, and whizzes) reveal that they, like most school characters, are simply struggling to be understood and accepted in the face of social oppression. The irony of nerds' oppression is that they excel at the very practice that school is designed to promote — learning — but such a bla- tant conformity to institutional expectations gives nerd characters a reputa- tion for being unoriginal and excessively vulnerable. Further, their capacity to excel is viewed with jealousy by other students, who occasionally exploit nerds' skills (many nerds in school films are used to help struggling students over- come academic obstacles). Nerds most often attain their liberation through some abandonment of academics — joining a sports team, falling in love, com- mitting a crime — but they always reaffirm the value of learning as a way"
