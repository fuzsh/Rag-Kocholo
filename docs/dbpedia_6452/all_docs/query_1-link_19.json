        "text": "A family joins the music of the Texas desert night in this tale of tradition and memory from Pura Belpré Honor author Laekan Zea Kemp.\n\nIt starts with a soft tapping,\n\nUncle Eduardo drumming his\n\nhands against his dusty jeans.\n\nAs the blush of sunset gives way to night in the desert, coyotes, cicadas, and barn owls emerge, each calling out to the moon. Watching from their porch, the family joins the song. One by one, each relative offers their drums, flute, maracas, strings, and voices.\n\nThey sing with the insects, birds, snakes and toads; and they sing with their ancestors, an audience glittering in the stars overhead. With each strum of passed-down instruments, memories renew, and those gone are alive and near again.\n\nDesert Song hums and chimes with all the music a front porch and the desert beyond can hold. Pura Belpré Honor author Laekan Zea Kemp’s masterfully stirring text dances through Beatriz Gutierrez Hernandez’s enchanting and dynamic artwork. Readers will be left with the soothing sense that when creativity flourishes, the past is never out of reach, and the bonds that matter never break.\n\nSimultaneously published in Spanish as Canción del desierto.\n\nAn unhurried fishing trip, with blueberry scones in tow, introduces a new bear duo sure to charm fans of Little Bear and Frog and Toad.\n\nOne day Big Bear says to Little Bear,\n\nI’m just in the mood for fishing.\n\nMe, too, says Little Bear. Just in the mood.\n\nWith this decided, Big Bear and Little Bear are off… almost. First they need the right attire, poles in a red wagon, a basket of freshly-baked scones, and a good book to read. It’s unclear how much real fishing will get done today, but one thing’s for sure: there will be a cozy nap in the hammock at the end.\n\nAdults who grew up with classic stories about friendship and caring will feel an immediate resonance in the low-stakes adventures of these two adorable bears. Amy Hest’s wry text sets a pitch-perfect mood, and Caldecott Medalist Erin Stead brings fine art to each bucolic illustration. Big Bear and Little Bear Go Fishing is a treat for all ages and is sure to find a treasured place on shelves for years to come.\n\nA Junior Library Guild Gold Standard Selection\n\nFrom the creators of A Bear, a Bee, and a Honey Tree comes another fun-to-read romp featuring lovable, hungry Bear. This time, he’s after a determined fish, who has an altogether different plan!\n\nReaders of the beloved A Bear, a Bee, and a Honey Tree met a bear who longed for honey, but never got to eat any. In this boisterous follow-up, will Bear’s luck change? He’s spotted a fish! And his wish? To gobble up this delicious fish dish, of course! Sadly for Bear, this is no ordinary fish—he’s a homesick fellow determined to get back upstream where he belongs. Once again, Daniel Bernstrom and Brandon James Scott show off their deep understanding of what makes kids laugh. The longing, the chase, the action, and splash—and the delightfully tongue twisting text—will have kids asking to hear this story again and again. With just a few words and page after page of fantastic expressions, A Bear, a Fish, and a Fishy Wish has the madcap energy and playfulness that keeps kids riveted—as they learn to read!\n\nPerfect for fans of Love and Hello, Lighthouse, The Yellow Bus from #1 New York Times bestselling Loren Long is a tender and hopeful new classic about a forgotten school bus that finds happiness and purpose in the most unexpected places--and in the journey along the way.\n\nThere is a bright yellow bus who spends her days driving. She loves carrying children from one important place to another. Every morning they climb in... Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, giggle, giggle-patter. And they fill her with joy.\n\nAs time passes, things change. The Yellow Bus gets a new driver, a new route, and new passengers, young and old. Until one day the driving stops for good, and the Yellow Bus is left on her own. And yet, no matter where she is, the Yellow Bus still finds joy and discovery in the world around her.\n\nWith stirring black-and-white artwork and powerful pops of color, The Yellow Bus is a poignant reflection on the many new beginnings life has to offer.\n\nFrom Sibert Honor–winning author Traci Sorell and Caldecott Medal–winning artist Michaela Goade comes a heartwarming picture book about a Native American family and the joy of moving back to their ancestral land.\n\nToday is a day of excitement—it’s time to move! As a young Cherokee girl says goodbye to the swing, the house, and the city she's called home her whole life, she readies herself for the upcoming road trip. While her mother drives, the girl draws the changing landscape outside her window. She looks forward to the end of the journey, where she'll eat the feast her family has prepared, play in the creek with her cousins, and settle into the new rhythm of home.\n\nWith warm, expressive artwork and spare, lyrical prose, the story of a young girl’s move toward rather than away from home unfolds.\n\nThere’s nothing like stepping into a garden and connecting with nature, and readers will revel in the pages of this beautiful picture book that celebrates these wondrous and inspiring places!\n\nGardens are glorious places blossoming with joy, wonder, and wisdom too. Whether it’s greeting the possibilities of each sunrise with the daylilies or appreciating what makes us as unique as the polkadot plant; whether it’s contemplating life’s thorns with the roses or standing as tall as a sunflower, spending time in nature can give us new ways of seeing. This flora-filled ode will inspire readers to observe the plants around them and appreciate the things that make each one—and each of us—special.\n\nFor anyone who has ever craved sleep--and anyone too full of energy to settle down--a comedy from Bob Shea, creator of the popular Dinosaur vs. series, and singular illustrator Jarvis.\n\nIt's sleepy time for Lion and Penguin. Correction: it should be sleepy time for Lion and Penguin, but Lion's eyes aren't tired, and his ears would like a story. Penguin, however, is tired and nods off into sweet candy dreams--until a noise wakes him. \"Oh, are you awake?\" asks Lion sweetly, seated before a drum set. \"Let's have that story, then!\" \"Not now. It is time to close your eyes and dream dreams.\" And so it goes, with an ever-more-disgruntled Penguin trying to nod off while an exuberant Lion innocently practices his drumming, bounces on his squeaky trampoline, and munches on his crunchy chips. Will Penguin need to resort to extreme measures to get his friend to sleep, or has the answer been there all along? Bob Shea's signature wit, delivered only in dialogue, and Jarvis's unassuming, retro art and knack for visual humor are sure to delight young readers--and their caregivers--whether at naptime, bedtime, or anytime.\n\nBunny can’t sleep because Dad forgot to check on him, so he sets out to check on Dad.\n\nBunny should be sleeping, but instead, he is waiting for Dad to come check on him. Dad always checks on him, but tonight, Dad is late.\n\nSoon Dad will come. He will come in the night\n\nto check on his little Bunny. Come on, Dad!\n\nCheck on me, check on me, check on me!\n\nBunny can’t wait anymore— he needs his dad! Slipping out of bed, Bunny packs a wagon of everything Dad might need: some water, a blanket, a snack, and their favorite book to share. Down the hall and through the dark, Bunny finds Dad fast asleep, oblivious to all the supplies Bunny offers him.\n\nAt last, Bunny resorts to a tap on the nose to wake Dad up. Dad checks on Bunny, and Bunny checks on Dad, who is happy to see him, if still groggy. They read their special book, and all is right with the world again.\n\nBestselling author Amy Hest teams up with Renata Liwska, illustrator of Deborah Underwood’s The Quiet Book, for a bedtime book as adorable and warm as two sleepy bunnies. Sure to soothe children dubious about staying in their rooms alone at night, Bunny Should Be Sleeping reminds young readers that they are safe and loved even when the house is dark and quiet.\n\nA stunning companion to If You Find a Leaf, this cheery picture book captures the excitement of summer and encourages children to see their collected seashells in an entirely new way. The artist incorporates real shells into her exquisite illustrations.\n\nA warm summer breeze and the gentle waves of the ocean wash ashore many different types of shells. In this story a girl collects shells and thinks of all the magnificent things they can be turned into with a little creativity. She imagines one shell as a swimming cap for diving into the crashing waves, another as a magical kaleidoscope, one as a rocket ship to take her way up high and another as a submarine for exploring the wonders of the world below. The girl draws inspiration from the unique beauty of each and every shell.\n\nIn this joyous celebration of a day at the beach, artist Aimee Sicuro uses real shells she’s hand selected to make her oh-so-charming illustrations. Any young reader who turns the pages of this beautiful book will be inspired to use their own imagination as they comb the beach for shells this summer.\n\nIt's a summer showdown at the beach as two taco slinging ducks see their turf taken over by an enterprising goose. This rollicking, rhyming, beachy read-aloud is sure to bring on lots of giggles.\n\n\"Duck. Duck. Taco truck. Working hard to make a buck.\"\n\nTwo food trucks staffed by sworn enemies: ducks vs. geese. Before you can say \"curly fries\", these two rivals are in an epic food truck face-off. \"Battle on!

In fact, she escapes through the bathroom window to avoid the inevitable. But when Bubble Gum Bison slips in the mud, gets covered with bubble gum, and has bird feathers stuck all-over her, she finally decides its time for a bath. But, what’s this? There’s no water! Could Blue Bison’s ramming habit have anything to do with the hole in the water tank?\n\nA wildly hilarious story with a subtle message that an unconventional solution can solve an unconventional problem.

Read along to find out!\n\nFrom the inimitable creator of El Deafo, this all-ages alphabet book is also a hand-wrought, high-fidelity, hilariously tongue-in-cheek homage to the golden days of album cover art.\n\nCece Bell loves music and collecting old record albums, her introduction explains, especially albums featuring animal artists. The bouncing harmonies of the Barbershop Beagles, the elegant crooning of the elephant Ella Fontaine, the hilarious rhymes of the Hip-Hop Hedgehogs--all are represented in this quirky ABC book that draws on the creator's personal collection of albums, memorabilia, and lyrics dating between 1944 and 1984, the heyday of album design. With wry, witty text, silly and sumptuous sound play, and biographical end matter on all twenty-six musical acts, the book commands and stands up to repeated readings. Bright, zany art--all painted and lettered by hand--a stellar design, and an album-size trim make it a collector's item in its own right, sure to grace the coffee tables of vinyl- and design-loving adults even as it tickles young funny bones. A hootenanny hosted by the creator of the Newbery Honor Book and Eisner Award winner El Deafo, Animal Albums from A to Z also quietly reminds us just how much music can mean to everyone.\n\nIn this darling picture book, the cutest, floofiest cat has a very busy, very mischievous day!\n\nFloof is floofy.\n\nFloof has many hobbies.\n\nFloof has very important work to do and Floof also has a lot of friends.\n\nFloof is about to have a very busy day...\n\nAn irresistible new picture book for cat-lovers, cute-lovers, and anyone who has ever been a little bit mischievous!\n\nKids (and grownups!) will delight in noticing that when the text says one thing, the pictures say something very different.

It may look like a Dalmatian, but it certainly doesn’t act like one. At first, Stephen and the visitor get off on the wrong paw. They quibble over kibble, debate sleeping arrangements, and must abandon earth dogs’ approach to bathroom breaks altogether to keep the peace. Is a shared love of bacon a strong enough foundation for this ordinary earth boy and extraordinary out-of-this-world canine to learn to live in harmony?\n\nOn a hot day, people come from all over the city to spend the day at the pool in this joyful picture book that’s a love song to summer, the city, community, and staying cool!\n\nToday is a pool day in the city!
