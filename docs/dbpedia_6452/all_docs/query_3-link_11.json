        "text": "John Carter (Andrew Stanton)\n\nThe Marriage of Maria Braun (Rainer Werner Fassbinder)\n\nLanglois (Roberto Guerra/Eila Hershon)\n\nDazed and Confused (Richard Linklater)\n\nMon Oncle (Jacques Tati)\n\nOthello (Oliver Parker)\n\nChicken For Linda! (Malta/Laudenbach)\n\n499 (Rodrigo Reyes)\n\nThe Hero (Satyajit Ray)\n\nA Month in the Country (Pat O’Connor)\n\n.\n\n1- John Carter has the reputation of being a disaster on the order of Howard The Duck or Ishtar. It isn’t by a long shot. I had just finished reading the first novel in Edgar Rice Burrough’s Barsoom series. The book is highly entertaining in a no-brainer adventure mode, and it is lots of fun to read. I am looking forward to the next in the series. I had this movie tucked away to watch someday. I was very pleased with it. It is no worse and probably better that the thousands of Marvel Comics Universe movies that are being cranked out. This movie had very attractive and capable leads, a fantastic story line, non-intrusive CGI and an adorable, loyal Martian creature named Woola. The story seems to be that for some reason the studio lost interest and hardly promoted the film. It did terribly in the box office and it shouldn’t have. In fact, if we have have ten million Avengers movies, we should have at least one more John Carter film\n\n2- Henri Langlois should be a hero to all serious film lovers. He created the Cinematheque Francaise and was preserving films when no one thought that it was something that needed doing. He organized showings of silent and early sound films wherever he could, even in his mother’s living room. He is credited with starting the 1968 student riots in Paris which began as reaction the government firing him from the Cinematheque because he was hoarding (he would say preserving) highly volatile copies of film on original nitrate stock. The students were outraged at the government overreach. Riots ensued. Langlois was reinstated and the nitrate films was preserved. Who knows what we would have lost if it hadn’t been for Henri Langlois\n\n3- Dazed and Confused didn’t have the same joyous recklessness of that other Linklater tapestry film, Slacker,but it is more disciplined. The young kids on the verge of adulthood are pretty much all repulsive as teenagers can be, but what great performances.\n\n3- In many ways, the films of Jacques Tati are as demanding as films by Bergman or Tarkovsky. But of course much funnier than both. What makes them ‘difficult’ is that, like Bergman and Tarkovsky, you need to give yourself over to the films’ rhythms. However you are rewarded with a childlike, loving view of a crazy adult world, and not existential angst.\n\n4- Thanks once again to the Criterion Channel for giving me the opportunity to see films of recent World cinema that I wouldn’t have an opportunity to see elsewhere. The conceit of 499 is that a Conquistador of Cortes’ company lands in modern day Veracruz and traces the route he took more than 500 hundred years before to Tenochtitlan, modern-day Mexico City. This interesting conceit is superimposed on documentary footage of the suffering of modern-day descendants of the Aztecs. The Conquistador is amazed that these ‘savages’ survived the Spanish attempt to purge them from the land and to establish a piece of Catholic Spain in the New World. It is a strong indictment of the colonial mentality. The testimony of many of the modern-day Mexicans is harrowing.\n\n5- The Hero is another satisfying banquet of a film from Satyajit Ray. This one is a train film, populated with lots of well-drawn characters who mix and separate during the trip. Ray was a genius.\n\n6- The novel which A Month in the Country is based on is a kind of understated masterpiece ostensibly about two men being healed through their crafts during an idyllic summer month in Yorkshire in the early 20s. I should have known better that to watch the film. It is a sincere and loving treatment of the book, but this is a book that should never have been made into a film. The power of the book is subtle and it comes from the characters’ self-reflections…..something that never works in film but works so well in prose. Kudos to the filmmakers for trying. They didn’t cheapen the original. They just turned it into something different.\n\nThe Day the Earth Caught Fire (Val Guest)\n\nDiner (Barry Levinson)\n\nA Sunday in the Country (Bertrand Tavernier)\n\nRepeat Performance (Alfred L. Werker)\n\nOrpheus (Jean Cocteau)\n\nPlácido (Luis García Berlanga)\n\nThe Virgin Suicides (Sophia Coppola)\n\nAfire (Christian Petzold)\n\nSwann in Love (Volker Schlöndorf)\n\nThe Munekata Sisters (Yasujiro Ozu)\n\n1- The Day the Earth Caught Fire is a tight British 1960s newspaper drama disguised as a nuclear apocalypse horror film. It’s very no-nonsense as a procedural and does not get too strident with its politics. Very enjoyable as a period piece.\n\n2-I hadn’t seen Diner since its first release. I remembered it as a nostalgic look at boys refusing to become adults even though their life is maturing all around them. I am not sure if it is a matter of general consciousness-raising or personal maturity, but now I found it a repulsive depiction of what is classified as ‘toxic masculinity’. The overt misogyny is kind of shocking. Perhaps that measuring stick was missing from my critical arsenal back in the 1980s but now it prevents me from seeing the characters as anything but disgusting. My big question about the movie is whether or not Barry Levinson, who wrote and directed, intended us to view the characters as I now do or whether they are a nostalgic view of boys being boys at the cusp of adulthood. I sure hope it is the latter.\n\n3- A Sunday in the Country is as beautiful as I remembered it. So many poignant depictions: the miscommunication between generations, the ever-present past. The realization that devoting a life to art, even though one receives acclaim, might have been a waste because one didn’t have genius. In many ways this quiet family portrait reminded me of the best of Yasujiro Ozu, with Sabine Azéma in the Setsuko Hara role. She is ravishing.\n\n4- Someone referred to Repeat Performance as a cross between The Twilight Zone and It’s A Wonderful Life. I find that to be pretty accurate although it one-ups the Capra monster by positing that though fate might be slightly altered, it will usually come out the same. Take that, all you believers in Free Will\n\n5- I admire Orpheus but I don’t love it like I love Beauty and the Beast. The Beatnik substitution for the Bacchic revelers must have been quite cutting edge at the time, but now just dates the whole thing. It glaringly clashes with the rest of the classical atmosphere. But we get the amazing Maria Casarés as Death. She makes everything great\n\n6- I am really enjoying getting to know that films of Berlanga. It’s so satisfying to know that even after a lifetime of movie watching there are volumes yet to be discovered. I guess it is usual to compare and contrast him to his fellow Spaniard Luis Buñuel. It think that does both filmmakers an injustice. In the films of his that I have seen so far, Berlanga has the wider canvas and has amazing control over the chaos he spreads across the screen. Both are obviously anti-bourgeois, but Berlanga’s is less anarchic and absurdist, and therefore funnier. But don’t get me wrong, I love Buñuel, too. Just look at the name of this blog!\n\n7- I found The Virgin Suicides as ravishing as I did when it came out 25 years ago. (Look at that – I used ‘ravishing’ twice in one post!) I never read the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides so I am not sure about this but I find all the characters’ bafflement of the girls’ motive for suicide to be a red herring. It seems pretty clear to me that they had more than enough reason to do what they did, and I wonder if in the book everyone’s protestation of confusion is masking a guilt for not doing anything before the dreadful events happened. Kirsten Dunst is spectacular. Kathleen Turner has never gotten her due as an actress. The Virgin Suicides would be a spectacular double-bill with Picnic at Hanging Rock. You would leave the theater in a daze.\n\n8- I was super-impressed by Christian Petzold’s post-Holocaust drama Phoenix. He had such control over that material and he gripped you until the very end. I was excited to see his latest, Afire, called Rote Himmel in German, which I think is a more effect name and would have worked perfectly in English as Red Sky. I am disappointed to say that I found it ponderous. It is always a tricky thing to devote a whole work to a character is simply unlikeable and not interestingly so. I’m looking at you, Emma Bovary. There are a lot of elements swirling around here, but they just don’t gel.\n\n9- Volker Schlöndorf made one of the best films based on a novel with his film version of The Tin Drum. Swann in Love is a complete misfire. And it is NOT because Proust is unfilmable. See Chantal Akerman’s The Captive and Raúl Ruiz ‘ Time Regained for evidence to the contrary.\n\n10- Hitchcock and Lubitsch all made clunkers, so I guess it was inevitable to find one made by the exquisite Yasujiro Ozu. According to my research this is the first film he made after leaving his home studio so maybe he had to give up some artistic autonomy? Perhaps. The Munekata Sisters is way less subtle (read: Japanese) than the other films I have seen by him. Great stars of the Japanese cinema are on hand and the script was once again written by Ozu and his long-time collaborator. It just verges on melodrama too often. The slow burn to an overwhelming emotional climax that you expect from an Ozu film are just not there.\n\nMartha (Rainer Werner Fassbinder)\n\nChildren of Paradise (Marcel Carné)\n\nExperience (Abbas Kiarostami)\n\nYouth Without Youth (Francis Ford Coppola)\n\nZelig (Woody Allen)\n\nBabbitt (William Keighly)\n\nWe Who Are About Die (Christy Cabanne)\n\nRed, White and Royal Blue (Matthew López)\n\nIn a Lonely Place (Nicholas Ray)\n\nThe Americanization of Emily (Arthur Hiller)\n\n.\n\n1- It’s probably more sensible not to consider the films of Rainer Werner Fassbinder individually. Sure, some are much better than others and they deal with different themes, but for me they are just an amazing explosion of creativity over a very short period of time. He moved quickly from project to project. Sometimes the haste is evident, sometimes you see a creative genius at the height of his powers. Martha is a good example of his genius mode. A cruel story of the subjugation of a simple woman and a terrifyingly manipulative husband played by Karlheinz Boehm, who was a terrifying film maker in the notorious Peeping Tom. What ties this film to many of his others is the hommage to Douglas Sirk. The melodramatic flourishes he took from Sirk he makes his own in this film.\n\n2- I find it hard to believe that I have not commented yet on The Children of Paradise. Commenting on it is a daunting task. For me it is not a film, it is a monument…it is enormous…it is an entire world. I feel guilty when I put the DVD back on the shelf because it deserves always to be playing. It is the great epic of misdirected love. The performance of Jean-Louis Barrault as the mime Baptiste is astonishing. The grace and fluidity he shows as he passes through the theatrical and the ‘real’ world are breathtaking. I never was impressed with Arletty as the inscrutable Garance. However, this time around I found the character completely scrutable and as nuanced and fluid as Barrault’s Baptiste. The final sequence, played against the madness of Carnival, builds to an incredible tension which is never released. Baptiste will always be running after Garance’s carriage for eternity.\n\n3- I have watched all the feature films of Kiarostami, and thanks to the Criterion Collection, I have been catching up on his short films. They were made before and after the Iranian Islamic Revolution and they were mostly made for and/or about children. They range from very short instructional films about things like learning colors and learning how to resolve problems without fighting, to powerful character studies of troubled kids. Some of them foreshadow his later masterpieces with their penetrating portraits of children. Experience is under an hour long and it portrays the life of a lonely orphan who lives and works in a photo shop. The solitude is crushing. He does attempt to better his situation, but to no avail. This would actually be an excellent introduction to Kiarostami. I hope to post something about the short films soon\n\n4- Poor Coppola. The Godfather is the same kind of albatross that Citizen Kane was for Orson Welles: after a single burst of perfection, what ever can you do later? Youth Without Youth is his return to filmmaking after a decade. He certainly seems to have more resources that Welles ever had. The film is beautiful to look at, but it is a mess. The narrative flow in The Godfather is so controlled but here it refuses to be tamed. The story makes sense….kind of….the performances are excellent but it was hard to conclude what the point was.\n\n5- The late 70s/early 80s were a golden era for Woody Allen. After a series of amusing (and for me slightly annoying) broad comedies, Annie Hall came out of nowhere. It was self-assured, brilliantly metafictional, refreshingly self-critical. The humor was beautifully controlled and he took the time to flesh out his characters, especially the lovable and ultimately complicated Annie. There followed a series of wonderful films that showed that Annie Hall had not been a fluke. By the time Zelig came around I thought there was nothing Woody Allen couldn’t do. I was so happy to see that it is as marvelous today at it was back in the 80s. The technical aspects are remarkable for the time. Yes, there are a lot of icky sexual comments that make one think of later unpleasantness, and there is the obsessive joke-making about Hitler and Nazis. It seems to be essential for that generation of Jewish comic filmmakers – I’m looking at you Mel Brooks). Bottom line: it is as wonderful as I remembered. But there was a nagging feeling of sadness about it. This type of Jewish humor, so rooted in the Yiddish sensibility has all but disappeared. Yes, there are Jewish comics now, but their connection to the ghetto is tenuous. But as long as we can see Zelig, we still have a connection to that time. Plus, you get the voice of the original Betty Boop, Mae Questel herself, singing the most delightful song in the film: Chameleon Days.\n\n6- I read the Sinclair Lewis novel about a year ago, so I was intrigued to see what a somewhat-contemporary film version of Babbitt would be like. The bones of the plot are there but the scathing critique of pre-Depression America is missing. The artistry of the novel is that as you read it you realize that the affable George Babbitt is completely amoral, but does not have the capacity to acknowledge it or, perhaps better said, he has all kinds of self-deceptive ways of not acknowledging it. Since it was made in 1934 just before the Production Code really took hold, I was expecting more adult treatments of his infidelities and unethical business dealings. Instead we get a kind of screwball plot that gets Babbitt into a little hot water which he gets out by the end of the film, with everyone’s admiration and love for him still intact. But I guess I should have expected that since they cast Guy Kibbee in the lead. He always seems to play a loveable but philandering middle-aged blowhard. The great character of the novel was cut down to fit this persona.\n\n7- We Who Are About to Die is something else entirely. From 1937, it is a tight 80 minute film about a sweet young man with a sweet young girlfriend who is framed for murder but some not-sweet gangsters. He is sentenced to death by hanging. This being Hollywood, you never really fear that he will swing, but it gets pretty tense for a while. It also seems to be a thinly veiled plea against the death penalty. A happily discovered gem courtesy of TCM.\n\n8- I keep dipping my toe into the pool of Gay rom-coms and am usually disappointed by how boneheaded they are. Red, White and Royal Blue was better than most, mostly because it makes use of 1930s-style romance tropes like meeting cute, then hating each other, then loving each other, etc. There is real chemistry between the two very handsome leads and the first sex between them is much more explicit than what you would expect from this type of thing. All the critics hated Uma Thurman as the Texas-born President of the US and mother of one of the romantic leads. I thought she was wonderful. Like most rom-coms, believability is not its strong suit, but it was a very pleasant two hours and far more believable than Brokeback Mountain (*shudder*)\n\n9- If you have ready this blog at all, you will know that I have no great love for Film Noir. As I have written before, it always seems to be style over substance, posturing over feelings. I was happy to watch In A Lonely Place, and to find a true emotional masterpiece. Bogart is astounding and nuanced playing a troubled screenwriter who has a chance for happiness and sanity when he falls in love with and is loved by his gorgeous neighbor played by Gloria Grahame. It is Film Noir, so it isn’t too much of a spoiler to tell you that things don’t work out. But it is how they don’t work out that makes this film remarkable. The film has the most tragic ending of any film I have seen, where no one dies at the end.\n\n10- The late 50s and early 60s were a great period for powerful, adult comedy-dramas. Think of The Apartment as the classic example of this. Adult and nuanced in its storytelling, featuring adult and nuanced characters that you can really care about. The Americanization of Emily is another great example. I fear it is quite forgotten now and the fact that it stars Julie Andrews in her next film after Mary Poppins might work against it. I am hear to say that Andrews creates a fully fleshed out, multifaceted and appealingly flawed character. The screenplay is by Paddy Chayefsky so you know it is going to be scathing about something, and here the something is the stupidity of war. Seems like an easy mark, but it is handled beautifully and brutally. This is a film that deserves to be better remembered. One of the last great comedy-dramas before the studios turned their attention to kids.\n\nThe Devils (Ken Russell)\n\nThe Killers (Andrei Tarkovsky)\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry)\n\nRed Beard (Akira Kurosawa)\n\nGreen Porno (Isabella Rossellini)\n\nFrance (Bruno Dumont)\n\nOppenheimer (Christopher Nolan)\n\nAnnie Hall (Woody Allen)\n\nBlack Orpheus (Marcel Camus)\n\nCoriolanus (Ralph Fiennes)\n\n*\n\n1- When I think of Ken Russell, I think of a director with access to incredible resources – the best set designers, the best costumers, the best actors – but is completely unencumbered by restraint and good taste. When I saw his movies when they first came out I was dazzled by their flash. They were shocking at the time. Now they just seem like tired exercises in Camp, which titillate absolutely no one. I had fond memories of his biographical films and hoped that they might have escaped his manic excesses, especially the early ones he made for BBC TV on subjects as varied as Isadora Duncan and the composer Delius. I haven’t seen any of them recently, but if my viewing of his Mahler is any indication, no thanks.\n\nIt’s all just tired camp and tired camp is even tireder than tired Film Noir.\n\nHow did he get Vanessa Redgrave and Oliver Reed to debase themselves so thoroughly? The novel it is based on is by Aldous Huxley. I bet it is more reasonable.\n\n2- The Killers was a student project by the soon-to-be legendary Andrei Tarkovsky. Based on a Hemingway short story, it is a tight little film with no flab at all. If anyone is looking for a tolerable way to make a Film Noir, please have a look at this.\n\n3- I had avoided Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Charlie Kaufman has such a fanboy base, that I was sure I would be rolling my eyes for the whole runtime. Reader, I loved it! Brilliant, of course, but what was surprising to me was that it was so heart-felt. Often these films that are obsessed with multi-verse are too clever by half and the whole exercise become about dazzling the audience with their cleverness. At least with me this always backfires. If that’s all you got, then I’m not terribly interested (I’m looking at you Everything Everywhere All At Once). You put a lot of work into a complicate plot, bravo. There needs to be more, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has more in spades. The lead performances by Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey are so quirky yet understated and touching. I think Carrey gets my award for the most undervalued actor.\n\n4- Criterion always has interesting things on offer. Lately they have been showing a series of very short films by Isabella Rossellini called Green Porno, explaining the reproductive habits of various living creatures. She plays the creatures in question. It’s all very DIY and very adorable and a little nasty. I had a great time.\n\n5- France is another great offering from Criterion. It is about that ever-interesting intersection between news and entertainment. Lea Seydoux gives a fascinating portrayal of a successful TV presenter at the top of her game, but who is knocked off her balance by circumstances for which she is responsible. I am sure that the political content would be more apparent to a French audience. The character’s name is France and in some respect, which I’ll admit goes over my goes my head, she must be a stand-in for the nation and its soul. It is not at brilliant as the similar Marriage of Maria Braun, but it is after different game, I think. It is a powerful and constantly fascinating character study. We don’t get epic statements like the Fassbinder too often nowadays. We get big but empty films, which brings me to……\n\n6- Oppenheimer. No question this is a film with a huge amount of talent and dollars behind it. But…..so much bloat. Everyone was so busy rhapsodizing over this crowd-approved enterprise that no one mentioned that the central character is an undeveloped cipher. In fact the movie only came alive for me once the emphasis was off Oppenheimer and on Strauss, played ingeniously by Robert Downey, Jr. This was a character created with thought and artistry. Strauss is complex, appealling and constantly surprising. I couldn’t wait for the bomb to drop, so we could finally concentrate on the more interesting McCarthy era skullduggery. Once we got to this point I asked myself “Did they really want to make a film about the Manhattan Project? It seems that they couldn’t wait to get to the second part of the story considering how much nuance was lavished on it, compared to the way we had to barrel through Los Alamos with cameo appearances by Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi and Albert Einstein. It must be me, though. Christopher Nolan’s films are wildly acclaimed and usually they just rile me up to the point that I don’t want to play along anymore, e.g. Memento and Inception.\n\n7- I happen to be teaching Coriolanus and I was very happy to come upon this lean and very mean film adaptation by Ralph Fiennes, who plays the lead role. For all the updating to some unidentified Eastern European locale, the film is very faithful to the source play. I was sad to see Menenius’ belly speech cut, but you can’t have anything. Vanessa Redgrave is mind-boggling as the mind-boggling Volumnia. Poor Coriolanus never had a chance with a mother like that!\n\nAltered States (Ken Russell)\n\nFitzwilly (Delbert Mann)\n\nPlatinum Blonde (Frank Capra)\n\nA Midsummer Night’s Dream (Michael Hoffman)\n\nThe Dead (John Huston)\n\nIn The Mood For Love (Wong Kar Wai)\n\nEl Conde (Pablo Larraín)\n\nFilm, the Living Record of Our Memory (Ines Toharia)\n\nMagnolia (Paul Thomas Anderson)\n\nThe Grandmaster (Wong Kar Wai)\n\n–\n\n1- I am rewatching a lot of films that I saw at their premieres, but not since. Thank you, TCM. One such film is Altered States. I remembered how handsome William Hurt was and that it was vaguely psychedelic. It’s directed by Ken Russell, so that is a given. It’s a lot of raised-consciousess stuff that doesn’t really make a lot of sense. Regressing to a primordial state by taking drugs and going into an isolation tank? OK. It was fun to watch again once I stopped trying to make sense out of the plot.\n\n2- Fitzwilly is a film that makes me feel my age because it is a film that would never be made now, but I can recall a time when tons of films like this were being made and were showcased in places like Radio City Music Hall. The reason that it could never be made now is that there is no appetite anymore for sentimentality. The plot here is very cute, the star is Dick Van Dyke who is very cute in the title role and as a bonus you get the grande dame of cute, Dame Edith Evans (‘A haaaandbag?!?!?!?). There is steady sense of whimsy from beginning to end and it is totally disarming. But is there any place for whimsy now? I think it is an endangered cinematic species.\n\n3- Platinum Blonde is a Frank Capra that does not get sickeningly sanctimonious. It has an early performance by Jean Harlow. I know she was from Kansas City, but am I the only one who thinks that she sounds like she comes from deepest, darkest Brooklyn?\n\nWhat was most interesting to me was Harlow’s costar, an actor named Robert Williams. This was his only starring role, and he was dead of peritonitis just days after the film opened. It was the same disease that would claim Harlow in just a few years. What is interesting to me is Williams’ comic styling. He is often mumbling, talking to himself or in aside. If he had been around longer and had more starring roles opposite great comediennes like Harlow or Mae West perhaps what seems like mannerisms in this film would have become a kind of comic standard, like Cary Grant’s suave delivery or William Powell’s elegant comic styling.\n\n4- I am currently teaching A Midsummer Night’s Dream. This is an excellent version and the only major studio version I can think of besides the 1930s Max Reinhardt version with Mickey Rooney as Puck. This is a wonderful version of the play with no outlandish ‘directorisms’ marring your enjoyment of the play. The changes that are made are totally acceptable and enhance your enjoyment. For example, during the Pyramis and Thisbe play, after being laughed at by the nobles for delivering his lines is an affected falsetto, Francis Flute drops into his ‘real’ voice and gives an extraordinarily moving reading of Thisbe’s lament over Pyramis’ body. It really works and it shuts up those annoying, insulting nobles\n\n5- I was reading The Dead for a book group discussion, so I rewatched this masterpiece. John Huston’s career went out in an amazing one-two punch of Prizzi’s Honor and this film. It is very faithful to the Joyce novella in mood and characterization, and that is perhaps its greatest merit, along with an amazing performance by Anjelica Huston as the complicated Gretta Conroy. I can’t imagine a better adaptation of a James Joyce work\n\n6- You are privileged to live in a time when you can watch In The Mood For Love when every you want. Don’t even think we can be friends if you have never seen it.\n\n7- El Conde satisfies every need I have in a horror film plus it is wickedly funny and outrageously gory (but I am sure you can handle it.) I won’t even divulge one iota of the plot because its unraveling is the joy (?) of watching it. It is also, along with Citizen Kane and The Seventh Seal, the most stunning use of black and white photography I have ever seen.\n\n8- Film, the Living Record of Our Memory is an excellent and informative documentary about the history and techniques of film preservation. These people are the equivalent of the Irish monks and the Islamic scholars who saved the great works of antiquity during the ‘dark’ ages. Special acknowledgment must be made to Martin Scorsese. I have mixed feelings about his movies, but that is my problem. I have nothing but reverence for his work in World Cinema Preservation.\n\n9- Magnolia needs its own post to do it justice. It is so rich and powerful but at the same time fun and moving. The closest experience to watching this movie is watching my beloved Nashville. More to come on this magnificent, unjustly forgotten film.\n\n10- While watching The Grandmaster I wished that I knew more about Hong Kong Martial Arts Films. But then I realized about halfway through that this is a Wong Kar Wai film masquerading as a Honk Kong Martial Arts film. The same sumptuous emotion that you feel in In The Mood For Love or Happy Together\n\nThe Long Day Closes (Terence Davies)\n\nCrybaby (John Waters)\n\nMonty Python & The Holy Grail (Terry Gilliam/Terry Jones)\n\nBarbie (Greta Gerwig)\n\nThe Executioner (Luis Garcia Berlanga)\n\nThe Exorcist (William Friedkin)\n\nThe Palm Beach Story (Preston Sturges)\n\nWalk Hard (Jake Kasdan)\n\nThe Rapture (Michael Tolkin)\n\nFanny and Alexander – Television Version (Ingmar Bergman)\n\n*\n\n1- John Waters is often referred to as the Pope of Trash or as a shockmeister. Those labels might have referred to his early films from the Divine era. His later films are actually sweet and funny. The shocks are on par with a six year old making you look and them opening their mouth to show you a mouth full of chewed food. Shocking? No? Cute? A little Cry Baby is sweet and dopey in the vein of Hairspray. Fun to watch and Johnny Depp is beautiful with his glycerine tears. I had fun watching it, but not a lot of nourishment here\n\n2- I feel like I don’t need to write anything about Barbie. It’s all been said. I certainly had a good time and laughed a lot, which I haven’t done in a contemporary movie in a long time. But is it Feminism 2.0? Not so sure, but it certainly isn’t the reactionary film that a lot of people are accusing it of being. My big question is why was it such a phenomenon?\n\n3- I am continuing my exploration of Berlanga’s movies (thank you Criterion Collection). I was told that The Execution is among his most highly regarded works. I see why. It is wickedly funny in the vein of Bunuel, but not as cruel\n\n4- I saw The Exorcist when it first came out with another Jewish friend. We were both expecting to be terrified out of our wits. Instead, we found it engaging and interesting from an anthropological point of view but not terrifying at all. When I saw that my Catholic friends were traumatized by the movie, I understood it was because as a Jew I didn’t have the idea of the Devil luring me into temptation leading to eternal damnation. Watching it again, I think it is extremely well-made. The plight of Father Damian is particularly touching. But as a whole I was more interested in the concept than terrified by it.\n\n5- I don’t know how I missed Walk Hard. It is the best send-up of a biopic I have ever seen. All the cliches of a struggling musicians climb to the top are there. Unlike This Is Spinal Tap it doesn’t mock the characters but it mocks the conventions of the genre. The humor is quite broad and often ridiculous, but the whole enterprise is a sophisticated piece of film criticism\n\n6- The Rapture is another film that I saw when it first came out. It seems to be completely forgotten today, which is a shame. In this un-nuanced time, a nuanced consideration of fundamentalist religion is exactly what is needed but we will never get it. The character Mimi Rodgers plays is possibly the bravest character I have seen in a film\n\nStranger than Paradise (Jim Jarmush)\n\nMetal Lords (Peter Sollett)\n\nDonnie Darko (Richard Kelly)\n\nMan Wanted (William Dieterle)\n\nThe Masque of the Red Death (Roger Corman)\n\nThe Fall of the House of Usher (Roger Corman)\n\nMurder at the Zoo (A. Edward Sutherland)\n\nLa Llorona (Jayro Bustamante)\n\nDoctor X (Michael Curtiz)\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness (John Carpenter)\n\n*\n\n1- I am determined to watch more Jim Jarmush, so I watched Stranger Than Paradise again. It is the first film of his I watched, at least 30 years ago. It is his first feature and surprisingly it is much more formalistic than the later films of his that I have seen. It is funny and sad and reminds me of a very ugly time in Brooklyn when everything was grimy and dangerous and no one would have though of going to Bushwick, let alone live there. I liked the rigor of the single takes, up to a point. The acting is phenomenal, especially the Hungarian aunt who for some reason is living in a dump of a house near a highway in Ohio.\n\n2- The only reason I watched Metal Lords was because it stars a phenomenal young actor named Adrian Greensmith. He blew me away in a YA series on Amazon Prime called Harlan Coben’s Shelter. This show was ultimately unsatisfying and kind of poorly plotted but Greensmith was amazing. I hope he blossoms.\n\n3- I dodged Donnie Darko for years because I thought it was going to be one of those exhausting “Try and figure me out but you will be wrong’ puzzle movies like Mulholland Drive or Memento or Everything Everywhere All At Once. Well, I was kind of right. That’s what it is and I did my due diligence after watching it and read a few articles ‘explain’ what it was ‘about’, so I felt like I gave it a fair shake. I will admit that I did enjoy watching it. It is beautiful to look at and just understandable enough to get (mostly) what is going on. But I just don’t like movies that make me feel like a prize is waiting for me at the end if I ‘get it’.\n\n4- Man Wanted is a perfect example of a pre-Code comedy that seems naughtier that it actually is. If it were made in France of the time, it would have been a lot more risque. It stars Kay Francis who was an enormous star in the 30s and it all but forgotten except for the kinds of people who watch TCM. Opposite her is the very handsome David Manners, another actor of the time who is forgotten even though he played the romantic lead in Lugosi’s Dracula. The good thing about these pre-Code comedies it that they are breezy and almost always under 90 minutes long. Producers and directors of today’s elephantine films: Take Note!\n\n5-The Masque of the Red Death and The Fall of the House of Usher are two low-budget Roger Corman ‘adaptations’ of Edgar Allan Poe stories which Criterion Collection was featuring this month. I watched them to get a jump on my annual Halloween horror film extravaganza. The latter was Corman’s first foray into these stories and he was able to use elaborate sets already at the English studio where he was filming. It is pretty good and kind of depraved in the way you want your low-budget horror films to be. The Fall of the House of Usher, however, was a holy (or unholy) mess. Watching it I kept saying to myself “This is fun, but it makes absolutely no sense.” Then I remembered that wise words of my beloved High School English teacher, the great Marion Freed. A while ago I read a bunch of Poe stories and just didn’t get them. So I asked Freed what she thought of them. Her reply: “Poe? He’s your decay guy. If it’s decay you want, he’s your guy.” So now I say unto you, if it’s decay you want, The Fall of the House of Usher is your film.\n\n6- Criterion is featuring Pre-code horror for Spooky Season. This often means Universal Horror from the 30s. Beyond the expected Dracula and Bride of Frankenstein, they are offering lesser known efforts like Murder at the Zoo and Doctor X – a veritable Lionel Atwill festival of evil. An odd feature of these films is a wacky comic character, in this case Lee Tracy as a wacky P.R. man for the eponymous zoo. Inexplicably scantily clad women seem to be part of the genre, in this case Fay Wray a year before she meets King Kong. Neither are great in the way that the James Whale Universal films are great, but they’ll do the trick for a fix of Old Hollywood spookiness.\n\n7- The film that La LLorona most reminds me of it The Devil’s Backbone, which is a great compliment to La LLorona. Both are films that are political indictments in the guise of horror films. In The Devil’s Backbone, the horrors of the Spanish Civil War are dealt with. In La LLorona it is the indigenous genocides in Guatemala under the rule of Rios Montt. In both cases, the supernatural provides the right atmosphere for the horrors done by humans and not otherworldly beings. Perhaps it is more powerful to understand these atrocities when couched in the tropes of horror film? Perhaps. In any event, La LLorona is a powerful political engagement with a horrifying period using the Maya legend of a crying women (a llorona) wailing for her murdered children as a stand-in for the Guatemalans whose loved ones were murdered or disappeared during Rios Montt’s insane purging of enemies, under the guise of purging the country of ‘communists’. There is a scene of an indigenous woman giving testimony at the genocide trial of the Rios Montt character that will be seared into my memory. Her face is ornately veiled and she is speaking in a subtitled Maya language. Her speech is slow and quiet. The result is devastating.\n\n8- Compared to the horror films of the 1930s and 1940s the more contemporary films have absolutely no interest in reassuring the audience that all will turn out well. In fact, you can pretty much count on the opposite to be the case. When discussing Doctor X with my friend Aaron, he posited that if the film were made today, Fay Wray would never have emerged unscathed. I thought of this when I was watching In The Mouth of Madness. John Carpenter in many ways is the godfather of modern horror and with that comes the nihilistic world-view. The movie has a fascinating premise: a phenomenally successful horror novel is driving the world insane and unspeakable acts of cruelty are sweeping the world. The end is just about as bleak as you could imagine. I really liked it a lot, but I was sure ready for a little Lee Tracy when it was over."
