Special Screening

Synopsis

One of the most enduringly popular films ever made, Steven Spielberg’s ‘E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial’ was a runaway box-office hit when it first hit the big screen in 1982, and was the world’s top-grossing film for a decade. When he is accidentally abandoned on Earth, an alien scientist from another world takes refuge in a suburban home, where he is protected from meddling government agencies by Elliott and his siblings. Dubbed ‘E.T.’ by the youngsters, the alien soon discovers that he cannot stay alive in Earth’s atmosphere, so with some low-tech assistance from his new friends, he sets out to create a device that will allow him to contact his spaceship and go home. Thirty years after its release, this endearing story of a very special intergalactic friendship retains all of its heartfelt charm.
