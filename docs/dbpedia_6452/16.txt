According to the 22 July 1916 Motion Picture News, Mary Miles Minter had already begun filming scenes for Dulcie's Adventure. The 12 August 1916 Motography noted that she, director James Kirkwood, and fellow company members were "doing a great deal of location work, leaving the studio early in the morning and returning after nightfall."

The 30 September 1916 Moving Picture World noted that "painstaking care" was given to "the costuming and the setting of the picture. Whether in the garments of a poor lonesome little white girl, not allowed to play with the neighboring pickaninnies or the 'poor white trash,' in the antiquated hoop-skirts deemed fashionable by her Aunt Netta, or in her gorgeous imported white satin wedding gown which crowns the picture."

A photo-illustrated item in the Photo-Play Journal about Mary Miles Minter's many pets at the American Film Company studio in Santa Barbara, CA, introduced a small pig and a bushy-tailed squirrel that "portrayed" her childhood playmates in Dulcie's Adventure. Her pet squirrel in particular had a memorable part in the film because Dulcie's grocery boy sweetheart gave it to her, and her aunt made her set it free. "The studio manager here keeps [the squirrel] in a little cage for me," Miss Minter said. Dulcie's Adventure was the fourteen-year-old actress's second "Mutual Star Production," following Youth's Endearing Charm (1916, see entry). It was followed by Faith (1916, see entry).

Some sources referred to Molly Shafer as Mellie Schafer.

This film was reissued as No Wedding Bells in 1919.
