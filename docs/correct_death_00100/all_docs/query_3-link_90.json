    "text": "Share\n\nThe corpse of Slobodan Milosevic, three days after his death, took on its penultimate role last night as a political shuttlecock, batted across Europe by his family and supporters.\n\nYesterday, the former Yugoslav leader's son Marko, known as a thuggish entrepreneur when his father ruled Serbia in the 1990s, emerged from hiding in Russia to land in Amsterdam, where his father died in a jail cell at the United Nations war-crimes court on Friday night.\n\nFrom the moment of his arrival, the young Mr. Milosevic held Serbia transfixed with his indecision about a final resting place for his father, who died at 64. Would it be in Moscow or Belgrade, or a smaller Serbian town? From minute to minute, the story changed -- and each transformation seemed more heavily freighted with political consequences.\n\nBy late last night, it appeared a final decision had been made. \"Slobodan Milosevic will be buried in Serbia,\" said Socialist Party vice-president Milorad Vucelic, speaking live on state television at the end of a day of reports that said the Milosevic family might opt for a funeral in Russia.\n\nMarko Milosevic accompanied his father's casket yesterday as it was loaded into a hearse and moved to Schiphol airport in Amsterdam. The body is to arrive in Belgrade early this afternoon. There was no indication as to when the funeral would take place, but Mr. Milosevic's lawyer confirmed the location. \"The son of Mr. Milosevic has just informed [The]Hague tribunal that the funeral of his father will be in Belgrade,\" Zdenko Tomanovic told reporters in The Hague.\n\nA team of Russian doctors came to the Netherlands with the younger Mr. Milosevic to perform an independent autopsy on his father. The former general's supporters believe he was poisoned in prison at The Hague, where he had spent six years defending himself on charges of genocide and other war crimes related to the Balkan wars, a trial that was declared null and void yesterday morning.\n\nMr. Milosevic had regular access to drugs and alcohol smuggled into his prison cell, UN tribunal officials said yesterday, the Associated Press reported. The unnamed officials said two doctors had concluded that Mr. Milosevic intentionally took drugs that undermined the medicine prescribed for his heart ailments, in order to slow the pace of his trial.\n\nAt the centre of talks about Mr. Milosevic's resting place was Mirjana Markovic, Mr. Milosevic's widow and Marko's mother, who faces corruption-related criminal charges in Serbia from her years as the head of a small Serbian political party that was part of her husband's extremist coalition. A Belgrade court yesterday agreed to drop an arrest warrant against her, but she might still have to appear in court if she arrives in Serbia. Police are also interested in questioning her in connection with the 2003 killing of former Serbian president Ivan Stambolic.Ms. Markovic was also demanding a hero's gravesite for her husband in the Alley of the Heroes in central Belgrade, Socialist Party officials said. The Serbian government proposed the lesser Cemetery of the Liberators of Belgrade, which is across the road and is home to the Red Army troops who marched on the city in 1944.\n\n\"The event is symbolically very important, because funerals in our culture play a huge role,\" said Slobodan Markovich, a Belgrade philosopher who specializes in democratic institutions. \"A funeral, even a seemingly minor one, is an event that can turn Serbian society in a completely new direction.\"\n\nHe pointed to several precedents. In 1983, a Yugoslav official of Serbian ethnicity named Alexander Rankovic, who had been purged from the Communist Party by Tito in 1966 and disappeared from public life, died and was buried in a secret ceremony. Learning of the burial through word of mouth, more than 100,000 Serbs attended his unannounced Belgrade funeral in an event that many consider the birth of Mr. Milosevic's ethnic nationalist movement.\n\nLikewise, the 2003 funeral of Zoran Djindjic, the democratic reformer who replaced Mr. Milosevic in 2000, saw the party of the assassinated leader rise in popularity from 7 per cent to more than 30 per cent.\n\nMany Serbs feel that the Milosevic funeral will almost certainly have a similar effect, if it is held in Belgrade.\n\n\"If it is held in Belgrade, it will definitely be a huge funeral -- hundreds of thousands of people will attend,\" said Mr. Markovich, who once ran for office as a democratic reformer against Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party and the even more nationalist Radical Party.\n\n\"If it takes place in Pozarevac [Mr. Milosevic's hometown] it will have only local implications, but if it's in Belgrade, it will have major national implications. It's not clear to me who will benefit the most, the Socialists or the Radicals, but their coalition is sure to grow in popularity.\""
