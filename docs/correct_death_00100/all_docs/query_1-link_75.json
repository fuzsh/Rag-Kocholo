    "text": "The non-extradition of nationals has been discarded by the EAW procedure. The military offence exemption is hardly applicable nowadays. The political offence exemption is being eroded by a depoliticizing formula. The double criminality rule has been softened by the EAW which no longer requires it for some offences, including core crimes. Blanket amnesties are being nullified by domestic Constitutional Courts in so far as they breach the duty to prosecute which was municipally sanctioned. Plea-bargains can hardly figure when core crimes are concerned. The most resilient grounds for refusal of extradition are the human rights general exceptions. The likelihood of a flagrant violation of a fair trial can block an extradition. The ne bis in idem rule can hinder an extradition on a domestic level, more than on an international level. There could be the need to consider ne bis in idem in the light of other grounds for refusal, such as amnesties and double criminality, to which it is connected. Due to its jus cogens status, the likelihood of a breach of the prohibition of torture constitutes the major impediment to an extradition request. This ground has been tested in the context of the prospect of a judicial sentence imposing life imprisonment. The infliction of the death penalty in the requesting State blocks an extradition request, more so when execution can occur after an unfair trial. A trend points to a developing exception to diplomatic privileges and immunities as grounds for refusal of extradition when core crimes are involved."
