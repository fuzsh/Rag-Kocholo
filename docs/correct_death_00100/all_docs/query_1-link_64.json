        "text": "The Chairman of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin Volodin\n\nVyacheslav Victorovich The Chairman of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of the eighth convocation. Elected in single mandate constituency № 163 (Saratov constituency - Saratov Oblast) recalled that since 1999, Washington had been doing everything to make people forget that NATO, without the UN Security Council resolution, ordered to start barbarously bombings of peaceful Belgrade and other cities of Yugoslavia.\n\n“There were 78 days of relentless attacks. Thousands of women, elderly people and children were killed. NATO troops used cluster and depleted uranium munitions. After these bombings, the number of cancer diseases in Serbia is still the highest in Europe,” the Chairman of the State Duma posted on his Telegram channel.\n\n“Washington and Brussels destroyed the country. Several years after the NATO aggression, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ceased to exist. But none of the leaders of the United States and NATO member states, including Biden, has ever been held accountable,” emphasized Vyacheslav Volodin.\n\nHe recalled that “the leader of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milošević, who tried to protect the Serbs, was arrested. And then they starved him to death in the Hague prison, unable to prove his guilt.”\n\n“Milošević asked for help, but he was denied. He wrote: “I think that the persistence, with which the medical treatment in Russia was denied, in the first place is motivated by the fear that through careful examination it would be discovered, that there were active, willful steps taken, to destroy my health, throughout the proceedings of the trial, which could not be hidden from Russian specialists,” recalled the Chairman of the State Duma.\n\n“Those who are responsible for the death of Milošević in The Hague prison have not been held accountable. The world must make a fair assessment of the events of those years: to hold accountable and sentence those who are responsible for destroying Yugoslavia,” concluded Vyacheslav Volodin."
