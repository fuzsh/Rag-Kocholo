    "text": "Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said the decision meant the funeral could take place in Serbia. Milosevic's son Marko had said he might consider a burial in Moscow unless he could be sure his mother would be safe in Belgrade. \"He should be buried in the place where he belongs, in the capital of our country, there is no discussion about that,\" Marko Milosevic told Reuters in The Hague. \"But unfortunately there are so many obstacles,\" he said. \"The priority right now is the safety and life of my mother.\"\n\nMarko and a group of Russian doctors visited the forensic institute where Dutch pathologists conducted the autopsy on Sunday. A hearse took the body from the institute to Amsterdam airport. Milosevic's family has accused the UN tribunal of murdering the former Serb strongman by refusing his request to travel to Russia for medical treatment. Moscow has expressed distrust of the Dutch investigation into Milosevic's death and sent the Russian doctors to examine the post-mortem results.\n\nOn Tuesday, the UN court that has been trying Milosevic for more than four years formally closed his trial for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. \"We express our regret at his passing. We also regret that his untimely death has deprived not only him, but indeed all interested parties of a judgment upon the allegations in the indictment,\" Presiding Judge Patrick Robinson told the court. Newspapers in Belgrade published what they said was a tribute signed by more than 30 detained war crimes suspects from former Yugoslavia to Milosevic, who presided over wars that tore the country apart.\n\nBut the lawyer for one of the signatories, Croatian general Ante Gotovina, told Reuters Gotovina had thought he was signing a private condolence message to relatives and was shocked to see it called \"a last farewell to our fellow fighter in The Hague\". A preliminary autopsy report showed Milosevic died of a heart attack. Toxicology test results are due later this week.\n\nSerbian pathologists who attended the autopsy described it as very professional, but Milosevic's lawyer said he had feared he was being poisoned. He said Milosevic wrote a letter to Russia a day before he died asking for help. \"There were active, wilful steps taken, to destroy my health, throughout the proceedings of the trial,\" Milosevic wrote in the letter. \"Those from whom I defended my own country in war are interested in me being quiet.\"\n\nA Dutch expert said blood tests taken just weeks before Milosevic died suggested the 64-year-old, faced with a possible life sentence if convicted, had knowingly taken harmful medicines to bolster his case to go to Russia for treatment. Branded the \"Butcher of the Balkans\", Milosevic was charged with 66 counts of war crimes in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo.\n\nUN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said she was furious his victims had been denied justice and said Milosevic was responsible for his own poor health. \"He was the one who decided that his state of health should deteriorate. He was secretly taking medicine,\" Del Ponte told the French newspaper Le Monde. Milosevic's brother Borislav criticised the tribunal's decision last month not to allow Milosevic to travel to Moscow for medical care and said he wanted him buried in Belgrade."
