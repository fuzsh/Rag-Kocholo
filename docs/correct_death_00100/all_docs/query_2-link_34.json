    "text": "This chapter examines the difficulties faced by the participants in the trial: judges, prosecutors, and defendant. The obstacles confronted by judges include the hybrid rules of procedure, their inexperience, their exaggerated tolerance of Milošević's behavior, and their passivity. Prosecutors made strategic errors and encountered obstacles that either lengthened the trial or weakened their case. Their “Kosovo-first” strategy did both these things, whereas their inability to develop a more assertive strategy on adjudicated facts, better manage witnesses and lengthy accusations, or win greater rights during the examination of witnesses are examples of missed procedural opportunities to shorten the trial. Milošević's behavior in the courtroom also lengthened the trial. The Chamber's recognition of his right of self-defense gave him the freedom to raise an overtly political defense. He managed to attack witnesses and cross-examine them in a way that hampered their credibility. But perhaps the most problematic difficulty connected with the Accused was his ill health, which constantly delayed the trial and ultimately contributed to its termination."
