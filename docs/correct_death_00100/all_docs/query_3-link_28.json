        "text": "THE HAGUE â€” The war crimes tribunal here said Sunday that Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugoslav president, had died of a heart attack. He was found dead in his cell Saturday.\n\nBut the day after his death, speculation remained about what might have caused the heart attack. Milosevic was believed to have taken medicines not prescribed by his physicians, including an antibiotic known to diminish or halt the effect of the medicines he was taking for his heart and blood pressure problems.\n\nThe autopsy was performed by Dutch pathologists in The Hague and two pathologists from Belgrade attended the procedure. Their report identified \"two heart conditions\" that Milosevic suffered, which they said might explain the heart attack. The results a toxicological report will be available later this week, the court said late Sunday.\n\nLawyers close to Milosevic said the autopsy could reveal substances in his blood that might have contributed to his death. But the question remains: If so, how did they get there?\n\nDuring his trial here for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide,judges were told that he seemed to be manipulating his health. Proceedings were suspended more than 20 times. While the war crimes tribunal has been embarrassed and thrown onto the defensive by Milosevic's death, however, officials were quick to dismiss suggestions earlier on Sunday that he might have been poisoned.\n\n\"He has a proven track record of taking unprescribed medicine, of messing with his medication,\" said Jean-Daniel Ruch, an adviser to the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte. \"I am not sure if we will know the full truth.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
