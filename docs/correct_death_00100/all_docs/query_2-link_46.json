        "text": "More than 15 years have elapsed since the death of Slobodan Milošević, former president of Serbia and, subsequently, of Yugoslavia, in The Hague. Western mainstream media reacted to the news with gleeful rejoicing, albeit tempered with furious annoyance that they had been denied the delightful spectacle they had been eagerly waiting for: the U.N.-established ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia handing down multiple genocide convictions on a political leader whom they had reviled for the better part of two decades.\n\nYet no sooner had the ICTY announced his sudden death than a number of troubling stories began to emerge about Milošević’s last days in the ICTY’s prison. The ICTY responded to these stories with its usual campaign of prevarication and obfuscation. As for the media, they had little interest in investigating the strange death in ICTY custody of a man whom leading NATO countries had targeted for assassination and whom they had sought to arrest and remove from Yugoslavia since the conclusion of their frustrating and largely unsuccessful 11-week bombing campaign in 1999. To the media, any coverage of the ICTY that was less than wholly adulatory was an act of lèse majesté.\n\nFrom start to finish, the ICTY controlled the investigation of Milošević’s death, not to mention the flow of information to the outside world. As always, the ICTY, though supposedly under the authority of the U.N. Security Council, was accountable to no one but itself. It was inevitable therefore that the ICTY’s public relations blitz would eventually prevail, and that we would never find out what really happened to the ICTY’s most famous prisoner. To this day, Milošević’s sudden death remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nSlobodan Milošević died on the morning of March 11, 2006, at the Scheveningen detention center—the ICTY’s own private prison—a few weeks before the expected conclusion of his trial. The cause of death appeared to be a heart attack. The ICTY responded initially by suggesting that Milošević may have taken his own life. However, by the time the ICTY published the results of its internal inquiry more than two months later, it had given up on the suicide theory. Instead, while it accepted myocardial infarction (medical term for heart attack) as the cause of death, the ICTY nonetheless insisted on blaming Milošević himself for his own death. In order to do so, it went from one convoluted theory to another, presenting almost no credible evidence in support of any of them. The ICTY’s report was of a piece with much of the rest of its work during its 25-year existence: long on rhetoric and conjecture, short on evidence, free and easy with smears and unrestrained in unsubstantiated accusations.\n\nICTY’S FIRST RESPONSE\n\nSlobodan Milošević’s death was not unexpected. He had suffered from a heart condition and high blood pressure for some time, and had been ill ever since NATO forces—in defiance of an order from the Yugoslav Constitutional Court—had abducted him and flown him to The Hague in June 2001. Since the fall of 2005, his health had visibly deteriorated. In November 2005, three medical specialists—one French, one Russian, one Serbian—examined him and warned that his condition was serious, that he had to rest for at least six weeks and that he needed to undergo tests. On Dec. 12, 2005, Milošević’s “assigned counsel”—attorneys that the ICTY had imposed on Milošević, but who worked independently of him—formally requested the ICTY trial chamber to release him provisionally so that he could receive treatment for his heart condition at the Moscow-based Bakulev Center for Cardiovascular Surgery. The treatment would take place during the upcoming Christmas recess. In addition, the Russian government sought to allay ICTY concerns by providing written guarantees that, following the prescribed course of treatment at the Bakulev center, Milošević would be returned to The Hague.\n\nThe ICTY prosecutors protested this request vehemently, filing innumerable motions in opposition, leveling all manner of accusations against Milošević and at the medical specialists who were recommending alternative, non-ICTY-sanctioned treatment. Though there had been considerable urgency to Milošević’s request given his obviously failing health, the tribunal judges, inexplicably, made no decision for more than two months. Finally, to no one’s surprise, on Feb. 23, 2006, the ICTY denied the request.\n\nMost shocking of all, in its denial of the assigned counsel’s request, the ICTY peremptorily dismissed the Russian government’s proffered guarantees. The ICTY judges essentially declared Russian promises to be worthless:\n\nThe Chamber notes that the Accused is currently in the latter stages of a very lengthy trial, in which he is charged with many serious crimes, and at the end of which, if convicted, he may face the possibility of life imprisonment. In these circumstances, and notwithstanding the guarantees of the Russian Federation and the personal undertaking of the Accused, the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that…the Accused, if released, would return for the continuation of his trial.[1]\n\nThe ICTY’s arrogance was breathtaking but entirely in keeping with its usual practice. The United Nations Security Council had created the ICTY in 1993, acting under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. Without the backing of the Russian Federation, a permanent member of the Security Council, there would have been no ICTY. The ICTY was—nominally at least—answerable to the U.N. Security Council. However, the U.N. Security Council had, from the beginning, made little effort to oversee the work of the ICTY—neither its dubious jurisprudence nor its treatment of detainees. Consequently, it should have come as no surprise that the tribunal felt it could treat one of the Security Council’s permanent members with open disdain.\n\nOn March 12, the day after Milošević’s death, the ICTY announced that preliminary autopsy results indicated that the cause of death was “myocardial infarction.” “Further,” the ICTY press release went on, “the pathologists identified two heart conditions that Slobodan Milošević suffered from, which they said would explain the myocardial infarction.”[2] The ICTY also promised a toxicological examination.\n\nOn March 17, the Dutch public prosecutor’s office released a statement, confirming that Milošević had “apparently died from a heart infarction.” Furthermore, the statement went on, the toxicological examination gave no indications of poisoning; instead, “a number of medicines prescribed for Mr. Milošević were found in the body material, but not in toxic concentration.”[3] The statement also disclosed that\n\nA request was received on Sunday, March 12 from the side of Milošević’s family to allow a Russian physician to be present during the autopsy. In view of the time passed from the moment of the decease, however, this turned out not to be possible anymore. Russian pathologists have been given the opportunity at a later time (March 14) to view the photographs of the autopsy and to study the preliminary autopsy report. Neither the Russian and Serbian pathologists nor the family have commented on the results of the autopsy.\n\nMilošević was by no means the first prisoner of the ICTY to die in its prison. His death came on the heels of the death, apparently by suicide, of former Croatian Serb leader Milan Babić. In fact, defendants have died at Scheveningen at a fairly brisk pace. In addition to Babić and Milošević, Djordje Djukić, Slavko Dokmanović, Milan Kovačević and Slobodan Praljak have died in ICTY custody with legal proceedings against them still pending.\n\nThe ICTY responded to Milošević’s death the same way it had to the deaths of the other inmates. Whenever the ICTY’s media-tailored reputation for fairness and humaneness threatened to unravel, anonymous sources from within the bowels of the tribunal would put out one story after another, leaking highly selective tidbits from various “internal” documents to cast the tribunal in the best possible light and the recently deceased in the worst possible light. Thus, within hours of Milošević’s death, the ICTY was suggesting, via the usual embedded journalists, that it was the former Yugoslav leader, and he alone, who was responsible for his own death. Even as the ICTY was promising a full—internal, naturally—inquiry into the circumstances of Milošević’s death, it was anticipating the outcome of such an inquiry by telling the world that the ICTY had done nothing for which it could be blamed; that, to the contrary, it had provided first-rate, world-class medical care; and that it had behaved with impeccable professionalism and bend-over-backward generosity.\n\n“The tribunal has nothing to be blamed for,” ICTY spokesman Christian Chartier was reported as saying on March 11. “The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia takes the utmost care of its indictees and of [Milošević] in particular.”[4] In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Reppublica, Carla del Ponte, the ICTY’s chief prosecutor declared, “Conditions of detention in Scheveningen prison are absolutely the best that anyone could possibly imagine. No-one has ever complained. On the contrary, the detainees themselves recognize the enormous amount of positive attention lavished on them.”[5]\n\nNo one has ever complained? Well, Milošević complained, though it didn’t do him much good, since his complaints were routinely ignored. Serb nationalist leader Vojislav Seselj also complained. He complained that he had had to wait three months for routine intestinal surgery; it didn’t do Seselj much good either. “Is this how General Djordje Djukić, Dr. Milan Kovačević, General Momir Talić and Slavko Dokmanović were killed?” Seselj asked.[6] “They all died because they did not receive medical assistance on time.”\n\nOthers also complained. Following the death of Milan Kovačević, his lawyer, Dušan Vučićević, accused the ICTY of negligence, claiming that his client had “bled to death because of errors by the prison staff.” He said that prison staff had initially ignored Kovačević’s cries of pain. Then, according to a New York Times report,\n\nWhen the prison doctor arrived an hour later, the lawyer contends, the doctor misdiagnosed Dr. Kovačević’s crisis as a kidney problem and gave him a painkiller instead of rushing him to the nearby hospital. The lawyer said the autopsy had shown that Dr. Kovačević had not died of a heart attack but of a ruptured major blood vessel in his abdomen, which could have been repaired surgically…. In February, the hospital had found that Dr. Kovačević had an aneurysm, or widening, of a major blood vessel in the abdomen. “That aneurysm was never treated,” the lawyer said. “It was like a time bomb ticking in his body. We repeatedly asked for treatment.”[7]\n\nIt was not surprising, therefore, that, in the aftermath of Milošević’s death, ICTY officials could feel confident that any story they came up with, no matter how little sense it made, would encounter little challenge.\n\nSure enough, on March 17, Judge Fausto Pocar, the tribunal’s president, announced,\n\nI have full confidence in the professionalism of the Detention Unit’s Commanding Officer and his staff. This has been confirmed by thorough and frequent inspections of the U.N. Detention Unit by highly respected independent bodies. They have consistently reported that conditions in the Detention Unit are of the very highest standard.\n\nPocar also declared, “I met this week with a team of Russian pathologists who reviewed the autopsy report and informed me that in their view the procedure was conducted at the highest level and they were in full agreement with the results. I am informed that the Serbian pathologists hold the same view.”\n\nThis was strange, for, as we have seen, according to the Dutch public prosecutor’s office, “Neither the Russian and Serbian pathologists nor the family have commented on the results of the autopsy.” Moreover, in a subsequent letter to Pocar, Marko Milošević, the former president’s son, disclosed, “Should I mention the fact that the autopsy was conducted without the presence of the independent expert team sent by our family, even though we insisted on it? Or that the Russian doctors were denied the access to the body and the tissue samples? Or that we have been denied his blood samples?”[8]\n\nICTY self-congratulations in the days following Milošević’s death were naturally echoed in media that had for years served as its public-relations agency. Typically effusive was the BBC’s Chris Stephen who declared Scheveningen to be “world’s most luxurious prison, more a hotel than a jailhouse….A doctor is on permanent standby, along with a nurse and a psychologist, and several Dutch hospitals—among the world’s most advanced—are within minutes of the prison gates.”[9] (Stephen cited no sources for these extravagant claims.) Stephen, though ostensibly reporting for the BBC, was in reality an ICTY lobbyist of long standing posing as a “journalist.” He wrote for the Observer about the Balkans while employed by the Institute for War & Peace Reporting, a body closely tied to the ICTY, funded by many of the same sources and staffed by many of the same people. Stephen could barely contain himself as he continued with his rhapsodies. “Officials say many prisoners leave the jail healthier than when they arrived…. [M]eals are carefully balanced and exercise is encouraged.” There is a “Comfort Room” which—nudge, nudge, wink, wink—”contains a bed and is reserved for conjugal visits, though whether Mr Milošević ever made use of it, during the visits of his wife Mira Markovic, is a closely guarded secret.” That “officials” may have self-interested reasons to lie obviously never occurred to this “journalist.”\n\n“There is a reason for all this comfort,” Stephen’s ode to Scheveningen continued. “[W]hen the prison was designed, the court’s first president, Antonio Cassese, was determined to press home the idea that inmates are innocent until proven guilty. Once an inmate is found guilty, he is sent to another prison in a volunteering U.N. nation. No decision had been taken on where to send Mr Milošević.”\n\n“Where to send Mr. Milošević”! Like most “reporters” covering the ICTY, Stephen had made its ethos his own. Sentence first, verdict afterwards, to quote the Queen of Hearts in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. Neither Stephen nor his editors at the BBC saw any contradiction between his initial “innocent until proven guilty” claim and his later reference to “where to send” Milošević after his inevitable conviction.\n\nStephen also slipped the odd falsehood or two into his report for good measure. “Suicide has been a problem at the jail,” he said. What’s the reason for that? “There are no cameras inside the cells, as it is a remand centre.” No cameras inside the cells? That’s odd. Rule 39 of the ICTY’s Rules of Detention explicitly states:\n\nIn order to protect the health or the safety of the detainee, the Registrar…may order that the cell of the detainee be monitored by video surveillance equipment for a period not exceeding thirty days. Renewals which shall not exceed a period of thirty days shall be reported to the President.\n\nMoreover, it had been widely reported in the media that Milošević was kept under 24-hour video surveillance when he arrived at The Hague and for some time afterward. In fact, it’s not known when, if at all, this surveillance ended.\n\nStephen’s assertions were, not surprisingly, quickly shown to be absurd. Following Milošević’s death, the ICTY invited the Swedish government to send a team of penologists to carry out an audit of Scheveningen. Inadequate and superficial though the Swedes’ audit was (their visit lasted only three days, and much of their brief report was taken up by mind-numbingly tedious descriptions of the detention unit bureaucracy), they nonetheless didn’t come away quite as thrilled by the prison as the BBC’s man. The Swedes described the “Comfort Room” as “shabby and downright unpleasant.”[10] They also made a point of mentioning the poor quality of the food and the insufficient time prisoners were permitted to spend in the fresh air.\n\nAccording to the Swedish group’s calculations, something like two-thirds of the people detained at Scheveningen have not been convicted of anything. “At the time of our visit,” they revealed, “half the inmates had been in custody for at least three years. The detainee of longest standing had been there for 8½ years.” This, incidentally, was the finding of a group that was favorably disposed toward the ICTY. In sending the penologists to The Hague, the Swedish government openly demonstrated which side it was on by declaring, “Sweden has attached great importance to the ICTY and its struggle against impunity for those people who committed crimes in the former Yugoslavia.”\n\nICTY IN A DILEMMA\n\nMilošević’s death had put the ICTY in a bind. Milošević was its most famous prisoner. He had been head of state—first of Serbia, then of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia—for 13 years. He was, in the ICTY’s telling, the architect of all the evils that had befallen Yugoslavia. And now he was dead. If the ICTY were now to argue that Milošević had been seriously ill for some time and that his death was not unexpected, then it would have to explain why it had continued his exhausting trial for four years; why it had allowed the prosecution to mount a vast, unwieldy, incomprehensible—even, as it turned out, to the Milošević judges—case spanning more than 10 years of Yugoslav history and three wars; and, above all, why it had refused to permit Milošević to receive the recommended medical treatment.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the ICTY were to argue that Milošević wasn’t really that ill and that its doctors had certified him to be in pretty good shape, then it would have to explain his sudden death.\n\nIf the ICTY were to claim that Milošević had committed suicide, then it would have to come up with some proof: a suicide note perhaps or testimony from friends or fellow-detainees suggesting that Milošević was discussing or contemplating suicide. Nothing like that was available. No suicide note. And people who had spoken to Milošević during his last days described him as optimistic and in fighting spirit.\n\nYet, within hours of his death, Carla del Ponte was indeed floating the possibility of suicide. In that same La Reppublica, interview, she said,\n\nHe [Milošević] may well have thrown down the final gauntlet in our faces…. The trial was drawing to a close. He had only 40 hours’ worth of courtroom time in which to finish questioning his witnesses for the defence. Then it would have been the prosecution’s turn once again and I would have delivered my final speech. The trial would have been over before the summer. According to our assessment, it would have ended with a sentence of life imprisonment. Perhaps he wanted to avoid all of that.[11]\n\nHowever, the Dutch forensic report, which said that no toxins had been found in Milošević’s body, pretty much closed off the suicide option. Any suggestion that Milošević may have taken a poison that left no traces would have redounded against the ICTY. It was the ICTY that controlled and monitored Milošević’s medication intake; it would have been far better placed than he to find and administer a toxin that left no traces.\n\nThe possibility that Milošević may have been murdered was dismissed with the superficially plausible argument that the ICTY and the NATO countries wanted to see Milošević convicted, not dead. Why would they have gone to the trouble of putting him on trial if it wasn’t to convict him and thereby to provide a post facto justification for NATO’s decade-long destruction of, and war against, Yugoslavia? Indeed, following his death, NATO government officials wailed interminably to the effect that, by dying before the judges could bring in their guilty verdict, the ceaselessly-reviled “Butcher of the Balkans” had escaped justice.\n\nThis argument however overlooked an important point. Milošević’s trial had not gone well for the prosecutors. They had presented a weak case, and his conviction would have convinced only those who were already convinced of his guilt. Critics of the ICTY would have had a field-day picking apart and ridiculing the trial judgment and, subsequently, the appellate court judgment. The cause of Milošević had already attracted the support of a number of high-profile lawyers, journalists, intellectuals and activists. Milošević’s living in a prison cell in NATOland, would have been a rallying point for NATO’s critics.\n\nICTY’S PROBLEMS BEGIN TO MOUNT\n\nThe ICTY faced a number of near-insurmountable problems in the aftermath of the Yugoslav president’s death. First, there was the Nov. 4, 2005, report from the specialists, expressing serious concern about the medical treatment Milošević had been receiving at the ICTY. Milošević’s deteriorating health had been apparent to anyone but the willfully obtuse. On top of his high blood pressure, he had complained of hearing problems and buzzing in his head. A couple of times, he had even left the courtroom complaining of ill health and—extremely unusually for him—had allowed the trial to continue in his absence. The specialists’ joint opinion was:\n\n[T]he state of health of the patient is not stable and that complications are possible. Such a state of health requires further tests with the aim of identifying the origin or origins of the current difficulties. It is therefore necessary to propose to the patient a period of rest, i.e. the suspension of all physical and psychological activities for a period of a minimum of 6 weeks which would probably help diminish the symptoms or at least to stabilize them and then approve additional indispensable diagnostic procedures in order to prescribe a more appropriate therapy.\n\nOne of the specialists, Margaret Shumilina of the Bakulev Center, said that Milošević may be showing “initial signs of more serious cerebral circulatory disorders.” Another, Vukasin Andrić, an ear, nose and throat specialist from Serbia, wrote that Milošević’s hearing was rapidly deteriorating, probably caused by his heart condition. The ICTY’s response to the specialists’ recommendations was outright hostility, bordering on fury. “Are you deaf?” presiding Judge Patrick Robinson infamously barked on Nov. 15, 2005, seeking to silence Milošević after he had alerted the trial chamber to the independent physicians’ report. It was a particularly spiteful comment, given that Milošević’s most recent complaints had involved his deteriorating hearing, which may well have been caused by his cardiac condition. Judge Iain Bonomy wrote on Nov. 15 that the medical opinion of Andrić, the ear, nose and throat specialist from Serbia, was of no value because he had been a defense witness. It was inappropriate, Bonomy piously declared,\n\nfor the Trial Chamber to be asked to take into account the views of Professor [Vukasin] Andric. The Trial Chamber’s first and foremost consideration must always be to ensure a fair trial of the Accused. It should not countenance the risk that a situation could develop in which its impartiality, and hence the fairness of the trial, might be put in question. The Trial Chamber should not be placed in the position where it may have to assess the reliability of a witness in a context unrelated to his evidence in the case prior to having to evaluate that evidence. Issues relating to the management of the trial process should be dealt with through the assistance of experts who are not involved as witnesses of fact in the case.\n\nBonomy went on, “Whenever issues of health or fitness arise in a court process it is vital that the right decision is made at the end of a thorough and scrupulously objective assessment of the issues on the basis of the opinions of experts who are not involved in the trial.” This verbiage failed to explain why either Andrić’s testimony as a fact witness, or his diagnosis as a treating specialist, was compromised.\n\nBonomy’s concern about a possible conflict of interest was extraordinary in light of the ICTY’s usual blasé attitude toward members of the prosecution staff testifying as prosecution witnesses, indeed even as expert witnesses. To mention one example of many, in June 2002, prosecution witness Frederick Abrahams of Human Rights Watch frankly admitted that he had “conducted research and provided analysis for the Kosovo indictment against Slobodan Milošević.” Judge Richard May dismissed any suggestion that there might be a conflict of interest: The “fact that he worked on this particular indictment does not make his evidence inadmissible.”[12] A political activist such as Abrahams was clearly far more trustworthy than a professional physician offering a professional diagnosis. Wisely, Bonomy, though happy to cast aspersions on Andrić, evinced little interest in cross-examining him.\n\nMoreover, Bonomy’s punctiliousness and demand for scrupulous objectivity when it came to medical diagnoses stood in stark contrast to his and his fellow-judges’ rush in September 2004 to impose counsel on Milošević, who had hitherto represented himself. The ICTY justified its imposition of counsel on the ground that Milošević was allegedly too sick to act on his own behalf. It based its decision on the medical diagnosis of its own handpicked specialist, Dr. Rene Tavernier. According to Tavernier, Milošević was “not fit to represent himself”[13] but not too sick to stand trial. Tavernier revealed his good faith with his observation, “If Mr Milošević would continue to represent himself this will delay the progress of the trial significantly.” One would have thought a medical doctor’s chief concern is the wellbeing of his patient, not with the “progress” of some trial in which he was not involved. But then everyone associated with the ICTY has always been determined to push the ICTY agenda.\n\nWhen Milošević sought a second opinion to challenge that of Tavernier, ICTY prosecutors protested that there was no need for any further examinations because Milošević had left his challenge to Tavernier too late. The judges agreed, refused to permit a second opinion and swiftly imposed an attorney on Milošević. It was hard to understand how Milošević’s challenge could have been too late since the court had only just decided to impose an attorney. Moreover, the ICTY had been unable to cite any precedent of a court’s denying a defendant the right to self-representation on grounds of ill health. And the ICTY based its decision on the opinion of one doctor, someone who hadn’t even been Milošević’s treating physician.\n\nHowever, let’s return to the independent specialists’ report. The ICTY trial chamber’s first response to the report was to turn to the detention unit doctors to ask for their appraisal. Needless to say, they dismissed any criticism of their treatment. On Nov. 14, the detention unit’s resident doctor, Paulus Falke, wrote to Hans Holthuis, the ICTY registrar, citing N.J.M. Aarts, the Dutch ear, nose and throat specialist who had been treating Milošević for two months. Aarts, according to Falke, had said that Milošević’s hearing loss was “commensurate with someone of his age.” “Contrary to the joint conclusion of the Visiting Doctors,” Falke went on, “the treating specialist concludes that that it is unlikely that the vascular abnormalities have a direct relationship with the symptoms complained of. The treating specialist states that a period of rest will have no positive effect upon his symptoms.”\n\nOn Dec. 6, Aarts added, “The atherosclerosis is normal in view of the patient’s age….The MRI shows an image of both cerebral hemispheres which is normal for his age. There is no pathological atrophy.”\n\nMilošević’s treating cardiologist at the ICTY, Paul van Dijkman, wrote to Falke on Nov. 23, saying\n\nThe patient has no cardiac complaints whatsoever, in particular no chest pains or shortness of breath.….In general, the blood pressure is acceptable, and even the strain in the ECG is somewhat less pronounced. Clearly, the trial sessions are so stressful that the blood pressure increases, together with the heart rate….In view of the current work schedule, it is understandable that the patient feels fatigued. He has three court sessions per week, and spends the rest of the time preparing for them, including interviewing witnesses. There is not much time for rest. It is predictable that the blood pressure will increase again during stressful trial sessions. As in the past, I strongly advise provision for sufficient rest. On the other hand, it seems to me that a six week rest period is somewhat too much.\n\nThe six-week rest that the specialists recommended, van Dijkman wrote further on Dec. 1, was an “arbitrarily chosen period, for which in my view, no firm reasons were given.” So there was no need for undue concern. Whatever Miloševic was suffering from, it was all perfectly normal for a man of his age. Maybe he was overworking.\n\nVan Dijkman’s comment was baffling. Why did he consider six weeks be too long? How much would have been enough? His comment hardly suggested overwhelming concern for the health of his patient. Van Dijkman’s generally optimistic diagnosis, at least as far as Milošević’s cardiac condition was concerned, was noteworthy in that a little more than a year earlier, he had happily endorsed Tavernier’s assessment that Milošević “was not fit enough to defend himself”[14]! Now Milošević was apparently in such fine fettle that even six weeks’ rest was more than he needed. “Soon the Christmas recess will start,” said Van Dijkman. “Mr. Milošević will be able to get some rest also in this period, which comes very close to the period of rest of six weeks as recommended by the three physicians.”\n\nWell, not exactly. The specialists had recommended a total rest of six weeks, not six weeks of trial preparation.\n\nThe ICTY of course refused to follow the outside specialists’ recommendations either on sanctioning further tests or on permitting a period of rest. But now, in March 2006, Milošević was dead and, despite the standard encomia to the tribunal offered by the likes of the BBC’s Chris Smith, some mainstream media were starting to raise questions. They didn’t care very much about Milošević, but the trial’s unsatisfactory conclusion was leading to growing grumbling. Stories about the specialists’ recommendations and the ICTY’s dismissive attitude toward them had begun to circulate. Referring to Dr. Leo Bokeria, head of the Bakulev Center in Moscow, where Milošević had sought treatment, the New York Times wrote:\n\nBokeria, a Russian heart specialist, who flew to The Hague to review the autopsy records…suggested that Mr. Milošević had died from undetected blockages in his coronary arteries. ‘Two stents’ could have saved his life and given him ‘many long years,’ he said, according to the Itar-Tass news agency, referring to tubes placed in arteries to reopen blockages.[15]\n\nAn AFP report had Bokeria claiming that “appropriate tests ‘would have shown the levels of narrowing of the vessels….The problem could have been resolved in dozens of countries in the world, and if Milošević had received help he would still be alive.’ ”[16] Also, Florence Leclercq, the third of the three specialists who had examined Milošević, was quoted as saying, “His medical condition was not good, so we asked for additional tests to evaluate his cardiac situation. But these investigations were never performed, and now that’s a problem.”[17] Apparently, “Prison officials assured her that some cardiac tests, like an ultrasound, had been done and were ‘normal,’ but they could not show her the actual test results, leaving her to conclude that more was needed.”[18]\n\nThen there was Dr. Patrick Barriot, a “French doctor who frequently visited Mr. Milošević,” who said that Milošević “suffered symptoms of increasingly severe high blood pressure in the six months before his death, including headaches, visual changes and a constant thrumming noise in his ear…. ‘Each time I saw him, he was clearly deteriorating, more and more tired.’ ” Andrić was quoted as saying, “What was shocking was that in four years lots of tests and exams on his heart had never been done.”\n\nThat outside specialists were openly telling the media that they did not think the ICTY had provided adequate medical care to Milošević was embarrassing enough. Even more awkward to explain away was the ICTY’s refusal, barely more than two weeks before his death, to permit Milošević to receive treatment in Moscow for his heart condition. On Dec. 12, 2005, Milošević had asked the court to allow him to go to the Bakulev Center. “It would not affect your programme in any way,” Milošević explained, “because I would be back here again before this is resumed in accordance with your programme, so I’m asking you to make this possible for me for health reasons. I don’t see any hindrance in the way of this because it really would not disturb your programme in any way.”[19]\n\nThat same day, Bokeria wrote a letter to Judge Fausto Pocar, the ICTY president, in which he declared that Milošević “is in a critical condition” and urged immediate treatment at the Bakulev center:\n\nI consider that it is my physician and human being duty to insist on immediate interruption lawsuit for the ministration to Slobodan Miloshevich high quality diagnostic and long time, not less than 1.5-2 months aethiopathogenic curative treatment in a specialized cardiovascular profile hospital. [I am ready] to do everything maximally possible for preventing him from cardiovascular catastrophe.\n\nOn Dec. 20, 2005, Milošević’s “assigned counsel” made an application to the court for Milošević’s provisional release to enable him to get treatment in Moscow. They pointed out that “the Accused’s current condition was neither originally discovered, nor treated appropriately, by the Registry-approved doctors and consultants.” The specialists who examined Milošević in November had “determined that the Accused’s treatment was inadequate.” Moreover, the ICTY’s prison doctor Falke’s Nov. 11, 2005, response to the specialists’ report “neither addressed nor diagnosed the problems complained of by the Accused, noted by the team of visiting specialists.”\n\nThe assigned counsel made two requests: First, they asked for Milošević’s temporary release in order to get treatment in Moscow. Second,\n\nin the event that the trial chamber is not satisfied as to the current condition of the Accused, the Assigned Counsel request the Trial Chamber to hear evidence from the relevant specialists in order to determine (a) the nature of the Accused’s condition and (b) the most appropriate method of treatment.\n\nClearly, the assigned counsel were anticipating both the prosecutors’ likely fierce attack and the judges’ probable rejection of their request. To ensure that the ICTY didn’t get off the hook, the assigned counsel, in effect, challenged the judges either to show that Milošević wasn’t really ill or to come up with an alternative treatment program. Thus, their warning: Accept or reject the specialists’ diagnoses and criticisms, but don’t ignore them! Needless to say, neither the trial chamber’s Feb. 23, 2006, rejection of the request nor the ICTY’s final report on Milošević’s death addressed, or even acknowledged, the existence of the assigned counsel’s second request. The judges held no hearings with the specialists.\n\nOn Dec. 22, 2005, Geoffrey Nice, chief prosecutor during the Milošević trial, responded to the assigned counsel’s request by declaring, as he had done many times before, that Milošević wasn’t really ill—he was merely reacting to the accumulation of damaging evidence against him. “On 4 November 2005, the Accused was examined by a group of specialists instructed by him, who made unsolicited recommendations as to the future conduct of the trial,” Nice wrote. The word “instructed” suggested the specialists were taking instructions from Milošević and clearly impugned their integrity. As for “unsolicited” recommendations, well, Milošević had solicited them, as he was entitled to do in accordance with the ICTY’s own rules of detention. Rule 31 says, “Detainees may consult a doctor or dentist of their choice at their own expense…. The Commanding Officer shall not refuse a request for such consultations without reasonable grounds.”\n\nIt was all part of Milošević’s strategy, Nice explained, “aimed at preventing the trial from being brought to a timely conclusion.” Therefore, “control of these proceedings needs to be taken on the basis that this underlying strategy may or does lie behind every application of a procedural nature.” The court should, first, “find out what the true medical position is….There has been no definitive findings as to the Accused’s true medical condition, what treatment he requires and what the outcome of any treatment may be.” Second, the court “should proceed on the basis that this trial must go ahead as scheduled…with or without the Accused present in court.” Without the Accused present in court? When you are serving humanity, protecting human rights is the least of your concerns.\n\nAmusingly, Nice berated Milošević for relying “upon his own medical experts, who have second-guessed the court’s appointed specialists and provided reports of their own.” Nice made this complaint in the same motion in which he demanded “full access” to Milošević’s medical records as well as “facilities to allow examination of the Accused by the Prosecution’s own medical experts.” Nice justified this request by saying that Milošević had “attempted to take this matter out of the Chamber’s hands. His medical condition is now being presented as an adversarial issue.” But it was Nice himself who had made Milošević’s health as an “adversarial issue.” It was Nice who had alleged that Milošević was faking ill health in order to derail the trial. Already back in Sept. 30, 2003, Nice had demanded access to Milošević’s medical reports. Back then, the presiding judge, Richard May, had rejected his request, saying, “We cannot have a party second guessing the Court’s doctors. It’s quite out of—quite out of all proportion and propriety.”\n\nIn his new motion, Nice made the pitch that eventually was to form the basis of the court’s rejection of the release request. “There is no evidence to support a finding that the Accused requires medical treatment that cannot be provided in The Hague. If he wishes to be treated by specialists from Russia, then there may be no good reason why they may not treat him, alongside Dutch specialists, in The Hague.” Nice cited no medical or scientific opinion to support this claim. And, he continued,\n\nThere is no reason to believe that once in Russia, the Accused might not then be found unfit to travel for the purposes of return….The Accused has done all he can to thwart the proper functioning of this trial. He does not recognize or respect this court in any legal or substantive way. He has repeatedly refused to recognize the legitimacy of this Tribunal….The Accused’s attitude has stretched, not infrequently, to offensiveness to officials in the courtroom, well evinced by his referring to the Trial Chamber as part of a joint criminal enterprise.\n\nNow, Milošević, unlike Nice or the judges, had been nothing if not polite to his courtroom adversaries. What Nice referred to as offensiveness was clearly a matter of serious difference of opinion on international law and was a key part of Milošević’s defense: that his trial by a NATO-financed, NATO-staffed and NATO-run court served to provide a post facto justification for NATO’s unprovoked aggression against Yugoslavia.\n\nThen Nice declared, “No application for provisional release should even be entertained by the Trial Chamber unless the Accused first provides a personal guarantee recognizing the legality and legitimacy of the Tribunal, agreeing to submit to its jurisdiction, and undertaking to return. No such personal guarantee from this Accused could now ever be credible.” This was mind-boggling. Milošević had to renounce his beliefs, and essentially the basis of his defense, in order for the ICTY to permit him to receive medical treatment. However, even that would be no good because nothing Milošević said could possibly be believed.\n\nA personal guarantee from Milošević wouldn’t be worth the paper it was written on. And a guarantee from Russia wouldn’t be worth much more:\n\nIn the event that guarantees are provided by the Russian Federation, the Prosecution will argue that they do not provide sufficient assurance to the Trial Chamber that the authorities of the Russian Federation will arrest the Accused if he violates any of the conditions of his release.\n\nIt was clear that the prosecution would oppose Milošević’s application for provisional release, no matter what medical diagnosis was proffered or what guarantees issued. Significantly, despite Nice and del Ponte’s demands for more and more documentation about Milošević’s condition, they had singularly failed to challenge the diagnoses either of the independent specialists or of the Russian doctors. This didn’t stop del Ponte on Jan. 20, 2006, from asserting that the Russian Bokeria had failed to show that Miloševic could only “undergo the diagnostic treatments recommended, or any other treatment, in the Bakoulev Scientific Centre.” And, in any case, even if he did, he had failed to show that the center was “in a position to provide any security to the Accused to prevent his absconding.” Moreover, while the Russian Federation may have guaranteed that it would “provide security for Mr. Slobodan Milošević” at the Bakoulev center, it had not offered “any guarantees as to what security may be provided at the centre.”\n\nMuch as Nice had done, del Ponte disputed that any deterioration in Milošević’s condition had taken place. Del Ponte said that the application for provisional release failed to offer any evidence “to support a conclusive finding as to: 1) What alternative treatment may be required, if any, for the cardiovascular or any other condition. 2) Any link between the Accused’s hearing disorder and cardiovascular condition. 3) Any deterioration in the Accused’s cardiovascular condition.”\n\nFinally, she declared,\n\nthe relief sought (release to a medical centre in Moscow) is manifestly disproportionate to its target (an amelioration in the Accused’s medical condition). There is no evidence to support a finding that treatment in Moscow as opposed to The Hague is necessary. There is no evidence to support a finding that the recommended diagnostic treatment, at the very least, may not be provided in The Hague, and that diagnoses may not be made, by the Accused’s own medical experts if necessary, with the Accused in detention in The Hague….There is…insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that the Accused’s present treatment is anything other than appropriate.\n\nDel Ponte concluded by asserting, “the guarantees provided by the Russian Federation do not provide sufficient assurance to the Trial Chamber that the authorities of the Russian Federation will arrest the Accused if he violates any of the conditions of his release.” As for Milošević’s signed guarantee that he would return, it was not credible since Milošević “does not recognize the legitimacy of this Tribunal. Defiance of the Tribunal may be seen by some in Serbia and in the Russian Federation to be an heroic act. That is the environment in which this specious undertaking is given”\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2006, the prosecutors upped the ante, and revived a charge they had made before, though without having provided much in the way of evidence, namely, that Milošević was self-medicating. He was doing so, moreover, with the supposed connivance of the medical experts who had examined him on Nov. 4. The experts may have “advised the Accused on how to defeat his medical regime, or alternatively that they have all been misled by him.” Prosecutor Nice suggested that the Russian Federation be told of Milošević’s manipulation of his health, because it\n\nmay lead the Federation to review and revoke its guarantees….How could any state offer guarantees about its ability to care for, or supervise the custody of a man against whom there is evidence of a determination to act contrary to medical advice?….The Russian Federation would…be horrified at the prospect of having the Accused in its custody and for him so to abuse his medical regime as to lose his life whilst in their custody, or to render himself so ill as to make return to The Hague impossible.\n\nRather menacingly, Nice asserted that “the Accused’s willful manipulation of his health provides further grounds for refusing the application for provisional release in that the Chamber will not be in a position to monitor what is now a stated and obvious risk: that the Accused may take his own life.” So there we have it: Nice was warning, a little more than a month before Milošević’s death, that he may commit suicide.\n\nICTY REJECTS PRESCRIBED COURSE OF TREATMENT\n\nThe ICTY’s Feb. 23, 2006, rejection of the assigned counsel’s provisional release request was no surprise. What was a surprise was the feebleness of the ICTY’s reasoning. As was often the case at the ICTY, the judges’ arguments amounted to little more than a regurgitation of the prosecutors’ arguments. Why it had taken the judges more than two months to reach their decision remained inexplicable.\n\nThe ICTY’s reasoning was as follows: First, Milošević had failed to show that he couldn’t receive in Holland the treatment that he would receive in Russia. According to the court,\n\nAssigned Counsel have made no real attempt to demonstrate that the Accused’s medical needs cannot be met in the Netherlands. The Chamber considers that an application for provisional release on medical grounds cannot be granted unless such a showing is made. In this regard, the Trial Chamber accepts the submission of the Prosecution, that if the Accused wishes to be treated by specialists who are not from the Netherlands, such physicians may come here to treat him.[20]\n\nSecond, the ICTY couldn’t accept either Milošević’s written undertaking to return to The Hague after treatment or the Russian government’s commitment to deliver him there. Menacingly, not to say sadistically, the judges wrote:\n\nThe Chamber notes that the Accused is currently in the latter stages of a very lengthy trial, in which he is charged with many serious crimes, and at the end of which, if convicted, he may face the possibility of life imprisonment. In these circumstances, and notwithstanding the guarantees of the Russian Federation and the personal undertaking of the Accused, the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that…the Accused, if released, would return for the continuation of his trial.[21]\n\nBoth of the grounds proffered were legally outrageous. How does one prove that one can’t receive medical treatment in one place as good as the one somewhere else? As is its wont, the ICTY had shifted the burden of proof onto Milošević. It was a burden inherently impossible to meet. How can one prove there isn’t a hospital or a clinic somewhere in Holland that could treat Milošević? It was surely up to the prosecutors to show that Milošević could—and, more important, would—receive treatment in The Hague as good and as timely as the one on offer in Moscow. It was up to the prosecutors and the court to demonstrate that the Bakulev Center specialists would be able to travel to Holland, spend an extensive period of time there, take time away from their other patients, bring the requisite supporting staff with them, have all the necessary medical equipment at their disposal, have the resources to pay for all of this and count on the full cooperation of Dutch hospitals and doctors.\n\nMoreover, if the ICTY judges had really wanted to know what kind of treatment the Moscow doctors proposed, and whether it would be available in The Hague, they could at any time have asked the doctors to come to The Hague and testify about this. Or they could have asked for written submissions. Then the judges could have asked the ICTY doctors or other Dutch medical experts to respond. Instead, the court dawdled for two months, doing very little other than entertaining various dark prosecutorial claims that Milošević was undermining his health and requesting to see more and more of Milošević’s medical records.\n\nAs for the ICTY’s second reason for rejecting Milošević’s request, its outrageous and entirely inappropriate reference to Milošević’s facing the “possibility of life imprisonment,” it was no reason at all, merely typical ICTY arrogant bluster. The ICTY never felt it had any obligations toward anyone, not even the obligation of courtesy. The ICTY was openly calling the government of the Russian Federation untrustworthy. It had forgotten that, without the support of Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, there would have been no ICTY. In addition, the ICTY was being profoundly dishonest. It had insisted on written pledges from Milošević and the Russian government that he would return to The Hague after treatment. Then, when the written pledges duly arrived, the judges announced that they didn’t believe them. It was hard to avoid the conclusion that, in requesting these written commitments, the ICTY was simply cynically running out the clock.\n\nThe same trial chamber that, 18 months earlier, had invoked Milošević’s poor health to justify its decision to take away his right to represent himself just as he was about to begin presenting his defense, now made light of his health condition to justify its decision to deny him the medical treatment he sought.\n\nThe ICTY’s decision, though cruel and cynical, was not without lawyerly cunning. The court could have ruled that it suspected that Milošević was a hypochondriac and that he was using his health in order to evade justice. However, such a claim should not have been too hard to prove. The judges could have rounded up a few medical specialists, ordered a fresh examination and asked them point-blank: Was Milošević a malingerer? Armed with the doctors’ determination, the court would then have been able to speed up the trial or, once again, to impose an attorney. But this option was fraught with so much risk that it was a non-starter. After all, the ICTY’s own doctors had diagnosed Milošević to be very sick. It was the ICTY’s doctors who, a little more than a year earlier, had advised that Milošević was too sick to conduct his own defense. If the ICTY were now to empanel another set of doctors, there was a real possibility that they might come back and say, yes, Milošević needs intensive treatment and a long rest. The doctors might even recommend that the trial be postponed indefinitely.\n\nThe alternative was also perilous. The judges could have granted Milošević’s request to go to the Bakulev clinic in Moscow. The ICTY didn’t seriously believe that the Russian government would renege on its commitments to return Milošević to The Hague. The ICTY was concerned about something else. Delaying the trial and thus delaying the much-anticipated guilty verdict risked provoking a massive outpouring of indignation in the media and from well-connected NATO political figures that the Milošević trial was taking too long and that the former president was receiving too many favors from a U.N. court. The ICTY had already become visibly uncomfortable in the face of growing criticism that the Milošević case appeared to be dragging on forever.\n\nFor some time now, the Milošević trial judges had been itching to move things along and to bring in their verdict. On Nov. 22, 2005, just one week after Milošević alerted the judges to the independent physicians’ report about his deteriorating health, the judges suggested that the Kosovo indictment be severed from the other indictments and that that part of the trial be concluded right away. A speedy (guilty) verdict on the Kosovo charges could then have been brought in to give the ICTY, NATO and, above all, the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom—then embroiled in the growing carnage in Iraq—a much-needed boost. However, both Milošević and the prosecution (for very different reasons) protested vigorously and, on Dec. 12, the judges were forced to abandon the idea.\n\nFacing unappealing choices, the Milošević judges decided to do nothing, and dressed this up in a lot of lawyerly obfuscation. They neither claimed that Milošević was a faker, nor ordered a new medical examination, nor permitted him to be treated by the Russian specialists nor asserted, as Carla del Ponte claimed they did, that “everything that Milošević needed was being offered to him in the prison in The Hague.” Instead, they asked Milošević to try to prove the unprovable—namely, that he couldn’t get the treatment he needed in the Netherlands, as if he had ever been offered such treatment. By doing so, the court shifted responsibility for his worsening condition, not to mention possible death, onto its prisoner.\n\nTHE STRANGE RIFAMPICIN TALE\n\nWorse was yet to come for the ICTY. Within days of his death, it emerged that Milošević had written a letter to the Russian foreign ministry, voicing his suspicion that the ICTY was poisoning him. In the letter dated March 8 (three days before his death), Milošević disclosed that a day earlier he had been notified\n\nthat on January 12th (i.e. two months ago), an extremely strong drug was found in my blood, which is used, as they themselves say, for the treatment of tuberculosis and leprosy, although I never used any kind of antibiotic during this 5 years that I’m in their prison. Throughout this whole period, neither have I had any kind of infectious illness (apart from flu). Also the fact that doctors needed 2 months (to report to me) can’t have any other explanation than we are facing manipulation. In any case, those who foist on me a drug against leprosy surely can’t treat my illness; likewise those from which I defended my country in times of war and who have an interest to silence me.\n\nSubsequent news reports identified the “extremely strong drug” to which Milošević had referred as Rifampicin. Milošević’s letter raised two very tricky issues for the ICTY. Why was there Rifampicin in his blood? And—even more mysterious—if the tests were conducted on Jan. 12, why was Milošević not apprised of the Rifampicin discovery until March 7? Why had the ICTY allowed two months to elapse before disclosing its finding?\n\n(Incidentally, this was not the first time that the ICTY had been accused of tampering with Milošević’s medication and endangering his health. In November 2002, a Reuters report revealed, “Wrong medicines given to Slobodan Milošević in prison sent his blood pressure shooting up earlier this month, forcing a halt to his trial, a Dutch newspaper reported yesterday. The paper quoted sources in the U.N. war crimes tribunal as saying administering the wrong medication caused blood pressure problems.”[22])\n\nNow, the ICTY needed to go into serious damage control. It went into action and did what it does best: it threw out baseless accusations against others. Relying on its usual cast of media mouthpieces, the ICTY turned the tables on the dead Milošević. It was not the ICTY that had administered the Rifampicin to Milošević; rather, it was Milošević who had done so. And it was the ICTY that had found out about his medication abuse and it was the ICTY that had blown the whistle on him.\n\n“Did Milošević take illicit drug in high-risk plot to beat justice?” asked the headline of a story in the Times (London). The ICTY, the story opened breathlessly, has “begun an urgent investigation into how Slobodan Milošević had access to unprescribed drugs inside his prison cell before he died at the weekend.” Quoting an ICTY “source,” the Times went on, “It is thought to have been an escape plan, the idea being that he went off for treatment to Russia, but was then too ill to be returned to the trial.”[23] The story then referred to one Donald Uges, described as a professor of clinical and forensic toxicology at the University of Groningen. The strange Donald Uges was to feature prominently in the coming days during the bizarre Rifampicin saga.\n\nUges had a theory he was eager to share with the media. According to the Times, Uges thought that Milošević\n\nhad taken the drugs to improve his case for getting medical treatment in Russia, where his wife, son and brother live: “I don’t think he took his medicines for suicide, only for his trip to Moscow…I think that was his last possibility to escape The Hague. I am sure there is no murder.”…The Hague court became suspicious that Mr Milošević was secretly taking unprescribed drugs after his official medicine failed to work. On January 12 doctors suggested the most likely reason was that he was secretly taking unofficial drugs for a second time. In 2003 he was found to have been taking drugs supplied by his Belgrade doctor rather than those prescribed by the prison doctor, and since then had to take medication under supervision.\n\nSo Milošević was taking medicine on a regular basis that he wasn’t supposed to be taking. And, according to Uges, Milošević did this in order to book his passage to Moscow. It was not explained how Uges—a forensic toxicologist, not a doctor, a psychologist, a psychiatrist or a police investigator—could rule out suicide or murder. How could Uges, who had never even met Milošević, know what was going in the former Yugoslav president’s mind? The Times also quoted the ubiquitous Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch, who, just like Uges, inexplicably seemed to be in no doubt that Milošević was helping himself to non-prescribed medication: “What measures were in place to ensure unprescribed medicines were not passed to him?” he demanded to know. “If the tribunal knew about it and was negligent, then that is bad.”\n\nThe facts, as recited by Uges, were almost entirely incorrect. It was Milošević himself who had volunteered to undergo the Jan. 12 blood tests under controlled conditions. There was no finding that he was taking drugs supplied by his Belgrade doctor in 2003. Milošević was taking medication under ICTY supervision because all ICTY detainees took medication under supervision. Uges’s wild inaccuracies didn’t stop him from giving innumerable interviews and, more important, from later offering expert advice to the ICTY’s “internal” investigation into Milošević’s death.\n\nThe Associated Press was also happy to serve as an ICTY intermediary: “Slobodan Milošević had regular access to unprescribed drugs and alcohol smuggled into his prison cell, yet the U.N. war crimes tribunal failed to take immediate action despite warnings.”[24] According to AP, Milošević\n\nself-medicated in order to slow the pace of his war crimes trial by taking advantage of his heart condition….The officials told the AP that two doctors had concluded the former Serb leader intentionally was taking drugs that undermined medication prescribed for his heart ailments…. [Milošević] was allowed to work in a private office where he could meet with witnesses and legal advisers unsupervised, making it impossible to monitor material they may have smuggled in to him, one of the officials told the AP.\n\nAnother AP story asserted, “[P]rison authorities repeatedly found banned material in his cell, including alcohol and unprescribed drugs.”\n\nThe AP story was a little different from the one in the Times. First, alcohol had suddenly made an appearance. Second, Milošević was now alleged to be taking the non-prescribed medication so as to undermine his prescribed medication and thus slow the pace of the trial. Third, a new theme had emerged: If the ICTY was guilty of anything, it was of excessive laxity and tolerance.\n\nAgence France-Presse came up with another variation on the story. “The office of the prosecutor,” the AFP story declared,\n\nrecalled that in 2003 during the prosecution presentation of the trial, it had “proved” that he was not taking his prescription medicine and took other non-prescription drugs as well. Milošević seemed to suffer a rise in blood pressure requiring rest days when ever a star prosecution witness testified. The trial was interrupted over a dozen times during the prosecution case because Milošević fell ill. “The overall and unanimous opinion of the experts is that the accused is not fit to conduct the trial himself, that he is not taking the drugs in the manner prescribed” prosecutor Geoffrey Nice said in September 2003. Last December the prosecution told the judges that Milošević’s request to be sent to Moscow should be denied because “the medical condition is and has been to an extent a fraud.” [25]\n\nAccording to AFP then, Milošević was only getting sick because the prosecutors were doing such a superb job. Milošević was taking non-prescribed medication, including presumably Rifampicin, “when ever a star prosecution witness testified” so that he could get extra rest days. In fact, Milošević wasn’t sick at all; his medical condition was a “fraud.” Yet, confusingly, he was “not fit to conduct the trial himself.” Even more confusingly, if Milošević’s medical condition was indeed a “fraud,” why was he now dead?\n\nOn March 16, AFP reported that\n\nprosecutors said the medical reports supported their belief that Milošević made himself too ill to appear in court by skipping his heart medication….Two weeks ago, after the court asked for blood tests to find out why Milošević was not responding to treatment for high blood pressure, toxicologist Donald Uges suspected and found the presence of the antibiotic rifampicin, which is known to counter the effects of other medication.[26]\n\nSo now, it was supposedly the ICTY that had ordered the blood tests—and a mere “two weeks ago,” not in January. And now Uges had apparently found in Milošević’s blood what he had suspected all along! But why would Uges have suspected the presence of a rare and difficult to obtain antibiotic?\n\nThe Los Angeles Times added more details about Milošević’s alleged subterfuge. Milošević had allegedly been “allowed access in detention to some visitors with only minimal surveillance and searches…. The limited scrutiny of those visits could have provided an opportunity for Milošević to obtain the drug rifampicin, which was found in his blood and may have contributed to his death.”[27] The report went on, “Because Milošević chose to represent himself before the tribunal, he was given the right to meet with his legal advisors, diplomatic officials or prospective trial witnesses in a work space that was only lightly monitored.” So now we have the suggestion that Milošević’s “legal advisors, diplomatic officials or prospective trial witnesses” were colluding with him in the smuggling operation while a lackadaisical, benevolent ICTY looked on, paying little attention to prison security.\n\nThe most detailed account of Uges’s allegations appeared in the New York Times under Marlise Simons’s byline. On March 12, Simons reported that Milošević “had been taking medicine not prescribed by his physicians, including an antibiotic known to diminish or blunt the effect of the medicines he had been taking for heart and blood-pressure problems.” The next day, her report led off with the statement,\n\nA top toxicologist in the Netherlands said…that he believed that [Milošević] had been manipulating medication to fake a medical condition, a ploy that contributed to his ill heath and may have played a role in the heart attack that caused his death. That theory was advanced by Dr. Donald Uges…who suggested that Mr. Milošević had been seeking to demonstrate that Dutch doctors could not cure him and that he should therefore be allowed to seek treatment, and freedom, in Moscow.[28]\n\nYet another variation on the story: We now have Milošević’s faking his medical condition and, in doing so, causing his own death. That of course would tie things up nicely for the ICTY, which badly needed to explain away the sudden death of a prisoner who, a few days before his demise, had accused it of poisoning him. Simons, a long-standing ICTY sycophant (note her ingratiating “top toxicologist in the Netherlands” comment), could be relied on to get out whatever message the ICTY wanted to get out. The ICTY message of the day was that Milošević was a faker, that he caused his own death and that the Dutch doctors assigned by the ICTY had provided first-rate treatment.\n\nAccording to Simons, Uges\n\nwas first contacted in January by a senior toxicologist in The Hague, Dr. Daan Touw, who had been consulted by the court about Mr. Milošević recurrent health problems. “Milošević had constant high blood pressure, and the cocktail that always works was having no effect,” Dr. Uges said. “So Touw had concluded that another medicine was being used to stimulate the liver and to neutralize this cocktail. He asked me for a report, a counter-expertise, because his own report had been dismissed by Milošević’s lawyers. We both had the idea there was an unknown drug which broke down his own medication, and we got the idea that the most efficient was rifampicin,” he said. “I wrote a report about this in January, which was sent to the court. In late February, I was asked to check a blood sample for rifampicin and found it,” he said, adding that he was told only later that it belonged to Mr. Milošević. Dr. Uges said it was an unusual test. “Normally when you screen for toxic drugs you never screen for rifampicin because it is specific for tuberculosis and leprosy, so unless you have a reason, you don’t look for it,” he said.\n\nIt’s worth quoting Simons at length because the tale she spun, under the influence of Uges, had more than a few peculiarities to it. First, we have the by-now familiar story that the reason the prescribed medication wasn’t working was that Milošević was taking some other medication to mitigate its effects. Simons didn’t bother to ask how Uges was able to rule out alternative explanations. Maybe the prescription was wrong? Maybe the dosage was wrong? Maybe Milošević was not taking the medication he had been prescribed? On the basis of no tests and no forensic examination, Uges reaches the extraordinary conclusion that Milošević’s blood probably contained Rifampicin, a highly unusual drug. Then, we are told, in late February, Uges was handed an unidentified blood sample, which, amazingly enough, contained Rifampicin! And then, Uges was told that the unidentified blood sample belonged to Milošević.\n\nThis of course was head dizzying in its wild implausibility. On the basis of no evidence, a toxicologist concludes that a patient whom he had not seen was taking non-prescribed medication to mitigate the effects of prescribed medication—exactly in accord with the suspicions and unsubstantiated allegations of ICTY prosecutors. He speculates that the non-prescribed medication was Rifampicin, and writes a report obviously intended for the Milošević prosecutors. He is then handed a blood sample to check. He checks it and find that it contains Rifampicin. He is then told the blood sample belonged to Milošević. All of this is supposedly happening at the very time the ICTY judges are desperately looking to find some justification to deny Milošević’s request to receive medical treatment in Moscow. Uges then rushes to the media to recount this fantastical tale\n\nSimons, like other reporters, had no doubts as to Uges’s veracity even as he engaged in wild speculations:\n\nDiscussing the case with colleagues, Dr. Uges said he had concluded: “There was one escape for Milošević out of prison, and that was to Moscow where his wife and son, and friends were. He wanted to go to Moscow on a one-way trip. The only way he could do that was to accuse us, to say that Dutch doctors were not treating him well.”\n\nIt was clear that Uges’s claims were key to the tale the ICTY was eager to spin. Milošević was undermining the first-rate medical care the ICTY was providing him with by taking a medication that would threaten his health to such an extent that the ICTY would have no choice but to allow him to go to Moscow.\n\nWhat’s important to keep in mind here is that it was Milošević himself who had brought attention to the Rifampicin and had accused the ICTY of poisoning him. In any police investigation of Milošević’s sudden death, the ICTY would be under suspicion. Instead, the media were happy to present the ICTY as the disinterested party doing the investigating and, Milošević, the possible victim of a crime, as the party under suspicion.\n\nNeedless to say, the media did not ask how Uges, a toxicologist with no medical or psychiatric training, someone who had never met or treated Milošević, could speak with such confidence about Milošević’s motives and thought-processes.\n\nThe media were even more credulous when it came to the nonsensical nature of the story. Consider this: According to Uges, Milošević had to be “getting sophisticated advice.” Whoever was providing him with the drug “had to know what dose to give, sufficient for it to be effective, but not too high because you get a so-called red sweat: your saliva becomes red. And someone would have to know how to get it to the patient…because you have to take a capsule of it every day to keep your blood pressure high.” In other words, as Uges himself revealed, taking Rifampicin is an enterprise full of pitfalls. There are many, much easier ways to undermine the effectiveness of prescribed medication than Rifampicin—a rare drug that is difficult to obtain and that would more than likely be detected in the blood tests Milošević regularly underwent and that he himself had proposed. Wouldn’t it have been much simpler not to take one’s medication at all? Every child knows the trick of pretending to swallow a pill, while hiding it under one’s tongue.\n\nThe media didn’t wonder how Uges could be so certain that someone else did not administer the Rifampicin to Milošević. A toxicologist presumably is only able to detect the presence of a toxin, not how it got there. And even if Uges were right, and Milošević did administer the medication to himself, how could he dismiss the possibility that Milošević had intended to commit suicide? Obviously Uges’s story fitted the needs of the tribunal very neatly. First, it answered the question as to why the ICTY had refused to allow Milošević to go to Moscow. Since he was manipulating his health to secure this trip, then the ICTY was surely right to refuse to be played for a sucker. Second, the story addressed the issue of the ICTY’s possibly negligent medical treatment. No, there was no negligence: Milošević was deliberately undermining the treatment; hence the deterioration of health. Third, the cause of death had now been identified: Milošević himself, not the ICTY, had caused his death. Fourth, the dread possibility that Milošević had committed suicide could now be ruled out. (Obviously, another suicide coming just a few days after that of Milan Babić would have been horribly embarrassing for the ICTY.) Fifth, Milošević, in order to get his hands on the illicit drugs, would have had to make use of friends, legal advisors or defense witnesses. They had taken advantage of the ICTY’s leniency. The ICTY would thus be justified in imposing tighter restrictions on its prisoners, in particular on those, such as Milošević, who elect to represent themselves.\n\nDUTCH PROSECUTORS SERVE AS ICTY ENABLERS\n\nAfter the spate of stories about Rifampicin, the Dutch autopsy results, delivered on March 17, were a bit of a disappointment. The Dutch Public Prosecutor’s Office announced that provisional autopsy results indicated that Milošević had not been poisoned, that a number of medicines prescribed for Milošević were found in the body material, but not in toxic concentrations, and that no traces of Rifampicin had been detected in his body. But, the Dutch prosecutor’s office rushed to add, “The NFI /Dutch Forensic Institute/ has informed us that rifampicine disappears from the body quickly, and the fact that no traces were found implies only that it is not likely that rifampicine had been ingested or administered in the last few days before death.”[29]\n\nSo Milošević had not been poisoned; yet the absence of Rifampicin in his blood was no proof that he had not taken Rifampicin. There was a certain lack of logic here. If the absence of Rifampicin was no proof that Milošević hadn’t taken Rifampicin, then why was the absence of toxins taken as proof that he wasn’t poisoned? Wasn’t it at least possible that a lethal toxin had been administered to Milošević, one that, like Rifampicin, disappears from the body rapidly, leaving no traces? Moreover, if the Dutch prosecutors refused to rule out the possibility that Rifampicin had been ingested, how could they be sure that someone had not administered the Rifampicin to Milošević with a view to inducing a heart attack? The Dutch prosecutors’ claims made no sense, but they demonstrated their eagerness to serve as handmaidens or enablers of the ICTY. Their illogical findings accorded neatly with ICTY needs. Milošević was not poisoned, but may still have taken the Rifampicin.\n\nInterestingly, Uges stuck by his claims. According to the New York Times, Uges\n\nsuggested that even if the drug was absent at the time of his death, it might still have played a role. He said Mr. Milošević could have precipitated a heart attack by stopping rifampicin a few days before his death, for fear that court officials suspected his illicit use of the drug. If he had abruptly stopped taking rifampicin after using it to keep his blood pressure high, it could have caused his blood pressure to plummet abruptly and brought on a heart attack.[30]\n\nBut this argument cut both ways. If somebody else was administering the Rifampicin to Milošević and then stopped a few days before his death—it was Milošević himself, after all, who disclosed the Rifampicin finding in his March 7 letter—that too could have “precipitated” the heart attack. That person or persons would then have been responsible for his death.\n\nNot too much reliance should be placed on any Dutch investigation of death at the ICTY. According to the 1994 headquarters agreement between the United Nations and the Netherlands, “The competent authorities shall not enter the premises of the Tribunal to perform any official duty, except with the express consent, or at the request of, the Registrar or an official designated by him. Judicial actions and the service or execution of legal process, including the seizure of private property, cannot be enforced on the premises of the Tribunal except with the consent of and in accordance with conditions approved by the Registrar.” In addition,\n\nThe Tribunal, its funds, assets and other property, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process, except insofar as in any particular case the Tribunal has expressly waived its immunity….The Judges, the Prosecutor and the Registrar shall, together with members of their families…shall enjoy: a) personal inviolability, including immunity from arrest or detention; b) immunity from criminal, civil and administrative jurisdiction in conformity with the Vienna Convention; c) inviolability for all papers and documents\n\nIn other words, the Dutch authorities had no jurisdiction over anything that went on at the ICTY. The ICTY could cooperate with any outside investigation or not cooperate, and there was nothing that anyone could do about it. The ICTY enjoyed total immunity for any possible criminal acts committed within its portals—a privilege that police, prosecutors and prison officials around the world could only wonder at with envy.\n\nIn 2001, when Milošević sought to challenge in a Hague district court the legality of his abduction from Belgrade and his subsequent imprisonment in The Hague, the Dutch court said it had no jurisdiction to hear his claim. The 1994 agreement, it said, had “transferred the jurisdiction to hear an application for release from detention from the Dutch courts to the ICTY.” The court cited the ICTY’s 1995 decision, Prosecutor v. Tadić, which dismissed the challenge to the ICTY’s legality. (Since the ICTY was not accountable to anyone, it could act as a judge in its own case and hear and dismiss challenges to its legality.) Finally, the court cited the European Court of Human Rights’ 2000 decision, Naletilić v. Croatia, which held that courts have no business second-guessing the ICTY because it is an “international court which, in view of the content of its Statute and Rules of Procedure, offers all the necessary guarantees including those of impartiality and independence.” When Milošević subsequently made the same application to the European Court of Human Rights, the court dismissed it, ruling that Milošević “had failed to exhaust the available domestic remedies” in the Netherlands.\n\nLet us return to the Rifampicin: It was striking that, despite the Dutch authorities’ failure to find any Rifampicin in Milošević’s blood, the media chose to believe the ICTY story: Milošević had administered Rifampicin to himself. According to the AP story that reported the Dutch autopsy results, Hans Holthuis, the ICTY registrar had “ordered an external investigation to find out how Milošević obtained drugs he was not supposed to have. Tribunal officials earlier said he also had regular access to alcohol.”[31] According to AFP, Holthuis had discovered non-prescribed medication in Milošević’s cell in late 2005 and early 2006. Holthuis was quoted as saying, “We did take the necessary action when this contraband was found in a regular search. (Warden Timothy McFadden) took action immediately, but I do not want to go into details.” Holthuis added that Milošević had been “under constant and very effective scrutiny.” As for the Rifampicin discovery, “Holthuis insisted the information was passed to the trial chamber ‘immediately.’ ” Ah, so the ICTY had now corrected the one last bit of bad news. The ICTY was not lackadaisical about security in its prison. To the contrary: It engaged in “constant and very effective scrutiny.”\n\nThis was apparently too much even for the AFP reporter to swallow. Didn’t the blood test supposedly take place in January? So how come no one knew about the result until March? Holthuis, according to the AFP reporter, “added that it ‘took some time’ for it to be brought to the attention of the chamber overseeing the Milošević trial.” Holthuis, the AFP reporter noted, was “apparently contradicting his earlier statement that action was taken immediately.”[32]\n\nTHE ICTY’S REPORT ON MILOŠEVIĆ’S DEATH\n\nIn due course, on May 31, the ICTY released the report of its internal inquiry, written by its vice president, Judge Kevin Parker. As expected, the tribunal absolved itself—its judges, prison staff, administrators and doctors—of any blame for Milošević’s death. About as much credibility should attach to this report as to the internal report of any police department, which, following the sudden death of a high-profile prisoner in its custody, tells the world that not one police officer, not one corrections officer, not one medical attendant, had done anything for which he or she should be ashamed. However, given the uncritical adulation that the willfully gullible media bestowed on the ICTY and the phalanx of so-called non-governmental organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Institute for War & Peace Reporting that lobbied fiercely on its behalf, the ICTY had every reason to be confident that its self-serving explanations would soon be accepted as unquestioned fact.\n\nNonetheless, the ICTY’s account of Milošević’s death was a self-serving work of deception, in which almost every assertion was untrue.\n\nAt the outset, Parker realized that the Milošević judges’ refusal to allow Milošević to receive treatment in Moscow and, above all, their justification for that decision, namely, that Milošević had failed to show that he couldn’t get the same treatment in the Netherlands wouldn’t suffice. It sounded too lawyerly and heartless. So Parker set out to show that the judges had acted on the best medical advice. To do that, Parker had to address head-on the November 2005 independent specialists’ report on Milošević’s health. Parker juxtaposed the views of the Western doctors against those of the Russian and Serbian counterparts. On one side, we had van Dijkman and Tavernier. On the other side, the Russians, Margaret Shumilina and Leo Bokeria, and the Serb, Vukasin Andrić. Working on the assumption that the Western public would deem Western doctors more credible than Russian and Serb doctors, Parker proceeded to denigrate and belittle the expertise of the latter.\n\nShumilina barely got a mention. Andrić was dismissed because a Dutch specialist had rejected his diagnosis. According to Parker,\n\n“Dr J. de Laat, a physicist-audiologist expressed quite different opinions from those of Professor Andrić as to the cause and nature of the concerns raised by Mr. Milošević. He agreed there was a perceptive hearing loss, more so in the right ear, but considered that with different technical arrangements Mr. Milošević could continue with the trial.”\n\nTypically, what Parker said here was untrue. Back in November 2005, the trial chamber had turned to an outside expert for a diagnosis on Milošević’s hearing problems. That expert, De Laat said that, based on tests of Milošević’s hearing, “observed perceptive hearing loss on both sides” had taken place. In his view, “it was probable that the two current medical conditions of the Accused were ‘connected,’ but he could not be sure.” De Laat said that it was “probable that the cardiovascular situation is…connected to the hearing loss. We cannot be sure of this.” This was a bit of a problem for the tribunal, since its man, N.J.M. Aarts—a Dutch ear, nose and throat specialist who had been treating Milošević for two months—had dismissed Milošević’s hearing problems as merely something to be expected for a man of his age.\n\nParker made no mention of what de Laat actually said—for obvious reasons. As for Bokeria’s diagnosis, Parker solemnly declared, “Nor can it be concluded that surgery as identified by Professor Bockeria in his letter of 5 April 2006 would have prevented the death of Mr. Milošević.” The passive voice, the use of the subjunctive and the double negative serve to obscure the arrogance and dishonesty of Parker’s claim. There is no medical procedure in the world that is guaranteed to save the life of a very ill person. But that has nothing whatever to do with whether it should be attempted or not. Significantly, both doctor and patient wanted to undertake the procedure, and the ICTY could cite no doctor who advised against it.\n\nThe French cardiologist, Florence Leclercq, the third of the three experts who examined Milošević in November, was clearly the swing vote. Unlike the other two experts, Leclercq, a Westerner, received respectful treatment from Parker who, understandably, was anxious to prove that her diagnosis was in full accord with those of van Dijkman, Tavernier and the ICTY doctors. According to Parker,\n\nThere is a difference of expert opinion whether surgical intervention was appropriate and would have prevented Mr. Milošević’s death. Professor Bockeria of Moscow has indicated this view to the Inquiry since the death of Mr. Milošević. This was not advised by Dr van Dijkman. Other cardiologists, Professor Leclercq from France and Professor Tavernier from Belgium, who are independent of the treating doctors, agree with the treatment provided to Mr. Milošević at UNDU. They do not agree that surgery was necessary or that it would have prevented the death of Mr. Milošević. In these circumstances it cannot be concluded that there was a failure to provide proper care by those treating Mr. Milošević at UNDU.\n\nHowever, Tavernier and van Dijkman were severely compromised. Van Dijkman had treated Milošević for a number of years to no great effect. Tavernier had all too easily fallen in with ICTY political desiderata over the attorney-imposition issue. They had every incentive to insist that the ICTY-provided treatment was first-class. Rather than attend to an increasingly ailing patient, they had chosen to make a variety of unfounded and damaging accusations against him.\n\nParker applied all of his ingenuity to suggest—dishonestly—that Leclercq had endorsed the treatment the ICTY had provided Milošević. Both Tavernier and Leclercq, according to Parker, “were of the opinion that the treatment regime prescribed for Mr. Milošević at UNDU was appropriate.” According to Tavernier, Parker reported, “there is no test that if carried out would have helped detect or prevent the cause of death. When you have a heart hypertrophy and a high blood pressure you have to change your life-style and take your medications. Having taken additional tests would not have resulted in new recommendations or changing the prescribed medications.” And, according to Leclercq, Parker reported, “unfortunately, the possibilities of preventive treatment are almost nil.”\n\nBut Parker was seriously mischaracterizing what Leclercq had actually said. In fact, she had said nothing of the sort. In her Nov. 4 report, Leclercq said that Milošević “is a patient with a cardiovascular risk and the left ventricular hypertrophy increases this risk. The disorders the patient is now complaining of could have developed from an atherosclerosis of the neck or intracranial vessels as a consequence of the risk factors which have developed over several years.” She recommended additional tests. In subsequent newspaper interviews, she said, “His medical condition was not good, so we asked for additional tests to evaluate his cardiac situation. But these investigations were never performed, and now that’s a problem.”[33] She added, “Prison officials assured her that some cardiac tests, like an ultrasound, had been done and were ‘normal,’ but they could not show her the actual test results, leaving her to conclude that more was needed.”[34]\n\nTo be sure, Leclercq recommend no change in the anti-hypertension treatment and other cardiovascular therapy. However, this was a far cry from her claiming that the “treatment regime prescribed for Mr. Milošević at UNDU was appropriate.”\n\nInterestingly, while Parker swore by Tavernier and Leclercq when it came to their supposedly recommending no change to Milošević’s treatment, Parker admitted, without comment, that neither cardiologist seemed to agree with the pathologist’s report as to the cause of death.\n\nBoth Professor Leclercq and Professor Tavernier noted the wording of the pathological report in its use of the term “hartinfarct,” which they understood as “myocardial infarction.” In Professor’s Leclercq’s opinion, “I do not think that that the description in the pathology report suggests a myocardial infarction in the sense in which I would use that term as a cardiologist.” Professor Tavernier did not consider that the report was demonstrating what he, as a cardiologist, would describe as an acute myocardial infarction.\n\nParker seemed to attach little significance to this. However, it undermined his entire thesis. Myocardial infarction is the medical term for heart attack. The two cardiologists, with whose diagnoses Parker purported to associate himself, were telling him that they didn’t think Milošević had died of a heart attack. The two cardiologists’ doubts raised serious questions about the rushed Dutch autopsy. The pathologists’ report was inconsistent with heart attack being the cause of death. That’s not an insignificant issue!\n\nREPORT OFFERS DEARTH OF NEW INFORMATION\n\nParker’s report added few new details to the story the ICTY had put out to the media through its not-for-attribution quotes in the immediate aftermath of Milošević’s death: Milošević was not murdered; he did not commit suicide; he had been self-medicating for years; he had administered the Rifampicin to himself; he received first-rate medical care in the ICTY prison, which he chose to sabotage; nothing could have been done to prevent his death; he sought to conceal his medical records from the ICTY; the decision not to allow him to go to Moscow was based on sound medical advice and solid legal reasoning and, in any case, had no bearing on his sudden death; and he obtained the non-prescribed medication by exploiting the “privileges” the ICTY had been forced to grant him because of his insistence on acting as his own counsel.\n\nThe cause of death, Parker concluded, was neither murder nor suicide. Milošević died from a heart attack and there was “no poison or other chemical substance found in his body that contributed to the death.” The autopsy report, according to the ICTY,\n\nestablishes that Mr. Milošević’s death was caused by natural causes and excluded any toxicologically identified factors which could have contributed to his death….[The] results indicated that no poisons had been found in Mr. Milošević’s body, that a number of medicines, which had been prescribed for Mr. Milošević had been found.\n\nSo Milošević died of “natural” causes? Not really. For the greatest part of the report was given over to the accusation that, during his four years in detention at the ICTY, Milošević was “self-medicating”: He was allegedly not taking his prescribed medication while taking all manner of non-prescribed medication.\n\nSo why go on about this at such length unless to suggest that Milošević did indeed kill himself? But no, the ICTY insisted: “Mr. Milošević’s non-compliance with his therapeutic plan and his tendency to self-medicate…cannot reasonably be interpreted as a sign of suicidal intent.”\n\nWas this alleged self-medication then the cause of the heart attack? The ICTY didn’t say so, and offered no evidence to support such a claim. Was Milošević self-medicating in order to feign illness? No, for Parker insisted that the ICTY provided Milošević with the best treatment imaginable and that nothing could have been done to prevent the heart attack.\n\nThe ICTY report was confusing, and meant to be so. In truth, the self-medication charges were a gigantic smokescreen to conceal ICTY culpability for, at best, negligence toward its most famous detainee and, at worst, something more sinister.\n\nThe ICTY relied heavily on Professor Uges’s various claims and suggestions. However, unlike Uges, and the reporters who based their stories on his speculations about dreams of escape to Moscow, the ICTY offered no explanation as to why Milošević would have been self-medicating and taking Rifampicin. If Milošević wasn’t suicidal, then why was he ignoring the ICTY doctors’ advice?\n\nRevealingly, despite all of the ICTY rumblings and threats about uncovering the method by which Milošević had supposedly obtained the illicit drugs, the ICTY’s report came up with nothing: not one episode of Milošević’s being caught not taking his medication; not one episode of Milošević’s being caught taking non-prescribed medication; no mention of a single incident in which anyone was observed smuggling drugs into the prison; no name of any person who may be a plausible smuggling suspect; no account of any test having been undertaken to demonstrate how drugs could have been brought into the prison; no evidence indeed that any of the medication Milošević was supposedly ingesting illicitly had had any harmful effect on his health, let alone been the cause of his death. Most shocking of all, Parker’s report made clear that the ICTY’s basis for making the self-medicating charges was amazingly threadbare.\n\nThe ICTY helpfully released a number of internal documents to go together with this report. Doubtless, tribunal officials believed that these documents, consisting mainly of claims by prison officials and doctors that Milošević was not following his prescribed medical regimen and was carrying on in a way that undermined prison order, would either not be read or be complacently accepted as solid proof vindicating ICTY allegations. Yet, despite their highly selective and tendentious nature, the documents, time and again, show Parker to be at best confused and at worst deliberately lying. In fact, the documents not only reveal the extraordinary level of collusion between the Dutch doctors and the ICTY prosecutors, but also show the Dutch doctors to be acting as tribunal spies and prison enforcers rather than as medical professionals. The reckless charges the doctors throw around against their own patients and their repeated violations of doctor-patient confidentiality show that their chief priority was facilitation of the ICTY’s work, not their patients’ well-being.\n\nTo absolve the ICTY of any responsibility for Milošević’s death, Parker conceded at once that the tribunal had been aware since 2001 that Milošević was seriously ill:\n\nSome time after his admission…reports of a detailed medical examination, including of a coronary angiogram, conducted on Mr. Milošević between 11 April and 13 April 2001 in the Military Medical Academy in Belgrade were made available to Dr Falke. These reports indicated that Mr. Milošević had a heart hypertrophy and a myocardial bridge, and that he suffered from unregulated hypertension with probable presence of angina pectoris.\n\nParker quoted Dr Zdravko Mijailović, chief of the clinic of cardiology at the Military Medical Academy in Belgrade, who had been Milošević’s treating cardiologist in Belgrade, who wrote to the detention unit’s resident doctor, Paulus Falke, sometime in 2001 that Milošević “was at a high risk of a stroke, a heart attack, a sudden cardiac death, or sudden malignant heart rhythm disorder.”[35]\n\nBut this concession only compounded the ICTY’s difficulties. If the ICTY had known for years about Milošević’s dire health, why had it chosen repeatedly to accuse him of faking ill-health, manipulating his health, self-medicating and colluding with outside specialists to thwart his trial?\n\nMilošević’s most important health issue was his heart condition. Yet it was this problem that the ICTY had left unattended, rejecting Milošević’s application for treatment in Moscow. Parker also revealed that yet another doctor from the Bakulev Center had examined Milošević as far back as January 2004. Professor Elena Golukhova had\n\nfound that Mr. Milošević had high blood pressure, which was poorly controlled by beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, significant ECG abnormalities, namely signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, T-wave abnormalities and ventricular beats, borderline cholesterol level…. She recommended that T1 scintigraphy, coronary angiography, electrophysiology study and some other investigations be conducted on Mr. Milošević. She indicated that, according to the European guidelines relevant to his condition, Mr. Milošević had a high risk of fatal arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.\n\nHowever, Parker claimed, “no report from her appears ever to have been disclosed to the Tribunal or the medical officer at UNDU [United Nations Detention Unit, better known as Scheveningen] by Mr. Milošević.” That was certainly strange, for it is hard to see what advantage Milošević could have gained through sitting on her report. Nor is it clear how her visit could have escaped the ICTY’s attention. Rule 31(A) of the Rules Governing the Detention of Persons Awaiting Trial or Appeal states, “Detainees may consult a doctor or dentist of their choice at their own expense. All such consultations shall be made by prior arrangement with the Commanding Officer as to the time and duration of the consultation….The medical officer shall be informed of the outcome of all consultations of doctors or dentists.”[36]\n\nThere was no way that Milošević, under continual surveillance as he was, could have kept her visit a secret. Parker evidently had no choice but to come clean about this consultation since the Bakulev Clinic obviously had a record of Golukhova’s visit and diagnosis and had handed it to the inquiry.\n\nHOW THE ICTY JUSTIFIED IMPOSITION OF AN ATTORNEY\n\nMost of Parker’s report was taken up with the self-medicating charges—an ICTY refrain since at least 2004. Prosecutor Geoffrey Nice had first raised these charges in September 2004 when he sought (successfully) to pressure the ICTY to impose an attorney on Milošević. Prosecutors had sought to impose an attorney on Milošević back in 2001. The court rejected the prosecution requests, invoking Article 21(4) of the ICTY statute, which said that a defendant is entitled to “to defend himself in person.”\n\nDuring the prosecution phase of the trial, the ICTY had kept things under control through presiding judge Richard May’s continually interrupting Milošević’s often-effective cross-examination of witnesses. However, in March 2004, May was forced to step down on ground of ill health, and by July he was dead. With Milošević set to begin presenting his defense and calling witnesses in August 2004, panic was starting to set in within the ICTY and without. During the summer of 2004, the campaign to impose an attorney on Milošević went into high gear. Outside pressure was brought to bear on the ICTY. In July, David Scheffer, U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes issues during the Clinton administration, wrote in the International Herald Tribune:\n\nJustice for the people and for the defendant simply is not well served when the right of self-representation is abused. Surely “the interests of justice” now require that the Hague tribunal impose courtroom lawyers on Milošević over his objections…. If Milošević cannot tolerate such common sense, then perhaps the time has come to force-feed the proceedings by video to his jail cell while competent counsel defend him.[37]\n\nScheffer’s call for imposition of counsel on Milošević was followed by one in the Washington Post by Michael Scharf, professor of law at Case Western Reserve University and one of the architects of the ICTY:\n\nIn creating the Yugoslavia tribunal statute, the U.N. Security Council set three objectives: first, to educate the Serbian people, who were long misled by Milošević’s propaganda, about the acts of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by his regime; second, to facilitate national reconciliation by pinning prime responsibility on Milošević and other top leaders and disclosing the ways in which the Milošević regime had induced ordinary Serbs to commit atrocities; and third, to promote political catharsis while enabling Serbia’s newly elected leaders to distance themselves from the repressive policies of the past. May’s decision to allow Milošević to represent himself has seriously undercut these aims.\n\nScharf’s explanation had at least the merit of honesty. In countering NATO propaganda Milošević was undermining the purposes of NATO’s court. However, that wasn’t the reason for imposing an attorney on him. No, “Milošević’s antics and poor health have repeatedly disrupted the trial, justifying appointment of counsel to represent him in court for the remainder of the proceedings.”[38] Just what were these “antics”? “In addition to regularly making disparaging remarks about the court and browbeating witnesses, Milošević pontificates at length during cross-examination of every witness, despite repeated warnings from the bench.” Shocking!\n\nAs the summer wore on, the ICTY moved inexorably toward its decision to impose counsel. On July 6, the Milošević trial court issued an order, instructing the ICTY registrar to “identify a cardiologist, with no prior involvement in the treatment of the Accused, and instruct that cardiologist to carry out an examination of the Accused and consider all re"
