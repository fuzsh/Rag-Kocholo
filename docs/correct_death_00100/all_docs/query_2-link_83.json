        "text": "The Kosovo War began in early 1998, when ethnic Albanian demonstrators in the Serbian province of Kosovo began an armed campaign for independence from Serbia. Albanians living in Kosovo wanted freedom because they felt discriminated against by the Serbian government. The Serbian government responded with a brutal low-intensity conflict, which included the mass displacement of civilians, widespread human rights abuses, and the indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1997, the president of Serbia was Slobodan Milošević, who also ruled Yugoslavia as a president from 1997 to 2000. The war was fought to resist Albanian separatist forces seeking to establish an independent Kosovo. His main goal was to maintain control over Kosovo, a province of Serbia with a large Albanian population, which considered by the Serbians to be essential to the Serbian identity and history. Milošević was prosecuted for war crimes in 1999 in connection with the Kosovo War. He was accused of ordering Serbia to ethnically cleanse Kosovar Albanians during the war and of personally directing Serbian forces in the Srebrenica massacre, which took the lives of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims.\n\nIn March 1999, NATO began a bombing campaign against Serbia to force the Serbian government to stop the violence against civilians in Kosovo. The bombing campaign lasted for 78 days and eliminated the Serbian army from Kosovo.\n\nA map of Yugoslavia\n\nThe Balkan Wars of the 1990s\n\nThe Balkan wars of the 1990s were a series of conflicts from 1991 to around 2001. These wars were characterized by bitter fighting, widespread destruction, and massive human rights violations. The wars began after the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, when Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina declared their independence from the Yugoslav federation. The first Balkan war of the 1990s was fought between the countries of Yugoslavia and Croatia, beginning when Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia then attacked Croatia to keep the country under its control. The war ended in 1992; Croatia was able to gain independence successfully. Other wars escalated after the ethnic Serb minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina began to fight for their independent state, which they called Republika Srpska. Despite the Dayton Peace Agreement, which ended the conflict in Bosnia, the war dragged on in Kosovo and Montenegro until 1999.\n\nThe wars had a devastating effect on Yugoslavia and ultimately impacted the Kosovo War in several ways. First, the war led to the rise of nationalist sentiment, the breakup of Yugoslavia, and the creation of several newly independent states. The wars also resulted in the destruction of much of the infrastructure of Yugoslavia, including roads, bridges, and buildings. This made it difficult for people to move around the region and for relief and aid organizations to operate. Thousands of people, both civilians and soldiers, were killed, and millions more were displaced. This increased the sense of grievance and resentment among Kosovar Albanians and helped to spark the Kosovo War.\n\nThe Kosovo War Background\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, the Communist regimes that dominated most of Eastern Europe began to collapse in spectacular fashion. One of the most dramatic and violent of these collapses was in the former unified country of Yugoslavia, which over the course of the 1990s, broke apart into numerous different nation-states. One of these regions that desired independence was Kosovo. Their northern neighbors, Serbia, had other ideas. The resulting conflict turned into one of the bloodiest and most tragic events in Europe since World War II.\n\nEthnicity, Demographics, Religion\n\nKosovo is a small, mountainous country at the southern end of the former Yugoslavia in the Balkan Peninsula. To Kosovo's north lies Serbia, who to this day, considers Kosovo to be an inseparable part of the Serbian motherland.\n\nTo the south of Kosovo lies Albania, which was an independent and largely-isolated communist republic until the early 1990s. As 90% of the Kosavar population is ethnically Albanian, Albania came to play a key role in supporting Kosovo during the Balkan wars. To the west of Kosovo lies Montenegro and to the east lies Macedonia.\n\nReligion played an important role in the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. Because much of the Balkans had been a part of the Ottoman Empire until World War I, many ethnic groups in the region practice Islam. In Kosovo, most Albanians are Muslims. In Albania itself, about 80% of the population is Muslim.\n\nMost Serbs are Orthodox Christians and belong to the Serbian Orthodox Church. Serbian nationalists see Kosovo as the medieval cradle of both the Serbian nation and the Serbian Orthodox Church. This intense connection with Kosovo that intertwined both nationalistic and religious sentiments was one of the major factors in Serbia's attitudes towards Albanians in Kosovo.\n\nThe Balkan Wars\n\nAs communism began to collapse throughout Eastern Europe in the early 1990s, the fate of what was then Yugoslavia was uncertain. Beginning in 1991, Croatia and Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia. Serbs didn't accept these declarations and attempted to violently suppress these attempts.\n\nIn 1992, the regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence. This began what was probably the most horrific theater in the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs clashed in numerous bloody encounters that culminated in the siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica Massacre in 1995. It was in Bosnia and Herzegovina that many of the most egregious crimes against humanity were perpetrated by Serbian forces. The Srebrenica Massacre is considered by many to be an act of genocide.\n\nSlobodan Miloševic\n\nSlobodan Miloševic was the ultra-nationalist president of Serbia. He is seen by many observers as the architect of the Balkan conflict. An important leader in Yugoslavia during the communist period, Miloševic hoped to survive the demise of communism by becoming a Serbian nationalist and capitalizing on ethnic tensions in the region.\n\nSlobodan Miloševic was charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia with war crimes, including crimes against humanity, genocide, and ethnic cleansing. He died of a heart attack in his prison cell in the Hague in 2006 before the court could reach a verdict.\n\nThe War in Kosovo\n\nAlbanian nationalists had been campaigning for Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia since the 1970s.\n\nSerbia began to suppress Albanian language, radio, schools, and participation in public life in an attempt to deter Albanian nationalism in Kosovo in the early 1990s. Increasingly, Kosovo became a divided nation, with the Serb minority occupying the official bureaucracies, while Albanians formed their own unofficial schools, governments, and civil society.\n\nThe Kosovo Liberation Army (or the KLA) formed in 1996 and were an Albanian guerrilla army that sought independence from Serbia. Although initially lacking in arms and other supplies, the KLA received significant support in the form of guns being smuggled into Kosovo via Albania and financial support from the Kosavar Diaspora."
