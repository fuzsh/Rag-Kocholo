    "text": "When the trial initially started in March 2003, Markovic didn’t appear in court, and it was decided to try her in absentia.\n\nThe Centre for Investigative Journalism of Serbia has reported that the trial was restarted several times and the indictment repeatedly amended during the process.\n\nAs Markovic didn’t turn up for her trial, the court ordered her to be remanded in custody and an arrest warrant was issued, although she was never detained.\n\nHer husband Milosevic died on March 11, 2006 in his prison cell in the Netherlands, while his trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia was still ongoing. He was buried in Pozarevac a week later.\n\nAt that point, Markovic put up a 15,000 euros in bail in exchange for the arrest warrant to be withdrawn.\n\nBut she did not travel to Serbia for the funeral of her husband, and because she also didn’t attend the next court hearing later that month, the bail money was retained by the Serbian judiciary and the arrest warrant became active again.\n\nIn June 2007, the Special Department for Organised Crime at Belgrade High Court started another investigation into Markovic at the request of the Serbian special prosecutor for organised crime.\n\nMarkovic and her son Marko – who had also fled to Russia – were probed, alongside seven others, on suspicion of involvement in the lucrative business of smuggling cigarettes from 1996 until 2001.\n\nAccording to the decision to initiate the investigation, Markovic and her son organised a criminal group using “their real power and social influence” as the wife and son of the president.\n\nThey were accused of using a front company called Tref Rent-a-Car, which they pretended was importing cigarettes legally, and of creating fake documentation to misrepresent the cost of the cigarettes. They would then sell their illegally-imported cigarettes at higher prices, without paying any tax, and transfer the money they earned out of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe other method of cigarette-smuggling they allegedly used was lying to customs officers that they were shipping furniture from Bulgaria to Hungary.\n\nInvestigators claimed that after being informed by her son Marko that their trucks were about to reach the Yugoslav border, Markovic would call Mihalj Kertes, the director of Federal Customs, and ask for the trucks not to be held up at the border and to be waved through without undergoing regular customs procedures.\n\nKertes was also indicted alongside Markovic in the apartment corruption case, but was acquitted. He was acquitted of the cigarette-smuggling charges as well.\n\nMeanwhile the investigation into Markovic and her son was put on hold because they were no longer in Serbia, and the probe has not restarted since then.\n\nPolitical assassinations"
