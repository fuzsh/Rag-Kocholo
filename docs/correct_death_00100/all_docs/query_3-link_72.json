        "text": "GIF Hoshie/Wikimedia Commons\n\nOver the course of just three years, torn by the rise of ethno-nationalism, a series of political conflicts and Greater Serbian expansions, , the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia disintegrated into five successor states: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later known as Serbia and Montenegro).\n\nThe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, founded in 1943 during World War II, was a federation made up of six socialist republics. From 1960 to 1980, the country was something of a regional power and an economic success story. Following Titoâ€™s death in 1980, leaders such as Slobodan Milosevic rose to power and took advantage of the weakening state by utilising Serbian ultra-nationalism to fan the flames of conflict throughout the various neighbouring countries. As the rise of nationalism grew, Slovenia followed by Croatia voted for independence and broke away from Yugoslavia by 1991."
