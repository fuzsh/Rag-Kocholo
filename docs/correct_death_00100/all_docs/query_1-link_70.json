    "text": "The Trial of Slobodan Milosevic\n\nFormer Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic died at The Hague in March, 2006 only months before the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY) was to reach a verdict in his four year trial. Milosevic had been charged with war-crimes for his role in the 1990s ethnic cleansing and genocide that took place during the Bosnian war in the early 1990s and the Kosovo crisis of the late 1990s. The trial was fraught with delays due to Milosevic's self-representation and bouts of \"ill-health.\"\n\nFollowing Milosevic's death many observers criticized the sheer length of his trial and the broad scope of charges filed against him. Critics stated that prosecutors had brought too many charges against Milosevic in an effort to create a historical narrative. Many of Milosevic's victims expressed anger that they had been \"denied justice\" by Milosevic's premature demise.\n\nThis page followed and analyzed Milosevic's trial.\n\n2006\n\nProsecutors Seek To Learn Lessons from Milosevic Case (June 28, 2006)\n\nThe slow-paced and ultimately unsuccessful trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic leads the global community to scrutinize the ability of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia to deliver justice in a timely manner. Attributing failed attempts to capture key suspects to the lack of an ICTY police force and failures of cooperation from certain countries, Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte calls for greater ICTY authority to arrest fugitives. (Serbianna)\n\nMilosevic Not Poisoned, UN Finds (May 30, 2006)\n\nIn a UN report, a team of Dutch doctors and prosecutors confirms that former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic died from natural causes, refuting widespread allegations of poisoning. The report suggests that authorities could not always monitor what medication Milosevic took since he enjoyed \"privileges\" such as a private room at the detention center to confer with his \"legal associates.\" Although the doctors have all ruled out foul play, they disagree over whether surgery could have prevented Milosevic's death. (BBC)\n\nMilosevic Trial: Fair, Faked or Fantasy? (May 5, 2006)\n\nA recent conference on the Slobodan Milosevic trial sought to provide some sort of closure after the former Yugoslav president's death. Discussions focused on the overall fairness of the trial with critics, including Milosevic's counsel, referring to the heavy presence of political bias. However, proponents of The Hague tribunal at the conference argued that the court has brought about \"an era of accountability\". (Institute for War and Peace Reporting)\n\nLessons from the Milosevic Trial (April 26, 2006)\n\nThe author argues Slobodan Milosevic's trial taught international criminal tribunal prosecutors to \"keep it simple\" and \"keep it free from posturing.\" The testimony of witnesses must not be a \"cathartic exercise\" or used to document history, but to test strictly legal and factual issues. Milosevic's trial convinced Iraq Tribunal prosecutors to concentrate on a few key events and try Saddam Hussein with specific charges. (Online Opinion)\n\nMilosevic Dies Before Trial Verdict (March 12, 2006)\n\nFormer Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic died at The Hague before the International Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY) reached a verdict in his trial.

Though the trial has already set a longevity record for international criminal trials, Milosevic insists that he will need more than the allotted time to present his defense. ICTY officials worry that refusing Milosevic's request will reflect poorly on the tribunal's reputation for fairness. (New York Times)\n\nA Comparison of Saddam, Milosevic Trials (October 20, 2005)\n\nAs of October 19, 2005, former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein are both on trial for crimes they committed during their respective reigns. Although many are tempted to draw comparisons between the two, there are in fact many differences between the quests for justice for the former heads of government. This Associated Press article describes the distinctions.\n\nMilosevic Defence Struggles on (July 22, 2005)\n\nThe credibility of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's witnesses seems to consistently dissolve under cross-examination and unintentionally strengthen the prosecutors' case. Furthermore, as Milosevic began winding down his shaky defense, prosecutors in The Hague asked the judge to re-open their case in view of new evidence against him in a trial that is set to prolong indefinitely. (Institute for War and Peace Reporting)\n\nAs Trial Drags on, Milosevic Sticks to His Story (June 14, 2005)\n\nThe Milosevic trial has set a record for longevity in international law, and its end is nowhere in sight.

(International Herald Tribune)\n\nMilosevic Running Out of Time (April 15, 2005)\n\nFormer Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic has indicated that he will ask for an extension to his defense case, after using six months and 20 witnesses to rebut only one of his three indictments. Observers attribute the trial's slow pace to Milosevic's political grandstanding and contempt for court proceedings, as well as the fact that hearings take place only three days a week due to the defendant's poor health. Prosecutor Geoffrey Nice has urged the court to control Milosevic's behavior and refuse his request for an extension of time. (Institute for War and Peace Reporting)\n\nMilosevic Defense Presents Evidence of Mass Murders By Serbian Forces in Kosovo (March 16, 2005)\n\nWhen General Radomir Gojivic testified on behalf of Slobodan Milosevic at the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, he inadvertently gave evidence to show how the former president is criminally liable under the doctrine of command responsibility. Milosevic was trying to demonstrate through Gojivic, a former Yugoslav military prosecutor and judge, that the army had investigated and prosecuted its own troops for war crimes. Gojivic's testimony, however, showed that Milosevic knew about, yet failed to take action to prevent crimes committed by his subordinates. (Coalition for International Justice)\n\nCourtside: Milosevic Trial (February 11, 2005)\n\nAs the Slobodan Milosevic trial adjourns yet again due to the former Yugoslav president's poor health, judges have calculated that Milosevic has only used fourteen sitting days out of the ninety allocated for his defense. Furthermore, his court-appointed lawyers have exhausted their last avenue of appeal in their efforts to leave the trial. Their desperation to leave is such that they have not ruled out abandoning the court and facing the consequences.

(Reuters)\n\nMilosevic May Defend Himself (November 1, 2004)\n\nIn a \"rare courtroom victory\" for Slobodan Milosevic, judges in the war crimes trial have once again awarded the former Yugoslav president the right to defend himself. However, the judges also stipulate that Milosevic must accept a \"standby lawyer\" if he once again becomes too sick to defend himself. The decision comes shortly after Milosevic's lawyers appealed their own appointment. (Associated Press)\n\nMilosevic's Lawyers Ask To Be Taken Off Case (October 28, 2004)\n\nSlobodan Milosevic's two lawyers, frustrated with the \"almost impossible\" task of getting defense witnesses and the former Yugloslav leader to cooperate, have told the war crimes court that they cannot fulfill their duties. The court could reject the request, find replacements or let Milosevic lead his own defense. But new replacements would likely face the same problems as the current lawyers, and Milosevic has already proven incapable of addressing charges. (New York Times)\n\nMilosevic Counsel Explains Appointment Appeal (October 1, 2004)\n\nStephen Kay released an appeal on his appointment as Slobodan Milosevic's lawyer in the former Yugoslav leader's war crimes trial.

(Institute for War and Peace Reporting)\n\nLessons from a 'Textbook' War Crimes Trial (September 19, 2004)\n\nFormer Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic still refuses to cooperate with the court that he perceives as \"an institution created to convict him\" and his actions may set a precedent for future trials of leaders, such as Saddam Hussein, at the International Criminal Court. However, judges have cracked down on Milosevic's attitude and insist that the trial will go on in order to uphold the court's \"prestige, reputation and integrity.\" (New York Times)\n\nJudges Order Milosevic Case Delay (September 16, 2004)\n\nJudges of the International Criminal Tribunal in Yugoslavia have given another month to former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's court-appointed lawyers to prepare their case.

While a counsel would probably speed up the trial, the court risks undermining faith in its fairness both within Serbia and the international community.
