Milošević's four-year trial had been a major international news story, and he died a few months before its verdict was due. His death occurred shortly after the Tribunal rejected his request to seek specialized medical treatment at a cardiology clinic in Moscow.[2] A report published on 30 May 2006 confirmed that he had died of natural causes and that there was \"no poison or other chemical substance found in his body that contributed to the death\".[1]\n\nQuick Facts Date, Location ...
