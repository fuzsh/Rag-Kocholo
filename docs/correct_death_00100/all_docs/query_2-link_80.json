As events progressed, the opposition to his regime grew, extending beyond the intelligentsia to encompass regular citizens. Additionally, by the close of May 1992, comprehensive sanctions were imposed against Milošević's brainchild, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in response to the shelling of Sarajevo. These sanctions were not akin to those against Russia, but rather constituted a complete embargo on all imports and exports, air communications, and financial transactions.\n\n\n\nSerbs are still queried about how they endured. The explanation lies in Serbia's status as an agrarian nation with a robust rural economy. In contrast to Poland, there was no enforced collectivization in Yugoslavia after the communists took power. This safeguarded Serbia's agricultural sector. Nevertheless, the blockade was comprehensive, differing from the situation in Russia.\n\n\n\nThe sanctions played a role in raising people's awareness. Prior to Milošević and the commencement of military operations, they had been leading fairly comfortable lives. For instance, in early July 1989, I departed my Belgrade residence, got into my car, and drove to Paris to celebrate the anniversary of the French Revolution. However, by December 1993, my monthly salary was a mere five German marks, and my father-in-law's pension amounted to fifty pfennigs. It led to abrupt and complete impoverishment.”\n\n\n\nNATO bombings: “Undeserved and unjust”\n\n\n\nThe NATO operation “Allied Force” lasted from March 24 to June 10, 1999. It was launched following the resumption of hostilities in Kosovo and in response to the deployment of 40,000 Yugoslav troops for an invasion of Albanian territory. The immediate trigger for the airstrikes was the killing of peaceful villagers in the village of Račak by Serb forces. The airstrikes involved more than 400 aircraft from the United States, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Norway, Canada, Turkey, Spain, Denmark, Portugal, and Italy. Over 200 sea-launched cruise missiles were also deployed. The targets of the NATO bombings included military and infrastructure sites: barracks, depots, airfields, military factories, bridges, and tunnels, although civilian casualties were unavoidable.\n\n\n\nDuring the bombing campaign, a rocket struck a train on a bridge on April 12, killing 14 and injuring 16 civilians. On April 23, an air strike hit the Belgrade television center, resulting in the deaths of 16 people. In 2002, Dragoljub Milanović, the general director of television, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for failing to evacuate personnel from the building, despite knowing it could be destroyed. Many international organizations, including Amnesty International, condemned the strike on the television center.\n\n\n\nEstimates of the casualties from the bombings vary, with between 570 and 5,000 Yugoslav military and police personnel reportedly killed. The Serbian government assessed civilian casualties at around 1,700, while Human Rights Watch estimated 500.\n\nVukelić: “In Serbia, the attitude towards the 1999 NATO bombings was as if they had started out of nowhere, without any reason. Similar to the sentiment during World War II when the bombings by the British and Americans were called barbaric. The current Serbian authorities cultivate precisely this sentiment – it was undeserved and unjust.\n\n\n\nHowever, these bombings were not on the same level as what is happening in Ukraine now. There were no bombings of residential neighborhoods and hospitals. I know that in Belgrade, one hospital, one residential building, and another civilian facility were hit, and in all three cases, it was because our military installations and radars were located nearby. The plane doesn't aim directly; it fires a missile that homes in on the radar signal, without discrimination. That's all there is to it. Yes, there were civilian casualties, as in the case of the bombed train, but NATO admitted that it was a mistake.\n\n\n\nBefore striking a prominent building in Belgrade, a warning was issued that it would be bombed because it housed a television studio owned by Milošević's daughter. The then-director of Serbian television concealed this information, leaving his employees in place, and some of them perished. After Milošević's overthrow, he attempted to flee but was apprehended and put on trial.”"
