The quantity of recovered DNA was determined by a spectrophotometric method. 19 autosomal STR loci plus Amelogenin were amplified using the AmpFlSTR® SinofilerTM kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and PowerPlex®16 System (Promega, USA) following the manufacturers’ recommendations. An additional 27 autosomal STR loci plus Amelogenin were analyzed using two domestic kits AGCU 21 + 1 (http://www.agcu.cn/) and STRtyper-10 G (http://www.zhcodon.com/). Locus D19S433 was included in SinofilerTM kit and the domestic kit 21 + 1. Amplification reactions were carried out using the GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Life Technologies). The amplified products were analyzed using 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies). Genotyping data were determined by GeneMapper v3.2.1 software. Additional assay was carried out that genotypes 40 ideal forensic autosomal SNPs (heterozygosity is near 0.5) identified in Kenneth Kidd’s lab at Yale. Besides, mtDNA assay was applied that has 24 primer pairs in 8 triplex reactions for HVIand HVII.\n\nResults: The alleged mother and the boy shared at least one allele at all 46 tested autosomal STR loci which yielded a very high maternity index between them. But, according to the SNP profile data for 40 autosomal SNP markers, different homozygous genotypes between the alleged mother and son at five exclusionary loci (rs7229946, rs985492, rs9951171, rs214955, rs1109037) excluded maternity. Mitochondrial profiles also clearly exclude mother as a parent of the alleged son because the two persons have multiple differences(i.e. the base compositions are not the same at the fragments 16102-16224nt, 16130–16224 nt,16154-16268 nt,16231-16338 nt,16256-16366 nt,16318-16402 nt in HV-I and 83–187 nt,113-245 nt,204-330 nt,239-363 nt,239-363,262-390nt in HV-II.\n\nConclusions: Different kinds of genetic markers are needed to supplement the use of autosomal STR loci in case where the alleged parent is suspected to be related to the true parent. In the case herein, ESI-TOF-MS SNP and mtDNA analysis using the PLEX-ID platform is more discriminating than STR genotyping by CGE method.\n\nPP-002\n\nThe Retrospective Analysis of 15 Burned Cases Caused by Laser and Solarium(Tanning Booths) in Beauty-Medical Centers Evaluated Between 2006–2010 in Istanbul Council of Forensic Medicine 3rd Specialization Board\n\nSüheyla F. Aliustaoğlu1, Harun Akkaya2, Seyfullah Şahin3, Erdinç Özdemir 3, C. Haluk İnce4\n\n1Council of Forensic Medicine, 4th Specialty Board, Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n2Council of Forensic Medicine, 2nd Specialty Board, Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n3Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n4President of Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nIntroduction: It is a well known fact that since old times people are making efforts for their physical appearance. With significant progress in technology, laser epilations and tanning booths etc. (radiation and UV rays) became helpful aesthetically, making an impact in a very shortest time. Nowadays in large-scaled beauty-medical centers nearly all kind of laser and tanning booths can be seen. Since these machines are medical, they need to be used by doctors or medical staff.\n\nMethods: Between January 2006 and December 2010, the demographic data of 15 people analysed retrospectively in this study whose physical examination held in Council of Forensic Medicine 3rd Specialization Board, who applied to beauty-medical centers for laser epilation, to erase tattoo, get tan in solarium (tanning booth) and as a consequence burn scars arose and they brought a suit against those centers.\n\nResults: The average age is 32.13 ± 8.2 of the total 15 people, 12 (80 % ) of them is female. 10 of them brought suit for the bad consequences of laser epilation, 1 for needle electric epilation, 2 for erasing tattoo and 2 for getting burn in tanning booths. 7 (46.6 %) of 15 people were assessed in 2010. 2 people got burnt in tanning booth had 2nd degree of massive burnt; one of them died of burnt complications. 10 people who applied laser epilation had burnt scars and hiperpigmented lesions; 2 people who applied tattoo erasure by laser had burnt scars and cheloid tissue. 7 people stated they were not informed sufficiently, not any informed consent found in the dossier. In the reports of Council of Forensic Medicine; 9 (60 %) of 15 cases occurred by wrong medical application without any surveillance of experts.\n\nConclusion: The utilization of those devices increasing in a very short time by non-medical or uncertified people is forbidden. Within the frame of laser applications; different laser rays should vary according to the skin and hair colour, allergen texture, like many other factors. After the application of laser epilation; for 1–3 days hyperemia may occur as an expected complication; before the application informed consent must be taken from the person. Similar cases may diminish if the increasing application of laser in our country especially in recent years are made by experienced medical employees and if informed consent of the person is taken.\n\nPP-003\n\nSelf-ignition: a suicidal method between demonstrative gesture and psychopathological problems\n\nFilippo Maria Cascino , Tommaso Savì, Massimo Grillo, Calogero Mazzola, Livio Milone\n\nDepartment of Medical and Forensic Biopathology e Biotecnhology - University of Palermo – Section of Forensic Medicine - Policlinico “P. Giaccone”, Palermo\n\nSuicide by self-ignition (burning), is a rather rare event, estimated roughly in the order of 1–1,5 % of Italian national statistics about suicides. It happens when one burns himself alive autonomously, by an action intense and concentrated over time, usually made (at least initially) with the aid of a liquid fuel spread on the body surface (oil, petrol, fuel, etc.), that guarantees rapid combustion and high temperatures, then maintained by the combustion of clothing worn by the victim.\n\nIn the literature, such events are rarely described, and usually happen in people suffering from personality disorder psychopathologies (relating to voluntary search to receive intense and cruel sufferings) or are carried out for demonstrative purposes (\"ethical suicides\" or \"self-immolation\") such as political or religious reasons (the so-called \"bonzes\" in historical reference to the suicide of Vietnamese Bonze Thich Quang Duc in 1965, and Jan Palach, anti-Soviet activist of the \"Prague Spring\" in 1969).\n\nThe purpose of this paper is sharing the experience of the authors, who had the opportunity to evaluate subjects died by self-ignition; the willingness to make a striking public protest gesture against their conditions of economic insecurity was clear in some cases, especially those concerning immigrants or subjects with socio-economic problems, professional troubles, people suffering from distance from the country of origin and their families.\n\nIn other cases, less frequent as observed by the authors, the self-ignition was not made as a gesture of protest, either directly connected to the main intent of ending their lives, but it was assessable in serious mental illness that afflicted victims.\n\nPP-004\n\nFire-Related Deaths in The Temporary Housing After the Earthquake in Van City of Turkey\n\nYavuz Hekimoğlu 1, Mustafa Gökhan Dizdar1, Nergis Cantürk2, Ipek Esen Melez3, Gürol Cantürk4, Zehra Zerrin Erkol5, Osman Nuri Güler6, Recep Dursun7\n\n1Van Branch of the Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic Medicine, Van, Turkey\n\n2Department of Criminalistics, Institute of Forensic Sciences, Ankara University; Ankara, Turkey\n\n3The Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n4Department of Forensic Medicine, Ankara University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey\n\n5Department of Forensic Medicine, Abant İzzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey\n\n6Ministry of Justice Van Attorney General, Van, Turkey\n\n7Van Training Research Hospital, Van, Turkey\n\nBackground: An earthquake, which lasted for 25 seconds, occurred in Van city of Turkey on October 23, 2011 at 13:41. In that region, 9 temporary suburbs were built which consisted of 3030 tents and containers for 19130 individuals. Even though the earthquake occurred in autumn, the construction for the new permanent settlement could not be finished before the winter. Electric and wood-burning stoves used for heating, led to the accidental fires in tents. The aim of our study was to analyze the fire-related deaths in the temporary housing.\n\nMethods: The fire-related deaths occurring in the temporary settlement region following the earthquake in Van city were evaluated retrospectively. The deaths were assessed based on the age, gender, the cause of death, the place of death and the time of the death. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by using SPSS 16.0 Packet Program.\n\nResults: A total of 10 deaths and 5 cases of injuries were reported in 16 fire incidents in Van and its vicinity. Only 5 cases of death were sent for autopsy, 2 of the cases were females and 3 were males. The age distribution was between 0–30 and the mean age was 14.2 years. Four of the cases were children. The cause of death was burn and burn-related complications in all of these cases. All of these incidents occurred in tents and in one event 3 cases were from the same family.\n\nConclusion: Although the earthquake is a natural disaster, which can cause a wide range of death and destruction, human factor can also be a significant contributing cause due to the negligence in the temporary housing. The stoves and electrical equipment in the tents can be hazardous and children are the most vulnerable group in these incidents.\n\nPP-005\n\nA case of spontaneous human combustion in Bulgaria – what and how is it happening?\n\nIvan Stoyanov1, William Dokov 2, Plamen Dimitrov1\n\n1Department of forensic medicine, multiprofile hospital for active treatment Russe\n\n2Department of general and clinical pathology, forensic medicine and deontology, Medical university of Varna\n\nThe scientifically documented cases of spontaneous human combustion, in the absence of a proved external source of heat are very rare. We present a case from the village of Piperkovo, the region of Russe, Bulgaria.\n\nOn 19th of February 2012 a combusted body was found on the floor in one of the rooms in a deserted house in a small village. There was no electricity and no other source of heat in the house. The body of an eighty year old woman who lived in the house, her upper and lower extremities were burned to ashes. The head, small parts of both arms and shanks and the clothes on them were not damaged by the process of burning. The medico-legal expertise of the case proved 35 % carbon monoxide in the preserved parts of the shanks.\n\nAll analysis during the investigation process failed to prove an external source of heat, which could explain the heavy bodily burns. A detailed photo-documentation of the case was made. The authors suggest to the participant in this scientific forum to provide their hypothesis explaining the damages in that case.\n\nCHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT\n\nPP-006\n\nDomestic physical and sexual child abuse by the father of the infant - Case Report\n\nFotios Chatzinikolaou 1, Eleni Zagelidou1, Polichronis Voultsos1, Roubini Leodari3, Orthodoxia Mastrogianni2, Nikolaos Raikos1, Charoula Florou1, Elani Kalyva1, Lazaros Papadopoulos2, Konstantinos Chalazas2\n\n1Department of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece\n\n2Laborator of Forensic Service, Thessaloniki, Greece\n\n3Laborator of Forensic Service, Larissa, Greece\n\nIntroduction & objectives: The incident referred to domestic abuse and thus to lethal physical and sexual child abuse by the father of the minor, a 24 years old Roma heroin abuser. The child’s mother is a heroin abuser as well.\n\nCase: We present a lethal case of 1 and 1/2 year old Roma girl who found dead by the mother some hours later. The incidence took place in their home, in front of the three older children. The victim was hardly physically and sexually abused: Multiple bruises were found (head / upper abdomen / buttocks / arms / legs). Sexual abuse with swollen, bruised labia major, vaginal and anal penetration injuries was present. The child died from severe craniocerebral injury with cranial fractures and brain injury.\n\nDiscussion & conclusion: In this case, a multi infant abuse is concerned, in which: 1) the coexisting severe form of sexual abuse (by nature and unnatural intercourse) with severe physical abuse, 2) the victim is very vulnerable to abuse in early infancy, where it there is no involvement in the crime, 3) the death occurred because the of abuse of the victim (severe brain injury). 4) the offender is the father of the victim (domestic violence), 5) the victim belongs to a socially marginalized and low wages, low socio-economic status of Roma social group. It is argued that in Greece about 68 % of head injuries in children younger than two years old and most deaths in this age due to abuse by their parents. The actual figure is rather higher because of inadequate identification of cases. On criminal side the perpetrator is responsible for homicide with intent (since there was deception even possible), but we believe that the distinguished character of particularly heinous murder. We believe that a thorough study of such severity incidents of child abuse will greatly facilitate the proper organization of detection and prevention (in the first and second level) and to face the very important issue of child abuse.\n\nPP-007\n\nMulti Child Abuse and Neglect (a case report)\n\nEleni Zagelidou1, Roubini Leodari3, Christos Kravaritis3, Polichronis Voultsos2, Nikolaos Raikos2, Charoula Florou2, Fotios Chatzinikolaou 2\n\n1Lab. Of Forensic Service, Thessaloniki, Greece\n\n2Lab. of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece\n\n3Lab. Of Forensic Service, Larissa, Greece\n\nIntroduction & objectives: Child abuse is the bad treatment of a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caretaker, someone living in their home or someone who works with or around children.\n\nCase: We present a rare case of co-occurrence of domestic violence and three types of child maltreatment: physical child abuse, psychological child abuse, and child neglect. It concerns all six (6) children, a girl and five boys, aged from 2 ½ months up to 10 years old of a family who were examined at the Forensic Service of Greek Ministry of Justice in the town of Larissa.\n\nCharacteristic presentations of the maltreatment and risk factors in family background are discussed.\n\nDiscussion & conclusion: The minors suffered physical and moral abuse. In civil law there is a significant breach of personality (Article 57CC) in terms of penal law there is influx of criminal acts committed by persistent, such as physical damage (Article 308 PC) rather dangerous (Article 309 PC), rape (Article 336 PC) in which there are at least accomplices (e.g. injuries) and associates (particularly directly). The underage of the victim is an aggravating factor for the perpetrators. It seems difficult to establish for them dwindling allocation, while the deceit is primarily first grade (objective).\n\nPP-008\n\nThe comparison of the concentration of cytokines in serum between young and adult mouse exposed to single or chronic stress\n\nKeita Shingu 1, Kazuya Ikematsu2, Takahiro Umehara2, Yuki Abe1, Ichiro Nakasono2\n\n1Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan\n\n2Division of Forensic Pathology and Science, Unit of Social Medicine, Course of Medical and Dental Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan\n\nIntroduction Child abuse is one of the most serious social issues in Japan, and it is seriously difficult that abused children re-integrate into society. Stress induces cortisol secretion, and the hormone also affects the immune system. The development of immune function was different from age, especially, pre and post puberty. After chronic stress exposure, it was considered that time of initiation of the exposure was one of the important factor effected to immune system. Thus, we investigated the level of cytokines concerning immune system such as Interleukin (IL)-1a, 1b and 2 in serum between young and adult mouse after single and chronic stress exposure.\n\nMaterial and methods: 4-week-old (young) and 9-week-old (adult) mice were restricted as stress for an hour once daily for 2 weeks as chronic, or once at the last day of choric treatment as single. They were euthanized at 60 min after the last treatment. The blood was collected and centrifuged to obtain serum. No restricted mice were employed as control. The serum concentration of IL-1a, 1b and 2 was measured with MILLIPLEX MAP Kit.\n\nResults and discussion: The level of IL-1a in young mice significantly increased but decreased that in adult mice of single and chronic treatment compared with control groups. The level of IL-1b in young significantly increased in single but decreased to the level of control in chronic. That of adult significantly decreased in single and chronic. The expression of IL-2 in young was similar to that of IL-1b. The IL-2 level significantly decreased at single and chronic in adult. Our results suggested that single and chronic stress exposure decreased IL-1a, 1b, and 2 in adult as corticosterone increased due to stress and suppressed both cytokines. But, IL-1b, and 2 in young was increased in single, and IL-1a was increased in single and chronic, although stress also induced corticosterone secretion in young. Unfortunately, we could not fully explain the difference of the results between young and adult.\n\nConclusion We showed that the increase of cytokines after stress differed by age. This result indicated that the pathophysiology of the response to stress might be different by age.\n\nPP-009\n\nRuthless with his own child: report of a serious and complex case of child abuse\n\nShimi Maha, Allouche Mohammad , Bekir Olfa, Gloulou Fatma, Ben Khlil Mahdi, Banasr Ahmed, Hamdoun Moncef\n\nDepartment of Forensic Medicine, Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia\n\nIntroduction: Child abuse, long neglected by both society and medicine is now a focus of public attention.\n\nChild maltreatment is intentional harm or a threat of harm to a child by someone acting in the role of caretaker, for even a short time. Maltreatment is commonly divided into four categories: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. Neglect is thought to be the most common of the four and probably the most life threatening.\n\nMethod: This is a case report about a serious case of child abuse that met the physical, psychological and sexual abuse in addition to neglect.\n\nThis case was a subject of expertise in Department of Forensic Medicine of Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis.\n\nResults: It is a little girl of 9 years old who was brought by her neighbors to the emergency department. She reported being a victim of burns means of a heated knife and cigarette butts. She also reported being hit by punches and kicks as well as various blunt objects on different parts of her body.\n\nMoreover, the child says he was sexually abused by anal and vaginal intercourse. Despite multiple fractures to his limbs and pelvis, she never consulted and has been forcibly confined by her parents in their home.\n\nExamination at the medical report produced in our Department of forensic medicine confirmed the effects of burns and fractures in the pelvis and limbs. Examination of the genital organ showed signs of chronic sodomy and even vulvar lesions corresponding to genital herpes. Psychological effects were considered severe. Permanente partial disability was assessed at 67 %.\n\nConclusion: Child abuse is more than bruises and broken bones. While physical abuse might be the most visible sign, other types of abuse, such as emotional abuse or child neglect, also leave deep, long lasting scars. Physicians and others in the medical community play an important part in identifying possible victims of child abuse. Some cases raise profound questions about the relative rights of parents, children, and those charged with child abuse.\n\nPP-010\n\nDescriptive evaluation of the alleged child sexual abuse cases in Kartal district in Istanbul\n\nAlev Yalçınkaya1, Mehmet Akif Inanici 2, Sinem Yıldız3\n\n1Institute of Health Sciences, Forensic Nursing MSc Program, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n2Department of Forensic Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n3Department of Medical Education, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nObjectives: It is important to understand the variables which are related to the abuser, the victim and the occurrence of the sexual abuse events to manage those cases both legally, psychologically and socially. In this study it is aimed to lay out the descriptive information of alleged child sexual abuse cases in specific region in Istanbul to design detailed prospective research and prevention techniques in the future.\n\nMaterial-method: The medico-legal reports of Kartal Office of Forensic Medicine and verdict files of Office of the Chief Public Prosecutor Court concerning the alleged child sexual abuse cases which registered between years 2005–2010 are reviewed. One of the researchers visited the courts with the written permission of both Marmara University Ethical Committee and the Ministry of Justice. She investigated the related files and documented them in a classified manner. Statistical analysis is executed by SPSS 16.0.\n\nResults: The total number of reviewed cases is 479 and of those, 118 verdict files were reachable to the researchers. Results indicate that %82.3 (n = 394) of all cases consist of girls and the average ages of the genders are 14.5 (sd = 2.40) for girls and 11.0 (sd = 3.92) for boys.\n\nIt is found that in 65.3 % (n = 77) of the cases, the crime committed in a house; the allegation types are aggravated child sexual abuse (only) (46.6 %, n = 55), simple child sexual abuse (33 %, n = 39) and the rest is aggravated sexual abuse with another type of crime (divest of freedom i.e.). %44.9 (n = 53) of the cases are settled by the court and the verdict is imprisonment for 16 of these cases (30.2 %) and “not guilty” for 37 of the cases (69.8 %). The duration between the time when the crime committed and when the cases are settled is 14.9 (SD = 1.24) months.\n\nThe most cited probable sexual abusers are male friends (61.9 %, n = 73), strangers (15.3 %, n = 18) and brothers (8.5 %, n = 10) and the three most frequent age ranges of the abusers are 19–29 (44.1 %, n = 52), 16–18 (18.7 %, n = 22) and 30–39 (17 %, n = 20).\n\nDiscussion: Determination of child sexual abuse cases in local districts is essential to understand geographical area specific needs of interventions. The most prominent result related to this region is that, juvenile girls are under the risk of being abused by their male friends. So it is imperative that the prospective prevention program has emphasis on self borders in both romantic and social relationship with the opposite sex.\n\nPP-011\n\nAlgerian Law management of Sexual Child Abuse\n\nFatiha Amara Boulala\n\nDepartment of Legal Medicine C.H.A, Algiers, Algeria\n\nThe authors report here the case of an older little girl of 5 years misused sexually by knowledge of the father and that lasting more than two years during the absence of the parents. We received the young girl accompanied by his mother at the department of legal medicine, on requisition of the national gendarmerie criminal division.\n\nShe was smiling, calm, state contrasting paradoxically with the ploughed up state of the mother.\n\nThe authors propose to expose the absence of judicial apparatus and social in the sexual abuses in the child, putting side by side the accent on the syndrome of Stockholm developed by this child, the legal definition which gives the legislator to the rape and the absence of penalization of the psycho-traumatism in the Penal code.\n\nPP-012\n\nReal child abuse or premeditated murder: a case report\n\nFatiha Amara Boulala\n\nDepartment of Legal Medicine, C.H A, Algiers, Algeria\n\nThe authors refer you the tragic case of an infant with Down syndrome, aged 20 months, admitted to the ICU for febrile coma, who died after a week of hospitalization.\n\nTo the presence of multiple signs of violence, the prosecutor ordered an autopsy.\n\nThe mother told us that the father has never accepted this handicap and she suspected that he beat his song during her absence (she was being treated for breast cancer).\n\nAutopsy revealed multiple old and recent fractures of limbs and skull with many hemorrhages brain.\n\nThe statements of the mother contrasted with those of the father who told cops that the child often banged his head against the bars of his bed!.\n\nThe results of the autopsy and the forensic discussion put us at an impasse that we will describe.\n\nPP-013\n\nDetermination of Sariyer Family Health Centers’ Health Professionals’ Awareness Levels about Child Abuse and Neglect in Istanbul\n\nYesim Pancaroglu1, Ahsen Kaya 2, Omur Senyuz3, Coskun Yorulmaz2\n\n1Tarabya Family Health Center, Sariyer, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n2Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n3The Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nBackground: One of the prevention strategies of child abuse and neglect titled as primary prevention is defined as any intervention that prevents child abuse before it occurs. So, it is thought that the most effective outcomes are obtained about protection and prevention of child abuse and neglect with this method. Primary prevention involves the programmes like giving health care services, identification and treatment of psychological problems, alcohol and drug abuse, family planning, detection of risky groups, educating parents about child behavior, discipline, safety and development, encouraging positive parenting, promotion of social institutions to support families such as nurseries and kindergartens. In this study, it is aimed to determine the awareness levels of health personals, who works in primary health care services and to confirm the effect of their awareness to primary prevention.\n\nMethod: For this study, ethics permission document and corporation permission from Istanbul Provincial Directorate of Health were taken. It was interviewed with health personals, who work in 15 Family Health Centers in Sariyer, county of Istanbul. They were asked to fill the questionnaires with the principles of voluntary participation. Data were statistically analyzed using SPSS programme (version 14.0).\n\nResults: In this study, questionnaires supported by 64 people were evaluated. 20 males and 44 females, having the mean age 38.3 ± 8.9 years were studied. 58 (90.6 %) participants stated that child abuse and neglect is a medical problem in Turkey. 26 (43.4 %) participants remarked that they thought the frequency of this problem is more than 50 % in Turkey. 22 (34.4 %) people said that they received an education about this subject and 8 (12.7 %) participants signed that diagnosed the abuse. Only 5 (7.8 %) participants defined a prevention team for child abuse and neglect in their family health centers. 54 (84.4 %) participants indicated that they went to house calls and half of the participants said that the house calls were beneficial for determination of child abuse and neglect.\n\nConclusion: For success on primary prevention about child abuse and neglect, it must be handled by all areas about children. One of these areas is health services. House calls, which are one of the primary health care, provide prevention. Because of this, increasing of the awareness of all staffs in primary health providers in child abuse and neglect, giving more importance to house calls - keeping in mind and evaluating the child abuse and neglect in house calls- must be developed a primary prevention strategy.\n\nPP-014\n\nReview of 89 Autopsies of Child Deaths From Violence and Neglect in Suez Canal Area, Egypt\n\nAzza H El Elemi\n\nSuez Canal University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine and Clinical Toxicology, Egypt. University of Tabuk, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, KSA\n\nBackground: Child homicide is a significant cause of child mortality through inflicted abusive injuries and neglect in several countries. The extent of child abuse in Arab countries is not well identified. In Egypt there is no true data about the incidence of fatal child deaths from violence and neglect. All available data are related to natural death and death from deferent types of diseases. The study aims to investigate child deaths associated with violence and neglect.\n\nMethods: Cases of suspected child deaths from 2000 to 2007 in Suez Canal area were retrospectively reviewed. Cases were collected from the data base of the Forensic Institution of Port-said. A medico-legal autopsy had been carried out for all cases. Suspicious child deaths under 18 years old or equal were reviewed. Variables assessed were age, gender, cause of death and perpetrators of the crime.\n\nResults: Of the 89 cases, 56 were males and 33 were females. Results revealed that child death was 41.6 % in newborns less than one month, 29.2 % in age group between 15 and 18 years and 5.6 % in age group between 10 and 14 years old. The majority of perpetrators were unknown (44.95 %), followed by the victim’s colleagues and neighbors (22.47 %). Neglect with no outward signs represented the majority of child deaths (41.57 %). Blunt trauma in abusive manner during street arguments was the second cause of homicidal deaths (19.1 %). The highest rate of child deaths was in newborn and early youth.\n\nConclusion: While the exact number of child deaths from violence and neglect is uncertain and unknown, child fatalities remain a serious problem in Egypt. There is need for further examination of child fatality profiles associated with abuse and neglect in this age group and increase community outreach efforts to prevent fatal child abuse in Egypt.\n\nPP-015\n\nDoes late and non - intensive intervention in children with autism spectrum disorders, considered medical negligence: an overview on child neglect\n\nMetwally El Sayed Abdalla\n\nFaculty of Medicine, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt\n\nIntroduction: Child abuse and neglect are often considered in broad categories that include physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse and neglect. Neglect is the most common, accounting for approximately half of the reports made to child welfare agencies. Child neglect is defined by omissions that prevent a child's basic needs from being met. Autism spectrum disorders include people with autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental disorder-Not Otherwise specified.\n\nAutistic spectrum disorders, presents at 2–4 years with impaired social interaction, speech and language disorder and imposition of routines with ritualistic and repetitive behavior. And is usually managed by behavior modification using applied behavioral analysis. Recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics that all children be screened for autism at 18 months of age oblige the development of interventions that are appropriate for toddlers with ASD. According to the evidence based medicine, ABA could integrate 49 % of children with ASD into the mainstream primary school.\n\nConclusion: it is beyond debate that the appropriate treatment is ABA or early intensive behavioral intervention. The concept of early and intensive intervention should be highlighted and notified to child's parents, aiming at giving children with ASD the chance they deserve to be integrated into the mainstream in primary school.\n\nPP-016\n\nSexual Abuse Identified After Suicide; Case Report\n\nKenan Kaya1, Ahmet Hilal 1, Demet Meral2, Necmi Çekin1, Mete K Gülmen1\n\n1Çukurova Üniversitesi Tıp Fakültesi Adli Tıp Ana Bilim Dalı, Adana\n\n2Adli Tıp Kurumu Adana Grup Başkanlığı\n\nChild abuse is the bad treatment of a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caretaker, someone living in their home or someone who works with or around children. Abuse of a child is anything that causes injury or puts the child in danger of physical injury. Child abuse can be physical, sexual or emotional.\n\nSexual abuse reported as a largest part of suicide attempt causes among the childhood. The incidence of suicide between 1950–1993 among the causes of death for children under 15 years of age as increased 4-fold and suicides were 6th of causes of death between the ages of 5–14, in 1994.\n\nThe case; In 14 year-old girl's body external examination, we saw that the rigidity of the death body was continuing, dead spots were starting in the regions not compressed, as purple spots. Teleprinter was starting from neck’s midline, rising characterized to back and a parchmented area that was 10 cm on right side of the midline and width of 1.5 cm at the thickest region, the outer side of the left knee were 3x2 cm scar tissue. In the examination of the hymen we saw that the hymen was 2 cm wide and notched structure, and a partial tear at the level of 7 o'clock. Ecchymosis and bleeding was not observed around the anus and hymen. In the internal examination we found a fetus in the uterus as the product of pregnancy and the fetus was 2.5 cm sized. As a result of toxicological analyzes, there was no substance in the blood. Fetus in the uterus was detected 6–8 gestational weeks, death was consisted as a result of mechanical asphyxia due to hanging, the only male DNA profile type was detected from pregnancy material.\n\n14-year-old girl's suicide and pregnant detected after the determination of the autopsy will be examined in the light of literature regarding for child abuse and pregnancy.\n\nPP-017\n\nAn Unusual Face of Sibling Jealousy; Intersibling Violence\n\nAysun Balseven Odabaşı1, Gökhan Gitmiş 1, Ramazan Akçan1, Emre Karacaoğlu1, Kaya Yorgancı2, Türkan Yılmaz2, Ali Rıza Tümer1\n\n1Department of Forensic Medicine, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey\n\n2Department of General Surgery, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey\n\nBackground: Burns, a common cause of pediatric injuries, are responsible for severe functional, social and psychological damage. Most burn-related injuries in childhood are encountered in home environment and originally can be accidental or due to child abuse or neglect. Caretakers and parents are generally responsible for child abuse related burns, while rarely siblings or peers might cause burn injuries on minors. Here we present a case of girl burned by her elder brother, in order to draw attention to the morbidity and mortality caused by sibling rivalry, jealousy and inter-sibling aggression.\n\nCase history: An 11 months-old girl allegedly burned by her 4 years-old elder brother was admitted to burn unit of our hospital. Second and third degree burn injuries covering face, scalp, trunk and bilateral upper extremities, a total of 70 % of total body surface area, were detected. Bilateral upper-extremity amputation through or above the wrist was performed because of necrosis due to extensive burns. In following 2.5 years-period, she was underwent a series of skin transplantation operations, which are still going on, in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department. Interviewing with the family members revealed that the elder brother was jealous of his sister since her birth. Elder brother was said to be frequently obsessively mention about burning his sister. At incident day, when mother left home for a short time period; he enflamed his sister’s blanket while she was sleeping in the cradle. Elder brother stated that he was jealous of his sister and had burned her, in the forensic psychiatric examination.\n\nConclusion: Inter-sibling aggression, sibling rivalry and jealousy, which might cause high morbidity and mortality, have been extensively studied in the literature. However, to our best knowledge, this is the first ever case of intersibling violence involving such extensive burn injuries caused by a four year-old elder brother due to lack of parental supervision. Intensified parental supervision, and education and rehabilitation of siblings will play an important role in tackling such cases.\n\nPP-018\n\nPrevalence And Correlations Of School Violence Among Adolescents In Tokat-Turkey\n\nAli Yıldırım 1, Mehmet Karataş1, Resul Yılmaz1, İlhan Çetin2, İbrahim Şenel3\n\n1Gaziosmanpasa University,Tokat Türkey\n\n2Cumhuriyet University, Sivas-TURKEY\n\n3Tokat National Education Directorate,Tokat Turkey\n\nBackground: The aims of this cross-sectional study were to examine the prevalence of school violence and of physical and sexual abuse with an internationally accepted child abuse screening tool in schools. We also sought to determine the sociodemographic characteristics (relation between school violence and abuse with students’ sex, age (grade), parental education, family income, parental profession or job) of victimized adolescents in Turkey.\n\nMethods: The study is based on a sample of 5032 students in grade 6–8 in all schools of Tokat city in Turkey. The instrument used in the study was a Turkish translation of the International Child Abuse Screening Tool-children’s version (ICAST-C) developed by the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN). In addition, the questionnaire collected data on the sociodemographic characteristics of the students and their family structure.\n\nResults: Students were subjected to physical (57.0 %), psychological (59.8 %), and sexual (6.4 %) abuse with varying frequencies. A large majority (73.4 %) of students experienced one or more of the types of violence. All types of violent behaviors were more common among male than female students and were experienced significantly more frequently in urban areas than in villages or districts. Emotional violence was most common (63.6 %) in families with a single child, whereas it was relatively lower (55.4 %) among children with > =5 siblings. On the other hand, the incidence of sexual violence was lowest (3.3 %) in families with a single child, whereas it was highest (7.8 %) among children with > =5 siblings. Interestingly, children in families with higher incomes were more likely to experience physical, emotional, and sexual violence, whereas these were rarely encountered in families with lower incomes.\n\nConclusion: To address violence against students, we must first conduct nationwide studies to provide a more definitive picture of incidence and prevalence rates and to clarify relevant risk and protective factors. Second, to ensure the accuracy of the data, specific guidelines and questionnaires are needed, as was the case in our study. Third, the deleterious consequences of violence must be explained to achieve greater public awareness about victimization in schools. Fourth, the authorities must ensure and reinforce the safety and rights of children by enacting strict laws against violence and abuse.\n\nPP-019\n\nClose abdominal blunt trauma in child abuse: images under the skin\n\nAnna Aprile1, Francesca Menegazzo 2, Melissa Rosa Rizzotto2, Cristina Ranzato2, Paola Facchin2\n\n1Legal Medicine Institute, Environmental & Public Health Department, University of Padua, Italy\n\n2Child Abuse & Neglect Unit, Pediatrics Department, University of Padua, Italy\n\nBackground: Abdominal injuries are the second leading cause of mortality in child physical abuse and account for 6 % to 8 % of all physical abuse. Solid organs (liver, pancreas, kidneys, spleen), hollow organs (hypopharynx, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, small intestine, large intestine), blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves may be affected. Reported case fatalities are between 40 % and 50 %. Those injuries may be detected on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans if suspicion of their existence prompts investigation.\n\nMethod: We report the case of a child fatality due to inflicted brain injury and abdominal blunt trauma.\n\nResults: The child was brought to the ER unconscious. At initial assessment, she was in cardiac arrest, asystolic, mydriatic. After resuscitation procedures, the cardiac activity reappeared, but the neurological picture did not change. (GCS = 3). The child underwent total body CT which showed: subdural hemorrhage with cerebral oedema, pneumoperitoneum. Cerebral injury was referred to shaken baby syndrome and did not require surgical intervention, while abdominal clinical picture needed a surgical look. The laparotomy showed jejunum burst injuries and bruising. Neurological picture continued to be critical and after 2 days brain death was declared. The caregiver denied having shaken the baby and admitted to have hit her, slapping her twice on the abdomen. The autopsy confirmed the Shaken Baby Syndrome diagnosis; the abdominal cavity presented foci of diffuse contusions of jejunum and a peculiar pattern lesion, with three parallel linear bruises 2 cm long, referred subsequently to rib mark. The cutaneous exam of the abdomen revealed no or minimal signs and no pattern bruising similar to the one observed on jejunum.\n\nConclusions: The burst injuries of jejunum in children are very rare and this finding is observed in road traffic accidents or in child abuse. In our case the burst injury was determined by a violent blunt trauma. The external signs were too few to suspect the severe injuries observed “under the skin”. In abdominal injury, the force applied to the abdominal wall is typically dissipated so that the skin is minimally involved while the underlying solid organ absorbs the force and ruptures. In case of child abuse suspect, the visceral injuries should always be considered and excluded due to their high rate of existing in fatal events.\n\nPP-020\n\nInterviewing child sexual abuse victims: Police officers’ experiences about the phenomena\n\nDilek Celik 1, Ahsen Kaya2, Burak Gonultas3, Murat Kocak3, Gokhan Oral2\n\n1Istanbul University, Institute of Forensic Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n2Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n3Istanbul Police Department, Juvenile Justice Department, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nBackground: Alleged child sexual abuse cases are highly sensitive and complicated phenomena, since the testimony of the child is often the only evidence at hand and the quality of child’s testimony leads to prosecution process. Police officers are one of the main figures among professionals working in legal context since they are integral part of the investigation team about the allegations. The aim of the present study is to determine some of the characteristics of police officers, who interview child victims as well as some of the characteristics of alleged child sexual abuse cases and investigative interviewing process in Istanbul. In addition, police officers’ beliefs about the credibility of children and their self-evaluated competence as an interviewer are examined.\n\nMethod: The participants were 51 police officers, working with children in various different regions of Istanbul. The survey was conducted during the seminar which is a part of a psychosocial support project for sexual abuse victims organized by Istanbul Special Provincial Administration. The survey was approved by the General Directorate of Security and the participation rests on a voluntary bases. The data was analyzed in SPSS 20.0 program.\n\nResults: Among 51 participants, 46 of them are males and 5 of them are females. The mean age of participants is 30.4. Mean of working period in Security Department is 6.9 years, while mean of working period as police officers in Child Department is 2.8 years. Forty-three percent of the participants involved in interview of child victims more than 20 times. Thirty-nine percent of them mentioned each interview, takes approximately 30–60 minutes. Sixty-one percent of them mentioned that it takes 12 to 24 hours to deliver the file to the prosecutor's office. Most of them (72.5 %) stated that they interview the victim more than once. It is found that the year of working as child police officer is positively correlated with believing in child victims’ credibility and self-evaluated investigation competence. However, year of working as child police officer is not related with self-evaluated communication skills with children.\n\nConclusion: One of the most striking finding of the study is the difference between the length of interview process of the child victim and the length of the prosecutors’ office delivery process. Another point is that, the working period in Child Department did not facilitate the self-evaluated communication skills. It should be concluded that there is a need for communication skills support programs for police officers.\n\nPP-021\n\nStepsibling Incest Resulting In Pregnancy And Delivery: A Case Report\n\nMuhammed Mehtar 1, Muhlis Yıldız2, Muhammet Demir2\n\n1Council of Forensic Medicine, VI Board, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n2Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nIntroduction: Although sibling incest is thought as the most common form of incest abuse and is predicted to occur almost 5 times more than father/stepfather incest, literature is inadequate regarding this subject (1,2,9,10). Our knowledge is restricted to father/stepfather and daughter/stepdaughter incest (11). Due to limited empirical research, sibling sexual abuse definition suffered certain inconsistencies: “sexual interaction beyond age appropriate exploration” (6), “sexual behavior between siblings that is not age appropriate, not transitory, and not motivated by developmentally appropriate curiosity” (7), or “when the older sibling is 5 or more years senior to the younger sibling or when force is used no matter what the age difference” (3). Some authors mentioned sibling incest to be less harmful than father/stepfather incest while others claimed that ≥5 years of age difference between siblings causes more harm (1,4,8). Sibling incest was also noted by some authors to be as harmful as father/stepfather incest (5). No information on stepsibling incest was found.\n\nCase: Girl (8 years 6 months old) started living with her mother, stepfather and stepbrother (9 years 7 months old) in a 2 bedroom flat and was sharing her bedroom with her stepbrother. After few months, explorative sexual contact with her stepbrother took place and continued for a course of 2 years beyond her mother and stepfather knowledge. When she reached 11 years 5 months of age, her stepbrother assaulted her and sexual penetration took place to later continue his abuse repeatedly by threatening her until she got pregnant with 7 months when her mother had knowledge of the abuse. Delivery took place when she was 13 years 5 months of age and her stepbrother was proved to be the father by DNA analysis. She was assessed thoroughly 3 days after delivery by a university psychiatric council and diagnosed with Major Depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. Another evaluation was made at our Council of Forensic Medicine 3 years 6 months after delivery and she was diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Dysthymia and Borderline mental capacity according to DSM-IV criteria.\n\nConclusion: Sibling incest, whether biological or non-biological, is an insidious problem that should be addressed thoroughly as major consequences might emerge. Age difference should not be considered a main factor in implying the impact of sibling incestuous relationships and age appropriate sexual interaction should carefully be monitored.\n\nPP-022\n\nInfant neglect – a forensic and legal emergency\n\nAlexandra Enache1, Alexandra Mercescu2, Veronica Ciocan1, Bogdan Enache1, Fotios Chatzinikolaou 3\n\n1University of Medicine and Pharmacy Victor Babeş Timisoara, Romania\n\n2Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University, PhD student\n\n3Aristotle University, Lab of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Thessaloniki, Greece\n\nAim: to highlight the urgency of the forensic examination and of the legal procedures in case of intentional trauma inflicted upon an infant\n\nMaterials-methods: casuistic analysis of the forensic examinations on the basis of the gravity of inflicted lesions criteria at the request of the police.\n\nResults and discussions: of the 173 forensic examinations requested by the police for minors, 12 were cases of young children between 0 and 5 years old (on a period of 3 years). The trauma was recent in 78 % of the cases and old or of different aging in 22 % of the cases. We have identified excoriations, ecchymosis, erosions, hematoma and fractures, thus the gravity of the lesions varies from minor to major lesions which required hospitalization and emergency treatment. A special case was of a 6 weeks old infant, admitted in the emergency room with the following diagnostic: acute cranio-cerebral traumatism, open fracture of the right humerus, thoracic traumatism, abdominal traumatism, suspect of human aggression, Silverman syndrome, long oblique punctiform open fracture 1/3 distal diaphysis right humerus, massive hematoma right arm, abdominal concussion, multiple ecchymosis (face, torso, abdomen), ocular concussion left eye. Legal inquiry was focused on the method of producing the trauma (direct injury or falling), the objects which could produce the fracture and the concussions, how many days of medical treatment were required, if the life of the minor was endangered. By corroborating the clinical, investigative and forensic data it has been noted that the lesions require 50 days of medical treatment and that they did not endanger the life of the victim. However, we are of the opinion that, in relation to the age and vulnerability of the victims, the legislation should further protect this category by applying more severe punishment.\n\nConclusions: We have established that the trauma inflicted upon the minors were of varied gravity and age and produced repeatedly. The aggressed minors represent medical, forensic and implicitly legal emergencies. These cases require complex documentations and investigations with careful conservation of the evidence.\n\nPP-023\n\nChild’s Death from Physical Abuse: A Case Report\n\nVeysi Asoğlu , Esra Özgün Ünal, Gözde Şirin, Bülent Şam\n\nCouncil of Forensic Medicine, Department of Morgue, İstanbul, Turkey\n\nMedical records; medical history was taken from father. 1 year, 8 months girl, father brought her to hospital because of sudden developed cyanosis and pulmonary depression that happens while she was eating. İn the hospital she was entubated because of pulmonary arrest and sent to another hospital with an ICU.\n\nMedical background; 1.5 months ago her leg was broken while he was playing with her brother/sister\n\nPhysical examination; physical progress is 10–25 percentile, she was not conscious, her general situation was bad, she was hypothermic and pale, there were a lot of differently aged ecchymoses on her face, neck, arms and trunk, a combustion scar on her left hand, deformity due to broke on her left leg, on cranial CT, multiple subarchnoidal hemorrhage areas, on X-Rays on the left fibula diaphyses broken section that is started to heal and there were no special finding at gynaecologic examination. On the 12th day of treatment brain death occurs and on the 13th day she died. Thinking of the findings are concordant to child abuse, the situation was denounced to the government and autopsy was requested\n\nAt the autopsy; beside the physical examination findings, we found hemorrhagic areas under the scalp, suture disintegration due to intracranial pressure, generalize subarachnoidal hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage with neomembrane contusion, hemorrhage in pons, left optic nerve fiber and retina, partially healed broken area and callus formation on left fibula and tibia.\n\nIn conclusion; the death was reported occurred of intracerebral hemorrhage and complications due to blunt head trauma. consideration of the autopsy findings and medical records the case is compatible to child abuse. This case includes typical, clinically diagnosed and confirmed by an autopsy, findings of child abuse, and worth to be presented to emphasize the correlation of clinical and forensic approach\n\nPP-024\n\nComplexity in a case of child sexual abuse: Girl to girl sexual abuse with an atypical foreign object (mascara)\n\nFuat Kircelli 1, Zafer Liman2, Erdinc Ozdemir2, Husrev Demirel2, Ergul Fidan Kircelli3\n\n1Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Insitute of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n2Department of Forensic Medicine, Insitute of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n3Department of Psychiatry, Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nBackground: Child sexual abuse is defined as a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent engages in sexual activity with a minor or exploits a minor for the purpose of sexual gratification. Majority of the victims is female; the act is mostly repetitive, affects all parts of the society and often kept secret by the victim. In this case, we report a complex case of child sexual abuse, where three girls, staying at a dormitory, with similar ages and having a history of previous sexual, physical and emotional abuse were involved in an atypical sexual abuse.\n\nCase: Three adolescent girls; one being the victim (17 years old) and the other two being the offenders (18 year-old), staying at a dormitory of the Social Services and Child Protection Service, was seen at the outpatient clinic to assess their mental health in a case of an atypical foreign object insertion (mascara) into the vagina by the offenders. 4 other girls staying at the same dormitory were also involved. Anamnesis revealed a prior sexual abuse in all 7 girls. After clinical interview, post-traumatic stress disorder and dissociative experiences scales were applied to all actors. Mental capacity was determined by clinical evaluation and psychometric tests. The victim was identified to have mild mental retardation and post-traumatic stress disorder, whereas the offender had anti-social personality, normal mental capacity and a post-traumatic stress disorder due to the previous history of physical and sexual abuse.\n\nConclusion: The children with a prior history of sexual abuse have later the tendency to become victims or offenders. This case shows that girls may also exert antisocial behaviours that develop in parallel to previous physical and sexual abuse which is mostly observed in boys. Dormitories, by influencing interactions between previous victims and offenders, may also be contributing to the occurrence of sexual abuses. Close follow-up of the cases staying at dormitories with a prior history of physical and sexual abuse seems to be very important in prevention of cases such as the one presented in this report.\n\nPP-025\n\nSexually abused victims with intellectual disability\n\nSefer Bilgi1, Nesime Yaycı 1, Mehmet Akif Inanici1, Emrullah Tolga Dagli2\n\n1Department of Forensic Medicine, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n2Department of Pediatric Surgery, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nChildren with any kinds of disability are more than twice as likely to be physically and almost twice as likely to be sexually abused as children without disabilities. We prefer to use of terminology instead of mental retardation as still label by many in the public. The claims of the victims with intellectual disabilities are unlikely to be reported to authorities and also they are viewed defectively in terms of cognitive abilities but positively in terms of trustworthiness and honesty.\n\nIn this study we examined the characteristics of the sexually abused five victims with intellectual disabilities that we assessed at the Child Protection Center of Marmara University Pendik Hospital, Istanbul. They all underwent legal interview, child psychiatric consultation and WISC-R testing.\n\nThe victims are all girls between 13–17 years old. Three of them are borderline limited intellectual disability, one of them is mildly limited intellectual disability and the other is moderately limited one.\n\nThe forms of abuse are penetration anal and/or vaginal. All of them were abused more than once and by more than one abuser. The type of sexual abuse is more severe in cases with intellectual disability. This vulnerable group of adolescents deserves a special interest of health workers.\n\nPP-026\n\nMultidisciplinary child protection: Making decision about child abuse\n\nAhsen Kaya 1, Mehmet Altinok1, Ozlem Melek Kolusayin1, Beytullah Karadayi1, Dilek Celik2, Alaz Ozbek2, Abdi Ozaslan1, Gökhan Oral1, Gursel Cetin1, Coskun Yorulmaz1\n\n1Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Department of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n2Istanbul University, Institute of Forensic Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nBackground: In recent years, awareness of child abuse and neglect has been increased in Turkey. The work with abused children involves several courses of action between institutions, namely as to the starting procedures to follow reporting of suspicion, diagnosis and preservation of evidence for penal purposes, as well as to the protection of the victim(s), all of which still lack a clear procedure. Several institutes often take part simultaneously in these early procedures and it is crucial that their own personal intervention be articulated with one another’s. The mission of Children’s protection Unit of Department of Forensic Medicine, Cerrahpasa Medical School is to reduce the emotional trauma to child abuse victims by facilitating a multidisciplinary team approach, which supports the prevention of child abuse through community education and promotes the effective prosecution of those who perpetrate crimes against children. In this study, it is aimed to share experience of Cerrahpasa Medical School.\n\nMethod: It is observed that the explanation of the High Court and the Prosecutors and Judges High Council in Turkey since 2012 which tells examinations of child abuse and other kind of violence cases can be done in universities which have a mirrored room and multidisciplinary team.\n\nResults: Turkish Criminal Procedure Code, which has been changed, gives a chance to the different perspective of expert and expertise system. That change has brought new hope for the protection and reporting of abused children. The legal authorities’ decision reporting that they have been accepting the universities' Department of Forensics medicine as legal expertise institution and also giving priority considers a milestone decision. Because in these institutions including the investigation phase all the legal and medicolegal processes can be settled. After the text, the number of cases admitted to our department has increased surprisingly. This situation is a cornerstone for the beginning of the change for the universities which hasn't found their desired position in the expertise system.\n\nConclusion: The decision to verify child abuse allegations requires simultaneous consideration of a specified level of evidence of abuse, the severity of harm a child experienced, and in some jurisdictions, the risk of harm to a child. The decision making process is complex and the resultant recommendations multidisciplinary protection team make about services or court involvement may have significant implications for the immediate and long term functioning and safety of a family.\n\nCLINICAL FORENSIC MEDICINE\n\nPP-027\n\nWork-related disability among Egyptian workers\n\nAmany Salah Mohammad 1, Hoda Abdel Megeid El Ghamry1, Dina Soliman Badran1, Mohammad El Hafez Nouri2\n\n1Forensic Medicine and Clinical Toxicology Department, Faculty of Medicine – Cairo University\n\n2Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health, Sudan\n\nBackground: Work-related injuries involve a great number of workers, especially young people at productive age all over the world. They are highly disabling, leading to major social and economic consequences. Thorough knowledge of the trends of workplace disabilities is essential for the development of strategies to better assessment and fair judgment.\n\nThe aim of this work was to study cases of disability in workplaces presented to the forensic medicine authority in Cairo, Ministry of Justice during 2 years (2008 and 2009) and to evaluate the disability rating percentage.\n\nMethods: This is a retrospective study based on the data obtained from reports written by Medico Legal Experts (MLE) for workplace disability victims who were presented to the Medico-legal Administration Department of Cairo, Ministry of Justice during the years; 2008 and 2009. These data were then submitted to statistical analysis.\n\nResults: There were a total of 142 cases of workplace disabilities in different establishments. Most cases lie between 18 and 34 years of age. Limitation of joint movements was the most frequent type of injury (49.3 %), followed by fractures and nerve, tendon or muscle injuries (26.8 % for each). Caught by a machine was the most frequent event (40 %), followed by falls/slips (20 %). Hands were the most affected part of the body (28.2 %). After assessment by MLE, the highest number of workplace disabilities fell in the 0 to 20 % range, and presented in 86 victims (60.6 %). Disabilities due to falls/slips and being hit by an object scored the highest rating percentages. Of all current study cases, general establishments recorded 89.2 % where private ones were only 10.8 %.\n\nConclusion: In Egypt, the accurate and reliable recording system for cases of work-injuries is still lacking. There is a clear need for better and more reliable data on the nature, causes and extent of injuries.\n\nPP-028\n\nA case report on writing sample of a paranoid schizophrenia patient who reduced a word to a single letter\n\nNabi Kantarcı , Feruh Baklacıoğlu, Eyüp Kandemir, Esat Şahin\n\nAdli Tıp Kurumu\n\nIn this case, the court file, that was interviewed in the Civil Court of First Instance and sent to Physics Specialization Department Document Review Branch of Forensic Medicine Institution with the aim of signature study, has been investigated. In the court file, there is committee report that states the paranoid schizophrenia, arranged by the Commune State Hospital regarding the complainant. The complainant knows how to write a letter of application to the court as of form, considering the establishment that the complainant was retired. He typewrites the letters of applications. In 2010, throughout the year he submitted 16 petitions to the court of the case, and the petitions were initialized by the Chief Judge and put to the court file. In the filed petitions, it was seen that there is a lack of meaning unity between the sentences. It was also seen that, without being based on a specific norm, some word’s initial letter was capitalized and made dots on both ends of the word. Moreover, it was seen that the petitions were underlined by yellow, red, blue, purple, pink, orange and green lead pencils. As a conclusion, on the writing samples belonging to our case, racing thoughts mentioned in the previous studies and also that is seen on schizophrenia patients. Together with the absurd patterns of behavior, for the first time we have been encountered with an absurd pattern of reducing the word to a letter and making a dots on the right and especially left side of the word. We think that the ascertained characteristic has a diagnostic value for the schizophrenia illness.\n\nPP-029\n\nEpidemiological Study of post traumatic orofacial damage based on Portuguese Civil, Criminal and Labor Laws\n\nPatricia Santos1, Jorge Costa Santos2, Cristiana Palmela Pereira 2\n\n1Faculty of Dental Medicine at the University of Lisbon\n\n2South Delegation, Portuguese Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the type of orofacial injuries found in reports of Clinical Forensic of South Delegation from Medico Legal Institute, in Portugal, between 2005 and 2009, based on Civil, Criminal and Labor Law.\n\nThe final objectives were, determine: (1) the most frequent types of trauma, (2) the orofacial areas most affected, (3) the prevalence of orofacial lesions/sequelae, (4) the average number of disabilities evaluated or period of illness from those, based on Civil, Criminal and Labor Law.\n\nMaterials-methods: This retrospective study was conducted entirely in Clinical Forensic of South Delegation from INML. The target population consisted of the victims of preliminary, interlayer and final reports of the clinical forensic procedures carried out between 2005 and 2009. The population sample comprised a total of 1422 victims of both sexes, without restriction of age, of whom 232 had suffered some type of orofacial injury.\n\nAll the variables were defined according to the authors to discriminated the lesions/sequelae of orofacial area.\n\nResults and conclusions: The most common trauma was the facial (54 %), followed by oro-facial (15 %). The most frequent injuries/sequelae were: Scars (27.91 %), excoriations (15.05 %) and ecchymosis (8.25 %).\n\nPP-030\n\nPrevalence of gang rapes in Mthatha area of South Africa\n\nBanwari Lal Meel\n\nDepartment of Forensic Medicine, Walter Sisulu University, Mthatha 5117, South Africa\n\nBackground: Gang rape is one of the most conspicuous forms of violence and has reached epidemic proportions in South Africa. It occurs in all spheres of society and all women are potential victims.\n\nObjectives: To determine the prevalence of gang rapes in the Transkei region of South Africa.\n\nMethods: This one-year retrospective study focused on all cases of gang rape reported by complainants over 16 years at Sinawe Rape Crisis Center in Umtata General Hospital during January 2008 to December 2008. Recorded details included the age, addresses, number of perpetrators, relation with perpetrator and physical violence.\n\nResult: There were 379 cases of rape recorded. Of this, 63 (16.6 %) were gang rapes. Majority 181 (47.8 %) were between the age of 16 and 20 years. The highest number 30 (47.6 %) were in the area of Mthatha followed by Tsolo 9 (14.3 %), Engocobo 9 (14.3 %), and Libode 7 (11.1 %). In majority 47 (74.6 %) of victims had two perpetrators, 10(15.8 %) had three perpetrators, and 3 (4.8 %) had four perpetrators. Most of the perpetrators 44 (69.8 %) were not know to the victims. Most of the gang rapes were part of robbery and take place at victim home.\n\nConclusion: There is a high prevalence of gang rape in Mthatha area of South Africa.\n\nPP-031\n\nA comparative study of HIV sero-prevalence between nulliparous and parous women of the reproductive age who attended the Sinawe Centre, Mthatha, South Africa in 2005\n\nBanwari Lal Meel\n\nDepartment of Forensic Medicine, Walter Sisulu University, Mthatha 5117, South Africa\n\nThe aim of this study is to compare the sero-prevalence of HIV between nulliparous and parous women who attended the Sinawe Center following sexual abuse. A record review of victims of sexual abuse who presented to the center at Mthatha (Umtata) Hospital.\n\nSix hundred and eighty five females attended the centre between 1st January and 31st December 2005. Of this, 268 had testing for HIV done, and 72 (26.8 %) were found to be positive. The highest number of positives, 30 (11.2 %) were between 21 and 25 years. There were 160 (59.7 %) nulliparous women with 30 (11.1 %) being HIV positive, and 108 (40.3 %) parous women with 42(15.7 %) positive. Among the nulliparae the highest positivity, 17 (6.3 %) was in the 16 to 20 year age group while in the parous women it was in the 21–25 year 26 (9.7 %) age group. There is a higher prevalence of HIV among parous women than in nulliparae who attended the Sinawe Centre.\n\nPP-032\n\nA Drowning Case Including Mother And Her Own Children's Homicide-Suicide\n\nKenan Karbeyaz 1, Harun Akkaya2, Yasemin Balcı3\n\n1Council Of Forensic Medicine, Eskisehir Branch Manager, Eskisehir, Turkey\n\n2Council Of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n3Department Of Forensic Science, Mugla University, Faculty Of Medicine, Mugla, Turkey\n\nIntroduction: Homicide-suicide, is a relatively common in forensic medicine literature. Homicide-suicide is more common among family members. The Murderers are men, while victims are usually women and firearm is most commonly used instrument. There are rare cases of homicide-suicide by drowning for both murderer and victim or victims.\n\nAim: In this study, the mother who committed suicide by throwing herself into the water after murdering her two children by also throwing them into water is aimed to present.\n\nThe case/cases: A 25 years old mother who had been married for six years, killed her two children ( one of them is 5-years-old and the other is six months old) by throwing them into the water, and she also committed suicide by jumping into the water. The event took place by the river that pass through the park in the city. Her husband couldn't receive any news from his wife since the morning of the event, and stated that he found a suicide letter in his wife's bag. Eyewitnesses told that a man, a woman and two children chatted for a long time, then man leaved the park, women and children wandered around the river for a while, then the corpse of a woman and two children were seen in the evening of the day of the event. Postmortem toxicological and histopathologic examination showed that the cause of deaths was mechanical asphyxia due to suffocation in all three cases. According to the investigation file, the family migrated from the southeast region of Turkey and they had low socioeconomic levels, and it is determined that the husband was in prison for a period of time in the past.\n\nConclusion: The case of the mother who committed suicide by throwing herself into the water after murdering her two children by throwing them into water is a rare condition. The case is interesting for the manner of deaths and the reasons leading the mother to suicide and murder her children in terms of discussion.\n\nPP-033\n\nLegal Cases’ Evaluations in Terms of Public Health\n\nGülçin Yapıcı1, Nursel Gamsız Bilgin 2\n\n1Department of Public Health, Mersin University, School of Medicine, Mersin, Turkey\n\n2Department of Forensic Medicine, Mersin University, School of Medicine, Mersin, Turkey\n\nPurpose: Injury is identified as physical damage in human body due to a suddenly rising energy level. Our purpose in this study is to determine injury types and the causes of injury and to evaluate the injury’s results in term of public health.\n\nMethod: Mersin University Medical Faculty Forensic Medicine Department’s legal reports of year 2010 were evaluated for this descriptive study. Besides cases’ demographic features such as age, sexuality, home cities, some other features were obtained such as causes of injury, injury style, date and place of injury, injured body part, the hospitalization need due to injury, clinics where injured patients were hospitalized (if any), hospitalization duration. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation and in percentages.\n\nResults: There are 1042 reported legal injury cases in 2010. 67.7 % of them (n = 705) are male, 32.3 % are female, average age is 26.6 ± 16.8. Injuries occurred generally due to traffic accidents (%28.7), sharp objects (%15.3), assault (%14.5) and poisoning (%13.4). Injuries occurred mostly in streets (%30.9), and in or around house (%24.1). The most injured body parts were face (%30.5), arm (%16.2), head (%15.9) and leg (%15.3). 61.3 % of patients who applied to hospital (n = 639) were treated in emergency clinics and there were no need to hospitalize. When we evaluate injuries in terms of sexuality; the first place belongs to traffic accidents (both for males and females), second place belongs to poison for females and sharp objects for males. When we evaluate the reasons of injuries; the ranking is accidents, interpersonal violence and suicides respectively for women while the same ranking for accident, interpersonal violence and industrial accidents respectively for men. The evaluation in terms of age groups; accident is first ranked reason for every age group. Suicide was determined from the 10th age and seen most frequently between 15-19th years for females. Suicide was determined in females 5–8 times more than males in all of age groups.\n\nConclusion: Accidents and interpersonal violence were first two reasons of injury of males and females. The first protection method for injuries in traffic accidents was prevention from accidents. If it is not possible to prevent, injury’s prevention is other precaution. Public trainings must be organized in these topics. Besides, families must receive consultancy about girls’ tendency to self damages in especially adolescent era.\n\nPP-034\n\nEvaluation of Sciatic Nerve Injury Cases at the Department of Forensic Medicine Between 2002 to 2011\n\nMustafa Talip Sener 1, Muhammed Ziya Kir2, Sadik Sahingoz1, Yuksel Anci1, Ahmet Nezih Kok1\n\n1Department of Forensic Medicine of Medicine Faculty of University of Ataturk, Erzurum\n\n2Branch of Council of Forensic Medicine, Erzurum\n\nIntroduction: Sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body is composed of the peroneal and tibial branches. Sciatic nerve injuries may occur as a result of traumatic events, and on the other hand may occur in result of medical interventions during the injections.\n\nAim and method: 16. 827 cases were analyzed between 2002–2011 retrospectively. Sciatic nerve injury in total 21 cases were evaluated. Cases were examined for demographic data such as gender, age, number of cases, event type, EMG and examination findings.\n\nFindings and result: Of the cases, 19 (95 %) were male and 2 (5 %) were female. 2 cases (9.5 %) were sent by Patrol, 18 cases (85.7 %) were sent by Chief Public Prosecutor, and 1 cases (4.8 %) were sent by the Court. In 1 case (4.8 %) was not recorded age, in 1 case (4.8 %) was in 0–10 age group, in 3 cases (14.8 %) were in 11–20 age group, in 6 cases (28.6 %) were in 21–30 age group, in 4 cases(19 %) were in 31–40 age group, in 4 cases (19 %) were in 51–60 age group, in 2 cases (9.5 %) were in 70 + age groups were determined. In 2 cases (9.5 %) were not recorded event type, in 10 cases (47.6 %) were determined injection, in 5 cases (23.8 %) were determined stab wound, and in 4 cases (19 %) were determined gunshot wounds. In EMG reports, 10 cases (47.6 %) were identified tibial-peroneal nerve injury, 4 cases (19 %) were identified sciatic nerve injury, 5 cases (23.8 %) were identified peroneal nerve injury and 2 cases (9.5 %) were normal EMG recorded. During the examination in 7 cases (33.3 %) were detected foot drop, in 8 cases (38.1 %) were detected dorsiflexion or plantar flexion weakness, in 2 cases (9.5 %) were detected normal findings on examination, and in 4 patients (19 %) were not mentioned the findings of the inspection.\n\nDiscussion: Intramuscular injections are often performed by medical staff of medical interventions. In our study, more than half of the cases with sciatic nerve injury were observed the emergence of an intramuscular injection, raises the question whether these injuries is defective behavior of medical staff. To minimize and eliminate the intramuscular injection of sciatic nerve damage due to defective behavior of medical staff, intramuscular injection to be made the authorized persons, in appropriate circumstances and accurate localization is a basic requirement.\n\nPP-035\n\nSexual Assault Cases in Department of Forensic Medicine in Erzurum\n\nMustafa Talip Şener 1, Sadik Sahingoz1, Yuksel Anci1, Muhammed Ziya Kir2, Ahmet Nezih Kok1\n\n1Department of Forensic Medicine of Medicine Faculty of University of Ataturk, Erzurum\n\n2Branch of Council of Forensic Medicine, Erzurum\n\nIntroduction: Sexual assault is defined as any unwanted sexual act in which a person is threatened, coerced, or forced to engage against their will, or any sexual touching (rape, inappropriate touching, forced kissing, child sexual abuse, or the torture of the victim in a sexual manner) of a person who has not consented.\n\nAim and method: In the present research we aimed to define sexual assault cases according to determined parameters retrospectively at Department of Forensic Medicine of Ataturk University, at year of 2011.\n\nFindings and result: One hundred and seventeen cases of sexual assault were evaluated. Of the cases 37 (31.6 %) were male and 80 (68.4 %) were female. The age range of cases were from 4 to 60 years. 75 cases (64.1 %) were in 11–20 age group. Of the cases 106 (90.6 %) were healthy with no mental problems and 11 (9.4 %) were mental retardation. The offender was known by the victim in 96 (82.1 %) cases. 40 (34.2 %) occurred in the cases or offender's home. There were not examination in 74 cases (63.2 %). The incidence of positive sign of anal penetration was 7 cases (6 %). In 14 cases (12 %) were suffered vaginal intercourse and in 22 cases (18.8 %) were not positive sign of anal or vaginal penetration. Based on psychiatric examinations, in 59 cases (50.4 %) were normal psychiatric signs, in 17 cases (14.5 %) were diagnosed post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the other cases were diagnosed other psychiatric illness.\n\nDiscussion: In our study, the majority of cases of sexual assault were earlier adolescent girls between the ages of 11–20 as well as many studies made before and the offenders were family relatives, neighbors and also previously recognized by the cases. Cases of exposed to sexual or physical attack are exist psychiatric signs such as depression, PTSD, anxiety and sexual dysfunction. In this study, nearly half of the cases of were diagnosed psychiatric disorders such as depression, PTSD and anxiety. Sexual assault is one of the most severe trauma due to the negative effects of both physical and mental signs. A significant portion of the cases are not reported to judicial authorities. We suggest that to prevent sexual assault, individuals be made aware of this issue, the events were reported earlier and support for the cases to the negative effects of sexual assault such as psychological and physical trauma\n\nPP-036\n\nThe role of the Forensic Pathologist: from the lifting body to the forensic report writing\n\nLaidaoui Zeddam Dalila , Sbaihi Cherouat Atika, Mostefaoui Azzedine, Merah Fatiha\n\nUniversity Hospital Center Beni Messous\n\nThe role of the pathologist is usually subordinate to the judicial process which is developed in three steps:\n\n1. The research and establishment of the crime or offense which requires frequent intervention by the forensic pathologist in the case of attempt on the life, injury, murder, poisoning.\n\nForensic operations are intended to determine the nature of the fact and its judicial criminal cause and include:\n\nThe lifting body, autopsy, toxicology, histopathological, and bacteriology.\n\n2. Research of the agent of the offense involves the study of pieces of evidence, trace evidence and that means the implementation of the capacity of police and legal medicine laboratories.\n\n3. The drafting of the forensic report is a summary of the facts leading to conclusions, when the establishment of guilt, it belongs to the magistrate responsibility.\n\nPP-037\n\nA Murderer or Victim? The Importance of Differentiation of Suicidal/Homicidal Sharp Force Injuries: Case report\n\nUgur Kayhan , Yalçın Büyük, Fatih Şahin, Burak Hakkı Erkılınç, Ümit Naci Gündoğmuş\n\nCouncil of Legal Medicine\n\nThe determination of the manner of death in general and the differentiation between homicidal and suicidal sharp force injuries in particular is a major issue in forensic medicine. Actually sharp force is a rare method of suicide constituting only 2–3 % of all suicides in various countries. In a case with multiple, deep, lethal stab wounds, it may be easy to define the mode of death, but in some other cases it may not be so easy. The classical criteria for discriminating self-inflicted fatal sharp force trauma from homicide are generally considered as follows: (1) several injuries are observed on the possible sites of self-infliction; (2) hesitation marks are present; (3) clothing injuries are present. In spite of these facts, there are many case reports showing unusual features in the literature.\n\nSelf-inflicted sharp force trauma may, in some other cases, be a part of a scenario aiming to deceive legal authorities. The perpetrator may injure him in order to show him as the murder of the incident.\n\nA 58 years-old man who is the suspect of murder of his wife was referred to Council of Forensic Medicine for medico-legal evaluation of his wounds claimed to be inflicted by himself in order to accuse the decedent as the perpetrator. Crime scene findings, hospital records, autopsy report of the victim, nature of the wounds of both victim and the suspect were all evaluated and presented.\n\nPP-038\n\nDeath in Emergencies: Confrontation Diagnoses Emergency Physician – Forensic Pathologist\n\nMohamed Allouche 1, Nédia Boudriga2, Mongi Zhioua1, Moncef Hamdoun1, Béchir Bouhejja2\n\n1Service de Médecine Légale de Tunis, Hôpital Charles Nicolle\n\n2Service des urgences et de SMUR, Hôpital Régional de Ben Arous\n\nIntroduction: The autopsy is an indispensable diagnostic tool to understanding the causes and mechanisms of death like to the improvement of the quality of care. In every case of violent, suspect and sudden death, an autopsy is required.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to confront the diagnosis established by the emergency physician and that of the forensic scientist.\n\nMaterial-method: Retrospective study including all the patients' deaths admitted in emergencies of Ben Arous's regional Hospital between May 2009 and December 2010. For each patient: age, sex, histories, symptomatology before the death, means of transport, pre and intra-hospital resuscitation, the attitude of the family, were collected. For each death, a diagnosis was established by the emergency physician.\n\nResults: 112 deaths are included. The average age of dead patients was of 52.6 years. A sex ratio was 1.7. Patients presented pathological antecedents in 76 cases (66 %). Patients joined emergencies by their own means in 81 cases, by emergency services 26 cases. The pre-hospitable resuscitation was undertaken for 10 patients. The intra-hospital resuscitation was tried for 94 patients.\n\nThe attitude of the family was acceptance in 51 cases, a usual crisis of mourning in 44 cases, a verbal aggression in 13 cases and a physical aggression in 1 case.\n\nIn 37.5 % case the autopsy was not required in spite of the obligation to sign on the medical certificate of death, the presence of a medico-legal obstacle to the burial. The main reasons are pathological antecedents of the victim, absence of traumatic injury on the body and advanced age.\n\nThe diagnostic concordance was perfect in all cases of traumatic deaths. In 15 % of the cases (12 victims), the diagnosis advanced by the emergency physician was different from the conclusions of the autopsy. These cases concerned young subjects without histories, died suddenly or patients with pathologies difficult to diagnose (myocarditis, aneurism of the abdominal aorta).\n\nConclusion: This study shows that the autopsy diagnosis is of a big contribution for the knowledge of the causes of death in emergencies. A discussion between the forensic scientist and the emergency physician is necessary in case of diagnostic discordance.\n\nPP-039\n\nSudden intraoperatory death during percutaneous vertebroplasty\n\nLuigi Papi 1, Stefania Fornaro1, Tommaso Guerrini1, Ferruccio Po'2, Marco Pieri3\n\n1Department of Legal Medicine – University of Pisa\n\n2Department of Orthopaedic Surgery – University of Pisa\n\n3Department of Anaesthesia – University of Pisa\n\nPercutaneous Vertebroplasty (PV) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure performed in the vertebral collapse treatment, following osteoporosis and others diseases (eg. cancer) associated to severe pain.\n\nThe procedure includes the following: transpeduncolar introduction performed under endoscopic guided, needle-cannula application within the fractured vertebral bodies and subsequent injection of cement bone, typically consisting of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).\n\nThis procedure was first described in France in 1987 for the treatment of an aggressive hemangioma of C2 and subsequently spread throughout the world.\n\nNowadays, we can conclude that there are no reliable data concerning long-term effects and complications due to this procedure, however generally considered as a procedure at minimum risk for major complications.\n\nMoreover, some recent cases reports have highlighted the existence of a minimum risk for cardio-respiratory impairment, sometimes associated to fatal outcomes. This eventuality, from an etiopathogenetic point of view, has been linked to the so-called “Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome”, already known and described in the cemented hip prosthesis implantation.\n\nNonetheless, the pathogenic mechanism of this serious complication, clinically characterized by hypoxia, hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmia, increase in the pulmonary resistance and cardiac arrest, is not yet sufficiently clarified. The predominant scientific approach pays great importance to pulmonary embolism (adipose, bone marrow, cement, bone spicules) but other studies have suggested also other hypothesis, such as the release of histamine or complement activation, with hypotensive effects, or the vasodilatation induced by endogenous cannabinoids, as well as the direct PMMA toxicity.\n\nIn our case, the patient was suffering from multiple vertebral collapse from L1 to L5, thus suggesting a multilevel approach. After the preoperative tests, the patient underwent surgery under local anaesthesia and mild sedation during the cement injection. Nonetheless, since a small intravenous cement diffusion at the level of L3 was produced, the procedure was immediately arrested but the patient presented immediate hypotension and bradycardia followed by irreversible cardiac arrest. At first medico-legal investigation was not ordered, but an autopsy was anyway performed to establish the cause of the death. The autopsy revealed a severe ischemic heart disease, but a later histological examination for medico-legal purpose showed diffuse pulmonary microembolization related to the surgical procedure.\n\nThe literature review and the study of the case point out the need for future clinical observations on the risks, even if statistically low, of major complications in percutaneous vertebroplasty, which should require a specific mention in the informed consent.\n\nPP-040\n\nEvaluation of the delay in execution of the penalty of imprisonment because of diseases\n\nVolkan Ünal , Sadi Çağdır, Yusuf Özer, Uğur Çom\n\nAdli Tıp Kurumu, İstanbul,Turkey\n\nIn our country, delay in the execution of the penalty of imprisonment is defined in the article 16 of Law No 5275 on the execution of penalties and security measures. According to the Law of Council of Forensic Medicine, these cases are sent to 3rd Specialization Board of Council of Forensic Medicine by prosecutor’s offices and their examinations are organized. According to the article 16 of law No 5275; in case of disease, execution continues at the public hospitals’ separated parts for prisoners. However, if the execution risks the convict’s health, execution is delayed until the convict gets better. Delay decision is given by the chief public prosecutor’s office on report prepared by the health committees of general hospitals and approved by Council of Forensic Medicine or prepared by Council of Forensic Medicine.\n\nIn 2011, totally 667 case appealed to 3rd Specialization Board of Council of Forensic Medicine, to benefit by the delay of execution and by our board 14 were evaluated in this context.\n\nWe want to present four cases to show the approach of 3rd Specialization Board of Council of Forensic Medicine. First two cases are the examples of that we were of the opinion that delay in the execution can be given. First one is 47 years old male, he has Multiple Myeloma since November 2010, bone marrow examination after chemotherapy treatment is concordant to remission, as post remission treatment autologus stem cell transplantation is being planned. Second one is, 71 years old male, he has chemotherapy resistant epitheloid mesothelioma diagnosis since February 2010, he has supportive treatment, his general situation was bad.\n\nThese two are the examples of delay in the execution was not approved. First one is 48 years old male, he has decompensed liver cirrhosis secondary to Hepatitis B since June 2011, he has hypersplenism, oesophagus varicosis, hepatosplenomegaly, in our examination, he has sclerotic icterus, second one is 64 years old male, he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, senility, bilateral renal calculi, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss diagnoses,\n\nAs a conclusion, if the diagnosis of the convict is a risk for life contingency or prison conditions are not adequate for treatment or according to medical records cases that do not have the chance to get better are evaluated in terms of delay in the execution.\n\nPP-041\n\nFatal Undiagnosed Pulmonary Hydatid Cyst: A Case Report\n\nMuhammed Ziya Kir , Ufuk Ilingi, Gökmen Karabağ\n\nBranch of Council of Forensic Medicine, Erzurum\n\nIntroduction: Hydatid disease is a parasitosis and is endemic in many sheep-rearing regions in the world especially in the Middle East and the Mediterranean countries. The lungs are the most common sites of infection in children and the liver is the most common site affected in adults. Spontaneous rupture of the hydatid cyst into the peritoneum or pulmonary, which is accompanied by serious morbidity and mortality generally.\n\nCase: A 48-year-old woman was admitted to State Hospital with the complaints of dyspnea. The The pulmonologist was receipted antibiotic and anti-inflammatory tablets and was sent to her to taken her chest graphies. On the same day after she had taken her drugs she was vomiting blood. Then she was taken to the hospital and died in emergency room. Autopsy were done by Director of Forensic Medicine, Erzurum. The post-mortem examination revealed a large cyst (10x5 × 4 cm) in the right lung and there was no daughter vesicle. The histopathological examination of the cyst and lung tissue samples confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary hydatid cyst.\n\nConclusion: Hydatid disease is a serious health problem in endemic areas as well as in Turkey. The diagnosis and appropriate surgical therapy is usually delayed because most of the hydatid cysts remain asymptomatic until it is getting complicated. Treatment of dogs with antihelmintics is the main procedure to control the parasite. In rural areas of Turkey this treatment is not applied routinely. In the rural area, sheep are home-slaughtered routinely. Dogs can access to the infected viscera. Diagnosis of the hydatid cyst is mainly based on ultrasonography and computed tomography. The choice of treatment is still surgical approach in the management of pulmonary hydatid disease. In endemic regions, it is useful to consider hydatid cyst disease for patients with dyspnea admitted to the emergency room. Rupture of the hydatid cyst may be fatal.\n\nPP-042\n\nA case of toxic shock due to clandestine medical abortion\n\nNatalia Minelli1, Francesca Cittadini 1, Letizia Caradonna1, Francesco Ausania1, Riccardo Rossi1, Giovanni Loyola2\n\n1Institute of Forensic Medicine, Catholic University, School of Medicine, Rome Italy\n\n2Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Sant’Eugenio Hospital, Rome Italy\n\nBackground: Unsafe abortion is one of the least documented reproductive health problems and, not coincidentally, it's difficult to document.\n\nMillions women worldwide still have an unsafe termination of pregnancy each year, resulting in estimated 66500 deaths in countries with restrictive abortion laws, largely among the most vulnerable women, such as the poor, the unmarried and the young women.\n\nWe encountered a case of septic shock due to misoprostol induction of labor at 9.2 weeks in a 42 year old white woman (gravida 10, para 10). She died 6 days after she ingested 12 tablets of 200 mg of oral misoprostol, illegally prescribed, without prophylactic antibiotics.\n\nHer symptoms included uterine haemorrhage, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and diarrhoea on day 2 when she was hospitalized with anaemia (Hb 10.6 g/dl), pancitopenia (1,92 white cells/mm3, 69 plaquetes/mm3), with lack of fever. Revision of uterine cavity and curettage were performed due to minor retained necrotic decidua. After repeated haemostatics and uterotonics she died.\n\nMethod: Autopsy and histological examination were performed.\n\nResults: It was proved that the woman died from septic shock. Lung findings were mononuclear cell infiltration, thick alveolar septae, intraalveolar haemorrhage. The other findings were congested pulmonary blood vessels, pulmonary oedema, cytomegaly, fibrin accumulation and formation of eosinophilic membrane.\n\nConclusion: Administration of mifepristone in combination with misoprostol, a prostaglandin analogue, is currently the most widely used regimen for medical abortion approved by World Health Organization and it is a safe and efficient alternative to the surgical abortion method.\n\nThe risk of serious complication is exceptionally low compared with other medical interventions, and very few patients require emergency referral. After medical abortion, prophylactic antibiotics should be administered because of reports of serious infection.\n\nCommon practice is that women administer misoprostol themselves at home, handling the treatment and most stages of the termination process themselves.\n\nThe importance of this case concerns the question of real public access to information regarding abortion as a clinical procedure and the specific obligations related to the part of health care professionals. Although improvements in technology and changed perspectives on rights had an impact on the abortion debate, remain crucial the significant disparities and inequities in access even within health systems that provide basic health coverage for all.\n\nIn the meantime physicians providers of abortion care play an important role: prevent fatal injury through knowledge of the common clinical toxic shock after medical abortions and advanced postabortion care.\n\nPP-043\n\nDomestic Violence Assault versus non-Domestic Violence Assault: a retrospective study of Criminal Law reports in the Centre of Portugal (2008–2010)\n\nDaniel André Martins Henriques , César Santos, Gonçalo Castanheira, Rita Sanches, Graça Costa, Francisco Corte Real\n\nCentre Branch of the Portuguese National Legal Medicine Institute\n\nDomestic violence is contemplated in the Portuguese Criminal Law Code since 2000. According to the Portuguese Association for Victim Support (APAV), in Portugal, during the year of 2010, there were a total of 16972 domestic violence complaints, a number that increased in 2011 to 18470. It represents 31.7 % of all Criminal Law exams underwent in the Centre Branch of the Portuguese National Legal Medicine Institute (INML, I.P.), during a three year time lapse (2008–2010).\n\nThis study has the objective to compare the victims, instrument of assault, location of injuries and impairment period resulting from lesions in Domestic Violence Assaults versus non-Domestic Violence Assaults.\n\nData was analyzed according to age, gender, nature of lesions, the instrument of assault, location of injuries, and period to cure suffered lesions. Levene’s test for variance and Welch's t-test were utilized to compare both groups.\n\nDuring the previously mentioned period a total of 3844 Criminal Law reports were analyzed. 1217 of these corresponded to Domestic Violence Assaults cases, 960 female and 257 male victims, ages varied from 1 to 97, with a mean value of 39 (38.5892 ± 15.02762) years. 942 resulted of blunt trauma. The period to cure suffered lesions had a mean value of 4 (3.7442 ± 3.50393) days, resulting in daily work impairment of a mean value of 3 (2.6927 ± 10.72988) days and in usual labor impairment of a mean value of 2 (1.7472 ± 6.76170) days.\n\n2627 of these corresponded to non-Domestic Violence Assault cases, 1035 female and 1565 male victims, ages varied from 1 to 91, with a mean value of 39 (38.5454 ± 17.07986) years. 1983 cases resulted of blunt trauma. The period to cure suffered lesions had a mean value of 5 (4.2667 ± 12.07120) days, resulting in daily work impairment of a mean value of 6 (5.7118 ± 29.47528) days and in usual labor impairment of a mean value of 5 (4.3037 ± 24.69471) days. The authors also characterized the instrument of assault and location of injuries in both groups.\n\nMost of the cases comprehend a female victims suffering blunt trauma. Comparing both groups, the authors conclude that the age in both populations is fairly the same and that domestic violence assault normally results in lesions that are faster to cure, originating fewer impairment days for general work and for usual labor, than non-domestic violence assault. The authors consider that domestic violence assaults’ physical component is only the tip of the iceberg of a continuous and complex form of violence.\n\nPP-044\n\nPostural Dyslexia: a medico-legal evaluation\n\nDaniel André Martins Henriques , António Mestre, Graça Costa, Francisco Corte Real\n\nCentre Branch of the Portuguese National Legal Medicine Institute\n\nAccording to Da Cunha (1979), Postural Deficiency Syndrome is a disorder in the central nervous system functioning, characterized by impairment in transmission and integration of information necessary for postural balance. Various symptoms can appear within the same subject, such as, musculoskeletal complaints, as well as perceptual and cognitive deficit symptoms. This Syndrome can occur at any time of life. In children, after the acquisition of upright posture and bipedal walking, impairment of spatial reference, for instance the decrease of referential vision will hinder the balanced development of the body’s posture. It is usually during school years that disorders such as dyslexia, hyperactivity, loss of interest, attention deficit disorder will appear. Later in adolescence these symptoms will manifest themselves through musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nThe authors were requested by Coimbra’s Court related to Family Law matters, to infer if an adolescent was bearer of Postural Deficiency Syndrome, in a child custody dispute. Clinical signs and symptoms of this syndrome were taken in consideration to evaluate if the patient suffered from the disorder in appraisal. Ophthalmologic, psychological and neurologic evaluations of the patient were undertook in idoneous institutions to ensure the validity of results.\n\nThe patient presented himself to the Ophthalmologic evaluation wearing prismatic lenses, having a visual acuity of 8/10 bilaterally, in monocular and binocular conditions, he didn’t present any facial asymmetry, anomalous posture or gait abnormalities. A new correction was proposed, having a visual acuity of 10/10 in monocular conditions and "
