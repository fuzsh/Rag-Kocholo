    "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the judge at The Hague read out a verdict confirming Slobodan Praljak’s 20-year prison term for war crimes, the white-bearded former Bosnian Croat general rose to his feet.\n\n“Slobodan Praljak is not a war criminal. I am rejecting your verdict with contempt,” Praljak shouted defiantly.\n\nHe then tilted his head back and drank from a small vial. As the judge appealed for him to sit down, Praljak declared: “I have taken poison.”\n\nThe judge, looking disconcerted, suspended proceedings. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia confirmed later Wednesday that Praljak had been given immediate medical help in the courtroom before being taken to the hospital, where he died.\n\nEmergency services personnel head toward the tribunal building in The Hague on Wednesday.

The ICTY said only that he had drunk “a liquid” and quickly fallen ill.\n\nCroatian lawyer Goran Mikuličić told CNN’s local affiliate N1 that “anyone could have brought him a bottle of poison easily.” He said family, friends, journalists and lawyers were allowed to visit Praljak but that only lawyers were allowed to take bags into the detention facility.\n\nPraljak isn’t the first war criminal or suspect to kill himself while being held in the ICTY detention units.\n\nFormer Croatian Serb leader makes his initial apparance at the Hague tribunal in November 2003.

So this aligns with his profession, he wants to be remembered by it,” he said.\n\nPraljak, who was detained in 2004, had already served two-thirds of his 20-year sentence, for offenses committed between 1992 and 1994, and would have been eligible for release in the coming months.\n\nWhat’s the response in Croatia and Bosnia?\n\nDespite being a convicted war criminal, Praljak still commands significant support in Croatia, in an indication of how the scars of the 1990s conflicts are yet to heal fully.\n\nThe Parliament of Croatia, or Sabor, began Thursday’s session with a moment of silence to honor Praljak and all war victims.\n\nThe Parliament’s President, Goran Jandroković, read a statement in which he said all parties represented in the chamber agreed that the verdict “does not honor historical truth, facts and proof” and as such was “unjust and unacceptable.”\n\nCroatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic gives a press conference following Praljak's death.

Croatia was not the aggressor, but, along with the United States, did most for the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia and Bosnia were attacked by Milošević’s Serbia and the Yugoslav National Army and those are facts. Croatia didn’t attack anyone.”\n\nDragan Čović, a Croat member of the Presidency of Bosnia, said: “We consider this (the verdict) primarily a crime against all honorable representatives of the Croat military forces and the Croat nation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.”\n\nAbout 1,000 Bosnian Croats gathered in a square in the southern Bosnian town of Mostar – where some of the fiercest fighting occurred in the 1990s – late on Wednesday to light candles in support of Praljak, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nBosnian Croats and residents of Mostar light candles in tribute to Slobodan Praljak in Mostar on Wednesday.

Prlić led Croat separatists within Bosnia who wanted a part of Bosnia to be annexed to Croatia in collusion with Tudjman.\n\nHis niece, Lana Prlić, who is vice president of the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia, notably spoke out in support of the Hague tribunal in a statement on Facebook Wednesday morning.\n\n“I respect and accept the verdict of the Court in the Hague,” she wrote. “In our life, we have several families – the one we choose and the one we are born into. The Social Democratic Party of Bosnia is my family that I chose as an activist in 2010. At the same time, I can’t and don’t want to escape the family whose surname I’ve carried since my birth in 1993. Everyone has to take responsibility for their crimes.”\n\nShe called on politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia to respect the court and also the victims of war crimes and their families, who had suffered for years.\n\nCroat politician Goran Beus Richembergh, of GLAS, wrote on Facebook that he had received a number of death threats, including threats to kill his wife, after an earlier post in which he welcomed the verdict and called Praljak a lawfully convicted war criminal. Beus Richembergh said he had alerted the police.\n\nHe told Croatian TV channel Nova TV: “In the mass of insults I get every day for publicly taking a stand, I got threats that can be considered serious. Now the police have to solve it.”\n\nCNN has sought comment from the police in Zagreb.\n\nAccording to the GLAS Facebook page, fellow party member Vesna Pusić, a former foreign minister of Croatia who also welcomed the verdict, has also received a death threat."
