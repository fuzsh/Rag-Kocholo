    "text": "In a statement at an EU foreign ministers' meeting in Austria just after news of Milosevic's death was confirmed, he said: \"With the death of Milosevic, one of the main actors if not the the main actor in the Balkan wars of the late 20th century. \"I would like to spare a thought for all those who suffered so much from ethnic cleansing, tens of thousands of men, women and children, which Milosevic conceived and planned.\" The former president faced more than 60 counts including genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the Balkan wars, including the 1995 massacre of 8000 Muslims at Srebrenica.\n\nTwo cardiologists treating Milosevic in The Hague had warned he was at risk of a potentially life threatening condition known as a hypertensive emergency, when surges in blood pressure can damage the heart, kidneys and central nervous system. Last month, the tribunal rejected a request by Milosevic to travel to Russia for specialist medical treatment, noting that his trial - that has already lasted four years - was in the final stages and he might not return to complete it.\n\nThe court said Milosevic's lawyers had not shown that his medical needs could not be met in the Netherlands and said experts from abroad could come to The Hague to treat him. Milosevic, who was overthrown in 2000 and sent to The Hague in June 2001, said last month his health was worsening. Milosevic's brother lives in Russia and prosecutors suspect his wife and son do too. The prosecution had opposed his release despite a promise by Russia to return him, fearing he could say his health stopped him from travelling back to The Hague.\n\nThe former Serb strongman was defending himself and had refused to cooperate with court-appointed lawyers who are on standby to fill in for him when he is ill. He had used up more than four-fifths of the 150 days allotted for his defence, suggesting the case could be wrapped up in the next few months barring any new delays. Judges would then need several months to deliberate before a verdict.\n\nMilosevic is charged with 66 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in complex indictments covering conflicts in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo in the 1990s. He declined to enter a plea. Last week, the former rebel Croatian Serb leader Milan Babic committed suicide at the tribunal's detention centre. Babic had testified against Milosevic and was in The Hague to appear in the trial of another top Croatian Serb. Serbia-Montenegro's Foreign Minister, Vuk Draskovic, said it was a pity Milosevic had not been tried in his own country.\n\n\"Milosevic organised many many assassinations of people of my party, of people of my family... He ordered a few times assasination attempts against my life,\" Draskovic told reporters at the foreign ministers' meeting in Austria. \"What can I say? I can say it's a pity he didn't face justice in Belgrade,\" he said."
