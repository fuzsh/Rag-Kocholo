Photo: Instagram/Vojislav Seselj.\n\nAround 200 people gathered in Milosevic’s hometown of Pozarevac on Friday to lay flowers and wreaths on his grave in the garden of his family home, according to media reports.\n\nSome of Milosevic’s former allies from his Socialist Party came to pay their respects, including former minister Milutin Mrkonjic and Nikola Sainovic, the former Yugoslav deputy prime minister who recently returned from The Hague after his prison sentence for the war crimes in Kosovo ended.\n\nSerbia’s current labour minister Aleksandar Vulin, a member of the Socialist Movement, also attended the event and said Milosevic had been “cruelly persecuted and cruelly punished”, Tanjug news agency reported.\n\nHague Tribunal defendant Vojislav Seselj, whose verdict for alleged wartime crimes in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia is due on March 31, also came to pay tribute alongside several members of his nationalist Serbian Radical Party.\n\n“He was killed because he was not given proper and timely medical help,” Seselj alleged after he laid flowers.\n\nThere were also representatives of an association called Freedom, founded by Milosevic himself, which organises an annual commemorative trip to Pozarevac.\n\nBorn and raised in Pozarevac in 1951, Milosevic rose to prominence in 1987, when he became recognised as a spokesperson for Serb nationalists in the former Yugoslavia. He finally came to power in 1990 as president of Serbia and in 1997 become the president of Yugoslavia.\n\nHe held the role until October 5, 2000, when he was ousted by the opposition. Less than a year later, he was arrested and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague to stand trial, becoming the first European head of state to be prosecuted for genocide and war crimes.\n\nMilosevic’s widow Mirjana Markovic recently published her life story, Bilo je to ovako (This is How it Was), in what her publishers, Serbia’s Novosti company, said was “a bid to fulfil her late husband Slobodan’s last wish”.\n\nMarkovic and her son Marko Milosevic live in Moscow, while her daughter Marija is settled in Montenegro.\n\nThey are all wanted in Serbia for crimes ranging from corruption, abuse of office to the illegal possession of weapons. They are alleged to have stashed tens of millions of euros in foreign accounts.\n\nCommenting on the fact that they have been out of Serbia for some time, Vulin said they should return to the country.\n\n“I think the family of Slobodan Milosevic should be given at least the elementary presumption of innocence,” said Vulin, who was also one of the founders of Markovic’s party Yugoslav Left.\n\nInterpol issued a red notice after the Serbian authorities charged Markovic with abuse of office by incitement and with unlawful interference.\n\nHowever, Russia has refused to extradite her to Serbia."
