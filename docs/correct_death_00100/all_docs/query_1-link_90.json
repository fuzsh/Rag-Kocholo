Yugoslavia: Death of A Nation -- Part V: A Safe Area\n\nDescription\n\nThe Death of Yugoslavia (Serbian, Montenegrin, Bosnian, Croatian and Slovenian: Smrt Jugoslavije, Macedonian: Смртта на Југославија, Smrtta na Jugoslavija), later retitled into Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation in an updated and revised edition, is a six part BBC documentary series first broadcast in 1995, and also the name of a book written by Allan Little and Laura Silber that accompanies the series. The book and film cover the collapse of the former Yugoslavia from three decades ago. Notable in its combination of never-before-seen archive footage interspersed with interviews of most of the main players in the conflict, including Slobodan Milošević, the leader of Serb nationalism, then President of Serbia, through the secession of Slovenia and Croatia, to the war in Bosnia. Film footage does not extend as far as the Kosovo crisis or the secession of Montenegro. (abstract from Simon Gros's Vimeo page) —————— Part 5: A Safe Area As the situation in Bosnia worsens, there is further conflict between the Serb and Bosnian forces. There is increasing UN involvement and NATO begin to step in. The Bosnians and Croats reach an agreement mediated by the UN whilst another UN agreement falls through, despite being signed by all parties. The suffering and persecution of Bosnian Muslims by Serb forces is featured."
