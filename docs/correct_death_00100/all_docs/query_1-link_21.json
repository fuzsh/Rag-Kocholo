While other communist governments crumbled in the late 1980s, former communist bureaucrat Slobodan Milošević rose to become the head of state of Serbia (1989–97) and then Yugoslavia (1997–2000). He used his control of the media, government appointments, police, and the military to rouse ethnic hatred and to build a Serbian nationalist mass movement. His efforts to establish a Greater Serbia contributed to the breakup of the Socialist Yugoslav federation in 1991–92 and led to armed conflicts with some of the republics that seceded. In 1999 Serbia launched a major offensive against an ethnic Albanian liberation group in the Serbian province of Kosovo. Milošević was later indicted for war crimes and tried by the International Court of Justice.\n\nMilošević was born on August 29, 1941, in Požarevac, Serbia, Yugoslavia. His parents were schoolteachers of Montenegrin descent. Milošević was a serious, reliable student who wrote for the school newspaper and took part in political activities. In high school he met Mirjana Marković, the daughter of a leading Serbian communist family. They later married, and she became his political adviser.\n\nMilošević completed his law degree at the University of Belgrade in 1964. An older law student, Ivan Stambolić, became his friend and mentor. As a loyal communist, Milošević benefited from Marshal Tito’s ouster of reformers from government-controlled positions in the 1970s. He was appointed manager of an energy plant and then president of a large Belgrade bank. His career continued to prosper after Tito died in 1980.\n\nIn 1984 Stambolić, who recently had been made Serbian communist party leader, appointed Milošević head of the Belgrade party committee. Belgrade was a center for liberal reformers and Serbian nationalists, but Milošević firmly suppressed the dissidents. He censored publications and promoted Marxism in the schools. In January 1986 Stambolić became president of Serbia, and Milošević replaced him as Serbian party chief.\n\nLong-standing tensions in the autonomous province of Kosovo flared between the Serb minority and the ethnic Albanian majority in 1987. In response, Milošević adopted an aggressively pro-Serb stance, which brought him great popularity among the Serbs. He also used the issue to help turn the party against Stambolić. At a nationally televised party meeting in September, leading communists severely criticized Stambolić’s regime for its supposed failure to defend Serbian interests in Kosovo. Two months later Stambolić resigned.\n\nHaving orchestrated his former friend’s downfall, Milošević ran Serbian politics from behind the scenes and built a base of support in the army. One of his first actions was to revoke the autonomous status of the provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. In May 1989 the parliament elected him president of Serbia. In July 1990, seeing communism on the wane, he renamed his party the Socialist Party of Serbia. That December, Serbia held its first contested elections. Favored by the government-controlled media, Milošević won. Demonstrations against him broke out in March 1991.\n\nBy that time other Yugoslav republics were moving toward independence. Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia each declared their independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, as did Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992. Serbia and Montenegro formed a new Yugoslav federation. Many Serbians worried about a backlash against the Serb minorities in Croatia and Bosnia. Milošević encouraged the Yugoslav army to attack Croatia and the Bosnian Serbs to seize land by force. In the civil wars that followed, he armed the Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia and roused ethnic hatred at home. Tens of thousands died in the wars. The Serbian campaign of “ethnic cleansing” sought to expel or eliminate the non-Serb majority in Croatia and Bosnia using mass executions, forced marches, torture, starvation, and systematic rape. In response, the United Nations imposed trade sanctions on Serbia, and the country’s economy suffered. Milošević, however, easily won reelection as Serbian president in December 1992. In order to lift the sanctions, Milošević agreed to a peace settlement in 1995, which ended the war in Bosnia.\n\nThe war, lack of economic reform, and the Milošević family’s accumulation of money and power alienated many of his supporters. After Milošević annulled opposition victories in local elections in November 1996, tens of thousands of protesters marched in the streets of Belgrade daily for months. He eventually recognized the results of the election, but his actions continued to provoke controversy.\n\nConstitutionally unable to serve another term as president of Serbia, Milošević had the parliament name him president of Yugoslavia in July 1997. In 1998, in an attempt to crack down on rebels known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), Milošević began a campaign of terror against the Kosovo Albanians, who accounted for about 90 percent of the province’s population. He ordered a major attack on the province the following year. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began an air bombardment against Yugoslavia in March to try to end the Serb aggression. The bombing galvanized support for Milošević, however, who then began a campaign of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo that drove out hundreds of thousands of Albanians. In May of that year the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal indicted Milošević and several associates on four counts of war crimes allegedly committed in Kosovo. After Yugoslavia had endured 11 weeks of bombing, the Milošević government agreed to terms of a peace settlement with NATO in June 1999.\n\nMilošević stood for reelection in 2000. With the considerable unrest the country had experienced during his regime and the economy still faltering, he lost to the opposition leader. In 2001 the government of Yugoslavia arrested him and turned him over to the International Court of Justice on charges that he committed genocide, crimes against humanity, and other war crimes during the conflicts in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo. His trial began in 2002 in The Hague. Delayed repeatedly by Milošević’s bouts of illness, the trial was still under way when the former Serbian leader was found dead in his detention cell on March 11, 2006."
