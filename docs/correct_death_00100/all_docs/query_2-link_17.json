        "text": "THE HAGUE, March 13 - A top toxicologist in the Netherlands said Monday that he believed that Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugoslav leader, had been manipulating medication to fake a medical condition, a ploy that contributed to his ill heath and may have played a role in the heart attack that caused his death.\n\nThat theory was advanced by Dr. Donald Uges, professor of clinical and forensic toxicology at the University of Groningen, who suggested that Mr. Milosevic had been seeking to demonstrate that Dutch doctors could not cure him and that he should therefore be allowed to seek treatment, and freedom, in Moscow.\n\nHe was imprisoned here on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide during three Balkan wars in the 1990's.\n\nDr. Uges based his theory on his detection in Mr. Milosevic's blood of a drug that had not been prescribed for him and that was not only inappropriate but, under the circumstances, dangerous. Mr. Milosevic, who had complained days before that he was being poisoned, was found dead on his bed in his prison cell on Saturday morning.\n\nThe drug at issue is a powerful antibiotic known as rifampicin, used to treat serious bacterial infections like tuberculosis, leprosy and Legionnaire's disease. Rifampicin, detected in Mr. Milosevic's blood as recently as two weeks ago, is known to interfere with medications he was taking for high blood pressure.\n\nAn international team of doctors, including Dutch, Belgian and Serbian forensic specialists, attended an autopsy on Sunday and said in a preliminary report that Mr. Milosevic had died of a heart attack. Their toxicology tests are due in the next few days.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
