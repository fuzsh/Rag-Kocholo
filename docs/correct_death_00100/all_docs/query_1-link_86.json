    "text": "The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina ended in 1995 with a peace agreement negotiated in Dayton, Ohio. It established two state “entities”: the Serb Republic, which includes Srebrenica, and the Bosnian Federation joined by a weak central government. Refugees were guaranteed the right to return to their homes, but only a fraction of the prewar Bosniak population has gone back to Srebrenica.\n\nFor the survivors in Bosnia, one of the most difficult aspects of the aftermath has been the uncertainty of not knowing what happened to loved ones. This was made even more difficult in Srebrenica, where, after the genocide ended, Bosnian Serb officials dug up the mass graves of their victims and reburied the bodies across a wide swath of territory in an effort to conceal their crimes.\n\nInternational and national authorities have attempted to discover what happened to the more than 20,000 people listed as missing throughout Bosnia. In the decades following the conflict, more than half the bodies have been identified, including several thousand from Srebrenica.\n\nJustice\n\nOn May 25, 1993, while the conflict in Bosnia continued—and a full year before the genocide at Srebrenica—the UN Security Council created the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to prosecute the perpetrators of the atrocities. It was the first such tribunal since Nuremberg and the first mandated to prosecute the crime of genocide, among other offenses.\n\nSituated in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICTY charged 161 people. These include heads of state, army chiefs-of-staff, cabinet ministers, and many other high- and mid-level political, military, and police leaders from various parties to the conflict. Its indictments address crimes committed from 1991 to 2001 against members of various ethnic groups in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. More than 80 people have been convicted, and trials are expected to be completed by the end of 2017.\n\nIn 2001, the ICTY ruled that genocide had occurred in Srebrenica. Judges have also ruled that rape was used by members of the Bosnian Serb armed forces as an instrument of terror and that a “hellish orgy of persecution” occurred in concentration camps of northwestern Bosnia. In 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) determined that Serbia violated the Genocide Convention by not doing enough to prevent genocide in Srebrenica.\n\nThe most high profile prosecutions include:"
