It had started the bombing without any approval from the United Nations Security Council, and instead invoked the claims of universal human rights, saying that these trumped national sovereignty and the existing rules of international law.\n\nThese arguments were but claims for vigilantism on a world scale. The principles of non-interference and legality are at the heart of the international system as expressed in the charter of the United Nations, just as they are backed up by centuries of customary international law. To be sure, this was not the first time international law had been broken, but it was the first time that it had been flouted with such open contempt. World leaders who said that the current arrangements of the international system should not constrain their actions, and that legal formality should not stand in their way, were in fact advocating a lawless world. Even if the moral case for the war had existed, which it did not, there would still have to have been a formal authorisation for the law to be legal. The Kosovo war therefore prepared the ground for the attack on Iraq in 2003, which also occurred with UN Security Council approval but also in the name of spurious justifications in international law (in Iraq's case, the existence of 'weapons of mass destruction').\n\nWestern leaders made their legal and constitutional position very clear. The Czech president, Vaclav Havel, argued that sovereignty should no longer be the basis of the international system. 'This war places human rights above the rights of the state,' he wrote. Havel claimed that the Kosovo war would serve as a precedent for the whole world, and that the old doctrine of non-intervention would disappear down 'the trap door of history'. The British prime minister, Tony Blair, argued in a speech entitled 'The doctrine of the international community' and delivered in Chicago on 22 April 1999 that the Kosovo war and economic globalisation showed that the international system had to change:\n\nWe are all internationalists now, whether we like it or not. We cannot refuse to participate in global markets if we want to prosper. We cannot ignore new political ideas in other countries if we want to innovate. We cannot turn our backs on conflicts and the violation of human rights within other countries if we want still to be secure. On the eve of a new Millennium we are now in a new world. We need new rules for international co-operation and new ways of organising our international institutions.\n\nNATO took a similar view. The organisation was celebrating its fiftieth anniversary, having been in search of a new justification for its existence since the end of the Cold War, and on 24 April 1999, it proclaimed a 'new strategic concept'. Whereas it had been created as a defensive alliance to protect the sovereignty of its member states against a putative Soviet attack, it now adopted a proactive military policy, which meant that it might attack other states if necessary. One possible casus belli was the abuse of human rights in other countries. Other 'threats' to which the alliance might be obligated to respond included 'ethnic and religious rivalries, territorial disputes, inadequate or failed efforts at reform ... the dissolution of states ... acts of terrorism ... the disruption of the flow of vital resources'. The 'war on terror' was not born on 11 September 2001 but well before then.\n\nNATO alleged that Yugoslav forces were making massive attacks against ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo in pursuit of a programme of racial persecution known as 'ethnic cleansing'. This claim lay at the very heart of the NATO case for war and of the indictment of Miloevic and the other Yugoslav leaders. 'It is no exaggeration,' wrote the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, 'to say what is happening in Kosovo is racial genocide. Miloevic is determined to wipe a people from the face of his country.' Blair went into overdrive: 'Children seeing their fathers dragged away to be shot. Thousands executed. Tens of thousands beaten. 100,000 men missing. 1.5 million people driven from their homes.'\n\nThe world's media joined in the frenzy. Lurid atrocity 'reporting' spread like a collective madness. Saturation coverage was provided of weeping Albanian refugees and the wildest stories about mass killings abounded. At one point, for instance, it was claimed that the Serbs, like the Nazis at Auschwitz, were burning the bodies of 1,500 murdered Albanians in the incinerators at the Trepica Mining Complex. Some of those who set themselves up as leading authorities on the Balkans fell for this blatant piece of war propaganda, even though it turned out to be completely false.\n\nThese stories were driven by the war propaganda emanating from the governments of the most powerful Western countries, primarily the United States. The US State Department produced a report in May 1999, during the bombing, entitled 'Erasing History', which alleged that 'The regime of Slobodan Miloevic is conducting a campaign of forced migration on a scale not seen in Europe since the Second World War.' The report contained numerous falsehoods, from the overall allegation of genocide (which was so unsustainable that it was never included in the Kosovo indictment, not even when this was revised in June 2001, two years after the end of hostilities), to specific claims such as one that the Kosovar capital, Pristina, had become 'a ghost town' when in fact, there were still hundreds of thousands of people living there.\n\nLeading statesman fed the media with huge casualty figures, secure in the knowledge that their claims would be reported as fact before anything could be checked. In April, the US Ambassador for War Crimes, David Scheffer, said he thought 100,000 Albanians had been killed, a figure repeated by US Defense Secretary William Cohen the following month. Cohen's claims were widely reported the following day as fact. The British government was a little more circumspect, preferring the figure of '10,000 killed', a figure it initially mooted in June 1999 but which it stuck to until well into the following year.\n\nThese claims of genocide had a general and a particular function. Their general function was to work as war propaganda. Their particular function was a legal one. Genocide is a specific crime in international humanitarian law, coming under 'universal jurisdiction', and the existing treaties on it require all states to prosecute those accused of it. NATO leaders pretended that this meant there exists a right of 'humanitarian intervention' where genocide is occurring, while in fact there does not.\n\nThe centrepiece of NATO's claim in this regard was 'Operation Horseshoe'. This was allegedly a Serbian plan to drive out the Albanian population from Kosovo in order to establish ethnic Serb hegemony in that province. The NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, referred frequently to Operation Horseshoe in his press conferences while the bombing was in progress, and the media reported it as fact. Eventually, it turned out to be an invention of the secret services of Western states. The game was given away when the document allegedly outlining it had 'horseshoe' written in the Croatian not Serbian form of the word (potkova instead of potkovica). Of course there were ugly incidents and war crimes in Kosovo, just as Albanian guerrillas indubitably committed atrocities against Serb civilians and other Albanians. But Operation Horseshoe had as much relationship to reality as did the fictional character, 'Gruban', hero of Miodrag Bulatovic's novel Hero on a Donkey, whose name was included in an indictment issued by the ICTY Prosecutor on 13 February 1995, the result of a practical joke played by a Serbian journalist on an American colleague. Having a drink one night in a bar, the Serb told the American that a brutal guard at the Omarska camp in Bosnia was called 'Gruban', and the journalist, who evidently had a second job as an informer but who did not understand the literary reference, passed the name on to The Hague. The indictment against 'Gruban' and others was eventually withdrawn three years later, on 8 May 1998, presumably when the ICTY Prosecutors realised they did not have much chance of ever seeing him in court.\n\nThe non-existence of Operation Horseshoe did not prevent Louise Arbour, the Chief Prosecutor at the ICTY, from putting the claim of ethnic cleansing at the centre of the Kosovo indictment. In fact, she dropped heavy hints that the indictment would soon be upgraded to include genocide. Speaking on 18 June 1999 (appropriately enough, at NATO headquarters), Arbour said:\n\nWe have never excluded the possibility of framing the charges under the genocide convention ... I don't think it's a secret that what is being uncovered on the ground is of very troubling order of magnitude and we will certainly want to reassess particularly when it comes to homicides, murders. We will examine whether it would be appropriate to ... upgrade some of the existing charges and bring more serious charges against these and other accused.\n\nThese further charges never materialised. Although media reports in the immediate aftermath of the war were full of ghoulish stories about hundreds of 'mass grave' sites all across Kosovo, none were found. Even though the Kosovo indictment was subsequently revised twice, on 29 June 2001 and 29 October 2001, the list of people that the ICTY alleged Yugoslav forces had killed numbered 585. Even this list included the names of known KLA fighters. Of course crimes against humanity are not a matter of statistics alone, but this figure is a tiny fraction of the numbers being bandied about by Western leaders during the bombing.\n\nThe news of the 'disappointing' body count started to emerge in September 1999, when a team of Spanish forensic doctors, who had been told to expect to have to carry out thousands of autopsies, packed their bags and returned home after being given only 187 cadavers to examine. At numerous sites where the US State Department claimed there had been hundreds of killings, the ICTY investigators found no bodies whatsoever. In the places where bodies were discovered, the numbers of bodies exhumed was about one-tenth of those claimed by the US government during the bombing.\n\nArticles appeared on the matter in the autumn of 1999, and by the following year it was widely accepted that NATO had exaggerated the scale of the atrocities, even by media who had reported the original allegations as fact. One of the most poignant examples of the lies told by Albanians and their allies to justify the war were those recounted to Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) correspondent Nancy Durham by Rajmonda Rreci, a Kosovo Albanian girl who told the reporter she had taken up arms to avenge her sister's murder by Serbs. Durham had broadcast emotional reports about Rajmonda in 1998, as the Kosovo conflict was beginning, but when she visited Rajmonda in Kosovo again in September 1999 she found that the girl's sister was alive and well. She had lied. (The fact that the BBC had been able to glorify a girl fighter did not stop it expressing outrage whenever there were reports of Yugoslav forces killing women.) In 2004, moreover, a Pulitzer Prize finalist journalist for USA Today resigned after it was revealed that he had faked proof about a meeting in 1999 at which he claimed he had been shown direct evidence of an order to ethnically cleanse a Kosovo village, about which he had published an article on the front page of his newspaper at the height of the war.\n\nMoreover, NATO had itself committed terrible massacres, such as when it bombed a convoy of 87 Albanians who were returning to their homes near Korisa in May 1999, or when it massacred scores of civilians doing their shopping in the marketplace at Nis. NATO had dropped cluster bombs on Nis, which issue a shower of bomblets and cause maximum damage over a wide area. In Kosovo, NATO used depleted uranium, which continued to cause cancer seven years later. There were dozens of such attacks, and NATO spokesman regularly denied reports of civilian deaths ('collateral damage') before admitting the truth. In the event, NATO killed roughly the same number of civilians as the Yugoslav forces allegedly did, while NATO's murderous allies, the Albanian insurgents, carried out a spree of ethnic cleansing of Serbs, Bosniaks and gypsies, tens of thousands of whom fled north in the days between the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo and the arrival of NATO's. NATO also tried to kill President Miloevic personally in an air strike on his house on 22 April 1999.\n\nAs information began to seep out that the claims about Serb atrocities were exaggerated, Louise Arbour left her job as Chief Prosecutor to join the Supreme Court of Canada on 15 September 1999. Had she started to realise the 'Kosovo genocide' was as non-existent as the weapons of mass destruction were to be in Iraq in 2003? Her successor, Carla del Ponte, reported to the United Nations on 10 November 1999 that a total of 2,108 bodies had been exhumed by forensic specialists, of various nationalities, and who had died from various causes. Given that there had been Serb and Albanian victims in the conflict, and that NATO itself had killed additional hundreds of people, mainly civilians, the humanitarian justification for the war was clearly non-existent. The International Committee for the Red Cross at this stage was listing just over 3,000 people missing, that is, including all nationalities and including both missing and missing presumed dead. There had been huge emigration from Kosovo and Yugoslavia at this time, especially of Albanians, as reports from the refugee camp at Sangatte near Calais attested at the time, and many of the people on the 'missing' list may simply have left to start a new life abroad.\n\nMeanwhile, there was good evidence to say that the mass exodus of Albanians from Kosovo, which had created such a media sensation, was not the result of any ethnic cleansing plan but instead a natural reaction to the NATO bombing and a brilliant propaganda exercise. Following the dramatic success of the mass 'walk-out' of East Germans from East Germany in 1989, and the huge media shock created by the arrival of the first Kosovo Albanian refugees several days after the NATO bombing started, the KLA doubtless realised the crucial importance of maintaining the flow of refugees to bolster Western public support for their cause. Many people in the West, indeed, quickly forgot that there had been no refugees before the bombing had started. The view that the label 'refugees' was a misnomer is bolstered by the fact that the hundreds of thousands of people who made their way to Macedonia and Albania did not have any of the injuries or medical complaints one would expect from people who had fled rampaging genocidal killers.\n\nWorse still than the non-existence of genocide in Kosovo was the fact that the NATO bombing had in fact started for an entirely different reason. The countdown to war began with the events in Racak on 15 January 1999. Kosovo Albanian sources and Western governments alleged that a massacre had occurred in that southern Kosovo village; the Serbs countered that there had been a fire-fight during which KLA terrorists had been killed. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) took an active role in the investigation, with an especially important role being played by the head of its mission in Kosovo, the US ex-ambassador, William Walker.\n\nWalker had been US ambassador to El Salvador at a time when atrocities had been committed by US-backed insurgents there. He had also played a role in the campaign to overthrow General Noriega of Panama in 1988-89. The Kosovo Verification Mission, which he headed, was largely staffed with intelligence officers from Western states, especially Britain and the US, and it pursued a political agenda of making matters in Kosovo worse in order to destabilise Miloevic. As Roland Keith, a former member of the KVM remarked, Walker was essentially working for the US government: 'It appeared to me ... that powers higher than mine had no real interest in rebuilding stability in Kosovo but probably had other political agendas of which this [that is, peace] would not play a role whatsoever.' The extent of cooperation at that stage between the theoretically independent KVM and NATO was underlined when Walker personally called both Richard Holbrooke, the US envoy for the Balkans, and Wesley Clark, the US general who was Supreme Commander of NATO, from Rac?ak on his cell phone, even though he subsequently denied having done this.\n\n(Continues...)Excerpted from Travesty by John Laughland"
