    "text": "Slobodan Milosevic was the leader of Serbia and Yugoslavia (which consisted of Serbia and the now independent country of Montenegro) during the US-led NATO bombing of Serbia from March 1999 to June 1999. During this time, President Milosevic was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for war crimes in Kosovo. The US and NATO claimed that President Milosevic's suppression of a secessionist movement in the Serbian autonomous region of Kosovo amounted to ethnic cleansing and genocide, and that bombing Serbia was necessary to stop President Milosevic from committing these so-called war crimes.\n\n\n\nThis book shows conclusively that these charges were false, and that they were brought against President Milosevic in order to justify American and NATO aggression against Serbia. The Kosovo secessionist movement was led by the terrorist Kosovo Liberation Army, which was guilty of staging an armed uprising against Serbian authorities and of committing terrorist acts against both Serbian civilians and the majority ethnic Albanian civilians of Kosovo. Non-combatants were never targeted by Serbia, and this book provides proof that Serbia committed no ethnic cleansing or genocide in Kosovo.\n\n\n\nThe book's author gives the reader an excellent look at the arrogance, hypocrisy, ignorance, deceitfulness, lawlessness, and anti-Serb bias of NATO, the Clinton administration, and the ICTY. The ICTY itself was set up by the UN Security Council, which had no legal right to do so. Also, the book explains how the Serbian government extradited Milosevic to the ICTY (located in The Hague, Netherlands) in contravention of Serbia's own laws after Milosevic was removed from power in a US- and NATO-backed putsch.\n\n\n\nFrom the time he arrived in The Hague in 2001 until his death in March 2006 (Milosevic's trial - the longest criminal trial in world history - was still ongoing at this time), Milosevic was treated unfairly. The lead judge was scandalously biased towards the prosecution, and often treated Milosevic rudely and with contempt. The examples that the author gives are shocking. The author also gives many examples where Milosevic's right to due process and a fair trial was flagrantly violated.\n\n\n\nThe book contains a superb chapter that demonstrates the many differences between the Nuremberg Tribunal that was set up after World War 2 and the ICTY. The book's author explains how the lofty and noble principles that guided the Nuremberg Tribunal have been corrupted by the ICTY.\n\n\n\nThis book is important and necessary. We learn the truth about what happened in Serbia and Kosovo in 1999. The bombing of Serbia killed many civilians and was undoubtedly a major war crime. The book's author vindicates Slobodan Milosevic, who is one of the most misunderstood and maligned figures of recent history. This book is very informative with regard to the Balkan wars of the 1990s and the trial of Slobodan Milosevic. It is also a very informative book about international law and how it was corrupted by the ICTY. It is a must read for those who want to inform themselves of what happened in Serbia and Kosovo in 1999. This book is very well written, but what it tells us about NATO, the Clinton administration, and the ICTY is disturbing for those who believe in the innate goodness of human nature."
