Photo: Koca Sulejmanovic/EPA.\n\nMirjana Markovic, the widow of the former president of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, died in hospital in Moscow on Sunday, Serbian media reported.\n\nMarkovic is reported to have undergone surgery several times in Russia recently, after which her condition deteriorated. The cause of death was not immediately made public.\n\nShe provided constant political backing for her husband Milosevic as he led the country into disastrous wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, the last of which ended in NATO bombing Yugoslavia and forcing Belgrade to abandon its rule over Kosovo in 1999.\n\nSome saw Markovic as the power behind the throne and as her husband’s main adviser. In 1994, she set up her own party, the Yugoslav United Left, JUL, which governed in coalition with Milosevic’s Socialist Party of Serbia.\n\nThe current leader of the Socialist Party, Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic, expressed condolences about her death.\n\n“We may not have had the same opinions at all times, but I always respected her, as Slobodan Milosevic’s wife,” Dacic told Serbian media.\n\nHowever others recalled her role in supporting her husband’s policies during the Balkan wars.\n\n“She was an integral part of his murderous regime, and like so many, she too fled justice, living out her days in exile in Russia,” political scientist Jasmin Mujanovic wrote on Twitter.\n\nMarkovic left Serbia for Russia in 2003 after Milosevic was sent to The Hague to stand trial for wartime crimes, although he died in 2006 before the verdict in his trial. She was given political asylum by Moscow.\n\nShe and her son Marko and daughter Marija were all wanted in Serbia for crimes ranging from corruption, abuse of office to the illegal possession of weapons. They are believed to have stashed tens of millions of euros in foreign accounts.\n\nInterpol issued a ‘red notice’ for her arrest after the Serbian authorities charged her with abuse of office by incitement and with unlawful interference. However, Russia refused to extradite her to Serbia.\n\nThe Belgrade Appeals Court recently overturned a verdict that found Markovic guilty of abuse of office for interfering in the allocation of state-owned apartments, and sent the case for a retrial.\n\nMarkovic has been accused of having been behind the killing of prominent journalist Slavko Curuvija in Belgrade in April 1999 – one of the most notorious Milosevic-era killings. She denied any involvement.\n\nSerbia convicted four former Serbian state security officers for the murder of Curuvija on April 5, but the person or persons who gave the order to kill the journalist remain unprosecuted."
