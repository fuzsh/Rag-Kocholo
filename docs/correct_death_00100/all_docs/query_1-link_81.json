    "text": "Slobodan Milosevic, President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY);\n\nMilan Milutinovic, President of Serbia;\n\nNikola Sainovic, Deputy Prime Minister of the FRY;\n\nDragoljub Ojdanic, Chief of the Armed Forces of the FRY; and\n\nVlajko Stojiljkovic, Minister of Internal Affairs of Serbia.\n\nAll are indicted for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war. All are indicted for directly ordering the persecution, deportation and murder of Kosovar Albanians between January 1 and late April 1999. All except Sainovic are also indicted for failing to prevent or punish forces under their command from committing these crimes. Arrest warrants are being issued to the FRY, to all member states of the United Nations, and to Switzerland. The warrants are being transmitted through the United Nations in New York. The Tribunal also asked United Nations member states to make inquiries to discover whether any of the accused had assets located in their territory, and if so, to freeze such assets until the accused are taken into custody. The United States did so on May 28 and calls on other governments to do the same.\n\nHow does Milosevic's indictment impact our objectives and diplomacy?\n\nWe strongly support the work of the international criminal tribunal and continue to cooperate with its investigations. We have long urged the Tribunal to follow the evidence wherever it goes. We want to see justice follow its course and believe that President Milosevic should appear before the Tribunal for trial.\n\nWe have long said that Milosevic is personally and politically responsible for the conflict in Kosovo. The Tribunal's prosecutor has now said she believes that he is criminally responsible as well.\n\nWe will continue to support the Tribunal as it works to gather additional information and prepare further indictments related to conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nThe indictment of Milosevic does not change our objective in Kosovo, which is to create conditions where the refugees can return with security and self-government.\n\nWe will continue to press the authorities in Belgrade to take those steps necessary to achieve this objective; i.e., withdraw all forces from Kosovo, accept an international security force with NATO at core, and allow unconditional refugee return.\n\nWe will also continue our efforts to promote democracy in Serbia, through and, if necessary, beyond the current conflict.\n\nWe have said all along that Serbia will not be able to join the European mainstream without democratic reform and a change in leadership, which is only made more clear by the indictments that have come down.\n\nDoes this mean no further contact or negotiations with Milosevic?\n\nWe do not intend to negotiate NATO's conditions. He and those around him know what needs to be done to meet NATO's conditions. We do not rule out future contacts if they are necessary to achieve our objectives and ensure that NATO's conditions are implemented.\n\nWould you promise Milosevic to protect him from the ICTY if he agrees to your conditions?\n\nNo. He must deal with the Tribunal judges and prosecutor. We do not have the authority to negotiate an immunity deal on behalf of the tribunal and would not support efforts by anyone else to do so. We have made clear that we would not go for any kind of immunity. We believe that the War Crimes Tribunal is an integral part of the international system and the United Nations system, and it was put into place by a Security Council resolution. The indictment has taken place, and now the rest of the judicial process has to follow through.\n\nDo we demand his removal from office as a condition for suspension of airstrikes?\n\nNo. NATO's conditions remain the same.\n\nIs diplomacy dead?\n\nWe are prepared to support international diplomacy consistent with our conditions."
