    "text": "JONATHAN MILLER:\n\nThis is the day in April 1987 that the Belgrade Communist Party chief burst onto the scene. \"No one has the right to beat you,\" he told Serb villagers in a largely Albanian part of Kosovo. The village name: The Field of Blackbirds, a former battlefield and hearthstone of greater Serbia's imagined former glories.\n\n\"Six centuries on we are again engaged in battle,\" Milosevic told a million awestruck Serbs, \"although they're not armed battlesâ€¦yet,\" he said. Naked nationalism from the Balkans' leading Stalinist, a message heard and understood by Albanians, Croats Muslims; the Serb battle cry was sounded. It lit a fire in Serb hearts right across Yugoslavia and propelled Slobodan Milosevic's inexorable rise; to president, dictator; to the defiant defendant in the dock charged with genocide and crimes against humanity, to which he'd plead not guilty.\n\nNationalist fervor spread through the former Yugoslavia, old rivalries revived, but throughout the brutal conflicts first in Croatia, then in Bosnia, Milosevic was careful to keep his own hands clean, his dirty work delegated to those like Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his commander, Ratko Mladic, who remain on the run to this day. The Dayton Peace Accord in 1995 did finally stop the Bosnian war. Milosevic reveling in the moment, a man reviled as a monster still posing as peacemaker and statesman.\n\nThen, in 1999, Serb forces once again unleashing terror on Kosovan Albanian civilians, Milosevic insisting he was just defending Serbs. Ignoring NATO's ultimatum to withdraw, Milosevic opted for all-out confrontation. For three months, air strikes brought fear and suffering to Serbia. Now vanquished, Milosevic had finally overreached himself, losing an election, then facing mass revolt. Six months later he'd be in The Hague."
