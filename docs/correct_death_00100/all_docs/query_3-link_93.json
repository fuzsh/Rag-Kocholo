        "text": "JONATHAN MILLER:\n\nThis is the day in April 1987 that the Belgrade Communist Party chief burst onto the scene. \"No one has the right to beat you,\" he told Serb villagers in a largely Albanian part of Kosovo. The village name: The Field of Blackbirds, a former battlefield and hearthstone of greater Serbia's imagined former glories.\n\n\"Six centuries on we are again engaged in battle,\" Milosevic told a million awestruck Serbs, \"although they're not armed battles…yet,\" he said. Naked nationalism from the Balkans' leading Stalinist, a message heard and understood by Albanians, Croats Muslims; the Serb battle cry was sounded. It lit a fire in Serb hearts right across Yugoslavia and propelled Slobodan Milosevic's inexorable rise; to president, dictator; to the defiant defendant in the dock charged with genocide and crimes against humanity, to which he'd plead not guilty.\n\nNationalist fervor spread through the former Yugoslavia, old rivalries revived, but throughout the brutal conflicts first in Croatia, then in Bosnia, Milosevic was careful to keep his own hands clean, his dirty work delegated to those like Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his commander, Ratko Mladic, who remain on the run to this day. The Dayton Peace Accord in 1995 did finally stop the Bosnian war. Milosevic reveling in the moment, a man reviled as a monster still posing as peacemaker and statesman.\n\nThen, in 1999, Serb forces once again unleashing terror on Kosovan Albanian civilians, Milosevic insisting he was just defending Serbs. Ignoring NATO's ultimatum to withdraw, Milosevic opted for all-out confrontation. For three months, air strikes brought fear and suffering to Serbia. Now vanquished, Milosevic had finally overreached himself, losing an election, then facing mass revolt. Six months later he'd be in The Hague.\n\nWESLEY CLARK:\n\nIt was the first meeting we had with him, really.\n\nAnd I had never met him. And he suggested to Richard Holbrooke — I was sitting next to — to Ambassador Holbrooke, and he suggested to Ambassador Holbrooke — he said, \"Let's just have an election on your peace proposal.\" And we said, \"An election?\"\n\nAnd he said, \"You call a referendum and\" — or something like this.\n\nAnd, so, they began to talk about it. And we said, but we don't understand why we would have an election in your country. You say your country is different than Bosnia. So, why would people voting in your country then lead to the Bosnian Serbs adopting this peace plan?\n\nHe said, they will not disobey the will of Serb people. Well, so, they took a break. Ambassador Holbrooke got up to make a phone call. And Joe Kruzel and I went up to Milosevic.\n\nAnd we said to him — I said to him: \"Mr. President, you — you — you said that these Bosnian Serbs won't defy the will of the Serb people. And, yet, why would you allow Milosevic to — Mladic to slaughter all these people at Srebrenica?\"\n\nHe looked at me and he said, \"Well, General Clark, you must understand, I told Mladic not to do this, but he didn't listen to me.\"\n\nWell, at that point, I — then, he basically told me he had foreknowledge of the event. And whether he told him not to do it or not was irrelevant.\n\nWESLEY CLARK:\n\nWell, he was negotiating grudgingly. But it was, for him, the least cost way out of a difficult situation.\n\nThe Croatian military had gotten a lot stronger. And the United States was asserting itself. And, so, as a tactical move, to preserve the gains he had, he wanted to — to have this agreement. He didn't intend to go beyond the letter of the agreement, in fact, to do as little as possible to implement the agreement. But it — it — it codified a Republika Srpska. It carved out a Serb portion of Bosnia, which had declared itself an independent country. So, he won in that respect.\n\nWESLEY CLARK:\n\nThe NATO team.\n\nAnd I went back in. And I had the authority from the White House. And I just looked at him, and I said, \"Mr. President, if you don't pull your forces back, NATO, they're going to tell me to bomb you.\"\n\nAnd I looked him right in the eye. He said, \"Well, General Clark, NATO must do what it must be.\" I said, \"No, Mr. President, you do not want to be bombed by NATO.\" He said: \"No, you're right. We will see.\"\n\nAnd, so, he basically conceded some elements of what he wanted to do. We bought a window for diplomacy. The diplomacy didn't pay off. He talked to the Russians. He made up his mind he could withstand NATO airstrikes. And he gave the go-ahead to start the ethnic cleansing."
