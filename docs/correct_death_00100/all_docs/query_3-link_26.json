Both of them, like almost everyone on the bus, are wearing a badge with the former president’s photograph.\n\nThe annual pilgrimage to Pozarevac is organised by an association called Freedom, which was founded by Milosevic himself. This year, it took a busload of his mostly elderly, elegantly-dressed admirers from Belgrade to the place where he was buried in the garden of his family home.\n\nBorn and raised in Pozarevac in 1951, Milosevic rose to prominence in 1987, when he became recognised as a spokesperson for Serb nationalists in the former Yugoslavia. He finally came to power in 1990 as president of Serbia and in 1997 become the president of Yugoslavia.\n\nHe held the role until October 5, 2000, when he was ousted by the opposition. Less than a year later, he was arrested on the orders of the late Serbian premier Zoran Djindjic, and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague to stand trial, becoming the first European head of state to be prosecuted for genocide and war crimes.\n\nFor his supporters however, Milosevic was never the ‘Butcher of the Balkans’, as some have labelled him.\n\n“He loved his country and his people and he wouldn’t let anyone interfere in our business,” says Slavica, one of the women on the bus to Pozarevac. “There has been nothing after him, nothing,” she says.\n\nSlavica shows her loyalty to the late president by going almost every year to his grave to light a candle and lay flowers.\n\nOn the late president’s street in Pozarevac, several dozen more of his supporters have gathered – again mostly elderly. They are carrying Milosevic’s picture, flowers and candles. Some of the women are in tears.\n\nThey wait in front of the big gate of his house, preparing to pay their respects. Close to the gate there is a small stand where Milosevic’s books can be bought. Next to it there is a place to light candles.\n\nA woman that came with her son and asked to remain anonymous says this is the first time she has visited Milosevic’s grave. She is not a member of the Socialist Party, but claims she has always remained loyal to its ideology.\n\n“This is a very sad day,” she says with a trembling voice.\n\n“When I remember that [Ante] Gotovina and [Mladen] Markac [Croatian generals acquitted of war crimes] are free…” she says, on the verge of crying.\n\nNationalist politician Seselj joins the commemoration.\n\nThen the long column of people walk slowly towards the gravestone in silence, lay flowers, light candles and take photos of the improvised cemetery in the yard of the huge modern house.\n\nAfter that, members of the Serbian Radical Party come down the street, clearing the way for their president, Vojislav Seselj, who is also a war crimes defendant, and goes straight to the grave, not paying attention to the onlookers staring at him.\n\nAs Seselj disappears the sight, a pensioner, Radica Mitic, says she is angry about the disrespectful way that the state treated the late president.\n\n“Slobodan Milosevic is a great man and he didn’t deserve to be buried in his garden but in the Alley of the Great in Belgrade,” she says, firmly.\n\nFading memories\n\nIn the town centre not far from the late president’s grave and its floral tributes, things look quite different. It is just another regular Wednesday afternoon, with children going to school and people on the streets talking about everyday matters – politics, money and sports.\n\nA middle-aged cab driver at a town-centre taxi rank, Marko Petrovic says that he forgot that it was the anniversary of Milosevic’s death today. But he argues that the overall situation in the town is worse than under the Milosevic’s reign.\n\n“Pozarevac is destroyed, nothing works here. We used to have a developed industry here, the city was famous. Now we have nothing,” he says as he lights a cigar.\n\nI ask him what the anniversary means for the ordinary people of Milosevic’s hometown.\n\nMilosevic’s admirers walk towards his grave.\n\n“Nothing, absolutely nothing,” he notes slowly. “People here live their own lives just like before. They fight to survive and feed their families.”\n\nIn the nearby park, Jovan, a pensioner also admits that he forgot the anniversary, but he has good memories of Milosevic.\n\n“I think people here know him as a good man. And we had the Bambi [amusement park] at that time, Marko [Milosevic’s son] was among those who ran it. And now there is nothing,” he says. Both Milosevic’s wife and son are now in exile in Russia because they are wanted in their home country.\n\nAs I walk towards the main square, some people seem reluctant to talk about Milosevic, but I manage to find a woman who says she’s a journalist too, although she does not want to tell me her name.\n\n“Honestly, people here do not remember him anymore. I suppose they have forgotten the anniversary as well,” she says.\n\n“Everyone minds their own business,” she adds, and then walks away in a hurry.\n\nThe packed cafes in the main pedestrian zone and the people walking with their children on a sunny day suggest life has moved on for ordinary people of this small town in central Serbia.\n\nWhether they have forgotten the town’s most famous citizen or simple moved on, trying to make ends meet, they pay no attention to what is happening at the big white house with its neat garden where the alleged war criminal was buried nine years ago."
