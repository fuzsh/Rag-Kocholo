        "text": "Former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, known also as the ‘the Butcher of the Balkans’ was extradited at The Hague on this day in 2001 after being indicted in 1999 for war crimes committed in Kosovo.\n\nLater on, other counts of war crimes were added to his indictment for offenses that took place in Croatia and genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nHe was extradited following an order from the Serbian government. Milosevic was arrested in Belgrade on 1 April 2001 as the person responsible for ordering the deaths of tens of thousands of people.\n\nHis trial began on 12 February 2002 with testimonies taking the stand until 25 February 2004. His defense counsel started presenting their arguments in August.\n\nHis trial has been suspended dozens of times due to Milosevic complaining of cardiovascular problems.\n\nOn February 22, Milosevic declared that he was unable to continue hearing out witness testimonies, while two days after his request to be admitted to a hospital in Russia got turned down.\n\nOn 11 March at 9:30 AM, he was found dead in his cell.\n\nPreliminary autopsy results ruled out foul play and determined that Milosevic had died of a heart attack.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE"
