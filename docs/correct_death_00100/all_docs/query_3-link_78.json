        "text": "BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro | The stock of Slobodan Milosevic already had been rising among Serbs who watched his feisty performances at his war crimes trial at The Hague.\n\nHis death makes him a martyr to his supporters and brings into serious question Belgrade’s future cooperation with the U.N. tribunal -- just weeks before a European Union deadline for Belgrade to hand over fugitive Bosnian Serb wartime commander Gen. Ratko Mladic.\n\n“Milosevic’s death will tear to shreds the tribunal’s credibility which has seriously been tarnished already,\" Toma Fila, Milosevic’s family lawyer said, pointing to the deaths of other suspects in custody at the detention center near The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nConvicted former Croatian Serb leader Milan Babic, a star witness in the Milosevic trial, killed himself in prison last week, the second time a detainee committed suicide. The first was Slavko Dokmanovic, another Croatian Serb leader, in 1998.\n\nThe deaths have created the impression for many in Serbia of The Hague as a gallows for Serb nationalists -- a place where the West lets them rot away and was likely to increase pressure on the government from hard-liners not to extradite other suspects.\n\n“How are they now going to explain to the Serbian public that Milosevic was not severely ill, as he had claimed, and that the Hague jail is safe for the Serbs?\" asked political analyst Brace Grubacic.\n\nMilosevic, who suffered from heart problems and high blood pressure, had recently demanded to be temporarily released to go to Moscow for treatment.\n\nBut presiding judge Patrick Robinson refused, ruling that even with Russian guarantees to send him back the court was “not satisfied ... that the accused, if released, would return for the continuation of his trial.\"\n\nMilosevic, 64, was found in his bed Saturday at the detention center and apparently died of natural causes, the tribunal said. He had been examined by doctors following frequent complaints of fatigue or ill health that delayed his trial, but the tribunal could not immediately say when he last had a medical checkup.\n\nIvica Dacic, the caretaker president of Milosevic’s Socialist Party, echoed the views of many here Saturday when he said: “Milosevic did not die in The Hague, he was killed in The Hague.\"\n\nFormer Czech foreign minister Jiri Dienstbier, who served as U.N. special envoy for human rights in Yugoslavia from 1998-2001, cautioned his death could be used by extremists who will proclaim him a national hero.\n\nThose fears took little time to materialize. The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, staunch allies of Milosevic during the war, said in a statement that: “after Milosevic’s death, nothing will be the same in Serbia.\"\n\n“The Radical party promises to the citizens of Serbia that it will no longer tolerate the harassment of the Serbian patriots and their families,\" citing alleged “harassment\" by Serbia’s pro-Western President Boris Tadic and Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic.\n\nMilosevic was branded by the West as “the butcher of the Balkans\" but hailed as a hero by many fellow Serbs, complicating the government’s efforts to capture other war crimes suspects still at large as it faced increasing international pressure.\n\nEU foreign ministers threatened last month to freeze talks with Serbia, the dominant republic in the loose federation that is the successor state to Yugoslavia -- on its EU membership bid, setting a March deadline for Belgrade to hand over Mladic.\n\nMladic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic were indicted in 1995 on charges of orchestrating the massacre of some 8,000 Muslims in the U.N. enclave of Srebrenica -- Europe’s worst carnage since World War II.\n\nMladic is believed to be hiding in Serbia under protection of the hard-liners in the Serb military and police -- Milosevic loyalists. Karadzic reportedly has been hiding and moving between Bosnia, Serbia and his native Montenegro.\n\nMany observers both in Serbia and the West called into question the validity of the Hague war crimes tribunal for other reasons -- suggesting the chance for a historical reckoning had been lost because the trial was allowed to drag on for years.\n\nFormer Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who served as the U.N. special envoy to the Balkans between 1999-2001, called Milosevic’ death “seriously damaging to The Hague tribunal.\"\n\nIn a written statement to Swedish news agency TT, Bildt said that “despite years of trials we will never have a verdict, and thereby a conclusion regarding important questions of guilt.\"\n\nNatasa Kandic, a leading human rights activist in Serbia who has provided evidence to the U.N. war crimes prosecutors, said Milosevic’s death before the end of the trial has caused “historic damage.\""
