THE son of legendary singer Otis Redding has died at 59 after a battle with cancer.

Otis Redding III, who followed his dad into music, died in a hospital in Macon, Georgia at 59.

On Wednesday, his sister Karla Redding-Andrews posted on Facebook: “It is with heavy hearts that the family of Otis Redding III confirms that he lost his battle with cancer last evening.”

Redding was just three years old when his dad was killed in a plane crash in Wisconsin in December 1967.

He and his sibling Dexter formed the band The Reddings, which produced six No. 1 albums in the 1980s.

The band recorded its final album in 1988, but Redding's career in music continued.

The renowned R&B and soul singer Eddie Floyd hired Redding as a guitarist when he was on a European tour.

In a 2018 interview with Maine-based NBC affiliate WCSH, Redding recalled the moment when Floyd told him they would perform his father's 1967 iconic track (Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay.

Redding also performed gigs and tribute concerts that honored his dad.

He told WCSH: "No matter how hard I try to do my own thing, you know it's like 'sing one of your daddy's songs.'"

Redding's death comes just years after he had surgery for prostate cancer in 2018.

He told local ABC affiliate WSB that year: "Any time you hear the word you have a life-threatening disease like cancer, it gets to you mentally."

Redding's father Otis Redding was nicknamed the "King of Soul" and is a soul music and R&B legend.

He won two Grammy Awards for (Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay in 1969 - two years after his death.
