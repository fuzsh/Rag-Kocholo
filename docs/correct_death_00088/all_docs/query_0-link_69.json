        "text": "Dec 10, 1967 - Madison, WI\n\nSeven musicians and a pilot were in Redding's twin-engine Beechcraft, which he'd recently purchased from singer James Brown. Redding was 26, Married with 3 children.\n\nThe only survivor was trumpet player Ben Cauley, who was 20 at the time. Cauley was jolted awake as the plane crashed into Lake Monona about a half mile out from the 4600 block of Tonyawatha Trail in Monona. Cauley, who couldn-t swim, grabbed a seat cushion and held on tight. The crash could be heard across the lakefront. The pilot had given no indication of trouble when he was cleared for landing; the cause of the crash was never determined. More...\n\nOtis Redding remembered at Monona Terrace\n\n40 year remembrance ceremony at Monona Terrace\n\nThe Memorial on the Monona Terrace Rooftop\n\nIn 1987 the City of Madison erected the benches and plaque in Law Park. They went into storage while Monona Terrace was built over the park, then placed on the rooftop garden in 1997."
