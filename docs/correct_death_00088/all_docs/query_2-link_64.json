        "text": "S4_Episode 16 Otis Redding\n\nWhen someone excels in their music, they may be given a title of royalty, the queen or king of a genre. Today we are looking at one important voice that left us way too early. Meet you at the table as we discuss the King of Soul, Otis Redding.\n\nI'm Lainie and I'm Laura Beth. And we are Steel Magnolias the strength of steel, With the grace of a magnolia. We're here\n\nto have uplifting conversations about life in the south And we've got plenty of room at our table, So pull up a chair.\n\nWell, here we are sis. Sittin’ at the kitchen table…\n\nYes, we are. We are sitting at the kitchen table. We're not paying any royalties on that five seconds of glory that was attributed to the great Otis Redding. And we are going to spend the whole episode talking about this legend because he deserves his own episode. He was just gone too early. Yeah, I think about that with a lot of these music artists that are gone too early. Yeah. But I don't like to think about that, it’s too depressing. Just I try and just focus on that's amazing that they accomplish that much in so little time. Yeah.\n\nI'll keep singing, I'm thinking about only the good die young. I can’t even sing and I am singing on here, what is wrong with me? Stop giving us a microphone, folks. Well, we wanted to focus on Otis, because he is absolutely southern. He was born in Dawson, Georgia, and his family moved to Macon, Georgia, which is just south of Atlanta. When he was two years old. At a very early age, He began his career as a singer in the Vineville Baptist Church. So many amazing singers started at church.\n\nAbsolutely. It is an integral place of so many performers getting a chance to perform. It's getting a chance to be trained. A lot of these musicians didn't have music lessons, per se. Yeah, but they were a part of a choir or a part of getting at least a little direction. So Otis Redding attended Ballard Hudson High School, and he did participate in his school band. As a teenager, he began to compete in the Douglass theater talent shows, and there was a $5 prize which I'm sure that was big money at that time. After winning 15 times straight Otis was no longer allowed to compete. That’s really funny to think about in a small town you know. Otis, Come on. Let somebody else have a chance you're out.\n\nI really wish actually though, that our entire episode could have Redding’s music as our sound bed, my gosh, because he had so many amazing hits. And but I don't want to infringe upon any music rights. And so look him up if you haven't listened to his catalogue in a long time and be reminded why he is the king of soul. Yes. Let me just list a few hits. Just to remind you if it's been a while, Hard to handle, I can't turn you loose, Sitting on the dock of the bay, Respect. Yes. Aretha Franklin's respect was written by Otis Redding. Mr Pitiful, Old man trouble, Sweet soul music, These arms of mine and on and on. He even covered Try a little tenderness.\n\nyes, that song I love so much. But I have a memory that I always see in my mind when I hear that song. Do you know what it is? Oh, for sure. It's Ducky, right? Yeah. Is it ducky in the record store of 16 candles?\n\nExcuse me, Pretty in Pink. Yes, I always get those two mixed up. So great. Yes, dancing around. So great.\n\nAnd yeah. So if any of those songs are not ringing a bell just right now, go over to your Spotify. Go ahead and queue up some Otis Redding. Because it is exquisite. And you know what I love? He is categorized as the king of soul. And I love a statement that you and I saw recently that described soul music, which was secular music with a substantial gospel influence. Yes. And as I just read his bio, that's what it is. Yeah. He originated his training in church through different gospel music. It has that emotional feel to it, but with secular lyrics. He seems like to me an old soul, one of those people that is so beyond his age. Especially, I mean, okay, spoiler alert, in case you don't know, he's gonna die early. We've already mentioned that. Yeah, but 26 Yeah, so even to think about the way his sound was and he was 20, 22, 24 when he was singing those songs.\n\nI have no idea how somebody that young has that sort of maturity in their songwriting and I would say even his physicality. Like, for some reason, the generation of the 50s and 60s When you see photographs of young people, meaning like people in their teens and 20s they look much older. That's true in the way that they dressed and carried themselves. Let's talk about how they dress too- these singers were dressed when they were on stage, dressed to the nines. Oh, I love that. It would probably look like costumes today, because it would be tuxedos ties, right. A drummer with a tie on, blazers and matching blazers, you know, uniformity across bands.\n\nYou don't see that much now. I mean, you see a few new bands that are choreographed with like a theme. Like they're all in some sort of denim. Right? And it's like frayed on one and it's, you know, like a tie on another. Yeah. Not like this, though.\n\nThere's not sequined backup singers in pumps. And, you know, right. It's yeah, it's a whole different level. And the people coming to see those singers were dressed up too. Well, Otis joined Johnny Jenkins and the Pine toppers in 1958. And I thought this was funny. He's not only joining the band, he was also the driver. Oh, that's right. And so he drove Johnny Jenkins to Memphis, Tennessee for a recording session in August 1962 at Stax Records. Hey, Memphis. So at the end of the session, the Stax co owner Jim Stewart allowed Otis to cut a couple of songs with the remaining studio time. That's crazy. So that resulted in These arms of mine, released in 1962. And I believe also the single, I've been loving you too long. So, these were on vinyl records because they had a bit of extra studio time that's already been booked and paid for. So if anybody wants to grab a mic, right and cut a record, here's your chance, jump on there and do it. Well, after a lot of years of sowing in, and, you know, a lot of hard work, his sacrifices finally started paying off. And he appeared on stages throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and the Caribbean. He was one of the biggest box office smashes of any touring performer during his time. I really feel like he is singled out as a performer or a songwriter that just had a couple of hits, not as a performer.\n\nRight. And think about too just the the times that this was the 60s, you know, racial tensions are high. Yeah, in a lot of places, you know, for the most part, black artists were playing to black audiences. But this started to supersede that, like where he was able to be accepted for singing to both black and white audiences. I mean, I don't even know how you do that crossover, at that time. well, one of the big things that really put him on the map as a performer was the Monterey\n\nPop Festival. Okay, so that's Monterey, California, right? Yes. Three day festival held June 16-18th, 1967.\n\nWow. Before Woodstock, before the “summer of love”.\n\nIn fact, this festival became an inspiration or a template for Woodstock and other festivals. Okay, in two or two. That was two years later. Okay. So crazy. So to think about at that Monterey Pop Festival, not only did you have Otis Redding, you had Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Janis Joplin and both Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin leave us shortly after their that too. So that's kind of weird to think about too.\n\nThe Monterey festival really shifted him from not just a performer for the black audience now he's crossed over. Yes. And also during his time in San Francisco, the San Francisco Bay. Right?\n\nSo he played three shows in 1966. At the Fillmore West auditorium. And Bill Graham, who ran that auditorium, asked him would you like to stay in a hotel? Or would you rather stay at a boathouse near Sausalito? Redding really liked the outdoors, so he chose the boathouse. Well, that's where he was sitting on the dock of the bay and wrote the lyrics of that unbelievable song. And he knew he had he was on to something when he wrote that those lyrics, because apparently, he called Steve Cropper, who was a guitarist at Stax, like in their house band. Yeah, yeah. And he called him and said, I've got a hit. Wow, I couldn't wait to get with him to finish writing it. Wow. And get it going. Yeah, you know, yeah. So Steve Cropper, who was this guitarist co wrote the song with him, okay. And another thing I thought was really sweet was he said when they were when he was co writing the song and singing the song, croppers playing the guitar, and Otis Redding, he said, was really fun and funny. And he kept making these, like, Seagull sounds. No way. Like that he had heard that he had heard while I was sitting on the dock of the bay. And so Steve wanted to put some of those in the song kind of just to honor that, because Otis Redding never got to hear the finished song. Yeah. So sitting on the dock of the bay was recorded three weeks before his untimely death in December of 1967. He was on a plane, and they were going over some icy waters in Wisconsin on their way to a show. And it will leave we're pretty close to they were very close. I mean, four miles, I think is what I read. But there was some really bad conditions. There's really not anything cited as the true reason for the plane going down. But all but one of the band members in are people on board because the pilot passed away as well. actually survived all but one.\n\nAnd one died. Yes, sorry. Only one survived.\n\nAnd I also thought this was kind of weird. So there weren't enough seats on the plane for the entire band to go from show to show. They always had one. They were like, short one, one seats. Okay. So they always had somebody that would kind of rotate and they that person would fly commercial to the next. So there's one there's actually on the plane and then one that was the one that flew commercial that day.\n\nYeah. I even read that Little Richard had told him like, not Don't, don't be fly in, in these conditions. Like I think there was even some, so it's really hard to be like, Oh, no, like, were they given warnings that they didn't heed? Yeah. How do you know planes? Good enough, we'll be fine. Right?\n\nHow do you know, like, are they thinking what's Wisconsin, there's always going to be, you know, tough conditions. But sitting on the dock of the bay is credited with influencing the soul movement by combining traditional rhythm and blues with folk. And it was what was the billboard sort of? Well, yes, it did receive but an award or not an award. It was a chart topper. But that was after of course, he had already passed away so he didn't get to even see it.\n\n1\n\nSpeaker 1\n\nIt was the first ever posthumous number one. Yes, that's what I was trying to think of that person already been passed away. Yeah. And the song get hits number one, that was the first time that had ever happened. And actually\n\nthree albums of Reddings, recordings were released posthumously. And it wasn't until 1989 that reading was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was in the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1981. And then Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 89. Okay, and then in 99, he received a lifetime achievement Grammy. Yeah, that's cool. That's interesting to think you know, all of that. So long after his passing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I thought this was pretty interesting, too, about the song. Sitting on the dock of the bay, the music licensing company BMI named this as the sixth most performed song of the 20th century. What? With around 6 million performances.\n\nThat's insane. That's insane. I mean, that's, oh, my gosh, I\n\ncan't learn royalty. Yeah, wow.\n\nWow, is right.\n\nWell, he out he actually really sounds like he was a good man, too. I mean, obviously, we didn't know him. But I believe he was really had a heart for different races and cultures, and just how music could supersede that. And I thought that was interesting. When you think about, you know, I think sometimes when things were This was before our lifetimes, right? So that just seems like so long ago. But reading dad five months before Martin Luther King, Jr. was shot in Memphis, and the song was recorded in Memphis. And so think about just all that that is. Amidst all of that racial tension. Here he was with a white producer and a mixed race band. Yeah, singing this song that just supersedes all of that mess.\n\nIt does. It's very peaceful song. Pretty amazing.\n\nAnd yeah, he just seems like he was a good man. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, you know, cared a lot about being a family man. And I think he was probably a pretty good businessman.\n\nYeah, oh, yeah. And I had read, he'd even actually already started his own record label while he was still living. So I think he was business minded as well, really wanting to raise up the next generation of songwriters and artists.\n\nThat's right. And so it's beautiful that his widow has continued that legacy. And yeah, you know, it's cool when the legacy lives on when the person's taken too early. So there's an Otis Redding Foundation, yep. The mission is to empower, enrich and motivate all young people through programs involving music, writing and instrumentation.\n\nThat is awesome. And even before his passing, he was already awarding scholarships to young students to continue their education. And yeah, like you said, the the foundation It was founded in 2007. Okay. And there's an Otis Redding museum. It's located on cotton Avenue right in the heart of downtown Macon, and it has a lot of Otis’ treasures, and they have exclusive merchandise and all the proceeds go to this foundation that we're talking about. But if you're anywhere near Macon, Georgia, and you have a loved one or a family member or friend, that's a young person that has interest in music I made you want to check out some of these programs that the Otis Redding Foundation is doing because they sound awesome. They sound awesome, and the price is so reasonable. So there's a camp dream. It's a one week summer camp that teaches creative arts to elementary school children. Throughout the week, campers will learn about piano guitar percussion, stage movement, they work together to write a song and they perform that at the end of the week, I love it. But that is a week long camp from nine to three. And it’s $200. Yeah, that's unbeatable, for sure. And really good, for sure.\n\nAnd then there's the Otis music camp, which is a two week camp in the summer focused on songwriting, music theory, vocal and performance technique and music business. Okay. Yeah. So probably a little older focus. Yes. On this one. Yeah. So, that might be more high school.\n\nYeah. So they jam packed the week. This year, it's June 7 to 17th. And they do a final performance at the end as well. That's awesome. It's an 11 day program for $400.\n\nThat's amazing. You can't go to any camp for that kind of price. Free VBS at church, but most camps are pretty expensive. Where you’re learning a skill. Yeah. And I loved it, of course because they actually they did a podcast is it I'm saying they did a podcast because I'm not sure if they're producing new episodes. But the Otis Redding Foundation did the dream cast, which was a biweekly podcast created by the students of the oldest music camp and Macon. And each episode of the dream cast features stories and conversations with these artists. And they just tell their stories and that some of them are from Macon. Some of them are from around the world. So you're getting to actually hear the voices of those that experienced the camp. It's very cool. Dreamcast. Very\n\ncool. Well, if this subject has been interesting, and you want more Otis Redding info, or just hearing more about that time period in when he was thriving, I came across a really interesting book. It was actually called Otis Redding, An Unfinished life by Jonathan Gould. What a title. Yeah. He also wrote an article in The New Yorker for the 50th anniversary of Redding’s death. So that was in 2017. Okay. Yeah. That kind of sounded like he was pulling some from this book. But anyhow, the book not only goes a lot into Otis, his life and history, but even kind of what was going on in the world at that time. And it sounded really interesting how they kind of talk about the social history from which he emerged. Yeah, you know, there was a lot of things we were talking about. Yeah. So if you want more dig into Otis Redding and unfinished life by Jonathan Gould.\n\nAnd I would say even you know, we mentioned the Otis Redding Museum. But if you want a broad look at all of the soul music that he was a part of, even the Stax Museum in Memphis is an awesome visit. We've been there and it's well done. It's in the heart of Memphis, and you're going to get to experience not just Otis, but the entire roster of artists that made Wilson Pickett, The Staple sisters and lots of soul artists. So in the museum actually sits where the recording studio once was, it's no longer in business, which is its own sad story. But yeah, it's right there on the premise of where all these great musicians came and recorded songs. So it's really cool. Yeah. All right. Well, I think that does it for this episode of The Steel Magnolias podcast. Hope you've been inspired to just learn a little bit more and if you have forgotten some of the awesome things that Otis Redding did, we hop you will click over to wherever you like to listen to music and listen to a little bit of him today. We'll put a link in our notes to an Otis playlist for y'all. Okay, Lainie, Peace be with you.\n\nAnd also with y’all!"
