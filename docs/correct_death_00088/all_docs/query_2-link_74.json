        "text": "In Memory of Shane Finch\n\nWe are shocked and heartbroken by the sudden and unexpected passing of our dear friend and colleague Shane Finch at the age of 59. Shane worked with MusicMaster from 2013 to 2020 as Vice President of Business Relations, before moving on to ENCO Systems, Inc. and Broadcasters General Store.\n\nShane is truly the embodiment of a life well-lived. Friendship was the cornerstone of his existence, and no matter where Shane went, he collected new friends and ran into old ones. He had an extraordinary gift for not only connecting with people, but treasuring those relationships. If you were lucky enough to call Shane a friend, he became your biggest fan. He lived his life in service of others, sharing his support, encouragement, faith, and an incredibly infectious smile.\n\nShane with some of his MusicMaster colleagues over the years\n\nShane poured his heart and soul into everything he did. He was a creative and talented broadcaster, a remarkable wit, a legendary storyteller, dedicated to serving his community, and devoted to his family. Our hearts go out especially to them during this difficult time.\n\nShane began his career in the early 1980s as a “part-time announcer/promotions gopher” at a radio cluster in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. He went on to work as an on air personality, morning news person, PD, music director, AE, promotions director and operations director at stations in Iowa, Wisconsin and Florida. His longest tenure was with FM stations WTRS and WMFQ in Florida, where he worked for almost 18 years. He was operations director for the 50 kW country and 50 kW Hot AC stations and also did a midday airshift.\n\nIt was at WTRS that Shane first met Dave Tyler, who then served as Music Director and Morning Show host for the station. The two would later work together at MusicMaster, where Dave provides support as a Music Scheduling Consultant. Dave shared:\n\n\"I met Shane Finch when he moved to Ocala in 1995. He was our Ops Manager and I was his ego driven morning guy at WTRS that couldn’t get in rooms because of my swollen self-importance. Within a year Shane fired me. He always said he wished he had handled that differently and I always told him he saved my career, it humbled me and gave me perspective. He hired me back a year or so later and we worked together for 16 more years before he left for MusicMaster. It was one of the first great lessons he gave me.\n\n\"There is no one on the planet I’ve shared more windshield time with from our weeklong road trips to visit MusicMaster stations in the Northeast U.S. to 10 days road trips in Southeastern Canada, to Vegas, Los Angeles and our annual CRS Nashville pilgrimage, The camaraderie, laughs and friendship were monumental. When he left WTRS to go to MusicMaster he opened the door for me to follow.\n\n\"Shane was my best friend and if something good was happening to him he wanted to share it with me. We spoke weekly about our jobs and relationships, and every conversation included him raving about his family and grandbabies! No phone call or in-person meeting ever without us saying “Love you brother”. Shane was not only my favorite person to goof off with but his constant support and steady fellowship made me a stronger in my faith, a better father, man, and employee. His snarky texts, great sense of humor and integrity will stay with me forever. To say I miss him is such an understatement.\"\n\nFrom the 1990s: Shane, Jay Michaels (McCarthy), Keith Hill, Kenny Chesney, Mike McKeel, Dunning Shaw, Dave Tyler\n\nIn 2013, Shane joined MusicMaster. He held various roles in customer relations, sales, and operations before being promoted to VP of Business Relations. During his time at MusicMaster, Shane made it his mission to visit with as many of our clients as possible and spread the love for what we do. He organized many events and weeks-long road trips, visiting with dozens of stations along the way. Below are just some of the many memories from our archives. See if you can spot yourself with Shane!\n\nMusicMaster Founder/President Joe Knapp shared a special kinship with Shane, particularly on their their annual pilgrimages to musical landmarks. Joe shared this story:\n\n\"I met Shane many years ago through Keith Hill. One day, while talking with them both at Conclave, I mentioned that I'd just had a spiritual experience. Shane wanted more details. I explained how I'd visited the spot where Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens all died in a plane crash on a remote Iowa farm. They were both intrigued when I told them that the site was virtually unmarked and very difficult to find. I think that's still true. We made a pact to all visit that site next year on the way to Conclave.\n\n\"This turned into an annual pilgrimage where the three of us, along with Dave-O Thompson and Bill Barr, rented an SUV and drove to Minneapolis, stopping along the way at interesting places. On that first trip, we visited the crash site, along with the Surf Ballroom in Crystal Lake, Iowa where Buddy performed his final show. That place is now an incredible museum and worthy of a visit from anyone who loves music. We also visited the Field Of Dreams set in the middle of nowhere in Iowa, Shane's home state.\n\n\"Subsequent trips included many visits to baseball stadiums. But we focused on music. In the car, we'd all make a \"mix tape\" featuring cool and unusual music we'd discovered. Following the Buddy Holly experience, we started searching for more places where rock stars met an untimely death. Our many trips took us to the places where rock legends like Elvis Presley, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Ricky Nelson, Jim Croce, Otis Redding, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Dan Fogelberg and Chase all passed away.\n\n\"Thanks entirely to Shane, we also got to meet Don Henley's grandmother in Louisiana and Dan Fogelberg's mother. We also visited the Motown house, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the House on the Rock, the Jelly Belly factory, and a whole lot more interesting places. We always found incredible diners, drive-ins and dives to eat some incredible food like BBQ spaghetti at Coletta's in Memphis where Elvis frequented with his posse.\"\n\nAt a memorial for Dan Fogelberg near his childhood home in Peoria: Joe Knapp, Keith Hill, Bill Barr, Dave-O Thompson and Shane Finch\n\nRicky Nelson crash site in De Kalb Texas.\n\nAt the site in Madison, WI where Otis Redding's plane crashed\n\nAt the Motown House in Detroit\n\n\"Shane had this incredible talent for making friends. He truly loved meeting new people. We could not have done these trips without him, nor would these trips have been so interesting. He turned most of them into sermons that he delivered to his congregation after returning to Florida.\n\n\"Through Shane, we met a woman in Mississippi who lived in a trailer home across the way from the farm where the Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crashed. Of course, Shane found her while researching in preparation for our drive. She knew the Vietnamese farmer who owned the land. That guy wouldn't let anyone enter his property, but she got us in there. In fact, that farmer turned out to be a nice guy. He drove us all up into the deep woods to the exact spot where the plane hit the ground. As sunset neared, we got out of there quickly as snakes began falling from the trees! The nice young woman invited us into her home for some wonderful home-made barbecue. She showed us her collection of Lynyrd Skynyrd mementoes, including the door from the airplane that held the stairs on the inside. She then invited us to a bar where her band was playing that night. It was a wonderful experience. But, there's more. Shane found out that the girl had terminal leukemia. He maintained a close relationship with her after our visit. I'm sure they prayed together and that he gave her whatever comfort he could. Typical Shane, and now you know the rest of the story.\n\n\"I had a dream Saturday night that Shane was visiting every one of those rock legends up in Heaven...\"\n\nWe thank you Shane for your service in this industry and for MusicMaster, but above all, the great privilege of your friendship. Though we mourn your loss, we will forever carry the gifts you have given us. We are all better for having known you, and you will be missed beyond measure.\n\nMaximize Your Voice Tracking Library with Special Sets\n\nby Jesus Rodriguez\n\nNever let voice track recordings go to waste again! Why have your on-air personality record one short segment once and then delete it? Why not use the voice track again? Did enough people hear the voice track that was only seconds long? Why not maximize it and use it again?\n\nThere are so many more questions I can ask but you get the point. In this blog, I hope to open your mind to that idea. This was originally targeted to smaller stations where there may only be a few on air personalities or none, like some streamers or HD channels. However, this concept can be useful for any station at any level for several reasons. What if your jock loses their voice or is ill and can’t come in to work? The remote jock that voice tracks lost power or internet and can’t do the tracks? Maybe give the jock a break and truly let them enjoy their vacation not having to voice track the days they are out. I mean, does it really count as a vacation when you still must do the work from your vacation time?\n\nThe goal is to save all your voice tracks in a category or multiple categories if you prefer so that you can repurpose them the same way you do your new music or your gold records. We will create a new multiple keyword field so you can give your voice tracks and songs any number of descriptions that will allow the proper voice track to play in front of the correct songs. This will allow you to create a massive library of voice tracks overtime and the more you have, the better it will sound because your listeners will not catch on.\n\nFor the first step, let’s create the multiple keyword field. You can do this yourself if you are using MusicMaster Version 7 or greater. On the menu bar go to Dataset, Library, Fields, then at the bottom left corner, click on Add Field. Create the settings as shown in the image below.\n\nPress OK to create the new field and OK again on the Field list window to return to the database.\n\nIf you did not do so already you can create your Voice Tracking category and add your Voice Tracks information the same way you do with songs. In case you need a reminder of those steps, I included them in the links below with short 1 minute video clips.\n\nHow to Create a New Category Video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FZ1azvQfAow\n\nHow to Add Music/Voice Tracks to Your Library Video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ockIX0Ue3U8\n\nNext, you will want to add your new field to your library layout so you can begin to label each of your voice tracks accordingly. This tells MusicMaster what they are, so that in the next step, I can show you how they will match up to the perfect song each time. Double click on that new field in your library layout to open up the Keyword entry.\n\nBelow are examples of a few of my voice tracks. Each voice track will have a description designating what songs they will be allowed to play in front of.\n\nVoice Track 1: Only be allowed to play in front of Katy Perry’s “Firework”\n\nVoice Track 2: Can play in front of any song where I also gave that song the keyword description of Listener Phoner. This is great for songs with long intros.\n\nVoice Track 3: This Voice Track may be good in front of any song if all the songs have the keyword of Station Info in this same field.\n\nVoice Track 4: This recording may only play in front of any Katy Perry song because it possibly is a generic topic about the artist that works any time of the year like “Did you know Katy is a huge fan of… Here she is on XYZ-FM!”\n\nYou will repeat this process with all your voice tracks and my personal recommendation is to only give your voice tracks one description. Another recommendation is to use voice tracks that are not seasonal or contain current events like “this week this next artist got a divorce” or “this artist will perform on the Channel 8 Christmas Special”\n\nSo how do we match the voice tracks to the songs you ask? It is a similar process to what we did with the voice tracks in the previous step. I suggest taking note of the descriptions you created for the voice tracks so you can use those same keywords in the same field we created, but for the songs themselves. It is important that the keywords be written the same so they find their match later in the process.\n\nYou will want to go through every song and add all the keywords for voicetracks that will sound great in front of the song. In this case the more the better, because more options you have, the less likely to sound repetitive with your voice tracks.\n\nFor Katy Perry “Firework”, I included the following voice track keywords we created that are all allowed to play in front of this song.\n\nHow do we do the actual matching of the correct voice track to the correct song? This is where we use Special Sets in the clock positions where your talk breaks will occur. In your clock add a Special Set element position as shown below.\n\nYou will want to make sure that your Voice Track category is bypassed from the all-category section of the rule tree by right clicking on the bold MusicMaster Rule Tree and going to Rule Tree Properties as shown below to place a check mark on that category. This will prevent any other rules in the all-category section from affecting this category, and we can place any rule we need directly in the category, which I will explain later in this blog.\n\nAlso, go to the menu Dataset, Schedule, Schedule Properties to adjust the scheduling pass order. You will want your special set to schedule last, so move it to the bottom of the list so that your music schedules first followed by the voice tracking category special set to match. This is important because without the song in the log first, the voice track category will not have anything to reference to make the proper decision of which voice track to place in front of it. I also suggest you set the depth for the voice track category to 100% so it can dig in deep enough to locate the best option, should you decide to use additional rules.\n\nWe can take this a step further in the Rule Tree for the Voice Track category and add rules for the Voice Tracking field we created for things like Keyword Separation, so we don’t get the same tracks too close to each other or sounding repetitive. We can also add more rules, such as dayparting, so the right jock voice plays during the right shift. Minimum rest, Day or Play Offset, and other rules can help with the rotations, so the tracks don’t play as frequently or in the same positions, allowing you to maximize the voice tracks for weeks, months, even years.\n\nNow for the fun part! Call all your friends and family members that owe you favors and have them record a lot of exciting voice tracks for your station. I also hear AI voices are sounding very realistic these days at reading back scripts, so maybe it’s time to hit the record button."
