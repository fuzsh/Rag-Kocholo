Which category does the proposed name fall under?\n\nProminent national or local figure who is deceased\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, describe why this person is considered prominent. “Prominent” is defined as “widely and popularly known.”\n\nEddy attended UW Madison and was the Valedictorian of his class 2000. He died of bacterial meningitis while at UW but his entire life was about reading and learning.\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, what is the significance of the person specifically to the Madison Metropolitan School District that it should choose to name a school for this particular person over others of similar prominence?\n\nThe significance of Eddy to the Madison Metro School District is that he loved learning like no other child!! He began reading very early in his life before he entered school. He shared his love of reading and learning with all others!!\n\nAt his funeral, many of his high school friends said he helped them learn math when they were failing and they graduated because of him.\n\nIn 4th grade at his school conference his teacher told us there was a boy in the class that no one could teach except for Eddy. So his teacher said she hoped we didn’t mind that she let Eddy teach Demetrius for 1 hour each school day!\n\nHe loved Madison too and learning. He was chosen to go to College for Kids at UW Madison when he was in elementary school. His love of learning was unprecedented. I have his many academic awards hanging in his bedroom.\n\nHis biggest gift of all was his kindness though. He would be the best symbol of love for learning for that school, even though he grew up in Jefferson. He’s a role model for every school in my opinion.\n\nHe was 6’4, 245 lbs and a gentle giant. He read through the night many nights!\n\nHe told me as a freshman in high school that he wanted to be his class of 2000 valedictorian, and he did just that. We were in awe of him, but he was humble and kind.\n\nWhen I was in the throes of grief and could not understand his death, my sister said “it’s because Eddy had figured out life and lived the way we are all supposed to live.”\n\nOn his scholarship application in high school he stated “I know I am young and have a lot to learn, but I have already learned that we are here for the purpose of helping others.”\n\nThis school and staff would be proud to be named after Eddy because his love of learning was infectious. He had been bullied some in his younger years, but it made him even kinder.\n\nHe started the chess club at his school and many children have learned chess because of Eddy. His headstone has a giant King chess piece because he was the embodiment of love and learning. We called him our King of Hearts.\n\nHis passing from bacterial meningitis while a student at UW Madison was and is unfathomable but even in death Eddy was teaching through us as we worked hard to get two laws passed to protect the children in Wisconsin from meningitis. He would insist we do that!\n\nThank you for considering Eddy!!\n\nProposal # 19\n\nQ. What individuals/groups are proposing the name?\n\nBetty Franklin-Hammonds\n\nQ.

On April 28th, Madison lost a dedicated advocate and a dear friend: Betty Franklin-Hammonds.\n\nBetty's life story is a catalogue of remarkable achievements. From her tenure as the executive director of the Madison Urban League, where she spearheaded a study on the gap in achievement between black and white students in the Madison school system, to her leadership at the Madison Times and the numerous awards she received for her work, there are countless examples of Betty's effectiveness as an advocate in the community.\n\nBut it was her character, more than any title or award, that defined Betty and made her such a powerful presence in our community. She was a truth teller who never backed down from a fight, a woman who led by example and wasn't shy about asking others to make the commitment to change she demanded from herself.\n\nBetty was a unique combination of a quiet dignity and a fierce passion for justice that could only be quenched by constant motion. She worked tirelessly, as a social worker, at the Madison chapter of the NAACP, at the Urban League, and at the Madison Times, to make our city a better place.\n\nHer own words tell us more about Betty than any tribute ever could. After receiving an award for her humanitarian work, she once told a crowd that “everybody can be great because everybody can serve.” By that measure, Betty Franklin-Hammonds was great indeed.\n\nProposal # 66\n\nQ. What individuals/groups are proposing the name?\n\nErin Nunez\n\nQ. What is the proposed name?\n\nJudith “Judy” Heumann Elementary School\n\nQ. Which category does the proposed name fall under?\n\nProminent national or local figure who is deceased\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, describe why this person is considered prominent. “Prominent” is defined as “widely and popularly known.”\n\nJudith “Judy” Heumann (1947-2023)—was at the forefront of major disability rights demonstrations, helped spearhead the passage of disability rights legislation, founded national and international disability advocacy organizations, held senior federal government positions, co-authored her memoir, Being Heumann, and its Young Adult version, Rolling Warrior, and was featured in the Oscar-nominated documentary film, Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution.\n\nBorn in 1947 in Philadelphia and raised in Brooklyn, New York to parents Ilse and Werner Heumann, Judy contracted polio at age two. Her doctor advised her parents to institutionalize her when it was clear that she would never be able to walk. “Institutionalization was the status quo in 1949,” she wrote. “Kids with disabilities were considered a hardship, economically and socially.” When Judy attempted to enter kindergarten, the principal blocked her family from entering the school, labeling her a “fire hazard.” However, her parents, particularly her mother, fought back and demanded that Judy have access to a classroom. Judy eventually was able to attend a special school, high school, Long Island University (from which she earned a B.A. in 1969), and the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned a Master’s in Public Health six years later.\n\nIn the 1970s, Heumann attended Camp Jened, a summer camp for people with disabilities in the Catskills, and she later returned there as a counselor. Several of the leaders of the disability rights movement also were at Camp Jened, which was the focus of the documentary Crip Camp.\n\nDuring the same decade, the New York Board of Education refused to give Judy a teaching license because they feared she could not help evacuate students or herself in case of fire. She sued and went on to become the first teacher in the state to use a wheelchair. Continuing her fight for civil rights, Judy helped lead a protest that shut down traffic in Manhattan against Richard Nixon’s veto of the 1972 Rehabilitation Act, and she launched a 26-day sit-in at a federal building in San Francisco to get Section 504 of the revived Rehabilitation Act enforced.\n\nJudy was instrumental in developing and implementing national disability rights legislation, including Section 504, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n\nIn addition, Judy helped found the Berkley Center for Independent Living, the Independent Living Movement, and the World Institute on Disability. She also served on the boards of the American Association of People with Disabilities, the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, Humanity and Inclusion, Human Rights Watch, the United States International Council on Disability, Save the Children, and several others.\n\nIn 1993, Judy moved to Washington, D.C. to serve as the Assistant Secretary of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services in the Clinton Administration, a role she filled until 2001. From 2002-2006, she served as the first Advisor on Disability and Development at the World Bank. From 2010-2017, during the Obama Administration, she worked as the first Special Advisor for International Disability Rights at the U.S. State Department. She also was appointed as Washington, D.C.’s first Director for the Department on Disability Services.\n\n(credit for listed bio: Judith Heumann LLC)\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, what is the significance of the person specifically to the Madison Metropolitan School District that it should choose to name a school for this particular person over others of similar prominence?\n\nJudy played an important role in creating and implementing disability rights legislation, including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Her work promoted equity and eliminated barriers to accessing public education.\n\nProposal # 67\n\nQ. What individuals/groups are proposing the name?\n\nDiana Cook\n\nQ. What is the proposed name?\n\nThe Shirley School\n\nQ. Which category does the proposed name fall under?\n\nProminent national or local figure who is deceased\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, describe why this person is considered prominent. “Prominent” is defined as “widely and popularly known.”\n\nShirley Abrahamson was the first woman on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and its longest-serving justice--nearly 43 years. Upon her death in December 2020, Governor Tony Evers said, \"Her legacy is defined not just by being a first, but [by] her life's work of ensuring she would not be the last, paving and lighting the way for the many women and others who would come after her. . . . Few others have given so much of themselves to the cause of public service in Wisconsin. . . . She was a pillar of our state and the court for generations, . . . one of our state's most extraordinary public servants.\"\n\nShirley graduated first in her law school class and its only woman at a time when there were few women in the legal profession. Throughout her career, she helped to open doors for many others, advanced women's opportunities and well-being in law, and inspired women in the legal community as a mentor, role model, and friend. A significant number of women went into law because of her.\n\nShe was one of the first women lawyers in Madison, in the 1960s, and one of her first projects was to help draft Madison's groundbreaking open- housing law. As a supreme court justice, she was well known through her travels around the state and for her integrity and legendary work ethic. She earned a reputation as one of the most respected legal minds in the nation. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, \"Shirley Abrahamson is the best, the most courageous and sage, the least self-regarding. She has inspired legions to follow in her way, to strive constantly to make the legal system genuinely equal and accessible to all.\"\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, what is the significance of the person specifically to the Madison Metropolitan School District that it should choose to name a school for this particular person over others of similar prominence?\n\nShirley--she told everyone to \"just call me Shirley\"--was the daughter of immigrants from Eastern Europe and worked in her parents' grocery store. She helped her parents learn English, and they became naturalized citizens and steadfast voters. \"I am the child of immigrants,\" she said, \"and I think that influenced me a great deal, that this country was open. No doors were to be closed.\" Her parents emphasized education, and she was educated in public schools. Growing up among immigrants was a formative experience, a basis for a lifetime of work focused on equal treatment for all.\n\nAs chief justice, Shirley created outreach programs to demystify the work of the courts and make them more accessible to the public, such as services for interpreters and teaching tools for educators. She often visited elementary schools and helped children learn about Wisconsin courts and how judges make decisions with the hypothetical case of Tootsie the Goldfish. Waving her invisible magic wand (\"Poof, you are all judges!\"), she guided the class all the way to the supreme court in deciding whether a landlord can evict a tenant and his goldfish when the lease doesn't allow pets. The children applied rules to a set of facts and values, similar to decisions they made every day to solve problems at home and at school. They tried to be fair and reasonable and talked about how disputes are settled. As chief justice, Shirley developed the Tootsie the Goldfish lesson plan and other educational resources about the justice system--programs and publications for teachers, an activity book for children--that are available online at wicourts.gov/courts/resources.\n\nFor more than 50 years, Shirley's home was located only a mile or two from 501 E. Badger Road, and her son attended elementary and middle schools in their district. Because she wanted everyone to call her \"Shirley,\" a fitting name for the new school is The Shirley School. As the diverse students of The Shirley School learn about its namesake, they may realize that if they work hard in school and for what they believe in, they can do great things, whatever their origins and obstacles.\n\nProposal # 68\n\nQ.

He was 57.\n\nMayor Dave Cieslewicz issued a release expressing sadness and sympathy to Parks’ family and to the city of Madison.\n\n“Gene challenged the citizens and leaders of Madison to tackle different issues in our community,” Cieslewicz said. “Whether you agreed with him or not, Gene Parks made a unique and lasting contribution to our city.”\n\nAccording to Ald. Mike Verveer, District 4, a friend of Parks, Parks was always challenging those who were in power, although he had some challenging times in City Hall.\n\n“He was definitely a Madison original,” Verveer said. “He cared passionately about civil rights and human rights.”\n\nThe Equal Opportunities Commission mourned the death of the Madison native as well, citing his contributions as an alderperson, assistant to Fire Chief Edward Drukin and director of the city’s Affirmative Action Department.\n\n“You always knew where Gene stood,” the commission’s release said. “A small business owner who in his own manner was a champion for civil rights. He was not afraid to take a stand.”\n\nParks became the first black alderperson for the Madison City Council in 1969 when he was 22 years old. He was also the president of the Madison chapter of the NAACP.\n\nParks ran for mayor in 1999 against Sue Bauman. He campaigned out of his home at 1616 Beld St., which was also the location of his former business, a tavern called Mr. P’s. He was defeated by Bauman and earned approximately 20 percent of the vote.\n\nDuring his race against Bauman and throughout his entire life, he fought against racial segregation and discrimination.\n\n“This country is as segregated today as it was 50 years ago and Wisconsin is the most racially segregated state in America,” Parks told The Badger Herald while running for mayor. “Including Madison, this so-called liberal town.”\n\nAccording to Verveer, while Parks was an alderperson, much of his district included areas of campus and many of his constituents were students. Parks supported important student issues such as affordable housing.\n\n“Students make up 20 to 25 percent of the population and are still used as slaves for housing income,” Parks told The Badger Herald before the election. “It is a crying shame what it costs to live here.”\n\nVerveer said Parks always gave a great speech and in addition to his strong political beliefs, he had a very good sense of humor.\n\n“He was a very colorful character,” Verveer said. “He was always very entertaining.”\n\nShare Tweet\n\nThis article was published Mar 1, 2005 at 12:00 am and last updated Mar 1, 2005 at 12:00 am\n\nQ.

Which category does the proposed name fall under?\n\nProminent national or local figure who is deceased\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, describe why this person is considered prominent. “Prominent” is defined as “widely and popularly known.”\n\nShirley Abrahamson was the first woman to serve on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the first woman to serve as its Chief Justice, and the longest serving state Supreme Court justice in the nation's history. Justice Abrahamson was a lifelong teacher, and an advocate and defender of the Wisconsin Idea. She was a fierce protector against invidious discrimination, integrated the Madison Club to women, and drafted for Madison the state’s first fair housing ordinance. Within Madison, where for half a century she lived on the south side, she mentored scores of women and girls entering public service and championed public schools.\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, what is the significance of the person specifically to the Madison Metropolitan School District that it should choose to name a school for this particular person over others of similar prominence?\n\nJustice Abrahamson made immense contributions to the Madison Metropolitan School District and to students and teachers throughout Wisconsin. Despite her busy work as a Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Justice Abrahamson visited countless classrooms in Madison and throughout the state and initiated numerous programs to help students better understand the court system and how it impacts people’s lives.\n\nIn an introduction to the book, Connecting to the Courts: A Teacher’s Guide to the Wisconsin Courts, Justice Abrahamson explains why she regarded outreach to our public schools as so important: “Alexis de Tocqueville, the great 19th-century writer and student of American democracy, observed that most public issues in the United States eventually become legal issues. Indeed, Americans do turn to the law every day to resolve their disputes. America’s schools have an important role to play in fostering public understanding of the law and the justice system, but they can’t be expected to do it alone. We hope that … this book will help our schools to build young adults who have confidence in our legal system, who feel that they have full access to the services this system can provide, and who value the role of law in our society.”\n\nOne significant example of Justice Abrahamson’s contributions to our classrooms is the Court with Class program, which she initiated in conjunction with the Wisconsin State Bar. Since its inception in 1996, this program has brought tens of thousands of students into the Wisconsin Supreme Court Hearing Room at our State Capitol to witness live oral arguments. During oral arguments, students hear lawyers on each side make their arguments while being questioned by justices of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. After the argument, students meet with a justice to discuss the role of a justice and how a case is decided. Before visiting, teachers receive plain-language case summaries to help students understand the issues at stake in a particular case.\n\nJustice Abrahamson also recognized that it is important to engage students with humor and creativity. This is amply demonstrated by her “Tootsie the Goldfish” lesson plan, which she created to help students learn about the courts and how judges make decisions, and which she herself used in her many visits to classrooms. As she explains in A Teacher’s Guide to the Wisconsin Courts, this lesson plan involves a (fictitious) law that prohibits tenants from having pets but neglects to define the term “pet.” Justice Abrahamson would divide the classroom into a circuit court, an intermediate appellate court, and a state supreme court, with each court making a determination as to whether Tootsie the Goldfish was a “pet” under the statute and was therefore subject to eviction. During the process, Justice Abrahamson would explain the role of each court and how the court decides a case.\n\nAlthough her “Tootsie the Goldfish” lesson plan was filled with levity, it also included this important instruction to the students regarding the role of a judge: “I want you all to close your eyes and ponder the fate of Tootsie. I want each of you ‘judges’ to make up your own minds and not be influenced by how others decide the case. A key attribute of good judges is that they have open minds—they are neutral, they listen carefully to the facts, they search the law, they weigh the arguments. But each judge must make up his or her mind and vote independently, and not be pressured by other judges, the media, or public opinion. Tough decisions will not always be popular ones.”\n\nJustice Abrahamson was also instrumental in developing Law Day planning kits, which included a variety of fun activities to help elementary, middle school, and high school students understand the courts’ vital role in our government. Each planning kit involved a different theme, such as “Celebrating Access to Justice: Brown v. Board at 50;” “Celebrate Your Freedom: Assuring Access to Justice for All;” “Celebrate Your Freedom: Independent Courts Protect our Liberties;” “In the Best Interest of Our Children;” and “The American Jury: We the People in Action.”\n\nA last example is the iCivics program that Justice Abrahamson helped bring to Wisconsin’s classrooms, serving as its co-chair. This program is an innovative web-based civics education project initiated by retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, featuring interactive online games developed for middle-school students and teaching guides and lesson plans for teachers. Justice O’Connor visited Madison in May 2010 at the invitation of Justice Abrahamson and the State Bar of Wisconsin to help launch iCivics in Wisconsin.\n\nThese are just a few of the many ways that Justice Abrahamson served the students and teachers of our public schools, including MMSD, where her own child attended school.\n\nProposal # 78\n\nQ. What individuals/groups are proposing the name?\n\nThe Family of Lori Mann Carey\n\nQ. What is the proposed name?\n\nLori Mann Carey Elementary School\n\nQ. Which category does the proposed name fall under?\n\nProminent national or local figure who is deceased\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, describe why this person is considered prominent. “Prominent” is defined as “widely and popularly known.”\n\nLori Mann Carey (2/27/60–11/16/20) was a beloved force across South Madison and beyond. She was widely and popularly known in many spaces:\n\n1) Madison Treasure - Lori grew up on Madison’s Southside along with her four siblings in a household where education was a top priority and where she was inspired by example to engage with love and purpose in her community. That’s exactly what she did her entire life. . .making a difference everywhere she went. She was a Madison treasure, leader, and education equity champion - and her light continues to shine in hearts and minds across the community.\n\n2) High School Standout – Lori attended Memorial High School where she was voted co-captain of the track team, earning “All American” status as part of the state record-setting mile relay team. She also played varsity basketball where her enthusiasm for others and uplifting words always brought out the very best in her teammates. Her light carried across the student body when school administration, recognizing Lori’s natural leadership and gift of encouragement, invited her to deliver commencement remarks to her classmates at her school graduation ceremony.\n\n3) “Mama Carey” – As a transformative and loving mother, Lori not only embraced motherhood with her own five children, she also brought her good energy and guidance to countless others. Known by many as “Mama Carey,” Lori’s prominence was as a community mom who took to heart the phrase: “It takes a village to raise a child.” She attended parent-teacher conferences with kids who needed support, helped students fill out financial aid forms, wrote letters of recommendation, drove students to/from school, delivered coats for kids in need, helped feed students, and, as many know, was the ultimate cheerleader for student athletes citywide, from ringing cow bells at football games to her “shoot the ball” chants at basketball tournaments. Her wide popularity with students and families across the community came from the respect she earned with her dedication and contributions to so many lives.\n\n4) Parent Leader – A well-known advocate for MMSD students, Lori was asked by Administration to serve on the selection committee for the principal of West High School when there was a vacancy in 2014. She also served on the African American Parent Leadership Council and spoke several times at school board meetings, delivering innovative ideas and finding ways to create lasting change through partnership.\n\n5) Visionary – Lori envisioned and created the non-profit Mission 4.0, an after-school enrichment program that provided students a suite of culturally-sensitive interconnected supports – tutoring, intentional motivational messaging, parent/family engagement, meals, social-emotional learning and educational enrichment activities. The program successfully piloted at West High School for three consecutive years (through June 2018) impacting hundreds of students and families over that time, with a vision to expand to every high school in Madison. The program’s wide appeal came from its non-traditional approach, reaching students participating in after-school extra-curricular activities and inviting all students into the program with no minimum qualifying criteria. The only criterion was to have a desire to achieve academic success.\n\n6) Co-Founder, Mann Educational Opportunity Fund – Lori helped create and served for decades as head of the Mann Educational Opportunity Fund, which was established more than 30 years ago by family, close friends and the community to honor her parents, the late Bernard and Kathlyn Mann. As long-time education advocates in Madison, Lori’s mom and dad were her inspiration to continue their work supporting at risk students across the city. The program typically selects 3-5 MMSD incoming high school freshman each year, primarily students of color, who are supported academically and financially (with a $1,000 annual stipend), with the goal of achieving academic success and high school graduation.\n\n7) Financial Literacy Ambassador – Lori earned a degree in accounting from Florida A&M University and used her expertise and professional experience to boost financial literacy in the community. In addition to teaching “Math of Finance” at Madison College, Lori also spoke at Madison Black Chamber of Commerce events during tax season, providing tips and other literacy basics to the community. Lori served on the MBCC Board since its inception in 2004 and, for a time, served as Treasurer and later, prior to her passing, was the accountant to the organization.\n\n8) Generous Entrepreneur – Lori took up entrepreneurship in 1989, opening TaxMann Tax & Accounting Services and kicking off a lifetime of support to small businesses, non-profits, and the often-underserved community of Madison’s Southside. Her considerate pricing was often “below market” (or free) so that all customers could afford her services, regardless of their circumstances.\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, what is the significance of the person specifically to the Madison Metropolitan School District that it should choose to name a school for this particular person over others of similar prominence?\n\nPlacing the name of Lori Mann Carey on this school would represent a full circle moment, maybe even a dose of the supernatural. Her connections to the grounds of the new Southside elementary school and the opportunity today to celebrate her there are beautiful. In the fall of 1965, more than 57 years ago on her first day of kindergarten, Lori walked through the doors of the very same building (location) that now houses Badger Rock Middle School and Neighborhood Center. What was then known as Badger Elementary School is where Lori learned her ABCs, spelling and basic math. . .It’s where she played outside on the playground, laughing, being silly and having fun with new friends. . .Most of all, it’s where she had her very first experience with the power of faith. The story, told by Lori repeatedly to her children and loved ones, goes something like this: As part of outdoor gym class at Badger, Lori had to run several laps on the gravel track, timed with a stopwatch. In her struggle to finish the final lap, she wanted to give up, to quit, to walk instead. She said a prayer and just as she was about to stop, she felt God pick her up and carry her over the track to finish her run. In November of 2020, the impact of that childhood experience led Lori back to that very same location. She walked the school grounds before meeting with her doctor about the progression of her cancer. And she said a prayer. . .We don’t know the full content of that prayer but we do know Lori crushed the doctor’s estimate for the number of days she had left, allowing her to receive in her final days an unending outpouring of love that came from across the city and beyond, before she finally became an angel.\n\nAlong with Lori’s unique connection to the grounds of the new Southside elementary school, her significance to MMSD cannot be overstated. Here it is in a nutshell:\n\nMMSD Student – Lori attended MMSD schools from kindergarten through her senior year in high school:\n\nBadger Elementary School: 1965–1970 (K – 4th grade)\n\nFranklin Elementary School: 1970–1971 (5th grade)\n\nLincoln Middle School: 1971–1974 (6th - 8th grade)\n\nMemorial High School: 1974–1978 (9th–12th grade)\n\nMMSD Parent - Contributing, engaging, and advocating on behalf of her own five children (all graduated from West High School), “Mama Carey” also generously shared herself, serving as a pillar of support for all kids, including those who were struggling, hurting and in need of a “safe space” in their educational journey. See previous section.\n\nMMSD Partner – Lori was an enthusiastic partner with the school district as both a parent and innovator. She successfully built relationships based on trust and goodwill, establishing valued partnerships with the MMSD Superintendent, school principals, teachers, counselors, coaches along with Administration collaborators in Strategic Partnerships & Innovation; Grants and Fund Development; and Family, Youth & Community Engagement.\n\nLegacy MMSD Partnership – Lori’s parents, the late Bernard and Kathlyn Mann, deeply valued education with a conviction that all students deserve an education that prepares them to fulfill their goals and achieve a life of purpose. They partnered with Madison’s school district throughout the 60s, 70s and 80s to support that conviction and, when they passed away in the late 80s, family, close friends and the community joined forces to create the Mann Educational Opportunity Fund also known as Mann Scholars program. Under Lori’s leadership, the program has partnered with MMSD since the first students entered the program in 1997.\n\nLori stated many times that the education equity work to which she committed herself day-in and day-out was guided first by her faith, second by the legacy and values of her parents, and next by a broadly respected community value she supported by example: “To cultivate the potential in every student to thrive as a global citizen by inspiring love of learning and civic engagement, by challenging and supporting every student to achieve academic excellence, and by embracing the full richness and diversity of our community.” These words, purposefully sourced by Lori from MMSD’s strategic framework (released July 2013), informed so much of the work she did in the community.\n\nLori did more than just grow up in Madison. . .She engaged fully, gave to others and contributed her entire life to make a difference in her community. There is gratitude for the gifts she shared and there is no better way to express it than by lifting her name - a mile from her Southside home to which she walked from school with her siblings - on to the very school where she began her educational journey and first experienced the power of faith. These early life experiences were a “deliverer of destiny” and, says the nominators, may her legacy of transformative community love be reflected on the new Southside elementary school on Badger Road.\n\nSubmitted by:\n\nThe Family of Lori Mann Carey\n\nProposal # 85\n\nQ. What individuals/groups are proposing the name?\n\nTravis Dobson\n\nQ. What is the proposed name?\n\nJuan Jose Lopez elementary\n\nQ. Which category does the proposed name fall under?\n\nProminent national or local figure who is deceased\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, describe why this person is considered prominent. “Prominent” is defined as “widely and popularly known.”\n\nJuan Jose Lopez was the 1st Latino elected to the mmsd school board,he was director of many important things in Madison and Wisconsin including, project opportunity, the boys and girls club of Dane county, briarpatch and a section chief at the state Department of Workforce Development’s Division of Employment & Training,He was also a cofounder of the Latino Professionals Association of Greater Madison, and served on the board of the United Migrant Opportunity Services in Milwaukee, Nuestro Mundo School in Madison, One City Schools, Rotary Foundation and the Latino Chamber of Commerce.\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, what is the significance of the person specifically to the Madison Metropolitan School District that it should choose to name a school for this particular person over others of similar prominence?\n\nJuan Jose Lopez dedicated his life to a city that he moved to when attending UW Madison and never left and made Madison WI his home from the very start of being in Madison he dedicated his life to making Madison a better place for Hispanic people but he didn't stop there as he advocated for all people that were disadvantaged especially kids he worked so hard at project opportunity that he was working 18 hours a day and got very sick from the stress but he never gave up on the 16 kids in the program and their families and was like a father to many of the kids. Also during this time Juan ran for the school board and won becoming the 1st Hispanic on the board and ended up serving 3 terms and was board president. After project opportunity was done he became the director of briarpatch in Madison, then after that he was director of the boys and girls club of Dane county. Even after he was done with those places he never stopped fighting for all kids in Madison and Dane county there are so many people and kids that he helped directly or indirectly it's hard to put a number on it. There is very few people who truly dedicate their lives to helping others and Juan Jose Lopez was one of them and we might never see a person like him again in our lifetime. Juan Jose Lopez truly made Madison a better place for everyone.\n\nProposal # 119\n\nQ. What individuals/groups are proposing the name?\n\nSuzanne Welles\n\nQ. What is the proposed name?\n\nLori Mann Carey Elementary School\n\nQ. Which category does the proposed name fall under?\n\nProminent national or local figure who is deceased\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, describe why this person is considered prominent. “Prominent” is defined as “widely and popularly known.”\n\nLori Mann Carey was a well-known Southside Madison resident her entire life. Not only was she a lifelong resident, but a person who relentlessly gave to support the educational and personal needs of the community. When her parents passed away the family started the Bernard and Kathlyn Mann Scholarship to support students in Madison. Lori started her own Mission 4.0 program to help Madison’s students succeed in high school, and continued to help students fill out college applications, wrote letters and helped them to move into the higher education system.\n\nI met Lori in high school at James Madison Memorial (now Vel Phillips) when we were 14 years old. She was an outstanding student and was the student speaker at our graduation ceremony. She was not only an excellent student but a high achieving athlete as well. She was part of our track team that took state in 1977. Her name is still in the walls for all the records we set that year. After high school Lori went on to earn an undergraduate and masters degree, as did all of her siblings. She was a CPA who helped many Madisonians with personal and professional accounts. She raised her 5 children in the Madison Metropolitan School District, and never missed a beat supporting them in the classroom, activities, and sporting events. She was well-known for her chants and cow bell at meets and games. I could go on about how Lori Mann Carey IS Southside Madison. I’m hoping that her name will on the school to represent this powerhouse, relentless African American woman who lead the way for success in many arenas for many Madison children and families over the years. She wasn’t a famous person, but a humble behind the scene’s advocate who changed lives for the better right here at home in Madison. How lovely it would be for people to find out who Lori was, and the ability for change every individual possesses, no matter how small or big a name. Please consider this prominent Madisonian, Lori Mann Carey, for the permanent name for the Southside school.\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, what is the significance of the person specifically to the Madison Metropolitan School District that it should choose to name a school for this particular person over others of similar prominence?\n\nSee above\n\nProposal # 140\n\nQ. What individuals/groups are proposing the name?\n\nTina Marie A. Weishoff\n\nQ. What is the proposed name?\n\nMarlene Ann Cummings Elementary School\n\nQ. Which category does the proposed name fall under?\n\nProminent national or local figure who is deceased; Idea or concept which represents a broadly respected civic virtue\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, describe why this person is considered prominent. “Prominent” is defined as “widely and popularly known.”\n\nMarlene Cummings made a difference in her community from the moment she moved to Madison with her family in 1968. Throughout the 60s and 70s, she wrote, hosted, and produced programs for local TV stations that helped children understand physical differences and avoid prejudice.\n\nA career chameleon, Marlene excelled and thrived in a career spanning five decades, always in the service of others. In addition to her work with children, television and journalism, she served a record 14-year tenure as the Secretary of Licensing and Regulation for Governor Tommy Thompson, worked as Special Advisor for Women’s Initiatives under Governor Lee Dreyfus, owned and operated a temporary employment agency, provided psychiatric nursing services, and was an accomplished artist. Most importantly, she was a loving mother, wife, family member, and friend to all who were lucky enough to know her.\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, what is the significance of the person specifically to the Madison Metropolitan School District that it should choose to name a school for this particular person over others of similar prominence?\n\nPart of Marlene’s legacy lives in the hearts of those who grew up in Madison, Wisconsin in the 1970s. Beginning in 1969, starting as a volunteer, Marlene served as the human relations consultant for kindergarten through fifth grade in the Madison metropolitan school district. In this role, Marlene conceived and implemented a curriculum to reduce prejudice by teaching students how to respect their own and others’ individual differences. Building on this work, Marlene brought her curriculum to school districts across the U.S. and Canada; invited to write a column in the Wisconsin State Journal called “Dear Mrs. Cummings” to answer children’s questions about individual differences and prejudice; and wrote, produced, and hosted three children’s television shows about understanding prejudice. Marlene was known for her use of puppets in her anti-prejudice work and said this was because the puppets “could say things to children she couldn’t as an adult.”\n\nQ. If the proposed name is an idea or concept which is a broadly respected community value, what is the significance of this idea or concept to the Madison Metropolitan School District? For what reason would the Madison Metropolitan School District choose to name a building for this particular idea or concept?\n\nMrs. Marlene Cummings and the repeated lessons she taught us showed us how people were created the same — that our biology was almost identical and that the color of our skin came from melanin. Those facts made it so obvious to me that there was no reason to treat people differently because of the color of their skin, that no one would ever do that.\n\nCummings was a registered nurse with training in psychiatric and public health and she started volunteering in public school classrooms, using puppets and games to talk with kids about “differences” and prejudice. “That includes physical handicaps, mental handicaps, obesity, being part of a visible ethnic minority such as Mexican-American or Black, having a background of poverty or coming from a broken home,” she told The New York Times in 1979. That’s right — a decade after her arrival in Madison, her work was already making national news.\n\n.... Each set of information above are excerpts from others published writings.\n\nI personally remember Marlene Cummings from witnessing her sharing information. Specifically, her teachings about melanin gave me information as a young child that I passed on to my children and grandchildren. I have remembered Marlene Cummings my entire life for the information that she courageously voiced. It is important that she be honored. Please be courageous and place her name on this school so that she is researched for who she was to this world and so that her words and teachings are researched, reread and are spoken again in our community. Marlene Cummings words are as relevant now as they were when she first stood up and addressed our community. Some of us learned from her early in our lives, some of us still have much to learn.\n\nThank you for your consideration to honor Marlene Cummings by calling one of MMSD's schools by her name.\n\nProposal # 143\n\nQ. What individuals/groups are proposing the name?\n\nFrances Steele\n\nQ. What is the proposed name?\n\nMarlene A. Cummings Elementary School\n\nQ. Which category does the proposed name fall under?\n\nProminent national or local figure who is deceased\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, describe why this person is considered prominent. “Prominent” is defined as “widely and popularly known.”\n\nFrom Madison Magazine: \"Marlene Cummings skated into Madison from Indiana in 1968 with her husband, Nelson (the first director of the Urban League of Greater Madison), and their four sons. Cummings was a registered nurse with training in psychiatric and public health and she started volunteering in public school classrooms, using puppets and games to talk with kids about “differences” and prejudice. “That includes physical handicaps, mental handicaps, obesity, being part of a visible ethnic minority such as Mexican-American or Black, having a background of poverty or coming from a broken home,” she told The New York Times in 1979. That’s right — a decade after her arrival in Madison, her work was already making national news.\n\nThe kids loved her. Madison Metropolitan School District hired her to its human relations staff, and the curriculum she developed was ultimately adopted in 27 states. She created and hosted three television programs, including a live weekly show called “Very Important People” that ran on WISC-TV. Throughout the 1970s, she wrote a Wisconsin State Journal column called “Dear Mrs. Cummings” in which kids and their parents could ask tough questions; some endearing, most well-meaning and several that are too offensive to repeat here. One has to assume — hope — that Cummings gave only as much as she anted to. It’s hard to imagine a similar scenario today. According to a 2018 Madison365 article by Mackenzie Krumme — published two years before Cummings’ death at 84 and well worth seeking out today — Cummings’ 10-year career as an educator and columnist came to an end in 1979, when Gov. Lee Dreyfus tapped her to run an initiative on women’s issues. She went on to serve as Gov. Tommy Thompson’s regulation and licensing secretary for 14 years.\"\n\nQ.

We need this type of learning now more than ever.\n\nProposal # 144\n\nQ. What individuals/groups are proposing the name?\n\nTitle VI Native Parent Committee\n\nQ. What is the proposed name?\n\nAda Elizabeth Deer\n\nQ. Which category does the proposed name fall under?\n\nProminent national or local figure who is deceased\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, describe why this person is considered prominent. “Prominent” is defined as “widely and popularly known.”\n\nAda Deer was born in Keshena as a member of the Menominee Tribe. Her mother was a strong advocate for Native American rights, and Deer followed in her footsteps. She was the first Menominee to earn an undergraduate degree at the University of Wisconsin (UW). In 1961, she was the first Native American to receive an M.S.W. from the Columbia University School of Social Work. Her work on behalf of the Menominee led to the Menominee Restoration Act of 1972, which officially returned the Menominee Reservation to federally recognized status. Because of this accomplishment, Deer became the first woman to chair the Menominee Tribe in Wisconsin.\n\nHer political activism included running for Wisconsin secretary of state in 1978 and again in 1982. In 1992, she became the first Native American woman in Wisconsin to run for U.S. Congress. In 1993, Deer was appointed assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, as head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs; she was the first Native American woman to hold that position. While in office, she helped set federal policy for more than 550 federally recognized tribes.\n\nAda Deer passed away on August 15, 2023.\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, what is the significance of the person specifically to the Madison Metropolitan School District that it should choose to name a school for this particular person over others of similar prominence?\n\nWhile living in Madison, as an educator and social worker, she taught classes at the UW-Madison School of Social Work and, in 2000, she became director of the American Indian Studies Program.\n\nIn 2018, Deer became the first person to participate in the Culture Keepers/Elders-in-Residence Program at UW-Madison, which seeks to improve the experiences of Native students across campus by building relationships with an older and honored Native leader. Deer also served as chairperson of the Native American Rights Fund and was active in many other community activities.\n\nBecause of her groundbreaking accomplishments, Ada Deer received many awards, and in 2019 she was inducted into the Native American Hall of Fame. In 2023, Governor Tony Evers proclaimed August 7 to be Ada Deer Day in Wisconsin.\n\nProposal # 175\n\nQ. What individuals/groups are proposing the name?\n\nJanessa Boone\n\nQ. What is the proposed name?\n\nLori Mann Carey Elementary\n\nQ. Which category does the proposed name fall under?\n\nProminent national or local figure who is deceased\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, describe why this person is considered prominent. “Prominent” is defined as “widely and popularly known.”\n\nIf you didnt know Ms. Carey personally, you knew of her. She was the one at the football and basketball games with the megaphone and cowbells. She was the one always in the schools fighting for the kids who were falling in the cracks. She was the definition of prominent and her legacy is still seen to this day not only through her kids, but also through others she touched while she was on this earth. Normally when so many people know someone, you'll find someone who has something negative to say at some point. I've never heard that about this woman. She was love and showed it to everyone she came across. She was so motivating in whatever you were doing, whether big or small she believed in you.\n\nQ. If the proposed name is a prominent local or national figure who is deceased, what is the significance of the person specifically to the Madison Metropolitan School District that it should choose to name a school for this particular person over others of similar prominence?\n\nIf you're from the Southside of Madison, you knew Lori Carey. And she knew you. Her smile was contagious. She lit up a room with her presence, let alone her voice. She was the #1 fan at every game. Ms. Lori was the kind of person you heard and felt. Her hugs were always full of acceptance and comfort I believe naming a school after her would be the best choice because her roots were planted on the Southside. She raided 5 kids on the Southside of Madison, walking distance from the school. The current location used to be the NIP building. I spent so much time at that building playing basketball with her daughter, Alysia. Her husband, Vince, used to drive the van for the Madison Spartans for years. She was so instrumental in my life, I often find myself channeling her calm spirit now with my kids. I believe naming this school after her would be full circle as her daughter, Ciera currently teaches at OneCity in Madison."
