        "text": "On September 9 Otis Redding would have turned 81. On the weekend of 8 and 9 September, the City of Macon, Georgia will celebrate the legacy of the legendary soul singer.\n\nRedding was 26 years old when he died in a plane crash in Madison, Wisconsin. Just three days before his death Otis finished his recording of what would become his signature tune ‘(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay’.\n\nThe 8 and 9 September Otis Redding events are designed to raise funds for the future Otis Redding Center for the Arts. 9 September will start with a groundbreaking event for the Center.\n\n“Our family is elated to celebrate my dad’s legacy in person for the first time since the pandemic. We are happy to bring the weekend-long celebration back to Macon and thank the countless patrons who have supported the Otis Redding Foundation since my mother established it in 2007.
