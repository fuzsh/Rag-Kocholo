Despite foggy and rainy conditions, they took off for Madison, Wisconsin, where they were scheduled to perform that night. But tragically, just four miles from the airport, the airplane crashed into Lake Monona, killing everyone on board except one band member. Redding's body was recovered from the lake the next day, still strapped into his seat. Eerily, musician James Brown had reportedly warned Redding not to board the plane, telling him, \"That plane is not big enough to be doing what you're doing. It can't carry all those people and all that equipment. You shouldn't be messing around with it like that.\"⁠\n⁠\nGo inside the devastating story of Otis Redding's death by clicking the link in our profile.⁠\n⁠\n⁠\n#wisconsin #otisredding #planecrash #1967 #tragic\".",
