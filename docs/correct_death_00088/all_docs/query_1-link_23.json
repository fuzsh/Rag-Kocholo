        "text": "Music\n\nWalking down Madison, Wisconsin’s State street, flyers for upcoming shows are everywhere.\n\nThey paper over ones that have recently happened, and those too paper over older ones. It’s part of the fabric of downtown — almost a civic wallpaper. Countless bands have advertised this way, and up until not too long ago, this was how most fans found out about upcoming concerts. Otis Redding’s December 1967 show at The Factory was no exception, and posters for his concert were likely papered up and down the street too.\n\nOnly this show never happened.\n\nIt’s been 55 years now.\n\nFive and half decades since Otis Redding, along with seven others, boarded a plane in Cleveland bound for Madison, Wisconsin. A common pairing, and one that is straightforward from an aviating perspective.\n\nMost of us know how this particular story ends. Redding, with his backing band, the Bar-Kays, were on their way to a gig in Madison. Another stop in the Midwest.\n\nA quick hop between rust belt cities. Again pretty straightforward."
