        "text": "Madison's Ken Adamany was in his early 20s when he operated the Factory, a Madison live music club that is now Avol's Bookstore (and formerly Canterbury Books) located on Gorham Street just off State Street.\n\nDespite his young age, he was already an experienced concert promoter. He continues promoting concerts today and helped guide Cheap Trick to international success.\n\nBringing Otis Redding to Madison in 1967 was a coup. \"I was so honored,\" Adamany told the Wisconsin State Journal in a 1997 interview.\n\nAdamany recalled the Dec. 10, 1967 day that Redding and six others died when Redding's plane crashed into Lake Monona on its approach to Madison. Only one person — trumpet player Ben Cauley — survived, and he'll be part of a Redding tribute marking the 40th anniversary of the crash Monday at Monona Terrace.\n\nAdamany said it was very unusual for a club act to fly to a gig.\n\n\"And we were told they were busing in from Cleveland,\" Adamany said. \"That's why when I got the first phone call, I didn't believe it.\n\n\"One of the detectives called me and asked, Are you expecting an orchestra flying in?' I didn't know what he was talking about for two reasons: One, it wasn't an orchestra; and two, they were coming in by bus.\n\n\"They were late, but it was a very, very overcast day, and I figured they were having trouble finding the building.\"\n\nBy early evening, a police officer called Adamany and described some of the victims. That's when Adamany knew it was Redding and his band.\n\nA long line already formed outside the Factory. The first of two shows was scheduled for 6:30 p.m.\n\nNone of the fans knew the tragic news. Adamany had an employee use a bullhorn to tell concertgoers from an open window.\n\n\"No one believed it, of course,\" Adamany said. \"It was in the era of students not trusting business people. \"\n\nRadio reports, however, confirmed the news. Police asked Adamany to have a show. He presented a free concert.\n\nIn a 2003 interview with the Wisconsin State Journal, Cheap Trick guitarist Rick Nielsen said he was a member of one of the acts that performed. \"The news spread slowly,\" Nielsen said. \"People were walking around in a daze. Instead of locked doors, we played. \"\n\nIn a twisted development one week later, some concertgoers started copying tickets and using fake ones for the $3 ticket refund.\n\n\"We refunded way more than we sold,\" Adamany said,\"and we sold about 700 or 800 tickets. \"\n\nAdamany recalled how booking acts was still in its infancy in 1967. He continued to book acts at the Factory. In 1968, Jimi Hendrix played there.\n\n\"Booking was not as organized as it is now,\" he said. \"We hardly ever heard from road managers. I remember waiting for Wilson Pickett until about five minutes before he hit the stage. No one knew anything about where he was.\n\n\"Now, you're in touch with an act five times a day. If you bring a show into Madison, we're on the phone constantly with a PR person, the road manager and sometimes the management office and the agent. \"\n\nTo acknowledge Redding's talent, Adamany read a quote from James \"Curly \" Cooke, a former Madison resident who played in the Steve Miller Band. Cooke saw Redding perform at the Monterey Pop Festival.\n\n\"I was at the right of the stage for Otis Redding,\" Cooke said. \"It was phenomenal. I have never to this day seen anybody with so much power and raw energy. I've never seen anybody like that. It was one of the absolute highlights of my life. \"\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
