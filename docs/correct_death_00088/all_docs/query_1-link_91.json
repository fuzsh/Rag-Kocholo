        "text": "Otis Ray Redding Jr. † (September 9, 1941 - c. December 10, 1967 [aged 26]), better known online as Otis Redding, was an American singer and songwriter. Nicknamed the \"King of Soul\", he is regarded as one of the greatest singer-songwriters in the history of American popular music and a seminal artist in soul music and rhythm and blues.\n\nHistory[]\n\nRedding was born in Dawson, Georgia. He was the first son of Otis Redding Sr. and Fannie Roseman. When Redding was three, the family moved to Tindall Heights, a predominantly African-American public housing project in Macon. [1] At an early age, he sang in the Vineville Baptist Church choir and learned guitar and piano. From age 10, Redding took drum and singing lessons. At Ballard-Hudson High School, he sang in the school band. Every Sunday he earned $6 by performing gospel songs for Macon radio station WIBB, and he won the $5 prize in a teen talent show for 15 consecutive weeks. [2][3] His passion was singing, and he often cited Little Richard and Sam Cooke as influences. [4]\n\nAt age 15, Redding left school to help financially support his family. His father had contracted tuberculosis and was often hospitalized, leaving his mother as the family's primary income earner. He worked as a well digger, as a gasoline station attendant, and occasionally as a musician. Pianist Gladys Williams often performed at the Hillview Springs Social Club, and Redding sometimes played piano with her band there. [5]\n\nRedding's breakthrough came in 1958 on disc jockey Hamp Swain's \"The Teenage Party\", a talent contest at the local Roxy and Douglass Theatres. [6] Johnny Jenkins was in the audience he tried to find Redding's backing band lacking in musical skills, offered to accompany him. Redding sang Little Richard's \"Heebie Jeebies\". The combination enabled Redding to win Swain's talent contest for fifteen consecutive weeks, the cash prize was $5. [7] Redding was then hired by the Upsetters when Little Richard abandoned rock and roll in favor of gospel music. Redding was well paid, making about $25 per gig, but did not stay long. [8]\n\nIn mid-1960, Otis moved to Los Angeles with his sister, Deborah, while his wife, Zelma, and their children stayed in Macon, Georgia. [9] In Los Angeles, Redding recorded his first songs, including \"Tuff Enuff\" written by James McEachin. [10]\n\nDeath[]\n\nOn December 10, 1967, Redding and four members of the Bar-Keys, which included, Jimmie King, Ronnie Caldwell, Phalon Jones, and Carl Cunningham and their partner, Matthew Kelly, died when their airplane crashed into Lake Monona, near Madison, Wisconsin, while attempting to land at Truax Field. Redding and the band were scheduled to play their next concerts in Madison. [11] Trumpeter Ben Cauley was the only survivor of the crash. [12]\n\nRedding's body was recovered the next day when the lake was searched. [13]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nAfter Redding's death, the Académie du Jazz in France named an award after him. The Prix Otis Redding is given to the best record release in the field of R&B. Redding was the first recipient of the award for The Otis Redding Story on Stax, following winners of the award include Aretha Franklin, Ike & Tina Turner, and Curtis Mayfield. [14] In 1968, the National Association of Television and Radio Announcers created the Otis Redding Award in his honor. [15]\n\nIn 2002, the city of Macon honored its native son by unveiling a memorial statue in the city's Gateway Park. The park is next to the Otis Redding Memorial Bridge, which crosses the Ocmulgee River. The Rhythm and Blues Foundation named Redding as the recipient of its 2006 Pioneer Award. [16] A year later he was inducted into the Hollywood's Rockwalk in California.
