        "text": "Ben Cauley (October 3, 1947 – September 21, 2015) was an American trumpet player, vocalist, songwriter, and founding member of the Stax recording group, The Bar-Kays. He was the sole survivor of the 1967 plane crash that claimed the lives of soul singer Otis Redding and four members of the Bar-Kays.\n\nCauley was born in South Memphis, Tennessee. He learned to play trumpet when at school, and formed a band with guitarist Jimmy King, saxophonist Phalon Jones, drummer Carl Cunningham, keyboardist Ronnie Caldwell, and bassist James Alexander. The group was originally named the Imperials, and later changed to the Bar-Kays in the mid-1960s. Cauley started attending LeMoyne College in 1965, before becoming a professional musician.\n\nThe Bar-Kays joined the Stax studio by 1966, and were signed on to Stax’s subsidiary Volt Records in the beginning of 1967. According to James Alexander, Cauley was the best dressed of the group, always known to wear a suit, no matter the occasion.\n\nAl Jackson, Jr. the drummer with Booker T & the MGs, took a particular interest in the young members of the Bar-Kays and groomed them to become the second house band for Stax after Booker T and the MGs. As such they appeared as the backing band on numerous recordings for Stax artists such as Otis Redding, Carla Thomas, and Sam and Dave. In fact, Otis Redding took such a liking to the band that he chose them to be his touring back-up band in the summer of 1967.\n\nOn December 8, 1967, Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays flew in Redding’s twin engine Beechcraft plane to Nashville, Tennessee for three weekend gigs and used that city as a base to commute to additional gigs. The following day, December 9, they took the Beechcraft to Cleveland where they appeared on Don Webster’s ‘Upbeat’ TV show with Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels. Later that same evening they played at a popular Cleveland club, Leo’s Casino. It was on December 10, on their commute to Madison, Wisconsin, that the men would meet their fate.\n\nAt 3:28 in the afternoon, the plane carrying Otis Redding, his valet, and the majority of the Bar-Kays crashed into the icy waters of the Squaw Bay area of Lake Monona, just outside of Madison. Bar-Kays bassist James Alexander had taken a different flight as there was not enough room left on Redding’s plane. Cauley, who was sitting directly behind Otis Redding in the co-pilot’s seat, had fallen asleep on the flight clutching his seat cushion. He awoke when he realized he could not breathe. He said that he then saw band mate Phalon Jones look out of a window and say “Oh, no!”\n\nCauley then unbuckled his safety belt which ultimately allowed him to separate himself from the wreckage. Other victims, including Redding, were found still attached to their seats. As the impact tore a wing off the small Beechcraft, the fuselage was torn open and Cauley was able to bob to the surface as he clutched his seat cushion.\n\nWhile bobbing and trying to swim to his band mates who weren’t able to free themselves from the fuselage, Cauley witnessed their cries for help before they were pulled under the frigid water. A nearby resident of Lake Monona heard the crash and called the authorities who responded quickly with a police boat. Approximately 20 minutes after the crash, Cauley was pulled into the police boat, suffering from hypothermia and shock. According to Jet magazine, which interviewed Cauley and the authorities who assisted in the rescue attempt, the rescue divers could not be in the water for more than 15 minutes at a time due to the freezing temperature of the water. Madison Police Inspector John Harrington was quoted as saying that a person without insulated SCUBA gear “wouldn’t live longer than 20 or so minutes” in the icy water. When asked why he survived, Cauley told Jet, “I guess God was with me.” Cauley claimed to suffer from nightmares about the accident until his death.\n\nAfter the crash\n\nBen Cauley and James Alexander reformed the Bar-Kays and went on to record with Stax artists such as Isaac Hayes, Rufus Thomas, and The Staple Singers, as well as appear at Wattstax, “The Black Woodstock”. However, the band made little money, as they did not have much work outside of being a house band for Stax, and frequently needed to tour with the artists they backed. Cauley had two young daughters to support, so he left the group in 1971, allowing him to continue performing on his own while being able to remain home with his family.\n\nCauley suffered a debilitating stroke in 1989, but eventually recovered fully, aside from occasional problems with slightly slurred speech.\n\nInto the 2000s, Cauley could be heard backing up Liz Lottmann, jazz and blues singer, or performing live at the Memphis club, Rum Boogie, located downtown on Beale Street. He also directed the choir of Calvary Longview United Methodist Church, attended by him and his wife Shirley.\n\nOn September 9, 2008, Attorney B.J. Wade donated $100,000 to Stax Records that would be used to create the Ben Cauley scholarship, in his honor and to shed light on his accomplishments. On September 12, 2008, the scholarship was founded. On June 6, 2015 Cauley was on hand to be inducted into the Official Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in Clarksdale, MS. Along with other Bar-Kays.\n\nHe died on September 21, 2015 at the age of 67.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Cauley\n\n[Editor’s note: The Bar-Kays were WAY ahead of their time. The music they produced was so “modern” in its sound – more like that of the 21st Century than of the 20th. That’s probably why their songs did not catch on. Someone needs to start playing them NOW as the listening public would clammer for more!]\n\n* * * * *\n\nFRANKIE FORD, KNOWN FOR HIS 1959 HIT ‘SEA CRUISE’, DIES\n\nFrankie Ford (August 4, 1939 – September 28, 2015) was an American rock and roll and rhythm and blues singer, best known for his 1959 hit “Sea Cruise”.\n\nHe was born in Gretna, Louisiana, across the Mississippi River from New Orleans, and was the adopted son of Vincent and Anna Guzzo, who named him Vincent Francis Guzzo, Jr. He learned to sing and dance at an early age, and when at high school joined a group, the Syncopators, as singer and pianist. He was spotted by manager Joe Caronna, who took him to Johnny Vincent of Ace Records. Taking the stage name Frankie Ford, he made his first recordings for Ace in 1958. He toured locally in Louisiana, before recording a vocal overdub on the song “Sea Cruise”, a song written and originally recorded by Huey “Piano” Smith with his group, the Clowns, and featuring overdubbed bells and ships’ horns.. As Smith already had a record in the charts, and was away touring, the record label decided to release Ford’s version, and it rose to #14 on the US pop chart and #11 on the R&B chart, selling over one million copies, and gaining gold disc status.\n\nFord toured widely around the US, but his later records were less successful, with his versions of “Alimony” and “Time After Time” only reaching the lower reaches of the national charts. He also recorded a novelty record in praise of a local TV presenter, “Morgus the Magnificent”, with musicians including Mac Rebennack and Jerry Byrne, but it failed to sell. Ace released an LP by Ford, Let’s Take A Sea Cruise With Frankie Ford, before the singer moved to Imperial Records in late 1960. He recorded with producer Dave Bartholomew, and released a version of “You Talk Too Much”, but Ford’s recording missed out in competition with one by Joe Jones which was issued almost simultaneously. In 1961, his version of Boyd Bennett’s 1955 hit “Seventeen” was Ford’s last chart entry.\n\nFord was drafted in 1962, and performed for troops in Japan, Vietnam and Korea. He later recorded occasionally for small labels, but mainly performed in clubs in and around New Orleans. He appeared in the 1978 movie American Hot Wax, and toured in Britain and Europe, recording the album New Orleans Dynamo in London in 1984. He continued to record and perform through the 1990s. On May 16, 2010, at the Louisiana Music Homecoming in Erwinville, Ford was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.\n\nFord died in Gretna at the age of 76 on September 28, 2015, following a long illness.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Ford\n\n* * * * *\n\nOther Notable Musicians’ Deaths…\n\nSeptember 2015\n\n29: Phil Woods, 83, American saxophonist (“Just the Way You Are”), emphysema.\n\n28: Michael Burgess, 70, Canadian tenor, cancer; Alexander Faris, 94, Irish composer; Frankie Ford, 76, American singer (“Sea Cruise”).\n\n27: Wilton Felder, 75, American saxophonist (The Crusaders) and session bassist (Motown); Denise Lor, 86, American singer (“If I Give My Heart to You”) and actress.\n\n25: Christopher Jackson, 67, Canadian musician, lung cancer; Manuel Oltra, 93, Spanish composer, pneumonia.\n\n22: Jamie Prefontaine, 30, Canadian musician (Winnipeg’s Most).\n\n21: Ben Cauley, 67, American trumpet player and singer (The Bar-Kays); Victor Démé, 53, Burkinabé singer-songwriter; Ray Warleigh, 76, Australian-born British saxophonist and flautist, cancer.\n\n20: Franz Surges, 57, German composer and musician; Radhika Thilak, 45, Indian singer, cancer.\n\n18: Daniel Kyre, 21, American singer, musician and internet personality, suicide by hanging.\n\n17: Daniel Keighley, 62, New Zealand music festival promoter (Sweetwaters) and band manager (The Mutton Birds, Coconut Rough, Screaming Meemees), cancer."
