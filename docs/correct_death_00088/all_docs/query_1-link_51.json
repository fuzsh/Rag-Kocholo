        "text": "The 50th anniversary of the death of Otis Redding, soul music’s greatest exponent, falls on 10 December 2017. As a spotty 14-year-old schoolboy, brought up on the parochial delights of British pop, I discovered him through an enlightened schoolmate who played me I Can’t Turn You Loose, which still has the ability to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. Within months of my epiphany, Otis was dead. On the way to a show, his own plane crashed into the fog shrouded Lake Monona just outside Madison, Wisconsin, killing Otis, four members of his backing band The Bar-Kays, his valet, and the pilot. Only horn player Ben Cauley survived. Horrendous pictures are freely available online showing Otis being pulled from the icy waters, still strapped to his aircraft seat.\n\nHis death came at a time when he was destined for great things. In his final year he conquered Europe as an intrinsic part of the fabled Stax/Volt tour, which featured a stellar line-up of acts. He then arguably stole the show at the Monterey Festival, until that point the defining pop music happening of the 60s. When one considers legendary performances at the event, including Jimi Hendrix setting his guitar alight, Pete Townshend smashing his guitar (again) and Janis Joplin’s incendiary set, it was no mean feat. His successful appearance, coupled with the innovative material he had recorded immediately prior to his death, would have enabled him to break out from the rigid confines of black music into mass acceptance of the wider record buying public. That year he was voted top male vocalist in the respected Melody Maker poll, dethroning none other than Elvis Presley, who had dominated proceedings for the previous decade.\n\nTo coincide with the 40th anniversary of his passing, I undertook a journey to some of America’s musical capitals, including Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans and Nashville. Included in that odyssey was a pilgrimage to Redding’s hometown; Macon, Georgia. Not only did I have the great thrill of meeting his widow Zelma (who never remarried) and his daughter Karla at her shop in the city centre, they also granted me an extraordinary privilege, bestowed on a rare few, in allowing me to visit Otis’ family home, The Big ‘O’ Ranch at Round Oak, in the Georgia countryside. There I was met by Otis’ eldest son Dexter, who showed me the grounds and the final resting place of his father – an incredibly moving experience for someone so absorbed in his music.\n\nAt the risk of starting a war of words, in my opinion no one artist defined a particular genre of music more than Otis Redding. For many, when Otis died, so did authentic 60s soul. Stax, his record company – which had, up until that point, enjoyed steady record sales over the previous few years – was devastated. At the same time, due to an amazing blunder in their contract with Atlantic, they discovered they owned hardly any of their own back catalogue, which was in the hands of the New York label. The two events had a catastrophic effect on Stax from which it never fully recovered. Stax began a steady decline in fortunes which seemed to start around the time Otis died – pure coincidence? Company founder Jim Stewart said Otis epitomised Stax and was the cornerstone of the organisation. Apart from sporadic chart success after his death, principally generated by Isaac Hayes, Stax never fully regained its direction and was declared bankrupt by the middle of the 70s.\n\nAccusations of myopia may already be winging their way towards me in my thinking Otis Redding could do no wrong. Nothing is further from the truth; he was never the greatest singer that ever lived – there I’ve said it! Arguably, he was not even the best black singer of his era. Some people even found his distinctive and frenetic vocal delivery too intense, making for somewhat uncomfortable listening. He openly admitted he couldn’t dance to save his life, appearing wooden and uneasy on stage at times, and envied contemporaries like James Brown and Jackie Wilson who were renowned for their stage craft. What Otis Redding had was his own distinctive sound and style, and it worked perfectly for him. Whatever shortcomings he supposedly possessed, you knew from the moment he ran on stage he would give his all; those fortunate enough to witness an Otis Redding performance would testify to him being one of music’s greatest ever live acts.\n\nIf you’re looking for a truly pure singing voice then no one surpasses the likes of a Sam Cooke, Nat King Cole or Marvin Gaye. However, no singer dead or alive, could express deeper emotion or raw excitement, and Otis came to embody the whole essence of soul. One only has to listen to I’ve Been Loving You Too Long, These Arms Of Mine or his peerless rendition of the 30s standard Try A Little Tenderness to illustrate the point, as every ounce of emotion is squeezed out of the songs; Stax founder Jim Stewart called Try A Little Tenderness the best record the label ever produced.\n\nOtis’ background followed the template of many African-American singers and entertainers. Born in Dawson, Georgia, on 9 September 1941, one of six children, Otis Ray Redding Jr and his family moved to Macon when he was two years old. Macon, a bustling city with plenty of job opportunities, was South Georgia’s magnet for poor rural families, black and white, looking for a better life. His father, once a sharecropper (smallholding farmer), became a lay preacher in the local church and Otis sang in the choir from an early age. Naturally he was influenced by gospel, but also by country artists like Hank Williams. Conforming to the social and racial mores of the time, black music was marginalised on the radio, so country and western was the prevalent music available in rural areas with little or no alternative.\n\nOtis lived in a relatively rough neighbourhood in a strictly segregated city. He was a member of a local gang and soon found less wholesome distractions that came to the attention of the police on several occasions. These were minor law violations compared to an event in July 1964 when he became involved in a shootout and reputedly shot a rival gang member in the leg. After paying hush money to the injured party and supposedly a bung to the police, he managed to retain his liberty.\n\nMixing in dubious company, he distanced himself from the influence of the church and his parental home, much to his father’s disgust, who despaired at his son’s growing enthusiasm for the “Devil’s music.” He had never embraced education, hated school and quit in the 10th grade. Learning rudimentary piano, guitar and drums at an early age, he developed an inherent belief in his ability to make a living as a singer, inspired by the success of a fellow Macon resident – Little Richard, who was idolised by many wannabe singers in the area. They couldn’t fail to be impressed by Richard driving around in a brand new Cadillac wearing flamboyant clothes. Redding later said he “entered the music business because of Richard – he’s my inspiration”.\n\nAdopting a vocal delivery more than loosely based on Little Richard’s style, Redding joined several local groups in the mid-50s. He also featured at local talent contests imitating his hero, where he was so successful, winning the $5 top prize 15 weeks in a row, that he was eventually barred from competing. Combining his fledgling musical career with a string of menial jobs, including digging wells and labouring, he grew more in demand as time progressed, as promoters became anxious to fill the gap caused by Little Richard’s sudden abandonment of secular music for gospel. His ability to mimic Richard resulted in concert dates as vocalist fronting Richard’s original backing band The Upsetters on the legendary but ultimately soul-destroying chitlin circuit of the deep South. Redding’s near obsession with Little Richard showed no sign of abating and continued up to the time when he made his first foray into a recording studio.\n\nOtis left Macon in early 1960, leaving his pregnant girlfriend (future wife Zelma) behind to try his luck in Los Angeles where his sister lived. Finding a job in a car wash he soon immersed himself into the local scene and joined a band which gave him the opportunity to make records. Entering a studio for the first time in his life, he recorded four self-penned sides, She’s All Right, Getting Hip, Tuff Enuff and Gamma Lama (re-recorded two years later as Shout Bamalama). Still failing to forge an identity of his own, these early recordings still sound like a parody of Little Richard, a style which, by 1960, was considered hopelessly out of date. Tuff Enuff, backed by She’s All Right, was released on the small LA label Finer Arts. The recordings were unremarkable, and unsurprisingly the 45 flopped. Though slightly bruised by the experience, it only intensified Redding’s desire to sing professionally.\n\nReturning to Macon, Redding quickly re-immersed himself with local musicians and joined an outfit called Johnny Jenkins & The Pinetoppers as lead singer and driver. The band was particularly popular with local students and were much in demand at frat dances. It also backed visiting musicians like Nappy Brown, Arthur Alexander and Jimmy Reed. Jenkins, recognising Otis’ potential, encouraged him to shake off his dependency on impersonating Little Richard by performing a varied repertoire, including covering the pop and country hits of the day. It was at this time he came into contact with Phil Walden, a college student and promoter who booked bands for dances. Walden was one of the first wave of white kids to “cross the line” and regularly listen to race records from artists like Amos Milburn, Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf. Growing up in a segregated town during an era of increasing racial tension, it was remarkable that the middle-class Walden would become Redding’s manager in the prevailing climate. However he was to retain that status and his friendship until his death. Walden also went on to manage Sam & Dave, Percy Sledge and Al Green, going on to form Capricorn Records in 1969, launching the career of The Allman Brothers Band.\n\nWalden initially thought Johnny Jenkins rather than Redding was the more likely to succeed. Jenkins was a well-known Macon musician and an extrovert, highly competent guitarist. He’d enjoyed some regional success with several instrumentals and attracted the attention of New York’s Atlantic which, with Walden’s involvement, referred him to a small Memphis record label called Stax as part of an existing licensing agreement between both labels. Up to that point, Stax, which would eventually rival Motown in influence if not popularity, had enjoyed its biggest hits with two instrumentals, Last Night by The Mar-Keys and Green Onions by Booker T & The MGs. After those successes Stax had stalled somewhat, and were hopeful Jenkins could provide a further hit.\n\nA three-hour recording date was booked but things didn’t go to plan. Jenkins failed to impress Jim Stewart and the session was curtailed before the end of the allotted time. Otis, who had simply driven Jenkins and the band to the session, saw a golden opportunity to utilise the unused but paid- for studio time. He harassed Stewart to record, in the available time left, a song he had written. Wanting to go home, Stewart nevertheless reluctantly agreed and was astonished by what he heard. The song These Arms Of Mine was a tender soulful ballad released on Volt, a Stax subsidiary. Creeping into the lower reaches of the US Hot 100 in early ’63, it tentatively signalled to Jim Stewart that he had an artist in the making. Stewart’s faith in Otis Redding was rewarded over the next four years by a succession of classic soul recordings.\n\nIn the period between 1963-66, in spite of an initial period of treading water when hit records were hard to come by, Otis’ reputation grew thanks to songs that endure to this day. Pain In My Heart, Me Pitiful, Respect, Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song) and I Can’t Turn You Loose, among others, form an amazing catalogue. Though reasonably successful in the US R&B Charts, they did not set the pop charts alight. Otis was becoming more aware of his inability to cross over to the white audience, making it a priority to rectify the situation as soon as possible. During that period his LPs followed a similar pattern, scoring well on the R&B charts but making little impression elsewhere, and in some respects deservedly so.\n\nThe early albums contained an unhealthy percentage of cover versions, particularly from the likes of Sam Cooke and The Temptations, and arguably not one could be compared to the original; in fact some covers were lacklustre to say the least. Interestingly Keith Richards’ original vision for (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction included a horn riff, one that Redding employed instead of the guitar lick, but he was outvoted by his band members. Certain album tracks with Redding’s name in the writing credits became the subject of dispute over ownership or plagiarism and clouded his reputation while he was alive. Otis was not above pilfering songs like Ruler Of My Heart by Irma Thomas, blatantly reinterpreting it as Pain In My Heart. A Macon band was already performing a version of Respect, albeit as a ballad, when Otis got hold of the song. He rewrote some of the lyrics, speeded the song up and achieved worldwide acclaim. The band member behind the the song received no credit and no royalties. In spite of the accusations levelled at Redding he had the ability to make those songs his own.\n\nOtis was earning a good living as a live performer, so the albums tended to be rushed affairs recorded between gaps in his frenetic touring schedule. The quality of his early albums is patchy to say the least but overall the good tracks fortunately outweigh the indifferent. Interest in original copies of his albums haa enjoyed a renaissance recently and they are again becoming much sought-after, particularly his best-known. Otis Blue: Otis Redding Sings Soul, to give it its full title, is a regular in lists of the best albums of all time. Though again including too many cover versions, it was critically acclaimed and became his most successful album. It also contained three singles which entered the US pop charts, bringing him slightly closer to the white audience. It topped the Billboard R&B chart and went to No 6 in the UK chart, where it qualified for a Silver Disc.\n\nIn the UK Otis was seen as the primary force in turning soul, hitherto an underground phenomenon, mainstream. Until his first UK hit in 1965, the music had been the preserve of the in-crowd – mods and other visionaries jealously guarding “their” music, which was only played on revolutionary pirate ships and by knowledgeable DJs of labyrinthine clubs in a select few cities. In 1966 he toured the UK for the first time and in a remarkable example of taste by a TV company, was given a complete edition of the flagship pop show Ready Steady Go to show what he was capable of. Shown on primetime national television on 16 September, capably supported by devotees Eric Burdon (post- Animals) and Chris Farlowe, Redding demonstrated what an exciting live performer he was. The show deeply impressed UK soul fans, boosting his growing popularity and was a contributory factor in helping pave the way for the Stax/Volt tour the following summer. This tour, for those privileged enough to witness it, has booked its place in the annals of pop history. Combustible performances from Otis, Sam & Dave and Arthur Conley, supported by Eddie Floyd, Carla Thomas and Booker T & The MGs, played to packed houses countrywide. The tone of the tour was a complete contrast to the lukewarm reception afforded the Tamla Motown Revue two years previously.\n\nIn the same year, an event perhaps of even greater magnitude happened. Otis was no stranger to white teenage audiences. He had played legendary West Coast venues like LA’s Whisky-A-Go-Go and the Fillmore in an attempt to broaden his appeal, and was warmly received on every occasion by the longhairs of California. Black musicians were a rare sighting on Sunset Strip but Otis was determined to help break down barriers between black artists and white audiences. The brilliant live album recorded at the Whisky in April ’66 showed Otis in superb form. His performances were watched by Janis Joplin, reputedly first in the queue, and Bob Dylan, who was in attendance for all three nights. Legend has it that backstage Dylan offered Otis an acetate of Just Like A Woman and suggested he record it. Redding turned to his manager and said: “There’s too many fucking words.” Robertson has since claimed Redding was keen, and indeed tried to record it; he just had trouble singing the bridge. Concert promoter Bill Graham, so instrumental in the elevation of 60s popular music, regarded the concerts as the best he’d ever organised. However it wasn’t until June 1967 that Otis was finally accepted by both the white and black audience.\n\nMonterey Pop Festival represented the changing face of music and is considered the moment “when pop became rock”. The roster of artists on the bill represented music’s new world order. Otis thought it was a huge gamble playing to the white hippie generation but a risk worth taking. With artists like Jimi Hendrix, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Country Joe & The Fish appearing, he knew he’d be the antithesis of the rest of the bill. Confronted by a sea of bodies in kaftans and beads, Otis in a green silk suit backed by the MGs in similar lime-green outfits, gave arguably his finest concert performance. Appearing last on the Saturday night bill, he immediately had the tired crowd utterly spellbound. The laid-back informality of the folk/rock scene was blown away, with Otis tearing into uptempo stompers or emotionally delivering heartrending ballads; he eventually left the stage to a tremendous 10-minute ovation. Bob Weir of The Grateful Dead said, “It was like seeing God on stage.” Apparently Otis regarded Monterey as the pinnacle of his career thus far and was convinced his time had finally arrived.\n\nFor some time prior to Monterey, Otis was becoming more conscious of the way music was progressing. He knew his “sock it to me” style of delivery was looking dated and generally perceived as a throwback to the days of 50s R&B. To survive, he knew he needed to change or fade from view like many of his contemporaries.\n\nHe began listening to artists outside of black music, in particular Bob Dylan and The Beatles, whose Sgt Pepper was never far from an Otis-manned turntable. He had already recorded two Beatles’ songs plus the Stones’ Satisfaction, and was increasingly open to other influences. Otis had always placed more emphasis on the “groove” of a record and his long-held belief was that lyrics were of secondary importance. But becoming more open-minded and listening to other forms of music, his philosophy about songwriting changed, which manifested itself in his writing over the coming months.\n\nShortly after Monterey, Otis underwent throat surgery when nodules were discovered on his vocal chords. Frustrated that he was not allowed to talk, let alone sing, he used his time productively to compose a batch of songs which were to represent his last work. In a marked change of direction, his new songs had a softer, more melodic sound, often containing a deeper message or comment about life, epitomised by his biggest-selling record of all, (Sittin’ On) The Dock Of The Bay. Interestingly, in a similar scenario to Motown’s reaction to Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On, no one at Stax was overly enamoured with Dock Of The Bay and Jim Stewart was initially very reluctant to release it, fearing Otis was about to alienate his core fans. Other songs like Hard To Handle were so obviously aimed at the white rock audience, it wasn’t difficult to ascertain which direction he was moving towards.\n\nThe majority of this new material was issued posthumously on The Immortal Otis Redding, a glorious album which only re-emphasises what a huge talent was lost at much too early an age.\n\nFans of all types of music can feel cheated that this young man of 26 years, who had so much to give, should die at the very moment when he promised to deliver something different and potentially better than ever before. But at least we have the records that we do. Still, 50 years after his death, he is sorely missed."
