        "text": "Post by Len Blanks\n\nPost by Dave Allen\n\nHaving lived in Madison, Wisconsin for over twenty years, I thought\n\nI'd heard just about every story there was to hear about the 1967\n\ncrash of Otis' Twin Beech into Lake Monona. I was wrong. I just\n\nlearned a new little factoid today (it may be common knowledge to\n\nsome, but it was new to me).\n\nReproductions of the poster for Redding's December 10, 1967 concert\n\nin Madison are pretty common around here, so I was already aware of\n\nthe name of the opening act. What I didn't know was that the opening\n\nact was an early incarnation of a hit 70's band, one that I've seen\n\nin concert several times.\n\nWhat was the name of the band at the bottom of the bill that fateful\n\nday, and what hit 70s band did they later become?\n\nArt and the Window Washers\n\nLen knows that this isn't the answer, but I'm tempted to give him full\n\ncredit points anyway. Len, your knowledge of obscure Madison related\n\ntrivia is commendable. I wish I still had my old \"Art is a window\n\nwasher\" t-shirt.\n\nArt Nesson, commonly referred to as \"Art the Window Washer,\" was one of\n\nthe many colorful characters who populated State Street in Madison. Art\n\nalways had a bucket, some dirty newspaper, and a squeegee on hand to\n\nperform his trademark occupation. Art's window washing afforded him a\n\nbeverage or couple of bucks here and there from State Street vendors.\n\nBut Art's claim to fame was a t-shirt created by some University of\n\nWisconsin art students.\n\nT-shirt front: \"What is Art?\"\n\nT-shirt back: \"Art is a window washer\"\n\nThese shirts were a familiar sight on the backs of UW students from the\n\n1960s through the 1980s.\n\n--\n\nDave\n\nQuestn Authority\n\nTodd, Wanted to look up information & found this on a site referencing\n\nthe Champaign bar:\n\n\"The Buffum Tool Company played the Champaign bar/small concert circuit,\n\nalong with other obscure parts of the Midwest, ca. 1965 to 1968.\n\nPhilip Ross, Frank Pytko, Rick Thady and Donald McCrea Kennedy, Gerry\n\nSmith.\n\nThe band was originally called The Barbarians. Their first drummer of\n\nnote was named Snake Larsen, and when he left the band they auditioned a\n\nfew drummers, including me (Frank) and this guy named Alan Gratzer. I\n\ngot the job, based mostly on the fact that I had longer hair than Alan\n\ndid. Image was very important in 1965. Alan then hooked up with Neal\n\nDoughty, formed REO Speedwagon, and the rest is history. Buffum Tool Co.\n\nheaded west to San Francisco during the Summer of Love and did a\n\nthree-week stint at The Matrix while camping out in the Steve Miller\n\nBand's attic. Fame eluded us. On returning to the Midwest, Phil Ross\n\nleft the band to pursue a career in graphic arts and was replaced by\n\nsinger Brian Cook and bassist Larry Minton, formerly of Somebody Groovy\n\n(with guitarist Garret Oostdyck, post-Finchley Boys). One of our most\n\nmemorable gigs was substituting for Otis Redding at Ken Adamany's club\n\nin Madison, WI. Otis had just crashed into Lake Michigan, and the crowd\n\nshowed up expecting Otis, and instead got six white guys playing folk\n\nrock. Imagine their surprise. We survived that one and went on to sub at\n\nthe same club for Moby Grape when they didn't show up for some reason.\n\nSorry, no refunds.\""
