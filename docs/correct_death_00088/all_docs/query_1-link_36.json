        "text": "Well, let's see here...\n\nWe got three DVD's featuring the man, not the least being Dreams To Remember: The Legacy Of Otis Redding, with almost an hour and a half of Otis performances, and on top of that Otis' scorching finale to the Stax/Volt Live In Norway, 1967 DVD, where Otis shows how he may have been the only performer who could follow Sam & Dave! Then there was the PBS airing of Respect Yourself: The Stax Records Story, and it's DVD release along with the other two sets, with plenty more Otis footage, and some real perspective on how important he was to the label, and the effects his passing had on the entire Stax Records enterprise. There indeed was a commemorative concert, ceremony and theatrical screening of Dreams To Remember in Otis' home town of Macon, GA a few months ago to mark the 40th anniversary of Otis' passing.\n\nOn top of all that, Otis has been \"got-ta, got-ta, got-ta-ing\" though my speakers almost constantly for the last six months or so, as a result of all of the above. There's been plenty of Otis out there this year to remember him by.\n\nPerhaps Wisconsin doesn't want to be remembered as the place where it all ended. Just seeing the mangled pieces of the plane with Otis' name on them in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame was one of the saddest feelings I've ever had.\n\nSole Survivor In Famous Crash That Killed Otis Redding Returns To Madison\n\nSoul Singer's Plane Crashed Near Madison 40 Years Ago\n\nUPDATED: 5:10 pm CST December 4, 2007\n\nMADISON, Wis. -- A special ceremony was held on Monday to mark the 40th anniversary of the plane crash that killed legendary soul singer Otis Redding.\n\nOn Dec. 10, 1967, a plane carrying Redding, his five-member band and the pilot crashed into icy Lake Monona on its way to two shows at a Madison nightclub.\n\nThe sole survivor of the plane crash, musician Ben Cauley, said he returned to Madison on Monday for the first time since the tragedy. Cauley was rescued from the water after clinging to the wreckage for about 20 minutes.\n\nCauley, now 60, said he always knew he would one day return and that now is the right time to honor his best friend. The former Bar-Kays trumpet player received a standing ovation when he honored Redding by playing his horn at the ceremony.\n\nRedding was just 26, Cauley, 20, when their plane crashed with five others on board. Cauley said he tried to save Redding, but couldn't.\n\n\"The plane was sinking right,\" recalled Cauley. \"The waves was pushing me back when I was trying to get to him.\"\n\nCauley said that the water was so cold that night that he started to go under. That's when he was saved, he said.\n\n\"I knew it was my time,\" said Cauley. \"So anyway, I gave up and I went down and this man pulled me up.\"\n\nIt was on the rescue boat that Cauley found out he was the only survivor.\n\n\"I said, 'They all right?'\" recalled Cauley. \"And he said, 'No, they're all dead.' As soon as he said that, I couldn't say nothing.\"\n\nBut the deaths didn't mark the end of Redding's music, WISC-TV reported.\n\nAlthough he was only 26 years old when he died, Redding still managed to amass a string of timeless hits, such as \"(Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay,\" \"Respect\" and \"Try a Little Tenderness.\"\n\nOne of Redding's most famous songs, \"Dock Of The Bay\" was recorded only three days before his death. One month later, the song was a No. 1 hit.\n\nA new documentary about Redding's life called \"Dreams To Remember: The Legacy Of Otis Redding\" is now available.\n\nThere was also a traveling exhibit with Redding memorabilia in Madison on Monday.\n\nhttp://www.channel3000.com/news/14765077/detail.html"
