Otis was 59 years old,” the post explained.\n\n“Please keep our family in your prayers at this time and please respect our privacy as we consume this huge loss. Arrangements will be announced at a later date.”\n\nContinuing the legacy of his musician father Otis Redding, who died in a tragic airplane crash in 1967, Redding III succeeded on his own merits and talents.\n\n“The music has to have feeling and emotion…” proclaimed Otis III, according to his official website. “While I’m playing guitar or singing, I don’t proclaim to be a vocalist like my father.”\n\nThe younger Redding and his brother, Dexter, formed the funk band The Reddings and recorded multiple albums throughout the 1980s. Redding III continued to perform globally and was frequently the highlight of award shows, weddings, and more.\n\nHe was also deeply involved in his family’s philanthropic organization, The Otis Redding Foundation, the annual Otis Redding Singer/Songwriter Camp, and served as board president for the local chapter of Meals on Wheels.\n\nVIBE sends our deepest condolences to the Redding family and all those affected by this loss."
