        "text": "On the summer of 2011, PBA Galleries of San Francisco offered at auction one of the finest private collections in existence of the literary and artistic work of the poet Charles Bukowski.\n\nFeaturing a large selection of original typed, signed poems, a rare group of original paintings, and scarce broadsides and ephemera in additional to books, the Runfola Collection of Charles Bukowski presented a vivid picture of the earthy realism of the iconic poet and thinker.\n\nDr. Ross Runfola, Woodrow Wilson Fellow at the University of Buffalo, was introduced to Charles Bukowski when his brother sent him a copy of Love is a Dog from Hell, and discovered a rare kinship with the alcohol-fueled poet and his work. Inspired to write poetry in the Bukowski mode, Runfola was also spurred to collect the creations of the German-American writer. After years of ferreting out rarities, haunting rare book shops, searching the internet, he has assembled a superb gathering, which he is now making available for sale at public auction.\n\nAs noted in the press release of the event “the most remarkable part of the collection is the nearly 175 original typed manuscripts, mostly poems, by Bukowski, many in the signed carbon or photocopy format that he would send to his publisher John Martin.”\n\nThese printed rarities were auctioned with 35 or so original letters from Bukowski to various publishers, his agent and German translator Carl Weissner, assorted girlfriends and others, many offering rare insights into life and relationships.\n\nRemembering Charles Bukowski on his 100th birthday Typeroom shares images of the auction as a reminder of the rough and humane legacy of Bukowski, left behind in his dozens of volumes of prose and poetry. Time Magazine once referred to him as a laureate of American lowlife. We beg to disagree.\n\nLast but not least \"You Never Had It – An Evening with Bukowski\" premiered August 7th in virtual cinemas across the globe presenting the poet in all his uninhibited glory.\n\nThe documentary, an official selection of the Venice Film Festival features archival footage of Italian producer and journalist Silvia Bizio interviewing Bukowski at his home during an evening in January 1981.\n\nThe footage, shot on U-matic videotapes and long thought lost, was rediscovered by Bizio in her garage more than 20 years after Bukowski’s death in 1994.\n\nIn addition to the archival film, You Never Had It also includes newly shot Super 8 footage of downtown Los Angeles, set to poems read out loud by Bukowski, as well as interviews with a present-day Bizio about her experience with the writer. The film’s title takes its inspiration from the final line in Bukowski’s poem “Those Sons of Bitches,” from the 1972 collection Mockingbird Wish Me Luck.\n\nKnown for having written in a frank, rough way Bukowski's “Don’t try” quote on the poet's tombstone is his ultimate life advice.\n\nAs explained by his widow, Linda Lee Bukowski, in an interview with musician Mike Watt, Bukowski was asked to give his life advice for the resource book Who’s Who in America.\n\nBukowski explained it himself in a letter, writing, “Somebody asked me, ‘What do you do? How do you create?’ ‘You don’t,’ I told them. ‘You don’t try. That’s very important, not to try; either for Cadillacs, creation, or immortality. You wait. And if nothing happens, you wait some more.’\n\nIn another letter, he writes, “We work too hard. We try too hard. Don’t try. Don’t work. It’s there. It’s been looking right at us, aching to kick out of the closed womb.”\n\nA farewell to Bukowski with two poems that illustrate his rich in emotion and truth art of the words.\n\n“the laughing heart”\n\nyour life is your life.\n\ndon’t let it be clubbed into dank\n\nsubmission.\n\nbe on the watch.\n\nthere are ways out.\n\nthere is light somewhere.\n\nit may not be much light but\n\nit beats the\n\ndarkness.\n\nbe on the watch.\n\nthe gods will offer you\n\nchances.\n\nknow them, take them.\n\nyou can’t beat death but\n\nyou can beat death\n\nin life,\n\nsometimes.\n\nand the more often you\n\nlearn to do it,\n\nthe more light there will\n\nbe.\n\nyour life is your life.\n\nknow it while you have\n\nit.\n\nyou are marvelous\n\nthe gods wait to delight\n\nin\n\nyou.\n\n“putrefaction”\n\nof late\n\nI’ve had this thought\n\nthat this country\n\nhas gone backwards\n\n4 or 5 decades\n\nand that all the\n\nsocial advancement\n\nthe good feeling of\n\nperson toward\n\nperson\n\nhas been washed\n\naway\n\nand replaced by the same\n\nold\n\nbigotries.\n\nwe have\n\nmore than ever\n\nthe selfish wants of power\n\nthe disregard for the\n\nweak\n\nthe old\n\nthe impoverished\n\nthe\n\nhelpless.\n\nwe are replacing want with\n\nwar\n\nsalvation with\n\nslavery.\n\nwe have wasted the\n\ngains\n\nwe have become\n\nrapidly\n\nless.\n\nwe have our Bomb\n\nit is our fear\n\nour damnation\n\nand our\n\nshame."
