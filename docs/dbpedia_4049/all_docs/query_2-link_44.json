        "text": "Full Name: Henry Charles Bukowski, born Heinrich Karl Bukowski\n\nProfession: Poet and Writer\n\nBiography: Charles Bukowski was an American poet, novelist, and short-story writer known for his gritty, raw depictions of the downtrodden and dispossessed in American society. His work, heavily influenced by the environment of Los Angeles and its surrounding areas where he lived, often delves into the experiences of the poor, the alcoholic, the marginalized, and the broken.\n\nHe began writing at a young age but initially found little success. He started to gain widespread recognition only in his late forties, largely due to the efforts of the small independent publisher Black Sparrow Press. One of his most famous books, Post Office, was published in 1971 and describes the drudgery and banality of working as a mail carrier and sorter, a job Bukowski held for over a decade.\n\nBukowski's writing style is noted for its simplicity and directness, often employing coarse language and brutal honesty. He was heavily influenced by the German-American poet and journalist Henry Miller, and like Miller, Bukowski often included autobiographical elements in his works. His alter ego, Henry Chinaski, appears in multiple novels and stories and serves as a stand-in for the author.\n\nHis poetry, often just as crude as his prose, gained a significant following in its own right. Collections like Love Is a Dog from Hell and Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame are major works in contemporary American poetry. The poems tackle themes from the mundane realities of life to complexities of despair, love, and existential yearning.\n\nBukowski was no stranger to controversy; his emphasis on themes of sex, alcoholism, and societal decay made him a polarizing figure. This didn't deter his growing following, however, and he became something of a celebrity, especially in Europe.\n\nBorn: August 16, 1920\n\nBirthplace: Andernach, Prussia, Germany\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Monkey\n\nStar Sign: Leo"
