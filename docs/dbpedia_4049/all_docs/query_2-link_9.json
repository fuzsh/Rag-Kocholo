        "text": "Charles Bukowski’s writing is compulsively self-destructive and lives in a way that is unsympathetic and bitter.\n\nHe talks about suffering, death,bad luck, his addiction to alcohol, his inability to cope with loneliness and boredom.\n\nBukowski’s writing chooses authenticity over conformity of making life and existence more endurable through art.\n\nWhen you read bukowski, you can interpret some serious psychological problems like emotional deprivation, childhood trauma, emotional neglect, crippled masculinity, hedonistic escapism.\n\nBukowski’s life was not perpetually joyful, he embodies the kind of cynicism we don’t say out loud to anyone, perhaps not even to our own selves.\n\nHis characters are not Hero archetype, they completely reject conventional heroic traits and instead are deeply flawed and morally ambiguous.\n\nHis characters are antisocial, repulsive and misantropic.\n\nBukowski has a very dark humor which is an obvious escaping mechanism.\n\nThe book I’m rereading this week is “Ham on Rye’\n\nreading this book really broke my heart severely.\n\nHere are some Bukowski’s books read by me:\n\nWomen\n\nFactotum\n\nHam on Rye\n\nNotes of dirty old man\n\nTales of ordinary madness\n\nThe flash of lightning from behind the mountain.\n\nHave you ever read any of Bukowski’s writing?"
