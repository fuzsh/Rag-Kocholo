        "text": "Authors\n\nJarosław Kuyath University of Opole, Poland\n\nDOI:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.26417/ejls.v5i3.p11-13\n\nKeywords:\n\nBukowski, America’s South, Beat Generation\n\nAbstract\n\nOne of the most expressive trends in American culture of the 1950s and 1960s, manifested by the treatment of travel as a motive of life in both the mental and creative spheres, can be confidently attributed to the Beat generation. Their consumption lifestyle, crazy undertakings, love and moral fights, in which they entered without any moderation, led them to living problems and, consequently, to being lost. This generation almost automatically brings to mind the portrait of young, vulnerable Americans, rebellious and lost, oppressed and radical, wanting freedom and falling into trouble. The myth of the Beat generation is one of the most distinct myths of American culture of the twentieth century. We know very little about Beat in Poland. Admittedly, there have been several studies concerning the literary output of Beat writers, but they do not fully reflect the complexity of the phenomenon and contexts in which they were shaped. We are constantly looking at them in terms of mythologized rebellion. Associated with beat, Charles Bukowski is the best example of a person whose work was inspired by his own experiences related to sex, alcohol, poverty and human weaknesses.\n\nDownloads\n\nPublished\n\n2019-08-31\n\nLicense\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 European Journal of Language and Literature\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License."
