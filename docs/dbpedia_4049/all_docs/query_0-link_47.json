        "text": "1. Charles Bukowski, known for his gritty and raw writing style, actually held down a steady job for over a decade as a postal worker. This surprising fact contradicts the popular image of him as a perpetual outsider and shows that he was able to balance a stable career alongside his literary pursuits.\n\n2. Despite being known for his heavy drinking and wild lifestyle, Bukowski actually quit drinking alcohol at the age of 62. This decision came about after a health scare and reflects a lesser-known period of sobriety in the later years of his life.\n\n3. Bukowski, who is often associated with Los Angeles, actually spent a significant portion of his childhood and early adulthood in Europe. Born in Germany, he moved to the US at the age of 3 but returned to Germany when he was 16. He lived in Germany and moved around Europe for a few years before finally settling in Los Angeles.\n\n4. Bukowski's first novel, \"Post Office,\" which is heavily autobiographical, was not published until he was 50 years old. Before that, he primarily wrote poetry and short stories, struggling to find a publisher willing to take on his work. The book's success marked a turning point in his career and gained him wider recognition."
