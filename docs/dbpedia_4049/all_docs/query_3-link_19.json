Also author of a one-hour documentary film, produced by KCET public television, Los Angeles. A collection of Bukowski's papers is housed at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nADAPTATIONS:\n\nStories from Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions, and General Tales of Ordinary Madness were adapted by Marco Ferreri, Sergio Amidei, and Anthony Foutz into the film Tales of Ordinary Madness, Fred Baker, 1983; a film adaptation of Love Is a Dog from Hell was produced in 1988; The Works of Charles Bukowski, based upon more than thirty of his works published by Black Sparrow Press, was staged by California State University in Los Angeles, 1988; Crazy Love, based on The Copulating Mermaids of Venice, California, was filmed in 1989; the film Factotum, based on Bukowski's novel of the same name, was released by IFC films, 2006; The Most Beautiful Woman in Town, and Other Stories, inspired the film The Ballad of Hank and Cass, 2007.\n\nSIDELIGHTS:\n\nCharles Bukowski was a prolific underground writer who depicted in his poetry and prose the depraved metropolitan environments of the downtrod- den in American society. A cult hero, Bukowski relied on experience, emotion, and imagination in his works, often using direct language and violent and sexual imagery. While some critics found his style offensive, others claimed that Bukowski satirized the machismo attitude through his routine use of sex, alcohol abuse, and violence. \"Without trying to make himself look good, much less heroic, Bukowski writes with a nothing-to-lose truthfulness which sets him apart from most other ‘autobiographical’ novelists and poets,\" commented Stephen Kessler in the San Francisco Review of Books, adding: \"Firmly in the American tradition of the maverick, Bukowski writes with no apologies from the frayed edge of society, beyond or beneath respectability, revealing nasty and alarming underviews.\"\n\nBorn in Germany, Bukowski was brought to the United States at the age of two. His father believed in firm discipline and often beat Bukowski for the smallest offenses. A slight child, Bukowski was also bullied by boys his own age, and was frequently rejected by girls because of his bad complexion. In 1939, Bukowski began attending Los Angeles City College, dropping out at the beginning of World War II and moving to New York to become a writer. The next few years were spent writing and traveling and collecting numerous rejection slips. By 1946 Bukowski had decided to give up his writing aspirations, and what followed was a binge that took him all over the world and lasted for approximately ten years. Ending up near death, Bukowski's life changed and he started writing again. \"If a writer must sample life at its most elemental, then surely Bukowski qualifies as a laureate of poetic preparedness,\" observed a contributor to the Dictionary of Literary Biography; Bukowski's many jobs over the years included stock boy, dishwasher, postal clerk, and factory worker. He did not begin his professional writing career until the age of thirty-five, and like other contemporaries, Bukowski began by publishing in underground newspapers, especially in his local papers, Open City and the L.A. Free Press. \"It is tempting to make correlations between [Bukowski's] emergence in Los Angeles literary circles and the arrival of the 1960s, when poets were still shaking hands with Allen Ginsberg and other poets of his generation while younger activist poets tapped on their shoulders, begging for an introduction,\" explained the contributor to the Dictionary of Literary Biography. \"Bukowski cultivated his obvious link to both eras—the blackness and despair of the 1950s with the rebellious cry of the 1960s for freedom.\"\n\n\"Published by small, underground presses and ephemeral mimeographed little magazines,\" stated a contributor to Contemporary Novelists, \"Bukowski has gained popularity, in a sense, through word of mouth.\" Many of his fans regarded him as one of the best of the Meat School poets, who are known for their tough and direct masculine writing.\n\nAfter his first book of poetry was published in 1959, Bukowski wrote more than forty others. Flower, Fist, and Bestial Wail, Bukowski's first book of poetry, covers the major interests and themes that occupy many of his works, the most important being a sense of desolation. In addition, Bukowski also filled his free verse with all the absurdities of life, especially in relation to death. Among the subjects which are used to describe this bleak world are drinking, sex, gambling, and music. It Catches My Heart in Its Hands: New and Selected Poems, 1955-1963, published in 1963, collects poetry written by Bukowski between the years of 1955 and 1963. The poems touch on topics that were familiar to Bukowski, such as rerolling cigarette butts, the horse that came in, a hundred-dollar call girl, and a rumpled hitchhiker on his way to nowhere.\n\nSubsequent works, such as Dangling in the Tournefortia, addressed subjects similar to those in his first collection. \"Low-life bard of Los Angeles, Mr. Bukowski has nothing new for us here,\" observed Peter Schjeldahl in the New York Times Book Review, \"simply more and still more accounts in free verse of his follies with alcohol and women and of fellow losers hitting bottom and somehow discovering new ways to continue falling.\" Despite the subject matter, though, Schjeldahl found himself enjoying the poems in Dangling in the Tournefortia. \"Bukowski writes well,\" he continued, \"with ear-pleasing cadences, wit and perfect clarity, which are all the more beguiling for issuing from a stumblebum persona. His grace with words gives a comic gleam to even his meanest revelations.\" A contributor to the Times Literary Supplement, noted: \"Life here has almost entirely mastered art.\"\n\nSimilar to his poetry in subject matter, Bukowski's short stories also deal with sex, violence, and the absurdities of life. His first collection of short stories, Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions, and General Tales of Ordinary Madness, was followed by Hot Water Music, published in 1983. The protagonists in the stories live in cheap hotels and are often struggling underground writers, similar to Bukowski himself. Bukowski's main autobiographical figure is Henry Chinaski, who appears in a few of these stories and in many of his novels.\n\nAmong the semiautobiographical stories in this collection are two that deal with events following the funeral of Bukowski's father. The other stories deal with numerous violent acts, including a jealous wife shooting her husband over an old infidelity, a drunk bank manager molesting young children, a former stripper mutilating the man she is seducing, and a young man who gets over his impotence by raping a neighbor in his apartment elevator. \"Lives of quiet desperation explode in apparently random and unmotivated acts of bizarre violence,\" described Michael F. Harper in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, adding: \"There is certainly a raw power in these stories, but Bukowski's hard-boiled fatalism seems to me the flip side of the humanism he denies and therefore just as false as the sentimentality he ridicules.\"\n\nBukowski continued his examination of \"broken people\" in such novels as Post Office and Ham on Rye. In Post Office, Henry Chinaski is very similar to ex-postman Bukowski; he is a remorseless drunk and womanizer who spends a lot of time at the race track. Chinaski also has to deal with his monotonous and strenuous job, as well as a number of harassing supervisors. Eventually marrying a rich nymphomaniac from Texas, Chinaski is inevitably dumped for another man and finds himself back at the post office. Writing in the Times Literary Supplement, a reviewer saw the novel as a success: \"Pressed in by Post Office bureaucrats, their mean-minded regulations and their heaps of paperwork, the misfit [Chinaski] looks frequently like an angel of light. His refusal to play respectability ball with the cajoling, abusive, never-take-no-for-an-answer loops who own the mailboxes he attends … can make even this ribald mess of a wretch seem a shining haven of sanity in the prevailing Los Angeles grimnesses.\"\n\nHam on Rye, published in 1982, features Henry Chinaski as its protagonist. Bukowski travels into new territory with this novel, describing his/Chinaski's childhood and adolescent years. The first part of the book is dominated by Chinaski's brutal and domineering father, focusing more on Henry as he moves into his lonely and isolated adolescent years. Following high school, Chinaski holds a job and attends college for a short period of time before beginning his \"real\" life of cheap hotels, sleazy bars, and the track. It is also at this time that Henry starts to send stories to magazines and accumulate a number of rejection slips. \"Particularly striking is Bukowski's uncharacteristic restraint: the prose is hard and exact, the writer's impulse towards egocentricity repressed,\" commented a contributor to the Times Literary Supplement. A Los Angeles Times Book Review contributor described the \"first-person reminiscences\" in Ham on Rye as being \"taut, vivid, intense, sometimes poignant, [and] often hilarious,\" concluding that Bukowski's \"prose has never been more vigorous or more powerful.\"\n\nContinuing the examination of his younger years, Bukowski wrote the screenplay for the movie Barfly, which was released in 1987, starring Mickey Rourke. The movie focuses on three days in the life of Bukowski at the age of twenty-four. As the lead character, Henry Chinaski, Rourke spends most of these three days in a seedy bar, where he meets the first real love of his life, Wanda, played by Faye Dunaway. While this new romance is developing, a beautiful literary editor takes an interest in Chinaski's writings and tries to seduce him with success. Chinaski must then choose between the two women. \"At first Barfly seems merely a slice of particularly wretched life,\" observed David Ansen in Newsweek. \"But under its seedy surface emerges a cunning comedy—and a touching love story.\"\n\nBukowski's experiences with the making of Barfly became the basis of his novel Hollywood. Chinaski is now an old man, married to Sarah, a shrewd woman apt to interrupt him during his many repetitious stories. The couple is off hard liquor, but are faithful drinkers of good red wine, and their life is a peaceful one until a filmmaker asks Chinaski to write a screenplay based upon his previous lifestyle; he agrees, figuring that this new venture will leave him enough time to spend at the track. Entering the world of show business, Chinaski finds himself mingling with famous stars, but must also deal with a number of other things, including a tax man (who advises him to spend his advance money before the government can get it). As the project progresses, its funding becomes shaky, the producer threatens to dismember parts of his body if the movie is not made, there are many rewrites, and Chinaski is hit with a terrible sadness. The movie is about what he used to be—a poetic barfly—and covers a time in his life when he feels he did his best writing. An old man now, Chinaski can watch his life being acted out at the movies, but he cannot jump back into it; he is now a successful man leading a respectable life. \"The words often jar and Bukowski is better when he lets his dialogue do his griping for him. But this is still a superb snapshot of what filmmaking at the fag-end of the Hollywood dream is all about,\" wrote a contributor to the Times Literary Supplement.\n\nPulp, published posthumously, is the novel Bukowski worked on just prior to his death in 1994 from leukemia. It is a send-up, Bukowski-style, of the pulp detective novel. His protagonist, not surprisingly a Bukowski-like character, is Nicky Belane, who sometimes wonders if he is Harry Martel. Like any good pulp detective, Belane has a series of clients, including Lady Death (looking for Celine, who has been spotted in L.A. bookstores), John Barton (looking for the Red Sparrow, which is a play on Bukowski's publisher John Martin of Black Sparrow Press), and a host of others, whose stories come together in the final pages. A contributor to the New York Times Book Review wrote: \"It does not, of course, take much to send up the hard-boiled detective novel.\" The reviewer went on to write: \"The conventions … seem to mock themselves, if you stand back a bit. But Pulp does more than stand back from itself.\" Daniel Woodreli, writing in Washington Post Book World, also found Bukowski's reworking of a time-honored form refreshing: \"The hard-boiled form as a framework is nicely utilized, with snappy dialogue that is always off-center, and oddly very honest.\" He continued, \"[Bukowski] treats it with a kind of poignant ridicule that somehow works. Pulp is comic and bizarre and sad without a trace of self-pity.\" A New York Times Book Review contributor found deeper significance in the novel beyond its form, stating that \"as parody, Pulp does not cut very deep. As a farewell to readers, as a gesture of rapprochement with death, as Bukowski's send-up and send-off of himself, this bio-parable cuts as deep as you would want.\"\n\nRun with the Hunted: A Charles Bukowski Reader is an anthology of Bukowski's stories and poetry, placed chronologically in the periods in which they were set (not published). It provides a solid overview of Bukowski's work and—given its autobiographical nature—his life. It is \"an effective primer for the uninitiated, or a refresher for past readers who, incredibly, have managed to forget,\" commented a Publishers Weekly contributor. Elizabeth Young in New Statesman & Society at once lauded and criticized the anthology, noting: \"From the vast vat of Bukowski homebrew, John Martin has distilled a cut-glass decanter of 100-proof literary perfection.\" The reviewer continued: \"[He] has done Bukowski a great service—and a sort of disservice too. After such a brilliantly constructed anthology, who is going to read all the books?\" Bukowski's previously unpublished work, introduced posthumously by Black Sparrow Press in Betting on the Muse: Poems & Stories, shows him to have continued in the same vein with the character Henry Chinaski, as well as with the verse that made him, according to a Publishers Weekly contributor, the \"original take-no-prisoners poet.\" Ray Olson, writing for Booklist, found his stories and poems to be \"effortlessly, magnetically readable, especially if you are susceptible to their bargain-basement existentialist charm.\"\n\nBukowski's life via his letters is chronicled in Screams from the Balcony: Selected Letters, 1960-1970. \"The honesty, humor and lack of pretension in these letters make them a must for Bukowski fans and an engaging read for anyone interested in literary lives,\" wrote a Publishers Weekly contributor. Benjamin Segedin in Booklist wrote that occasional readers and fans alike would find Bukowski \"perversely intriguing, attracting the kind of attention one usually reserves for grisly train wrecks.\" Screams from the Balcony was followed by Reach for the Sun: Selected Letters, 1978-1994, which covered the last years of the poet's life. In letters to his publishers, editors, friends, and fellow poets, Bukowski railed against critics, praised the writers who first inspired him, and wrote a great deal about three of his favorite subjects: drinking, women, and the racetrack. \"Above all, however, they reveal a man dedicated to his craft,\" noted William Gargan in Library Journal.\n\nStill more new work was published posthumously with the poetry collections What Matters Most Is How Well You Walk through the Fire and Open All Night: New Poems. Reviewing the former, Booklist contributor Ray Olson maintained: \"If Bukowski's stuff appeals to you at all, [What Matters Most] should be gratifying as all get-out.\" Open All Night was judged somewhat less than the poet's best work by Olson in another Booklist article, but while he noted that \"there are better books for one's first taste of Bukowski,\" he added that \"this one will do fine for connoisseurs.\" A Publishers Weekly contributor commented: \"Nobody will be converted to Bukowski by these verses, but that's hardly the point: like William Burroughs or Jim Morrison, Bukowski in death retains the tenacious (and mostly youthful) fan base he gathered in life.\"\n\nAn intimate look into Bukowski's last days is provided by The Captain Is out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken over the Ship, a collection of journal entries from the poet's last years. It begins with his usual celebrations and ruminations on gambling, women, and drinking, but takes on \"tragic overtones\" as the writer comes to terms with his diagnosis of leukemia, reported Gerald Locklin in Review of Contemporary Fiction. \"These reflections approaching endgame reveal the complex humanity of a too-often caricatured figure who beat seemingly prohibitive odds to achieve the destiny he came to embrace as a world-class writer of uncompromising novels, stories, and poems.\" Booklist contributor Mike Tribby also recommended The Captain Is out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken over the Ship as a fine portrait of the \"cranky, sardonic, insightful master of gritty expression whose roaring public appearances of the '60s triggered the rebirth of poetry as performance.\"\n\nYears after Bukowski's death, both new and previously published works continue to be published. As noted by Dwight Garner in the New York Times: \"He left a ton of work behind—so much that his publisher, Ecco, has been issuing annual collections of new Bukowski poems for some time now, and will keep going.\" Sifting through the Madness for the Word, the Line, the Way: New Poems, published in 2003, is the first of five Ecco publications of Bukowski's poems, most of them previously unpublished. \"This volume is essential for Bukowski fans and an excellent introduction for new readers,\" wrote Rochelle Ratner in Library Journal. George Economou, writing in World Literature Today, noted that the collection provides \"certain familiar enjoyments in its recapitulation of the signature features that made reading Bukowski fun in the first place.\"\n\nThe next collection published by Ecco, The Flash of Lightning behind the Mountain: New Poems, contains many of the author's later poems. \"This is mellow Buk,\" wrote Ray Olson in Booklist. In a review of Slouching toward Nirvana: New Poems Booklist contributor Olson called it \"one of his best collections.\"\n\nBukowski's posthumous poetry collections continue to receive praise from reviewers. A Publishers Weekly contributor wrote of The People Look like Flowers at Last: New Poems: \"Fans … may discover one of his strongest, most affecting books.\" Another collection, Come on In! New Poems, \"is full of sad, hilarious lamentation,\" according to Booklist contributor Olson. The Pleasures of the Damned: Poems, 1951-1993, published in 2007, has been touted as the last book containing any of Bukowski's unpublished poems. A Publishers Weekly contributor noted the author's \"ironic takes on ailments of mind and body.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nBrewer, Gay, Charles Bukowski, Twayne (New York, NY), 1997.\n\nCherkovski, Neeli, Bukowski: A Life, Steerforth Press (South Royalton, VT), 1997.\n\nChristy, Jim, The Buk Book: Musings on Charles Bukowski, ECW Press (Toronto, Ontario, Canada), 1997.\n\nContemporary Literary Criticism, Gale (Detroit, MI), Volume 2, 1974, Volume 5, 1976, Volume 9, 1978, Volume 41, 1987, Volume 82, 1994.\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 5: American Poets since World War II, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1980.\n\nDorbin, Sanford, A Bibliography of Charles Bukowski, Black Sparrow Press (Santa Rosa, CA), 1969.\n\nDuval, Jean-François, Bukowski and the Beats, translated from the French by Alison Ardron, followed by An Evening at Buk's Place: An Interview with Charles Bukowski, Sun Dog Press (Northville, MI), 2002.\n\nFox, Hugh, Charles Bukowski: A Critical and Bibliographical Study, Abyss Publications (Somerville, MA), 1969.\n\nHarrison, Russell, Against the American Dream: Essays on Charles Bukowski, Black Sparrow Press (Santa Rosa, CA), 1994.\n\nKirkpatrick, D.L., editor, Contemporary Novelists, 4th edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1986.\n\nMiles, Barry, Charles Bukowski, Virgin Books (London, England), 2006.\n\nRichmond, Steve, Spinning off Bukowski, Sun Dog Press (Northville, MI), 1996.\n\nSherman, Jory, Bukowski: Friendship, Fame, and Bestial Myth, Blue Horse Press (Augusta, GA), 1982.\n\nSounes, Howard, Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life, Grove Press (New York, NY), 1998.\n\nWeinberg, Jeffrey, editor, A Charles Bukowski Checklist, Water Row Press, 1987.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAmerica's Intelligence Wire, August 18, 2006, \"‘Factotum’ Turns a Lens on Charles Bukowski's Dark Life.\"\n\nBaltimore Sun, September 8, 2006, \"‘Factotum’ Is a Bleak Portrait of Boozy Bukowski.\"\n\nBooklist, February 15, 1993, Jules Smith, review of The Last Night of the Earth Poems, p. 1010; January 15, 1994, Benjamin Segedin, review of Screams from the Balcony: Selected Letters, 1960-1970, p. 893; May 15, 1996, review of Betting on the Muse: Poems & Stories, p. 1563; May 15, 1998, Mike Tribby, review of The Captain Is out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken over the Ship, p. 1587; December 15, 1999, Ray Olson, review of What Matters Most Is How Well You Walk through the Fire, p. 752; December 1, 2000, Ray Olson, review of Open All Night: New Poems, p. 689; November 15, 2001, Ray Olson, review of The Night Torn Mad with Footsteps, p. 542; January 1, 2003, Ray Olson, review of Sifting through the Madness for the Word, the Line, the Way: New Poems, p. 836; December 1, 2003, Ray Olson, review of The Flash of Lightning behind the Mountain: New Poems, p. 635; January 1, 2005, Ray Olson, review of Slouching toward Nirvana: New Poems, p. 803; December 1, 2005, Ray Olson, review of Come on In!
