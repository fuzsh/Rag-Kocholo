        "text": "a song with no end when Whitman wrote, “I sing the body electric” I know what he meant I know what he wanted: to be completely alive every moment in spite of the inevitable. we can’t cheat death but we can make it work so hard that when it does take us it will have known a victory just as perfect as ours.\n\nCharles Bukowski from the night torn with mad footsteps, Ecco, 2003\n\nToday, August 16th is the birthday of the notoriously controversial and provocative bad-boy of poetry, the German American Charles Bukowski. The author of more than forty novels and poetry collections his latest poetry collection was published earlier this year: On Drinking which not surprisingly is a collection of his “drinking” poems. For a wide-ranging discussion of the critical response to that book (many disapprovals) and to Bukowski in general the recent article by American poet Clint Margrave on Bukowski is helpful. The the link to the article please click here.\n\nAnd please note: nothing about Bukowski is straight forward. Some of his poems have multiple versions and some of his poems published after his death are said to have been mangled by an editor.\n\nBukowski is not for the faint of heart. And everything about him seems larger than life. That is apparent in the number of Hollywood films (Barfly and others) on him and taped interviews with him. He could be fouled mouthed and abusive. He lived a rough and tumble drinking life with lots of womanizing but he was not afraid to make that uncomfortably explicit in many of his poems. But and this is a big but for me, based on the relatively small number of his poems I have read (out of about 5,000 that have been catalogued) there is a treasure trove of wisdom on life and living in his poems that he earned the hard way.\n\nThe emotional depth in his poems is evident in some of his best-known poems including The Bluebird, The Crunch and The Laughing Heart. The Bluebird, in particular, strikes me as a heart-stopping look inside the heart and soul of an alcoholic. The power of alcohol to numb the Bluebird, the vulnerable and aching part I would say lives in all of us. but is expressed or not in so many different ways.\n\nTwo of the three Bukowski poems I feature in this blog post share lines with a hard echo that gets me every time I read them. From the epigraph poem for this post: we can’t cheat death but we can make it/work so hard/ that when it does take us// it will have known a victory just as/ perfect as/ ours. And this echo in his well-known poem The Laughing Heart: you can’t beat death but/ you can beat death/ in life, sometimes.\n\nthe laughing heart\n\nyour life is your life\n\ndon’t let it be clubbed into dank\n\nsubmission.\n\nbe on the watch.\n\nthere are ways out.\n\nthere is a light somewhere.\n\nit may not be much light but\n\nit beats the\n\ndarkness.\n\nbe on the watch.\n\nthe gods will offer you\n\nchances.\n\nknow them.\n\ntake them.\n\nyou can’t beat death but\n\nyou can beat death\n\nin life,\n\nsometimes.\n\nand the more often you\n\nlearn to do it,\n\nthe more light there will\n\nbe.\n\nyour life is your life.\n\nknow it while you have\n\nit.\n\nyou are marvelous\n\nthe gods wait to delight\n\nin\n\nyou.\n\nCharles Bukowski from Betting on the Muse, Ecco Press, 2004\n\nKnowing the gritty world Bukowski lived in and how he loved to flout conventional norms and thinking (even romanticizing his drinking) I find his admonition at the end of The Laughing Heart, so arresting. I use this poem in my poetry therapy sessions. And often ask the particpants if they can believe and accept those last four lines. I cherish them. What a different way to approach each day. Wow. Good morning! The goods await to delight in me!\n\nAnd for us writers this poem below is a cautionary tale. By his definition am I writer? Yikes!\n\nso you want to be a writer?\n\nif it doesn’t come bursting out of you\n\nin spite of everything,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nunless it comes unasked out of your\n\nheart and your mind and your mouth\n\nand your gut,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you have to sit for hours\n\nstaring at your computer screen\n\nor hunched over your\n\ntypewriter\n\nsearching for words,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you’re doing it for money or\n\nfame,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you’re doing it because you want\n\nwomen in your bed,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you have to sit there and\n\nrewrite it again and again,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif it’s hard work just thinking about doing it,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nif you’re trying to write like somebody\n\nelse,\n\nforget about it.\n\nif you have to wait for it to roar out of\n\nyou,\n\nthen wait patiently.\n\nif it never does roar out of you,\n\ndo something else.\n\nif you first have to read it to your wife\n\nor your girlfriend or your boyfriend\n\nor your parents or to anybody at all,\n\nyou’re not ready.\n\ndon’t be like so many writers,\n\ndon’t be like so many thousands of\n\npeople who call themselves writers,\n\ndon’t be dull and boring and\n\npretentious, don’t be consumed with self-\n\nlove.\n\nthe libraries of the world have\n\nyawned themselves to\n\nsleep\n\nover your kind.\n\ndon’t add to that.\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nunless it comes out of\n\nyour soul like a rocket,\n\nunless being still would\n\ndrive you to madness or\n\nsuicide or murder,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nunless the sun inside you is\n\nburning your gut,\n\ndon’t do it.\n\nwhen it is truly time,\n\nand if you have been chosen,\n\nit will do it by\n\nitself and it will keep on doing it\n\nuntil you die or it dies in you.\n\nthere is no other way.\n\nand there never was.\n\nCharles Bukowski from sifting through the madness for the Word, the line, the way , HarperCollins, 2003\n\nThese words are a good reminder for me. Thank you Buk, as he was often called!\n\nwhen it is truly time,\n\nand if you have been chosen,\n\nit will do it by\n\nitself and it will keep on doing it\n\nuntil you die or it dies in you.\n\nthere is no other way.\n\nand there never was.\n\nMay my writing, may your writing, dear readers, never die away."
