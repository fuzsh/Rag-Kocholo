        "text": "Media News\n\nChennai, August 11, 2010\n\nVijay TV had joined with Agaram Foundation started by Actor Surya for Vidhai on Pongal 2010 titled ‘Oru kodi oru thodakkam’. Vidhai project aims to generate huge amount of money to help the underprivileged students to achieve their academic goals. Ten industrialists came together to pool in ten lakhs each summing to one crore on the day of harvest, Pongal festival. This money was made available to the education of the needy who wants to pursue their higher studies.\n\nIn a continuation, Vijay TV is once again shaking hands with Surya’s Agaram on this Independence Day, August 15, 2010.\n\nAmong an ardent audience of about 160 students, their parents and donors, Actor Surya would be a moderator on Vijay TV’s Vidhai that would air on August 15, 2010, 9am. Students would be seen to discuss their dreams and aspirations, what specialization they intend to pursue in their higher studies, future plans, financial status, family background, education and interest of subject in the presence of Actor Surya. The special guest on the show would be Director Bala.\n\nOn speaking about the show, General Manager K.Sriram comments, “Vidhai was initially just a thought. That little spark had led us create this project which was joined hands by many. This indeed gives us the encouragement to make us achieve the required. Vijay TV has always believed in being socially responsible and has done little things to contribute to the betterment of the society. That is when we joined hands with Actor Surya’s Agaram Foundation with the Vidhai project where many deprived students were benefited.\n\nThose students who really understand the value of education would be taken care of completely from the first day of their college till they move on to face the real challenges of life. The five years of the child’s education would be taken care of. When this project was started on the day of Pongal, we had our own doubts whether we would be able to collect so much money. But then, when the donors started to contribute was when we realized that Vidhai is no more a thought, instead a movement”, continues Sriram.\n\nWe thank Agaram volunteers for having a constant monitoring over the students of Tamilnadu and choosing the most deserving among them. We thank Actor Surya and Agaram for having partnered with us in this novel venture”, concludes K.Sriram, General Manager, Vijay TV.\n\nDo not miss to watch ‘Vidhai Suryavudan oru vetri payanam’ on Sunday, August 15, 2010 at 9am on Vijay TV.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nVijay Television pVT lTD\n\nLakshmi\n\nMobile: +9109884941539"
