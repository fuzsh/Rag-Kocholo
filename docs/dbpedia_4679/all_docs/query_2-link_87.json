        "text": "Chennai: Actor Vijay's party Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam will contest the upcoming assembly elections alone. There was an earlier hint that he would cooperate with the Naam Tamilar Katchi led by Seeman, but now it is reported that Vijay is not interested in this.\n\nTo advertise here, Contact Us\n\nThe 2026 assembly elections are crucial for the fledgling Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam and the Naam Tamilar Katchi, which has been increasing its vote share in the elections. Seemanâ€™s Party started as an alternative to Dravidian parties. Vijay has also taken a similar move. It is estimated that if Vijay stands alone in the elections, the votes will be significantly divided and this will harm both DMK and Anna DMK.\n\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\n\nVijay's withdrawal comes at a time when the parties led by Seeman and Vijay are in secret talks to merge and a final announcement on the alliance was expected. It is suggested that Vijay's move is to gain strength by contesting alone as the assembly election is their maiden election. Efforts are underway to expand the party by adding one and a half crore members before the assembly elections. Vijay's move is to bring the youth together and grow the party.\n\nHowever, Seeman says that he has decided to contest the elections alone if no alliance is made with any party. Seeman started Naam Tamilar Katchi in 2010. Seeman's strength is the young people who want change. It has grown to a level that is at least somewhat alarming in the Dravidian parties. In the 2016 assembly elections, it polled 4.25 percent of the votes. In the 2021 assembly elections, it increased to seven percent. The party came third in many constituencies. He won in many places in the local elections. In the Lok Sabha elections, he contested 39 seats in Tamil Nadu and one seat in Puducherry and won more than ten percent votes.\n\nNo selfies and no autographs; Ban on cell phones and pens at Vijay's event\n\nChennai: In Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, mobile phones, pens and paper will be banned at the event organized by actor and Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) leader Vijay to felicitate the students who got the best marks in the 10th and 12th exams. It is reported that these actions are being taken to avoid autographs and selfies. The felicitation ceremony will be held in two phases on June 28 and July 3 at Panaiyur, Chennai.\n\nThe top three candidates in each assembly constituency in Tamil Nadu will be felicitated. During the program which will be held from 9.30 am to 6 pm, Vijay will personally give certificates and prizes to each student. Meanwhile, the actor decided not to take selfies and autographs. TVK leaders explained that the action is to avoid wastage of time.\n\nStudents from Ariyalur, Coimbatore, Dharmapuri, Dindigul, Erode, Kanyakumari, Karur, Krishnagiri, Madurai, Namakkal, Nilgiris, Pudukkottai, Ramanathapuram, Salem, Sivaganga, Tenkasi, Theni, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, Tirupur, and Virudhunagar districts will be felicitated on Friday. On Wednesday, those from the districts of Chennai, Cuddalore, Kallakurichi, Kancheepuram, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Perambalur, Ranipet, Thanjavur, Tiruvallur, Tiruvannamalai, Tiruvarur, Tirupathur, Tiruchirappalli, Vellore, Villupuram and Puducherry Union Territory of Karaikal and Puducherry will be felicitated."
