        "text": "Wanderlust | St. Louis\n\nAmy and I squeezed in tons of things during my brief, three-day visit to the Midwest, so I wanted to make a little guide of where we ate and drank, what we saw, and what we did together in St. Louis.\n\nAmy made appointments for us at Blown Away, a little blow dry-only salon in St. Louis. Its hairdryers are suspended in the air, with the cords plugged to the ceiling for easy of drying for the stylists. Here are our perfect coiffs upon leaving the salon!\n\nLater that night, we hopped on over to Chef Gerard Craft's Pastaria (see review here) in Clayton for some crazy awesome risotto balls and fantastic housemade pastas.\n\nAmy and I met up with her best friend Mel and her brother David at The Muny, the nation's older and largest outdoor musical theatre (largest meaning having the most amount of seats), to see Disney's Mary Poppins: The Musical. After 10-15 minutes into the show, there was a huge downpour of rain, causing the show to postpone until nearly 11 PM (when it was safe for the cast to return to stage without risk of slipping on a wet stage). However, by then, we had already bailed after being drenched in makeshift ponchos and tiny umbrellas to return back to Mel's apartment to watch Two Weeks' Notice. It was an honest effort, and the night ended up being really fun anyhow! :P\n\nThe next morning, we found our way to downtown St. Louis for brunch {1,2} at Rooster, where there was {4} a half hour wait already before 11:30 AM!\n\nBy the time we got our table (actually a lot quicker than the time estimate), we were starving, {5} so we toasted with peach bellinis and had homemade sourdough toast (ha-ha) with butter and fresh strawberry jam. Loved the thick slices! For our main course, Amy had the {8} goat cheese #2 with mushrooms, fresh spinach, and tomato jam, while I had the {6} bacon #2 with Vermont cheddar, caramelized onions, and a spicy mayonnaise.We also shared {7} a side of breakfast potatoes. An utterly and completely solid brunch -- I don't think I've had a breakfast crepe this good. Definitely worth the wait!\n\nAfter brunch, we headed over to {1-2,4} the Gateway Arch to how the wait was for the next ride up to the top of the Arch. The next available Journey to the Top up wasn't for another two hours, so we made sure to buy tickets for the next trip up and walked around for a bit before heading over to the Four Seasons Hotel St. Louis for a little afternoon respite.\n\nQuick panoramic shot of the Gateway Arch!\n\nUnderneath the Arch!\n\n{1,4,7} The Four Seasons St. Louis was about a 10-15 minute walk from the Arch. As with any Four Seasons Hotel, the interiors were serene yet modern, providing us the perfect in between spot to cool down from the summer heat. {3,5} We had great refreshing drinks at Cielo Bar -- {6} Amy had a good ol' mojito while I had a cocktail that had pineapple juice and ginger beer in it I believe. We really enjoyed this nice break, especially {8} with the fabulous view of the Arch right out the window.\n\n{1} We returned back to the tourist concourse at the base of the Gateway Arch. We still had some time to spare so we walked through the Museum of Westward Expansion right inside, which delved into the history of the American expansion into the Midwest and how Louis and Clark ties into it all.\n\n{2} Getting to the top took about a half hour (waiting in line, queuing up, walking through to the little pod entryway, riding a little pod for five to the top, etc.), but when we finally got up there, {3,5} boy, was the view gorgeous! We could see City Hall and Busch Stadium where the St. Louis Cardinals play. {4} I even got a photo of myself with the landmark sign inside the Arch indicating we were 630 feet above the ground!\n\nBefore heading back to Amy's apartment, we made sure to stop at Jilly's Cupcake Bar. I had the {2}24-Karat Carrot Cake cupcake filled with vanilla whipped cream and topped with vanilla cream cheese frosting, toasted coconut, white chocolate shavings, and 24-karat gold dust. Amy had the {3}Twisted Pink Velvet cupcake filled with caramel and topped with cream cheese, caramel buttercream, and a pecan praline. The cake of the cupcake was quite moist and soft, while the toppings and filling are on the sweeter side. As they're quite big, they're best for sharing flavors among a group of friends -- that way you can try many flavors without filling up!\n\nThe colorful bakery window of Jilly's.\n\n{1} Later that evening, I joined Amy and Mel for a cooking class at Kitchen Conservatory entitled Grills Gone Wild, where the entire menu focused on how to best grill indoors. {2} Kitchen Conservatory is a premier kitchen store that has a selection of more than 6,000 essential and useful cooking products in its store as well as {4} offers cooking classes of all genres and cuisines in the two auxiliary kitchens at the back of the store.\n\nThe evening's cooking demo began with {3}some mango mojitos, {5} a lemon herb dip with crudité, as well as {6,7} preparation for our salad and dessert. It was great we came to class hungry, both for food and knowledge. We certainly learned tons with our three-hour session at Kitchen Conservatory -- e.g., how to properly zest a lemon efficiently, how to grill fruit, how to make do with what's available, etc.\n\n{1} The salad ended up turning into grilled hearts of romaine salad with blue cheese dressing and bacon, but I substituted the blue cheese for olive oil and balsamic vinegar (still delicious!). For our main course, we watched our instructor poach potatoes in butter (so much butter but OMG so good!) for the side dish, while simultaneously grilling a generously sized cut of salmon (with the pretty criss-cross charred exterior!). The resulting dish was grilled salmon with tangy horseradish-cucumber sauce along with a side of butter-poached and roasted potatoes. Dessert used the grilled peach sundaes with homemade vanilla bean ice cream, toasted pecans, and grade B maple syrup. Absolute perfection!\n\n{1,5} After class, I wanted to be sure we hit up Taste by Niche before I was to head back to NYC, another spot run by Chef Gerard Craft. I first heard of Taste by Niche listed as part of Bon Appetit's Top 10 Cocktail Bars in America, so I knew we had to check it out.\n\nWhile there was an {1} inside seating area with bar, we decided to sit outside after arriving around 11 PM. It was the perfect decision as these musicians like to play live jazz on Laclede Avenue Amy had the {2}Curious Flowers Hendrick's gin, Fruitlab hibiscus, Mathilde cassis, lemon, house orange marmalade, Angostura, and Gruet brut. This drink was truly delicious, with a nectar-like consistency and finishing with a light herbaceous, fruity groove. I had the {3} Nude Bomb with Plantation 5-Year rum, Rhum JM, St. Germain, Don's Mix, grapefruit, coconut water, and tiki bitters, which channeled sitting under a straw umbrella on a tropical island. Wish we could've tried more drinks here, so there's always next time!\n\n{1} The next morning, Amy and I met my old college roommate, Dave, for brunch at Half & Half.\n\nHalf & Half has a pretty intense coffee selection -- three varieties potentially available in four different brewing methods! Amy got Finca Salaca from Costa Rica roasted by Kaldi's Coffee prepared in a cold brew method. Very concentrated, but very smooth! As for the main courses, {3} I had the salmon hash with potatoes, chives, sunny-side up eggs, and hollandaise. {4} Dave had the eggs benedict with poached eggs, hollandaise, spinach, and ham over english muffins and a side of potatoes. {5} Amy had the Brussels sprout and cheddar omelet with mixed greens. Although the service was unacceptably slow that morning (even after waiting 30-45 minutes for a table), the food was pretty decent and hit the spot for my brunch craving.\n\nLater that afternoon, {1} Amy and I headed to Whole Foods to pick up the necessary ingredients for our homemade feast that evening that Amy and Mel planned to feature in their local St. Louis cooking blog, It Takes Two, with me as a guest chef!\n\nOn the menu: {2} white bean dip with homemade pita chips, a recipe from Food Network's Giada De Laurentiis; {4} tomato and watermelon gazpacho, a recipe from Food Network magazine; {3} an amazing stone fruit sangria, a recipe from Everyday Food; the boldest tomato-beet salad, a recipe from Everyday Food; a modified recipe of roasted salmon with a citrus sauce from Rachael Ray magazine with a recipe for a side of double-mint barley tabbouleh; {5,6} a modified recipe of peach and raspberry crisp (sans raspberries) served with vanilla bean ice cream by Food Network's Ina Garten.\n\nCheck out Mel's blog write-up on \"Fresh Perspectives\" over at It Takes Two!\n\nThanks again to Amy for being the best hostess -- what a great visit to St. Louis!\n\nPrice point: $35 for a blowout at Blown Away; $7.75-8.95 for each breakfast crepe at Rooster, $6 for each cocktail, $1.75 for each side, $2.50 for homemade toast; $10 cocktails at Cielo Bar; $10 per person for a Journey to the Top of the Gateway Arch; $5 per cupcake at Jilly's Cupcake Bar; $10 for each original cocktails at Taste by Niche; $8-11.50 per main course at Half & Half;\n\n--August 2-4, 2013\n\n*Blown Away\n\n8815 Ladue Road\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63124\n\nhttp://www.blownawaystl.com\n\n*Pastaria\n\n7734 Forsyth Boulevard\n\nClayton, MO 63105\n\nhttp://www.pastariastl.com\n\n*The Muny\n\n1 Theatre Drive\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63112\n\nhttp://www.muny.org\n\n*Rooster\n\n1104 Locust Street\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63101\n\nhttp://www.roosterstl.com\n\n*Gateway Arch\n\n100 Washington Avenue\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63102\n\nhttp://www.gatewayarch.org\n\n*Cielo Bar\n\nFour Seasons Hotel St. Louis\n\n999 North 2nd Street\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63102\n\nhttp://www.fourseasons.com/stlouis/dining/lounges/cielo_bar\n\nhttp://www.cielostlouis.com\n\n*Kitchen Conservatory\n\n8021 Clayton Road\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63117\n\nhttp://www.kitchenconservatory.com\n\n*Taste by Niche\n\n4584 Laclede Avenue\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63108\n\nhttp://www.tastebarstl.com\n\nHalf & Half\n\n8133 Maryland Avenue\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63105\n\nhttp://www.halfandhalfstl.com\n\nWhole Foods Market\n\n1160 Town and Country Crossing Drive\n\nTown and Country, MO 63017\n\nhttp://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/townandcountry\n\nDinner | Pastaria\n\nTwo weekends ago, I made a long weekend trip out to St. Louis to visit my dear friend Amy. I arrived early that afternoon, where we spent it catching up until it was time to go to dinner {1,2} at Pastaria, Chef Gerard Craft's latest culinary venture in Clayton, a neighborhood of St. Louis, which opened last fall as a no-reservations, \"casual and family-centric fresh pasta/pizza joint.\"\n\n{4,6} As clear as it is in its name, the restaurant offers dishes with housemade pastas, which you can watch being made from the window display outside. You can also purchase fresh pasta and homemade gelati from the take-away counter. {5} The kitchen opens into {3} the dining room that has {7} cleverly mismatched rustic furniture and tableware to underscore the relaxed environment of Pastaria.\n\nI love the logo (looks like a rogue piece of spaghetti) and the graphic on the menu -- very appropriate and fun!\n\nAs with any good Italian restaurant, there will always be bread, with the hope that it comes out warm, fresh out of the oven. With that, Pastaria certainly delivered!\n\nTo start, Amy and I made sure to have the crispy risotto balls with mozzarella and Grana Padano along with sides of herb aioli and marinara sauce. These were (ahem, excuse my word choice) AMAZEBALLS. You know that pleasant feeling you get when you bite into a just-fried mozzarella stick? Well increase that feeling ten-fold and you will be where I was when I tasted my first risotto ball. It is melty, nicely cheesy, savory, substantial, and crispy all at once. Dip them in some marinara, and you'll want to have another dozen of them. It was probably for the best that we each only had three each. Any more than that would be considered dangerous.\n\nTo counteract the greasy goodnss of the crispy risotto balls, we also shared the orange salad with green olives, red onions, tarragon, and extra virgin olive oil. Though a very simple preparation, it was very refreshing and a good mix of acidity to cut through the other savory dishes we would have that evening.\n\nAs my main course, I had the pistachio ravioli with pistachios, mint, lemon brown butter, and Grana Padano. The pasta itself was incredibly fresh -- you can undoubtedly taste the difference -- and quite possibly some of the best I've ever had, as fresh pasta done right can truly be had to find outside of Italy. These exquisite little pillows were a mix of that obnoxiously good, silky nuttiness you get from roasted pistachios with the sweet creaminess of browned butter. The subtle hint of mint was a nice touch, too.\n\nAmy had the canestri cacio e pepe with pecorino, Grana Padano, and black pepper. The canestri were huge and ridged version of elbow macaroni-shaped pasta. Cacio e pepe is essentially \"cheese and pepper\" in Italian, and it is the simplicity yet genius behind this dish. A creamy blend of pecorino and Grana padano melts into the curvy ridges of the canestri while it all gets balanced out with the generous sprinkling of freshly ground pepper throughout. This dish is quite heavy (don't fill too much beforehand), but that doesn't make it any less great. The hollow holes within the canestri gave us enough surface area of pasta to really enjoy the cacio e pepe sauce.\n\nWe shared a side of the roasted Brussels sprouts with olive oil and chili -- freaking amazing! In my eyes, you can't really screw up roasted Brussels sprouts -- salt, pepper, and olive oil should be enough to do the trick. It's just a fun bonus when you have other things (like chili in this case) thrown into the mix. Loved the browned bits on the outer leaves of the sprouts, which gave them a light charredness to them. These went really well alongside our pasta dishes.\n\nDessert, on the other hand, didn't seem to be Pastaria's strong suit. We shared two desserts, including the cannoli with pastry cream, strawberry balsamic, and salted pistachios, which was pretty disappointing. I guess I had assumed pastry cream was going to be the authentic mascarpone typically piped inside a cannoli shell, but the pastry cream seemed deflated and just not what my Little-Italy-seasoned-palate is used to. Plus, where were the chocolate nibs?!\n\nWe also had the dark chocolate tart with whipped cream an candied hazelnuts, which didn't really seem to resemble a tart except in its shape. It was like a dense chocolate cake more than anything else. I did enjoy the candied hazelnuts here, but everything else was meh. I can't speak from personal experience, but Amy did say that their gelato was quite lovely from what she remembered from her past visits. So thinking back on it now, we probably shoud've stuck with multiple scoops of different flavors, and we would've been happier campers. But it's okay -- everything else shined so brightly, that it wasn't even an issue!\n\nFindings: Given that this was my first real meal in St. Louis, I was pretty impressed (read: REALLY impressed) with what Chef Gerard Craft had cooking at Pastaria (little did I know, it would be indicative of the rest of my meals in this fantastic little city). Those crispy risotto balls continue to haunt me even now, and I dream about those pastas from time to time. Pistachios packed inside ravioli? Ingenious! Plus, knowing that every single pasta dish uses fresh, housemade/extruded pastas just enhances your dining experience that much more. The orange salad was also divine -- as I am sure the other salads are, too -- and even though dessert was pretty much a letdown, I left with quite the happy stomach. We really, really should've gone the gelato route (I mean, just from hearing flavors like toasted coconut, lemon verbena, fresh chocoalte mint, and raspberry black peppercorn, it should've been a no-brainer!).\n\nThat's the best part about summing up the experience, though. You can always say the right thing to alleviate any regrets -- there's always next time! I definitely know where Amy and I will be the minute I'm in town next. Pastaria, with no doubt in my mind! :P Oh, and be sure to show up on the earlier side to avoid a lengthy wait -- this place gets pretty hopping around 7 PM!\n\nPrice point: $7.95 for each starter, $13.95-14.95 for each pasta, $6.95 for each dessert.\n\n--August 2, 2013\n\nPastaria\n\n7734 Forsyth Boulevard\n\nSt. Louis (Clayton), MO 63105\n\nhttp://www.pastariastl.com\n\nWanderlust | Philadelphia\n\nLisa and I made a weekend trip to Philadelphia a couple weeks ago to visit our dear friend Dani (pretty much a girls' weekend :P), so I wanted to give a rundown of where we ate and drank, what we saw, and what we did during those two days.\n\nWe got in on a late Friday afternoon, where we settled into our hotel room (yay for corner rooms at the DoubleTree Hilton!) and {1,4} pretty much went straight to happy hour at restauranteur Stephen Starr's English pub, The Dandelion.\n\nAlong with $4 house wines (we opted for rieslings), we got {5,6}$2 bar snacks (including bar nuts toasted in butter and and marinated olives with herbs, spices, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar) and {2}chicken and duck liver parfait with grape chutney, cornichons, and brioche toast and rosemary (off the regular menu). The nuts were nicely browned and had a really distinct rosemary flavor. They were so good that Lisa wants to try to replicate this at home! The liver parfait was out of this world, as it was the perfect blend of paté together (even better with a sprinkle of sea salt that came with the butter and {3} country white and stout bread). Not bad for happy hour!\n\nAfter happy hour, we made our way to {1-4} The Barnes Foundation (of Philadelphia) for a night of jazz (the Museum hosts live music performances on Friday evenings) and art. While the space alone is simply stunning, what an unbelievable collection of art it has housed in its merely-a-year-old modern walls! We saw the featured exhibit, Ellsworth Kelly: Sculpture on the Wall, as well as the rooms filled with the Foundation's permanent collection.\n\nWhilst waiting in queue for dinner at Oyster House, {1} we had pre-dinner cocktails at Stephen Starr's Cuban restaurant, Alma de Cuba. {2}I had the Alma Colada with passionfruit juice, coconut milk blended with ice, Bacardi Superior, shaved coconut, and a drizzle of Myer's dark rum; Lisa had the Mango Martini with Ketel One vodka, mango liqueur, and mango purée; and Dani had the Black Cherry Caipirinha (Portuguese for \"little peasant girl\") made with muddled limes, sugar, and black cherry-infused Brazilian Leblon Cachaca. Delicious stuff!\n\nWe waited about 30-45 minutes at Alma de Cuba for a table {1}at Oyster House, where we eventually began with sips of {2} Mother's Ruin punch with gin, fresh grapefruit, cinnamon tea-infused vermouth, and sparkling wine,{4}a bottle of Narragansett Lager, as well as The Bloody Caesar with real clam juice, Sobieski vodka, spicy tomato juice, and horseradish. {3} Please also note the ginormous homemade oyster crackers Oyster House offers in lieu of a bread basket.\n\nFor our main meals, {5} Dani had the OH Burger made from grass-fed beef and topped with blue cheese, a fried oyster, and grilled onions with a side of hand-cut fries; {6} Lisa had the Fisherman's Stew with shellfish and fish in a spicy broth and saffron rouille; {8} while I had an order of fried Ipswich clams (essentially fried full-belly clams)! Mine and Lisa's were quite good, while Dani's burger was a little overpowered by the blue cheese (but had great elements like the fried oyster!).\n\nAnd obviously we couldn't have gone to oyster house without ordering our fair share of oysters. Here was the rundown:\n\n*Chincoteague (Chincoteague Bay, VA): Pretty good, but not much after-taste.\n\n*Cape May Salt (Cape May, NJ): Buttery with a better after-taste than the Chincoteague.\n\nNaked Cowboy (Great South Bay, Long Island, NY): Briny.\n\nLittle Shemogue (New Brunswick, Canada): Very briny.\n\nBeach Blonde (Charlestown, RI): Ehhh...just bland.\n\nSalt Pond (Point Judith Pond, RI): Nope. Too metallic.\n\nMermaid Cove (Prince Edward Island, Canada): Not bad -- just okay.\n\n*Shigoku (Samish Bay, WA): FANTASTIC! Had a deep cup with a nice melon taste. These were our favorites!\n\nOne of my musts on this trip was stopping {1,8} at Federal Donuts for its supposedly {5} awesome donuts and drool-worthy fried chicken, which conquered the next day. I am so very glad that we were able to have both because {2} they sold out of wings within a few minutes after we placed our order for fried chicken!\n\nAs far as donuts were concerned, Lisa and Dani had one of the fancy donuts (pretty much glazed or dressed in something) -- {3}sticky bun and {6}strawberry-ginger -- while I had one that was recommended by one of the girls behind the counter -- {4} vanilla spice from the hot fresh section (essentially freshly fried and sprinkled with flavored sugar). While the fancy donuts had a denser interior and a heavier yet tasty glaze on stop that pretty much mimicked the flavor each had promised, the hot fresh ones just came straight out of the fryer, hot and melty with sprinkled sugar and the intoxicating tease of vanilla with each bite.\n\nFor the donuts alone, a detour here is worth it, but even more so if you can ALSO get your hands on some fried chicken wings. {7}We shared a half dozen of the honey-ginger fried chicken wings which also came straight from the fryer. The batter was perfect -- not too heavy or light, thoroughly enveloping the chicken and adding that savory, loose crunch with each nibble. The honey-ginger was mixed straight into the batter so there was no stickiness to it that you'd normally get with a glazed sauce. Finger licking is inevitable, but don't worry, they give you wet naps to clean off your paws upon demolishing your basket of fried chicken. Anyway, just be sure to get there early enough before the wings sell out or you will be immensely upset for yourself for not getting up earlier.\n\nBlurred shot of us enjoying donuts and fried chicken at Federal Donuts.\n\nA trip to Philly wouldn't truly be authentic to out-of-towners without a taste of a legit Philadelphia cheesesteak. This time, we stopped at Jim's Steaks, which Marcus highly recommended because they chop up the steak meat for easier eating (and in his opinion, tastier overall than slabs of meat).{1,7} The line wasn't too bad around noon when we arrived (and met up with Megan, one of Dani's good friends), and it moves pretty quickly as it's quite an efficient operation happening over there. {2} The menu is pretty straight forward -- just need to choose your cheese, decide whether you want your cheesesteak with or without onions, and note if you want additional toppings like peppers or mushrooms, too. {4,5} The chopped steak and onions are grilled on an open grill, where a large roll is lightly toasted against the browned bits from the meat and onions, followed with a dab of cheese (cheese whiz if you're going the legit authentic route) and a generous scoop of chopped steak and topped with whatever toppings you request. {3,6} Our resulting cheesesteak was one with mushrooms and onions, and it was pretty damn good!\n\nOn our way to Jim's Steaks, {1} I saw a tiny popsicle shop down the street called Lil' Pop Shop which looked totally adorable and sounded really good in the heat, so I suggested we pop in (har, har!) to see what was up. Turns out Dani had been to the shop's other location closer to UPenn and said that Lisa and I had to try it. {4,6} Reading off the first few flavors off the chalkboard menu had us sold, so much that Lisa tried two!\n\n{2} From the pretty array of colorful pops inside the freezer display, Lisa first had the {5} goat cheese with black raspberries (really creamy and rich with nice tartness to it) while I had the Earl Grey with vanilla bean and black pepper (like a cup of peppery English tea turned into a frozen treat). Megan had the Vietnamese coffee (tasting exactly how it sounded), and {3} Lisa encored with coconut hibiscus (which was refreshing, even if it was more coconut than hibiscus). Lil' Pop Shop, please find your way to New York City. We promise we'll be your most loyal customers! :P\n\nAfter our morning/early afternoon eats, we took a stroll through Philadelphia's Magic Gardens, \"a mosaicked visionary art environment, gallery, and community arts center that preserves artist Isaiah Zagar's unique mosaic art environment and public murals.\" The Magic Gardens site (Zagar's largest artwork) includes a fully tiled indoor space and a massive outdoor mosaic sculpture garden that spans half a block on South Street. And get this -- it took him fourteen years to create the Magic Gardens, having completed it in 2008. Quite astounding!\n\nLisa, me, Dani, and Megan at Magic Gardens.\n\nLater that evening, Lisa, Dani, and I got drinks {1}at Franklin Mortgage & Investment Company, another place on my must-do's on this trip, before our extravagant dinner at Vetri. In the late 1920s during Prohibition's prime, The Franklin Mortgage and Investment Co. served as the front of the largest alcohol ring in the country. Max \"Boo Boo\" Hoff (the \"King of Bootleggers\"and his crew ran about 10,000 gallons a day via truck, train, and bus. As \"one of the best drinking establishments in America that assumes the same name in honor of the Jewish mobster who kept Philly wet through the Roaring Twenties,\" The Franklin \"celebrates both the golden age of barrooms of the pre-Prohibition era and the skilled bartenders who fled their homes to pursue a noble craft banned and demonized in its country of origin.\" It is also crazy to know that the team behind The Franklin is the same folks behind Pouring Ribbons (one of my favorite bars!) in New York City.\n\n{2} The bar is located down in the cellar with that appropriate ambient lighting that you would find in a speakeasy like this one. {4} I got the Julie Winters punch which had Duquesne Blanc and Wray & Nephew rhums, Tanqueray gin, Velvet Falernum, Creole Shrubb, Allspice Dram, lime and pineapple juices, and coconut black tea syrup. It was quite strong but had that comfortable quality that punches have about them. {3} Lisa had the Pie Plant Cobbler which had El Dorado 12-Year rum, Terranoble Carmenere, Zucca, Grand Marnier, muddled orange, strawberry basil syrup, and honey -- all served over crushed ice. This tasted like a fruit pie as a strong cocktail -- very deeply fruity and herbaceous. {5} Dani had the Sorry for Partying Punch with Buffalo Trace bourbon, Wray & Nephew rhum, Dolin Blanc vermouth, Creme de Cacao, Nux Alpina walnut liqueur, Campari, lemon juice, strawberry lychee tea syrup, and orange bitters. Also quite punchy, but went down quite easy. Love the tea-bases in the punches at The Franklin! So if you're looking for a stiff, pre-dinner (or post, even) drink, you will undoubtedly find it here.\n\nLisa and Dani at Franklin Mortgage.\n\nLast, but not least, we had a phenomenal and magical six-course dinner at Vetri (see full recap here) -- one of the best meals this year. Definitely goes down in my books as one of my top dining experiences ever.\n\nOther Recommendations from Past Visits\n\n*Barclay Prime (see review here): Marcus and I had a wonderful experience here celebrating our second anniversary at this amazing boutique steakhouse. Not only were our cuts of steak top-top quality, we also got to choose our own steak knives out of an array of four or five different makes.\n\nIl Pittore (see review here): Beautiful interior for an Italian restaurant opened by restauranteur Stephen Starr, playing off the chef's last name and turning it into a painterly masterpiece.\n\n*R2L (see review here): While dining at this restaurant, you get one of the best views Philadelphia from the comfort of your table. Breathtaking, for sure! Plus the food is quite exquisite.\n\n*Matyson (see review here): Really great value for a high-end BYO restaurant -- something you don't ever get to experience in NYC. Food is stellar and impressive with really fun cuts of protein (sweetbreads and foie gras, included) offered throughout the year.\n\n*El Vez (see review here): Excellent fish tacos and cocktails here!\n\n*Chhaya (see review here): You can find some solid brunch food, hands down -- particularly those classic dishes made from batter (i.e., waffles, crepes, pancakes, etc.).\n\nParc (see review here): Stephen Starr's French brasserie puts forth a decent brunch.\n\nCafé Estelle (see review here): You can find yourself a comfortable, unpretentious brunch here.\n\nMarcie Blaine Artisanal Chocolates (see review here): Fun chocolate boutique which pays homage to Philly in many of its designs and varieties.\n\n*OPEN HOUSE: One of my favorite gift shops ever -- you can find the coolest, funkiest gifts here, including a dynamic collection of well-designed, well-curated Philadelphia paraphernalia.\n\n*Philadelphia Museum of Art: A truly fantastic art museum which offers superb art exhibitions regularly. Plus, a trip to Philly isn't complete without having crossed off the \"Rocky Steps\" off your list.\n\nPrice point: $2 for each bar snack at The Dandelion during happy hour, $4 house wines, $13 for each starter; $22 for adult admission to The Barnes Foundation of Philadelphia, $10 for student admission; $10-13 for each cocktail at Alma de Cuba; $9 for each glass of punch at Oyster House, $4 for each beer, $8.50 for each cocktail, $15 for each small plate, $14-21 for each large plate, $1.25-2.75 for each oyster; $1.25 for each hot fresh donut at Federal Donuts, $2 for each fancy donut, $9 for six chicken wings; $8.50 for each cheesesteak at Jim's Steaks; $3 for each popsicle at Lil' Pop Shop; $7 for adult admission to Philadelphia's Magic Gardens, $5 for student admission; $14 for each cocktail at The Franklin Mortgage & Investment Company.\n\n--July 26-27, 2013\n\n*The Dandelion\n\n124 South 18th Street\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19103\n\nhttp://www.thedandelionpub.com\n\n*The Barnes Foundation of Philadelphia\n\n2025 Benjamin Franklin Parkway\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19130\n\nhttp://www.barnesfoundation.org/visit/philadelphia\n\n*Alma de Cuba\n\n1623 Walnut Street\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19103\n\nhttp://www.almadecubarestaurant.com\n\n*Oyster House\n\n1516 Sansom Street\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19102\n\nhttp://www.oysterhousephilly.com\n\n*Federal Donuts\n\n1632 Sansom Street\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19103\n\nhttp://www.federaldonuts.com\n\n*Jim's Steaks\n\n400 South Street\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19147\n\nhttp://www.jimssteaks.com\n\n*Philadelphia's Magic Gardens\n\n1020 South Street\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19147\n\nhttp://www.phillymagicgardens.org\n\n*Lil' Pop Shop\n\n534 South 4th Street\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19147\n\nhttp://www.lilpopshop.com\n\n*The Franklin Mortgage & Investment Co.\n\n112 S 18th Street\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19103\n\nhttp://www.thefranklinbar.com\n\n*Vetri\n\n1312 Spruce Street\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19107\n\nhttp://www.vetriristorante.com"
