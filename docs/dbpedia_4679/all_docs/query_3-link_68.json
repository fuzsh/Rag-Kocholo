        "text": "Suriya and director Vetri Maaran's 'Vaadivaasal', which was announced a couple of years ago, hasn't been shelved. Vetri Maaran confirmed the same in a recent interview with Behindwoods. Despite announcing the film and sharing a glimpse of Suriya's training, there has been no official update about 'Vaadivaasal' for the past two days. Vetri Maaran kept himself busy shooting for 'Viduthalai 1 and 2', starring Vijay Sethupathi and Soori.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAt a recent media interaction, Vetri Maaran was asked a question about the sequel to 'Vada Chennai' with Dhanush. Speaking about 'Vada Chennai 2', he also shared an update regarding his upcoming films.\n\nHe said, \"I don't know about 'Vada Chennai'. I don't even know when 'Viduthalai 2' is going to be released. It's a completed film. After this, I will work on 'Vaadivaasal' and I don't know what's next.\"\n\nHere's a glimpse of 'Vaadivaasal':\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with IndiaToday.in in 2022, producer Thanu said that they have big plans for 'Vaadivaasal'. He added, \"We have big plans for Vaadivaasal, and we have been concentrating in the film for the past few months. Even the pre-production work is being done on a huge scale. We will come up with announcements regarding Vaadivaasal in the coming months.\"\n\n'Vaadivaasal' marks the first collaboration of Suriya and director Vetri Maaran. The film is produced by Kalaipuli S thanu's V Creations. As reported earlier, 'Vaadivaasal is inspired from writer CS Chellappa's novel of the same name.\n\n'Vaadivaasal' is based on jallikattu sport, which is practised in Tamil Nadu. Andrea Jeremiah and Ameer will be seen in pivotal roles."
