        "text": "Well, I am still on the starlet hunt for more 60s glamour girls. My last post seeking help yielded successful contact with former Playboy Playmate Corinne Cole and leads on Bettina Brenna, Suzanne Charny, Dee Duffy, and Corinna Tsopei.\n\nSo here are more starlets. Any information would be greatly appreciated. MIA are Maureen Arthur, Pamela Curran, Kamala Devi (former Mrs. Chuck Connors), Darlene Lucht a.k.a. Tara Ashton, Lee Meredith (above), Alberta Nelson, Jeannine Riley, Linda Rogers, Marilyn Tindall, and Victoria Vetri.\n\nJust a reminder that I will be in beautiful downtown Burbank signing copies of my books at the Hollywood Collectors Show from Jan. 26 to Jan. 28. The competition is going to be rough as fellow homos Richard Chamberlain and Tab Hunter will be there hawking their bios as well as Michael York, Kenny Miller, and Marjorie Lord. Pushing their autographed pictures will be, among many others, Connie Stevens, George Chakiris, Russ Tamblyn, Leif Garrett, Barry Williams, and straight from the pages of my book Film Fatales, France Nuyen (above).\n\nBut Holy Cow, Batman I am more excited that my faves Yvonne Craig (Batgirl) and Miss Julie Newmar (the Catwoman) will be there also. I’ll be in starlet heaven.\n\nNIGHT ON THE TOWN\n\nFrom my sixties spy girl book, Film Fatales, the still gorgeous BarBara Luna (at right) celebrates the start of the new year with Deborah Gibson at Hugh Hefner’s New Year’s Eve bash at the Playboy Mansion. Check out Luna’s web site for updates on her convention appearances. I have met her a number of times, even saw her cabaret act here in NYC. She is an extremely talented and wonderful lady!\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nHope everyone had a super holiday! I ended 2005 having lunch with former sixties starlet Gail Gerber high up at the Cloisters in upper Manhattan. It was a dreary day, weather-wise, but Gail kept me highly entertained. Gail was spending her New Year’s Eve with pals Rip Torn and Lee Grant. Who would of thunck that the star of Beach Ball and Village of the Giants would have such esteemed friends? Groovy man!"
