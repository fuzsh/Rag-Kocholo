        "text": "Good Soggy Sunday to you. Last week I was so crazy I missed out Sunday chats, but I’m here today to fill you in on what’s happening in our good town, who was spotted, got married, and had a baby. Plus a list of a few events happening tonight and this week. Hope you have a great day, if you want to stay out of the rain and go crazy the Brauhaus Schmitz Oktoberfest at the Armory has two sessions today. Plus they’ll have a screen to catch the Eagles game, but I doubt you’ll be able to hear it starts at 1PM. There’s also the Columbus Day Parade in South Philly, hosted by Alicia Vitarelli, 6ABC with co host duties by the Geater with the Heater, Old City Fest is happening rain or cloudy today, with most of the action being centered at 2nd and Arch Street; Outfest is celebrating Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgendered Question (LGBTQ) pride in the Gayborhood – 13/Walnut/Locust/Spruce streets.\n\n@50cent hosted at 1925 Lounge featuring #EffenVodka with music by @djayeboogie and @djshortywop\n\nMina Say What from Power 99 was in the house\n\nChase Lenfest spotted Nerlens Noel walking on Chestnut Street\n\nDave Warren leaves Fox 29 and takes a job at a Miami CBS station. I was kinda surprised cause the last time I spoke with him he said he was staying in Philly and going into business. But I guess if I had an opportunity to continue in my field and live in Florida, especially before the Winter of 2016/17, that’d be pretty attractive too. I’ll miss you Dave and Alissa.\n\nCongrats to Brittany Ann Cormack, Costume Designer. She’s done costume design for many movies, including Voiceless, which was filmed in Philadelphia. Voiceless is about a young, reserved, war veteran, moves to North East Philadelphia to start an inner city community outreach and puts his life on the line to stand against an abortion clinic that moved across the street from his building. Next up for Brittany Ann working on “Beyond the Rye” with James Caan, Lacey Chabert and Armand Assante.\n\nFriday night I headed to Harp & Crown for the Friends and Family dinner. Delicious, different and delightful are the\n\nwords the describe the new eatery, which opens tomorrow. My favs on the menu, The Prawns, they are plated magnificently, the Farra Pasta is wonderful, I can’t wait to go back for more, the olives, the steak, everything basically. Plus they have a bowling alley in the speakeasy bar in the basement. There’s no password to gain access, just go down there or take the elevator. Harp & Crown, at 1525 Sansom St. (215-330-2800),\n\nOne more day til Jessica Boyington returns to NBC10. People wondered where she was all week on the internet. She was on vacation, and by the looks of her traveling companion a 10 day vacation was beautiful.\n\nCongrats you two\n\nDon’t take your organs with you\n\nA little late, but as gorgeous as ever. Hmm who do you think Killian Robert Gagnon born 10/1/16, looks like? Congrats Katie and Ryan.\n\nHAPPENINGS\n\nThe Post Brothers always put on a good party.\n\nINFO\n\nPresidential City | Leasing Gallery\n\n3900 City\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19131\n\nGood Sunday Morning, yes Sunday. I have been thinking for a bit to add a Sunday column cause I have too much content to fit in 5 days, plus Sunday’s are always good days to catch up on Gossip so when you have Brunch, or dinner with the family you can say did you see so and so got married, pregnant, had a kid or saw Harvey Keitel walkind down the street in Old City.\n\nFriday night I went to Revolutions at Penn Treaty. I toured it Friday, then they told me that that evening would be there “soft opening”, so I went back with Mike. Revolutions is a hip, bowling venue with spots around the county, but here in Philly they’ve partnered with an eatery called Burger & Beers. It’s the prototype, and if successful they’ll roll it out in their next openings. Mike and I really enjoyed our meals (especially my fried pickles and Hotel California Burger) and next time plan to bowl. It’s going to be a huge success. It’s like Dave & Busters, but with bowling, burgers and beer. It’s right next to Punchline and The Fillmore, and across the street from Sugarhouse.\n\nThat same evening The Fillmore had a great act Young The Giant, and the place was packed. My high school friend Jacquie Winner was there, and so was M Night Shyamlan, who stopped for a photo for Rebekah Marine, “The Bionic Model”. She just walked in a few NYFW shows.\n\nHarvey Keitel and wife Daphna Kastner were spotted in Old City by talk show host Quincy Harris last week. Seems Harvey and Daphna were just enjoying the day in our fair City.\n\nLast Monday was the debut of The Q Show on Fox 29, hosted by Quincy Harris. He knocked it out of the park, as I knew he would. Ever since I had meant him about 4 years ago when he left radio as QDeezy, and headed to the airways, I could see that he had a certain flair about him and the way he engaged with people.\n\nPlus the dude has the most incredible Rolodex. Kicking off the show with him last week – The Roots’ Black Thought and Questlove. It doesn’t get any better than that. Tune into The Q Show Monday through Friday NOON on Fox 29. Or Tape it like I do. It’s 30 minutes of fun.\n\nCongrats are in order for the new Mr. & Mrs. Jason Cichonski (Tara Kulesza and Jason Cichonski) who were married Friday night. Chef Jason Cichonski of Ela, The Gaslight and former Top Chef contestant. The couple met through mutual friend Ryan Dorsey, the co-owner of Old City’s Recess Lounge, at a birthday party Dorsey held at Ela where Tara was a guest.\n\nAlfresco dining with drinks at the new Whole Foods in the Art Museum area. Whole Foods is slated to open October 14, I’m looking forward to Indian Summer.\n\nEastern State Penitentiary’s Terror Behind the Walls is now opened for your scream.\n\nNBC10’s Weather gal Sheena Parveen knew it would be a sunny day and chose outside dining at Parc on Friday for her reunion with her friend Taylor Koebeie\n\nDish of the Week\n\nLast week I had dinner at the new eatery Lou Bird’s at 20th and Lombard. The food is delicious, and the deserts divine. I even met the namesake of the restaurant – Lou Bird, who’s the precocious 10 year old of Norris and Debbie Jordan of the Happy Rooster, who also own Lou Bird’s. Lou Bird told me her favorite dish was American Wagyu Strip Fingerling potatoes, brussels sprouts, kim-chimi, which I will definitely get on a return visit. I had the Rainbow Trout, which I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nInfo and Tickets for Philly Fashion Week HERE\n\nPeople are always asking me what events they should attend, sooo starting Wednesday I’m going list 5 – 7 events I think you should attend. I used to have a calendar on PhillyChitChat, but it was too tedious to keep up. This might work as well. I’ll title the columns #PCCBuzz 7 Events of Interest or something like that.\n\nHello, it’s Thursday. The week is almost over. I was so busy this week I didn’t do my normal, or what I’m trying to do normal, Monday gossip/tidbit column. Things are busy, my sister needed some time off so I’m scrambling to do both our jobs. It’ll work out, but if you’re a client and I haven’t posted your event yet, whether here or some where else, know it’s being taken care of and will pop up soon. Also if you’re a client your photos are coming back soon, but feel free to drop me a line. Same thing for the invoices. Those are terribly behind, that’s always bad, but I want to get everything published before I take care of myself. Anyway here’s some fun scoop for you.\n\nWB17 says goodbye:\n\nGood luck to David Grzybowski, yesterday was his last day at PHL17 Eye Opener. I was thrilled to be interviewed by him about Made in America 2 weeks ago. He’s off to another plum assignment, which he will announce very soon. Francesca Ruscio who left PHL17 last month, she’s now on NBC10 doing back up traffic reporter.\n\nSay what? He’s so funny. Chase’s new hotel “The W” at 15th and Chestnut, is looking good. They have several floors up already.\n\nA few answers from his FB Friends:\n\n*******************************************\n\nSuccessful businessman Wayne Kimmel publishes his first book. Even without opening it I can recommend it to you. Download it here. http://www.waynekimmel.com/\n\nA great interview by Lauren Lipton\n\nMeet Irene Baker, and get a signed copy of her newly-released book,”100 Things To Do In Philadelphia Before You Die.” Thursday, September 15, 2016 from 6 – 8 p.m. at McGillin’s Ale House (1310 Drury Street)\n\nSpeaking of cocktails:\n\nThe Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB) will host founder of Skinnygirl® Cocktails and “The Real Housewives of New York City” star Bethenny Frankel on Tuesday, Sept. 20, from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. at the Fine Wine & Good Spirits Premium Collection Store at 1112 Chestnut St. in Philadelphia. Bethenny will meet with fans and sign purchased bottles from her Skinnygirl Cocktails line. There will also be samples of the stuff for those of age waiting in line.\n\nShe’s getting around cause you’ll remember last week I wrote that Bethenny Frankel will host interactive demonstrations showing attendees how to get creative with some of the tasty offerings from Savor King of Prussia restaurants on Sunday, September 25 6-9PM. The demonstrations will be followed by a brief Q&A and autograph session with fans. King of Prussia is proud to match up to $25,000 of the evening sales to Abramson Cancer Center.\n\nPhilly’s chef couple Billy Riddle and Jen Carroll were in town for friend\n\nJackie Baik and Frank Kemp wedding at Waterworks.\n\nTrump talking head, Erin Elmore, supports democratic candidate Kate McGinty against Pa Senator Toomey. Here she’s pictured with hubby Craig Spencer, son Royce and Mayor Kenney at a fundraiser held at the Spitzer/Elmore home on Tuesday.\n\nThis is the craziest photo at the Rocky Statue to date\n\nPhiladelphia resident Angel Dejesus is the lucky winner of Santander’s Bank on Your Eagles Pride Sweepstakes. He receives a pair of tickets to every Eagles regular season home game this season. Dejesus kicked off the 2016 football season by enjoying the game in the Santander Field Club with his girlfriend Brenda Rivera and former Eagles cornerback Bobby Taylor at the Eagles’ season opener on Sunday. Born and raised in Philadelphia, Dejesus has been an avid Eagles fan his entire life. His photo entry for the contest featured him alongside his girlfriend and granddaughter decked out in Eagles gear. He plans to share the tickets with his girlfriend, Brenda Rivera, who told him about the contest and helped him submit his entry.\n\n*********************\n\nOn a sad note, Mark Voci passed away on Sept. 9, 2016 of Havertown formerly of SW Phila. after a long battle with brain cancer. Mark created “Style Me Hired Makeover”, a philanthropic organization that helped women transition from unemployment to employment by giving them makeovers, working with Career Wardrobe and providing them with an outfit for interviews, and connecting them with professionals to help them with their resumes as well as interviewing on the spot with top companies in the area. It was amazing how he put his heart and soul into this project to change lives. He was amazing. Two years ago he was diagnosed with debilitating brain cancer. I’m at a loss for words for this tragedy, but what an amazing legacy he left behind. Bless you Mark and the Voci family. Here’s my coverage on one of the years I was there, I covered it for about three years being introduced to him by Garden Wellington. STYLE ME HIRED\n\nIt’s back to the grind this week. I haven’t shot any events of late, but people are doing busy. It’s Goodbye to Jay McCarroll and Duke & Winston, Plus other People News. The 2012 Pillsbury Bake-Off winner, Christina (Tina) Verrelli, participates in a play about the Bake-Off at the Bucks County Playhouse.\n\nThis week begins NYFW and one fixture you’ll definitely see is Jay McCarroll, especially now that he’s going to be so close to the action. The Project Runway season 1 winner is moving back to NYC to hone his craft and be closer to the action. I’ll miss the low key fashion designer who was always quick with a smile.\n\nAnother heartache good bye to Seun Olubodun, Duke & Winston clothing line featuring tshirts, socks, bow ties and other fun branded clothing. Just when he was contemplating working for someone elses’ brand and grow it as he grew his clothing line, he decided to move the brand out west. I’ve been watching and photographing the Duke & Winston clothing line for the past 8 years, and saw it blow up locally, but with any small business there’s bumps and curves in the row. We don’t always know how to get to the next levels, partnerships fail, ideas fall on deaf ears, and in the end we have to steer our own ship to achieve our goals. Instead of throwing in the shirt, Seun is headed west to see what sunny California holds. One thing for sure, you can wear a TShirt all year long in LA. Take care Duke & Seun.\n\nPhilly is full of fashion entrepreneurs, including Cameron Washington who has created DreamNationTV.com. Check out the trailer for Dapper – Black Men In Fashion.\n\nThe future is looking bright for talented ball player Luke Gutos.\n\nWhen not DJ’ing all over the area, (Don’t ask him to play “Shake It Off”), Jon has been hanging out with his new squeeze Colleen, who just nursing school, as well as his kids.\n\nCongrats Sheila. Last year Sheila wrote a book on Minnie Riperton, this year she’s taking over The Philadelphia Tribune.\n\nFormerly known as The Hive has now become Old City Collective.\n\nChristina (Tina) Verrelli, Devon, Pa (c) was the million dollar Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest winner in 2012 and was she delighted to be a guest of Bucks County Playhouse last Thursday at the new musical “Cake Off” at The Bucks County Playhouse . “Cake Off,”, written by Sheri Wilner, Julia Jordan and Adam Gwon and directed by Gaye Taylor Upchurch.\n\nPhoto: Cast members Justin Guarini, Bucks County Playhouse’s Alex Cast with winner Tina Verrelli in center, Composer Adam Gwon, Rear: Michele Ragusa, AdrianJ. Lawrence, playwright Sheri Wilner.\n\nTickets are available through September 10, 2016 and can be purchased by calling (215) 862-2121 or online at BucksCountyPlayhouse.org.\n\nPhilly Gossip : Shia LaBeouf, Nicki Minaj, Meek Mill, Usher and Stanley Tucci\n\nLast week was a crazy week for PhillyChitChat, I was super busy and didn’t get to my weekly Philly Gossip column, so here it is. Last weekend was a hot, hot, hot celebrity weekend. The Roots Picnic was going on as well as Wizard World, both of which brought lots of celebrities to town like Stanley Tucci, who was in town for Wizard World, who had dinner Friday night at Suga’s which I mentioned last week. Nearby was 6ABC’s Nydia Han who told me her group really wanted to invite him over for dessert. The next evening Tucci watched the sunset from The Logan’s Assembly Lounge, which overlooks the Parkway.\n\nUsher was the headliner for the Root’s Picnic. When he arrived in town he headed to North Philly and got a cheesesteak at Max’s near Germantown Ave.\n\nHe posed for photos, and even sang with a few fans before he headed to Festival Pier for what I hear was an amazing, life changing set.\n\nMeek Mill is a free man after 90 days of house arrest for a probation violation; guess he didn’t realize that is was spring cause he showed up to the Root’s Picnic to celebrate with his bae, Nicki Minaj, in black jeans and sweater.\n\nWhen it got too hot to handle they headed to South Street which sent fans into a frenzy, to pick up a whole new outfit – tshirt, and white jeans, before heading back to the picnic and the rest of the concert.\n\nFans waiting outside Princess on South Street\n\nThe duo was low key all week until Wednesday, when I started getting lots of tips that they were dining at Devon seafood on Rittenhouse Square near midnight. Then the next day this picture popped up on Meek Mill’s Instagram.\n\nFriday Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj flew out of Philly (split the scene). I guess his probation is over. Best wishes for a long time of love.\n\nActor Shia LaBeouf’s latest project has him traveling across the country using his Twitter coordinates.\n\nThe project is called “Take Me Anywhere.” He teamed up with Vice News, the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art and the Finnish Institute in London.\n\nLaBeouf and two artists use their GPS coordinates broadcast via Twitter to allow random strangers to pick them up and take them anywhere, all in the name of art.\n\n#TAKEMEANYWHERE by LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner (2016) Commissioned by Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art as part of MediaLive 2016, and The Finnish Institute in London. Project supported by Frame Contemporary Art Finland and Vice. Site programming by Citrusbits.\n\nThe project began on May 23 and is expected to last until June 23. Last night his adventure (and Keily Cloude) brought him to Philadelphia from New Castle, Indiana.\n\n‏@thecampaignbook #TAKEMEANYWHERE 39°56’01″N 75°09’32″W (Coordinates for Philly)\n\nGood Philly Gossip Monday. Hope you had a great weekend despite this horrible weather. Congrats to so many Philadelphian’s that ran and conquered the Broad Street Run.\n\nSheena Parveen and Mikey Ilagan at the Broad Street Run\n\nIt was exciting to see how many people in my timeline posted photos from the race, their medals, and bibs.\n\nWill Smith and super fan Kevin outside the Ritz last week.\n\nI was chatting a lot about Will Smith being in town last week; He was checking out the Residences at Ritz Carlton on Monday with realtors, while staying at the Ritz hotel next door. He used the Residences at Ritz Carlton gym everyday, seemed to enjoy the 2PM workout time. Friday he ran into Bad Boy co-star Martin Lawrence who was in town to perform at Temple that evening. No word on what they discussed, but my friend who reads lips said it seemed they were chatting about a Bad Boy sequel. I bet he was telling Martin that Philly will be seeing more of him, and hopefully Jada Smith, as they are now the majority owners of the Sixers.\n\nMartin Lawrence at Temple University\n\nYes it’s true #bcbgmaxazria closed on April 24 at 16th and Walnut. The sign on the door says visit them at their KOP or Cherry Hill Mall store.\n\nIt’s been fun following along with Kharisma MCllwaine and her brother Aloysius on their trip to Morocco via snapchat, which I’m trying to learn.\n\nSeriously, if anyone was going to meet the new quarterback, Carson Wentz, first it was going to be Melissa Leonard. Here she is at the meet and greet press conference, as well as season owners of boxes.\n\nFriday was a very special day for the Good Day Philadelphia Crew as they celebrated their 20 years on air with their loyal fans. Everyone turned up, chatted with viewers and posed for countless selfies.\n\nBefore the event though Mike Jerrick headed to St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children, where they had a prom for the kids. So sweet. Then he headed to the party at Sugarhouse.\n\nAfter the 20th Anniversary Party, my friend Alex Holley, FOX 29 co-host of “Good Day Philadelphia,” was honored Friday night at the 7th annual 2016 NV Movers & Shakers Soiree in NYC. Love her.\n\nThen Saturday night Mike Jerrick headed to DC to attend the White House Correspondents Dinner.\n\nI wonder if he ran into Mike’s cousin David Nakamura (Washington Post White House correspondent), here with his wife Kris Schenck\n\nI was so busy this weekend – Thursday I was at the Fairmount Conservacy Gala, Friday night I attended the premiere of Inis Nua Theater’s The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning, (April 27-May 15) Saturday I was at Cure Duchenne Blingo at The Logan Hotel and Sunday I had a delicious brunch at Little Lion with Kory Aversa and Brooke Thomas, the new morning anchor at CBS3. Then headed to Savino Thorne’s baptism.\n\nCheck out more PhillyGossip everyday on my twitter account @iPhillyChitChat , Instagram and on my FB page PhillyChitChat\n\nand I’ll be back here on Thursday\n\nGood Friday afternoon, how about a little Philly Gossip. Hope you had a great weekend. So much going on. I’m getting my first wordpress lesson today so hopefully I can figure out how to put these instragram and social media photos in with links so you can go right to these pages. Otherwise if you see something you like just google their names and their social media will come up.\n\nCeleb sightings I tweeted about this week. Seems Will Smith was in town. He was staying at the Ritz Carlton hotel but using the The Residences at the Ritz Carlton Gym. He was also spotted with a real estate agent at the Residences. Maybe that penthouse is finally going to be sold.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton was seen strolling through the Sonesta Hotel’s lobby after he had spent Primary night there. My mom stayed there last weekend too. That hotel has gotten so hot since it’s been rebranded, and refreshed. In June look for Ruth Chris steakhouse to open. 50Cent was in town on Monday to sign bottles of his booze EFFEN at the state store in Northern Liberties. He must have spent the weekend here cause Saturday night he was spotted at Coda.\n\nMonday night Chelsea Clinton was at Coda pimping for her mom Hillary Clinton (who stayed at the Sheraton Hotel the night before Primary Night), who was doing a MSNBC Town Hall Meeting at the Constitution Center (BTW that was taped. I guess it didn’t say so during the show. After I wrote my column on Bernie and his meltdown cause Hillary was still taping when he arrived for his segment, people were saying but Bernie was on stage first. I had noted that Clinton taped from 530 to 630pm, but was still on stage at 7PM, but I guess those readers didn’t realize that was 2 hrs before the show aired. )OK now that that’s cleared up, here’s what’s happening in the neighborhood.\n\nCongrats City Rep Sheila Hess for your story being published in Philly Current Mag\n\nSo nice Yo Yo Ma posed with unsung hero Jim Sweeney who has worked backstage with the Phila Orchestra for 25 years\n\nHappy 50th Birthday Christopher Barlett, the unsung hero of Philly’s LGBTQ community service – The William Way Center. With him is Ernest Owens, Metro Philly columnist as well as GPhilly editor. He’s had quite a week himself as a shot of him at a Hillary Clinton rally appeared on NYTimes.com\n\nPerusing Instagram I came across this very interesting photo by Tismfu of 17th and Walnut. You can tell he’s a visitor cause he called it Walnut and 17th, natives usually put the number first.\n\nCongrats to Mark Marek and Dilara Deger on their wedding yesterday. Mark owns the popular Rumor nightclub (Say hi to Teefish at the door when you’re there) and the sexy, speakeasy lounge 1925 (formerly G Lounge).\n\nCongrats to Sue Daugherty, executive director of MANNA and her girlfriend Meg Paszko on their nuptials.\n\nHappy Spring Awakenings to Stratus Lounge who had celebrity spinner Sam Ronson on hand, who shared time with DJ Royale keeping the dance floor packed.\n\nCongrats to Sara Campbell who opened her new boutique in Chestnut Hill at 8409 Germantown Ave Philadelphia, PA .\n\nHere’s a list of a few happenings you might be interested in.\n\nRittenhouse Row Spring Festival Preview Party\n\nTONIGHT\n\nBernie Robbins Marco Bicego appearance\n\nMother’s Day at Parx Casino\n\nGood Wednesday, if this Philly Gossip entry looks somewhat familiar it is. I posted this originally on Monday, but then my site switch over to the new site, which your’re looking at right now. This entry started getting a lot of hits so I need to repost it. This is going to happen alot this week as I have to repost entries of interest that I want captured on my new, refreshed site.\n\nTiffani Thiessen aka Kelly Kapowski on NBC’s Saved by the Bell and as Valerie Malone on Fox’s Beverly Hills, 90210. These days Tiffani has a cooking show on the Cooking Network called appropriately “Dinner at Tiffani’s” which airs at 8PM on Sundays. She was in town making an appearance at the Sweet Paul Makerie creative retreat which was held at the Navy Yard in URBAN over the weekend.\n\nIn between the meets, greets and demonstrations, Tiffani spent a lot of time dining at Mike Solomonov eateries. Friday night she had dinner at Zahav, Sunday before leaving town she grabbed some grub at Dizengoff and dessert at Federal Donuts. I’d say there’s a segment at Dinner’s at Tiffani’s in Mike Solo’s career.\n\nFriday night my phone was blowing up for another reason too, seems Jesse McCartney was in town and his fans wanted to know. Nothing was on the radar ie Social Media which led me to piece the story together, but then Saturday night Jesse stepped out to grab dinner from Steve’s at 16th and Chestnut. He was kind enough to pose with a few fans inside one of Philly’s famed must have cheesesteak places.\n\nSunday, shots of Jesse began showing up from Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa. Philly was just being used as a base for Jesse, as it was only 2 hrs away from his Sunday gig, and Philly being what it is, is better to sleep over.\n\nIan Michael Crumm and his bestie, budding songstress Hannah Krupa had an awesome time at Cochella this past weekend, partying with lots of stars including Kyle Jenner. Next up for Ian, he’s headed to the Tribeca Film Festival Thursday night. Follow him on Snap Chat to be a fly on the wall. Check back on Friday for more Philly Gossip."
