        "text": "Bradley Cooper will shoot a movie in his hometown. Though official word is not out, public records filed in Harrisburg tell the story.\n\nOn Jan. 22, the Department of State registered Dark Fields Productions L.L.C. That matches the title of a thriller - based on an Alan Glynn book - that the hot Rydal-bred actor has been lined up to star in since November.\n\nDark Fields' protagonist is a writer who takes a top-secret drug that makes him smarter - for good and for bad.\n\nBased on the date of the registration, necessary to obtain Pennsylvania film tax credits, shooting is about two months away. A rep from Universal Studios did not return a request for confirmation.\n\nIn other film news, a crew of Philadelphians has just returned from the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, where the group ran an industry lounge for networking in the hope of luring more work east. (See details and photos at http://go.philly.com/sundance) The King of Prussia-shot drama Blue Valentine, starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, was sold to the Harvey Weinstein Co., and the Philly-shot drama Night Catches Us, from first-time director Tanya Hamilton, won plaudits for its depiction of 1976 Philly and for its soundtrack, featuring The Roots.\n\nMusical benefit\n\nA band of philanthropic Philadelphians is trying to help a girl from the Netherlands get possibly lifesaving treatment at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. In June at age 11, Hannah Max - daughter of musicians in the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra - learned she had Stage IV neuroblastoma. Dutch authorities have not agreed to treatment that has received tentative approval from the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nChildren's Hospital, where John Maris could treat her, has told parents Randy Max and Rachel Browne that the bill would exceed $400,000.\n\nThe Philharmonic will appear in New York next month. Local arts patron Lee Shlifer - tipped by restaurateurs Marc Vetri and Jeff Benjamin, who had been alerted to the plight by Philadelphia Daily News columnist Ronnie Polaneczky - arranged for several ensembles within the Philharmonic to perform a benefit concert at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts on Feb. 18, their day off. Vetri and Jimmy Duffy Caterers will feed the patrons at the $250-a-person plate event (www.vetrifoundation.org). There's a further piece of intrigue for Philadelphians: The Philharmonic's young maestro, Yannick Nezet-Seguin, is on the short list for music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra.\n\nCommercially speaking\n\nMost advertisers choose generic background images to avoid the appearance of endorsement or partnership. But a TV commercial for a law firm airing last week showed a school bus emblazoned with \"Upper Darby School District\" while dramatizing the impact of a missed cancer diagnosis on a family. District spokeswoman Dana Spino said the district had been made aware of the ad and had no further comment, pending a review by the district's solicitor. In a statement Friday, lawyer Dean Weitzman of MyPhillyLawyer.com called the outcry \"so ridiculous, it's insulting,\" and said he had the ad changed to remove the name.\n\nSports notes\n\nReality-TV starlet Khloe Kardashian and Lakers forward Lamar Odom, rolling here for Friday's game against the 76ers, stopped at Buddakan in Old City for a late dinner Thursday: a pitcher of the restaurant's \"Zengria,\" glasses of Veuve Clicquot, steamed edamame, shrimp spring rolls, grilled octopus, cashew chicken, sizzling whole fish, and lobster fried rice. Only one fan interrupted with a pleasant hello.\n\nPhillies radio broadcaster Scott Franzke and his wife, Lori, director of individual giving at the Philadelphia Zoo, are expecting their first child in May.\n\nActor Terrence Howard and friends were spotted two days last week on skates at Simons Ice Rink in West Oak Lane.\n\nMedia activity\n\nBuzz Bissinger, writing a monthly column for The Inquirer between assignments for Vanity Fair, will start a two-hour talk show tonight at 10 on WPHT-AM (1210). Better keep a hand on the volume control. \"I have a tendency to go off,\" says Bissinger, with uncharacteristic understatement. \"I plan to treat [callers] with respect unless they drive you nuts,\" he adds, saying he considers WPHT morning man Michael Smerconish a model of restraint. Bissinger's next show has not been scheduled.\n\nFrom L.A. comes word that CBS3 alumna Alycia Lane is about to be promoted to coanchor of the morning news at the NBC station. She started there in August and has been reporting and anchoring weekends. Her beau, Chris Booker, has a radio job there.\n\nMusically noted\n\nSinger-songwriter Jake Snider, a freshman at Columbia and grandson of Comcast-Spectacor chief Ed Snider, is donating 10 percent of the proceeds from his self-titled debut album, available on CDBaby.com, to the American Red Cross and Mercy Corps for Haiti relief. Besides Ben Berry, Jeff Berman, Emily Bach, and his brother Cary Snider, his players included Eric Bazilian of The Hooters. Four tracks have gotten airtime on WXPN-FM (88.5).\n\nUncle Pirate, a children's book written by Douglas Rees and illustrated by Inquirer editorial columnist Tony Auth, has been adapted for the stage. It's at Vital Theatre, Broadway and 76th Street in Manhattan, through Feb. 18. A sequel, Uncle Pirate to the Rescue, will be published soon."
