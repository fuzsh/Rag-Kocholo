        "text": "Well yonks after buying the thing I finally sat down with Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea. Liked it. Quite a bit of Thom Yorke, which I was not expecting. Obviously a pretty personal record, and it really hits home along with the music and production courtesy of Mick Harvey and Rob Ellis. Fav tracks were A Place Called Home, This Mess We're In, You Said Something, Horses in My Dreams and We Float.\n\nI am never going to forgive Travis for not taking me to see them at a free show they did here about 3 months back. I kept saying they're going to be great, but noooooo.\n\nAnd now all of their shows sell out in like a second.\n\nI do actually feel a sense of validation when people on here share my thoughts, since this place is such a massive part of my music taste, so that makes me happy.\n\nJust to bring it back around to friggin Cobbler though... the first PJ Harvey record I ever listened to was Let England Shake and I found it totally impenetrable and haven't been back to her music since, until tonight.\n\nReally? Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for WWI literature, but I found Let England Shake (my first) immediately accessible, and the rest of her work pretty hard to get into. I don't like the production of Rid of Me at all, it sinks the songs behind a wall of noise.\n\nDry has a much better sound and songwriting than Rid of Me in my mind.\n\nOne of her favourite records is Surfer Rosa and she tried to replicate that amazing sound with Albini... and I don't think it really worked.\n\nDo Simply Red have any other songs as good as Fairground? Aside from the chorus, which I love dearly, I'm also quite fond of the light house music in the verses. Feels made to have been exploited by DJs in the late 80s. So do they have an album or compilation worth hearing? I worry that the rest might be pure cheese.\n\nEvery other thing I've heard by Simply Red I have hated. I mean...it's the purest corn. The worst part was that Last.fm seemed to think that by listening to one album and Fairground a number of times, that I must LOVE Simply Red. So, back when Last.fm was actually a useful music radio website that I subscribed to, at least once every hour or so it would play me something from Simply Red. It doesn't sound like that often, but when you consider that I simply don't like Simply Red, it didn't really work out so well.\n\nDo Simply Red have any other songs as good as Fairground?

So do they have an album or compilation worth hearing? I worry that the rest might be pure cheese.\n\nI liked their cover of If You Don't Know Me By now, although it's not like it's better than the original or anything.\n\nPJ has one of the most consistent discographies out there.\n\nAgreed.\n\nI assumed every U2 fan liked Stories From the City/Sea. I recall there being an article trying to sell it to everyone in one of the last issues of Propaganda. It was pretty widely loved here when it released.\n\nYou say that like U2 fans are a bunch of sheep or something.\n\nOh, wait...\n\nI didn't mean it as a bad thing, just that there were some strong ties. It's a great album, I still listen to tracks from it.\n\nYeah, I was not trying to exclude anyone, sorry, I just know Laz and I both rank it as one of the best albums of that decade.\n\nThe thing is, I don't see how it could possibly get any better. But if it does I'm damn happy to be able to see it.\n\nSeason 2 dips for the first half of the season, but I really dug it by the end. 3-4 are classic, I'm only two episodes into 5 but they both felt like fan fiction. I'll keep it at it.\n\nThe thing is, I don't see how it could possibly get any better. But if it does I'm damn happy to be able to see it.\n\nI mean, everyone and their Mother will tell you why whatever season they love is the \"best\". They're all great, for their own reasons.\n\nMy personal favorite is Season 4, the final episode of that season knocked me on my ass, just left me feeling very....I don't even know how to explain it.\n\nThis is a knee-jerk reaction, but season 1 might be the best stand-alone season of TV I've seen. Tight, focused, intense, with great character development on both sides of the aisle and excellent pacing. I don't think anything can knock Mad Men off the perch for best series, simply because the themes were tailor-made for me, but I really look forward to where The Wire is going.\n\nThis is a knee-jerk reaction, but season 1 might be the best stand-alone season of TV I've seen.
