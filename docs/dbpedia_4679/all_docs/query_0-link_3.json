Even if all the recording is done, the mixing, the production blah blah blah.....then, you have to do artwork and begin the usual media/promotion circus.\n\nYeah, it takes a minimum of three months (and that's pushing it)after the last day of recording to mix and master the album and prepare for release. But I don't really buy the mid year release anyhow. July is the date for the three remasters. I don't think U2 is going to compete against itself. I believe the orginal mentionings of October (which means we could see U2 in and out of the studio until July)...Of course I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it.\n\nThe_Edge89 said:\n\nOver?! I was this close!\n\nWas there really a point in posting the u2.com report then if this is true? \"No word on how the music is developing from last year's songwriting sessions...\" and two days later they're freaking done? I'm pretty confused...\n\nNumb1075 has a point though. I think Steve Averill mentioned before, that the packaging/sleeve design etc takes at least six months to finish or am I imagining things? Gah, I don't know...\n\nHmm They had wrapped up 4 weeks ago and were back in the studio, then they wrapped up again 2 weeks ago, and were back in the studio\n\nMaybe it is a ruse like last time\n\nThe_Edge89 said:\n\nOver?! I was this close!\n\nWas there really a point in posting the u2.com report then if this is true? \"No word on how the music is developing from last year's songwriting sessions...\" and two days later they're freaking done?

Gah, I don't know...\n\nKeep in mind different rumours are around, and the band have NOT said the recording is over. Could be U2tour.de and that post on atu2.com got it wrong, or that they simply refer to Larry's drum tech (who said the session at HQ were over, and that the band will record in a warmer place)."
