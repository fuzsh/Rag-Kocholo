        "text": "Everyone has one. Most people can tell you theirs without thinking. And even if you don’t know what yours is, it’s out there somewhere, waiting for you.\n\nWe’re talking about walk-up music — you know, the 10-to-15 seconds of a song that serves as an introduction for a baseball player walking up to bat. And there’s an art to picking the perfect one.\n\nFirst, the song must put you, the batter, in the zone. Second, the song should fire up the home crowd, like when Phillies’ second baseman Bryson Stott steps up to Tai Verdes’ “A-O-K.” And finally, if at all possible, it should strike fear into your opponent.\n\n» READ MORE: Quiz: Can you guess what these famous Philadelphians picked as their walk-up song?\n\nAccomplish one of the three, and you’re off to a good start.
