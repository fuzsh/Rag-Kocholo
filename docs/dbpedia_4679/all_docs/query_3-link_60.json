        "text": "'Paruthiveeran' director Ameer is an irrepleacable actor in Suriya-starrer 'Vaadi Vaasal', said Vetri Maaran on X (formerly Twitter). This comes at a time when Ameer and producer KE Gnanavel Raja are at loggerheards over the financial and legal issues related to 'Paruthiveeran'. Vetri Maaran, through the X page of his production house, shared this statement about Ameer not being replaced in 'Vaadi Vaasal'.\n\nVETRI MAARAN SAYS AMEER IS IRREPLACEABLE IN 'VAADI VAASAL'\n\n'Asuran' and 'Vada Chennai' director Vetri Maaran is currently working on 'Viduthalai 2'. After this project, he will begin shooting for Suriya's 'Vaadi Vaasal'. Earlier, it was revealed that Ameer will play a role in the film.\n\nOn November 28, Vetri Maaran's production house, Grass Root Film Co, shared a photo of Ameer and himself dicusssing the project. He wrote, \"Director #VetriMaaran met Director #Ameer to discuss his role in #Vaadivaasal. The prominence of his role in the script has increased during the writing process and is tailor made for Director #Ameer. He is irreplaceable as an actor in the film (sic).\"\n\nHere's the post:\n\nKarthi, brother of Suriya and son of Sivakumar, made his debut in 2007 with 'Paruthiveeran', which won several awards. Years later, director Ameer and producer Gnanavel Raja are blaming each other for the film's budgeting issues.\n\nFollowing the controversy, Ameer issued a statement saying that Gnanavel wasnâ€™t involved throughout the film after the budget shot up and he had to borrow money from many to finish the film and release it.\n\nThe issue snowballed into a huge controversy when Karthi thanked Gnanavel and Suriya for the release of 'Paruthiveeran' at the audio launch of his 25th film, 'Japan'. Many filmmakers who shaped Karthi's career in the industry attended the event. However, Ameer, who introduced him, was absent.\n\nLater, Ameer revealed that he wasn't invited to the event properly and hence he did not attend. This became a topic of discussion with Ameer and Gananvel Raja giving interviews levelling allegations against each other.\n\nRecently, Samuthirakani, Sasikumar and Sneha expressed their solidarity with Ameer. Now, Vetri Maaran's statement is seen as a support for Ameer.\n\nWhile a legal case regarding 'Paruthiveeran' issue is underway, Suriya and Karthi are yet to release any statement."
