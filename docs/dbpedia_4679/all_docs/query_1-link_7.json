        "text": "It feels like the last 45 years have been a blur. The radio bug got ahold of me in 1967 when I was 16. My best friend, Joe Sestito, and I used to listen to two hit radio stations in Rochester, NY...WBBF and WSAY. We were a DJ's worst nightmare because we used to call the jocks on the air all the freakin' time to request song after song. And if that wasn't obnoxious enough, Joe and I used to comprise our own 'Top 10 Of The Week' on index cards. We were card-carrying RADIO GEEKS with no girlfriends.\n\nAt the age of 17, I made a firm decision that my goal was to be a radio personality, and to make that happen, I told my mom I was setting my sights on Ithaca College, which had, and still has, one of the best Radio/TV Majors in the country but, some issues came up. Let me tell you my story, but first, take a peek at 'The Ethan and Lou 10th Anniversary Slideshow' accompanied by a tune titled \"Brand New View,\" written and performed by my son, Ethan James."
