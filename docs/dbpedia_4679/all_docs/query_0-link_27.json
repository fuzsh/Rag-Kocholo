        "meta_description": "Purpose The aim of the study was to investigate the components of day-to-day variability of repeated phase contrast mapping (PCM) magnetic resonance imaging measurements of global cerebral blood flow (gCBF).   Materials and methods Two dataset were analyzed. In Dataset 1 duplicated PCM measurements of total brain flow were performed in 11 healthy young volunteers on two separate days applying a strictly standardized setup. For comparison PCM measurements obtained from a previously published study (Dataset 2) were analyzed in order to assess long-term variability in an aged population in a less strictly controlled setup. Global CBF was calculated by normalizing total brain flow to brain volume. On each day measurements of hemoglobin, caffeine and glucose were obtained. Linear mixed models were applied to estimate coefficients of variation (CV) of total (CVt), between-subject (CVb), within-subject day-to-day (CVw), and intra-session residual variability (CVr).   Results In Dataset 1 CVt, CVb, CVw and CVr were estimated to be 11%, 9.4%, 4% and 4.2%, respectively, and to 8.8%, 7.2%, 2.7% and 4.3%, respectively, when adjusting for hemoglobin and plasma caffeine. In Dataset 2 CVt, CVb and CVw were estimated to be 25.4%, 19.2%, and 15.0%, respectively, and decreased to 16.6%, 8.2% and 12.5%, respectively, when adjusting for the same covariates.   Discussion Our results suggest that short-term day-to-day variability of gCBF is relatively low compared to between-subject variability when studied in standardized conditions, whereas long-term variability in an aged population appears to be much larger when studied in less a standardized setup. The results further showed that from 20% to 35% of the total variability in gCBF can be attributed to the effects of hemoglobin and caffeine.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nKnowledge on the normal variability of cerebral perfusion measurements is crucial when planning and designing studies involving such measurements, and is also important when interpreting studies addressing cerebral perfusion. In order to understand the sources of variability of serial gCBF measurements in more details, we analyzed repeated PCM measurements in healthy volunteers obtained on two separate days. The main findings are that short-term day-to-day variability assessed under strictly controlled conditions in a homogenous population in whom low variability is expected, was found to be small and in the same range as residual intra-session variability. In contrast, long-term variability is much higher when studied in an aged population under less standardized conditions. We also found that from 20% to 35% of the total variability of short-term repeated gCBF measurements can be attributed to important covariates mainly influencing between-subject variability.\n\nThe mean and range of both total brain flow and gCBF measurements were similar to those previously reported in studies of young and aged subjects using PCM MRI [7, 18–20]. The mean CBF value in young males (Dataset 1) of 63.4 ml/100ml/min corresponds to 60.4 ml/100g/min when assuming a brain tissue density of 1.05 g/ml [21] which is somewhat higher than the classical text book value of 50 ml/100g/min derived from other techniques [22]. This overestimation is probably related to partial volume effects due to the low resolution of PCM relative to vessel size resulting in overestimation of flow in smaller vessel, in particular in vertebral and basilar arteries [23, 24]. Also, small systematic error may result depending on the level of PCM measurements as flow intended for small extracerebral branches is included when measuring at the level of vertebral arteries (as in Dataset 1), whereas cerebellar braches from the vertebral arteries is not included when measuring at the level of the basilar artery (as in Dataset 2). In the aged population (Dataset 2) we found a mean gCBF of 50.5 ml/100 ml/min (or 48.1 ml/100g/min) which is very similar to the value of 51.2 ml/100ml/min previously reported in a large aged, mixed gender population [20]. The lower gCBF values found in aged subjects compared to younger subjects is thus in agreement with previous publications applying PCM and probably reflects mainly a true age related gCBF decline also reported using a range other techniques [12, 25, 26] and in lesser degree methodological bias.\n\nIn terms of intra-session repeatability our results are also in agreement with previous studies [7, 19, 27] confirming excellent intra-session repeatability. As expected, the repeatability between days tended to be poorer compared to sequential same day measurements. Previous studies on PCM day-to-day repeatability have not included duplicate measurements [19, 28], and accordingly could not separate methodological imprecision from true variability. One study of MRI measurements of CMRO2 including duplicate PCM measurements performed at five sessions within a two week period reported intra-session and inter-session and inter-subject CV of gCBF to 2.8%, 7.5% and 17.4%, respectively [29]. Due to differences in the calculation of CV, these CV values cannot be compared directly with those reported in the present study.\n\nThe present study aimed to quantify true day-to-day variability. In Dataset 1 we found that for short-term repeated measurements this component to be relatively small compared not only to between-subject variability, but also at the same level or slightly lower than the residual intra-session variability. This finding suggests that resting gCBF is relatively constant over time when examined in standardized conditions in a homogenous population with expected low within-subject variability. From Dataset 2 it appears that even when taking important physiological covariates and method imprecision into account, long-term variability estimated in an aged and more heterogeneous population, and applying a less strictly controlled experimental setup, is as expected much higher compared to short-term day-to-day variability. The higher CVw in Dataset 2 may be attributed to a number of factors. Notably, as shown in Fig 2D large gCBF changes >20 ml/100ml/min were observed in three participants suggesting that the higher variability may partially be attributed to large single subject changes related to hormonal [11] or other factors not accounted for in the present analysis. Other potential sources related to the applied techniques, study design and the effects of caffeine are addressed below.\n\nThe residual intra-session variability (CVr) was as expected lower than between subject variability (CVb). The unadjusted gCBF CVb of 9.4% in the Dataset 1 is lower than the values estimated from Dataset 2 including both males and females, whereas it is only slightly lower than the value of 11.6% reported in a recent study also including only young males [24]. Also the CVr of 4% is lower than the values of 7.1% in ref. [7] and of 6.5% reported previously [24]. The lower residual variability is most likely due to the longer acquisition time of the PCM measurements in the present study. Further, it should be noted that in Dataset 2, measurements were performed at the level the basilar artery which may be less straight and less parallel to the ICAs and thus compromise both accuracy and precision.\n\nVariable planning may influence day-to-day variability. In Dataset 1, a screen dump of planning from day 1 was available when planning PCM on day 2, whereas in Dataset 2 planning was based on the general criteria used in our laboratory. A recent study suggested that applying an automatic PCM planning algorithm may reduce residual variability compared to manual planning [28] and could be of particular value in studies involving repeated PCM measurements. It is thus possible that more variable planning may have contributed to the higher CVw in Dataset 2 compared to Dataset 1.\n\nCaffeine withdrawal can increase gCBF and caffeine intake can decrease gCBF [17, 30]; effects that may depends on daily caffeine intake suggesting that cerebral perfusion is adapted to habitual caffeine levels. Therefore, instructing study participants to abstain from their habitual caffeine intake is actually an intervention that might influence the measurements [17, 31]. Both in Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 day-to-day variability (CVw) decreased only slightly when including caffeine in the model. As suggested by Fig 3, caffeine abstinence (Dataset 1) appears to effectively reduce plasma caffeine day-to-day variability and associated gCBF changes compared to the spontaneous caffeinated state (Dataset 2), although the association of plasma caffeine change with gCBF change was not significant. It is also remarkable that even if participants were asked to abstain from caffeine before the experiment, plasma caffeine levels up to 10 μmol/l were observed. Whether this reflects lack of compliance or variable metabolism is not clear, but similar observations have been made in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion imaging [32].\n\nAlso in agreement with previous studies, we found hemoglobin to an important determinant of cerebral perfusion [14]. With increasing hemoglobin levels, lower gCBF is required to maintain a constant cerebral oxygen delivery (and vice versa). Adjusting for hemoglobin did not reduce residual intra-session variability as hemoglobin was relatively constant. However, in other studies involving interventions that might change hemoglobin or when larger within variability could be expected, e.g. repeated measurements in pre-menopausal women, adjusting for hemoglobin would be relevant.\n\nThe present study has some limitations. First of all, sample size in Dataset 1 was relatively small, and in order to minimize the possible gender and age related effects on gCBF [26, 33] we included only young healthy males. For comparison we therefor also included data from a previous study in order to assess the estimates of variability in a dataset where larger variability is expected. Although applying very similar methods in Dataset 1 and Dataset 2, smaller differences related to imaging techniques, participants and in study design prohibit direct pooling of data. Accordingly, it cannot be determined if the larger day-to-day variability in Dataset 2 compared to Dataset 1 is related to the longer interval between study days per se or to other factors such as the population studied or factors related to the study design and the applied techniques.\n\nSecondly, it would have been of interest to include measurement of arterial partial pressure of CO2. Spontaneous variations in end-tidal PCO2 have been shown to induce in particular intra-subjects gCBF changes in the order of 10–15% per kPa [33, 34]. Data from previous studies from our laboratory [24, 33] shows day-to-day changes in arterial or end-tidal PCO2 within ±0.4 kPa corresponding to maximum day-to-day gCBF changes of 4–6%. Assessment of arterial PCO2 may obtained by either arterial cannulation or capnography through a closed breathing system, neither of which were considered practical in the experimental setup or generally performed in MRI studies of cerebral perfusion.\n\nAn important limitation to the analysis of Dataset 2 is that we derived CVr from another population. It would have been optimal if CVr in Dataset 2 had been determined in the same population using a design similar to that of Dataset 1. As the imaging protocols and setup in ref [7] and in Dataset 2 were very similar, we used the CVr from [7] to estimate CVw in Dataset 2 assuming that CVr would be similar. We cannot know if this assumption holds true, but we believe that the differences in data acquisition in [7] and Dataset 2 are minor and it is unlikely that true CVr in Dataset 2 differs from that in ref [7] to an extend that would alter the main finding of a much larger CVw in Dataset 2 than in Dataset 1.\n\nWe believe that the findings of the present study can provide researchers with valuable information for planning futures studies involving gCBF measurements. Using the variance estimates from the Dataset 1, a power calculation shows that in order to detect a 10% difference in gCBF between two groups, a sample size of 21 in each group is required. Performing duplicate measurements and including covariates reduces sample size to 17 and 14, respectively. For within-subject changes, adding duplicate measurements reduces sample size from 8 to 6 in order to detect a 10% change, and adding covariates further reduces the required sample size to 5 subjects. The analyses, however, do also suggest that such low temporal variability may only be achieved when studying a homogenous population under strictly controlled conditions, and that the estimated temporal variability cannot be applied to more heterogeneous populations studied in less well controlled conditions, e.g. large population based studies [2, 20] or studies of aging involving repeated measurements at different time points [2, 35].\n\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that the contribution of short-term day-to-day variability to total variability is relatively small compared to between-subject variability of repeated gCBF measurements when performed close in time and under standardized conditions. The study also shows that a substantial fraction of the total variability can be attributed to the effects of easily obtained covariates predominantly by reducing between subject variability. By including covariates and performing duplicate measurements, the ability to detect temporal changes in gCBF may be improved in future studies."
