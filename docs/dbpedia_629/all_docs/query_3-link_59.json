        "text": "THE STAR-LING. 1. THERE was a man once, who kept a star-ling in his house. 2. This star-ling was a very pretty bird, that had been taught to speak. 3. When the man said, \"Star-ling, where are you?\" it would say, \"Here I am.\" 4. Little Frank, a boy who lived near, oft-en went to see this man. 5. He was very much pleased with the bird. He loved to hear it talk. 6. One day, when Frank went to see it, the man was not at home 7. Frank saw the bird, and thought how eas-y it would be to take it. 8. He thought, if he took it, no one would know it, and it would be his bird. 9. So Frank took the star-ling, and put it in his pock-et. 10. He was just sneak-ing a-way, when the man came home. 11. The man thought he would please Frank by mak-ing it talk. 12. He did not look to see where it was, but thought it was in the room. 13. So he said, in a loud voice, \"Star-ling, where are you?\" 14. And the bird, in Frank's pock-et, cried, as loud as it could, \"Here I am.\" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ EXERCISES.-What did the man keep? What would the man say to it? What would the starling reply? Who often visited the man? What did Frank think and do, one day, when the man was gone? What happened then? Why should we always be honest?"
