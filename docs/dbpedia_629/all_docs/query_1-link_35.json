For specific question, please contact us directly via Ask-A-Librarian.\n\nExpand All Collections | Collapse All Collections\n\nAccademia Della Crusca Collection\n\nItalian-language publications representing the best usage of Italian in the humanities and sciences.\n\nThe Academy's purpose was to bring scholars and experts in Italian linguistics and philology. It was founded in Florence in 1583 by Antonio Francesco Grazzin with the mission to maintain the \"purity\" of the original Italian language. In 1612 the Academy published the first edition of the Dictionary of the Italian Language, which also served as a model for subsequent dictionaries in French, Spanish, German and English. 1,134 titles are dispersed throughout the Rare Book and Special Collection Division. See Accademia della Crusca Collection for details.\n\nAfrican American Pamphlet Collection, 1822-1909.\n\nThe African-American Pamphlet Collection, 1822-1909 presents 396 pamphlets from the Rare Book and Special Collections Division, published from 1822 through 1909, by African-American authors and others who wrote about slavery, African colonization, Emancipation, Reconstruction, and related topics. The materials range from personal accounts and public orations to organizational reports and legislative speeches. Among the authors represented are Frederick Douglass, Kelly Miller, Charles Sumner, Mary Church Terrell, and Booker T. Washington. This collection is fully digitized and is available with other topically related items in African American Perspectives\n\nAmerican Almanacs, Seventeenth through Nineteenth Centuries.\n\nThe earliest American almanacs in the Library of Congress have been brought together as a collection in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division. Represented are imprints from at least thirty-five states and the District of Columbia, including the only known copy of Kikinawadendamoiwemin, a Chippewa almanac for the year 1834 which is probably the first book printed in the state of Wisconsin. The collection is strongest in eighteenth and nineteenth century material and contains all the editions of Poor Richard's Almanac, issued after 1735 and many examples by Nathaniel Ames, Samuel Clough, Nathaniel Low, John Tulley, and Nathaniel Whittemore. Some almanacs have been annotated. There are 3,896 titles in the collection.\n\nSupporting Resources\n\nCatalog Record: Hugh Alexander Morrison's Preliminary Check List of American Almanacs,1639-1800 is based largely on the collection\n\nAmerican Imprints: Books and pamphlets printed in the United States between 1640 and 1800, (16,990 titles).\n\nAnarchism publications prepared for U. S. foreign-language communities.\n\nSusan B. Anthony Collection: Library and papers of Susan B. Anthony.\n\nMargaret Armstrong Collection: Artistic bindings, approximately 200 items.\n\nMargaret Armstrong, (1867-1944) was an American graphic artist and author and a preeminent designer of decorated cloth publishers’ bindings from 1890 to 1913. Her stylized designs, stamped in bold, contrasting colors and enhanced with gold and silver leaf, have exceptional visual appeal. Armstrong developed her own distinctive lettering and was known for her groundbreaking integration of type and image. She designed for major authors, including the Brownings, George Du Maurier, Paul Dunbar, Washington Irving, Henry Thoreau, Henry Van Dyke, and John Greenleaf Whittier, often creating sets of complimentary covers that identified particular authors. Between 1899 and 1913 Armstrong created covers for fourteen popular romance novels by Myrtle Reed and designed for other late nineteenth-century women writers. Margaret or her sister Helen Maitland Armstrong provided interior border designs for many of the books. As printed dust jackets displaced decorative bindings after 1910, Armstrong began a second career, compiling and illustrating her seminal handbook, Western Wildflowers, and later writing two biographies and three detective novels. The Library of Congress purchased a selection of her book bindings in 2008.\n\nAlso see a catalog record regarding Miscellaneous items in the Margaret Armstrong Binding Collection.\n\nAnti-Authoritarian Children's Materials Collection: German and Swedish language anti-authoritarian children's materials, 1963-1992.\n\nA collection of German and some Swedish language anti-authoritarian children's materials from the mid 1960s until the early 1990's, primarily in the 1970s consisting of books, picture books, comics and magazines for children as well as books, journals, brochures, pamphlets and other materials for adults related to counter-culture, sex education and alternative pedagogy of children. Includes some posters and two sound recordings and scattered issues of periodicals for adults and magazines for children, including an extensive run of Underground, das deutsche Schülermagazin.\n\nSee the Anti-Authoritarian Children's Materials Collection for details.

Important works in the collection include a gift from the Charles H. Slama Library consisting of thirty-one books, three of which are incunabula, two 16th century English Bibles and assorted 16th century Bibles in Latin and Greek. Also included are a portfolio of original leaves from Bibles, and editions of Homer, Milton and Adam Smith.\n\nPerhaps the most important book in the Slama donation to the Bible Collection is a four-volume Latin Bible printed in 1497 by Anton Koberger. This Bible is quite uncommon in its complete form, as found , which has the added interest of being in its original binding of blind-stamped calf over wooden boards. An abundance of manuscript leaves, among them a four-page eleventh-century fragment and a twenty-page fragment form circa 1400, are used as endpapers. The thirty-eight woodcuts in this Bible are reduced versions of those appearing in the 1481 Koberger Bible, the first illustrated book to come from that press.\n\nAlso see the Bible Collection Exhibit.\n\nBig Little Book Collection: Popular children's books, mid-twentieth century.\n\nKatherine Golden Bitting Collection: Publications and manuscripts on gastronomy from the fifteenth through twentieth centuries.\n\nBollingen Foundation Collection: Records and publications of the Bollingen Foundation, (621 titles).\n\nThe Bollingen Foundation was established in 1945 by Paul and Mary Conover Mellon to create a larger audience for Carl G. Jung's theories through the publication of his collected works in English translation. From this initial publishing venture grew the Bollingen Series, a distinguished series of publications on aesthetics, anthropology, literary criticism, philosophy, psychology, and comparative religion. With the transfer of the Bollingen Series to Princeton University Press in 1969, the foundation concluded its activities and presented its records to the Library of Congress four years later.\n\nAn archival set of books published by the Bollingen Foundation or with its financial support is kept in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division.\n\nBookplate Collection: Bookplates designed by twentieth-century Russian artists, (130 bookplates).\n\nBroadside Collection: Mostly single-sheet publications from Europe and the Americas (with the vast majority from the United States) dating from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries.\n\nBroadside Song Collection: Nineteenth-century musical lyrics in English, (4,525 items).\n\nMarian S. Carson Collection: Americana.\n\nThe Americana collection of Marian Sadtler Carson (1905-2004) spans the years 1656-1995 with the bulk of the material dating from 1700 to 1876. The collection includes more than 10,000 historical letters and manuscripts, broadsides, photographs, prints and drawings, books and pamphlets, maps, and printed ephemera from the colonial era through the 1876 centennial of the United States.\n\nIt is believed to be the most extensive existing private collection of early Americana. The collection includes such important and diverse historical treasures as unpublished papers of Revolutionary War figures and the Continental Congress; letters of several American presidents, including Thomas Jefferson; a manuscript account of the departure of the first Pony Express rider from St. Joseph, Mo.; and what may be the earliest photograph of a human face.\n\nMany of the rare books and pamphlets in the collection pertain to the early Congresses of the United States, augmenting the Library's unparalleled collection of political pamphlets and imprints. The Carson Collection adds to the Library's holdings the first presidential campaign biography, John Beckley's Address to the people of the United States with an Epitome and vindication of the Public Life and Character of Thomas Jefferson, published in Philadelphia in 1800. The book was written to counter numerous attacks against Jefferson's character, which appeared in newspapers and pamphlets during the bitter election campaign.\n\nThe Rare Book and Special Collections Division shares custodial responsibility for the collection with the Library's Geography and Map Division, Music Division, Prints and Photographs Division, and the Manuscript Division.\n\nSee like collections at the Rare Book and Special Collections Division: American Imprints:Books and pamphlets printed in the United States between 1640 and 1800, (16,990 titles); American Almanacs: Seventeenth through Nineteenth Century American Almanacs.\n\nAlso see the Manuscript Division's Carson finding aid,numerous Carson collections in the Prints and Photographs Division.\n\nMiguel de Cervantes Collection: Rare editions of Cervantes in eight different languages, the gift of Leonard Kebler, (over 400 volumes dispersed in the Division's collection).\n\nDon Quixote is the work best represented in the Library's Cervantes collection. There are nearly 100 editions in the original Spanish and 135 editions in 26 other languages. Noteworthy items in this respect are the first editions in Spanish, English, Italian, German, Dutch, Danish, Portugese and Swedish. Other works are presented by important and distinctive examples such as the first editions of Novelas Ejemplares in Italian and English; Persiles y Sigismunda in English and Italian; and Viage del Parnaso in Spanish.\n\nChildren's Book Collection: Children's books, eighteenth century to present.\n\nThe Rare Book and Special Collections Division houses approximately 18,000 children's books dating from the early eighteenth century to the present. Particularly strong in American juvenile fiction, the collection contains numerous works by Jacob Abbot (creator of the \"Rollo\" series), William Taylor Adams (\"Oliver Optic\"), Louisa May Alcott, Mrs. G. R. Alden (\"Pansy\"), Horatio Alger, Jr., Rebecca Sophia Clark, Charles A. Fosdick (\"Harry Castlemon\"), Samuel Griswold Goodrich, Harriet Mulford Stone Lothrop (the Five Little Peppers series), and Susan Warner. Outstanding contemporary children's books, acquired largely through copyright deposit, are selected for the collection each year and preserved with dust jackets and unmarked title pages. Examples illustrating popular reading tastes are also chosen. Among the modern writers represented by first editions are Ludwig Bemelmans, James Daughterty, Meindert DeJong, William Pene Du Bois, Rachel Field, Robert McCloskey, E. B. White, and Laura Ingalls Wilder. Earlier children's books include instructional texts, early nineteenth-century paperbound books, and rare American publications presented to the Library in 1941 by Frank J. Hogan of Washington, D. C--among them a copy of Goodrich's The Tales of Peter Parley About America (Boston: 1827), two late eighteenth-century copies of Cock Robin's Death and Funeral, and ten New England Primers, six of them printed before 1800.\n\nChildren's books are also found in other special collections in the Division such as the Batchelder, Hersholt, and Kipling collections.\n\nRichard L. Coe Theatre Programs Collection: American theaters and some foreign productions published from the early 1900's to the late 1970's.\n\nPrograms and playbills from American theaters and some foreign productions published from the early 1900s to the late 1970s, many with the collector's annotations, (approximately 5,000 items).\n\nRichard Livingston Coe (1914‑1995), born in New York, NY was a theater and cinema critic for The Washington Post for more than fifty years. Coe was considered a unique critic, who expressed more of the positive rather than the negative in his support for actors.\n\nOne of the more notable contributions to Washington theatre was Coe's early efforts, and editorial participation to establish The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. He is also credited for being a major voice in the effort to end racial discrimination of African Americans attending The National Theatre (Washington, D.C.), prior to the civil rights movement in the United States.\n\nCoe was a close friend of Washington native and actress, Helen Hayes, \"First Lady of the American Theatre\", and was contacted by a group of individuals seeking to secure her participation in establishing The Helen Hayes Awards, also in Washington, D.C. Coe received the Critic of the Year award by the Directors Guild of America in 1963, and is an inductee in The College of Fellows of the American Theatre.\n\nBackground of the collection\n\nCollection consists of approximately5,000 programs and playbills from American theaters and some foreign productions published from the early 1900s to the late 1970s, many with the collector's annotations. LC acquired the collection in the early 1980s. Items are arranged alphabetically by title of production.\n\nThe following theaters are particularly well represented:\n\nWashington, D.C.: Arena Stage, Ford's Theater, John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the National Theater, New Gayety Theater, and the Shubert Theater.\n\nMaryland: The Olney Theatre in Maryland.\n\nNew York City: Belasco Theater, Ethel Barrymore Theater, Guild Theater, Henry Miller's Theater, and the New York Shakespeare Festival as well as many off-Broadway venues.\n\nAlso contains programs from England and France, press releases, newspaper clippings, miscellaneous announcements, and typewritten and handwritten notes.\n\nSee American Theatre Programs of the Twentieth Century for more details.\n\nAlso see: The Richard L. Coe Early Scrapbook Finding Aid. (PDF, 212 KB)\n\nConfederate States of America Collection: Publications issued in the South during the Civil War. (1,812 titles).\n\nThe Confederate State of America Collection brings together publications selected from the Library's general collections and books received from such sources as the Rebel Archives of the War Department. The 1,812-volume collection is particularly rich in documents issued by the individual state governments and the congress, departments, and offices of the Confederate States of America. A list covering most of these official publications was compiled by Hugh A. Morrison entitled, Society of America. The collection also contains Confederate almanacs, textbooks, sermons, and works of history, literature, military science, and politics and provides a comprehensive survey of book production in the South during the Civil War.\n\nAlso see the blog post: Waste Not, Want Not, A view on the hardships for the Confederacy during the Civil War and a related collection in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division: the Alfred Whital Stern Collection of Lincolniana: Publications, manuscripts, prints, and other material relating to Abraham Lincoln.\n\nConfederate States of America Collection; Confederate Songs: Southern ballads about the Civil War, (158 broadsides).\n\nCongressional Speech Collection: Pamphlets of Speeches delivered by members of Congress, 1825-1940, (3,750 speeches).\n\nThe printed texts of 3,570 speeches delivered by members of Congress between 1825-1940 are preserved in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division. The majority of these individually published pamphlets date from the last six decades of the nineteenth century. While many of the post-Civil War speeches were printed in other sources, the full text of earlier examples survive largely through the pamphlet copies.\n\nConstitutional Convention Broadside Collection: Broadsides and other documents related to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the ratification of the new Constitution, and the creation of the Bill of Rights.\n\nThe Constitutional Convention Broadside Collection (21 titles) dates from 1786 to 1789 and includes documents relating to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, extracts of proceedings of state assemblies and conventions relating to the ratification of the Constitution, and several essays on ratification.\n\nMost of the items in the collections are composed of a single sheet, meeting the classic definition of a broadside. Some items, however, range in length to twenty-eight pages. All of these broadsides, many of which were acquired in 1867 from Peter Force, are in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division, with the exception of one broadside, which is in the Manuscript Division.\n\nContinental Congress Broadside Collection: Broadsides and other documents pertaining to the work of the Continental Congress during the Revolutionary War and Confederation periods.\n\nThe Continental Congress Broadside Collection, consisting of 256 titles, includes material relating to the work of Congress, dating from 1774 to 1788. Items are predominantly extracts of the journals of Congress, resolutions, committee reports, proclamations, treaties, and other congressional proceedings. These broadsides provide a significant supplement to the Journals of the Continental Congress. Some of the broadsides trace the evolution of congressional measures at specific stages of consideration and differ significantly from the modified resolutions finally adopted by Congress. Some items contain manuscript annotations not recorded elsewhere that offer insight into the delicate process of creating consensus. In many cases, multiple copies bearing manuscript annotations are available to compare and contrast. Not every major topic considered by Congress is represented by this collection; the bulk of the material dates from 1781 to 1788.\n\nMost of the items in the collection are composed of a single sheet, meeting the classic definition of a broadside. Some items, however, range in length to 28 pages. All of these broadsides, many of which were acquired in 1867 from Peter Force--historian, collector, and compiler of American Archives--are in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division, with the exception of one broadside, which is in the Manuscript Division.\n\nHoward Dearstyne Collection: Printed material transferred from the Dearstyne Papers in the Manuscript Division, (432 items).\n\nHoward Dearstyne, (1903-1979) was an architect and writer. He was the only American graduate of the Bauhaus, and was immensely affected by its teachings and concepts, especially those of its last master, Mies van der Rohe. Dearstyne published on a wide array of subjects, including the architecture of colonial Virginia--especially Williamsburg--modern art, architectural design and city planning, design in nature, art photography and the Bauhaus.\n\nAlso see the Manuscript Division for the Howard Dearstyne Papers, 1911-1988.\n\nDell Paperback Collection: Archival set of Dell paperbacks, (6,501 titles).\n\nPopular paperback fiction, nineteenth century, (approximately 40,000 titles).\n\nIn 1860 Irwin P. Beadle & Company became the first American publisher to issue paperback fiction in a series at the fixed price of ten cents a volume. The first dime novels were largely Indian and pioneer tales that were highly moralistic in spirit. In the 1870s detective adventures, society romances, and rags-to-riches stories were introduced and soon the term dime novel was popularly applied to any sensational, blood-and-thunder novel issued in pamphlet form. Through copyright deposit the Library of Congress has accumulated a dime novel collection of nearly 40,000 titles, from 280 different series. The prolific publishing houses of Beadle & Adams, Frank Tousey, and Street & Smith are well represented. The collection also contains serially published songbooks, jokebooks, and handbooks and issues of the popular reprint libraries that specialized in the unauthorized editions of foreign novels and stories before the passage of the International Copyright At in 1891. There is a particularly extensive run of the Seaside Library, the series founded by George Munro in 1877.\n\nSee Dime novels from the Rare Book collections of the Library of Congress for information pertaining to microfilm of this collection.\n\nCharles Dickens Collection: First editions of Charles Dickens' works included in the Leonard Kebler gift, (dispersed in the Division's collection).\n\nLarry Dingman Collection: Documents the rise of American Western fiction and the cowboy novel.\n\nThe Dingman Western Collection was acquired by the Division in 2012. Larry Dingman, owner of the Dinkytown Antiquarian Book Store in Minneapolis, was known as the “King of Western Fiction.” Over several decades he amassed an important collection that documented the origins and rise of the literature of the American West. It covers the genre from its earliest manifestation in explorers’ journals, letters, and diaries, to the present day in all its diverse representations and subgenres. The collection consists of about six thousand hardcover western fiction novels, four hundred paperback western fiction novels, and about one hundred reference works. It also contains numerous anthologies of Western short stories and poetry, many of which were compiled by famous Western writers.\n\nIn 1860, with the birth of the Dime Novel, Americans were able to purchase a wealth of popular fiction at a fixed, inexpensive price. The stories were patriotic, often nationalistic tales of encounters between Native Americans and settlers. Many times, the tales were fictionalized stories based on real people such as Buffalo Bill, Jesse James, and Billy the Kid. By the 1890s, Dime Novels and their younger siblings, the Pulp Magazines were being devoured by the American public. The bold color covers depicting scenes of courage and bloodshed appealed to a mostly adolescent audience, though sales were not limited to this group. Pulp magazines eventually overtook the dime novels and retained their popularity well into the 1950s. The Dingman Western Collection contains a colorful selection of these beautifully illustrated magazines which touch upon nearly all the aspects of Western literature that have become so familiar to us all.\n\nIn 1902, Owen Wister published what is considered to be the first “real” Western, The Virginian. This novel exposed the genre to a wider, more sophisticated audience, and established classic features of the Western genre (like the six-shooter showdown) that would endure for decades to come. From Owen Wister and Zane Gray in the early 20th century, to Sherman Alexie and Leslie Marmon Silko in the 20th, the Dingman Western Collection shows how really remarkably varied this body of literature is, and how important it is to American history and identity.\n\nAlso see: The Pulp Fiction Collection\n\nLester Douglas Collection: Printed material designed and donated by Lester Douglas, (98 items).\n\nDouglas was an American book designer whose meticulous craftsmanship illustrated the effectiveness of many of his innovations and experiments in typography and design. The collection includes books and other graphic works which Douglas designed and includes various drafts and works in progress from conception through to completion. Organized by individual folders for all his important books, the collection illustrates how his works as they progressed. Frequently they contain original drawings, trial title pages, and proofs of various kinds.\n\nFor details see The Lester Douglas Collection of Books and Other Graphic Works. To browse a listing of titles, type: Lester Douglas Collection (Library of Congress) into the Library of Congress online catalog.\n\nEarly Bulgarian Imprint Collection: Bulgarian-language publications, nineteenth century.\n\nThe early Bulgarian Imprint Collection, purchased by the Library of Congress in 1949 and housed in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division, contains copies of some of the earliest books printed in the modern Bulgarian language. Because printing presses were prohibited within Bulgaria by the Turks before the country achieved national autonomy in 1878, these books were printed chiefly in Constantinople, Vienna, Belgrade, Bucharest, and Budapest. The approximately 600 \"pre-liberation\" books in the collection include copies of 150 religious books, 50 grammars and readers, 35 histories, 30 patriotic works, 33 translations, and 20 calendars. Approximately 40 percent of the Bulgarian-language publications produced between 1806 and 1877 are represented. Of particular note is the 1806 edition of Krakow, the collection of 96 sermons prepared by Bishop Sofroniǐ of Vrasta, which was the first book to be published in modern Bulgarian. Two annotated copies of the standard bibliography Opis na starite pechatani bǔlgarski knigi by Valeriǐ Pgorelov serves as the finding aid to the Collection.\n\nEarly Copyright Records Collection: U. S. copyright registers and accession records, 1790-1870, (615 titles, 44,032 title pages).\n\nA congressional act signed into law on July 8, 1870, authorized by the Librarian of Congress \"to perform all acts and duties required by the law touching copyrights and stipulated that all copyright records and deposits be transferred to the Library of Congress. Before 1870, authors and publishers registered their claims to statutory copyright with the clerks of the U. S. District Court for the jurisdiction in which they resided. The 615 volumes of early records in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division consists largely of the District Court registers from the years 1790 to 1870. Although varying in completeness, the record books often contain indexes by claimant or claimant and title and, particularly after January 1, 1803, include specimens of commercial labels and prints that were submitted for copyright registration. The collection also contains records of the Department of State (17960-1842), the federal body that until the mid-nineteenth century was responsible for deposit copies received as legal evidence. From the Patent Office, which took over the copyright activities of the Department of State in 1859, there are records compiled before August 1870. Other documents include the accession registers of the Library of Congress listing the deposit copies secured for government library use during the mid-nineteenth century. The records are available on microfilm in the Copyright Office. One of the most interesting features of the collection for the bibliographer is the group of 44, 032 title pages (1790-1870) which were deposited by authors and publishers as evidence of intention to publish. Some title pages document works that were substantially altered before publication or were never printed.\n\nDigitized Materials\n\nEarly Copyright Records Collection, 1790 to 1870\n\nEdiciones Vigía Collection: Cuban book art, 1985, (156 titles).\n\nThe lantern is the logo of Ediciones Vigía, a collective of book artists in Matanzas, Cuba, which produces books of both high literary and artistic value. The press began in 1985 and takes its name from its location in the Plaza de la Vigía, or Watchtower Square. Artists and authors, translators and poets make up this collective. Prominent members include Jorge Luis Borges, Dulce María Loynaz, and Gabriel García Márquez. The books are made with an inexpensive paper called bagasse, which is made from sugar cane. It is brown and looks something like the paper used for grocery store bags. The ephemeral nature of the books and banners is part of their appeal and part of the challenge to those interested in collecting them. The smaller books have cords of yarn or twine, in the tradition of literatura del cordel, the practice of hanging small handmade books from clotheslines in public squares.\n\nEistophos Science Club Archive: Records of the Washington based organization for the promotion of women in the science, 1909-1940s.\n\nHarrison Elliott Collection: Paper specimens, personal papers and research material relating to the history of papermaking, (4,500 specimens and 5,800 secondary sources).\n\nHarrison G. Elliott (1879-1954), probably the most prominent producer of handmade paper of America during the early twentieth century, began his study of paper while employed by the International Paper Company. In 1925 he joined the Japan Paper Company, a New York importing firm which distributed fine handmade papers from 15 European and Asian Countries. As advertising and direct mail promotion manager, Elliott designed and commissioned paper specimens and continued to write numerous articles on the history of papermaking. In 1954 Elliott donated to the Library of Congress the study collection which had had formed over a 40 year period. The collection includes twentieth-century paper specimens and sample books as well as trade journals, photographs, trade correspondence, and other secondary materials relating to the history and manufacture of paper. Of special interest is a sample collection of 300 early American papers and the correspondence and memorabilia of Dard Hunter, an authority on the history of paper and a personal friend of Elliott's. The collection contains approximately 4,500 specimens and fifty-eight hundred secondary sources.\n\nSee Paper Specimens, Personal Papers, and Research Material Relating to the History of Papermaking for details.\n\nRalph Ellison Library: The personal library of Ralph Ellison, (1914-1994).\n\nRalph Waldo Ellison (1914-1994) was born in Oklahoma City and studied at Tuskegee Institute in 1933-36. During the Depression he participated in the New York City Writers' Project under the Works Progress Administration. He served with the U.S. Merchant Marine from 1943 to 1945 and married Fanny McConnell in 1946. During a long and distinguished literary career he taught at the following universities and colleges: Bard (1958-61), Chicago (1961), Rutgers (1962-64), Yale (1966), and New York University (1970-79), as well as Columbia, Fisk, Antioch, Princeton and Bennington. He served as the Library of Congress' Honorary Consultant in American Letters from 1966 to 1972.\n\nAlthough Ellison published a number of short stories and numerous essays, including the collections Shadow and Act (1964) and Going to the Territory (1986), much of his reputation rests on the novel Invisible Man. Published in 1952, this novel became the pioneer work of fiction for the genre of African American literature. It won the National Book Award in 1953 and can be credited with stimulating a vital strain of ethnic fiction, drama and poetry in the United States that has flourished since. Ellison's seminal novel portrays the inner realities of a black youth as he moves from the South to the North and then underground. It is considered a major achievement in both American and world literature.\n\nSee the Manuscript Division's Ralph Ellison Collection.\n\nAlso see the finding aid: the Ralph Ellison Collection, (1937-2010) [View Finding aid] [PDF:2.21 MB] 355 pages\n\nEnglish Literature Collection: Selected Literature from the Bertram Dobell Collection, (1,600 titles).\n\nSee the Catalogue of Books Printed for Private Circulation. London, Published by Bertram Dobell, 1906.\n\nGeorge Fabyan Collection: Early editions of works of seventeenth-century English literature, publications relating to cryptography, (1,550 titles).\n\nGeorge Fabyan (1867-1936), a member of Chicago Stock Exchange and founder of Riverbank Laboratories in Geneva, Illinois, was an accomplished cryptographer. During World War I he trained army intelligence officers in deciphering codes, winning the French Legion of Honor for his efforts. One of his areas of specialty was the Shakespeare-Bacon authorship controversy, and he published writings on principles of Baconian ciphers and their application in sixteenth and seventeenth-century books. The Cryptographer's research collection was received by the Library of Congress in 1940 through his bequest. The Fabyan Collection incorporates the Francis Bacon material assembled by John Dane of Boston and includes 33 distinct editions of Bacon's works published between 1597 and 1640. In addition to many volumes of seventeenth-century English literature, the collections contains early cryptographic texts such as Johannes Triteness' Polygraphiae Libri Sex, present in the first edition (1518) and seven subsequent printings. The collection numbers approximately 1,550 volumes.\n\nCharles Feinberg-Whitman Collection: Early editions of Walt Whitman's works, (488 titles).\n\nHerman Finkelstein Collection: Twentieth-century American literature, (300 titles).\n\nHerman Finkelstein, a copyright lawyer and long time friend of the Library, donated his 20th century American literature collection consisting of runs of William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Wolfe, John Steinbeck, among others. In immaculate condition, these first editions include their original dust jackets.\n\nPeter Force Library: Early American imprints and incunabula.\n\nThe holdings of Americana in the Library of Congress owes much of their strength to the collecting zeal of Peter Force (1790-1868). In the course of preparing his \"Documentary History of the American Revolution,\" a compilation better known today as American Archives, this Washington publisher and politician assembled what was probably the largest private collection of printed and manuscript sources on American history in the United States. The Peter Force Library was purchased by act of Congress in 1867. In one stroke, the Library of Congress established its first major collections of eighteenth-century American newspapers, incunabula, early American imprints, manuscripts, and rare maps and atlases. Although no complete inventory survives, many of the approximately 22,500 Force volumes are recorded without source designation in the Catalogue of Books added to the Library of Congress from December 1, 1866 to December 1, 1867.\n\nIncunabula, pre-1801 American imprints, and other rare publications from the Force Library have been absorbed into the collections of the Rare Book and Special Collections Division. The Division holdings include important compilations of pamphlets that were assembled by such collectors as William Duane, Ebenezer Hazard, Jacob Bailey Moore, Israel Thorndike, and Oliver Wolcott. It is estimated that over 8,000 of the approximately 40,000 pamphlets purchased from Force were printed before 1800.\n\nBenjamin Franklin Collection: Papers and publications of Benjamin Franklin, (850 titles).\n\nIn 1882, the U.S. government purchased a portion of the papers Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) had bequeathed to his grandson William Temple Franklin (1790-1823). The collection represents the material taken to London by William Franklin to prepare his three volume work, Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Benjamin Franklin (London: 1817-1818), and acquired in 1851 by Henry Stevens, an American book dealer in London. At the time of purchase the books and pamphlets in the collection were sent to the Library of Congress. Approximately 200 items from the Benjamin Franklin Collection in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division can be traced to the Stevens purchase and are described in Henry Stevens' Benjamin Franklin's Life and Writings: A Biographical Essay on the Stevens' Collection of Books and Manuscripts Relating to Doctor Franklin.\n\nThe collection embraces 850 volumes that were written, printed, edited, or published by Franklin. Notable items include numerous early editions and translations of the Autobiography, Baroness Le Despencer's annotated copy of the Abridgement of the Book of Common Prayer (London: 1773) and Franklin edited, one of the four known surviving copies of A Vindication of the New-North-Church in Boston (Boston: 1720) which was printed during Franklin's apprenticeship at his brother's shop, and the first edition of Franklin's Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity (London: 1725). Also of relevant interest are the few volumes once owned by Franklin that were purchased by Thomas Jefferson and acquired by the Library of Congress as part of the Thomas Jefferson Library.\n\nFranklin Book Program Collection: Archival set of Franklin Program publications of American books translated into Middle Eastern and Asian languages, (3,980 titles in remote storage).\n\nSigmund Freud Collection: Early editions of Freud's writings, (187 titles).\n\nFine Arts Press of Edwin and Robert Grabhorn. (Approximately 75 items).\n\nThe Rare Book Division has collected about half the products of this private press. See the Bibliography of the Grabhorn Press for details.\n\nGrenfell Press Archive Collection, 1979-1992. Chronicles the book production, publicity, and business transactions associated with the Grenfell Press.\n\nThe Grenfell Press Archive, which chronicles the book production, publicity, and business transactions associated with the Grenfell Press, has been arranged broadly into three categories: correspondence and typescripts, material relating to the production of individual works published by the Grenfell Press, and material relating to miscellaneous publications designed (but not published) by the press. The section comprising correspondence and typescripts relates to general business matters of the press; correspondence relating specifically to the production of an individual work is grouped with the production materials for that work. These production materials have been arranged in chronological order by publication date of the item to which they relate and sub-arranged by type; for example, correspondence, followed by typescripts and paste-ups, material relating to illustration and binding, etc. The original 1993 purchase also includes several published items that were lacking from the Rare Book Collection's almost complete holdings of Grenfell Press titles; these items have been cataloged separately (a source note has been added to the cataloging record to identify them) and housed with the Grenfell Press Collection. Also, in order to connect the material in the archive generally to the resulting publications housed in the Grenfell Press Collection, the record number for each publication is noted in parentheses in this finding aid. An index of names (authors and artists) and titles of publications has also been provided, but it should be noted that the section comprising correspondence and typescripts has not been indexed.\n\nAlso see the Finding Aid to the Grenfell Press Archive Collection.\n\nEdward Gorey Collection: The works and ephemera of Edward Gorey, (802 items).\n\nFrederic W. Goudy Collection: Personal library, papers, and publications of type designer Frederic Goudy, (2,499 items).\n\nAmerican type designer Frederic W. Goudy (1865-1947) began experimenting with layout and printing while working as a bookkeeper in Chicago in the 1890s. He created a total of 124 type designs, executing many from drawing to casting, and operated the Village Press with his wife Bertha from 1903 to 1939. The Goudy Collection in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division was purchased from Goudy himself in 1944 and consists largely of material that escaped a disastrous workshop fire in 1939. The collection includes Goudy's personal library on typography and numerous examples of fine printing (approximately 1890-1944), particularly from private American Presses. The output of the Village Press is documented by over 150 items ranging from dummies and broadsides to finished books. The Division copy of Melbert B. Carry's A Bibliography of the Village Press (New York: Press of the Woolly Whale, 1938. 205 p. Z232.G68C3) has been annotated to indicate collection holdings. In addition, the collection contains photographs of Goudy and his wife and drawings, rubbings, proofs, and posters illustrative of his commercial design work on The Inland Printer and for the Curtis Publishing Company, the Peerless Motor Car Company, and other clients. In 1975 a group of manuscripts was added to the original purchase, bringing the total number of manuscript items in the collection to 3,169. The acquisition includes correspondence largely from the years 1935 to 1945, papers relating to Goudy's A Half-Century of Type Design and Typography, 1985-1945 (1946), and notes and galley proofs for an unpublished book by Paul Bennett entitled \"Goudy: The Man and His Work.\" Howard Coggeshall, Richard Ellis, and Mitchell Kennerley are among the correspondents. Many of the 1,791 volumes and 708 pamphlets in the Goudy Collections are represented in author/title and shelf-list files. Also available is a register (PDF, 2.6 MB) describing non-book materials and an inventory of the 1944 purchase.\n\nVictor Hammer Collection: The archives of the typographer, painter, and sculptor, (over 50 archival boxes).\n\nHawaiian Imprint Collection: Hawaiian publications, nineteenth century, (353 volumes).\n\nHenry Harisse Collection: Publications, papers, and maps pertaining to the early exploration of America, (414 items).\n\nPerhaps best known for Bibliotheca Americana Vetusissima, a description of over three hundred writings on America published between 1492 and 1551, Henry Harrisse (1829-1910) wrote extensively on Christopher and Ferdinand Columbus, John and Sebastian Cabot, and the early voyages of American exploration. Through his bequest, the Library of Congress acquired in 1915 his personal copies of his publications, complete with marginal comments and interleaved notes. In addition to over two hundred volumes, the collection preserves correspondence pertaining to Harrisse's research, an original letter by Pietro Martire d'Anghiera, and a manuscript (ca. 1533) describing a voyage along the northern coast of South America. See: The finding aid for the Henry Harrisse Collection (PDF, 2.0 MB)\n\nJean Hersholt Collections: Early editions of Hans Christian Andersen's writings and his papers; first editions of the writings of Hugh Walpole and Sinclair Lewis and related papers, (963 items).\n\nIn the early 1950s Mr. and Mrs. Jean Hersholt presented to the Library their collection of Anderseniana, probably the most comprehensive collection in America of first editions, manuscripts, letters, presentation copies, and pictorial material relating to Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875). The Hersholt Collection, formed by the collectors over a 30 year period, chronicles Andersen's publications beginning with his first book, Ungdoms-forsøg (Youthful Attempts), which was issued in Copenhagen in 1822 under the pseudonym William Christian Walter. Among the first editions in the collection are the six pamphlets published by C. A. Reitsel of Copenhagen between 1835 and 1842 with the title, Eventyr, fortalte for børn (Fairy Tales Told for Children). These contain the earliest printings of nineteen of the fairy tales, among them \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" and \"Thumbelina.\" The collection also includes manuscripts of several fairy tales, Andersen's correspondence (1868-74) with his American publisher Horace E. Scudder, volumes inscribed by Andersen, early translations, significant posthumous editions, and works about Andersen.\n\nTo a lesser degree, Jean Hersholt collected letters, literary manuscripts and first editions of the writings of two of his friends, Sir Hugh Walpole (1884-1941) and Sinclair Lewis (1885-1951). Walpole is represented by 60 inscribed publications and holograph manuscripts of The Duchess of Wrexe, The Captives, and Wintersmoon. 28 of the 30 first editions of Sinclair Lewis's works in the collection are inscribed to Hersholt. Of particular interest is Lewis's personal copy of his 1930 Nobel Prize acceptance speech with his numerous revisions.\n\nHersholt, who was knighted by King Christian X of Denmark in 1946 for his war relief work, also assembled a small collection of Danish underground publications from World War II. The four collections contain a total of 963 items.\n\nMartin F. Hertz Gift: World War II propaganda ephemera, (2 scrapbooks).\n\nTwo leather-bound volumes of English-language leaflets are alternately descriptions of the good treatment given deserters and efforts to turn the British and American soldiers against one another. The predominant political theme is not the praise of the National Socialist regime but rather the \"Bolshevik menace\" to Europe. The Hertz Collection joins a 6,700 piece collection of the propaganda of all the participants in World War II transferred from the old Office of War Information.\n\nFrank J. Hogan Collection: Instructional texts, early nineteenth-century paperbound books, and rare juvenile American publications, (86 titles).\n\nIn 1941 Frank J. Hogan presented 86 rare pieces of juvenilia to the Library. Included in the gift was 1 of 3 known copies of Samuel G. Goodrich's The Tales of Peter Parley about America (Boston, 1827), the first native production which accented entertainment in a child's book as strongly as it did instruction. The Hogan gift also included 10 New England primers, the earliest of which is the very rare Providence edition of 1775, which contains the well-known childhood prayer \"Now I lay me down to sleep,\" and the only known copies of the Boston primer of 1790. Another rarity in the Hogan gift was the earliest American edition of Cock Robin's Death and Funeral (Boston, ca. 1780).\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes: Book and print collection of the Holmes family, (12,126 items).\n\nThe book and print collection of Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes (1841-1935), received through his bequest in 1935, represents the combined libraries of several generations of the Holmes family. In addition to the hundreds of works on jurisprudence, constitutional law, philosophy, history, economics, political science, education, oriental art, science and bibliography assembled by Justice Holmes, the collection contains the books of Holmes' great-grandfather, Judge Charles Jackson; and his paternal grandfather, the Rev. Abiel Holmes, an early collector of Americana. Possibly the most outstanding feature, however, is the American literature collected by Justice Holmes' father, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894), author of The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table. Noteworthy representation volumes inscribed by James Russell Lowell, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Ralph Waldo Emerson and rare nineteenth century publications, such as Illustrations of the Athenaeum Gallery of Paintings (1830) and the New York edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1886) bound with sheets of the suppressed English edition of the previous year. Approximately 700 volumes are in this collection.\n\nAlso see the Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. Room Finding Aid.

Jones of Brookline, Massachusetts, the Library received a collection devoted to the writings of the American novelist, Henry James (1843-1916). Around this nucleus, the Library formed the Henry James Collection, adding books selected from the general collections and proof pages of several James novels were deposited for copyright protection. The James Collection contains first English and American editions of James' writing, significant later editions of books he revised, publications to which James contributed prefaces, stories, or essays, and critical studies by James scholars. One of the rarest items in the collection is a dramatization of Daisy Miller that was privately printed in 1882. There are 132 items in this collection.\n\nJanus Press Collection: Archival materials relating to book production by Claire Van Vliet at the Janus Press, (1,000 items).\n\nClaire Van Vliet, book artist, typographer and founder of Janus Press has donated her collections as well as archival material to the Library of Congress.\n\nThe collection is organized by individual books of the press and for each book there exist drawings, proofs, layouts, and designs. The Janus Press Collection is an outstanding example of the division's strengths in the area of fine printing.\n\nThomas Jefferson Collection: Thomas Jefferson book collection, (2,375 titles).\n\nJuvenile Collection: Children's books dating from the early eighteenth century to the present, (18,200 items).\n\nAs a result of the federal copyright regulations, the Library of Congress assembled an immense collection of American children's books. From these holdings the Rare Book and Special Collection Division has brought together on its shelves approximately 15,000 volumes of particular interest. V. Valta Parma, first curator of rare books (1927-1939) can be credited with pulling together this collection from selections in the general collections.

These volumes were returned to the Library and formed the nucleus of the \"Library of Congress Collection of Books by Colored Authors.\" In 1926, through Murray's bequest, the Library received 1,448 books and pamphlets Murray had privately assembled for his projected \"Historical and Biographical Encyclopedia of the Colored Race\"; these were added to the Colored Author Collection. While the Colored Author Collection has been integrated with the Library's general collections (duplicates were transferred to Howard University in Washington, D.C.), 184 pamphlets from Murray's library have been retained as a unit in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division.

It is described in Annette Melville's \"Special Collections in the Library of Congress: A Selective Guide\" (Washington, DC: Library of Congress, 1980). A great majority of the issues were held by the Serial and Government Publications Division, although three extremely rare and valuable titles were transferred to the Rare Book & Special Collections Division: Amazing Stories, Black Mask, and Weird Tales. The collection has now been microfilmed and is available in the Microform Reading Room, LJ-107, Jefferson Building.\n\nThe \"Pulps,\" so called because they were printed on cheap high-acid-content paper, served as popular reading material, similar to today's paperback; cheap, portable, disposable, and often sensational. This genre flourished from the 1920's to the 1950's. Titles focused on specific literary types: romance, sports, western, detective, science fiction, horror, or military (during World War II). Writers were frequently paid by the word, and to meet daily living expenses, well-known authors sometimes wrote for these magazines under pseudonyms, putting only their \"literary\" work under their real name.\n\nAuthors who got their start by writing for pulp fiction magazines include: Raymond Chandler, Cornell Woolrich, Dashiell Hammett, H.P. Lovecraft, Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, and L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nAlso see: The Inventory of Pulp Magazines (PDF, 30 KB)\n\nRadical Pamphlets Collection: Pamphlets, broadsides, and memorabilia concerning American communism, anarchism, and socialism, 1870-1980 (especially 1930-1949), (2,000 items).\n\nReformation Collection: Publications Relating to the Reformation, sixteenth century, (192 titles).\n\nBruce Rogers Collection: Books designed by Bruce Rogers and his personal papers, 34,000 items and 20 boxes of proofs, typefaces, etc.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt Collection: Material concerning Franklin Delano Roosevelt, (254 titles).\n\nInvitations, programs, tickets, menus, guest lists, portraits, clippings, and other memorabilia relating to White House functions and public and private events and entertainments hosted or attended by Franklin Roosevelt during his presidency.

Rosenwald Collection: The illustrated book, fifteenth through twentieth centuries.\n\nThe Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection stands out among the distinguished resources of the Rare Book and Special Collections Division. Taking the illustrated book as its central theme and containing books from the last six centuries and manuscripts from the three preceding, the collection's greatest strengths are in the fifteenth century woodcut books, early sixteenth-century illustrated books, William Blake, and twentieth-century livres des peintres. Within this grand design the late Mr. Rosenwald sought books produced by the earliest printers and outstanding presses of later periods, and books on the following subjects: science, calligraphy, botany, and chess. The catalog describing the collection published in 1978 contains 2,653 entries, many for books represented by more than one copy.\n\nAmong the characteristics which make this collection such a rich potential resource for study are the presence of an amazing number of unique books and books of such great rarity that only a handful of copies is known. Virtually every book in the collection is in superb condition and many contain such special features as original drawings, artists' proofs, trial states, and laid-in letters. Mr. Rosenwald's assemblage of books, plates, drawings, and engravings by William Blake is one of the finest ever brought together. Of the twenty illuminated books described in Geoffrey Keynes's Blake bibliography, the collection contains fourteen, as well as duplicates and extra plates. Finding that the Blake materials received more use than any other section of the collection, Mr. Rosenwald made copies of many of the illuminated books available to the Trianon Press for a series of facsimiles.\n\nOutstanding rarities include a volume containing four complete books printed by William Caxton, England's finest printer; eleven block books; the magnificent fifteenth-century manuscript known as the Giant Bible of Mainz; and one of two known copies of the 1495 edition of Epistolae et Evangelia, called by some the finest illustrated book of the fifteenth century. Rarities are, however, but one aspect of the collection. Its particular importance arises from the quantity and unity of the material, much of it still awaiting scholarly investigation. Before being purchased by Mr. Rosenwald, the 160 15th and 16th century Dutch and Flemish books from the Dukes of Arenberg had been inaccessible to generations of scholars and bibliographers.\n\nThe collection catalog describes Mr. Rosenwald's gifts to the Library of Congress in the years 1943 to 1975. Accounts of subsequent additions can be found in the division's acquisitions report of the Quarterly Journal.\n\nDuring Mr. Rosenwald's lifetime the collection was housed in his private gallery, the Alverthorpe Gallery in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. Not long after his death on June 24, 1979, the collection was brought to Washington and is available for consultation in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division. The division houses a card catalog containing author entries for the books and manuscripts in the collection.\n\nSee Digitized Materials from the Lessing J.
