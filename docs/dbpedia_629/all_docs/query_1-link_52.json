        "text": "It all started three years ago, when I was squeezed in between a cabaret table and a wall at the McConnell Arts Center, listening to Bernard Master talk about the birds of Worthington.Master talk about the birds of Worthington. For those of us who wanted to learn how to identify the birds that fly through our own patch, Dr. Master suggested reading Jim McCormac’s work. I dutifully followed instructions, checking out Jim’s Birds of Ohio and bookmarking his blog, Ohio Birds and Biodiversity.\n\nOn the right side of the blog’s home page, I spotted a section titled “Good Blogs and Websites Found Here.” There, I found this: “Julie Zickefoose – Beautiful musings about nature by a premier author and artist.” One click and off I went to Indigo Hill, Julie’s 80-acre sanctuary in Appalachian Ohio, named for the small blue buntings that have sung there for Julie and her husband, Bill Thompson III, ever since they arrived in 1992.\n\nJulie’s posts about her observations of nature are written in a style as charming as they are visually presented. They appear on a background that looks like a spiral-bound notebook, surrounded with collages of her artwork, snapshots of her children and a “Click on Me” tag to learn about Chet Baker, Julie’s Boston terrier that she named after her favorite jazz musician. They’re just entrancing.\n\nI’ve been wanting to hear Julie talk about her work, but her central Ohio speaking engagements and my calendar never quite meshed. Until April 19.\n\nThat evening, Julie was the featured speaker during a meeting of the Worthington Garden Club, an organization that has created plantings and lamppost hanging baskets along High Street in Old Worthington, plant auctions, nature hikes and more since its founding in 1929. What else would you expect from an organization presided over by Steve Herminghausen, the lead librarian at Worthington Libraries’ Northwest Branch, who brings along books on the topic to be discussed of each club meeting?\n\nEver since Mr. Herminghausen heard Julie on NPR talking about getting ready for the Big Sit!, an annual, international, noncompetitive birding event, he wanted to learn more about this person who opened her garage door and noticed a fowl odor. (To understand what he’s talking about, click here to listen to “Learning from a Bird: ‘The Big Sit,’” which aired on NPR on October 3, 2006.)\n\nWe all learned a lot more about Julie that evening, as she introduced us not only to herself, but also to her new book about birds, wonder, curiosity and absorption: Baby Birds: An Artist Looks into the Nest.\n\nYou can learn a lot about a person by browsing their bookshelves. In Julie’s case, you can trace the root of her desire to be an illustrator to her favorite books from childhood: Indians and the Old West: The Story of the First Americans, adapted from the pages of American Heritage by Anne Terry White; Ernest Thompson Seton’s Wild Animals I Have Known; Holling Clancy Holling’s books, including Pagoo, Minn of the Mississippi and Paddle to the Sea; the artwork of Louis and Lois Darling, who illustrated Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring and Beverly Cleary’s series of books about Ramona Quimby and Henry Huggins; and A Natural History of American Birds of Eastern and Central North America, by Edward Howe Forbush, with illustrations by Louis Agassiz Fuertes, Allan Brooks and Roger Tory Peterson. Later, while working as a young illustrator of field guides, greeting cards and Bird Watcher’s Digest magazine covers, Julie found inspiration in Edith Holden’s The Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady and Robert Clem’s illustrations for The Shorebirds of North America, by Peter Matthiessen.\n\nAnd then it hit her. After she illustrated Jonathan Pine’s Backyard Birds, she determined to write and illustrate her own books. Writing about what she knows, she has published Backyard Birding: Using Natural Gardening to Attract Birds; Letters From Eden: A Year at Home, in the Woods; and The Bluebird Effect: Uncommon Bonds with Common Birds.\n\nThis time around, Julie decided she wanted to share the magic that she’s observed during the past 13 years of observing nestling birds, from bluebirds in nest boxes to Carolina wrens nesting in a basket on her porch.\n\nHow many times have you heard not to touch bird nests because the mother bird will pick up your scent on her babies and she’ll abandon them? Well, that’s for the birds, Julie says. If you know how to handle baby birds and return them to their nest, as long as the nest is protected from a predator, you can observe their development too, especially if you have the necessary permits to handle migratory birds.\n\nEvery day, Julie borrowed a hatchling, painted its portrait, and replaced it in its nest, creating more than 400 watercolors that record the daily development of 17 bird species from egg to fledgling. All but one of the species she painted were nesting right there on her property. Surprisingly, depicting nestling growth in day-by-day paintings from life has never been done before. In fact, Julie said, the book is unusual, like a throwback to the days when well-bred ladies like Edith Holden spent their days wandering meadows, picking flowers and collecting birds’ nests and eggs to paint in their journals.\n\nJulie shared some memorable stories of her experiences, like explaining how a cinereous mourner chick that looked like a poisonous flannel moth caterpillar made her wonder about Batesian mimicry, where a species evolves to imitate the warning signals of a harmful predator. Click here to see what I mean.\n\nAnd then there was the pair of day-old yellow-billed cuckoos nesting in a tangle of honeysuckle who stood up in their nest and made noises like a snake. Julie set her camera to video, pushed it through the honeysuckle, pointed it down into the nest, and then…\n\n“By chance, the camera bumped a twig, and the weird, reptilian chicks instantly transformed, lifting themselves high on their haunches,” Julie wrote in Baby Birds. “They flapped their paddle-stub wings rapidly as they opened cavernous gapes. Brilliant red mouths, studded with white protuberances called ‘pearls,’ opened wide. Two heads waved wildly as the chicks emitted a sizzling rattle that startled me.”\n\nJust like the video I watched in Columbus Audubon’s beginning ornithology class about Estrildid finch chicks, who have fluorescent mouth markings to help their parents find their mouths and deliver their food in their dark nests, I thought! (To see what I mean, watch this video of a Gouldian finch feeding chicks in a nest.\n\nFinally, Julie introduced us to Harper, Cletus and Melba, a trio of brown thrashers who arrived in a shoebox after their Cincinnati hedgerow home was cut down. Julie fed them, photographed them, sang to them and taught them how to pick up food.\n\n“These gifts keep falling from their nests, right into an amazed and grateful heart,” Julie wrote. “The stories keep coming, and I have to keep telling them.”\n\nTo discover more about “Zick,” listen to her NPR commentaries here, and here for her interview about Baby Birds on the April 18, 2016 edition of All Sides with Ann Fisher on WOSU.\n\nDriving on Morse and East Dublin-Granville Roads has become something akin to Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride. Fiery fatal crashes, high-speed car races and pedestrians wandering into oncoming traffic all seem to be happening at an alarming rate on these busy east-west thoroughfares of our capital city.\n\nWhenever I drive these roads, I think of the jalopies that made sudden turns, sped towards an obstacle that moved out of the way at the last second, and hurtled toward oncoming collisions in the now-closed Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom ride based on The Wind in the Willows, Kenneth Grahame’s 1908 children’s novel about the adventures of a toad, a rat, a mole and a badger in pastoral England.\n\nLeaving the wild rides to other motorists, we determined to take a more leisurely route to the Granville Daffodil Show. We found it along Routes 62 and 37, which pass through Johnstown and Alexandria.\n\nWe sauntered along, admiring the scenery as John O’Conor sensitively played John Field’s sonorous nocturnes for piano. And then I spotted a curious landmark on South Main Street in Johnstown, next to the Church of the Ascension — a one-room schoolhouse!\n\nThe Cornell School was built on Duncan Plains Road near Alexandria in 1886, and students attended classes there until 1923. In May 1991, the 100-ton brick building was moved four and a half miles to its current site, on Johnstown Monroe School District property near the community’s high school. In the years that followed, the Friends of Cornell School rounded up period desks, benches, maps, portraits of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, McGuffey Readers, quill pens, inkwells, slates and other historic furnishings to recreate what it might have been like to attend school there in the late-19th century.\n\nIn 1996, the restored schoolhouse opened to the public. Ever since, it has hosted living history programs for area schools. Kindergarteners to college students are encouraged to dress in period costume, while teachers work hard to recreate an authentic experience of a typical school day at a one-room schoolhouse. The day includes elocution lessons, instruction in penmanship and old-fashioned games like jacks. Midday fare of peanut butter with home-baked bread and cookies is wrapped in a towel and served in a lunch pail. This is what we saw when we peered in the windows.\n\nTraveling a few miles farther, we spotted another curious landmark down the road in Alexandria, on the grounds of the Alexandria Public Library — an historical marker honoring the accomplishments of someone named Willoughby Dayton Miller.\n\nWilliam Penn Miller was born in Alexandria in 1853. Four years later, the boy took a fancy to the first name of his favorite playmate, Willoughby Condit, and asked his parents to call him Willoughby too. That wasn’t all; the Millers changed their son’s middle name to Dayton, after William Dayton, the 1856 Republican vice-presidential candidate.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Michigan in 1875, Miller became interested in mining engineering and studied the physical sciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. There, he met an American dentist who encouraged him to study dentistry in Berlin, Germany, where he also taught English and literature to uprooted Americans at the American embassy. Another expatriate dentist there observed Miller’s skills in metallurgy and asked him to explore different combinations of metals that would produce a better material to fill teeth.\n\nWhen Miller hoped to explore the possibility of marrying the dentist’s daughter, her father proposed a plan. If Miller returned to the United States, earned a degree in dentistry, came back to Berlin, and became his partner, he would consent to the marriage. Miller accepted his future father-in-law’s proposal.\n\nTwo years later, Miller began researching the effects of tartar deposits on teeth and how oral bacteria causes tooth discoloration and decay. In 1889, he published his findings in a book called The Micro-Organisms of the Human Mouth, which is considered the first accurate description of the process of tooth decay. Held in high regard by his peers, Miller also had the honor of serving as chief dental surgeon to Kaiser Wilhelm II and Kaiserin Augusta Victoria. He also collected butterflies and wrote a book about them, and became a champion of both golf and rifle marksmanship.\n\nMiller visited Alexandria often, purchasing the family farm in 1892 and asking his nephew to be its caretaker. In the spring of 1907, he returned to the United States to become the dean of the University of Michigan College of Dentistry; in July of that year, he suffered fatal appendicitis and was buried in Alexandria.\n\nIn 1909, a local orthodontist presented a resolution at a Columbus Dental Society meeting to raise money for a memorial to Miller. Frederick C. Hibbard, a sculptor from Chicago, created a bronze statue for the International Dental Federation that depicted a whiskered, frock-coated Miller. An inscription on the base of the statue proclaims Miller as an “educator, benefactor of his profession, friend of humanity, a native of Ohio, a citizen of the world.” The statue was unveiled on the Ohio State University campus, southwest of Thompson Library, by Miller’s grandniece on December 8, 1915, in the presence of 300 dentists attending the annual meeting of the Ohio Dental Society. In 1978, it was moved to its present home beside Postle Hall, the home of the Ohio State University College of Dentistry, at 305 W. 12th Ave.\n\nA mere minute from the Alexandria Public Library, I spotted our third curious landmark — a covered bridge!\n\nAccording to Elma Lee Moore’s Ohio’s Covered Bridges, this 47′ covered bridge was built in 1871 and first stretched across Lobdell Creek in Licking County. In 1977, it was moved to Fireman’s Park in Alexandria and was renovated. An illustration of the bridge was incorporated into the logo for St. Albans Township’s bicentennial in 2013. A poem attributed to the bridge’s builder, Frank Phillips, still hangs above one of its entrances:\n\n“All things save this have changed within our day\n\nBeside this quiet road nestled in these joyous hills\n\nYou point your modest structure toward the sky\n\nUnsought and all unchanged you give us still\n\nSome fragrance of your peace as we go by.”\n\nThe discoveries continued on the way home. Rocky Fork Metro Park, a park north of New Albany that opened in August 2015, features more than three miles of walking trails, a bridle trail, a dog park, an off-leash trail for dogs, a play area and a large picnic shelter where you can sit in Adirondack chairs and look for wildlife in the open fields.\n\nFor more on Willoughby Dayton Miller, see “An Ohio Boy: Willoughby Dayton Miller,” an article by Donald F. Bowers in the May-June 2004 issue of the Ohio Historical Society’s TIMELINE.\n\nThe first thing I admired about Ed Shevlin was his hefty right forearm, all tatted up with the most magnificent portrait of Saint Patrick, Celtic knots and a proud declaration of the Irish word “Saoirse,” which means “freedom.”\n\nTo someone whose right forearm is tatted out with shamrocks and Celtic swirls — but just on Halloween and Saint Patrick’s Day — this love of our shared ancestry brings new meaning to wearing your heart on your sleeve.\n\nBut the more important thing about Mr. Shevlin is what he’s accomplished, both during and after his career in public service. Not long ago, this husky, cigar-smoking man was a New York City sanitation worker who spoke Gaelic to the locals as he hauled away their trash along his route in the Rockaways in Queens. In his down time, he participated in Irish-American cultural events, worked toward a bachelor’s degree in Irish studies, and studied Irish, both at home and abroad. Now that he’s retired, he’s pursing a graduate degree in Irish and Irish-American studies, and he’s writing about an Irish republican from the Rockaways who fought for Irish independence in the 1916 Easter Rising. No wonder the New York Times chose to profile him first in 2011 (complete with a must-see video) and again this past March.\n\nIt’s time to pay tribute to people like Mr. Shevlin who have chosen to spend their careers serving the public. Welcome to the first day of Public Service Recognition Week, the annual celebration during the first week of May that honors federal, state, county and local government employees.\n\nFor those of us who help to provide public employees with a secure retirement, celebrating public service is something we do every day. But in 2000, the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio developed some special ways to honor Ohio’s public educators that continue to have meaning today.\n\nTo celebrate its 80th anniversary that year, STRS developed Discovery Park, an area at its headquarters that stretches alongside South 5th Street, between East Broad and East Oak Streets.\n\nWater features and an abundance of gingko trees make Discovery Park a very pleasant place to visit, especially during a lunch hour on a beautiful day — once the fountains are turned on for the season.\n\nThe park’s most recognizable feature is its “Journey to Learning” statue. Sculpted by George Danhires, an STRS member, the statue celebrates the relationship between students and their teachers. The wall, blocks, numbers and letters incorporated into the piece stand for the challenges children face as they develop an understanding of the fundamental concepts of learning. Students are depicted accepting the challenges that come with learning, with teachers standing by to help and encourage them in their educational journey.\n\nLook around and there’s plenty to see, but what really matters lies under your feet. Take a closer look at the bricks on the ground and you’ll see that they’re inscribed with the names of thousands of former and current STRS members who have served the public by helping others discover the joy and the value of learning. The brick contributed by my mother, Suzanne Heinmiller Butler, a Columbus Public Schools Kindergarten teacher for 40 years, is located in section D of the park.\n\nThe park was dedicated on August 27, 2000. Here’s my mother posing with her brick at the dedication.\n\nTwo more Downtown features celebrate the value of public service through teaching. For its 75th anniversary, STRS members and retirees commissioned two bronze bas-relief statues in the Map Room of the Ohio Statehouse. Both reliefs were created by George Danhires of Kent, Ohio, and dedicated in November 1995.\n\nOne relief depicts a teacher reading with her students in a one-room schoolhouse. Spencerian script, a copy of Ray’s Arithmetic and a McGuffey Reader, all products of Ohio, are in the background. A list of presidents from Ohio appears on the chalkboard.\n\nThe other portrays a modern classroom scene in which students receive instruction in social studies. A teacher in the background signs the words “to learn” in recognition of the nation’s first state school for the deaf founded in Ohio in 1829. The background celebrates the achievements of Ohioans, including astronauts Neil Armstrong, from Wapakoneta, and John Glenn, from New Concord, as well as Dayton aviators Orville and Wilbur Wright.\n\nPublic Service Recognition Week officially ends on May 7, but there’s no expiration date for showing your appreciation of the public servants you know.\n\nIn March 1980, we joined the throng that flocks to Granville during one April weekend for the annual Granville Garden Club Daffodil Show.\n\nThe show has been a spring tradition since 1945, when the Granville Garden Club decided to cheer up their fellow villagers, all weary from World War II. Club members picked 94 different specimens of daffodils, placed them in bottles down the center of the Granville Public Library’s reading room, put daffodil arrangements in the windows, and invited Granville residents to see the free display. The show has moved to different locations around town, but its purpose remains constant – to encourage the study of classification, hybridization, planting and arrangement of daffodils.\n\nThis year, we revived our family tradition and attended the 71st Annual Granville Garden Club Daffodil Show at Bryn Du.\n\nThere, we studied the rare specimens of the over 400 varieties of daffodils that bloom in Granville…\n\nand admired the creative arrangements of Granville-grown daffodils made by Garden Club members.\n\nThe show’s theme — A Midsummer Night’s Dream – A Greener Earth — encouraged attendees to practice and enjoy the beauty of sustainable gardening. Information sheets were provided on attracting birds, bees and butterflies to a garden, as well as how to create your own herbicides and pest repellants easily and inexpensively.\n\nAfter strolling through Shakespeare’s Enchanted Wood, we entered the mansion’s large living room, which features mahogany trim, a medallioned ceiling and bookcases filled with examples of all sorts of tantalizing early-20th century bookbindings. The walls were adorned with hand-lettered banners with quotations from Shakespeare plays, such as “When daffodils begin to peer, why then comes in the sweetness of the year,” from Act IV, Scene II of The Winter’s Tale.\n\nCharming miniature flower arrangements were displayed on deep windowsills.\n\nIn one room devoted to fairy gardens, a couple of winged fairies channeled Titania and Oberon as they served complimentary homemade cookies and chilled spa water flavored with raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and cucumbers. Other club members took orders for daffodil bulbs that will be available for pickup in October for fall planting. This year’s show specials included Barrett Browning, Grower’s Pride, Brooke Ager, Puppet, Blushing Lady, Tristar, Wisley, x odorus Linnaeus, Candy Princess and Geranium daffodil varieties.\n\nChildren gathered on the patio to make a wreath of silk flowers to wear on their heads. Adults joined them to select six daffodils and tie a peach-colored satin ribbon around them to make a complimentary take-home bouquet.\n\nAttending the show also gave us the long-awaited opportunity to explore Bryn Du, the historic Granville landmark that we have only been able to admire from afar.\n\nThe property on which the mansion stands was originally known as Fort Hill in 1805. Henry D. Wright, a local general store owner, originally built an Italianate villa on the 52-acre site in 1865, using sandstone quarried from the property. Several other owners followed, including John Sutphin Jones, a successful executive in the railroad and coal industries who purchased the property in 1905. Jones hired Columbus architect Frank Packard to renovate the mansion into a Georgian Federal-style home, construct several outbuildings and create a 32-acre polo field across the front of the site. Jones christened his home Bryn Du, meaning “Black Hills” in Welsh, recalling how the hills behind the house were the source of its sandstone walls. Calvin Coolidge, William Howard Taft, Warren Harding, Lillian Gish, Paderewski and Rachmaninoff all visited Jones at his home.\n\nJones added quite a bit of land to his prosperous farm. It included a dairy herd well known for the quality of its milk.\n\nAfter Jones died in 1927, his daughter, Sallie Jones Sexton, inherited the property. She preferred breeding and showing horses to operating the firm. In 1976, facing debts estimated at $1.6 million, Sexton divided and sold Bryn Du Farm at a sheriff’s sale. The 52-room mansion was renovated into a restaurant in 1979; ten years later, it became the headquarters of Quest International. Dave Longaberger purchased it in 1995, renovating the estate to include game courts and field house facilities until his death in 1999. In 2002, the village of Granville purchased the property to use for community events.\n\nWatch the Granville Garden Club’s website for information about next year’s Daffodil Show and other upcoming events.\n\nI turned the doorknob of the fanlighted side door of the elegant building at 221 East Broadway in Granville, and a lady rushed up to greet us as we walked in. “Are you here for a tour?,” she asked excitedly, then hurried to the foot of the stairs and called for a backup docent.\n\nShe scampered back to a group of several other visitors in the next room who were standing spellbound as they turned little sticks topped with paper circles. An equally enthusiastic guide whisked us through to the front hall, and our tour began.\n\nStanding underneath a cobalt blue-and-white glass light fixture at the foot of a curving staircase following the form of William Hogarth’s Line of Beauty, we discovered that we were in a home built by Alfred Avery in 1842. Today, the home is considered one of the finest examples of Greek Revival architecture in the nation. The historic house museum is furnished with 18th and 19th century decorative arts acquired by the original owners, as well as collectors.\n\nThree years after Avery built his 27-room house, he sold it to his cousin, Sylvester Spelman, a local doctor. The home remained a private residence until 1903, when a Denison University fraternity acquired it. In 1956, Robbins Hunter, Jr., an antiques aficionado, made it his home until his death in 1979. His will provided for his home to become the Robbins Hunter Museum in 1981.\n\nOne room to the front of the house served as Dr. Spelman’s office, with its own exterior door for patients to use. Here, we learned about the revolutionary whale oil lamp, with a round wick and round chimney that fostered a flame that burned nine times brighter than a candle. We also heard about the horrors of patent medicine, those potent, powerful concoctions of turpentine, camphor, ammonia, cloves, sassafras and at least 50 percent alcohol.\n\n“Can you see Dr. Spelman talking with a patient as they sit in these chairs? I can!,” our guide exclaimed.\n\nIn the parlor, we got the message that Dr. Spelman wanted to tell us loud and clear. Expensive lamps, a beautiful clock made in Lancaster, Ohio and a rug woven in England were all designed to reveal how wealthy and accomplished his family was to visitors who attended teas, parties and weddings in this room.\n\n“Can you see the Spelmans and their guests singing around the Christmas tree? I can!,” our guide exclaimed.\n\nThe enthusiasm that the docents had for this terrific place was contagious. Before long, I was as hyped up as they were. What did it was what I saw in the ladies’ parlor.\n\nIn this bright room, Mrs. Spelman and her daughter entertained their friends over tea and needlework. As I surveyed my surroundings, I noticed several handwork projects that made my fingers itch to make some myself.\n\nA penwiper in the form of a beaded butterfly rested on the desk in front of the window. A watch pocket intended to hang beside a bed and keep a watch safe overnight sat beside a compact fashioned from shells and a pair of small embroidered felt shoes. All were made from actual patterns printed in Godey’s Lady’s Book, the popular women’s magazine that was a fixture in the Victorian-era home. Since our guide was the creator of these wonderful things, out came pictures of more sensational projects from Godey’s pages. Toothpick holders made from lobster claws! Ornamental stars made from fish scales!\n\nI dragged myself away, pausing to gasp over a Gothic Revival Berlinwork child’s chair, and made my way to the sitting room, where the Spelmans congregated to read aloud from classics like Gulliver’s Travels, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, A Christmas Carol and The Scarlet Letter.\n\n“Can you hear them reading these books to each other? Can you see them? I can!,” our guide exclaimed.\n\nWhat I saw were those curious little sticks topped with paper circles. Thaumatropes! Based on the scientific principle of the persistence of vision, a disk with a picture on each side is attached to the stick. When the stick is twirled quickly between the fingers, the two pictures appear to blend together into one.\n\nNext, I spotted a stereoscope, which transforms a pair of separate images depicting left-eye and right-eye views of the same scene into one three-dimensional image. And then…a magic lantern! Used to project scenes drawn by hand on small glass plates known as lantern slides, a magic lantern casts the enlarged image on a flat surface. I’ve loved those things ever since discovering a collection of hand-tinted lantern slides of American gardens at the Library of Congress. Photographer Frances Benjamin Johnston used them to illustrate the lectures that she gave to garden club members, museum audiences and horticultural societies from 1915 through the 1930s. Click here to see them.\n\nStill hyperventilating over thaumatropes and lantern slides, we collected ourselves enough to move to the next stop on our tour: the Octagon Room. Robbins Hunter thought that every Greek Revival house needed one of these, and he outdid himself on it.\n\nThe room features a stained glass window from a church in Gambier, gilded brackets from a Mount Vernon home, and Palladian windows that began life at the Maramor Restaurant in Columbus. It appears as it might have been when Mr. Hunter lived here. A banjo clock and Ohio-made side chairs complement a box of items he purchased at auction that rests on his work table, alongside auction catalogues and other artifacts of his trade. A Harris Tweed hat like he always wore hangs on the coat rack with his umbrella.\n\nRemembering to take some deep, calming breaths, I moved to the museum’s special events room. There, I found a watercolor that one of my heroes, Ralph Fanning, an Ohio State University history professor, painted of the home in 1944.\n\nAs I tried to pull myself together, our guide described the big plans under way outside. The museum is in the midst of creating three historic gardens representing three periods of significance to the house. It includes a Greek Revival performance pavilion, as well as 5,000 daffodils, so that it can become a sanctioned American Daffodil Society display garden.\n\n“What time is it?,” our guide suddenly asked. “When it’s 3:oo, we’ve got to get outside!”\n\nI started hyperventilating again as we scurried out the door. This is what I had come to see.\n\nOn the west exterior wall of the museum, above the side door, you’ll find the only monument in the United States to America’s first female presidential candidate. A hand-carved statue of Victoria Woodhull glides out of the tower of a fabulous restored clock on the side of the museum’s building every hour, on the hour, from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm. After the clock rings, the Festive Day organ processional, composed by Dan Mitchell in 2013, announces Victoria’s appearance.\n\n“Celebrating Victoria, The First Woman to Run for President,” the museum’s special exhibit for 2016, traces Victoria’s life.\n\nBorn in the Licking County, Ohio community of Homer on September 23, 1838, the seventh of Buckman and Roxanna Claflin’s ten children had a rocky start in life, despite being named for the newly crowned Queen Victoria. The family’s scant supply of money came from performing odd jobs, telling fortunes and selling a potent mixture of alcohol, laudanum, herbs and molasses called “Life Elixir.” In 1847, Mr. Claflin insured a gristmill that he owned, but never operated, which then mysteriously caught fire and burned to the ground. Not long after, he disappeared, and his Homer neighbors organized a fundraiser so that the rest of the family would also disappear.\n\nBefore Victoria turned 16, she married Dr. Channing Woodhull. Two more husbands followed. In 1868, she and her sister, Tennessee, moved to New York City, where they told fortunes and pushed magnetic healing. One of their customers was Cornelius Vanderbilt, who gave them enough money to start a stockbrokerage firm. They also began their own magazine, in which they called for equal rights for women. Victoria’s zeal for women’s suffrage and equal rights led her to run for president in 1872 with abolitionist Frederick Douglass. She lost the election to Ulysses S. Grant. In 1877, she moved to England and spent the rest of her life there until she died in 1927.\n\nWhile music from Song of the Suffragettes, a CD from Smithsonian Folkways, played, we discovered information about Victoria’s presidential campaign platform, read newspaper articles about her, and scanned her biographies, including The Terrible Siren, published a year after her death, and more recent works like Other Powers: The Age of Suffrage, Spiritualism, and the Scandalous Victoria Woodhull, by Barbara Goldsmith, and The Renegade Queen, a new work of historical fiction by Eva Flynn.\n\nBefore we left, we collected our complimentary “Celebrating Victoria” button…\n\nthen wandered next door to the Granville Public Library, where more displays of archival materials and circulating books about Victoria await.\n\nAt neighboring Alfie’s Wholesome Food, we could purchase this clever commemorative tee shirt.\n\nSpecial exhibit programming taking place at the museum includes “To Judge Her By Her Heart: Victoria C. Woodhull,” on Thursday, May 12 at 7:00 pm, and “The Dilemma of Sex: The Free Love Debate Within Victoria Woodhull’s Writings,” on Thursday, October 6 at 7:00 pm.\n\nFor more on Victoria Woodhull, see my friend Lisa Wood’s article, “Suffrage, Spiritualism and Scandal,” in the November/December 2020 issue of the Ohio History Connection’s Echoes magazine.\n\nThe Robbins Hunter Museum is open Wednesday through Saturday from 1:00 to 4:00 pm. Admission is free. It offers an annual antiques show in September, followed by December open houses for the public to admire its holiday decorations."
