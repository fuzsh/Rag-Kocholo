But I try not to write about the buildings as if I'm a tour guide reciting lines from a script . L ike many of Greenfield Village's own presenters, I like to go the extra mile when I write and bring out the building's past in such a way that when you visit it , you will look at it with a different mindset...with a different set of eyes that will bring it to life. I'm hoping for the same for this week&"
