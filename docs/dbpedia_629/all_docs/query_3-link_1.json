It is a copy of the original marble statue made by French sculptor, Jean Antoine Houdon.\n\nHavighurst Special Collections\n\nKing Library houses The Walter Havighurst Special Collections, containing over 95,000 historical, literary, and cultural items. The collection includes the archives of Miami University, Western College, and Oxford College.\n\nOxford Museum Association\n\nThe Oxford Museum Association is a non-profit organization committed to the conservation and demonstration of nineteenth and early-twentieth century agricultural life in southwest Ohio.\n\nPatterson Place Museum\n\nThe former home of the presidents of Western College houses the offices of the Western College Alumnae Association, Inc. and the Patterson Place Museum. The Museum collection includes paintings, furniture and other artifacts.\n\nSmith Library of Regional History\n\nThe Smith Library of Regional History collects information on the history of Oxford, surrounding townships, all of Butler County, and other areas of the Miami River Valleys.\n\nUniversity Archives\n\nThe Miami University Archives chronicles University's history, administrative business, and teaching activities.
