How about our free demo days? ​We also like to participate in community activities in all three of our locations.\n\nCharlottesville - Art on Ivy\n\nCheck out our previous shows\n\nRhonda Roebuck\n\nFeatured artist in Charlottesville Gallery\n\nRhonda Roebuck retired from teaching art and photography in Albemarle County Schools and lives in Greenwood. She grew up in Alabama and received Master of Fine Arts from the University of Alabama. \"My work consists of collages with some painting and drawing added. This work is about collecting items that interest me over a long time period. The pieces don’t have any hidden meanings other than what you might read into them. I have simply decided what makes a good combination, a good design, and what looks right to me. The search for objects to use is as important as creating the piece. Sometimes images and objects can sit around for years before they make it into an artwork.”\n\nDecember 2019 - Charlottesville\n\n​\"A Mind of Seasons\" paintings by Linda Verdery\n\nArtist Statement: I try to reach beyond my eye alone to respond to a subject's mood, atmosphere or even narrative. Sometimes favorite objects or places suggest memories I wish to hold on to. For landscapes, I only paint places I know well. Abstracts come from a perception that is distilled. Stylistically, I let the subject determine the approach. Starting with knives, I apply large swaths of color and then plan the color notes and opening gestures. I draw and redraw, scrape and scrub. My process seems to require missteps and I enjoy the redos, letting the act of painting just take over. In my studio are always three or four paintings in process and more are left to face the wall.\n\nDecember 2019-Crozet\n\n\"The Quiet of Nature\" by Tom Tartaglino\n\nArtist Statement: Today we have more distractions than ever. We cannot drive our cars without the cell phone going off. We spin about controlled by our phones, social media, streaming news flashes and noise. We are being stressed like never before and it seems difficult to change our trajectory.\n\nBut there is Nature. Nature who can calm us down and defrag us with her beauty and acceptance. Coming back to nature is being centered. You remember it from before technology. You remember that you liked walking in the woods, discovering a new plant, hearing a new bird. You like when the woods bloom in spring and the fragrance travels on the wind. It makes you quiet again.\n\nCreativity happens when we are quiet. It is an in-the-moment activity, a meditation. It is where inspiration is born. where an ordinary object becomes fascinating. Where the shadow of a tree has a whole world inside it. Where animals have personalities and magic becomes possible.\n\nApril, May, June 2019 - Crozet\n\nScarborough Fair work by Hannah Chiarella\n\nArtist Statement: My work tries to reconcile the disorder of nature and the rigid order of graphic design. I try to recreate, yet re-imagine, the beauty of natural textures and inspiration in modern and geometric compositions. I am especially interested in art nouveau and how historic depictions of nature can continue to be reshaped for a more contemporary world.\n\nMarch 2019 - Crozet\n\n\"Looking West\" a collection of plein air paintings from national parks by Deliece Blanchard\n\nDrawing on her education in biology and music, Lynchburg artist Deliece Blanchard, uses elements of rhythm and lyrical shapes, along with a sharp observation of the landscape in her plein air paintings. This show features work created in Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado where Deliece often paints while her husband Fred, fly-fishes. A fellowship at the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts in Amherst, VA, gave Deliece an opportunity to make large paintings from these small plein air studies. Her prize-winning work has been shown throughout Virginia.\n\n“My 24-year career as a cellist, strings teacher, and orchestra director in the Lynchburg public schools was integral to my development as an artist, and taught me to cherish the creative spirit in all people. I am really happy to be painting full-time now. It’s a lot like being a kid again.”\n\nDecember 2018/January 2019 - Crozet\n\nIllustrations by Amy Mullen\n\nAmy Mullen is a self-taught digital illustrator living in Arlington, Virginia. She graduated from Sweet Briar College with a BA in Dance and a minor in English & Creative Writing. In 2009, Amy created Mint Parcel, a line of affordable art prints for kids featuring animals, monsters, pop culture figures and famous literary characters. She is a member of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, and has an affection for all things related to the children’s illustration market. Amy is the author/illustrator of several children's books, including the Naturally Local series from duopress. These board books explore the colors, wildlife, and vegetation of different regions of the United States.\n\nOctober 2018 - Crozet\n\nVirginia original silkscreen images by Frederick Nichols\n\nFrom the artist: \"My work is concerned with beauty and the picturesque landscape: the clear, blue day that warms the soul; the waterfall that flows with sound and movement; the peacefulness of an afternoon stream; the colors of a tree changing seasons.\"\n\nHis work features iconic Virginia landscapes, with beautiful scenes from Farmington, the Blue Ridge, James River, and elsewhere.\n\nSeptember 2018 - Crozet\n\nWhimsical illustrations by Nancy Atkins based on children's books by local author Helen Williamson\n\nArt on the Trax featured illustrations and assemblage by Nancy Atkins who illustrates books by local author Helen Williamson. The Art Box showcased illustrations from four of Helen Williamson's children's books as well as inspired mixed media art work from Nancy Atkins.\n\nAugust 2018 - Crozet\n\n\"Summer018\" by William H. Atwood\n\nIn his words: \"Born in downtown Miami, in a neighborhood rich in diversity and violence, my mother kept me busy every day making scrapbooks full of patterns created by cutting pieces out of magazines and pasting them together. Today I see patterns everywhere, mostly in nature but really everywhere. I call mans interaction with these patterns the human dilemma.\"\n\nJuly 2018 - Crozet\n\n“Where We Belong” by Judith Ely\n\nJudith Ely, Charlottesville area artist presents abstracted landscapes in acrylics. Her intention is to leave much open for the viewer to decide. Enjoy the outdoor scenes and the whimsy that goes along with them.\n\nJune 2018 - Crozet\n\n“Nesting In II” Mixed Media by Nancy Spahr\n\nFrom the artist: These bird nest paintings celebrate the cycle of avian parenthood, which is condensed into a much shorter time frame than humans – four to seven weeks from constructing the nest, to embryo, to fledgling. Ready for flight!My nest works use tar along with oil paints, plus added textures of natural and found materials, often from old bird nests.\n\nMay 2018 - Crozet\n\n​“the delight is in the surprise” by Christen Yates\n\nChristen's paintings explore our relationship with the surrounding landscape using loose and suggestive strokes that imply an immediacy of encounter within which she wants the viewer to linger. Her current show records her attention to and delight of the land and animals in and around White Hall. Christen lives and works by the mountains on Sugar Hollow Road with her husband, four kids and flock of hens.\n\nApril 2018 - Crozet\n\n\"Tracy's Folly\" Painting + Printmaking Series by Tracy Night\n\n​Born and raised in Charlottesville, with a Canadian heritage, Tracy Knight grew up surrounded by art and creativity. Painting has been in her family for many generations. Working with colors, whether it is canvas or fabric, has always been a passion for Knight. The essence of color is the foundation of her work. Inspired by her love of the ocean, clouds and her mother’s gardens, Knight works primarily with pastel colors. Experimenting with different techniques and mediums to bring colors to life, she expresses nature in abstract form.\n\nMarch 2018 - Crozet\n\n“Flight: Watercolors by Phil Radcliffe”\n\nThe wonder of flight, combining an affection for aircraft and adventure with a love of nature, Phillip Radcliffe paints what captures his imagination. Detailed war planes soar over dramatic clouds contrasting machining marvels with natural beauty. Birds isolated on flat backgrounds showcase these incredible flying animals. Rendered with watercolor and pen and ink the work showcases an attention to composition and a respect for the subject matter.\n\nFebruary 2018 - Crozet\n\n“American Icons” by Carrol Mallin\n\nMallin has come to painting late in life, during her retirement from careers in psychotherapy and the Episcopal ministry. Color is what captures her most. She chooses to work in acrylics because of the vividness of their color. In floral and still life paintings she has especially enjoyed the many things acrylics can do with additives such as molding paste and gels. In the last several years Mallin has been involved in paintings themed on social justice. In these, she intends to convey an understanding of the disadvantaged or discriminated against who sometimes seem alien or frightening.\n\nAs Georgia O’Keefe said, “I found I could say things with color that I couldn’t say any other way – things I have no words for.”\n\nJanuary 2018 - Crozet\n\n“Wearing Nature” by Sarah Tremaine“\n\nWearing Nature” is a show of hand made clothing and accessories made of wool, silk and gathered plant materials. Garments and accessories create a forest of items available for personal adornment. In her beautiful fiber work, Tremaine applies the techniques of wet felting, eco-printing and hand dyeing; and uses local plant materials to create eco-prints (botanical prints) and natural dyes on a variety of natural fibers. Surface design is built in layers of abstract and discernable patterns, reflecting back on their material origins and creating endlessly unique textures, colors and patterns. All of her work is inspired by the ever changing beauty of nature: Inspired by Nature, Made by Hand.\n\nDecember 2017 - Crozet\n\n\"Verdant Melody\" by Nancy Campa\n\nFrom the artist: “My painting takes its inspiration from my surroundings. I am drawn to nature and its natural beauty—the trees, the lay of the land. The Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains is where we have our home.\n\nI start my paintings from direct observation outdoors, looking at what is capturing my attention—the light, shapes, color and line will all play into my composition. From there, I begin to translate what I have selected into my own artistic expression.”\n\nNovember 2017 - Crozet\n\nBlue Ridge & Beyond\" A Show of Works by Six Plein Air Painters\n\nJulie Farrell, Patricia Hobbs, Katharine March, Barbara Phillips, Debra Sheffer, and Peg Sheridan\n\nThis show is a collection of works completed \"en plein air\" by a group of friends from Staunton, who love to paint outside. They paint once a week in the Staunton/Augusta County area, usually on Wednesday evenings starting around 5:30 or 6:00 pm, and then painting for a couple of hours. All are in agreement that it has become one of the best parts of the week and has helped them to become better painters. Most times, they finish their paintings before the evening is over. Because the light is ever-changing, especially in the evening, one must paint quickly and decisively.\n\nOctober 2017 - Crozet\n\n\"Evocations” by Linda Verdery\n\nFrom the Artist: I've come to painting after a career as a writer and teacher of Literature where Voice matters. Voice seems essential to painting as well. The natural world speaks in its various seasons and moods. These Evocations respond to the seasons: the bouyant light and blanketed calm of winter snows, Autumn's mute fog or sanguine fields, Spring's quaking greens, Summer's call to look close and far. And sometimes a clutch of flowers that simply say, Glad to be alive.\n\nSeptember 2017 - Crozet\n\n\"An Exhibition of Chair Drawings\" by Joe Sheridan Born in Albemarle County and now a resident of Waynesboro Virginia, Joe Sheridan is an craftsman, artist, teacher and curator.
