        "text": "January 1\n\nAs the new millennium (in popular opinion if not technically) begins, Columbus welcomes its first ever black mayor, Michael Coleman, the rare politician who seems to be mostly respected by both sides. His term officially begins today. Like billions of others, I remember quite well where I was as the clock hit midnight on 1/1/00...and was disappointed to learn, when someone pointed this out to me a couple hours prior, that nothing was going to \"happen\" with this Y2K computer glitch nonsense, because it had already turned midnight in other time zones. Talk about a major plot spoiler.\n\nHoliday In Lights at Griggs Reservoir is open for the last time this season, at a reasonable $7 per car load.\n\nJanuary 6\n\nFats Billiard Emporium has Season's End performing\n\nJanuary 7\n\nMen Of Leisure are at Fats\n\nJanuary 9\n\nThe Sawmill Road franchise of Borders hosts its first session of what is billed as \"Sorcerer's School\" at 3pm. This is a Harry Potter themed club, meeting monthly, and this time around attendees will be making magic wands, chowing down on snacks, and discussing the books themselves. An appearance by someone playing Professor Dumbledore is promised as well.\n\nJanuary 10\n\nCity council decides to rescind a contract it has signed with OPI (Ohio Prison Industries) to remove asbestos from Ohio School for the Blind. It seems that OPI, who provide cheap labor in the form of prison inmates, were in violation of a city ordinance requiring that prevailing wages are paid for a project such as this.\n\nJanuary 12\n\nThe Afro-Rican Ensemble play at Gibby's Riverview Dublin from 7-11pm.\n\nJanuary 13\n\nDel's Bread owner Del Sroufe discusses \"How We Are Building a Vegan Community,\" at the Community Resource Center, at 14 West Lakeview.

For details about this and other happenings, click the date.\n\nFor a complete rundown of High 5's events for the year, please visit that page (link directly above).\n\nJanuary 16\n\nColumbus Symphony Orchestra musicians John & Mindy Ewing are playing for free at the North Market. This is part of the \"Music + Market\" series, currently held on the 3rd Sunday of every month. Columbus Children's Theatre presents The Three Little Pigs. Some creature called Bunnicula foists itself on unsuspecting patrons, at the Sawmill Road Borders. Dr. Alexandra Shecket Korros visits the Agudas Achim Synagogue, delivering a history lesson on \"The Pale,\" a Jewish region under Tsarist Russia. Matt Avery is at White Horse Saloon. At the all new C Note Lounge, Lawrence Winfield is playing as part of the whole \"jazz every Sunday\" concept.\n\nJanuary 17\n\nThe King Arts Complex hosts an open house celebration for Martin Luther King, Jr., on this national holiday named in his honor. There are theatre performances, an exhibition of Elijah Pierce's works in the gallery bearing his own name, and still another exhibition titled The Power Of One. Naturally, there are numerous MLK photos on display, as well as a documentary playing throughout the day.\n\nJanuary 18\n\nWild Oats Market on Lane Avenue welcomes very special guest Dr. Susan Richards, to discuss principles of a healthy holistic lifestyle. At Pearls Of Wisdom on North High Street, Jacquelin Smith explains \"How Our Attitudes and Feelings Affect Animals.\" Some sort of comedic one man show called The Male Intellect: An Oxymoron? hits the Southern Theatre, for a run that will continue through the 30th.\n\nJanuary 19\n\nD. Patrick S. Osmer, Chair of OSU's Astronomy Dept., explains what we know about the universe/origins of man. First Unitarian Universalist Church on Weshemier Road.\n\nGraeme Boone discusses \"Architecture & Counterpoint in the Fifteenth Century) at OSU's Sullivant Hall, Music/Dance Library\n\nJanuary 20\n\n\"Preparing for the 21st Century,\" a lecture by Jerry Saunders and wife Gayle Saunders, is held at noon at the King Arts Complex.\n\nJanuary 21\n\nWexner Center's two part German film series concludes with The Student of Prague and Waxworks.\n\nJanuary 23\n\nDave Power & The Power House Trio are at C Note Lounge.\n\nJanuary 27\n\nCalifornia Fitness Centers are hosting \"pre-grand opening celebrations\" at three locations around town. Visitors who take the tour are entered in a drawing for $500 cash.\n\nJanuary 28\n\nAs reported by The Other Paper, a brand new club on Chambers Road, Millennium, has to fork over $1500 because its \"valet parking\" crew is depositing clubgoers' cars in the Lennox Town Center lot - which is then having them towed.\n\nHigher Ground, which is some kind of head shop meets local art gallery, hosts a grand opening for this space they're calling \"Half Tone Gallery.\" According to local free monthly Chickenhead, turnout is robust, with DJ Prism providing a live hip-hop soundtrack in the background.\n\nJanuary 29\n\nTerry Davidson and the Gears are playing at Shorty's. Damon and I catch some of the show in our travels.\n\nVeranda, a store in Bexley selling imported goods such as furniture, antiques, and jewelry, hosts its grand opening party.\n\nJanuary 30\n\nBobby Floyd plays at the C Note Lounge\n\nJanuary 31\n\nBill Moss from the Columbus Board of Education drops by North Linden Elementary to read I Know I Can to its second graders.

Either that or just hang out. But they are definitely holding a contest to win a handcrafted guitar, autographed by the band! Or, you could go see Beck at Veterans Memorial. I feel like this is a fairly easy call.\n\nFebruary 3\n\nFamed director Richard Linklater shows up at the Wexner Center, the first of two nights here. He answers questions and shows clips for a couple of hours, even chats with fans for an eternity in the lobby.\n\nHoo Doo Soul Band are playing at the Columbus Museum of Art, as part of the \"1st Thursdays\" series. The show runs from 5-9pm. As for the museum itself, among the features now are \"Artificial Reality: Soviet Photography 1930-1987\" and \"Object Lessons: Selections from the Robert J. Shiffler Foundation.\"\n\nOver at Alrosa Villa, there's a jam packed bill on tap: The Cro-Mags, All Out War, The Creeps, Final Summons, Shutdown.\n\nBarrister Hall has the Afro-Rican Ensemble. Kim Pensyl Trio are at the Bexley Monk. Shuckin' Bubba Deluxe play Braddock's Grandview.\n\nDance Night at the Newport Music Hall. Rather than list every single event here, please visit that page for a rundown of their happenings.\n\n2Co's Cabaret, an offshoot of Shadowbox, opens its doors at 790 N. High Street. They will have food and drink service to the tables, while the focus at this location will be more dramatic than comedic. This satellite operation will share talent with Shadowbox, which moved to Easton in the summer of ‘99. They open without a stage and with the interior not quite complete. Upstairs is an art gallery – for the first month, photographer Eileen Wolford is featured. Opening night includes a one act play titled Neitzsche Ate Here along with poetry readings and live music.\n\nAll of this, on a day where a major snowstorm hits, quite naturally.\n\nFebruary 4\n\nDay two of the Linklater experience. Tonight they show his film Before Sunrise, after which, according to The Other Paper, he drifted down to the High 5 and watched Cobra Verde play. Thomas Jefferson Slave Apartments opened that show, which is semi-notorious in its own right, as it was during this set that singer Ron House announced that they were breaking up. This appears to have been a spontaneous decision stemming from an onstage altercation with his own guitarist, Bob Petric. I can't help but wonder if Linklater had already arrived, and if he happened to catch any of this.\n\nDispute, 4 Stack, Ember 8, and In Black play the Alrosa Villa.\n\nOrchestraville are in town from Athens, OH, playing at Oldfield's on High. The band is reportedly so quiet that crowd conversation threatens to drown them out.\n\nFebruary 5\n\nWinter 2000 acting classes for adults begin at Catco, at a mere $125-$150 a pop. Fiddle maestro Regina Carter and her band tear up the Southern Theater stage.\n\nFebruary 6\n\nAt Karl Road's C Note Lounge, The Governor is playing.\n\nFebruary 8\n\nOhio State Board of Pharmacy commences day two of its three day conference, at the Vern Riffe Center on South High.\n\nCher is at the Schottenstein Center.\n\nOSU student Chico Ballard is murdered in his own apartment, at 328 E. 17th Avenue. It occurred sometime after 3am, after some friends who'd been over to visit Ballard left for the night. Based upon the crime scene, police believe that the attacker was already waiting in the basement, biding time until those people left. Then flipped the circuit breaker to shut off power to the apartment. At which point Ballard grabbed his own handgun and possibly a flashlight, entered the basement to investigate, then was shot 3 times before he even had a chance to respond. His assailant attempted setting the body on fire before fleeing the scene.\n\nThis case remains unsolved, although the cops have always believed they know who killed Chico. Pretty much from the outset they've focused on a cashier at the nearby BP station, with whom Ballard had apparently exchanged words on more than one occasion. This is especially chilling to me because when I was living on campus from '97-'98, we would always hit that gas station, particularly late at night, at the corner of Summit and 17th. The help there was a mixed bag, as you might expect from a neighborhood where you're still technically considered in the campus area, but on the edge of some seedier regions. One such late night cashier I remember was a harmless goober, a pleasant college age kid who worked there for quite some time; but then at the opposite end of the spectrum, after he left, they had this other guy who would lock the door at seemingly strange times - it later turned out he was sneaking off to shoot up heroin on the job.\n\nHe didn't last too long, so I doubt that's the suspect in question. Regarding their presumed murderer, shortly after Ballard was killed, it turns out that a detective in robbery discovered someone was attempting to use a stolen bank card at an ATM, only an hour or so after the shooting: a card belonging to Chico's girlfriend. They soon traced this effort back to the cashier at that BP, who claimed he had found the card on some steps in front of a bagel shop. And to date they have not been able to prove otherwise.\n\nFebruary 9\n\nWeird Al brings his singular brand of genius buffoonery to the Palace Theatre.\n\nFebruary 10\n\nContemporary Music Festival 2000 kicks off at Weigel Auditorium. Led by composers John Corigliano and Stephen Montague, this event claims to feature \"the best in contemporary music,\" although I'm not quite sure what this means. One of Montague's own pieces, Wild Nights, makes its U.S. debut, though there is also something referred to as a \"surrealistic bovine dreamscape.\" Your guess is as good as mine. But anyway, there are three concerts at Wiegel (one each from the 10th-12th) and a final show at the Mershon, 8pm on the 12th.\n\nOSUDance Winter Performance begins tonight at OSU's Sullivant Theatre, continuing through the 12th.\n\nOn the professional front, King Thompson hosts its latest Career Night for aspiring real estate kingpins, at 2700 Airport Dr.\n\nFebruary 11\n\nThe Wexner screens a double feature of Prathibha Parmar documentaries. The Righteous Babes (female musicians of the 1990s) followed by Jodie: An Icon (singing the praises of Jodie Foster) begins at 7pm.\n\nA Midsummer Night's Dream (ballet) kicks off at the Riffe Center's Capital Theatre, running through February 27th. I don't exactly know much about ballet, but the Dispatch singles out Peter Chamberlain's performance of Puck for praise.\n\nJohn May is at the Polaris area Barnes & Noble store. Brass Band of Columbus and the Central Ohio Brass Band both play at St. John's Church on East Mound Street.\n\nSebastian Bach is at Alrosa Villa, in a show the Dispatch will also profile at length. Local bands American Dog and Mr. Hyde open. Owner Rick Cautela's 86 year old dad, Albert, apparently still tends bar here, and has the best quote in the entire article: \"the rock n' roll, I don't like it,\" he says.\n\nTom Russell and Andy Hardin are at Columbus Music Hall. At the Ohio Theatre, Columbus Symphony Orchestra presents \"A Symphonic Valentine,\" which features Wagner, Berlioz, Faure & Ravel pieces. This one runs through the 13th.\n\nThomas Jefferson Slave Apartments play what is billed as their last show, at Little Brother's, opening for Scrawl. They had announced the breakup a week prior, but were already booked for this final gig. Please visit the Little Brother's page for a complete recap of the year.\n\nFebruary 12\n\nThough the site of former music venue Chelsie's has sat empty since December, a one-off Valentine's event is held here, an Erotic Art Show by some collective named Studio 243. There's poetry, live music from Circadian, and so forth.\n\nAuthor Delores Thornton is at the Martin Luther King Library (1pm) and Driving Park Library (3pm) to discuss her fiction writing career. Sandwiched in between these, at 2pm, local author and Alive columnist Pat Wynn Brown is performing a \"literary stand-up piece\" at the Kenny Road Borders.\n\nOne Cup At A Time on S. Yearling Road has it's Valentine's Day Bash, featuring musical guests Transcend.\n\nSpoleto Festival USA is held a Capital University's Mees Hall, a chamber music event featuring the works of Suk, Bartok, Schubert, Poulenc and Smetana.\n\nThe Big Creak are at Northberg Tavern.\n\nRenowned poet Amiri Baraka brings Black History Music to the King Arts Complex. Among many other highlights from his illustrious career, Baraka (formerly known as LeRoi Jones) rubbed elbows with all the famous Beats back in the day and was part of that whole scene. You can find mentions of him in many of Kerouac's works, for example, and he is one of the last living major figures from that era. Wow, and then The Stylistics, The Chi-Lites, and The Delphonics bring their package tour to the Palace Theatre. Both events are 8pm, so you've got to make some tough choices.\n\nAt the same time, Spoleto Festival USA Chamber Music Ensemble is ramping up at Capital University's Mees Hall. A little earlier, at 5:30pm, ProMusica Chamber Orchestra of Columbus plays J.S. Bach by Request at St. Turibius Chapel, then takes their act down to Southern Theatre a little later in the evening. Whew.\n\nFebruary 13\n\nJim Brickman, who is billed (by himself, anyway, or should I say his marketing team) as \"America's Romantic Piano Sensation,\" plays Palace Theatre. From noon to 6pm, there's a Borders Music Festival at the Sawmill Road location, featuring Clinton Rich, Bob Griffith and Michael Brown Jerome. At the Mees Auditorium, you can take in Capital University/Bexley Community Orchestra's Winter Concert. Columbus Children's Theatre, today and tomorrow, is holding open auditions for an upcoming musical production of Annie. IBADA plays the C Note Lounge.\n\nFebruary 14\n\nColumbus City Council gift wraps a very special valentine for the Campus Partners redevelopment squad. Though expressing some reservations, particularly council president Matt Habash, the CCC (an acronym I just made up) semi-reluctantly agree to authorize eminent domain for Campus Partners, in their quest to buy up block after block of south campus. A few pesky holdouts are holding up their plans of building a gigantic retail complex along High Street, but no longer. Councilwoman Charleta Tavares is the lone dissenter.\n\nOver at Millennium, they host a somewhat strange release party dedicated to the newest album from The Cure, Bloodflowers, which goes on sale at midnight. It's unclear whether there are any actual copies here for purchase, however.\n\nFebruary 15\n\nOver The Rhine plays an hour long live set (2:30-3:30pm) at World Record. They also open up for the Cowboy Junkies at the Newport, later this same night.\n\nFebruary 16\n\nBela Fleck and the Flecktones are at Mershon Auditorium. Columbus Jazz Orchestra plays a tribute to trumpeter Sweets Edison at Southern Theatre, a show which will run through the 20th.\n\nFebruary 17\n\nChitra Banerjee Divakaruni speaks at the Thurber House as part of its Evenings With Authors series, 7:30pm, at Columbus School For Girls' Shedd Theater.\n\nMartina McBride and Mark Wills are at Veteran's Memorial Auditorium.\n\nCannibal Corpse, Hate Eternal, God Dethroned bring the lite tunes n' rays of sunshine to Alrosa Villa. Okay, they are actually referring to this package as \"Death Metal Massacre 2000,\" which is pretty freaking awesome - I'm surprised Rob Zombie hasn't already used this in some capacity.\n\nFebruary 18\n\nIllusions Of Eden opens at Columbus Museum Of Art. This exhibit is focused upon the American Midwest and features the work of Hart Benton, Margaret Bourke-White, Malcolm Cochran, Maya Lin, Mary Lucier, Kerry James Marshall, Grant Wood and others.\n\nThe Stepford 5, Fabulous Johnson Brothers are at Oldfield's (the one on High Street, I think)\n\nMachinehead and Reveille are at Alrosa Villa\n\nFebruary 19\n\nOSU basketball player Brent Darby only takes four shots all game, each of them from 3 point range, and sinks them all.\n\nThe Why Store are at Ludlow's, with Blackwater opening.\n\nFebruary 21\n\nArnett Howard is playing out on the floor and Chef Charles Langstaff is in the kitchen.\n\nFebruary 22\n\nRent opens at the Palace Theatre and will run through the 27th.\n\nFebruary 24\n\nMayor Coleman delivers his first State of the City address.\n\nThe Bacon Brothers (famous actor Kevin and his bro Michael, who has won an Emmy as composer) perform at the Southern Theatre. Jeffrey Gaines opens.\n\nFebruary 25\n\nThe Count Basie Orchestra plays its first of two nights at Ohio Theatre. Cringe, which I believe is actually a Mansfield based band, throw a CD release party at Alrosa Villa. Bad Boy Bill, a DJ from Chicago, performs at Red Zone.\n\nFebruary 26\n\nQuite a day in the Cbus annals, yessiree...Queensryche are playing at Newport while Lynyrd Skynyrd (albeit with ZZ Top opening) bring endless guitar solos to the Schott. Does it seem like these two acts should be flip-flopped? I can't be the only person entertaining this thought.\n\nAbout halfway in between the two, presidential hopeful John McCain drops by the St. John Arena to give a speech. Attendance is pegged at about 2,000.\n\nClub 504 has what they're calling the \"ultimate light show in Columbus,\" with a special appearance by British DJ Jez Jonson. The ad also states that you can see the city skyline from their dance floor.\n\nWeightless Recordings, an indie hip-hop label, has a CD release party behind Roots Records, in honor of both Greenhouse Effect's Up To Speed and Illogic's Unforeseen Shadows. But in addition to these two, there's also a whole slew of performers, both local and from out of town: Aesop Rock, ATOMS Family, Bros. Grimm, Drastic, Lozone, MHz, Mista Rare Groove, Phaze, Prizm, and True Skillz complete, in alphabetical fashion, this insane lineup.\n\nFebruary 27\n\nCentral Presbyterian Church at 132 South 3rd Street presents \"The High-Street Four,\" a recital featuring Charles Wetherbee and David Niwa on violin, Kenichiro Matsuda on viola, and Trevor Handy on cello, with special guest Caroline Hong joining them on piano. They will perform Six Bagatells for String Quartet Op. 9 (Webern), Quartet in D minor Op. 76 No. 2 Fifth (Haydn) and Piano Quintent in A Major Op. 81 (Dvorak). Show starts 3pm and tickets are $10 for adults, $7 for students.\n\nMeanwhile, at Wild Oats, there's a wine sampling event featuring 50 different reds, including Freestone Cab Sauv, golfer Greg Norman's Cabernet Merlot, Allende, Duxoup '97 Syrah and so on. There's also live jazz music from Michael Arnold and \"wild\" appetizers. Tickets are $12 advance/$14 door.\n\nFebruary 28\n\nThe Handsome Family play at Bernie's Distillery.\n\nRather than clutter this timeline with every show held there for the year, however, I'm listing them in an events calendar on the page itself. So please head over there if you're curious what was happening at Bernie's in the year 2000 and before/beyond.\n\nMarch 1\n\nThough it's possible the Dispatch Charities Home and Garden Show was here for more than one day, G.A. Benton attends this particular one and reviews it for Alive. Held at the Expo Center, among the attractions is Gourmet Galaxy 2000. Held in the Bricker Building, if I'm reading this correctly, it's a series of cooking demonstrations presented by local chefs. Among these are Charles Langstaff of Fusion, and Travis Kawasaki of Strada's World Cuisine, assisted by this house manager Cheryl Roderheffer.\n\nMarch 2\n\nLibertys nightclub files for a Chapter 11 reorganization. This basically means that you are filing for bankruptcy, but are allowed to continue operating as a business anyway.\n\nAt the Riffe Center's Capitol Theatre, OSUDance Downtown runs from today through March 4th. Billed as \"dance at its best,\" it also features the OSU Jazz Ensemble playing original pop songs.\n\nMarch 3\n\nVolodos, who is billed as a \"Russian piano sensation\" (and here you thought that was an extinct animal) will be massaging the ivories at Southern Theatre.\n\nMarch 4\n\nMelissa's 21st birthday party, among other highlights. For details please click the date.\n\nMarch 5\n\nBuckeye Comic Con attacks a somewhat surprising location, the Holiday Inn on Roberts Road. Admission is only $2, with those 6 and under getting in free. There is also a free comic book handout to the first 25 people, and hourly drawings.\n\nA screening of the Hitchcock classic Rear Window at Wexner Center for the Arts.\n\nMarch 6\n\nThe irrepressible Arnett Howard plays a somewhat unusual gig, at Harold's Cajun Glory Cafe on Bethel Road.\n\nMarch 7\n\nFat Tuesday celebration at Harold's Cajun Glory Cafe.\n\nMarch 8\n\nAM radio station 1460 (a.k.a. \"The Fan\") has Blue Jackets general manager Doug MacLean on the air, alongside guest commentator Don Cherry, on its morning hockey show.\n\nAfro-Rican Ensemble play at Gibby's Riverside.\n\nMarch 9\n\nCanzani Center Gallery at CCAD has an opening reception for their exhibits The Object Considered: Contemporary Still Life In Ohio, Illinois and Indiana and Charles A. Csuri's In Search of Meaning, 1948-2000. These will both run from today through April 22nd.\n\nThe Other Paper's weekly basketball column, \"Hoop Scoop,\" announces its first ever PPS Award (points per shot) which averages how many points each OSU Buckeye basketball made per shot. Surprisingly, Brian Brown is at the top of the list, whereas the much more famous (and soon to be drafted) Michael Redd and Scoonie Penn are resoundingly middle of the pack. The columnists stress, however, that this is only a ceremonial award, to keep the NCAA from freaking out and \"executing him (Brown) at dawn.\"\n\nOn the local music front, Johnny Rebel is at Anydman's Treehouse. Afro-Rican Ensemble at Barrister Hall. Kim Pensyl Trio plays Bexley Monk. Conspiracy at Braddock's Grandview. The delightfully named Hootie McBoob at Break-a-way. Jack Widner at Clarmont Steakhouse.

Delyn Christian Trio at Rafter's Beer Pub. Richard Lopez Trio at Rigsby's. Matt Mahli at Shorty's. Chris Logsdon (was this a trio? I feel like the name \"Chris Logsdon Trio\" rings a bell. Even so, he may have been solo anyway) is at Signature's. Jeff Gurney at Tommy Keegan's. L.G. Scott at Top Steakhouse. As Is at Victory's, and Lloyd, One Man and His Music at VIP Lounge.\n\nFor national acts, we have The Chieftains at Palace Theatre.\n\nMarch 10\n\nStepping Out Superstore has its grand opening, 10am at Bethel Center. It seems this is primarily a beach attire store, though also featuring \"clubwear.\"\n\nToast and Fred Haring play Andyman's Treehouse. The highly accomplished trumpeter Pharez Whitted, who has recorded for Motown and played on a Mellencamp album, is at Barrister Hall. Bexley Monk has Dave Powers. Borders bookstore on Kenny Road, which somehow makes the \"clubs\" directory, has \"booked\" John Morgan, while the one on Sawmill has Kent Burnside playing. The Jack are at Break-a-way.

Milkbone Eddie are at Tommy Keegan's. Jerry Wolf at Top Steakhouse. Snow Shoe Crabs, a decent cover band, are at Victory's. Hurricane Alley at the Whiskey Still. Joe Dunlap plays the Worthington Inn. DJ Russell Carey is at Zuey's.\n\nBimbetta, a Baroque music five piece, are playing an intriguing show at Mees Auditorium - one which begins with a lecture, presumably by the band itself, half an hour before the performance. Columbus Symphony Orchestra is playing the \"Czech nationalistic work\" Smetna My Fatherland, and again on the 11th. Columbus Children's Theatre stages a performance of Bridge to Terabithia.

Over the course of this two day competition, Jason Smith (heavyweight) and Don Shruck (light heavyweight) take home the hardware, and are able to move on to the regionals.\n\nInsane Foo Fighters and Chili Peppers twin bill at the Schottenstein Center/Value City Arena. Looking at something like this in retrospect makes me wonder what it god's name else I could have possibly had going on this night, instead of being here. They even have Muse for an opening act. Yet, as it turns out, Dave Grohl is too ill to perform, so the Foo Fighters bow out anyway.\n\nOn the local music scene, The Grinders are at 501 Bar.

Stephen Slaybaugh gives the show a savage review in Columbus Alive, although he was impressed by opening act Travis.\n\nIn slightly less revolting news...10 cent Slyder night returns to Cooper Stadium! That's right, for the 7:15 Clippers game vs. Indianapolis, White Castle Slyders are just 10 cents apiece. I know this is a popular promotion and all, but the ad refers to these as \"delicious\" - this is going a bit too far. I mean who are we kidding, here.\n\nSummer classes begin at Franklin University.\n\nArnett Howard is at Harold's Cajun Glory Cafe.\n\nApril 25\n\nAs far as elsewhere around town...the most notable event happening today is maybe highly overrated throwback artist D'Angelo, performing at Palace Theatre, with Mos Def as an opening act.

Among the highlights is a party at French Fieldhouse. Police spokesperson Sherri Jones is quoted in Columbus Alive as saying, \"this is two days of people doing nothing but driving up and down High and Summit,\" and traffic is indeed a bit gnarly in this region over the weekend. Still, there are an impressive zero arrests on campus related to this event.\n\nLater, trumpeter Marlon Jordan plays with Pharez Whitted at Barristers Hall.\n\nMay 13\n\nAround town, Kiss are playing Polaris – Damon and Melissa attempt attending the show, even leave a message for me which I am not home to receive.\n\nMay 14\n\nHeritage Festival concludes with a noon Mother’s Day picnic on the Oval.\n\nMay 15\n\nIn other news…workers belonging to CWA Local 4501 get to speak before Columbus City Council.

Aside from the novelty of the site’s history, it also features an oddity in the form of an actual 19th hole (as opposed to the clubhouse lounge, often nicknamed such) (or a streaker painting this on his body, with an arrow down to his butt – although this may in fact happen there, for all I know).\n\nMay 28\n\nThe 3rd Annual Alaxson/Brock Memorial Art Exhibition is held at the Goodale Park Annex Building.

Tonight’s version begins at Elevator Brewery and finishes over at the ballroom in Adam’s Mark Hotel.

Virginia Coalition are the special guests.\n\nJune 30\n\nThe 29th edition of Community Festival begins at Goodale Park. Tony Monaco, whom I’ve seen before and is pretty damn amazing on the keys, is among those performing at the jazz tent. His set is well received and will find enthusiasts spilling out onto the street to shake their behinds. New Basics Brass Band is over on the gazebo stage, while Watershed closes out the night on the main one. Jenny Mullin, in her piece for The Other Paper, complains that their set was so loud it was drowning out everybody else.\n\nJuly 1\n\nComfest continues with, among many, many others, Barry Chern picking an acoustic on the Poplar Street stage. Jack Neat outfits his band in shirts that have “Jack” across the chest, except for lead singer Nikki Wonder, whose tighter shirt says “Neat.” The Johnson Brothers will grace the main stage later, and The Other Paper for one is not impressed. Cleopatra Grip play pop music on this same stage at some point. Howlin’ Maggie play at least Alcohol (one of maybe two songs I know of theirs) and then Fenster will close out the night there. Soul-Fu Villains are over on the jazz stage, quietly laying down the grooves amid this mayhem. A group of local police and firemen bring a bagpipe band to the Fine Arts Stage, and reportedly sound none too shabby.\n\nOver at the jazz tent, Jessica Agler sings with the Columbus Youth Ensemble, and other acts include New Remnants, flutist Kris Keith and his outfit Minan-Dya, as well as Madrugada. Jim Maneri goes over particularly well, accompanied by Derek DiCenzo on theremin.\n\nSlightly north of here, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Warren G and Eminem hit the Schottenstein Center all at once. This was a pretty big deal even then and it seems like some of my friends might have gone to it.\n\nJuly 2\n\nJohnny Rebel (rockabilly) plays Comfest’s Poplar Street stage, relatively late. As do Sue Harshe and Marcy Mays. Over at the jazz tent, the Famous Jazz Orchestra breezes through the noon hour. Paul Brown and his Science Gravy Orchestra are followed by a Chris Howes set (he had actually just played with Science Gravy as well) where the power goes out. Rodney McCoy and Deep Pockets (from Pittsburgh – I guess I didn’t realize out-of-towners or especially out-of-staters were permitted here) raise the vinyl roof to close out the night, possibly the event as far as I know, into the a.m. hours. According to The Other Paper, Little Brother’s owner Dan Dougan was spotted in the crowd, dancing to their set.\n\nJuly 3\n\nFollowing a late shift at work, another relatively crazy night ensues. Which you can read about here.\n\nJuly 6\n\nRicky Martin is performing at the Schott. 10,000 Maniacs with special guest Anne E.

Crafts and contests are but a smattering of the delights awaiting thee.\n\nJuly 8\n\nBorders continues its Harry Potter weekend by way of “Breakfast With Dumbledore,” a couple instances of Hogwart’s Express leaving the station (whatever that means) and a game of quidditch.\n\nFairmont Girls are at Oldfield’s on High. Westerville’s Music & Arts Festival (2 days) begins at Otterbein College, on the Campus Towers Hall Lawn.\n\nJuly 12\n\nAuthor James Kaserman is in town, dressed as a pirate, to promote his latest book and set the record straight about pirates, at the Upper Arlington Barnes & Noble. Elsewhere on the literary front, New York Times writer Andy Borowitz (who also apparently created the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air sitcom!) is the main attraction at the latest Thurber House Literary Picnic.\n\nDirector Richard Gordon, as part of the Wexner Center’s “Son of B-Movie Mania” series, is on hand to introduce screenings of his classics The Haunted Strangler and Fiend Without A Face.\n\nJuly 13\n\nConspiracy play Braddock’s Grandview.\n\nMatthew Sweet plays at Easton, as part of their free outdoor concert series.\n\nJuly 15\n\nElsewhere around town, there’s the 4th Annual Wing Zing, at the Easton Town Center. Wings, live music, and presumably beer, considering that Budweiser sponsors the thing. This is actually quite the lineup: McGuffey Lane, The Dan Orr Project, Molly Hatchet, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts. A number of different restaurants are competing for various event awards, all of them selling three wings for $1.\n\nJuly 16\n\nThis is an interesting sounding show that I wish I would have caught. Billed as “new sounds from the digital realm,” the Wexner Center hosts either a group or series of individuals known as Fennesz/Pita/Schmickler. Whatever it is they’re doing, the pitch is that you will hear how “hotwired laptops and suspect devices shape electronic music’s future.”\n\nJuly 18\n\nThis year’s edition of Ozzfest hits Polaris. Damon and Paul are among the known attendees.\n\nJuly 20\n\nChannel 10 uses their helicopter’s brand new “Sky Zoom” camera to film a good old fashioned police chase, when some out of control driver attempts outrunning cop cars on I-71.\n\nJuly 27\n\nTonight’s musical offering at Braddock’s in Grandview is The JuJuBees Rhythm Revue, with Vocal Impact. Elsewhere, a three day event called Bluegrass Classic kicks off at Hoover Reservoir Park.\n\nCOSI is hosting a limited run of “Rockin’ Laser Shows” which admittedly sound cooler than anything else they’ve recently had. Though the curiously titled Pop Rox offering runs daily at 3:30 (featuring music by the likes of modern boy bands and Britney Spears) tonight’s lineup is a little better: Beatles at 6:15, Pop Rox at 7:30, but then Beastie Boys at 8:45 and the all but required Pink Floyd at 10pm. The same show repeats tomorrow as well.\n\nRiffe Gallery has an opening reception from 5-7pm for Metaphor and Irony: Czech Scenic and Costume Design 1920-1999, which will run from today through October 15.\n\nJuly 28\n\nThe Short North’s Special Improvement District team meets with Department of Trade and Development Director Mark Barbash (awesome last name, incidentally) to iron out more details about these proposed arches over High Street. At issue is who’s picking up the tab on moving the power lines from above to underground.\n\nColumbus Symphony Orchestra’s “Picnic with the Pops” series presents a Buckeye Band Bash featuring their outfit as well as the OSU marching band, as well as Civil War cannons courtesy of 1st Ohio Statehouse Light Artillery’s Battery A. A repeat performance is slated for the 29th, too, and lawn seats are just $13.\n\n“Summer of Dance” begins at the Riffe Center’s Capitol Theatre. Tonight and the following night there’s “an invigorating mix of contemporary dance and enchanting classical ballet,” according to the ads.\n\nJuly 29\n\nWorthington Folklife Celebration begins at 10am. “Where New Dogs Learn Old Tricks,” is the tagline for this event, and it truly is a hodgepodge of, well, see for yourself:\n\n10am-4pm – Make It & Take It interactive art\n\n10:30am & 4:30pm – drum circles\n\n11am & 1pm – Turkeys in the Straw (old time string band)\n\n11am to 1pm – Native Games\n\nNoon – old style hootenanny\n\n1, 2 and 3pm – cake walks\n\n1:30-3:30pm – block party games\n\n1:30pm – John Ulrich & Friends (traditional jazz)\n\n3pm – David Verny Band (traditional bluegrass)\n\nThere’s also “storytelling & folks songs” by Browne (2:15pm), Arbaugh (3pm), Browne and Arbaugh (noon). Plus art & craft exhibitors, demonstrations by skilled craftsmen, a pig roast, and an ongoing block party throughout.\n\nElsewhere about town…the Major League Soccer All-Star game is broadcast live from Crew Stadium, on ABC and ESPN both. Columbus has no starters on the squad, but Dante Washington (not sure who else) is on the bench. Then at 10pm, soccer star Alexi Lalas (who is either confident that the game will be long over by then, or plays on disappearing even if it’s not) is booked for a hilarious sounding head scratcher I almost wished I would have seen: an appearance at Rush Creek on Sunbury Road. It says here there is live music by Nectar Drop featuring Alexi Lalas. But then also Jon Chinn of Pretty Mighty Mighty.\n\nDragonfly, which bills itself as “high cuisine,” has some kind of lounge DJ event featuring Michael Guldan, Thomas James, Anthony Ramos, and others. 10pm-1am.\n\nJuly 30\n\nThe Rick Brunetto Band plays in Goodale Park, as part of the Short North Sunday Jazz Series. These free events begin at noon, and attendees are encouraged to bring their own picnic supplies, to chill in the grass whilst absorbing these tasty grooves. Special guest Dwight Lenox is also performing. Another Buckeye Comic Con is held at the Holiday Inn on Roberts Road.\n\nAugust 2\n\nMusical sensations Celeste & Craig are at the Borders bookstore on Sawmill, imploring people to “get down to the salsa sound.”\n\nAugust 4\n\nDublin Irish Festival begins. This three day event, held at Coffman Park, features musical acts The Prodigals, Seven Nations, The Fenians, and The Black Family, although I don’t know exactly who played when.\n\n“Summer of Dance” continues on the 4th and 5th, this time with “a shockwave of funky, ultra-hip modern moves and sweeping romantic ballet.” Only to be found at Capitol Theatre, of course.\n\nAugust 5\n\nJethro Tull hit Palace Theatre.\n\nAugust 6\n\nThe Short North Sunday Jazz Series continues at Goodale Park. On tap today is the Hank Marr Sextet, with Tom Carroll and Jeanette Williams.\n\nAugust 9\n\nA new law goes into effect that if you’re buying more than four kegs of beer, you must sign a waiver permitting the police to come and search your property. While this is actually a statewide rule, it’s difficult to imagine any area that will be harder hit than, say, I don’t know, the OSU campus perchance.\n\nWhat kind of effect will this have on us, though? Too soon to tell. As far as what else is happening around town today, a bad storm knocks out the power at the Henderson Road Kroger, along with traffic lights up and down that road. The Borders on Sawmill welcomes guest speaker Manon Van Schoyck, who is bringing some nocturnal animals and will talk about such during this interactive program.\n\nAugust 10\n\nImperial Teen play at Easton Town Center.\n\nAugust 11\n\nNow the “Summer of Dance” implores you to “indulge in an explosion of pulsating, passionate dance.” Another opportunity to do so awaits you on the 12th.\n\nAugust 17\n\nWang Chung play at Easton Town Center. It’s another free show and some of us are talking about hitting that, but it’s raining today and this doesn’t happen.\n\nAugust 19\n\nGrandview is really popping these days! Shoku, a highly regarded Pan-Asian Restaurant, celebrates with a 1st Anniversary party tonight.\n\nAugust 20\n\nChad Rager’s Modern Big Band plays Braddock’s Grandview\n\nAugust 21\n\nPearl Jam plays Polaris with Sonic Youth opening. This is from the first tour where they released every single show as a live disc and set a record in the process (most albums on the chart at once.) If you’re curious about my review of that CD/show, you can read it here.\n\nAugust 24\n\nDelyn Christian & D.C.B. (I think maybe this stands for Delyn Christian Band) play Braddock’s Grandview. Red Wanting Blue get to headline their own show at Easton Town Center.\n\nAugust 31\n\nHot day. A return engagement at Braddock’s Grandview for The JuJuBees Rhythm Revue. The Outfield close out the summer concert series at Easton Town Center.\n\nSeptember 2\n\nThe OSU football team plays a home game against Fresno State. These Buckeyes administer a serious beat down to the tune of 43-10, with Fresno not even scoring until the 3rd quarter. David Mitchell manages to return a fumble and an interception both for TDs. Steve Bellisari also throws a 23 yard pass to the immortal Chad Cacchio, among other highlights.\n\nSeptember 12\n\nBrian Wilson show.\n\nSeptember 16\n\nRoy’s 30th birthday party\n\nSeptember 22\n\nMick Taylor plays at Thirsty Ear, tickets are $25 a pop. Damon and Paul attend. In their recap they tell me they can read his lips, early into his set when he turns to another musician in the band and says, “this sucks.” And has a similarly disinterested attitude for the entire performance. I’m sure it would indeed suck mightily to go from The Rolling Stones to playing a venue like this…but on the other hand, this attitude may explain in part why you’re no longer with The Rolling Stones.\n\nSeptember 23\n\na rave I attend at Valley Dale Ballroom.\n\nNovember 4\n\nBuckeye football team takes on Michigan State at home. Damon and Paul attend this game for some reason. It’s the fourth time this year the Bucks have posted exactly 27 points, winning this time around by a score of 27-13. This puts them at a 7-2 record on the season.\n\nNovember 5\n\nType O Negative play Alrosa Villa. It’s nice to see that in Rob Harvilla’s reviewing for The Other Paper, he confirms my impression of these guys, i.e. that they’re basically clowning around up there. But are a pretty decent metal band anyway. After opening with a cover of N.I.B. by Black Sabbath, they then thank the audience and jokingly tell them goodnight. Then return and play an actual full set. Overall, he rates it as a weird yet captivating show, replete with long solos, unexpected mid-song shifts, and even more left field cover choices.\n\nSimon Says and the hilariously named SpineShank open.\n\nNovember 7\n\nJello Biafra makes some kind of weird spoken word/political manifesto appearance at Independence Hall. As reported by Sonya Huber for The Other Paper, his best quote is perhaps referring to Columbus as, “not the most picturesque city I’ve ever seen.” He also christens this town as “Hellburbia” at one point. A couple of attendees are heckling him, and perhaps rightly so, until security is called to deal with them. And this is before Jello attempts inciting the crowd into action, with a suggestion that they dig up Woody Hayes’s grave, right now, tonight. Thankfully (?) this does not come to pass.\n\nThe reason he’s here, presumably, has something to do with Election Day.\n\nNovember 11\n\n’80s Power Ballad Night at Andyman’s Treehouse. Billy Peake, Miranda Sound, Pfifer, Quinn Fallon (bartender/co-owner of this charming establishment), Rick Kinsinger, Rhonda Everitt, Stepford Five, The Vague, Wolfgang Parker and others take their shot at covering classics from the MTV era.\n\nNovember 18\n\nThis fair city suffers one of its worst ever riots, though the who/what/where are quite familiar: drunken OSU students burning things on campus. The catalyst this time is, what else, a Buckeye loss to Michigan. My “favorite” incident is when some out of town kid from Illinois allegedly tosses a cop’s bike on the bonfire, while he’s busy arresting someone else. This three alarm rager lasts until nearly daylight, featuring police in riot gear as its piece de resistance, with a final tally of 34 revelers hauled in. Cops are quoted in The Other Paper saying that all the bars closing on south campus has had “unintended consequences,” i.e. exactly what many of us had predicted was obviously going to happen. The kids have nothing else to do so now they’re destroying shit.\n\nRegarding the game, the once again much overhyped Buckeyes failed to deliver the goods. Losing 26-38 to the Wolverines, at home no less, puts them at a paltry 8-3 to close out the season, despite a not exactly powerhouse schedule.\n\nNovember 19\n\nBlue Jackets smoked at home by Vancouver, 6-1. As the record falls to 7-12-1-1 (whatever this means – maybe wins-losses-ties-forfeits?), their debut season does look kind of lost already. Indeed, a glance at the roster reveals just one guy I’ve even heard of, Geoff Sanderson. Well, yeah, and Ron Tugnutt. You don’t exactly forget a name like that.\n\nNovember 23\n\nA number of local organizations are kind enough to give out free Thanksgiving dinners. Among these are Better Way Ministries, CMACAO Northeast, Community Kitchen, Faith Mission (151 N. Sixth St.), Hilltop Church Council at St. Aloysius Family Center, Inner City Ministries, Salvation Army and Rock of Faith Baptist Church, and Volunteers of America (379 W. Broad St.)\n\nDecember 3\n\nPolice chase deranged speeder on the interstate, a man driving the wrong way in excess of 90mph. After hitting a roadblock in the form of spikes, he flips his SUV multiple times and ejects from it. Incredibly enough, he is still alive after this crash.\n\nDecember 7\n\nMarilyn Manson besmirches Veterans Memorial with his presence. Godhead will introduce this sacrilege.\n\nDecember 31\n\nOSU’s women’s basketball team loses a nail-biter to Penn State, 66-63. With the score tied at 63 in the closing seconds, the ball came loose and both squads attempted to corral it. A foul is called on Lauren Shenk during the ensuing melee, which proves the difference maker."
