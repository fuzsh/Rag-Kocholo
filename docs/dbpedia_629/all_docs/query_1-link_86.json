The author, Mr. William H. Clark, has long been recognized as outstanding, particularly in the field of historical writings. A former resident of our Town, he has devoted a great deal of time in intensive research necessary to the production of a work of this importance.\n\nPlanning many events to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the granting of the Charter to our Town, the Committee feels that the publishing of this volume will be the most important. Other events scheduled will pass on and become but memories, but the History will be a permanent memento of the Centennial celebration of our fine New England community.\n\nHistory Committee\n\nBRENDAN J. KEENAN, Chairman\n\nFRANK K. HATFIELD\n\nSIDVIN FRANK TUCKER\n\n-----------------\n\nChapter One\n\nGEOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY\n\nSITUATED almost due east of down-town Boston, within clear view of the Golden Dome of the State House on Beacon Hill, the town of Winthrop is one of the smallest communities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This is so in point of size alone. On the town's one thousand and seventy-five acres some eighteen thousand people live -- thus making the little town by the sea one of the more important of the State.\n\nWinthrop, is a beautiful town. Its location between the Atlantic Ocean on the East and Boston Harbor on the West is alone enough to establish the fact. Even more, Winthrop is a town of gentle hills which, although now built over with about 4,000 houses, gives almost every window a wide prospect over miles of ocean, marsh and a city just far enough away to be remote and yet near enough to be conveniently reached within a half-hour or so. Probably one of the greatest factors concerned in the production of Winthrop's charms are the many elms and maples lining her 36 miles of streets and shading most of her homes and all her public buildings.\n\nThere are wealthier towns in the Commonwealth than Winthrop but few more financially fortunate. By many years of self-sacrificing service by public-spirited citizens who have served the town largely without pay, the town is practically without debt; nearly all the streets are paved and have sidewalks while the municipal establishments, schools, library, town hall, fire houses and all the rest are paid for in full.\n\nWinthrop is known as a town of homes. This is true because there is practically no industry in the town at all. The town is emptied of mornings by perhaps ten thousand men and women who go into Boston to their various occupations. At evening, they return home. This is a common condition of many of the suburbs around Boston and certain uncomplimentary critics have described these suburbs of Boston as being mere bedrooms for the City.\n\nHowever true this may be, Winthrop does maintain its own spirit and integrity. As it is a pleasure to live in Winthrop, so is it a distinction. This is the result of the town's many years of\n\n3\n\nhistory, a history free of the scandal and difficulties which have affected at one time or another, most of Boston's suburbs.\n\nThis is remarkable, because Winthrop has a long, long history. Actually, this town observes its centennial this year. That is so because it became legally a separate town in 1852, when it was parted from the present City of Revere. Previously, Revere (and Winthrop) had been a part of the present City of Chelsea -- just as Chelsea (and Revere and Winthrop) had been a part of the original settlement of Boston.\n\nThat takes the history back to 1630 but this is merely the white occupation of this area. The first whites who visited Boston Bay of demonstrable certainty were hardy fishermen from Britain, France and Portugal. These doughty seamen came here to catch the great cod which then flourished in great numbers. In tiny vessels, hardly more than present-day yachts, they sailed westward in the Spring, landed a few men on shore, in such bays as Boston Harbor and built huts. 'Then, while the rest of the men fished, the shore detail dried the fish in the sun, made barrels into which they packed the fish and did some trading with the Indians, exchanging trinkets and liquor worth a few pence for furs worth great price. Then, when the Fall storms came, the fishermen sailed home with their fish and furs. This business' certainly flourished during the latter part of the fifteen hundreds and these fishermen were often on hand to welcome the \"discoverers and explorers\" when they arrived somewhat later.\n\nThere is a reasonably good probability that there were white men here even before the fishermen. These were, of course, the Vikings or Norsemen who did sail along the Nova Scotia and New England coasts in and about the year 1,000. The Norse sagas describe settlements made somewhere along shore, tell of the battles with the Indians and while they cannot tell of the gradual extinction of the colonies, the tragic fate of these first settlers in America is grimly for shadowed in the poems. There is some evidence that Irish explorers may have visited New England also at about the same era. The trouble is. no trace exists of these primary colonies. There are opinions, of course, but no definite proof has been found -- nor does it seem likely that such will ever appear.\n\nNo one has ever found proof that the Norse ever visited Boston Harbor -- but it seems unlikely that the little dragon ships of the Vikings, coasting down from Nova Scotia, could have missed Boston Harbor as they explored on to the south. Thus it is probable that the Norsemen must have at least visited Winthrop's beaches and found refreshment and rest in our forests while they enjoyed the abundance of game and sea-food then blessing this region.\n\n4\n\nBefore the white men, Winthrop was, of course, home to Indians. Indeed, the future town, with its wealth of fish, clams and lobsters, was a favorite resort in the summer for many Indians who apparently were seated in the hills back from the shore during the winters. There is some evidence of importance that the tribesmen the Puritans found here, were not here very long, being comparatively newcomers. Lacking a written language, indeed any language which would have made accurate history possible, the story of the Indians can only be pieced together out of legends and some archeological material. This last is very scanty, too, for the Indians, being very primitive people, had little of permanent importance to leave behind when exterminated by the whites.\n\nIt is likely that the Indians here in 1600 were interlopers. They seem to have been fierce and warlike people who drove up from the south-west and forced the then holders of this area northward along the shore. It is considered probable that the evicted Indians may be the present day Esquimaux, or at least have been absorbed into the Arctic tribes. And there is some further evidence that even the exiled people were not the original inhabitants of this area, for some recent archeological studies have given evidence of the presence of a people of great antiquity. Because these people dyed their skeletons before burial with a red pigment, they are known as the Red Paint People. Almost nothing is known of them.\n\nWinthrop, when the first white people came here, was a place of striking beauty. This is made clear in the accounts of those first on the scene. Unfortunately, there were few Puritans sufficiently interested to write in any detail of the geography - or indeed of anything save the formal, legal records. Men were commonly not educated in such facilities in those days, articulateness was not a characteristic of the early 17th century. Even so, the men who could write were much more concerned with winning homes and establishing a commonwealth. They were too busy to write, even if they could have done so.\n\nThe important things about these descriptions is not so much that they were mere off-hand comments, fragments of a few sentences included in writing of much graver material, as that one and all they were markedly enthusiastic. For example, the Puritans wrote home from Boston in glowing terms. One worthy wrote: \" ... So pleasant a scene here they had as did much refresh them; and there came a smell off the shore like the smell of a garden.\" It must have been pleasant and refreshing. Imagine a weary, endlessly-long tossing upon the ocean, cramped and confined, ill and sick of the horrible food which alone was possible on long voyages in those days. And then to\n\n5\n\nsee the green hills around Boston Bay, rich with heavy forests, and to look overs ide and see the translucent water, filled with fish. Probably at morning and again at evening, deer would come out of the forest and stand on the beach to see what manner of creature was disturbing their peace. Then to land on the beach, to walk on solid ground once again and to feast on fresh meat and to enjoy the strange but delicious flesh of lobsters -- and even to have a plate of steamed clams -- not to mention great steaks of familiar fish such as cod.\n\nOf these fish and these sea-foods, a colonist, Francis Higginson, wrote, \"The abundance of sea-food are (sic) almost beyond believeing and sure I should scarce have believed it, except I had seen it with mine own eyes. I saw great store of whales and grampusses and such abundance of mackerels that it would astonish one to behold, likewise codfish in abundance on the coast, and in their season are plentifully taken.\n\n\"There is a fish called bass, a most sweet and wholesome fish as ever I did eat; it is altogether as good as our fresh salmon and the season of their coming was begun when first we came to New England in June, and so continued about three months' space. Of this fish, our fishers take many hundreds together, which I have seen lying on the shore to my admiration; yea, their nets ordinarily take more than they are able to haul to land, and for want of boats and men they are constrained to let many go after they have taken them, and yet sometimes they fill two boats at a time with them.\n\n\"And besides bass, we take plenty of scate and thornbacks and abundance of lobsters, and the least boy in the plantation may both catch and eat what he will of them. For my own part, I was soon cloyed with them, they were so great and fat, and lucious. I have seen some (lobsters) that weighed sixteen pounds; but others have, divers times, seen great lobsters as have weighed twenty-five pounds, as they assure me. Also here is abundance of herring, turbot, sturgeon, cusks, haddocks, mullets, eels, crabs, mussels and oysters. Besides there is probability that the country is of excellent temper for the making of salt; for since our coming, the fishermen have brought home very good salt, which they found candied, by standing of sea-water and the heat of the sun, upon a rock by the sea-shore; and in divers salt marshes that some have gone through, they have found some salt in some places crushing under their feet and cleaving to their shoes.\"\n\nFrancis Higginson, who incidentally was a minister and thus a man in whose writing confidence can be placed, also had this to say of the native plants and the behavior of crops: \" ... the aboundant encrease of corne proves this countrey to be a\n\n6\n\nwonderment. Thirtie, fortie, fiftie, sixtie, are ordinarie here; yea, Joseph's increase in Egypt is outstript here with us. Our planters have more than a hundred fold this yere... What will you say of two hundred fold and upwards? Our Governor hath store of green pease in his garden, as good as ever I eat in England. Thecountrie aboundeth naturally with store of roots of great varietie ... , Our turnips, parsnips, and carrots are here bigger and sweeter than is ordinary to be found in England. Here are store of pomions (squash), cowcumbers and other things the nature of which I know not .... Excellent vines are here, up and down the woods. Our governor (John Winthrop) hath already planted a vineyard with great hope of increase. Also mulberries, hurtleberries, and hawes of whitethorn filberts, walnuts, smallnuts, near as good as our cherries in England; they grow in plentie here.\"\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Higginson's botany and horticulture may be slightly awry but there can be no mistaking the fact that the settlers found Boston a fair and pleasant land and one which was fruitful in the bargain.\n\nAnother excerpt, from an unknown writer, has this to say along the same line: \" ... This much I can affirm in general, that I never came to a more goodly country in my life. . .. it is very beautiful in open lands mixed with goodly woods, and again open plains, in some places five hundred acres, some places more; some less, not much troublesome for to clere, for the plough to go in; no place barren but on the tops of hills; the grasse and weedes grows up to a man's face; in the lowlands and by the fresh rivers, abundance of grasse, and the large meadows without any tree or shrubbe to hinder the sith. .,. Everything that is here eyther sowne or planteth, prospereth far better than in Old England. 'The increase of corne here is farre beyond expectation, as I have seene here by experience in barly, the which because it is SO' much above your conception I will not mention. . .. Vines doe grow here plentifully laden with the biggest grapes that ever I saw; some I have seen foure inches about ... \"\n\nThis gentleman may have been a bit enthusiastic, but again, he was pleased with his new home.\n\nOne of the better sources of information about the early days of Boston and vicinity is William Wood's New England Prospect. Wood spent some four years in this neighborhood and published his book in 1634 at London. It is one of the best sources of information about the Massachusetts Bay Colony, if for no other reason, it being the only thing of its kind. In Wood's book appears a fair map of this area on which for the first time Winthrop's former name of Pullin Point is shown, together with\n\n7\n\nthe name of Winnisimmet, which is the original name for Chelsea and Revere.\n\nWood had this to say, in part, about his new home. Speaking of strawberries, he alleged, the colonists \"may gather halfe a bushell in a forenoone ... verie large ones, some being two inches about. In other season, there are Gooseberries, Bilberries, Rasberries, Treacleberries, Hurtleberries, Currants ... the (wild grapes) are very bigge, both for the grape and the cluster, sweet and good.\" In what is now Dorchester, Wood said there was \"very good arable ground, and hay grounds, faire corne-fields, and pleasant gardens with Kitchin-gardens.\" Boston, he pointed out, was blessed by \"sweet and pleasant Springs\" ... which as may be noted, was the very reason that John Winthrop and his associates chose the site for settlement after a failure across the Charles River at what is now Charlestown.\n\nYet another interesting account of colonial days is that of John Josselyn, published in 1675. In his book New England Rarities, which is hardly noteworthy for its restraint, John has much to say about apples and cider; for example,\" ... I have observed with admiration that the (apple) Kernels sown or the succors planted produce as fair & good fruit without grafting as the tree from whence they were taken; the Countrey is replenished with faire and large orchards. It was affirmed by one Mr. Wolcutt (a magistrate established in Connecticut after leaving Boston) that he made five hundred hogsheads of syder out of his own Orchard in One year. Syder is very plentiful in the Countrey, ordinarily sold for Ten Shillings a Hogshead. At the tap-houses in Boston I have had an Ale-quarter spiced and sweeted with Sugar for a Groat .... The Quinces, Cherries, Damsons set the Dames at work. Marmalade and preserved Damsons is to be met with in every house. . .. I made Cherry wine, and so many others, for there are a good store of them both red and black. ... \"\n\nIn passing, it may also be noted that the colonists planted many pear trees, not only as a table fruit in season but also as a means of making a pear-cider, commonly known as perry. On the very best authority, the reader may be assured that perry when properly aged can give a most gratifying result for the moment, although gastrically it is worse than even very hard cider.\n\nThe colonists were devoted to their fruit trees, perhaps feeling that the familiar fruits of home were an establishment of civilization in the wilderness. Indeed, it has been said that the church bell and the apple tree crossed America hand and hand as the tide of settlement moved westward. William Blackstone, who lived near what is now Boston Common on the side of Beacon Hill, had an apple orchard well established before the Puritans\n\n8\n\ncame in 1630. John Winthrop hastened to plant his island off shore (Governor's Island) with a garden in which apple and other fruits were set out. Out in present Roxbury, Justice Paul Dudley planted a garden in which he reported, he grew eight hundred peaches upon a single tree and that he grew pears \"eight inches around the bulge.\" Gardens, very much in the English style, became common in Boston proper, once the colonists were firmly established, and caused visitors who expected sod-covered huts of logs to greet them, to write with astonishment of the beauty and prosperity of the infant colony. Governor Bellingham built a garden along what is now Tremont Street and here he reared the very first \"greenhouse\" in America. Thomas Hancock had a \"magnificent plantation\" on the site of the present State House. One other well-known early garden was located in the present South End where Perrin May had a \"famous orchard.\" His fruits were of tremendous size but uncharitable neighbors said this unexampled fertility was due to the fact that May trapped house cats and used one at least at the base of each tree for fertilizer. May, however, was probably one of the first to make use of sea weed, such as kelp for fertilizer; that material sounds better for plant food than pussy cats.\n\nWhile many other references could be listed, these will show how pleased the settlers were with the Boston area and we can infer that Deane Winthrop and a few other settlers in Winthrop itself experienced the same good fortune. Certainly there is no reason to suppose that Winthrop was any different from the adjacent territory and crops must have flourished here as easily and as prosperously.\n\nFrom these early accounts, it would seem that the abundance of wild life was even more remarkable. General Benjamin Butler, that unfortunate man more celebrated for his acid tongue than for his many accomplishments and services once remarked that the storied hardships of the first settlers were largely imaginary for there was so much wild life about in the woods and on the beaches, as well as in the sea and the rivers, that they could have starved only if they were lazy enough to fail to pick up what was lavishly laid out before them.\n\nDeer were certainly very abundant. Indeed a quotation from William Wood's New England's Prospect, probably written about 1634, makes this dear, while at the same time explaining how Deer Island and Pullin Point, Winthrop's first name, were so called.\n\n\"The last Towne in the still Bay (Boston Harbor) is Winnisimmet (variously spelled); a very sweet place for habitation and stands very commodiously, being fit to entertain more planters than are yet seated; it is within a mile of Charles\n\n9\n\nTowne, the river (Mystic) only parting them. The chief islands which keepe out the winde and the sea from disturbing the harbours are, first Deare Island, which lies within a flight shot of Pullin Point.\n\n\"This Island is so called because of the deare which often swimme thither from the maine, when they are chased by wolves. Some have killed sixteen deare a day upon this island. The opposite shore (across Shirley Gut) is called Pullin Pointe, because that is the usual channell Boats use to passe threw into the bay (Boston harbor); and the tide being very stronge, they are constrayned to goe ashore and hale their boats, by the sealing, or roades, whereupon it was called Pullin Point. ... \"\n\nPerhaps it should be noted that spelling was a matter of somewhat individual whimsey in those old days, at least at the hands of the Puritans and their associates. Few men could read or write well; many could not do either at all. When a man was actually compelled to write, it was a task of considerable labor, not merely because it was unaccustomed work, but because the author, while he might have a fairly good oral vocabulary, had only a general idea of how the words he used should be spelled. So, when he came to a word he did not really know, he was apt to spell it as it sounded to him. Thus much of the old writing is somewhat original. Then too, these writers made use of many words which have since been lost and forgotten save by scholars.\n\nNext to deer, perhaps a major game source was the wild turkey. These were big birds and very delicious. Then, they were abundant in and about Boston. At a single shot a man or boy could bring home 20 pounds or so of the most highly prized meat. Wood wrote, in 1634, \" ... forty, three score, and even a hundred in a flock ... There have been seen a thousand in one day ... \" Characteristically, the settlers did not value what was so plentiful and Josselyn in 1672, about fifty years later, wrote \" ... the English ... having so destroyed the breed that it is very rare to meet a turkey in the woods.\" Of course, today, the wild turkey is unknown in all New England.\n\nJust as the settlers exterminated the turkeys, so they were profligate with other game. Deer very soon became scarce; bear were nearly exterminated, save in the depths of the Maine woods. Probably the greatest waste of all was in wild birds.\n\nThe passenger pigeons are a classic example. Today, not one is known to be alive anywhere. When the settlers came, reports Wood, there were \"millions and millions.\" Indeed, many later writers in other parts of the country where hunter's guns were just beginning to roar, reported that the earth was literally shadowed as by a cloud when a flock of pigeons passed overhead. Other writers speak of vast areas of the forest which were\n\n10\n\nswarming with the birds to such an extent that the ground was soiled inches deep for hundreds of acres while the noise of the birds was that \"of a rushing river tumbling over a rapids\". It is even reported that the birds, who were certainly gregarious, nestled so closely together and in such numbers, that their combined weight stripped giant oaks and maples of their larger boughs. These pigeons were shot, netted and trapped and so squandered that within a few years, as civilization moved westward, they were literally wiped out of existence.\n\nThe importance of wild fowl as a source of food was made evident in 1632, just two years after settlement, when the General Court ordered, \"That noe person whosoever shall shoote att fowle upon Pullin Point (Winthrop) or Noddles Island (East Boston), but said places shall be preserved for Jobe Perkins to take fowle with netts.\"\n\nNo one in New England at least, now practices the ancient art of fowling but it is one of the oldest of arts, being described in the Middle Ages as an \"ancient and honorable mystery.\" Boys were apprenticed to master fowlers and thus learned the profession. Primarily it consists of taking birds alive by means of nets, snares and various devices such as bird-lime -- which last consisted of smearing the branches where birds roosted in numbers at night with a sticky paste which held them fast until morning when the fowler picked them off like fruit from a laden apple bough.\n\nCertainly few fowlers ever had a more luxuriant opportunity than Jobe Perkins at Pullin Pointe and Noddles Island. The section then was heavily wooded, the beaches were numerous and there were the great unspoiled salt marshes -- ideal attractions for many kinds of birds. What is now Belle Isle Inlet -- what is left of it -- was then a much deeper tidal estuary winding between the salt marsh grasses. Although no description of Perkins' work remains, it is to be imagined that he built a frame work of light saplings for several hundred yards along and over the creek. This frame work was wide at the open end and narrowed down to a very small diameter at the farther end. Perkins and his aides would wait until there was a considerable flock of birds, say at about where the present Winthrop-East Boston bridge is now and then, in row-boats, drive the birds into the net and force them deeper and deeper into its constrictive diameter until, at the end, they could pick up the birds by hand -- taking them alive to Boston market.\n\nWhat happened to Perkins' concession, how much he paid for it and similar questions cannot be answered, but certainly Winthrop's first fowler had unlimited stock.\n\nBack in those days, before the wasteful habits of the settlers\n\n11\n\ncould make any serious depletion of wild life noticeable, the marsh and forests teemed with birds. Winthrop, its woods, fields and beaches, was a nursery for multitudes of birds. Indeed, on the ledges and sands of the outer beach, the great auk, now extinct, and such other birds as the gannet, shag, cormorant, puffin and many kinds of gulls and terns, not to mention many more lesser birds were at home. The wildness of the Winthrop beaches and rocks can be attested by the fact that they were also home to such animals as walrus and various types of seals. It was a hunter's paradise indeed.\n\nHere too were seen in considerable numbers the white swan, the sand hill crane, the heron, the brant, snow geese, Canada geese and such ducks as mallards, canvas backs, eider, teals, widgeons, sheldrakes and many others. Most of these commonly bred in Winthrop then, although of course the great breeding grounds then as now, were to the north. Yet each Spring and Fall, during the migrations, the sky was filled with clouds of these birds and Winthrop's marshes often sheltered countless thousands of them at night.\n\nIt must have been a magnificent sight then, to go out in the early morning, or late in the twilight, to see and hear the geese and duck in their hosts. How they must have deafened the ear with their clamorous calling and the beating of their wings must have sounded like constantly rolling thunder. Morton reported in 1642, \"I have often had a thousand (geese) at the end of my gun.\"\n\nPlover and the smaller birds, such as sandpipers and the like, were so numerous and so small as to be hardly fair game. Yet they, with the passenger pigeons previously mentioned, were often taken and used in making pies -- which was a sort of massive dish consisting of several pounds of bird flesh baked between thick layers of biscuit -- like crust in a lordly dish. This was a hearty meal and may be relished today, in a dwarfed and pale copy, in our modern chicken pie.\n\nThese smaller birds were very easy to kill, although many hunters regretted wasting \"their shotte upon such small fowles.\" Morton reports \" ... sanderlings are easier to come by; because I must go but a step or two for them. I have killed between foure and five dozen at a shoote, which would load me downe.\" There were larger plover, known then, and the names are still heard amongst old timers, as \"humilities\" and \"simplicities.\" Says Wood again, \"Such is the simplicitie of these smaller birds that one may drive them on a heape, like so mannie sheep, and seeing a fitte time, shoote them. The living, seeing the dead, settle themselves in the same place againe, I myself, have killed twelve score (240) att two shotts.\"\n\n12\n\nOf course birds were far from being the most important source of wild food. Deer was probably the great food staple. When the Puritans came the woods of Winthrop were teeming with the gentle animals as the name Deer Island attests but the animals were very soon exterminated and from then on, the only deer that came into Winthrop were refugees from the still unspoiled forests of what are now Saugus, North Revere and Malden. Soon these forests were emptied also and that was the end of deer in our section.\n\nThe moose was commonly seen in Winthrop too, in the early days, but this huge creature, larger than a horse, very soon vanished at the end of the settler's guns. There were elk and caribou also, in very limited numbers probably, and they did not long satisfy the settlers' hunger for meat because they are creatures of the wilderness -- even more so than the moose. Of the four animals the deer alone has managed to survive in numbers in New England. Indeed, it is said that there are more deer in New England today than there were when the settlers came. The reason is, of course, that the deer is comparatively small, very agile, and has managed to adapt himself to feeding on the fringes of the farm. Any hunter will tell you that deer in open, that is farming country, are much larger than the forest deer as for instance in the depths of the Maine woods.\n\nThere were many small animals in Winthrop at the beginning and these managed to survive longer than did the bigger creatures. Such were rabbits, squirrels and raccoons. The first was used for meat after the deer vanished, the raccoon was exterminated for its fur but the squirrel remained and still remains because he is of no value for either fur or food. Of course in Winthrop today, with practically every inch occupied by houses there is no possibility of any wild animal, save mice and rats and squirrels existing. What is left of the marshes and the outer beach still provides resting places for migrating water fowl hut the glory of wild life that once made Winthrop noted has vanished.\n\nFish took the place of game as a source of food as the larger wild animals. were destroyed. And for many years, Winthrop was a splendid place for fish and for sea-food; it was not until contemporary times that the pollution of the harbor ended this.\n\nA mere catalog of the fish that have been and still are caught off Winthrop shores, though seldom now in the harbor exemplifies this sea-given wealth of the town: bluefish, bream; catfish, cod, dogfish, eels, hake, flounders, haddock, herring, mackerel, mackerel shark (one typical of several small species), perch, pollock, porgy, sculpin, shrimp, skate, smelt, tuna, tautog and many more. As for shellfish, oysters once abounded; they\n\n13\n\nsoon vanished. For many years, these have remained: clams, crabs, lobsters, quahogs, scallops, sea clams and many more less edible species. Of small interest now but formerly valuable for oil, were such as whales, porpoises and blackfish.\n\nA catalog of wild animals of Winthrop, made by the late George McNeil, includes such as: bats, chipmunks, field mice, fox, gray squirrel, red squirrel, mink, moles, muskrat, rabbit, rat, skunk, weasel, woodchuck-plus of course the old deer, moose, elk and caribou. As for snakes Winthrop now has a very few harmless ones, such as blacksnakes, green snakes, garter snakes and possibly a few more but in the beginning, Winthrop had various slightly poisonous adders, such as the striped adder and the house adder while, sad to say, the virulent rattlesnake was once a nuisance, although scarcely a peril. The poisonous snakes were quickly killed and none have been reliably reported for the past century.\n\nGeologically, Winthrop is part of the general New England region which is one of the oldest, that is unchanged, portions of the earth's crust. Geologically, the basis of Winthrop runs back many millions of years, being part of the Appalachians, the mountains which are the mere stumps of what were once lordly peaks five miles high or more. Specifically, the New England Acadian Section, is Pre-cambrian and elder Paleozoic in character. Many ages ago, the rocks were crushed and folded like paper in a mountain building process. Up through the shattered rock then poured rivers of igneous rock which, however, seldom broke through the then existing surface. These \"domes\" or intrusions cooled in place and, when subsequently uncovered by erosion and glacial action, comprise the present day granite so characteristic of much of New England.\n\nSince the mountain building, there have followed uncounted years and ages of erosion of various types. At least a mile-thick layer of surface has been removed in the process, much more of course from the higher elevations. Thus the original snow-capped mountains were ground off and washed away to mere hills, or even obliterated. Much of New England became a flattish peneplain -- known as the Cretaceous peneplain for its being formed in that period. Much of New England during the time was sunk beneath the ocean.\n\nNext followed another period of stress and strain and New England was crumpled upward again. Volcanoes erupted, lava flowed and, when the motion ceased, most of New England was lifted bodily perhaps 2,000 feet with the worn away mountains once more respectably high. Oddly enough this uplift was not equal but was highest in what is now Vermont and lowest in\n\n14\n\nwhat is now the Cape Cod area. Thus all New England was tilted from northwest to southeast.\n\nOnce again followed another long period of erosion. Rivers carved themselves new valleys and, along shore, the ocean pounded rock to sand and built great beaches. This period was that of the Tertiary and the resulting peneplain is known by that name. It came to an end with a very slight upheaval which served to elevate the north west and broaden the lower reaches near the Ocean. Perhaps, as a very general statement, the shore line then was an average of 100 miles farther to the east. It was a remarkable shore line, especially along the southeastern Massachusetts coast. Several now placid rivers, like the Charles, tore great canyons in the rock near the ocean, making gorges as great as those of the present Grand Canyon of the Colorado. These gorges still remain -- under the ocean.\n\nIt was during this period that the sea alternately invaded the shore and then retreated, over swings of thousands of years. The present period is one in which the ocean is sweeping in and this has given us the characteristic drowned valley type of coast. Rivers have been shortened and the salt water has entered into their valleys making tidal estuaries. As the land subsided, high spots on ridges would remain above water, making numerous islands, often connected one with another and with the mainland by a higher ridge, thus forming peninsulas.\n\nOf course much of this outlined geological history is necessarily obscure since nearly all of its features have been obliterated by glaciation. It is to glaciers that Winthrop owes its form and character.\n\nThis planet of ours has experienced several \"ice ages,\" perhaps seven, so far. When the world went into one of these cold periods, sheets of ice, sometimes a mile in thickness, would creep down out of the north and in their coming -- as well as in their departure, when the climate warmed again -- they profoundly changed the face of things.\n\nThe last glacier, which created Winthrop and its vicinity, came during the Pleistocene age and receded from here something like 25,000 years ago. This great ice sheet, which apparently originated in the Laurentian region to the north and north-west, moved slowly, very slowly, in a northwest-southeast direction.\n\nIt overwhelmed everything in its path. Tops of mountains were sheared off, loose rock, soil and sand picked up and carried along -- as snow from the edge of a plow. The mass of rock at its forefront acted like the cutting blade of a titanic bulldozer and cut off the topsoil and the 'hills and pushed the mass ahead of itself.\n\n15\n\nEven more, the ice changed the shape of the mountain masses it could not level. As it climbed up the northwest side of the hills, the cutting edge created a long smooth slope. At the top, the final several hundred or thousand feet was sheared away. Then, as the ice sheet tumbled down the southeast side of the mountains, it fell so easily that the side remained steep. Indeed, if the southeast angle is projected upwards, and a similar angle projected from the base on the northwest side, it is demonstrated that the point where the lines intersect indicate the original height of the mountains. What are now a thousand or two feet high, were once mountains four and five thousand feet high. New England was once as lordly mountainous as Switzerland -- long ago. The Alps are very young as mountains go. Eventually they too will be worn to stumps but by then New England may grow a new crop of snow-covered peaks.\n\nFinally, when, after many years, the ice edge reached about as far as present New York City, the climate turned warmer. The ice halted and then began to retreat; which is to say, the ice melted away.\n\nNo living being can image the terrific confusion the ice left behind as inch by inch it retreated hack into Canada. Streams of water gushed across and out from under the ice in massive torrents. This was the tool, these vast masses of swiftly rushing water, which carved New England into what is, more or less, its present face. You see, as the ice halted, it left at a standstill the masses of rock and sand, clay and loam, which it had carried along as it moved south. This it promptly deposited, forming what is known as the terminal moraine at its southeasterly edge and its lateral moraine at its easterly edge. According to some geologists, this terminal moraine formed Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket -- for example.\n\nThe melted ice rushing through and over these moraines shaped them into outwash plains, kames and eskers. In places the ice water washed the moraine completely away; in others it shaped the mass into domes and hills with valleys between. Just as the wind after a snow storm drifts the soft snow into weird shapes in an hour, so through many years the water shaped the moraines into various forms. Of course, the process thus begun has continued ever since for wind, rain, frost and sun constantly erode the face of the earth -- tearing it down and preparing for another age of mountain building, perhaps a million years from now, perhaps tonight. New England is staid and quiet geologically now; but it may erupt into fire and flame at any moment as the rock beneath our feet awakens once again. The hills may seem eternal but to the geologist, a thousand years is but the tick of the second hand on a clock.\n\n16\n\nSo far as Winthrop is concerned, when the ice sheet retreated from here, it created all our hills. These are a very peculiar type of formation-for, while most hills are at least in part masses of rock, our hills are made up of sand, pebbles, small boulders and clay -- \"unconsolidated till\" is the technical name, meaning loose soil.\n\nThese hills are known as drumlins. They were not forgotten by the retreat of the glacier at the end of the ice age but were made during the ice age itself when, as the climate fluctuated, the glacier's edge alternately advanced and retreated over short distances -- perhaps a few hundred feet rather than several hundred miles as in the general advance and final retreat.\n\nTake a piece of bread, a small piece, and roll it lightly back and forth on the table. The bread will form a sort of thick and pointed cigar. That is how drumlins were made. The glacier rolled back and forth beneath its edge great heaps of debris and thus what now resembles half footballs resulted.\n\nWinthrop's hills are all drumlins, so are the hills of Revere, East Boston and Chelsea. So are many of the Islands in the harbor -- what is left of them. Specifically, Deer Island, Great Brewster, Long Island and the now vanished Apple and Governor's Island were all drumlins. So is Point Shirley, Great Head and the four hills at the Highlands with a smaller group or pair of the drumlins making up the Center and Court Park sections.\n\nOf course, time and the ocean have not dealt kindly with the drumlins. Being soft as compared with rock, they have been greatly eroded. An example of erosion has been the cut of Highway C 1 through the western end of the drumlin which is Orient Heights. This cut was originally wide enough only to keep the sides in permanent shape but rain washed away the soil until the road below was badly mudded over on the east side. Not until the bare soil was sodded over was this erosion stopped.\n\nAs the ice went away, the bare drumlins, until grass covered them and checked wind and rain erosion, washed down filling the space between the hills. Thus the salt marsh between Winthrop and Beachmont and between Winthrop and East Boston and Revere was brought into being. Drainage of tidal waters formed Belle Isle Inlet and its \"tributaries.\" Indeed, until the marshes were recently choked with debris from the airport and the pumping of mud to form the oil farm and Suffolk Downs, the marshes were in miniature a complete river basin, save that the current alternately flowed in and out. Then the marshes open to the sea were closed away by the formation of what is known as barrier beaches and the placid marsh was allowed to build itself up to high water level, by means of silting with humus formed by the annual decay of the marsh grasses and weeds. A cross section\n\n17\n\nof these marshes gives a complete description of the geology of the past 25,000 years or so for the different layers of silt, sand, blue clay down to the bed rock far below to a geologist are as complete a history as if it had been written and published by man.\n\nProbably the greatest agent which affected the drumlins was the ocean. The waves, especially during storms, battered them and ate mercilessly away at their substance. Orient Heights, protected by its marshes, is a good illustration of a drumlin which has not been much damaged by erosion. Only man has corroded its majesty. Great Head is a good example of a drumlin of which the ocean has destroyed about half of its length. Cherry Island bar, off Beachmont, is an example of a drumlin which has been completely leveled by the waves. Of course, Apple Island and Governors Island are examples of drumlins leveled by man -- the Airport consumed their substance.\n\nAs the ocean chewed away at exposed drumlins, the water carried away the sand and clay and the smaller pebbles while the larger boulders dropped down and were actually built into a sort of breakwater which gave some measure of protection against the waves. Of course, it was not adequate protection and hence in modern times we have been compelled to build sea walls along the shore front from Revere Beach, past Beachmont, around the Highlands and right down to Point Shirley. The damage winter northeasters sometimes do to even these modern sea walls, shows that we have reined back, not entirely halted the ocean. However, if the walls had not been built, it is altogether likely that Beachmont Hill, the Highlands and Point Shirley would all have been washed away -- as indeed they may be yet, unless we keep the sea walls in constant repair.\n\nThese rocks formed reefs which alter tidal and storm currents so that the sand and small pebbles washed out are deposited along between the drumlins. Thus our beaches came into being, composed of the ruins of the drumlins between the reefs -- as between the end of Beachmont and the Highlands, between the Highlands and Great Head and between Great Head and Point Shirley. As breakwaters and sea walls are built, the currents are altered still further. Thus in some places the beaches are being lowered and in others built higher. For example, the beach along the Crest, between the Highlands and Cottage Hill, has been notably elevated in the past few years since the breakwater was built off shore. Probably, within a few more years, what was the area of water between the shore and the breakwater will be filled in and Winthrop Beach will be that much wider. This formation\n\n18\n\nof reefs and beaches is a continued process. Every storm makes changes; and every change has its consequences. Undoubtedly we can keep the present area of Winthrop, and perhaps even persuade the ocean to enlarge it rather than wear the shore line away. However, it must be remembered that this will only be so if constant vigilance is maintained and the walls and breakwaters kept in repair.\n\nThese drumlins, when the Puritans arrived must have been very attractive, especially to sea-weary eyes. The hills stood up out of the levels of the salt marsh, not bare and shabby as we know them now, but clothed in heavy forests, probably of white pine, oak, birch and maple. This forest cover gave the soil protection against erosion and thus the hills had accumulated through the many centuries a rich and fertile humus. The subsoil, being of unconsolidated till, was \"tight\" and thus the food elements put into the soil by the forest did not leach away -- as it does in sandy and loose soils. The Indians, of course, had cleared little areas here and there by fire for their corn but they were not farmers. They much preferred to live by hunting and fishing and hence while they did plant corn, beans and pumpkins, they did not \"farm\" in the sense that large, cleared areas were utilized.\n\nThe scene is so different now, with buildings, many of them not designed to be attractive, covering all the drumlins, with roads cutting through the hills, with ugly skeletons of electric wire poles strung everywhere -- and with every forest tree cut down long since, that we descendants of the Puritans cannot realize how the town and its neighborhood did look 330 years ago. Mellen Chamberlain in his History of Chelsea visualized the aspect of his town by writing: \"While the bold bluffs of Winnisimmet were untouched by the leveling hand of man, and the great hills of the main, toward the north, and the lesser heights to the east, south and west, stood at their original elevations, and covered with primitive forests, the situation must have been one of scarcely paralleled beauty and interest.\"\n\nChanning Howard, Winthrop engineer for many years, has written the following description of our town: \"Here was bold bluff and sandy beach along the outer shore against which lapped the never still waters of the open sea, and the broad expanse of salt meadows and placid winding creeks in the distance, and the hills of varying height in our own territory, and the higher hills to the north ... Bordering us by the south and west lay splendid waterways for future commerce ... all kinds of landscape which the heart could wish, either for the eye of beauty or for the most\n\n19\n\nutilitarian of purposes, except the proverbial New England babbling brook and a rock bound coast. Neither of these exists, or did exist in our borders.\"\n\nOf course, under this original beauty and wealth of forest and game, some colonists found things they did not like too well. Their comments are particularly illuminating, both in reference to geography and to wild life, previously described.\n\nOne of the original settlers of the Puritan colony at Charlestown, was Anne Pollard, who died in 1725 at the age of 105. She claimed she \"was the first to jump ashore\" from the Winthrop party in the passage from Charlestown to Boston in 1630 and afterwards said she remembered the site of the future city as being \"very uneven, abounding with small hollows and swamps, and covered with blueberry and other bushes.\"\n\nThe same thickets were described by Captain Edward Johnson, writing about 1640. He said that \"At their first landing the hideous thickets in this place were such that wolves and bears nurse up their young from the eyes of all beholders.\"\n\nThe section was famous for its good springs and clear, sweet water. The Indian name for Charlestown, Mishawum, means \"a great spring\" while Boston's Indian name, Shawmut, means \"living fountain.\" There was indeed a great spring near Blackstone's house at about the present locality of Louisburg Square while there was \"the great Spring\" in Spring Lane, a little alley now running down from Washington Street just parallel with Water Street to the United States Post Office Building. When the foundations of the new Post Office building were put into place, the engineers were reported to have had some trouble with the waters of this spring -- which were still flowing under the buildings and pavements of modern Boston.\n\nWood had much to say about water in the Boston section. Writing in 1634, he remarked: \" ... for the countrey it is as well watered as any land under the Sunne, every family, or every two families having a spring of sweet waters betwixt them.: which is farre different from the waters of England, being not so sharpe, but of a fatter substance, ... : it is thought there can be no better water in the world, yet dare I not preferre it before good Beere, as some have done, but any man will choose it before bad Beere, Wheay or Buttermilk. Those that drink it (Boston's spring water) be as healthfull, fresh, and lustie, as they that drinke Beere; these springs be not onely within land, but likewise bordering upon the sea coasts, so that some times the tides overflow some of them ... \"\n\nWood was much interested in the trees comprising the forests in the vicinity of Boston, including Winthrop by inference. Indeed, he wrote the following verses about the local trees:\n\n20\n\n\"Trees both in hills and plaines, in plenty be,\n\nThe long liv'd oake, and mournful Cypris tree,\n\nSkie towring pines, and Chestnuts coated rough,\n\nThe lasting Cedar, with the Walnut tough;\n\nThe rozzin dripping Firre for masts in use,\n\nThe boatmen seeke for Oares light, neate grown Sprewse,\n\nThe brittle Ashe, the ever trembling Aspes,\n\nThe broad-spread Elme, whose concave harbours waspes,\n\nThe water-spungie Alder, good for nought,\n\nSmalle Elderne by th' Indian Fletchers sought,\n\nThe knottie Maple, pallid Birtch, Hawthornes,\n\nThe Horne bound tree that to be cloven scornes;\n\nWithin this Indian Orchard fruites be some,\n\nThe ruddie Cherrie, and tee jettie Plumbe,\n\nSnake-muthering Hazell, with sweet Saxaphrage,\n\nWho spurnes in Beere allayes hot fevers' rage.\n\nThe Diars Shummach, with more trees there be,\n\nThat are both good to use, and rare to see.\"\n\nTo conclude this chapter, somewhat out of chronological development, it should be pointed out that Winthrop, although almost in the shadow of the State House, and more or less a part of Boston until 1852, was actually rather remote from the future city for some 200 years.\n\nThe two islands which are now East Boston, were never part of Winthrop or of any interest to Winthrop people. Actually Winthrop was tied to Revere as a pensinsula, and Beachmont and adjacent Revere, another peninsula, was tied to Chelsea, and Chelsea itself was also a peninsula, reaching Boston by means of a ferry over the Mystic and Charles rivers. Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop, a series of three peninsulas, extended to the east and north of Boston but was sharply cut off from Boston by estuaries.\n\nThe natural way of Winthrop people to go into Boston was, of course, by water -- row boats and sailing boats afforded the most rapid and the easiest way to town. There was considerable need of visiting Boston, too, for Winthrop was in the beginning and ever since has been dependent upon the City. Today, to drive to Boston, we go over the Belle Isle Creek bridge to Orient Heights and thence the length of East Boston and into the city through the Sumner Tunnel. There was no bridge over Belle Isle Creek until 1839. Of interest is also the fact that the road across the marsh between Orient Heights and Beachmont, was not built until 1870, while the road which gave a direct route from Chelsea to Revere was not constructed until 1802.\n\nBoats served passengers and small loads of freight between\n\n21\n\nWinthrop and Boston, or Revere, or Chelsea, but the moving of heavy loads was difficult. For example, previous to the Revolution, if a Winthrop farmer, and all Winthrop people were farmers then, wanted to take a load of hay or a dozen beef cattle into market, he could drive only by a very roundabout way.\n\nHe would leave Winthrop by what is now Revere Street and pass along the eastern and northerly side of Beachmont to what is now Crescent Beach, Revere. Then he would go up Beach Street to what was then Chelsea Center, then over into Malden, to Medford via Everett, across the Mystic River into Somerville and on into Cambridge. Crossing the Charles near Harvard Square, he would finally arrive in what is now Brookline and then, turning east again, go through Roxbury and so into Boston by way of Roxbury Neck. This was described in the writing of the day to be about fourteen miles although today it would seem to be a much longer trip. In contrast, a sailing boat with a fair wind could make the trip in under an hour while a row boat could certainly reach Boston from Winthrop in an hour.\n\nThis roundabout travel continued for perhaps a century because Winthrop and Revere were very small, farming sections. During these hundred years, many changes took place. The forests were wiped out. The soil was placed under cultivation -- although with the primitive tools, with only horse and oxen to do what man's awn muscles did not, agriculture was exceedingly primitive. At about 1711, for example, a carefully made map located only four houses in Winthrop, one in Beachmont, two in other parts of Revere and four on the water's edge in Chelsea.\n\nTo serve the needs of these farms, several roads were laid out. These roads are not to be thought of as being real roads in the modern sense of a paved highway over which automotive vehicles roll at 40 to 50 miles an hour -- when the police are not around. These roads were mere dirt tracks, hub-deep in mud in the Spring, dusty in hot weather and frozen tangles of ruts in Winter. Indeed, farmers used these roads as little as possible, save in Winter, when snow covered the roughness. All heavy moving possible was held until snows were deep and over the smooth surface sleds skidded more easily than at any time of year. Actually, the first roads were just rutted tracks which were called roads because they were rights of way and because the more objectionable stumps and rocks were removed.\n\nUntil bridges were built, these roads were primarily fixed by running from one fordable place in a stream to the next. They avoided the steepest grades and made detours often a long way around to make their way across the marshes. As for foot travelers, almost everybody walked, or else rode horseback -- for to ride in the huge-wheeled carts over the rough surface of the\n\n22\n\nroads was sheer torture. Of course, it must always be remembered that Winthrop people commonly went to and from Boston by water -- safe, swift and easy. Winthrop people even went to church by boat, sailing up Belle Isle Inlet and down what is now the upper part of Boston harbor, near the present oil farm wharves and the gas tanks to as near Beach Street as possible. It was there, on Beach Street, near the present corner of School Street, behind the Library and the High School, that the First Church was built in 1710. Before that when Winthrop went to Church, services were either held in private homes, or else people sailed across the harbor to the churches at Boston itself -- about as near as the old Chelsea Church. This Rumney Marsh Church, which became Unitarian, is still standing, although somewhat reconstructed during its 250 years. It is the present home of Seaview Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons.\n\nAs Boston grew, and other towns, particularly to the south, as Plymouth, Taunton and the like developed, and as other towns, as Framingham and Worcester to the west, and Lynn, Salem and Newburyport to the north developed, the problem of land transportation became acute. Mails had to be carried and passengers clamored for stage coaches. Thus, of particular interest to Winthrop, the old Salem Turnpike was built -- probably the first real road in what is now the United States.\n\nThis pike ran from the Winnisimmet Ferry over the Mystic, between Charlestown and Chelsea to Salem. Basically, it was an old Indian trail, as indeed most of the early highways in New England were. The settlers used these trails and as such they served well enough for men and women on foot or on horse-back -- but of course no wheeled vehicle could roll over them until they were widened and smoothed. The Old Salem Turnpike which has been considerably moved about since the early days, was picked out a number of years ago by Channing Howard of Winthrop and Mellen Chamberlain of Chelsea.\n\n\"Starting at the old ferry site, this road continued past the old ferry tavern (Taverns were an integral part of travel in the 18th Century) eastward by the Shurtleff farm mansion house, along what is now Hawthorn Street, up the present line of Washington Avenue, around Slade's Corner where the Carter farm mansion stood, and where the road leading to Medford and Cambridge branches to the west (now County Road) and on to Sagamore Hill, now known as Mount Washington, past the Pratt House and thence through to North Revere, Cliftondale, Saugus, and Lynn to Salem. When the road across the Lynn marsh was built, the Salem pike was relocated to go across Chelsea, probably what is now Broadway, straight down Broadway, Revere and so into Lynn. This saved many miles. Today the highway of\n\n23\n\nRoute One, skips through the rear of Orient Heights, slides across Revere to cross the old pike at right angles and so to North Revere, Saugus and Danvers to the North.\" To reach Revere, Salem and even Newburyport, it is now necessary to turn right off the highway. In the old days, highways were built to connect towns; now they are built to avoid towns.\n\nThe first road in Winthrop of which there is any official record (probably the officials merely recognized an existing fact, when they got around to it) came in 1693 when the Selectmen of Boston, \"Iaid out\" a road which began at \"Bill Tewksbury's gate\" (there are many spellings of the name Tewksbury) at Pullin Point, along the shore by Beachmont to Crescent Beach and thence, turning left, up Beach Street, Revere, to the Chelsea church where it joined the Boston and Salem road.\n\nBy the time the Revolution came, this was about the physical condition of Winthrop, Revere and Chelsea. Men used the roundabout roads when they had to do so; otherwise they sailed or rowed boats. This may seem strange, because Boston in 1775 was the largest and most prosperous city in the colonies. The reason is that Winthrop, and to a minor degree less, Chelsea and Revere, were still farming communities -- actually one town.\n\nIn the early part of the 19th Century, Chelsea had grown and, as a separate town had its center with a town hall and a church at what is now Revere Center. A bridge was built across the Charles between Charlestown and Boston in 1785 -- before that the only way to leave Boston by land was out Roxbury Neck. Then when the Boston-Salem turnpike was built in 1802, a bridge was built over the Mystic between Charlestown and Chelsea. These conveniences to travel north and east resulted in a great development for Revere and Chelsea but Winthrop, being way out farther to the east was still aside from the stream of travel and commerce and hence drowsed along until almost the end of the 19th century as a peaceful farming community. The growth of Chelsea and Revere was so great that in 1846, Chelsea consented to Revere splitting away. Winthrop, of course went with Revere, a sort of tail to the dog.\n\nAt mid-century, just a hundred years ago, the third great geographical change was accomplished, Winthrop people, who had by then increased in number, began to chafe under the rule of Revere. Revere, for its part, was not at all concerned with the square mile of marsh and drumlins which was Winthrop and so, in 1852, Winthrop was established as the present town -- a separation which recent years have proved to be an excellent thing.\n\nWinthrop at that time was still primarily agricultural. From time to time there had been attempts to establish industry\n\n24\n\nbut all failed. sooner or later and Winthrop has remained practically industryless. From most points of view this has proved to be good -- for it has prevented the town from suffering the various evils and discomforts of industrial concentration. Economically, of course, there are disadvantages but on the whole Winthrop is very fortunate to be a town of homes alone.\n\nBeing so near Boston, Winthrop could not long continue to remain agricultural. Land increased in value to a point where it could not be profitably farmed. Outside pressure became so great that an opportunity developed for the division of the farms, and the subdivisions of the divisions so that almost every square foot of land, town property and marshes aside, became a house lot. There are few towns which are so thoroughly well built up as Winthrop is today -- just as there is no area of comparable charm so easily accessible to Boston.\n\nThe development of Winthrop out of farms to homes was made possible, by the establishment of transportation. Steamers plied for a time between the town and the city, but primarily it was the railroad which made the town's metamorphosis directly possible. Today the rails have been torn up and private cars and the bus line, feeding the Rapid Transit system at Orient Heights carry the load. Few communities are so thoroughly emptied of mornings and so filled up again at night in two brief peak loads as is Winthrop. But transportation is a story for a subsequent chapter.\n\n25\n\n----------------- Top\n\nChapter Two\n\nTHE INDIANS\n\nMUCH of the modern, popular idea of the Indian stems from the idealized and imaginative figures created by the motion pictures. The Indian actually was very far from a noble savage. Judged by white standards, the redskin was mean, cruel, dirty and -- in short, vermin. The old saying, \"The only good Indian is a dead Indian\" was a judgment based upon experience.\n\nThere can be no doubt that, according to their own lights, the Indians were justified in attempting to retaliate upon the white settlers. Any man worth his salt would fight by whatever means possible to save his home, his family and himself from brutalization and exile. No critic of the Indian, however bitter, would deny that the Indian was a first-class fighting man.\n\nThe trouble was that the Indian culture was so different from the European that the two could not exist side by side. On one ground alone, economic, this is abundantly clear. The Indians were primarily hunters. To subsist as such, a hunting culture requires comparatively vast areas of forest and water. The European culture was basically agricultural; a few acres would support a person. Thus New England could support a multitude more Englishmen than it could Indians. Now, to practice agriculture, it is necessary to destroy the forest cover, to allow the sun to strike in upon the soil. A hunting culture requires the forest be undisturbed. So -- conflict was inevitable and, given the superior weapons and social organization of the English, the result was inevitable. The Indian had to go. The manner of going can be criticised as having been far too brutal and bloody but sentimentalists of the 20th Century do not realize what the handful of whites faced.\n\nThere they were, a few men, women and children clutching grimly to a hand-hold along shore, practically safe only under the guns of their ships. Home and safety was not as now, perhaps 14 hours' flight away, but weeks and weeks of weary and uncertain voyaging over perilous seas in tiny ships. The settlers had to depend upon themselves. It is true they had muskets against the Indian bow and arrow and tomahawk-and scalping\n\n26\n\nknife. It is true that every able-bodied man and boy was a member of the militia, practically ex officio. It is true that the Indians could not withstand an attack by a body of militia.\n\nBut, the Indian traditionally followed a policy of strike and run. No one knew when at dawn, they would wake, if they did, to the sound of the warwhoop with their homes afire over their heads. So, the settlers were compelled to fight the Indians Indian fashion. They had to match savagery with even more brutal savagery. The only thing the Indian feared, and thus respected, was strength greater than he possessed. In other words, the Indian had to be shown it was not good business to kill a white man, woman or child. The showing consisted of the settlers killing Indian men, women and children. When the Great and General Court of Massachusetts put a bounty on Indian scalps just as it did on wolves and wildcats, it was not mere savagery but sober business. The Indians killed for scalps; the settlers must be encouraged to do likewise.\n\nThe early history of New England is bloody and bitter with its series of Indian wars -- with the Indians eventually being instigated and led by first the French and then the British. It is one of the ugliest chapters in human history -- but it must be read in light of the fact that conditions, social, religious, economic and moral, have changed greatly since the last warwhoop died away and the Indians were herded into reservations. In passing, it may be of interest to know that the Indians of New England, after being reduced to a mere fragment, are today increasing in numbers again. There are more Indians in New England now than there were in Civil War days.\n\nThe occupation of this area by humans before Boston was settled is obscure. Apparently, the original inhabitants, so far as is known, were the so-called Red Paint People. Graves have been found in Maine with the skeletons dyed red and with pots of red pigment buried close beside.\n\nEvidently, the Red Paint People were pushed out or exterminated by a nation of small-statured and swarthy aborigines who occupied at least all of northeastern America. How long they were here, where they came from -- and all the rest, is a matter of mere legend.\n\nVery likely, the small, dark people were in turn pushed out, by the familiar Indian of recorded history. These Indians, the red-skins, may have migrated out of Asia long, long ago, crossing into Alaska via the Bering Straits. Slowly these Indians made their way down the Pacific Coast, going southward until they either came into conflict with the tribes of Mexico, possibly the Mayas and the Incas, or their predecessors. Anyhow, the tide of red Indians turned left and came eastward across the Rockies\n\n27\n\nand into the great Mississippi Basin, There, they moved north as well as east. Finally, a portion of them occupied the Northeast, pushing out the small, dark people mentioned. The exiles seem to have gone north and east and it is possible that they are today either the Esquimaux or else their blood runs in Esquimaux veins.\n\nThe red Indians in the North East were members of what is called the Algonquian Nation -- an immense but very loose con-federation of tribes. Practically, the only reason for such a nation being established by scholars is that the tribes so united spoke a language with a common or Algonquian stock.\n\nFor greater concern, the Eastern Indians were so-called forest Indians which is to say their culture, being dependent upon the forest which covered their holdings, was very different from the culture of the Indians of the Great Plains, where trees were almost unknown, where the staff of life was buffalo. It is these Plains Indians, such as the Sioux, proud, fierce, eagle-nosed, and very accomplished fighters, that set the standard of the popular idea of the Indian. Eastern or woods Indians did not have horses to ride, nor did they wear the picturesque war bonnet. They were extinguished with comparative ease while the Sioux, for example, stood off the Army of the United States, such of it as was employed, for more than a generation.\n\nThe Indians of New England were sharply divided into various tribes -- although this word is actually a very loose term. The white settlers from England had a habit of naming the Indians according to the locality in which they lived, being particularly fond of naming a \"tribe\" after a river -- as the Kennebecs and the Penobscots in Maine. The French settlers also bestowed tribal names and the result was that historians are somewhat confused, since often the same group of Indians were given two or even more names. Thus the Indians who lived in Winthrop and vicinity have not been positively identified as to their tribe. There is a general understanding that they were members of the Massachusetts tribe but that is indefinite. Perhaps, as some authorities assert, the Indians of Metropolitan Boston were Pawtuckets. The point is unimportant. The serious point is that these Indians when the Puritans came were in a sorry condition. This was a very. fortunate circumstance -- for the settlers.\n\nThe old Norse sagas speak of the fighting quality and the strength and numbers of the Indians. Armed with swords, the Vikings, who were the best fighting men of Europe at the time, were no match for the savages -- who probably overwhelmed the Norsemen by sheer force of numbers and thus extinguished the colonies, or colony. Certainly, after the experience of the Vikings, Europeans had a healthy respect for the red men.\n\n28\n\nNo one knows how many Indians lived in and around Boston in the early days. Fishermen had frequented the coast, including Boston Bay, for many years prior to \"discovery\" and settlement. These traded with the Indians somewhat and, on the whole maintained a friendly relationship -- since the fishermen did not try to settle permanently. From reports of these rough and ready spirits, strange tales found their way into the British mind. The woods of New England were imagined to be filled with wild beasts as horrid as anything a modern geologist can imagine while the Indians were counted as being \"numberless as the leaves upon the trees.\"\n\nOne of the first and, possibly best estimates of Indians numbers, although it is probably greatly exaggerated, is that made by the Sieur Des Monts, who anchored his little ships off the Winthrop shore, towards Noddle's Island, in 1605 and named Boston Harbor, Port St. Louis, and claimed the area for the King of France.\n\nDes Monts asserted that Boston was the center of a vast Indian population, one numbering between 150,000 and 200,000 souls. There may have been that many Indians then in all New England, although that too is very doubtful. The country simply would not support that many humans in a hunting culture.\n\nThe description Des Monts gives of the Indians at Boston is interesting -- if he was a poor census taker. He said that around about the harbor some thirty thousand fighting men were busy carrying fire and massacre into the villages of neighboring tribes, while they stood ready, to use his terms, to repel any attempt at settlement. The Indians, he reported lived in villages of bark houses, each large enough to shelter 30 or 40 persons, with the entire village fortified by a stout palisade of logs. These logs, poles is probably the better term, for the Indians did not have the tools to handle heavy timbers, were in turn surrounded by deep ditches. Entrance into the village was by a single plank (log is probably the better word) laid across the ditch and giving into a very narrow gate. Thus each village was very easily defended, against the stone-age weapons of the Indians themselves In actual combat with the settlers later, the villages were of course death traps, for just as they kept other Indians out so they kept the inhabitants caged. The white militia, as in King Philip's War, simply surrounded the village stealthily and then, at a signal, discharged their muskets into the village, setting it ablaze. Any Indian trying to escape was shot down and so the entire village was wiped out, men, women, children and dogs.\n\nOf the Islands in the harbor, Des Monts speaks particularly, saying that they were occupied by Indian villages surrounded by fields of corn, beans, squash (pumpkins) and tobacco. Great\n\n29\n\nfleets of canoes swarmed out of the various inlets of the harbor to examine the little ship of Des Monts (it weighed but 17 tons) and the French admiral, awed by the display of Indian might, determined that fair and rich as Boston was, it could not be settled in face of the fierce Indians. So he turned north, after visiting Cape Cod, and settled the French in Acadia. Thus Indian curiosity over a white man's ship prevented the French taking possession of New England.\n\nCaptain John Smith, the great English adventurer, when he visited New England in 1614-15, had this to report to his backers of Boston and vicinity. \"The country ... is the paradise of these parts, the sea coast as you pass shows you all along large corn fields and great troops of well-proportioned people. We found the people in these parts kindly but in their fury no less valiant.\"\n\nA year later, a French trading vessel, probably very small by modern standards, anchored off Lovell's Island. A war party attacked the ship and killed the crew with the exception of four men who were taken as wild animals might be captured. Under careful guard, the unlucky Frenchmen were taken from one Indian village to the next and exhibited to the curiosity of the savages. Undoubtedly, the squaws were not kind. The fate of the slaves is not known; likely enough it was not merciful for the four were seized in retaliation for a raid by a Captain Hunt in 1614. Hunt seized about twenty Indians and took them to Spain where he sold them into slavery.\n\nHad John Winthrop, and the Pilgrims at Plymouth for that matter, attempted settlement during these years, the fate of the two first towns might have been very different. It seems unlikely the proud and able Indians of eastern Massachusetts would have allowed white men to seize their land and level their forests. However, about 1617 or 1618, a fierce pestilence swept through the Indian villages. Possibly it was smallpox; probably it was a European disease which was communicated to the Indians by some fisherman or sailor. In any event, the Indians were very nearly wiped out of existence; only an impotent handful remaining.\n\nAnd these few suffered further destruction at the hands of a very fierce tribe from Maine, the Tarrantines. The Tarrantines and the Massachusetts tribe were traditional enemies. For many years, the Massachusetts had been strong enough not only to hold the Maine Indians at arm's length but also had inflicted serious harm by almost annual raids. When the Tarrantines learned of the pestilence, they swept down and completed the ruin of the once very powerful Indians, particularly those along the coast of Massachusetts. Probably not three hundred fighting\n\n30\n\nmen were left of all the Massachusetts tribe in 1620 when the Pilgrims came and in 1630 when the Puritans arrived.\n\nWinthrop was certainly one of the choice items of Indian real estate but there is no knowledge of any particular activity here. In fact, there never was any Indian trouble within the limits of the town.\n\nCertainly Indians lived here and probably in the Summer months, this was an Indian summer resort for members of friendly Indian groups. Indians commonly established two residences. During the warm months, they resorted to the sea shore, where they lived on fish and clams and lobsters. In the Fall, they returned inland, harvested the crops which they had planted in the Spring and then settled down deep in the forest to live the cold, starving months away with the help of wild game. When Spring returned, they planted their gardens and left once more for the seashore. Probably Winthrop was one such resort although there were unquestionably Indians in permanent residence here -- not very many, because there was not sufficient forest area to support a large village.\n\nThe Winthrop Indians at about the time of the pestilence were under the chieftainship of Nanepashemet (variously spelled). He probably ruled from a tribal village in Lynn or Saugus but after the Tarrantine attack had completed what the pestilence began, this chief moved his headquarters inland and erected a fortified village on the banks of the Mystic just north and west of the present Medford Square. This was tidal area then, for the lock at the Square had not been built -- of course. Here the chief was attacked by raiding Tarrantines in 1619, and although he and his men fought valiantly, they were all slaughtered.\n\nHe left a widow, the Squaw Sachem, and three sons; Nonohaquaham, Montowampate, and Winepoykin, or as they were better known to the English, Sagamore John, Sagamore James, and Sagamore George, respectively. The widow more or less retired to Salem and left the government of the stricken tribe to her three sons. Winthrop's Indians came at first under the jurisdiction of John, who was a kindly man and admired the English. He wore English clothes and was apparently converted to Christianity.\n\nJames, who took over after John's death, was much less friendly to the settlers. It is reported, although no confirmation can be found, that James led an attack upon Samuel Maverick's farm in Chelsea. He was the first settler in Winnisimmet, preceding the Puritans. Maverick was a stalwart soul and he repulsed the Indians so fiercely that there was never again any trouble with the Indians in this area. That may be the reason\n\n31\n\nfor no Indian trouble here but it would be more pleasing to believe another explanation. This one runs that the Indians here were attacked by an epidemic of smallpox in 1633. The victims were abandoned by their own people but the white settlers moved in and nursed the Indians at the risk of their own lives. Despite stories to the contrary, Indians do feel gratitude and did exhibit that virtue. Hence this may explain why there never was any trouble here. Of course, Boston was too big for an Indian attack and Winthrop was under the shadow of the big town. Also, there were very few Indians left hereabouts when serious Indian troubles came.\n\nAnyhow, James did not like the English at all, feeling that they would complete the ruin of the Massachusetts tribe that the pestilence and the Tarrantines had so well begun. His animosity failed to amount to anything, however, for he died very soon. The third brother, Sagamore George, then took over the reins of Indian government and he at once began to make trouble for the settlers at Rumney Marsh and Pullin Point. Being comparatively well educated, he substituted the courts for the tomahawk and for some ten years he kept the settlers in an anxious state. George contended the settlers held their land by illegal title. He brought suit after suit in the inferior courts and filed petition after petition with the General Court. These were all eventually dismissed but at the time the legality of the charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony itself was in question in Parliament.\n\nUndoubtedly, the English kings had been careless with their gifts and charters-but then no one had the least idea of the extent of America. After all, gifts and charters were just words on paper concerned with a miserable wilderness three thousand miles overseas. So the settlers at Pullin Point, just in case, gave in to Sagamore George for the sake of security and purchased their lands from him, for trifles, on June 4, 1685. Soon afterwards, the suit was dismissed in the British courts and the validity of the Massachusetts Bay Colony charter affirmed. So the Pullin Point settlers once again received new titles to their lands from the colony and so rested secure.\n\nThere is eyebrow lifting over the small payments the whites gave the Indians for the lands. However, there is no evidence that the settlers dealt unfairly, in this particular at least, with the Indians. The Indians were satisfied with what they accepted; they had to be, for under the General Court all men, red or white, were treated with impartiality. Any Indian could recover property unjustly held by a settler.\n\nIt must be remembered too that the Indians were the object of official as well as much individual and private concern and\n\n32\n\nloving-kindness, to use the old word now unhappily out of use. Indeed, it was one of the objects of Boston to Christianize the Indians. The bringing of the Gospel to the Indians was as earnestly projected as were the missionary labors of the Catholic Church in Spanish dominions to the south. Methods differed between Mexico. and Boston but zeal was the same. It was duty to bring the word of God to the heathen and the Puritans did what they could.\n\nHowever, the Boston Indians were different in character from the limp and indifferent Indians of Mexico and Peru. The New England savage was a brave and stalwart person who would rather fight than do most anything else. They were stubborn and conversion proceeded slowly indeed. Aside from the character of the Indians, the Puritans faced an impossible task.\n\nJust for an example, Christianization meant adopting the white man's ethics. This meant work, hard work and regular work, for idleness was a very grave Puritan sin. The Indian would labor long and hard when hunting or fishing. Then he rested, between feasts and games and dances. Now and then he took time off to enjoy a little fighting with an enemy tribe. It was their way of life. Regular employment was utterly abhorrent. The Indian, once he was crushed into impotence, was finally allowed more or less officially to go his own way.\n\nThe fear and hatred of the Indian still persisted, however, and in King Philip's war -- the final attempt of the Indians to push the whites back into the sea -- it was thought advisable to herd the Indians together in a safe place so there would be no depredations, however friendly and spiritless the Boston Indians professed to be. So, in November of 1675, the General Court established what amounted to a concentration camp on Deer Island. Here several hundred Indians were unceremoniously confined. Neither food nor fuel was provided.; they had to make the most of what the little Island offered. For two years the Indians were thus kept out of harm's way, at the cost of their great privation and downright suffering. It is not a pleasant picture.\n\nDuring the years of joint habitation by whites and reds, no settler ever thought of making any record or preserving any tools and materials of the Indian. They were merely tolerated and soon were liquidated -- those left alive joining larger villages to the north and west. Then for many years the Indians were completely forgotten. During the past 100 years, particularly during the past two decades, under the inspiration of Sidvin Frank Tucker, custodian of the Town Museum in the Public Library, some amount of Indian relics have been collected and preserved.\n\n33\n\nOne of the outstanding \"finds\" was made in 1888 when, under the direction of Channing Howard, town engineer for many years, Indian graves were uncovered while grading was in progress for the construction of the Boston, Revere-Beach and Lynn Railroad. The site was at about the platform of the Center Station, where today Jefferson Street runs into Woodside Avenue. Harry Whorf, then a boy recently brought to Winthrop by his family, was intensely interested, and joined Mr. Howard in photographing the graves' contents. These consisted of some ten graves, each about three feet deep. In addition to the skeletons of men, women and children, some pottery, arrowheads, stone tools and the like were preserved. One Indian did not die in his bed for an arrowhead was found imbedded in his spine. The materials were turned over to the Peabody Museum at Harvard for preservation.\n\nSometime later another skeleton was found when the foundation was dug for the Edward B. Newton School on Pauline Street. Of interest is also the fact that an old deed gives as one boundary the old Indian fort, which was about where the present Baptist Church is located. This was not a fort at all in the modern sense; probably being nothing more than a wooden palisade with, perhaps, a ditch on the outside.\n\nJust how the Indians in Winthrop lived must be surmised since there is no record. However, it is probable that they lived like the other Massachusetts Indians in nearby areas.\n\nIn appearance, the Massachusetts Indians were of \"decent aspect.\" They were between five and six feet in height and had the characteristic aquiline features. The bust of an Indian used by the National Shawmut Bank of Boston is considered a reasonably good, although idealized, portrait of a local Indian. The Indian women were hardly handsome, by European standards, but \"reasonably attractive.\" Some of the settlers, following the example of the earlier seasonal fishermen from Europe, entered into relations with these squaws and described them as being \"handsome and well-formed, well-mannered and continent.\"\n\nContrary to popular opinion, these Eastern forest Indians did not wear feathers to any extent-certainly not like the war bonnets of the Sioux. Boys wore their hair long until manhood and then cut it off variously, leaving the scalp-lock. It is likely that the shape of the \"hair cut\" was something of a tribal badge so that one scalp could be distinguished from another.\n\nBoth men and women were fond of decorating themselves in various ways. In the green of the Summer forest and the black and white of Winter, color was highly prized by these primitives. While some of the warriors chose to burn patterns\n\n34\n\nof scars on face and abdomen by means of irons heated in a fire, most decoration consisted of the application of various pigments, usually native earths. Much of this painting was done on the face. Men excelled at this art and any really serious decoration was their masculine prerogative. The various reds and blacks and yellows as well as the patterns used, had religious, military and social significance. Black was reserved for war while red was more or less social. Whites, blues and yellows were also used. Women used black for mourning alone. To make themselves attractive, they commonly used blue upon their cheeks, instead of the rouge our women use.\n\nClothing ran through a wide latitude; it was chiefly a matter of the weather. In Summer, and indoors when the huts were warm enough, commonly nothing at all was worn. Usually, however, both men and women seem to have considered a sort of breech garment as the foundation of their apparel. These \"pants\" were made of various animal materials, such as buckskin, tanned until soft and pliable. Very frequently, the skins of various wild animals were employed, either shaved of fur or with the fur left in place. When going into the Woods, as hunting, the men wore leather leggings to protect their shins. These, as most tanned garments, were often painted with more or less geometrical designs in blue and red and yellow.\n\nOn their feet, men and women usually wore the Indian moccasin. The style of these varied from tribe to tribe. In warm weather the moccasins were low-cut but in the Winter they were higher, something like the snow-pacs familiar in Canada today. When snows were deep, leggings were worn by both men and women, often being held in place by leather straps which fastened upwards to the bottom of the breech clout like garters. This strapping was peculiarly a woman's attire, however; men usually scorning such limitation of freedom of action.\n\nWe hear much about buckskin shirts. Apparently the Indians did not use them until they came to copy the shirts worn by the settlers. Instead, when the weather was cold, the Indians simply draped the upper part of their bodies in a robe-like wrap made of fur. These robes hung about the shoulders and were belted in at the waist. For outdoor wear, they were short enough to reach to the knees but indoors the robes were long enough to actually trail upon the ground. Raccoon skins were highly prized for these robes and wild-cat was also popular. Only wealthy Indians could afford such garments.\n\nUsually the robes were of deerskin or moosehide, tanned to a remarkable whiteness which afforded a good background for the ornamental Indian paintings. The robes were not stitched on the right side at all and only a little on the left. Thus the right\n\n35\n\narm was usually bare and the left arm could be bared quickly when need for action arose. In coldest weather, robe was piled on robe. The Indians, inured to even New England weather from birth, were doubtless comfortable enough -- for the settlers often remarked that they would appear nearly naked in chilly weather and yet be thoroughly warm.\n\nProbably the Indians were like birds and animals; they obtained body heat by eating heavily in cold weather and more lightly when the season was warm. However, the Indians, like all wild creatures, seldom stinted themselves. They ate what there was when it was available. Then they would sleep until hunger woke them again. Then they would gorge themselves and sleep. This process continued until war or the need for obtaining more food spurred them into activity.\n\nThe settlers often referred to the Indians as dirty. This was only the careless use of a derogatory adjective, for the Indians as a whole were cleaner about their person than the average settler. They bathed freely and frequently and brushed their teeth mornings with a \"brush\" made by chewing the end of a twig until it was frayed. The men did not shave. Indian men do not have heavy beards, like white men, to begin with, and what hairs did sprout were carefully, if painfully, plucked out one by one. The hair of the heads of women (men wore just a scalp lock) was worn long and was naturally black, thick and coarse in texture. This hair was frequently dressed with animal fat to make it glossy like the plumage of a crow. It was odoriferous.\n\nContrary to the usual idea, these Massachusetts Indians did not live in tepees or wigwams. Instead they lived in very unromantic huts. These were of two kinds -- the long house and the round house.\n\nThe long house, usually the Winter abode, was rectangular in shape and was about 25 feet in width and as long as was necessary to accommodate the several families who built it and shared it. Some may have been as much as 100 feet in length. The idea of these community dwellings was that since each family maintained a fire, the long house, for all its flimsy construction, was usually fairly warm. These were the original American tenements, although horizontal instead of vertical. Sanitary arrangements were very simple; the whole outdoors was just outside.\n\nThese long houses were built by setting up parallel walls of frame-work of poles lashed together. The roof united the walls and held them firmly in place, being built of limber poles bent in an arch so as to give a round arch form to the cross-section. The framework was covered not with skins but with\n\n36\n\nsheets of bark. Birch was the best, since it peeled off easily in great sheets. The bark, cut into convenient squares, was dried under pressure and then sewn to the framework with leather thongs.\n\nRound houses, which were for Summer use as a rule, were much smaller, since they were usually used by individual families or, at the most, two or three closely related families, such as married children come home to live with the old folks. These round houses were hemispherical, being made by setting a circle of limber poles in the ground and then bending them inwards to the center where they were lashed together. Bark was used to sheathe them often although mats woven of marsh grass and reeds were also employed. These same mats were sometimes used indoors in Winter as floor coverings at the point where people sat or slept -- usually the same place.\n\nThe round houses had two doors; usually one to the south-west and one to the north-east. Thus in warm weather, the prevailing south-west wind could blow right through. When the weather was foul, the doors could be closed. Long houses usually had as many doors as there were families living inside -- and each family used its own door. These doors were just holes in the walls which were covered by a curtain of skins.\n\nIn the Summer, the Indians kept all fires outside, for they were used only for cooking. In the Winters, in the long houses, each family had its own fire. A hearth was made by building a low platform of stones in the middle of the family's space. There was a hole directly above in the roof and some of the smoke found its way out -- eventually. The rising current of warm air effectually kept rain and snow out of these holes.\n\nThe government of the Indians was very simple and very strict -- violation of the code was punished by fines of furs or by the imposition of servitude to the injured person for a fitting period of time. Theft was considered a very grave matter if it was from a member of the village. Theft from an enemy was considered an admirable matter. Murder was not regarded too seriously and could be paid off by fines as a rule, if members of the victim's family did not take immediate and private revenge. One murder was considered wiped out by another.\n\nAs a rule, the village, or tribe, was ruled by two great chiefs, with subordinate chiefs in other villages subject to the largest one. One of these chiefs was a sort of political leader, a sachem. He was the arbiter of most things and held stern rein over all his subjects. Commonly, this chief held office by right of heredity, although, in case of a vacancy, a political leader could be chosen out of the ranks -- the choice usually being made on the basis of demonstrated wisdom and ability.\n\n37\n\nThe other chief was the war leader. He was chosen not by heredity but by his demonstrated ability. He must be a skilled warrior, of course, and have plenty of scalps to attest his prowess. More important, however, was his skill in organizing and leading a raid, plus his ability to plan and maintain the defenses of the villages. Sometimes these two types of chiefs were united in a single person but usually the heredity, political chief was not considered able to lead the warriors.\n\nUnder the chieftains were the elders of the tribe, who sat as a sort of council. With them sat the warriors, who could take part in councils. It is not clear how voting upon a decision was made, if at all. However, every least detail of the community life was determined in these councils with the political chief or sub-chief, in the case of a subsidiary village, as a sort of moderator. All Indians were passionately devoted to oratory and the council would sit for hours listening with delight as various members expounded their opinions in prose of inordinate length and ornamentation. A gift for oratory was priceless to the Indians and their great orators were, commonly, their great leaders; the gift of fluency and articulateness was the passport to advancement within the tribes.\n\nTo the settlers, the Indians were savage heathens. Nevertheless, the Indians did have a very real and a very serious religion which they lived devoutly. Indeed, few white men were ever so conscious of the other world as were the Indians. Of course, the Indians had no formal theology or church. They all believed, instinctively, in a Supreme Being -- who was for all His indefiniteness, a very real influence in their lives. He was vague and far away but was the ultimate arbiter of their future in the Happy Hunting Grounds.\n\nJust as real, was the Indians' sense of evil. This was not personified as Satan, for the Indians did not employ anthropomorphism in their religion.\n\nBoth these forces, the first for good, and the other for bad, were operating for the Indian through minor units. For the sake of simplicity and understanding these forces were associated with the forces of Nature and with wild animals. Each Indian had a guardian spirit who was always with him and was ready to help him in peril or in case of real need. At the same time, evil influences were constantly waiting to attack him, to lay traps for his unwary feet. To gain the support of the good, the Indian commonly resorted to prayer, not necessarily formal in the Christian sense. Also, since there is always a good deal of magic entering into a primitive religion, they resorted to carrying amulets of one kind or another. There should be no mistaking the religious personality of the Indian, however. Voices spoke\n\n38\n\nto him in the winds, in the forest and on the water. The behavior of birds and of animals was always indicative of warning or, equally so, advance word of good fortune.\n\nAnd according to their lights, the Indians observ"
