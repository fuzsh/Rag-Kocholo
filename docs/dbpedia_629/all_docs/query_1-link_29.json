        "meta_description": "For the curators, archivists, and librarians working in Special Collections Divisions across the state and the country, maintaining a historical record through the collection of manuscripts, multimedia, and printed forms is not only important to their work, but also necessary to their institutions. Despite all of this, we are often unaware of the need to maintain our own records for future use.  A History of Special Collections is an exhibition that considers the archival history of the archives themselves, and demonstrates the importance of developing and maintaining such institutional knowledge.   From the early antecedents in the Utah Room to the most contemporary iteration, this exhibition traces the trajectory and evolution of the Special Collections Division at the Marriott Library over the last seven decades. What’s revealed is a story of dedication, scholarship, and commitment to research and access.",

        "text": "1850-1900\n\n1850: The story of Special Collections begins as early as 1850, with the founding of both the Territory of Utah and the University of Deseret... The first University Librarian was William Ivins Appleby.\n\n1869: John R. Park becomes President of the University of Utah (1869-1892).\n\n1874: John R. Park opens the library and reading room, stocked with his personal collection on loan to the University. The reading room provided seating for fifty students.\n\n1891: George Q. Coray becomes Head Librarian (1891-1906).\n\n1897: Joseph T. Kingsbury becomes President of the University of Utah (1897-1916).\n\n1900-1910\n\n1901: The library was located in what is now the LeRoy Cowles Building on Presidents Circle. It housed 12,950 volumes and provided seating for 100 students out of a student body of 765. The Cowles building housed the original library of the University of Utah until 1913, when the collection was moved to the Park Building.\n\n1906: Esther Nelson becomes Head Librarian (1906-1941).\n\n1910-1920\n\n1914: Librarian Esther Nelson writes a letter to Utah Governor, William Spry, and urges him to consider purchasing a collection of Mormon literature belonging to Eli H. Pierce for a total of $6,000. The collection, instead, goes to Harvard.\n\n1916: John A Widtsoe becomes President of the University of Utah (1916-1921).\n\n1920-1930\n\n1921: George Thomas becomes President of the University of Utah (1921-1941).\n\n1930-1940\n\n1935: The George Thomas Library is completed. The building also served as the Utah Museum of Natural History, and later the Crocker Science Center. The Utah Museum of Natural History moved to Research Park in 2011.\n\n1940-1950\n\n1941: Leonard H. Kirkpatrick takes over as Head Librarian from Esther Nelson at the Thomas Library. He sought to make Utahns more knowledgeable about the history of their state and made several shrewd purchases for the library, many of which are in today's Special Collections. As the Thomas Library grew more crowded with each passing year, Kirkpatrick began a campaign for library expansion and finally for a new building (1941-1962).\n\nLeRoy E. Cowles becomes President of the University of Utah (1941-1946).\n\n1946: The University Library receives $5,000 to purchase a collection of approximately 3,000 volumes from former University President, John A. Widtsoe.

Willard Marriott Library can be traced back to the mid-nineteenth century, with the founding of both the University of Deseret and the Utah Territorial Library. The University of Deseret was established on February 28, 1850, with Orson Spencer appointed as Chancellor. Due to economic hardships, however, suitable space, educated instructors, and books were in short supply. After three very difficult years, the budding University was forced to temporarily suspend operations. Although the need for higher learning was strong, the financial foundation was simply not strong enough.\n\nBy 1869, conditions in the Utah Territory began to gradually change. Relations with the Federal government had improved and the transcontinental railroad was recently completed. Territorial leaders began to prioritize the University once more. In 1869, John R. Park was hired to be the University’s first president. Within the first few years of his tenure, Park determined that the need for a university library was both immediate and great. In order to fill the shelves, he decided to loan his personal collection of books – more than two thousand volumes – to the institution. Park held the position of University President until 1892. Two years later, on June 9, 1894 his entire private library was formally given to the University. These volumes can now be found within Special Collections, identified by Park’s signature.\n\nThe Utah Territorial Library was established the same year as the University of Deseret and within the first two years included some 3,000 volumes in its holdings. In 1891 however, a majority of those titles were transferred to the University of Deseret. When Utah finally became a state in 1896, the remaining books from the Territorial Library became part of the State Library’s collection, now called the Utah State Law Library. Today, the holdings transferred from the Utah Territorial Library have been dispersed throughout Special Collections, identified by a red oval stamp.\n\nIn 1941, Leonard H. Kirkpatrick became the Head Librarian at the University Library and for the next two decades, he dealt with the tumultuous changes brought on by both The Great Depression and World War II. Fortunately for Kirkpatrick, A. Ray Olpin became the University President at just the right time, bringing with him a new vision which saw the Library as the center of both research and educational programs, asserting that “a great school without a great library is an impossibility.” Kirkpatrick and his assistant, Ralph D. Thomson, translated President Olpin’s vision for the University into action with the official beginning of the Utah Room in 1946.\n\nCATALOGUE OF THE UTAH TERRITORIAL LIBRARY\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: 1852\n\nZ881 U8\n\nCATALOGUE OF BOOKS IN THE LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF DESERET\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: Printed at the Deseret News Steam Printing Establishment, 1875\n\nZ664 S3 A3\n\nA NEW FAMILY ENCYLOPEDIA\n\nCharles A.

H. Kirkpatrick was able to seek out and purchase notable collections related to Utah history. The first of its kind was purchased in 1946, when a fund of $5,000 was allotted to the Library for the acquisition of the John A. Widtsoe Collection of Mormon Americana. Widtsoe was the University of Utah President from 1916-1921 and had also served in various capacities in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His personal library consisted of approximately three thousand items and included early Mormon periodicals such as the Elder’s Journal and the Evening and Morning Star. A separate room with its own catalog formally opened in room 101 of the Thomas Building. Widtsoe’s daughter, Anna Widtsoe Wallace, was perhaps the only other person truly familiar with the Widtsoe collection and was selected to supervise the newly-opened Utah Room.\n\nBUILDING PLAN: GEORGE THOMAS LIBRARY\n\nThe construction of the George Thomas Library was completed in 1935. As the Thomas Library grew more crowded with each passing year, Head Librarian L. H. Kirkpatrick began a campaign for library expansion and finally for a new building. The Thomas Building also served as the Utah Museum of Natural History, and later the Crocker Science Center.\n\nELDER’S JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN STATES MISSION\n\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n\nAtlanta, GA: Benjamin E.

Widtsoe Library Collection\n\nThe Utah Room held a special place in Kirkpatrick’s favor. He saw the collection of Mormon Americana, Utah History, and University of Utah materials as an important area for research possibilities. Unsatisfied with the acquisition of the Widtsoe collection, Kirkpatrick and Thomson embarked on an extensive campaign to garner new personal libraries. The second notable collection for the Utah Room was the acquisition of John Mills Whitaker Collection. Whitaker was not only the Secretary to Church President John Taylor, but he was Taylor’s son-in-law as well. Among the items received from Whitaker were The Juvenile Instructor, The Contributor, and The Improvement Era. The Library also received permission to photocopy Whitaker’s journal, in which he had “recorded events without missing a day.”\n\nTHE JUVENILE INSTRUCTOR\n\nGeorge Q.

This journal, which dates from 1869-1886 was written in shorthand, partially inspired from a system of writing developed by Sir Isaac Pitman. The original journals were later donated by the Whitaker family.\n\nSALVATION AND HOW TO OBTAIN IT\n\nJohn Mills Whitaker (1863-1960)\n\nBrooklyn, NY: A. P. Kesler, 1900s\n\nBX8639 W44 S3 1900z\n\nDuring this same period, Kirkpatrick had negotiated the acquisition of Judge Tillman D. Johnson’s personal library. Judge Johnson had served as Utah’s Second District Court Judge from 1915-1949 and had collected a personal library of a wide range of materials on subjects related to the “West.” Kirkpatrick would describe the collection as “excellent Western Americana, with particular strength for such states as Wyoming, Colorado, and Nevada, along with a fine collection of Indian material and a good set of first editions of Mark Twain.” A special bookplate was designed for the collection by Carol Selby.\n\nTHE TILLMAN D.

Johnson Library Collection.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, the Library received the first set of Congressional papers from Congressman William A. Dawson. Dawson served as a Utah State Senator from 1940-1944, and held two terms as a State Representative from 1947-1949 and 1953-1959. With the acquisition of the John Whitaker Collection, Tillman Johnson’s personal library, and the Congressional papers of William Dawson, the holdings of the Utah Room began to broaden into the genre of Western Americana.\n\nCAMPAIGN LITERATURE\n\nWilliam A. Dawson Papers, 1902-1971\n\nMS0031 Bx 1\n\nCampaign literature from the 1954 and 1956 elections.\n\nSPECIAL COLLECTIONS AND THE MARRIOTT GIFT\n\nIn anticipation of the move to the new library building in 1968, the Utah Room officially changed its name in 1967 to “Western Americana, Rare Books, and University Archives” in order to better reflect its holdings. At the time, the growing collection included approximately 33,000 bound volumes and 61,000 unbound volumes. It was clear that there was a great need for a director to oversee the operations, advocate for increased staffing and budget, and build the collection into one that would soon see international acclaim. For this role, Ralph Thomson, approached the Director of the Utah State Historical Society, Everett Cooley, promising him creative freedom and a substantial budget. He accepted the position and began work on January 1, 1969.\n\nAlmost immediately after Cooley’s arrival, things began to change. That previous year, John Willard Marriott, Sr. had donated one million dollars for library acquisitions – the largest single contribution ever received by the University at that time. For his gift, the current five-story building was named in his honor. Fortunately, for Cooley, the Acquisitions Librarian, David Laird, was a close friend and shared similar interests in the collection of Western Americana materials and other items related to Native American histories. Laird would end up playing a major role in locating and recommending purchases for the collection.\n\nTHE MARRIOTT GIFT\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: University of Utah Libraries, 1972\n\nZ733 U87 1972\n\nUsing the Marriott funds, Cooley was able to purchase over fifty percent of the titles listed in The Plains and the Rockies. This \"Wagner-Camp bibliography,\" as it is often called, contains books published about the West during the years between 1805-1860. Combined with the library of Judge Tillman D. Johnson, these acquisitions placed the Marriott Library among the top dozen university libraries with significant Wagner-Camp holdings.\n\nTHE PLAINS AND THE ROCKIES\n\nHenry r.

Of these titles, some 350 could be considered classics in the field. The History of Science collection included first and early editions from the likes Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Andreas Vesalius, and Andreas Cellarius, to name but a few. In 1971, the department changed its name once again, this time to Special Collections.\n\nOPTICKS\n\nIsaac Newton (1642-1727)\n\nLondon: Printed for S. Smith and B.

Entrepreneur and philanthropist, Obert C. Tanner also contributed greatly to growth of the department during that time.\n\nThroughout his life, Tanner and his wife, Grace, generously donated to communities, universities, parks, the arts, and the people of the State of Utah. They were patrons of the Utah Symphony, Ballet West, and the Utah Opera Company. They endowed the biennial \"Gift of Music\" concerts of the Utah Symphony and Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and established the \"Tanner Lectures on Human Values,\" providing annual ethics lectures at nine prestigious universities in the United States and England. Throughout the valley, the family name can be found on buildings, fountains, and even parks.\n\nIn 1971, O. C. Tanner established the Annie Clark Tanner Room at the Marriott Library, in memory of his mother. The room was thereby converted into a special reading room for patrons of Special Collections. The following year, Tanner developed the Annie Clark Tanner Memorial Trust, in order to publish limited editions of books on Utah, the Mormons, and the West. The first volume, A Mormon Mother: An Autobiography of Annie Clark Tanner was published in 1973. The most popular title of the series – selling more than 10,000 copies in the first decade – A Mormon Mother has since gone through various reprints, which continue to sell out.\n\nDuring his tenure as head of Special Collections, Cooley oversaw the publication of eleven books in the Tanner Trust Series, acting as the General Editor while Margery Ward held the responsibility of the Press Editor.\n\nTWELVE MORMON HOMES\n\nElizabeth Wood Kane\n\nDallas, TX: S.

However, it was not until 1972 that an official Friends of the Library organization was established. Responsible for developing the Friends group were Brigham Madsen, Director of Libraries, Gus Hanniball, Extension Librarian, and Everett Cooley, Director of Special Collections.\n\nThe mission of the Friends of the Marriott Library is simple:\n\nTo provide for enrichment of learning, and promote the public welfare and cultural opportunities through library programs.\n\nTo sponsor lectures, informal discussion groups, exhibits, and other means for people to become acquainted and share their enthusiasm for learning, books, and other library media.\n\nTo organize alumni and other friends of the University of Utah in efforts to broaden public understanding and appreciation of the facilities, collections, work, and activities of the Marriott Library.\n\nTo assist in expanding the resources of the library by encouraging monetary gifts, bequests and memorials, and the donation of collections and other library materials.\n\nTo acquire unique publications and to publish significant works based on unusual holdings in possession of the Marriott Library.\n\nEverett Cooley became very involved in organizing the programs, fundraisers, and events for the Friends of the Marriott Library. And with help from the Friends, the Library was able to purchase for Special Collections its two-millionth volume, the sixteenth-century herbal Historia Stirpium by Leonhart Fuchs. One need only look through the Friends Scrapbook and read the Annual Reports to see all the positive contributions the Friends made to the Library. Among these are the acquisitions of the Columbian Press, the Catlin Portfolio, Hastings’ Emigrants’ Guide to California, and plates from John James Audubon.\n\nDE HISTORIA STIRPIVM BY LEONHART FUCHS...\n\nRed Butte Press\n\nSalt Lake City : Red Butte Press, 1982\n\nZ232.5 R5 D4\n\nThere may be no way of determining how many other special items have come to the Library as a result of the positive public relations that the Friends have provided through their programs and activities. There is also no way to measure how effectively they may have addressed the process of learning and understanding, not only about the Library, but also about other subjects that have been offered through lectures, tours, exhibitions, and dinner meetings. For more than fifty years, the Friends of the Marriott Library have served both the University of Utah and the Intermountain community, while maintaining wholeheartedly committed to the use of the special resources of the Marriott Library’s Special Collections holdings.\n\nMILITARY DRESS BALL\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: Friends of the Marriott Library, 1973\n\nF591 F74 no.2\n\nKeepsake no. 2.

Gates and his wife, Catherine Budge Gates, donated their library of rare books, which included a complete collection of Allen Press books and ephemera to Special Collections. The Allen Press was one of the most famous of all twentieth-century fine presses. The donation of the Allen Press books was celebrated at a public event and exhibition the following year. Attending as honored guests, both the Gates and Allen families were taken with the appreciation of the University of Utah community and especially the staff at the Marriott Library.\n\nIn 1981, the Allens decided to donate their 1846 Columbian handpress with the understanding that the library would establish their own working press and also use it for instruction. The Allens donated one-half the monetary value of the Columbian press, while the Gates family and the Friends of the Library provided the other half of the cost – along with sufficient funds to undertake the publication of some ephemera, and the first book under the imprint of the “Red Butte Press.”\n\nPrinting began under the supervision of Everett Cooley, however, the printing itself was done by Jean Tarascio, a staff member of the Library Preservation and Conservation Department. Although, Ms. Tarascio had her own rotary proof-press and had done some small projects, she was not familiar with the larger Columbian Press. She was sent by the Library to the University of Nevada, Reno, to obtain training under Kenneth Carpenter who offered hand-press classes. Upon Ms. Tarascio’s return from Reno, she began printing small items from the Library. She also began teaching classes in hand-press printing through the Division of Continuing Education. Gaining confidence and sufficient funds, Ms. Tarascio, in 1984, completed the first book of Red Butte Press – A Journey to Great Salt Lake City. An edition of fifty copies was printed and immediately sold out.\n\nSince 1984, the Red Butte Press now touts a total of eighteen titles, with its latest, Oracle Bones, currently in process. The Press commissions original artwork, uses quality paper and binding materials, and prints letterpress to make each book a reflection of its contents. The Press prioritizes in-house production, opportunities for student participation, innovative graphic and structural design, and meaningful collaboration with local and regional artists, authors, and academics.\n\nAN EXCERPT FROM A JOURNEY\n\nJules Remy\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: Red Butte Press, 1984\n\nZ232.5 R5 R45 1984\n\nThis first book of the Red Butte Press was handset in Bembo and Goudy Open types and printed in an edition of fifty copies on an 1846 Columbian hand press and a Challenge cylinder press.

Edition of one hundred and twenty-five copies.\n\nSAMARKAND AND OTHER MARKETS I HAVE KNOWN\n\nWole Soyinka\n\nLas Vegas, NV: Rainmaker Editions, 2003 - Printed at the Red Butte Press\n\nPR9387.9 S6 S34 2003\n\nSamarkand and Other Markets I Have Known, a monumental poem by Nigerian Nobel Laureate, poet, and playwright, Wole Soyinka, draws on history, myth, and contemporary culture to explore the poignancy of human exchange as posed through the world’s great marketplaces. It is, in turn, lyrical and ironic – a piece that lays bare difficult religious, political, and social issues while nonetheless celebrating the potential of the human spirit. Illustrated by printmaker Robert Kleinschmidt, the book’s images seize upon the richness of the poetry to intensify the dimension of Soyinka’s words. Samarkand was produced under the direction of the Red Butte Press and published by the International Institute of Modern Letters's Rainmaker Editions. Printing was completed by John Balkwill in January 2003 with assistance from Marnie Powers-Torrey and Antonia Nelson. Text was printed from photopolymer plates on a Vandercook 15-21 press. Samarkand contains four original color woodcuts by Robert Kleinschmidt, also letterpress printed. Daniel Kelm produced the bindings. Boxes and slipcases were made by Campbell-Logan Bindery. Concept, design, typesetting, and project coordination by Victoria Hindley. Signed by both the author and artist, Samarkand has been issued in an edition of twenty-six lettered copies, three hundred ninety-nine numbered copies, with fifteen hors de commerce.\n\nSOMETHING LIVED, SOMETHING DREAMED...\n\nWilliam McDonough\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: Red Butte Press, 2004\n\nHT167.5 W47 M33 2004\n\nFormer dean of the school of architecture at the University of Virginia, William McDonough is recognized internationally for his writing and pioneering work in architecture and community planning. He is the only individual to have received the Presidential Award for Sustainable Development, and in 1999, Time Magazine recognized him as a “Hero of the Planet,” stating that “his utopianism is grounded in a unified philosophy that—in demonstrable and practical ways—is changing the design of the world.” With Something Lived, Something Dreamed, Red Butte Press turns its attention to the complex relationship between natural and urban landscapes. As a contribution to the dialogue surrounding this increasingly vital topic, the Press commissioned William McDonough to apply—for the first time—his comprehensive design philosophy to the American West. The result is a spirited manifesto in which McDonough reimagines the city through an optimistic, visionary lens, reminding us how deeply our built environments are embedded in the natural world. At once historical and cutting-edge, practical and poetic, Something Lived, Something Dreamed is a lyrical invitation to reconsider the rich relationship between nature and city in the twenty-first century.\n\n“It is urgent that we begin to love our cities,” writes McDonough in the preface to Something Lived, Something Dreamed. “Cities are our future… In American mythology, the great beyond represented infinite resources; going away was the path to freedom. Now, the great beyond is here. And here, as we reimagine the urban landscape, we hold in our collective hands the chance to create vibrant, restorative, enduring cities—the critical habitat of humanity and the home of our hopes and dreams.”\n\nDesigned as a model of sustainable thinking, Something Lived, Something Dreamed was composed and cast in hot metal by Christopher Stern. The type is Monotype Univers. The book was printed on handmade cotton paper from Cartiera Magnani paper mill by Marnie Powers-Torrey and Jennifer Sorensen on an 1846 Columbian hand press. Craig Jensen bound the books using post-consumer recycled aluminum and reclaimed wood. Victoria Hindley developed the project and designed the book, which consists of thirty-two pages and is 10 by 7.5 inches. The edition is limited to one hundred and twenty-five copies. Each book is signed by the author and artist and housed in a clamshell box.\n\nTHE FIREBIRD'S NEST\n\nSalman Rushdie\n\nLas Vegas, NV: Rainmaker Editions, 2004; Printed at the Red Butte Press\n\nPR9499.3 R8 F57 2004\n\nThe Firebird's Nest by Salman Rushdie was published by Rainmaker Editions and printed at the Red Butte Press in the J. Willard Marriott Library, University of Utah, by Marnie Powers-Torrey and Jennifer Sorensen. Text was printed from photopolymer plates on a Vandercook 15-21. The paper is Somerset Velvet. The text typeface is Poliphilus and the display typeface is Acolyte. Bindings and boxes were handmade by Craig Jensen at BookLab II in Texas. The four original linocuts and dingbat, also letterpress printed, are by Alfredo Benavidez Bedoya of Argentina. Concept, design, typesetting, and direction provided by Victoria Hindley, Creative Director, Red Butte Press. The Firebird's Nest was issued in an edition of twenty-six lettered copies and ninety-nine numbered copies, with fifteen hors de commerce.\n\nTO A YOUNG WRITER\n\nWallace Stegner\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: Red Butte Press, 2009\n\nZ232.5 R5 S73 2009\n\nThis limited-edition spotlighting Wallace Stegner's essay “To a Young Writer” contains new writing by Wendell Berry and Lynn Stegner as well as three original engravings by renowned artist Barry Moser. Marnie Powers-Torrey and staff printed the book on Red Butte Press's 1846 Columbian handpress. The cotton paper was handmade by Twinrocker mill in Indiana. The typeface is Fournier with casting and composition by Michael Bixler at the Press and Letterfoundry of Michael & Winifred Bixler in New York. Peggy Gotthold and Lawrence Van Velzer bound the books and made the boxes at Foolscap Press in California. Victoria Hindley developed the project and designed the book, typography and binding. This 28-page book is 13 by 9 inches; bound in wood, cloth and calfskin, it is housed in a clamshell box. The edition is limited to one hundred and twenty-five copies for sale, fifteen hors de commerce.\n\nWO/MEN AT WORK\n\nMatthew Basso\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: Red Butte Press, 2012\n\nN7433.3 W65 2012\n\nWo/Men at Work contains an introductory essay by Matthew Basso and Andrew Farnsworth; Ralph Powell’s story about the rodeo, “Everything’s Dangerous,” from the Federal Writer’s Project collection Men at Work; and a contemporary response by Judy Blunt entitled “Cooking from Scratch,” in which the author, who grew up on a Montana ranch, explores the notion of “women’s work.” This unique, 32-page, W-fold pamphlet is printed on Rives Heavyweight and BFK papers. The production of Wo/Men at Work furthers its investigation of American labor through physical practice and through the integration of cutting-edge and antiquated technologies. Photosensitive polymer plates created from digital files are employed alongside letterpress printing & hand bookbinding – processes contemporaneous with those used during the Men at Work era. The body typeface is a version of Fairfield, released in 1939 and designed for the Linotype machine. Additional typefaces, also evocative of 1930s and ’40s printshop vernacular are Hamilton, a revival of a popular nineteenth-century wood type; Franklin Gothic, a workhorse sans serif found in printshops across America; and Cheltenham Italic, a ubiquitous early twentieth-century serif design. Wo/Men at Work is a cross-departmental, interdisciplinary project, on which numerous hard-at-work men and women collaborated. Matthew Basso, faculty member in history and gender studies and Director of the American West Center, initiated the project. Book Arts Program Managing Director Marnie Powers-Torrey managed production. Creative Director David Wolske typeset and designed the text. Claire Taylor and Laura Decker produced multi-panel cover illustrations in dialogue with the essays and one another. Emily Tipps devised the structure, and oversaw binding. Candidates in the University of Utah’s graduate creative writing and book arts programs were instrumental in production. MFA candidate Becky Thomas was an invaluable reader and editor. Under the advisement of Book Arts Program staff, PhD candidate and American West Center fellow Andrew Farnsworth, MFA candidate Chris Dunsmore, and Dayna Kerns printed and bound the edition.\n\nPROBLEMS OF DESCRIPTION IN THE LANGUAGE OF DISCOVERY\n\nKatharine Coles\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: Red Butte Press, 2012;\n\nPS3553 O47455 P76 2012\n\nKatharine Coles—Guggenheim Fellow, University of Utah literature and creative writing professor, and former Utah Poet Laureate—wrote Problems of Description during a research trip to Antarctica, where, funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, she worked and lived alongside scientists and engineers. Among these were a group of researchers from the University of Utah, including mathematician Ken Golden. Golden’s rule of fives examines intersections between the temperature, salinity, and permeability of sea ice, and has been used to discern key data relevant to climate change. Coles’s text engages with the rule of fives, and explores the language and apparent magic inherent to scientific discovery. A gloss, extracted from the researchers’ handwritten Antarctic field notebooks, interlaces the primary text of the poem. The gloss’s composition mirrors the process of percolation and embodies the concept of dialogue between disciplines and their respective dictions. The book’s wire binding and sturdy Mylar cover allude to field researchers’ weatherproof notebooks. Fully extended, the vertically oriented accordion resembles an ice core, and translucent flyouts and overlays reveal content as through layers of ice. Problems of Description was produced in its entirety by Book Arts Program staff and University of Utah colleagues: Creative Director David Wolske designed the book in tandem with artwork by Mary Toscano, who drew from the same scientific field notes as the poet. Claire Taylor acted as lead printer, assisted by John Thorp, Chris Dunsmore, and Becky Williams Thomas, mfa candidates in creative writing and book arts, along with studio assistant Emiline Twitchell. Text—set in Univers 47 and Chaparral—and art were printed from polymer plates on Zerkall Frankfurt, Minogami, and Arturo. The cover was laminated using Don Glaister’s sanded Mylar® technique. Emily Tipps oversaw binding of the edition, completed by assistant printers and Book Arts Program staff, with help from students in the fall 2012 bookbinding course. Marnie Powers-Torrey directed production and lent a hand or eye as needed.\n\nCHAP XXIV\n\nCraig Dworkin\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: Red Butte Press, 2013\n\nN7433.4 D95 C43 2010z\n\nA jump in pagination confirms Chapter XXIV is missing. Coinciding with the 300th anniversary of Laurence Sterne’s birth, here is the absent chapter—a single signature designed to fit neatly into the first edition ( R &J Dodsley, 1761). Craig Dworkin’s interpolated text uses all historically consistent English words in which the letters f and s can be interchanged and result in a legitimate word. Each sentence is based on grammatical constructions found elsewhere in Sterne’s novel. The type, ITC Founders Caslon, includes seven pre-existing ligatures and seven bespoke long-s ligatures created by the book designer. The project was letterpress printed from photopolymer plates on handmade paper including a custom Red Butte Press watermark. A typographically illustrated cover utilizes the placement of each dash that appears in the text and externalizes the 18th century typesetters’ practice of using any available foundry dashes. The varying dash length and humorous interplay of the letters f and s call attention to potentialities of punctuation, spelling, and meaning. CHAP XXIV was produced in 2013 in an edition of three hundred and twenty-five numbered copies; twenty-six lettered copies hors de commerce; and fourteen deluxe copies individually letterpress-printed with one of the ligatures that appear in the text.\n\nSTRANGER & STRANGER\n\nKatharine Coles\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: Red Butte Press, 2016\n\nPS3553 O47455 S77 2016\n\nStranger & Stranger is a result of the collaboration and friendship between poet Katharine Coles and painter Maureen O'Hara Ure, both University of Utah professors. Working alongside one another, the two have maintained an artistic dialogue for twenty-five years, sharing and responding to works in progress and periodically exhibiting together. In Stranger & Stranger visual and textual beasts intermingle and romp on the page, inhabiting illustrated and reader-envisioned water, air, and landscapes. Imagery for the bestiary was extracted from Maureen's paintings, translated for letterpress printing into photopolymer plates, and arranged in dynamic interaction with Katharine's poems. These selections from an imaginary bestiary were drawn from North and South American, Asian, European, and particularly Byzantine art; from the rarely accurate bestiaries created by early explorers of the New World; from encounters with animals both homely and nonhomely; and from the co-creators' own strange minds. The title – which begins on the back cover, crosses the spine, and continues on the front cover – is partially obscured by an outer flap (like a creature sheltering under a leaf). The flap frames two animals, snouts aimed at the fore-edge as if to suggest the opening. Inside the book, the rubrication of the poem titles alludes to a tradition of medieval manuscripts, including bestiaries, a popular convention of the time. Yet while acknowledging historical convention, this bestiary also breaks from it. Rather than presenting a one-to-one correlation between illustrations and text typical of a catalog of beasts, in Stranger & Stranger image and text interact organically to form a web of connectivity throughout the book. The poems do not explain the fauna so much as revel in bewilderment. The type is digitally set in open-source Alegria Sans and Alegria Roman, and printed from photopolymer plates on a Vandercook Universal 1 proof press. Text pages and outer cover are Arturo Cover; inner cover is Mohawk Loop Antique Vellum. The binding is a three-section long-stitch with an integrated accordion, ideal for display. As the book's content development was a joint endeavor, so was its production. BAP faculty, staff, and students involved in the project were Marnie Powers-Torrey, production manager; David Wolske, designer; Crane Giamo, lead printer; Emily Tipps, binding coordinator; and production assistants Hailey Bradley, Annie Hillam, Sara Jensen, Dana Knight, Allison Milham, Jonathan Sandberg, Brett Stanfield, and Amy Thompson.\n\n(IN)VISIBLE SHORES\n\nDanielle Beazer Dubrasky\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: Red Butte Press, 2017\n\nPS3604 U2658 I6 2017\n\nDanielle Dubrasky’s (In)visible Shores was produced at the Red Butte Press and released at the premier of Valley of Enchantment by Mark Dal Porto, performed by The Orchestra of Southern Utah on February 23, 2017. Photography, design, letterpress & digital printing, and binding completed collaboratively by Crane Giamo, Allison Milham, Hailey Rabdau, Marnie Powers-Torrey, Amy Thompson, and Emily Tipps. “Great Basin” was previously published in Fire in the Pasture, edited by Tyler Chadwick, Pecular Pages, 2011. The deluxe edition of (In)visible Shores includes a slip-case and a CD with a recording of the Orchestra of Southern Utah performing Valley of Enchantment, composed by Mark Dal Porto, reflecting imagery from Danielle Dubrasky’s poems.\n\nDE | MARCATION\n\nAmy Jorgensen\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: Red Butte Press, 2018\n\nTR24 U8 D46 2018\n\nDE|MARCATION was originally conceived by Amy Jorgensen to support the unique vision of artists in the state of Utah and to build on the rich discourse of image making in the region. Curated by Amy Jorgensen and Edward Bateman with included critical essays, the portfolio box, letterpress printed title, index and essay pages have been created in collaboration with Red Butte Press at the University of Utah's Book Arts Program. Red Butte Press faculty and staff produced the box and non-photographic content. The text is set in Akzidenz-Grotesk and printed from photopolymer plates on Crane's Lettra paper with a Vandercook SP20 letterpress. Designed collaboratively by the curators and publishers, the clamshell box is covered in Asahi bookcloth with Fabriano Tiziano pastedowns. The measurement of the interruption in the box wall is derived from the ratio between the borders of the state and those of Utah's notch. Early photographic surveys of the American West explored the physical territory; this portfolio examines the conceptual landscape of creative practice by photographic artists spanning the vast spaces of Utah. The artists have strong connections to the state and their images represent a diversity beyond geographic boundaries; they interrupt convention and draw new lines. Intended to serve as a document of a historical moment, this portfolio was created as an act of generosity, especially through its inclusion of a younger generation of artists who represent not only the current state of photographic art, but also its future. Included Artists: Kimberly Anderson, Christine Baczek, David Baddley, Edward Bateman, David Brothers, Van Chu, Samuel Davis, Daniel George, Haynes Goodsell, Mark Hedengren, Amy Jorgensen, Natalie Kirk, Karalee Kuchar, Carsten Meier, Bernard C. Meyers, Andrew Patteson, Kim Raff, Nancy E. Rivera, Fazilat Soukhakian, Josh Winegar.\n\nRARE BOOKS\n\nThe rare books collections core was initially made up of books from the Utah Territorial Library, the University of Deseret Library, and the John R. Park private book collection. Over the years, other individual library collections were acquired by the library.\n\nAs the collection consisted mainly of books on Utah and the Mormons, these collections were put together and set aside in a special room called the Utah Room. Other gifts and donations came in gradually, and by 1965, the rare collection numbered almost 30,000 bound volumes. Thanks to university funding and generous gifts, the rare books collection has continued to grow over the last five decades.\n\nWhile the criteria which determine what makes a book rare can vary, some of the most important qualities include age, scarcity, print history and provenance, in addition to historic, cultural, and aesthetic value. Today, the collection has a holdings of more than 80,000 items, comprised of books, maps, ephemera, and realia documenting the record of human communication – from four-thousand-year-old Sumerian clay tablets to twenty-first century artists' book.\n\nThe strengths of the rare books collection include the history of science, religion, and printing, materials that highlight overland exploration and the American West, limited editions of fine press and artists’ books, manuscript facsimiles from Medieval Europe and Mesoamerica, as well as one of the nation’s largest Middle East collections.\n\nWithout a doubt, the rare books at the J. Willard Marriott Library are special, and while a certain set of criteria might make a book rare, the true value of a book should not be determined by a price tag. Books are important to our understanding of history, and to ensure that our history reflects all kinds of voices, the Rare Books Department continues to collect books and continue to tell their stories. Most importantly, we will continue to argue that there is nothing like holding the real thing in your hands.\n\nETHIOPIAN CODEX\n\n11th – 19th century\n\nPJ2197 H36\n\nThis manuscript is written in Ethiopic (Ge’ez), a Semitic language that is no longer spoken, but is still used for liturgical and other religious purposes by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Part of a larger collection of such manuscripts at the Marriott Library, these books have wooden covers, a distinctive sewing pattern, and pages made of animal skin. This “Coptic” binding style has endured for over fifteen hundred years. So durable and practicable is it that today’s professional book conservators often choose this style of binding to preserve our most rare and valuable materials. The Rare Books Collection holds ten volumes of Ethiopian scriptures in total. The manuscripts were donated to the Aziz S. Atiya Middle East Collection in 1973 by C. Russell Scoville.\n\nLES BELLES HEURES DU DUC DE BERRY\n\nLucerne, Switzerland: Faksimile Verlag Luzern, 2003\n\nND3363 B5 2003 Facsimile\n\nThe library of the Duke of Burgundy was legendary. It held nearly three hundred manuscripts, almost all of them luxury productions. A library of this size in this era was almost unheard of. By contrast, the library at Cambridge owned not quite two hundred volumes at this same time. Belle Heures was the Duke’s personal book of hours. It was illustrated by the famous Limbourg brothers – Pol, Jean, and Herman. The Limbourg brothers were born in the last quarter of the fourteenth century, the sons of a woodcarver. In Paris, they first apprenticed to a goldsmith. Around 1400, they entered the employ of the Duke of Burgundy, whose brother, the Duke of Berry, had instilled in him a passion for fine books. When the Duke of Burgundy died in 1404, the brothers went to work for the Duke of Berry. Belles Heures, one of several books of hours owned by Jean de France, Duc de Berry, is illuminated with nearly two hundred colorful, lively miniatures, highlighted with gold leaf, shell gold, and ornamented initials in red, blue and gold. Facsimile edition of nine hundred and eighty copies numbered with Arabic numerals, plus eighty copies hors de commerce numbered with roman numerals. Facsimile bound in Morocco leather with gold tooling a la seventeenth-century fashion. The University of Utah copy is no. 711.\n\nThe word “facsimile” comes from the Latin, meaning “to make the same” and often times it is so close to the original, it’s hard to tell the difference. Each book is approached individually in order to successfully duplicate the format, tone and color, unique to each work. The actual condition of the original book is respected. Water damage, tears, discoloration, uneven pages, etc., are re-created without changing, adding to, or enhancing the condition of the book in any way. No cost can be spared to achieve an exact replica. Bindings are handcrafted to faithfully duplicate things such as the original type of leather or fabric used, as well as any clasps, fasteners, gilding, and embossing. Because facsimile production is such a painstaking process, editions are necessarily expensive and limited. The Marriott Library is very lucky to own dozens of these beautiful books.\n\nIL MANOSCRITTO MESSICANO\n\nRome: Stab. Danesi, 1896\n\nF1219 V35 Facsimile\n\nThe original Nahua ritual manuscript resides in the Vatican Library, where it has been since the sixteenth century. The codex is a continuous strip, made up of ten attached sheets of deer skin, covered on both sides with stucco. It was arranged as a screen-fold with a wooden cover at either end. The original covers show traces of ornamental turquoise designs, but only a single piece of the gemstone remains. Although the page size is small, the whole document is one of the most extensive of Mesoamerican manuscripts. The painter arranged his material in such a way that by adjusting the length of each section, all pages are completely filled. This reference book defined various periods of the calendar with their meanings and variations, designating the sacred two hundred and sixty-day period (tonalpohualli) as the most important. Several sections discuss mythological and ceremonial meanings and display the gods in their many aspects. The manuscript belongs to the so-called Borgia Group. It is the only manuscript in this group preserved in its original form, complete with binding. The manuscripts in this group, although varying in style, are thought to have been produced by the Tlaxcalans, A Nahuatl-speaking group dwelling about 63 miles east and southeast of Mexico City. Culturally different from the Aztec, the two were enemies. The Tlaxcalans sided with the Spanish against the Aztec. The manuscript arrived at the Vatican Library sometime between 1565 and 1589.\n\nThe Mesoamerican Codex Collection was supported, in part, by University of Utah Anthropology professor Charles E. Dibble. Dibble is most recognized for one enormous body of work. Along with Dr. Arthur J.O. Anderson, he was responsible for the translation and publication of the Florentine Codex, first envisioned by the Franciscan priest, Fray Bernadino de Sahagun, from Aztec to English.\n\nSENTENTIARUM LIBRI IV\n\nPetrus Lombardus (ca. 1100-1160)\n\nNuremberg: A. Koberger, 1500\n\nBX1749 P4 1500\n\nPetrus Lombardus (Peter Lombard) was a Medieval French theologian. He taught at the Cathedral school of Notre Dame and towards the end of his life he became Bishop of Rome. Sententiarum Libri (The Book of Sentences) established his reputation and subsequent fame as a writer. It was written between 1148 and 1151, and is a collection of teachings of the Church Fathers, plus some opinions of medieval masters, arranged as a systematic treatise of scared doctrine. In it, Lombardus recognizes the role of reason in theology. Until the sixteenth century it was the official textbook of theology in many universities. Hundreds of scholars wrote commentaries on it, among them Thomas Aquinas, Albert Magnus, and Bonaventura. Despite its great influence, the work itself is unoriginal, but it was among the very first attempts ever made to present Christian theology in a systematized form. This particular edition was printed by Anton Koberger, one of the more significant of the early printers. Koberger published more than two hundred editions. Because Sententiarum Libri was used as a textbook, it has no decorative initials or other ornaments.\n\nThis folio is bound in contemporary calf over oak boards, with blind-stamped panels on the sides. The binding is decorated with a roll depicting a hunting scene. The lining papers consist of proof sheets from Boethius’s De Institutione Arithmetica, printed at Augsburg in 1488. These sheets consist of four pages of the book and include diagrams and tables. The proofs are printed on the back of proofs of another and unidentified book. A manuscript note on the title page suggests that it at once belonged to the monastic library of St. Elizabeth at Brescia.\n\nThis volume was the first incunable purchased by the University Library, in 1965.\n\nCOMMON SENSE\n\nThomas Paine (1737-1809)\n\nPhiladelphia, 1776 – Probably a sixth printing\n\nE211 P124\n\nThomas Paine called for the separation of the colonies from the mother country in his famous pamphlet, Common Sense. His writings, perhaps more than any other writer, paved the way for the American colonists’ final break with Great Britain. Common Sense, a persuasive argument for independence, was a runaway best seller immediately upon publication. First printed in Philadelphia by Robert Bell on January 9, 1776, in an edition of one thousand copies, it was read by everyone in the Continental Congress and George Washington, who commented on the effect it had on his troops, it was also read by nearly everyone in the colonies that was literate, and read aloud to nearly everyone who was not. Paine had planned to give his share of the profits to the cause of independence, but when Bell told him there were no profits, Paine dismissed Bell and hired Bradford to publish a new, enlarged edition. Bell published an unauthorized second printing on January 27, and Bradford’s enlarged edition was published on or around February 14. The pamphlet quickly sold 150,000 copies. Paine refused to copyright the work and gave permission to all to reprint it. The earliest printings outside of Philadelphia used the text of Bell’s first printing. Later printings used the text of Bradford’s February printing. Twenty-five editions were published in thirteen cities in the year 1776, reaching nearly half a million copies printed in that year alone. At that time, the colonial population was about three million, including slaves, women, and children. It was this pamphlet that moved mass public opinion toward the cause of the revolution.\n\nDuring the tenure of Everett Cooley, the University Library participated in a traveling exhibition which they called the \"Bicentennial Bookmobile.\" For seven months during 1976, titles related to the American Revolution, including Paine's Common Sense traveled throughout the state, hosted by members of the Utah Library Association and local librarians. Figures for those who viewed the exhibit were well in the excess of a hundred thousand.\n\nCOLLECTION OF PLANTS FOUND IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS…\n\nHenry Parkyns Hoppner (1795-1833)\n\nPublisher not identified, 1821\n\nQK474 H66\n\nAmong one of the shipmates on William Parry’s first voyage to the Arctic data was Henry Parkyns Hoppner. Hoppner accompanied Parry on all three expeditions, first as a lieutenant on the Griper and Hecla, and later promoted to second in command on the Fury in the last voyage. Although Hoppner never received the kind of international acclaim as his Captains, his creative and artistic role on board as illustrator and actor proved to leave an impression.\n\nThis book is “a collection of plants found in the Arctic Sections … made by Captain Hopner … 2nd in command of H.M.S. 'Fury' … The 'Fury' and 'Hecla' (Captain Lyon) sailed to discover the N.W. passage May 1821.” Attached to one of the end pages, there is also a miniature envelope that holds “moss which Franklin and his party had as their only food.” It is possible that this note alludes to the failed overland expeditions in the Arctic lead by Sir John Franklin between 1819-1822. In addition to the handwritten notes, a bookplate on the first page suggests that sometime during the mid-twentieth-century the book was held in the Department of Botany in Oxford while Nicholas Polunin was the Keeper of the Herbaria, which is now almost four hundred years old. While lecturing at Oxford, Polunin traveled to the Canadian Arctic as a botanist on an expedition that discovered the last major islands to be added to the world’s map.\n\nDESERET FIRST AND SECOND BOOKS\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: University of Deseret, 1868\n\nPE1152 S35\n\nMormon Church president and prophet Brigham Young commissioned the Board of Regents of the newly formed University of Deseret to reform the written English language. A phonetic writing system developed by Englishman Isaac Pitman had a strong influence on the Mormon project. In 1855, the Utah legislature voted an appropriation of $2,500 for the casting of a font of type. A local attempt to cast failed, so the original metal type was cast in St. Louis. The font was made up of thirty-eight characters. Brigham Young used the new alphabet in his own journals in 1859 and 1860. By 1860, the Deseret Alphabet appeared in newspaper articles, on handbills and shop signs, in journals and private correspondence, on a gold coin and tombstones. In 1868, using more appropriated state funds, two volumes of readers were printed for use in schools. The cost of printing the readers was the huge sum of $18, 500. The first reader was thirty-six pages long and the second, seventy-two. They were illustrated with engravings from Wilson’s Readers. Twenty thousand copies of each reader were printed. In 1869, the Book of Nephi and the Book of Mormon were published in the Deseret alphabet. In spite of all this, the alphabet proved to be quite unpopular. The use of the alphabet died with Brigham Young.\n\nTHE ORESTEIAN TRILOGY\n\nAeschylus\n\nGreenbrae, CA: Produced by hand, The Allen Press, 1982-1983\n\nZ232.5 A5 A33 1982\n\nTranslated by E.D.A.

ATIYA MIDDLE EAST LIBRARY\n\nWhen the name of Western Americana, Rare Books, and University Archives was changed to Special Collections in 1971, it reflected a shift in the holdings. In addition to the growing emphasis of rare books, Everett Cooley was also made responsible for the impressive Middle East Library – under the premise that it was a “specialized” collection. The Middle East Library had been established alongside the Middle East Studies program in 1959 with the arrival of Aziz Suryal Atiya.\n\nAtiya was a prominent scholar, writer, historian, and librarian whose expertise spanned the fields of the Crusades and Islamic and Coptic studies. In addition to his role as Professor of Languages and History, Atiya was tasked with building a center for the study of Arabic and Middle East cultures. Fortunately, Atiya had brought his already sizeable library collection to the University. He was also provided funds to purchase additional books and manuscripts. While making numerous visits to his homeland of Egypt, Atiya was extremely successful in acquiring large quantities of books at very low prices. These books were initially presided over by Marian Sheets.\n\nPALACE DEDICATION INSCRIPTION OF KING SIN-KASHID OF URUK\n\nOld Babylonian Period, circa 1900-1700 BCE\n\nWriting began somewhere during the third and second millennia BCE in Sumer between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in what is now Iraq. Among many things, the Sumerians recorded history; business and legal documents; mathematics; and zoological, mineralogical, and botanical studies. Most of what survives today of their writings consists of lists – things like inventories and tax collections. Mesopotamian writings also included myths, epic tales, hymns, lamentations, proverbs, and fables. One of the world’s first and greatest recorded epics, full of heroes, gods, love, and adventure – The Epic of Gilgamesh – was written down on clay tablets. Sumerians used the clay deposited onto the wide, flat riverbeds for writing material. They mixed the clay with straw and water. While it was soft, they formed it into shapes and then used a stylus, a pointed stick, to make marks, the earliest writing system, now called \"cuneiform.\" The clay was baked hard in the sun and, later, in kilns.\n\nThe text of this inscription is known from 174 duplicates. Some are written on small clay cones, others on clay or stone tablets. They were intended for foundation deposits, and were immured in the walls of the royal palace in great numbers. There are also many others expanded by a few lines of royal epithets.\n\nUruk was one of the most ancient cites of Sumer. The Amnanum were a tribe of West Semitic Amorite-speaking nomads who had come into southern Mesopotamia several centuries earlier.\n\nPAPER LEAVES FROM A QUR’AN\n\nEgypt, circa late 8th – early 9th centuries\n\nTwo leaves from a Qur’an written in a single column of twelve to thirteen lines in Kufic script, likely produced in Egypt. The word of Allah was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by Gabriel the messenger of God. The title “Qur’an” derives from a Syriac word for “scripture.” The Qur’an is considered an eternal object, not created in time by any one individual. Early manuscripts copies of the Qur’an, such as this, illustrate the development of a system of diacritical marks to improve vocalization. Black dots, placed above or below the letter, distinguish between consonants. The red dots mark short vowels.\n\nPILGRIM’S QUR’AN\n\ncirca 10th-11th centuries\n\nBP100.3 1000z\n\nProduced in the tenth or eleventh century in Naskhi script, with extensive marginalia throughout. Fatihah and the first page of al-Baqarah are ornamented. Housed in a leather pouch.\n\nFollowing the construction and move to the new Marriott Library in 1968, Atiya was provided offices, space for books, and a vault for the valuable rarities he had collected – including several unique Qur’ans and fragments. The fragments now form part of the Arabic Papyrus, Parchment and Paper collection, which is one of the largest of its kind in the United States, containing 770 Arabic papyrus documents, 1,300 Arabic paper documents, and several pieces on parchment. To make them usable to scholars, Mrs. Atiya spent untold hours carefully unfolding, flattening, and encasing the papyri in glass for protection. Today, they are digitized and available to researchers all over the world.\n\nARABIC PAPYRUS #475v\n\n9th century\n\nConditionally identified by one scholar as containing a poem by al-Jaahiz (781–869), one of the most important prose writers in the history of Arabic literature. To date, only two verses are known in a quotation in a later text. This near-contemporary papyrus has six partial lines.\n\nARABIC PARCHMENT #786r\n\n10th century\n\nSingle leaf of a Qur'an manuscript written in Kufic script. Vowels and variant readings are marked with red and green dots, respectively.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF UTAH LIBRARIES HEBRAICA-JUDAICA COLLECTION\n\nSalt Lake City, UT: University of Utah Libraries, 1972\n\nZ688 H3 U8 1972\n\nSince the Middle East collection was strong on Arabic materials, the local Jewish community established a fundraiser to garner $100,000 for the purchase of Hebraica-Judaica materials. This effort was spearheaded by Benjamin Roe, a local philanthropist-merchant, and University of Utah scholar and instructor, Louis Zucker. Although they were only able to raise $64,000, this money was turned over to the library for the acquisition of books on Jewish history, culture, and traditions. The local Jewish community also donated personal books, manuscripts, scrolls, and photographs documenting local activities. This keepsake, featuring items from the Hebraica-Judaica collection, was presented in recognition of the Jewish community and other friends of the library for their support of the growing collection. The keepsake features notable items from the collection as well as a descriptive narrative written by Dr. Brigham D. Madsen, Director of Libraries.\n\nHEBREW SCROLLS: MEGILLAH ESTHER\n\nTwo complete scrolls from the Megillah Esther, required for Jewish ritual observance during the Jewish festival of Purim. The larger scroll originates from Yemen ad consists of twenty-nine parchment sections with half-page end-pieces. One of the two rollers are missing, and one of the end pieces is missing from the remaining roller. Scrolls of this type would generally have been housed in a cloth or metal casing.\n\nThe smaller scroll written in very clear, beautiful Hebrew script and signed by Yaacov Buharun, perhaps from the Bukharah region. Although undated, and had to date with precision, the scrolls are probably from the late Medieval or Early Modern Centuries.\n\nBOOK ARTS PROGRAM\n\nAn extension of the Red Butte Press is the Marriott Library’s Book Arts Program. Since 1995, the Book Arts Program has encouraged appreciation for the art and history of the book – not only on campus, but among the wider Intermountain West community.\n\nThe Book Arts Program was established by Rare Books Curator, Madelyn Garrett, the same year that the Rocky Mountain Guild of Book Workers was created. Both were in response to a growing need for bookmaking opportunities in the intermountain West. The program was launched with an inaugural lecture by British design binder, Philip Smith in the autumn of 1995. Soon there were workshops, lectures, summer intensives, semester-long classes in book making and incredible guests from around the world including: Tim Ely, Daniel Kelm, Ken Campbell, Gene Valentine, Laura Wait, Dominic Riley, Carol Pallensen, Jean Formo, Sheila Waters, and many more.\n\nToday, the fully equipped studio allows students to learn skills such as papermaking, bookbinding, letterpress, typography, and book design. The program also offers a Minor and Certificate in Book Arts, as well as a BA and MFA in Book Arts – supported by both the Art and English Departments. Student work from each of the classes is displayed in our annual Booking a Brouhaha exhibition, featured in the Special Collections Exhibition gallery outside the Book Arts Studio.\n\nAdditionally, the Book Arts Studio provides community programming for adults and has ongoing K-12 outreach initiatives. Beginning in 2004, the Book Arts Treasure Chest has been taking book arts directly into Utah classrooms. Treasure Chest teachers present a History of the Book lesson, using rare books and facsimiles as examples that students view and handle, then guide them in making a book that relates to their current curriculum.\n\nThe program makes classroom visits and hosts workshops, celebrating the innovation, collaboration, and excitement for learning that come from expressing ideas through creative, hands-on experience. The program also provides educators’ workshops, with ideas for cross-disciplinary lessons and bookmaking techniques to integrate into K-12 curricula. Through these free, grant-supported workshops, the program strives to deliver a variety of bookmaking instruction suitable for teachers and students of all grade levels and abilities. Educators' Intensives are offered every summer, as well as half-day workshops for teachers throughout the year.\n\nPRESERVATION\n\nAmong the many volunteers that offered their time and expertise to Special Collections, one of the most notable was Emeritus Professor William “Kim” Newby. Formerly a professor of biology at the University of Utah, Newby was recruited by Everett Cooley to practice some of his woodworking skills with Special Collections. Newby became interested in a wooden chest handmade by Frederick Kesler, a millwright and Bishop of the LDS Church. Inside the chest were diaries, an autobiography, and other various memorabilia. Unfortunately, the chest was in dire need of repair. Newby used his woodworking skills to complete a masterful job of restoration. From that, he turned to some of the documents found in the chest – including a manuscript half-page from the fourteenth chapter of the First Book of Nephi of the Book of Mormon.\n\nFor several years, Cooley struggled to develop a conservation program at the University of Utah. During this time, several serious repairs and treatments were sent out-of-state to places like W.J. Barrow Restoration Shop in Virginia and Storm Bindery in Arizona. In 1977, the Library persuaded Paul Foulger from the LDS Church Historical Library to head the Preservation program following William Newby. Foulger received a laboratory with special facilities for deacidification, encapsulation, and careful handling. The Preservation and Restoration department began serious work on preserving not just the rare books and manuscripts, but also books and serials throughout the whole library. Foulger set up procedures and developed a staff that could accomplish large-scale preservation. While not administratively connected to Special Collections at the time, Preservation was physically located in the Special Collections department and practically all of the early treatments were done on the rare books, manuscripts, and maps in their holdings. Foulger and his staff were also incredibly involved in exhibition displays, the teaching program on archives and manuscripts, and the publications of the Red Butte Press.\n\nPreservation includes a range of preventive conservation measures used to safeguard historically, artistically and culturally significant collections. Preventive conservation includes setting priorities, allocating resources, and training staff to prevent damage and ensure optimal long-term care of the library's heritage collections. Conservation, which is remedial, is carried out by the conservators and technicians and involves expert, hands-on physical treatment and technical decision-making required to competently care for unique tangible artifacts. Today, the Marriott Library's Preservation Department occupies a bespoke conservation lab located on the library's fifth Floor. This purpose-built lab supports the hands-on treatment and technical decision-making associated with the conservation of rare and valuable objects housed in the library's general and special collections.\n\nMANUSCRIPTS\n\nFound among the earliest collections donated to the University Library were hand written documents, or manuscripts: diaries, journals, and correspondence, as well as business and organizational records, photographs, films, and other recordings. As more collections were acquired, the need for space and staff to oversee the materials became ever more apparent. The very nature of such items places them in a category different from other research materials. The most distinctive characteristic of a manuscript collection is that in most instances it is unique. Its loss or mutilation cannot be corrected by the purchase of another one. Once gone, it is lost to all prospective users.\n\nBy 1970, the Library had more than one hundred and fifty separate manuscript collections that needed to be processed. Unfortunately, neither staff nor finances were readily available to take on the work. While manuscript collections continued to accumulate, Everett Cooley was forced to reevaluate the collecting policies. Cooley decided to concentrate on manuscripts from Utahns, about Utahns, or by Utahns who had made their mark – those living outside of Utah but who still identified with the region or University. Examples of such papers collected are those of Fawn Brodie, Wallace Stegner, Sonia Johnson, and J. Willard Marriott.\n\nThe following year, the Manuscripts Department of Special Collections was officially established with the purpose of housing, processing, and making accessible all those unpublished historical resources that are classified as manuscripts. Although the department was finally funded and staffed, the backlog of unprocessed materials kept growing. In a letter to the Director of Libraries, Roger Hanson, dated November 1976, Cooley wrote, “Record collecting is something like a snowball rolling downhill – it grows as it accelerates. The word seems to spread that the place to deposit one’s records is at an institution or repository that has a good collection and draws users.\"\n\nThis trend continued for more than a decade, reaching a critical juncture by the late 1980s, when newly accessioned collections skyrocketed. The holdings had doubled to over 7,000 linear feet from 1985-1990 and were on track to double again within the next decade. Today, the Manuscripts Department houses more than 1,600 unpublished historical collections – each accompanied by detailed finding aids. While political papers form the largest single group of collections within the holdings of the Manuscripts Department, other collecting strengths include LDS church history, outdoor recreation, mining records, architectural designs, ethnic collections, and the arts. Collection highlights include the Utah Pride Center, Downwinders of Utah, the papers of Civil Rights activist Alberta Henry, as well as the archives of former NASA Administrator and University President, James C. Fletcher.\n\nPURSE MADE FROM THE SHOELACES OF ELIZABETH BRICE HILL GARDNER MAUGHN\n\nAndrew Wood Cooley papers, 1837-2021\n\nMS 0567 Bx 14\n\nThe Andrew Wood Cooley family papers consist of biographical and genealogical materials relating to Andrew Wood Cooley and his family. Andrew Cooley was a prominent member of the LDS Church during the nineteenth century. Included are Cooley Family Association of America material, family correspondence, material from the related Eldredge and Huntington families, mission correspondence to and from Henry W. Cooley, and the nineteenth century diaries of James Eldredge and Robert Hazen. The collection also holds an oral history interview with Marcus Cooley.\n\nTYPESCRIPT OF JOHN BENNION'S JOURNAL\n\nBennion Family papers, 1844-1949\n\nMS 0251 Bx 1\n\nThe Bennion family papers include the diaries of John Bennion, Heber Bennion, and Mary Bennion Powell, as well as family correspondence and autobiographical sketches. John and Samuel Bennion – as well as John's son, Heber – were Utah sheep ranchers and polygamists, while Mary Bennion Powell was a daughter of Heber Bennion.\n\nPENCIL DRAWING FOR A PUPPET THEATRE, BY FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT\n\nTaylor A. Woolley papers, 1910-1946\n\nMS 0452 Fd 17\n\nThe Taylor A. Woolley papers consist of correspondence and architectural drawings from Woolley's career as an architect. Woolley worked in the studio of Frank Lloyd Wright before establishing a partnership with Miles Miller and Clifford Evans. He was also a member of the presidency of the Salt Lake Chapter of the American Institute of Architects and was appointed State Architect under the administration of Governor Henry H. Blood.\n\nNASA APOLLO SPACECRAFT MODEL\n\nJames Chipman Fletcher papers, 1933-1992\n\nMS 0202 Bx 241\n\nThe James C. Fletcher papers cover Fletcher's time as NASA Administrator from 1971-1977, aspects of this professional life following his departure from NASA in the Carter Administration, and his return to NASA following the Challenger disaster in 1986. He also served as President of the University of Utah. Dr. Fletcher's papers from his tenure as president of the University of Utah are housed in the University Archives.\n\nBROCHURE FROM THE ALBERTA HENRY EDUCATION FOUNDATION\n\nAlberta Henry papers, 1946-2005\n\nACCN 2069 Bx 2\n\nThe Alberta Henry papers consist of files maintained by Alberta Henry, which detail her work as President of the Salt Lake City branch of the NAACP and as a minority consultant for the Salt Lake County School District. Also included are the records of various community organizations, of which Henry was a member, as well as the records of the Rainbow Honor Society, a multicultural student organization that she founded.\n\nCONNOR CHAPOOSE, NORTHERN UTE, ORAL HISTORY\n\nDoris Duke Oral History Collection, 1966-1972\n\nMS 0417 Bx 1\n\nThe Doris Duke oral history collection consists of transcripts of interviews. In 1966, Doris Duke funded a program to interview Native Americans in several states in order to document American history from the Native American point of view. The program was directed in Utah by C. Gregory Crampton for the Western History Center (now the American West Center) at the University of Utah. The interviews represent tribes in Utah and in neighboring states, and include both urban and reservation dwellers. Also included are interviews with non-Native individuals who were closely associated with various Native American individuals or groups. Interviewed and recorded by Younger T. Witherspoon. Please note, the Doris Duke oral history collection is currently closed while it is under tribal review.\n\nCHRONOLOGY OF THE UTAH STONEWALL CENTER\n\nThe Utah Pride Center records, 1976-2001\n\nACCN 1918 Bx 1\n\nThe Utah Pride Center records include material from the same body under two previous names: The Stonewall Center and The Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Utah. The records contain correspondence, meeting minutes, pamphlets, brochures, newsletters, manuals, contracts, publications, financial documents, office files, administrative files, subject files, posters, and memorabilia. The Utah Stonewall Center opened its doors in June 1991. The mission of the center is to provide a safe and supportive meeting place for gays and lesbians along the Wasatch Front.\n\nMARY DICKSON ORAL HISTORY\n\nDownwinders Oral History Project, 2016-2017\n\nACCN 3089 Bx 1\n\nThe Downwinders Oral History Project is an ongoing oral history project designed to document the voices of Utah's Downwinder population. Mary Dickson is a Downwinder who has worked as an activist on behalf of victims of nuclear fallout. She has written a play about Downwinders and has advocated for Downwinders on Capitol Hill. Dickson has also been on panels and spoken at conferences around the world. She talks about the effects nuclear fallout has had on her health and the health of her family and friends. Interviewed by Anthony Sams and Justin Sorensen.\n\nMULTIMEDIA\n\nDonations of manuscript materials to the Library’s Special Collections Division would often consist of other personal memorabilia such as photographs, moving images, audio recordings, and other forms of multimedia. As with manuscripts, these original, unique, and unpublished collections offered the opportunity to hear the voices of the past and see historic scenes and artistic visions brought to life. Processing the collection, however, proved to have its own challenges. The archives needed additional equipment and technology, as well as an appropriately trained staff.\n\nBy the end of the twentieth century, the rapid growth of technology could be seen throughout the entire library, and Special Collections was no different. It became evident that the multimedia collections held in Manuscripts required extra attention and expertise. Nancy Young, the Manuscripts Librarian, advocated the separation of the two areas, suggesting that each be managed by its own archivist. In January 1994, the Aural and Graphic Department was finally established as a sub-section, supervised by Roy Webb, who tirelessly fought for the needs of the materials, and the patrons who would use them.\n\nFurther restructuring of the collections took place upon Mrs. Young’s retirement in 1997. A survey was sent out to employees to understand how they envisioned Special Collections growing and evolving in the coming century. The staff responded with recommendations for Greg Thompson, who had replaced Everett Cooley as Director of Special Collections in 1983. Almost unanimously, the archivists and curators expressed their approval of creating a new Multimedia Department. Other comments saw strengthening in the areas of donor relations, collection development and financial development; making collection materials the responsibility of area curators; and centralizing the overall patron and reference experience.\n\nToday, the Multimedia Department consists of over 600,000 images of all types, more than five hundred films of all formats and size, and thousands of audio and videotapes, across some eight hundred separate collections. In addition to the numbered collections, the holdings also contain the photographs and audio-visual archives of the university. But some of the most notable collections include materials related to outdoor recreation (Wasatch Mountain Club); Women’s history and the Equal Rights Amendment (Sonia Johnson); ethnic communities (Japanese American Citizens League); as well as local and regional interviews (Doris Duke American Indian Oral Histories).\n\nSTILLS FROM DR. ODA’S FILM REELS\n\nJapanese American Citizen League audio-visual collection, 1926-1975\n\nA0286\n\nThe Japanese American Citizens League audio-visual collection consists largely of black and white, silent 16mm films taken by Ogden resident Dr. Sanji Oda, who recorded parades, sporting events and other activities throughout Northern Utah as well as material specific to the Japanese American community and Oda's own family from the late 1920s through the 1930s.\n\nBRIGHTON, BCC LAKES 1920S, MEETING HELD ABOVE 10,000 FT\n\nWasatch Mountain Club Photograph Collection, 1929-1960\n\nP0004\n\nThe Wasatch Mountain Club photograph collection consists of four photo albums containing prints from the early years of the organization and includes photos of group members involved in both winter and summer activities in the Wasatch Mountains. Included are loose photographs on similar subjects. The Club was organized in 1920 to provide an education and activity group for those who enjoyed hiking, ski touring, river running and mountain climbing.\n\nBELL & HOWELL 16MM CAMERA\n\nOrland L. Brig Tapp film collection, 1942-1962\n\nA0938\n\nThe Orland Lavell \"Brig\" Tapp independent film collection consists of 16mm color films by Utah Cine Arts Club member O. L. Tapp. He was a Salt Lake City heating engineer whose passion for cinematography and deft manipulation of color, shadow and light led him to become the zone chairman of the Motion Picture Division of the Photographic Society of America. Tapp's award winning films focus on outdoor pastimes and feature locations in Southern Utah, the Wasatch Mountains, and Murray, Utah circa 1950s.\n\nCONNOR CHAPOOSE INTERVIEWS\n\nDoris Duke American Indian Oral History Project, audio recordings, 1949-1972\n\nA0001\n\nThe Doris Duke American Indian oral history project audio recordings consist of interviews pertaining to the lives of Native Americans and their legends, customs, social and cultural beliefs, personal life experiences, and views on the urbanization of the Native American. This collection contains reel-to-reel audiotapes that are damaged in one or more of the following ways: shedding tape, wrinkled, warping, or brittle edges. Because of the poor condition of the audio recordings, some interviews are available only in transcript form. Please note, the Doris Duke oral history collection is currently closed while it is under tribal review.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS TAPES, LOGS\n\nKUTV News Collection, 1977-1979\n\nA0303\n\nThe KUTV station first signed onto the air on September 10, 1954 as an ABC affiliate in Salt Lake City, Utah. The original co-owners of the station were Frank C. Carman & Associates and the Salt Lake Tribune. In 1994, NBC bought the majority control of KUTV from VS&A Communications Partners. Just under a year later, on September 10, 1995, KUTV switched its affiliation to CBS. From 1977, the nightly news reports were recorded onto U-matic videocassettes, now part of the KUTV News collection.\n\nFOUNDING MEMBERS OF THE ERA\n\nSonia Johnson photograph collection, 1979-1981\n\nP0099\n\nThe Sonia Johnson collection contains photographs and slides of various Equal Rights Amendment demonstrations in Salt Lake City and elsewhere. Highlighted are those demonstrations related to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Photographs taken of a television broadcast relating to the excommunication trial of Sonia Johnson from the L.D.S. Church and images of friends and associates of Johnson are also included in the collection.\n\nPRINT & JOURNAL\n\nIn 1967, the Utah Room was renamed Western Americana, Rare Books, and University Archives. This name change reflected the broadening scope of the collection that had begun with the support of L. H. Kirkpatrick and the acquisition of collections such as Judge Tillman D. Johnson’s personal library and William A. Dawson’s Congressional Papers.\n\nWestern Americana contained sources on the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the state of Utah, and the Intermountain West. While the collection initially started with books it expanded to include a range of secondary sources, including maps, newspapers, serials, and clipping files.\n\nGiven the ever-expanding type of material and the depth of the subject matter, the department was renamed Print & Journal in 2016 to reflect its contents more accurately. The Print & Journal Department provides access to sources on the history of the West ranging from books to news clippings; University history is represented in holdings such as a complete run of the Utonia"
