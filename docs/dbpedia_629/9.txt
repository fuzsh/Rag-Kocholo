The William H. McGuffey House is an historic house museum at 401 East Spring Street, on the campus of Miami University in Oxford. Built in 1833, it was the home of author and professor William Holmes McGuffey (1800-1873) from then until 1836. It is believed to be the site where he wrote the first four of the McGuffey Readers, widely popular instructional texts used to educate generations of Americans. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, and was designated a National Historic Landmark one year prior. It is now operated by Miami University as the William Holmes McGuffey Museum.
