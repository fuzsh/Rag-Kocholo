        "text": "Deryck Whibley and Avril Lavigne once prided themselves on remaining amicable after their 2010 divorce. Looks like things have changed!\n\nSum 41 rocker Whibley, 32, and his girlfriend, Ari Cooper, celebrated Halloween weekend by dressing up as Lavigne, 28, and her new fiance, Chad Kroeger, 37. (Whibley proposed to Lavigne in 2005, and they tied the knot the following year. The spouses split in 2009, but their divorce was not finalized until 2010. Kroeger, meanwhile, proposed to Lavigne in Aug. 2012 with a 14 carat diamond ring.)\n\nAfter seeing a photo of Whibley and Cooper in costume, Nickelbackâs Kroeger responded via Twitter Oct. 28. âHey Deryck, loved the costumes!â the frontman wrote. âWe were going to dress up as you guys this year but all the parties had celebrity themes haha.â\n\nThank You!\n\nYou have successfully subscribed.\n\nIn a January 2010 KIIS-FM radio interview, Lavigne vowed she would always hold her ex-husband in high regard. âI think weâre very lucky. Weâve been friends for a really long time and we always will be family. We have a connection,â the Canadian singer said. âThings are good. Iâm really grateful for that.â\n\nTell Us: Do you think Deryck Whibley and Ari Cooperâs costumes were in poor taste?\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnaKusKx51qGgm6SVrnqlvsSsqp6rXaq9bq3SZpyxZaees6Z5wK%2BpoqRdoa63tcannGaen6d6qa3LpaawnZWjenN8kGtpcmlgZA%3D%3D"
