        "text": "This relationship could yield a high degree of psychological compatibility and powerful mutual attraction. The physical and psychological reality of your personality will exert a powerful magnetic pull over the sensitivity, receptivity, tenderness, and other key qualities of your partner.\n\nAvril Lavigne’s moon is located at 10° SCORPIO. Her ideal match is a partner with the sun at 4/16° SCORPIO or TAURUS.\n\nAvril Lavigne would be particularly well-matched to someone who mirrors her underlying psychic and unconscious aspirations. The secret ideal you cherish of the perfect partner would be aroused; it would harmonize beautifully with her ideal imaginary lover. This great psychic compatibility is the result of a harmonious relationship between the Moon of the masculine chart and the sun of the feminine one. It is propitious to a rich flow of energies between the most hidden and secret parts of both people. They are linked by an unconscious emotional bond.\n\nAvril Lavigne’s Venus is located at 2° SCORPIO. Her ideal match is a partner with Mars at 0/10° SCORPIO or TAURUS.\n\nThis type of partner would complement you perfectly in emotional and sentimental terms. This person would reflect and fulfill your ideal of sensuality to the greatest degree. Moreover, your ideal partner would resonate lastingly with your own psychic projections of your ideal. This positive relationship between the unconscious sexual yearnings of both partners would be likely to yield sensual relations of a tantalizingly mysterious and secret nature.\n\nAvril Lavigne is decidedly passionate and hypersensitive. Her attractions are strong and immediate, and quickly develop into passions fueled by the full range of strong sensual thrills – from ecstasy to the agony of jealousy and possessiveness. She would be especially attracted to this type. Passionate as well, she exudes a sexual aura which makes her extremely attractive. Her drive is strong and imperious, and although more sensual than voluptuous, can still be quite affectionate in intimate surroundings. Her ideal is forthright, direct, and sometimes a little possessive and jealous in return.\n\nAvril Lavigne’s ideal partner is someone with Venus at 18/30° Sagittarius or Gemini."
