        "text": "Credit: Shutterstock (3)\n\nAvril Lavigne's Dating History: Deryck Whibley, Brody Jenner, Chad Kroeger, Mod Sun and More\n\nAvril Lavigne has had a complicated love life over the years, including two divorces — but she's still open to romance. “I love love,” Lavigne told Billboard in October 2018 when reflecting on her marriages, one to Deryck Whibley and the second to Chad Kroeger. “The way I look at it is, I married my long-terms.” Despite releasing an album titled Love Sux in February 2022, Lavigne accepted another marriage proposal that March, getting engaged to Mod Sun after about a year of dating. Us Weekly confirmed in February 2023 that the twosome had called off their engagement. “Avril and Mod Sun have been on and off for the past two months, but are no longer together as a couple,” a source exclusively told Us at the time. However, Mod Sun’s rep claimed that the pair had been together days prior. Scroll down for a look at Lavigne’s dating history over the years:\n\nCredit: Vincent Yu/AP/Shutterstock\n\nChad Kroeger\n\nLavigne met the “Rockstar” singer while working on her self-titled album with him in March 2012.\n\nDuring a 2018 interview with Billboard, the Under My Skin musician recalled her thought process about collaborating with Kroeger at the time.\n\n“He’s had a ton of hit songs. He plays guitar. This could be great,” she explained. “A month later, I had a 14-carat ring on my finger.”\n\nThe songwriters wed in July 2013 and announced their separation in September 2015. Three years later, Lavigne was still singing her ex’s praises, telling Billboard, “Chad’s band has sold, like, over 50 million albums! They’re selling out arenas worldwide!”\n\nCredit: Image Press Agency/NurPhoto/Shutterstock\n\nMod Sun\n\nLavigne announced her engagement to Mod Sun after more than a year of dating via Instagram in March 2022.\n\n“Oui! Je t’aime pour toujours,” she captioned photos of her heart-shaped diamond ring and the proposal, which took place in view of the Eifel Tower in Paris.\n\nIn February 2023, Us confirmed that the pair had called off the engagement. Speculation that Lavigne and the Minnesota native had split first sparked after the “I’m With You” songstress was spotted out to dinner with Tyga earlier that month.\n\nHowever, an insider exclusively told Us that the outing was platonic.\n\n“Avril and Tyga are genuinely friends and nothing more,” the source explained. “There was absolutely no third party involved in the split.“\n\nCredit: George Pimentel/Shutterstock; Image Press Agency/NurPhoto/Shutterstock\n\nTyga\n\nThe “Juicy” rapper first sparked romance speculation with Lavigne in February 2023 after being spotted at dinner together. At the time, a source exclusively told Us that the pair “are genuinely friends and nothing more.” Us confirmed later that month that Lavigne and Mod Sun had quietly called off their engagement.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Lavigne was spotted in Paris with Tyga, adding fuel to the romance rumors. The twosome confirmed their relationship in March 2023 when they were seen kissing at a Paris Fashion Week party. Four months later, however, Us confirmed in June 2023 that the duo had called it quits.\n\nAfter briefly rekindling their relationship in July 2023, Us confirmed in October of that year that Tyga and Lavigne split once again."
