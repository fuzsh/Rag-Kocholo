        "text": "Avril Lavigne may have had a few setbacks in the relationships department, but it hasn't stopped her from being optimistic about the future of her love life.\n\nThe twice-divorced musician, who was most recently married to Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger (from 2013-2015) and before that rocker Deryck Whibley (from 2006-2010) told People in 2019, after the dissolution of her second marriage, that 'I believe in love.'\n\nThe 37-year-old also sang about finding love after heartbreak on her 2019 album Head Above Water, and she's now, once again, spoken candidly about her pursuit of romantic happiness. Interviewed by FAULT Magazine, Lavigne said: 'Yes, love is hard and relationships are not easy. It's not easy for anybody and I've now lived long enough to realise that I need to prioritise myself and take care of myself.'\n\nShe continued: 'I went through a phase where I was like, \"I'm gonna be independent and have time on my own for a minute...\" And it really didn't last that long!'\n\nThe singer, who's been dating 34-year-old musician Mod Sun of late (she featured on his 2021 song 'Flames') also discussed how much she feels she's changed since she was catapulted to fame with her debut album Let Go in 2002.\n\n'I look at all my albums like a journey into my story over the last 20 years,' she said.\n\nLavigne, whose upcoming album Love Sux is set to be released on February 25, added: 'I've been writing music from when I was a teen, to a young adult and this one is my story today as a woman.'\n\nWhen questioned about her mishaps, Lavigne highlighted being indecisive:\n\n'I change my mind a lot. I think that has something to do with being a Libra.\n\n'Everyone that works with me makes fun of me because of it but on the other hand, it keeps everyone on their toes... I'm very exciting.'\n\nIn her interview with People, she addressed her break-up from her second husband Kroeger, saying: 'Chad and I are super close.\n\n'I’m really grateful to have had someone like him in my life.'\n\nShe also spoke about her hopes for the future, saying she hasn't given up on a happy ending and insisting that she would 'of course' get married again.\n\nBut she also added: 'I don’t really care so much about that; I just care about being in a healthy relationship and just being happy.'"
