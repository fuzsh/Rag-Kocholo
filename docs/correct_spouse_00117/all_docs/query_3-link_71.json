        "text": "Avril Lavigne and Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger were due to get married today at a ceremony in Cannes.\n\nThe Canadian musicians, who bonded while recording Lavigne's fifth studio album, have been an item since last summer and have chosen Canada Day to tie the knot. \"He's Canadian, and I'm Canadian, and we have a lot in common,\" Lavigne explained in a recent interview with US chatshow host Chelsea Handler. The couple appear to have put a Canadian slant on the wedding itself, with red-and-white themed decor.\n\nOn Friday, Mike Heller, CEO of Talent Resources, which represents Lavigne, sparked a flurry of congratulations by tweeting that he was \"about to see\" his client get hitched. \"No pictures will be sent since this is #avril wedding but I will tell you everyone is so excited.\" However, US Weekly reported that the ceremony had not yet taken place, despite a wedding party on Saturday.\n\nReading this on mobile?

The couple have been collaborating since before their engagement, announced last August, and Kroeger co-wrote much of Lavigne's new album, due out in September.\n\n\"Chad is on board with all my [wedding] ideas,\" Lavigne told People last month. \"He likes what I like. He's down with whatever I'm down with.\" Kroeger has described their early courtship as \"incredibly powerful and something I'll never forget\"."
