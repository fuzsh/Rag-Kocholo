        "text": "George Allen Sr., Virginia State senator and lawyer, “Forget the past – the future will give you plenty to worry about.” The famous quote by the late United States politician, aptly captures what it means to put old differences aside.\n\nSum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley reunited with his ex-wife Avril Lavigne on the Las Vegas leg of her “Greatest Hits” tour, showing exactly what it means to put the past to bed. Thousands of fans at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Saturday, June 1, were held spellbound by the thrilling performance of the duo as they sizzled the atmosphere with a rendering of Sum 41’s “All Killer No Filler” single.\n\nWhat started as an electrifying show soon took an unexpectedly surprising turn when Lavigne invited the Sum 41 lead singer and guitarist onto the stage towards the end of her main set. She announced to her eager audience that a surprise was in store for them.\n\nFans went wild with excitement, but not before Whibley sprinted across the stage carrying his gold Les Paul guitar. For many, not only was the performance a delight but the awe-inspiring sight of the exes humming and vibing added some flair to the concert and became the perfect “cherry on top” experience.\n\nIn July 2006, the Sum 41 frontman married Lavigne in a private ceremony with 110 guests in Montecito, California. Their engagement had lasted a little over a year, beginning in June 2005. The couple were no strangers to one another, as they had maintained a friendship since Lavigne was 17 and officially started dating after she turned 19.\n\nThe marriage, which lasted for all but three years, was brought again to public attention in 2009 when Lavigne announced their split via a statement on her official website.\n\nOf their separation, Lavigne commented, “I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship.”\n\nFollowing The Divorce\n\nElisabeth Foley, Professor of Law and legal writer, “The most important discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart.”\n\nAnd yes, Avril Lavigne and Deryck Whibley did grow separately after finalizing their divorce on November 16, 2010.\n\nEarlier the same year in February, Lavigne had started dating MTV’s The Hills cast member, Brody Jenner, whom she remained with for two years until they split in 2012. Never one to give up on love, Lavigne fell hard for fellow Canadian artist Chad Kroeger, lead vocalist of the Canadian rock band Nickelback in July 2012.\n\nWhat started as a professional working relationship involving a collaboration on Lavigne’s fifth album grew into an engagement in August after a month of dating. Nearly a year later in July 2013, they were married at a rebuilt medieval castle, the Château de la Napoule, located on the Mediterranean in Southern France. The fairytale wedding and subsequent marriage was perhaps not meant to be, as Lavigne once again publicly announced her separation from Kroeger in September 2015 using her official Instagram account this time.\n\nIn 2022, Avril took the stage alone with her Bite Me concert when Casino Rama opened. It was the first time she performed when the casino relaxed its post-Covid 19 requirements and stopped requiring masks to be worn. Guests and visitors were able to relax for the first time not only at the concert, but also to taste the excitement of gaming at the establishment. Play not only roulette, but also poker, blackjack and other games. However, in covid many establishments have started a strong growth in the online space. And still continue to improve their service to this day. Visitors can explore sites to play keno online, slots and other games and choose an establishment that is more to their liking.\n\nHer ex-husband Deryck Whibley, at about that same time, had remarried just weeks before on August 30, 2015. This was his first publicly known relationship since the divorce back in 2010. With his new wife, model Ariana Cooper, Whibley shares two children – the first was born in March 2020, and the second in March 2023.\n\nIt’s All About The Music\n\nIn an exclusive interview featuring Deryck Whibley and released in April 2024. The lead vocalist during the session reiterated the pressure he had felt with the attention on his relationship and marriage to Lavigne at the height of their respective careers. He said,\n\n“I hated all that stuff. I’m better now than I was back then, but I’ve always been a more quiet, shy, homebody person. I don’t mind being out there on stage and promoting music and doing as much work as I can to push Sum 41’s music.”\n\nFun Fact: Nearly 15 years after calling it quits, not only have they remained friends, but the music was something that could always bring them together whenever the situation called for it. After Lavigne surprised her fans by inviting Whibley on stage and delivering an excellent performance together, the exes hugged it out after Lavigne beckoned on the audience to make some noise for her ex-husband."
