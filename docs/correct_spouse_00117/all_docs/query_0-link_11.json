        "text": "Deryck Whibley may have removed \"Lavigne\" from his name, but that doesn't mean Avril Lavigne isn't still a part of his life. The 29-year-old \"Hello Kitty\" songstress, who gave her last name to Whibley when they married in 2006, tweeted her support for her ex-husband after he landed in hospital with a collapsed liver and kidneys.\n\nThis past Friday, the Sum 41 singer broke the news on his website in a post entitled \"Rock Bottom.\" In the post, he shared photos of himself in a hospital bed and urged fans to \"drink responsibly.\"\n\n\"The reason I got so sick is from all the hard boozing I've been doing over the years,\" he wrote. \"It finally caught up to me.\"\n\nAccording to the entry, the 34-year-old Scaroborough, Ont. native was sitting at home drinking one night when he started feeling ill. \"I then collapsed to the ground unconscious. My fiance got me rushed to the hospital where they put me into the intensive care unit,\" he wrote. \"I was stuck with needles and I.V.s all over. I was completely sedated the first week.\"\n\nIt turned out the musician's liver and kidneys had collapsed. \"Needless to say it scared me straight,\" he told his fans. \"I finally realized I can't drink anymore. If I have one drink the doc's [sic] say I will die.\"\n\nLavigne tweeted on Saturday that she had spoken to Whibley after she re-tweeted a get-well wish to him. Back in 2007, a year into their marriage, the songstress spoke to Jane magazine about keeping Whibley on the straight and narrow.\n\n“He doesn’t do drugs. Clearly, he used to, because he talked about it, but I wouldn’t be with someone who did, and I made that very clear to him when we first started dating,\" she said. \"I’ve never done coke in my life, and I’m proud of that. Oh my God! I could never. I am 100 percent against drugs.”"
