        "text": "For those of us with teenage children, we know that they don’t usually think of us as being “cool.” However, Luke Bryan doesn’t seem to have that problem. His son Bo, who is 16, and Tate, who is 13, are cool with their famous dad’s vibe and his career in country music.\n\nIn a recent interview, Bryan was asked the question if his kids listened to his music. The proud dad replied, “You know, they’ll get into my truck, and they’ll, ya know, Tate will be like, ‘Dad, put some of your stuff on.'”\n\nAsked how it made the superstar feel, he smiled, and answered, “When your children ask to hear your music, it’s pretty special.”\n\nIn one of our interviews, Luke shared one of the things he was proud of: one of them was the way he’s handled fame. He said, “I’ve been able to be a big celebrity and live the celebrity life, but I’ve also been able to live as a real human, too, and not have to sacrifice a lot of stuff because I was a celebrity.”\n\n“I didn’t hide in the house and not leave the house because I’m so worried that someone’s gonna want a picture while I’m eating dinner.”\n\nRELATED: Luke Bryan: Getting Into His Country Boy Mind\n\nBryan recently told us that his new music video and song “Love You, Miss You, Mean It” were inspired by what he and his wife, Caroline, and many other young couples have gone through.\n\nLuke offered, “‘Love You, Miss You, Mean It’ is obviously about kids falling in love and that was their saying to let each other know that they loved one another. It’s about young love. It’s about going off to college and trying to make that work and it not working and then going full circle.”\n\nHe added, “I’ve kind of lived that world with my relationship with my wife and I, and I know a lot of other people out there have too.”\n\nBryan knew he had a gem on his hands the first time he heard the song, “This song was special from the first time I heard it. I knew it would resonate. It’s about young love and that whole process of trying to make relationships work through the on-again and off-again cycles.”\n\nThe music video shows Luke in a wet parking lot singing in a black jacket as a young couple sits in a car saying their goodbye, writing “Love, You, Miss You, Mean It” on the window.\n\nNancy Brooks has been working in the country music industry for almost 30 years. She has interviewed pretty much any country star you can think of. In the late 1990s, she started working with Dolly Parton. And yes, Nancy reports that Parton is as sweet as you would think. She loves her life in country music and has been backstage at every CMA Awards show since the late 1990s. Many of her stories are from her one-on-one interviews. She was there at the beginning of the incredible careers of many music superstars today, including Taylor Swift, Shania Twain, and Blake Shelton, and has interviewed them multiple times throughout the years."
