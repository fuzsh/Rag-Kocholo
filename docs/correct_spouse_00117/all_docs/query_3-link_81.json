Headlines both her music career and her love life have been a part of since her first single dropped in the early 2000s.\n\nThe singer has had a bit of a rocky past when it comes to relationships, but things seem to be looking up with her and her current boyfriend.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nGettyimages | Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin\n\nBefore finding love with her current boyfriend, Lavigne dated the billionaire Phillip Sarofim, hitting the public eye in early 2018. The relationship lasted for almost a year and a half before they split and Lavigne moved on to someone new.\n\nBefore Sarofim, Lavigne was with J.R. Rotem, a music producer who worked on Head Above Water. The couple split in quiet fashion in 2018.\n\nLavigne has also been married and divorced twice. Once to Deryck Whibley from Sum 41, who she married in 2006, and once to the frontman of Nickleback, Chad Kroeger. Kroeger and Lavigne were married in 2013.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nGettyimages | Kevin Mazur\n\nAs of now, Lavigne is with the musician Pete Jonas from the band Jagwar Twin. They were seen in attendance to Clive Davis's pre-Grammy Awards gala, where the couple posed for photos while smiling. They were also spotted inside the gala holding hands and embracing. Lavigne went on to introduce Jonas to Scooter Braun and several other guests.\n\nAlong with attending the gala, Jonas has posted photos of him and Lavigne on Instagram. Why is all of this information relevant, you ask? As of yet, neither have publicly commented on their relationship...\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nLavigne and Jonas were first spotted together before Lavigne had confirmed her separation with Phillip Sarofim. We can safely presume that Lavigne and Jonas met when Jagwar Twin was opening for Lavigne in the fall of 2019.\n\nTouring life was a new experience for Jagwar Twin and according to Roy English (the group's singer), Lavigne made the transition, surviving and thriving on the road, easier for them. English says:\n\n\"Avril's been so warm and kind to me and really to all of us on this tour. She's been giving me some really good advice actually because this touring life is new to me. She's really helped me to kind of put things into perspective as an artist, as a musician. [She] kind of has this role to help guide and push culture forward.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWikimedia | https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Avril_Lavigne_in_Hongkong_Press_cropped.jpg\n\nEven though Lavigne has already had two divorces, she's not giving up on the idea of marriage. She commented on how her past marriages affect her future outlook, saying:\n\n\"I donâ€™t really care so much about that. I just care about being in a healthy relationship and just being happy. I believe in love.\"\n\nWhen she was asked if she'd consider marriage again, she answered: \"Of course.\""
