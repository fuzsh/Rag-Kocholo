        "text": "There’s nothing but love between Avril Lavigne and her ex-husband Deryck Whibley\n\nIn fact, the Sk8r Boi hitmaker, 39, was beaming with joy as she invited the Sum 41 frontman, 44, to join her on stage during her ongoing Greatest Hits Tour at Ls Vegas’s MGM Grand on Saturday night, June 1st.\n\nHonoured by the sweet gesture, Whibley shared the moment Lavigne welcomed him on stage.\n\n“Please give it up for Deryck from Sum 41,” she announced to her fans as Whibley walked out.\n\nThe former spouses shared a long, loving embrace before launching into a duet of the rock band’s song, In Too Deep.\n\nThe pair tied the knot in 2006 when Lavigne was just 21 years old while Whibley was 26. However, they divorced just three years later, with People Magazine reporting the reason behind the split was that Lavigne simply felt too young to be a wife.\n\nSince then, Whibley has settled down with wife-of-nine years Ariana Cooper, while Lavigne has been playing the field.\n\nMost recently, she finally ended her on-off relationship with Tyga.\n\nIn a May episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast via People Magazine, Lavigne reflected on her tendency to jump into serious relationships while acknowledging that she’s a “f***ing awesome” partner."
