        "text": "IT seems Avril Lavigne was predicting her love life when she sang ‘Why’d you have to go and make things so complicated?’ all the way back in 2002.\n\nThe Canadian pop star, 38, is believed to have split from fiancé Mod Sun, 35 - less than a year after getting engaged.\n\nThe punk rocker was reportedly blindsided by the news, with his rep telling Page Six they \"were together and engaged as of three days ago when he left for tour... so, if anything has changed, that's news to him\".\n\nSources have claimed Avril and Mod Sun - real name - Derek Ryan Smith - have been on and off for months.\n\nMeanwhile, the day before news they'd called it quits emerged, Avril was spotted leaving a restaurant with rapper Tyga after the pair were seen sharing an embrace.\n\nInsiders told TMZ they are \"friends and nothing more\" and that there was no third party in Avril's split from her fiancé.\n\nAvril was previously been married to Sum 41 lead singer Deryck Whibley and Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger.\n\nShe's had some very high-profile relationships in between her marriages too - including a romance with Kendall and Kylie Jenner’s brother Brody. Here we take a look back at her complicated love life.\n\nDeryck Whibley\n\nAvril’s first marriage was to Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley when she was just 22, in July 2006, at a private estate in Montecito, California.\n\nThey’d been dating for three years prior, having met and become friends when Avril was 17.\n\nAfter little over three years of marriage Avril filed for divorce on October 9, 2009, saying she and Deryck “are separating and moving forward on a positive note”.\n\nBut their friendship and professional relationship continued - with Deryck even recently joining Avril and her new fiance Mod for dinner.\n\nSpeaking to Rolling Stone in April 2011, Avril said: “Everyone’s always surprised that we’re still so close … Deryck is the most talented person I know.\n\n“He produced, mixed, played guitar and bass [on my new album].\"\n\nShe added: “Getting divorced doesn’t mean drawing a line.\n\n“No regrets is my mantra and I certainly don’t have any regrets about marrying when and who I did.”\n\nBrody Jenner\n\nAvril didn’t waste much time after her divorce, and got together with Brody Jenner in 2010.\n\nThey were one of Hollywood’s hottest couples at the time and and were often seen enjoying double dates with Kim Kardashian and her then-husband Kris Humphries.\n\nAnd by July 2010, Brody had even got Avril's name tattooed on his arm.\n\nA month later and Avril was showing off her matching tattoo of Brody's name on her lower torso.\n\nThe former couple dated for two years before calling it quits in 2012.\n\nAn insider told Life and Style at the time that Avril \"wanted to settle down,\" but Brody reportedly \"wasn't exactly ready\".\n\nChad Kroeger\n\nIt was yet another whirlwind romance for Avril next as she got engaged to Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger in August 2012, after less than six months of dating.\n\nGushing about the rock star on Chelsea Lateley in 2013, she said: “I actually said, before we started dating, ‘I wanna date someone 10 years older than me’ — and he’s exactly 10 years older than me.\n\n“It’s nice, he’s got it together, he’s mature, he’s done his thing, he’s lived life, he’s been around the world on tour.\n\n“He’s Canadian, and I’m Canadian, and we have a lot in common.”\n\nThe couple married in a gothic-themed wedding in Southern France that July, but the relationship fell apart after two years and they divorced in 2015.\n\nBut, just like with Deryck, Avril is still very close to Chad, and he even helped her through her battle with Lyme disease and worked with her on her 2019 album, Head Above Water.\n\nShe told People: “He took me under his wing, he got me in the studio, he recorded me, he was very encouraging.\n\n“He helped me with some of the songs that I wrote, because he’s such a good songwriter — I’d be stuck on a lyric or stuck on a part, and he’d help me finish a song if I couldn’t and he would record it.\n\n“He’s just always been a cheerleader of mine and always been such a huge fan.\n\n“He’s in my corner, he’s on my side, and he’s always been really great.”\n\nRyan Cabrera\n\nA year after splitting from Chad, Avril was linked to singer Ryan Cabrera after they got close between 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe two were spotted kissing during romantic dinner dates - but have always maintained they’ve only ever been friends.\n\nSpeaking about his friendship with Avril, Ryan told TooFab: “She's the sweetest person in the entire world. Super shy, though, so a lot of times, she can come off... like, a lot of people are like, 'Oh, she might be to herself.'\n\n“But she's just super shy. If you went up to her and talked to her, she'd be the nicest person in the world. She has the sweetest heart and [is] one of the most incredible artists I've ever heard sing.\"\n\nRyan - who has a songwriting credit on Avril’s song Tell Me It’s Over - added: “We're literally like best friends, and to be able to spin ideas off each other, especially as somebody that I love as an artist and respect, and she loves my music and respects me as an artist as well, so it's cool to get to bounce ideas off your best friend.\"\n\nMod Sun\n\nAvril met Mod Sun in January 2021, while working together on her album Love Sux.\n\nShe told People: \"I knew we had a very strong unstoppable connection from the first week of writing and working together in the studio. Immediately.\n\n\"He made every day better. It was like I had known him forever. As time went on, things kept getting better, and it felt incredibly natural.\"\n\nIn March last year Mod Sun popped the question on a boat on the Seine River in Paris.\n\nSharing a picture of the happy moment on his Instagram, Mod wrote: \"The day we met I knew you were the one. Together forever til our days are done.\n\n\"I had a dream where I proposed in Paris. I pulled out a ring + asked you to wear it.\n\n\"I was on one knee as I looked in your eyes. You’re too beautiful for my words to describe.\n\n\"I grabbed your hand + took one last breath… I said 'will you marry me?' + she said 'yes.' I love you Avril.\"\n\nThe reason for their split remains unclear."
