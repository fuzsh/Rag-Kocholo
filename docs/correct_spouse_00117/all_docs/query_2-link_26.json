        "text": "You may not know the name Deryck Whibley, but that's probably because he's been going by Deryck Lavigne Whibley ever since marrying Avril Lavigne in 2006. No, wait, it's because he was the lead singer of Sum 41 and no one knows him. But he did finally change his name back four years after their divorce, so he has that going for him.\n\nLavigne and Whibley divorced in 2009, and he has just gotten around to petition to have the Lavigne removed from his name, E! reports. That's probably good, since she married Nickelback singer Chad Kroeger in July. What is with her and the sub-par singers?\n\nIt probably didn't help matters that Deryck dressed as Avril for Halloween last year, which would have made for some truly scary partygoing. In the end, Avril is the one with the new album, though, so Deryck can get back to talking trash when his name is back on iTunes."
