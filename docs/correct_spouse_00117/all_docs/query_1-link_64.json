Find fan-captured footage below.\n\nREAD MORE: Avril Lavigne – ‘Love Sux’ review: a modern update on early ’00s pop-punk\n\nThe collaboration between the two took place in Nevada over the weekend, as the ‘00s pop-punk singer continued her run ‘Greatest Hits’ tour dates.\n\nTaking to the stage at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Saturday night (June 1), Lavigne opened the show with fan favourites including ‘Girlfriend’, ‘What The Hell’ and ‘Complicated’, before embedding tracks from her latest album – 2022’s ‘Love Sux’ – into the setlist, such as ‘Bite Me’ and ‘Love It When You Hate Me’.\n\nShe also continued her trend of inviting opening act All Time Low to the stage midway through the set, and joining forces with them to perform a cover of their hit ‘Fake As Hell’.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the show in Las Vegas, however, Lavigne had another surprise up her sleeve, as she brought out Sum 41 singer Deryck Whibley to the stage for a duet.\n\n“Tonight we have a special guest, and he plays guitar in one of my favourite bands, and your favourite bands,” Avril said before inviting him onto the stage (via Kerrang!).\n\nRecommended\n\nThe two were a couple for just under seven years, and married for three. The appearance at the Avril Lavigne greatest hits shows came as Sum 41 have been embarking on their ‘Tour Of The Setting Sum’ live shows across the US.\n\nWhile on stage at MGM Grand Garden Arena, the two duetted on a cover of Sum 41’s huge hit ‘In Too Deep’. Check out more footage of the show below, as well as the full tracklist.\n\n@avrillavignetribe\n\nAvril Lavigne with Deryck Whibley performs “In To Deep” on stage during her ‘Greatest Hits Tour’ at MGM Grand Garden Arena, Las Vegas, NV, USA on 1 June, 2024. #avrillavigne #avrillavignefan #avrillavignefans #avrillavignesong #avril #lavigne #avrilramonalavigne #littleblackstar #littleblackstars #lbs #avrilforever #avrilislife #headabovewater #avrillavignetour #letgo #undermyskin #thebestdamnthing #goodbyelullaby #avrillavignealbum #lovesux #lovesuxtour #letgo20thanniversary #undermyskin20thanniversary #AL8 #greatesthitstour #avrillavignegreatesthitstour #simpleplan #alltimelow #sum41 #deryckwhibley @Avril Lavigne @Sum 41\n\n♬ suono originale – avrillavignetribe\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAvril Lavigne’s Las Vegas setlist was:\n\n1. ‘Girlfriend’\n\n2. ‘What The Hell’\n\n3. ‘Complicated’\n\n4. ‘Here’s To Never Growing Up’\n\n5. ‘Hot’\n\n6. ‘My Happy Ending’\n\n7. ‘He Wasn’t’\n\n8. ‘Don’t Tell Me’\n\n9. ‘Losing Grip’\n\n10. ‘When You’re Gone’\n\n11. ‘Fake As Hell’ (All Time Low cover – with All Time Low)\n\n12. ‘Bite Me’\n\n13. ‘Love It When You Hate Me’\n\n14. ‘In Too Deep’ (Sum 41 cover – with Deryck Whibley)\n\n15. ‘Sk8er Boi’\n\n16. ‘Head Above Water’\n\n17. ‘I’m With You’\n\nThe ongoing run of tour dates comes in celebration of the Canadian pop-punk star’s first greatest hits album, and leads up to her first-ever performance at Glastonbury.

She also has a run of huge outdoor gigs planned across the UK. Visit here for all UK tickets.\n\nThe singer’s latest album, ‘Love Sux‘, came out in February of 2022 and was described by NME in a three-star review as “a modern update on early ’00s pop-punk”. It added: “‘Love Sux’ is a progressive pop-punk album that eschews the old rules – but not at the expense of maximalist, joyful guitar anthems.”\n\nAs for Sum 41, the band will be performing at Download 2024 alongside Queens Of The Stone Age, Avenged Sevenfold, Fall Out Boy, Royal Blood, The Offspring, Machine Head, Pantera, Bad Omens, Corey Taylor, While She Sleeps and many more.\n\nAs for Whibley, the singer recently celebrated a decade of sobriety and shared memories of his recovery from alcohol addiction.\n\nThe band released their eighth and final record ‘Heaven :x: Hell’ in March. It is a double album, with the ‘Heaven’ side featuring 10 tracks of pop-punk-inspired music, influenced by their 2001’s ‘All Killer, No Filler’ and 2002’s ‘Does This Look Infected?’, and ‘Hell’ showcasing the heavier style that has defined recent Sum 41 releases like 2019’s ‘Order In Decline’.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Whibley spoke to NME about the record, saying, “there’s more to the album than nostalgia.”\n\n“Even if I tried to write ‘All Killer, No Filler’ again, I wouldn’t be able to,” he added. “It just doesn’t come out the same. The songs sound like they could be from those eras though.”"
