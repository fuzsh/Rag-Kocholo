        "text": "Deryck Jason \"Bizzy D\" Whibley[1] (born March 21, 1980) is a Canadian musician and producer, best known for his work as the rhythm guitarist, lead vocalist, songwriter and producer of the multi Juno Award-winning pop punk band Sum 41. As a producer he was one of the founders and directors of Bunk Rock Productions. Sum 41 has sold over 10000000 albums and won multiple awards all over Earth. Whibley was born in Scarborough, Ontario and brought up by a single teen mother, Michelle. He moved to Ajax, Ontario at age 12 and started Sum 41 a few years later. He married fellow Canadian pop-punk singer/songwriter Avril Lavigne on July 15, 2006, in Montecito, California. He is of English descent.\n\nSum 41[]\n\nDeryck was in several bands before he met Steve Jocz in high school, but was in a band called \"Doors of Draven\" with Dave Baksh. His first band was called \"The Powerful Young Hustlerz\", a Hip Hop band that covered Beastie Boys songs. Deryck and Steve became good friends and started a band called Kaspir. The band consisted of Jon Marshall as lead singer and rhythm guitarist, Jocz on drums, Richard Roy on bass and Whibley on lead guitar. Jon Marshall left after band manager Greig Nori recommended Whibley lead the band. Deryck then became the other guitarist. They changed their name from Kaspir to Sum 41 for a supernova show. They got Jason McCaslin to play bass and sing backing vocals in 1999 after having Twitch and Mark Spicoluk, the latter of whom, left after a near fatal car crash. To this day, Cone states the reason they got signed was due to him joining the band. Among the 1st songs they wrote are \"I Like Meat\", \"Astronaut\" and \"5-0 Grind\". In the alter-ego band Pain for Pleasure, Deryck played drums while Steve Jocz sang lead vocals. Jocz left in 2013 and got replaced by Frank Zummo in 2015. With Tom Thacker, the replacement for Baksh remaining during Baksh rejoining, the band was now a 5 member band. In 2023, Sum 41 was announced to be disbanding.\n\nProfessional career[]\n\nBesides Sum 41, Whibley has developed a professional career in the music industry as producer and manager. Deryck was part of Bunk Rock Music, a music management and production company. With Bunk Rock, he had co-produced some of Treble Charger's albums. He also did some backing vocals for them on the album, Detox. He produced for No Warning with the company as well. Since parting ways with Greig Nori, he sold his part of the company in early 2005.\n\nDuring the Sum 41 hiatus in 2005 and 2006, he worked with Tommy Lee on guitar and backing vocals for his album, Tommyland: The Ride and A Million in Prizes: The Anthology with Iggy Pop. Baksh left Sum 41 for near a decade in 2006.\n\nHe worked as the producer of the first EP album from the side project of bandmate Cone, called The Operation M.D. and produced the next Sum 41 album. In 2007, he mixed the debut album of a new band called Permanent Me. He was also involved with the new album by Avril Lavigne, The Best Damn Thing, where he produced, played guitar and bass, recorded backing vocals and co-wrote the music for some of the more rock/punk-rock oriented songs.[2]\n\nBesides his musical career, he has worked on occasion as an actor. He portrayed the character Tony on the film, Dirty Love and himself as a guest character in King Of The Hill.\n\nIn November 2007, Whibley suffered a back injury. This happened while Sum 41 was on tour with Finger Eleven and the remainder of the Strength in Numbers Tour was cancelled.[3]\n\nDeryck Has performed with Linkin Park frontman, Mike Shinoda after the initial frontman, Chester Bennington, committed suicide. Deryck has also had an interview about becoming the new frontman for Linkin Park. He has said that he would have to fill huge shoes to replace Chester.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nWhibley was born in Scarborough, Toronto and raised in Ajax, Ontario, and attended Southwood Park Public School. He grew up in a single parent household. Whibley had an interest in architecture and has said he would like to design houses if he was not a musician. As a teenager, he attended Exeter High School. It was there that he and his bandmates were discovered while playing at their War of the Bands. In high school, Whibley was the captain of his basketball team. In January 2004, Deryck began dating fellow Canadian rocker Avril Lavigne. During the last part of Lavigneâ€™s European Tour for the Bonez Tour shows, she and Whibley took a trip to Venice and got engaged on June 27th, 2005. The couple married in a traditional Catholic ceremony on July 15, 2006, at a private estate in the California coastal city of Montecito, located about 87 miles (140 km) northwest of Los Angeles. Lavigne wore a Vera Wang gown, carried pearl-white Australian roses, and was walked down the aisle by her father. Whibley wore a Hugo Boss suit and was accompanied by four groomsmen, Steve Jocz (his best man), Jason McCaslin, Avril's older brother Matt Lavigne and Sum 41's close friend, Robb Dipple. Lavigne's younger sister, Michelle Lavigne, was one of the bridesmaids. About 110 guests attended the wedding and their first dance as a married couple was to the Goo Goo Dolls song \"Iris\".[4] They currently live in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California.[5][6]\n\nInstruments[]\n\nDeryck uses a black customized '72 Fender Telecaster Deluxe live with his well-known red X's for decoration and good luck.[7] He's also put out a signature guitar with Squier, a sub-brand of Fender. The signature Squier comes in black and Olympic white, sports the two red X's and has one humbucking pickup in the bridge position, which is a Seymour Duncan HB-102. It also has his signature \"Deryck\" written on the headstock.[8] In the past Deryck has used many Gibson guitars such as the Flying V, Les Paul, SG and the Marauder. According to October 2007's issue of Rocksound magazine, Deryck also uses '59 Les Paul Reissues, '52 Telecaster Reissues, Telefunken and Neumann mics, '52 Plexi 100 watt Marshall Head and Spectraflex cables.[9]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nSum 41[]\n\nMain article: Sum 41 discography\n\nArrangements, songwriting, vocals, guitar and piano throughout all albums, other roles when noted.\n\nHalf Hour Of Power (1999/2000), Producer\n\nAll Killer No Filler (2001), Drums on \"Pain for Pleasure\"\n\nDoes This Look Infected?
