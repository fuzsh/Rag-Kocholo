        "text": "Earlier this year, Avril Lavigne and Mod Sun called it quits after a tenth month engagement.\n\nThe engagement wasn‚Äôt Avril‚Äôs first and she‚Äôs actually been engaged three times ‚Äì to Deryck Whibley, Chad Kroeger and finally, Mod Sun.\n\nThis of course means that she‚Äôs received three dazzling rings over the years, including a custom ring designed by Beverly Hills-based jeweller, XIV Karats.\n\nTaking a trip back in time, jewellery experts at Steven Stone, have taken a close look at Avril‚Äôs engagement ring collection, revealing that it‚Äôs worth a total value of $1,536,000.\n\nDeryck Whibley\n\nValue of ring: $50,000 (¬£42,000)\n\nAvril met Deryck Whibley on a night out in 2002 and they began dating in 2004. The Sum 41 frontman popped the question in Venice, Italy in June 2005 and the couple tied the knot in a private ceremony in California 13 months later.\n\nUnfortunately, after three years of marriage, the couple parted ways in September 2009, with Avril filing for divorce the following month.\n\nDeryck got down on one knee with an elegant solitaire ring that showcases a single 4 carat round cut diamond.\n\nTaking a closer look, our leading diamond expert, Maxwell Stone commented: ‚ÄúFeaturing a 4 carat round cut diamond in a solitaire setting, Avril‚Äôs engagement ring from Deryck is the most modest of her collection. I‚Äôd estimate it to be worth $50,000.‚Äù\n\nChad Kroeger\n\nValue of ring: $1,000,000 (¬£835,000)\n\nBack in 2012, Avril was engaged to Chad Kroeger, the lead singer for Nickelback. After connecting in the studio, they were swiftly engaged just one month and six days later.\n\nThe couple married in a Canadian medieval castle, surrounded by about 100 friends and family members in 2013, but unfortunately their marriage didn‚Äôt last and they announced their separation in 2015.\n\nChad proposed to Avril with a vintage-style platinum engagement ring featuring a 14 carat pear shaped diamond center stone, accented on each side with specially cut half-moon-shaped diamonds totaling an additional 4 carats.\n\nAfter taking a good look at the ring that Chad popped the question with, Maxwell said: ‚ÄúAvril‚Äôs vintage-style ring from Chad is quite something, and by far the most valuable in her collection. It features a huge 14 carat pear shaped center stone, which is accented on each side with specially cut half-moon-shaped diamonds that total an additional 4 carats. It‚Äôs likely to be worth a staggering $1,000,000.‚Äù\n\nMod Sun\n\nValue: $486,000 (¬£400,000)\n\nAvril met Mod Sun in 2020 when the musician reached out to her in hopes to collaborate on their January 2021 hit song, ‚ÄòFlames‚Äô. The pair started dating the following month.\n\nAvril announced her engagement to Mod last year via a series of images on Instagram, in which she showed off her dazzling new heart-shaped diamond engagement ring with the caption ‚ÄúOui! Je t‚Äôaime pour toujours ü§çüíçü•ÇDimanche. 27. Mars. 2022‚Ä≥.\n\nThe musician proposed with a custom ring designed by Beverly Hills-based jeweller XIV Karats, featuring a huge heart-shaped diamond set on a narrow pave band.\n\nMaxwell took a close look at the ring at the time, revealing everything you need to know: ‚ÄúAvril Lavigne‚Äôs heart shaped engagement ring from Mod Sun features a huge white diamond which looks to be around 5ct. It‚Äôs set on a thin pave band which accentuates the size of the stone, making it look even more spectacular. I would estimate it‚Äôs worth around ¬£350,000 to ¬£400,000 depending on the exact quality of the stone.\n\nHeart shaped rings are no doubt romantic as they illustrate the traditional symbol of love, and the story behind why Mod Sun chose this is very sentimental.\n\nInterestingly, they aren‚Äôt the most popular cut of diamond, with only a few other celebrities opting for a similar design. Lady Gaga received a gorgeous 6ct heart-shaped engagement ring from Taylor Kinney in 2015, whilst Gwen Stefani received one from Gavin Rossdale in 2002, although both couples unfortunately split.‚Äù\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for some jewellery inspiration, why not take a look at our full collection?
