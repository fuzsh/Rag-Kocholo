        "text": "Avril Lavigne has shown her support for ex-husband Deryck Whibley as he left hospital this week, by describing him as \"family\".\n\nThe singer shared her thoughts for her ex and Sum 41 frontman Deryck, after he left hospital following shock revelations he was at risk of dying from alcohol consumption.\n\nDeryck revealed he had spent the last month in hospital with a collapsed liver and kidneys in a startling message on his website , and said his boozing has now reached the point where if he has one more drink he will die.\n\nAvril was keen to show her never-ending support, and after retweeting a link to the singer's website, she wrote: \"Spoke to @Sum41 Deryck today. I am so proud of him. He is family to me and always will be. #StayStrongDeryck.\"\n\nIn the hard-hitting message, Deryck told his fans: \"The reason I got so sick is from all the hard boozing I've been doing over the years. It finally caught up on me.\n\n\"I was drinking hard every day. Until one night. I was sitting at home, poured myself another drink around midnight and was about to watch a movie when all of a sudden I didn't feel so good.\n\n\"I then collapsed to the ground unconscious.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old was rushed to hospital by his fiancee where doctors sedated him for a week and placed him on IV drips.\n\n\"I finally realised I can't drink anymore. If I have one drink the docs say I will die,\" Deryck posed on his blog on Friday.\n\n\"I'm not preaching or anything but just always drink responsibly. I didn't, and look where that got me.\"\n\nDeryck and Complicated singer Avril split in 2009 after just three years of marriage.\n\nThe Sk8er Boi star is now married to Chad Kroeger, who fronts rock band Nickelback.\n\nThe musician said the scare had renewed his passion for music and he was already writing new material."
