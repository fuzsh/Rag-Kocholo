        "text": "From her punk rock camaraderie with Deryck Whibley to an unexpected connection with Chad Kroeger and the headline-grabbing moments with Brody Jenner, Lavigne’s love life has been as dynamic as her music. Let’s take a look back at her dating history through the years …\n\n1. Jesse Colburn (2003-2004)\n\nEarly on, Lavigne, now 39, found romance within her own band with Jesse Colburn, the group’s rhythm guitarist. But the relationship eventually ended, leading Colburn to part ways with the band and pursue independent projects.\n\nLavigne reflected on the split in an interview with MTV News, suggesting that Colburn’s departure was a move to explore his own musical path.\n\n2. Deryck Whibley (2004-2009)\n\nLavigne and the lead vocalist of fellow pop-punk act Sum 41, Deryck Whibley, walked down the aisle in 2006 in a serene Californian ceremony, following a year of dating and a picturesque proposal in Italy in June 2005.\n\nTheir union, however, would come to a close after three years, with Lavigne initiating divorce proceedings in October 2009. Lavigne said she felt she had wed at too young an age, as was widely reported, prompting her to realise her need for independence and exploration.\n\n3. Brody Jenner (2010-2012)\n\nLavigne’s romance with reality star Brody Jenner, the son of Caitlyn Jenner, began with a kiss in Las Vegas in April 2010, swiftly becoming a source of public fascination. They famously commemorated their relationship with matching tattoos, showcasing their deep connection.\n\nHowever, their relationship wasn’t without its challenges: they were notably involved in a bar altercation in November 2011, leaving both with injuries. By early 2012, the pair mutually decided to part ways.\n\n4. Chad Kroeger (2012-2015)\n\nLavigne’s romance with Chad Kroeger was sparked by a collaboration in early 2012, which led to an engagement after just six months with a 14-carat diamond ring and a wedding in the South of France by July 2013, coinciding with Canada Day.\n\nHowever, the couple parted ways in September 2015 after two years of marriage. Announcing their separation on Instagram, Lavigne emphasised the enduring friendship and mutual respect that remained between them, alongside the unforgettable moments they had created together both in music and in life.\n\n5. Mod Sun (2021-2023)\n\nLavigne and Mod Sun’s collaboration on her album Love Sux in early 2021 soon evolved into a deep, unstoppable connection, culminating in a romantic proposal by Sun in Paris in March 2022 against the enchanting backdrop of Paris on a boat on the Seine River.\n\nHowever, the couple faced challenges nearly a year later, in early 2023, and ultimately decided to end their engagement. Sources close to them cited the relationship’s fluctuating nature leading to their decision to part ways.\n\n6. Tyga (2023)\n\nBy June, however, their romance faded, leading to a brief split followed by a short-lived reconciliation in Las Vegas. Still, by October 2023, sources confirmed the couple had permanently ended their relationship after several months together."
