        "text": "It doesn't seem like Avril Lavigne is kissing and telling! While being interviewed by Alex Cooper on the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast, released on Wednesday, May 15, the singer avoided discussing her split from ex Tyga.\n\n“Did you ever date Tyga? Wait, does it annoy you that every time you upload something with Tyga, people are like, ‘Is this your announcement that you’re dating?’ Or you don’t care?” Cooper asked.\n\nThe \"Complicated\" songstress, 39, replied: “I didn’t Google myself. Is that what it says?”\n\n\"Sometimes you just have to take that leap of faith and trust that if you're not happy, it's not a good relationship or a good situation, just get out. It's OK to have time on your own in between if you need it. Just believe and hope that something greater is out there for you,\" she added.\n\nAs OK! previously reported, Lavigne and the rapper, 34, were first seen together in February 2023 — just a little while after she called off her engagement to Mod Sun.\n\n\"Avril and Mod Sun have been on and off for the past two months,\" a source insisted at the time. “Avril and Tyga are genuinely friends and nothing more. There was absolutely no third party involved in the split.\"\n\nTyga and Lavigne were last spotted attending a Fourth of July party in Malibu, Calif., last summer.\n\nBut their whirlwind romance didn't last, as they broke up and got back together but ultimately called it quits for good in October 2023.\n\n“Avril and Tyga broke up a while ago,” a source said at the time. “There was nothing specific that happened, their relationship had simply run its course.”"
