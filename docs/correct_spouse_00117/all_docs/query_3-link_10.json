Together forever til our days are done. I had a dream where I proposed in Paris. I pulled out a ring + asked you to wear it. I was on one knee as I looked in your eyes. You’re too beautiful for my words to describe. I grabbed your hand + took one last breath… I said ‘will you marry me?’ + she said ‘yes,’” he wrote. “I love you Avril.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CcDl8mPpaLP\n\nLavigne and Mod Sun started out as coworkers in January 2021 when they co-wrote the single Flames and appeared in the song’s music video together.\n\nTrending Now\n\nKamala Harris’ top picks for VP could also be her strongest competitors\n\nBiden bows out, backs Harris, sending shockwaves through U.S. politics\n\nMod Sun declared his love for the Sk8er Boi singer with a neck tattoo of her name in February 2021. The two made their first red carpet debut at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nIn March, Lavigne appeared on The Kelly Clarkson Show where she gushed over new beau and revealed that a couple days after she wrote Love Sux, which set the tone for her latest album, she had a boyfriend.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CaaiFUFvm7N/\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n“I’m literally never single,” she said at the time.\n\nThis will be Lavigne’s third marriage.

So it’s really fun.”"
