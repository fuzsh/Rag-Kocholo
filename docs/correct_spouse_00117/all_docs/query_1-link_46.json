        "text": "Avril Lavigne confirmed that the rumors are true — she and hubby Deryck Whibley are separating.\n\nThe Canadian couple has split after three years of marriage. Lavigne made the announcement on her blog:\n\n“Deryck and I have been together for six and a half years. We have been friends since I was 17, started dating when I was 19, and married when I was 21. I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship. I admire Deryck and have a great amount of respect for him,” Lavigne said.\n\n“He is the most amazing person I know, and I love him with all my heart. Deryck and I are separating and moving forward on a positive note. Thank you to all my family, friends and fans for all your support.”\n\nIt has been a summer of rumors about the marriage of Lavigne and Whibley. Sources close to the couple have said their union was on the rocks for months so today’s announcement should come as no surprise.\n\nBut, call us naive, but we are surprised. Lavigne and Whibley seemed like the most adorable couple. Both in the same business sharing similar genres of music, why wouldn’t it work — this is Hollywood after all!\n\nWhibley took to his band Sum 41’s MySpace page to issue his statement on the separation.\n\n“The past 6-and-a-half years have been the most amazing years of my life. It’s sad it has come to an end, but Avril and I are still family and moving forward in the most positive way possible,” Whibley said on the page. “Our decision to part ways is amicable and she holds a special place in my heart and forever will be a great and amazing friend — thanks to all our family, friends and fans for all the support.”\n\nRead on for more celebrity news"
