        "text": "\"The most important thing is finding someone that you're compatible with,\" the 'Love Sux' singer shared on the 'Call Her Daddy' podcast on Wednesday\n\nAvril Lavigne may not have much to share about her current dating life, but she knows exactly what she’s looking for — and what she brings to the table.\n\nThe “Complicated” singer, 39, appeared on the Call Her Daddy podcast on Wednesday, May 15, where she answered prying questions about her love life — save for her recent romance with Tyga — while reflecting on her early years in the industry.\n\n“I never really did the dating thing,” Lavigne admitted to host Alex Cooper. “I was always, like, in a pretty major relationship.”\n\nThe eight-time Grammy-nominated artist also proclaimed that she’s “f---ing awesome” when in a relationship, adding, “I would date me. I cook. I'm a really big cook, really big into, like, the house and decorating, and I have a lot of fun with that.”\n\nWhen asked if she’s currently seeing anyone, Lavigne coyly shrugged her shoulders and declined to answer. However, she did share some of her general relationship requirements, saying, “The most important thing is finding someone that you’re compatible with.”\n\n“Obviously, it all just sounds cliché,” she continued, “someone that is trustworthy, ‘cause if you don’t have that, you’re just never going to feel grounded in the relationship, and you’re going to be spinning.”\n\nRelated: Avril Lavigne Addresses 'Dumb' Rumor That She's Been Replaced with Body Double Named Melissa: 'It's Just Funny to Me'\n\nThe Goodbye Lullaby singer confirmed that, for her, a “healthy relationship is ideal,” emphasizing, “Duh!” “Do we really have to say these things?” she asked. “They’re so simple and cliché and basic, but that’s what you need.”\n\nShe also shared that she doesn’t have a particular type, but would enjoy dating someone “who’s like me — sporty, rough around the edges, likes to have a good time, but is a solid. I need someone who’s solid that I can lean on.”\n\nLavigne rounded out the relationship discussion by sharing the biggest lesson she’s learned about love so far, which she apparently, grasped after releasing her last studio album in 2022.\n\n“I mean, I definitely went through my jaded phase with my previous album called Love Sux,” she said. “And I had gone into a place of, alright, I’m just going to focus on myself. I’m going to move to Malibu, build my own life for me, and I’m not gonna wait for a guy or rely on a guy to do that.”\n\n“It definitely felt like I got the wind knocked out of me,” the singer added of the revelation. “I had been through, like, enough … I was in a place of, like, never trust a guy again, and you’re just going to have to rely on yourself. But I don’t feel that way today, thankfully.”\n\nRelated: Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, Post Malone, Kelsea Ballerini and More to Perform at 2024 ACM Awards\n\nWhen Cooper asked if the “What the Hell” artist had ever been cheated on, Lavigne responded, “Have I ever been with a male before? Then the answer is yes!”\n\nShe added, “As much as anyone’s ever f---ed me over, which has happened a s--- ton, I’ve always just like been the classy bitch and taken the high road and kept it to myself.”\n\nOffering up advice on when to move on from a relationship, Lavigne told Cooper, “It’s hard when you’re in something because you’re in it, so it’s a big deal to leave a relationship.\"\n\n\"Change is hard, to have to step out, it requires a lot, and some people can’t see that clearly\" she continued. \"It’s always easier once you’re on the other end. But if you’re not happy, you’re never gonna be happy. Life is short and you should just really get out as soon as possible so you can move on and then have a better future for yourself.”\n\nThe singer added, “Some people like to have something that they’re leaving and going to, and sometimes you have to take that leap of faith and just trust that, if you’re not happy and it’s not a healthy relationship, it’s not a good situation, just to get out.\"\n\n\"And it’s OK to have time on your own in between if you need it. Just believe and hope that something greater is out there for you. And if not, you’re better off on your own than someone draining the f--- out of you.”\n\nRelated: Avril Lavigne Promises to Sing 'Greatest Hits from All My Albums' on Summer 2024 Tour — See the Dates!\n\nThis summer, Lavigne is hitting the road for her first-ever Greatest Hits tour, where she’ll also perform iconic songs featured on her forthcoming Greatest Hits album, out on June 21.\n\n“Tour dates for 2024 baby!” the “Bite Me” singer shared in her January announcement on social media. “I’ll be doing the Greatest Hits from all of my albums and along with some of your favorites, perhaps some special requests?
