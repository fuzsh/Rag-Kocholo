        "text": "Avril Lavigne and Tyga recently confirmed their romance with a kiss at Paris Fashion Week this month. The duo was first linked together just over a week ago, nearly a year after singer Mod Sun proposed to Avril. Now, a lot of people are wondering how in the world Avril and Tyga ended up together, and one TikToker may have the answer.\n\nA user (@abbzbon) created a flow chart to reveal how the Kardashians and Jenners have links to Avril and Tyga. Her video went viral, garnering nearly 30 million views and over three million likes on the platform, and the audience cannot believe how \"messy\" their relationship is!\n\n\"Let's begin,\" she enthusiastically says. \"Tyga is now dating Avril Lavigne ‚Äì why is this a big deal? Let me show you.\"\n\n\"Tyga used to be with, and has a baby with, Blac Chyna. Blac Chyna used to be with, and has a baby with, Rob Kardashian.\" She continues, \"Rob Kardashian is half-siblings with Kylie Jenner.\"\n\n\"Why does that matter?\" she asks. \"Kylie Jenner used to date Tyga. Kylie Jenner also has another half-sibling named Brody Jenner, who we all know from The Hills.\"\n\n\"Why is that a big deal? Brody Jenner and Avril Lavigne used to be in a very serious relationship, so serious that they actually went to Kim Kardashian's wedding together to Chris Humphries, who we don't like to talk about.\"\n\nAre you still following along? We're almost at the end here. The TikToker explains, \"Let's go back to Tyga for a second. Tyga used to be married to someone named Jordan Craig. You may not know who that is, but fun fact, Jordan Craig used to be with, and has the first baby, of third semester Thompson ‚Äì also known as Tristan Thompson ‚Äì who we also don't like to talk about.\"\n\n\"Tristan, as we know, used to be with Khloe and has two babies. Khloe is siblings with Kim, with Brody, with Kylie, and with Rob ‚Äì and with Kourtney Kardashian, who is married to Travis Barker.\"\n\n\"Travis Barker, is a musician, as we all know. And one of his prot√©g√©s is someone named Mod Sun. Mod Sun used to be engaged to Avril Lavigne a few weeks ago. And Avril Lavigne is signed to Travis Barker's record label,\" the TikToker concludes. \"There you have it, folks!\"\n\nSo how does ex-fianc√© Mod Sun feel about all this? According to a source who spoke with TMZ, Mod is \"blindsided\" by the abrupt end of his engagement with Avril, and is \"absolutely devastated\" about her and Tyga. Understandably so, since the ex-couple sounded excited when they announced their engagement back in March 2022. \"Oui! Je t‚Äôaime pour toujours ü§çüíçü•ÇDimanche. 27. Mars. 2022,\" Avril wrote in her Instagram caption. This translates to \"Yes, I love you forever. Sunday. March 27, 2022.\"\n\nOne week ago, Mod took to Instagram to share his heartbreak. \"In 1 week my entire life completely changed‚Ä¶I just know there‚Äôs a plan for it all,\" he said in his caption. \"I‚Äôll keep my head up + always listen to my heart, even when it feels broken üíî Being surrounded by love every night on tour has been an absolute blessing. I have the best friends in the entire world, thanks for always having my back. See you on stage.\""
