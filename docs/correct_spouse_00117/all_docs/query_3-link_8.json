I can't describe it, it's like she's putting on an accent and everything is very 'oo' sounding. It bugs me and she sounds so much better when she sings properly IMO. She didn't used to do it.\n\nDillon\n\nRetired Staff\n\nMOTM Sept '15; SOTY '15 Winner; BA Donator\n\n\"He's probably a circus freak!\"\n\nJoin Date:\n\nPosts: 1,930\n\nLikes: 2,277\n\nLocation: United States\n\nLast Online:\n\nPost by Dillon on\n\nOne pronunciation that Avril sings live that bothers me is the way she sings 'blaring' in her live performances of HTNGU.\n\nBogoGog24\n\nAdministrator\n\nI'm off again in my world...\n\nJoin Date:\n\nPosts: 15,074\n\nLikes: 40,052\n\nLast Online:\n\nPost by BogoGog24 on\n\nYeah she started doing weird pronunciations in GL era. I have no idea why. It bothers me a lot too, doesn't she realize how stupid it sounds?
