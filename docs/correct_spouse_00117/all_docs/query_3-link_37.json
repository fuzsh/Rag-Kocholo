Unfortunately for Lavigne, they have never quite died, with fans regularly mentioning the theory.\n\nSpeaking to EW, she addressed the theory, calling it \"a dumb internet rumour\".\n\nThe 40 greatest song lyrics\n\nShow all 40\n\n\"It’s just a dumb internet rumor and [I’m] flabbergasted that people bought into it.

On one hand, everyone is like, 'Oh my god, you look the same,' and on the other hand people are like 'Oh my god, she died'.\"\n\nPrevioulsy speaking about why the rumour became so popular, Lavigne said that \"people are just bored and need something to talk about\".\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
