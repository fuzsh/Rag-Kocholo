        "text": "Avril Lavigne may be busy performing with Taylor Swift, but the \"Girlfriend\" singer's ex-husband, Deryck Whibley, also has exciting news because he just got married to model Ariana Cooper in Los Angeles. The ceremony took place almost a year-and-a-half after the Sum 41 guy experienced organ failure.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR CELEB EXES YOU HAD NO IDEA ARE MARRIED!\n\nAccording to People, \"It was a chill and intimate ceremony. They had a violin play at the ceremony and the music was mellow, not typical rock that Deryck's band plays, which was surprising.\"\n\nAwww, what a nice ceremony! It sounds like they had a perfect day.\n\nAre you surprised Avril's ex got married? Send your congrats to the couple in the comments!"
