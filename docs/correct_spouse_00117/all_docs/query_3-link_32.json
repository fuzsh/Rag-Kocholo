The lyrics arent special and the instrumental and the melody are pretty boring, imo.

She never has anything interesting to say, she lacks the ability to tell stories and I think she also lacks self awareness which she holds her back as a songwriter.\n\nPost by BogoGog24 on\n\nHere's my unpopular opinion: I like Hello Kitty a lot, kind of as a guilty pleasure song, and I also really like the music video, even if there were things wrong with it like the bad lip synching.

It's a shame because the songs I like on GL and AL are really good (IMO obviously), but the rest of the album really lets the whole thing down.\n\nETA: I also find Tomorrow quite boring and I don't dislike Don't Tell Me or WYWH but I usually skip them.\n\nPost by jenda358 on\n\nI really enjoyed this thread in the old forum, so I thought why not bring it back to life...\n\nThis thread always offered good opinions for discussions and gave us many surprises (\"whaaat, you dislike MHE?
