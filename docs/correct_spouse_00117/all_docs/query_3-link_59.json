        "text": "She slates Britney Spears for being a bad role Model, yet in her \"Girlfriend\" video, she is promoting bullying.:mad:\n\nhttp://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a46553/lavigne-and-pink-hit-out-at-spears.html\n\nShe has said before that she does not believe it's nice to steal someone's boyfriend and that it was \"mean\".\n\nAlso of note is that she steals the boyfriend from \"herself\" wearing a wig in the video.\n\nHer new album is supposed to be fun and not taken too seriously.\n\n0\n\noh Avril Lavigne - she's that 'punk' singer right?\n\nI think as soon as she opens her mouth she looses any credability.\n\nStill, one has to get in the papers somehow...and its not like her latest album is getting rave reviews..:sleep:\n\nShe is not \"punk\", others may have labelled her as that but she does not condone it.\n\nHer album's reviews have been fine and both the album/single have reached #1 in many countries.\n\nThe next single \"When You're Gone\" will please those disappointed with the 'morally wrong' \"Girlfriend\".\n\n0\n\nI think she is a hypocrite for slating Britney for showing her body and then prancing around in hot pants with a few close ups of her crotch bouncing around in the video.\n\nBut I don't like Britney either and I think what she said about her is right. She is a bad role model.\n\n0\n\nSome people think a bit too much about things.\n\nshe steals a boy from herself in the video. It is a clear joke, anyone who was honestly and truely offended by the video probably offend others with their own stupidity. The whole song isn't very serious at all, or at least so it seems to me, and to all those who have got her album to number 1 and those around the world who bought the single and album getting it to number 1.\n\n0\n\nAvril Latrine is so over.\n\nThe album has some of the worst reviews I have ever read.\n\nAnd for someone who tries to be the \"anti-britney\" she's suddenly looking very polished in her videos.\n\nAs soon as I saw her with the pink and blonde extensions I knew that she had turned he back on her original Sk8R Boi image. At least Britney doesnt try to hide the fact that she makes pop music and doesnt try and pass it out as some kind of \"rawk\". Come on, her new song sound like it could be a hillary duff track.\n\nBesides, anyone remember the video clip of the stupid little tart SPITTING in the face of the paparazzi? She's a moron.\n\nCant stand her accent either\n\n\"HEY HEY YAW YAW\"\n\nIf she wants to be the new britney spears then thats fine, but she cant expect people to take her serious as a credible artist.\n\n0\n\nHave you read my thread? Yes, Britney might be a bad role model, but so is Avril Lavigne. In her \"Girlfriend\" video, she is promoting bullying.:rolleyes:\n\nI think britneys breakdown was the red light for avril to try and fill her shoes.\n\nShe's gone from dressing like a drab boy to dressing like a manicured airhead in fishnet tights.\n\nNothing this girl does can be taken seriously.\n\nLOL look what I just spotted on Perez\n\nhttp://perezhilton.com/topics/avril_lavigne/cheap_desperate_20070516.php\n\n0\n\nShe is not \"punk\", others may have labelled her as that but she does not condone it.\n\nHer album's reviews have been fine and both the album/single have reached #1 in many countries.\n\nThe next single \"When You're Gone\" will please those disappointed with the 'morally wrong' \"Girlfriend\".\n\nDave - I was being sarcastic - She's as much a 'punk singer' as Cheryl Cole is an opera singer.\n\nShe wants to court controversy by slagging off others - how else would she gain column inches?\n\nGirlfriend is a song that makes me run to change the dial - its like Daphne and Celeste (anyone remember them?) are being evoked!\n\nApril is humourless sour puss that takes herself far to seriously - IMO!\n\n0\n\nDave - I was being sarcastic - She's as much a 'punk singer' as Cheryl Cole is an opera singer.\n\nShe wants to court controversy by slagging off others - how else would she gain column inches?\n\nGirlfriend is a song that makes me run to change the dial - its like Daphne and Celeste (anyone remember them?) are being evoked!\n\nApril is humourless sour puss that takes herself far to seriously - IMO!\n\nCouldn't agree more. Whenever i've seen her being interviewed she's always so defensive and miserable. Maybe she would be more likeable if she smiled once in a while and opened up a bit! She does seem to contradict herself a lot too. Come on Avril, lighten up!! :rolleyes:\n\n0\n\nThe problem with interviews in this country is that they are \"foreign\" to her.\n\nPutting her on a sofa with Lorraine Kelly talking to Charlotte Church is an odd experience for a Canadian girl from Ontario.\n\nRegardless of what country she is from she is still a human being and should know how to interact with people.\n\nYes she IS moody and miserable. I dont know if its her true personality or just a persona she is trying to project but she just comes across as a moody cow.\n\nI remember seeing her on TRL with carson when she debuted a few years ago and she has a face like thunder on her then also. You cant tell me she doesnt know how to interact with people from the states :rolleyes:\n\n0\n\nOh my God Avril - youre so mean and moody and street to boot! Imagine - spitting at the paparazzi and calling them a b*tch! telling them to f off - youre so orginial! - where do you get your ideas and attitude from?\n\nStill, its nice to see celebrities supporting you thought the flash bulbs of publicity - Dennis the Menace hasnt seen much action lately.\n\nAnd they thought Courtney Love was tough!\n\n0\n\nTo be honest Avril has always gotten on my nerves. She always struck me as this sullen greasy haired brat, now here she is a 23 year old married woman singing songs like 'Hey, Hey, you yeah I wanna be your girlfriend'. I mean surely a song like that should have been sung by a 14 year old?\n\n0\n\nIt suited Avril, and more importantly, Avril's record company, to paint her as the anti-Britney, 'credible' teenage songstress three or four years ago, but was it ever really anything other than a pose (ironic given the lyrics to 'Complicated')?\n\nWith Britney off the scene, musically, for the last 2 years the marketing mavens have realised that a) there is nothing current for an 'anti-Britney' to rail against, and b) an opportunity exists to metaphorically 'steal her clothes', hence Avril's extreme makeover from 'Sk8ergrrl Rock Chick' to 'Candy-Coloured Valley Girl Princess' - the brutal cynicism of the music biz never ceases to amaze.\n\nWhat amuses me more however is, leaving aside the debate about relative musical credibility, those like Avril Lavigne, Pink et al who queue up to throw easy brickbats at Britney are somewhat shown up by the La Spears herself who seldom if ever finds it necessary to criticize or denigrate her fellow artistes in public.\n\n:rolleyes:\n\n0"
