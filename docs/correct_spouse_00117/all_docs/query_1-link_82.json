That style of dress calls for a more voluptuous figure, someone with some actual breasts and a curvy waist line, not a bony scrawny stick. The pics aren''t quite good enough to tell how Avril pulls it off.\n\nbling*diva*\n\nIdeal_Rock\n\nJoined\n\nJun 17, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n4,026\n\nJul 18, 2006\n\n#24\n\nDate: 7/18/2006 5:40:56 PM\n\nAuthor: codex57\n\nDate: 7/16/2006 7:05:30 PM\n\nAuthor: bling*diva*\n\n~~Here are a couple of runway shots of her dress...\n\nHow''d you manage to d/l pics from the Vera Wang website?

I think they should use a model that BEST suits the dress. The same body type does not look good in all dresses, especially if they have a different silhouette! That drives me absolutely insane!!!!\n\nMara\n\nSuper_Ideal_Rock\n\nJoined\n\nOct 30, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n31,003\n\nJul 18, 2006\n\n#26\n\nwow it hardly looks like her!! She looks lovely but i really don't like that shade of straw blonde on her...it's too fake looking. Also that waist on the dress, yeah not my thing either...she looks kinda preggo in that last shot but i'm sure it's just the dress (or gas!! hee hee)....she definitely has blossomed since that dark angry young thing originally...hehhee. i hope this marriage makes it longer than the typically 2-3 hollywood years!\n\nbee*\n\nSuper_Ideal_Rock\n\nJoined\n\nMay 14, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n12,169\n\nJul 19, 2006\n\n#27\n\nwow-I think she looks great.
