        "text": "Punk princess Avril Lavigne shot to fame in the early 2000s thanks to her iconic hits including Sk8er Boi. Ever since she first emerged on the music scene at the tender age of 17, Avril has continued to wow fans with her impressive vocals and sensational performances.\n\nIn 2022, the Canadian songstress embarked on a global arena tour with rapper Machine Gun Kelly. And to top it all off, the talented songstress very recently signed to Travis Barker's new record label. Impressive!\n\nThe singer's dating history is 'complicated' to say the least, (pun intended). \"Relationships are not easy, but at the same time, I do love love, and I want to be in a relationship and happy and long-term, and I'm in a really good place right now,\" she told Extra.\n\nAs the hitmaker continues to dazzle fans far and wide, the team at HELLO! is taking a deep dive into Avril’s dating history. Did you know that the star has walked down the aisle twice before? Keep scrolling for the full run-down…\n\nDid Avril Lavigne date her guitarist, Jesse Colburn?\n\nIn the early 2000s, Avril dated her rhythm guitarist, Jesse Colburn. Their romance was short-lived however, with Jesse eventually leaving the band following their breakup. At the time, Avril told MTV News: \"He just wanted to go do his own thing and stuff, and I mean, that happens.\"\n\nJesse, 41, played in Avril's band from 2002 to 2004. Elsewhere, the punk guitarist played for Canadian group Closet Monster, which formed at Pickering High School in 1997.\n\nDid Avril Lavigne date Deryck Whibley?\n\nAvril subsequently dated Deryck Whibley for around one year, before Deryck popped the question in Venice in June 2005. They later tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Montecito, California.\n\nThe singer met the Sum 41 frontman at a bar aged 17. \"I made out with him the first day I met him,\" she told Rolling Stone in 2011. \"He gave me my first shot of Jäger. I had a tie on—it was back in the days of the tie.\"\n\nAvril and Deryck nonetheless called it quits in September 2009 after three years of marriage. Avril filed for divorce a month later, citing irreconcilable differences. At the time of their split, she issued a statement on her website which read: \"Deryck and I have been together for 6-and-a-half years. We have been friends since I was 17, started dating when I was 19, and married when I was 21. I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship.\"\n\nMORE: Avril Lavigne discusses whirlwind wedding and divorce with ex-husbands\n\nMORE: Avril Lavigne puts on show-stopping display in knee-high boots\n\nShe added: \"I admire Deryck and have a great amount of respect for him. He is the most amazing person I know and I love him with all my heart. Deryck and I are separating and moving forward on a positive note.\"\n\nDespite parting ways, Avril and Deryck have remained on good terms. In 2010, Avril told Ryan Seacrest on his KISS radio show: \"He's one of my best friends… We've been friends for a really long time, and we always will be. We're family and we have a connection.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in 2011, the former couple joined forces on Avril's 2011 album Goodbye Lullaby.\n\nHow long did Brody Jenner and Avril Lavigne date?\n\nAvril and The Hills star Brody Jenner dated for two years between 2010 and 2012. The couple went on to get tattoos of each other's name, followed by matching lightning bolts and f-bomb inkings. Their decision to split in 2012 was reportedly a \"mutual decision.\" And a quick glance at Twitter suggests that there was zero bad blood between the former lovers.\n\n\"It really upsets me to read all the FALSE!! stories,\" Brody tweeted. \"Avril has always been there for me and is the closest person to my heart. I love her.\" In response, Avril penned: \"Luv u 2!!! @brodyjenner.\"\n\nDid Chad Kroeger and Avril Lavigne date?\n\nThe When You’re Gone songstress started dating Nickelback's Chad Kroeger in early 2012. The lovebirds were smitten with one another, with Chad popping the question after just six months of dating. Chad got down on one knee with a jaw-dropping 14-carat diamond ring. In an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Avril shared a glimpse inside her beau's proposal.\n\n\"I had been making this scrapbook of my time in the studio. I walk over and he had taken a photo of himself holding the ring box and put the Polaroid in my scrapbook,\" Avril revealed.\n\nRead more: Avril Lavigne's dramatic style transformation\n\n\"Because I had stickers everywhere he put in 'Will you marry me?' It was really romantic and kind of made sense.\"\n\nThe couple exchanged vows in July 2013 in the South of France. In an exclusive interview with HELLO!, Chad revealed how he cried when he saw his bride at the altar. \"I had goosebumps from head to toe and my eyes filled with tears. It's a moment I will never forget as long as I live,\" he said.\n\nAvril and Chad had a gothic-themed wedding complete with candle-lit tables, black roses and fireworks. \"I wanted it to be over the top. I'm obsessed with castles and I love French décor and Goth,\" Avril told HELLO!.\n\n\"I found this castle and it was perfect. I also wanted to make sure it was a crazy vacation and an experience of a lifetime for our guests.\"\n\nMORE: How Avril Lavigne's black gothic wedding dress was worlds apart from her first wedding\n\nThe couple split in September 2015 after two years of marriage. At the time of their split, the songstress took to her Instagram with a statement which read: \"It is with [a] heavy heart that Chad and I announce our separation today.\n\n\"Through not only the marriage, but the music as well, we've created many unforgettable moments. We are still, and forever will be, the best of friends, and will always care deeply for each other. To all our family, friends and fans, thank you sincerely for the support.\"\n\nWhat happened to Avril Lavigne and Mod Sun?\n\nAvril and Mod Sun (Derek Smith) first crossed paths in 2021 when they joined forces on Avril's album, Love Sux. The couple officially started dating in September 2021 and got engaged in March 2022 after roughly one year of dating.\n\nMORE: Avril Lavigne thanks 'man who changed my life' after Mod Sun split\n\nSpeaking to People magazine, Avril gushed: \"It was the most perfect, romantic proposal I could ever ask for. We were in Paris on a boat in the Seine River. We had a violin player, champagne and roses. It felt like time stood still, and it was just the two of us in the moment.\"\n\nMod Sun, meanwhile, penned a loving tribute to his fiancée. Taking to Instagram, he wrote: \"The day we met, I knew you were the one… Together forever til our days are done.\"\n\nDespite falling head over heels for one another, the couple called off their engagement a year after Mod Sun got down on one knee.\n\nWho is Avril Lavigne in a relationship with?\n\nAvril Lavigne is currently dating Tyga after she was seen with the Rack City rapper at Mugler X Hunter Schafer's party during Paris Fashion Week on 6 March 2023.\n\nRELATED: Avril Lavigne spotted kissing Tyga in Paris following break-up\n\nMORE: Avril Lavigne sends temperatures soaring in skin-tight see-through leather pants and bustier\n\nAccording to reports, the duo are taking things slowly and are very much into one another.
