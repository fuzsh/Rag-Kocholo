County Court to go back to his birth name ... sans Lavigne.\n\nIt's pretty crazy -- A) because he took her last name in the first place and NO ONE KNEW, and B) because it took him so long (FOUR YEARS) to switch it back.\n\nWhibley and Lavigne got hitched in 2006 and divorced in 2010.\n\nTo review: Deryck ended up stuck with Avril's last name -- and Avril ended up ... stuck with Chad Kroger."
