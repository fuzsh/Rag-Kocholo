Avril Lavigne may be busy performing with Taylor Swift, but the "Girlfriend" singer's ex-husband, Deryck Whibley, also has exciting news because he just got married to model Ariana Cooper in Los Angeles. The ceremony took place almost a year-and-a-half after the Sum 41 guy experienced organ failure.

According to People, "It was a chill and intimate ceremony. They had a violin play at the ceremony and the music was mellow, not typical rock that Deryck's band plays, which was surprising."

Awww, what a nice ceremony! It sounds like they had a perfect day.
