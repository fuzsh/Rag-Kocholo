Avril Lavigne and Deryck Whibley may be exes, but they're clearly on good terms. Over the weekend, Lavigne surprised fans in Las Vegas by bringing out her ex-husband to perform Sum 41's hit "In Too Deep."

"Tonight we have a special guest, and he plays guitar in one of my favorite bands, and your favorite bands,” she told the crowd before bringing Whibley onstage. “Ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Deryck from Sum 41!”

The two were married from 2006-2010. A year after their divorce, Whibley was featured on Lavigne's 2011 album Goodbye Lullaby.
