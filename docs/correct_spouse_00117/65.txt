Avril Lavigne is close to splitting from husband Deryck Whibley, reports say.

According to the National Enquirer, the pair have been growing apart since Lavigne embarked on her world tour earlier this year.

Whibley was recently seen holding the hand of an unknown woman at a nightclub in Los Angeles.

"Deryck isn't motivated in his own career, so he's been drinking and partying," said a source.

Lavigne commented earlier this year that her marriage to Whibley is strong, despite her touring schedule.

"We email and talk on the phone. I'm always on my BlackBerry... He comes out and visits. I was just in Europe and he came out for two weeks at the beginning of the tour and two weeks at the end of the tour," she said.
