DERYCK Whibley is giving marriage a second shot.

The Sum 41 frontman, who is the ex-husband of Avril Lavigne, married Ariana Cooper at the Hotel Bel Air Los Angeles over the weekend.

“It was a chill and intimate ceremony,” an insider told People Magazine.

“They had a violin play at the ceremony and the music was mellow, not typical rock that Deryck’s band plays, which was surprising.”

The bride wore an elegant white gown, accented with a pair of personalised all-white Converse Chuck Taylors, while the 35-year-old groom wore an understated black suit.

Whibley and Cooper’s wedding capped a remarkable turnaround for the rocker.

In April 2014, he was hospitalised after nearly drinking himself to death, and has been on the mend ever since.

“I’m glad it happened now and not when I’m like, 50, because my body wouldn’t have been able to handle it,” he said about his recovery earlier this year.

“But it’s unfortunate that it had to even come to that. However, now I’m feeling better than I’ve ever felt. I’m healthier. I’m in the best shape of my life. I’m more productive. Well, I was always really productive, but I was just good at being a functional alcoholic.”

This is the rocker’s second marriage. He and Avril Lavigne divorced in 2009 after three years of marriage.
