        "text": "Visitors choosing hotels in Santo Domingo will be immersed in the fascinating history of the The Dominican Republic, a country that shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. Santo Domingo is the oldest European city in the Americas, and it should not be forgotten that it is a tourist destination in the Caribbean. Visitors who choose to visit it will find luxury hotels with first-class facilities, elegant dining rooms, and exciting nightlife. Santo Domingo is also a city full of history. Its Colonial Zone was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in recognition of its list of unparalleled historical sites: the first cathedral in the New World, the first fortress, the first university, the first palace, and the first monastery. It is also a city of contrasts where a skyline of modern skyscrapers rises up together with small buildings dating back to the 15th century. Add to all this the fact that it features access to some of the best beaches in the world, there is no doubt that Santo Domingo is a very desirable vacation destination.\n\nThe hotels in Santo Domingo have everything you need to enjoy a comfortable stay: rooms with Wi-Fi access, restaurants, pools, and a customer service team to help you plan excursions to the most popular tourist attractions. At the top of the to-do list for most visitors is a stroll through the Colonial Zone. The tour starts at the Primada de América Cathedral, with its brilliant facade of gold and coral tones. Inside, vaulted ceilings and Roman arches span impressive floor-to-ceiling heights. Each of its 14 chapels is well worth a visit. Overlooking the Ozama River, where it meets the Caribbean Sea, sits the Ozama Fortress, the oldest military structure in the New World. Its stone façade and imposing battlements serve as a reminder of the various invasions of the Dominican Republic throughout history. Spain, France, England, Haiti, and the United States have each flown their flags here. The top of the tower grants amazing views of the river and the sea.\n\nThe Museum of the Royal Houses is a Renaissance building that displays a vast array of objects, including treasures from sunken Spanish galleons, weapons, and indigenous Taino artifacts. It’s a must-see during any visit to the Colonial Zone. The Alcázar de Colon Museum was at one point the home of Christopher Columbus’s son. It was carefully restored to evoke its original appearance. Inside, you can view objects that once belonged to the Columbus family, including a carved canopy bed. Calle El Conde is a pedestrian-only street in the Colonial Zone that runs between the cathedral and Independence Park. It’s the ideal spot to rest your legs, enjoy a cup of coffee, or shop for amber, ceramics, textiles, or silver goods at traditional markets.\n\nAfter taking in so much history, most tourists opt for a relaxing trip to the beach or a dip in the pool at one of Santo Domingo’s hotels. A glass of local rum and an evening meal featuring regional dishes like sancocho, beef stew, yuca, and plantain, makes the perfect ending to an exciting day of exploration."
