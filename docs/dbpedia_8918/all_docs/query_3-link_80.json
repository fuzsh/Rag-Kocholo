        "text": "Dedication of the Santo Domingo Dominican Republic Temple\n\nPrior to the dedication of the Santo Domingo Dominican Republic Temple, Latter-day Saints on the island of Hispaniola — which is split between the Dominican Republic and Haiti — would have to travel to Guatemala or Florida to visit a house of the Lord. After the temple was constructed in Santo Domingo, however, both Dominicans and Haitians could drive to a temple to perform sacred ordinances. Many who recalled once praying for a chapel rejoiced at the opening of a temple of their own.\n\nChurch President Gordon B. Hinckley dedicated the Santo Domingo Dominican Republic Temple on Sept. 17, 2000. At the dedication, Domingo Aybar, president of the Santo Domingo Villa Mella Stake, told the Church News that “the Church is growing here because of the quality of the people — Dominicans are believers.”\n\n“This is the most special day in the history of our country,” said Georgina Rosario, a young woman who joined the Church a decade prior, after a member friend shared the gospel’s happy message. “The Church is growing in Santo Domingo because of the importance of the family in this country. Our country and our families will grow because of the influence of the temple.”\n\n“Christopher Columbus came here over 500 years ago, and they built lighthouses in those days for protection,” said Kevin Mortensen, one of the 10 original missionaries in the Dominican Republic. “Now the real lighthouse has come.”\n\nDedicatory prayer excerpt: “May this be a house of peace and a refuge from the noise and confusion of the world. May there grow in the hearts of those who come here a certain conviction concerning the validity and the purpose of that which they do in service to Thee and Thy children.”\n\nRead the dedicatory prayer of the Santo Domingo Dominican Republic Temple here.\n\nThe First Presidency announced a temple for Santo Domingo on Nov. 16, 1993. The groundbreaking ceremony for the house of the Lord was held Aug. 18, 1996.\n\nVisitors toured the temple during its open house from Aug. 26 through Sept. 9, 2000. The Santo Domingo Dominican Republic Temple was dedicated Sept. 17, 2000.\n\nArchitecture and Design of the Santo Domingo Dominican Republic Temple\n\nThe 67,000-square-foot Santo Domingo temple was built on 6.42 acres of land. Tall, arched windows can be seen around the structure, and a multilevel tower on a square base stands above the entrance. The site, adorned with palm trees, offers an expansive view of the Caribbean Sea to the south.\n\nThe temple interior contains four instruction rooms, four sealing rooms, the celestial room and the baptistry."
