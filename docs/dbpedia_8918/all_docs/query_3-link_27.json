        "text": "Established in 1493 when Spanish settlers first set foot on the island, and formally recognized on 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo stands as the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus, brother of Christopher Columbus, founded the settlement and christened it La Nueva Isabela in homage to Queen Isabella I of Spain, with the settlement in the north already named La Isabela. In 1495, it underwent a name change to “Santo Domingo,” in honor of Saint Dominic. Gaining prominence as the “Gateway to the Caribbean,” Santo Domingo became the principal town in Hispaniola. It served as the launching point for pivotal expeditions, including Ponce de León’s colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar’s colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortés’ conquest of Mexico, and Vasco Núñez de Balboa’s historic sighting of the Pacific Ocean. Uncover the historical legacy of Santo Domingo, a city that played a central role in shaping the course of the Americas.\n\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo faced significant destruction at the hands of a powerful hurricane. Responding to this devastation, the new Governor Nicolás de Ovando orchestrated the reconstruction of the city, opting for a different location on the opposite bank of the Ozama River. Today, remnants of the original city layout and a substantial section of its defensive wall endure, offering a tangible link to history within the Colonial Zone. Acknowledging its historical significance, the Colonial Zone has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Explore the enduring traces of Santo Domingo’s past, as witnessed in the well-preserved Colonial Zone.\n\nDiego Columbus, the son of Christopher Columbus, arrived in Santo Domingo in 1509, taking on the roles of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand II of Aragon instituted a Real Audiencia, appointing Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon as judges of appeal. The Laws of Burgos were introduced in 1514 by Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra, shaping regulations for Spanish colonies. Rodrigo de Alburquerque assumed the role of repartidor de indios and later appointed visitadores to ensure compliance with the laws. This period marked significant administrative and legal developments in the governance of Santo Domingo.\n\nThe first major slave revolt in the Americas unfolded in Santo Domingo in 1521, as enslaved Africans rebelled on Diego Columbus’s sugar plantation. In 1586, the privateer Sir Francis Drake seized the city, holding it for ransom. Drake’s capture marked a turning point, signaling the decline of Spain’s control over Hispaniola. The early 17th century saw further challenges with Spanish policies causing depopulation outside the capital. In 1655, an expedition from Oliver Cromwell attacked Santo Domingo, but local militias successfully repulsed the English force. The Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 acknowledged France’s dominion over the western third of the island (now Haiti). Throughout the 18th century, Santo Domingo’s privateers patrolled the Caribbean, capturing numerous enemy merchantmen.\n\nFrom 1795 to 1822, Santo Domingo underwent multiple changes in ownership, mirroring the shifts in the broader colony. It was ceded to France in 1795. The city experienced a brief capture by Haitian rebels in 1801, was recovered by France in 1802, faced an unsuccessful invasion from Haiti in 1805, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821, Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation known as the Republic of Spanish Haiti after Criollo bourgeois, led by José Núñez de Cáceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. However, the nation was annexed by Haiti just two months later. These events led to significant instability and unrest, resulting in the loss of much of the Spanish-born peninsular population in the city and the colony.\n\nSanto Domingo, the capital city of the Dominican Republic, offers a wide variety of hotel options for visitors of all budgets and preferences. From luxurious resorts to affordable boutique hotels, there is something for everyone in this vibrant and historic city.\n\nLuxury hotels such as the JW Marriott Santo Domingo and the Renaissance Santo Domingo Jaragua Hotel & Casino offer premium accommodations and amenities for those seeking a high-end experience. Both are located in the upscale Piantini neighborhood, known for its shopping and dining options. Prices for these hotels typically range from $200 to $400 per night.\n\nFor mid-range options, hotels like the Catalonia Santo Domingo and the Sheraton Santo Domingo provide comfortable accommodations with convenient locations. The Catalonia is situated in the Malecon area, overlooking the Caribbean Sea, while the Sheraton is located in the heart of the financial district. Prices for these hotels range from $80 to $150 per night.\n\nBudget travelers can find great deals at hotels like the Hotel Conde de Peñalba and the Hotel Aladino. Both are located in the Colonial Zone, offering easy access to the city’s historic sites and museums. Prices for these hotels typically range from $30 to $70 per night.\n\nNo matter where you choose to stay in Santo Domingo, there are plenty of options to suit your needs and budget. With its rich history, vibrant culture, and beautiful architecture, Santo Domingo is an ideal destination for travelers looking for an authentic Caribbean experience."
