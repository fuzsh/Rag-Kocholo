        "text": "Stroll around the first European Colonial city in the New World and admire its historical buildings. Originally located on the east bank of the Ozama River, it was the first city built by the Spaniards during the American colonization.\n\nSanto Domingo is the first city in the American continent. It was declared World Heritage Site by the United Nations back in 1990, due to its historical importance and impeccably cared for buildings and streets.\n\nBook this custom experience and get to know one of the most beautiful and historically rich cities in the world.\n\nYour private driver+tour guide will pick you and your group up at the resort at 09:00 if coming from Punta Cana or 10:00 from La Romana or Bayahibe.\n\nSanto Domingo is a two-hour drive from Punta Cana or a 1.5-hour drive from La Romana or Bayahibe.\n\nEnjoy the beautiful scenery as you get closer to our beautiful capital city along the seaside Autovia del Este, the road that connects Punta Cana to Santo Domingo.\n\nOnce you arrive at the colonial zone (before lunch time) your driver will drop you and your guide off in the colonial zone, to start the walking tour.\n\nYou can have lunch at one of the many Dominican and international restaurants located in the colonial zone. We recommend the restaurants in Plaza de La Atarazana.\n\nLa Atarazana looks over the Columbus House (Alc√°zar de Colon) and is a European style walking street that hosts several restaurants ranging from Spanish cuisine, to Italian, Dominican, as well as bars and coffee shops."
