        "text": "Santo Domingo, the captial of the Dominican Republic and also of Santo Domingo Province, is the oldest city in the New World.\n\nAbout[]\n\nIt was originally founded on the eastern shore of the Ozama, in 1494, by Barthelemy Columbus who first gave it the name of New Isabelle, to consecrate the one given to the city started the previous year on the North coast; but the name of Santo Domingo was substituted, Because of that of the father of Columbus who was called Dominic.\n\nThe inhabitants of ancient Isabella did not decide to cross Santo-Domingo until 1496. A hurricane which took place in 1502, and which overthrew almost all the establishments, then built in wood and covered with thatch, added to the devastation caused an innumerable quantity of ants. These events contributed to governor Nicolas Ovando's decision to transfer, in 1504, this city on the western edge of Ozama, where Diego Columbus had already built his house in very thick wall and furnished with artillery to defend against the Indians; the remains of which can be seen. The other hurricanes that ravaged this city took place in 1495, 1508, 1509, 1510, 1526, and 1548.\n\nIn 1830, when Spain sent to claim from Haiti the restitution of the Eastern part, its former colony, all the batteries of Santo Domingo were restored. The new town had many expansions; the individuals made constructions there by speculation, this point having attracted a considerable influx of colonists coming from Spain; however, it suffered greatly from the devastation caused by its capture by the English admiral Drake, in 1586, and by the earthquakes of 1684 and 1691.\n\nIt has the figure of a trapeze of about 450 toises in the east, along the Ozama, four hundred toises in the south, along the sea, and about 2,660 toises in circumference. All around the city reigns a thick rampart, lined with bastions from distance to distance: the fortification called the FORCE, adjoining the arsenal, which directs its pieces on the sea and the mouth of the Ozama, is the first, established by Ovando. There was a lot of artillery; but the English took most of the cast iron in 1809 to pay for the aid they had given to the inhabitants, due to the expulsion of the French by General don Juan Sanchez: they had demanded church bells, but the inhabitants preferred to give out the cannons. A chain of height extends from Ozama to San Carlos, a suburb in the Northweest and dominates it in the North. There are the forts of Angle, Santa Barba, San Antonio, Saint Francisque, Saint Lazarre and Conception, Pala Hincado, Escarapan, Saint Gilles, San Carlos, San Jose, of San Fernandez, of Sainte Catherine, of Sainte Claire.\n\nThe city of Santo Domingo was the seat of the famous university which made it nicknamed the Athens of the New World.
