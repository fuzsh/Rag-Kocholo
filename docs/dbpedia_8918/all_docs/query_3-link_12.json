        "text": "For other places with the same name, see Santo Domingo (disambiguation).\n\nSanto Domingo is the capital of the Dominican Republic, the oldest European city in the Americas, and the most developed city on the island of Hispaniola. The old city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Elsewhere in the Dominican Republic, which is named after Santo Domingo, it's more common to just call this city \"the capital\" than to call it by its name.\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nSanto Domingo is the capital city of the Dominican Republic, and it prides itself in being the first European city in the New World. Founded by Christopher Columbus's brother Bartolome Colombus in 1496, it is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial empire in the New World. For this reason, the city of Santo Domingo has a really rich historic and cultural heritage that makes any visit extremely worthwhile. Santo Domingo remains one of the most populous cities in the Central America-Caribbean area, and the main economic and commercial center of this region. The country suffered 31 years of a brutal dictatorship by Trujillo, during which time the city was called \"Ciudad Trujillo\".\n\nThe city is divided into two parts by the Ozama River. The western side is very developed economically, while the eastern part, known as \"Santo Domingo Este,\" has lagged behind.\n\nThe most important tourist destination of the city is the Zona Colonial or Colonial Zone, on the western bank of the river and facing the Caribbean Sea. To the west of the Zona Colonial lies Gazcue, one of the city's oldest neighborhoods, filled with old Victorian houses and tree-lined streets. The city's waterfront George Washington Avenue, known as \"El Malecon,\" borders the Caribbean Sea and attracts many tourists because of its hotels, casinos, palm-lined boulevards and monuments. Surrounding the Gazcue area you will find the Palacio Nacional (seat of the Dominican government), the National Theater, the museums in the Plaza de la Cultura, and the Palace of Fine Arts.\n\nIn the central part of western Santo Domingo lies the economic and commercial heart of the city, in an area known as the \"Poligono Central\" and delimited by the 27 de Febrero, John F. Kennedy, Winston Churchill and Maximo Gomez avenues. This high-income area remains rather unexplored by tourists, despite offering most of the best dining and shopping available in the city. Many of the city's most affluent neighborhoods surround the city's two main parks, the Parque Mirador Sur in the South and the Jardin Botanico in the North.\n\nIn the more populated but less developed East Santo Domingo you will find other major monuments and tourist spots, such as Columbus's Lighthouse, where the explorer's remains are buried, the open caves of the Parque Nacional Los Tres Ojos, and the National Aquarium.\n\nThis all makes of Santo Domingo a cosmopolitan, vibrant and bustling city with very distinct neighborhoods and ambiances, all worth a visit, and providing the most diverse cultural experiences.\n\nWhat's nice about Santo Domingo is that it receives significantly fewer tourists than other cities in the Dominican Republic such as Punta Cana and La Romana. As a result, travelers to Santo Domingo are rewarded by being able to experience a completely true and authentic Dominican experience that is hard to come across in major tourist hubs.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nSanto Domingo enjoys a tropical climate. Temperature averages from 23°C (73.4°F) in the morning to 31.7°C (89.1°F) by the afternoon. Generally, January and February are the coldest months, and August is the hottest month of the year. The island is prone to hurricanes especially during June 1 to November 30, but warnings beforehand prepare residents and tourists for any harm. Santo Domingo is a great city to visit during any season, because the city's ideal tropical weather runs all year long!\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nSanto Domingo is the headquarter of economic activity in Dominican Republic. The city catches the attention of many international firms. Many of these firms have their headquarters in the city due to its great location and prosperous economy. The city is also home to over 26 colleges and universities including the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo, which is the largest and the first university of the Americas.\n\nPower outages have been one of the downfalls of placing a major headquarter in the city, but the infrastructure is a great advantage to many of these international firms. Since Santo Domingo has privatize and integrated with the US telecommunication system, they have been fortunate to have the benefit of a contemporary telecommunication system.\n\nIncomes in Santo Domingo can vary from extremely rich to extremely poor. Many of the prominent families live in neighborhoods surrounding Avenida John F. Kennedy (\"Avenida\" = \"Avenue\") to the north, Avenida 27 de Febrero to the south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida Máximo Gómez to the east. Some other areas that are always expanding and developing are Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Paraíso, Bella Vista, Sarasota. Most of the city's less fortunate live outside the center of Santo Domingo, which can be seen by various slums that emphasizes the huge issue poverty is for the city.\n\nAvenida Winston Churchill and 27 de Febrero Avenue are two of the commercial centers of the city. Many malls and shops are found in these two avenues, such as Acropolis Center, Scotiabank, Citibank, Banco BHD, Banco del Progreso, Banreservas, Plaza Central and Plaza Naco. However, some of the most popular malls are Acropolis Center, Bella Vista Mall, Blue Mall, Novo-Centro, Agora Mall and Galería 360 because it contains more contemporary shops and are popular within the high income families.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe national government of the Dominican Republic is located in Santo Domingo. The National Palace houses the President of Dominican Republic and the National Congress.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nDirect flights from: Atlanta, Boston, New York, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Philadelphia, Panama City, San Jose Costa Rica, San Juan Puerto Rico, Havana, Port-au-Prince, Caracas, Paris, Madrid Barajas, Frankfurt Airport, Munich Airport and Düsseldorf and surrounding Caribbean islands.\n\nAirfare to Santo Domingo may vary widely depending on season and demand. A round trip ticket from Boston or New York ranges anywhere from US$300 to US$700, with fares from Miami or San Juan only slightly lower.\n\nAirfare from most cities in Latin America cost between US$400 and US$1,000 and require layovers in Panamá City, Panamá (Copa Airlines) or San José, Costa Rica (Avianca).\n\nTaxis charge anywhere US$25-40 for the drive from the airport into Santo Domingo. Or, go up to the second floor at the Arrivals (at the very end), where a minivan will accommodate up to 8 passengers for a ride for RD$70 (pesos) for 1/2 hour to the Zona Colonial (only). For further distances to the center (i.e. to the Caribe Tours Terminal), you will need to negotiate just like you would have with the usual un-metered taxis. To return, the cheapest option is to go to the corner of Av. Sabena Larga with Av. Las Americas (walkable in 15 minutes from Zona Colonial), where this same van may be there, or if not take the bus going to Boca Chica (RD$40, about 1 hr); ask the driver to stop before the express route to the airport, from where you can walk (about 20 minutes, some 2 km). Do not return during night time. Hardly anyone speaks English in the bus, around the terminals etc. However getting to the city center seems more viable, that van was recommended at the Tourist Desk in the airport, and some sort of authority (with a badge) was entertaining the driver while waiting for the car to be filled.\n\nSince the DR is pretty small it is possible to fly into any of the other airports in the country and do a short (2-5 hours) overland trip from there.\n\nBy ferry\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is ferry service to and from Mayaguez as well as San Juan, Puerto Rico. It costs around US$200 roundtrip and the overnight journey last 12 hours. For an additional fee, you can bring your car along for the ride. The former company, Ferries del Caribe is now out of business and the new provider is called America Cruise Ferries[dead link] .\n\nBy cruise\n\n[edit]\n\nSansouci is a state-of-the-art terminal that holds up to 3800 passengers and luggage. From there you can get a taxi or a tour, and there is also an ATM, gift shops, a call center, and internet service.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nSanto Domingo is served by Expreso Bavaro and Caribe Tours from Punta Cana and by Caribe Tours from Sosua via Puerto Plata and Santiago de los Caballeros. Taxis from the bus terminals to the historic city center cost between RD$200 and RD$400, depending on bargaining skills.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nSanto Domingo used to be a huge city (population nearly 4 million people) that was split into 5 independent municipalities: Distrito Nacional, Santo Domingo Este, Santo Domingo Oeste, Santo Domingo Norte and Boca Chica. Fortunately, nearly all tourist attractions and shopping, dining and entertainment venues are relatively close to each other in the Distrito Nacional, making it easy for you to get around and see the sights.\n\nSanto Domingo is not entirely a tourist-friendly city. It's often hard to move around if you don't know the city, as many streets lack proper signage and addresses are often reliant on the neighborhood's name more than an actual street address. However, don't be afraid of asking the locals for orientation, as Dominicans are well known for their helpful nature and usually helpful to tourists. It's a good idea to get a street map (there are many city maps online but it's also possible to buy one at any gift shop or book store for no more than US$5).\n\nBy metro\n\n[edit]\n\nSanto Domingo has two operating metro lines: one a north-south axis under the Maximo Gomez avenue, going from Villa Mella to the Centro de los Heroes and the Malecon, passing by the National Theater and the Santo Domingo Autonomous University (UASD), the second along Avenida John F. Kennedy. A single ride is RD$20 and there are ten ride packages for RD$185 and twenty ride packages for RD$360. Payment is by smartcard which costs RD$60 and has to be charged with a minimum of RD$20 when bought bringing the total minimum price to RD$80. Five more lines are planned. The metro is easily the fastest way to get to the places it serves and if your accommodation is close to a metro station, just remember the name of that metro station for orientation and reference. However, large parts of the city are not (yet) covered. The website has a bit more information.\n\nWalking along major thoroughfares in Santo Domingo can prove quite challenging. First, drivers aren't very respectful of pedestrians, so you have to take extra care when trying to cross a street. Second, some sidewalks can be damaged or under construction, forcing you onto the street.\n\nThe Malecon and Colonial Zone are the most walkable parts of the city. They offer multiple pedestrian attractions and are relatively safe areas for tourists to explore. Although it is always wise to use common sense as everywhere.\n\nWhile exploring the Colonial Zone try hiring a properly licensed tour guide. These talented yet underpaid, multilingual individuals will keep you entertained for hours with unprecedented historical insight and humor. You can usually find them at the Plaza Colon in front of the Cathedral. Most are worth every penny. On the other hand, some of them are known to take their customers to businesses that throw them a kickback, so it's up to you to decide whether you really like to act upon their advice on businesses or not.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nUnlike most major metropolitan areas, there are very few roaming taxis in Santo Domingo. Even if you see one, it is best not to take a chance, it can be dangerous. In most cases you have to call a dispatcher to have a taxi sent to your location. This isn't a problem and most businesses will gladly call a cab for you. Relatively expensive, usually US$4-15 per average trip and possibly more if you use one of the friendly cabs waiting in front of your nice hotel lobby. Again, depending on circumstances, you may find that hiring a cab driver for the day is a good bargain.\n\nSanto Domingo is served by Uber, which locally allows passengers to pay by credit card through the app or by cash to the driver. Uber rides around the city are considerably less expensive than regular taxis and usually involve both newer and cleaner vehicles.\n\nAlso be sure to never get into stray cabs at night or cabs that aren't sent by a dispatcher, they are not the safest. Some cabs will put several passengers in at once, each paying a separate fare.\n\nBy rental car\n\n[edit]\n\nAll major US car rental firms are available at the airport, along with several local vendors offering everything from subcompacts to late model Hummers, Range Rovers and Land Cruisers. When renting from local vendors be sure to read the fine print regarding insurance coverage; you might think you're getting a great deal on a car, only to get into an accident and find out that your insurance coverage does not apply or that your deductible is as high as US$5,000.\n\nAdvice to potential renters: Gasoline costs RD$65/liter (Apr 2021) here and people drive fast and furious, breaking every imaginable rule. It might be safer and cheaper to develop a friendship with a cab driver who will gladly become your personal driver, tourguide and concierge for a day rate equal to a fraction of what it would cost you to rent, insure and gas up a rental.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nBus service in Santo Domingo is not very user-friendly and geared more towards locals getting to and from work. It is often impossible to know which bus goes where unless you ask the driver, as neither buses nor routes are clearly marked.\n\nBottom line: inexpensive (US$0.50-1.00 per ride) yet complicated. Avoid unless you are accompanied by a local.\n\nBy public car\n\n[edit]\n\nYou can identify a public car from a regular car because it will have a government seal on the windshield. Public cars usually go up and down a street. You can catch one by standing on the street and signaling if your going up the street or down. Public cars are also safe, except you will probably be riding along with at least 5 other people going the same way you are. Public cars are roughly RD$20-25.\n\nBy collective taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nThese collective taxis or “guaguas\" as they are called by Dominicans, stick to a predetermined route (usually up and down a major avenue), picking up and dropping off passengers along the way - often cramming up to five passengers into a twenty year old Toyota Corolla. Very inexpensive, US$0.50 per trip, yet very uncomfortable. By the way, if you happen to be overweight don't be surprised if the driver charges you for two seats instead of one. Safety can sometimes be a concern, so it is best to take guaguas when traveling with locals.\n\nThey fit 7 people total, the driver, two in front passenger seat, and four in the back seat.\n\nBy Teleférico\n\n[edit]\n\nLike other Latin American cities before it (most notably Medellín) Santo Domingo has an aerial tramway linking some of the poverty stricken outer neighborhoods in the hills to the town center. You're unlikely to have a reason to go where the Teleférico goes, but you might want to take a ride for the novelty value alone. The line has four stops and connects to Metro Line 2 at Eduardo Brito. Prices are the same as for the Metro.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite boasting a rich cultural, architectural and artistic heritage, Santo Domingo has not been exploited for all its tourist potential. You're pretty much on your own to discover this fascinating city. Make the most of your time there.\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Colonial Zone:\n\nIn Plaza de la Cultura:\n\nMuseum of Natural History\n\nParks\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are many parks around the city of Santo Domingo. One of the most popular parks are called Los Miradores, which are located on various sections of the city. These parks are very cozy for a picnic, to bike ride, a quick jog, or a long walk to enjoy nature and relax with friends. They’re quite huge and can be a bit unsafe if wandered during the night, because it lacks street lights. Although Santo Domingo is surrounded by beautiful parks it does lack recreational facilities accessible to the public. Some of the parks that can be found:\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nSanto Domingo is an excellent place to study Spanish off the beaten track and get immersed in the language.\n\nFestivals\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo of the top festivities of the year occur in Santo Domingo. The annual Merengue Festival in the summer and Carnival in the spring.\n\nEach of these is held on the city's main seaside main road, El Malecon, but tend to spill over into hotel ballrooms, beaches, patios and parking lots. This is a great way to immerse yourself in Dominican culture, and meet new interesting people from the city.\n\nThe Merengue Festival takes place between July 26 to 31. The festival is a celebration of Dominican Republic’s main dance, merengue. They invite the top merengue bands to perform free concerts to the crowd. The festival begins with a parade, but later becomes a concert.\n\nThere are art exhibitions, food fairs, and games that occur at the same time. The main activity that is done during the festival is dancing merengue, so be prepared to be spun uncontrollable when you decide to dance with a local.\n\nThe other amazing festival is the Carnival, which takes place during the entire month of February, but reaches its peak on February 27, the Dominican Independence Day. The Carnival also takes place in El Malecon, where masks, which symbolizes spiritual spirits;elaborate costumes,and intriguing dances parade down the streets while entertaining and sometimes scaring the crowd.\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nMost transactions in the Dominican Republic can be paid in cash and credit cards. Visa and MasterCard are widely accepted in most stores and restaurants.\n\nThe official currency of the Dominican Republic is the Dominican peso. However most merchants will accept dollars or euros. If you do choose to purchase goods or services in dollars or euros, be wary of the exchange rate. The official exchange rate in the Dominican Republic is set by the Banco Central de la Republica Dominicana and is updated daily.\n\nForeign currency exchange services are prominently available at major ports of entry or are nearby. Some of the most prominent foreign exchange dealers are:\n\nAgente de Cambio Caribe Express and Agente de Cambio La Nacional Caribe Express offices[dead link] and major banks which include: Banco de Reservas, Scotiabank, Banco Leon, and Banco Popular Dominicano.\n\nColonial Zone\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Colonial Zone offers plenty of shopping opportunities, especially if you are looking for Ambar and Larimar, the traditional stones of the DR. Don't forget to haggle, as all the shop owners adjust their prices for this purpose. You will also find a ton of Haitian art for sale everywhere at great prices. If that's your thing, great, just remember its not Dominican. The main boulevard in the Colonial Zone is El Conde, a pedestrian boulevard lined with all kinds of shops and eateries mostly aimed at the locals. Have fun shopping and people watching here.\n\nIf you are feeling adventurous, have a cab take you to the Mercado Modelo nearby. This indoor labyrinth of shops can be overwhelming for a new tourist but, don't worry, it is safe. Then again, you might feel safer asking the cab driver to escort you through the maze of shops and kiosks offering every imaginable kind of souvenir, jewelry, stone, artwork, etc.\n\nMalls\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you want to experience American-style shopping there are plenty of options but here are the three most popular:\n\nNo haggling at the malls. This is an island where practically everything being sold is imported and taxed at 18% (ITBIS or Value Added Tax).\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nSanto Domingo offers a variety of cuisines from around the world from Chinese, Italian and Mediterranean to Brazilian. You can also find the main fast food franchises like McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Wendy’s, and Taco Bell.\n\nMid-grade and high-end restaurants can be quite costly for Third World standards, a dinner with an entrée, main course, drink and dessert can range from US$15-75 per person, plus 10% mandatory tip plus 16% ITBIS tax. Be careful and ask around as price doesn't always equal quality, especially in tourist areas.\n\nUnless the contrary is specified menu prices don’t include the 10% service charge and 16% sales tax, so real prices are 26% higher than indicated in the menu.\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you want to spend less than US$8 on a decent meal and drink:\n\nVisit a “comedor” or cafeteria.\n\nComedores offer a “Plato del Día” or predetermined meal of the day (usually rice, beans, salad and meat or chicken, and a soda) for US$3–8. Cafeterias and Comedores can be found everywhere around the city but specially around business areas and universities, this is where locals eat so is a great way of getting in touch with the culture. “Mimosa”, located on Padre Billini street in the Colonial Zone, offers a great variety of tasty local food during lunch hours. Another great option is Cafeteria \"El Parque\" which is in front of Eugenio Maria de Hostos Park attached to the \"Clinica Abreu\" one of the country's best and most prestigious clinic, close to the Colonial Zone and the Malecon, great place for breakfast, lunch and an early dinner.\n\nBest sandwiches, juice and shakes in the Caribbean\n\n\"Barra Payán\", 30 de marzo street (five minutes from the Colonial Zone), is open seven days a week, 24 hours a day. A sandwich cafeteria, the place has been a traditional eatery for more than a half century. Buy a sandwich and a delicious squeezed-to-order fruit juice or milkshake for less than US$5.\n\nChinese and \"Pica Pollo\"\n\nAt some point in history Dominicans became quite fond of fried chicken and Chinese food, combining both cuisines into fast food establishments known as \"pica pollos\". These are usually take-out joints run by first or second generation Chinese immigrants, serving up heaping portions of fried rice, plantain slices and tasty (and greasy) fried chicken, along with the usual variety of Chinese comfort food. Very inexpensive. Visit Santo Domingo's China Town, near the Mercado Modelo and not far from the Colonial Zone (Duarte Avenue), a very busy zone where working-class people do a lot of their shopping. If you feel adventurous enough to enter this usually chaotic but very picturesque part of the town it would an experience to remember. Keep in mind, pick-pockets love the crowded streets, watch your belongings closely.\n\nFast food\n\nA McDonald's combo costs around US$5, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Pizza Hut around US$6. There are also several very good local franchises like Pizzarelli where you can have pasta, pizza or a salad for no more than RD$275 (Sept 2017), and others like Pollos Victorina. Also, don't miss some good Dominican \"empanadas\" at De Nosotros Empanadas. You can walk into a McDonald's in Santo Domingo and order a value meal with a Presidente beer instead of a Coke. How cool is that?\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nEl Conuco Very touristy and rather affordable restaurant in Gazcue, where you can enjoy live traditional Dominican dances.\n\nLincoln Road On the Abraham Lincoln avenue.\n\nYokomo The Dominican sushi franchise. Enjoy the most unique and inventive Dominican-fusion sushi, such as sushi with sweet plantains.\n\nFalafel In the colonial zone, a good and affordable Near Eastern restaurant specializing in, as the name suggests it, falafel.\n\nAtras and Cinnamon in Plaza Orleans, two contiguous open-air restaurants. In this plaza you can order from any restaurant while sitting in the courtyard.\n\nBuen Provecho Middle range restaurant serving different types of food, a good place to get the \"Dominican Flag\" of meat with rice and beans.\n\nRed Grill A very trendy grill with several locations in the city. One is located in Plaza Orleans, another one has its own bar on top. Pricier, but not a splurge.\n\nChef Pepper Also very trendy, and it just opened a new branch in Bella Vista. If you're craving a hamburger or a steak and cheese sandwich, this is a good place to go.\n\nL'Osteria A mid-range but very high quality Italian restaurant, facing the national theater.\n\nSapore d'Italia Another mid-range, very good Italian restaurant.\n\nAmerican and international midrange franchises include:\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you have to ask how much, you can't afford these places.

Most bars and clubs must close by law at midnight from Sunday to Thursday and at two in the morning on Friday and Saturday. Therefore, it is not uncommon for people to start partying at 20:00 on the weekends. Happily, the regulation is suspended on holidays and the last two weeks of December for Christmas partying. Usually the clubs located inside major hotels are exempt from this rule, although they aren't usually much fun.\n\nThe Malecon is home to several options as well, depending on what's in style at the time.\n\nCheck out Jet Set on Monday nights for live Merengue and Bachata shows from the most popular top bands.\n\nHead over to the upscale side of Santo Domingo (Naco, Piantini) if that is your scene. There are a ton of options there, including perennial favorites such as Trio Caffe, Praia and Montecristo. Those kind of places can have a rather strict admission policy, you usually have to look white enough and rich enough to be admitted.\n\nIn this upscale area of Santo Domingo, consider:\n\nDock Very trendy bar at the Acropolis Center. Open air, electronic music.\n\nEl Barcito Very nice ambiance, mostly rock music. The owner is always present and very friendly.\n\nLevel 2 On the second flour of the Holiday Inn Hotel. Also check out the rooftop bar and pool!\n\nMaruja New, trendy open air bar, close to La Marrana and Margo\n\nMix Right next to the Mix Restaurant, another popular bar.\n\nPraia The fanciest club, in the Holiday Inn Hotel.\n\nShots Mostly rock music, very young crowd. Ave. Roberto Pastoriza.\n\nPlaza Uris on Ave. Roberto Pastoriza\n\nThis plaza has become one of the capital’s top weekend destinations with five very popular bar/clubs with Zambra- +1 809 683-7373, Shots +1 829-886-1208, and Taboo Bamboo +1 809-227-2727 all in the same plaza. This is a favorite spot for locals and especially visitors because it reminds them of the states. Because of its proximity you can bar hop until you find the one that fits you. Music ranging from rock, hip-hop and Latin. When in the plaza the drink to try is definitely Omega shot. Make sure you have a designated driver or number to a taxi.\n\nIf you are more into the bohemian scene check out the Colonial Zone for great bars and cafes, and for a vibrant gay nightlife scene. Here are some hints:\n\nBio. Modern eclectic music from regueaton to Latin rock, very young clientele. Famous for serving drinks from buckets. Calle Sanchez and Padre Billini\n\nBocanegra The trendiest place in the Colonial Zone\n\nCasa de Teatro Enjoy live jazz and rock concerts, pretty bohemian.\n\nEl Beduino New hookah bar on a rooftop in the Colonial Zone.\n\nEl Sarten this is a vintage Latin bar frequented by a mature crowd of experienced dancers.

Calle Sanchez and Padre Billini\n\nSegafredo. A franchise, lounge music, Italian food and good coffee.\n\nSleep\n\n[edit]\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nMid-Range\n\n[edit]\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Boca Chica Area\n\n[edit]\n\nStay safe\n\n[edit]\n\nPoverty, though not as bad as next door Haiti, is still rampant and it is best you take precautions. Do not flash obvious wealth in poorer or middle class sections of the city (lots of jewelry, expensive camera, big watches, etc.) Keep your bag away from the street when walking as it can be snatched by kids on mopeds and keep a firm grip on it. Keep your passport at your accommodation and in a safe (some maids can steal). If you are Caucasian or Asian (no matter how you are dressed), expect to have a lot of insincerely friendly people on the streets follow you and strike up conversation with you. They are only talking to you in order to get money from you. They inevitably steer the conversation towards money and are looking for handouts or, worse, 'protection money' to protect you from the more undesirable elements of society. Do not engage in a conversation with them in the first place, as they are very persistent and could even follow you until you relent. When walking on the side walk do not stand too close to the street. There are robbers on mo-peds/motorcycles that will pass by and yank your purse from you. Some men and maybe even women carry a gun on them; do not let this alarm you. You will see men in civilian clothes relaxing on their patio or on the streets playing dominoes, with a gun they could be security guards.\n\nWalk confidently. Don't dress like a tourist. Be yourself but if yourself is flashing Gucci and Prada where ever you go, maybe you need to dress down a bit. If you get lost at any time ask a local person walking by for directions. They are always more than happy to help foreigners at everything. Do NOT follow anyone that offers to take you to your destination. They will usually expect some payment for their effort. Even worse, they could be setting you up.\n\nBe careful when trying to get an Uber in a touristic area (such as the Zona Colonial and the Los Tres Ojos entrance). Often you will have people in uniforms, taxi drivers or even the Tourist Police coming to you and forcing you to take local run-down taxi instead. They might even follow you if you refuse. Be aware of your surroundings, do not appear like you are waiting for an Uber (e.g. by standing on the side of the street while checking your phone the whole time), and find a safe place to get an Uber (such as inside a chain restaurant or a supermarket).\n\nDo not drink the tap water. It is not processed to be ingested by people. You can get sick. Bottled water is really cheap and sold every where. Ice is okay.\n\nThe National Police (Policía Nacional) and the Tourist Police (Policía Turística) are in charge of implementing the city safety. The national police station is at Av. Leopoldo Navarro #402, you can also contact +1 809-682-2151 for the central line, but in case of an emergency dial 911.\n\nCope\n\n[edit]\n\nEmbassies & consulates\n\n[edit]"
