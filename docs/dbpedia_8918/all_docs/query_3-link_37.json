        "text": "Located in the Caribbean region, Santo Domingo is the administrative, economic, and political capital of the Dominican Republic. With a population estimated at more than 3.5 million inhabitants, representing one-third of the total country population, and with a projection of 4 million in 2030, Santo Domingo is a dynamic fast-growing city.\n\nThe current system of transportation in the City of Santo Domingo has been mostly the result of a historically unregulated, uneven, and rapid urbanization. The results are vastly different levels of service, socio-economic activities, and quality of life across the cityâ€™s municipalities.\n\nTo tackle these issues, Santo Domingo chose the most ambitious path amongst the scenarios identified for its urban mobility plan, which is largely dedicated to the development of a high capacity public transport offer."
