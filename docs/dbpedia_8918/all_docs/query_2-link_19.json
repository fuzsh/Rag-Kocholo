        "text": "Once ruled by Spain, the Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, a former French colony.\n\nThe Caribbean nation is a major tourist destination. This, coupled with free-trade zones, has become the country's major employer and key sources of revenue, replacing dependence on sugar, coffee and other exports.\n\nThe Dominican Republic is inhabited mostly by people of mixed European and African origins. Western influence is seen in the colonial buildings of the capital, Santo Domingo, as well as in art and literature. African heritage is reflected in music.\n\nLuis Abinader, a US-educated scion of a political dynasty, was re-elected president in May 2024 with 58% of the vote in the first round, without the need for a runoff.\n\nHe was first elected in 2020, and during his first term he oversaw economic growth, largely due to a tourism boom - a record 10 million tourists visited the country in 2023.\n\nPresident Abinader has promised to reform public finances while also maintaining economic growth.\n\nCrisis-hit Haiti, the Dominican Republic's neighbour on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, dominated the election campaign. Abinader has signalled a toughening of relations with Haiti by building a 164km border fence to curb drug-smuggling and migration. He has also suspended visas for Haitians and ignored calls from humanitarian NGOs to build refugee camps.\n\nThere are scores of terrestrial TV channels and hundreds of radio stations, most of them commercial.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a decrease in physical and verbal attacks against journalists, says Reporters Without Borders.\n\nThe media landscape is diverse and reporters regularly reveal scandals involving personalities in power. Citizens have free access to all media\n\nSome key dates in the history of the Dominican Republic:\n\n1492 - Christopher Columbus visits the island, which he names Hispaniola, or \"Little Spain\".\n\n1496 - Spanish set up their first colony in Western hemisphere at Santo Domingo, which subsequently serves as capital of all their colonies in America.\n\n1697 - Treaty of Ryswick - which ends the Nine Years' War (War of the Grand Alliance or War of the League of Augsburg) - gives the western part of Hispaniola to France and the eastern part to Spain.\n\n1795 - Spain cedes its portion of Hispaniola to France.\n\n1808 - Spain retakes Santo Domingo following revolt by Spanish Creoles.\n\n1821 - Uprising against Spanish rule is followed by brief period of independence.\n\n1822 - Haitian President Jean-Pierre Boyer marches his troops into Santo Domingo and annexes it.\n\n1844 - Boyer overthrown; Santo Domingo declares its independence and becomes the Dominican Republic.\n\n1861-64 - President Pedro Santana returns the Dominican Republic to Spanish rule.\n\n1865 - The second Dominican Republic proclaimed.\n\n1906 - Dominican Republic and US sign 50-year treaty under which the US takes over the customs department in return for buying its debts.\n\n1916-24 - US forces occupy the Dominican Republic following internal disorder.\n\n1924 - Constitutional government assumes control; US forces withdraw.\n\n1930-1961 - General Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina establishes personal dictatorship following the overthrow of President Horacio Vazquez. He rules until his assassination in 1961.\n\n1962 - Juan Bosch, founder of the leftist Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) is elected president in the first democratic elections for nearly four decades.\n\n1963 - Bosch deposed in military coup.\n\n1965 - Some 30,000 US troops invade the Dominican Republic following a pro-Bosch uprising.\n\n1966 - Joaquin Balaguer, a Trujillo protÃ©gÃ©, is elected president.\n\n1978 - Silvestre Antonio Guzman is elected president and proceeds to release some 200 political prisoners, ease media censorship and purge the armed forces of Balaguer supporters.\n\n2001 - US jet bound for Santo Domingo crashes in New York killing all 255 people on board.\n\n2005 - Congress approves a proposed free trade agreement with the US and Central American nations. The Dominican Republic enters the accord in 2007.\n\n2018 - Dominican Republic ends its long diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, establishing ties with China instead."
