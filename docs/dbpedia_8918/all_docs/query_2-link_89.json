        "text": "Plaza España is a large square located at the edge of the Colonial city district near the west bank of Ozama River. Here you find the Columbus Citadel, one of the most popular museums in the Colonial City. Completed around 1512, this Gothic and Renaissance style palace was the home of Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus, and his wife María de Toledo, niece of King Ferdinand of Spain.\n\nThe Spanish plaza is frequently used as a venue for events and public gatherings, along the east border there are a number of popular restaurants with outdoor dining. Tour guides can be found around these r\n\nThis is a hotspot in the Santo Domingo location that is packed with history, which is reflected in the architectural sculptures nearby. This old colonial square is located in the center of the colonial city district of Santo Domingo. At the southside of the park is the First Cathedral of the New World — “Basilica Catedral de Santa Maria la Menor” — and at the center stands the statue of Christopher Columbus. Many restaurants and cafés surround the square and to the west lies Conde street. Close to the park you can find the Alcázar de Colón, the Calle Las Damas and many other historical sights.\n\nTake a nature break around ancient Taino caves with beautiful subterranean ponds.\n\nThe 3 Eyes National Park is a stunning must-see place to visit in Santo Domingo. It is a natural underground formation of three lakes within limestone caves. The steps into the caves are carved out of the natural rock. There is a fourth lake, which is not thought of as one of the three eyes, and is accessible by boat across the second lake.\n\nDowntown Santo Domingo raises the bar and nightlife scenes up several notches. This is where you'll want to dress up and sip on cocktails from mixologists, at the most modern lounges and dance clubs. Stopping for a drink, a dance, or a bet is easy along the city’s seafront boulevard — The Malecon. Here, the upscale and laid back hotel bars offer live music on their outdoor or poolside terraces, and dance clubs go on well past midnight.\n\nBuilt in 1942, Santo Domingo’s largest market is one of the city’s first tourist venues. This colorful bazaar adds even more color and culture to the nearby Colonial City, selling literally everything, from the local alcohol-infused delicacy Mama Juana (a drink made of rum, red wine, honey and local herbs that's said to be an aphrodisiac), to love potions to cure a broken heart to fresh vegetables in every color of the rainbow. This is a great place to grab a street food-style breakfast and a strong coffee too.\n\nShop at one of the exclusive modern shopping malls, lined with designer boutiques or at one of the small artisan shops tucked away in side streets of the Colonial City — get a linen chacabana shirt, a leather purse, or a ceramic faceless doll, and if you are looking for amber and larimar, this is the place!."
