        "text": "What's the history of Santo Domingo?\n\nSanto Domingo is the capital city of the Dominican Republic and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the Americas. It was founded in 1496 by Bartholomew Columbus, the brother of Christopher Columbus, and served as the first capital of Spanish America. During the colonial period, Santo Domingo was a hub for trade and a center of the sugar industry, which relied heavily on African slave labor. The city played an important role in the struggle for independence from Spain and was the site of many battles during the 19th century. Today, Santo Domingo is a vibrant city with a rich cultural heritage, including colonial-era architecture, museums, music, and cuisine, as well as modern amenities and a thriving tourism industry.\n\nWhat's a possible itinerary in Santo Domingo?\n\nOf course!
