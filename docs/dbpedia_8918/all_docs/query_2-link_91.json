We’re taking YOU from Punta Cana to this chronicled municipality and its infamous Colonial Zone. Enjoy authentic Dominican cuisine coupled with an authentic full day experience outside the resort.\n\nBook Now No Risk\n\nHotels Clear\n\nSanto Domingo Tour quantity\n\nDiscount:\n\nSpecial offer\n\nDescription\n\nWatch Video\n\nReviews (22)\n\nFAQs\n\nHere’s What You Get\n\nWould you like to walk in the footsteps of Christopher Columbus? Of course you would!\n\nThat’s why we’re inviting you to our exclusive excursion from Punta Cana to Santo Domingo.\n\nWe’re giving YOU the opportunity to experience, first hand, the birth of European civilization in the Americas. The first cathedral, paved road, university, hospital, stone home, tavern, etc are all located within a 16 block radius in Santo Domingo’s Colonial Zone or “Old City”.\n\nOh and did we mention the Colonial Zone is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1992? How many World Heritage Sites have you been to?\n\nThis is how your day shakes down…\n\nFrom Punta Cana you head west through rolling sugar cane fields until we reach the Dominican Republic’s capital city. Now, you’re in the thick of it, witnessing everyday life for millions of Dominicans; your walled off resort is far from this reality.\n\nIn chronological order our highlights include:\n\nVISIT Three Eyes National Park: underground caves and lagoons used by Taino Indians for a millennia until their eventual demise\n\nOBSERVE the Columbus Lighthouse where Christopher Columbus’ remains are entombed\n\nSET FOOT in Diego Columbus’s Palace\n\nSTROLL the first paved road of the New World\n\nENTER the National Pantheon, the final resting place of the country’s most honored citizens\n\nKNEEL in the first cathedral of the New World\n\nINDULGE in authentic Dominican cuisine in an authentic atmosphere\n\nSTAND before the country’s impressive National Palace\n\nTIME to shop or stroll the Colonial City’s continually inhabited streets for half a millennia\n\nAs you can see, most of your day is spent within the fortified, canon laden, walls of the Colonial City. Fortified walls? Yep, because everyone wanted a piece of this gem of the New World to launch their own conquests.\n\nDid you know the conquests of Mexico, Peru and Florida all embarked from Santo Domingo? But they couldn’t hold back the famous pirate Sir Francis Drake who sacked the city in 1586, only to give it back to the Spanish after receiving a hefty ransom in gold.\n\nThat nugget of history was free! But to really unveil Santo Domingo’s infinite past, only a full narrated tour would do the city justice.\n\nPut down your sun tan lotion and put on a hat and comfortable sneakers because it’s time to:\n\nLEARN about the Western Hemisphere’s European birth\n\nEAT real Dominican food where Dominicans go to eat\n\nRETURN home with a genuine understanding of the Dominican Republic’s people and history\n\nOur Santo Domingo excursion is only available two days a week. Space sells out quickly so book now!\n\nMake Christopher Columbus proud that 500+ years later you’re still interested in discovering the city and the New World he conceived in 1492.\n\nWhat’s Included\n\nRound trip transportation\n\nProfessional guide\n\nLunch\n\nWhat to Bring\n\nComfortable Clothing\n\nComfortable shoes\n\nCamera\n\nSunscreen\n\nHat\n\nCash\n\nPlease note that the drive to Santo Domingo is about 3 hours each way. Also, to enter the cathedral women and men must be covered to the elbows and knees. In other words, shoulders and upper thighs should be covered. Most likely you will be picked up at your hotel in a smaller bus and then transferred to a larger bus. The visit to a gift shop in SD is optional. If you do not want to buy anything you can do as you wish but you must notify the guide so he can give you a time to meet.\n\nOnly logged in customers who have purchased this product may leave a review.\n\nIs Santo Domingo good for tourists?\n\nSanto Domingo is a must see for tourists and completely safe! It is the first permanent European settlement in the New World and the old city, locally known as the Colonial Zone, still has numerous standing structures from it's New World beginnings over 500 years ago.\n\nWhat are the best months to visit Santo Domingo?\n\nSanto Domingo can be visited year round. Most of the year the climate is hot and humid but humidity and temperature decrease in the Winter months from December to March making walks around the city more comfortable.\n\nIs it better to go to Santo Domingo or Punta Cana?\n\nThat depends on what you're looking for! If you want all inclusive resorts with sun and sand visit Punta Cana. If you want a quintessential Caribbean city with narrow streets, colonial roots and more contact with the Dominican culture, visit Santo Domingo. But why not both! Santo Domingo and Punta Cana are connected by a brand new modern highway. It's a 2 hour drive and many tourists stay in Punta Cana but do a day trip or overnight trip to Santo Domingo.\n\nHow many days should I spend in Santo Domingo?\n\nSanto Domingo's main tourist draw, the Old City or Colonial City, can be seen in a day or an overnight trip to see a bit more. The Colonial city is about 16 square blocks but there's plenty of shop, museums, restaurants and bars to be experienced!\n\nIs it expensive in Santo Domingo?\n\nFor a tourists needs, no Santo Domingo is not particularly expensive. You'll most likely find that food, alcohol and lodging is less expensive than in North America and Europe.\n\nIs it worth going to Dominican Republic for a week?\n\nOf course it is! The Dominican Republic is currently the most visited country in the Caribbean, with Punta Cana as it's leading destination. Punta Cana's 50+ all-inclusive resorts have something for everyone whether you're looking for family friendly, adult only, intimate resort or mega resort. The area's beaches are world renowned and the local people are its biggest asset.\n\nWhat months are hot in Santo Domingo?\n\nAlthough warm all year round, the hottest months in Santo Domingo are the summer months, namely, May, June, July, August and September. April and October can be rather warm as well but temperature and humidity subside from November to March.\n\nWhat is the rainiest month in Santo Domingo?\n\nThere really isn't a dedicated rainy season in Santo Domingo or the rest of the Dominican Republic. You'll find the eternal weather forecast is warm, partly sunny with a chance of passing showers. This forecast is so common that most Dominicans never check the weather forecast.\n\nIs it worth going to Santo Domingo for a day?\n\nIf you're looking for history and culture, Santo Domingo is by far the best day excursion from Punta Cana. Santo Domingo's old city or Colonial Zone was the first permanent European settlement and is home to many firsts in the New World. Also, the Colonial Zone is where many local Dominicans live so it's an amazing opportunity to see and experience local life.\n\nCustomers Also Bought\n\nAll Excursions\n\nSafari Adventure\n\nRated 4.78 out of 5\n\n$105.00 Original price was: $105.00.$95.00Current price is: $95.00.
