        "text": "Transcript\n\n[Music in]\n\nNARRATOR: The Carib Indians relied on the sea and the gifts of the land to support their small populations.\n\nLiving in harmony with their world, the Indians prospered until the fateful day five hundred years ago, when the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus arrived with his Spanish galleons.\n\nFrom that day in 1492, when Columbus sighted the islands now known as Cuba and Hispaniola, the Caribbean and its peoples would never again be the same.\n\nWith the Indians enslaved to the Spanish crown, the conquerors ruled with an iron hand.\n\nToday, the legacy of Columbus dominates the Caribbean, and crumbling relics of the Spanish rule obscure all traces of the life that graced these islands before the coming of the Europeans.\n\nFor four hundred years cannon power ruled the islands, guarding prized colonial possessions from rival European powers.\n\nBut the conquest left a more enduring legacy, a legacy of European culture and of faith.\n\nAlong with Christianity, the conquerors of the Caribbean introduced the rigid laws and values of the world from which they came.\n\nFrom India, the enterprising settlers brought Brahma cattle to feed and fatten on the islands' grassy meadows, while from Europe they brought goats to graze on what was left.\n\nBananas and coconuts were brought to the islands from Africa, foreign crops which, like the pineapple from South America, were planted to provide for the growing markets of Europe.\n\nBut to work the new plantations would require an army of human hands.\n\nBrought in bondage from Africa, black slaves were made to tend the fields and to do all the work which the Europeans considered menial.\n\nWhile the cargo of human slaves flowed from Africa to the Caribbean, the cargo of sugar, rice, coffee, cotton, and fruit flowed in an endless stream to the capitals of the colonial nations, firmly establishing the Caribbean as the tropical breadbasket of Europe.\n\n[Music out]"
