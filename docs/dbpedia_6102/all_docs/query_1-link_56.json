        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe oldest of the doctrinal standards of the Christian Reformed Church and the Reformed Church in America is the Confession of Faith, popularly known as the Belgic Confession, following the seventeenth-century Latin designation “Confessio Belgica.” “Belgica” referred to the whole of the Netherlands, both north and south, which today is divided into the Netherlands and Belgium. The confession’s chief author was Guido de Brès, a preacher of the Reformed churches of the Netherlands, who died a martyr to the faith in the year 1567. During the sixteenth century the churches in this country were exposed to terrible persecution by the Roman Catholic government. To protest against this cruel oppression, and to prove to the persecutors that the adherents of the Reformed faith were not rebels, as was laid to their charge, but law-abiding citizens who professed the true Christian doctrine according to the Holy Scriptures, de Brès prepared this confession in the year 1561. In the following year a copy was sent to King Philip II, together with an address in which the petitioners declared that they were ready to obey the government in all lawful things, but that they would “offer their backs to stripes, their tongues to knives, their mouths to gags, and their whole bodies to the fire,” rather than deny the truth expressed in this confession.\n\nAlthough the immediate purpose of securing freedom from persecution was not attained, and de Brès himself fell as one of the many thousands who sealed their faith with their lives, his work has endured and will continue to endure. In its composition the author availed himself to some extent of a confession of the Reformed churches in France, written chiefly by John Calvin, published two years earlier. The work of de Brès, however, is not a mere revision of Calvin’s work, but an independent composition. In 1566 the text of this confession was revised at a synod held at Antwerp. In the Netherlands it was at once gladly received by the churches, and it was adopted by national synods held during the last three decades of the sixteenth century. The text, not the contents, was revised again at the Synod of Dort in 1618-19 and adopted as one of the doctrinal standards to which all officebearers in the Reformed churches were required to subscribe. The confession is recognized as one of the best official summaries of Reformed doctrine.\n\nThe text of Article 36 is presented in two forms in this edition because the Christian Reformed Church in 1938 and 1985 decided to revise it from the original text in order to set forth what it judged to be a more biblical statement on the relationship between church and state, and to eliminate language that denounced “Anabaptists, other anarchists . . .” and so on. The Reformed Church in America has not made any amendments to the Belgic Confession. However, when the Reformed Church in America adopted the Belgic Confession in 1792 as one of the three confessional Standards of Unity, it also adopted the Explanatory Articles that reconciled the statements in the three standards and the Church Order of Dort with the situation in which it existed in the newly independent United States of America. With regard to Article 36 dealing with the relation of church and state, it stated that “whatever relates to the immediate authority and interposition of the Magistrate in the government of the Church, and which is introduced more or less into all the national establishments in Europe, is entirely omitted in the constitution now published.” With regard to the harsh words about Anabaptists and others in Article 36, the RCA stated that “in publishing the Articles of Faith, the Church determined to abide by the words adopted in the Synod of Dordrecht, as most expressive of what she believes to be truth; in consequence of which, the terms alluded to could not be avoided. But she openly and candidly declares that she by no means thereby intended to refer to any denomination of Christians at present known, and would be grieved at giving offence, or unnecessarily hurting the feelings of any person.”\n\nArticle 1: The Only God\n\nWe all believe in our hearts\n\nand confess with our mouths\n\nthat there is a single\n\nand simple\n\nspiritual being,\n\nwhom we call God—\n\neternal,\n\nincomprehensible,\n\ninvisible,\n\nunchangeable,\n\ninfinite,\n\nalmighty;\n\ncompletely wise,\n\njust,\n\nand good,\n\nand the overflowing source\n\nof all good.\n\nArticle 2: The Means by Which We Know God\n\nWe know God by two means:\n\nFirst, by the creation, preservation, and government\n\nof the universe,\n\nsince that universe is before our eyes\n\nlike a beautiful book\n\nin which all creatures,\n\ngreat and small,\n\nare as letters\n\nto make us ponder\n\nthe invisible things of God:\n\nGod’s eternal power and divinity,\n\nas the apostle Paul says in Romans 1:20.\n\nAll these things are enough to convict humans\n\nand to leave them without excuse.\n\nSecond, God makes himself known to us more clearly\n\nby his holy and divine Word,\n\nas much as we need in this life,\n\nfor God’s glory\n\nand for our salvation.\n\nArticle 3: The Written Word of God\n\nWe confess that this Word of God\n\nwas not sent nor delivered “by human will,”\n\nbut that “men and women moved by the Holy Spirit\n\nspoke from God,”\n\nas Peter says.1\n\nAfterward our God—\n\nwith special care\n\nfor us and our salvation—\n\ncommanded his servants, the prophets and apostles,\n\nto commit this revealed Word to writing.\n\nGod, with his own finger,\n\nwrote the two tables of the law.\n\nTherefore we call such writings\n\nholy and divine Scriptures.\n\n12 Pet. 1:21\n\nArticle 4: The Canonical Books\n\nWe include in the Holy Scripture the two volumes\n\nof the Old and New Testaments.\n\nThey are canonical books\n\nwith which there can be no quarrel at all.\n\nIn the church of God the list is as follows:\n\nIn the Old Testament,\n\nthe five books of Moses—\n\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy;\n\nthe books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth;\n\nthe two books of Samuel, and two of Kings;\n\nthe two books of Chronicles, called Paralipomenon;\n\nthe first book of Ezra; Nehemiah, Esther, Job;\n\nthe Psalms of David;\n\nthe three books of Solomon—\n\nProverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song;\n\nthe four major prophets—\n\nIsaiah, Jeremiah*, Ezekiel, Daniel;\n\nand then the other twelve minor prophets—\n\nHosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah,\n\nJonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk,\n\nZephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi.\n\nIn the New Testament,\n\nthe four gospels—\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John;\n\nthe Acts of the Apostles;\n\nthe fourteen letters of Paul—\n\nto the Romans;\n\nthe two letters to the Corinthians;\n\nto the Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians;\n\nthe two letters to the Thessalonians;\n\nthe two letters to Timothy;\n\nto Titus, Philemon, and to the Hebrews;\n\nthe seven letters of the other apostles—\n\none of James;\n\ntwo of Peter;\n\nthree of John;\n\none of Jude;\n\nand the Revelation of the apostle John.\n\n* “Jeremiah” here includes the Book of Lamentations as well as the Book of Jeremiah.\n\nArticle 5: The Authority of Scripture\n\nWe receive all these books\n\nand these only\n\nas holy and canonical,\n\nfor the regulating, founding, and establishing\n\nof our faith.\n\nAnd we believe\n\nwithout a doubt\n\nall things contained in them—\n\nnot so much because the church\n\nreceives and approves them as such\n\nbut above all because the Holy Spirit\n\ntestifies in our hearts\n\nthat they are from God,\n\nand also because they\n\nprove themselves\n\nto be from God.\n\nFor even the blind themselves are able to see\n\nthat the things predicted in them\n\ndo happen.\n\nArticle 6: The Difference Between Canonical and Apocryphal Books\n\nWe distinguish between these holy books\n\nand the apocryphal ones,\n\nwhich are the third and fourth books of Esdras;\n\nthe books of Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Jesus Sirach, Baruch;\n\nwhat was added to the Story of Esther;\n\nthe Song of the Three Children in the Furnace;\n\nthe Story of Susannah;\n\nthe Story of Bel and the Dragon;\n\nthe Prayer of Manasseh;\n\nand the two books of Maccabees.\n\nThe church may certainly read these books\n\nand learn from them\n\nas far as they agree with the canonical books.\n\nBut they do not have such power and virtue\n\nthat one could confirm\n\nfrom their testimony\n\nany point of faith or of the Christian religion.\n\nMuch less can they detract\n\nfrom the authority\n\nof the other holy books.\n\nArticle 7: The Sufficiency of Scripture\n\nWe believe\n\nthat this Holy Scripture contains\n\nthe will of God completely\n\nand that everything one must believe\n\nto be saved\n\nis sufficiently taught in it.\n\nFor since the entire manner of service\n\nwhich God requires of us\n\nis described in it at great length,\n\nno one—\n\neven an apostle\n\nor an angel from heaven,\n\nas Paul says—2\n\nought to teach other than\n\nwhat the Holy Scriptures have\n\nalready taught us.\n\nFor since it is forbidden\n\nto add to the Word of God,\n\nor take anything away from it,3\n\nit is plainly demonstrated\n\nthat the teaching is perfect\n\nand complete in all respects.\n\nTherefore we must not consider human writings—\n\nno matter how holy their authors may have been—\n\nequal to the divine writings;\n\nnor may we put custom,\n\nnor the majority,\n\nnor age,\n\nnor the passage of times or persons,\n\nnor councils, decrees, or official decisions\n\nabove the truth of God,\n\nfor truth is above everything else.\n\nFor all human beings are liars by nature\n\nand more vain than vanity itself.\n\nTherefore we reject with all our hearts\n\neverything that does not agree\n\nwith this infallible rule,\n\nas we are taught to do by the apostles\n\nwhen they say,\n\n“Test the spirits\n\nto see whether they are from God,”4\n\nand also,\n\n“Do not receive into the house\n\nor welcome anyone\n\nwho comes to you\n\nand does not bring this teaching.”5\n\n2Gal. 1:8\n\n3Deut. 12:32; Rev. 22:18-19\n\n41 John 4:1\n\n52 John 10\n\nArticle 8: The Trinity\n\nIn keeping with this truth and Word of God\n\nwe believe in one God,\n\nwho is one single essence,\n\nin whom there are three persons,\n\nreally, truly, and eternally distinct\n\naccording to their incommunicable properties—\n\nnamely,\n\nFather,\n\nSon,\n\nand Holy Spirit.\n\nThe Father\n\nis the cause,\n\norigin,\n\nand source of all things,\n\nvisible as well as invisible.\n\nThe Son\n\nis the Word,\n\nthe Wisdom,\n\nand the image\n\nof the Father.\n\nThe Holy Spirit\n\nis the eternal power\n\nand might,\n\nproceeding from the Father and the Son.\n\nNevertheless,\n\nthis distinction does not divide God into three,\n\nsince Scripture teaches us\n\nthat the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\n\neach has a distinct subsistence\n\ndistinguished by characteristics—\n\nyet in such a way\n\nthat these three persons are\n\nonly one God.\n\nIt is evident then\n\nthat the Father is not the Son\n\nand that the Son is not the Father,\n\nand that likewise the Holy Spirit is\n\nneither the Father nor the Son.\n\nNevertheless,\n\nthese persons,\n\nthus distinct,\n\nare neither divided\n\nnor fused or mixed together.\n\nFor the Father did not take on flesh,\n\nnor did the Spirit,\n\nbut only the Son.\n\nThe Father was never\n\nwithout the Son,\n\nnor without the Holy Spirit,\n\nsince all these are equal from eternity,\n\nin one and the same essence.\n\nThere is neither a first nor a last,\n\nfor all three are one\n\nin truth and power,\n\nin goodness and mercy.\n\nArticle 9: The Scriptural Witness on the Trinity\n\nAll these things we know\n\nfrom the testimonies of Holy Scripture\n\nas well as from the effects of the persons,\n\nespecially from those we feel within ourselves.\n\nThe testimonies of the Holy Scriptures,\n\nwhich teach us to believe in this Holy Trinity,\n\nare written in many places of the Old Testament,\n\nwhich need not be enumerated\n\nbut only chosen with discretion.\n\nIn the book of Genesis God says,\n\n“Let us make humankind in our image,\n\naccording to our likeness.”\n\nSo “God created humankind in his image”—\n\nindeed, “male and female he created them.”6\n\n“See, the man has become like one of us.”7\n\nIt appears from this\n\nthat there is a plurality of persons\n\nwithin the Deity,\n\nwhen God says,\n\n“Let us make humankind in our image”—\n\nand afterward God indicates the unity\n\nin saying,\n\n“God created.”\n\nIt is true that God does not say here\n\nhow many persons there are—\n\nbut what is somewhat obscure to us\n\nin the Old Testament\n\nis very clear in the New.\n\nFor when our Lord was baptized in the Jordan,\n\nthe voice of the Father was heard saying,\n\n“This is my Son, the Beloved;”8\n\nthe Son was seen in the water;\n\nand the Holy Spirit appeared in the form of a dove.\n\nSo, in the baptism of all believers\n\nthis form was prescribed by Christ:\n\nBaptize all people “in the name\n\nof the Father\n\nand of the Son\n\nand of the Holy Spirit.”9\n\nIn the Gospel according to Luke\n\nthe angel Gabriel says to Mary,\n\nthe mother of our Lord:\n\n“The Holy Spirit will come upon you,\n\nand the power of the Most High will overshadow you;\n\ntherefore the child to be born will be holy;\n\nhe will be called Son of God.”10\n\nAnd in another place it says:\n\n“The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,\n\nthe love of God,\n\nand the communion of the Holy Spirit\n\nbe with all of you.”11\n\n[“There are three that testify in heaven,\n\nthe Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit,\n\nand these three are one.”]12\n\nIn all these passages we are fully taught\n\nthat there are three persons\n\nin the one and only divine essence.\n\nAnd although this doctrine surpasses human understanding,\n\nwe nevertheless believe it now,\n\nthrough the Word,\n\nwaiting to know and enjoy it fully\n\nin heaven.\n\nFurthermore,\n\nwe must note the particular works and activities\n\nof these three persons in relation to us.\n\nThe Father is called our Creator,\n\nby reason of his power.\n\nThe Son is our Savior and Redeemer,\n\nby his blood.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is our Sanctifier,\n\nby living in our hearts.\n\nThis doctrine of the holy Trinity\n\nhas always been maintained in the true church,\n\nfrom the time of the apostles until the present,\n\nagainst Jews, Muslims,\n\nand certain false Christians and heretics,\n\nsuch as Marcion, Mani,\n\nPraxeas, Sabellius, Paul of Samosata, Arius,\n\nand others like them,\n\nwho were rightly condemned by the holy fathers.\n\nAnd so,\n\nin this matter we willingly accept\n\nthe three ecumenical creeds—\n\nthe Apostles’, Nicene, and Athanasian—\n\nas well as what the ancient fathers decided\n\nin agreement with them.\n\n6Gen. 1:26-27\n\n7Gen. 3:22\n\n8Matt. 3:17\n\n9Matt. 28:19\n\n10Luke 1:35\n\n112 Cor. 13:14\n\n121 John 5:7—following the better Greek texts, the NRSV and other modern translations place this verse in a footnote.\n\nArticle 10: The Deity of Christ\n\nWe believe that Jesus Christ,\n\naccording to his divine nature,\n\nis the only Son of God—\n\neternally begotten,\n\nnot made or created,\n\nfor then he would be a creature.\n\nHe is one in essence with the Father;\n\ncoeternal;\n\nthe exact image of the person of the Father\n\nand the “reflection of God’s glory,”13\n\nbeing like the Father in all things.\n\nJesus Christ is the Son of God\n\nnot only from the time he assumed our nature\n\nbut from all eternity,\n\nas the following testimonies teach us\n\nwhen they are taken together.\n\nMoses says that God created the world;14\n\nand John says that all things were created through the Word,15\n\nwhich he calls God.\n\nThe apostle says that God created the world through the Son.16\n\nHe also says that God created all things through Jesus Christ.17\n\nAnd so it must follow\n\nthat the one who is called God, the Word, the Son, and Jesus Christ\n\nalready existed before creating all things.\n\nTherefore the prophet Micah says\n\nthat Christ’s origin is “from ancient days.”18\n\nAnd the apostle says\n\nthat the Son has “neither beginning of days\n\nnor end of life.”19\n\nSo then,\n\nhe is the true eternal God,\n\nthe Almighty,\n\nwhom we invoke,\n\nworship,\n\nand serve.\n\n13Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3\n\n14Gen. 1:1\n\n15John 1:3\n\n16Heb. 1:2\n\n17Col. 1:16\n\n18Mic. 5:2\n\n19Heb. 7:3\n\nArticle 11: The Deity of the Holy Spirit\n\nWe believe and confess also\n\nthat the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally\n\nfrom the Father and the Son—\n\nneither made,\n\nnor created,\n\nnor begotten,\n\nbut only proceeding\n\nfrom the two of them.\n\nIn regard to order,\n\nthe Spirit is the third person of the Trinity—\n\nof one and the same essence,\n\nand majesty,\n\nand glory,\n\nwith the Father and the Son,\n\nbeing true and eternal God,\n\nas the Holy Scriptures teach us.\n\nArticle 12: The Creation of All Things\n\nWe believe that the Father,\n\nwhen it seemed good to him,\n\ncreated heaven and earth and all other creatures\n\nfrom nothing,\n\nby the Word—\n\nthat is to say,\n\nby the Son.\n\nGod has given all creatures\n\ntheir being, form, and appearance\n\nand their various functions\n\nfor serving their Creator.\n\nEven now\n\nGod also sustains and governs them all,\n\naccording to his eternal providence\n\nand by his infinite power,\n\nthat they may serve humanity,\n\nin order that humanity may serve God.\n\nGod has also created the angels good,\n\nthat they might be messengers of God\n\nand serve the elect.\n\nSome of them have fallen\n\nfrom the excellence in which God created them\n\ninto eternal perdition;\n\nand the others have persisted and remained\n\nin their original state,\n\nby the grace of God.\n\nThe devils and evil spirits are so corrupt\n\nthat they are enemies of God\n\nand of everything good.\n\nThey lie in wait for the church\n\nand every member of it\n\nlike thieves,\n\nwith all their power,\n\nto destroy and spoil everything\n\nby their deceptions.\n\nSo then,\n\nby their own wickedness\n\nthey are condemned to everlasting damnation,\n\ndaily awaiting their torments.\n\nFor that reason\n\nwe detest the error of the Sadducees,\n\nwho deny that there are spirits and angels,\n\nand also the error of the Manicheans,\n\nwho say that the devils originated by themselves,\n\nbeing evil by nature,\n\nwithout having been corrupted.\n\nArticle 13: The Doctrine of God's Providence\n\nWe believe that this good God,\n\nafter creating all things,\n\ndid not abandon them to chance or fortune\n\nbut leads and governs them\n\naccording to his holy will,\n\nin such a way that nothing happens in this world\n\nwithout God’s orderly arrangement.\n\nYet God is not the author of,\n\nand cannot be charged with,\n\nthe sin that occurs.\n\nFor God’s power and goodness\n\nare so great and incomprehensible\n\nthat God arranges and does his works very well and justly\n\neven when the devils and the wicked act unjustly.\n\nWe do not wish to inquire\n\nwith undue curiosity\n\ninto what God does that surpasses human understanding\n\nand is beyond our ability to comprehend.\n\nBut in all humility and reverence\n\nwe adore the just judgments of God,\n\nwhich are hidden from us,\n\nbeing content to be Christ’s disciples,\n\nso as to learn only what God shows us in the Word,\n\nwithout going beyond those limits.\n\nThis doctrine gives us unspeakable comfort\n\nsince it teaches us\n\nthat nothing can happen to us by chance\n\nbut only by the arrangement of our gracious\n\nheavenly Father,\n\nwho watches over us with fatherly care,\n\nsustaining all creatures under his lordship,\n\nso that not one of the hairs on our heads\n\n(for they are all numbered)\n\nnor even a little bird\n\ncan fall to the ground\n\nwithout the will of our Father.20\n\nIn this thought we rest,\n\nknowing that God holds in check\n\nthe devils and all our enemies,\n\nwho cannot hurt us\n\nwithout divine permission and will.\n\nFor that reason we reject\n\nthe damnable error of the Epicureans,\n\nwho say that God does not get involved in anything\n\nand leaves everything to chance.\n\n20Matt. 10:29-30\n\nArticle 14: The Creation and Fall of Humanity\n\nWe believe\n\nthat God created human beings from the dust of the earth\n\nand made and formed them in his image and likeness—\n\ngood, just, and holy;\n\nable by their will to conform\n\nin all things\n\nto the will of God.\n\nBut when they were in honor\n\nthey did not understand it21\n\nand did not recognize their excellence.\n\nBut they subjected themselves willingly to sin\n\nand consequently to death and the curse,\n\nlending their ear to the word of the devil.\n\nFor they transgressed the commandment of life,\n\nwhich they had received,\n\nand by their sin they separated themselves from God,\n\nwho was their true life,\n\nhaving corrupted their entire nature.\n\nSo they made themselves guilty\n\nand subject to physical and spiritual death,\n\nhaving become wicked,\n\nperverse,\n\nand corrupt in all their ways.\n\nThey lost all their excellent gifts\n\nwhich they had received from God,\n\nand retained none of them\n\nexcept for small traces\n\nwhich are enough to make them\n\ninexcusable.\n\nMoreover, all the light in us is turned to darkness,\n\nas the Scripture teaches us:\n\n“The light shines in the darkness,\n\nand the darkness did not overcome it.”22\n\nHere John calls the human race “darkness.”\n\nTherefore we reject everything taught to the contrary\n\nconcerning human free will,\n\nsince humans are nothing but the slaves of sin\n\nand cannot do a thing\n\nunless it is given them from heaven.23\n\nFor who can boast of being able\n\nto do anything good by oneself,\n\nsince Christ says,\n\n“No one can come to me\n\nunless drawn by the Father who sent me”?24\n\nWho can glory in their own will\n\nwhen they understand that “the mind that is set on the flesh\n\nis hostile to God”?25\n\nWho can speak of their own knowledge\n\nin view of the fact that “those who are unspiritual\n\ndo not receive the gifts of God’s Spirit”?26\n\nIn short,\n\nwho can produce a single thought,\n\nknowing that we are not able to think a thing\n\nabout ourselves,\n\nby ourselves,\n\nbut that “our competence is from God”?27\n\nAnd therefore,\n\nwhat the apostle says\n\nought rightly to stand fixed and firm:\n\nGod works within us\n\nboth to will and to do\n\naccording to his good pleasure.28\n\nFor there is no understanding nor will\n\nconforming to God’s understanding and will\n\napart from Christ’s involvement,\n\nas he teaches us when he says,\n\n“Apart from me you can do nothing.”29\n\n21Ps. 49:20\n\n22John 1:5\n\n23John 3:27\n\n24John 6:44\n\n25Rom. 8:7\n\n261 Cor. 2:14\n\n272 Cor. 3:5\n\n28Phil. 2:13\n\n29John 15:5\n\nArticle 15: The Doctrine of Original Sin\n\nWe believe\n\nthat by the disobedience of Adam\n\noriginal sin has been spread\n\nthrough the whole human race.30\n\nIt is a corruption of the whole human nature—\n\nan inherited depravity which even infects small infants\n\nin their mother’s womb,\n\nand the root which produces in humanity\n\nevery sort of sin.\n\nIt is therefore so vile and enormous in God’s sight\n\nthat it is enough to condemn the human race,\n\nand it is not abolished\n\nor wholly uprooted\n\neven by baptism,\n\nseeing that sin constantly boils forth\n\nas though from a contaminated spring.\n\nNevertheless,\n\nit is not imputed to God’s children\n\nfor their condemnation\n\nbut is forgiven\n\nby his grace and mercy—\n\nnot to put them to sleep\n\nbut so that the awareness of this corruption\n\nmight often make believers groan\n\nas they long to be set free\n\nfrom the body of this death.31\n\nTherefore we reject the error of the Pelagians\n\nwho say that this sin is nothing else than a matter of imitation.\n\n30Rom. 5:12-13\n\n31Rom. 7:24\n\nArticle 16: The Doctrine of Election\n\nWe believe that—\n\nall Adam’s descendants having thus fallen\n\ninto perdition and ruin\n\nby the sin of Adam—\n\nGod showed himself to be as he is:\n\nmerciful and just.\n\nGod is merciful\n\nin withdrawing and saving from this perdition those who,\n\nin the eternal and unchangeable divine counsel,\n\nhave been elected and chosen in Jesus Christ our Lord\n\nby his pure goodness,\n\nwithout any consideration of their works.\n\nGod is just\n\nin leaving the others in their ruin and fall\n\ninto which they plunged themselves.\n\nArticle 17: The Recovery of Fallen Humanity\n\nWe believe that our good God,\n\nby marvelous divine wisdom and goodness,\n\nseeing that Adam and Eve had plunged themselves in this manner\n\ninto both physical and spiritual death\n\nand made themselves completely miserable,\n\nset out to find them,\n\nthough they,\n\ntrembling all over,\n\nwere fleeing from God.\n\nAnd God comforted them,\n\npromising to give them his Son,\n\nborn of a woman,32\n\nto crush the head of the serpent,33\n\nand to make them blessed.\n\n32Gal. 4:4\n\n33Gen. 3:15\n\nArticle 18: The Incarnation\n\nSo then we confess\n\nthat God fulfilled the promise\n\nmade to the early fathers and mothers\n\nby the mouth of the holy prophets\n\nwhen he sent the only and eternal Son of God\n\ninto the world\n\nat the time appointed.\n\nThe Son took the “form of a slave”\n\nand was made in “human form,”34\n\ntruly assuming a real human nature,\n\nwith all its weaknesses,\n\nexcept for sin;\n\nbeing conceived in the womb of the blessed virgin Mary\n\nby the power of the Holy Spirit,\n\nwithout male participation.\n\nAnd Christ not only assumed human nature\n\nas far as the body is concerned\n\nbut also a real human soul,\n\nin order to be a real human being.\n\nFor since the soul had been lost as well as the body,\n\nChrist had to assume them both\n\nto save them both together.\n\nTherefore we confess\n\n(against the heresy of the Anabaptists\n\nwho deny that Christ assumed\n\nhuman flesh from his mother)\n\nthat Christ shared the very flesh and blood of children;35\n\nbeing the fruit of the loins of David according to the flesh,36\n\ndescended from David according to the flesh;37\n\nthe fruit of the womb of the virgin Mary;38\n\nborn of a woman;39\n\nthe seed of David;40\n\nthe root of Jesse;41\n\ndescended from Judah,42\n\nhaving descended from the Jews according to the flesh;\n\ndescended from Abraham—\n\nhaving assumed descent from Abraham and Sarah,\n\nand was made like his brothers and sisters,\n\nyet without sin.43\n\nIn this way Christ is truly our Immanuel—\n\nthat is: “God with us.”44\n\n34Phil. 2:7\n\n35Heb. 2:14\n\n36Acts 2:30\n\n37Rom. 1:3\n\n38Luke 1:42\n\n39Gal. 4:4\n\n402 Tim. 2:8\n\n41Rom. 15:12\n\n42Heb. 7:14\n\n43Heb. 2:17; 4:15\n\n44Matt. 1:23\n\nArticle 19: The Two Natures of Christ\n\nWe believe that by being thus conceived\n\nthe person of the Son has been inseparably united\n\nand joined together\n\nwith human nature,\n\nin such a way that there are not two Sons of God,\n\nnor two persons,\n\nbut two natures united in a single person,\n\nwith each nature retaining its own distinct properties.\n\nThus his divine nature has always remained uncreated,\n\nwithout beginning of days or end of life,45\n\nfilling heaven and earth.\n\nChrist’s human nature has not lost its properties\n\nbut continues to have those of a creature—\n\nit has a beginning of days;\n\nit is of a finite nature\n\nand retains all that belongs to a real body.\n\nAnd even though he,\n\nby his resurrection,\n\ngave it immortality,\n\nthat nonetheless did not change\n\nthe reality of his human nature;\n\nfor our salvation and resurrection\n\ndepend also on the reality of his body.\n\nBut these two natures\n\nare so united together in one person\n\nthat they are not even separated by his death.\n\nSo then,\n\nwhat he committed to his Father when he died\n\nwas a real human spirit which left his body.\n\nBut meanwhile his divine nature remained\n\nunited with his human nature\n\neven when he was lying in the grave;\n\nand his deity never ceased to be in him,\n\njust as it was in him when he was a little child,\n\nthough for a while it did not so reveal itself.\n\nThese are the reasons why we confess him\n\nto be true God and truly human—\n\ntrue God in order to conquer death\n\nby his power,\n\nand truly human that he might die for us\n\nin the weakness of his flesh.\n\n45Heb. 7:3\n\nArticle 20: The Justice and Mercy of God in Christ\n\nWe believe that God—\n\nwho is perfectly merciful\n\nand also very just—\n\nsent the Son to assume the nature\n\nin which the disobedience had been committed,\n\nin order to bear in it the punishment of sin\n\nby his most bitter passion and death.\n\nSo God made known his justice toward his Son,\n\nwho was charged with our sin,\n\nand he poured out his goodness and mercy on us,\n\nwho are guilty and worthy of damnation,\n\ngiving to us his Son to die,\n\nby a most perfect love,\n\nand raising him to life\n\nfor our justification,\n\nin order that by him\n\nwe might have immortality\n\nand eternal life.\n\nArticle 21: The Atonement\n\nWe believe\n\nthat Jesus Christ is a high priest forever\n\naccording to the order of Melchizedek—\n\nmade such by an oath—\n\nand that he presented himself\n\nin our name\n\nbefore his Father,\n\nto appease his Father’s wrath\n\nwith full satisfaction\n\nby offering himself\n\non the tree of the cross\n\nand pouring out his precious blood\n\nfor the cleansing of our sins,\n\nas the prophets had predicted.\n\nFor it is written\n\nthat “the punishment that made us whole”\n\nwas placed on the Son of God\n\nand that “by his bruises we are healed.”\n\nHe was “like a lamb that is led to the slaughter”;\n\nhe was “numbered with the transgressors”46\n\nand condemned as a criminal by Pontius Pilate,\n\nthough Pilate had declared\n\nthat he was innocent.\n\nSo he paid back\n\nwhat he had not stolen,47\n\nand he suffered—\n\n“the righteous for the unrighteous,”48\n\nin both his body and his soul—\n\nin such a way that\n\nwhen he sensed the horrible punishment\n\nrequired by our sins\n\n“his sweat became like great drops of blood\n\nfalling down on the ground.”49\n\nHe cried, “My God, my God,\n\nwhy have you forsaken me?”50\n\nAnd he endured all this\n\nfor the forgiveness of our sins.\n\nTherefore we rightly say with Paul that\n\nwe know nothing “except Jesus Christ, and him crucified”;51\n\nwe “regard everything as loss\n\nbecause of the surpassing value\n\nof knowing Christ Jesus [our] Lord.”52\n\nWe find all comforts in his wounds\n\nand have no need to seek or invent any other means\n\nto reconcile ourselves with God\n\nthan this one and only sacrifice,\n\nonce made,\n\nwhich renders believers perfect\n\nforever.\n\nThis is also why\n\nthe angel of God called him Jesus—\n\nthat is, “Savior”—\n\nbecause he would save his people\n\nfrom their sins.53\n\n46Isa. 53:4-12\n\n47Ps. 69:4\n\n481 Pet. 3:18\n\n49Luke 22:44\n\n50Matt. 27:46\n\n511 Cor. 2:2\n\n52Phil. 3:8\n\n53Matt. 1:21\n\nArticle 22: The Righteousness of Faith\n\nWe believe that\n\nfor us to acquire the true knowledge of this great mystery\n\nthe Holy Spirit kindles in our hearts a true faith\n\nthat embraces Jesus Christ,\n\nwith all his merits,\n\nand makes him its own,\n\nand no longer looks for anything\n\napart from him.\n\nFor it must necessarily follow\n\nthat either all that is required for our salvation\n\nis not in Christ or,\n\nif all is in him,\n\nthen those who have Christ by faith\n\nhave his salvation entirely.\n\nTherefore,\n\nto say that Christ is not enough\n\nbut that something else is needed as well\n\nis a most enormous blasphemy against God—\n\nfor it then would follow\n\nthat Jesus Christ is only half a Savior.\n\nAnd therefore we justly say with Paul\n\nthat we are justified “by faith alone”\n\nor “by faith apart from works.”54\n\nHowever,\n\nwe do not mean,\n\nproperly speaking,\n\nthat it is faith itself that justifies us—\n\nfor faith is only the instrument\n\nby which we embrace Christ,\n\nour righteousness.\n\nBut Jesus Christ is our righteousness\n\nin making available to us all his merits\n\nand all the holy works he has done\n\nfor us and in our place.\n\nAnd faith is the instrument\n\nthat keeps us in communion with him\n\nand with all his benefits.\n\nWhen those benefits are made ours,\n\nthey are more than enough to absolve us\n\nof our sins.\n\n54Rom. 3:28\n\nArticle 23: The Justification of Sinners\n\nWe believe\n\nthat our blessedness lies in the forgiveness of our sins\n\nbecause of Jesus Christ,\n\nand that in it our righteousness before God is contained,\n\nas David and Paul teach us\n\nwhen they declare those people blessed\n\nto whom God grants righteousness\n\napart from works.55\n\nAnd the same apostle says\n\nthat we are “justified by his grace as a gift,\n\nthrough the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”56\n\nAnd therefore we cling to this foundation,\n\nwhich is firm forever,\n\ngiving all glory to God,\n\nhumbling ourselves,\n\nand recognizing ourselves as we are;\n\nnot claiming a thing for ourselves or our merits\n\nand leaning and resting\n\non the sole obedience of Christ crucified,\n\nwhich is ours when we believe in him.\n\nThat is enough to cover all our sins\n\nand to make us confident,\n\nfreeing the conscience from the fear, dread, and terror\n\nof God’s approach,\n\nwithout doing what our first parents, Adam and Eve, did,\n\nwho trembled as they tried to cover themselves\n\nwith fig leaves.\n\nIn fact,\n\nif we had to appear before God relying—\n\nno matter how little—\n\non ourselves or some other creature,\n\nthen, alas, we would be swallowed up.\n\nTherefore everyone must say with David:\n\n“[Lord,] do not enter into judgment with your servant,\n\nfor no one living is righteous before you.”57\n\n55Ps. 32:1; Rom. 4:6\n\n56Rom. 3:24\n\n57Ps. 143:2\n\nArticle 24: The Sanctification of Sinners\n\nWe believe that this true faith,\n\nproduced in us by the hearing of God’s Word\n\nand by the work of the Holy Spirit,\n\nregenerates us and makes us new creatures,58\n\ncausing us to live a new life59\n\nand freeing us from the slavery of sin.\n\nTherefore,\n\nfar from making people cold\n\ntoward living in a pious and holy way,\n\nthis justifying faith,\n\nquite to the contrary,\n\nso works within them that\n\napart from it\n\nthey will never do a thing out of love for God\n\nbut only out of love for themselves\n\nand fear of being condemned.\n\nSo then, it is impossible\n\nfor this holy faith to be unfruitful in a human being,\n\nseeing that we do not speak of an empty faith\n\nbut of what Scripture calls\n\n“faith working through love,”60\n\nwhich moves people to do by themselves\n\nthe works that God has commanded\n\nin the Word.\n\nThese works,\n\nproceeding from the good root of faith,\n\nare good and acceptable to God,\n\nsince they are all sanctified by God’s grace.\n\nYet they do not count toward our justification—\n\nfor by faith in Christ we are justified,\n\neven before we do good works.\n\nOtherwise they could not be good,\n\nany more than the fruit of a tree could be good\n\nif the tree is not good in the first place.\n\nSo then, we do good works,\n\nbut not for merit—\n\nfor what would we merit?\n\nRather, we are indebted to God for the good works we do,\n\nand not God to us,\n\nsince God “is at work in [us], enabling [us] both\n\nto will and to work for his good pleasure”61 —\n\nthus keeping in mind what is written:\n\n“When you have done all that you were ordered to do,\n\nsay, ‘We are worthless slaves;\n\nwe have done only what we ought to have done.’“62\n\nYet we do not wish to deny\n\nthat God rewards good works—\n\nbut it is by grace\n\nthat God crowns these gifts.\n\nMoreover,\n\nalthough we do good works\n\nwe do not base our salvation on them;\n\nfor we cannot do any work\n\nthat is not defiled by our flesh\n\nand also worthy of punishment.\n\nAnd even if we could point to one,\n\nmemory of a single sin is enough\n\nfor God to reject that work.\n\nSo we would always be in doubt,\n\ntossed back and forth\n\nwithout any certainty,\n\nand our poor consciences would be tormented constantly\n\nif they did not rest on the merit\n\nof the suffering and death of our Savior.\n\n582 Cor. 5:17\n\n59Rom. 6:4\n\n60Gal. 5:6\n\n61Phil. 2:13\n\n62Luke 17:10\n\nArticle 25: The Fulfillment of the Law\n\nWe believe\n\nthat the ceremonies and symbols of the law have ended\n\nwith the coming of Christ,\n\nand that all foreshadowings have come to an end,\n\nso that the use of them ought to be abolished\n\namong Christians.\n\nYet the truth and substance of these things\n\nremain for us in Jesus Christ,\n\nin whom they have been fulfilled.\n\nNevertheless,\n\nwe continue to use the witnesses\n\ndrawn from the law and prophets\n\nto confirm us in the gospel\n\nand to regulate our lives with full integrity\n\nfor the glory of God,\n\naccording to the will of God.\n\nArticle 26: The Intercession of Christ\n\nWe believe that we have no access to God\n\nexcept through the one and only Mediator and Intercessor,\n\n“Jesus Christ the righteous,”63\n\nwho\n\ntherefore was made human,\n\nuniting together the divine and human natures,\n\nso that we human beings might have access to the divine Majesty.\n\nOtherwise we would have no access.\n\nBut this Mediator,\n\nwhom the Father has appointed between himself and us,\n\nought not terrify us by his greatness,\n\nso that we have to look for another one,\n\naccording to our fancy.\n\nFor neither in heaven nor among the creatures on earth\n\nis there anyone who loves us\n\nmore than Jesus Christ does.\n\nAlthough he was “in the form of God,”\n\nChrist nevertheless “emptied himself,”\n\ntaking “human form” and “the form of a slave” for us;64\n\nand he made himself “like his brothers and sisters\n\nin every respect.”65\n\nSuppose we had to find another intercessor.\n\nWho would love us more than he who gave his life for us,\n\neven though “we were enemies”?66\n\nAnd suppose we had to find one who has prestige and power.\n\nWho has as much of these as he who is seated\n\nat the right hand of the Father,67\n\nand who has “all authority\n\nin heaven and on earth”?68\n\nAnd who will be heard more readily\n\nthan God’s own dearly beloved Son?\n\nSo, the practice of honoring the saints as intercessors\n\nin fact dishonors them\n\nbecause of its misplaced faith.\n\nThat was something the saints never did nor asked for,\n\nbut which in keeping with their duty,\n\nas appears from their writings,\n\nthey consistently refused.\n\nWe should not plead here\n\nthat we are unworthy—\n\nfor it is not a question of offering our prayers\n\non the basis of our own dignity\n\nbut only on the basis of the excellence and dignity\n\nof Jesus Christ,\n\nwhose righteousness is ours by faith.\n\nSince the apostle for good reason\n\nwants us to get rid of this foolish fear—\n\nor rather, this unbelief—\n\nhe says to us that Jesus Christ\n\nwas made like “his brothers and sisters in every respect,\n\nso that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest”\n\nto purify the sins of the people.69\n\nFor since he suffered,\n\nbeing tempted,\n\nhe is also able to help those\n\nwho are tempted.70\n\nAnd further,\n\nto encourage us more\n\nto approach him\n\nhe says,\n\n“Since, then, we have a great high priest\n\nwho has passed through the heavens,\n\nJesus, the Son of God,\n\nlet us hold fast to our confession.\n\nFor we do not have a high priest\n\nwho is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,\n\nbut we have one who in every respect has been tested\n\nas we are,\n\nyet without sin.\n\nLet us therefore approach\n\nthe throne of grace\n\nwith boldness,\n\nso that we may receive mercy\n\nand find grace\n\nto help in time of need.”71\n\nThe same apostle says that\n\nwe “have confidence to enter the sanctuary\n\nby the blood of Jesus.”\n\n“Let us approach with a true heart\n\nin full assurance of faith….”72\n\nLikewise,\n\nChrist “holds his priesthood permanently….\n\nConsequently, he is able for all time to save\n\nthose who approach God through him,\n\nsince he always lives\n\nto make intercession for them.”73\n\nWhat more do we need?\n\nFor Christ himself declares:\n\n“I am the way, and the truth, and the life.\n\nNo one comes to the Father\n\nexcept through me.”74\n\nWhy should we seek\n\nanother intercessor?\n\nSince it has pleased God\n\nto give us the Son as our Intercessor.\n\nlet us not leave him for another—\n\nor rather seek, without ever finding.\n\nFor, when giving Christ to us,\n\nGod knew well that we were sinners.\n\nTherefore,\n\nin following the command of Christ\n\nwe call on the heavenly Father\n\nthrough Christ,\n\nour only Mediator,\n\nas we are taught by the Lord’s Prayer,\n\nbeing assured that we shall obtain\n\nall we ask of the Father\n\nin his name.\n\n631 John 2:1\n\n64Phil. 2:6-8\n\n65Heb. 2:17\n\n66Rom. 5:10\n\n67Rom. 8:34; Heb. 1:3\n\n68Matt. 28:18\n\n69Heb. 2:17\n\n70Heb. 2:18\n\n71Heb. 4:14-16\n\n72Heb. 10:19, 22\n\n73Heb. 7:24-25\n\n74John 14:6\n\nArticle 27: The Holy Catholic Church\n\nWe believe and confess\n\none single catholic or universal church—\n\na holy congregation and gathering\n\nof true Christian believers,\n\nawaiting their entire salvation in Jesus Christ,\n\nbeing washed by his blood,\n\nand sanctified and sealed by the Holy Spirit.\n\nThis church has existed from the beginning of the world\n\nand will last until the end,\n\nas appears from the fact\n\nthat Christ is eternal King\n\nwho cannot be without subjects.\n\nAnd this holy church is preserved by God\n\nagainst the rage of the whole world,\n\neven though for a time\n\nit may appear very small\n\nto human eyes—\n\nas though it were snuffed out.\n\nFor example,\n\nduring the very dangerous time of Ahab\n\nthe Lord preserved for himself seven thousand\n\nwho did not bend their knees to Baal.75\n\nAnd so this holy church\n\nis not confined,\n\nbound,\n\nor limited to a certain place or certain people.\n\nBut it is spread and dispersed\n\nthroughout the entire world,\n\nthough still joined and united\n\nin heart and will,\n\nin one and the same Spirit,\n\nby the power of faith.\n\n751 Kings 19:18\n\nArticle 28: The Obligations of Church Members\n\nWe believe that\n\nsince this holy assembly and congregation\n\nis the gathering of those who are saved\n\nand there is no salvation apart from it,\n\npeople ought not to withdraw from it,\n\ncontent to be by themselves,\n\nregardless of their status or condition.\n\nBut all people are obliged\n\nto join and unite with it,\n\nkeeping the unity of the church\n\nby submitting to its instruction and discipline,\n\nby bending their necks under the yoke of Jesus Christ,\n\nand by serving to build up one another,\n\naccording to the gifts God has given them\n\nas members of each other\n\nin the same body.\n\nAnd to preserve this unity more effectively,\n\nit is the duty of all believers,\n\naccording to God’s Word,\n\nto separate themselves\n\nfrom those who do not belong to the church,\n\nin order to join this assembly\n\nwherever God has established it,\n\neven if civil authorities and royal decrees forbid\n\nand death and physical punishment result.\n\nAnd so,\n\nall who withdraw from the church\n\nor do not join it\n\nact contrary to God’s ordinance.\n\nArticle 29: The Marks of the True Church\n\nWe believe that we ought to discern\n\ndiligently and very carefully,\n\nby the Word of God,\n\nwhat is the true church—\n\nfor all sects in the world today\n\nclaim for themselves the name of “the church.”\n\nWe are not speaking here of the company of hypocrites\n\nwho are mixed among the good in the church\n\nand who nonetheless are not part of it,\n\neven though they are physically there.\n\nBut we are speaking of distinguishing\n\nthe body and fellowship of the true church\n\nfrom all sects that call themselves “the church.”\n\nThe true church can be recognized\n\nif it has the following marks:\n\nThe church engages in the pure preaching\n\nof the gospel;\n\nit makes use of the pure administration of the sacraments\n\nas Christ instituted them;\n\nit practices church discipline\n\nfor correcting faults.\n\nIn short, it governs itself\n\naccording to the pure Word of God,\n\nrejecting all things contrary to it\n\nand holding Jesus Christ as the only Head.\n\nBy these marks one can be assured\n\nof recognizing the true church—\n\nand no one ought to be separated from it.\n\nAs for those who can belong to the church,\n\nwe can recognize them by the distinguishing marks of Christians:\n\nnamely by faith,\n\nand by their fleeing from sin and pursuing righteousness,\n\nonce they have received the one and only Savior,\n\nJesus Christ.\n\nThey love the true God and their neighbors,\n\nwithout turning to the right or left,\n\nand they crucify the flesh and its works.\n\nThough great weakness remains in them,\n\nthey fight against it\n\nby the Spirit\n\nall the days of their lives,\n\nappealing constantly\n\nto the blood, suffering, death, and obedience of the Lord Jesus,\n\nin whom they have forgiveness of their sins,\n\nthrough faith in him.\n\nAs for the false church,\n\nit assigns more authority to itself and its ordinances\n\nthan to the Word of God;\n\nit does not want to subject itself\n\nto the yoke of Christ;\n\nit does not administer the sacraments\n\nas Christ commanded in his Word;\n\nit rather adds to them or subtracts from them\n\nas it pleases;\n\nit bases itself on humans,\n\nmore than on Jesus Christ;\n\nit persecutes those\n\nwho live holy lives according to the Word of God\n\nand who rebuke it for its faults, greed, and idolatry.\n\nThese two churches\n\nare easy to recognize\n\nand thus to distinguish\n\nfrom each other.\n\nArticle 30: The Government of the Church\n\nWe believe that this true church\n\nought to be governed according to the spiritual order\n\nthat our Lord has taught us in his Word.\n\nThere should be ministers or pastors\n\nto preach the Word of God\n\nand administer the sacraments.\n\nThere should also be elders and deacons,\n\nalong with the pastors,\n\nto make up the council of the church.\n\nBy this means\n\ntrue religion is preserved;\n\ntrue doctrine is able to take its course;\n\nand evil people are corrected spiritually and held in check,\n\nso that also the poor\n\nand all the afflicted\n\nmay be helped and comforted\n\naccording to their need.\n\nBy this means\n\neverything will be done well\n\nand in good order\n\nin the church,\n\nwhen such persons are elected\n\nwho are faithful\n\nand are chosen according to the rule\n\nthat Paul gave to Timothy.76\n\n761 Tim. 3\n\nArticle 31: The Officers of the Church\n\nWe believe that\n\nministers of the Word of God, elders, and deacons\n\nought to be chosen to their offices\n\nby a legitimate election of the church,\n\nwith prayer in the name of the Lord,\n\nand in good order,\n\nas the Word of God teaches.\n\nSo all must be careful\n\nnot to push themselves forward improperly,\n\nbut must wait for God’s call,\n\nso that they may be assured of their calling\n\nand be certain that they are\n\nchosen by the Lord.\n\nAs for the ministers of the Word,\n\nthey all have the same power and authority,\n\nno matter where they may be,\n\nsince they are all servants of Jesus Christ,\n\nthe only universal bishop,\n\nand the only head of the church.\n\nMoreover,\n\nto keep God’s holy order\n\nfrom being violated or despised,\n\nwe say that everyone ought,\n\nas much as possible,\n\nto hold the ministers of the Word and elders of the church\n\nin special esteem,\n\nbecause of the work they do,\n\nand be at peace with them,\n\nwithout grumbling, quarreling, or fighting.\n\nArticle 32: The Order and Discipline of the Church\n\nWe also believe that\n\nalthough it is useful and good\n\nfor those who govern the churches\n\nto establish and set up\n\na certain order among themselves\n\nfor maintaining the body of the church,\n\nthey ought always to guard against deviating\n\nfrom what Christ,\n\nour only Master,\n\nhas ordained\n\nfor us.\n\nTherefore we reject all human innovations\n\nand all laws imposed on us,\n\nin our worship of God,\n\nwhich bind and force our consciences\n\nin any way.\n\nSo we accept only what is proper\n\nto maintain harmony and unity\n\nand to keep all in obedience\n\nto God.\n\nTo that end excommunication,\n\nwith all it involves,\n\naccording to the Word of God,\n\nis required.\n\nArticle 33: The Sacraments\n\nWe believe that our good God,\n\nmindful of our crudeness and weakness,\n\nhas ordained sacraments for us\n\nto seal his promises in us,\n\nto pledge good will and grace toward us,\n\nand also to nourish and sustain our faith.\n\nGod has added these to the Word of the gospel\n\nto represent better to our external senses\n\nboth what God enables us to understand by the Word\n\nand what he does inwardly in our hearts,\n\nconfirming in us\n\nthe salvation he imparts to us.\n\nFor they are visible signs and seals\n\nof something internal and invisible,\n\nby means of which God works in us\n\nthrough the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\nSo they are not empty and hollow signs\n\nto fool and deceive us,\n\nfor their truth is Jesus Christ,\n\nwithout whom they would be nothing.\n\nMoreover,\n\nwe are satisfied with the number of sacraments\n\nthat Christ our Master has ordained for us.\n\nThere are only two:\n\nthe sacrament of baptism\n\nand the Holy Supper of Jesus Christ.\n\nArticle 34: The Sacrament of Baptism\n\nWe believe and confess that Jesus Christ,\n\nin whom the law is fulfilled,\n\nhas by his shed blood\n\nput an end to every other shedding of blood,\n\nwhich anyone might do or wish to do\n\nin order to atone or satisfy for sins.\n\nHaving abolished circumcision,\n\nwhich was done with blood,\n\nChrist established in its place\n\nthe sacrament of baptism.\n\nBy it we are received into God’s church\n\nand set apart from all other people and alien religions,\n\nthat we may wholly belong to him\n\nwhose mark and sign we bear.\n\nBaptism also witnesses to us\n\nthat God, being our gracious Father,\n\nwill be our God forever.\n\nTherefore Christ has commanded\n\nthat all those who belong to him\n\nbe baptized with pure water\n\n“in the name of the Father\n\nand of the Son\n\nand of the Holy Spirit.”77\n\nIn this way God signifies to us\n\nthat just as water washes away the dirt of the body\n\nwhen it is poured on us\n\nand also is seen on the bodies of those who are baptized\n\nwhen it is sprinkled on them,\n\nso too the blood of Christ does the same thing internally,\n\nin the soul,\n\nby the Holy Spirit.\n\nIt washes and cleanses it from its sins\n\nand transforms us from being the children of wrath\n\ninto the children of God.\n\nThis does not happen by the physical water\n\nbut by the sprinkling of the precious blood of the Son of God,\n\nwho is our Red Sea,\n\nthrough which we must pass\n\nto escape the tyranny of Pharaoh,\n\nwho is the devil,\n\nand to enter the spiritual land\n\nof Canaan.\n\nSo ministers,\n\nas far as their work is concerned,\n\ngive us the sacrament and what is visible,\n\nbut our Lord gives what the sacrament signifies—\n\nnamely the invisible gifts and graces;\n\nwashing, purifying, and cleansing our souls\n\nof all filth and unrighteousness;\n\nrenewing our hearts and filling them\n\nwith all comfort;\n\ngiving us true assurance\n\nof his fatherly goodness;\n\nclothing us with the “new self”\n\nand stripping off the “old self\n\nwith its practices.”78\n\nFor this reason we believe that\n\nanyone who aspires to reach eternal life\n\nought to be baptized only once\n\nwithout ever repeating it—\n\nfor we cannot be born twice.\n\nYet this baptism is profitable\n\nnot only when the water is on us\n\nand when we receive it\n\nbut throughout our\n\nentire lives.\n\nFor that reason we reject the error of the Anabaptists\n\nwho are not content with a single baptism\n\nonce received\n\nand also condemn the baptism\n\nof the children of believers.\n\nWe believe our children ought to be baptized\n\nand sealed with the sign of the covenant,\n\nas little children were circumcised in Israel\n\non the basis of the same promises\n\nmade to our children.\n\nAnd truly,\n\nChrist has shed his blood no less\n\nfor washing the little children of believers\n\nthan he did for adults.\n\nTherefore they ought to receive the sign and sacrament\n\nof what Christ has done for them,\n\njust as the Lord commanded in the law that\n\nby offering a lamb for them\n\nthe sacrament of the suffering and death of Christ\n\nwould be granted them\n\nshortly after their birth.\n\nThis was the sacrament of Jesus Christ.\n\nFurthermore,\n\nbaptism does for our children\n\nwhat circumcision did for the Jewish people.\n\nThat is why Paul calls baptism\n\nthe “circumcision of Christ.”79\n\n77Matt. 28:19\n\n78Col. 3:9-10\n\n79Col. 2:11\n\nArticle 35: The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper\n\nWe believe and confess\n\nthat our Savior Jesus Christ\n\nhas ordained and instituted the sacrament of the Holy Supper\n\nto nourish and sustain those\n\nwho are already regenerated and ingrafted\n\ninto his family,\n\nwhich is his church.\n\nNow those who are born again have two lives in them.\n\nThe one is physical and temporal—\n\nthey have it from the moment of their first birth,\n\nand it is common to all.\n\nThe other is spiritual and heavenly,\n\nand is given them in their second birth—\n\nit comes through the Word of the gospel\n\nin the communion of the body of Christ;\n\nand this life is common to God’s elect only.\n\nThus, to support the physical and earthly life\n\nGod has prescribed for us\n\nan appropriate earthly and material bread,\n\nwhich is as common to all people\n\nas life itself.\n\nBut to maintain the spiritual and heavenly life\n\nthat belongs to believers,\n\nGod has sent a living bread\n\nthat came down from heaven:\n\nnamely Jesus Christ,\n\nwho nourishes and maintains\n\nthe spiritual life of believers\n\nwhen eaten—\n\nthat is, when appropriated\n\nand received spiritually\n\nby faith.\n\nTo represent to us\n\nthis spiritual and heavenly bread\n\nChrist has instituted\n\nan earthly and visible bread as the sacrament of his body\n\nand wine as the sacrament of his blood.\n\nHe did this to testify to us that\n\njust as truly as we take and hold the sacrament in our hands\n\nand eat and drink it with our mouths,\n\nby which our life is then sustained,\n\nso truly we receive into our souls,\n\nfor our spiritual life,\n\nthe true body and true blood of Christ,\n\nour only Savior.\n\nWe receive these by faith,\n\nwhich is the hand and mouth of our souls.\n\nNow it is certain\n\nthat Jesus Christ did not prescribe\n\nhis sacraments for us in vain,\n\nsince he works in us all he represents\n\nby these holy signs,\n\nalthough the manner in which he does it\n\ngoes beyond our understanding\n\nand is incomprehensible to us,\n\njust as the operation of God’s Spirit\n\nis hidden and incomprehensible.\n\nYet we do not go wrong when we say\n\nthat what is eaten is Christ’s own natural body\n\nand what is drunk is his own blood—\n\nbut the manner in which we eat it\n\nis not by the mouth, but by the Spirit\n\nthrough faith.\n\nIn that way Jesus Christ remains always seated\n\nat the right hand of God the Father\n\nin heaven—\n\nbut he never refrains on that account\n\nto communicate himself to us\n\nthrough faith.\n\nThis banquet is a spiritual table\n\nat which Christ communicates himself to us\n\nwith all his benefits.\n\nAt that table he makes us enjoy himself\n\nas much as the merits of his suffering and death,\n\nas he nourishes, strengthens, and comforts\n\nour poor, desolate souls\n\nby the eating of his flesh,\n\nand relieves and renews them\n\nby the drinking of his blood.\n\nMoreover,\n\nthough the sacraments and what they signify are joined together,\n\nnot all receive both of them.\n\nThe wicked certainly take the sacrament,\n\nto their condemnation,\n\nbut do not receive the truth of the sacrament,\n\njust as Judas and Simon the Sorcerer both indeed\n\nreceived the sacrament,\n\nbut not Christ,\n\nwho was signified by it.\n\nHe is communicated only to believers.\n\nFinally,\n\nwith humility and reverence\n\nwe receive the holy sacrament\n\nin the gathering of God’s people,\n\nas we engage together,\n\nwith thanksgiving,\n\nin a holy remembrance\n\nof the death of Christ our Savior,\n\nand as we thus confess\n\nour faith and Christian religion.\n\nTherefore none should come to this table\n\nwithout examining themselves carefully,\n\nlest by eating this bread\n\nand drinking this cup\n\nthey “eat and drink judgment against themselves.”80\n\nIn short,\n\nby the use of this holy sacrament\n\nwe are moved to a fervent love\n\nof God and our neighbors.\n\nTherefore we reject\n\nas desecrations of the sacraments\n\nall the muddled ideas and condemnable inventions\n\nthat people have added and mixed in with them.\n\nAnd we say that we should be content with the procedure\n\nthat Christ and the apostles have taught us\n\nand speak of these things\n\nas they have spoken of them.\n\n801 Cor. 11:29\n\nArticle 36: The Civil Government\n\nWe believe that\n\nbecause of the depravity of the human race,\n\nour good God has ordained kings, princes, and civil officers.\n\nGod wants the world to be governed by laws and policies\n\nso that human lawlessness may be restrained\n\nand that everything may be conducted in good order\n\namong human beings.\n\nFor that purpose God has placed the sword\n\nin the hands of the government,\n\nto punish evil people\n\nand protect the good.\n\n[RCA only*\n\nAnd the government’s task is not limited\n\nto caring for and watching over the public domain\n\nbut extends also to upholding the sacred ministry,\n\nwith a view to removing and destroying\n\nall idolatry and false worship of the Antichrist;\n\nto promoting the kingdom of Jesus Christ;\n\nand to furthering the preaching of the gospel everywhere;\n\nto the end that God may be honored and served by everyone,\n\nas he requires in his Word.]\n\n[CRC only**\n\nAnd being called in this manner\n\nto contribute to the advancement of a society\n\nthat is pleasing to God,\n\nthe civil rulers have the task,\n\nsubject to God’s law,\n\nof removing every obstacle\n\nto the preaching of the gospel\n\nand to every aspect of divine worship.\n\nThey should do this\n\nwhile completely refraining from every tendency\n\ntoward exercising absolute authority,\n\nand while functioning in the sphere entrusted to them,\n\nwith the means belonging to them.\n\nThey should do it in order that\n\nthe Word of God may have free course;\n\nthe kingdom of Jesus Christ may make progress;\n\nand every anti-Christian power may be resisted.]\n\nMoreover everyone,\n\nregardless of status, condition, or rank,\n\nmust be subject to the government,\n\nand pay taxes,\n\nand hold its representatives in honor and respect,\n\nand obey them in all things that are not in conflict\n\nwith God’s Word,\n\npraying for them\n\nthat the Lord may be willing to lead them\n\nin all their ways\n\nand that we may live a peaceful and quiet life\n\nin all piety and decency.\n\n[RCA only***\n\nAnd on this matter we reject the Anabaptists, anarchists,\n\nand in general all those who want\n\nto reject the authorities and civil officers\n\nand to subvert justice\n\nby introducing common ownership of goods\n\nand corrupting the moral order\n\nthat God has established among human beings.]\n\n* The Reformed Church in America retains the original full text, choosing to recognize that the confession was written within a historical context which may not accurately describe the situation that pertains today.\n\n**Synod 1958 of the Christian Reformed Church replaced the aforementioned paragraph with the following three paragraphs (in brackets).\n\n***The RCA retains this final paragraph of the original Article 36, choosing to recognize that the confession was written within a historical context which may not accurately describe the situation that pertains today. Synod 1985 of the CRC directed that this paragraph be taken from the body of the text and placed in a footnote.\n\nArticle 37: The Last Judgement\n\nFinally we believe,\n\naccording to God’s Word,\n\nthat when the time appointed by the Lord is come\n\n(which is unknown to all creatures)\n\nand the number of the elect is complete,\n\nour Lord Jesus Christ will come from heaven,\n\nbodily and visibly,\n\nas he ascended,\n\nwith great glory and majesty,\n\nto declare himself the judge\n\nof the living and the dead.\n\nHe will burn this old world,\n\nin fire and flame,\n\nin order to cleanse it.\n\nThen all human creatures will appear in person\n\nbefore the great judge—\n\nmen, women, and children,\n\nwho have lived from the beginning until the end\n\nof the world.\n\nThey will be summoned there\n\n“with the archangel’s call\n\nand with the sound of God’s trumpet.”81\n\nFor all those who died before that time\n\nwill be raised from the earth,\n\ntheir spirits being joined and united\n\nwith their own bodies\n\nin which they lived.\n\nAnd as for those who are still alive,\n\nthey will not die like the others\n\nbut will be changed “in the twinkling of an eye”\n\nfrom perishable to imperishable.82\n\nThen the books (that is, the consciences) will be opened,\n\nand the dead will be judged\n\naccording to the things they did in the world,83\n\nwhether good or evil.\n\nIndeed, all people will give account\n\nof all the idle words they have spoken,84\n\nwhich the world regards\n\nas only playing games.\n\nAnd then the secrets and hypocrisies of all people\n\nwill be publicly uncovered\n\nin the sight of all.\n\nTherefore,\n\nwith good reason\n\nthe thought of this judgment\n\nis horrible and dreadful\n\nto wicked and evil people.\n\nBut it is very pleasant\n\nand a great comfort\n\nto the righteous and elect,\n\nsince their total redemption\n\nwill then be accomplished.\n\nThey will then receive the fruits of their labor\n\nand of the trouble they have suffered;\n\ntheir innocence will be openly recognized by all;\n\nand they will see the terrible vengeance\n\nthat God will bring on the evil ones\n\nwho tyrannized, oppressed, and tormented them\n\nin this world.\n\nThe evil ones will be convicted\n\nby the witness of their own consciences,\n\nand shall be made immortal—\n\nbut only to be tormented\n\nin “the eternal fire\n\nprepared for the devil and his angels.”85\n\nIn contrast,\n\nthe faithful and elect will be crowned\n\nwith glory and honor.\n\nThe Son of God will profess their names86\n\nbefore God his Father and the holy and elect angels;\n\nall tears will be wiped from their eyes;87\n\nand their cause—\n\nat present condemned as heretical and evil\n\nby many judges and civil officers—\n\nwill be acknowledged as the cause of the Son of God.\n\nAnd as a gracious reward\n\nthe Lord will make them possess a glory\n\nsuch as the human heart\n\ncould never imagine.\n\nSo we look forward to that great day with longing\n\nin order to enjoy fully\n\nthe promises of God in Christ Jesus,\n\nour Lord."
