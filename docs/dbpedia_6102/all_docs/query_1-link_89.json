        "text": "“Sorry about your aunt. No, I don’t remember her, but please tell her I’m sorry and never meant this to happen.” — Bernie Madoff, in an email from prison\n\nOn a cellular level, I have no doubt that my late aunt Adele Behar will enjoy this article. For one thing, during much of her adult life—she died in 2016 at age 88—she passionately donated money she made from Bernie Madoff $68 billion Ponzi scheme to fund the research of scientists who were at the cutting edge of trying to figure out the physiology of consciousness. (Whether she believed a kind of consciousness survived death in one form or another, I don’t know, but I need to believe it does. So at least there’s that.)\n\nA second reason I think she’d like this article is that, for years after the 2008 implosion of Madoff’s Ponzi—the biggest and lengthiest known financial fraud in history—she laughed with me as I chronicled her story for a chapter of my book, “Madoff: The Final Word,” which was published several weeks ago.\n\nMy reporting on the subject began the day after Bernie’s arrest, when a cousin called to say ‘my mom lost everything” to a guy I’d never heard of before. I slowly developed a relationship with Madoff that lasted for a decade until his death in 2021. It included three prison visits, hundreds of emails and letters, and more than 50 phone conversations, most of which I taped. I also benefitted from hundreds of conversations with sources, ranging from prosecutors, regulators and FBI agents, to employees and family members.\n\nIn addition, I obtained more than 100 pages of confidential FBI documents that shed new light on the fraud, including its origin (the early 1960s, soon after Bernie graduated from college and started his business on Wall Street), Madoff family complicity and wrongdoing, and numerous warning signs that should have made investors like Adele scurry for the hills. The documents are interview summaries (known in agency parlance as 302s) compiled during many months during 2009 that Bernie’s deputy-in-crime, Frank DiPascali, sat with government investigators.\n\nFrank, who died in 2015, had more than 75 lengthy sessions (over a period of more than four years) with feds, who told me they never caught him in a lie, and considered him one of the best and most honest cooperators they ever worked with in their many collective years of prosecuting major financial crime cases.\n\n(Some screenshots from those FBI memos are below.)\n\nAunt Adele lost her life savings of $6 million in the Ponzi (fortunately, I was never an heir)—her final account statements’ phantom balances evaporating overnight. She took full responsbility for her predicament, and refused to consider herself a victim. “There’s nothing to cry about,” she said. “There’s nothing to be compassionate about. I made decisions—it’s caveat emptor all the way.” She looked at her final years of life as an exciting new journey of figuring out how to manage on little more than Social Security. Part of that adventure included her exploring Madoff with me.\n\nI always looked up to her and my late Uncle Al as financially savvy. (She said Madoff once called her in 1993 to ask if she understood the stock market enough to know the risks involved. And she said she did.) They were artistic, self-employed entrepreneurs who bought some real estate, worked hard, and managed to sock away roughly $1 million by the time Bernie came into their lives. It was never about greed for them, and they didn’t live extravagantly. They grew up during the Depression, and they viewed the 14 to 15 percent per year in profits that Madoff consistently provided them as a kind of solid CD.\n\nBut, like all of Madoff’s thousands of investors—from individual clients to hedge funds, pension funds, family trusts, banks, charities and colleges—my uncle and aunt missed too many red flags, starting with the simple fact that the returns were too good to be true. [For emphasis, the flags on the documents below were added by me, not by Bernie, although one wonders if he could have gotten away with doing that, too!]\n\nFollowing Bernie’s confession and arrest in 2008, Adele sent me a pile of the customer statements and stock trading confirmations (or tickets) that she, like other investors, had received on a regular basis from Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. She included a BLMIS customer trading agreement that she’d signed in 1993. After examining those documents for the book, an investigative forensic accountant named Bruce Dubinsky, who has probed Madoff’s operation for the feds and a court-appointed trustee, concluded that had any of these investors done minimal due diligence, or handed them off to an expert, the fraud could have been uncovered long before Madoff’s confession.\n\nCase in point: The above excerpt of an account statement of Al and Adele’s family trust. (It’s from March of 1994.) If you eyeball what’s in the red box, it shows 100 percent success in all of the stocks traded during that period: Walmart, Ford Motor, General Motors, American International Group (AIG), and McDonald’s. “It’s nice to be able to always buy low, sell high,” says Dubinsky. “In this case, he sold high by ‘going short,’ then five days later he bought low. This always happened. Nice way to make money. Easy to do when fake.”\n\nAs part of Dubinsky’s investigations, he discovered that many of Madoff’s purported trades exceeded the entire reported market volume for particular securities (ranging from Apple, to IBM, to GM) on many trading days, and were recorded at prices that were outside the range of reported trading prices on the days listed on customer statements. Had investors such as Adele and thousands of others checked their statements carefully and compared the buys and sells for securities against what appeared in the Wall Street Journal or on the Internet, they would have spotted this. They might also have noticed that many trades were recorded on their statements as being settled on weekends or holidays, when U.S. stock and options exchanges were closed.\n\nUnfortunately, Bernie’s customers were not permitted to view their statements online. Only on paper, via snailmail. Quaint, old-fashioned, and a stupendous red flag. Not only that, but in the wake of a pair of newspaper stories in 2001 that raised questions about his too-good-to-be-true returns [I’ll return to that later], Bernie blocked the ability of his customers from emailing the staffers who were overseeing their accounts. He worried, understandably, that regulators could someday retrieve emails that could expose the fraud.\n\nIndeed, in 2005, the SEC faxed a request to BLMIS for numerous documents, including a year’s worth of incoming and outgoing emails for a small handful of employees that included DiPascali, as well as Bernie’s two sons, Andrew and Mark Madoff. “The boys,” as the sons were called, ran the company’s market-making and proprietary trading units along with Bernie’s younger brother, Peter. (Mark died by suicide in 2010; Andrew from cancer four years later.) Those units were legitimately profitable for decades; however in the final decade of the company’s existence, nearly $800 million was diverted from the phony Investment Advisory (IA) unit—meaning the Ponzi scheme— to prop them up.\n\nThat SEC request sparked a massive shredding party. DiPasali told the feds (see document below) that Peter, Andrew, Mark, and Shana Madoff (Peter’s daughter, and the firm’s compliance counsel) set about destroying “problematic” emails, which Frank defined for the FBI as any email “that referenced [IA] customers or could trigger further inquiry by the auditors.” For his part, Bernie ordered the head of the BLMIS computer department (Liz Weintraub, who died three years later) to “clean up” the BLMIS email server so that “any email that referenced IA customers would be removed.” Among other things, recalled Frank, “friends of Mark and Andrew who wanted to inquire about opening an IA account sometimes had sent email to them” and “Bernie knew this was a problem so he ordered the scrubbing of the email. . . . Bernie wanted to present them [the SEC] with a sanitized email server.”\n\nPeter and Shana declined to speak with me. He pled guilty to falsifying the firm’s books, filing false statements with the SEC, and other crimes, and received a ten-year sentence. Shana narrowly escaped an indictment.\n\nBernie’s sons, as well as his wife Ruth, always maintained they were innocent victims. And that’s how they’ve been routinely portrayed—in books, movies (including one with Robert De Niro playing Bernie, and Michelle Pfeiffer playing Ruth), and even a “true crime” Netflix docuseries in 2023. But the truth is not so tidy. For example, in other 302s, DiPascali laid out various events “that were indicative to him that Andrew knew exactly what was happening on 17.” See also this adapted book excerpt in Forbes called “The Sins of Ruth Madoff.”\n\n(Ruth is now 83 and residing in an assisted-living facility near New York.)\n\nMadoff family members didn’t just shred incriminating documents. Bernie also hoarded them. As it turned out, the biggest fraud in history also had one of the biggest hoards ever of documents for investigators to sift through: four terabytes, or some thirty million pages—nearly half the size of the printed material collection of the U.S. Library of Congress. The sifting took a decade.\n\nAmong the documents discovered at BLMIS offices, as well as in storage in warehouses, were trading authorizations, which clients were required to sign. In the trading authorization below, which was signed and dated in 1993 by my Aunt Adele, it states: “The undersigned hereby authorizes Bernard L. Madoff (whose signature appears below) as his agent and attorney in fact to buy, sell, and trade in stocks.” According to Dubinsky, who also once worked as an investment advisor, it was strange to have customers authorize only Bernie and not the firm itself. “If somebody had sent me that, I would have said, ‘Why is he the only guy? What happens if he had a heart attack—no one can trade my money?’ It makes no sense. No one would ever do that.”\n\n[As an aside, note how this standard BLMIS document from the 1990s is addressed only to “Gentlemen.” How quaint of Madoff, how old-fashioned. Not exactly a red flag, but perhaps a sign that he didn’t bother redoing them from the early 1960s, when the fraud began.]\n\nOne thing that will always gnaw at me about my dear aunt is this: Had she only asked me, an investigative reporter whom she so often tapped to probe things for her, to take a peek into Madoff, I would have found enough in an hour—such as a skeptical 2001 article in MARHedge, a financial newsletter, and another in Barron’s—to advise her to put her money elsewhere. Or to limit her exposure, at least. Why didn’t she ask? Why didn’t she want to know? Why didn’t any of the investors who lost in the end want to know? Why did they decide to push away the obvious? Those articles weren’t hidden away in dusty vaults. They were assessible for anyone to find and read. And they certainly caused a firestorm inside of BLMIS, as DiPascali laid out for the feds in the following 302s...\n\nThose skeptical articles are what due diligence is all about, not only for average customers, but also for the celebs, charities, hedge funds and banks that either knew better or should have. As laid out in the FBI excerpts below, clients, including large hedge funds, would sometimes be given tours of the BLMIS offices in Manhattan’s iconic Lipstick building to see their money at work. The clients, of course, would never see or be told about the 17th floor where their money was actually being managed (read: stolen). They were simply shown the 18th and 19th floors—the home of the trading desk and operations for the broker-dealer and market-making units run by Peter, Andrew and Mark Madoff. Customers rarely asked questions. In one case, it appears that Andrew left a client with the impression that his money was being managed by Bernie on the floors (18 and 19) where they themselves did the firm’s real trading.\n\nIn fact, obsolete computers on the 17th floor were not even connected to the two floors above it, let alone to stock exchanges. And those computers sometimes did a lousy job of printing all the fake paper. On one trade “confirmation” ticket of Adele’s, the company listed is spelled wrong, which actually occurred on many statements for customers. Had the 17th floor actually been connected to the outside stock exchange that handled the “trade”—it wasn’t—this error would have been impossible.\n\nOn another trade confirmation ticket sent to Adele, Bernie had it all “backward,” says Dubinsky, as it contradicts what appears on the account statement that the ticket was supposed to reflect. Specifically, the ticket states that two shares of the S&P 100 Index were bought on November 15, 1994 (see below, in the red box, the letters ‘BOT”), while the account statement shows they were sold. So, which was it? Neither, of course.\n\nThe SEC’s rules on this subject are simple enough: Customer confirmations must disclose the trade in such a way that the customer understands the transaction that occurred. If a customer were to buy— say—1,000 shares of IBM at $100, the confirmation the customer receives from a legitimate firm would state “You bought” or simply “bought” 1,000 shares of IBM at $100.\n\nBut BLMIS confirmations didn’t read that way.“Bernie Madoff didn’t do that,” says Dubinsky. “Maybe he was lazy, he didn’t care, he didn’t think anybody would notice. It makes no sense.”\n\nHere’s how the BLMIS statements read: If one of his customers (purportedly) bought 1,000 IBM shares, instead of saying “You bought” or simply “bought,” it stated “We sold.” The use of the word “we,” in a convoluted way, explained that BLMIS was the counterparty to the trade, in that “BLMIS sold to you” 1,000 IBM at $100. However, that is counterintuitive and skirts the requirements of an SEC rule that states you must confirm to the customer what “THEY” did, not what YOU, as the brokerage firm counterparty, did.\n\nOne of the most outlandish red flags was located north of the Lipstick building, in a small office in a strip mall in Rockland County. The office belonged to David Freihling, the CPA for BLMIS. A series of internal emails at Fairfield Greenwich Group, the largest feeder-fund conduit into Madoff ($7 billion invested, and lost) are as hilarious as they are repulsive—particularly when execs there belatedly discovered that Friehling did not have the hundreds of clients as he and Bernie claimed, but only one: Madoff. It would have been easy to find that out had they not been so busy luxuriating in the Ponzi’s gravy. Banks like JPMorgan Chase and HSBC, too. During one sitdown with feds, DiPascali talked about how HSBC wanted to conduct due diligence, but Bernie was able to “bully” them into accepting Friehling’s audit. Friehling even operated out of his home until Madoff forced him to get an office.\n\nAt least HSBC went through the motions of a due diligence. Very few institutions even bothered. “It’s astounding that people gave Bernie their money without doing any due diligence,” says Lisa Baroni, a former federal prosecutor who led Madoff-related investigations before becoming a chief compliance officer in the asset management industry. “Having worked at hedge funds, if you don't let investors come in and do due diligence, they're not giving you their money to invest.\"\n\nAccountant Friehling not only didn’t conduct real audits of Madoff, he left stacks of blank letterhead and a signature stamp at BLMIS offices so that others there could do his work for him.\n\nWhile CPA firms during that period might have used a rubber signature stamp to make it easier and quicker to sign audit opinion letters, leaving that stamp in the custody of a client is “prima facia evidence that Friehling knew about the fraud and allowed them to use his stamp when they needed to do so,” asserts Dubinsky. “A CPA should never leave their letterhead, much less a signature stamp with a client. Cardinal Sin.” Bernie complained all the time to DiPascali about what he called Friehling’s “stupidity.” Perhaps the accountant didn’t know any better? Dubinsky ain’t buying it. “If I ask you to leave your wallet with me, would you do it? The guy might have been dumb but not that dumb.” Indeed, in 2009, Friehling was charged with fraud for having helped deceive investors by rubber-stamping BLMIS’s books for seventeen years. (He pled guilty and became a government cooperator.)\n\nAt the end of the day, while the Aunt Adeles of the world should have done some due diligence, her consistent 14-15% annual returns were nothing compared to Bernie’s oldest and “special” customers. They routinely enjoyed a whopping 30-50% on their money. Many would even receive Christmas or Hanukkah gelt in their accounts in the form of phantom trades. [DiPascali had a folder he titled “Schupt”—a misspelling of Shtup, a Yiddish adjective meaning “pushed, or plugged or slipped in”—particularly in the context of sex.] Each December starting in the mid-1990s, the accounts in that folder received a huge inflow of fake profits (shtup!) to go on top of the rest of the year’s fake profits. The last thing these people wanted to conduct was due diligence.\n\nBut what can we say about the average adult, those who want to protect their money and grow it—with annual returns that are “good enough to be true,” and without getting stung by swindlers? “The lack of financial literacy is staggering,” laments Dubinsky. “Most people in this country have no idea how to balance their checkbook, much less understand the intricacies of owning investments in the stock market. Then add in that scammers always have the upper hand in duping people and the average person is a sitting duck.”\n\nAdult ducks, nonetheless, who need—like Adele did—to accept responsibility for where and with whom they swim. “People that get scammed routinely play the victim card and never say, ‘Wait a sec, when the guy promised me 15% returns, and the market was averaging 8%, I should have known something didn’t make sense.’” says Dubinsky. “When you chase returns, you get burned at some point.”\n\nAs for kids, 26 states now require a personal finance course for all high schoolers. (Only five states did in 2019.) We can only hope they all cover how to detect and avoid things like... yep, Ponzi schemes."
