        "text": "How to Go to Confession\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nConfession: Don’t Be Intimidated\n\nWhy Confession Is Important\n\nFinding a Time\n\nGroup Reconciliation Services\n\nExamples of Sins to Say at Confession\n\nStep by Step Guide\n\nMore Resources\n\nMany sacraments have outward, visible signs that announce and celebrate them. The sacrament of penance is not one of them.\n\nA photo of a newly baptized baby with godparents captures a child’s baptism, much like how a picture of a teenager standing with the bishop preserves the moment a young person is confirmed.\n\nThen there are weddings, and all that comprises them, from the announcements to the invitations, the joyful mass, the gifts, the reception and the beautiful memories.\n\nWe often want our entire network of family, friends and members of our faith community to at least be aware of these sacraments in our lives, even if we can’t invite them all to the celebration.\n\nOur hearts are filled with pride. With joy.\n\nThe sacrament of penance, also called “reconciliation,” is different in this aspect. You won’t go to someone’s home and see a photo on their mantle from their first (or any!) penance. No invitations will arrive announcing the date and time that a loved one plans to go through reconciliation.\n\nWith the sacrament of penance, the experience is different but no less important than other sacraments. Like other sacraments, its roots come from the Bible:\n\nNow this is the message that we have heard from him and proclaim to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. If we say, “We have fellowship with him,” while we continue to walk in darkness, we lie and do not act in truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, then we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of his Son Jesus cleanses us from all sin. If we say, “We are without sin,” we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from every wrongdoing. If we say, “We have not sinned,” we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.\n\n1 John 1:5-10\n\nConfession: Don’t Be Intimidated\n\nWhen we think about our sinfulness, we might feel embarrassed or alone. It’s not something we want to share with others.We may feel intimidated or reluctant to share our sins with the priest.\n\nIf you’re nervous or uneasy about going to confession, remember these three things:\n\nIt doesn’t matter if it’s been a long time (or a short time), God is still happy you’re there.\n\nOur God is a God of mercy. God wants to forgive us.\n\nGod, not the priest present in the confessional, is the one doing actually absolving your sins.\n\nPriests are bound by a canon law concept known as the “seal of the confessional,” which forbids them from sharing confessions under any circumstance.\n\nIf you’re worried about inconveniencing or bothering the priest, take comfort in the beautiful description of the sacrament from Pope John Paul II:\n\n“[Confession] is, without doubt, the most difficult and delicate, the most exhausting and demanding, but also one of the most beautiful and consoling ministries of the priest.”\n\nIn other words, it’s hard but rewarding work–exactly what priests are called to do.\n\nWhy You Should Go to Confession\n\nGod absolving our sins helps us draw nearer to God. Sin distances us from God; the sacrament of reconciliation bridges that gap and better unites us with God.\n\nIn our confession, the priest may suggest ways to avoid sinning in the future, helping us live holier lives each day.\n\nAs the USCCB explains, penance also “challenges us to have the same kind of compassion and forgiveness for those who sin against us.”\n\nIn this way, going to confession can be seen as a selfless act: When we experience God’s love and forgiveness, we’re better prepared to extend those gifts to those around us.\n\nFinding a Time for Confession\n\nChurches usually offer a scheduled time each week for parishioners to receive the sacrament of confession. At smaller churches, you may have to email the pastor to schedule a time.\n\nIf you’re not comfortable going to your own parish for confession, you may explore other churches in your area. It’s better to go to confession at a different church than not to go at all.\n\nIf you’re traveling, some airports have small chapels staffed by Catholic priests. These chapels provide an opportunity for confession during busy work times or before embarking on a big family trip or holiday: great times to receive absolution for your sins.\n\nPriests at these chapels generally are aware that people in the airport have flights to catch, so you can receive the sacrament expediently.\n\nGroup Reconciliation Services\n\nSome parishes will offer communal reconciliation services, especially during the season of Lent.\n\nThese services provide an opportunity to participate in the sacrament of penance, in the context of the larger parish community.\n\nInstead of showing up alone to confession, there’s an entire group of fellow parishioners gathered to do the same. Strength in numbers!\n\nWhile the services invite members of the Church to gather together, they still offer full, individual private confessions. Read the Archdiocese of Chicago’s approach to group reconciliation.\n\nExamples of Sins to Say at Confession\n\nYour sins are entirely personal. There’s no exact guide for what you ought to confess. No universal playbook for the sins you need to atone for.\n\nThe best guide is your conscience.\n\nSpend time examining your conscience to take stock of moments when you’ve missed the mark, distancing yourself from God, the Church and those around you.\n\nThe 10 Commandments can provide a helpful framework for prompting you to think about ways you’ve sinned. It’s best to consider them broadly and not literally.\n\nFor example, with “Thou Shalt Not Kill,” you may have never committed murder, but have you been violent or abusive? Have you injured others with your deeds or words?\n\nDon’t obsess over identifying every small thing that could possibly be considered a sin. Prayerfully reflect on major actions that could be considered sinful through the lens of the 10 Commandments. As you do this, remember God’s love and mercy for you.\n\nWhen you’ve identified a time and place for your confession, and you’ve given some time to reflect on your sins, you’re ready to go to the confessional.\n\nHow to Confess as a Catholic\n\nDeepen your prayer life and draw near to God by praying with Hallow.\n\nMore Prayers"
