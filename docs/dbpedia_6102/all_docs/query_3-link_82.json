This year's gathering comes at a critical time in the relationship between these two regions.\n\nAfrican leaders are looking for ways to move their economies up the value chain in a bid to capture more revenue and generate higher rates of employment, particularly among young people. But to do that requires infrastructure, especially energy. So, they'll be looking to China for financial and technical assistance.\n\nBut those requests will come at a sensitive time for the Chinese whose economy has slowed considerably over the past 10 years. Beijing is no longer writing those big checks to pay for large-scale infrastructure projects in Africa.\n\nSo, it will be critical for African countries to have robust strategic plans going into this year's FOCAC summit, according to Sanusha Naidu, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Global Dialogue in Cape Town. Sanusha joins Eric & Cobus to discuss the need for African strategic thinking towards China and why it's so important.\n\nSHOW NOTES:\n\nChina's Agenda at FOCAC 2024: https://bit.ly/focac9_china Africa's Priorities at FOCAC 2024:Â https://bit.ly/focac9_africa JOIN THE DISCUSSION:\n\nX:Â @ChinaGSProjectÂ |Â @eric_olanderÂ |Â @stadenesque | @sanushanaidu\n\nFacebook:Â www.facebook.com/ChinaAfricaProject\n\nYouTube:Â www.youtube.com/@ChinaGlobalSouth\n\nFOLLOW CAP IN FRENCH AND ARABIC:\n\nFranÃ§ais:Â www.projetafriquechine.comÂ |Â @AfrikChine\n\nArabic: Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ù:Â www.alsin-alsharqalawsat.comÂ | @SinSharqAwsat\n\nJOIN US ON PATREON!\n\nBecome a CAP Patreon member and get all sorts of cool stuff, including our Week in Review report, an invitation to join monthly Zoom calls with Eric & Cobus, and even an awesome new CAP Podcast mug!Â www.patreon.com/chinaglobalsouth\n\nÂ\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has long touted theÂ East's rise and the West's decline, theÂ kind ofÂ thinking that's triggered his supporters to fantasize about a post-Western geopolitical order.\n\nWhile it's indisputable that U.S. and European countries, which represent the foundational pillars of the Western system, have seen their power diminish in the post-Cold War era, there's little credible evidence of a full-blown collapse of Western influence.\n\nInstead, King's College scholar Samir Puri argues in his new bookÂ \"Westlessness,\"Â that the role of the West in the international system is changing andÂ not going away.\n\nSamir joins Eric & Cobus from London to discuss the emergence of a new, less Western global order.\n\nShow Notes:\n\nOrder \"Westlessness\" on Amazon.co.uk JOIN THE DISCUSSION:\n\nX:Â @ChinaGSProjectÂ |Â @eric_olanderÂ |Â @stadenesqueÂ |Â @purisamir1\n\nFacebook:Â www.facebook.com/ChinaAfricaProject\n\nYouTube:Â www.youtube.com/@ChinaGlobalSouth\n\nFOLLOW CAP IN FRENCH AND ARABIC:\n\nFranÃ§ais:Â www.projetafriquechine.comÂ |Â @AfrikChine\n\nArabic: Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ù:Â www.alsin-alsharqalawsat.comÂ | @SinSharqAwsat\n\nJOIN US ON PATREON!\n\nBecome a CAP Patreon member and get all sorts of cool stuff, including our Week in Review report, an invitation to join monthly Zoom calls with Eric & Cobus, and even an awesome new CAP Podcast mug!Â www.patreon.com/chinaglobalsouth\n\nThe Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) summit is now less than a month away. Chinese President Xi Jinping will host dozens of African leaders in Beijing in the first week of September for the triennial gathering that comes at a critical time for African countries and China.\n\nAfrica needs China's support for continued infrastructure financing and to buy more of its goods, while China is looking to Africa as a vital supplier of critical resources and to develop new markets for its cars, solar panels, and other products that are increasingly shut out from G7 countries.\n\nBut with very little visibility into the negotiating positions of the various stakeholders, it's difficult to tell what will emerge from this year's summit. Development Reimagined Policy Analyst Ovigwe Eguegu is closely following African preparations for FOCAC and joins Eric & Cobus to share some of his insights on what to expect.\n\nJOIN THE DISCUSSION:\n\nX:Â @ChinaGSProject | @ovigweeguegu | @stadenesque | @eric_olander\n\nFacebook:Â www.facebook.com/ChinaAfricaProject\n\nYouTube:Â www.youtube.com/@ChinaGlobalSouth\n\nFOLLOW CAP IN FRENCH AND ARABIC:\n\nFranÃ§ais:Â www.projetafriquechine.comÂ |Â @AfrikChine\n\nArabic: Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ù:Â www.alsin-alsharqalawsat.comÂ | @SinSharqAwsat\n\nJOIN US ON PATREON!\n\nBecome a CAP Patreon member and get all sorts of cool stuff, including our Week in Review report, an invitation to join monthly Zoom calls with Eric & Cobus, and even an awesome new CAP Podcast mug!Â www.patreon.com/chinaglobalsouth\n\nU.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week on what the U.S. needs to do to better compete with China in Africa and other developing regions. Campbell bluntly told senators Washington \"has to do better\" to match Chinese finance, trade, and military engagement around the world.\n\nBut the problem for Campbell and other U.S. stakeholders is that it's been difficult to define what success looks like in their bid to out-compete China.\n\nJendayi Frazer, a distinguished visiting fellow at Hoover Institution and adjunct senior fellow for Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, is one of Washington's foremost experts on U.S. foreign policy towards Africa. She speaks from firsthand experience as a former assistant secretary of state and joins CGSP Africa Editor GÃ©raud Neema to explain why it's critical for the U.S. to devote more attention to Africa.\n\nJOIN THE DISCUSSION:\n\nX:Â @ChinaGSProjectÂ |Â @christiangeraud\n\nFacebook:Â www.facebook.com/ChinaAfricaProject\n\nYouTube:Â www.youtube.com/@ChinaGlobalSouth\n\nFOLLOW CAP IN FRENCH AND ARABIC:\n\nFranÃ§ais:Â www.projetafriquechine.comÂ |Â @AfrikChine\n\nArabic: Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ù:Â www.alsin-alsharqalawsat.comÂ | @SinSharqAwsat\n\nJOIN US ON PATREON!\n\nBecome a CAP Patreon member and get all sorts of cool stuff, including our Week in Review report, an invitation to join monthly Zoom calls with Eric & Cobus, and even an awesome new CAP Podcast mug!Â www.patreon.com/chinaglobalsouth\n\nThe foreign ministers from China, the U.S., Japan, and Russia, among others, all passed through the Laotian capital, Vientiane, over the past several days, ostensibly for an ASEAN gathering. But the real action took place on the sidelines of the meeting, where the ministers held a series of bilaterals that revealed the hardening battle lines among the major powers.\n\nThe tense discussions highlight the frontline role that Southeast Asia now plays in this burgeoning geopolitical competition that appears to be intensifying over disputes related to Taiwan, the South China Sea, and surging Chinese influence in the region.\n\nPrashanth Paramaswaran, writer and creator of the popularÂ ASEAN Wonk Substack newsletter, joins Eric to discuss what happened in Vientiane and the latest on the stand-off between Beijing and Manila over territorial rights in the South China Sea.\n\nSHOW NOTES:\n\nASEAN Wonk:Â Why New Japan-Philippines Reciprocal Access Agreement Matters ASEAN Wonk:Â China Crisis Rocks Philippines Second Thomas Shoal Strategy ASEAN Wonk:Â Vietnam Foreign Policy Futures After Nguyen Phu Trong Passing JOIN THE DISCUSSION:\n\nX:Â @ChinaGSProjectÂ |Â @eric_olanderÂ\n\nFacebook:Â www.facebook.com/ChinaAfricaProject\n\nYouTube:Â www.youtube.com/@ChinaGlobalSouth\n\nFOLLOW CAP IN FRENCH AND ARABIC:\n\nFranÃ§ais:Â www.projetafriquechine.comÂ |Â @AfrikChine\n\nArabic: Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ù:Â www.alsin-alsharqalawsat.comÂ | @SinSharqAwsat\n\nJOIN US ON PATREON!\n\nBecome a CAP Patreon member and get all sorts of cool stuff, including our Week in Review report, an invitation to join monthly Zoom calls with Eric & Cobus, and even an awesome new CAP Podcast mug!Â www.patreon.com/chinaglobalsouth\n\nEurope is Africa's largest trading partner and its largest source of foreign direct investment. But a lot of that economic engagement is powered by inertia, left over from Europe's long, painful history of colonial exploitation in Africa.\n\nJust as in the United States, Europe's politics are decidedly inward-looking where Africa, if it's on the agenda at all, is still largely seen as a \"problem to be fixed.\" When policymakers do raise the issue of heightened engagement with the continent, it's often in the context of what the EU can do to counter China's influence in Africa.\n\nA new report published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace aims to change that by outlining a more proactive, positive vision for why Europe should focus more attention on Africa in pursuit of a more balanced relationship.\n\nThe report's editor, David McNair, an executive director at the anti-poverty NGO ONE.org, and contributor Saliem Fakir, executive director of the African Climate Foundation, join Eric & Cobus to discuss why Europe needs Africa.\n\nJOIN THE DISCUSSION:\n\nX:Â @ChinaGSProjectÂ |Â @stadenesqueÂ |Â @christiangeraud\n\nFacebook:Â www.facebook.com/ChinaAfricaProject\n\nYouTube:Â www.youtube.com/@ChinaGlobalSouth\n\nFOLLOW CAP IN FRENCH AND ARABIC:\n\nFranÃ§ais:Â www.projetafriquechine.comÂ |Â @AfrikChine\n\nArabic: Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ù:Â www.alsin-alsharqalawsat.comÂ | @SinSharqAwsat\n\nJOIN US ON PATREON!\n\nBecome a CAP Patreon member and get all sorts of cool stuff, including our Week in Review report, an invitation to join monthly Zoom calls with Eric & Cobus, and even an awesome new CAP Podcast mug!Â www.patreon.com/chinaglobalsouth\n\nÂ"
