        "text": "Globalisation destabilises indigenous cultures from mining in rainforests to the erasure of indigenous identities due to the impact of globalising information technology (IT). Extinguishing these cultures means deleting strategies needed for the survival of humankind. Within its short time of existence, IT has already achieved the creation of virtual environments with virtual agents equipped with artificial intelligence (AI). As a leverage point for reconciling indigenous and globalised views the Simulation Hypothesis is proposed, which postulates that our world has been programmed from a metalevel. This concept assumes a programmer, which is consistent with religion in general, including the rather complex Christian concept of salvation. The perspective of the universe being a complex programme is compatible with indigenous worldviews of the universe being created by the Creator, and thus, with spirituality. It is suggested that IT users should respect indigenous peoples, especially since they pay a very high price for something they hardly enjoy themselves."
