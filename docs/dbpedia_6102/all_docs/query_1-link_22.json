        "text": "WASHINGTON - House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight Chairman Barry Loudermilk (GA-11) obtained documentary footage recorded by Alexandra Pelosi on January 6, 2021 and produced to the Subcommittee by HBO.\n\nVice-chair Liz Cheney and Chair Bennie Thompson's J6 Select Committee had this footage but did not release it publicly and did not archive this footage at the end of the 117th Congress or hand it over when Republicans took the majority at the beginning of 2023. Therefore, the Subcommittee went directly to HBO to obtain the footage.\n\nYesterday, the Subcommittee posted this video from January 6, 2021, which was recorded by Alexandra Pelosi and provided directly to the Subcommittee by HBO. In the video former Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated \"I take responsibility\" for the security failures of the Capitol that day.\n\n“As Nancy Pelosi was being evacuated from the Capitol on January 6, 2021 she admitted that, as Speaker of the House, she was responsible for the security failures, and for not having the National Guard at the Capitol,” said Chairman Loudermilk.\n\n“However, after the dust settled from the breach of the Capitol, she spent 20 million taxpayer dollars for her January 6 Select Committee to create a narrative that shifted the blame on President Trump. The Democrats’ partisan select committee went to great lengths to suppress and hide evidence that didn’t support their predetermined narrative about that day, including this video of Speaker Pelosi admitting that she was responsible for the security failures at the Capitol. My committee will continue to investigate and expose all the facts. The American people deserve the truth.”\n\nThis video shows Pelosi in a moment of leadership acknowledging that as Speaker of the House it was her responsibility to ensure the safety of Members of Congress that day and every other day. However, Pelosi never publicly took responsibility. Instead, Pelosi created the January 6 Select Committee with the purpose of publicly blaming Donald Trump for her own failures.\n\nDespite Pelosi’s claims yesterday on MSNBC that Republicans are engaging in revisionist history, this clip proves what Republicans have said for three years: it is Pelosi who has been determined to revise history and shift the blame away from herself for security failures at the Capitol on January 6.\n\nClick here to view the letter sent to HBO."
