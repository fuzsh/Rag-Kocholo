        "text": "The Irishman audience members born after Jimmy Hoffa’s mysterious 1975 disappearance might walk into movie theaters this weekend expecting the Martin Scorsese epic unspooling onscreen to be rooted in truth—and for understandable reasons. The anticipated $175 million reunion between Scorsese and Robert De Niro arrives at the peak of pop culture’s obsession with true-crime content—and ventures a solution to one of the most notorious unsolved crimes, with Al Pacino playing Hoffa himself. News outlets like CBS have only fueled this assumption, claiming that the film “chronicles the true story of Frank Sheeran”—the real-life truck driver De Niro plays. But The Irishman is merely based on Sheeran’s account of what happened leading up to Hoffa’s disappearance and with the vanishing itself—a “laughable” story that found zero merit with a number of FBI agents, prosecutors, reporters, and criminals who knew Sheeran. When Charles Brandt published his 2004 book, I Heard You Paint Houses, on which The Irishman is based, even Publishers Weekly saw through the claims, concluding that the book was “long on sensational claims and short on credibility.” When investigative reporter Dan Moldea bumped into De Niro in 2014, he warned the actor about adapting such a flimsy account of Hoffa’s death for the screen. “I told him, ‘Bob, you’re being conned,’” Moldea told The Daily Beast. “I told him in no uncertain terms, ‘Bob, you are being conned.’”\n\nHarvard Law School professor Jack L. Goldsmith has spent the last seven years studying the Hoffa disappearance—poring over government and court records, studying FBI wiretap transcripts, and interviewing myriad FBI agents and prosecutors. Speaking to Vanity Fair about his research—which yielded his new book, In Hoffa’s Shadow—Goldsmith concluded, “There’s absolutely no basis for Sheeran’s claim and a lot of reasons to think it’s preposterous.” Goldsmith has spent a longer time—nearly two decades—grappling with the Hoffa mystery because of a personal connection to the case: He believes his now-85-year-old stepfather, Charles “Chuckie” O’Brien, Hoffa’s right-hand man (played in The Irishman by Jesse Plemons), was falsely accused of driving Hoffa to his killers. Goldsmith has said that his stepfather’s life was ruined after the FBI named him as an initial suspect. In the ’90s, according to Goldsmith, the FBI began doubting O’Brien’s involvement—“but the government never changed the public story,” Goldsmith told the Harvard Gazette. “So to this very day, when you [search online] any discussion of the Hoffa disappearance, it says that Chuckie drove him to his death.”\n\nGoldsmith has been open about the fact that he did not always get along with, or even believe, O’Brien—and severed ties with his stepfather when Goldsmith was in his mid-20s and embarking on a legal career. But after discovering that his stepfather had been correct about certain government surveillance abuses—claims Goldsmith had initially dismissed as “uninformed and self-serving”—Goldsmith set out on a quest to correct the public narrative about his stepfather. “I thought I could give him a much fairer shake. . .than the way he had been treated by the public and in the press,” Goldsmith told the Harvard Gazette.\n\nBut the release of The Irishman will only revive those decades-old accusations: Plemons’s O’Brien is shown driving Hoffa to his death. Goldsmith had not yet seen the film when speaking to Vanity Fair but was concerned about his stepfather being implicated in a film that would return the Hoffa disappearance to public consciousness. “Very few people under 50 years old know who Jimmy Hoffa is,” Goldsmith said. “That’s all going to change because of the movie.… It’s a huge movie, and it’s going to dominate the popular culture and the popular understanding of Chuckie.”\n\nGoldsmith pointed out that Sheeran’s account is one in “a circus of claims about what happened to Hoffa. There have been dozens of people who claim to have known what happened to him and where he’s buried,” Goldsmith said. “Several people have confessed to the crime. There are all sorts of theories about it. The FBI has dug up various places over a dozen times looking for his body.” Goldsmith discredited Sheeran’s account in the New York Review of Books—pointing out that, within six months of Sheeran’s death, three conflicting confessions surfaced. In one confession Sheeran claimed to have disposed of Hoffa’s body after someone else killed him. In another confession Sheeran claimed to have shot Hoffa in a car and driven his body to an undisclosed location. In the third confession—extracted by Brandt, a Delaware medical malpractice attorney, across multiple conversations—Sheeran claimed to have shot Hoffa in the back of the head before other men took his body to be cremated. Because Sheeran’s confession to Brandt also involved a letter from Hoffa later found to be forged, Goldsmith wrote, Brandt’s first publisher backed out of the project.\n\n“Brandt never published the entire confession video,” Goldsmith wrote, “but on request he gave a copy to FBI agent Andrew Sluss, in 2008. At that time Sluss had been the lead investigator on the Hoffa case for almost 15 years, and knew it better than anyone. He viewed the tape carefully several times, but immediately concluded that Sheeran’s story lacked all credibility. ‘Seeing is believing, except in this case, then seeing becomes disbelieving,’ Sluss told me, some years ago. ‘The video I saw of Sheeran was a laughable, sad, desperate attempt to create a record.’”\n\nReporter Bill Tonelli also investigated the Sheeran confession for Slate, interviewing police, prosecutors, reporters, and criminals in Philadelphia. “Not a single person I spoke with who knew Sheeran from Philly…could remember even a suspicion that he had ever killed anyone,” Tonelli reported. Former FBI agent John Tamm told Tonelli the confession was “baloney, beyond belief…Frank Sheeran was a full-time criminal, but I don’t know of anybody he personally ever killed, no.” Alleged former Philadelphia mob boss John Carlyle Berkery put it another way to Tonelli: “Frank Sheeran never killed a fly. The only things he ever killed were countless jugs of red wine.”\n\nBut the credibility of Sheeran’s confession is not referenced in a title card ahead of the film. The film is essentially—like Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood before it—historical fiction involving real-life characters. Irishman star Robert De Niro has said in press interviews that he believes Sheeran’s account—and so connected with I Heard You Paint Houses that he showed the book to Scorsese and and helped will the $175 million project into existence. But Scorsese has said the veracity of Sheeran’s confession is beside the point of The Irishman. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Scorsese said he “[doesn’t] really care about” the truth of what happened to Hoffa. “What would happen if we knew exactly how the JFK assassination was worked out? What does it do? It gives us a couple of good articles, a couple of movies and people talking about [it] at dinner parties. The point is, it’s not about the facts. It’s the world [the characters are] in, the way they behave. It’s about [a character] stuck in a certain situation. You’re obligated to behave a certain way and you realize you may have made a mistake.”\n\nBut speaking to Vanity Fair, Goldsmith said he thinks the filmmaker “should care. Because he is falsely portraying a living person, Chuckie O’Brien, in a crime O’Brien did not commit.”"
