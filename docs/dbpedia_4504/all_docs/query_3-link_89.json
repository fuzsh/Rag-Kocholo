Although the ballet scenario was worked out after the music had been composed, Carpenter planned from the beginning to capture the dynamics of Americans at work and at play. He opens and closes with a depiction of a futuristic work-world in city-noir style, its chaos and demands symbolized by a stalking skyscraper, provocatively described as \"huge and sinistera stark and ominous skeleton of black and red.\" Here trumpets bleat like automobiles, pianos and xylophone pound the pavement, smoke and steel sulfurate through strings and winds. All this frenetic activity culminates in the \"Song of the Skyscraper,\" a primal pseudo-Native American (\"Indianist\") theme introduced by French horns.\n\n-- In Skyscrapers, Carpenter shows how much the machines of work and play share the hard-edged ambience of modernity-- steel beams, elevators, roller coaster tracks, and ferris wheels traveling upward and onward into uncertainty. Skyscrapers may not sparkle with the street-smart optimism of Gershwin, but it captures the gritty intensity of Carl Sandburg's Chicago mixed with Broadway pathos. As Elliott Carter wrote, \"In spirit close to the Reginald Marsh and Dos Passos pictures of the American 1920s, [Skyscrapers] evokes just as keenly as they do that boisterous brutal era of the mechanical heart.\"\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amUUXWIUv8Q\"]YouTube - John Alden Carpenter - Ballet Skyscrapers (1/3)[/ame]\n\nin 1955 - Gisele Ben-Dor (nee Buka), Uruguayan conductor of Polish descent, is born at Montevideo.

He first studied voice, violin, and drumming at home with his father, V. Lakshminarayana (d. Dec. 3,1990), and mother, L. Seethlakshmi; then went to the U.S., where he earned his Ph.D. at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn. (1974). With the English-Irish composer Caroline, he formed the pop group the Epidemics in 1980, bringing together in its performances and recordings a variety of genres, including classical Indian, folk, pop, and Western; is also active with his own Indian classical group, Shankar. He invented the Ten String Stereophonic Double Violin, a double-bodied instrument that, when both necks are played simultaneously, is capable of producing all the tones of the orchestra string family; when the necks are played separately, the strings of the one not played respond sympathetically. The instrument made its debut in Shankar's Ragam Tanam Pallavi Ragam Hemmavthi for Double Violin and South and North Indian Drums (1980), which appeared on the album Who's to Know, other albums include Palghat Mani Tyer (2 vols.), Pancha Nadai Pallavi, and Eye Catcher.

Aaron was sent for medical studies to Zürich, where his musical interests blossomed. He attended the Zürich Conservatory briefly—which constituted his only formal musical education. After the October Revolution, in 1917, which made further studies in Europe impossible, his family sent him to the United States—via Manchuria and northern China. Less than a year later, having married a fellow Russian émigré in San Francisco, he chose to return to China. Apart from a short period in the mid-1920s, when he spent three years in Portland, Oregon, Avshalomov remained in China until 1947. For a number of years he lived in Peking, where he worked for China Booksellers and then for Libraire Française. Despite his lack of musical training—apart from the one term in Zürich— he began composing. He developed an approach that grafted elements of traditional Chinese music—which he had first encountered as a child among the Chinese community of his Siberian hometown—onto a colorful Russian style in the manner of Rimsky-Korsakov. He used the Western-oriented symphony orchestra to imitate and evoke sounds of traditional Chinese instruments, and he also transcribed characteristic ornamentations and used such instruments as temple blocks and finger cymbals. Among his first works of this type was an opera, Kuan Yin, which was premiered in Peking in 1925.\n\nAvshalomov achieved some performances of his works in America during his stay there in the 1920s, but he was unable to establish either a position or a significant reputation in the United States, and he returned to China in 1929. He settled in Shanghai, where there was an established Jewish community, and he became the head librarian of the municipal library and, in 1943, conductor of the Shanghai City Symphony. His works during this second period in China include concertos for violin and piano and two additional operas: The Twilight Hour of Yan Kuei Fei (1933) and The Great Wall (1933–41), which was premiered there in 1945.\n\nDuring the period of the Japanese invasion and occupation of China, and then the Second World War, Avshalomov lived there under house arrest. His son, the composer Jacob Avshalomov, had been born in 1919 in China but had emigrated to the United States in 1937, and after the war his father joined him—this time remaining permanently.\n\nIn his initial postwar years in America, Aaron Avshalomov saw the premiere of his Dream of Wei Lin; and his Second Symphony (1949) was commissioned by Serge Koussevitzky. But once again he was unable to parlay those achievements into further success or to gain the recognition warranted by his obvious gifts. He remains a composer whose legacy awaits deserved rediscovery.\n\nVideo Note: Peking Hutungs: Symphonic Poem on Chinese Street Sounds and Cries (1931) -- Portland Youth Phlharmonic diretta da Jacob Avshalomov.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXtZpr8Ruwo\"]Aaron Avshalomov: Peking Hutungs (1931) - YouTube[/ame]\n\nin 1966 - Dusty Springfield was at No.1 on the UK singles chart with 'You Don't Have To Say You Love Me', the singers only UK No.1.\n\nin 1967 - Mamas and the Papas singer Mama Cass gave birth to a daughter, Owen Vanessa, in Los Angeles.\n\nin 1969 - The Original Cast of 'Hair' started a 13-week run at No.1 on the US album chart.\n\nin 1969 - During the bands second North American tour Led Zeppelin played the second of two nights at The Winterland Ballroom, San Francisco in California.\n\nin 1972 - Margaret A R Bonds, US pianist/composer/arranger, dies at 59.\n\nin 1975 - BJ Thomas went to No.1 on the US singles chart with '(Hey Won't You Play), Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song'.

With recordings that spanned 50 years, including No. 1 singles \"White Lightning,\" \"She Thinks I Still Care\" and \"He Stopped Loving Her Today,\" Jones influenced generations of country singers and was considered by many to be the greatest of them all.\n\nHis life also included legendary battles with substance abuse, mostly alcohol, and four marriages, including one to fellow singer Tammy Wynette, and another, his last and longest, to Nancy Sepulvado.\n\nUltimately, though, it was that voice that won Jones two Grammys, got him into the Country Music Hall of Fame and made him an American musical icon. It seemed to break down at will and wallow in sorrow, delivering a thrill ride of emotions filled with twists and turns, bending notes and sudden drops.\n\nBefore being hospitalized, Jones was on his farewell tour, and a final, all-star concert was scheduled for Nov. 22 in Nashville. His final Michigan concert was in September at the Little River Casino in Manistee, and his last metro Detroit performance was at Southgate's Crystal Gardens in 2006.\n\nJones was also a three-time performer at Detroit's Downtown Hoedown through the years — including 1996, when ex-wife Wynette was a last-minute addition to the bill and wound up slotted immediately before him.\n\nFans arrived hoping that night hoping for an impromptu musical reunion of the famously tempestuous lovers. It didn't happen, but backstage at Hart Plaza, the two shared a brief but seemingly cordial exchange as they brushed shoulders during the set changeover.\n\nCountry superstar Garth Brooks has often told the story of his own inaugural Hoedown gig, when he played the fest in 1989 as a virtual unknown. Retiring to his hotel room at the Renaissance Center overlooking Hart Plaza, he glanced down to see Jones on the stage he'd just played on — and was moved to tears as he realized he was now moving in the same musical circles as a childhood icon.\n\nJones placed multiple singles on the country charts in the '60s (\"If My Heart Had Windows,\" \"The Race Is On,\" \"Walk Through This World With Me\") prior to his 1969 marriage to Wynette. He soon followed Wynette to Epic Records and began working with her producer, Billy Sherrill, who would be responsible for Jones' biggest hits of the '70s and '80s. Jones and Wynette recorded a series of duet singles (\"Golden Ring,\" \"We're Gonna Hold On\") that outlined a fictive version of the couple's often-volatile relationship.\n\nJones' greatest artistic achievement came in 1980 with the release of Sherrill-produced single \"He Stopped Loving Her Today,\" widely considered to be the greatest country record ever made and one that, according to many involved with its creation, took more than a year to get on tape because Jones was so wrecked by cocaine and bourbon.\n\n\"He said I'll love you 'til I die/She told him you'll forget in time,\" Jones sang as he began the tune, needing only 3 minutes and 15 seconds to convey a lifetime of emotional devastation.\n\n\"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" revived Jones' career and perhaps saved his life. It gave him his first No. 1 hit in five years and won four awards from the Country Music Association, including song of the year. It also gave him the first of his two Grammys. (He won again in 2000 for \"Choices.\")\n\nJones' reputation for missing concerts dogged him for much of his career and led to the notorious nickname No-Show Jones. But the country star could also deliver the goods when it counted.\n\nBooked to play Soaring Eagle Casino in Mt. Pleasant two days after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, Jones was stymied by the grounding of air traffic, and casino staffers prepared to announce the show's cancellation. Then they got a call from his tour manager: \"He's backing up the old tour bus and is on the way from Nashville.\"\n\n\"He played to a sold-out crowd, brought out the flag, and closed with 'Proud to Be An American,' \" recalled former Soaring Eagle executive Mike Thomas. \"There wasn't a dry eye in the venue. It was pretty remarkable.\" Brian Mansfield, special to USA TODAY, contributed.\n\n26 APRIL\n\npage 2 of 2\n\n27 APRIL\n\nPage 1 of 2\n\nin 1623 - Johann Adam Reincken, composer is born.\n\nin 1950 - Adam Tadeusz Wieniawski, composer, dies at 70.\n\nin 1724 - Ferdinand Philipp Joseph Lobkowitz, composer is born.\n\nin 1758 - Jan Francisci, composer, dies at 66.\n\nin 1764 - Jaime de Casellas, composer, dies at 73.\n\nin 1767 - Andreas Jakob Romberg, German violinist/composer (Song of the Clock) is born.\n\nin 1802 - Abraham Louis Niedermeyer, composer is born.\n\nin 1803 - Alfred Julius Becher, composer is born.\n\nin 1812 - Friedrich von Flotow, composer is born.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NL9ujOdHG4\"]YouTube - Friedrich von Flotow - Jubel Ouverture\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube - Friedrich von Flotow - Jubel Ouverture[/ame]​\n\nin 1824 - William Richard Bexfield, composer is born.\n\nin 1861 - Georgy L'vovich Catoire, composer is born.\n\nin 1867 - Opera \"Romeo et Juliette\" is produced (Paris).\n\nin 1869 - William Victor Harris, composer is born.\n\nin 1871 - Arthur Finlay Nevin, composer is born.\n\nin 1871 - Sigismond Fortune Francois Thalberg, composer, dies at 59.\n\nin 1877 - Opera \"Le Roi de Lahore\" is produced (Paris).\n\nin 1891 - Sergei (Sergeievich) Prokofiev, great Russian composer of modern times, creator of new and original formulas of rhythmic, melodic, and harmonic combinations that became the recognized style of his music, is born at Sontsovka, near Ekaterinoslav.\n\nHis mother was born a serf in 1859, 2 years before the emanicipation of Russian serfdom, and she assumed (as was the custom) the name of the estate where she was born, Sontsov. Prokofiev was born on that estate on April 27, 1891, although he himself erroneously believed that the date was April 23; the correct date was established with the discovery of his birth certificate.\n\nHe received his first piano lessons from his mother, who was an amateur pianist; he improvised several pieces, and then composed a children's opera, The Giant (1900), which was performed in a domestic version. Following his bent for the theater, he put together 2 other operas, On Desert Islands (1902) and Ondine (1904-07); fantastic subjects obviously possessed his childish imagination. He was 11 years old when he met the great Russian master, Taneyev, who arranged for him to take systematic private lessons with Gliere, who became his tutor at Sontsovka during the summers of 1903 and 1904 and by correspondence during the intervening winter. Under Gliere's knowledgeable guidance in theory and harmony, Prokofiev composed a sym. in piano version and still another opera, Plague, based upon a poem by Pushkin.\n\nFinally, in 1904, at the age of 13, he enrolled in the St. Petersburg Conservatory, where he studied composition with Liadov and piano with Alexander Winkler; later he was accepted by no less a master than Rimsky-Korsakov, who instructed him in orchestration. He also studied conducting with Nikolai Tcherepnin, and form with Wihtol. Further, he entered the piano class of Anna Essipova. During the summers, he returned to Sontsovka or traveled in the Caucasus and continued to compose, already in quite an advanced style; the Moscow publisher Jurgenson accepted his first work, a piano sonata, for publication; it was premiered in Moscow on March 6,1910.\n\nIt was then that Prokofiev made his first visit to Paris, London, and Switzerland (1913); in 1914 he graduated from the St. Petersburg Conservatory, receiving the Anton Rubinstein Prize (a grand piano) as a pianist-composer with his Piano Concerto No. 1, which he performed publicly at the graduation concert. Because of audacious innovations in his piano music (he wrote one piece in which the right and left hands played in different keys), he was described in the press as a \"futurist/' and because of his addiction to dissonant and powerful harmonic combinations, some critics dismissed his works as \"football music.\" This idiom was explicitly demonstrated in his Sarcasms and Visions fugitives, percussive and sharp, yet not lacking in lyric charm.\n\nGrotesquerie and irony animated his early works; he also developed a strong attraction toward subjects of primitive character. His important orchestra work, the Scythian Suite (arr. from music written for a ballet, Ala and Lolly, 1915), draws upon a legend of ancient Russian sun-worship rituals. While a parallel with Stravinsky's Le Sacre du printemps may be drawn, there is no similarity between the styles of the 2 works. The original performance of the Scythian Suite, scheduled at a Koussevitzky concert in Moscow, was canceled on account of the disruption caused by war, which did not prevent the otherwise intelligent Russian music critic Sabaneyev, blissfully unaware that the announced premiere had been canceled, from delivering a blast of the work as a farrago of atrocious noises. (Sabaneyev was forced to resign his position after this episode.)\n\nAnother Prokofiev score, primitivistic in its inspiration, was the cantata Seven, They Are Seven, based upon incantations from an old Sumerian religious ritual. During the same period, Prokofiev wrote his famous Classical Symphony (1916-17), in which he adopted with remarkable acuity the formal style of Haydn's music. While the structure of the work was indeed classical, the sudden modulatory shifts and subtle elements of grotesquerie revealed decisively a new modern art. After conducting the premiere of his Classical Symphony in Petrograd on April 21, 1918, Prokofiev left Russia by way of Siberia and Japan for the U.S. (the continuing war in Europe prevented him from traveling westward).\n\nHe gave concerts of his music in Japan and later in the U.S., playing his first solo concert in N.Y. on Oct. 29,1918. Some American critics greeted his appearance as the reflection of the chaotic events of Russia in revolution, and Prokofiev himself was described as a \"ribald and Bolshevist innovator and musical agitator.\" \"Every rule in the realm of traditional music writing was broken by Prokofiev,\" one N.Y. writer complained. \"Dissonance followed dissonance in a fashion inconceivable to ears accustomed to melody and harmonic laws.\" Prokofiev's genteel Classical Symphony struck some critics as \"an orgy of dissonant sound, an exposition of the unhappy state of chaos from which Russia suffers.\" One N.Y. critic indulged in the following: \"Crashing Siberians, volcano hell, Krakatoa, sea-bottom crawlers. Incomprehensible? So is Prokofiev.\"\n\nBut another critic issued a word of caution, suggesting that \"Prokofiev might be the legitimate successor of Borodin, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov.\" The critic was unintentionally right; Prokofiev is firmly enthroned in the pantheon of Russian music. In 1920 Prokofiev settled in Paris, where he established an association with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, which produced his ballets Chout (a French transliteration of the Russian word for buffoon), Le Pas d'acier (descriptive of the industrial development in Soviet Russia), and L'Enfant prodigue. In 1921 Prokofiev again visited the U.S. for the production of the opera commissioned by the Chicago Opera Co.,\n\nThe Love for 3 Oranges. In 1927 he was invited to be the pianist for a series of his own works in Russia. He gave a number of concerts in Russia again in 1929, and eventually decided to remain there. In Russia he wrote some of his most popular works, including the symphonic fairy tale Peter and the Wolf, staged by a children's theater in Moscow, the historical cantata Alexander Nevsky, the ballet Romeo and Juliet, and the opera War and Peace. Unexpectedly, Prokofiev became the target of the so-called proletarian group of Soviet musicians who accused him of decadence, a major sin in Soviet Russia at the time.\n\nHis name was included in the official denunciation of modern Soviet composers issued by reactionary Soviet politicians in 1948. He meekly confessed that he had been occasionally interested in atonal and polytonal devices during his stay in Paris, but insisted that he had never abandoned the ideals of classical Russian music. Indeed, when he composed his 7th Sym., he described it specifically as a youth sym., reflecting the energy and ideals of new Russia.\n\nThere were also significant changes in his personal life. He separated from his Spanish-born wife, the singer Lina Llubera, the mother of his 2 sons, and established a companionship with Myra Mendelson, a member of the Young Communist League. She was a writer and assisted him on the libretto of his War and Peace. He made one final attempt to gain favor with the Soviet establishment by writing an opera based on a heroic exploit of a Soviet pilot during the war against the Nazis. But this, too, was damned by the servile Communist press as lacking in true patriotic spirit, and the opera was quickly removed from the repertory. Prokofiev died of heart failure on March 5, 1953, a few hours before the death of Stalin. Curiously enough, the anniversary of Prokofiev's death is duly commemorated, while that of his once powerful nemesis is officially allowed to be forgotten. O. Prokofiev translated and edited his Soviet Diary, 1927, and Other Writings (London, 1991). Died at Moscow, March 5,1953.\n\nVideo Notes by Mark Arnest: \"Though Prokofiev is rightly remembered as a composer rather than as pianist, he was in many respects an ideal interpreter of his music. He played with more finesse - and less brute force - than many of his modern interpreters. This means Prokofiev's records lack the element of sheer adrenalin that, for instance, William Kapell brought to the 3rd Concerto; but they're nevertheless exciting, clear and intelligent - without ever seeming cerebral or systematic. He makes the Visions Fugitives sound as ephemeral as their name implies.(...)\n\n-- Prokofiev's melodic accents usually fall on strong beats, and frequently on long notes. Surprisingly, he accents few syncopated notes, making them even more striking when they occur. His accents are virtually always dynamic, and only occasionally agogic. It's an architectural approach aiming at a clear rhythmic structure. Prokofiev wanted the listener to feel the downbeat.(...)\n\n-- Poulenc likened Prokofiev's playing to \"the steady unwinding of a precision clockwork motor spring\" and said that Prokofiev performed his own music \"very straightforwardly...Rubato made his flesh creep.\" (Quoted in Horowitz, The Ivory Trade, p. 97.) But we must read Poulenc's statement in the context of a time when the sense of pulse was much more supple. Compared to Paderewski, Prokofiev's playing is indeed straight; compared to most modern performances of his music, it contains a wealth of rhythmic inflections.\n\nSome of these inflections fall under the category of style, such as the rushed eighth notes in Visions Fugitives, #6. These upbeats are shortened to give added emphasis to the following downbeats. Prokofiev generally rushes short groups of notes that form upbeats, arriving at the downbeat slightly early. Examples include Visions Fugitives no. 5, 10, and 11.\"\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVd1nYrS50M\"]YouTube - Prokofiev plays Prokofiev Visions Fugitives\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube - Prokofiev plays Prokofiev Visions Fugitives[/ame]\n\nin 1894 - Nicolas Slonimsky, composer is born.\n\nin 1901 - Richard Redhead, composer, dies at 81.\n\nin 1904 - Syd Nathan (SYDNEY NATHAN) is born. Crucial to the rise of R&B in the late Forties was the eccentric owner of the Cincinnati-based King-Federal Records. A one-man operation, the label was the brainchild of a registered blind, guitar-chomping asthmatic named Syd Nathan. After his Florida photo developing business went bankrupt, Nathan returned to his home city of Cincinnati in 1939, where he opened a record store, selling used jukebox records he'd purchased for two cents each.\n\nOverwhelmed by the demand, Nathan realised the potential profit in manufacturing his own discs and built his own record plant, with the aid of five investors who poured $25,000 into a former ice warehouse. An extremely frugal entrepreneur, Nathan refused to outsource any of the work involved in making a record, except for the inner LP sleeves. In 1946, King split into two divisions; while the King label continued its output of \"hillbilly\" records, the new Queen label was launched to issue jazz and \"race\" records, beginning with R&B shouter Bull Moose Jackson.\n\nBy 1947, Nathan supplemented the King-Queen portfolio by purchasing master discs from competitors and expanding into the exploding gospel market with acts such as The Wings Over Jordan Choir. Merging the Queen subsidiary back into King Records, the label achieved R&B chart action with pioneering hits like Wynonie Harris' 'Good Rockin' Tonight'. Capitalising on the booming R&B market, Nathan bought out several competitors, including DeLuxe, Miracle, Bethlehem, Rockin' and Glory Records and, overwhelmed by the success of King's R&B roster, launched another subsidiary, Federal Records, headed by producer Ralph Bass.\n\nBass' first success at Federal came with the bawdy, much-banned single, 'Sixty Minute Man' by The Dominoes, the best-selling R&B hit of 1951. Besides Bass, Nathan surrounded himself with a host of talented managers: Henry Stone, Seymour Stein, and a pioneering black record executive, Henry Glover. By the early Fifties, the King-Federal roster included The Dominoes, Hank Ballard & The Midnighters, Charles Brown, Freddy King, Earl Bostic, Little Willie John, Roy Brown and The \"5\" Royales. In 1956, King achieved crossover success with 'Please, Please, Please', the début release by newcomer James Brown.\n\nOperating a massive distribution network, Nathan managed to thrive at a time when other independent labels were selling out to the majors but, when accused in 1960 of making payola payments to deejays, Nathan and King Records never recovered. Except for James Brown who kept the label afloat, King had little success in the Sixties and, out of economic necessity, Nathan was forced in 1967 to merge King with Starday Records. After Nathan's death the following year, King was sold to Starday, which shut down the Cincinnati studio in 1970. In poor health for several years, he succumbed to heart disease compounded by pneumonia. He died in Miami, March 5, 1968.\n\nin 1905 - Philip Radcliffe, composer is born.\n\nin 1915 - Alexander N Skriabin, Russ pianist/composer (Prometheus), dies at 43.\n\nin 1916 - Jan Rychlik, composer is born.\n\nin 1918 - Kirby Stone, NYC, jazz combo leader (Baubles Bangles and Beads) is born.\n\nin 1918 - Willem N \"Pim\" Koot, pianist of Concert building (Oh, ....! ....!) is born.\n\nin 1927 - Connie Kay, jazz drummer is born.\n\nin 1931 - Igor Oistrach, Russian violinist/son of David Oistrach is born.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJsy9TPSbls\"]YouTube - Igor Oistrakh: Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in G minor, Op. 26 - Movement 1 (Bruch)\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube - Igor Oistrakh: Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in G minor, Op. 26 - Movement 1 (Bruch)[/ame]\n\nin 1939 - Jimmy Cross is born.A singer-songwriter, Jimmy Cross scored a minor hit in 1965 with the necro-rock, novelty classic 'I Want My Baby Back'.

He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. On the fall of France in 1940, Olivier was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his Quatuor pour la fin du temps/\"Quartet for the end of time\" for the 4 available instruments—piano, violin, cello and clarinet.\n\nThe piece was first performed by himself and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards. He was appointed professor of harmony soon after his release in 1941, and professor of composition in 1966 at the Paris Conservatoire, positions he held until his retirement in 1978. His many distinguished pupils included Pierre Boulez and Yvonne Loriod, who became his second wife. He found birdsong fascinating, believed birds to be the greatest musicians, and considered himself as much an ornithologist as a composer.\n\nHe notated bird songs worldwide and incorporated birdsong transcriptions into most of his music. Although in considerable pain near the end of his life, requiring repeated surgery on his back, he was able to fulfil a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Éclairs sur l'au-delà…, which was premièred six months after his death\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv67YkOWJNA\"]YouTube - Messiaen - Turangalîla Symphonie - 5th Movt - Aimard, Davis\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube - Messiaen - Turangalîla Symphonie - 5th Movt - Aimard, Davis[/ame]\n\nin 1993 - Prince issued a statement saying he was retiring from studio recordings to concentrate on film and other ventures.\n\nin 1994 - Chicago scored their third US No.1 album with 'Chicago VII'.\n\nin 1994 - A man was arrested after breaking into Ace Of Base singer Jenny Berggren's home.

After a stint in the US Army during World War II, Al performed with various Swing big bands, including those of Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, and Ina Ray Hutton.\n\nIn 1950, he became first trumpet and soloist with Horace Heidt's Orchestra. Returning then to New Orleans, he worked with various Dixieland groups and leading his own bands.

A British singer-guitarist, Belfast-born Ernie Graham broke into music in 1965 as a member of a local beat band, Tony & The Tellstars. Graham and future Wings' guitarist Henry McCulloch subsequently formed The People (not the American band of the same name) who were managed by ex-Jimi Hendrix roadie and future Stiff Records' co-founder Dave Robinson, and renamed Eire Apparent. Sharing the same management as Jimi Hendrix, the group toured with him, as well as Pink Floyd and Soft Machine. Eire Apparent recorded only one album, the Hendrix-produced Sunrise (1969), but it sold poorly resulting in their disbanding in 1969. While working on an album with the Welsh group Help Yourself, Graham enlisted his bandmates (as well as members of Brinsley Schwarz) to back him on a folk-rock solo project issued in 1971, but it sold poorly. Meanwhile, Help Yourself's folk-meets-hard rock self-titled début album was also a commercial disappointment and Graham left during the sessions of their psychedelic second album, Strange Affair. Teaming with Martin Belmont and other musicians, Graham then formed Clancy, who issued a pair of soul-flavoured rock albums on Warner Brothers. Graham's final recording, a cover of Phil Lynott's 'Romeo And The Lonely ....', was released in 1978 on Stiff Records. - Born June 14, 1946.\n\nin 2003 - UK boy band Busted went to No.1 on the UK singles chart with 'You Said No.' Also on this day the band appeared at Birmingham NIA, England with S Club 7, Dannii Minogue, .....

(Russian: Мстисла́в Леопо́льдович Ростропо́вич, Mstislav Leopol'dovič Rostropovič, pronounced [rəstrɐˈpɔvʲɪtɕ]; was a Soviet and Russian cellist and conductor. He was married to the soprano Galina Vishnevskaya. He is widely considered to have been the greatest cellist of the second half of the 20th century, and one of the greatest of all time. In addition to his outstanding interpretations and technique, he was well known for both inspiring and commissioning new works which enlarged the cello repertoire more than any cellist before or since. He gave the premieres of over 100 pieces, forming long-standing friendships and artistic partnerships with composers including Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev, Henri Dutilleux, Witold Lutoslawski, Alfred Schnittke, Andreas Makris and especially Benjamin Britten.\n\nRostropovich was internationally recognized as a staunch advocate of human rights, and was awarded the 1974 Award of the International League of Human Rights.\n\nRostropovich was born in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, USSR, to parents who had moved from Orenburg. Rostropovich was of mostly ethnic Russian ancestry; his father, Leopold Vitoldovich Rostropovich, was also partly of Belarusian-Polish noble descent. That part of his family bore the Bogorya coat of arms, which was located at the family palace in Skotniki, Masovian Voivodeship. He grew up in Baku and spent his youth there. During World War II his family moved back to Orenburg and then in 1943 to Moscow.\n\nAt the age of four, Rostropovich learned the piano with his mother, Sofiya Nikolaevna Fedotova, a talented pianist. He began the cello at the age of 10 with his father, who was a renowned cellist and former student of Pau Casals.\n\nIn 1943, at the age of 16, he entered the Moscow Conservatory, where he studied cello, piano, conducting and composition. His teachers included Dmitri Shostakovich. In 1945 he came to prominence as a cellist when he won the gold medal in the first ever Soviet Union competition for young musicians. He graduated from the Conservatory in 1948, and became professor of cello there in 1956.\n\nRostropovich gave his first cello concert in 1942. He won first prize at the international Music Awards of Prague and Budapest in 1947, 1949 and 1950. In 1950, at the age of 23 he was awarded what was then considered the highest distinction in the Soviet Union, the Stalin Prize. At that time, Rostropovich was already well known in his country and while actively pursuing his solo career, he taught at the Leningrad (Saint-Petersburg) Conservatory and the Moscow Conservatory. In 1955, he married Galina Vishnevskaya, a leading soprano at the Bolshoi Theatre.\n\nRostropovich had working relationships with Soviet composers of the era. In 1949 Sergei Prokofiev wrote his Cello Sonata in C, Op. 119, for the 22-year old Rostropovich, who gave the first performance in 1950, with Sviatoslav Richter. Prokofiev also dedicated his Sinfonia Concertante for cello to him; this was premiered in 1952. Rostropovich and Dmitry Kabalevsky completed Prokofiev's Cello Concertino after the composer's death. Dmitri Shostakovich wrote both his first and second cello concertos for Rostropovich, who also gave their first performances.\n\nHis international career started in 1963 in the Conservatoire of Liège (with Kirill Kondrashin) and in 1964 in West Germany. Rostropovich went on several tours in Western Europe and met several composers, including Benjamin Britten. Britten dedicated his Cello Sonata, three Solo Suites, and his Cello Symphony to Rostropovich, who gave their first performances, and the two had an obviously special affinity - Rostropovich's family described him as \"always smiling\" when discussing \"Ben\", and on his death bed he was said to have expressed no fear as he and Britten would, he believed, be reunited in Heaven. Britten was also renowned as a piano accompanist and together they recorded, among other works, Schubert's Sonata for Arpeggione and Piano in A minor D.821. Even on his deathbed his daughter claimed that this recording moved her father to tears of joy.\n\nRostropovich took private lessons in conducting with Leo Ginzburg, and first conducted in public in Gorky in November 1962, performing the four entractes from .... Macbeth of the Mtsensk District and Shostakovich's orchestration of Mussorgsky's Songs and Dances of Death with Vishnevskaya singing. In 1967, at the invitation of the Bolshoi Theatre's director Mikhail Chulaki, he conducted Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin at the Bolshoi, thus letting forth his passion for both the role of conductor and the opera.\n\nProms on August 21, 1968\n\nRostropovich played at The Proms on the night of August 21, 1968. He played with the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra and it was the orchestra's debut performance at the Proms. The programme featured Czech composer Antonín Dvořák's Cello Concerto and was the same day that Russians invaded Czechoslovakia to put an end to Alexander Dubček's Prague Spring. After the performance, which had been preceded by heckling and demonstrations, the orchestra and soloist were cheered by the Proms audience. Rostropovich stood and held aloft the conductor's score of the Dvořák as a gesture of solidarity for the composer's homeland and the city of Prague, a place he loved.\n\nAs an encore he played Bach's haunting sarabande no. iv from Suite 2 in D minor BWV 1008, a piece which he said he liked to offer to those who were sad.\n\nRostropovich fought for art without borders, freedom of speech, and democratic values, resulting in harassment from the Soviet regime. An early example was in 1948, when he was a student at the Moscow Conservatory. In response to the 10 February 1948 decree on so-called 'formalist' composers, his teacher Dmitri Shostakovich was dismissed from his professorships in Leningrad and Moscow; the then 21-year-old Rostropovich quit the conservatory, dropping out in protest. In 1970, Rostropovich sheltered Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who otherwise would have had nowhere to go, in his own home. His friendship with Solzhenitsyn and his support for dissidents led to official disgrace in the early 1970s. As a result, Rostropovich was restricted from foreign touring, as was his wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, and his appearances performing in Moscow were curtailed, as increasingly was his appearances in such major cities as Leningrad and Kiev.\n\nRostropovich left the Soviet Union in 1974 with his wife and children and settled in the United States. He was banned from several musical ensembles in his homeland, and his Soviet citizenship was revoked in 1978 because of his public opposition to the Soviet Union's restriction of cultural freedom. He would not return to the Soviet Union until 1990.[6]\n\nFrom 1977 until 1994, he was musical director and conductor of the U.S. National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, while still performing with some of the most famous musicians such as Martha Argerich, Sviatoslav Richter and Vladimir Horowitz. He was also the director and founder of the Rostropovich Music Festival and was a regular performer at the Aldeburgh Festival in the UK.\n\nHis impromptu performance during the fall of the Berlin Wall as events unfolded was reported throughout the world. His Soviet citizenship was restored in 1990, although he and his family had already become American citizens.\n\nWhen in August 1991 news footage was broadcast of tanks in the streets of Moscow Rostropovich responded with a characteristically brave, impetuous and patriotic gesture: he bought a plane ticket to Japan via Moscow, talked his way out of the airport at Moscow and went to join Boris Yeltsin in the hope that his fame might make some difference to the chance of tanks moving in.\n\nIn modern Russia, Rostropovich was welcomed by high officials. Having supported Yeltsin during the 1993 constitutional crisis (he also conducted the National Symphony Orchestra in Red Square at the height of the crackdown), and was also on friendly terms with Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn 1993 he was instrumental in the foundation of the Kronberg Academy and was a patron until his death. He commissioned Rodion Shchedrin to compose the opera Lolita and conducted its premiere in 1994 at the Royal Swedish Opera.\n\nRostropovich received many international awards, including the French Legion of Honor and honorary doctorates from many international universities. He was an activist, fighting for freedom of expression in art and politics. An ambassador for the UNESCO, he supported many educational and cultural projects. Rostropovich performed several times in Madrid and was a close friend of Queen Sofía of Spain.\n\nRostropovich and his wife, Galina Vishnevskaya founded the Rostropovich-Vishnevskaya Foundation, a publicly-supported non-profit 501(c)(3) organization based in Washington, D.C., in 1991 to improve the health and future of children in the former Soviet Union. The Rostropovich Home Museum opened on March 4, 2002, in Baku. Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya visited Azerbaijan occasionally. Rostropovich also presented cello master classes at the Azerbaijan State Conservatory.\n\nTogether they formed a valuable art collection. In September 2007, when it was slated to be sold at auction by Sotheby's in London and dispersed, Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov stepped forward and negotiated the purchase of all 450 lots, in order to keep the collection together and bring it to Russia as a memorial to the great cellist's memory. Christie's reported that the buyer paid a \"substantially higher\" sum than the £20 million pre-sale estimate.\n\nIn 2006, he was featured in Alexander Sokurov's documentary Elegy of a life: Rostropovich, Vishnevskaya.\n\nHis instruments included the 1711 Duport Stradivarius, a Storioni on which he made most of his recordings and a Peter Guarneri of Venice.\n\nRostropovich's health declined in 2006, with the Chicago Tribune reporting rumors of unspecified surgery in Geneva and later treatment for what was reported as an aggravated ulcer. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Rostropovich to discuss details of a celebration the Kremlin was planning for March 27, 2007, Rostropovich's 80th birthday. Rostropovich attended the celebration but was reportedly in frail health.\n\nThough Rostropovich's last home was in Paris, he maintained residences in Moscow, St. Petersburg, London, Lausanne, and Jordanville, New York. Rostropovich was admitted to a Paris hospital at the end of January 2007, but then decided to fly to Moscow, where he had been receiving care.[26] On February 6, 2007 the 79-year-old Rostropovich was admitted to a hospital in Moscow. \"He is just feeling unwell\", Natalya Dolezhale, Rostropovich's secretary in Moscow, said. Asked if there was serious cause for concern about his health she said: \"No, right now there is no cause whatsoever.\" She refused to specify the nature of his illness. The Kremlin said that President Vladimir Putin had visited the musician on Monday in the hospital, which prompted speculation that he was in a serious condition. Dolezhale said the visit was to discuss arrangements for marking Rostropovich's 80th birthday. On March 27, 2007, the Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a statement praising Rostropovich.\n\nHe re-entered the Blokhim Cancer Institute on April 7, 2007, where he was treated for intestinal cancer. He died on April 27, 2007.\n\nOn April 28, Rostropovich's body lay in an open coffin at the Moscow Conservatory, where he once studied as a teenager, and was then moved to the Church of Christ the Saviour. Thousands of mourners, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, bade farewell. Spain's Queen Sofia, French first .... Bernadette Chirac and President Ilham Aliev of Azerbaijan, where Rostropovich was born, as well as Naina Yeltsina, the widow of Boris Yeltsin, were among those in attendance at the funeral on April 29. Rostropovich was then buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery, the same cemetery where his friend Boris Yeltsin was buried four days earlier.\n\nStature\n\nRostropovich was a huge influence on the younger generation of cellists. Many have openly acknowledged their debt to his example. In the Daily Telegraph, Julian Lloyd Webber called him \"probably the greatest cellist of all time.\"\n\nRostropovich either commissioned or was the recipient of compositions by many composers including Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev, Benjamin Britten, Henri Dutilleux, Olivier Messiaen, Witold Lutosławski, Luciano Berio, Krzysztof Penderecki, Leonard Bernstein, Alfred Schnittke, Aram Khachaturian, Ástor Piazzolla, Sofia Gubaidulina, Arthur Bliss and Lopes Graça. His commissions of new works enlarged the cello repertoire more than any cellist before or since.\n\nHe was the first performer of 117 pieces, and is well known for his interpretations of Dvořák's Cello Concerto in B minor and Haydn's cello concerti in C and D,[citation needed] Prokofiev's Symphony-Concerto and the two cello concerti of Shostakovich. Between 1997 and 2001 he was intimately involved in the development and testing of the BACH.Bow, a curved bow designed by the cellist Michael Bach. In 2001 he invited Michael Bach for a presentation of his BACH.Bow to Paris (7ème Concours de violoncelle Rostropovitch). In July 2011, the city of Moscow announced plans to erect a statue of Rostropovich in a central square.\n\nHe was also a notably generous spirit. Seiji Ozawa relates an anecdote: on hearing of the death of the baby daughter of his friend the sumo wrestler Chiyonofuji Slava flew unannounced to Tokyo, took a 1 1/2 hour cab ride to Chiyonofuji's house and played his Bach sarabande outside, as his gesture of sympathy - then got back in the taxi and returned to the airport to fly back to Europe.\n\nSoviet-Russian cellist and conductor, widely considered to have been the greatest cellist of the second half of the 20th century, and one of the greatest of all time. In addition to his outstanding interpretations and technique, he was well-known for his commissions of new works which enlarged the cello repertoire more than any cellist before or since. He gave the premieres of over 100 pieces. His impromptu performance during the fall of the Berlin Wall as events unfolded earned him international fame and was reported throughout the world. He was also internationally recognized as a staunch advocate of human rights, being awarded in 1974 the Annual Award of the International League of Human Rights.

Called the \"Dean of American Balladeers\", Niles was an important influence on the American folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s, with Joan Baez, Burl Ives, and Peter, Paul and Mary, among others, recording his songs.\n\nBorn in Louisville, Kentucky, Niles learned music theory from his mother, and began writing down folk music as a teenager. He became a serious student of Appalachian folk music by transcribing traditional songs from oral sources while an itinerant employee of the Burroughs Corporation in eastern Kentucky, from 1910 to 1917. After serving in the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I, in which he was injured, he studied music in France, first in Lyon, then in Paris at the Schola Cantorum, also meeting Gertrude Stein. Returning to the United States in 1920, he continued his studies at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music working there with Ralph Lyford. He sang opera in Chicago and folk songs on early radio. In 1925, he moved to New York City and held various jobs in the entertainment industry. In the 1930s, he toured Europe and the United States with contralto Marion Kerby. He performed at the White House in 1938, and on occasion at the Newport Folk Festival during the 1950s.\n\nIn the 1920s, Niles began publishing music. He made four extended trips into the southern Appalachians as an assistant to photographer Doris Ulmann, again transcribing traditional songs from oral sources, including the ballads \"Pretty Polly\", \"Barbara Allen\", and \"He's Goin' Away\". On other occasions, he transcribed songs he heard sung by African Americans and by fellow soldiers in World War I.\n\nNiles was also a noted songwriter. His songs, many of which are based on traditional sources, include \"Venezuela,\" and the haunting Christmas song \"I Wonder As I Wander.\" Henry Miller's Plexus includes a powerful tribute to Niles's recording of this song. Niles composed \"Go 'Way From My Window\" when he was a mere 16 years old, but did not perform it until 1930. Marlene Dietrich recorded it and sang it on stage. Bob Dylan quoted its first line in his song \"It Ain't Me Babe.\" Later in life, Niles published compositions in a more classical style, including works for choir and art songs for voice and piano. The latter include his last work, a setting of poems by Thomas Merton.\n\nStarting in 1938, he recorded a number of his compositions and transcribed songs, performing the material in an intense, dramatic manner. He employed a trademark very high falsetto to portray female characters, and often accompanied himself on an Appalachian dulcimer, lute, or other plucked stringed instrument.\n\nIn 1936, he married Rena Lipetz. They settled on the Boot Hill farm in Clark County, Kentucky, where they spent the rest of their lives.\n\nNiles died in Lexington, Kentucky on March 1, 1980 at age 87. He is buried at the nearby St. Hubert's Episcopal Church. The John Jacob Niles Center for American Music at the University of Kentucky is named after him, and displays a number of traditional instruments he handcrafted.\n\nVideo notes: first video is Niles playing and singing his 'I wonder as I wander'. The second video demonstrates how two opera divas handle this beauriful melody.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-rqSiGvHQU\"]I WONDER AS I WANDER - YouTube[/ame]\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxshIQDMIM8&feature=related\"]Frederica von Stade Kathleen Battle-I Wonder as I Wander, Mary Had a Baby - YouTube[/ame]\n\nin 1906 - Paul Sacher, respected Swiss conductor and philanthropist, is born at Basel. He studied with Weingartner (conducting) at the Basel Conservatory and with Karl Nef (musicology) at the University of Basel. In 1926 he founded the Basel Chamber Orchestra, which specialized in playing works from the pre-Classical and contemporary periods. In 1928 he also organized the Basel Chamber Choir. In 1933 he founded the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, and was also director of the Collegium Musicum in Zurich from 1941. His Schola Cantorum Basiliensis was amalgamated with Basel's Conservatory, and Musikschule to form the Musikakademie der Stadt Basel, which he directed from 1954 to 1969. He appeared as a guest conductor in many European cities. He made his U.S. debut as a guest conductor with the Collegiate Chorale in N.Y. (April 3, 1955). In 1934 he married Maja Stehlin, widow of Emmanuel Hoffmann, whose father founded the Hoffmann-La Roche pharmaceutical firm, makers of the drugs Valium and Librium. Through his wife's fortune, Sacher was able to pursue his goal of commissioning works from the leading composers of the 20th century; in all, he commissioned over 200 works, including scores by Stravinsky, Bartok, Strauss, Honegger, Hindemith, Martin, Britten, Henze, and Boulez, many of which received their premieres under his direction. In 1983 he purchased the entire Stravinsky archive in N.Y. for $5,250,000. In 1986 the Paul Sacher Foundation building was opened in Basel; it houses the archives of Stravinsky, Webern, Martin, and Maderna, as well as of Sacher - Died at Basel May 26, 1999.\n\nin 1911 - Mario Bauza, jazz trumpeter, saxophonist, arranger, is born at Havana, Cuba. Mario Bauza was involved in two of the major jazz and Latin trends of the 1930s and 1940s. He was responsible for introducing Dizzy Gillespie to conga legend Chano Pozo and for bringing the standard Cuban rhythm section into line with the big band sound of Cab Calloway and Chick Webb. The meeting of Gillespie and Pozo was influential in the development of a hybrid known as Cubop which included among its proponents Stan Getz and Charlie Parker. The blending of big band arrangements with Cuban rhythms made Bauza's brother-in-law, Machito (Frank Grillo), the leader of what was arguably the most influential Latinflavored band in the first half of this century. Bauza's first instruments were the clarinet and the bass clarinet, which he played in the Havana Philharmonic.\n\nIn 1930, shortly after arriving in the United States, Bauza got a job with Cuarteto Machin playing trumpet, an instrument he learned to play in the two weeks preceding his first job with the band. His first major jazz gig was with Chick Webb in 1933 and from there Bauza worked briefly with bands led by Don Redman and Fletcher Henderson before joining Cab Calloway's outfit in 1939. In 1940 Bauza made the move to Machito's newly formed band as the musical director, and there he stayed until 1976.\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s Bauza and Graciela (his sister-in-law and former vocalist with Machito) recorded a couple albums for small labels which have since turned into prized collector's items. It was in 1992 that he made a recording featuring Chico O'Farrill's arrangement of \"Tanga,\" a tune originally written by Bauza back in 1943, and this led to a resurgence in his career. - Died at N.Y., July 11, 1993.\n\nin 1914 - Skuli Halldorsson, composer born.\n\nin 1917 - Alfred Mann, German-born American musicologist and choral conductor, is born at Hamburg.
