        "text": "Recent Archives\n\nHere are archives of comments, and past gigs back to 2018.\n\nFor earlier gigs go to Archives\n\nSearch for:\n\nThoughts on The Oddgeir Berg Trio, 14 August 2024\n\nDave said:\n\nI was very much looking forward to the Oddgeir Berg Trio, and my expectations were exceeded. It was one of those gigs where you could feel the listening almost as well as you could hear the sound.\n\nA friend asked me about the gig, and I told him that it was an easy one to rig: piano micing as usual, bass and a talk mic. Wrong.\n\nThe wonderful bassist, Audun Ramo came with a set of stomp boxes and without a bass amp. Between Gerry and I, we rigged a powered monitor for him as his foldback, and took a lead for me at the desk from the monitor. Audun used his bow a lot during the show, beautiful.\n\nThe leader, Oddgeir Berg, brought a suitcase full of kit. A music stand with the top horizontal on either side of the piano held the stomp box on his left, and a keyboard on his right. The effects were used gently. Some of the tunes (all by Oddgeir) were about the landscapes of northern Norway, and family past and present. The effects he used evoked the feeling of that scenery, and the emotions of loss.\n\nLars Bernstein on drums had no electronics. He did have a huge range of sound out of his kit.\n\nMy friend asked me to describe the programme in a few words. The best I could do was Norwegian Jazz Noir. A lot of the music was indeed dark, and always intense, but there were jolly tracks too. Oddgeir presented the show with grace and humour.\n\nI truly hope that we book this band again.\n\nOn the 28 of August, we welcome back Tony Kofi, complete with the Organization. Peter Cator is the drummer, Simon Fernsby the guitarist and Pete Whittaker the organist. Tony is advertised as using his baritone sax, but I would be surprised if he didn't bring a trio of saxes. I hope to see you there.\n\nSteve said:\n\nEvery music fan should experience a Scandinavian Jazz Piano Trio live gig at least once. There was something for everyone last night at Fleece Jazz as we welcomed back The Oddgeir Berg Trio (last here in March 2023), who are currently on their European tour from their homeland of Norway.\n\nThe warmth and charm of pianist Oddgeir Berg compering between numbers set the tone of the whole evening with music to complement his style of delivery. His songwriting injects elements of classical music into melodic piano jazz with occasional rock grooves via distorted electronic ambient sounds reminiscent of the Esbjorn Svensson Trio.\n\nThe setlist was largely from the new album: ‘A place called Home’, much of which was about his parents as well as the beauty of his area of Norway. It was the quieter, reflective numbers that drew most approval such as ‘Song for My Mother’ and ‘Triste’ in the first set, but a standout after the interval was the much more animated and extended ‘Vagabond’ which effortlessly segued via some freestyle piano into Joni Mitchell’s ‘Both Sides Now’, reminding us of how indebted Scandinavian Jazz is to its own folk tunes.\n\nThe warm lyricism of the music was so rapturously received that all copies of the new album on CD were sold out during the interval. Any vinyl copies had been sent to Germany by the record company, but a new format known as Tap-Tape was available – billed as the lovechild of vinyl and streaming, I saw one brave soul buy one.\n\nTHE ODDGEIR BERG TRIO SETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 14/8/24\n\nAll compositions by Oddgeir Berg except for 14\n\nHere Comes The Toughest\n\nInto the Mountains (Sula)\n\nCircles\n\nAs We Wander Around\n\nPerpetuum Mobile\n\nSong For My Mother\n\nHommage (sic) (Dance Like Nobody’s Watching)\n\nTriste\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nEpilogue\n\nHappiness Is Where You Are\n\nWhere The Sun Never Sleeps\n\nThe Escape\n\nVagabond\n\nBoth Sides Now (Joni Mitchell)\n\nPost Mortem\n\nEncore: Lullaby for A.O.\n\nThoughts on Theo Travis’ Double Talk – 24 July 2024\n\nSteve said:\n\nFor all the right reasons, it is a struggle to articulate the sensation caused by Theo Travis’ Doubletalk as they returned to Fleece Jazz for the first time in just over seven years. The music was an emotional rollercoaster and, at times, completely overwhelming in its intensity. Judging from the wild applause, as well as the whoops and the cries of delight from our highly appreciative audience after almost every number, I was far from alone in feeling this way.\n\nThe gospel-tinged organ sound of Pete Whittaker that introduced the first number, ‘Ascending’, soon opens up for Theo Travis to weave his magic on soprano sax with the central, haunting melody followed by the first of many stunning and enrapturing guitar solos from Mike Outram. Throughout, the driving beat from Nic France’s drums sets the pulse racing and the sheer joy on his face as he looks to his fellow musicians reflects how many of us feel and reminds us of how patently aware the band are of each other's musical thoughts. The pace doesn’t let up with ‘Fire Mountain’, inspired by a volcanic national park on the Canary Islands. The tempo is ramped up even further as organ and drums set the rhythm with guitar mirroring the runs on tenor sax with excoriating energy. Fittingly, the band seemed truly on fire! The pace then eases for the lovely ballad, ‘Shore Thing’, which featured a memorable solo from Mike’s guitar. Somewhat of a departure for the band, but completely in tune with Theo’s influences, is Pharoah Sanders’ ‘The Creator Has A Master Plan’ with Theo’s flute-playing featuring for the first time this evening. Sanders’ tune was a kind of sequel to his mentor John Coltrane's legendary 1964 recording ‘A Love Supreme’ and has the same spiritual feeling, which comes across superbly from the quartet before leading seamlessly into Floating Points’ ‘Peroration Six’. The first set concludes with the title track of the quartet’s second album, ‘Transgression’, another longform piece of progressive music in the jazz idiom, a heady mix that ticks all the boxes – jazz, rock and prog. As with all the numbers played this evening, there is a rigorous musicality beneath the sound and fury.\n\nThe second set kicks off with a piece by The Beatles’ record producer, George Martin, made famous by English progressive rock band Van der Graaf Generator, ‘Theme One’. The piece develops into a catchy anthem concluding with Outram sparring with Travis. One of Theo’s older numbers, ‘Lulworth Night’, features an inspiring solo from Whittaker who elsewhere largely binds the sound of the whole band with a sublety that gives free rein to the more ecstatic contributions of Outram and Travis. ‘Freedom Coda’ is a reworking of ‘Freedom’ and ‘Song for Samuel’ is a joyous, vivacious tribute to Theo’s son. Another prog-rock-jazz epic, ‘A Place In The Queue’ once again features Pete Whittaker resplendent on keys as he mixes Larry Young-style modal jazz into the overall sound and does so once again on the much demanded encore, ‘The Relegation of Pluto’, fittingly introduced with otherworldly sounds from the organ which crystallised into a funky, swampy sound, before the sax, guitar and drums resumed.\n\nWe want them back soon.\n\nDave said:\n\nI loved this show for all the reasons that Steve recorded above. For techies, I can say that it was great fun to run the sound desk for this one. The prime job was to keep Theo in front when he was soloing. His tenor came to me directly from a mic. The flute and soprano used his mic, which was connected to a stomp box connected to me. These two instruments needed different volume and reverb changes, which were also dependent on the volume of the other four. That kept me hopping. The nice thing was that the technology was used with delicacy and relevance. Nice.\n\nFor me, the favourite bit of the gig was Mike and Theo trading 4's, and them all trading with Nic. \"Polyrhythms Are Us\".I\n\nIn three weeks time, we have the return of the wonderful Norwegian piano trio, the Oddgeir Berg Trio, with Audun Ramo on bass and Lars Berntsen on drums. We loved them when they were here last. Don't miss them.\n\nTake care,\n\nDave\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 24/7/2\n\nAll compositions by Theo Travis except for 4 and 6\n\nAscending\n\nFire Mountain\n\nShore Thing\n\nThe Creator Has A Master Plan (Pharoah Sanders and Leon Thomas) / Peroration Six (Sam Shepherd aka Floating Points)\n\nTransgression\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nTheme One (George Martin)\n\nLulworth Night\n\nFreedom Coda\n\nEverything I Feared\n\nSong for Samuel\n\nA Place In The Queue\n\nEncore: The Relegation of Pluto\n\nThoughts on Cal Tjader/Stan Getz Sextet, Album Tribute – 10 July 2024\n\nIn tribute to the 1958 “West Coast Cool” recording of the Cal Tjader and Stan Getz sextet, Mark Crooks and Nat Steele treated us to an enjoyable selection of jazz standards and Tjader originals. Mark described what we heard from the first three numbers as a “listenable dynamic” with a “lack of racket” and indeed it was; a welcome antidote to what was taking place simultaneously in Dortmund. Bracing and calming like the best of West Coast, the album itself is a hidden gem and a real cool classic with a simply incredible line-up including pianist Vince Guaraldi, guitarist Eddie Duran, bassist Scott La Faro and drummer Billy Higgins.\n\nThe jaunty “Ginza Samba” sets the scene with nimble and imaginative contributions from all soloists. Nat Steele is a vigorous, resourceful performer who demonstrated his wizardry on vibes throughout the evening – all eyes were on his speed and dexterity as he took each solo, including those of compere and fellow frontman, Mark Crooks. Like Getz and Tjader, the warm, silky sound of Mark’s tenor blended effortlessly with Nat’s vibes, especially on the beautiful ballad, “I’ve Grown Accustomed To Her Face”. Both frontmen showed an ability to switch from lyric smoothness as on the waltz, “Liz-Anne” and “For All We Know” to gutsy swing as on “Ginza Samba”, “Big Bear” and “Crow’s Nest”.\n\nCole Porter’s “Get Out of Town”, which Mark wryly dedicated to former members of the cabinet, was performed as a quartet with Nat and Mátyás sitting out for this one number, allowing us to witness a superb, tight interplay between the tenor and rhythm section. The liquid, bluesy sound of Colin Oxley’s guitar, Jeremy Brown’s extraordinary agility across the whole range of the bass (especially on Tjader’s beautiful waltz, “Liz-Anne”) and Mark Taylor’s versatility of style were present across both sets.\n\nWe finished with “Parker 51”, a number covered most famously by Stan Getz and based on the changes of Bird’s “Cherokee”, the most animated (frenetic?) tune heard all evening that gave every band member an opportunity to demonstrate their agile technique and featured a rousing drum solo from Mark Taylor.\n\nA final word on our pianist, Mátyás Gayer, who played a key role throughout both sets . His solos were thoughtful, always gentle, appropriate to the West Coast cool. His obligato though came out of intense listening to his colleagues, very fine.\n\nThe next gig has the return of Theo Travis (tenor sax) with organist Pete Whittaker, Mike Outram on guitar, and Nic France on drums. The passion and flow of ideas will amaze you. We hope to see you on Wednesday July 24.\n\nTake care,\n\nSteve\n\nCAL TJADER-STAN GETZ SEXTET ALBUM TRIBUTE\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 10/7/24\n\nGinza Samba (Vince Guaraldi)\n\nLiz-Anne (Cal Tjader)\n\nI’ve Grown Accustomed To Her Face (Loewe/Lerner)\n\nGet Out Of Town (Cole Porter)\n\nCrow’s Nest (Cal Tjader)\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nFried Bananas (Dexter Gordon)\n\nFor All We Know (J.

What we had last night was, indeed, a heady intoxicating brew, a melting pot of musical genres ranging from electric blues to jazz-funk and jazz-rock, creating the much-maligned jazz-fusion sound that originated in the late 1960s and was probably made most famous by Miles Davis with Bitches Brew.\n\nThe impact of the band’s sound took some getting used to as they treated us to an aural rollercoaster-ride through the first number, Pat Metheny’s \"Timeline\": the clash of Mark Fletcher’s cymbals overlaid by the funky grooves of Jim Watson’s electric piano and Steve Pearce’s electric bass set the scene before Freddie Gavita and Paul Stacey on electric trumpet and electric guitar, respectively, traded bars to create an exhilarating “wall of sound”. The second number, a funky arrangement of Wayne Shorter’s \"Beauty and the Beast\" has become an ever-welcome signature tune for the band and John Scofield’s \"Peculiar\" was highly appreciated by several members of our audience who couldn’t resist moving to the funky beat.\n\nMingus’ \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\" (an elegy for Lester Young) brought the tempo and the volume down and allowed for a moment of sad contemplation and reflection which was enhanced magnificently by Paul Stacey’s guitar adding an element of keening electric blues. Mark Fletcher mentioned that Joni Mitchell later covered the song on her album, Mingus. Those in the know may have recalled her added lyrics which highlighted the racism experienced by Lester, not least due to his mixed-race marriage.\n\nIn his arrangement of Herbie Hancock’s \"Fat Albert Rotunda\", featuring more evidence of the virtuosity of each band member, Freddie Gavita uses trumpet and pedal effects to such impressive effect and did so once again to overlay electronic sci-fi sounds on Shorter’s \"Footprints\" in the second set. In direct contrast, the beautiful ballad, \"Infant Eyes\", also by Shorter provided another oasis of calm before the tempo was ramped up with Ornette Coleman’s \"Law Years\" (“feel free to join in if you know it!” quipped Fletch).\n\nJoshua Redman Elastic Band’s driving and punchy \"Greasy G\" featured Jim Watson and Steve Pearce laying down some deep grooves combined with jazz harmony on electric piano and electric bass before Freddie Gavita took the lead on Freddie Hubbard’s \"Birdlike\".\n\nI haven’t mentioned Mark Fletcher anything like as much as I should have. Mark can do all-guns blazing, animated pyrotechnics on his drumkit as effectively as he can do restrained, quiet contemplation with sensitive brushwork as he did on \"Infant Eyes\". He is incredibly energetic, fast and highly co-ordinated as he creates some seemingly complex rhythms that anchor and complement the other musicians. It truly is Fletch’s Brew.\n\nDave says:\n\nSteve has said most of what I thought of this amazing gig. Fire and soul from Mark Fletcher on drums, Freddie Gavita on trumpet, flugel and stomp-box, Jim Watson on keyboard, Paul Stacey on electric guitar, and on Steve Pearce on bass guitar. Both guitarists had their own stomp-boxes, but Freddie's was a wonder to behold. He used it for the trumpet and produced amazing sounds as well as clear trumpet, but the flugel was on a simple mic, and sounded great.\n\nI thought that after the Bill Evans gig two weeks ago, with Mark on delicate, intricate brushwork, that we would have an evening of total wow this time. The wow was there in spades, diamonds and heart. But the quiet brushwork was there too, in \"Goodbye, Pork Pie Hat\" and \"Infant Eyes\".\n\nIt was fascinating to me that even at the volume that the guys produced, the individual instruments were not hidden, as often happens when the volume is high. Underneath the solos, the obligato was both one distinct sound, but you could hear the interesting things that the backing guys did, and how they interacted with each other.\n\nThat interaction was vital. It was clear that the band were having the time of their lives up there. Mark's arrangements left a ton of room for trading, cross-rhythms and counterpoint, and other fun stuff.\n\nOn July 10th, we have a superb tribute to the Cal Tjader/Stan Getz Sextet. It is led by Nat Steele on vibes and Mark Crooks on tenor, with Colin Oxley on guitar, pianist Matyas Gayer, bassist Jeremy Brown and Mark Taylor on drums. Do join us. It will be a lovely evening\n\nTake care,\n\nDave\n\n“FLETCH’S BREW” SETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 26/6/24\n\nTimeline (Pat Metheny)\n\nBeauty and the Beast (Wayne Shorter)\n\nPeculiar (John Scofield)\n\nGoodbye Pork Pie Hat (Charles Mingus)\n\nFat Albert Rotunda (Herbie Hancock)\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nYoung and Fine (Josef Zawinul)\n\nFootprints (Wayne Shorter)\n\nInfant Eyes (Wayne Shorter)\n\nLaw Years (Ornette Coleman)\n\nGreasy G (Joshua Redman)\n\nBirdlike (Freddie Hubbard)\n\nThoughts on “Conversations with Bill” – The Adrian York Trio, 12 June 2024\n\nSteve says:\n\nAdrian York’s passion for the music of Bill Evans was very much in evidence as he presented an overview of the tortured soul and creative genius, from his early work as leader in 1956 with the album New Jazz Conceptions up until his premature death in 1980.\n\nEach number was interspersed with biographical details of Bill’s life and work, as well as the changing line-up of the trio from its early days. Several members of our audience appreciated having the development of Bill’s work put into context, along with the odd amusing anecdote.\n\nThe repertoire varied from the aching beauty and delicacy of Waltz for Debby, My Foolish Heart and Peace Piece (the latter drawing appreciative gasps from the audience) to the swinging, uptempo rendition of Autumn Leaves and Stella by Starlight reminding us of the influence of Bud Powell on Evans’ style which Adrian York delivered to perfection. The sting in the tail of some of the more lyrical pieces wasn’t glossed over either, particularly on Turn Out The Stars.\n\nIt is too easy to focus exclusively on the pianist during a gig that pays homage to the lead musician, but we were fortunate to have the animated Mark Fletcher who delighted with his delicate brushwork on My Foolish Heart as well as his flurries of astounding freedom on the drumkit. Equally, our bassist, Paul Whitten, rose above the role of timekeeper with solos that were much freer and creative and complemented the lyricism of York on piano, with Fletch taking a sensitive and unobtrusive role as he did so.\n\nDave says:\n\nI do love piano trios, and this one was a delight. There were some young people in our audience, and “Peace Piece” had an emotional effect on them. Even though I knew it, me too.\n\nYou can listen to this music lightly, and enjoy the superb playing, and the great tunes. This show, for me, needed a deeper listen. I found out part of the reason for this. I took a sneak peek at some of the music (all but the encore had written heads). The sheets were dense with annotations, the result of serious research and knowledge. We didn’t hear the research, we heard the music. The encore was played with empty music stands, and was just free and fun.\n\nWhat a lovely gig. And by the way what a wonderful, intense and often quiet drummer. Well, we will see Mark Fletcher in a very different guise in two weeks time, when he brings back “Fletch’s Brew” to us. The title is a pun on “Bitches Brew”, and the gig will be wild.

Newcomer RJ Gilbert on alto sax is still studying at Birmingham Conservatoire and if he were nervous to be playing with such established and highly accomplished musicians, it didn’t show. He was a cool customer who looked to be enjoying himself as he played off and with the others, particularly David Newton whom he obviously admired deeply (and who can blame him!) I particularly liked his feature on the jazz standard My One and Only Love where he displayed seemingly effortless fluency and breath control throughout his sweet lyrical performance.\n\nA Bitta Bittadose, based very closely on Bobby Watson’s A Bitter Dose, was a great crowd pleaser and gave each musician a chance to rise to the occasion in this later period Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers blues. The stunning pianism and inventiveness of David Newton complemented by the fine work on double bass, Simon Allen and RJ Gilbert leading the horn chorus and Clark Tracey demonstrating why he is consistently rated as the UK’s best drummer with his inventive use of his kit.\n\nThelonious Monk’s Blue Monk stood out in the equally enthralling second set. It cannot be easy to play the work of such a musical eccentric and maverick, but David Newton seemed to relish the experience and deliver a stunning performance which he made his own.\n\nThere were memorable solos throughout the gig, but i think people should take time to hear the obligatos. The inventiveness and intense listening provided by bass, drums, piano lifted the solos and put smiles on the faces of the musicians.\n\nI may have misheard Clark announce the next number as In A Semi Mental Mood rather than In a Sentimental Mood, although never doubt his playfulness and dry wit especially when Simon Allen’s rendition on soprano saxophone was a quirky interpretation which tinkered with the time signature of the Ellington original. Equally as beautiful but not a slavish cover of that truly beautiful jazz standard.\n\nSonny Rollins’ St Thomas was played as a fittingly drum-led Latin shuffle by the whole band and concluded the set. I listened carefully to Clark's use of little mallets on this one, and was flabbergasted to hear him weave three simultaneous cross-rhythms.\n\nThe short but sweet encore was Hank Mobley’s This I Dig of You. Several members of our audience were moved to give the quintet a standing ovation and quite rightly so.\n\nI am greatly looking forward to the conversations with Bill Evans provided by the Adrian York Trio, on June 12th. It promises to be an evening of quietly intense beauty, not to be missed.\n\nTake care,\n\nDave\n\nTHE CLARK TRACEY QUINTET\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 22/5/24\n\nRainbow at the Five Mile Road (Stan Tracey) from the 1969 Stan Tracey Quartet album, Free An’ One\n\nEuphony (Stan Tracey) Stan’s first recorded composition from 1952 with Victor Feldman’s All Stars.\n\nMy One and Only Love (Guy Wood/Robert Mellin)\n\nRemind Me In Three (Clark Tracey)based on the chord progression of Joe Henderson’s Recorda Me\n\nA Bitta Bittadose (Bobby Watson) based on Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers’ Bitter Dose\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nA Funky Day in Tiger Bay (Stan Tracey) from the album Stan Tracey’s Hexad: Live at Ronnie Scott’s\n\nBlue Monk (Thelonious Monk)\n\nIn A Sentimental Mood (Duke Ellington)\n\nSt Thomas (Sonny Rollins)\n\nEncore: This I Dig Of You (Hank Mobley)\n\nOn Wednesday 26 June, Fletch’s Brew- £20\n\nMark Fletcher Drums\n\nFreddie Gavita Trumpet/Flugelhorn\n\nPaul Stacey Guitar\n\nJim Watson Piano\n\nSteve Pearce Bass\n\n“(Fletch's Brew) . . . . . could, without overstating the case, easily be called Band of Virtuosos\" (Jazzwise magazine)\n\nIn 2010, drumming tour-de-force Mark Fletcher founded Fletch’s Brew, a band which blurs the boundaries of musical styles and surpasses preconceived notions of jazz. Whether playing original compositions or new arrangements from across the jazz canon, their style floats seamlessly between the idioms of fusion, funk, bebop, reggae and rock. Mark is a remarkably talented and muscular drummer, capable of subtlety but never better than when leading an all-guns-blazing charge, which is both very exciting and intensely engaging.\n\nFreddie Gavita is an award-winning British trumpeter and composer who has cemented his place as a leading light on the British jazz scene. He is a member of the Ronnie Scott's Club Quintet as well as being a band leader in his own right, playing his own original music to great critical acclaim. Once described as “a cross between Kenny Wheeler and Freddie Hubbard”, he has also played with, among others, Peter Erskine, Joe Locke, Jon Hendricks, Kenny Wheeler, Stan Sulzmann, Tim Garland, Gregory Porter and Dionne Warwick.\n\nPaul Stacey is a guitarist, producer, mixer and actor. Paul was a member of NYJO in the ‘80s and The Lemon Trees with Guy Chambers in the ’90s, before working for many years with Oasis, the Black Crowes and Noel Gallagher. Jazz artists that he has worked with include Laurence Cottle, David Preston, Jason Rebello, Pino Palladino, Tommy Smith, Mornington Locket, Gary Husband, Clare Martin, Georgie Fame, Ian Shaw, Iain Ballamy, Jim Mullen, Bobby Wellins and Kenny Wheeler.\n\nA session and touring musician of formidable repute, Jim Watson is rightly considered to be one of the most talented pianists in the country. He has been featured in a huge variety of bands, including the Jazz/Funk bands Incognito, Brand New Heavies and US3, with US artists Lalo Schifrin, James Moody, the BBC Radio Big Band, Katie Melua and most recently Manu Katché. His jazz bona fides are just as impressive having worked with Dave O’Higgins, Julian Arguelles, Jean Toussaint and Peter King among many others.\n\nSteve Pearce is one of the most experienced bass players working in London today, playing regularly in the top studios in the capital. His career spans over four decades over the course of which he has played with artists such as Van Morrison, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock, Mose Allison, Al Jarreau, Mark Knopfler Randy Crawford and many more.\n\n“We haven't had anything like this in New York for over twenty years.\" (Wynton Marsalis)\n\nThoughts on “Wakey Blakey” – The Music of Art Blakey\n\nIn the great debate about the superiority or otherwise of the audio quality of analogue sound (vinyl) as opposed to digital (CD and download), there is one listening experience that can be forgotten and that, of course, is live music. Nothing beats it, especially when the band delivers to such a high standard as Wakey Blakey, the sextet led by Rory Ingham and James Davison playing the music of the classic sextet lineup of Art Blakey and The Jazz Mesengers. It’s not just the immediacy of the experience and the fidelity of sound or even the spontaneity and sheer joy of improvised music, but being able to witness first-hand how musicians work together.\n\nLast night was a cracker of an evening, a feast of hard bop by a superlative sextet who gave us the music of Wayne Shorter, Freddie Hubbard and Curtis Fuller originally recorded by Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers. These albums are getting a fresh play today as I relive last night’s gig and marvel at the music once again.\n\nI am lucky to have seen Wayne Shorter many times as well as Cedar Walton and Freddie Hubbard once each, but not all in the same room at the same time with Art Blakey and the others. “Wakey Blakey” was a real treat and an awakening to how wonderful this music sounds live. I was struck by the similarity of James Davison’s tone and urgency of delivery to that of Freddie Hubbard from the beginning during “Time Off”. He was very powerful, yet completely soulful and sensitive when required as on the beautiful rendition of Hoagy Carmichael’s “Skylark”. I loved the bluesy growl of Rory’s trombone-playing in several numbers, especially “Hammerhead”. An old Fleece regular used to say that the trombone was an “awkward instrument in the modern setting” but he hadn’t heard Rory play it as sensitively and as fluently as he did last night. Rory was also a very amusing and playful compere who balanced humour with respect for the music of the Jazz Messengers. Alex Garnett was a dep for another Alex and it was one of his best performances on tenor sax that I have seen from him in a while. He played with conviction and soul and delivered some warm solos throughout.\n\nPianist Matt Carter provided a constant propulsive rhythm throughout many numbers and did so faultlessly, with occasional bursts of freer improvisation. Misha Mullov-Abbado was a tall presence alongside his double bass, using his long frame and long dextrous fingers at such a rapid pace to provide the propulsive beat demanded by the faster numbers. I especially loved his solo that introduced Hubbard’s “The Core”. I’ve left our drummer until last which is how it often is, but this was a homage to the great Art Blakey, a huge presence who played with so much drive and passion. Luke Tomlinson was, like Art, sensitive to what was going on around the music and had two memorable and powerful solos on “Free For All” and “Ping Pong” that penetrated to the core.\n\nThe last word goes to Carlos Santana: “Art Blakey’s drive, passion, soulfulness, heart and innovation were and still are inspirations that help and require us to move the music ever forward.” That was very much in evidence in last night’s performance from Wakey Blakey.\n\nTake care,\n\nSteve\n\nDave says:\n\nThat was an accurate review of a great show. The sound check was terrific fun to be part of, even though the only mics were piano and leader.\n\nWAKEY BLAKEY: THE MUSIC OF ART BLAKEY’S JAZZ MESSENGERS\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 08/5/24\n\nTowards the beginning of the gig, Rory Ingham explained that the numbers they would be playing were originally performed by the classic sextet lineup of Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers: Wayne Shorter (tenor sax); Freddie Hubbard (trumpet); Curtis Fuller (trombone); Cedar Walton (Piano); Reggie Workman (Bass); as well as Art Blakey (drums) himself. The selections were mostly from the albums Mosaic (1961), Caravan (1962), Ugetsu (1963) and Free For All (1964\n\nTime Off (Curtis Fuller) from the album Ugetsu\n\nHammerhead (Wayne Shorter) from the album Free For All\n\nFree For All (Wayne Shorter) from the album Free For All\n\nSkylark (Hoagy Carmichael)from the album Caravan\n\nOne By One (Wayne Shorter) from the album Ugetsu\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nChildren of the Night (Wayne Shorter) from the album Mosaic\n\nIn The Wee Small Hours of the Morning (David Mann)from the album Caravan\n\nThe Core (Freddie Hubbard) from the album Free For All\n\nMiyako (Wayne Shorter) from his album Schizophrenia\n\nPing Pong (Wayne Shorter) from the album Ugetsu\n\nEncore: Down Under (Freddie Hubbard) from the album Mosaic\n\nOn Wednesday 24 July Theo Travis’ Double Talk – £20\n\nTheo Travis Saxes and flute\n\nPete Whittaker Organ\n\nMike Outram Guitar\n\nNic France Drums\n\n“High octane innovative jazz, continually evolving with underlying rock and ambient influences . . .” (Mojo magazine)\n\nThe full flowing effect of the music from the Double Talk Quartet returns to Fleece Jazz for the first time in seven years. Theo Travis' influences are diverse and include the Beatles and Pink Floyd as much as jazz artists like Stan Getz, Pharoah Sanders, Elvin Jones and Chick Corea. His many musical interests come together in this distinctive quartet project, which delivers music at the fluid interface between jazz, ambient and prog. He has become one of the most active jazz artists and composers in the U.K. and in addition to having his own group, he is in demand as a sideman to musicians from a variety of musical genres. He has worked with Soft Machine Legacy, Robert Fripp, David Sylvian, Anja Garbarek, John Etheridge, Gong, David Gilmour and Keith Tippett.\n\nThe bluesy, progressive jazz of the quartet draws heavily on the soulful Hammond organ of Pete Whittaker, the soaring guitar of Mike Outram and the powerful but subtle drums and percussion of Nic France. Pete Whittaker is a regular member of the Nigel Price Organ Trio and has also been involved with several other jazz projects including Toni Kofi’s Organisation and guitarist John Etheridge’s “Blue Spirits”. Mike Outram is one of the UK’s foremost guitarists who is sought after as an improviser and for his ability to contribute a unique voice to any musical ensemble. He has toured internationally with Herbie Mann, Carleen Anderson and Tim Garland and recorded with Steven Wilson and Robert Fripp. Nic France has an impeccable sense of groove and dynamics, making him a sought-after sessionist. He has played with Andy Sheppard, Nigel Kennedy, Barb Jungr and the Charlie Haden Liberation Orchestra.\n\n“Travis' tenor is a warm, mellifluous instrument and together with the luscious, bluesy Hammond organ they create something rather unexpected...a prog-rock/jazz/blues hybrid of genuine power and excitement” (Guy Hayden)\n\nOn Wednesday 14 August The Oddgeir Berg Trio- £20\n\nOddgeir Berg Piano\n\nAudun Ramo Bass\n\nLars Berntsen Drums\n\n“A piano trio to get truly excited about, a trio for the new millennium”– **** Dan McClenaghan, All About Jazz\n\nJazz trios named after the piano player give certain expectations, be it Horace Silver and his tender “Que Pasa” or Esbjørn Svensson and his Northern sounds; clarity and intimacy are common to these, with a hint of tonal melancholy. These characteristics also present with Oddgeir Berg Trio, who are clearly familiar with a Scandinavian jazz tradition.\n\nThe trio’s sound has been called “withdrawn and cinematic.” In this aspect they share a characteristic with another Norwegian piano group, the Tord Gustavsen Trio. A notable difference is Oddgeir Berg Trio’s more effusive embrace of electronics, which adds to the cinematic and atmospheric aspect of the sound.\n\nThe trio has some other tricks up its sleeve though, most importantly an urgency for action, pace and adventure. Here the Oslo based trio has more in common with Miles Davis’ Jack Johnson than Scandinavia’s Jan Johannson. The love of jazz and blues drive Audun Ramo’s double bass and the propulsive drum sound of Lars Berntsen energetically support Oddgeir Berg’s playing. Berg’s curiosity in experimenting with Wurlitzer\\Rhodes and synthesizer sounds sneaks into the soundscape and lends a distinctive colour to the sound panorama.\n\n“Electroacoustic jazz with one leg in melancholy and the other in ecstasy.”\n\nOn Wednesday 10 July The Stan Getz/Cal Tjader Sextet Tribute- £20\n\nNat Steele Vibes\n\nMark Crooks Tenor sax\n\nColin Oxley Guitar\n\nMátyás Gayer Piano\n\nJeremy Brown Double Bass\n\nMark Taylor Drums\n\nThe combination of tenor sax with vibraphone is a particularly warm and luxurious sound and has been featured very successfully by several leading tenor players including Sonny Rollins (with Milt Jackson) and Joe Henderson (with Bobby Hutcherson).\n\nStan Getz and Cal Tjader had an especially successful partnership in the late 1950s, leading an all-star sextet including Scott La Faro, Vince Guaraldi, Eddie Duran and on his very first recording drum master Billy Higgins.\n\nThis sextet led by tenor player Mark Crooks and vibraphonist Nat Steele celebrates this collaboration, playing selections from the brilliant 1958 album. The sextet performs gorgeous arrangements of standards \"For All We Know\", \"I’ve Grown Accustomed To Her Face\" and \"My Buddy\" along with swinging originals by Tjader and Guaraldi, \"Ginza Samba\" and \"Big Bear\". Stan Getz’s other vibraphone partnerships are also showcased, with selections from his recordings with vibes masters Lionel Hampton and Gary Burton.\n\nMark Crooks works in a wide variety of musical settings including jazz, big band and classical. He has performed with artists ranging from Tony Bennett to Sir Simon Rattle, Lady Gaga to Dame Cleo Laine at venues from Ronnie Scott’s in London to the Lincoln Center in New York. Nat Steele quickly gained a reputation as a talented musician to watch out for, described by Clark Tracey as \"one of the best vibes players this country has ever produced.\" Principally self-taught and following in the style of Milt Jackson, his quartet is regularly featured in the Late, Late show at Ronnie Scott's.\n\nFeatured in the rhythm section are the UK’s finest straight-ahead jazz musicians: bassist Jeremy Brown (Brad Mehldau, Peter King), up-and-coming young pianist Mátyás Gayer, and drummer Mark Taylor (George Coleman, Monty Alexander).\n\nAccolades for Mark Crooks: “luscious sound and apparently effortless phrasing”; “a big, warm, engaging tone”; “gorgeous, liquid and elegant.”\n\nAccolade for Nat Steele: \"A remarkable young vibraphonist in the Milt Jackson tradition.\" Dave Gelly (Observer)\n\nThoughts on The Chris Ingham Quartet -“The Music of Dudley Moore”, 24 April 2024\n\nDuring Chris Ingham’s superb presentation of the life of the great Dudley Moore, he (only once) stumbled over a word. As the announcer at the gig, I wood never distend to such a Paux Fas.\n\nOne of the delights of any show led by Chris is the depth of his research, and the humour of his presentation. I think everyone found something new about Dudley’s life and talent. But as good as it was, the music was what the evening was about, and the music was wonderful.\n\nThe musicians were:\n\nChris was on piano and vocals. He said in effect that he was unequal to the virtuosity of Dudley. I wonder; to me, there was no note out of place, whether the music was dense or sparse. Consider the riot of counter-rhythms on “Amalgam”, while echoing the serene themes played by Paul. The vocals were a riot on their own.\n\nPaul Higgs, who played trumpet (open, wah wah, harmon, straight) and flugel. His soft, clear singing to echo the frenetic piano on “Amalgam”, was lovely. He is such a good player. His enjoyment of the work of the others was lovely to watch. He made the trading of 4’s with George such a treat.\n\nGeorge Double was the drummer. I loved his range of expression was surprising; hand work on “Atlanta”, some beautiful trading on several numbers, and just watching him play. And for the first time for me, he sang, in duet with Paul, as backing vocalists. Way backing vocalists, bh singing by the drums, very funny. You have to be good to be funny.\n\nSimon Thorpe only sang once, but it was clear he enjoyed it. He is a favourite at Fleece Jazz. His work throughout the evening was superb, and the solo on “Sad One for George” was special.\n\nThese guys gave us the joy and the complexity of Dudley Moore’s music. It was an evening to cherish. Steve’s amazing set list below deserves a read.\n\nOur next gig is also a celebration of one of the greats. A trombone led band to honour a drummer? Yes indeed. Art Blakey would be delighted by the work of the Rory Ingham sextet: Rory on trombone, Alex Garnett on sax, James Davison on trumpet, Matt Carter on piano, Misha Mullov-Abbado on bass, and Luke Tomlinson on drums. It will be a high energy, wildly swinging gig.. So do join us for the first gig of the new programme on Wednesday the 8th of May.\n\nTake care,\n\nDave\n\nTHE CHRIS INGHAM QUARTET: THE MUSIC OF DUDLEY MOORE\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 24/4/24\n\nDudley Dell – originally the B-side to his 1961 debut single Strictly for the Birds. Now only available as a bonus track on Authentic Dud Volume 2, the CD reissue of Moore’s 1965 album on Decca Records, The Other Side of Dudley Moore. This quirky two-minute number is best known nowadays as the theme tune to Radio 4’s Quote Unquote. It shares the same chord sequence as My Blue Heaven and contains glancing references to a host of jazz standards.\n\n(Theme tune to) Not Only . . . But Also – Not Only … But Also was the hugely popular TV sketch show that Dudley hosted with Peter Cook between 1964 and 1970. The quirky, angular, Thelonious Monk-inspired theme to Not Only … But Also was the B-side to Pete and Dud’s 1965 Top 20 hit Goodbye-ee. It has virtually vanished from the internet. You’ll find some snippets of Moore playing it on (retrieved) videos of the TV show, but a full recording is not available.\n\nWaterloo – full of labyrinthine chord sequences/ My Blue Heaven (Donaldson/Whiting) – full of Dudley’s characteristic playfulness with a two-step lope on bass and finger-popping on bongos courtesy of Simon Thorpe and George Double respectively.\n\nPoova Nova – from The Other Side of Dudley Moore.\n\nBedazzled Dudley’s best-known song is the recurring theme from the 1967 movie, Bedazzled. It was most memorably delivered by a fictional psych-rock band called Drimble Wedge and the Vegetations, with Peter Cook deadpanning the lyrics (“I’m not available / You fill me with inertia”). Dudley recorded several instrumental versions, recasting the heavily flanged rock song as a gentle bossa nova.\n\nCornfield – from Bedazzled\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n30 Is A Dangerous Age, Cynthia – from the 1968 British romantic comedy film starring Dudley Moore and Suzy Kendall.\n\nSad One For George – from The Other Side of Dudley Moore, dedicated to George Hastings who took him in when Moore’s marriage broke down. Dudley repaid him by running off with his wife. Featured a beautiful bass solo by Simon Thorpe.\n\nLove Me/ The Millionaire – both from Bedazzled. Anguished cries of “Love Me!” are played over a shuffling pop background in the film. Dudley, who spent most of his life in psychotherapy, once said that “Playing Jazz was my way of asking for the love I didn’t get as a child.” As Chris said, “Dudley playing piano is a man revealed.”\n\nAmalgam – a sprightly piece of continental minimalism from Dudley’s self-titled 1969 album, The Dudley Moore Trio. It was his first set of entirely original material and here performed by the quartet with serene long notes from Paul Higgs on trumpet and flugelhorn with Chris Ingham underpinning them on piano.\n\nYesterdays(Jerome Kern) – from the 1966 album on Decca Records, Genuine Dud.\n\nWaltz for Suzy – from the 1991 album, Songs Without Words.\n\nSong for Suzy – from the 1971 album, Today. Both this number and the previous one were dedicated to Dudley’s first wife and actress, Suzy Kendall.\n\nEncore: Goodbye-ee Pete and Dud’s 1965 Top 20 hit. This was the closing song from their 1960s sketch show Not Only But Also.\n\nThoughts on Jazz Africa – 10 April 2024\n\nSteve (and a bit of Dave) says:\n\nI'm still basking in the euphoria from last night's Jazz Africa performance. There were many astounding moments throughout both sets from our six musicians. Yes, six, because we had a guest star on percussion! During the first set, six-year-old Jackson sat in the centre aisle in front of Tony Kofi. He had a water bottle that he used to add to the percussion on stage. Tony brought him on to the stage, gave him a maraca and he played with the band during \"Aloka Party\". It will be something he will never forget (and nor will we).\n\nFrom the exuberant, life-affirming music of Africa's best-known jazz saxophonist, Manu Dibango, and the pioneer of Afrobeat, Fela Kuti, the gig started as it intended to carry on with an infectious blend of funk, jazz and traditional African rhythms. You could dance to the music throughout both sets and its humanity incited the purest joy. The rhythm was key throughout, with each member of the band playing percussion instruments (claves, bones, drums, congas and maracas) at some point. Stuart Fidler, while plucking the strings of his guitar with two fingers in the typical musical style of West African highlife, almost managed to play a hand drum at the same time! Encouraged by Basil Hodge and Tony, different sections of our audience contributed handclapping that created some complex polyrhythms. Winston Clifford managed to do all of that single-handed on his drumkit and amazed us all with his prodigious skills and inventiveness. It was wonderful to have Winston back at the Fleece after so long. We were also reminded of his many talents from his beautiful vocals on Abdullah Ibrahim's 'African Marketplace', a song with deep political roots (see setlist). The polyrhythms were enhanced by bassist Mike Edmunds: as well as providing the pulse and the harmonies, he used the bass guitar as a percussive instrument.\n\nAside from his warmth and playfulness, Tony Kofi reaffirmed his place as a firm favourite with our audiences with his versatility and superhuman energy on a range of saxophones and how the sound from his horn just continues to soar. I just didn't want it to stop on 'African Marketplace'.\n\nJazz Africa is of course Basil Hodge's baby, although he would be the first to emphasise that it is a team effort. Aside from his use of claves and handclaps, he led with some excellent work on the electric piano as well as acoustic, managing to make both sound authentic and vital in the African music setting, so that the electric piano could be mistaken for a marimba at times.\n\nOne more mention of our highly appreciative and enthusiastic audience: there was, as we predicted, 'dancing in the aisles' with some wild moves from our technical team and others who could not restrain themselves and celebrated the joy of African Jazz in a truly honest and human way.\n\nOn 24 April, the much acclaimed gig, \"The Music of Dudley Moore\" will be with us, with composer, pianist, and brilliant presenter Chris Ingham, Paul Higgs on trumpet, Simon Thorpe on bass, and drummer George Double. Tickets are going well for this gig, so do try not to miss it.\n\nJAZZ AFRICA: THE ORIGINS FROM ROOTS TO NOW\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 10/4/24\n\nSoul Makossa (Manu Dibango) – an international hit for Dibango in 1972 that inspired (and was effectively borrowed by) the later music of Michael Jackson among others. Makossa is a dance tradition of the Douala people in Cameroon, where Dibango was born.\n\nShakara (Fela Kuti)\n\nMannenberg (Abdullah Ibrahim, formerly known as Dollar Brand) Mannenberg is a township of Cape Town, South Africa, that was created by the apartheid government for low-income “Coloured” families in 1966 as a result of the forced removal campaign by the National Party. The song became an anthem of the struggle against Apartheid, evoking South Africa’s dark past but also celebrating its people and their courageous resistance to oppression.\n\nAloka Party (Manu Dibango)\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nWater No Got No Enemy (Fela Kuti)\n\nAfrican Marketplace (Abdullah Ibrahim)\n\nBig Blow (Manu Dibango)\n\nGoro City (Manu Dibango)\n\nNiger Mambo (Randy Weston)\n\nOn Wednesday 12 June “Conversations with Bill”: A Celebration of Bill Evans with The Adrian York Trio – £18\n\nAdrian York Piano\n\nPaul Whitten Double Bass\n\nMark Fletcher Drums\n\nJoin us for an intimate evening of impressionistic harmony and pure beauty as we experience the lyrical compositions of the iconic pianist and multi-instrumentalist Bill Evans. Conversations with Bill explores the repertoire and recordings, compositions and piano style of this great and most distinctive of all jazz pianists.\n\nLike many of his peers, Bill Evans’ short life was challenged by both his genius and the challenges that faced his generation, but he left a legacy of stunning and very beautiful music that still influences musicians of today. Presented by musician, educator and broadcaster Adrian York, this promises to be a truly interesting and inspiring session.\n\nDr Adrian York began his musical career in the early 1980s as a member of a swing-pop band Roman Holliday. He then worked for a plethora of artists from the worlds of pop, jazz and light entertainment including Jimmy Ruffin, Shirley Bassey and Paul Young. In the jazz world he has performed with Ian Shaw, Ronny Jordan, Jean Toussaint, Tim Garland, Tina May and Alan Barnes as well as being musical director for a host of Jazz FM live acts.\n\nPaul Whitten has been described as \"the best jazz bassist in the South of England\" by promoters of the Swanage Jazz Festival. Another music critic said that \"Paul Whitten played very sensitively. His tone is sweet and woody - not too much bass or treble. I really like Paul's solo style. His lines are more like those you would want to sing. His solos are sweet and very clean, melodic.\"\n\nMark Fletcher is one of the UK’s most versatile and in demand drummers. Equally at home in straight ahead jazz, free improvised music, rock and world music, Mark was the house drummer at Ronnie Scott’s for 12 years and has played there and in leading venues around the world since the late '80s. Amongst others, he has worked with Dizzy Gillespie, Mark Murphy, Michel Legrand, James Moody, Dave Gilmore, Tim Garland, Liane Carroll, Norma Winstone, Georgie Fame, Ian Shaw, Cedar Walton and Kenny Wheeler. Mark also leads his own band, Fletch’s Brew, renowned for playing original compositions and new arrangements from across the jazz canon.\n\nThoughts on The Jon Lloyd Quartet\n\nSteve says:\n\nWe had quite a different style of Jazz last night from that heard over recent weeks at Fleece Jazz, but one that was exceedingly welcome. The music was quiet and contemplative - a joy to listen to and also to watch the musicians play with such passion and enjoyment. Alex Goodyear was clearly transported by the music, seemingly enraptured by the sound that the band made collectively. Alex brought a delicate touch to his drumkit that was a wonder to behold, reminding me of the American drummer, Brian Blade, as he used the whole kit in a gentle and yet expressive way. The image of him finishing one number by simply shaking his brushes in the air encapsulated the fragile beauty of the music heard over the course of the evening. I suppose the others were not as animated as Alex, but they were none the less vital to the whole sound. Nick Pini's sensitive propulsive playing, John Law's classically trained pianism and the beautiful melodicism heard from Jon Lloyd's tenor and soprano saxes, as well as in his strong and accessible compositions.\n\nP.S. I have ordered both CDs that were on sale last night but were sold out before I could get my copies. This was my first exposure to the music and musicianship of Jon Lloyd. I am converted!\n\nDave says:\n\nI had been looking forward to this gig since it was booked. Jon Lloyd’sprevious appearance at the club was over ten years ago, and that music is still in my mind. We need to have him again, much sooner than 10 years from now.\n\nJohn Law walked into the room, sat at the piano, and ripped off an impossible Bach fugue at great speed, and then played it as it should be heard. I think it was a warm-up after a very long drive from his home in Somerset. He held that level of pianism throughout the evening. Jon’s music is not difficult, but it is nuanced, and John covered every nuance with either hand.\n\nNick Piniwarmed up with bowed Bach. We got a bit of bowing from him in the last number, “The Heron”. His pizzicato was the pulse under a lyrical style of playing.\n\nJon produced a warm, sustained and clear sound throughout on both tenor and soprano. It was his writing throughout the evening. The melodies were lovely, a few were appropriately tough.\n\nThrough the first set, I had a hankering for an upbeat song. Jon seems not to do these. Then, in the last tune of the set, “Earth Song”, Alex Goodyear produced an extended intro with hands only. It was visually spectacular, and came as close to singing that I have ever heard on drums.\n\nOn 10 April, Jazz Africa, lead buy Basil Hodge, will carry us from the roots of jazz to jazz today. Basil is on piano, with saxophonist Tony Kofi, Winston Clifford on drums, Jihad Darwish on bass and Stuart Fiddler on guitar. It will be a special evening.\n\nDo note that the Jazz Africa gig will start at 8:15pm, doors at 7:45pm.\n\nTHE JON LLOYD QUARTET\n\nSEATLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 27/3/24\n\nAll compositions by Jon Lloyd\n\nBreaking the Waves\n\nCinq Feuilles\n\nFlux\n\nAnima\n\nEarth Song\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nAl’Afiyah\n\nYaga\n\nMeta Meta\n\nThe Heron\n\nThoughts on The Gaz Hughes Trio – Nuclear Bebopalypse, 13 March 2024\n\nThe piano trio is my favourite form, and bebop my favourite style, so my expectations were high for this gig. My expectations were greatly exceeded. Leader Gaz Hughes’ drumming, Andrzej Baranek’s pianism and Gavin Barras’ bass playing (with lots of lovely bowing) all were superb musicians. As people were leaving, I heard one say “what an amazing bassist!”, another said “that wonderful pianist has a proper left hand”, and a third comment that Gaz “was a drummer to hear again and again”.\n\nThe three were tight together from the off, although the intensely listening audience was a bit of a surprise. By the third number, they were visibly having fun. After the gig, Gaz commented on this gig being so good, I guess compared to others on their long tour. They played for us music that they knew well, no music or music stands, but it sounded fresh as a summer sun shower.\n\nI won’t even try to pick out a favourite.\n\nSteve said:\n\n“I am currently revisiting last night's Bebopalypse here, listening to each of the two Gaz Hughes Trio CDs that I bought during the interval. We were treated to a good mix of original material, covers and standards with each of those immensely talented and soulful musicians playing their hearts out. Hats off to the rhythmically strong and fluid playing of Andrzej Baranek but also to the ever-creative Gaz Hughes using everything at his disposal on the drum kit and the ever-engaging style of Gavin Barras on double bass.\n\nI can't help thinking that a good few regulars and occasional visitors to the Fleece missed a Bebopportunity last night. The attached setlist will give some idea.”\n\nThat gig was a beauty. But we have another much anticipated beauty for you on Wednesday 27 March. It has been too long since we have heard The Jon Lloyd Quartet. We will have Jon on reeds and the superb pianist John Law, with Nick Pini on bass and drummer Alex Goodyear. Don’t miss this one.\n\nTake care,\n\nDave\n\nTHE GAZ HUGHES TRIO: “NUCLEAR BEBOPALYPSE”\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 13/3/24\n\nBeboptical Illusion (Gaz Hughes)\n\nAB’s Blues (Andrzej Baranek)\n\nBeautiful Moons Ago (Oscar Moore / Nat King Cole)\n\nSatin Doll (Duke Ellington/Billy Strayhorn)\n\nLullaby of Birdland (George Shearing)\n\nAlice In Wonderland (Sammy Fain)\n\nNuclear Bebopalypse (Andrzej Baranek/Gaz Hughes)\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nI Mean You (Thelonious Monk)\n\nDisinformation (Gavin Barras)\n\nShootin’ from the Hip!

The whole band were on fire, with the irrepressible Noel and Derek leading from the front, catering for a range of music lover, from the die-hard Stevie fans to the old jazzers. Looking around, it was heart-warming to witness such unanimous enjoyment; we had dancing, handclapping, communal singing and sheer delight in the faces of our sell-out audience.\n\nI have seen the same show at a larger venue, as had the couple next to me from Northampton, but we all agreed that last night's experience was superior because of the warmth and intimacy of the atmosphere. Watching Derek seemingly play directly to individual audience members and Noel appearing to serenade others during the encore , the Fleece-effect was working its old magic, and we got the special treatment from musicians who love to visit the club.\n\nCheck out the setlist below.\n\nDave says:\n\nTechnically, this was a very complex gig, but we got complemented on the sound. And what sound we got. Six master musicians having the time of their lives. Stunning keyboardist Neil Angilley and top drummer Nic France were amazing. Nic was absolutely in party mode. Tim Cansfield was solid on electric guitars, and lyrical on the acoustic guitar. It was brilliant to see and hear Laurence Cottle: we got a top international player as a dep. Noel McCalla and Derek Nash drove the show. They fired off each other.\n\nIt was an exciting day from the soundcheck to the strike. I want to remember this one when I am asked “what is the best gig you have had at Fleece Jazz”.\n\nBebop alert! on March 13, Gaz Hughes will bring the excellent piano trio to delight us with “Nuclear Bebopalypes”, With Andrzej Baranek on piano and Gavin Barras on bass.

Wakey Blakey should be prescribed by the NHS as a tonic for all ailments affecting humankind.\"- Trevor Bannister, The Jazz Mann\n\n'Wakey Blakey' is a new band featuring some of the finest talent on the British Jazz scene playing the music of legendary drummer Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers but with the lesser-known sextet line-up as exemplified by the stellar 1960s front-line of Freddie Hubbard, Curtis Fuller, Wayne Shorter, Cedar Walton, Reggie Workman and Art himself. Led jointly by Rory Ingham and James Davison, this project demonstrates hard bop with a frighteningly fresh feel; the music is wildly high-energy and unbelievably swinging.\n\nOf the two joint leaders, Rory Ingham (Jam Experiment, Bonsai), a first-class honours graduate of the Royal Academy of Music, is also an educator and composer. While still a student he was a runner-up in the 2016 Trombonist of the Year, winner of the 2017 British Jazz Awards Rising Star, and in 2018 winner of the British Trombone Society Awards. Jazzwise magazine credited his“effortless virtuosity\" while London Jazz News described his style as “richly melodic…”. The other joint leader, James Davison, while still at the Royal Academy of Music was winner of both the Smith-Watkins Trumpet Award (2016) and the Musicians’ Company Young Jazz Musicians Award (2018). A brilliant award-winning trumpeter, he graduated with an MA in Jazz Performance and for this project he undertook the mammoth task of faithfully transcribing the Sextet arrangements from the original albums on Riverside and Blue Note.\n\nAlex Garnett has been one of the leading saxophonists in the UK and Mainland Europe for over two decades, being instantly recognized by his dark, husky sound. A versatile musician and first call sideman, he has enjoyed success as both a jazz artist, composer and arranger, and an in-demand session, studio and commercial saxophonist, having racked up countless recording credits along the way.\n\nMatt Carter studied jazz piano at The Royal Academy of Music under the guidance of Nikki Iles, Tom Cawley and Gwilym Simcock, and studied composition with Pete Churchill.. During that time Matt was involved in some incredible projects including a big band project with Chris Potter and Dave Holland, a small band project run by Laurence Cottle and a symphonic brass project run by Mike Lovett. According to Jazzwise magazine \"Carter’s own piano is as tasteful and neatly phrased as you could wish.\"\n\nAward-winning, London-based jazz bass player, composer and arranger Misha Mullov-Abbado is a musician who combines great imagination with raw talent and a clear vision. A BBC New Generation Artist and with a \"melodic gift\" (John Fordham, The Guardian) and ability to masterfully combine beautifully-crafted compositions with free-spirited improvisation.\n\nTaking the role of Art Blakey is Luke Tomlinson, a London based professional musician, drummer, band leader and educator. Since graduating in 2019 from the Royal Academy of Music with a First Class Honours Degree, Luke has begun to firmly establish himself as one of the most in-demand young musicians in London, performing regularly at some of the most prestigious venues in the UK, include the Royal Festival Hall, the Barbican, Birmingham Symphony Hall, Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club, Jazz Café Camden as well as a number of performances on BBC Radio 2 and Radio 3.\n\nWe’re looking forward to a brilliant evening of swinging, high energy jazz.\n\nOn Wednesday 22 May 2024, The Clark Tracey Quintet £18\n\nClark Tracey Drums\n\nSimon Allen Tenor sax\n\nRJ Gilbert Alto sax\n\nDavid Newton Piano\n\nAndrew Cleyndert Bass\n\n\"One of the most impressive jazz drummers today” – The Times\n\nClark Tracey is a well-established jazz master who is recognised as an inventive jazz drummer and as a proven group leader, writer and arranger, having appeared over many years with the world’s jazz greats. He creates educational Master Classes across the U.K. and continues to be an in-demand performer across the world. He has revived the famous jazz suites written by his late father, the great pianist & composer Stan Tracey, bringing masterpieces such as \"Under Milkwood\" successfully to admiring younger audiences.\n\nSimon Allen is a critically acclaimed, award winning saxophonist, composer and educator who has worked with the Laurence Cottle All Star Big band and made numerous other appearances as a guest soloist as well as with his own quartets and quintets. In addition, he has recorded and performed with Sir Paul McCartney, Birmingham Royal Ballet, Phil Collins, Jamie Cullum, Beverly Knight and many, many more. “Allen...brings a searing urgency... [and] an anthemic soul-jazzy heat” - The Guardian Simon Allen\n\nAlto saxophonist, RJ Gilbert is a young jazz musician who is still studying at Birmingham Conservatoire and already making waves on the UK jazz scene.\n\nDavid Newton has been voted ‘Best Jazz Pianist sixteen times by the Jazz audience of the UK. A few years after graduating from the Leeds College of Music his old roommate from college, Alan Barnes, persuaded him to move to London where he rapidly became a much sought after pianist teaming up with Barnes, guitarist Martin Taylor and saxophonist Don Weller. Later, he gained a reputation as an exquisite accompanist for singers such as Marion Montgomery, Tina May, Annie Ross, Claire Martin and of course Stacey Kent, with whom he spent the next ten years recording and travelling all over the world. For many years he has been the honorary president of Fleece Jazz and we always look forward to hearing him play.\n\nAndrew Cleyndert started out in the bands of Don Weller and Bobby Wellins and has since flourished on the jazz scene in the UK and beyond. He has played and toured with the cream of the UK’s musicians and a string of international soloists, including Bud Shank, George Coleman, Ray Bryant, Lee Konitz and James Moody. He was also closely associated with Stan Tracey in his many bands over fifteen years until Stan’s death in 2013. Further afield, Andy has worked in Europe with pianists Gene Harris, Benny Green, Junior Mance and Tamir Hendleman.\n\nThoughts on John Etheridge’s “Blue Spirits” – 14 February 2024\n\nDave here, still buzzing from \"Blue Spirits\". We delight in them every time they come, but this time: John Etheridge, Pete Whittaker and George Double were in an intense and happy mood. It was special. A favourite? Difficult, but I know \"Soul Eyes\" and this band's rendition was a knockout.\n\nSteve loved it too, and provided words and the setlist.\n\nTake care,\n\nDave\n\nI know this is getting to be a regular thing but WOW! Of the three occasions when I have seen the Blue Spirits Trio, that had to be the very best. John was on great form musically, but a special mention must go to Pete Whittaker for his performance on organ which added a whole new layer to the sound of John's guitar and created a beautiful and exhilarating wall of sound effect together with George Double's drumwork. A lot of people (a lot, was it 100?) went home very happy and I heard one lady enthusing during the interval queue for CDs saying that it was her first time at Fleece Jazz and that she wants to come back for the Jazz Africa gig.\n\nStand out moment for me was the heart-wrenching encore \"Little Wing\" - a truly emotional performance with which to round off the evening.\n\nJohn Etheridge’s “Blue Spirits” 14th February 2024\n\nBig Yellow Taxi (Joni Mitchell)\n\nYou Don’t Know Me (Eddy Arnold/Cindy Walker) Best known by Ray Charles’ version\n\nFungii Mama (Blue Mitchell)\n\nThe Stars Apart (John Etheridge)\n\nCold, Cold Heart (Hank Williams)\n\nDistant Voice (John Etheridge)\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nGod Bless The Child (Billie Holliday & Arthur Herzog Junior) Solo guitar performance by John Etheridge\n\nSecret Love (Sammy Fain/Paul Francis Webster) Best known by Doris Day’s version from Calamity Jane, later covered by Kathy Kirby\n\nSoul Eyes (Mal Waldron )\n\nDo Like Eddie (John Scofield) Dedicated to Eddie Harris\n\nCause We’ve Ended as Lovers (Stevie Wonder) Best known by Jeff Beck’s performance on ‘Blow by Blow’ but also performed by Syreeta on ‘Stevie Wonder presents Syreeta\n\nFirst Moves (Sonny Rollins)\n\nEncore: Little Wing (Jimi Hendrix)\n\nThoughts on Cannonball and Nat – 24 January 2024\n\nDave here, still reeling after last night’s wonderful gig. Thinking of what to write, the word “Joyous” was first to pop out. Then I read Steve’s letter with the set list attached. He wrote…\n\nWhat an utterly joyous gig we had last night courtesy of \"Cannonball and Nat\" aka Pete Long, Ryan Quigley, Chris Ingham, Malcolm Creese and George Double.\n\nIt was a revelation, a totally uninhibited celebration of the wonderful music of the Adderley brothers. Much thanks must go to the exuberant and hilarious compering of Pete Long, who whipped our audience into a good-natured frenzy, but also the driving energy of all of the musicians. It would be difficult and, in fact, pointless to single out any of the numbers as a high point - there was absolutely no let-up in the pace of the performance except for the ballad medley which the musicians (and audience) needed to get their breath back. That said, particular favourites with our audience were The Jive Samba and Mercy, Mercy, Mercy with the accompanying whoops and hollers echoing and recapturing the enthusiasm of the crowds in the original recordings. But then what about Jeanine and Sticks and Ryan Quigley's beautiful rendition of Skylark.\n\nA lot of people went home elated and content last night thanks to the boundless energy of five very hard-working musicians. I had a view across the stage and the looks of unashamed pleasure in the faces of the audience said it all.\n\nSteve\n\nI would just add that the trading 8’s and 4’s between the two horns in “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” was spectacular.\n\nWe are greatly looking forward the the great guitarist and storyteller John Etheridge, with Pete Whitaker on organ and drummer George Double. I hope to see you with us on Wednesday February 14th.\n\nTake care,\n\nDave\n\n“CANNONBALL & NAT”\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 24/1/24\n\nFiddler on the Roof (Jerry Bock & Sheldon Harnick)\n\nSave Your Love for Me (Buddy Johnson) from the album Nancy Wilson/Cannonball Adderley.\n\nUnit 7 (Sam Jones) also from the album Nancy Wilson/Cannonball Adderley.\n\nJive Samba (Nat Adderley)\n\nAzule Serape (Victor Feldman)\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nDel Sasser (Sam Jones)\n\nJeanine (Duke Pearson)\n\nI’m In the Mood For Love(Jimmy McHugh) /Laura(David Raksin) /Skylark (Hoagy Carmichael)\n\nSticks (Julian Adderley)\n\nMercy, Mercy, Mercy (Josef Zawinul)\n\nEncore: Work Song (Nat Adderley/Oscar Brown Jr)\n\nThoughts on Q3 featuring Kevin Flanagan – 10 January 2024\n\nThe first gig of 2024 was a great start to what looks like a very exciting season. I note that we described Kevin Flanagan as “master saxophonist”, and boy, he blew a stunning gig. Kevin is very well known to us and loved, but the other three who were new to us, were masters as well.\n\nThe band was led by pianist and composer Martin Hallmark. All but two of the tunes played were his compositions. He gave us a varied programme of thoughtful music. He is a wonderful pianist.\n\nDerek Scurll knows how to play the room. He is a very skilled drummer, perfect support for the band.\n\nThe revelation was 5 string electric bassist Tiago Coimbra. His speed and invention were quite wonderful. He used a little stomp box on two numbers that I noticed. The effects were very appropriate to the tunes, and they did not blast distortion at us. The last tune of the first set, “Nomads”, was a lovely example of that (see Steves note in the set list).\n\nSteve actually got the set list from Martin: it is a bit of a rarity to have a programme solidly fixed. So when the audience asked for an encore, they had nothing ready. Kevin suggests a blues, which was met with approval. He titled it “Born of Desperation”. Without the restriction of written music, the four of them blew a beautiful blues.\n\nNext up, on the 24 of the month, tenorist Pete Long and trumpeter Ryan Quigley will celebrate the music of the brothers Cannonball and Nat Adderly, with Chris Ingham on piano, Malcolm Creese on bass and George Double on drums. It will be a cracker. Do join us.\n\nTake care\n\nDave\n\nQ3 featuring KEVIN FLANAGAN\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 10/1/24\n\nAll numbers composed by Martin Hallmark except for African Skies which was composed by Michael Brecker.\n\nThrough the Clouds\n\nOdyssey – played as a trio and a homage to the late, great Chick Corea with whom Martin spent some time in a piano workshop.\n\nLost at Sea\n\nN.J.B.\n\nA Good Day For Breathing\n\nEmerald Eyes\n\nNomads – a middle eastern flavoured number with Tiago Coimbra’s electric bass sounding like an oud!\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nFuzzy Hacker-tat\n\nAfrican Skies\n\nRondo di Girulata\n\nEquipoise\n\nWater Speckled Midnight\n\nNocturne – reflecting Martin’s attempts to play Chopin during the pandemic credited for getting his left hand moving better on the piano.\n\nTurnaround Time (Martin Hallmark)\n\nENCORE: A Blues\n\nThoughts on Ben, Bean, Bird and Barnes, Thursday 28 December 2023\n\nWhen Steve sent over the setlist below, he said, “What a wonderful gig with which to finish the year and Fleece season. Alan is a brilliant compere as well as a huge talent.”. I can’t imagine that anyone in the crowd (and what a crowd it was) would disagree. It was being at home with jazz royalty: raconteur Alan Barnes on alto sax, clarinet, and baritone sax; Vasilis Xenopoulos on tenor sax; Jim Watson on piano; Andrew Cleyndert on bass; Clark Tracey on drums. The gig included music composed and performed by Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins (nicknamed Bean) and Charlie Parker, and two by Alan. There was time for everybody to have extended solos. I have no favourites: it was a spectacularly good evening.\n\nAlan played the audience superbly. There was just enough information about each tune to satisfy, with anecdotes about the three B’s, and he had us in stitches with his easy pointed humour. I got the strong impression from watching the other four performers that Alan was improvising his chat. We know him well, but his musical speed and invention still surprises us. He made a joke about using the clarinet on “Body and Soul” as a chance to practice, and then used his incredible technique to enhance his feelings for the song and for Vasilis’ solos.\n\nJim’s solo on the first number, “Bean and the Boys”, was truly exciting, and our quiet listening audience was whooping after it. If you are going to play Ben Webster tunes, the warm tenor saxophone tone produced by Vasilis seemed perfect. Andrew if anything has grown as a bassist over the years; solid pulse with constant invention. And Clark; continuous genius at work. But the key from all four that made it so brilliant was the palpable listening.\n\nIt has been a very good year at Fleece Jazz. Band after band came and played for us, playing wonderfully and showing us the huge range that the genre has. B, B, B, and Barnes was a stunning climax to the year. But it would be wrong to end this note without thanks to the people who volunteer to make the club work.\n\nSo what about next year? Well, starting off with Kevin Flanagan on sax is a very good beginning. The Martin Hallmark (piano) quartet, with Kevin, Tiago Coimbra on bass and drummer Derek Scurll is on Wednesday 10 January, It will be great to have your company for the gig.\n\nTake care,\n\nDave\n\nBEN, BEAN, BIRD AND BARNES\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 28/12/23\n\nBean and the Boys (Coleman Hawkins) – based on ‘Lover Come Back To Me’\n\nLos Caracoles (Alan Barnes)\n\nWalking the Frog (Ben Webster) BW was jokingly referred to as ‘The Frog’ by fellow musicians owing to his facial appearance and not, as Alan Barnes suggested, because he could catch insects with his tongue!\n\nBody and Soul (Johnny Green/Edward Heyman, Robert Sour, Frank Eyton) – a jazz standard and ballad notably performed by both Ben Webster and Coleman Hawkins.\n\nBillie’s Bounce (Charlie Parker)\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nSpotlite (Coleman Hawkins)\n\nDid You Call Her Today?

Initially inspired by the music of Wayne Shorter with a style reminiscent of John Coltrane, the group includes pianist Ross Stanley, bassist Riaan Vosloo and drummer Tim Giles. Together for over ten years, they have forged a unique identity of powerfully driven fire music with atmospheric improvised soundscapes that draws from original compositions and fresh interpretations of the American songbook repertoire.\n\nThe programme featured a mix of material from the For Your Ears Only album, a couple of newer, yet to be recorded pieces and four remarkable explorations of jazz standards. The opener, ‘Nomadology’, featured Jones’ Coltranesque tenor sax floating above the rolling grooves generated by Stanley, Vosloo and Giles but there’s plenty of variation along the way with subtle changes of rhythm and tempo keeping things interesting and allowing Jones to stretch out and probe to good effect. The leader’s consistently engaging solo is followed by an expansive excursion from Stanley as he matched Jones for imagination with a skilfully constructed solo.\n\nNext up was the popular standard, ‘It Could Happen to You’, written by Jimmy Van Heusen and originally performed by Dorothy Lamour in the musical And The Angels Sing in 1944, with lyrics written by Johnny Burke. Notable jazz recordings include those by Chet Baker, Miles Davis, Bill Evans and Bud Powell. A haunting melody with a laid-back rhythm, Jones states the theme on tenor before handing over to Stanley and we are reminded of his formidable skills as a pianist. Both soloists are well served by the supple, fluent grooves generated by the experienced rhythm team of Vosloo and Giles throughout.\n\nEd then announces that we are about to hear the “East Coast debut” of new composition, ‘Passing Time and Melancholy’, an impressive and atmospheric offering from the pen of Riaan Vosloo providing a welcome contrast to the first two numbers. The tension between the structured and the free is evident throughout as themes are sketched or suggested.\n\nThe first set closes with another standard, ‘All or Nothing at All’, composed in 1939 by Arthur Altman and made famous by Frank Sinatra soon after with lyrics by Jack Lawrence. The all-too-familiar melody temporarily suggests a return to more orthodox jazz territory but there’s an intensity about the music that is sometimes reminiscent of John Coltrane or McCoy Tyner.\n\nThe second set is ushered in by another fresh composition, Riaan Vosloo’s quirkily named ‘Tune 3 (Sneaky Snakes)’. This was a more reflective offering, a slow burner of a piece, the kind of abstract but evocative ballad that wouldn’t sound out of place on an ECM recording. We reverted to another well-loved jazz standard with ‘Star Eyes’ before reaching what was to be the final announced number.\n\nGiven a choice of three numbers, our audience picked ‘Solstice’, another impressive and atmospheric offering from the pen of Riaan Vosloo. Beginning appropriately with the deep, woody sound of the composer’s melodic double bass before being joined by the eerie shimmer of Giles’ cymbals, it is yet another long, slow-burning performance with Jones’ tenor smouldering rather than blazing in the tune’s early stages. It slowly unfolds with Jones soloing above waltz-like piano chording and the flowing drum colourations of Giles. Stanley builds up the tension before gradually releasing it again before Jones segues into a stunning, Coltrane-inspired version of the classic jazz ballad ‘Body and Soul’. As the last note fades, gasps and a “Follow that!” are heard from our great listening audience who had responded to this superb original music with enthusiasm throughout.\n\nWe will try to “follow that” in two weeks’ time on THURSDAY 28th December when we celebrate the festive season with Ben, Bean, Bird and Barnes. An outstanding quintet, led by Alan Barnes, pays homage to three of the most influential giants of Jazz – Ben Webster, Coleman “Bean” Hawkins and Charlie “Bird” Parker. Please join us for what promises to be a gig full of outstanding tunes from the golden eras of swing and bebop played with passion and musical verve.\n\nMerry Christmas to you all and a Happy and Peaceful New Year.\n\nSteve Jordan\n\nED JONES QUARTET\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 13/12/23\n\n1.

Not this time. It was Joanna’s show, and what a wonderful show it was. She took us from the beginning of Ella Fitzgerald’s career to the end. She was backed by Chris on piano, Andres Lafone on bass and George Double on drums, a perfect trio to support the lady (\"Ella's fellas\").\n\nJoanna had structured the programme beautifully. She opened with a blast, “Get Happy”, which Ella often opened with. She kept to the structure of Ella’s career. I did not know that she wrote the second verse to “Manhattan” to get her birthplace in (it's Yonkers). Her early life was a mile less than a joy, so “Someone to Watch Over Me” was spot on with Joanna’s narrative.\n\nAnd then “A-Tisket-A-Tasket”, a simple number based on an old nursery rhyme with a tune identical to that other children's rhyme \"It's Raining, It's Pouring\". This was Ella's audition piece that won her first prize with a song at a dance contest and went on to become her breakthrough hit with the Chick Webb Orchestra in 1938.\n\nJoanna’s story-telling was illuminating throughout the gig. Her singing was all we expected of her. She is a musician to the core, with phrasing, timbre and her presentation integral to the song she is presenting. That is a real joy.\n\nShe had songs with pairs and individuals from the trio. Chris is a superb accompanist. Andres is new to us: he is a terrific bassist, and his work with Joanna was lovely. A song with just George? Amazing.\n\nJoanna told us that Ella fell in love with bebop, and actually took lessons from Dizzy Gillespie. Oh, to be a fly on the wall for those lessons! “ A Night in Tunisia” and “How High the Moon” gave Joanna space to scat, and she was excellent. Famously, while performing in West Berlin in 1960, Ella launched into a cover of \"Mack The Knife\". She didn't know the lyrics too well and midway through the song, she completely forgot them. When in doubt, what does a jazz singer do? Scat! Ella's version went on to become a big Grammy-winning performance from her live album, Ella in Berlin, proving what an expert improviser she was.\n\nIt was a pleasure to see how our large audience hung on every note as they watched Joanna and the band with love and admiration. Every number was enthusiastically received; the murmurs of warm appreciation were clearly audible as she launched into \"The Man I Love\" at the end of the first set, \"The Very Thought of You\" and \"Miss Otis Regrets\" in the second set. It would be difficult and an unnecessary diversion to pick a favourite moment as the whole performance was seamless and went far too quickly before the audience were calling for an encore. Our band, generous as ever, obliged with the tear-jerking \"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\" - a fitting end to a wonderful evening's performance.\n\nOn Wednesday 13 December, we get to hear the power of award winning saxophonist Ed Jones.

After the gig, Trish was radiant: she was happy with the performance, but she spoke about the club. She mentioned the setup, the help, the sound (thank you). Her music is not easy, and not to everybody’s taste. It requires some work and close listening, and some thought afterward. This is my favourite kind of music.\n\nThe musicianship, of course, was splendid. The band was led by Trish Clowes on tenor sax, Ross Stanley on Hammond B3, Chris Montague on guitar, and drummer Joel Barford.\n\nThe band’s music is about power, freedom and variety. The first thing we hear on “Brooke”, the first number of the gig, is Joel’s emphatic repeated riff, almost like a drum version of a baroque ground bass.Through most of the tunes, the mood and tempo varied, from almost frantic explosions of sound to the soft, warm sounds of a ballad. All four of them produced an amazing range of sound. Note that this was not free jazz. They were reading the intros and heads. They did have considerable obligato freedom during other people’s solos.\n\nTrish is an exceptional player. She seems to use her entire body to produce the sounds. There were growls, bright clear sounds and beautiful soft balladic sequences. Her up tempo solos found her playing at quite incredible speed, but it seemed to me that it always had meaning. She also announced the tunes with enough explanation, no extended anecdotes.\n\nChris used his minimal stomp box set very well to provide colours appropriate to the music. He is embedded in Trish’s writing, and if I understand correctly, was involved in the orchestration. He had some spectacular solos.\n\nJoel also had some solos to remember. He is a very powerful drummer, but with the ability to switch to brushes and be almost lyrical in the balladic sections of some tunes. His position in the centre of the stage rather than the more usual position with us, to one side, emphasized his central drive of the music.\n\nAnd Ross. We have always anticipated with delight his arrival on organ especially, and on piano. He did not disappoint, but how he played was quite different from the standard jazz organ repertoire. I knew that the Hammond B3 was a versatile instrument, but for Trish’s music, Ross made it like a whole sound effects department. The sounds matched Trish, with howls, explosions, and most often lyrical improvisation. I just loved his work.\n\nThis all sounds very po-faced and serious. It was certainly not. Trish, Ross, Chris and Joel had a great time. So did we. So did Steve, who supplied the set list below.\n\nThe next gig will be very different: we will have Joanna Eden and the Chris Ingham Trio – “Embraceable Ella”. Joanna is a stunning vocalist. I expect that between Joanna and Chris, the research will be immaculate and often very funny. So come expecting the music of a great icon played and sung by wonderful musicians.\n\nTake care,\n\nDave\n\nTRISH CLOWES MY IRIS QUARTET\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 08/11/23\n\nBrooke (Trish Clowes)\n\nUncle (Trish Clowes)\n\nAnother One For Wayne (Trish Clowes) – a tribute to the late, great Wayne Shorter.

There are plenty of typical swing elements, augmented by soulful ballads and fiery funk outings. The aim is to groove and move!\n\nJohn’s history includes playing with Grapelli, heading Zapatistas, duos with John Williams, and his own bands.

The quartet comprises the virtuosic John Law (Congregation, Re-Creations) on piano, Nick Pini (Jonathan Gee, Iain Ballamy) on double bass and Alex Goodyear (Yetii) on drums.\n\n“Lloyd’s tunes are steeped in the ECM aesthetic, and he and long-time collaborator John Law on piano make it sound like the only music you ever want to hear.” - John Turney, London Jazz News (Swanage Festival, July 2023)\n\nThis tour we are playing music from our new Ubuntu release “Earth Songs” for the first time!\n\n“We present melodic, exciting and engaging compositions written by me specifically for this quartet. The members of this group have a wealth of experience across jazz and contemporary music and interpret my pieces perfectly; with intelligence, energy, sensitivity, respect and enormous skill. - Jon Lloyd, October 2023\n\nHere is an excellent review of the band.\n\nOn Wednesday 24 April The Music of Dudley Moore – £18\n\nChris Ingham Piano\n\nPaul Higgs Trumpet\n\nSimon Thorpe Double Bass\n\nGeorge Double Drums\n\n\"A vibrant and moving homage.\" - Downbeat\n\nClassical organist, violinist, singer, beloved and endearing comic performer, a star of stage and TV in the ‘60s and a Hollywood movie star from the ‘70s . . .\n\nDudley Moore was not only blessed with all these varied talents and attributes, but he was also one of the UK’s most dazzling, swinging jazz pianists, and a composer of wit and depth - something that has sadly been overlooked for far too long. This has now been redressed, thanks to long-time Dudley Moore fan, pianist Chris Ingham.\n\nThe Chris Ingham Quartet revisit the Dagenham-born musician’s fabulous 1960s Decca jazz trio albums, the groundbreaking satirical revue ‘Beyond The Fringe’, the TV show ‘Not Only, But Also’ and the brilliant movie soundtracks for ‘Bedazzled’ and ‘30 Is A Dangerous Age, Cynthia’, in an evening packed with music and anecdote, with pianist and raconteur Chris very ably setting the 1960s scene, placing Dudley's music in period context.\n\nJoining Chris on trumpet is Paul Higgs, a highly accomplished and respected trumpet player with an impressive career in many fields including performing, composing and arranging music for film, TV and theatre. Simon Thorpe is one of the UK's best-known jazz bassists who has worked with many of the great UK and US names in jazz, recording and touring with Bobby Wellins, Stacey Kent , Bheki Mseleku, Alan Barnes, Elaine Delmar, Scott Hamilton, Benn Clatworthy and Ray Gelato.

It is the story of the diversity and inclusivity of jazz from across the African continent, where you'll hear the roots of blues, jazz and almost all of today's modern musical sounds. This five-piece band will perform a range of music from Africa so you will hear Jazz fused with a mixture of Afrobeat, Township and Funk rhythms from such artists as Abdullah Ibrahim (formerly Dollar Brand), Manu Dibango and Fela Kuti.\n\nBasil Hodge has been leading bands since the mid-90s and played in various R'n'B and Gospel bands in the UK and abroad. He has performed at a range of prestigious venues such as Ronnie Scott's and the Royal Festival Hall. Tony Kofi is a British Jazz multi-instrumentalist born of Ghanaian parents, a player of the alto, baritone, soprano, tenor saxophones and flute. Having 'cut his teeth' in the “Jazz Warriors” of the early 90’s, this award-winning saxophonist has gone on to establish himself as a musician, teacher and composer of some authority. His credits now range from the brooding South African soundscapes of Abdullah Ibrahim to the ferocious aesthetics of The World Saxophone Quartet and Ornette Coleman.\n\nGuitarist Stuart Fiddler gravitated to jazz from a rock and blues background and makes judicious use of his various effects combining slippery jazz chording with the twang of rock. Mike Edwards is a highly accomplished electric and double bass player with a diverse range of musical influences. Winston Clifford is one of the most in-demand drummers on the jazz scene to date. His playing is free from the usual restraints of stylistic expectations and a true reflection of listening and responding “in the moment”.\n\nExpect breath-taking musicianship and driving rhythms as these excellent musicians also show off their fine percussion skills and some inevitable in-the-aisle dancing. This is one for families of all ages and heritages!\n\nPlease note that this gig will start at 8:15pm, doors at 7:45pm.\n\nOn Wednesday 21 February, Some Kinda Wonderful – The Music of Stevie Wonder £25\n\nNoel McCalla Vocals\n\nDerek Nash Saxophones\n\nNeil Angilley Keyboards\n\nTim Cansfield Guitar\n\nLaurence Cottle Bass\n\nNic France Drums\n\nWe are sold out for this gig, folks.\n\nCelebrating the genius of Stevie Wonder throughout his entire career, the mesmerising vocalist, Noel McCalla, and award-winning saxophonist, Derek Nash, together with a band of top musicians play a wide-ranging back-catalogue of Stevie Wonder's classic hits from 'For Once in My Life', 'Signed, Sealed, Delivered' through to hits from 'Talking Book', 'Innervisions', 'Songs in the Key of Life' and \"Hotter than July'. From dance floor classics \"I Wish' and 'Superstition' to beautiful arrangements of 'My Cherie Amour' and 'Overjoyed'.\n\nNoel McCalla’s long association with the brilliant Morrisey Mullen Band earned him acclaim as “one of Britain’s best Soul Singers” (Blues and Soul Magazine) and, for more than 19 years, Noel's searing, soulful vocals were featured with the iconic Manfred Mann's \"Earth Band\".\n\nDerek Nash has played with Jools Holland’s Rhythm and Blues Orchestra since 2004 and is also a member of the Ronnie Scotts Blues Explosion. He has won several British Jazz Awards throughout his career fronting Sax Appeal, his Acoustic Quartet and the funk band, Protect the Beat.\n\nThe all-star band features musicians whose credits include Bill Withers, The Bee Gees, Gary Moore, Michael Ball and Alfie Boe.

Trinidadian Tim Cansfield is a self taught musician; this enigmatic and self-effacing genius has played with the Bee Gees, Steve Winwood, Billy Preston, Chaka Khan, Tina Turner, Whitney Houston, Annie Lennox, Seal and many more. Jonathan Noyce has been a member of Jethro Tull, a sideman to the late great blues guitarist Gary Moore and is a member of French Superstar Mylene Farmer's band. Nic France has been one of the UK's most in-demand drummers performing with, among others, Ian Carr's 'Nucleus', Ronnie Scott, John Taylor, Jim Mullen, Bobby Wellins, Mose Allison, Billy Cobham, Django Bates and John Parricelli. He was also a founding member of 'Loose Tubes'.\n\n\"Rarely have I heard the music of Stevie Wonder interpreted with such finesse, energy and all-round brilliance.\" - The House of Soul.\n\nOn Wednesday 24 January, Cannonball and Nat – £18\n\nPete Long Alto Sax\n\nRyan Quigley Trumpet\n\nChris Ingham Piano\n\nMalcolm Creese Bass\n\nGeorge Double Drums\n\nThe leader of Ronnie Scott's Big Band, Peter Long together with Ryan Quigley front an exciting salute to a legendary team of jazz brothers; dazzling virtuoso alto saxophonist Julian “Cannonball” Adderley and ingenious soul-jazz architect and cornetist Nat Adderley.\n\nThe Cannonball Adderley Quintet featured Cannonball on alto sax and his brother Nat Adderley on cornet. Cannonball chose to play the alto despite his first love being the tenor because saxophones were in short supply in 1942 when he started playing at the age of 14. He developed a hard, explosive style, an influence from listening to Charlie Parker. Together with his brother, Nat, the famous quintet played a lot of blues-, funk- and gospel-influenced jazz based on what they heard being played by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis.\n\nPete and Ryan are lovers of the music of the quintet and are the ideal musicians to play it today. Pete studied at the Royal London College of Music and after a couple of years joined the National Youth Jazz Orchestra, playing all five saxophone parts, solo flute, bass guitar, and on one rather messy occasion, the fourth trumpet. In future years, he went on to play with the award-winning sax quartet, Itchy Fingers, working with Dizzy Gillespie, John Scofield and Chick Corea amongst others. A five-year stint playing and arranging for Jools Holland’s Rhythm and Blues Orchestra saw him work with Tom Jones, Norah Jones, Solomon Burke, Dr. John, Lulu, Georgie Fame and Lionel Richie to name but a few.
