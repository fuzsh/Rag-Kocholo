        "text": "Indianapolis native and master pianist Richard Glazier blends recitals with fascinating stories of his life, including how his career was influenced by friendships with legendary figures in American Popular Song such as Ira Gershwin. A new Glazier concert recorded in 2014, \"From Broadway to Hollywood with Richard Glazier,\" will begin airing in early June on PBS stations around the country including Indianapolis's WFYI-1 at 8 p.m. tonight and 7 p.m. June 13. The program will be part of the station's annual pledge campaign.\n\n\"It will continue to air on PBS affiliates over the next three years and I'll be appearing during the pledge drives,\" said Glazier, who now lives in Sacramento, Calif. \"I just taped some wonderful pledge segments for the Indy broadcast and talked a ton about growing up in Indy.\"\n\nIn some regions, premium pledges will receive tickets to a live concert in that market later in the year â€” including Indianapolis. (See richardglazier.com).\n\nGrowing up in Indianapolis, Glazier regularly visited Clowes Hall at Butler University listening to the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\"It's where I heard the Gershwin Concerto in F live for the first time,\" he recalled. \"I went to Brebeuf Preparatory School, then to Indiana University, and obtained a doctorate at Cleveland Institute of Music.\"\n\nBut Glazier's journey to the concert stage as a performer and historian of popular Broadway and Hollywood music goes back even further when, over 40 years ago, then 9-year-old Richard started digging though his Aunt Esther's collection of old 78 records in her Indianapolis home.\n\n\"I found an Oscar Levant recording of 'Rhapsody in Blue' and became obsessed with the music,\" recalled Glazier. \"That led me to the library where I learned about the composer, George Gershwin, and his brother Ira.\"\n\nWhen Glazier discovered the 1943 musical film \"Girl Crazy,\" which featured Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney singing Gershwin songs, he was hooked and started piano lessons.\n\nGeorge, the composer, had died in 1937, but lyricist Ira was still living. At the age of 9, Richard wrote to Ira asking for a photo, which led to a three-year correspondence with the living Gershwin brother.\n\n\"I was a small child who loved Gershwin music, so I think Ira wanted to encourage my passion for their music and my goal of being a pianist,\" said Glazier. To his astonishment, he was invited to Gershwin's California home to meet the music legend in 1975.\n\n\"I knew it was a very important moment in my life,\" said Glazier, as he recalled knocking on Gershwin's Beverly Hills front door.\n\n\"I remember thinking that Rosemary Clooney lived next door on one side, Agnes Moorehead lived on the other, Lucille Ball lived across the street, while Oscar Levant and Jimmy Stewart were down the block. It was quite a neighborhood!\" Accompanied by his mother, Glazier remembers the butler leading them into the living room where Ira sat waiting. \"He was very reclusive during his later years and hardly ever had company, but I would never have known since he was very warm and animated.\"\n\nDuring the two-hour visit, Ira showed Richard the Pulitzer Prize for drama he had won in 1932 for writing \"Of Thee I Sing.\" He talked fondly of his late brother, then invited the boy to play a piano in the room.\n\n\"It was George's piano, and it's where they wrote songs like, 'They Can't Take That Away from Me,' not to mention 'Porgy and Bess.' Ira asked me to play 'Embraceable You' from 'Girl Crazy' and he began singing the lyrics. It's a memory I will always have.\"\n\n\"He gave me a picture of George, along with one of his cancelled checks, an autographed photo of himself and an autographed score of 'Rhapsody in Blue.' My mom asked if she could take a photograph of us, and it's a treasured keepsake. In it, Ira was wearing a monogrammed gold sweater.\"\n\nThis past March, after a recent Gershwin concert and lecture Glazier did with Mike Strunsky, who represents Ira Gershwin's estate, Strunsky surprised the performer with a gift.\n\n\"I opened it in front of the crowd and inside was the gold sweater Ira wore the day we met almost 40 years ago to the day!\" said Glazier. \"That incredible gesture of kindness will stay with me the rest of my life.\"\n\nGlazier's upcoming special for public television, his third for the network, also holds special memories. He conducted interviews with several people including actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr., star of the 1960s TV crime series \"The F.B.I.\" Zimbalist's father was a well-known Russian violinist.\n\n\"Efrem and I became good friends at the end of his life,\" said Glazier. \"He agreed to an interview to talk about Bronislaw Kaper, who wrote the theme for 'The F.B.I.' which I play in the show. Efrem passed away just a few months after the interview and was the nicest, sweetest and most wonderful person. I'm grateful that he touched my life.\"\n\nGlazier experiences that same sentiment when recalling Ira Gershwin's parting words four decades ago to a 9-year-old fan, having just played at the famous lyricist's keyboard. \"He said, 'some people say that George played that piano, and Oscar Levant played that piano. Someday they'll say Richard Glazier played that piano.' Talk about encouragement!\""
