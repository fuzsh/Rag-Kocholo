A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations , the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; there are now 193 . The headquarters of the UN is in Manhattan , New York City , and experiences extraterritoriality . Further main offices are situated in Geneva , Nairobi , and Vienna . The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states . Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security , promoting human rights , fostering social and economic development , protecting the environment , and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine , natural disaster , and armed conflict . The UN is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organisation in the world . The UN Charter was drafted at a conference between April -- June 1945 in San Francisco , and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the conclusion of the conference ; this charter took effect 24 October 1945 , and the UN began operation . The UN 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies . The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo , as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947 . The organization 's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s , and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping . After the end of the Cold War , the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success . The UN has six principal organs : the General Assembly -LRB- the main deliberative assembly -RRB- ; the Security Council -LRB- for deciding certain resolutions for peace and security -RRB- ; the Economic and Social Council -LRB- ECOSOC ; for promoting international economic and social co-operation and development -RRB- ; the Secretariat -LRB- for providing studies , information , and facilities needed by the UN -RRB- ; the International Court of Justice -LRB- the primary judicial organ -RRB- ; and the UN Trusteeship Council -LRB- inactive since 1994 -RRB- . UN System agencies include the World Bank Group , the World Health Organization , the World Food Programme , UNESCO , and UNICEF . The UN 's most prominent officer is the Secretary-General , an office held by Portuguese António Guterres since 2017 . Non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN 's work . The organization won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001 , and a number of its officers and agencies have also been awarded the prize . Other evaluations of the UN 's effectiveness have been mixed . Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development , while others have called the organization ineffective , corrupt , or biased .\n\n[ \"Ukrainian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic\", \"Presidium_of_the_Supreme_Soviet_of_the_Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic\", \"Flag_of_the_Transcaucasian_Socialist_Federative_Soviet_Republic\", \"Valery_Chaptynov\", \"Tajik_Soviet_Socialist_Republic\" ]\n\n[ \"The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic -LRB- Ukrainian SSR or UkrSSR or UkSSR ; Украї́нська Радя́нська Соціалісти́чна Респу́бліка , Украї́нська РСР Украи́нская Сове́тская Социалисти́ческая Респу́блика , Украи́нская ССР see `` Name '' section below -RRB- , commonly referred to in English as Ukraine -LRB- -LSB- juːˈkreɪn -RSB- Україна , tr .

According to the International Bridge , Tunnel and Turnpike Association , the Turnpike is the nation 's sixth-busiest toll road and is one of the most heavily traveled highways in the United States . Having a total length of 122.40 mi , the Turnpike 's southern terminus begins at Interstate 295 -LRB- I-295 -RRB- near the border of Pennsville and Carneys Point Townships in Salem County , one mile east of the Delaware Memorial Bridge . Its northern terminus is located at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee , Bergen County . The Turnpike is a major thoroughfare providing access to various localities in New Jersey , as well as Delaware , Pennsylvania , and New York . The route divides into four roadways between exit 6 and exit 14 , with the inner lanes restricted to carrying only cars , and with the outer lanes for cars , trucks and buses . The northern part of the mainline turnpike , along with the entirety of its extensions and spurs , is part of the Interstate Highway System , designated as I-95 between exit 6 and its northern end . South of exit 6 , it has the unsigned Route 700 designation . There are two extensions and two spurs , including the Newark Bay Extension at exit 14 , which carries I-78 ; the Pennsylvania Turnpike Extension -LRB- officially the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension -RRB- at exit 6 ; and the Eastern Spur and the Western Spur at the turnpike 's northernmost end . Construction of the mainline from conceptualization to completion took 23 months , from 1950 to 1952 . It was officially opened to traffic in November 1951 , between its southern terminus and exit 10 . The Turnpike has 12 ft lanes , 10 ft shoulders , 13 rest areas named after notable residents of New Jersey , and unusual exit signage that was considered the pinnacle of highway building in the 1950s .

According to the International Bridge , Tunnel and Turnpike Association , the Turnpike is the nation 's sixth-busiest toll road and is one of the most heavily traveled highways in the United States . Having a total length of 122.40 mi , the Turnpike 's southern terminus begins at Interstate 295 -LRB- I-295 -RRB- near the border of Pennsville and Carneys Point Townships in Salem County , one mile east of the Delaware Memorial Bridge . Its northern terminus is located at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee , Bergen County . The Turnpike is a major thoroughfare providing access to various localities in New Jersey , as well as Delaware , Pennsylvania , and New York . The route divides into four roadways between exit 6 and exit 14 , with the inner lanes restricted to carrying only cars , and with the outer lanes for cars , trucks and buses . The northern part of the mainline turnpike , along with the entirety of its extensions and spurs , is part of the Interstate Highway System , designated as I-95 between exit 6 and its northern end . South of exit 6 , it has the unsigned Route 700 designation . There are two extensions and two spurs , including the Newark Bay Extension at exit 14 , which carries I-78 ; the Pennsylvania Turnpike Extension -LRB- officially the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension -RRB- at exit 6 ; and the Eastern Spur and the Western Spur at the turnpike 's northernmost end . Construction of the mainline from conceptualization to completion took 23 months , from 1950 to 1952 . It was officially opened to traffic in November 1951 , between its southern terminus and exit 10 . The Turnpike has 12 ft lanes , 10 ft shoulders , 13 rest areas named after notable residents of New Jersey , and unusual exit signage that was considered the pinnacle of highway building in the 1950s . The Interstate Highway System took some of its design guidelines by copying the Turnpike 's design guidelines . To some degree , the Turnpike is considered iconic in pop culture , having been referenced in music , film and television . \", \"This is a list of turnpike roads , built and operated by private companies in exchange for the privilege of collecting a toll , in the U.S. state of New Jersey , mainly in the 19th century .

The periodic table provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behaviour , and is widely used in chemistry and other sciences .

Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table . Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered . Mendeleev 's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviour . All elements from atomic numbers 1 -LRB- hydrogen -RRB- to 118 -LRB- oganesson -RRB- have been discovered or synthesized , with the most recent additions -LRB- nihonium , moscovium , tennessine , and oganesson -RRB- being confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry -LRB- IUPAC -RRB- on December 30 , 2015 and officially named on November 28 , 2016 : they complete the first seven rows of the periodic table . The first 94 elements exist naturally , although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in laboratories before being found in nature . Elements with atomic numbers from 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors . Synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is being pursued . Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories . \", \"In vector calculus , a vector potential is a vector field whose curl is a given vector field . This is analogous to a scalar potential , which is a scalar field whose gradient is a given vector field . Formally , given a vector field v , a vector potential is a vector A such that \", \"In topology , a coherent topology is a topology that is uniquely determined by a family of subspaces . Loosely speaking , a topological space is coherent with a family of subspaces if it is a topological union of those subspaces . It is also sometimes called the weak topology generated by the family of subspaces , a notion which is quite different from the notion of a weak topology generated by a set of maps . \", \"Hathigadh is a village in Liliya tehsil , Amreli district , Gujarat , India . It has a High school and a Primary school . There is no river in the village , but a reservoir is under construction . There is a temple , Ramji Mandir .

Hezbollah 's paramilitary wing is the Jihad Council , and its political wing is Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc party in the Lebanese parliament . After the death of Abbas al-Musawi in 1992 , the group has been headed by Hassan Nasrallah , its Secretary-General . After the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 in support of the Free Lebanon State , Israel occupied a strip of south Lebanon , which was controlled by the South Lebanon Army -LRB- SLA -RRB- , a Lebanese Christian militia supported by Israel . Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation . Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini , and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran with permission from the Syrian government , which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time . Hezbollah 's 1985 manifesto listed its objectives as the expulsion of `` the Americans , the French and their allies definitely from Lebanon , putting an end to any colonialist entity on our land '' , submission of the Phalangists to `` just power '' and bringing them to justice `` for the crimes they have perpetrated against Muslims and Christians '' , and permitting `` all the sons of our people '' to choose the form of government they want , while calling on them to `` pick the option of Islamic government '' . Hezbollah waged a guerilla campaign in South Lebanon and as a result , Israel withdrew from Lebanon on May 24 , 2000 , and SLA collapsed and surrendered . Backed by Iran , Hezbollah fighters fought against Serbian forces during the Bosnian War . Hezbollah 's military strength has grown so significantly that its paramilitary wing is considered more powerful than the Lebanese Army . Hezbollah has been described as a `` state within a state '' , and has grown into an organization with seats in the Lebanese government , a radio and a satellite TV station , social services and large-scale military deployment of fighters beyond Lebanon 's borders . Hezbollah is part of the March 8 Alliance within Lebanon , in opposition to the March 14 Alliance . Hezbollah maintains strong support among Lebanon 's Shi'a population , while Sunnis have disagreed with the group 's agenda . Hezbollah receives military training , weapons , and financial support from Iran , and political support from Syria . Hezbollah and Israel fought each other in the 2006 Lebanon War . After the 2006 -- 08 Lebanese protests and clashes , a national unity government was formed in 2008 , with Hezbollah and its opposition allies obtaining eleven of thirty cabinets seats , which gives them veto power . In August 2008 , Lebanon 's new Cabinet unanimously approved a draft policy statement which recognized Hezbollah 's existence as an armed organization and guarantees its right to `` liberate or recover occupied lands '' -LRB- such as the Shebaa Farms -RRB- . Since 2012 , Hezbollah has helped the Syrian government during the Syrian civil war in its fight against the Syrian opposition , which Hezbollah has described as a Zionist plot and a `` Wahhabi-Zionist conspiracy '' to destroy its alliance with Assad against Israel . It has deployed its militia in both Syria and Iraq to fight or train local forces to fight against ISIS . Once seen as a resistance movement throughout much of the Arab world , this image upon which the group 's legitimacy rested has been severely damaged due to the sectarian nature of the Syrian Civil War in which it has become embroiled . Hezbollah 's status as a legitimate political party , a terrorist group , a resistance movement , or some combination thereof is a contentious issue . The Arab League , United States , France , the Gulf Cooperation Council , Australia , Canada , the Netherlands , and Israel have classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organization . The European Union , New Zealand and the United Kingdom have proscribed Hezbollah 's military wing as a terrorist organization , while making a distinction with Hezbollah 's political wing . Russia considers Hezbollah a legitimate sociopolitical organization . The People 's Republic of China remains neutral , and maintains contacts with Hezbollah .\n\n[ \"Hezbollah\", \"Mahabad_-LRB-disambiguation-RRB-\", \"German_submarine_U-1302\", \"Basic_Military_Officer_Qualification\", \"Charles_Bigelow_-LRB-type_designer-RRB-\" ]\n\n[ \"Hezbollah -LRB- pronounced -LSB- ˌhɛzbəˈlɑː -RSB- حزب الله , literally `` Party of Allah '' or `` Party of God '' -RRB- -- also transliterated Hizbullah , Hizballah , etc. -- is a Shi'a Islamist militant group and political party based in Lebanon .
