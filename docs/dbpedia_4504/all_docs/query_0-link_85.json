        "text": "The official name has been the School of Theology at Claremont since the seminary moved to that city nearly 40 year ago. But many people often called it the Claremont School of Theology.\n\nSo be it. Administrators and board members of the 350-student seminary announced this week that they have formally changed the name to Claremont School of Theology.\n\n“There are lots of schools of theology and there is only one Claremont,” said President Robert Edgar.\n\nIn the past, putting the words School of Theology first was intended to distinguish the seminary from the Claremont Colleges, the well-respected group of private, liberal arts colleges in the town.\n\nBut Edgar said the seminary now has a true connection to one school in the cluster, the Claremont Graduate School. “We didn’t have anything in writing before, but we now have clearly defined partnership with the Claremont Graduate School,” Edgar said.\n\n“Fifteen of our seminary faculty teach at least one class at Claremont Graduate School and at least one at the School of Theology,” he said.\n\nA graduate school of the United Methodist Church, the Claremont School of Theology began as the Maclay College of Theology in 1895 before moving to the USC campus, where it was named the School of Religion. The school relocated to Claremont in 1957, using Claremont Colleges space before moving onto its Foothill Boulevard campus in 1960.\n\nLike Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, the Claremont School of Theology competes for students from a variety of denominational backgrounds.\n\nOne benefit of the name change, Edgar quipped, is that on lists of seminaries, “we have moved up in alphabetical order--ahead of Fuller.”\n\nMEDIA\n\n*\n\nThe third annual City of Angels Film Festival, opening under the banner of “the search for meaning in films,” will begin Thursday night in Glendale with the 50th anniversary showing of “It’s a Wonderful Life.”\n\nThe 1946 film directed by Frank Capra will be shown at 7 p.m. at the Alex Theatre, 215 N. Brand Blvd., with Frank Capra Jr. and several members of the cast expected to attend. The festival will continue with screenings, often followed by panel discussions, for the next three days at the Directors Guild of America building, 7920 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles.\n\nFilms include “The Player,” “Gates of Heaven,” “Apocalypse Now,” “Pinocchio” and “The Seventh Seal.” Also showing will be three student films chosen for the first Angelus Awards of Family Theater Productions, a co-sponsor of the film festival with Fuller Theological Seminary and Catholics in Media Associates. Admission price is $7.50 per showing. (818) 304-3775.\n\n* Actor Gregory Peck, last year’s winner of the Catholics in Media Associates lifetime achievement award, will introduce this year’s recipient, actor Carroll O’Connor, during the organization’s annual awards brunch Oct. 27 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. O’Connor played Archie Bunker in the “All in the Family” sitcom and starred as a Southern sheriff in “Heat of the Night,” which ran seven seasons. Tickets: $45. (818) 907-2734.\n\nDATES\n\n*\n\nA symposium reflecting the social-spiritual work of Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar, the late founder of the Ananda Marga movement, will be held Oct. 19 at UCLA’s Ackerman Union around the theme of “bringing our collective spirit into the next millennium.” Speakers will include Robert Bly, whose book “Iron John” sparked a mens’ self-esteem movement; Ravi Batra of Southern Methodist University, author of “The Great Depression of 1990;” and Didi Ananda Mitra, an author and yoga teacher. The daylong symposium costs $85. Tickets: (310) 825-2101.\n\n* Sixteen-year-old pianist Andrew von Oeyen of Malibu, who recently won top prize in the Los Angeles Philharmonic’s Bronislaw Kaper Piano Competition, will join the Chamber Orchestra of St. Matthew’s Episcopal Church, 1031 Bienveneda Ave., Pacific Palisades, in an all-Beethoven concert at 7:30 p.m. Friday. The program launching the church’s 13th annual concert season will feature the pianist in Beethoven’s Third Concerto. Admission is $18. (310) 573-7787.\n\n* Jim Wallis, editor of Sojourners magazine in Washington, will speak Tuesday at 3:30 p.m. in USC’s United University Church, inaugurating the first Father Lawrence Jenco lectureship series honoring the late priest who was held hostage by terrorists in Lebanon in the mid-1980s. Admission is free. (213) 740-2667.\n\n* Joseph Webb, a former journalism teacher, religious radio producer and pastor, will speak on “Preaching and the Theology of Comedy” at 4:15 p.m. Tuesday in Mudd Theater at the Claremont School of Theology, where he is an associate professor of homiletics. The lecture is free.\n\n* The Rev. Maake J.

Several other Protestant denominations have recently begun ministries among Vietnamese immigrants and hope to start churches in their Southeast Asian homeland.\n\nWith the improvement of relations between the United States and Vietnam and the latter government’s recent permission to publish Bibles and hymnals, the Vietnamese World Christian Fellowship, sponsors of the conference, said a common strategy is needed for evangelizing in Vietnam. “Religious and missionary activities in Vietnam are still restricted by the government,” said a fellowship spokesman.\n\nSpeakers at the meeting will include LeRoy Lawson, president of Pacific Christian College, Fullerton, and Isaac Canales of Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena.\n\nThe national conference also will address Vietnamese Christian concerns over new welfare and immigration laws that “reduce or eliminate many benefits which have been available to the disabled, elderly and mentally ill in the Indochinese community,” a spokesman said.\n\nNotices may be mailed to Southern California File, c/o John Dart, L.A.
