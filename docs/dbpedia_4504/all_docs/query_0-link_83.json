        "text": "Robert Evans was originally cast in the role of Italian-American policeman \"Johnny Viscardi\" in the 1960 film about the \"Black Hand\" PAY OR DIE!. But he abruptly left the cast and was replaced by Alan Austin. Dissatisfied with his own acting talent, he was determined to become a producer. He got his start as head of production at Paramount by purchasing the rights to a 1966 novel titled THE DETECTIVE, which Evans made into a movie for 20th Century Fox in 1968, starring Frank Sinatra, Lee Remick, Jack Klugman, Robert Duvall and Jacqueline Bisset. Peter Bart, a writer for The New York Times, wrote an article about Evans' aggressive production style. This got Evans noticed by Charles Bluhdorn, who was head of the Gulf+Western conglomerate, and hired Evans as part of a shakeup at Paramount Pictures (which included Bart, whom Evans would recruit as a Paramount executive).\n\nWhen Evans took over as head of production for Paramount, the floundering studio was the ninth largest. Despite his inexperience, Evans was able to turn the studio around. He made Paramount the most successful studio in Hollywood and transformed it into a very profitable enterprise for Gulf+Western. During his tenure at Paramount, the studio turned out films such as BAREFOOT IN THE PARK, THE ODD COUPLE, ROSEMARY'S BABY, THE ITALIAN JOB, TRUE GRIT, LOVE STORY, AND HAROLD AND MAUDE.\n\nDissatisfied with his financial compensation and desiring to produce films under his own banner, Evans struck a deal with Paramount that enabled him to stay on as studio head while also working as an independent producer. Evans' first film as a credited Executive Producer was 1972' s THE GODFATHER.\n\nAccording to Evans, Mario Puzo initially brought a twenty-page treatment of the novel to him that was entitled Mafia. Evans told the story that Puzo owed the mob $10,000 or so. Evans basically optioned the novel for the amount of money that Puzo owed the mob.\n\nIn January 1969, Paramount secured the rights to the novel, which by that time was listed as number one on the New York Times bestseller list. Various 1969 news items added that Paramount had purchased the book for a \"bargain price\" that would be spread out, based on the number of copies sold, to a maximum of $80,000. Decades later, in a July 2002 interview for a special Paramount anniversary issue of the Hollywood Reporter, Evans recollected that Burt Lancaster had wanted Evans to sell him the rights to Puzo’s novel for $1,000,000, but Evans turned him down.\n\nMafia crime boss Joe Colombo and his organization, The Italian-American Civil Rights League, started a campaign to stop the film from being made. According to Robert Evans in his autobiography, Colombo called his house and threatened him and his family. Paramount Pictures received many letters during pre-production from Italian-Americans, including politicians, decrying the film as anti-Italian. They threatened to protest and disrupt filming. Producer Al Ruddy met with Colombo, who demanded that the terms \"Mafia\" and \"Cosa Nostra\" not be used in the film. Ruddy gave them the right to review the script and make changes. He also agreed to hire League members (mobsters) as extras and advisers. The angry letters ceased after this agreement was made.\n\nParamount Pictures owner Charlie Bluhdorn read about the agreement in The New York Times, and was so outraged, that he fired Ruddy and shut down production, but Evans convinced Bluhdorn that the agreement was beneficial for the film, and Ruddy was rehired.\n\nSeveral contemporary sources, including a Time article, reported numerous names of prominent actors who had been considered for principal roles in the film. Marlon Brando was the first publicly announced cast member, approximately two months before the start of principal photography. A Daily Variety news item chided Robert Evans for his statement in September 1970 that the film would be cast with \"real faces\" and not \"Hollywood Italians.\" Although most contemporary and modern sources agree that Brando had always been the favored choice for \"Don Vito,\" various other names mentioned for the title role in Time and other contemporary articles included Laurence Olivier, George C. Scott and Ernest Borgnine.\n\nRobert Evans claimed that Brando was paid $50,000, plus points, and sold back his points to Paramount before the release of the picture for an additional $100,000 because he had female-related money troubles. Realizing the film was going to be a huge hit, Paramount was happy to oblige. This financial fleecing of Brando, according to Evans, is the reason he refused to do publicity for the picture, or appear in the sequel.\n\nMartin Sheen and Dean Stockwell auditioned for the role of \"Michael Corleone.\" Oscar-winner Rod Steiger campaigned hard for the role of Michael, even though he was too old for the part. Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, and Dustin Hoffman were all offered the part of Michael Corleone, but all refused. Suggestions of Alain Delon and Burt Reynolds were rejected by Francis Ford Coppola. Robert Evans wanted Robert Redford to be cast in the part, but Coppola demurred, as he was too WASP-y. Evans explained that Redford could fit the role, as he could be perceived as \"northern Italian\".\n\nWith Redford off the table, Evans insisted that James Caan be cast as Michael. At that point, Carmine Caridi was cast in the role of \"Sonny.\" The Paramount brass, particularly Evans, were adamantly opposed to casting Coppola-favorite Al Pacino, who did poorly in screen tests, until they saw his excellent performance in THE PANIC IN NEEDLE PARK(1971).\n\nEvans eventually lost the struggle over the actor he derided as \"The Midget\". Evans told Coppola that he could cast Al Pacino as Michael as long as he cast Caan as Sonny. Although Caan had been Coppola's first choice for Sonny, he later decided that Caridi was better for the role, and did not want to re-cast Caan. But Evans insisted on Caan because he wanted at least one \"name\" actor to play one of the brothers, and because the 6'4\" Caridi would tower over Pacino on-screen.\n\nBefore Francis Ford Coppola was hired, Peter Yates, Richard Brooks, Peter Bogdanovich, and Costa-Gavras were approached by Robert Evans and Paramount to direct THE GODFATHER. All turned it down. Evans apparently screened the films about gangsters that Paramount Pictures had released before he arrived at the studio, including THE BROTHERHOOD (1968). He noticed that most of the films were unsuccessful, and also that they had not been written nor directed by Italian-Americans, and said that he hired Coppola in part, because he wanted to \"smell the spaghetti\".\n\nParamount Pictures chairman Barry Diller brokered a deal between his company and Walt Disney Productions to co-finance and co-distribute the picture, and also DRAGONSLAYER (1981). Paramount agreed to handle domestic distribution, while it was felt that Disney, with its greater overseas potential, would be responsible for the international market. It was the first time that Disney partnered to distribute a film, while Paramount had entered into a joint distribution deal once before with Universal Pictures to release SORCERER (1977).\n\nRobert Altman and production designer Wolf Kroeger scouted U. S. locations including Catalina Island, CA, Florida, and Hawaii, before settling on Anchor Bay, Malta. The area, with its distinctive “horseshoe-shaped cove,” afforded filmmakers much privacy on the thinly populated northwest section of the island. During the summer of 1979, the crew built a two hundred-foot ferryboat to use as a breakwater in the bay, access roads and a model built to scale. Construction on the village began in September 1979 with 165 crew members including draftsmen, scenic painters, carpenters, electricians, plasterers, welders, and sculptors. Hand-split cedar shingles were imported from British Columbia, and lumber was shipped from Austrian forests.\n\nCrew members built an underwater tank, barges, and a seaport to represent the fictitious town of Sweethaven, which consisted of churches, houses, restaurants, and bars along a stretch of almost three blocks in a cove twenty miles from the Maltese capital of Valletta. Nineteen structures made up the village including the four-bedroom Oyl house, the Rough House Café and its short-order kitchen, and a working sawmill. In addition, the upper cabin of the ferryboat became the town’s gambling casino, and a half-submerged frigate in the bay was used as the Commodore’s headquarters.\n\nAn all-around danceable, swimmable, walking and running shoe was designed and constructed for cast members by a London manufacturer of theatrical footwear named Anello and Davide. Shoes were made of leather and rubber, and padded with cork to suggest exaggerated toes and bulging heels. Each shoe was about twice the length of an actor’s regular shoe size, and the company prepared eighteen pairs for the production, while the bulk of the footwear was manufactured in the plaster shop on the set.\n\nA moderate success, POPEYE made $61 million worldwide during its release. Nevertheless, Paramount filed a lawsuit after director Altman went over budget on the film, alleging that Altman had agreed to repay ten-nineteenths of any amount that exceeded the budget, excluding interest, up to $250 thousand. The movie cost more than $22.7 million. Paramount asked for $250 thousand in damages from Altman, whose salary on the film was $600 thousand. Altman refused to honor the agreement, according to the suit. The outcome of the dispute has not been determined.\n\nEveryone tried to dissuade Robert Altman from working with composer/songwriter Harry Nilsson, saying that he would be constantly drunk. Only Robin Williams supported Altman in this decision. As it turned out, Altman found Nilsson to be delightful to work with. Nilsson’s score and songs, with some additional music by Tom Pierson, were released on a Boardwalk LP. An expanded edition was issued on CD by Varese Sarabande in 2017.\n\nThe outdoor Sweethaven set was saved from destruction by lifelong Maltese resident, Lino Cassar, a dedicated film buff and coordinator for area filming. Cassar battled Maltese officials to preserve the village, and eventually brought his case before the country’s prime minister. As a result, the site remains a popular tourist destination, where visitors can walk through nineteen buildings including a restaurant with menu items like spinach soup and Wimpy hamburgers.\n\nDuring the production of POPEYE, Robert Evans was arrested for trying to buy cocaine. He entered a guilty plea to a misdemeanor in Federal court after being arrested after engineering a large cocaine buy with his brother Charles. As part of his plea bargain, he filmed an anti-drug TV commercial. The alleged drug dealing, which Evans subsequently denied (the misdemeanor was later wiped from his record), came out of his own involvement with the drug. He told the Philadelphia Inquirer in a 1994 interview, \"Bob 'Cocaine' Evans is how I'll be known to my grave\". He argued that he never should have been convicted of Federal selling and distribution charges, as he was only a user.\n\nTHE COTTON CLUB interweaves two narratives, following the lives of Harlem musician “Dixie Dwyer,” a white coronet player of Irish descent, and “Sandman Williams,” an African-American tap dancer. While Dixie and Sandman’s stories are generally depicted separately, events often overlap, particularly at the Cotton Club. Musical numbers are intercut with the film’s action, blurring the distinction between performance and “real” occurrences in the movie. The picture also includes fictional representations of historical figures, such as actress Gloria Swanson (Diane Venora) and gangsters Charles “Lucky” Luciano (Joe Dallesandro), Dutch Schultz (James Remar), and Owney Madden (Bob Hoskins).\n\nIn December 1980, producer Robert Evans acquired film rights to James Haskins’s book The Cotton Club: A Pictorial and Social History of the Most Famous Symbol of the Jazz Era. At that time, Evans was known for his success as head of production at Paramount Pictures, where he pulled the studio out of financial decline with blockbusters including Francis Ford Coppola’s THE GODFATHER (1972) and Roman Polanski’s CHINATOWN (1974). After CHINATOWN, Evans negotiated a deal with Paramount in which he maintained his executive title while also developing side projects and financing them as an independent producer.\n\nEvans was first introduced to Haskins’s book in 1977, when literary agent George Weiser brought the story to his attention with plans to make a Broadway musical. Seeing the picture as an updated GONE WITH THE WIND, which could integrate African-American actors into Hollywood filmmaking and explore the history of race relations in the U.S., Evans believed THE COTTON CLUB project was vital to promoting cultural diversity and spent $475,000 of his own money to acquire screen rights. Although Evans secured private financing for the picture as of 12 December 1980, Paramount was given the option to take over as producer, but the studio was awaiting returns from their recent Evans investment, POPEYE, which was set to open that day. In the meantime, POPEYE director Robert Altman was hired to direct THE COTTON CLUB.\n\nFive months later, in April 1981, Evans announced plans to break ties with Paramount and produce the film on his own, with an $18 million budget supplied by an unnamed Swiss investment group. Working independently, Evans hoped to retain ownership of the picture’s negative, which would give him control over its copyright, rentals, and television rights, but his plan did not appeal to investors, who wished to share in the profits. With the modest box-office results of POPEYE, as well as legal troubles resulting from a cocaine trafficking arrest, and the loss of millions of dollars in poor stock-market investments, Evans believed THE COTTON CLUB was his best opportunity to resurrect his career.\n\nIn an attempt to replicate the success of THE GODFATHER, Evans hired writer Mario Puzo to adapt Haskins’s book. The deal was announced in a 17 September 1981 New York Times article, which noted that production was delayed because Evans spent the past year working on an anti-drug television campaign to expunge his criminal record. During that time, THE COTTON CLUB budget increased to approximately $20 million, and Robert Altman left the project. When Evans hired Puzo for $1 million, he was desperate to find greater sources of financing, and actress Melissa Prophet, who had a role in Evans’s 1979 film PLAYERS, introduced him to Saudi Arabian billionaire arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. Evans was negotiating a distribution deal with Paramount at that time, and Khashoggi agreed to supply an initial $2.5 million if the studio matched his investment as a co-financier. When Paramount complied, Khashoggi increased his commitment to $12 million and Paramount balked at the unexpected budget hike. The deal never came to fruition and Evans returned Khashoggi’s $2.5 million.\n\nWhen Paramount dropped out, Evans sought the services of Orion Pictures, which was in the business of marketing and distributing films rather than producing them, meaning that Evans would need to raise more production money and find a studio in which to shoot the film, causing further delays and adding to the already bloated budget.\n\nOn 4 March 1982, the Hollywood Reporter announced that GODFATHER star Al Pacino was cast in the role of “Dixie Dwyer,” but he was replaced by Sylvester Stallone two months later, when it was also reported that Evans had taken over as director. The film would have marked Evans’s directorial debut. Stallone was guaranteed a $2 million salary as well as a 25% cut of any money the production saved if it was completed under budget. Several days after settling Stallone’s contract, Evans went to the 1981 Cannes Film Festival, hoping to secure financing from foreign theater chains, and obtained $8 million in guarantees from the Producers Sales Organization (PSO). However, the deal stipulated that Evans could not have access to the money until the film was completed, or was subsidized by a completion bond.\n\nWithout evidence of immediate financial backing, Evans was unable to gain investor confidence and sought funding from brothers Ed and Fred Doumani, who were leading property and casino owners in Las Vegas. Although the men were facing a corruption review by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, they agreed to finance THE COTTON CLUB with a partner, businessman Victor L. Sayyah, in return for 50% ownership of the film. Evans supplied collateral by mortgaging his Beverly Hills mansion, liquidating his savings, and selling his stock in Paramount parent company, Gulf + Western. Neither the Doumanis nor Sayyah are credited onscreen.\n\nIn addition, millionaire entertainment promoter Roy Radin was brought in as an investor by Evans’s then-girlfriend, Karen Greenberger (a.k.a. Elaine “Lanie” Jacobs), a cocaine dealer with ties to the Latin American drug trade. The deal mandated that Evans and Radin establish a production company in which each would own 45% of the film with the remaining 10% split between two other parties. Radin offered Greenberger a $50,000 finder's fee for her efforts, which she found unsatisfactory. However, the deal ended when the 33-year-old Radin was murdered during pre-production.\n\nBy June 1982, Harrison Ford was cast to replace Sylvester Stallone, but in September 1982 it was reported that Evans was ready to start production in February 1983 with Richard Gere in the leading role. Catherine Denueve was under consideration to play “Vero Cicero,” and the filmmaker was in the process of casting 150 black actors. Although Richard Pryor was Evans’ first choice for “Sandman Williams,” the budget could not accommodate his salary demands. Gregory Hines was ultimately cast. Diane Lane was then cast as Vero Cicero.\n\nWith financing secured, Evans hired Francis Ford Coppola to rewrite Puzo’s screenplay, which had already gone through approximately sixty drafts. Evans and Coppola were notorious adversaries from their work on THE GODFATHER, but Evans believed the filmmaker had a better chance at making the project a success, and soon asked Coppola to direct. Coppola was motivated to take over THE COTTON CLUB because he was at a standstill in his career after the commercial failure of ONE FROM THE HEART (1982), which forced his company, Zoetrope Studios, into bankruptcy. Coppola agreed with Evans that THE COTTON CLUB would be a blockbuster, and its success could resurrect their credibility.\n\nCoppola’s script was nearly finished by early August 1983 and principal photography was scheduled to begin in New York City on 22 August 1983. Although Coppola promised the screenplay would be ready in time for production, Evans hired Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist William Kennedy to guarantee a completed script. Kennedy spent eight days writing a “rehearsal script” that was used by the cast in the three weeks leading up to the start of production. After filming began at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, NY, Kennedy and Coppola created twelve additional drafts, and the actors were encouraged to submit notes, leaving the shooting script a work-in-progress.\n\nAlong with spontaneous changes in the narrative, upon being appointed director, Coppola added to the budgetary woes by firing en masse the film crew Evans had assembled (in some cases requiring large payoffs). Other firings included unit production manager David Golden, executive producer Dyson Lovell, music consultant Jerry Wexler, and arranger Ralph Burns. Coppola hired his own crew members, including a music arranger who commuted via Concorde between the shoot in New York and a regular engagement in Switzerland.\n\nIn addition, Coppola walked off set the week of 3 October 1983, causing filming to stop for several days. According to one report, Coppola objected to his contract, which stipulated that he be paid $3 million upfront with an additional $1 million if the film was finished on time and within its $18-$20 million budget. Evans retained the option to deduct Coppola’s wages if the film’s cost exceeded $20 million. Seven weeks into production, the budget already reached $28 million, and Coppola refused to continue until he was guaranteed more money upfront. But another report claimed that Coppola was not paid in full because he did not finish the script. At one point relations were so strained between Coppola and Evans that Coppola had Evans banned from the set. Evans agreed to Coppola’s terms so filming could resume. Although principal photography was completed in 1983, the first-unit crew and cast returned to New York City in mid-March 1984 for additional location shooting.\n\nProduction designer Richard Sylbert claimed that he told Robert Evans not to hire Coppola because \"he resents being in the commercial, narrative, Hollywood movie business\". Coppola claimed that he had letters from Sylbert that asked him to work on the film because Evans was crazy. The director also said that \"Evans set the tone for the level of extravagance long before I got there\".\n\nThe film’s soaring budget resulted in several lawsuits and conflicts between Evans, Coppola, and their investors. When the cost exceeded $20 million, the Doumani brothers convinced distributor Orion Pictures to advance the production an additional $15 million, on condition that Evans step down as producer. Although Evans objected to being replaced by Ed Doumani, he agreed to the deal because he believed investor Victor L. Sayyah was supportive of the pact. In addition, the Doumanis hired a noted gangster, Joseph Cusumano, to intimidate Evans into giving up his share of the partnership. Cusumano is credited onscreen as line producer. When Evans discovered that Sayyah was not behind the Doumani arrangement, he filed a restraining order against Ed Doumani to prevent him from taking over the picture.\n\nOn 10 June 1984, Sayyah filed a lawsuit against the Doumani brothers, their attorney, David Hurwitz, Orion Pictures, Robert Evans, and PSO, alleging fraud, conspiracy, and breach of contract. Sayyah claimed it would be impossible for him to recoup his $5 million investment because the film’s budget escalated from $20 to $58 million during production, making it unlikely that the picture would make a profit. Sayyah also contended that Orion’s $15 million loan was unnecessary, and may have been orchestrated to increase the budget so he would be edged out of a return on his investment. Complaints were also made against the Doumanis, who allegedly pushed Evans into a state of vexation on purpose, so he would lose control of the project. The Canadian Globe and Mail estimated the budget could have been as high as $67 million, but the filmmakers were not able to confirm an exact figure.\n\nTen days after Sayyah filed his lawsuit, a court ruling restored Evans’s authority. However, line producer Barrie M. Osborne was granted full control over post-production. Osborne was a close confidante of Coppola, and the ruling was a greater victory for Coppola than for Evans, who was effectively denied participation in the final cut. Evans received a flat fee and producer credit, but was stripped of creative control. The court also forbade the warring parties to file additional lawsuits about the film without approval from the judge.\n\nDespite generally positive reviews, the picture did not fare well at the box-office, grossing $2.9 million its opening weekend on 808 screens. Orion experienced unusually high levels of trading on Wall Street after the film’s release. The transactions reflected a common anxiety that the studio would suffer financially from THE COTTON CLUB. Orion tried to reassure traders with a press statement, claiming its investment in the movie was “fixed and limited.” The film’s ultimate box office take was an anemic $26 million. John Barry’s score claimed only two tracks on the song CD released by Geffen Records.\n\nLos Angeles County sheriff’s investigators had all but given up their investigation of Roy Radin’s murder, but a break came in 1987 when they met William Rider, the brother-in-law and onetime security chief for Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler magazine. Rider told them that William Mentzer and Alex Marti had admitted during a poker game that they killed Radin. Mentzer, Marti and Robert Lowe were bodyguards for Flynt at the time they met Karen Greenberger.\n\nThe arrests of the four came after a secret taping by Rider of a conversation in which Lowe said the Radin killing had been paid for by Greenberger and film producer Robert Evans, and was contracted for because Greenberger feared she was being cut out of a producer’s role – and profits – in the movie. The ensuing trial for the murder of Roy Radin became known as “The Cotton Club Trial.”\n\nAlthough Evans was not charged in the case, on the advice of his attorney Robert Shapiro, Evans refused to testify during a May 1989 preliminary hearing, invoking the Fifth Amendment to avoid incriminating himself. Contract killers William Mentzer and Alex Marti were convicted of first degree murder, for shooting Radin multiple times in the head and using dynamite to make identification by authorities more challenging. Karen Greenberger testified during her 1991 trial that Evans was not involved in the murder. She also claimed during her trial that she had been Evans' lover. Greenberger and Lowe were convicted of second-degree murder and kidnapping and received life sentences.\n\nFor many years after CHINATOWN, there were attempts by Jack Nicholson, Robert Towne and Robert Evans to follow-up the story with a sequel. The sequel, THE TWO JAKES, would pick up the story of “Jake Gittes” in 1948. Evans, who produced CHINATOWN, was slated to continue as producer for the sequel and had negotiated for Jack Nicholson to return to the role of Jake Gittes and for Dustin Hoffman to play “Jake Berman,” with the intention of beginning production in 1977. CHINATOWN director Roman Polanski was unable to work in the United States after taking up residence in France to avoid a California jail sentence that would have resulted from his guilty plea to a charge of having unlawful sex with a minor in February 1978, and screenwriter Robert Towne replaced him as director of the sequel.\n\nBy 1985, the film project had still not moved forward, and Evans, who began his film career as an actor, was contracted to play the role of Berman, as the part was written for him by Towne, a longtime friend and colleague. Towne, Evans and Nicholson jump-started the project by forming the independent production companies T.E.N. Productions, based on an acronym of their names Towne-Evans-Nicholson, and Two Jakes Productions, to collectively profit from the venture.\n\nIn return for the trio sacrificing their salaries, Paramount agreed to a budget of $12 to $13 million and a cap of $6 million on its standard thirty percent distribution fee, which would have enabled Towne, Evans and Nicholson to share profits after Paramount recouped production costs and the distribution cap was met. Due to this arrangement, THE TWO JAKES was technically an independent production. Paramount consented to fund the entire project because they were entitled to independent production incentives, as they would in a negative pick-up deal, which allowed them to pay for the production after shooting and save up to 15% in overhead costs.\n\nEvans announced his intent to play Berman as part of the deal, and various contemporary sources, including Los Angeles Magazine, speculated that this reflected an attempt to redeem his reputation after much publicized controversies surrounding THE COTTON CLUB, including the murder of one of that film’s financers, Roy Radin, and Evans’s rumored problems with cocaine addiction. Kelly McGillis, Cathy Moriarty, Dennis Hooper and Harvey Keitel were also cast (although only Keitel appeared in the final film), sets were under construction and props, such as classic cars, were purchased and prepared for production to begin.\n\nRobert Evans underwent major plastic surgery before the film began, reportedly bringing pictures of cats with him to get the look he wanted. Nicholson and Towne were horrified when they saw the results, because Evans had become unrecognizable. After shooting several test scenes in April 1985, Towne and Paramount were also dissatisfied with Evans’ performance and, after difficult deliberations, Evans was fired four days before production was scheduled to begin.\n\nOn top of existing problems in pre-production, including grievances filed by 120 crew members who had not been paid, over $500,000 in back salary claims from Screen Actor Guild (SAG) and Directors Guild of America (DGA) members, and $1.5 million of debt to suppliers of sets, props, costumes and sound stages who were also filing lawsuits, Nicholson refused to continue if Evans was dismissed, and the project was postponed indefinitely. Paramount, whose loss on the film totaled $4 million, claimed it had no legal obligation to crew members but paid over $200,000 to the California Division of Labor and Standards to settle their claims. In May 1985, a million dollars of sets, including Gittes’ office and the Morning Glory Bar and Grill, were dismantled and disposed of in their final stages of construction.\n\nDespite cessation of production, various efforts were made to keep the project alive. Although Paramount owned the sequel rights to CHINATOWN, other major studios, including 20th Century Fox and MGM/UA, were reportedly vying to buy the project. In May 1986, The Cannon Group initiated negotiations to acquire the film, however, Evans was uncooperative about selling his stake in the project and losing his credit as producer. Although The Cannon Group was willing to give Evans credit as line-producer, Evans refused to accept this role and would not agree to the deal unless he had “full control.”\n\nMeanwhile Nicholson’s career prospered with critically acclaimed roles in PRIZZI’S HONOR (1985) and HEARTBURN (1986). Nicholson’s involvement in HEARTBURN was elemental to the resurrection of THE TWO JAKES. Production on HEARTBURN was suspended when actor Mandy Patinkin was let go. Nicholson consented to a request from Paramount head Frank Mancuso, Sr. to step into the lead role with only three days’ notice. Mancuso was indebted to Nicholson, and wanted Paramount to maintain control over THE TWO JAKES, so negotiations between Nicholson and Mancuso in September 1988 resulted in reviving the project with Nicholson as director. In addition to Nicholson starring as “Jake Gittes,” actors Joe Mantell, Perry Lopez, and James Hong reprised their roles from CHINATOWN. Harvey Keitel was assigned the role of “Jake Berman.”\n\nTowne sold the rights to his script to Paramount for approximately $1.5 million and points, but retained his role as writer. Nicholson insisted on significant rewrites to Towne’s script, which he found convoluted, and held out on signing his own contract with Paramount until Towne delivered an acceptable revision. Evans’ credit as producer was also preserved, although Paramount, not T.E.N. Productions, had authority over all finances and distribution rights. Producer Harold Schneider, who had previously worked with Nicholson, was hired to keep the budget under control and monitor the production on-set, as Evans’ direct involvement was reportedly waning.\n\nShooting began on 18 April 1989 in Los Angeles. Locations included Hollywood’s Max Factor Building and Dresden Restaurant, a nursery in Malibu, and Nicholson’s own residence. Principal photography wrapped 26 July 1989 at Nicholson’s home. A November 1989 Variety report describes several delays in releasing the film, making it ineligible for Academy Award consideration in 1989. Speculation that the delays reflected conflicts between Evans, Schneider and Paramount, and that the 144-minute running time of Nicholson’s cut of the film was problematic for studio executives, were denied by representatives from all parties.\n\nDespite fairly positive reviews from the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times on 10 August 1990, THE TWO JAKES was not a box-office success and grossed under $10 million. Various reviews criticized the density and slow pace of Towne’s script. Nicholson’s voiceover narration throughout the film, which was added to the script by Nicholson during production despite objections from Towne, helped to clarify the plot.\n\nVan Dyke Parks’ score was released by him as a composer promo. Its only commercial release has come on a CD from L.A. Music Enterprises in Australia. Although a third film had been intended to complete a Los Angeles trilogy, the critical and box office failure of THE TWO JAKES effectively killed the final project."
