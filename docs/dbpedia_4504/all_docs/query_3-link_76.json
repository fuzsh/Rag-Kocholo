        "text": "This article discuses hula circuits across the U.S. continent as Hawaiian women became ambassadors of aloha for the territory of Hawai‘i. Performing in popular Hawaiian showrooms in New York City, Chicago, and other metropolitan areas, these performers were heralded as “hula queens,” celebrities, and success stories. Their commercial performances produced what I call an “imagined intimacy” between Hawai‘i and the United States, enabling American audiences to experience a fantasy of Hawai‘i as a different but welcoming place. Live hula performances, while elevating Hawaiians to the principal brokers of Hawaiian culture, simultaneously helped to erase the presence of large numbers of immigrant Asians who lived in Hawai‘i. Yet hula also led island women to lives and careers both inside and outside of entertainment during a time when many women were limited to racially and gender-stratified plantation and service industries. They created gendered diasporas in often hostile and unfamiliar new cities, supporting each other as “sisters” and fictive kin.\n\nHawai‘i’s most renowned song, “Aloha ‘Oe,” was composed by Queen Lili‘uokalani before she was deposed by missionary-settlers. Circulating in the cultural imaginary since the late nineteenth century, “Aloha ‘Oe” was transformed from a love song into a dirge that erased the sovereign rights of Lili‘uokalani in and beyond Hawai‘i. This article theorizes “settler colonial nostalgia” as a gendered material and symbolic process of effecting indigenous displacement and expropriation. Providing an alibi for settler society and its beneficiaries, performances of the song center settler subjects as nostalgic witnesses to, rather than participants in, the loss of the Hawaiian kingdom. Yet the politics of melancholy prove unstable, as Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian) and islander musicians continue to resignify “Aloha ‘Oe” as performances that sustain Native counter-hegemonies.\n\nThis project examines the transformation in the early 20th century of the steel guitar from a Hawaiian folk instrument to a mainstay of American popular music. The steel guitar – here characterised as a prepared instrument and a performance style whereby a guitar is positioned face up on the lap of a seated player who stops the strings by means of a steel bar – is a late 19th century Hawaiian adaption of the Spanish guitar. Its original role was that of a solo and accompanying instrument in the performance of Hawaiian music, which was itself an ethnic music tradition that had developed under American and European colonial influences. Once Hawaiian music was exposed to Western audiences in the early 20th century, its popularity grew rapidly and it evolved from an ethnic curiosity to a global popular music phenomenon. The steel guitar was at first synonymous with Hawaiian music, but just as the music became more global in its outreach, so too did the instrument itself. The steel guitar came to be gradually divorced from its original, ethnic Hawaiian context, and was incorporated steadily into a range of mainland American popular music stylings. This study examines the origins of the steel guitar, the evolution of early steel guitar style and the context in which the evolution occurred."
