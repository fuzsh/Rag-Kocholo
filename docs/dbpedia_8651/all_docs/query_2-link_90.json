        "text": "Spingarn Medal\n\nSpingarn Medal, gold medal awarded annually by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) since 1915 to honour “the man or woman of African descent and American citizenship who shall have made the highest achievement during the preceding year or years in any honorable field” (as it was phrased when the award was founded). The award was intended both to draw the attention of the general public to African American achievement and to inspire young African Americans. The Spingarn Medal, which was established on June 29, 1914, is named for Joel Elias Spingarn, a white writer, literary critic, educator, and civil rights activist who served as chairman of the Board of Directors (1913–19), treasurer (1919–30), and president (1930–39) of the NAACP.\n\nSince it was first awarded in 1915, the Spingarn Medal has been awarded each year, with some exceptions. The NAACP is in charge of administering the award, with Howard and Fisk universities designated as alternates should the NAACP ever become defunct. The first NAACP committee to award the medal included prominent leaders such as John Hope, the president of Morehouse College; John Hurst, bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church; and U.S. President William Howard Taft. The committee that year selected Ernest Everett Just, a former professor and head of physiology at Howard University Medical School, as the first recipient of the Spingarn Medal.\n\nSpingarn Medal winners include W.E.B. Du Bois (1920), Richard Wright (1941), A. Philip Randolph (1942), Paul Robeson (1945), Martin Luther King, Jr. (1957), Duke Ellington (1959), Langston Hughes (1960), Hank Aaron (1976), Bill Cosby (1985), Maya Angelou (1994), and Ruby Dee (2008).\n\nThe Spingarn Medal recipients are listed in the table.\n\nSpingarn Medal* year name field\n\n*The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) presents the medal for distinguished achievement among African Americans. The medal is named for early NAACP activist Joel E. Spingarn.
