        "text": "First lady Jill Biden attended the International Medal of Arts ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. The first lady wore a white floral printed dress under a Barbiecore-pink blazer with sharp peak lapels from L’Agence. She accessorized the look with pearl earrings from Mizuki and completed it with nude Valentino pumps.\n\nThe International Medal of Arts recipients are selected by the U.S. Department of State as part of their Art in Embassies program. The annual awards honor artists who have played a significant role in promoting cultural diplomacy efforts around the world.\n\nThis year’s recipients included Tony Abeyta, a Diné contemporary artist who comes from a lineage of Navajo artists; Sheila Hicks, who has painted in Chile and documents archeological sites throughout South America; Robert Pruitt, whose work focuses on Black figures referencing hip-hop and draws inspirations from African artistic forms; abstract painter Suling Wang and pop culture artist Hank Willis Thomas.\n\n“Art is about connection,” said Biden during her introductory speech at the ceremony. “Art is the evidence and expression of our humanity. And even when it’s easy to get caught up in differences, art can unite us. Connection is what diplomacy is all about.”\n\nShe added, “Each of our recipients today has done our world a service. In other cities and other countries, you’ve woven more threads into that same tapestry of connection and fellowship. Because diplomacy isn’t only about the government-to-government relationship; it’s people to people, heart to heart.”"
