        "text": "A universal man, Leonardo da Vinci possessed a spirit of scientific inquiry and mechanical inventiveness that was centuries ahead of its time. His genius as a painter, draftsman, sculptor, architect and engineer exemplified the Renaissance Humanist ideal.\n\nThe unfolding of his genius occurred during the 17 years he spent as painter and engineer for the Duke of Milan. Leonardo’s surviving works consist mainly of a few paintings, as well as a large number of drawings, scientific diagrams, and notes on diverse subjects. His “Last Supper” (1495-1497) and “Mona Lisa” (La Gioconda 1503-1506) are among the most popular and influential paintings of the Renaissance. Also well known are “The Virgin of the Rocks” (1483-1485), “The Virgin and Child with St. Anne” (1499) and his “Self Portrait”.\n\nDespite the fragmentary nature of his surviving achievements, his genius will continue to live as a legacy of knowledge to inspire the imagination of modern man."
