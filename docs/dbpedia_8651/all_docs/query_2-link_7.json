Kennedy.\n\n1963: The first National Medal of Science is awarded, for the year 1962, by President John F. Kennedy to Theodore von Kármán for his work at the Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The citation accompanying von Kármán's award reads: \"For his leadership in the science and engineering basic to aeronautics; for his effective teaching and related contributions in many fields of mechanics, for his distinguished counsel to the Armed Services, and for his promoting international cooperation in science and engineering.\"\n\n1970: The first woman receives a National Medal of Science. The recipient, Barbara McClintock, is recognized for her work on plant genetics.\n\n1979–1980: The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) passes a resolution proposing that the medal be expanded to include the social and behavioral sciences. Senator Edward M. Kennedy introduces the \"Science and Technology Equal Opportunities Act\" into the Senate to expand the medal to include these areas of science. President Jimmy Carter's signature enacts this change as Public Law 96-516.\n\n1992: The U.S. National Science Foundation signs a letter of agreement with the National Science and Technology Medals Foundation that makes the National Science and Technology Medals Foundation the meta-organization over both the National Medal of Science and the similar National Medal of Technology and Innovation.\n\nNomination and review process\n\nEach year, NSF sends out a call to the scientific community for the nomination of new candidates for the National Medal of Science. Individuals are nominated by their peers, with each nomination requiring a completed nomination form and three letters of support. Nominations are encouraged across the science and engineering community inclusive of individuals from the broad range of geographic, institutional, and demographic diversities represented by our Nation. We encourage you to review the eligibility guidelines, award selection considerations, nomination tips and nomination form description.\n\nNominations must be submitted through the honorary awards portal. The honorary awards portal is now closed. Please check back in early 2025 for information on the next nomination cycle.\n\n(Note to letter writers: You will receive an email from NSF Honorary Awards (<noreply@secure-platform.com.>) that is initiated by the nominator. The email will provide a unique link for you to upload your letter of recommendation. Letters of reference are limited to TWO pages.)\n\nOnce received, nominations are sent to the President's Committee on the National Medal of Science (PCNMS), which composed of 14 presidential appointees comprised of leaders in science and engineering across the Nation and two ex officio members: the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the president of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe drop down items below will help you with the nomination process.\n\nThe National Medal of Science is awarded to individuals deserving of special recognition by reason of their outstanding cumulative contributions to knowledge in the physical, biological, mathematical, engineering, or behavioral or social sciences in service to the Nation. These broad areas include astronomy, chemistry, computer and information science and engineering, geoscience, materials research, and research on STEM education.\n\nPlease note the following eligibility guidelines:\n\nOnly individuals are eligible for a National Medal of Science.\n\nYou cannot nominate yourself or an immediate family member.\n\nNominees must be a U.S. citizen or national, or a permanent resident who is applying for U.S. citizenship.\n\nDeceased nominees are eligible for the award until the fifth anniversary of the day of their death.\n\nNobel Prize winners are eligible for awards and are evaluated according to the same considerations as nominees who have not received a Nobel Prize.\n\nNominations will be carried over for a period of three calendar years, including the year of nomination. After that time, it is possible to re-nominate an individual for consideration, if they are still eligible.\n\nThe President's Committee on the National Medal of Science has established the following considerations for selection of candidates:\n\nThe impact of the nominee's body of work on the current state of their field of science or engineering.\n\nWhether the nominee's achievements are of an unusually significant nature in relation to the potential effects on the development of thought in their field of science or engineering.\n\nWhether the nominee has demonstrated unusually distinguished service in the general advancement of science or engineering for the nation, especially when accompanied by substantial contributions to the content of science.\n\nThe recognition of the nominee by peers within their community, and whether they are recognized for substantial impact in fields in addition to their discipline.\n\nWhether the nominee has made contributions to innovation and industry.\n\nWhether the nominee has demonstrated sustained influence on education through publications, teaching activities, outreach, mentoring, or other activities.\n\nWhether the nominee's contributions have had a significant positive impact on the nation.\n\nTerms Expire December 31, 2024\n\nMay R.

The tips are meant to help you prepare a package that will enable the Committee to evaluate how well the nominee meets the Award Selection Considerations.\n\n1. The PCNMS has the challenge of selecting a small set of candidates for consideration by the White House, from a (typically) large number of nominations. Virtually all the nominees are leaders in science and the PCNMS is faced with the difficult task of determining who among the nominees should be recommended for consideration. The quality of the nomination package can profoundly impact the PCNMS’ ability to properly assess a nominee. Nominators should invest the time to craft a nomination that clearly sets out the nominee’s impact, achievements, and service to their field and to the nation.\n\n2. As described in the Overview, the disciplines represented by the award cover a wide range of subject-matters. One consequence is that some nominees may specialize in an area of science not well-represented on the PCNMS. Nominators should write the nomination to be straightforwardly understood by scientists who are not necessarily experts in the nominee’s discipline.\n\n3. The National Medal of Science is a national award. Furthermore, laureates of the National Medal of Science can have a strong impact on advancing and strengthening the diversity of the science and engineering enterprise in the United States. The PCNMS looks for the nomination to demonstrate significant positive impact on the United States that can reasonably be attributed to the nominee.\n\n4. The National Medal of Science represents a cumulative achievement award for the candidate, rather than an award for a specific discovery or action. It may be useful to have the narrative statement and letters of reference address different aspects of the nominee’s accomplishments to convey the broad scope of the nominee’s contributions to science and society.\n\n5. Nominations should highlight accomplishments across the span of the candidate’s career to date. If significant accomplishments include co-discovery or team accomplishments, the committee suggests that one or more of the reference letters be from a collaborator on the significant accomplishment(s).\n\nThe following bullet points describe the National Medal of Science nomination form. We encourage you to review the eligibility guidelines, award selection considerations, and nomination tips in preparing your nomination. The information that needs to be entered includes nominee contact information, nominee history (education, positions held, honors), a proposed citation, nominator information, a narrative statement regarding the nominee's work (limited to three pages), up to 10 publications or patents, and three to five reference writers.\n\nNomination information\n\nFirst Name\n\nMiddle Name (optional)\n\nLast Name\n\nOrganization\n\nEmail\n\nPhone Number\n\nAddress\n\nMajor Discipline\n\nSecondary Discipline (optional)\n\nEducation, positions held, honors and awards, proposed citation\n\nBetween one and six of the nominee's degrees\n\nPositions held by the nominee\n\nHonors and awards received\n\nA proposed citation up to 45 words\n\nNominator information\n\nFirst Name\n\nMiddle Name (optional)\n\nLast Name\n\nTitle\n\nOrganization\n\nCity\n\nState\n\nEmail\n\nPhone Number\n\nNarrative statement\n\nProvide a narrative statement that addresses why the nominee is “deserving of special recognition by reason of their outstanding contributions to knowledge in the physical, biological, mathematical, engineering, or social and behavioral sciences, in service to the Nation.” These broad areas include such disciplines as astronomy, chemistry, computer and information science and engineering, geoscience, materials research, and research on STEM education.\n\nThe statement may be entered directly into the platform (limited to 1600 words) or uploaded as a PDF (limited to THREE pages).\n\nPublications & patents\n\nList 10 publications or patents for the nominee and include a short one-sentence commentary explaining the impact of each.\n\nReferences\n\nThree to five reference writers may contribute to the nomination. Three of the reference writers must not be from the nominee's home institution. The nomination system will automatically send an email to these reference writers and provide them with a unique link to upload their letter of recommendation. Letters of reference are limited to TWO pages.\n\nSubmit information\n\nYou may submit the nomination if you have completed the nomination forms and agree with the statement:\n\nThe information on this nomination is solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended, and will be used and disclosed to reviewers and possibly members of the National Science Board in connection with the selection of qualified applicants.\n\nNote: you may submit the nomination in advance of receiving all the letters of reference. However, you may wish to continue to engage with the letter writers to ensure all letters of reference are submitted.\n\nOnce submitted, nominations cannot be modified.\n\nDisclosure Statement: The information requested on this nomination is solicited under the authority of the NSF Act of 1950, as amended, and will be used and disclosed to reviewers and the National Science Board in connection with the selection of qualified applicants.\n\nNational Medal of Science Call for Nominations Webinar 2024\n\nCredit: U.S. National Science Foundation\n\nMedal design\n\nThe National Medal of Science depicts a human figure, surrounded by Earth, sea and sky, contemplating and seeking to understand nature. The crystal in the figure's hand symbolizes the universal order and also suggests the basic unit of living things. The formula the figure is sketching in the sand symbolizes scientific abstraction.\n\nThe gold medal was sculpted by the prolific medalic artist, Donald DeLue, who also made sculptures for Omaha Beach on the Normandy coast of France, as well as the Boy Scout Memorial Tribute in Washington, D.C. DeLue's sculpture for the medal was based on a design by Richard H. Bolt, an associate director for planning at NSF, who had a background in fine arts. The design was approved by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in Executive Order 10910, signed on Jan. 17, 1961.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nIdeal nominations demonstrate that the individual is deserving of special recognition by reason of their outstanding cumulative contributions to knowledge in the physical, biological, mathematical, engineering, or behavioral or social sciences, in service to the nation. These broad areas include such disciplines as astronomy, chemistry, computer and information science and engineering, geoscience, materials research, and research on STEM education.\n\nNominations are evaluated by a committee of distinguished scientists and engineers appointed by the president. The committee is composed of 14 appointed members and two ex officio members. The ex officio members are the director of the Office Science and Technology Policy and the president of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nWith a few exceptions, anyone can submit a nomination, including individuals from the nominee's home institution. People may not nominate themselves, nor may nominations come from immediate family members. Current NSF staff should not submit nominations.\n\nThe nomination is an opportunity to craft a compelling vision and story for the nominee; it is generally recommended that the nominator be someone who is very knowledgeable about the nominee's work.\n\nYou may nominate someone without their knowledge; however, it might be beneficial for the nominee to be involved in the process — their input may provide useful insights for crafting a compelling nomination.\n\nThree letters of support from individuals at organizations other than the nominee's home institution are required for a nomination to be considered. A total of five letters of support may be submitted for a nomination. Each letter of support is limited to two pages.\n\nYou can make as many nominations as you like — of the same person or different people.\n\nNominations are eligible for three calendar years — the year it a nomination is submitted and the following two years.\n\nAfter committee review, the president makes the final decision on who will be awarded the National Medal of Science, and the White House makes the announcement. Currently, there is no set date for making an announcement.\n\nVideos of past laureates\n\n2022\n\n2022 Laureate - Huda Akil\n\n2022 Laureate - Barry Barish\n\n2022 Laureate - Gebisa Ejeta\n\n2022 Laureate - Eve Marder\n\n2022 Laureate - Gregory Petsko\n\n2022 Laureate - Myriam Sarachik\n\n2022 Laureate - Subra Suresh\n\n2022 Laureate - Shelly Taylor\n\n2022 Laureate - Sheldon Weinbaum\n\n2013 and 2014\n\nPresident Obama Presents the 2013/2014 National Medal of Science Awards\n\n2013 Laureate - Geraldine Richmond\n\n2013 Laureate - Rakesh Jain\n\n2013 Laureate - Michael Artin\n\n2014 Laureate - Mary-Claire King\n\n2014 Laureate - Simon A.
