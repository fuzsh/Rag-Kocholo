        "text": "Download Press Release\n\nCINCINNATI— The Institute of Museum and Library Services announced today that the Cincinnati Art Museum is among 30 finalists for the 2021 National Medal for Museum and Library Service. Cincinnati Art Museum is one of three institutions in Ohio to be selected as a finalist for this award.\n\n“At a time when healing and wellness are integral to every community’s civic agenda, museums are more essential than ever,” said Cameron Kitchin, Cincinnati Art Museum’s Louis and Louise Dieterle Nippert Director. “We are pleased to learn that our art museum’s collaborations, partnerships and innovations have been recognized as central to Cincinnati’s resilience and recovery. The power of art and artists brings much-needed inspiration and connection when we need it most.”\n\nThe National Medal is the nation’s highest honor given to museums and libraries that demonstrate significant impact in their communities. For more than 25 years, the award has honored institutions that demonstrate excellence in service to their communities.\n\n\"The revival and reinstitution of the National Medals by IMLS is another signal of recovery and renewal in the nation’s very challenging—but very hopeful—times,” said IMLS Director Crosby Kemper. “We are celebrating not only the ongoing excellence of the best of our museums and libraries, but their extraordinary efforts through the pandemic, the recession, the racial justice protests, and national divisions to serve, heal, and bring together our communities. Congratulations to all 30 finalists.\"\n\nTo celebrate this honor, IMLS is encouraging Cincinnati Art Museum’s community members to share stories, memories, pictures, and videos on social media as part of the Share Your Story campaign, using the #IMLSmedals hashtag, and engage with IMLS on Facebook and Twitter. For more information, please visit the IMLS website.\n\nNational Medal winners will be announced in late spring. Representatives from winning institutions will be honored for their extraordinary contributions during a virtual National Medal Ceremony this summer.\n\nTo see the full list of finalists and learn more about the National Medal, visit the IMLS website.\n\nAbout the Institute of Museum and Library Services\n\nThe Institute of Museum and Library Services is the primary source of federal support for the nation’s libraries and museums.
