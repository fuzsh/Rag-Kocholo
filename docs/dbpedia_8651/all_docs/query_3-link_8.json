His most famous photograph, “The Terror of War,” is a permanent reminder of the past and an inspiration for a peaceful future.\n\nRicky Skaggs for his contributions to the American music industry. A virtuoso of the mandolin and fiddle, Ricky Skaggs creates and produces bluegrass music that preserves the musical legacy of the most talented artists of his generation.\n\nEarl “Rusty” Powell III for his dedicated work preserving, procuring, and expanding the world’s greatest exhibitions as the longest-serving director of the National Gallery of Art.\n\nMary Costa for her extraordinary talent, inspiration, and contribution to the operatic arts.

James Lighthizer for his decades of work protecting thousands of acres of Civil War battlefields for future generations. As a government official and then as the President of the Civil War Preservation Trust, James Lighthizer has devoted himself completely to preserving priceless historic sites so that all Americans can visit, learn, and pay their respects to those who sacrificed their lives on that hallowed ground.\n\nThe National World War II Museum for its devotion to bringing to life the story of America’s greatest generation and our remarkable victory against the forces of evil. The National World War II Museum has captivated millions of Americans with its compelling exhibits and expansive collections.\n\nThe National Medal of Arts is the highest award given to artists and arts patrons by the United States Government.
