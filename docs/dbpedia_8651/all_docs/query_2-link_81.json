AAAP is honored to be able to present Dr. Kreek with this award at the 31st AAAP Annual Meeting and Scientific Symposium this upcoming December. Dr. Kreek’s research focuses on the endogenous opioid system, which modulates stress, pain and reward, and the roles that specific opioid peptides and their receptors play in normal and abnormal circumstances. She is well known for work in developing methadone as a treatment for opioid use disorder that is used throughout the world. She has an extensive portfolio of research using preclinical models to study the roles of the μ and κ opioid receptor systems and the CRF/CRFR1 and vasopressin/V1b receptor systems in binge-like alcohol drinking models. Dr. Kreek’s team is also conducting clinical studies in cocaine- and alcohol-addicted people, and in individuals with histories of opioid use disorder in treatment receiving long-term methadone or buprenorphine-naloxone, focusing on the neurobiology components of these addictive diseases. In these studies, gene polymorphisms that may play a role in addiction or genes that may alter responses to medications (pharmacogenetics) and affect normal\n\nphysiology (physiogenetics), are identified. She is a role model and mentors to generations of substance use researchers.\n\nAbout Mary Jeanne Kreek\n\nMary Jeanne Kreek, MD, is a graduate of Wellesley College and of the Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons. She is Professor and Head of the Laboratory of the Biology of Addictive Diseases at The Rockefeller University. Dr. Kreek went to The Rockefeller Institute in 1964 to join the late Professor Vincent P. Dole; at that same time, Dr. Dole was joined by the late Dr. Marie Nyswander. The team of three performed the initial studies of the potential use of a long-acting opioid agonist, methadone, in chronic management of heroin addiction. By molecular, cell biological, neurochemical, behavioral and basic clinical research and human genetics studies, she has documented the role of the endogenous opioid system in cocaine, alcohol, and heroin addiction, which has resulted in more than 400 scientific reports. Dr. Kreek received the AMERSA Betty Ford Award (1996), the ASAM R. Brinkley Smithers Distinguished Scientist Award (1999), the CPDD Nathan B. Eddy Memorial Award for Lifetime Excellence in Drug Abuse Research (1999), the Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons Alumni Association’s Gold Medal for Lifetime Distinguished Achievements in Academic Medicine (2004), the CPDD Marian W. Fischman Award and Lecture (2005), the International Narcotics Research Conference Founder’s Award (2005), Wellesley College Alumnae Achievement Award (2014) and the Lifetime Science Award by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (2014) – and now, the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry’s Founders’ Award (2020). Dr. Kreek was conferred with honorary doctorates from Uppsala University, Sweden (2000), the University of Tel Aviv (2007), and the University of Bologna (2010).\n\nKreek investigates the biological basis of addictive diseases as well as existing and novel treatments for these conditions. Her lab also researches the medical complications of drug abuse, such as hepatitis C and AIDS. In 1984, her group discovered that the second most common risk group for HIV-1/AIDS is parenteral drug users.\n\nKreek’s research focuses on the endogenous opioid system, which modulates stress, pain, and reward, and the roles that specific opioid peptides and their receptors play in normal and abnormal circumstances. Heroin, morphine, and oxycodone, as well as cocaine and alcohol, activate these different opiate receptors either directly or indirectly. Kreek and her colleagues are examining gene expression changes in rodents that are given a drug of abuse, or are allowed to self-administer it, to study how this exposure impacts the brain’s neurochemistry, neurobiology, and circuitry, and to identify targets for potential new treatments. The lab also studies the epigenetic, physiologic, and behavioral effects of drug self-administration on the endogenous opioid system and related signaling networks. They perform microdialysis in rats and mice for dynamic studies of neurotransmitter release and peptide processing in the brain.\n\nThe lab studies the roles of the μ and κ opioid receptor systems and the CRF/CRFR1 and vasopressin/V1b receptor systems in “binge”-like alcohol drinking models using rats and inbred strains, and genetically modified mice. Since illicit oxycodone use has become a major public health problem, the lab is investigating behavioral and neurobiological changes in adolescent versus adult mice during and after self-administration of oxycodone. The researchers are also working on the synthesis and study of new chemicals, primarily κ opioid receptor ligands, which could become new treatments for specific addictive diseases and co-occurring depression.\n\nKreek’s team is also conducting clinical studies in cocaine- and alcohol-addicted people, and persons with former heroin addiction in treatment receiving long-term methadone or buprenorphine-naloxone, focusing on the neurobiology components of these addictive diseases. In these studies, gene polymorphisms that may play a role in addiction, or genes that may alter responses to medications (pharmacogenetics) and affect normal physiology (physiogenetics), are identified. For example, Kreek identified and characterized a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (A118G) in the μ opioid receptor that increases vulnerability to developing opioid and alcohol addictions and significantly alters stress responsiveness in healthy humans; a mouse model of this variant is currently used in studies.\n\nKreek is well known for her pioneering 1960s work developing methadone maintenance therapy for opioid addiction. The therapy has been documented to be the most effective treatment for any addiction, and is now commonly used to treat opiate addiction throughout the world, with 1.4 million people in daily treatment. Kreek was also one of the first to document, in 1985, that illicit drugs significantly alter the expression of specific genes in certain brain regions, resulting in neurochemical and behavioral changes.\n\n2019: Laurence Westreich, MD\n\nOur 2019 AAAP Founders' Award recipient is Dr. Laurence Westreich.
