Morris.\n\nThe School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (SHRS) is proud to announce that distinguished professor and founder and director of the Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL), Rory Cooper, has been awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by U.S. President Joe Biden during the National Science and Technology Medals Foundation ceremony at the White House. The medal is the nation’s highest honor for technological achievement.\n\nIn the presentation, the White House said that the medal has been awarded to Cooper “for empowering the lives of millions of Americans.” While on the stage next to President Biden, Cooper was recognized by the White House for his seminal achievements and contributions. “By inventing and developing cutting edge wheelchair technologies and mobility devices, cultivating the next generation of rehabilitation engineers, and championing wounded veterans and students with disabilities, he moves us closer to being a nation that is accessible for all.”\n\nThe National Medal of Technology and Innovation honors those who have made lasting contributions to America's competitiveness, standard of living and quality of life through technological innovation, and recognizes those who have made substantial contributions to strengthening the nation's technological workforce. The award is also a means to inspire future generations to prepare for and pursue technical careers to keep America at the forefront of global technology and economic leadership.\n\nCooper at the White House ceremony with his National Medal of Technology and Innovation. Photo by Rob Rutenbar.\n\nIn his nomination letter for Cooper, Pitt Senior Vice Chancellor for Research Rob Rutenbar wrote, “I have had the privilege of working with many remarkable scientists and scholars in my 40 years in academia and the technology world. Few manifest with impacts across as many areas of vital national interest as Rory — with contributions ranging from fundamental science to unique, commercialized assistive technologies.”\n\nReflecting on all of Cooper’s accomplishments, SHRS Dean Anthony Delitto said, “You’d be hard-pressed to find a more effective advocate for people with disabilities. Nothing speaks more loudly about the effectiveness of his advocacy than the inventions and patents that are celebrated with this award, all of which are designed to reduce or eliminate barriers for people with disabilities.”\n\nReceiving the award from President Biden is the first of two high-profile ceremonies for Cooper in Washington, DC, this week. On Thursday, October 26, he will be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Cooper holds 25 U.S. patents and is being lauded for his innovations in manual and electronic wheelchair technology. His advancements have proven to be breakthroughs for people with disabilities in finding independence in their daily lives and becoming more integrated into society.\n\nVideo of Rory Cooper produced by Intelligent Art Media\n\n---\n\nPublished October 24, 2023"
