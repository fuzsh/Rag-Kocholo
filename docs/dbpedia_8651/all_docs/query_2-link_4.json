        "text": "What is the National Medal of Arts?\n\nThe National Medal of Arts is an award presented by the president of the United States to honorees who have made exceptional contributions to the arts in the US. The award and nominations are organized by the National Endowment of the Arts (NEA), critiqued by the National Council on the Arts (NCA), and decided on by the president.\n\nThe National Medal of Arts is the highest award for the arts in the United States. It can be given to an individual, a group of individuals, or an organization and the award isnâ€™t limited to any specific field of art. Up to 12 individuals a year can be chosen to receive an award.\n\nThe National Medal of Arts was designed by sculptor Robert Graham and approved by the NCA. The medal features abstract human figures posing and dancing and the words National Medal of Arts and usually hangs on a purple ribbon.\n\nðŸ—“ When is the National Medal of Arts given out?\n\nThe National Medal of Arts can be given out 12 times a year, but there is no set schedule for when or how many are given out at a certain time.\n\nThe NEA was established by the United States Congress in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson as an independent government organization. The NEA assigns funding toward promoting American art and encouraging experimentation in several artistic fields. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan recommended that the NEA organize a national medal to honor artists, especially those who contribute to Americaâ€™s artistic culture in some way.\n\nThe NEA takes nominations for the award from the American public and sends them to the NCA, which narrows the list of nominees for the president to choose from. The NCA is made up of officials, critics, and other artists who are presidentially appointed and confirmed by the United States Senate."
