        "text": "Mohammed Ashraf Miah, who established the Eden Community Association and serves as its general secretary, has received a British Citizen Award certificate of recognition.\n\nThe awards programme, known as The Peopleâ€™s Honours, salutes individuals for an \"exceptional contribution to society\" and providing inspiration to others.\n\nMr Miah has volunteered in the Bradford district for over three decades.\n\nHe formed the Eden Community Association in 2020 with the aim of addressing disadvantages faced by members of the area's black, Asian and minority ethnic community.\n\nNow the multi-purpose initiative provides a wide range of services including social, healthy living, educational and recreational programmes, as well as access to learning and training opportunities.\n\nEarly last year, the association opened a base in Keighley Civic Centre as demand for its services grew.\n\nAn association colleague, Fulzar Ahmed, says: \"For more than 30 years, Mr Miah has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of disadvantaged communities. He has raised nearly one million pounds for various charities, demonstrating his commitment to making a positive impact.\n\n\"During the pandemic, he played a crucial role in supporting vulnerable individuals. He collaborated with faith groups to provide food packages and actively promoted Covid vaccinations amongst BAME communities. His efforts were instrumental in ensuring essential services reached those in need during a challenging time.\n\n\"Through the Eden Community Association, Mr Miah continues to lead vital initiatives that benefit the community in Keighley. The association offers food packages, warm spaces and essential advice on managing the cost-of-living crisis. Additionally, it provides training, education and employment opportunities for impoverished communities, enhancing their quality of life.\n\n\"He has made a significant impact through his dedicated fundraising efforts for various charitable causes, supporting those most in need within our community.\n\n\"His unwavering dedication and selfless service continue to inspire others and make a lasting difference.\"\n\nMr Miah said it was \"a great honour\" to receive the award.\n\n\"I'd like to thank my nominator for making the panel aware of my work in the community,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a great honour to receive this special certificate from British Citizen Award, which I hope will motivate and encourage other hard-working individuals in our society. You never set out to get recognition, but it is nice to receive it, and it makes you determined to do more.\""
