        "text": "Alison Krauss is one of four 2019 winners of the National Medal of Arts, an award typically awarded annually by a sitting president.\n\nActor Jon Voight, the musicians of the U.S. military and philanthropist Sharon Percy Rockefeller were the three others honored on Thursday afternoon (Nov. 21) at the White House. Additionally, four people or organizations received the National Humanities Medal: author James Patterson, chef Patrick J. O'Connell, philanthropist Teresa Lozano and the Claremont Institute.\n\nIn introducing Krauss and her honor President Trump called her \"one of the most acclaimed musicians in America,\" adding that she has \"never been confined to one musical genre or style.\"\n\nThe 48-year-old sat just to the president's right and looked sheepish as he doted on her, listing her achievements and Grammy accomplishments. \"Alison I want to thank you very much for sharing your wonderful gift with the world,\" he said.\n\nThe two awards have been given almost annually for over 30 years, but this is the first time President Trump has named winners in either category since he took office in January of 2017. Linda Ronstadt is the most recent country musician to win the National Medal of Arts, doing so in 2013. Mel Tillis, Ralph Stanley, Dolly Parton, George Strait, George Jones and Johnny Cash are others who've won since 2000."
