Stax Museum of American Soul Music is the only institution in Tennessee to be selected as a finalist for this award.\n\n“Since 2003, the Stax Museum of American Soul Music has shared the remarkable story of Stax Records at the original site of the record company’s studios in the heart of the Memphis neighborhood known as Soulsville USA,” said Stax Museum Executive Director Jeff Kollath. “The label launched the careers of artists such Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, Booker T. & the M.G.’s, and the Staple Singers, who not only recorded hit songs, but changed the landscape of American music and pop culture. The Stax Museum continues to share this music and the Stax story with a new generation of learners through educational tours, concerts, community outreach, year-round free programming, and engaging online experiences.”\n\nThe National Medal is the nation’s highest honor given to museums and libraries that demonstrate significant impact in their communities. For more than 25 years, the award has honored institutions that demonstrate excellence in service to their communities.\n\nSo many museums, so many libraries have done such good work over the last two very difficult years. We are proud to present the 30 finalists for the IMLS National Medal,” said IMLS Director Crosby Kemper. “Their work is emblematic of the response of the library and museum worlds to simultaneously fulfilling their mission and serving their communities.”\n\nTo celebrate this honor, IMLS is encouraging Stax Museum of American Soul Music’s community members to share stories, memories, pictures, and videos on social media using the #ShareYourStory and #IMLSmedals hashtags, and engage with IMLS on Facebook and Twitter.

Representatives from winning institutions will be honored for their extraordinary contributions during a virtual National Medal Ceremony this summer.\n\nTo see the full list of finalists and learn more about the National Medal, visit the IMLS website.\n\nAbout the Institute of Museum and Library Services\n\nThe Institute of Museum and Library Services is the primary source of federal support for the nation’s libraries and museums.
