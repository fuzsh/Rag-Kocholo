        "text": "We are proud to announce that Lyla Sheridan '24 won a Gold Medal in the 2024 Scholastic Art & Writing Awards in New York for her work of art, \"An Act of War,\" from Lyla's AP Studio portfolio and her investigation of how birds mimic human nature.\n\nMore than 100,000 students entered nearly 340,000 original works of art and writing to the 2024 Scholastic Awards. Lyla's work was selected by some of the foremost leaders in the visual and literary arts for excellence in originality, skill, and the emergence of a personal voice or vision. Fewer than 2,500 works received a National Medal, which places her within the top 8% of all submissions! Since 1923, the Awards have celebrated teen artists and writers from across the country. Lyla is now part of that legacy, joining the ranks of notable alumni, including Tschabalala Self, Stephen King, Kay WalkingStick, Charles White, Joyce Carol Oates and Andy Warhol—all of whom won Scholastic Awards when they were teens.\n\nLyla's work is published at artandwriting.org. Her name will also be listed in Yearbook 2024, a companion to the annual art and writing anthologies featuring selections of works by National Medalists.\n\n\"I am beyond proud,\" expressed Notre Dame's Chair of Visual and Performing Arts Martha Anne Kuntz, \"Notre Dame's Visual and Performing Arts students continue to shine, and their accomplishments go well beyond the high school level!\"\n\nCongratulations, Lyla, for this incredible honor! Go Tigers!"
