On March 21, President Joe Biden presented the 2021 National Medals of Arts in conjunction with the National Humanities Medals. In Biden’s own words, per his remarks at the event, “the National Medal of Arts to honor outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth support, and availability of the arts in the United States; and the National Humanities Medal to honor those whose work has deepened the nation’s understanding of the humanities and broadened our citizens’ engagement with history, literature, philosophy, and so many other subjects.”

Among the honorees of the night were Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Mindy Kaling, Gladys Knight, Bruce Springsteen, and Vera Wang.

During Biden’s speech, he gave a special shoutout to Louis-Dreyfus, who famously played the POTUS and VPOTUS in Veep. “Eleven Emmys. Twenty-six nominations. Honored numerous times by the Screen Actors Guild, Producers Guild, Critics’ Choice,” Biden listed. “She embraces life’s absurdity with absolute wit and handles real-life turns with absolute grace. A mom, a cancer survivor, a pioneer for women in comedy, she is an American original.”
