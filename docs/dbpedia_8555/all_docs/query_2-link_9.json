        "text": "Conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) broke out on April 15, 2023, ending several years of cooperation between the two forces.\n\nSudan has a long history of civil war and armed insurgency. Two civil wars spanning decades of the country’s history—the Anyanya Rebellion and the Second Sudanese Civil War—caused mass displacement, injury and death. As a result, even before April 2023, many Sudanese were displaced within the country due to continued insecurity. In addition, conflict in the neighboring Tigray region of Ethiopia led to the flight of 60,000 refugees into eastern Sudan.\n\nIn recent years, extreme weather shocks such as drought and flooding have also devastated livelihoods and forced more people from their homes. Most of Sudan’s population live in rural areas and depend on rain to raise crops and livestock. Swarms of locusts have descended on farmland, destroying harvests and contributing to the rising cost of food.\n\nAfter one year of fighting, humanitarian needs have more than doubled, leaving nearly 25 million people in need of assistance. Sudan also faces the world’s largest displacement crisis with over 8.2 million people forcibly displaced, including 6.5 million internally displaced people (IDP).\n\nSudan is also experiencing one of the worst hunger crises in the world and the likelihood of mass starvation in parts of the country is high. There are currently at least 18 million (more than 37% of the population) facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity—meaning that their lives are in danger from a lack of available, affordable food. This is 10 million more than before the start of the conflict, and the highest figure ever recorded in a post-harvest season.\n\nNearly 5 million people are on the brink of famine, which could lead to mass starvation and death. Nearly 4 million Sudanese children under 5 years old are malnourished, 700,000 of which are experiencing severe acute malnutrition—the most dangerous and deadly form of extreme hunger.\n\nConflict is the primary driver of food insecurity and humanitarian suffering in Sudan. It has forced farmers to abandon their lands, disrupted markets, led to massive displacement, impacted people’s earnings, destroyed public services and restricted access to aid."
