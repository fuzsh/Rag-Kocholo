I-RECs that qualify for a supplementary label from EPP certifying high impact social co-benefits in fragile, energy poor countries are known as Peace Renewable Energy Credits (P-RECs). The demand for P-RECs supports transformative new renewable energy projects in these settings. EPP is the exclusive issuer of P-RECs."
