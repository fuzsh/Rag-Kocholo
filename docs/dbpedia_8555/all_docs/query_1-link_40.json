        "text": "FEWS NET’s Seasonal Calendars illustrate the key food and income sources that are most important in a given country and indicate the months these sources are available in a typical year. Most countries have more than one Seasonal Calendar as these key variables are specific to regions within the country. The calendars also show the start and end to key rainy and lean seasons. The calendars supplement FEWS NET’s Livelihood Profiles and are integral to FEWS NET’s acute food security projections."
