Be sure to have all permits in writing. As the situation is fluid, expect the unexpected and plan to film your footage as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen To Shoot?\n\nSouth Sudan has a tropical climate. The south sees more rain than the north. South Sudan has hot, rainy summers (June to November) and warm, dry winters (December to May). For monthly weather statistics please see here.\n\nIndependence Day celebrations take place in July.\n\nSouth Sudan is a predominately Christian country. Many people also practice traditional faiths. A minority are Muslim.\n\nPublic holidays may affect timing, availability and costs. See here for public holiday dates in South Sudan.\n\nUnique Local Stories\n\nBrands are looking for local stories that match their brand narrative. Our local teams are a great lead for sourcing those unique stories and characters.\n\nIf you are looking for stories for your next shoot, send us your brief and we will pitch you ideas.\n\nIf you have a unique story you would like to pitch to a brand anywhere in the world, pitch us your idea. We have well-established processes to ensure that your ideas are properly seen and protected.\n\nCosts & Tax Incentives\n\nCosts. Locations, local talent and support crew are inexpensive but since little to no filming infrastructure exists all key crew and equipment must be brought in from abroad. Our South Sudanese fixer will negotiate local deals and provide the appropriate level of production support to match every budget. Note, many services do no accept credit cards, so it’s good to have USD on hand.\n\nTax Incentives. At present there are no tax incentives for foreign commercials or films shooting in South Sudan.\n\nFilm Crew & Talent\n\nCrews. South Sudan has a very small pool of directors, videographers and stills photographers. Key crew should be brought in from abroad.\n\nContact us if you are looking for a director, DP, photographer, videographer (cameraman / camera operator), camera assistant (focus puller), sound operator, grip, gaffer, stylist, hair and makeup, PA / runner, production driver, or any other film crew for your shoot in South Sudan.\n\nTalent day rates and buyouts are negotiable.\n\nSouth Sudan has over 60 indigenous languages. English is the official language, but Dinka and Nuer are the languages with the greatest number of speakers.\n\nThe country is home to 64 tribes with the largest ethnic groups being the Dinka, Nuer, Shilluk, and Zande. All other talent needs to be brought in from abroad.\n\nIf you wish to embed with the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA), applications must be made in writing directly to the SPLA, and our local fixer will follow up on the local end.\n\nSouth Sudan Film Equipment\n\nEquipment.

This dedicated and secure high-resolution video streaming platform allows clients from one or multiple timezones to view setups without compromise and to participate in real-time with the team on set. Separate systems can be set up for the discrete conversations that are required to make a job run right. Working remotely with our local teams reduces your content production costs, turnaround times, carbon footprint, and risks associated with unpredictable global events.\n\nArt Department, Studios, Backlots, & Post Production\n\nArt department and set construction is very basic.\n\nStudios and backlots. None exist at present.\n\nPost Production. Must post abroad.\n\nVisas & Work Permits\n\nCrews travelling on Western passports need to have visas to enter South Sudan.\n\nTo apply for a visa, you first need to apply for a Letter Of No Objection from the South Sudan Media Authority.

They will not approve any projects they suspect aim to portray governing authorities in a negative light.
