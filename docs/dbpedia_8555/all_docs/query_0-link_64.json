        "text": "South Sudan has been subjected to a devastating civil war for seven years. Nearly 7 million people, or 60% of the population, are at permanent risk of famine.\n\nInhabitants flee the fighting and lose all their livelihoods, leaving behind their homes, fields and livestock. Drought and disease make their situation worse. The World Food Programme has deployed more than 400 missions in hard-to-reach areas, supporting 500,000 people each month in food emergencies. With the peace agreement of September 2018, UN agencies continue to help 5 million Sudanese to survive, preventing and treating the acute malnutrition of millions of children and mothers who are displaced and denied access to food and care.\n\n©WFP George Fominyen"
