The clock marked 1:54:54 when he crossed the finish line, which meant that the South Sudanese athlete was almost four seconds behind the race leader. He is one of only three athletes from South Sudan who compete at Buenos Aires 2018 and given the challenges he has training back home, he has already won a battle just by getting to the competition."
