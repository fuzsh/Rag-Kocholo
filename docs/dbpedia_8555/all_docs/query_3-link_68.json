        "text": "DAMFO , part of DARKA GROUP, member of ALN in South Sudan, Sudan, Kenya and Eritrea, is pleased to announce their LCL Consolidation Service from Jebel Ali to Juba (South Sudan). This consolidation will be exclusively handled in-house, ensuring high service quality& security of your shipment whilst being customer focused and service oriented. We are offering the best transit time which is achieved through our ‘DIRECT BOX’ as this is not reloaded or trans-loaded.\n\nThe core benefits of our new service is having the best lead time on this ‘Direct Box’ service to Juba with no stoppages at any borders or check points. Our rates are competitive with direct custom clearances at our Juba warehouse. To reduce the risk of damage or losses, the cargo is handled and vetted in our own CFS warehouses. All cargo is accepted including IMCO and NON – IMCO. We have flexible shipping options which also includes proper packing, handling of goods with loading, unloading, deconsolidation etc. which ensures safe and secure deliveries in Juba. Our services also include timely pickups and deliveries for our door to door service (available on request).\n\nThere are many reasons why you should choose DAMFO but few of our main points is that with the DAMFO brand you know you have the expertise and security that is required and that we are also the pioneers and a major player for the LCL services across Sudan. Our financial strength & consistent track record over many years, scale and reliability means you can count on us to deliver this LCL service you will require. We can operate a ‘’shipped as booked’’ policy as we pride ourselves in being a key client for top worldwide carriers with planned space protection with one of the features. Also key to this service is the bonded storage facility we have in JUBA."
