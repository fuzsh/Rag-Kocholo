        "text": "Notice\n\nWinding-up orders were made against Crown Agents Limited and Greenshields Cowie & Co. Limited on 1 August 2024.\n\nFor any enquiries, please contact crownagents@kroll.com or go to https://www.gov.uk/government/news/two-crown-agents-companies-in-liquidation-information-for-employees-and-creditors\n\nMessage from the Boards of Crown Agents Limited and GreenshieldsCowie & Co. Limited\n\n1st August 2024\n\nIt is with sadness and regret that we share the news that Crown Agents has closed its operations.\n\nWhilst there were a number of contributing factors to this outcome, primarily we were unable to secure the revenue needed to sustain operations set against rising contributions to a Â£50m legacy pension liability which was also a significant barrier to external investment. This was exacerbated by the recent ongoing cuts to British Official Development Assistance (ODA) and a substantial energy procurement contract in Ukraine that was frustrated in late 2023 and which took significant working capital out of the organisation.\n\nThe directors have been working as hard as they can over the last few months to attract new investment and funding for the business but unfortunately, whilst there was much support for the work we do, it recently became clear that actual commitments to provide the cash required going forward were not forthcoming.\n\nAs we bring our journey to a close, we reflect with immense pride on the 191 years Crown Agents has dedicated to partnering with governments and improving lives across the globe.\n\nFrom our humble beginnings in 1833 with two staff, we've evolved into an organisation focussed on delivering complex programmes in challenging places. Our mission has always been clear: to provide effective solutions in procurement reform, healthcare, supply chain management, and crisis response. Together, we have delivered critical aid, strengthened public institutions, and facilitated sustainable development in over 100 countries reaching millions of people a year.\n\nTo our incredible team, past and present: your unwavering dedication, passion, and expertise have been the cornerstone of our impact. Your tireless efforts have left an indelible mark on the world and have touched countless lives.\n\nTo our partners and clients: your trust and collaboration have been invaluable. Together, we have navigated challenges, celebrated successes, and created lasting impacts that will continue to benefit communities for generations to come.\n\nWhile our chapter ends here, the legacy of Crown Agents will live on through the sustainable systems, capacities and partnerships we've helped to build.\n\nThank you for being part of our remarkable journey.\n\nWith heartfelt gratitude,\n\nThe Crown Agents Team"
