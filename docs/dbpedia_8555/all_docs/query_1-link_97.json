        "text": "UNICEF is accelerating humanitarian relief efforts in South Sudan as the country sinks deeper into its worst crisis since declaring independence in 2011.\n\nChildren are most affected by the rapidly deteriorating conditions. Conflict in neighboring Sudan, persistent and unprecedented flooding and soaring food prices are pushing families to the brink.\n\nUNICEF is reporting alarming increases in malnutrition and preventable diseases, including a massive measles outbreak. An estimated 42 percent of people have no access to safe water, and 2.8 million children are out of school, increasing their exploitation risks.\n\nA record number of people in South Sudan need immediate assistance — including 5 million children\n\nA record number of people — 9 million — are in need of immediate assistance, including 5 million children.\n\nAmong them are those who have been internally displaced by severe flooding and sporadic violence and some 300,000 refugees fleeing the war in Sudan. Most Sudanese refugees are women and children, and half of the children are school-aged.\n\nUNICEF is concerned there could be more flooding that then triggers more disease, namely malaria and cholera/acute watery diarrhea — an especially dangerous condition for a malnourished child.\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of South Sudanese already internally displaced due to other conflicts, flooding and food insecurity, many northern border areas receiving Sudanese refugees were already under stress before the Sudan conflict broke out last April, UNICEF Emergency Specialist Emma Tuck reported. Local markets have suffered from the loss of trade routes from Sudan. Prices of basic commodities have soared.\n\nAlongside other UN agencies and partners, UNICEF is mobilizing more support — including lifesaving nutrition supplies — to meet the immediate needs of children and families arriving in Upper Nile and Unity States.\n\nUNICEF teams have been working all across South Sudan to:\n\nidentify and treat children suffering from severe acute malnutrition\n\nvaccinate children against preventable diseases including measles\n\ninstall safe water supply points and distribute hygiene kits\n\nprovide emergency sanitation facilities for displaced families living in camps\n\nstrengthen systems to protect children against gender-based violence and sexual exploitation\n\nreunite unaccompanied and separated children with their families\n\nsupport teachers with incentives and training, provide learning materials and establish safe places where children can get back to learning\n\nprovide mental health and psychosocial support to children and caregivers\n\npromote innovations that increase program efficiency and impact and help build climate resilience\n\nBut more funding is needed so that UNICEF can expand these interventions near the border and in other critical parts of the country — and avert catastrophe."
